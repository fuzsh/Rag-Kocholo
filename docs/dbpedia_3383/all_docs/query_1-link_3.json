DiCaprio has gone from relatively humble beginnings, as a supporting cast member of the sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985) and low budget horror movies, such as Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), to a major teenage heartthrob in the 1990s, as the hunky lead actor in movies such as William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) and Titanic (1997), to then become a leading man in Hollywood blockbusters, made by internationally renowned directors such as Martin Scorsese and Christopher Nolan.\n\nLeonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio was born in Los Angeles, California, the only child of Irmelin DiCaprio (née Indenbirken) and former comic book artist George DiCaprio. His father is of Italian and German descent, and his mother, who is German-born, is of German, Ukrainian and Russian ancestry. His middle name, \"Wilhelm\", was his maternal grandfather's first name. Leonardo's father had achieved minor status as an artist and distributor of cult comic book titles, and was even depicted in several issues of American Splendor, the cult semi-autobiographical comic book series by the late 'Harvey Pekar', a friend of George's. Leonardo's performance skills became obvious to his parents early on, and after signing him up with a talent agent who wanted Leonardo to perform under the stage name \"Lenny Williams\", DiCaprio began appearing on a number of television commercials and educational programs.\n\nDiCaprio began attracting the attention of producers, who cast him in small roles in a number of television series, such as Roseanne (1988) and Lassie (1989), but it wasn't until 1991 that DiCaprio made his film debut in Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991), a low-budget horror movie. While Critters 3 - Die Kuschelkiller kommen (1991) did little to help showcase DiCaprio's acting abilities, it did help him develop his show-reel, and attract the attention of the people behind the hit sitcom Unser lautes Heim (1985), in which Leonardo was cast in the \"Cousin Oliver\" role of a young homeless boy who moves in with the Seavers. While DiCaprio's stint on Unser lautes Heim (1985) was very short, as the sitcom was axed the year after he joined, it helped bring DiCaprio into the public's attention and, after the sitcom ended, DiCaprio began auditioning for roles in which he would get the chance to prove his acting chops.\n\nLeonardo took up a diverse range of roles in the early 1990s, including a mentally challenged youth in Gilbert Grape - Irgendwo in Iowa (1993), a young gunslinger in Schneller als der Tod (1995) and a drug addict in one of his most challenging roles to date, Jim Carroll in Jim Carroll - In den Straßen von New York (1995), a role which the late River Phoenix originally expressed interest in. While these diverse roles helped establish Leonardo's reputation as an actor, it wasn't until his role as Romeo Montague in Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeares Romeo & Julia (1996) that Leonardo became a household name, a true movie star. The following year, DiCaprio starred in another movie about doomed lovers, Titanic (1997), which went on to beat all box office records held before then, as, at the time, Titanic (1997) became the highest grossing movie of all time, and cemented DiCaprio's reputation as a teen heartthrob. Following his work on Titanic (1997), DiCaprio kept a low profile for a number of years, with roles in Der Mann in der eisernen Maske (1998) and the low-budget The Beach (2000) being some of his few notable roles during this period.\n\nIn 2002, he burst back into screens throughout the world with leading roles in Catch Me If You Can (2002) and Gangs of New York (2002), his first of many collaborations with director Martin Scorsese. With a current salary of $20 million a movie, DiCaprio is now one of the biggest movie stars in the world. However, he has not limited his professional career to just acting in movies, as DiCaprio is a committed environmentalist, who is actively involved in many environmental causes, and his commitment to this issue led to his involvement in The 11th Hour, a documentary movie about the state of the natural environment. As someone who has gone from small roles in television commercials to one of the most respected actors in the world, DiCaprio has had one of the most diverse careers in cinema. DiCaprio continued to defy conventions about the types of roles he would accept, and with his career now seeing him leading all-star casts in action thrillers such as Departed: Unter Feinden (2006), Shutter Island (2010) and Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010), DiCaprio continues to wow audiences by refusing to conform to any cliché about actors.\n\nIn 2012, he played a mustache twirling villain in Django Unchained (2012), and then tragic literary character Jay Gatsby in Der große Gatsby (2013) and Jordan Belfort in The Wolf of Wall Street (2013).\n\nDiCaprio is passionate about environmental and humanitarian causes, having donated $1,000,000 to earthquake relief efforts in 2010, the same year he contributed $1,000,000 to the Wildlife Conservation Society.\n\nHayden Lesley Panettiere was born on August 21, 1989 in Palisades, New York, to actress Lesley Vogel and fire department captain Skip Panettiere. Her younger brother was actor Jansen Panettiere (1994-2023). Her parents are both of half Italian descent, along with German and English. Her mother got her started in the business by doing commercials when she was just 11 months old. Then, at only 4 1/2, she was cast on the soap opera Liebe, Lüge, Leidenschaft (1968), where she remained until 1997. Since then, she has gone on to appear in many feature films and TV movies. But she is probably best known in the United States for her role as \"Claire\" on the hit TV show, Heroes (2006).\n\nAs for movies, Hayden starred in Gegen jede Regel (2000) with Denzel Washington and Joe Jedermann (2001) with Tim Allen. When Hayden isn't working, she enjoys singing, dancing, horseback riding, gymnastics, taking piano lessons, and swimming.\n\nShe has been involved with many animated movies, beginning with Das große Krabbeln (1998) as \"Dot\", later to follow was Dinosaurier (2000), the video game Kingdom Hearts (2002), and The Mark of Kri (2002). Her next movie is Im Rennstall ist das Zebra los! (2005), a partly animated film, but Hayden will star in the human role; other cast members include the voices of Whoopi Goldberg, Dustin Hoffman, Joshua Jackson and Mandy Moore.\n\nIn 2003, she joined the likes of Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson and Clancy Brown in Jane Anderson's Eine Frage der Liebe (2003), a film about a Midwestern husband and father who announces his plans to have a sex-change operation. In July of the same year, Hayden appeared in a John Guare play, \"Landscape of the Body\", for the Williamstown theater festival in Williamstown, Massachusetts."
