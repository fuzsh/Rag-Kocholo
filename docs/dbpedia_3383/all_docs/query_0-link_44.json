        "text": "Fall 2019\n\nENG 105 M001 Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nM/W 2:15-3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Grzecki\n\nThis course is designed to introduce the student to three types of creative writing: poetry, fiction and nonfiction. The course will focus on inspiration (why write a poem or a story or an essay?) as well as the techniques of evocative, compelling writing across all literary genres (e.g. point of view, concrete detail, lyricism, image, metaphor, simile, voice, tone, structure, dialogue, and characterization). Students will read and analyze work by authors from various traditions and produce creative work in each genre. ETS 105 prepares students for upper-level creative writing courses in fiction and poetry.\n\nENG 107 M001 Living Writers\n\nW 3:45-6:30 PM\n\nENG 107- M002 through M010\n\nW 3:45-6:30 PM\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nThis class gives students the rare opportunity to hear visiting writers read and discuss their work. The class is centered on six readings and question-and-answer sessions. Students will be responsible for careful readings of the writers’ work. Critical writing and detailed class discussions are required to prepare for the question-and-answer sessions with the visiting writers. The first class meets in Gifford Auditorium.\n\nENG 114 M001 British Literature, 1789-present\n\nT/TH 2:00- 3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Michael Goode\n\nFew nations in the world have changed more dramatically over the past 250 years than Great Britain, and these changes are evident throughout its literature. This course moves briskly through just over two centuries of Britain’s literary history, covering the art and culture of four distinct periods: Romantic, Victorian, Modern, and Post-War/Postmodern/Postcolonial. Historical topics will include: slavery; political revolution; the industrial revolution; the Enlightenment; urbanization; evolution; religion; social reform movements; the politics of race, class, gender, and sexuality; nationalism; imperialism; colonialism and its aftermath; the World Wars; postmodernism; the politics of choosing to write in English; Brexit; and the history of literary forms. Readings will include novels, poems, plays, and song lyrics by writers such as William Blake, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, John Clare, Olaudah Equiano, Charlotte Smith, Jane Austen, Robert Browning, Tennyson, Charles Dickens, Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde, W. B. Yeats, Wilfred Owen, James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, George Orwell, Graham Greene, Sam Selvon, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Johnny Rotten, Bob Marley, Ian McEwan, and Zadie Smith. Assignments will include three five-page papers and a final examination.\n\nENG 119 M002 US Fiction 1940-2015\n\nT/TH 9:30- 10:50 AM\n\nInstructor: Susan Edmunds\n\nCourse Description: This course offers a survey of U.S. fiction, poetry, literary journalism and autobiographical writing dating from the late 1940s through the early 2000s. We will interpret assigned literary texts through a sociohistorical lens, and place particular emphasis on investigating the interconnections between literary form and social change. After an initial survey of fiction and autobiographical prose written in direct response to World War II and its aftermath, we will read texts associated with or influenced by the counterculture, the Vietnam War, the Civil Rights, Black Power and Black Arts Movements, Second Wave Feminism, and the 1965 Immigration and Nationality Act.\n\nReadings will include Jack Kerouac’s On the Road, Kurt Vonnegut’s Slaughterhouse Five, Toni Morrison’s Tar Baby, and Lê Thi Diem Thúy’s The Gangster We Are All Looking For, as well as shorter texts by Bernard Malamud, Hisaye Yamamoto. James Baldwin, Michael Herr, Allen Ginsberg, Toni Cade Bambara, Grace Paley, Sergio Troncoso, and Gloria Anzaldúa.\n\nENG 119 M003 Topics in US Literature and History: Experimental & Emerging Genres 1980-Present\n\nMW 3:45- 5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: John Colasacco\n\nBecause all writing is experimental, and no work considered valuable and excellent fails to test, reconfigure, or broaden the language, a course devoted to the recent history of experimental and emerging genres will need to examine & seek new patterns of expression in a range of exemplary texts and cultural artifacts, with emphasis on close reading practices, attention to rhetorical/historical contexts, and strategies for effective response/critique. In particular, the past forty years will frame our study of the rapidly expanding diversity of voices and forms that lead to our current understandings of literary art. Historically, experimentalism sharpens under regressive regimes; in this class, student writers committed to the idea that the stories that need to be written are the ones that can’t be told will find a through-line to their ambitious forbears, and will better understand how to read and create the texts that define literary/American history.\n\nENG 121 M001 Introduction to Shakespeare\n\nM/W 11:40-12:35 PM\n\nDiscussion Section M002 F 10:35am-11:30am\n\nDiscussion Section M003 F 10:35am-11:30am\n\nDiscussion Section M004 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nDiscussion Section M005 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nInstructor: Stephanie Shirilan\n\nThis course offers an introduction to Shakespeare’s worlds through attentive study of a selection of plays that will include examples of each of the dramatic genres: history, comedy, tragedy, and romance. These plays, and the approaches we will take to them, have been chosen to challenge the interpretive models by which you may have been introduced to Shakespeare in the past. We will move beyond the little world of man and the wheel of fortune to consider Shakespeare's unexpected representations of historical norms and enormities, cultural codes and cultural change, modes of governance, styles of comportment, and varieties of belief. Even while we consider the cultural import of reading Shakespeare in (and outside) of the Western canon, our discussions will constantly return to a central problem: What does it mean to read Shakespeare when Shakespeare wrote plays to be played upon a stage?\n\nENG 122 M001 Introduction to the Novel\n\nM/W 3:45-5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Adam Kozaczka\n\nIt has been argued that we encounter the world and define ourselves according to the ways of knowing learned from reading novels: the characters we know develop, the plots we set into motion reach their climaxes, and we divide our lives into chapters. This course studies the development of the novel as a literary form and examines how its structures and functions organize lived experience along a range of formal and ideological paradigms. How do novels define crime and transgression? How do they script marriage and idealize love? How do they construct character according to identity metrics like gender, sexuality, class, or race? We will encounter genres such as the Gothic novel, the realist novel, the magical realist novel, the novel of manners, the historical novel, and the crime novel. In the process, we will read Anglophone novels by authors from Britain, the United States, the Caribbean, and South Asia.\n\nENG 145 M001 Reading Popular Culture\n\nT/TH 5:00-6:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Hillarie Curtis\n\nWhat is mass culture and why did theorists fear its power over consumers? What is popular culture and how do fans interact with the texts they encounter? What are the differences between the two? In this course, we will explore both of these large questions by engaging with theories of mass culture and popular culture. Tracking themes of fantasy and fear, alongside various theoretical modes concerning identity, we will identify the dominant ideologies these texts communicate, the modes of resistance available to consumers, and the various forces within fan culture operating around popular culture texts. Specific case studies may include episodes of Russian Doll or Stranger Things, the Marvel Cinematic Universe, BBC’s Sherlock, Overwatch, Disney Cartoons, and other texts. Students are encouraged to bring their own knowledge and interests into class assignments and discussion. Participation during classroom discussions, several short critical essays, weekly Blackboard posts, possible quizzes, and a final creative project will all be vital components to the class. Since this course has no scheduled screening, students will be required to view film and television texts on their own time as part of the course study load.\n\nENG 145 M010 Reading Popular Culture\n\nM/W 2:15-3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Simon Staples-Vangel\n\nWhat place and value do mass forms of entertainment, literature, and art hold for our lives? How do these texts shape our communities and identities? In what ways do genres interact across different media forms? How do we interpret the self-referential style that is so common in contemporary popular texts? Throughout this course we will be exploring these and other questions. Potential texts may include literature, such as Ernest Cline’s Ready Player One, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and John Lewis’ March, as well as television shows or films, such as Jackass and Night of the Living Dead. Primary and secondary readings will sometimes be supplemented with episodes of TV shows or films, either screened in class or to watch on your own. Though we will certainly explore fiction and issues of genre and world-building, parts of the course will cover non-fiction and the more diverse forms of popular media that we are all familiar with. Students will become familiar with the major approaches in the field of cultural studies and develop a critical vocabulary to talk about the media that is interwoven with their everyday lives.\n\nENG 145 M011 Reading Popular Culture\n\nT/TH 3:30- 4:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Evan Hixon\n\nThis course will serve as an introduction to the critical examination of mass consumer culture, the industries which produce that culture and the communities which emerge around popular texts. In this course, students will explore what defines a text as being a part of ‘popular culture’ and in doing so, the course will attempt to articulate what these objects of mass consumption and the modes of their consumption might teach us about the culture that produced them and the individuals that consumed them. We will challenge the common assumption which places popular culture texts as disposable objects of consumption and we will interrogate both why we view mass consumption this way and why it is important to move past this dismissal of these texts. We will examine questions concerning what makes an object part of popular culture and what the function of delineations between various kinds of artistic consumption serve. Covering a wide range of pop culture texts, from early cinema exploitation films to contemporary television, the goal of this course will be to understand the relationship between text, industry and audience to understand popular culture and to produce a sustained interrogation of seemingly disposable cultural artifacts that permeate our culture.\n\nENG 151 M001 Interpretation of Poetry\n\nM/W 2:15-3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Bruce Smith\n\nThe course will consist of discussions of poems from the various traditions of poetry: from anonymous ballads to spoken word poetry. I’m interested in what makes the poem memorable and moving, how it is a vehicle for the intellect and the emotions, how it’s “the act of establishing communication between the mind and the heart”. I’m interested too in what ways the poem provokes and challenges us, what gives the poem its power to seduce and trouble and soothe, what gives it its music and voice as distinct from speech.\n\nStudents will be asked to write 6 two-page papers in which they examine closely a single poem by a poet from the text. Students may opt to write more papers (up to 8) and receive extra consideration for them. In addition, students will be asked to choose a poet and present the work of the poet in a 4 to 5-page paper. Emphasis in discussions is on style and substance, music and image. Multiple ways of reading poems will help the students expand the range of poetic possibilities.\n\nENG 153 M001 Interpretation of Fiction\n\nMW 2:15-3:10pm\n\nDiscussion Section M003 F 10:35am-11:30am\n\nDiscussion Section M004 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nInstructor: Erin Mackie\n\nCultures tell many of their most profound truths in their fictions. We will look at the truths of fictions across a range of narrative forms, from the faery tale to the novel. As we read we will develop an awareness of the elements of fiction: plot, setting, character, point-of-view, style, and theme. We will pay attention not only to the story told but also to who is telling it and to whom, its narrator and its audience. And always, we will think about the values, or truths, promoted by the fiction and the ends it seeks to achieve in its telling.\n\nENG 154 M002 Interpretation of Film\n\nM/W 9:30-10:25 AM\n\nScreening M002 M 7pm-9:45pm\n\nDiscussion Section M003 TH 3:30pm-4:25pm\n\nDiscussion Section M004 TH 5pm-5:55pm\n\nDiscussion Section M005 F 9:30am-10:25am\n\nDiscussion Section M006 F 10:35am-11:30am\n\nInstructor: Roger Hallas\n\nThis course provides a comprehensive introduction to the interpretation of film. Regarded as the quintessential medium of the last century, cinema has profoundly shaped the ways in which we see the world and understand our place within it. Focusing principally on classical and contemporary English-language cinema, we will investigate precisely how meaning is produced in cinema. The course integrates a close attention to the aesthetic elements of film with a wide-ranging exploration of the social and cultural contexts that shape how we make sense of and take pleasure in films. We shall also devote attention to the question of history: How may one interpret a film in relation to its historical context? Film history incorporates not only the films that have been produced over the past one hundred years, but also an understanding of how the practice of movie going has transformed over time. No prior film experience needed. The weekly screenings scheduled for this course are required.\n\nENG 155 M002 Interpretation of Nonfiction\n\nT/TH 3:30-4:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Elizabeth Gleesing\n\nThis writing-intensive course introduces students to methods of interpreting nonfiction. While we often believe that nonfiction conveys truth and reality, in this course we will focus on how different texts construct their claims to truth and make arguments about reality. To do so, we will study and interrogate the rhetorical strategies authors employ, the relationship between form and content, the generic conventions of different nonfiction forms, and how texts construct both a speaking position and an audience. In addition to introducing students to ways to interpret nonfiction, this course aims to cover a wide variety of nonfiction media forms such as the essay, the graphic novel, autobiography, memoir, documentary video and digital documentary, reality television, photography, digital games, and digital nonfiction forms like listicles and memes. Potential course texts include Alison Bechdel’s Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic, Dorothy Allison’s Two or Three Things I Know for Sure, essays by Roxane Gay, Kiese Laymon, Errol Morris, George Orwell, and Susan Sontag, and visual and interactive works such as Cutthroat Capitalism, Do Not Track, and The Whiteness Project.\n\nENG 155 M003 Interpretation of Nonfiction\n\nT/TH 5:00-6:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Vicky Cheng\n\nThis course invites students to read and engage deeply with works of nonfiction through the practice of close reading, and a number of corresponding interpretive strategies. Throughout the semester, we will analyze various types of nonfiction, including genres such as the self-help text, investigative journalism, critical reviews, performance media, and multiple forms of online and audio-visual resources. Our textual materials will take shape around the following questions: how do we approach writing \"based on the real\" with such differing representations of what is, or can be considered real? How does the representation of \"truth\" take shape across different forms of media, and in specific social, cultural, and historic moments? Moreover, how do these understandings changed based on texts geared toward oneself, directed toward others, and toward understanding the world?\n\nENG 156 M001 Interpretation of Games\n\nM/W 9:30-10:25 AM\n\nScreening M001 W 7pm-9pm\n\nDiscussion Section M002 9:30am-10:25am\n\nDiscussion Section M003 10:35am-11:30am\n\nInstructor: Chris Hanson\n\nWhat are the roles of games and play in contemporary culture and how are these roles shifting? How do we “read” and interpret a game such as Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar, 2018) or Super Mario Bros. (Nintendo, 1985)? How do we understand augmented reality games like Harry Potter: Wizards Unite (Niantic, 2019) or virtual and mixed reality experiences made possible by technologies such as the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and Microsoft HoloLens? How do games shape and change our interactions with the world and vice versa? This course will explore the evolving form of digital games, tracing their historical roots in traditional board games and other associated cultural modes of play to current and possible future iterations of video games such as esports. As we examine the development of games and their associated genres, we will investigate the historical, social, political, cultural, and economic contexts of individual games, and consider the relationship of games to other media forms and texts. We will explore the means by which we “read” and interpret games, linking these to the methods of reading and interpretation of other texts. This course serves as introduction to game studies and we will explore key critical frameworks and concepts for analyzing and understanding games and gameplay. In addition to games, we will also study screen-based media texts which explicitly or implicitly engage with the concepts of game studies. Attendance at a weekly discussion sections and evening screenings is required.\n\nENG 174 M001 World Literature--Beginnings to 1000 C.E.\n\nT/TH 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Harvey Teres\n\nInterested in becoming a more informed global citizen? This course will introduce you to global cultures as you read and discuss some of the greatest hits of literature from African, Asian, and western traditions. You will also strengthen your awareness of contexts for understanding English and American literature and culture. We will begin with some of the oldest literature in the world (Gilgamesh and Egyptian love poems), and go on to read sections from the Hebrew Bible (the “Old” Testament), Sanskrit and Greek epics (The Ramayana and The Iliad), classical Chinese philosophy (Confucius and Zhuangzi), Greek and Roman lyric poetry (Sappho, Catullus, Horace, and others), The New Testament, Saint Augustine’s Confessions, Chinese Tang and Song dynasty poetry (Li Bai, Du Fu, Wang Wei, and others), excerpts from the Qur’an, stories from 1001 Nights, and excerpts from The Tale of Genji by the Japanese woman writer Murasaki Shikibu, arguably the first novel ever written. Classes will alternate between lectures and discussions. You will have the option of either producing shorter response papers or traditional midterm and final interpretive essays.\n\nENG 181 M001 Class and Literary Texts\n\nM/W 2:15-3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Sean M. Conrey\n\nFrom William Blake’s descriptions of living conditions in early industrialized England, James Agee’s stories of tenant farmers during the Depression, to Ursula LeGuin’s’s speculative fiction focused on labor exploitation, questions of social class have long been a focus of novelists’, poets’ and essayists’ work. Parallel to the ways that writers affect and engage social class, critical readers can engage with the concepts of social class as they read. Concerned with the social divisions of privilege, wealth, power and status, class, like race and gender, is a social construction that is imposed on, and performed by, all of us as a way of stratifying and defining who we are. Though the restraints of social class readily subject us to the power of others, these restraints may also, when well understood, provide a springboard for advocacy and direct social action. This course provides an introduction to these concepts and exposes students to key texts in literature, film and other media as a way of fostering critical engagement and developing richer social responsibility through textual interpretation.\n\nENG 181 M002 Class and Literary Texts\n\nM/W 3:45-5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Alexandra O’Connell\n\nRepresentations of social class and its intimate entanglement with race, gender, and sexuality have long been expressed in American literature and film. Looking across a wide range of texts and forms, from novels to music videos, fairy tales to film, this course will examine the relationship between texts and the construction and experience of class as a historical, theoretical, and lived experience. We will consider a few central questions throughout the course: how do these texts reflect, mediate, and challenge the ways that class serves to create stratifications, identities, and affects revolving around power, privilege, and wealth? How do these different texts (dis)engage with the idea of the American dream? How does class intersect with ideas about masculinity, queerness, utopia or dystopia, spatiality, temporality, and genre? In what ways can we catch glimpses or modes of resistance or coalition building in these texts? Potential texts and authors may include Audre Lorde, Toni Morrison, Richard Wright, Justin Torres, Alice Walker, The Florida Project, Paris is Burning, and Minding the Gap.\n\nENG 182 M001 Race and Literary Texts\n\nM/W 3:45- 5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: William Marple\n\nWhat does it mean to say that race is a “social construct?” While it seems easy to recognize that the concept of race is largely a social category lacking a biological basis, it is not always quite so simple to account for the very real impact that race has on lived experience or the complex ways in which American culture and society have been largely defined by an obsession with phenotypical difference that dates back to the earliest days of the nation. The goal of this course is to explore literary and other cultural representations of race in the United States from the Revolution to the present. Through our engagement with these texts, we will attempt to interrogate the ways in which representations of racial categories emerge and re-emerge in particular cultural contexts, and to examine the ways in which these categories intersect with other categories like gender and sexuality. To address these questions, we will engage with a range of essays, short stories, poetry, and novels from such authors as Frederick Douglass, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Audre Lorde, and Gloria Naylor.\n\nENG 182 M002 Race and Literary Texts\n\nM/W 5:15 – 6:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Deyasini Dasgupta\n\n“What is race?” Is it based on biology? Is it, perhaps, a socially-constructed category? Does the categorization of race depend upon certain socio-cultural, economic, and/or political agendas? These questions mark the starting point of our discussions of race and literary texts in this class. Exploring the intersections between class, gender, sexuality and race, we will try to untangle some of the historical and lived experiences of racial identity. The aim of this class is to familiarize you with concepts of race, racism, racialized identities, and the problems of representation in literary texts, while providing opportunities for the development of your close-reading, writing, and critical analysis skills through the readings and assignments on the syllabus. To this end, our discussions will cover a wide range of time periods and literary genres, starting from early modern British drama like Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice to graphic novels like Spiegelman’s Maus, from 20th century American novels like Larsen’s Passing to pop-culture texts like Beyonce’s Lemonade album. Other readings may include Alice Walker’s The Color Purple, Anna Deavere-Smith’s Fires in the Mirror, Toni Morrison’s The Bluest Eye, Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin, and/or Claudia Rankine’s Citizen.\n\nENG 182 M004 Race and literary texts\n\nM/W 5:15- 6:35 PM\n\nInstructor: ATP\n\nConstruction and representation of race, especially as it affects the production and reception of literary and other cultural texts.\n\nENG 184 M002 Ethnicity and Literary Texts (meets with JSP 131, LIT 131, REL 131)\n\nT/TH 11:00- 12:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Kenneth Frieden\n\nA wide-angle panorama of great stories written by Jewish authors, including Abramovitsh, Sholem Aleichem, I. L. Peretz, Franz Kafka, S. Y. Agnon, Elie Wiesel, and Yiddish women writers. Topics include narrative styles, parables, shtetl life in E. Europe, modernization, ideas of coherence and progress, radical textualism, love, marriage, and the Nazi genocide.\n\nENG 192 M001 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nT/TH 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: ATP\n\nConstruction and representation of gender, especially as it affects the production and reception of literary and other cultural texts.\n\nENG 192 M002 Gender and Literary Texts (meets with WGS 192)\n\nT/TH 9:30-10:50 AM\n\nInstructor: Carol Fadda\n\nIn this course, students will read and analyze the portrayal and role of gender in a collection of literary texts, focusing on the ethnic, cultural, racial, sexual, historical, and creative implications of gender in relation to the texts' writers and characters. The selected literature includes novels, poems, essays, short stories, and graphic novel by the likes of Toni Morrison, Alison Bechdel, Randa Jarrar, and David Henry Hwang. This course is reading intensive, so students should be ready to handle rigorous reading assignments, accompanied by writing analytical papers that would reflect the students’ understanding of the issues raised in these texts. The main objective of this course is to develop students’ critical thinking capabilities as well as their analytical readings skills.\n\nENG 192 M003 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nM/W 5:15-6:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Wendy Jones\n\nConstruction and representation of gender, especially as it affects the production and reception of literary and other cultural texts.\n\nENG 192 M004 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nT/TH 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: ATP\n\nConstruction and representation of gender, especially as it affects the production and reception of literary and other cultural texts.\n\nENG 215 M001 Introductory Poetry Workshop\n\nM 12:45- 3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Brooks Haxton\n\nWeekly meetings of this workshop will focus on careful, constructive analysis of student poems, and on supplementary readings of other poetry. Besides writing a new original poem weekly, everyone will revise at least four poems on the basis of the workshop response. Reading and writing assignments will be handed out as we go. No prerequisites.\n\nENG 217 M001 Introductory Fiction Workshop\n\nM 12:45-3:35 PM\n\nInstructor: Jonathan Dee\n\nThis course will acquaint students with some of the fundamental rules, tricks, pleasures, etc. of storytelling in prose. We will spend the first four weeks reading and analyzing published stories and completing in-class writing exercises. The final ten weeks of class will be devoted to the reading and constructive critique of short stories written by you. Class attendance and participation are mandatory.\n\nENG 217 M003 Introductory Fiction Workshop\n\nTues 2:30- 3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Grzecki\n\nThis course will acquaint students with the fundamentals of writing fiction. Each week students will read and critique fiction written by their peers, as well as published work by modern writers. Students must come to class prepared and willing to discuss these stories. There will be in-class writing exercises and prompts which will lead students to create stories of their own. Class attendance and participation are mandatory.\n\nENG 242 M001 Reading and Interpretation\n\nT/TH 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Christopher Forster\n\nIntroduces students to the discipline of English and Textual Studies, stressing not what we read but how we read it. We will learn how meanings are created through acts of critical reading as well as demonstrate the consequences of pursuing one way of reading over another. This course is designed to enhance your ability to read and interpret contextually as well as closely, to help you to articulate your understanding effectively and to draw connections through reading and writing. Through close, deep and thoughtful reading of literary and non-literary texts as well as essays by critics and theorists, we will explore the ways readers produce meaning. These meanings are produced both from the perspective of each reader’s unique experiences, and through various critical and theoretical approaches. Each section of ETS 242 takes up issues of central concern within contemporary literary and cultural studies. These include representation, language, reading, authorship, subjectivity, ideology, culture, history and difference.\n\nENG 242 M003 Reading and Interpretation\n\nM/W 12:45-2:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Patricia Roylance\n\nETS 242 introduces students to the discipline of English and Textual Studies, stressing not what is read but how we read it—and the difference that makes. Its goal, in other words, is not only to show how meanings are created through acts of critical reading but also to demonstrate the consequences of pursuing one mode or method of reading over another. This course is designed to enhance your ability to read and interpret contextually as well as closely, to help you to articulate your understanding effectively and to draw connections through reading and writing. Through close, deep and thoughtful reading of literary and non-literary texts as well as essays by critics and theorists, we will explore the ways texts mean and the ways readers produce meaning. Each section of ETS 242 takes up issues of central concern within contemporary literary and cultural studies. These include representation; author/ity, textuality, and reading; subjectivity; and culture and history.\n\nENG 303 M001 Reading and Writing Fiction\n\nT/TH 9:30-10:50 AM\n\nInstructor: Sarah Harwell\n\nAll creative disciplines depend on the study and imitation of the particular art form for mastery of their elements. In this course you will read and analyze a number of short stories in order to deepen your understanding of a variety of concerns in storytelling, including voice, style, description, story, and character. We will attempt to answer the question: how have authors generated emotions, interest, and power in creative texts? You will be required to display an understanding of these issues by producing creative and analytical responses to the texts studied. Possible authors include Flannery O'Connor, Alice Munro, James Joyce, Edward P. Jones, Anton Chekhov, Donald Barthelme, ZZ Packer, Grace Paley and Raymond Carver.\n\nENG 304 M001 Reading and Writing Poetry\n\nT/TH 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Wojciechowski\n\nT. S. Eliot said that minor poets borrow while great poets steal. From classical antiquity to the present, poets have always learned their trade by imitating other poets. They have pursued their individual talent by absorbing, assimilating, and in some cases subverting the lessons of the traditions they inherit. In this class, we will read and imitate poems from canonical poets. We’ll examine each poet closely, sympathetically, and predatorily. That is, we will read like aspiring writers, looking for what we can steal. We will deepen our understanding of a variety of poetic devices, such as diction, image, music, and metaphor. We will attend to each poet’s stylistic and formal idiosyncrasies, as well as his or her techniques and habits. You will be required to display an understanding of these issues by producing creative and analytical responses to the poets studied.\n\nENG 305 M001 Critical Analysis: Introduction to Cultural Studies\n\nM/W 12:45-2:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Crystal Bartolovich\n\nWhat does it mean to be a “cultural critic”? We will answer this question by studying literature alongside mass cultural forms such as advertising, television shows, and digital culture as well as everyday practices, such as shopping, reading the news, or going to the movies, to try to understand how we learn to make sense of a globalizing world and live a particular culture—or cultures—in the U.S. today. This course will provide you with basic concepts and strategies to be able to begin to call yourself a cultural critic—a thoughtful, questioning reader. By comparing and contrasting the strategies of literary texts with other cultural forms and practices in specific situations we can consider what makes literature particular as a mode of signification (meaning-making). We will also learn the importance of situating everything we study—and ourselves-- historically. As the course progresses, you should become a more sophisticated, creative and critical reader of the world in which we live as you learn to see how literature works in, with, and against that world.\n\nENG 310 M001 Literary Periods: British Modernism\n\nT/TH 3:30-4:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Christopher Forster\n\nThe first half of the twentieth century was an especially turbulent and provocative time in art and literature. It was a period that saw the height of British Imperial power, of the “Great War,” and of rapid technological change (including the emergence of film as a major cultural form). This environment produced the art and literature frequently called “modernist.”\n\nThis class will focus on this period (roughly, 1890-1930) and the authors and literature of the British Isles (and a little beyond). We will begin with late nineteenth-century precursors (including writers like Wilde, Mallarme, and Flaubert), before spending the majority of the semester reading some of the major works of the first half of the twentieth century (in both poetry and fiction, and maybe some film). We will end by looking at work forward to the consequences of modernism in our own moment.\n\nWriters we will study might include Ford Madox Ford, James Joyce, W. B. Yeats, Virginia Woolf, T. S. Eliot, Elizabeth Bowen, and others. Assignments include two major essays and shorter regular written responses.\n\nENG 311 M001 Love and Marriage in Renaissance England\n\nT/TH 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Wendy Jones\n\nThe Beatles once famously sang, \"All you need is love.\" This course will take this phrase as a starting point for exploring \"love\" and its iterations in early modern England, especially as it relates to the institution of marriage. What was the status of \"love\" in the time of Shakespeare—a time when romantic ideals often conflicted with the realities of match-making? How was it defined, expressed, cultivated, destroyed? How did it manifest in marriage, and what were other acceptable (and transgressive) social sites of love? Texts under consideration will include literature and historical context from the time period as well as modern, scholarly research articles about this literature. Primary texts will likely include Shakespeare's Sonnets, Romeo and Juliet, and The Winter's Tale, Thomas Middleton and Thomas Dekker's The Roaring Girl, Elizabeth Cary's Tragedy of Mariam, as well as selections from a variety of poems by Thomas Wyatt, Edmund Spenser, and John Donne. Assignments will include at least one short paper, an oral presentation, and one longer research paper. Pre-1900 course. This course will meet the Shakespeare requirement for English Education Majors.\n\nENG 313 M001 Race and Literary Periods before 1900: American Beginnings\n\nM/W 3:45-5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Patricia Roylance\n\nWhen, where and with what does “American literature” begin? At stake in this question are our basic assumptions about what American-ness is, as well as our basic assumptions about what literature is. Who gets to be called an “American” and what counts as “literature”? Should Native American oral stories be part of the canon of American literature? How about the letters from Spanish and French explorers describing the Americas and its peoples? How about William Shakespeare’s The Tempest, which takes place on an island obviously inspired by the New World and which voices cutting critiques of colonization through its indigenous character Caliban? This class will place traditionally revered accounts of the British settlements at Jamestown, Plymouth, and Massachusetts Bay into the context of a more expansively defined “early America,” encompassing Native America, the colonial Americas (Spanish, French, British and Dutch), and the writers in Europe who were responding to the idea of the New World (new to them, at least).\n\nENG 315 M001 Ethnic Literatures and Cultures: The Holocaust in American Literature (meets w/JSP 300)\n\nT/TH 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Harvey Teres\n\nIf you believe awareness of the Holocaust and other examples of genocide should be a vital part of your education, this course is for you. We will explore the moral, religious, and artistic challenges faced by American writers who have represented the Holocaust and its aftermath in fiction, poetry, and non-fiction. Students will begin by reading a historical account of the Holocaust, followed by efforts to link the Holocaust to trauma studies, slavery, and other examples of genocide. We will spend the rest of the semester reading literary representations of the Holocaust and its aftermath. Texts will include Philip Roth’s “Eli, the Fanatic” and The Ghost Writer; Bernard Malamud’s “The Last Mohican” and “Lady of the Lake”; Jerzy Kosinski’s The Painted Bird, Cynthia Ozick’s “The Pagan Rabbi,” “The Shawl,” and “Rosa”; Jonathan Safran Foer’s Everything is Illuminated; Hannah Arendt’s Eichmann in Jerusalem; Art Spiegelman’s Maus I and Maus II; Michael Chabon’s The Final Solution; Nathan Englander’s “The Tumblers”; and selected poetry by Jacob Glatstein, Charles Reznikoff, W.D. Snodgrass, Sylvia Plath, Adrienne Rich, Anne Sexton, Anthony Hecht, Elie Wiesel, and others.\n\nENG 320 M001 Hollywood Directors of the 1950’s\n\nT/TH 3:30-4:50 PM\n\nScreening M001 W 7:00-9:45PM\n\nInstructor: Will Scheibel\n\nThe 1950s was a decade of socio-cultural change in the United States after World War II and industrial reorganization in Hollywood. While surveying key Hollywood directors of the era, this course will introduce you to the critical, theoretical, and historical methods of studying film authorship. Beginning with “the auteur theory” in its French and Anglophone conceptions, we will think about the signature style and personal vision of a director in relation to film aesthetics, identity, and textual politics. We will then build from these formal issues to look at directors in midcentury U.S. contexts, including the Cold War, urbanization and suburbanization, ideologies of consumerism and popular art, and constructions of masculinity and youth culture. Finally, we will consider the practical conditions of working in the industry during the decline of the classical studio system: making films at independent production companies, pushing the boundaries of censorship, and cultivating a directorial celebrity. Cinema studies has long been invested in the Hollywood directors of this profoundly transformative decade. This course seeks to understand why, and also what their legendary films, careers, and reputations still have to teach us about the history of American cinema more broadly.\n\nENG 321 M001 Shakespeare’s Medieval World\n\nT/TH 2:00-3:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Patricia A. Moody\n\nShakespeare belongs unquestionably to the early modern period, yet his world was largely medieval. Almost half of Shakespeare’s plays have direct or indirect medieval sources, and such sources are present in others. Not only the theater itself, but what he read and wrote about show direct inheritance from the Middle Ages: the stories of Macbeth, Hamlet, and Lear; the feud of the Montagues and Capulets, the blend of comedy and tragedy, the very presence of kings and clowns on the same stage. We can recognize what Shakespeare achieved by recognizing how much the Middle Ages gave this greatest of playwrights to work with. We will examine this legacy from the medieval world, from mystery and morality plays, to medieval story tellers such as Chaucer; some works we will compare side by side\n\nENG 325 M001 The History and Varieties of English\n\nT/TH 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nScreening M001 T 7:00-9:45 PM\n\nInstructor: Patricia A. Moody\n\nWant to know what runes are really about? Be able to decipher literature written in Anglo-Saxon? Read some Chaucer in Middle English? Better understand Shakespeare? Know what IPA is and how it is used? Learn why and how English speakers across the US and globe sound so different from “us”?\n\nThis course aims to provide students with as much knowledge as possible, as interactively as possible, of fundamental linguistic concepts, the basic structures of the English language and representations of its history. Equally important, the course aims to develop critical awareness of contemporary language issues and the complex ways in which language and our ideas about language embed attitudes in popular culture (including Disney!) about issues such as gender, race, and class.\n\nENG 340 M001 Theorizing Forms and Genres: Film Noir/Noir Cultures\n\nT/TH 5:00-6:20 PM\n\nScreening T 7:00-9:45 PM\n\nInstructor: Will Scheibel\n\nFilm noir (or “black film”) is a French term used in reference to dark melodramas, mysteries, and crime thrillers, traditionally from 1940s and 1950s Hollywood, but its definition varies from a genre to a visual style to a historical period. This course argues that noir encompasses different film genres, styles, and periods, and must be understood in relation to cultural expressions other than film. We will look at the various influences on what came to be called “film noir,” and what noir has influenced in turn. Beginning with Classical Hollywood cinema, the course then spans the following “noir cultures”: radio, comics, and popular literature; jazz and blues; street photography; urban and suburban geography and architecture; fashion; television; video games; and contemporary African-American, feminist, and queer filmmaking. What cultural needs and desires does noir serve? What does noir illuminate (albeit darkly) about our culture? Texts under discussion will include Blues in the Night (1941), Murder, My Sweet (1944), Out of the Past (1947), The Naked City (1948), Sunset Boulevard (1950), Blade Runner (1982), the Twin Peaks pilot (1990), A Rage in Harlem (1991), Bound (1996), Mulholland Dr. (2001), In the Cut (2003), and the video game L.A. Noire (2011).\n\nENG 352 M001 Race, Nation and Empire: Transnational Arab America (meets with MES 300)\n\nT/TH 12:30-1:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Carol Fadda\n\nThis course will focus on contemporary Arab American literary and cultural texts, emphasizing their portrayal of Arab and Muslim identities and communities in the US, while at the same time delineating the strong roots and connections that link these communities to original Arab homelands, including Palestine, Lebanon, and Iraq, to name a few. In doing so, students will read an array of Arab American texts (including novels, poems, graphic novels, plays, and essays) as well as historical and critical texts that portray the effects of transnationalism, dual citizenship, diasporic identity, racialization, and imperial wars, with a particular focus on how they intersect with gender and sexuality. Course readings and discussions are also meant to help students address anti-Arab and anti-Muslim racism in the US that well precedes the events of 9/11 and the ongoing “War on Terror.” In developing complex understandings of Arabs and Muslims in the US and their transnational links to the Arab world, we will read works by Edward Said, Rabih Alameddine, Mohja Kahf, Wafaa Bilal, Randa Jarrar, and Ella Shohat, among others.\n\nENG 401 M001 Advanced Writing Workshop: Poetry\n\nTH 3:30-6:15 PM\n\nInstructor: Gibbs\n\nThis course is devoted to the poem and seeks to answer the question that all artists face: how does one transform feeling and experience into something more than the original impulse, how does one create art? You will develop your poetic skills by reading the work of published poets, writing a poem every other week, and critiquing one another’s poems. You will be expected to extensively revise four of the poems you write. The course is open to anyone who has taken the introductory poetry workshop (ETS 215). Juniors and seniors who have not had a workshop may submit a portfolio of four pages of original poetry to be considered for admission.\n\nENG 403 M001 Advanced Writing Workshop: Fiction\n\nM 3:45-6:30 PM\n\nInstructor: Grzecki\n\nThis fiction workshop will develop and expand upon the skills introduced in ETS 217. The primary focus will be on how to write better, more effective, more technically sophisticated short stories and/or novel excerpts; the secondary focus will be on how to critique constructively others’ work in these same forms. Most of the class will center on the writing and subsequent discussion of original work created by you; there will be some for-credit in-class writing exercises and previously published work to critique as well.\n\nENG 403 M002 Advance Fiction Workshop\n\nT 3:30-6:15 PM\n\nInstructor: Arthur Flowers\n\nStandard workshop format of targeted readings, craft exercises, weekly critiques.\n\nENG 407 M001 Sexuality and Gender in Victorian Literature\n\nT/TH 11:00-12:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Coran Klaver\n\nThe Victorian period stands in an interesting relation to our own--with surprising correspondences and disjunctions. These are particularly compelling in the areas of gender and sexuality. Despite the impression of many, Victorian culture and practice was often quite queer, with a proliferation of non-normative and perverse genders and sexualities. In this course we will examine a range of literary and cultural texts that engage more or less explicitly with genders and sexualities that push the boundaries of the mainstream and normative. Our investigations will draw upon the insights of recent feminist and queer theory and the context provided by primary and secondary historical materials. Our reading will include fiction by Charlotte Bronte, Charles Dickens, Thomas Hardy, Robert Louis Stevenson, Bram Stoker, Oscar Wilde and poetry by Alfred Lord Tennyson, ‘Michael Field,’ Christina Rosetti, and others. This Advanced Critical Writing course will help you to hone your research and writing skills and engage in deep and sustained critical inquiry. This course can be used in place of ETS 305.\n\nENG 410 M001 Practices of Games\n\nM/W 3:45-5:05 PM\n\nInstructor: Chris Hanson\n\nThis course will explore the evolving form of digital games, tracing their historical roots in analog board games and other associated cultural modes of play to current and possible future iterations of video games. We will employ a range of critical approaches to gaming; digital games will be “read” and critically interrogated as texts, and the relationships between game, player, design, software, interface, and structures of play will be discussed. We will explore analyzing and designing games to better understand the boundaries of what defines games and play in their separation from everyday life.\n\nENG 420 M001 Cultural Production and Reception: Reading Feeling\n\nT/TH 3:30-4:50 PM\n\nInstructor: Coran Klaver\n\nWhat does it mean to read feeling? This course attempts to answer this question by using recent theoretical work on feelings and emotions as an analytical lens to examine a broad range literary and cultural studies. The course will be organized around several questions and problematics including: 1) the relationship between affect theory and psychoanalytic theory; 2) embodied affects; 3) sympathy and empathy as modes of communicating affect and emotion; 4) animal affects; and 5) specific emotional affect and emotional formulations such as melancholia, grief and mourning, shame and humiliation, love and intimacy, and hatred, particularly in relation to traumatic racial histories, the climate crisis, queer identities, and so forth. In order to explore these issues as well as to explore the role of literary texts in the expression and representation of affects, we will read one nineteenth-century novel, three twentieth-century novels, and a series of short texts including fiction and poetry.\n\nENG 494 M001 Research Practicum\n\nTH 3:30-6:20 PM\n\nInstructor: Crystal Bartolovich\n\nThis one-credit course introduces students to the scope and demands of an honors and/or distinction project in ETS. Enrollment is by invitation to participate in the distinction program, and/or honors program, only. In five formal meetings, we will cover choosing an advisor, developing a suitable topic with engaging research questions, compiling a bibliography, reading critically, taking notes effectively, and writing a thesis proposal. Our work should prepare you to write your thesis in the spring semester, when you will enroll in ENG 495, Thesis Writing Workshop.\n\nSpring 2019\n\nETS 105 Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nM001 TuTh 9:30-10:50am\n\nM002 TuTh 3:30-4:50pm\n\nInstructor: Nana Adjei-Brenyah\n\nIn this class we’ll explore the power and craft of poetry, fiction and creative non-fiction\n\nETS 107 Living Writers\n\nM002-M011 W 3:45-6:30 PM\n\nThis class gives students the rare opportunity to hear visiting writers read and discuss their work. The class is centered on six readings and question-and-answer sessions. Students will be responsible for careful readings of the writers’ work. Critical writing and detailed class discussions are required to prepare for the question-and-answer sessions with the visiting writers. The first class meets in Gifford Auditorium.\n\nETS 114 M001 British Literature, 1789 to Present\n\nMW 5:15-6:35 pm\n\nInstructor: Vicky Cheng\n\nThis course offers a survey of British Literature spanning the Romantic period, the Victorian period, the twentieth century, and the present. In this course, we will focus on British identity as reflected through historical events, social reform, cultural movements, and literary form. To this end, we will read and interpret visual and written texts interrogating what it means to be British, the ideologies that consolidate this sense of identity, and how “Britishness” becomes reified or challenged through political revolution, nationalism/imperialism, and (de)colonialism. Readings will span a broad range of forms, from novels and short stories to poetry and film.\n\nETS 117 M001 Survey of American Literature, Beginnings to 1865\n\nMW 12:45-2:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Patty Roylance\n\nThis is a course about the making of America. “America” (the idea—the concept of this particular place and what it symbolized) was produced in and through representations of the Western Hemisphere written both by people who lived and traveled here and by people who had never been here at all. This course will investigate how these representations did the work of “making” “America,” in ways that still influence our conceptions of this place. We will treat early American writing as an historical artifact, in which writers responded to and attempted to shape major events and issues in their historical context. We will cover over three hundred years, during which span of time various literary genres waxed and waned in their importance, moving especially from nonfictional poetry and prose in the early periods to the rise of the novel and other fictional forms in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This course will be discussion-based and will help you to develop and sharpen your skills of reading, analyzing, and writing about literature, as well as encouraging you to question and investigate the meaning of “America.”\n\nETS 122 M001 Introduction to the Novel\n\nTuTh 5:00-6:20 pm\n\nInstructor: Haejoo Kim\n\nThis class explores the novel and its form by looking at some of the representative novels in terms of formal, historical, and national varieties. Some of the questions we will work on are: What are the narrative conventions of the novel? How do they affect the ways in which we perceive and imagine the world? How do the authors engage with these conventions, play with them and also challenge them? How can we understand the novelistic form in relation to the history of modernity? How do different sociopolitical perspectives and contexts change the literary form? Practicing close reading and critical analysis, students will develop skills to examine formal elements of the novel in relation to the conceptual frames of race, gender, class and nation. Readings may include: Jane Austen’s Northanger Abbey, Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre, Jamaica Kincaid’s Lucy, Octavia Butler’s Kindred, Kazuo Ishiguro’s Never Let Me Go.\n\nETS 122 M003 Introduction to the Novel\n\nMW 12:45-2:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Evan Hixon\n\nThis course will examine the long history of the novel form, with an eye turned towards how the form has shifted and adapted over the past 500 years. Looking at a wide-range of novels, students will interrogate the texts to better understand the ways in which novels are shaped by the cultures that produce them and the ways that novels in turn shape culture. The course will examine the novel as an ever changing, self-reflective form of writing that is always in conversation with its own past. To this end, we will be reading novels from the 16th century onward, looking at major movements and genres in British and American literature. From the misguided romance of Don Quixote to the digressive mysteries of The Crying of Lot 49, this course will challenge students to engage deeply with the novel form its earliest roots in medieval chivalric tales through to its post-modern turn during the 20th century. This course will also place the novel into various critical and theoretical conversations concerning issues of class, race, gender and sexuality as the novel becomes engaged with shifting culture understandings of identity and representation. Possible texts include: Miguel de Cervantes’s Don Quixote, Toni Morrison’s Beloved and Charlotte Brontë’s Jane Eyre.\n\nETS 145 Reading Popular Culture\n\nMW 5:15-6:35 pm\n\nInstructor: John Sanders\n\nCan video games, television shows, and viral videos be considered “art”? How has the Internet and an interconnected media ecosystem affected how we tell and engage with stories? How do the processes of adaptation and appropriation shape cultures and identities within the United States and the world at large? In ETS 145, we will be investigating these questions by engaging with theories of popular culture and analyzing a range of texts across genres, media, and history. Over the course of the semester, students will become familiar with major approaches in the field of cultural studies and develop a critical vocabulary to talk about the media landscape which structures their everyday lives. Topics will include debates surrounding mass culture, adaptation, transmedia storytelling, fandom, nonlinear narrativity, and Internet memes. Readings will sometimes be supplemented with movie screenings, episodes of TV shows, or gameplay sessions, or with examples provided in lecture.\n\nETS 146 M001 Interpretation of New Media\n\nMW 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nInstructor: Chris Hanson\n\nDiscussion Section M002 F 10:35-11:30am\n\nDiscussion Section M003 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nDiscussion Section M004 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nDiscussion Section M005 F 12:45pm-1:35pm\n\nWhile print, films, interactive texts, and other modes of expression have traditionally been construed as separate entities, now we may also read and experience these diverse forms through a screen-based device such as a computer or mobile device. This course studies the growing number of forms in which a given cultural text is expressed and how our understanding of that text is shaped by its medium. We will examine the means by which “new” screen media are defined as well as the textual, cultural, and social implications of their deployment. While the boundaries between “old” media were clearly demarcated, digital media merge forms and practices with new technologies of production, delivery, and display. We will explore the commonalities across a range of screen-based forms, while also assessing the unique aspects that truly differentiate a given medium from another. This course will examine the function of medium specificity and its application to both “old” and “new” textual forms to map the ways in which our modes of reading shift from text to text and from screen to screen.\n\nETS 151 M001 Interpretation of Poetry\n\nMW 2:15-3:35 pm\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nThe course will consist of discussions of poems from the various traditions of poetry: from anonymous ballads to spoken word poetry. I’m interested in what makes the poem memorable and moving, how it is a vehicle for the intellect and the emotions. I’m interested too in what ways the poem provokes and challenges us, what gives the poem its power to seduce and trouble and soothe, what gives it its music and voice as distinct from speech. Students will be asked to write 6 two-page papers in which they examine closely a single poem by a poet from the text. Students may opt to write more papers (up to 8) and receive extra consideration for them. In addition, students will be asked to choose a poet and present the work of the poet in a 4 to 5 page paper. Emphasis in discussions is on style and substance, music and image. Multiple ways of reading poems will help the students expand the range of poetic possibilities.\n\nETS 153 M002 Interpretation of Fiction\n\nMW 2:15-3:35\n\nInstructor: Sean M. Conrey\n\nThis course introduces students to techniques and approaches to interpreting and analyzing fiction. We will develop close reading skills while learning to recognize the formal aspects of literary fiction, namely plot, character, setting, point of view, imagery and intertextuality. Across a range of texts from short stories, comics, novels, digital media and video games, we will work at developing critical reading habits in conjunction with the skills necessary to convey our interpretations in writing. Readings will be loosely organized around ways that cultures and countercultures interact, considering the dynamics between cultural insiders and outsiders, the position of the \"other,\" and particularly the ways that artists can interrupt, reify, interrogate and disturb privileged ways of living. Texts in this course may include stories by Denis Johnson, Toni Cade Bambara, and Mohja Kahf, novels (graphic and otherwise) such as Watchmen by Alan Moore and The Dispossessed by Ursula K. LeGuin, films such as Strocek and Lost in Translation, and the video game Never Alone.\n\nETS 154 M001 Interpretation of Film\n\nMW 12:45-1:40pm\n\nScreenings M 7:00pm\n\nInstructor Will Scheibel\n\nDiscussion Section M004 F 11:40am-12:35pm\n\nDiscussion Section M005 F 12:45pm-1:40pm\n\nDiscussion Section M006 F 9:30-10:25am\n\nDiscussion Section M007 F 9:30-10:25am\n\nDiscussion Section M008 F 10:35-11:30am\n\nDiscussion Section M009 F 10:35-11:30am\n\nFilm was the dominant medium of the last century and yet we have only begun to understand it, especially in the post-celluloid period of digital and convergent screen cultures. What is the formal “language” of cinema? What are the elements of style through which films communicate? What are the interpretive tools necessary to “read” those elements? In this course, you will learn the audiovisual literacy skills for approaching these broad but fundamental questions to the critical study of films as texts. We will move from close analysis of film techniques and practice (sound, mise-en-scène, cinematography, and editing) to larger contexts of aesthetic meaning: narrative, genre, stardom, marketing and reception, authorship and representation, global cinema cultures, and the relationship between film and other media. Screenings will cover both classical and contemporary cinemas, including studio-era Hollywood productions, contemporary blockbusters, groundbreaking U.S. political films, and acclaimed international art films, in addition to innovative works from documentary and avant-garde traditions.\n\nETS 155 Interpretation of Nonfiction\n\nM002 TuTh 11:00 am – 12:20 pm\n\nM003 MW 3:45-5:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Steven Doles\n\nThis course is a cross-media introduction to the interpretation of nonfiction. Students in the course will be exposed to a variety of forms of literary nonfiction, including the essay, memoir, journalism, true crime, and popular medical account. Visual and interactive works of nonfiction will include documentaries, essay films, news broadcasts, photo essays, reality television, and serious games. The organizing idea behind the course is the way in which nonfiction texts bring us to look anew at ourselves and at others. We will give particular attention to texts which give intense scrutiny to their authors’ own lives and histories, as well as those of other people, particularly across lines of class, race, and ability. Assignments for the course will include two response papers, a shorter critical essay, an essay project proposal, and a longer final critical paper. Grades will also include a participation component and occasional pop reading quizzes.\n\nETS 181 M002 Class and Literary Texts\n\nMW 12:45-2:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Deyasini Dasgupta\n\n“Class” is a term that is at once familiar and yet so complex: not only does it surmount the boundaries (real or imagined) of space, time, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity and language, the concept of “class” persists even today as an indelible marker of our identity. In this course, therefore, our objective will be to explore and untangle some of the historical and lived experiences of “class”—both within and as a part of various intersecting social forces. Looking across a wide range of periods and forms, from early modern drama to contemporary novels, murder mysteries to TV shows and songs, we will interrogate and analyze the ways in which different texts serve as mediating objects in the construction of class-based identity throughout history. Using methods of close-reading and intertextual analysis, we will engage with “class” both as an identity and as a cultural category. Some of the texts we’ll look at include Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice, Downton Abbey episodes, Alice Walker’s The Color Purple, Tillie Olsen’s Yonnondio, Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express, George Orwell’s Animal Farm, Elizabeth Gaskell’s North and South (BBC adaptation), and/or song selections from Hamilton.\n\nETS 182 Black Women Writers\n\nTuTh 5:00-6:20pm\n\nInstructor: Marquis Bey\n\nBlack women are often overlooked when exploring the intellectual and literary traditions of America. How, then, might our understanding of history, politics, and the social shift if we took seriously the writings of black women? Spanning the era of American enslavement through Jim Crow into the 21st-century, in this course students will explore how black women's writing has been a major contributor to the long struggle for freedom.\n\nThis course will take as fundamental that black women present a radical method of thinking and living that centers those who are marginalized by race and gender-namely, black feminism. This mode of thinking arises unwaveringly from black women-black women who have a range of gendered expressions and statuses-and we will use essays, poems, multimedia, and music to explore black feminist knowledges. We will cover a wide array of tropes and themes that often emerge from this tradition: slavery, the intersection of race and gender, love and sex, black gender relations, queerness and transess, diaspora, masculinity, and more. Exploring these themes will permit students to sample the pressing points not only in a rich tradition but also still pervasive in their contemporary lives.\n\nETS 184 M001 Ethnicity & Literary Texts\n\nMW 5:15-6:35pm\n\nInstructor: Elizabeth Gleesing\n\nThe United States is commonly referred to as a multicultural society, a melting pot, and a nation of immigrants. With these designations in mind, this class seeks to question the relationship between identity and ethnicity in contemporary U.S. literary texts. In taking ethnicity as a lens, we can ask questions about what it means to be included in or excluded from American identity and what relationship there is between who we are and the places from which we and our ancestors have come. Along with these central questions, we will analyze themes of intra- and intergenerational conflict, in-between identities that seem to straddle national borders, and experiences of being a refugee or being a stateless person, effectively estranged from one’s home country. We will study short stories, poems, essays, visual works, and novels from some of the following authors: Gloria Anzaldúa, Louise Erdrich, Jhumpa Lahiri, Colm Tóibín, Helena María Viramontes, and Gene Luen Yang. In addition to written texts, we will also look at how visual works like Beyoncé’s Lemonade and digital documentaries communicate ideas of generational change, historical memory, and displacement. Assignments are likely to include weekly informal responses, short analysis assignments, and two longer argumentative papers.\n\nETS 184 M002 Ethnicity & Literary Texts\n\nTuTh 3:30-4:50pm\n\nInstructor: Chris Barnes\n\nWhat is ethnicity, and what role does it play in the formation of identities and notions of belonging in the United States? Through a study of literary and other cultural texts, this course will interrogate issues of ethnicity in America in the twentieth and twenty-first century. We will address topics and themes such as the construction and negotiation of ethnic identities, generational conflicts over those identities, notions of belonging and/or estrangement from one’s homeland, and the racialization of ethnicity. Authors may include Gloria Anzaldúa, Mohsin Hamid, Leslie Marmon Silko, and Art Spiegelman. Through classroom participation, close reading exercises, and essay assignments, students will learn how to use the practice of close reading to interpret and analyze how texts engage with ethnicity as an identity and cultural category.\n\nETS 192 M001 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nMW 3:45-5:05pm\n\nInstructor: Rhyse Curtis\n\nWhat does it mean to say that gender is socially constructed? In this writing intensive course, we will explore this question. Throughout the semester, students will uncover how texts represent bodies, and how ideological and social structures, such as marriage, family, friendship, heteronormativity and homosociality, and feminism and patriarchy, seek to mold and support particular gender representations while excluding or controlling other modes of being. We will also discuss how gender intersects with other identity markers such as race, class, sexual orientation, and disability. The class will look at a range of media and genres, including fiction, nonfiction, poetry, theater, film, the graphic novel, fanfic, games, and music. Readings may include works by Radclyffe Hall, Langston Hughes, Margaret Atwood, and Alison Bechdel, and critical readings may come from the works of Foucault, Butler, Halberstam, Irigaray, and hooks, among others. Students will also be required to view several films outside of class time, including Fight Club and Moonlight. Through rigorous classroom participation, weekly written responses, three essay assignments, and a class presentation, students will learn the practice and application of close reading to interpret and analyze texts for how they utilize the body as a means of “doing gender.”\n\nETS 192 M002 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nTuTh 3:30-4:50 pm\n\nInstructor: Dorri Beam\n\n“I do/ I don’t: Marriage, Gender, and Sexuality in American Literature”: This course examines the development of the institution of marriage in the U.S. and the way it shapes lives, identities, gender roles, social relations, and the very fabric of society. Beginning in the nineteenth century and ending with recent marriage equality debates, we’ll examine literary representations of marriage and deviations from it--including bachelorhood, romantic friendship, Boston marriage, extended kinship networks, interracial marriage, divorce, polygamy, and gay marriage—to ask how gender and sexuality are being shaped by each imaginative plotting of marriage or resistance to it. Texts will range from Hannah Foster’s The Coquette and short stories by Henry James and Sarah Orne Jewett, to Zitkala Sa’s American Indian Stories, and up to Christopher Isherwood’s A Single Man, Silva Plath’s The Bell Jar, Alison Bechdel’s graphic novel, Fun Home, and the TV series Big Love.\n\nETS 192 M003 Gender and Literary Texts\n\nMW 5:15pm-6:35pm\n\nInstructor:Melissa Welshans\n\nAs current social movements like #MeToo and the events that lead to them underscore, one's gender and how society defines gender have broad implications for how individuals experience the world around them. But what is \"gender,\" how has it been defined, and by whom? And how can an understanding of \"gender\" enrich our interpretation of literature and media? This class will answer these questions and more through an examination of texts including William Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew and it's film adaptation Ten Things I Hate About You, Charlotte Perkins Gilman's The Yellow Wallpaper, James Baldwin's Giovanni's Room, the 1990 film Paris is Burning, the 2014 film The Babadook, and episodes of TV shows like Dietland and Queer Eye. Along with these texts, we will also read literary theory by a number of critics, including Simone de Beauvoir, Virginia Woolf, bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Judith Butler, Jack Halberstam, and others. This is a writing intensive course, so assignments will include at least two 6 page papers, a required course journal, as well as an oral presentation.\n\nETS 200 M001 Special Topics: Modern Horror Fiction\n\nMW 12:45-2:05pm\n\nInstructor: Steven Doles\n\nIn recent decades horror fiction has become a massive genre and industry, with a number of authors such as Stephen King, Dean Koontz, and Anne Rice repeatedly topping bestseller lists. While horror has a longer lineage tracing back through the ghost and gothic tales of previous centuries, the horror genre itself developed through publishing and readership practices in the early and mid-twentieth century. Although horror fiction focuses on something as idiosyncratic and personal as what each of us finds scary, the genre is often highly self-aware of its own history, influences, and devices. We will read a number of authors throughout the semester, including (in rough chronological order) Algernon Blackwood, H.P. Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, Stephen King, Clive Barker, Joyce Carol Oates, Thomas Ligotti, and Victor LaValle, among others. To further our understanding of how horror developed as a genre and of how authors conceive of their work, we will also read major critical statements by Lovecraft, King, and Ligotti, and might also look at small press publications by horror fans, as well as horror on old time radio shows such as Lights Out, in comics such as EC Comics Tales from the Crypt, and on television shows such as The Twilight Zone and True Detective.\n\nETS 215 Introductory Poetry Workshop\n\nM 5:15-8:00 pm\n\nInstructor: Staff\n\nWeekly meetings of this workshop will focus on generating and critiquing student poems, and on supplementary readings of other poetry. Besides writing a new original poem every week, everyone will revise at least four poems on the basis of the workshop response. Reading and writing assignments will be handed out as we go. No prerequisites.\n\nETS 217 Introductory Fiction Workshop\n\nM001 M 3:45-6:30 pm\n\nInstructor: Nana Adjei-Brenyah\n\nThis workshop represents a chance to grow as an artist and writer. To do this we’ll focus on reading, writing and revising, which are the pillars of this kind of growth. We will think of ourselves as artists in pursuit of our greatest artistic self. We will challenge one another to work at our highest level in this pursuit. In this class we will practice through various methods, but our collective goal will be to encourage and inspire each other to write work that is “us.”\n\nETS 217 Introductory Fiction Workshop\n\nM003 Tu 3:30-6:15pm\n\nInstructor: Dana Spiotta\n\nThis class will introduce students to the fiction workshop. Participants in the workshop will learn how to write a story, how to read closely and how to critique and revise stories. In class we will discuss student work as well as published work from outside the class. We will do in-class writing exercises, and each student will keep a writing notebook.\n\nETS 230 M001 Ethnic Literary Traditions\n\nTuTh 2:00-3:20 pm\n\nInstructor: Ken Frieden\n\nAn exploration into Jewish humor and satire. What are its characteristics? What does it mean? How does it work? What does it say about Jewish identity? We begin with Freudian theory and then focus on Yiddish satire and American humor. Class sessions will analyze literary works (e.g., by Sholem Aleichem, Leo Rosten, and Philip Roth), American Jewish stand-up comedy routines (e.g., by Lennie Bruce and Allan Sherman), early Yiddish movies (e.g., Yidl mitn fidl) and American films (e.g., by the Marx Brothers, Mel Brooks, and Woody Allen). There will be weekly short writing assignments, to be posted on Blackboard and submitted in hard copy. Students are encouraged to bring their own Jewish film clips and jokes to class. To encourage active participation, students work in groups to present some aspect of American Jewish humor, such as female performances and television series, political satires, Jewish episodes in mainstream shows, and the limits of bad taste (e.g., as reflected in reactions to Larry David’s Holocaust-related humor). Last year, one option for the final project was to perform a five-minute standup routine. No prerequisites—no prior knowledge of Jewish culture or Jewish jokes is assumed. Meets with JSP/LIT/REL 237: Jewish Humor and Satire\n\nETS 242 Reading & Interpretation\n\nM001 TuTh 9:30-10:50 am\n\nInstructor: Coran Klaver\n\nM005 MW 12:45-2:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Erin Mackie\n\nIntroduces students to the discipline of English and Textual Studies, stressing not what is read but how we read it—and the difference that makes. Its goal, in other words, is not only to show how meanings are created through acts of critical reading but also to demonstrate the consequences of pursuing one mode or method of reading over another. This course is designed to enhance your ability to read and interpret contextually as well as closely, to help you to articulate your understanding effectively, and to draw connections through reading and writing. Through close, deep, and thoughtful reading of literary and non-literary texts as well as essays by critics and theorists, we will explore the ways texts mean and the ways readers produce meaning.\n\nETS 303 M001 Reading & Writing Fiction\n\nTuTh 12:30-1:50 pm\n\nInstructor: Nana Adjei-Brenyah\n\nWe’ll read the best fiction we can, we’ll learn to delight in its power.\n\nENG 304 M001 Reading & Writing Poetry\n\nTuTh 9:30-10:50 am\n\nInstructor: Sarah Harwell\n\nT. S. Eliot said that minor poets borrow while great poets steal. From classical antiquity to the present, poets have always learned their trade by imitating other poets. They have pursued their individual talent by absorbing, assimilating, and in some cases subverting the lessons of the traditions they inherit. In this class, we will read and imitate poems from canonical poets. We’ll examine each poet closely, sympathetically, and predatorily. That is, we will read like aspiring writers, looking for what we can steal. We will deepen our understanding of a variety of poetic devices, such as diction, image, music, and metaphor. We will attend to each poet’s stylistic and formal idiosyncrasies, as well as his or her techniques and habits. You will be required to display an understanding of these issues by producing creative and analytical responses to the poets studied.\n\nETS 305 M001 Critical Analysis: Literature and Its Media\n\nMW 12:45-2:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Chris Forster\n\nWe usually talk about “novels,” “poems,” or “films” (and texts of various other kinds). But what about the paper and ink (or parchment or wax or celluloid or LCD screens or tablets) that carry those texts? Does the history of these materials affect literary forms? Do they change how, or what, we read? This class pursues these questions by turning to the field of media studies, to see what implications it may have students of literature and culture. This class will cover a diverse and historically broad set of materials and concerns, looking at the history of texts from the ancient world (and oral poetry) through to contemporary developments in digital culture (poetry written on, and with, the Web; novels written on Twitter). We’ll read key thinkers and theorists of media studies (and related fields, like book history) as well as literary texts which foreground their own medium in provocative ways (like Tristram Shandy). Likely critics include Plato, Walter Ong, Marshall McLuhan, Friedrich Kittler, and Walter Benjamin, alongside works by major poets, novelists, and writers (including Laurence Sterne, E. E. Cummings, and Teju Cole). Course work will include a final essay, regular short responses, and a presentation to the class, as well as some experiments with media and its history.\n\nETS 310 Literary Periods: Reading and Being Green Today\n\nTuTh 12:30-1:50 pm\n\nInstructor: Crystal Bartolovich\n\nEarth Scientists have proposed that immediate, drastic action is needed to combat climate change and other ecological disruptions, and yet concrete interventions remain slow and inadequate. This course will consider how fiction might help encourage the lifestyle and policy changes that scientific facts, on their own, have not yet managed to produce. We will examine contemporary eco-fictions in various media, such as poems and novels by Atwood, Vandermeer, Powers, Octavia Butler, Indra Singh, Piercy, Erdrich or Silko, as well as films such as Okja, Wall-E, or Avatar. To evaluate the potential usefulness (or deficits) of their techniques and appeals, we will compare and contrast them with earlier eco-interventions that achieved considerable success, such as The Jungle, The Whole Earth Catalogue and Silent Spring, as well as current non-fiction eco-interventions such as The Sixth Extinction, Wangari Maathai’s “how to” eco-guides or “The Story of Stuff.” Assignments will include 2 short critical papers and a collaborative final project integrating literature, film or other creative cultural forms into a proposal for a concrete eco-justice initiative on campus. The class will engage throughout with serious practical considerations of how to change ourselves and the planet to encourage mutual thriving for all.\n\nETS 320 M002 Authors: James Joyce\n\nTuTh 2:00-3:20 pm\n\nInstructor: Chris Forster\n\nThis class offers an opportunity to read, with an unusual depth of attention and care, the major works of one of the most important and challenging writers of the twentieth-century: James Joyce. We will begin the semester by reading a selection from Joyce's early collection of short stories Dubliners and his autobiographical bildungsroman A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, before beginning a patient, chapter by chapter reading of Ulysses—a novel that regularly appears near, or at, the top of lists of “greatest” novels of the twentieth century. While our focus is on a single writer, Joyce’s work and the evolution of his career provide a rich opportunity for understanding the twentieth century. From his naturalist short stories to his modern (or even postmodern) novel Ulysses, Joyce offers an opportunity to survey the evolution of narrative style in the twentieth century. Ulysses poses questions at the center of our understanding of literature: about the relationship between literature, difficulty, and popular culture; about how narrative represents consciousness and interiority; about how literary form captures—or fails to capture—experience; and about how literary value relates to obscenity and provocation. Joyce’s work also opens onto questions broader than literature, concerning imperialism, Irish history, and the representation of gender. Assignments likely include short written assignments, research into Joyce’s context and background, and two major essays.\n\nETS 351 M002 Reading Nation and Empire before 1900: Writing Native America in Early American Literature\n\nTuTh 9:30-10:50 am\n\nInstructor: Scott Stevens\n\nFrom captivity narratives, such as Mary Rowlandson’s, to the novels of James Fennimore Cooper, the figure of the “American Indian” in early American literature has had a lasting legacy in American culture. But how did Native writers represent themselves and their respective cultures and where does their writing fit within the larger framework of American literature? This course will read the works of key early American writers comparatively with such Native American authors as Samson Occom, William Apess, Jane Schoolcraft, Blackhawk, and Yellow Bird (aka John Rollins Ridge) in order to develop a more nuanced and balanced sense of early Native American letters. Recent critical readings by scholars such as Nancy Armstrong, Maureen Konkle, Gordon Sayre, Robert Warrior, and Jace Weaver, among others, will supplement our readings. Meets with NAT 400.\n\nETS 351 M003 Reading Nation and Empire Before 1900: The Literature of Revolution\n\nMW 3:45-5:05 pm\n\nInstructor: Patricia Roylance\n\nThis course will examine the literature and ideology of revolution in the United States and beyond. In defiance of Britain’s imperialist control, the colonies that became the United States of America struggled to unify, win their independence and form a new nation. We will read participants’ speeches, personal letters, pamphlets and declarations to analyze how this process took place through language. We will also read accounts of the Revolution and its ideals produced in later eras, including fiction by Irving, Cooper and Hawthorne and political statements from other revolutions around the world attempting to cite the U.S. Revolution as a precedent. In an interesting twist, the United States itself became the target of a serious attempt at revolution by the Southern states in the Civil War, in which the Union faced the challenge of subduing a rebellion presenting itself as the present incarnation of the “Spirit of ’76.” In this course, we will track, among other issues, how the same rhetoric of revolution is used to cast the United States first as the rebel and then as the tyrant a mere 85 years later.\n\nETS 352 M001 Race, Nation, Empire: Postcoloniality and the Global\n\nMW 12:45-2:05pm\n\nInstructor: Chris Eng\n\nWhat makes a world? Popular discourses celebrate globalization as a contemporary phenomenon characterized by connectivity, access, and diversity. Yet, the proliferation of borders—geographical, legal, and symbolic—radically trouble these idealistic accounts of inclusivity and progress. This course grapples with global literatures to explore the dark underside of globalization, minding the unevenness and violences of its histories and structures. Particularly, we will work through a set of literary and theoretical texts—by scholar-writers such as Michelle Cliff, J. M. Coetzee, Frantz Fanon, Edward Said, and Karen Tei Yamashita—to investigate the role of literature and literary criticism in reproducing, complicating, and transforming the very conditions of the “global.” Following the routes and historical legacies of colonialism and postcoloniality that structure the modern world, our participation in larger academic conversations will be guided by the following inquiries: How do literary and cultural productions not only reflect, but also produce and uphold the very contours of globalization? What are the assumptions and values ascribed when we label a text as part of, or not part of, a “national literature” or “world literature”? How can we perform readings that attend to a literary text’s relationship to power dynamics and the world?\n\nETS 353 M001 Race, Nation & Empire before 1900: Jews and Judaism in the Renaissance Imagination\n\nTuTh 11:00am-12:20pm\n\nInstructor: Stephanie Shirilan\n\nThe expulsion of the Jews from England in 1290 meant that Jews were at least officially not to be found in Shakespeare’s England. Traditional historiographies have emphasized the alienation of Jews from the centers of Christian life and have largely studied representations of Jews in Renaissance literature as specimens of fantasy and conjecture from an impassable distance. Recent scholarship has, however, uncovered growing evidence of more substantive exchanges between Jews and Christians. Such encounters took place mainly on the Continent but were described in literature that circulated across Europe. We will consider these developments as we read from a selection of canonical literary depictions of Jews and Judaism (Chaucer, Nashe, Shakespeare, and Marlowe) and from the literature of travel, policy, science, and theology in which Jews or Conversos and Jewish texts figure prominently in representation or in the conditions of their production and reception. Discussion will situate both sets of texts in the contexts of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation and in relation to the rise and fall of Empire (English, Spanish, Ottoman), urbanization, mercantile and capitalist economic development, and colonial expansion.\n\nETS 353 Race, Nation & Empire before 1900: American Captivities – Race, Gender, and Nation in the New World\n\nTuTh 12:30-1:50pm\n\nInstructor: Dorri Beam\n\nThis course considers the captivity narrative as a recurring form in American literature and asks why it should be so prevalent in a “land of freedom.” We’ll expand this genre beyond its traditional focus on Puritan captivity (in which colonial settlers recounted being captured and forced to live with Native Americans) to the stories of captured Africans, Native Americans, and women. We will use the genre to examine issues of cultural contact and containment, freedom and imprisonment, and national inclusion and exclusion in early American literature.\n\nAfter studying the iconic captivity stories of Captain John Smith and Pocahontas, Mary Rowlandson, and Spanish conquistador Cabeza de Vaca, we turn to captivity as a leitmotif in African American literature, from slave narratives such as Solomon Northup’s Twelve Years a Slave to Nat Turner’s Confessions to John Edgar Wideman’s powerful contemporary account of his brother’s imprisonment. We’ll explore Native American experiences of captivity in the work of Leslie Marmon Silko, Zitkala Sa, and ledger art by Plains Indians. We’ll watch several filmic adaptations of the captivity genre, including John Ford’s classic Western, The Searchers, Terrence Malick’s The New World, Steve McQueen’s 12 Years a Slave, and Quentin Tarantino’s Django Unchained. Throughout, we’ll ask how, as students of American literature, we should understand our own captivation by and contact with the American captivity narrative.\n\nETS360 M003 Reading Gender & Sexualities: Queering Documentary\n\nMW 5:15-6:35pm\n\nScreening W 7:00pm\n\nInstructor: Roger Hallas\n\nDocumentary representation has been central to the emergence and development of modern sexual identities. For instance, 19th century science turned to both photographic portraiture and written case studies in order to name and define homosexuality as a specific sexual identity. But forms of documentation have not only been used to discipline and pathologize queer sexual acts and identities. Queer subcultures, social movements and individual artists have also embraced the desire to document — but in the service of cultural expression, sexual liberation and collective memory. This course explores how different documentary genres (such as case studies, ethnographies, oral histories, historical narratives, testimonies, activist videos, portraits and [auto]biographies) in various media (film, video, photography, graphic art and literature) have become fundamental tools in the historical struggle over sexual rights across the globe. Attendance at weekly film screening required. This course counts toward the Film and Screen Studies track and the LGBT Studies minor. Crosslisted with WGS360/QSX300\n\nETS 360 M004 Reading Gender & Sexualities: Feminist Fictions\n\nTuTh 12:30-1:50pm\n\nInstructor: Coran Klaver\n\nThis course will explore the history of Anglo-American feminism through the novels that figured the social, cultural, and theoretical issues facing feminist thinkers and activists alongside their political writings and actions. These novels reveal the strengths and limits of Anglo-American feminist thought at key moments in the development the feminist movements, exploring the way that feminist frameworks at specific moments fueled certain changes, even while reinforcing the status quo in in other ways, as well as the way they created possibilities for some women, even as excluding others from their liberatory promises. The course will begin with Maria Wollstonecraft’s novel, Maria, or The Wrongs of Women and include novels such as Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre, Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, Kate Chopin’s The Awakening, George Gissings, The Odd Women, Jean Rhys’s Wide Sargasso Sea, Doris Lessing’s The Golden Notebook, Jeanette Winterson’s Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit, Erica Jong’s Fear of Flying; Zora Neale Hurston’s Their Eyes Were Watching God, Marge Piercy’s Woman On the Edge of Time, Toni Morrison’s Paradise, Margaret Atwood’s The Lady Oracle, and Chimananda Ngozi Adichie’s Americanah. We will read short selections of nonfictional feminist writing from the periods alongside these novels. Students will be responsible for oral presentations on the history of feminism concurrent with the writing of these novels, two formal essays, and one creative engagement with today’s contemporary feminist moment.\n\nETS 400 M001 Selected Topics: The Mysteries of London\n\nTuTh 3:30-4:50 pm\n\nInstructor: Mike Goode\n\nThis course examines nineteenth-century crime and mystery literature about London, as well as contemporary novelists’, graphic novelists’, tourists’, and filmmakers’ fascination with this literature and with Victorian London. The course is a regular semester-long course taught on the Syracuse University campus, but students must also participate over spring break in an Syracuse Abroad short-term program involving eight days of on-site study in London with the professor. Texts covered will include Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist, Mary Elizabeth Braddon’s Lady Audley’s Secret, Bram Stoker’s Dracula, Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, Sarah Waters’s Fingersmith, and Alan Moore and Eddie Campell’s From Hell. Assignments will consist of a 5-page paper, a 10-page paper, reading quizzes, and a 20-minute presentation to be given during the spring break trip portion of the course. The course is capped at 20 students and admission is by application only. Applications were due at Syracuse Abroad on October 15, 2018.\n\nETS 401 M003 Advanced Poetry Workshop\n\nTu 3:30-6:20pm\n\nInstructor: Brooks Haxton\n\nThe purpose of this course is to develop the skills needed to make poems vivid and accessible for readers. In discussion and written comments on each other’s work students use their imagination and intelligence to help each other accomplish this difficult task. Everyone writes one new poem each week, some in response to assignments, and then revises four of these into carefully considered form. Requirements include reading, written analysis of poems, and memorization. The course is open to anyone who has taken the introductory workshop. Juniors and seniors who have not had a workshop may submit a portfolio of ten pages of original poetry to be considered for admission.\n\nETS 403 M002 Advanced Fiction Workshop\n\nInstructor: Arthur Flowers\n\nFiction Workshop. Craft. Production. Basic workshop format, 2 reader critiques a session plus assigned reading.\n\nETS 407 Advanced Critical Writing: The Natural and Supernatural in Medieval Literature\n\nTuTh 11:00am-12:20pm\n\nInstructor: Patricia Moody\n\nThis topic allows us to explore the various and complex ways in which medieval persons understood both the natural and the supernatural or “fantastic.” Historian Robert Bartlett offers the caveat that the belief systems of the Middle Ages were no more coherent than our own, but rather reflect overlapping zones of intellectual debate, difference, and even \"discomfort.\" This literature course investigates the aesthetic-fictional structures and properties of supernatural figures, states, and worlds, and how the \"natural\" and \"supernatural\" inform each other. Theoretical texts (Freud and Todorov for example) will help us reflect upon the psychological, philosophical, cultural, social, political and other uses of the supernatural and why and how they have endured over time. We will also venture into some contemporary works, such as Tolkien and modern works such as Neil Gaiman's novel Neverwhere (1996), the film Pan’s Labyrinth and portions of historian Scott Poole's book Monsters in America: Our Historical Obsession with the Hideous and Haunting (2011). This Advanced Critical Writing course will help you to hone your research and writing skills and engage in deep and sustained critical inquiry. This course can be used in place of ETS 305.\n\nETS 411 Forms & Genres Before 1900: Reading, Breathing Shakespeare\n\nTuTh 2:00-3:20pm\n\nInstructor: Stephanie Shirilan\n\nActing and voice coaches have written extensively about breathing Shakespeare’s language, finding its poetry and the power of its rhythms in the “breath” of the line. What does this mean for students of literature? We will read from acting and voice pedagogy alongside classical rhetorical/oratorical treatises (that Shakespeare most certainly studied in grammar school) in order to consider what a focus on reading and breathing affords the literary, historical, and theoretical study of Shakespeare. How does reading aloud change our relationship to the plays in performance, in “private” reading, in the classroom, and in the “archive”? What becomes clearer and more accessible? What becomes more opaque and difficult? How might we observe Shakespeare’s experience as an actor in the attention he gives to the management of the breath both structurally and thematically? We will read fewer plays slowly so as to experiment with reading and performance techniques together in and outside of class. We will make at least one trip to the theater and will view a variety of adaptations and filmed productions. Non-traditional, pedagogical and performance-based, para-academic assignment options will be available for all students but may be customized to enhance the experiences of VPA/Drama and Education Majors.\n\nETS 420 M001 Cultural Production & Reception: The Hollywood Star System\n\nMW 3:45-5:05 pm\n\nScreening W 7:00pm\n\nInstructor: Will Scheibel\n\nIdols of the screen, models of style and politics, brand identities, and icons of popular culture, Hollywood stars continue to fascinate us as moviegoers. Identification in cinema is not the exclusive domain of the camera, but involves a relationship we share with characters, actors, and star personas. To that end, acting is not the function of scripted plot, nor is charisma a “natural” state of being; each requires critical analysis to understand the labor of artistic subjects and the roles of fan discourse, journalism, and the trade press in determining a career in the entertainment industry. In this course, we will learn the techniques and traditions from which an actor draws, the relationships between an actor and other elements of a film’s mise-en-scène, and how an actor becomes a star through the machinery of promotion, publicity, criticism, and commentary. We will look specifically at famous cases from the Classical Hollywood era, between the late-1920s and the early-1960s, the period in which actors worked under long-term contracts at studios that manufactured their images to be admired, even desired, by the public. The phenomenon of Hollywood stardom remains alive and well, and the story of contemporary celebrity culture begins here.\n\nETS 420 M002 Cultural Production & Reception: Esports & Games in Culture\n\nMW 2:15-3:35\n\nInstructor: Chris Hanson\n\nVideo games have rapidly become a leading contributor to global media culture, rivaling other media industries such as film and television. Esports have more recently become a significant part of this discussion, transforming video game competition into a globalized commodity and entertainment industry. This course will examine how esports and games function in culture, looking at U.S. and global historical contexts. We will explore a range of cultural topics in games and esports, such as fan communities; the function of gender, ethnicity, and identity through multiple registers; industrial practices; the professionalization of play; and the relationships between digital games, esports, and analog games and sports. In addition to a variety of digital and analog games, we will also study relevant screen-based media texts which explicitly or implicitly engage with the key aspects of the histories and cultures of esports and games.\n\nETS 421 M001 Cultural Production & Reception Before 1900: Medieval Masterpieces\n\nTuTh 2:00-3:20 pm\n\nInstructor: Patricia Moody\n\nIn Europe, from about the time of the fall of the Roman empire in the fifth century to roughly the end of the Hundred Years’ War in 1453, the period called “medieval” was marked by war, plague, famine, crop failures, and crusades; it was also a period remarkable for its advances in science, technology, architecture, literature, and the arts. This course examines selected masterpieces of the medieval era across cultures, from Beowulf and Boethius to the Chanson de Roland, Dante and Chaucer. Literary texts will be examined alongside other cultural masterpieces such as illuminated manuscripts, tapestries, chant, and cathedrals.\n\nETS 421 Cultural Production & Reception Before 1900: Christopher Columbus\n\nMW 2:15-3:35 pm\n\nSilvio Torres-Saillant\n\n“Christopher Columbus” cover the cultural history of a Genoese mariner who in 1492, sailing under the flag of Catholic Spain, arrived in the Caribbean, never got close to the US mainland, yet became an unchallenged symbol of US patriotism. In the 18th century, while the US founders proudly vaunted their Protestant English stock, the Admiral became memorialized in the name of the US capital, “District of Columbia.” Subsequently, the adventurer who opened the Americas for conquest by the Spanish Empire began to lend his name to US cities, government buildings, rivers, and universities, with Columbus Circle monuments spreading throughout the country. Today the name of the Genoese appears on more US natural sites or parts of the built space than that of any of the Founding Fathers, including George Washington. We will read Washington Irving, Joel Barlow, Wilhanan Winchester, and several other key contributors to the US adoption of Columbus as an icon American patriotism. The class will consider questions pertaining to the construction of public memory and its consequences.\n\nETS 495 Thesis Writing Workshop\n\nTh 3:30-6:15 pm\n\nInstructor: Crystal Bartolovich\n\nThis course is a continuation of ETS 494. It is intended to serve as a forum for small-group mentoring and directed research toward producing an ETS Distinction Essay or Honors Thesis. Enrollment requires successful completion of ETS 494 (or equivalent) and is by instructor permission only.\n\nFall 2018\n\nLower Division Courses\n\nETS 105 M001: Introduction to Creative Writing\n\nTuTh 12:30-1:50pm\n\nI"
