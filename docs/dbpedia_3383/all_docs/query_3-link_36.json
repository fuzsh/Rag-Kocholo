My writing interests include gender in Esports, Twitch streaming the intersection between film theory and game cinematics and East Asian game studies. I worked as a community and project manager with the Collegiate Star League and eSports Canada.\n\nI am also formerly the Editor-in-Chief for FirstPersonScholar.com, a middle-state game studies publication.\n\nThis website hosts my academic and informal writing, conference experiences and other, informal commentaries on the games industry. I also like writing about South Korean pop culture, Disney and film. A lot of what I write about on this blog are feeler ideas for further research, please feel free to engage with me through email or the comments section.\n\nAll work is my own, please do not steal it."
