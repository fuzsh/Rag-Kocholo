        "text": "Last updated on May 28, 2024\n\n*Companies marked with (*) are included in our divestment list. The list below is not intended to be used as either a divestment list or a boycott list, as it includes many privately-owned companies as well as companies with a very minor or one-time involvement.\n\nSince October, 2023, Israel has waged unprecedented aerial and ground attacks on Gaza after Hamas-led attacks on Israel. Tens of thousands of Palestinians in Gaza have been killed at a historic pace, mostly unarmed civilians, and most of the Gaza population has been displaced. These attacks may amount to a genocide, according to a preliminary ruling by the International Court of Justice, a U.S. federal court, as well as dozens of U.N. experts and legal scholars. Israel's attacks in Gaza have been accompanied by a surge of Israeli violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, clashes between the Israeli military and militant groups in Lebanon, and Israeli aerial strikes in Syria.\n\nShortly after Oct. 7, the U.S. government started transferring massive amounts of weapons to Israel. By Dec. 25, Israel received more than 10,000 tons of weapons in 244 cargo planes and 20 ships from the U.S. These transfers included more than 15,000 bombs and 50,000 artillery shells within just the first month and a half. These transfers have been deliberately shrouded in secrecy to avoid public scrutiny and prevent Congress from exercising any meaningful oversight. Between October and the beginning of March, the U.S. approved more than 100 military sales to Israel, but publicly disclosed only two sales. A list of known U.S. arms transfers is maintained by the Forum on the Arms Trade.\n\nMuch of these weapons were purchased using U.S. taxpayers’ money through the Foreign Military Sales program, while some were direct commercial sales purchased through Israel’s own budget. An undisclosed amount of weapons was also transferred from U.S. military stockpiles already stored in Israel, known as War Reserves Stock Allies-Israel (WRSA-I). The use of WRSA-I to provide Israel with weapons serves to further obfuscate the full picture of U.S. arms transfers, as there is no public record of these stockpiles' inventory.\n\nThe scale of destruction and war crimes in Gaza would not be possible without this continued flow of weapons from the U.S. Despite massive public protests, the Biden administration has been working to give Israel over $14 billion to buy more weapons. This is on top of the $3.8 billion the U.S. already gives to the Israeli military annually. Israel is required to use this money to buy U.S.-made weapons. This is a form of corporate welfare not only for the largest weapons manufacturers, like Lockheed Martin, RTX, Boeing, and General Dynamics, which have seen their stock prices skyrocket, but also for companies that are not typically seen as part of the weapons industry, such as Caterpillar, Ford, and Toyota (see below).\n\nAs a Quaker organization with a long history of work in Palestine and Israel, including in Gaza, AFSC supports a full arms embargo to both Israeli and Palestinian militant groups. This list focuses on weapons used by Israel because all Palestinian militant groups are already sanctioned and receive no support from Western governments or corporations.\n\nThis research relies on media sources, social media, and other open sources. Information was also collected by Who Profits and the Database of Israeli Military and Security Export. a project of the Israeli organization New Profile. We welcome any additional information, please contact us.\n\nFor decades, Caterpillar has been supplying Israel with the D9 armored bulldozer, which the Israeli military routinely uses to demolish Palestinian homes and civilian infrastructure in the occupied West Bank and to enforce the blockade of the Gaza Strip.\n\nArmored D9 bulldozers have been crucial for Israel's ground invasion of the Gaza Strip, accompanying combat troops and paving their way by clearing roads and demolishing buildings.\n\nD9 bulldozers were also used in raids of Palestinian cities in the occupied West Bank, including Jenin and Tulkarem, where a bulldozer was used to destroy a memorial to former Palestinian president Yasser Arafat. Deliberate destruction of cultural heritage sites during an armed conflict can constitute a war crime.\n\nSince December, Caterpillar D9 bulldozers and other heavy equipment have been systematically destroying civilian buildings and other property alongside the Gaza Strip border, creating a half-a-mile-wide “buffer zone\" over roughly 16% of the Strip's area. According to the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, “extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, amounts to a grave breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention and a war crime.”\n\nOn Dec. 16, Israeli bulldozers were reportedly \"running over and crushing displaced people inside their tents in Beit Lahia’s Kamal Adwan Hospital courtyard,\" killing several people in the process.\n\nIn February, Caterpillar bulldozers and other heavy machinery participated in building a new road that runs across the Gaza Strip from east to west, designed to facilitate Israeli long-term \"logistical and military control in the region.\"\n\nOn Mar. 28, a military bulldozer, likely made by Caterpillar, was captured on video dragging and burying in the sand two bodies of Palestinian men, who were shot dead by Israeli soldiers. Before they were killed, the men appeared unarmed, and at least one of them was seen repeatedly waving “what appeared to be white fabric.”\n\nIsrael placed an urgent order for dozens of additional D9 armored bulldozers after Oct. 7.\n\nSome of Israel's D9T bulldozers have been converted into remote-controlled or semi-autonomous vehicles so that they can operate without a driver in \"complex,\" \"high-risk areas.\" In November, Israel Aerospace Industries, the company that converts the bulldozers, modified more units for the Israeli military for its operations in Gaza.\n\nFor more information on this company (not including these latest developments), see our company profile on the Investigate database.\n\nA privately owned munitions manufacturer headquartered in Philadelphia. It operates the Iowa Army Ammunition Plant (IAAP), which has been the source of much of the artillery munitions used by the Israeli military, including 155mm rounds, fired by Israel's M109 howitzer guns, and 120mm M830A1 High Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) rounds, fired by Israel's Merkava battle tanks.\n\nThe factory has been operated by Mason & Hanger since 1951. Between 1998-2007, it was operated by American Ordnance, a joint venture of Mason & Hanger and General Dynamics. Day & Zimmermann acquired Mason & Hanger in 1999, and in 2007 acquired General Dynamics' stake in American Ordnance.\n\nIn November, Israeli tanks fired M830A1 rounds as part of their attack on a U.N. school in Gaza. The serial number on one of the rounds suggests that it was made at IAAP by Mason & Hanger in December 1990.\n\nOn January 29, Israeli tanks fired M830A1 rounds as part of their attack that killed 6-year-old Hind Rajab, her six family members, and the medics that attempted to rescue her, in the Gaza neighborhood of Tel al-Hawa. The serial number on an exploded round found inside the ambulance suggests that it was made at IAAP by Mason & Hanger in November 1996.\n\nIn December, the U.S. government used emergency measures to approve sending Israel an estimated number of 14,000 M830A1 tank rounds, without congressional review. The transfer, from the existing inventory of the U.S. Army, is worth $106.5 million, funded by U.S. taxpayer's money.\n\nDay & Zimmermann's factory in Texarkana, Texas, is the current supplier of M830A1 rounds for the U.S. Army. Between 2017-2021, the U.S. Army's supplier of these munitions was a Northrop Grumman factory in Plymouth, Minnesota.\n\nIsrael’s largest weapons manufacturer, Elbit Systems is one of the primary suppliers of weapons and surveillance systems to the Israeli military, including Skylark and Hermes military UAV drones, which form the majority of Israel’s fleet of large drones and have been used extensively in Gaza.\n\nElbit-made MPR 500 multi-purpose bombs are being used by Israel in its attacks on the Gaza Strip. Designed for use in \"densely populated urban warfare,\" these bombs contain 26,000 controlled fragments for \"high kill probability.\" Elbit says that these 500-pound bombs are as powerful as U.S.-made 2,000-pound MK-84 bombs. They can be converted into guided bombs using kits such as the Boeing (see above) Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM).\n\nElbit Systems’ killer Hermes 450 and 900 drones have been used extensively in attacks on and surveillance missions in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, and Lebanon.\n\nOn April 1, a Hermes 450 drone attacked three vehicles of the humanitarian organization World Central Kitchen near Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. The attack resulted in the killing of seven aid workers who were managing food shipments. They were from Palestine, Australia, Poland, the U.K., and a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada. The Hermes 450 can carry four air-to-ground Spike missiles, made by Israeli company Rafael, although some sources claim that it can also carry Hellfire missiles, made by Lockheed Martin in the U.S. The damage from this attack is consistent with Spike missiles.\n\nElbit's Head-Mounted Display helmet technology is integrated into the Israeli Air Force's fighter jets and helicopters as well as the military's Merkava 5 (Barak) battle tank. The company is also a subcontractor of Lockheed Martin; it integrates its helmet technology into F-35 fighter jets worldwide.\n\nIt also supplies the Israeli military with 155mm artillery shells and many other weapons systems and technologies.\n\nElbit Systems spearheaded the technological aspects of the “smart” border wall surrounding the Gaza Strip, which failed on Oct. 7. It is also a prime contractor for the militarization of the U.S.– Mexico border.\n\nOn Oct. 13, the Israeli military fired 120mm tank rounds at journalists in south Lebanon, killing Reuters journalist Issam Abdallah and injuring six others in what could amount to a war crime. The munitions used were most likely M339 rounds made by Elbit Systems, according to Amnesty International.\n\nThe company, headquartered in Israel, has a large U.S. presence, with facilities in Alabama (Talladega), Florida (Boca Raton and De Leon Springs), Massachusetts (Cambridge), New Hampshire (Merrimack), Pennsylvania (Birdsboro), South Carolina (Ladson), Virginia (Reston and Roanoke), and Texas (Fort Worth and San Antonio).\n\nFor more information on this company (not including these latest developments), see our company profile on the Investigate database.\n\nThe world's sixth largest weapons manufacturer, General Dynamics, supplies Israel with artillery ammunition and bombs for attack jets used in Israel’s assault on Gaza.\n\nThe company developed the F-16 fighter jet, although it has been manufactured by Lockheed Martin since 1993.\n\nGeneral Dynamics is the only company in the U.S. that makes the metal bodies for the MK-80 bomb series, one of the primary aerial munitions Israel has used to bomb Gaza. The Israeli Air Force extensively uses 500-pound MK-82/BLU-111 bombs, 1,000-pound MK-83/BLU-110 bomb, and 2,000-lbs MK-84/BLU-109 bomb. Different designations (MK vs. BLU) indicate a different explosive filling. When converted into guided munitions using Boeing's JDAM kits (see above), these bombs' designation changes to GBU-38 (500 pounds), GBU-32 (1,000 pounds) or GBU-31 (2,000 pounds).\n\nThe largest of this bomb series, the 2,000-pound MK-84/BLU-109/GBU-31 bomb, is notorious for the damage it creates, and cannot be used in densely-populated urban areas without causing massive civilian casualties. The explosion of a 2,000-pound bomb means \"instant death\" for people within 100 feet, with lethal fragments extending for up to 1,200 feet. According to a CNN analysis, Israel dropped more than 500 such bombs in the Northern Gaza Strip until Nov. 6. These include, for example, the Nov. 1 bombing of Jabalia refugee camp, which killed hundreds of Palestinian civilians and could amount to a war crime, according to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis, by mid-November, Israel dropped over 208 2,000-pound bombs on the Southern Gaza Strip, in areas \"where Israel had ordered civilians to move for safety.\" This includes, for example, an Oct. 10 bombing that killed 24 people of the al-Najjar family and potentially an Oct. 22 bombing that killed 19 people of the Abu Mu'eileq, both in Deir al-Balah. Amnesty International called both attacks unlawful air strikes on homes full of civilians \"that could amount to a war crime.\"\n\nBetween Oct. 7 and Dec. 21, the U.S. reportedly sent Israel more than 5,000 MK-84 bombs. On March 29, it was reported that the U.S. had \"quietly authorized\" fulfilling a number of older Israeli munitions orders, including more than 1,800 MK84 2,000-pound bombs and 500 MK82 500-pound bombs. In early May, the U.S. government reportedly decided to hold up this shipment to pressure Israel not to conduct a attack on Rafah.\n\nGeneral Dynamics is also the only company in the U.S. that makes 155mm caliber artillery shells, which have been used extensively to attack Gaza. One source reported that, by Nov. 25, one Israeli brigade fired some 10,000 such shells using BAE’s M109 howitzer.\n\n155mm shells have been part of the U.S.’s recent weapons shipments to Israel. The U.S. is planning to send “tens of thousands of 155mm artillery shells that had been destined for Ukraine” to Israel. Their use by Israel, according to Oxfam, is “virtually assured to be indiscriminate, unlawful, and devastating to civilians in Gaza.” On Nov. 13, more than 30 organizations issued a letter opposing the transfer.\n\nGeneral Dynamics also partnered with Flyer Defense (see above) to develop an armored patrol vehicle that Israel is testing.\n\nOn an Oct. 25 call with investors, General Dynamics CFO, Jason Aiken, said, “I think if you look at the incremental demand potential coming out of [the attacks on Gaza], the biggest one to highlight and that really sticks out is probably on the artillery side.”\n\nGeneral Dynamics is based outside of Washington, D.C., in Fairfax, Virginia. For more locations, see this map.\n\nFor more information on this company (not including these latest developments), see our company profile on the Investigate database.\n\nThe Israeli military reportedly uses Google Photos facial recognition feature as part of its mass surveillance of Palestinians in Gaza. According to The New York Times, \"By uploading a database of known persons to Google Photos, Israeli officers could use the service’s photo search function to identify people.\" One Israeli military officer told the New York Times that Google’s ability to match faces and identify people \"was superior to other technology,\" including a technology developed by Israeli company Corsight (see above) specifically for the needs of the Israeli military.\n\nAs pointed out by The Intercept, the Israeli military's usage violates Google own policies, which forbid using Google Photos \"to promote activities (...) that cause serious and immediate harm to people or animals.\" Google refused to comment on how it applies this policy with regard to the Israeli military.\n\nIn addition, since 2021, Google Cloud Platform has been developing cloud infrastructure for the Israeli government under Project Nimbus, one of the largest technology projects in Israel’s history. Alongside Amazon Web Services, which is also part of the project, Google's cloud computing services will eventually be used by all branches and units of the Israeli government, including its military, security agency (\"Shin Bet\"), police, prison service, land and water authorities, the two large state-owned weapons manufacturers: Israeli aerospace Industries and Rafael (see both below), and other government entities that administer Israel’s policies of apartheid and persecution.\n\nResponding to mounting public pressure, Google repeatedly stated that its work for Israel \"is not directed at highly sensitive or classified military workloads relevant to weapons or intelligence services.\" However, the Israeli Ministry of Defense played an integral role in the tender process and reportedly rejected Oracle's bid because its system was not deemed secure enough for the military’s purposes. According to The Times, \"The Israeli Ministry of Defense (...) has its own 'landing zone' into Google Cloud—a secure entry point to Google-provided computing infrastructure, which would allow the ministry to store and process data, and access AI services.\"\n\nThe Times further reported that the Israeli Ministry of Defense signed a new contract with Google in March, 2024, for \"consulting assistance from Google to expand its Google Cloud access, seeking to allow “multiple units” to access automation technologies.\"\n\nFor more information on this company (not including these latest developments), see our company profile on the Investigate database.\n\nThe world’s largest weapons manufacturer, Lockheed Martin supplies Israel with F-16 and F-35 fighter jets, which Israel has been using extensively to bomb Gaza. Israel also uses the company’s C-130 Hercules transport planes to support the ground invasion of Gaza.\n\nLockheed Martin manufactures AGM-114 Hellfire missiles for Israel’s Apache helicopters. One of the main weapon types used in aerial attacks on Gaza, these missiles have been used extensively in 2023. Some 2,000 Hellfire missiles were delivered to Israel sometime between Oct. 7 and Nov. 14.\n\nLockheed Martin subsidiary Sikorsky manufactures the CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, used to transport Israeli soldiers into and out of Gaza. On Jan. 8, Sikorsky was awarded $18.3 million from U.S. taxpayers' money for continued work on the CH-53K aircraft it has provided to Israel.\n\nOn Dec. 28, Lockheed Martin was awarded a $10.5 million contract for continued support for Israel's fleet of F-35 warplanes.\n\nOn Dec. 11, the Israeli Air Force used a Lockheed Martin C-130-J Super Hercules aircraft to drop approximately seven tons of equipment to Israeli soldiers engaging in ground attacks in Khan Younis, located in the southern Gaza Strip. This was the \"first operational airdrop\" that Israel has carried out since the 2006 Lebanon War.\n\nOn Nov. 9, an Israeli missile hit journalists sitting near Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. The missile was reportedly a Lockheed Martin–made Hellfire R9X missile, a version of the Hellfire that was developed by the CIA for carrying out assassinations. Instead of exploding, the missile shreds its target using blades, allowing for a direct hit without collateral damage. The target in this case was not a military one.\n\nThe Israeli military also uses Lockheed Martin’s M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS). Used to fire Elbit Systems’ high-precision AccuLAR-122, the weapon was used by Israel for the first time, since the 2006 war in Lebanon, on Oct. 6, according to the Israeli military.\n\nOn an Oct. 17 call with investors, Lockheed Martin CEO, Jim Taiclet, “highlighted the Israel and Ukraine conflicts as potential drivers for increased revenue in the coming years.”\n\nLockheed Martin is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, and has key production sites in Denver, Houston, New Orleans, and San Diego. For more locations, see this map.\n\nFor more information on this company (not including these latest developments), see our company profile on the Investigate database.\n\nA large Israeli state-owned weapons manufacturer, Rafael Advanced Defense Systems makes missiles, drones, and other weapons systems for the Israeli military.\n\nThe Israeli military has used Rafael Spike Guided Missiles extensively to target, from the air and ground, people inside buildings in the Gaza Strip. The Spike missile family includes many configurations, including ground missiles for use by infantry soldiers and air-to-ground missiles that can be mounted on aircraft and drones.\n\nOn April 1, a Hermes 450 drone, made by Elbit Systems (see above) attacked three vehicles of the humanitarian organization World Central Kitchen near Deir al-Balah in the central Gaza Strip. The attack resulted in the killing of seven aid workers who were managing food shipments. They were from Palestine, Australia, Poland, the U.K., and a dual citizen of the U.S. and Canada. The Hermes 450 can carry four air-to-ground Spike missiles, and the damage from this attack is consistent with Spike missiles.\n\nThe Israeli military has also used the Matador (RGW 90) portable shoulder-fired anti-tank rocket in Gaza, specifically by infantry soldiers to destroy buildings from the ground. The rockets are made by German company Dynamit Nobel Defence (DND), a subsidiary of Rafael, and co-developed with the Singaporean government. In 2023, the German government approved the export of some $27 million worth of weapons to Israel, including 3,000 portable anti-tank weapons—presumably the Matador.\n\nThe Orbiter 4, Israel's newest killer drone, which was developed by Rafael subsidiary Aeronautics, was used operationally for the first time in Gaza on November 8.\n\nRafael's Trophy Active Protection System for armored vehicles enables Israeli battle tanks to go into Gaza and avoid being damaged by anti-tank weapons. The company markets the system as one that \"increases the lethality of combat forces.\"\n\nRafael collaborated with the Israeli military to develop the Spark, a new unmanned drone used to carry out intelligence missions, escort ground forces, and direct strikes. After first being received by the Israeli Air Force in September, Spark drones have reportedly been assisting Israeli combat teams in Gaza and acting as a \"force multiplier on the battlefield.\""
