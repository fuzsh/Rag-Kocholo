        "text": "The earliest western mention of the Kalinago (originally as ‘Caribs’) was in Christopher Columbus’s journal dated November 26, 1492 (Honychurch, 2012). Little is known about the detailed cultural and genetic similarities and differences between them and other Caribbean pre-contact groups such as the Taino. African admixture in the present Kalinago population derived from the African slave trade; despite inquiry across community, governmental, and historical sources, we were unable to find documentation of specific regions of origin in Africa or well-defined contributions from other groups. The population’s linguistics are uninformative, as they speak, in addition to English, the same French-based Antillean Creole spoken on the neighboring islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique.\n\nTo study Kalinago population structure, we analyzed an aggregate of our Kalinago SNP genotype data and HGDP data (Li et al., 2008) using ADMIXTURE (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1) as described in Materials and methods. At K=3, the ADMIXTURE result confirmed the three major clusters, corresponding roughly to Africans (black cluster), European/Middle Easterners/Central and South Asians (yellow cluster), and East Asians/Native Americans (green cluster). At K=4 and higher, the red component that predominates Native Americans separates the Kalinago from the East Asians (green cluster). Consistent with prior work (Li et al., 2008), a purple cluster (Oceanians) appears at K=5 and a brown cluster (Central and South Asians) appears at K=6; both are minor sources of genetic ancestry in our Kalinago sample (average <1%) (Appendix 1—table 2).\n\nFigure 1—source data 1\n\nThe source data contains results from Admixture analysis.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/77514/elife-77514-fig1-data1-v3.xlsx\n\nAt K=4 to K=6, the Kalinago show on average 55% Native American, 32% African, and 11–12% European genetic ancestry. Estimates from a two-stage admixture analysis are similar, as are results from local genetic ancestry analysis (see Materials and methods) (Appendix 1—table 3), leading to estimates of 54–56% Native American, 31–33% African, and 11–13% European genetic ancestry. The individual with the least admixture has approximately 94% Native American and 6% African genetic ancestry. The results of the principal component (PC) analysis (PCA) (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) were consistent with ADMIXTURE analysis. The first two PCs suggest that most Kalinago individuals show admixture between Native American and African genetic ancestry, with a smaller but highly variable European contribution apparent in the displacement in PC2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1). A smaller number of Kalinago individuals with substantial East Asian genetic ancestry exhibit displacement in PC3 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1).\n\nOur analysis of Kalinago genetic ancestry revealed considerably more Native American and less European genetic ancestry than the Caribbean samples of Benn Torres et al., 2013, and the admixed populations from the 1000 Genomes Project (1KGP) (Auton et al., 2015; Figure 2). Some Western Hemisphere Native Americans reported in Reich et al., 2012, have varying proportions of European but very little African admixture (Figure 2B). Overall, the Kalinago have more Native American and less European genetic ancestry than any other Caribbean population.\n\nFigure 2—source data 1\n\nSource data contains result from PCA analysis for Kalinago versus other Native American populations in the Western Hemisphere.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/77514/elife-77514-fig2-data1-v3.xlsx\n\nThe 55% Native American genetic ancestry calculated from autosomal genotype in the Kalinago is greater than the reported 13% in Puerto Rico (Gravel et al., 2013), 10–15% for Tainos across the Caribbean (Schroeder et al., 2018), and 8% for Cubans (Marcheco-Teruel et al., 2014). This is also considerably higher than the reported 6% Native American genetic ancestry found in Bwa Mawego, a horticultural population that resides south of the Kalinago Territory (Keith et al., 2021). However, this result is lower than the 67% Native American genetic ancestry reported by Crawford et al., 2021, for an independently collected Kalinago samples based on the mtDNA haplotype analysis. This difference suggests a paternal bias in combined European and/or African admixture. Since our Illumina SNP-chip genotyping does not yield reliable identification of mtDNA haplotypes, we are currently unable to compare maternal to autosomal genetic ancestry proportions for our sample. Samples genotyped using 105 genetic ancestry informative markers from Jamaica and the Lesser Antilles (Benn Torres et al., 2015) yielded an average of 7.7% Native American genetic ancestry (range 5.6%–16.2%), with the highest value from a population in Dominica sampled outside the Kalinago reservation. Relevant to the potential mapping of Native American light skin color alleles, the Kalinago population has among the lowest European genetic ancestry (12%) compared to other reported Caribbean Native Americans in St. Kitts (8.2%), Barbados (11.5%), and Puerto Rico (71%) (Benn Torres et al., 2013). Contributing to the high percentage of Native American genetic ancestry in the Kalinago is their segregation within the 3700 acre Kalinago Territory in Dominica granted by the British in 1903, and the Kalinago tradition that women marrying non-Kalinago are required to leave the Territory; non-Kalinago spouses of Kalinago men are allowed to move to the Territory (KCA, KCC, Personal Communication with Kalinago Council, 2014). These factors help to explain why samples collected outside the Kalinago Territory (Benn Torres et al., 2013) show lower fractional Native American genetic ancestry.\n\nDuring our fieldwork, it was noted that members of the Kalinago community characterized themselves and others in terms of perceived genealogical ancestry as ‘Black,’ ‘Kalinago,’ or ‘Mixed.’ Compared to individuals self-identified as ‘Mixed,’ those self-identified as ‘Kalinago’ have on average more Native American genetic ancestry (67% vs 51%), less European genetic ancestry (10% vs 14%), and less African genetic ancestry (23% vs 34%) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). Thus, these folk categories based on phenotype are reflected in some underlying differences in genetic ancestry.\n\nOCA is a genetically determined condition characterized by nystagmus, reduced visual acuity, foveal hypoplasia, and strabismus as well as hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and eye (Dessinioti et al., 2009; van Geel et al., 2013). The three sampled albino individuals had pale skin (MI 20.7, 22.4, and 23.8 vs. 29–80 for non-albino individuals), showed nystagmus, and reported photophobia and high susceptibility to sunburn. In contrast to the brown irides and black hair of most Kalinago, including their parents, the albino individuals had blonde hair and gray irides with varying amounts of green and blue.\n\nTo identify the albinism variant in the Kalinago, we first determined that none of the albino individuals carried any of 28 mutations previously found in African or Native American albino individuals (Carrasco et al., 2009; King et al., 2003; Stevens et al., 1997; Yi et al., 2003), including a 2.7 kb exon 7 deletion in OCA2 found at high frequency in some African populations. Whole exome sequencing of one albino individual and one parent (obligate carrier) revealed polymorphisms homozygous in the albino individuals and heterozygous in the parent, an initial approach that assumes that the albino individual was not a compound heterozygote. We identified 12 variant alleles in 7 OCA genes (or genomic regions) that met these criteria (summarized in Appendix 1—table 4). None were nonsense or splice site variants. Five of the twelve variants were intronic, one was synonymous, one was located in 5’UTR, and three were in the 3’UTR (Appendix 1—table 4). Two missense variants were found in OCA2: SNP rs1800401 (c.913C>T or p.Arg305Trp in exon 9), R305W, and multi-nucleotide polymorphism rs797044784 in exon 8 (c.819_822delCTGGinsGGTC; p.Asn273_Trp274delinsLysVal), NW273KV.\n\nAmong 458 Kalinago OCA2 genotypes, 26 carried NW273KV and 60 carried R305W (Table 1). Only NW273KV homozygotes were albino individual. We know that the allele responsible for albinism was NW273KV because neither of the two individuals, homozygous for R305W but not NW273KV, was albino individual. In further support of this conclusion is that one individual who was homozygous for R305W and homozygous ancestral for NW273 had an MI of 72, among the darkest in the entire population. R305W is notably present with frequency >0.10 in some African, South Asian, and European populations (Auton et al., 2015), predicting a Hardy-Weinberg frequency of homozygotes above 1%. This is far greater than the observed frequency of individuals with albinism and therefore inconsistent with the idea that this is not a variant responsible for albinism. The fact that R305W scores incorrectly as pathogenic using SIFT, Polyphen 2.0, and PANTHER that R305W (Kamaraj and Purohit, 2014) suggests a need for refinement of these methods. The universal association of R305W with the NW273KV haplotype indicates that the founder haplotype of the NW273KV albinism mutation carried the silent R305W variant.\n\nTable 1\n\nTo identify the origin of the albino allele, albino individuals and carriers were analyzed for regions exhibiting homozygosity, and identity-by-descent and local genetic ancestry was estimated (see Materials and methods). All three albino individuals share a homozygous segment of ~1.7 Mb that encompasses several genes in addition to OCA2 (Figure 3). The albino haplotype defined by homozygosity in individuals 2 and 3 extends ~11 Mb; comparison to local genetic ancestry shows that this haplotype is clearly of African origin.\n\nFigure 3\n\nThe Kalinago albino individuals are the only reported individuals where the albinism was caused by homozygosity for the NW273KV allele of OCA2. Two reported albino individuals of African-American/Dutch descent were compound heterozygotes for the OCA2 mutation, with one allele being the NW273KV variant chromosome (Garrison et al., 2004; Lee et al., 1994). Conservation of the NW sequence among vertebrates and its inclusion in a potential N-linked glycosylation site (Rinchik et al., 1993) that is eliminated by the mutation supports the variant’s pathogenicity. The NW273KV frequency in our sample (0.03) translates into a Hardy-Weinberg albinism frequency (p2=0.0009) of ~1 per 1000, as observed (3 in a population of about 3000). Examination of publicly available data reveals three OCA2NW273KV heterozygotes in the 1000 Genome Project, a pair of siblings from Barbados (ACB) and one individual from Sierra Leone (MSL). The three 1KGP individuals share a haplotype of ~1.5 Mb, of which ~1.0 Mb matches the albino haplotype in the Kalinago. The phasing for the OCA2NW273KV variant in the public data is inconsistent, with the variant assigned to the wrong chromosome for the ACB siblings.\n\nOne motivation for undertaking this work was to characterize genetic contributions to skin pigmentation in a population with primarily Native American and African genetic ancestry, so that we could focus on the effect of Native American hypopigmenting alleles without interference from European alleles. The Kalinago population described here comprises the only population we are aware of that fits this genetic ancestry profile. To control for the effects of the major European pigmentation loci, all Kalinago samples were genotyped for SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F. The phenotypic effects of these variants and OCA2NW273KV are shown in Figure 4. Each variant decreases melanin pigmentation, with homozygotes being lighter than heterozygotes. The greatest effect is seen in the OCA2NW273KV homozygotes (the albino individuals), as previously noted. The frequencies of the derived alleles of SLC24A5A111T and SLC45A2L374F in the Kalinago sample are 0.14 and 0.06, respectively.\n\nFigure 4—source data 1\n\nThe source file contain melanin index distribution as function of community-described ancestry.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/77514/elife-77514-fig4-data1-v3.xlsx\n\nFigure 4—source data 2\n\nThe source data contains data of melanin indices according to genotype.\n\nhttps://cdn.elifesciences.org/articles/77514/elife-77514-fig4-data2-v3.xlsx\n\nThe markedly higher frequency of SLC24A5A111T compared to SLC45A2L374F is not explained solely by European admixture, given that most Europeans are nearly fixed for both alleles (Soejima and Koda, 2007). This deviation can be explained by the involvement of source populations that carry the SLC24A5A111T variant but not SLC45A2L374F. Although some sub-Saharan West African populations (the likeliest source of AFR genetic ancestry in the Kalinago) have negligible SLC24A5A111T frequencies, moderate frequencies are found in the Mende of Sierra Leone (MSL, allele frequency = 0.08) (Micheletti et al., 2020; Auton et al., 2015), while some West African populations such as Hausa and Mandinka who have allele frequencies of 0.11 and 0.15, respectively (Cheung et al., 2000; Rajeevan et al., 2012). Such African individuals carrying the SLC24A5A111T allele could potentially cause the observed frequencies by founder effect. In addition, the region of chromosome 5 containing SLC45A2 exhibits low European genetic ancestry (6.5%) that is consistent with low observed SLC45A2L374F frequency.\n\nIn order to investigate the potential effect of the SLC25A5A111T allele on the albinism phenotype, we also compared other pigmentation phenotypes such as the hair and eye colors for all albino individuals and carriers. One of the three Kalinago albino individuals was also heterozygous for SLC24A5A111T, but neither skin nor hair color for this individual was lighter than that of the other two albino individuals, who were homozygous for the ancestral allele at SLC24A5A111; this observation is consistent with epistasis of OCA2 hypopigmentation over that of SLC24A5A111T. Nine sampled non-albino individuals had combinations of hair that was reddish, yellowish, or blonde (n=6), skin with MI <30 (n=3), and gray, blue, green, or hazel irides (n=2); among these, six were heterozygous and one homozygous for SLC24A5A111T, and three were heterozygous for the albino variant. A precise understanding of the phenotypic effects of the combinations of these and other hypopigmenting alleles will require further study.\n\nThe strong dependence of pigmentation on Native American genetic ancestry is clarified by focusing on individuals lacking the hypopigmenting alleles SLC24A5A111T, SLC45A2L374F, and OCA2NW273KV (Figure 5). Although positive deviations from the best fit are apparent at both high and low Native American genetic ancestry, the trend toward lighter pigmentation as Native American genetic ancestry increases is clear. The net difference between African and Native American contributions to pigmentation appears likely to be bounded by the magnitudes of the slope vs NAM genetic ancestry (24 units) and the slope vs AFR genetic ancestry (29 units, not shown). The difference in melanin index value is expected to be explained by genetic variants that are highly differentiated between African and Native American populations.\n\nTo further investigate the contributions of genetic variation to skin color, we performed association analyses using an additive model for melanin index, conditioning on sex, genetic ancestry (using 10 PCs), and genotypes for SLC24A5A111T, SLC45A2L374F, and OCA2NW273KV. Assuming likely epistasis of albinism alleles over other hypopigmenting alleles, these analyses omitted the three albino individuals. Employing a linear regression model, we found that sex and all three genotyped polymorphisms were statistically significant (Table 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2). However, only SLC24A5A111T reaches genome-wide significance. PC1, which strongly correlated with Native American vs African genetic ancestry, exhibits the lowest p-value. Effect sizes were about –6 units (per allele) for SLC24A5A111T, –4 units for SLC45A2L374F, and –8 units for the first OCA2NW273KV allele.\n\nTable 2\n\nAdditional covariates were considered but not included in our standard model. Skin pigmentation exhibited a decreasing trend with age, but its contribution was not statistically significant (adjusted p-value = 0.08). Estimated effect sizes for significant covariates were little affected by the inclusion of age as a covariate (Appendix 1—table 5). Analysis of SNPs that were previously reported as relevant to pigmentation are shown in Appendix 2—table 1. The lowest (adjusted) p-value for this collection of variants is about 0.001, considerably larger than the p-values for the variants included as covariates in our standard model. Inclusion of the SNP of lowest p-value from each of the five regions containing BCN2, TYR, OCA2, MC1R, and OPRM1 only modestly altered effect sizes for the other covariates (Appendix 1—table 5).\n\nThe effect size for SLC24A5A111T measured here is consistent with previously reported results of –5 melanin units calculated from an African-American sample (Lamason et al., 2005; Norton et al., 2007) and –5.5 from admixed inhabitants of the Cape Verde islands (Beleza et al., 2013). Reported effect sizes for continental Africans are both higher and lower, –7.7 in Crawford et al., 2017, and –3.6 Martin et al., 2017b, while the estimated effect size in the CANDELA study (GWAS of combined admixed populations from Mexico, Brazil, Columbia, Chile, and Peru) (Adhikari et al., 2019) yielded an effect size about –3 melanin units.\n\nA significant effect of SLC45A2L374F on skin pigmentation reported for the African-American sample by Norton et al., 2007, and in the CANDELA study by Adhikari et al., 2019, but not for the African Caribbean sample by Norton et al., 2007. The 4 unit effect size of this allele in the Kalinago reported here is similar to the 5 unit effect reported by Norton et al., 2007. Beleza et al., 2013 reported significance for an SNP in strong linkage disequilibrium with SLC45A2L374F, which was itself not genotyped.\n\nOur estimate that a single OCA2NW273KV allele causes about –8 melanin units of skin lightening is the first reported population-based effect size measurement for any albinism allele. Although albinism is generally considered recessive, our population sample offered an opportunity to compare the effect size for the first and second alleles quantitatively. We applied the estimated parameters to the three albino individuals and found that they were lighter by an average of 10 uni nm, 05W homozygotes, when controlling for OCA2NW273KV status, OCA2R305W had no detectable effect on skin color (Appendix 2—table 1).\n\nTo identify novel SNPs that may contribute toward skin pigmentation in the Kalinago samples, we performed GWAS using linear regression and linear mixed models (LMMs). Estimated power for these analyses is shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1, and Q-Q plots are depicted in Figure 5—figure supplement 2. The LMM approaches exhibited less statistic inflation than linear regression, likely because they better accounted for closely related individuals. Although the lowest p-values from the LMM-based methods meet the conventional criterion of 5e-08 for genome-wide significance (Appendix 3—table 1), our interpretation is that none of these variants warrant further investigation. Low observed minor allele frequencies (<2%) are inconsistent with those expected for variants responsible for pigmentation differences between the African and Native American populations because the frequencies of alleles responsible for population differences are expected to be highly differentiated between these source populations.\n\nAdditional Native American hypopigmenting alleles of significant effect size remain to be identified. Previously characterized variants do not explain this difference. It is possible that multiple hypopigmenting variants of small effect sizes are together required to reach Native American and/or East Asian levels of hypopigmentation, individually having insufficient effect to detect in the Kalinago, given our power limitations. If this is the case, multiple variants are required to explain the observed net difference in pigmentation. Alternatively, if there are variants with large effect sizes, it appears likely that they were not genotyped and are poorly tagged by the genotyped SNPs. Additional work will be required to find hypopigmentation alleles of significant effect size that are responsible for the lighter color of Native Americans.\n\nBasic statistics, merges with other datasets, and association analysis by linear regression were performed using plink 1.9 (Chang et al., 2015; Purcell et al., 2007). Phasing and imputation, as well as analysis of regions of homozygosity by descent and identity by descent were performed with Beagle 4.1 (Browning and Browning, 2013; Browning and Browning, 2007), using 1KGP phased data (Auton et al., 2015) as reference.\n\nThe genotyped individuals were randomly partitioned into nine subsets of 50 or 51 individuals (n=50 subsets) in which no pair exhibited greater than second-order relationship (PI_HAT >0.25 using the --genome command in plink). Using the same criteria, a maximal subset of 184 individuals was also generated (n=184 subset).\n\nPCA was performed using the smartpca program (version 13050) in the eigensoft package (Price et al., 2006). For comparison to HGDP populations, Kalinago samples were projected onto PCs calculated for the HGDP samples alone. For use as covariates in association analyses, the n=184 subset was used to generate the PCA, and the remaining individuals were projected onto the same axes.\n\nAdmixture analysis was performed using the ADMIXTURE program (Alexander et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2011). Each of the nine n=50 Kalinago subsets was merged with the N=940 subset of HGDP data (Li et al., 2008; Rosenberg, 2006) for analysis (349,923 SNPs) and the outputs combined, averaging genetic ancestry proportions for the common HGDP individuals across runs. These results were used in figures. Separately, two-stage admixture analysis started with the averaged estimated allele frequencies and then employed the projection (--P) matrix outputs to estimate individual genetic ancestry for the combined Kalinago sample. Individual ancestries estimated using both methods, as well as those estimated from a thinned subset of 50,074 SNPs were in good agreement, consistent with standard errors estimated by bootstrap analysis, although sample-wide averages differed slightly. Cross-validation is enabled by adding the --cv to the ADMIXTURE command.\n\nFor association analyses we removed the three-albino individuals and excluded SNPs with minor allele frequency <0.01. For conventional association analysis by linear regression, the standard additive genetic model included sex, the first 10 PCs, and genotypes of rs1426654 (SLC24A5), rs16891982 (SLC45A2), and the albino variant rs797044784 (OCA2) as covariates (Supplementary file 4). LMM analysis was performed using the mlma module of GCTA (Yang et al., 2011) with the --mlma-no-preadj-covar flag to suppress calculation using residuals. Two genetic relatedness matrices (GRM) were used: a standard GRM calculated using GCTA’s --make-grm command and an ancestry-aware GRM calculated using relationships deduced by REAP (Thornton et al., 2012) that utilized the output of the two-stage admixture analysis. For linear regression only, p-values were adjusted for statistic inflation by genomic control using the lambda calculated from the median chi-square statistic.\n\nStatistical power was estimated by simulation, using a subset of genotyped SNPs. Starting with the 349,923 SNPs used for genetic ancestry analysis, the averaged P matrix from ADMIXTURE analysis at K=4 provided an initial estimate of allele frequencies in AFR and NAM ancestral populations; 10,233 SNPs exhibited differentiation of 0.7 or greater between these populations, a value chosen as a reasonable minimum population differentiation for causative variants. After removal of SNPs for which predicted Kalinago sample frequencies deviated by more than 0.1 from observed values and those with adjusted p<0.1, 8766 SNPs remained. Phenotypes were simulated by randomly selecting one of these SNPs and adding a defined effect size to the observed phenotype. Simulated datasets were then analyzed with plink using the standard genetic model.\n\nStatistical analysis of pigmentary effect of albinism involved fitting parameters to an additive model for the sample containing carriers but lacking albino individuals, applying the same model to the albino individuals, and comparing residuals for the albinos and the other individuals.\n\nLocal genetic ancestry analysis of the region containing the albinism allele was performed using the PopPhased version of rfmix (v1.5.4) with the default window size of 0.2 cM (Maples et al., 2013). A subset of 1KGP data served as reference haplotypes for European, African, and East Asian populations, and the Native American genetic ancestry segments of the admixed samples as determined by Martin et al., 2017a, were combined to generate synthetic Native American reference haplotypes. For estimates of individual genetic ancestry, Viterbi outputs for each window were averaged across all autosomes."
