        "text": "DEC. 12 â Fresh off the club's third MLS Cup title, Columbus look set to return most of their championship-winning group.\n\nThe only high-impact player who's in flux is wingback Julian Gressel, who's out of contract and becomes a free agent. The US international was acquired in a midseason trade from Vancouver, though wasn't always first choice under head coach Wilfried Nancy.\n\nWith all this roster stability, Crew fans will rightly dream of a repeat in 2024.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 12)\n\nMohamed Farsi (D)\n\nAlex Matan (M)\n\nKevin Molino (M)\n\nPhilip Quinton (D)\n\nWill Sands (D)\n\nPatrick Schulte (GK)\n\nSean Zawadzki (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 12)\n\nJimmy Medranda (D)\n\nJake Morris (D)\n\nIsaiah Parente (M)\n\nBrady Scott (GK)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 12)\n\nJulian Gressel (M)\n\nJosh Williams (D)\n\nLoan Expiration (Dec. 12)\n\nGustavo Vallecilla (D)\n\nDEC. 12 â Early in the offseason, LAFC face a lengthy list of questions. Co-president/GM John Thorrington and his staff will be busy.\n\nWe already know Giorgio Chiellini has retired. It's unclear if free agents Carlos Vela, Diego Palacios, Kellyn Acostaâ¯ and Maxime CrÃ©peau will return (though the Black & Gold are in talks to retain them). That's five starters from their MLS Cup 2023 finalist team!\n\nThere's extra focus on Vela's status, given his history and stature within the club. Will they reach a new deal, of the DP or TAM variety?\n\nAs that all gets sorted, LAFC are also in talks to keep goalkeeper John McCarthy and center back Denil â¯Maldonado (among others) for 2024.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 12)\n\nErik DueÃ±as (M)\n\nJesÃºs Murillo (D)\n\nAbraham Romero (GK)\n\nIlie SÃ¡nchez (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 12)\n\nKellyn Acostaâ¯(M)\n\nMaxime CrÃ©peau (GK)\n\nDiego Palacios (D)\n\nCarlos Vela (F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 12)\n\nDanny Crisostomo (M)\n\nJulian Gaines (D)\n\nEldin Jakupovic (GK)\n\nTony Leone (D)\n\nDenil Maldonado (D)\n\nJohn McCarthy (GK)\n\nDiego Rosales (D)\n\nChristian Torres (M)\n\nMohamed Traore (D)\n\nDEC. 11 â After being on loan during their club-record season, Orlando City are in discussions to bring back winger IvÃ¡n Angulo and midfielder Wilder Cartagena for 2024. Angulo was in town from Brazilâs Palmeiras, while Cartagena joined from Emrati club Al-Ittihad.\n\nAdditionally, Orlando confirmed theyâre in talks to transfer AntÃ´nio Carlos even though his contract option was picked up. The center back will reportedly join Brazilian side Fluminense.\n\nAs previously announced, the Lions and midfielder/captain Mauricio Pereyra agreed to mutually terminate the playerâs contract as he explores new opportunities.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 11)\n\nAntÃ´nio Carlos (D)\n\nMikey Halliday (D)\n\nRobin Jansson (D)\n\nJack Lynn (F)\n\nFelipe Martins (M)\n\nDuncan McGuire (F)\n\nLuca Petrasso (D)\n\nAbdi Salim (D)\n\nKyle Smith (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 11)\n\nWilfredo Rivera (F)\n\nJÃºnior Urso (M)\n\nLoan Expiration (Dec. 11)\n\nIvÃ¡n Angulo (F)\n\nWilder Cartagena (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 11)\n\nAdam Grinwis (GK)\n\nDEC. 6 â A busy winter awaits Supportersâ Shield winners FC Cincinnati, who have 23 players under contract for next season.\n\nTwo starters â right back Santiago Arias (contract option declined) and midfielder Junior Moreno (out of contract) â are in talks with Cincy about a new deal. There are also discussions with striker Dominique Badji, defender Ray Gaddis and midfielder Yuya Kubo, who all saw their contract option declined.\n\nAdditionally, center back Yerson Mosquera could return. His loan from Wolverhampton Wanderers has ended, but the club is in conversations with the Premier League team about a potential return.\n\nAnother area to monitor: left wingback Ãlvaro Barreal and striker Brandon Vazquez are under contract, but itâs no secret that they've generated transfer interest from European clubs.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 6)\n\nIan Murphy (D)\n\nArquimides OrdoÃ±ez (F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 6)\n\nSantiago Arias (D)\n\nDominique Badji (F)\n\nRay Gaddis (D)\n\nYuya Kubo (M)\n\nHarrison Robledo (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 6)\n\nJunior Moreno (M)\n\nLoan Expiration (Dec. 6)\n\nYerson Mosquera (D)\n\nDEC. 4 â Two starters from Houston's Western Conference finalist/US Open Cup-winning group are out of contract and eligible for free agency: forward Corey Baird and right back Griffin Dorsey. Baird had 8g/6a in 34 games this year, while Dorsey developed into an attacking threat with 3g/2a in 19 games.\n\nElsewhere, winger IvÃ¡n Franco is heading back to Paraguayan side Libertad after his season-long loan. And Zimbabwe international center back Teenage Hadebe, originally signed as a DP in 2021, saw his contract option declined after 51 games with the club.\n\nHouston, with 21 players on the roster for 2024, are \"negotiating with select players about their return.\" That figure includes DP striker SebastiÃ¡n Ferreira, who, after not fitting into head coach Ben Olsen's plans, has had a lackluster loan spell at Brazilian side Vasco da Gama.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 4)\n\nLuis Caicedo (M)\n\nTate Schmitt (D)\n\nThor Ãlfarsson (F)\n\nXavier Valdez (GK)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 4)\n\nIfunanyachi Achara (F)\n\nCharles Auguste (M)\n\nBeto Avila (F)\n\nTeenage Hadebe (D)\n\nMujeeb Murana (D)\n\nDaniel Rios (F)\n\nMatÃ­as Vera (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 4)\n\nCorey Baird (F)\n\nGriffin Dorsey (D)\n\nLoan Expiration (Dec. 4)\n\nIvÃ¡n Franco (F)\n\nDEC. 4 â What's long been discussed is now official, as legendary No. 10 NicolÃ¡s Lodeiro is out of contract. He seems highly unlikely to return to Seattle for 2024, opening a DP spot for a potential marquee addition.\n\nOn the goalkeeper front, Sounder At Heart's Jeremiah Oshan has reported longtime starter Stefan Frei will return even though he's currently out of contract. Additionally, backup Stefan Cleveland had his contract option declined and is eligible for free agency.\n\nAt striker, HÃ©ber's one-year run in Rave Green is over andÂ all-time leading scorer Fredy Montero is out of contract. Those moves create a need for No. 9 depth alongside RaÃºl RuidÃ­az and Jordan Morris.\n\nExpect most of Seattle's core back next year, includingÂ center backs Yeimar GÃ³mez Andrade and Jackson Ragen and midfielders JoÃ£o Paulo and Albert RusnÃ¡k after their contract options were exercised.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 4)\n\nJosh Atencio (M)\n\nXavier Arreaga (D)\n\nJacob Castro (GK)\n\nYeimar GÃ³mez Andrade (D)\n\nJoÃ£o Paulo (M)\n\nJackson Ragen (D)\n\nPaul Rothrock (M)\n\nAlbert RusnÃ¡k (M)\n\nDylan Teves (M/F)\n\nAndrew Thomas (GK)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 4)\n\nStefan Cleveland (GK)\n\nEthan Dobbelaere (D/M)\n\nHÃ©ber (F)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 4)\n\nAbdoulaye Cissoko (D)\n\nStefan Frei (GK)\n\nNicolÃ¡s Lodeiro (M)\n\nFredy Montero (F)\n\nKelyn Rowe (M)\n\nDEC. 4 â Will they stay or go? We're referring to captain/midfielder Alejandro Bedoya and All-Star left back Kai Wagner, who are both out of contract. As of now, Philadelphia say they're in ongoing conversations with the duo.\n\nHead coach Jim Curtin and sporting director Ernst Tanner seemed at odds over Bedoya returning or not. The Wagner situation is less clear, given his ongoing suspension and status as a sought-after free agent (either within MLS or abroad).\n\nPhilly also exercised the contract option on JuliÃ¡n Carranza, hedging against a possible transfer to Europe this winter. The Argentine striker is among their 25 players under contract for the 2024 campaign.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 4)\n\nJuliÃ¡n Carranza (F)\n\nChris Donovan (F)\n\nLeon Flach (M)\n\nDamion Lowe (D)\n\nJeremy Rafanello (F)\n\nJoaquÃ­n Torres (M/F)\n\nHolden Trent (GK)\n\nContract Option Declined (Dec. 4)\n\nAnton Sorenson (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 4)\n\nAlejandro Bedoya (M)\n\nJoe Bendik (GK)\n\nKai Wagner (D)\n\nDEC. 1 â An underwhelming MLS stay is over for MÃ©nder GarcÃ­a, as Minnesota declined the DP's contract option. The Colombian striker produced just 4g/2a in 39 games after arriving midway through the 2022 season. Teemu Pukki and Emanuel Reynoso are their other DPs.\n\nVeteran center backs Bakaye Dibassy and Brent Kallman are also leaving the Loons after combining to play in 185 regular-season games.\n\nWill a similar fate await winger Ismael Tajouri-Shradi and central midfielder Wil Trapp? The Loons are undergoing contract negotiations with that duo, as well as winger Cameron Dunbar and goalkeeper Fred Emmings.\n\nZooming out, Minnesota must appoint a full-time head coach for their post-Adrian Heath era. They're also waiting for new sporting director Khaled El-Ahmad to arrive from English third-tier side Barnsley.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nKervin Arriaga (M)\n\nMichael Boxall (D)\n\nTani Oluwaseyi (F)\n\nJoseph Rosales (M)\n\nZarek Valentin (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nBakaye Dibassy (D)\n\nEric Dick (GK)\n\nFred Emmings (GK)\n\nMÃ©nder GarcÃ­a (F)\n\nJan Gregus (M)\n\nEmmanuel Iwe (M)\n\nRyen Jiba (D)\n\nIsmael Tajouri-Shradi (F)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nCameron Dunbar (F)\n\nBrent Kallman (D)\n\nWil Trapp (M)\n\nDEC. 1 â Several significant updates emerged from the Earthquakes, including that DP midfielder Jamiro Monteiroâs contract option was declined. The Cape Verde international is eligible for free agency and boasts 14g/33a in 134 regular-season games during his MLS career.\n\nSan Jose's backline is in flux, too. Jonathan Mensah is out of contract/eligible for free agency after arriving in a preseason trade with the Columbus Crew. Nathan isnât returning after missing 2023 with a torn ACL. Peruvian international left back Miguel Trauco's contract option was declined. And, as expected, San Jose have exercised their purchase option on Rodrigues after his initial loan from Brazilian side GrÃªmio.\n\nIn the final third, San Jose arenât retaining Canadian international Ayo Akinola after he joined midsummer on loan from Toronto FC. Ditto for fellow summertime signing and US international Matthew Hoppe after his loan from Championship side Middlesbrough.\n\nBusy, busy times for Year Two under head coach Luchi Gonzalez.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nCarlos Akapo (D)\n\nMichael Baldisimo (M)\n\nOusseni Bouda (F)\n\nDaniel Munie (D)\n\nWill Richmond (F)\n\nJackson Yueill (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nOskar Ã gren (D)\n\nCam Cilley (M)\n\nJudson (M)\n\nJamiro Monteiro (M)\n\nNathan (D)\n\nTommy Thompson (M)\n\nKeegan Tingey (D)\n\nMiguel Trauco (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nJonathan Mensah (D)\n\nJack Skahan (M)\n\nLoan Expiration (Dec. 1)\n\nAyo Akinola (F)\n\nMatthew Hoppe (F)\n\nDEC. 1 â Sporting Kansas City have bid farewell to club legends Graham Zusi and Roger Espinoza, both of whom had their contract option declined. They are first and second, respectively, in the clubâs all-time appearance and minutes played charts.\n\nAs that era ends, TBD if DP midfielder Gadi Kinda has also played his final game for the club. The Israeli international is out of contract and received a bona fide offer from Sporting KC. After recovering from a season-ending knee injury in 2022, Kinda boasts 14g/16a in 64 regular-season games.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nStephen Afrifa (F)\n\nWilly Agada (F)\n\nRobert Castellanos (D)\n\nJake Davis (D)\n\nDanny Flores (M)\n\nChris Rindov (D)\n\nJohnny Russell (F)\n\nRemi Walter (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nRoger Espinoza (M)\n\nKortne Ford (D)\n\nFelipe GutiÃ©rrez (M)\n\nGraham Zusi (D)\n\nOut of Contract\n\nCam Duke (M)\n\nGadi Kinda (M)\n\nKendall McIntosh (GK)\n\nDEC. 1 â With their year-end roster update, D.C. Unitedâs squad stands at 19 players for the 2024 season.\n\nThat returning group includes only five defenders after Panamanian international Eric Davis and Honduran international Andy Najar both had their contract options denied. Additionally, center backs Donovan Pines and Derrick Williams are out of contract and will test the free-agency waters.\n\nAlly Mackay, the Black-and-Redâs new general manager and chief soccer officer, will be busy in the months ahead. They have an open DP spot alongside striker Christian Benteke and midfielder Mateusz Klich, plus could feasibly sign 10+ players.\n\nMost pressingly, the Eastern Conference club must hire a head coach after Wayne Rooney left in October.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nRussell Canouse (M)\n\nTed Ku-DiPietro (M)\n\nRuan (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nYamil Asad (M)\n\nEric Davis (D)\n\nJosÃ© Fajardo (F)\n\nJacob Greene (D)\n\nBrendan Hines-Ike (D)\n\nErik Hurtado (F)\n\nAndy Najar (D)\n\nNigel Robertha (F)\n\nGaoussou SamakÃ© (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nDonovan Pines (D)\n\nDerrick Williams (D)\n\nDEC. 1 â After five seasons at the club,Â homegrown attacker Omir Fernandez looks set to sign elsewhere. Heâs out of contract, having tallied 15 goals and 13 assists in 112 regular-season games for New York.\n\nIn other transactions, the Red Bulls have exercised a permanent transfer option for fullback Kyle Duncan through the 2025 season. He was previously on loan from Belgian side Oostende. Colombian youth international striker Jorge Cabezas-Hurtado will return to Watford FC after being on loan.\n\nTwo additional details to monitor: striker Tom Barlow and midfielder Dru Yearwood's contract options were picked up, but _The Athletic_'s Tom Bogert has reported they will be traded to Chicago and Nashville this winter, respectively.Â\n\nAll the while, the Red Bulls are seeking a new head coach after not retaining Troy Lesesne. That news was announced on Nov. 14, the same day the club mutually parted ways with longtime sporting director Denis Hamlett.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nTom Barlow (F)\n\nWiki Carmona (M)\n\nCameron Harper (D)\n\nDru Yearwood (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nHassan Ndam (D)\n\nMatt Nocita (D)\n\nJayden Reid (D)\n\nSteven Sserwadda (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nOmir Fernandez (F)\n\nDEC. 1 â An era looks over at CF MontrÃ©al. Honduran international striker Romell Quioto is out of contract and is eligible for free agency after posting 49g/36a in 153 games across seven seasons.\n\nTwo Canadian internationals â fullback Zachary Brault-Guillard and goalkeeper James Pantemis â had their 2024 contract options declined. Will both/either return on a new deal?\n\nFraming everything is MTLâs to-be-announced head coach. After narrowly missing the playoffs in 2023, they parted ways with HernÃ¡n Losada on Nov. 9.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nOusman Jabang (D)\n\nLogan Ketterer (GK)\n\nAriel Lassiter (F)\n\nRÃ³bert Thorkelsson (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nJean-Aniel Assi (F)\n\nZachary Brault-Guillard (D)\n\nAhmed Hamdi (M)\n\nJojea Kwizera (F)\n\nJames Pantemis (GK)\n\nSean Rea (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nRomell Quioto (F)\n\nDEC. 1 â With Curt Onalfo elevated to New England's sporting director role, theirÂ year-end roster update quickly followed suit.\n\nThe major headline is DP striker Gustavo Bou is out of contract after tallying 44g/20a in 100 regular-season games. The 33-year-old Argentine, who battled injuries the past two seasons, is unlikely to return.Â\n\nUnsurprisingly, the Revs picked up one-year contract options on defender Andrew Farrell and DP midfielder/captain Carles Gil. They also exercised a two-year contract option on midfielder Ian Harkes, who returned to MLS last summer from Scotland.Â\n\nWith TomÃ¡s ChancalayÂ permanently acquired as a DP (announced Tuesday), what else awaits in the Revs' post-Bruce Arena era?Â\n\nContract Options Exercised (Dec. 1)\n\nAndrew Farrell (D)\n\nCarles Gil (M)\n\nIan Harkes (M)\n\nJacob Jackson (GK)\n\nDamian Rivera (F)\n\nRyan Spaulding (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Dec. 1)\n\nEmmanuel Boateng (M)\n\nMaciel (M)\n\nChristian Makoun (D/M)\n\nBen Reveno (D)\n\nBen Sweat (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Dec. 1)\n\nGustavo Bou (F)\n\nOmar Gonzalez (D)\n\nJustin Rennicks (F)\n\nNOV. 30 â A winter of change looms for the Portland Timbers, who on Nov. 6 appointed Phil Neville as head coach.\n\nTheir roster reset is headlined by club legend SebastiÃ¡n Blanco not returning after his contract expired. The Argentine midfielder, who joined the Timbers in 2017, departs with 41g/51a in 176 regular-season games.\n\nAs general manager Ned Grabavoy previously announced, the club has opened a Designated Player spot by declining oft-injured striker Jaroslaw Niezgoda's contract option. Also, striker Franck Boli is gone after he tallied 7g/2a in 29 games this past season.\n\nWill veteran Honduran midfielder Bryan Acosta return? He's among those still in discussions.\n\nContract Option Exercised (Nov. 30)\n\nNathan FogaÃ§a (F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 30)\n\nBryan Acosta (M)\n\nFranck Boli (F)\n\nNoel Caliskan (M)\n\nDiego Gutierrez (M)\n\nEric Miller (D)\n\nJaroslaw Niezgoda (F)\n\nJustin Rasmussen (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 30)\n\nSebastiÃ¡n Blanco (M)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 30)\n\nBryan Acosta (M)\n\nDavid Bingham (GK)\n\nEric Miller (D)\n\nNOV. 30 â Two summertime additions are sticking around, as FC Dallas have picked up contract options on central midfielders Asier Illarramendi and Liam Fraser. Illarramendi, who's played in nearly 350 games for Spanish top-flight sides Real Sociedad and Real Madrid, is a big piece for next year.Â\n\nAfter three seasons at FCD, central midfielder Facundo Quignon and center back JosÃ© MartÃ­nez both had their contract options declined.Â\n\nTBD on whether forward JÃ¡der Obrian and veteran goalkeeper Jimmy Maurer are back (ongoing discussions). Obrian carries extra intrigue after tallying 17g/13a in 94 regular-season games. Maurer has backed up Maarten Paes, who's among their 25 players under contract for 2024.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 30)\n\nHerbert Endeley (F)\n\nLiam Fraser (M)\n\nAsier Illarramendi (M)\n\nSam Junqua (D)\n\nTsiki Ntsabeleng (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 30)\n\nJosÃ© MartÃ­nez (D)\n\nFacundo QuignÃ³n (M)\n\nCollin Smith (D)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 30)\n\nAmet KorÃ§a (D)\n\nJimmy Maurer (GK)\n\nJÃ¡der Obrian (F)\n\nNOV. 29 â After a record-setting expansion season, St. Louis CITY are poised to largely run it back in 2024. That's a perfectly understandable approach, too, after their odds-defying MLS introduction procured the Western Conference's No. 1 seed and a 2024 Concacaf Champions Cup berth.Â\n\nThe Midwest club has 25 players under contract for 2024, including breakthrough talents Sam Adeniran and Aziel Jackson (contract options exercised). CÃ©lio Pompeu and Josh Yaro, two pieces from their 2022 MLS NEXT Pro side, were also retained.\n\nAs for departures, Expansion Draft selections Jonathan Bell and John Nelson are both out of contract and available in the year-end Waiver Draft. Left back Selmir PidroÂ and midfielder Isak Jensen remain out on loan to European clubs.\n\nOne big question: With an open DP spot, will St. Louis make a splashy signing? Or are more system-based, team-is-the-star additions en route?\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 29)\n\nSam Adeniran (F)\n\nLucas Bartlett (D)\n\nAziel Jackson (M)\n\nAnthony Markanich (D)\n\nCÃ©lio Pompeu (M)\n\nJared Stroud (M)\n\nAkil Watts (D)\n\nJosh Yaro (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 29)\n\nMichael Creek (GK)\n\nMax Schneider (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 29)\n\nJonathan Bell (D)\n\nJohn Nelson (D)Â\n\nNOV. 28 â The moves were previously announced, but Colorado have formally bid farewell to midfielder Jack Price and forward Diego Rubio as their new era begins under head coach Chris Armas. Price was their captain and Rubio has 53 career MLS goals.\n\nVeteran goalkeeper William Yarbrough, who's played in 101 regular-season games for the club, saw his contract option declined. But Colorado remain in talks with him, as well as homegrowns Oliver Larraz and Sebastian Anderson after that duo's featured extensively in MLS NEXT Pro.\n\nWith 24 players under contract for next season, expect the Rapids to be busy after finishing last (14th) in the Western Conference in 2023.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 28)\n\nAndrew Gutman (D)\n\nCalvin Harris (F)\n\nRalph Priso (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 28)\n\nSebastian Anderson (D)\n\nSteven Beitashour (D)\n\nOliver Larraz (M)\n\nJack Price (M)\n\nAbraham Rodriguez (GK)\n\nGustavo Vallecilla (D)\n\nWilliam Yarbrough (GK)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 28)\n\nLuis DÃ­az (F)\n\nDiego Rubio (F)\n\nLoan Expired (Nov. 28)\n\nDanny Leyva (M)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 28)\n\nSebastian Anderson (D)\n\nOliver Larraz (M)\n\nWilliam Yarbrough (GK)\n\nNOV. 22 â Some key roster spots have opened up for Chicago Fire FC, who enter 2024 hoping to end a six-year streak of missing the Audi MLS Cup Playoffs. This is on top of appointing a head coach and signing a Designated Player striker/No. 9.\n\nThe Eastern Conference club has declined transfer options for defender Alonso Aceves and midfielder Ousmane Doumbia after they were on loan. Aceves, who arrived from Liga MXâs Pachuca, held a U22 Initiative slot. Doumbia, a midseason signing from Swiss sister side FC Lugano, was a DP.\n\nAdditionally, Chicago have exercised their purchase option on winger Maren Haile-Selassie. He joined in preseason from FC Lugano and finished as the Fireâs leading scorer with 6g/4a.\n\nAs previously announced, veteran striker Kei Kamara is out of contract and seeking a new club. The 39-year-old is third in the all-time MLS scoring charts with 144 goals, trailing Landon Donovan (145) for second place.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 22)\n\nJonathan Dean (D)\n\nJeff Gall (GK)\n\nFabian Herbers (M)\n\nWyatt Omsberg (D)\n\nSpencer Richey (GK)\n\nPurchase Option Exercised (Nov. 22)\n\nMaren Haile-Selassie (M)\n\nLoans Expiring, Not Returning (Nov. 22)\n\nAlonso Aceves (D)\n\nOusmane Doumbia (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 22)\n\nKei Kamara (F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 22)\n\nKendall Burks (D)\n\nAlex Monis (M)\n\nAllan RodrÃ­guez (M)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 22)\n\nJavier Casas Jr. (M)\n\nNOV. 17 â The first offseason for Austin FC sporting director Rodolfo Borrell is underway, and the former Manchester City assistant coach has created some wiggle room.\n\nAustin declined the contract option of nine players, including U22 Initiative winger Rodney Redes and veteran attackers like Will Bruin, Memo RodrÃ­guez and Maxi Urruti. Those moves, as well as the summertime trade of Diego Fagundez to the LA Galaxy, indicate Austin will look to retool their attack around star SebastiÃ¡n Driussi.\n\nAn important note: Alex Ringâs contract option for 2024 was automatically exercised due to the midfielder meeting certain benchmarks.\n\nAmid the shuffling, Austin have 20 contracted players for the 2024 campaign. Expect plenty of movement from the Verde & Black, who are trying to recapture their 2022 heights of making the Western Conference Final.\n\nUPDATE: Austin exercised the contract option for defender Hector Jimenez.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 17)\n\nDamian Las (GK)\n\nDaniel Pereira (M)\n\nAlex Ring (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 17)\n\nCharlie Asensio (D)\n\nWill Bruin (F)\n\nSofiane Djeffal (M)\n\nKipp Keller (D)\n\nAdam Lundkvist (D)\n\nAlfonso Ocampo-ChÃ¡vez (F)\n\nRodney Redes (F)\n\nMemo RodrÃ­guez (F)\n\nMaxi Urruti (F)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 17)\n\nHector Jimenez (D)\n\nNOV. 17 â Real Salt Lake have declined Damir Kreilachâs 2024 contract option, but the club legendâs MLS career could continue. RSL remain in discussions with their longtime captain about his future with the club. The Croatian midfielder has tallied 47g/24a in 151 regular-season games across the past six seasons, overcoming a back injury that derailed most of his 2022 campaign.\n\nDanny Musovski is out of contract, likely spelling the end of his RSL career. The forward would bring value to another MLS club after producing 16g/9a in just over 3,000 minutes.\n\nRSL, fresh off a third straight Audi MLS Cup Playoffs trip under head coach Pablo Mastroeni, return the vast majority of their 2023 roster. That includes midfielder Pablo Ruiz, whose contract option was exercised as he recovers from a long-term knee injury.Â\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 17)\n\nMikael Chang (M)\n\nEmeka Eneli (D/M)\n\nTomÃ¡s GÃ³mez (GK)\n\nBode Hidalgo (F)\n\nJasper LÃ¶ffelsend (D/M)\n\nBryan Oviedo (D)\n\nPablo Ruiz (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 17)\n\nJulio Benitez (M)\n\nDamir Kreilach (M/F)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 17)\n\nScott Caldwell (M)\n\nDanny Musovski (F)\n\nLoan Expired, Ongoing Talks (Nov. 17)\n\nMoses Nyeman (M)\n\nNOV. 17 â US international center back Miles Robinson might have played his final Atlanta United game, as the 26-year-old is out of contract and eligible for free agency. Robinson reportedly has interest from European clubs and, if he stays in MLS, could seek a Designated Player deal similar to USMNT center back Walker Zimmerman at Nashville SC.\n\nThereâs also uncertainly around Xande Silva, a key part of Atlantaâs summertime rise. The wingerâs loan from French side Dijon will expire at the end of 2023, and the Five Stripes havenât determined his transfer option.\n\nAnother big headline is Matheus Rossetto is out of contract after playing 90 games across four seasons. Atlanta could look to strengthen their central midfield group this winter alongside summer signing Tristan Muyumba and Argentine star Thiago Almada, should the latter player not get transferred abroad.\n\nCircling back to Robinson, Atlanta remain in renewal negotiations with him, homegrown defender EfraÃ­n Morales and goalkeeper Quentin Westberg. They've also declined the transfer option on Juanjo Purata after the center back was on loan from Liga MX powerhouse Tigres.\n\nBefore more offseason dominoes fall, ATLUTD have 22 players under contract for the 2024 campaign.\n\nContract Option Exercised (Nov. 17)\n\nAiden McFadden (D)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 17)\n\nMachop Chol (F)\n\nJackson Conway (F)\n\nClÃ©ment Diop (GK)\n\nJustin Garces (GK)\n\nEfraÃ­n Morales (D)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 17)\n\nOzzie Alonso (M)\n\nMiguel Berry (F)\n\nMiles Robinson (D)\n\nMatheus Rossetto (M)\n\nAmar SejdiÄ (M)\n\nQuentin Westberg (GK)\n\nTransfer Option Declined (Nov. 17)\n\nJuanjo Purata (D)\n\nNOV. 10 â Vancouver's strong summer transfer business helped fuel a playoff push, acquiring three Canadian internationals. But from that trio, only wingback Sam Adekugbe is guaranteed to return for 2024.\n\nThe Whitecaps are in discussions with both wingback Richie Laryea and forward Junior Hoilett about rejoining. Laryeaâs loan from Premier League side Nottingham Forest is through December 2023, while Hoilett is out of contract. Reports indicate Laryea might take their Designated Player spot opened by striker Sergio CÃ³rdovaâs midseason transfer to Turkey, so track that space closely.\n\nIn a similar vein, Vancouver are in talks with midfielders Sebastian Berhalter (out of contract) and Russell Teibert (entering option year) about returning. If the numberâs right, both players have a role to play under head coach Vanni Sartini.\n\nElsewhere, goalkeeper Thomas Hasalâs contract option was declined after Yohei Takaoka locked down the starting role. And the âCaps maintain depth at forward by retaining forwards Simon Becher and Levonte Johnson. Picking up defender Tristan Blackmon's contract options ('24 and '25) was a no-brainer, too.\n\nVancouver's roster currently stands at 19 players, with two players out on loan: midfielder Caio Alexandre at Brazil's Fortaleza EC through December 2023 and forward DÃ©iber Caicedo at Colombia's Junior FC through July 2024.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 10)\n\nSimon Becher (F)\n\nTristan Blackmon (D)\n\nIsaac Boehmer (GK)\n\nLevonte Johnson (F)\n\nRyan Raposo (D/M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 10)\n\nMatteo Campagna (D)\n\nKamron Habibullah (M)\n\nThomas Hasal (GK)\n\nOngoing Discussions (Nov. 10)\n\nSebastian Berhalter (M)\n\nJunior Hoilett (F)\n\nRichie Laryea (D/M)\n\nRussell Teibert (M)\n\nKarifa Yao (D)\n\nNOV. 2 â Another winter of change beckons for Toronto FC, who are entering their first full season under head coach John Herdman and general manager Jason Hernandez.\n\nThe biggest updates involve two veterans â midfielder VÃ­ctor VÃ¡zquez and striker CJ Sapong â who had their contract option declined. Amid other moves, including club legend Michael Bradley's retirement, the Reds have just 21 players with guaranteed contracts for 2024. And, at first glance, defense and central midfield are areas of need for a big-spending club that last made the playoffs in 2020.\n\nFor now, there's no movement on DP forwards Lorenzo Insigne and Federico Bernardeschi. Transfer speculation surrounds the Italians, who arrived midsummer in 2022 and haven't yet met expectations as the cornerstones of president Bill Manning's vision for TFC.\n\nToronto earned an MLS-low 22 points in 2023, good for the Wooden Spoon (last place).\n\nContract Options Exercised (Nov. 2)\n\nAlonso Coello (M)\n\nLuka Gavran (GK)\n\nContract Options Declined (Nov. 2)\n\nThemi Antonoglou (D)\n\nGreg Ranjitsingh (GK)\n\nTomÃ¡s Romero (GK)\n\nCJ Sapong (F)\n\nVÃ­ctor VÃ¡zquez (M)\n\nOut of Contract (Nov. 2)\n\nCristiÃ¡n Gutierrez (D)\n\nIn Discussions (Nov. 2)\n\nAimÃ© Mabika (D)\n\nOCT. 30 â Rebuilding depth is an early theme of Charlotte FCâs offseason after the second-year club declined contract options for six players, including livewire winger McKinze Gaines.\n\nThereâs a SuperDraft thread across the contract options CLTFC picked up, as striker Patrick Agyemang, midfielder Ben Bender and defender Andrew Privett are among those returning for 2024.\n\nBoth midfielder Derrick Jones and forward Justin Meram are out of contract and eligible for free agency. Charlotte remain in talks with Meram, who has over 350 MLS appearances, about a new deal. Jones, for his part, earned nearly 1,900 minutes this year.\n\nWith 26 players under contract for next season, Charlotte will look to build off their first-ever playoff appearance. And while thereâs transfer speculation around DP forward Karol Swiderski, the Poland international remains in the Queen City for now.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Oct. 30)\n\nPatrick Agyemang (F)\n\nBen Bender (M)\n\nHamady Diop (D)\n\nGeorge Marks (GK)\n\nAndrew Privett (D)\n\nNick Scardina (M)\n\nContract Options Declined (Oct. 30)\n\nHarrison Afful (D)\n\nMcKinze Gaines (F)\n\nChris Hegardt (M)\n\nPablo Sisniega (GK)\n\nJan Sobocinski (D)\n\nAdrian Zendejas (GK)\n\nOut of Contract (Oct. 30)\n\nDerrick Jones (M)\n\nJustin Meram (F)\n\nOCT. 30 â Following a disappointing season, New York City FC have retained â at least for now â much of their youthful core that fell just short on Decision Day. Twenty-five players are under contract for 2024, including goalkeepers Matt Freese and Luis Barraza after their contract options were exercised.\n\nBut there is some turnover after former US international midfielder Alfredo Morales (part of their MLS Cup 2021-winning squad) saw his contract option declined. Left back Braian CufrÃ©, who was on loan from LaLiga's RCD Mallorca, and attacker Matias Pellegrini, a one-time Young Designated Player signing for Inter Miami, also had their contract options declined.\n\nNYCFC have additional loan situations to determine, with midfielder Nicolas Acevedo (to Bahia) and forward Thiago Andrade (to Athletico Paranaense) in Brazil through December 2023. Deals for midfielders AndrÃ©s Perea (from Philadelphia Union) and Richard Ledezma (from PSV Eindhoven) are also expiring.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Oct. 30)\n\nLuis Barraza (GK)\n\nMatt Freese (GK)\n\nAndres Jasson (F)\n\nKevin OâToole (D)\n\nGabriel Segal (F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Oct. 30)\n\nNico Benalcazar (D)\n\nBraian CufrÃ© (D)\n\nJonathan Jimenez (F)\n\nAlfredo Morales (M)\n\nSamuel Owusu (D)\n\nMatias Pellegrini (F)\n\nStephen Turnbull (D)\n\nOCT. 25 â After a sensational summer, Inter Miami CF have set the stage for roster reinforcements this winter.\n\nThe biggest headline is the club has formally declined Josef MartÃ­nez's contract option, potentially making way for their long-rumored signing of Luis SuÃ¡rez. The Uruguayan star, of course, was teammates with Lionel Messi, Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba on several legendary FC Barcelona squads in the 2010s. Will Josef, an Atlanta United icon, sign elsewhere in MLS after his solitary season in South Florida?\n\nDixon Arroyo, acquired midseason after Gregore and Jean Mota's long-term injuries, is out of contract. But IMCF are in talks about the defensive midfielder possibly returning. Discussions are also ongoing with defender Leandro GonzÃ¡lez Pirez after his loan to Argentine side River Plate (who hold a purchase option).\n\nAnother wrinkle to watch for: U22 Initiative winger Emerson RodrÃ­guez is under contract for 2024, though Liga MX side Santos Laguna (where he's on loan) have a purchase option. Expect an update there since summertime signings Facundo FarÃ­as, TomÃ¡s AvilÃ©s and Diego GÃ³mez occupy U22 slots.\n\nFinland international winger Robert Taylor, who capitalized on Messi's arrival, had his contract option picked up. Ditto for homegrown Ian Fray, who's recovering from another serious knee injury.\n\nContract Options Exercised (Oct. 25)\n\nIan Fray (D/M)\n\nCole Jensen (GK)\n\nRobbie Robinson (F)\n\nRyan Sailor (D)\n\nLawson Sunderland (M)\n\nRobert Taylor (M/F)\n\nContract Options Declined (Oct. 25)\n\nJosef MartÃ­nez (F)\n\nJake LaCava (F)\n\nOut of Contract (Oct. 25)\n\nVictor Ulloa (M)\n\nOngoing Discussions (Oct. 25)\n\nDixon Arroyo (M)\n\nLeandro GonzÃ¡lez Pirez (D)"
