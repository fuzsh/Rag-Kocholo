        "text": "I have decided to take on a little project and look back at some of the disappointments from the 2004 NBA Draft. Giving the players five full seasons to prove their worth, I figured I could see who is a bust and who has soared.\n\nSo, I started at the top with Dwight Howardâ€”OK, he is great.\n\nThen came Emeke Okafor. Now, this could go either way, but I will give him credit. He is a stellar double-double man.\n\nBen Gordon was selected third and he is a top player.\n\nThen comes Shaun Livingston, who was selected fourth by the Los Angeles Clippers. Man, he has had a tough road.\n\nLivingston is an injury waiting to happen. He played in only 30 games his rookie season. His numbers looked like this: 27 minutes per game, seven points per game, and five assists per contest.\n\nThe 2005-06 season would see him play in a career-high 61 games, but his numbers dropped a little. Then, the 2006-07 season was his best until the terrible knee injury everybody has seen a hundred times...but if not, here you go .\n\nLivingston missed the whole 2007-08 season rehabbing . He was released after the 2008 season by the Clippers and went through lots of struggles last year.\n\nLivingston did get picked up by the Miami Heat, where he played four games before being traded then released again. Oklahoma City signed him late last season. Livingston played eight games for the Thunder, getting one start.\n\nWith Livingston finally being healthy, look for him to make an impact on this young Thunder team and don't be surprised that if he stays healthy, he will battle Thabo Sefolosha for starting time.\n\nLivingston has paid his dues to the injury gods and knows he needs just one full season to prove his worth."
