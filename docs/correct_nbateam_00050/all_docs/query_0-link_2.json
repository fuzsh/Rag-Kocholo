        "text": "SAN FRANCISCO – Those who saw Shaun Livingston before the gruesome knee injury swore he had the potential to be a star.\n\nAt 6-foot-7 with a quick first step and natural feel for the game, he became the rare high school point guard to go top four in an NBA Draft. Big men often went high because of potential. But not point guards. Not unless they had size like Livingston.\n\nHis first three seasons with the Clippers were solid, not spectacular. But like most young players, he was improving, averaging a career-high 9.3 points and 5.1 assists as a 21-year-old in the 2006-07 season.\n\nBut to this day, those remain his career-high marks. Because that’s the season he went down with that catastrophic knee buckle – tearing his ACL, MCL, PCL and dislocating his kneecap.\n\nMost basketball observers remember this tragic fate. And most have followed his inspiring return back. But not many know where that path started.\n\nIt was in Tulsa, through the Thunder organization.\n\n“That was 2009,” Livingston said, recalling it with fondness now. “March 2009.”\n\nThough he’ll never return to pre-injury form, Livingston played well for the Nets on a minimum contract last season. It earned him a 3-year, $16 million deal to become the Warriors backup point guard this offseason. He remade his career by remaking his game, relying on his craftiness, size and smarts against smaller guards because the explosion was no longer there.\n\nBut when he partnered with the Thunder back in the day, he first had to rebuild his confidence. General manager Sam Presti had shown interest in Livingston. But it wasn’t for a contract with the Thunder. It was for a chance to rehab his body and mind with the Tulsa 66ers.\n\nThe former lottery pick was ticketed to the D-League.\n\n“Humbling,” Livingston said of the situation. “Very humbling. It was obviously a sharp fall from where I was. But it was the circumstances.”\n\nFor both, looking back, it was a perfect match.\n\nThe Thunder was still finding its identity as an organization. Now, OKC can be used as the model for how to best utilize your D-League program. But back then, Presti was just figuring out how best to do it.\n\nLivingston was a test case and the initial success story – eventually becoming the first of what would become many 66ers to Thunder call-ups, playing 18 games for OKC over two seasons.\n\n“Around that time, they were really starting to put together some good pieces to their team and grow their team and the D-League process was part of that,” Livingston said. “For that type of move and what they were doing, it made sense.”\n\nAnd though it was a tough pill to swallow, it also made sense for Livingston.\n\nAt that time, in his current state, no NBA team was going to play him extended minutes or expend a ton of time and effort to cater to his needs.\n\nHe needed to get court time to test that knee in a variety of situations and train his brain to no longer worry about it.\n\nThat opportunity could only come in the D-League.\n\n“It was tough,” Livingston remembers. “My knee was still having some issues. That was the first time I really started playing on the road, back-to-backs, those sort of things. I started to turn the corner a bit, still having good days and bad days, but more good days than bad days. So it was that transitional part of the recovery.”\n\nOver the next five years, he’d play on six teams, eventually landing with the Warriors, where he’ll face the Thunder on Monday night. So there’s been plenty of career stops. But Oklahoma holds a special place in his heart.\n\n“For them to give me that opportunity, I’m forever grateful,” Livingston said. “It’s a part of my journey. I’m grateful for the opportunity Sam gave me. And I respect Scott Brooks to the fullest, one of the better coaches I played for.”"
