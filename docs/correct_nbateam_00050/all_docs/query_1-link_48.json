        "text": "The shock waves from Kevin Durant’s decision to leave the Oklahoma City Thunder and join the Golden State Warriors will be reverberating around the league for weeks and months – if not years – to come.\n\nBut as everyone waits to see how Durant’s move to the Bay Area impacts the Warriors and how they play, the fallout from his decision in Golden State, Oklahoma City and elsewhere is about to lead to a hectic few weeks in The Association.\n\nHere are five things still to be sorted out in the wake of Durant going to the Warriors:\n\n1. How will Golden State create the cap space to get Durant?\n\nThis is already underway. Golden State got Durant, but in order to officially sign him when the NBA’s free agency moratorium ends Thursday the Warriors still had some work to do to create the cap space necessary to give Durant a max contract. To create it, Golden State had to renounce all of its free agents, including restricted free agents Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli, and trade Andrew Bogut into someone’s cap space.\n\nWatch Frank Caliendio read Kevin Durant’s letter — as Morgan Freeman\n\nRenouncing free agents is just a matter of paperwork, and that was never going to be an issue. The tricky part was going to be finding a suitor for Bogut, who is entering the final year of a contract that’s worth $12.7 million in 2017. But it appears the most obvious home for the 7-foot Australian center – the Dallas Mavericks – is where he’ll wind up. Dallas not only had a need for a starting center, but also had the cap space to take Bogut’s contract without sending anything back to Golden State – a necessary component to clearing the cap space they needed to bring Durant into the fold. The only remaining question: Will the Warriors have to send a first-round pick to Dallas to make the deal happen?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. What will happen to Russell Westbrook?\n\nThis is perhaps the most important question facing the league. It’s not often that a top-five player chooses to change teams, as Durant did Monday. But his decision could also impact the future of a second top-five player in Westbrook, now his former teammate.\n\nWestbrook was always deemed likely to bolt from the Thunder even before Durant made his decision. Now, it seems impossible to think Westbrook will stick around when his contract expires next summer and he becomes an unrestricted free agent himself.\n\nSo Thunder General Manager Sam Presti – who has shown in trading James Harden and Serge Ibaka previously that he doesn’t have a problem with making and taking a decisive action — can go to Westbrook with a choice: Accept an offer to renegotiate and extend his contract now, allowing Westbrook to get an instant raise and extra years on his deal, or be traded.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt seems unlikely Westbrook would accept such an offer – even if he got a raise now, he could make far more money next summer in free agency when the salary cap is set to shoot up significantly once again.\n\nSo if he does turn it down, where could he go? Plenty of teams will be trying to get Presti’s ear, with Boston at the front of the line. But the most obvious trade candidate is the Los Angeles Lakers. Westbrook is a Los Angeles native, went to UCLA and has been thought to be a likely target for the Lakers when he hits free agency next summer. And while teams such as Boston have lots of draft picks to offer, the Lakers have young players who can step in right now – specifically D’Angelo Russell and Brandon Ingram, the past two No. 2 picks in the NBA draft. The Lakers need a star, and getting Westbrook would allow them to offer him a five-year max contract next summer as a free agent. This situation bears watching.\n\n3. How will Durant’s decision impact the upcoming collective bargaining agreement negotiations?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile Westbrook’s future will be the biggest on-court ramification of Durant’s decision, the biggest one off the court will be what happens with the next CBA. The last time the NBA saw a super team created, when LeBron James teamed up with Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade, the NBA created a list of rules within the next collective bargaining agreement one year later to try to prevent it from happening again.\n\nEven though that didn’t work, don’t think the league and its owners won’t try to do so again over the next year. Both the league and the players’ union have a chance to opt out of the current CBA in December, and if either side does there will be six months to come up with a new one before a lockout would happen in July 2017.\n\nSeveral issues created by the current CBA – including an inability to extend players fully a year before free agency – helped foster the conditions to make Durant’s move possible. How that information shapes negotiations could have a huge impact on how the league operates moving forward.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n4. What will happen with the remaining big name free agents?\n\nGolden State may now be the prohibitive favorites to win the NBA title next season – and possibly the next few after that – but there are still prominent free agents who are left to sign elsewhere.\n\nTim Duncan reportedly ready to retire\n\nOne agreed to a deal quickly after Durant, with Pau Gasol going to the San Antonio Spurs to play alongside LaMarcus Aldridge and to potentially replace Tim Duncan, who is leaning toward retirement. Wade has reportedly received a two-year, $40 million offer from the Miami Heat, getting the future Hall of Famer back to the number he was at last season and all but assuring he will stay on South Beach as expected. Three more future Hall of Famers on the market – James, Dirk Nowitzki and Manu Ginobili – are also virtually guaranteed to return to their teams for next season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn addition to signing James, the Cavaliers still need to lock up free agent J.R. Smith, arguably the best player available outside of that group. Barnes is all but certainly headed to Dallas after being renounced by the Warriors, while Ezeli – also now unrestricted – is the best free agent center remaining for teams to chase.\n\nThe biggest dominoes left to fall will be among restricted free agents. Players such as Maurice Harkless, Allen Crabbe and Meyers Leonard in Portland and Jared Sullinger and Tyler Zeller in Boston will have to see how their market plays out with Durant finally off the board.\n\n5. How will Golden State fill out the back half of its roster?\n\nThe Warriors have plenty of scoring and star power. But who will man the middle for them?\n\nDraymond Green will likely be the starting center, or play there the majority of the time, but Golden State currently has only one true center – injured rookie Damian Jones – on its roster. Between minimum roster sports and the $2.9 million room exception, the Warriors will have to try to add some big bodies to go along with their top six players – Durant, Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Green, Andre Iguodala and Shaun Livingston – as well as fill in with depth behind them.\n\nGolden State will hope to convince players to take far less than they could get elsewhere in this inflated cap environment to play for a championship favorite.\n\nWith all the money flying around, it won’t be easy. But the Warriors already did something far more difficult: convincing a future Hall of Famer to join them. They will happily try and fill out the roster because of it."
