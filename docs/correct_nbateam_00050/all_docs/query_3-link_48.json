        "text": "Some online love for Shaun Livingston has social media talking.\n\nThe Peoria native and three-time NBA champion was part of the discourse in NBA Twitter this week, when New York City-based content creator @JWepp posted a list of the top five mid-range jumpers he's ever seen.\n\nLivingston — singled out for his time with the Golden State Warriors — topped a list that included legendary NBA players like Kawhi Leonard, Chris Paul, Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the Tweet had nearly 40,000 likes and was shared about 5,000 times on Twitter.\n\nThe debate exploded when multiple larger accounts picked up the post, including ESPN and House of Highlights. ESPN's post on Instagram has up above 500,000 likes as of Friday morning.\n\n\"Shaun Livingston's middy was automatic,\" ESPN wrote in its post, which also included a shot of Livingston's sweet stroke from inside the 3-point line.\n\nSome who replied to the post shared their love for Livingston, a 37-year-old Peoria High graduate now retired from the NBA and working in the Warriors front office.\n\n\"I swear I’ve never seen Livingston miss a midrange,\" wrote @ThreeandG. \"Especially in the Finals,\" replied @dredaydontplay, while another called Livingston the \"Steph Curry of 2s.\"\n\nTwitter user @IBleedColtsBlue wrote, \"Shaun Livingston was on demon time,\" with two crying laughing emojis.\n\nTrue to an online debate, others were more struck by the names that didn't make the list — like Carmelo Anthony, Richard Hamilton, Kevin Durant and Dirk Nowitzki.\n\nWes Huett is Journal Star sports editor.
