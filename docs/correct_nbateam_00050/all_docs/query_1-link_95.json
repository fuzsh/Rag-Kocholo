        "text": "MVP\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2013\n\nLocation: Iowa\n\nTaking a Gamble: NBA 2k17 Expansion Dynasty\n\nTaking a Gamble: NBA 2k17 Expansion Dynasty\n\nI have been reading here ever since 2k17 came out, and have messed around on the game enough to get it to my liking. I will be using the new expansion mode, and control the Las Vegas Aces!\n\nThe Setup\n\nNot only one: Because I didn't want just one expansion team, the NBA has also added the Louisville Liberty, along with the Las Vegas' Aces.\n\n31 Games: I am hoping to play every game, and get thru multiple seasons. That wasn't going to happen on either 82, or 61, so instead I have decided to settle on 31.\n\n10 Minute Quarters: All games will be played 10 minutes long. Simulated games will also be 10 minutes, so stats are the same.\n\nSuperstar Difficulty: I am playing on superstar difficulty, with custom sliders of my own.\n\nUpdates:\n\nI will update after every game. I plan on using a tweet generator to have 'real' people tweet about my fictional league, so that should be fun\n\n***Shoutout to JuiceboxCA, who inspired me to do this, among others, but Juicebox is one of my favorite dynasties to read. Also got the idea of 31 games from his dynasty, so if you are reading this, thank you!***\n\n__________________\n\nWatch me game on Twitch!\n\nCollege Football - Iowa Hawkeyes\n\nCollege Basketball - Iowa Hawkeyes\n\nMLB - Minnesota Twins\n\nNBA - Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nNFL - New York Jets\n\nNHL - Minnesota Wild\n\nMVP\n\nOVR: 0\n\nJoin Date: Feb 2013\n\nLocation: Iowa\n\nRe: Taking a Gamble: NBA 2k17 Expansion Dynasty\n\nThe Expansion Draft\n\nThis is what we have all been waiting for, the 2016 expansion draft. The Las Vegas Aces and the Louisville Liberty will begin to form their team tonight, and it will be interesting to see the strategies each team take. Each team has sent in their list of 8 players they wish to protect, and the others are up for grabs.\n\nMalcolm Trice's Plan\n\nThis is Trice's first job in the NBA, after working over seas for 9 years, winning his league championships 4 out of the 9 years. Las Vegas hired him when it was announced they would be getting an NBA team, and he looks like a great pick. We got a chance to speak with Malcolm before the draft, and asked him for his plan. \"I know the league is going towards shooters, but I want to have an athletic team, with guys that can play multiple positions. We will revolve around getting to the rim, and playing fast.\"\n\nThe Draft\n\nThe Ace's were announced having the first pick, with the Liberty receiving the next two.\n\nRound 1: Norman Powell (75, SG)\n\nThe first player off the board is from the Raptors, and that is shooting guard Norman Powell. Powell is only 23 years old, and looks to have great potential. He is athletic, and can also shoot the 3. Louisville selected Joe Johnson and Tony Allen in the first and second round.\n\nRound 2:Festus Ezeli (77, C)\n\nRound 3: Patrick Mills (76, PG)\n\nWhat a shame. Festus just signed a new deal with Portland this past summer, and is now being snatched away after not being protected in the expansion draft. Festus should be great in the pick and roll. Mills has been with the Spurs his entire career, so this will be an adjustment for him. Lousville selected Michael Beasly and P.J Tucker in the 3rd and 4th round.\n\nRound 4:Gerald Henderson (SF, 74)\n\nRound 5:Yi Jianlian (PF, 75)\n\nGerald Henderson is short for the SF position, but he can do a little of everything. He can knock down an open 3, fly to the rim, and even bring the ball up the court if needed. Yi Jianlian was cut by the Lakers after he didn't get the shot he wanted, but now he will be a starter on this team. Louisville selected Deron Williams and Marreesse Speights in the 5th and 6th round.\n\nRound 6:Ty Lawson (PG, 73)\n\nRound 7:Ersan Ilyasova (PF, 75)\n\nThese picks are very important for an expansion team, as the players off the bench won't be much worse -- if at all -- than the players starting the game. Lawson is an athletic point guard, that should be able to man the 2nd unit well. Ersan will be a scoring threat off the bench at the stretch four. Louisville selected Malik Beasley, and Nene in the 7th and 8th round.\n\nRound 8:Shabazz Muhammad (SF, 73)\n\nRound 9:Gerald Green (SG, 73(\n\nMuhammad is a long small forward, despite only being 6'6\". He will log minutes off the bench, as a SG, and SF. Green is an older player to be taken in an expansion draft, but is a cheap option. He also fits the mold that the front office is looking to fill, as he is very athletic. Louisville selected Shaun Livingston and Taj Gibson in the 9th and 10th round.\n\nRound 10:Mike Muscala (C, 72)\n\nRound 11:Tomas Satoransky (PG, 72)\n\nMuscala is a 7'0\" center who can run the pick and roll extremely well, as he has the ability to hit from 15 feet. Satoransky is a 6'7\" who I am hoping turns out to be Shaun Livingston 2.0. Satoransky also has the ability to hit the three ball, which I like about his game. Louisville selected Aron Baynes and BRandon Jennings in the 11th and 12th round.\n\nRound 12:Georges Niang (SF, 68)\n\nRound 13:Chris McCullough (PF, 69)\n\nThe last two picks of the draft were rounded off with two long, lengthy players. Niang is fresh out of college, from Iowa State. He can hit the three ball, but has slow feet. McCullough is only 21 years old, and is progressing quickly, although he looks to be a project on the offensive end. Louisville rounded out the draft with Jeff Green.\n\nDepth Chart:\n\nPG - Patty Mills/Ty Lawson\n\nSG - Norman Powell/Gerald Green/Tomas Satoransky\n\nSF - Gerald Henderson/Shabazz Muhammad/Georges Niang\n\nPF - Yi Jianlian/Ersan Ilyasova/Chris McCullough\n\nC - Festus Ezeli/Mike Muscala\n\n__________________\n\nWatch me game on Twitch!\n\nCollege Football - Iowa Hawkeyes\n\nCollege Basketball - Iowa Hawkeyes\n\nMLB - Minnesota Twins\n\nNBA - Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nNFL - New York Jets\n\nNHL - Minnesota Wild"
