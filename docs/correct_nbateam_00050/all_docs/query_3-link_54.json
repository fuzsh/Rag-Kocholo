        "text": "OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- JaVale McGee practices 3-pointers from all around the arch, just in case. He sits with assistant coach Jarron Collins and a laptop to study film, long after practice and his shooting workouts are complete.\n\nThe 7-footer's rugged professional path has landed him at seemingly the perfect stop: in the Bay Area with the NBA's best.\n\nJust don't call him a journeyman.\n\n\"I've never considered myself a journeyman in the first place,\" McGee, a Dallas Maverick last season, said after a practice this weekend. \"Whatever y'all want to call me y'all can call me. The number of teams I've been on was in like one year. I've been with three teams in two years.\"\n\nYet McGee must not look far to find someone else who has learned to thrive as a well-traveled NBA role player. Just a quick glance a couple of lockers down to where Shaun Livingston dresses at Oracle Arena, defying the odds yet again this season as a regular reserve contributing to another Warriors championship chase, is all it takes.\n\nMcGee has never made it this far, an NBA Finals first-timer when Golden State hosts defending champion Cleveland in Game 1 on Thursday night. Livingston never should have made it this far, and here he is back to the final round seeking his second title in three seasons -- and 10 years after a devastating injury that could have sidelined him for good. Doctors thought they might have to amputate his left leg.\n\nFourteen teams between them, over 21 combined seasons. Each has found a great groove in Golden State's rotation, called upon to take pressure off the big stars while maintaining the highest level.\n\n\"We just kind of follow suit, but it's up to everybody to come in and lock in on the details. It's the playoffs,\" Livingston said. \"Obviously the stars help, they get all the headlines deservedly so, but the small things, the details, that's what we lock in at and that's how we win ballgames.\"\n\nMcGee, who played in 34 games for Dallas last season, has discovered the ideal place to shine as an alley-oop specialist in a pass-happy offense, and even Stephen Curry admits it's so easy to target the sure-handed big man perhaps the Warriors do so too often at times.\n\n\"We almost get in trouble because we try to do it too much even if it's not there, because he has the ability to catch it really anywhere around the rim, around the backboard,\" Curry acknowledged. \"You kind of see it developing when he gets a free lane to the rim, and as a passer in that situation literally feel the most confidence that if I just get it anywhere up there, he'll go get it, and usually he does.\"\n\nWith great efficiency, too.\n\nIn Game 3 against the Spurs, McGee scored a postseason-best 16 points, all in the first half to get Golden State going as Zaza Pachulia sat out with a bruised heel. He made all seven of his shots in Game 2 of a first-round win against Portland, shooting 18 for 23 in all in the four-game sweep of the Trail Blazers.\n\n\"That's my whole thing, I just try to be efficient out there,\" McGee said. \"I don't try to do too much. I just try to do what's necessary for me in the minutes that I'm out there.\"\n\nLivingston has unselfishly dealt with a diminished role, a rotation change late in the season that altered when he's used, and then a hand injury in the first round of the playoffs.\n\nIn February 2007 with the Clippers, Livingston tore three major ligaments in his knee -- the anterior cruciate, posterior cruciate and medial collateral as well as his lateral meniscus, then required extensive surgery. Though the injury could have ended his career at age 21, he still believed he would play again. First he had to walk again.\n\n\"Shaun, that story isn't really the same now. He's become a staple of this franchise, he's helped us win a title, he's done some great things here,\" Draymond Green said. \"For JaVale, it's still fresh, to where I think it's a great situation for him. He's finally been put in a position where he can do what he do. He's finally come to an organization, a first-class organization, that has embraced him for him and not tried to make him something that he's not. I think that has been pretty special, just seeing his growth over the course of the year, how he's been able to thrive. ... It's special to see when you take the path that they've taken to get to this moment.\"\n\nMcGee will have to help keep Cleveland's Tristan Thompson off the boards. His teammates know he's up to the task.\n\n\"It just speaks to his kind of character and perseverance and work ethic and his belief in himself that when he's out there on the floor he deserves to be out there on the floor, he belongs and can make an impact,\" Curry said. \"When he showed up here, he understood the opportunity and he's taken full advantage of it. It's great to see.\""
