        "text": "Editor's note: Three-time NBA champion Shaun Livingston of Peoria retired from the league on Friday, Sept. 13, 2019. Ten years ago, then-Journal Star sports editor Kirk Wessler — who has know Livingston nearly his whole life — caught up with Livingston just before chapter two of his career began. We publish that Aug. 5, 2009, story here in its entirety.\n\nHis braids are gone. The Afro, too. Shaun Livingston sports a tight, conservative hairstyle that makes him look older. Not exactly what he wants to hear.\n\nThe TrueHoop blog recently called him \"the oldest 24-year-old in the NBA.\"\n\n\"They got my age wrong,\" Livingston says. \"I'm only 23.\"\n\nYes, he is — for about five more weeks. So we search for another phrase to describe his look. \"More mature\" works. It fits his personality, too. The smile reveals Livingston likes the compliment.\n\nThis was the fear some of us expressed in 2004, when Livingston jumped straight from Peoria High into the NBA draft: that he would get used and abused and ultimately discarded because he couldn't handle life off the court. Despite being the undisputed star of consecutive state championship teams, Livingston was a pleaser, not a leader. Supremely confident with a ball in his hands, he tried to talk a good game in civvies. He couldn't sell it.\n\n\"Mr. Perry knows,\" Livingston says, smiling at Chris Perry, a former PHS dean on hand for the player's youth camp at his alma mater this week. \"I'm not good at acting. I never got out of any detentions.\"\n\nThe comment is Livingston's answer to a question about his film aspirations, since in the past year he has explored production opportunities in the movie business. But it's revealing of the honesty with which he assesses himself now.\n\nReally, given the events of his playing career, Livingston has had little choice. If he hadn't grown up quick, if he hadn't matured, he already would be just another exhibit on the scrap pile, fulfilling the dark prophecy so many of his family and friends feared.\n\nOne moment, he was a rising star on the court, blooming as a 6-feet-7 point guard with a young and talented LA Clippers team. In a blink, he was finished; crashing to the floor on Feb. 26, 2007, screaming from the pain in his shredded left knee. The ligaments and cartilage were torn; the kneecap dislocated. For a short time, amputation of his lower leg was not out of the question.\n\nAfter surgery and more than a year of rehab, the Clippers released Livingston. The Miami Heat took a short chance on him, then cut him. He finally wound up signing last winter with Tulsa, of the Development League, there to travel by bus instead of charter plane and stay in budget motels rather than five-star suites with room service.\n\n\"Humbling,\" Livingston calls the experience.\n\nHe had gone from the No. 4 pick in the draft and all that entails — a multimillion-dollar contract, superstar projections - to nothing. Nobody questioned his mad skills, which don't fade until one starts to get really old. Like 30 and over. Everybody questioned whether Livingston ever would be able to use them to compete with the best players in the world again.\n\nFirst, Livingston says, he had to show them that \"my knee wasn't hanging off my body when I run.\" Then he had to rebuild strength and stamina; never an easy chore for a guy of his height who weighs only 195 pounds. And he had to prove his attitude was right.\n\nDuring his short life in the D-League, Livingston came to learn - really learn - that hundreds of men, even a thousand or more, have enough talent to play in the NBA. But fewer than 500 do so in any given season. \"So many guys trying to get into the NBA, and so few spots,\" he says.\n\nAnd fewer guarantees. He would have to fight his way back and take nothing for granted.\n\nTulsa's D-League team is affiliated with the NBA's Oklahoma City Thunder. On March 31, the Thunder signed Livingston for the final eight games of the season. A successful summer-league stint led the two to agree on a guaranteed pact for the 2009-10 season, believed to be worth about $850,000.\n\nLivingston says his knee is about 95 percent healthy. He can jump well off two feet, but still lacks his formerly explosive, one-step ability to get to the rim over opposing point guards. He believes that will come, although team circumstances might dictate he play more as a point forward than as a point guard.\n\nOver the past two-plus years, he has worked and watched and learned. Going through the darkness that he experienced, Livingston has gained confidence in himself as a person. He doesn't have to tell you this. You can see it in his walk and hear it in his talk.\n\nHe finds himself speaking up, being an advocate for the right way to go about the business of being a professional basketball player. He no longer tells you he wants to be a leader. That quality is starting to emanate from him, naturally. It's the kind of evolution you see in people who have faced the end of the road and refused to quit; who have gained real appreciation for what they have and a responsibility to use their gifts wisely.\n\n\"I know I can play in this league,\" Livingston says. \"If I can get back to where I was, or God willing, become an All-Star, who cares if I played in the D-League? I'm capable of making other guys on my team better.\""
