        "text": "Twenty-four hours later, the NBA world was still buzzing about Stephen Curry’s incredible Saturday night performance. Twenty-four years from now, NBA TV will still run back that game-winning moonshot.\n\nBut lost amid this hardwood classic was a dilemma that should concern the Thunder in the present. Curry’s impossible accuracy won it, but the Warriors got back into the game with their small-ball death lineup, which completely dictated the final 10 minutes.\n\nWith 4:37 left in regulation, Andre Iguodala subbed in for Shaun Livingston, joining Curry, Klay Thompson, Harrison Barnes and Draymond Green. The Warriors were down 11. In fewer than five minutes, they forced overtime. Then in five overtime minutes, they outscored the Thunder by three.\n\nSo in a little less than 10 minutes total, that nightmarish Golden State unit beat the Thunder 36-22. Curry played hero. Green was a defensive menace. The other three chipped in. But of greater consequence, the versatility of that Warriors five-man grouping forced Billy Donovan’s hand, shrinking OKC’s depth.\n\nBreaking news: Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook are the Thunder’s two best players. They’re always on the court in crunch time, barring a foul-out … which we’ll get to.\n\nBeyond them, Serge Ibaka and Steven Adams are the team’s third and fourth most balanced, important talents. You want both on the court in crucial moments.\n\nWhich is where the problem lies. When the Warriors slide Green to center and pepper two-way wings all over the court, they challenge you to take one off the floor or risk some uncomfortable mismatches.\n\nAfter an 8-point, 3-rebound, 0-block disappearance in Oakland, Ibaka was great on Saturday night. The Thunder demolished Golden State 62-32 in rebounds, and Ibaka was the key. He had a season-high 20 rebounds, along with 15 points, two blocks and countless other contested and altered shots. He played a team-high 41 minutes. His presence was required.\n\nWhich meant Adams was the odd man out. Of late, Adams has been great, providing a sturdy defensive back-line while finishing layups and dunks with more consistency. He had 10 points and nine rebounds in his 28 minutes on Saturday. But in his final 136 seconds, Adams was out of his element.\n\nFrom the 4:37 mark of the fourth to the 2:21 mark, Donovan kept Adams and Ibaka in together against that small-ball unit. The Warriors quickly blasted off a 7-0 run to get back in the game. Adams was assigned Iguodala. The Warriors recognized it and attacked Adams with Curry and Iguodala in a pick-and-roll. Curry got the big man on a switch and hit the ninth of his 12 3s.\n\nRight after, Donovan subbed in Dion Waiters for Adams, going small and ceding to the Warriors style.\n\nThen as the game navigated through overtime, Adams sat all but nine seconds. Donovan put him in to win the tip at the start of overtime, which he did, and then pulled him at the first whistle, reinserting Waiters.\n\nDurant fouled out 38 seconds later, a crippling blow, presenting Donovan with another choice. Go back big with Adams or stay small? He remained small, choosing Kyle Singler to replace Durant.\n\nAnd this is the conundrum the Thunder faces against the Warriors. While many believe OKC’s talent could give Golden State its biggest postseason challenge, the Warriors versatile options exposes the Thunder’s roster imbalance. OKC is deep in the frontcourt but thin on the wing. The Warriors small-ball strategy can nullify frontcourt players and force you to dip deep into your bag of wings.\n\nWaiters played 31 minutes on Saturday, in which the Thunder was outscored by 18. Singler played nearly 23 minutes, in which the Thunder was outscored by eight. They both closed the game.\n\nMeanwhile Enes Kanter, a well-paid 23-year-old who has actually been effective in spurts against the Warriors, played only 17 minutes and sat the final 13. Adams, an emerging 22-year-old, joined him for all but nine seconds of the final seven minutes.\n\nIn the Thunder’s ideal world, Adams or Kanter would close alongside Ibaka. But nothing about the Warriors allows you to live in an ideal world."
