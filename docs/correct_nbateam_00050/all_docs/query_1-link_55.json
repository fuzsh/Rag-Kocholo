        "text": "The Warriors staved off elimination in the Western Conference finals with a 120-111 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder at Oracle Arena. Golden State now trails the Thunder 3-2 with Game 6 coming on Saturday night at Chesapeake Energy Arena in Oklahoma City.\n\nStephen Curry\n\nRelevant Statline: 31 points on 9-for-20 shooting (3-for-8 from 3-point range, 10-for-10 from the line), 7 rebounds, 6 assists, 5 turnovers, 5 steals, +6 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 5 steals\n\nStephen Curry was still noticeably below 100 percent, but he did a much better job molding the Warriors’ offense without some of the mistakes that plagued him this series. He ended up 4-for-8 in the restricted area which is somewhat more successful as a percentage, but far more notable as a number. Additionally, he attempted 10 free throws in the game, though only two of those came in the first three quarters. Just as during the regular season, Curry’s free throw attempts were padded by being the go-to foul shooter when the other team trailed late.\n\nInterestingly, Curry got the first-quarter rest usually given to Klay Thompson but then did not return until three minutes had elapsed in the second quarter. Their lead went from seven to one during that span.\n\nThe other big takeaway from Game 5 was his better defensive play. While many will focus on his five steals, Curry benefitted greatly from not having to wrangle Russell Westbrook as frequently. As a smart player who once spent a fair amount of time guarding off-ball players (something he could thank former coach Mark Jackson for), Curry does a nice job as a helper and some of his best plays were in that capacity. Putting him on Andre Roberson was a major factor in Golden State’s defensive success.\n\nKlay Thompson\n\nRelevant Statline: 27 points on 8-for-21 shooting (2-for-9 from 3-point range, 9-for-10 from the line), 5 rebounds, 2 assists, +5 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 9-for-10 from the line\n\nSwitching Thompson onto Westbrook close to full-time fundamentally changed Game 5. He did a much better job making Westbrook work and challenging his shot attempts. Thompson also contested well at the rim when put in that position, which is a nice benefit of his size and intelligence.\n\nIt was another somewhat shaky offensive performance for Thompson, largely fueled by some correctable shot selection. Thompson is an excellent shooter but is still much, much better at catch-and-shoot opportunities than generating looks for himself. If you have the time, watch all of his attempts and notice how differently he does at capitalizing on openings rather than forcing things himself. Thompson may eventually be able to turn some of those ambitious tries into baskets but until then he should have more faith in his teammates generating open looks through the offense.\n\nOne particular area for long-term improvement would be decision-making at the end of the shot clock. Going through his looks and remembering prior games, Thompson’s struggles with the ball in his hands and five or less on the shot clock are both unsurprising and preventable. That should be a point of emphasis for him this summer, even if it becomes a few drives with passes to the paint or the opposite corner.\n\nHarrison Barnes\n\nRelevant Statline: 6 points on 2-for-7 shooting (2-for-2 from 3-point range), 1 rebound, 1 assist, 25 minutes, +12 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 25 minutes\n\nIt has to be a familiar refrain by this point. Another non-remarkable game for Barnes but the team is helped significantly by having him and played better when he was on the floor. His ability to defend multiple positions and not demand or take excessive shots helps make the entire ecosystem function smoothly.\n\nOne concerning aspect in Game 5 was Barnes’ lack of rebounding. Some of that can be attributed to defending players further out on the perimeter but he should still be mixing it up more against a team with so many capable rebounders, particularly on the offensive end.\n\nDraymond Green\n\nRelevant Statline: 11 points on 4-for-10 shooting (0-for-2 from 3-point range, 3-for-3 from the line), 13 rebounds (5 offensive), 4 assists, 2 turnovers, 4 blocks, +2 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 4 blocks\n\nAfter two terrible performances, Green looked more like himself in Game 5. He was engaged defensively and active offensively, even if that activity produced a few bad passes.\n\nGreen picked up a technical protesting a seemingly legit call and spent a few minutes in a funk, including missing Curry on a transition drive. He eventually settled down and played a nice second half.\n\nAs in the first two games at Oracle, Green protected the rim well even with more conventional assignments. He and Andrew Bogut did a great job early on making shots hard without fouling. Well, at least without them being called.\n\nAndrew Bogut\n\nRelevant Statline: 15 points on 7-for-9 shooting (1-for-2 from the line), 14 rebounds (4 offensive), 2 blocks, 2 steals, 30 minutes, +2 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 30 minutes\n\nBogut did a great job early on the defensive end, contesting shots without being called for fouls. That is pivotal against the Thunder because they have so many capable, willing drivers. He looked tired toward the end of his 8 1/2 minute stint and for good reason. Bogut continued that positive momentum with an excellent second half, including a huge block and some quality passes.\n\nHis quality play carried over to the second half. Bogut’s 15 points were certainly a welcome surprise, but far from the core of his value. The Thunder were just 8-for-18 in the restricted area and 7-for-19 in the paint outside the restricted area in Game 5, which should be considered a defensive triumph.\n\nAndre Iguodala\n\nRelevant Statline: 8 points on 3-for-5 shooting (1-for-2 from 3-point range), 1 rebound, 8 assists, 1 turnover, 34 minutes, +7 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 8 assists, 1 turnover\n\nThis was the closest to a standard Andre Iguodala game in this series. He did a nice job picking his spots in terms of shooting and was responsible with the ball, dishing out eight assists with only one turnover. Iguodala does the best job of any of the Warriors’ ballhandlers of keeping within himself in terms of passing. He rarely makes the overly aggressive decisions Curry and Green do, which helps keep everything under control.\n\nIguodala did a solid job on Kevin Durant, who still got his fair share of points but spent less time in the lane and at the free throw line, which is a substantial victory for the Warriors. Staying more conventional and having Thompson on Westbrook more often likely helped make the assignment more workable.\n\nShaun Livingston\n\nRelevant Statline: 6 points on 3-for-6 shooting, 2 assists, 1 turnover, 14 minutes, +3 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: +9 in the fourth quarter (4:03 played)\n\nWhile his first-half stint was somewhat unremarkable, Shaun Livingston played a key role in the Warriors’ big run to start the fourth quarter. He provided solid defense and had a hand in all but one basket with four points and two assists. Game 6 could swing on those minutes where the starters sit so Livingston could figure prominently in how it all turns out.\n\nMarreese Speights\n\nRelevant Statline: 14 points on 4-for-7 shooting (1-for-1 from 3-point range, 5-for-5 from the line), 2 rebounds (both offensive), 9 minutes, +7 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: +7\n\nGame 5 was unquestionably Marreese Speights’ high point of the series. Along with hitting a 3-pointer, he contributed all his signature elements and did a great job getting to the line, which is not exactly one of his usual strengths. Getting minutes against Enes Kanter certainly brought out the best in Speights, who victimized the defensively challenged center for two “and-ones.”\n\nAnother common Speights play that was in full force was his ability to draw a charge. He induced two offensive foul calls on “pass and crash” plays, where the offensive player runs into someone after he has given up the ball. It is one of my least favorite calls in the modern NBA, but Speights does an excellent job using the rule to his advantage.\n\nFestus Ezeli\n\nRelevant Statline: 2 points (2-for-2 from the line), 1 rebound, 4 minutes, +0 plus/minus\n\nKey Stat: 4 minutes\n\nWarriors coach Steve Kerr turned to Anderson Varejao in the first quarter instead of Ezeli, presumably because the Warriors were already in the bonus and he did not want to tempt Thunder coach Billy Donovan into an intentional foul war. Ezeli did reasonably well in the second half with some decent contests and two made free throws which actually stopped Donovan from trying it again (which was a mistake). Shifting Speights’ minutes to the first and playing Ezeli at the start of the second would have made more sense but Speights did well then so it will be hard to criticize the coach, even if it was not the right reaction."
