        "text": "The 2019 NBA free agency period opened a little over a week ago with a chaotic start. Although there was no shortage of deals reached, players couldn't officially sign contracts with teams until July 6 -- when the Moratorium period ended. The most recent news was perhaps the biggest, with top free agent Kawhi Leonard reportedly agreeing to join the Los Angeles Cilppers, who have also reportedly traded for Paul George from the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nWith George being moved, the Thunder also reportedly agreed to trade star guard Russell Westbrook to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Chris Paul and a pair of first round picks.\n\nThis year's free agency has been one of the biggest and most eventful in a while. Several marquee free agents have already departed from their current teams, including two-time Finals MVP Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving, who are both taking their talents to Brooklyn. Additionally, Jimmy Butler will be relocating from Philadelphia to South Beach, while Al Horford left Boston for South Philly. Not to mention there will be a second tier of star free agents who will be intensely pursued, including established veteran names.\n\nWith plenty of players already off of the market, here are the latest rumors and updates that you need to know now that free agency is officially underway.\n\nKoufos receiving interest from four teams\n\nWhile no deal seems imminent at this time, free agent big man Kosta Koufos is receiving interest from Detroit, Sacramento, Toronto and Milwaukee, according to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports.\n\nNwaba signs on with the Nets\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets added another guard to their roster on Sunday morning.
