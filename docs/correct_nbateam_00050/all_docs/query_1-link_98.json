        "text": "When: Wednesday, 01 April 2015 at 7:00 PM CST\n\nWhere: Chesapeake Energy Arena, Oklahoma City, OK\n\nExactly a week ago, in the preview of the Oklahoma City Thunder’s game against the San Antonio Spurs, I wrote that if the Thunder had visions of getting higher than the 8th seed, then that game would be one of the more important ones remaining in the regular season. The Thunder then proceeded to crap the bed in San Antonio (and in Utah two nights later), thus killing any chance the Thunder had of catching the Spurs. But, lo and behold, a week later, the Thunder find themselves in the exact same position. The Thunder currently sit three games back of the Dallas Mavericks with 8 games to play. Win tonight and that number goes down to 2, with Dallas facing a tough schedule in their next 4 games (v. Memphis, Golden State, Phoenix, and @Denver). While Oklahoma City’s schedule isn’t necessarily a cake walk either, the possibility is there for the Thunder to make up some ground.\n\nThis will be the 4th and final meeting of the season between these two cross-state rivals. The Mavericks currently lead the season series 2-1, with each team winning on their respective home floors.\n\nThe Opponent\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks come into the game with a 45-29 record, good for 7th in the Western Conference. They boast one of the top offenses in the league (3rd in points per game at 104.1 and 5th in offensive rating), while having a middle of the road defense (21st in opponents’ points per game at 100.9 and 17th in defensive rating). The team has struggled in finding consistency since acquiring Rajon Rondo from Boston on December 20th. Before Rondo, the Mavs were 19-8. Since then, they are just 26-21. Dallas was hoping to get the Rondo that dominated in Boston from 2009-2012. Instead, they’ve gotten the “not fully recovered from knee surgery” version that still believes he’s one of the top point guards in the league. The chemistry between Rondo and back-court mate Monta Ellis has been shaky, at best. From the beginning of the season through January 31st, Ellis averaged 20.5 points per game on 46.1% FG shooting. In February and March, Ellis’ numbers slipped to 16.4 points on 40.2% FG shooting. Some of that could possibly be attributed to a buildup of nagging injuries, but a lot of that has to do with the apparent bad fit of Rondo and Ellis. After struggling a bit in the beginning of the season, Chandler Parsons’ numbers have begun to climb as his role has increased within the flow of the Dallas offense. Even though he’s getting long in the tooth, Dirk Nowitzki is still someone you have to game plan for and not leave open in critical situations. Up front, Tyson Chandler is still churning out double-doubles, averaging 10 points and 11.4 rebounds per game. The Dallas bench is full of crafty vets like JJ Barea, Amar’e Stoudemire, Devin Harris, and Richard Jefferson.\n\nProbable Starting Line-Ups\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nPG – Rajon Rondo\n\nSG – Monta Ellis\n\nSF – Chandler Parsons\n\nPF – Dirk Nowitzki\n\nC – Tyson Chandler\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nPG – Russell Westbrook\n\nSG – Dion Waiters\n\nSF – Kyle Singler\n\nPF – Enes Kanter\n\nC – Steven Adams\n\nThree Things\n\n1. Defense on Nowitzki – There are three players on the Thunder that can effectively guard Nowitzki. And all three (Kevin Durant, Nick Collison, and Serge Ibaka) are injured. Hell, the wild card that has been used on stretch 4’s to close out games recently, Andre Roberson, is also on the mend. That leaves the Thunder in a bit of pickle in terms of defending Dirk. Put Kanter or Mitch McGary on him, and the Mavs will either pick and pop him to death on the perimeter or drive around him to the basket. Adams would probably be the best choice, but putting him on the perimeter can cause problems for the Thunder defense. Perry Jones is too undisciplined and Kyle Singler, who performed admirably against Markieff Morris in the second half of the Suns’ game, would likely be too short. It may turn into a difficult game against Nowitzki.\n\n2. Transition – One thing that usually trumps age is speed. With Westbrook leading the charge, the Thunder should be aiming to get a ton of points in transition. This will keep the Dallas defense off-kilter and will allow Westbrook to not only find openings into the paint, but also find open teammates. We lose this game if Westbrook doesn’t get his assist total into the double digits.\n\n3. Hack-a-Rondo – Thunder coach Scott Brooks has never shied away from using the Hack-a-(player) ploy to try to get back into games. Since arriving in Dallas, Rondo is shooting just 39.4% from the FT line. If the Thunder find themselves in a close game in the 4th quarter, look for them to deploy this tactics on Rondo.\n\nWhen: Sunday, 28 December 2014 at 6:30 PM CST\n\nWhere: American Airlines Center, Dallas, TX\n\nTo a point guard, the Western Conference has to feel like a field littered with land mines. At the end of that field, is a championship trophy. But, at every step, you are bound to encounter a detonation. All the land mines come in different sizes with different modes of exploding. And if it wasn’t bad enough, the Dallas Mavericks, who had some of the dullest land mines on the field, went and added another shiny land mine to the field. If this was David Stern’s vision of a handcheck-less NBA, well then, mission accomplished.\n\nThis is the first of four meetings between these two teams. The Mavericks won the season series last year 2-1. The first two games weren’t very close, but the third was an overtime game that Dallas eventually won. Because of locale, these games carry a little more meaning than most NBA games around here. It’s almost like the Red River Rivalry of basketball.\n\nThe Opponent\n\nThe Dallas Mavericks currently have a 21-10 record, good for 5th in the Western Conference. They sport the best scoring offense in the league at 109.4 points per game and the 2nd best offense in terms of offensive rating. Their current starting line-up is considered to be one of the best, if not the best, in the NBA. The defense, though, is in the bottom third of the league in terms of defensive rating and points allowed. They score a lot, but they also allowed a lot. Leading the Dallas attack is the newly acquired Rajon Rondo. After showing that he had recovered sufficiently enough from an ACL tear from two seasons ago and a hand injury at the beginning of this season, the Mavericks made the move to obtain Rondo from the Celtics. In his first 4 games with Dallas, Rondo is averaging 13.3 points, 6.3 rebounds, 8.8 assists, and 1.8 steals, whiling helping the Mavericks to a 2-2 record in that span. At the other guard, Monta Ellis’ production has seemed to wane since the arrival of Ronda. Ellis was used to being a high-usage guard that could work with the ball in his hands. Now, he’s truly an off-guard playing off the ball. It’ll be interesting to see how that dynamics works itself out. At the forward spot, Chandler Parsons is giving the Mavericks basically the same thing he gave the Houston Rockets in his first 3 seasons there: good perimeter shooting and the ability to drive when covered closely on the perimeter. At the other forward spot, Dirk Nowitzki is a lot like another ageless power forward, Tim Duncan. You think they are going to eventually slow down, but they continue performing at the same level they have for the past 5 seasons, except more efficiently. In the middle, Tyson Chandler provides shot blocking and a great target for the pick and roll. While the Rondo trade may have strengthened the starting unit, it also weakened the bench. Gone are Brandan Wright, Jameer Nelson, and Jae Crowder. The bench now consists mainly of veterans near the end of their careers: Charlie Villanueva, Devin Harris, and Richard Jefferson.\n\nProbable Starting Line-ups\n\nDallas Mavericks\n\nPG – Rajon Rondo\n\nSG – Monta Ellis\n\nSF – Chandler Parsons\n\nPF – Dirk Nowitzki\n\nC – Tyson Chandler\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nPG – Russell Westbrook\n\nSG – Andre Roberson\n\nSF – Perry Jones\n\nPF – Serge Ibaka\n\nC – Steven Adams\n\n3 Keys to the Game\n\n1. Perimeter Defense – The dribble drive ability of Rondo and Ellis will open up opportunities for Chandler off of pick and rolls and for the bevy of shooters on the perimeter. It will be extremely important for Westbrook, Roberson, and Reggie Jackson to stay in front of their man and prevent any penetration.\n\n2. Transition Opportunities – With the long ball comes long rebounds and transition opportunities. Dallas isn’t necessarily a quick team with stellar athletes, so this may be a phase of the game where the Thunder can take advantage.\n\n3. Bench – The Thunder bench has taken a bit of a hit lately due to its inconsistent play. With Dallas’ weakened bench, look for the Thunder reserves to assert themselves early in this game.\n\nAtlantic Division Preview\n\n1. Toronto Raptors\n\nLast season: 48-34 (1st in the Atlantic Division, 3rd in the Eastern Conference)\n\nSeason ended: Game 7, 1st round of the Eastern Conference playoffs against the Brooklyn Nets\n\nKey additions:\n\nBruno Caboclo – Draft (No. 20 pick in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nJordan Hamilton – Free agent signing\n\nJames Johnson – Free agent signing\n\nLucas Nogueira – Obtained in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks\n\nLou Williams – Obtained in a trade with the Atlanta Hawks\n\nKey departures:\n\nJohn Salmons – Traded to the Atlanta Hawks\n\nSteve Novak – Traded to the Utah Jazz\n\nSeason Preview – The Toronto Raptors are in prime position to build off the most successful season in franchise history. The young nucleus of Kyle Lowry, DeMar Derozan, Jonas Valanciunas, Amir Johnson, and Terrence Ross is intact and a year older, with Derozan and Valanciunas having just participated in the FIBA World Cup. The Raptors acquired Lou Williams from the Hawks to serve as their offensive firepower off the bench. And they are also developing two Brazilian big men (Caboclo and Nogueria) who may pay dividends in 2015-16.\n\n2014-15 will be successful if: The Raptors make it to the 2nd round of the Eastern Conference playoffs and have at least 2 All-Stars.\n\nProjected 2014-15 Record: 52-30\n\n2. New York Knicks\n\nLast season: 37-45 (3rd in the Atlantic Division, 9th in the Eastern Conference)\n\nSeason ended: Last day of the regular season\n\nKey additions:\n\nQuincy Acy – Obtained in a trade with the Sacramento Kings\n\nJose Calderon – Obtained in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks\n\nSamuel Dalembert – Obtained in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks\n\nCleanthony Early – Draft (No. 34 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nShane Larkin – Obtained in a trade with the Dallas Mavericks\n\nJason Smith – Free agent signing\n\nKey departures:\n\nTyson Chandler – Traded to the Dallas Mavericks\n\nRaymond Felton – Traded to the Dallas Mavericks\n\nSeason Preview – Two of the biggest additions for the team have been Phil Jackson (president of basketball operations) and Derek Fisher (head coach). With Carmelo Anthony in the fold for the next 4 seasons guaranteed and plenty of cap space coming up in 2015-16, the Knicks are starting to look like they have a plan. Fisher will likely implement the triangle offense, which will play off the scoring abilities of Anthony and JR Smith to maximize the effect of role players like Calderon, Amare Stoudemire, and Tim Hardaway Jr. It will be a bit of a transition year, but in the weak Eastern Conference, the Knicks will have the ability to make the playoffs.\n\n2014-15 will be successful if: The Knicks make the playoffs.\n\nProjected 2014-15 Record: 43-39\n\n3. Brooklyn Nets\n\nLast season: 44-38 (2nd in the Atlantic Division, 6th in the Eastern Conference)\n\nSeason ended: Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semi-finals against the Miami Heat\n\nKey Additions:\n\nBojan Bogdanovic – Signed Eurostash\n\nMarkel Brown – Draft (No. 44 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nJarrett Jack – Obtained in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nSergey Karasev – Obtained in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nKey departures:\n\nPaul Pierce – Signed with the Washington Wizards\n\nAndray Blatche – Unsigned\n\nShaun Livingston – Signed with the Golden State Warriors\n\nMarcus Thornton – Traded to the Boston Celtics\n\nSeason Preview – The Brooklyn Nets seem to be on the cusp of a rebuild (reload?). Their “all in” move from last offseason (acquiring Pierce, Kevin Garnett, and Jason Terry from the Celtics) did not pan out and the Nets now find themselves with only one of the those 3 still on the roster. Brook Lopez (foot) and Deron Williams (both ankles) are once again coming into the season recovering from surgeries, and Garnett seems to know the end of his career is near. The Nets have some good young role players in Mason Plumlee, Bogdanovic, Karasev, and Teague, but their star players are either at the end of their run or are injury-prone.\n\n2014-15 will be successful if: The Nets make the playoffs\n\nProjected 2014-15 Record: 40-42\n\n4. Boston Celtics\n\nLast season: 25-57 (4th in the Atlantic Division, 12th in the Eastern Conference)\n\nSeason ended: Last day of the regular season\n\nKey Additions:\n\nMarcus Smart – Draft (No. 6 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nMarcus Thornton – Obtained in a trade with the Brooklyn Nets\n\nEvan Turner – Free agent signing\n\nJames Young – Draft (No. 17 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nTyler Zeller – Obtained in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nKey Departures:\n\nKris Humphries – Signed with the Washington Wizards\n\nJerryd Bayless – Signed with the Milwaukee Bucks\n\nSeason Preview – The Celtics are in the beginnings of a rebuild and would like nothing more than to use this season to get their young core (Smart, Young, Kelly Olynyk, Jared Sullinger, and Avery Bradley) plenty of development and playing time together. Along with that, the team has two valuable expiring contracts in Rajon Rondo and Brandon Bass to help out in their rebuilding process.\n\n2014-15 will be successful if: The young players show progression and the Celtics end up with a Top 7 pick.\n\nProjected 2014-15 Record: 23-59\n\n5. Philadelphia 76ers\n\nLast season: 19-63 (5th in the Atlantic Division, 14th in the Eastern Conference)\n\nSeason ended: Last day of the regular season\n\nKey Additions:\n\nJoel Embiid – Draft (No. 3 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nDario Saric – Draft (No. 12 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nJerami Grant – Draft (No. 39 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nLuc Richard Mbah a Moute – Obtained in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nKJ McDaniels – Draft (No. 32 in the 2014 NBA Draft)\n\nAlexy Shved – Obtained in a trade with the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nKey Departures:\n\nThaddeus Young – Traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nSeason Preview – I’ve never seen a more obvious tank job in my life. The entire being of the 76ers at this point is to collect draft picks and young players at whatever cost. That’s not necessarily a bad plan, but everyone else who has done has at least attempted to look like they were trying. They drafted 2 players in the first round in the last draft that likely will not play for the organization this season (Embiid and Saric). This will be Nerlens Noel’s rookie season and last season’s Rookie of the Year, Michael Carter-Williams, is coming off off-season shoulder surgery. The team traded its best veteran in Thad Young and heads into the season as one of the youngest teams in the league.\n\n2014-15 will be successful if: The 76ers end up with a Top 3 pick and their young players continue to develop.\n\nProjected 2014-15 Record: 12-70\n\nWhen: Friday, 24 January 2014 at 6:30 PM CST\n\nWhere: TD Garden, Boston, MA\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder find themselves in a precarious situation. They’ve just scorched the earth with 4 of the top 6 teams in the Western Conference, but now head out East to play two of the lower tier teams in the league. Add to that the fact that the Thunder may be looking forward to Thursday night’s romp against the Miami Heat, and this sets up perfectly as a trap game candidate.\n\nThis is the second meeting of the season between these two teams. The Thunder defeated the Boston Celtics in the first game, 119-96. In that game, Reggie Jackson destroyed the Celtics, setting a then career high with 27 points on 9-12 shooting from the field.\n\nThe Opponent\n\nFor most teams wear losing records like a scarlett letter. But the Celtics have much to be proud of, regardless of how their 15-29 record looks. This is a team that completely gutted it’s roster in the offseason, trading mainstays Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Jason Terry to the Brooklyn Nets. In addition, star PG Rajon Rondon was out until recently, recovering from a torn ACL. To say that this team has overachieved would be an understatement. They struggle scoring, but have a top 10 defense in terms of opponent’s points per game. The Celtics are led by Rondo, who is playing in his 4th game back since returning from injury. Veteran Gerald Wallace has had to play out of position due to injuries to many of the SG on the roster. Jeff Green, Jared Sullinger, and Brandon Bass provide the Celtics with their biggest position of strength at forward. Green is able to provide a perimeter game, Sullinger does most of his business in the paint, and Bass excels at the mid-range game. The bench is nearly non-existent due to bevy of injuries.\n\nProbable Starting Line-Ups\n\nBoston Celtics\n\nPG – Rajon Rondo\n\nSG – Gerald Wallace\n\nSF – Jeff Green\n\nPF – Jared Sullinger\n\nC – Kris Humphries\n\nOklahoma City Thunder\n\nPG – Reggie Jackson\n\nSG – Thabo Sefolosha\n\nSF – Kevin Durant*\n\nPF – Serge Ibaka\n\nC – Kendrick Perkins\n\n* – Durant is listed as questionable due to a shoulder injury\n\n3 Keys to the Game\n\n1. Post defense – The Celtics rank near the bottom of the league in 3-point FG’s made and 3-point FG%. If they are going to do damage, it will be on the inside with Bass, Sullinger, and Humphries. It’ll be up to the Thunder big men to stay disciplined on the boards and defend the paint.\n\n2. Jeff Green – Green is the only player on the Celtics capable of catching fire and taking over. He did it in their last game against the Wizards, going off for 39 points on 8-16 shooting from 3-point land. Contain Green and the Celtics struggle to score.\n\n3. Bench – With the Celtics’ struggles with injury, their bench has been decimated. It’ll be a good game for Jeremy Lamb, Nick Collison, and Perry Jones to enforce their will.\n\nSo, I was perusing through the internets and came across this article from Yahoo!Sports, http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/news?slug=ycn-10388361 . In the article, written by William Menna, it talks about the top 5 point guards in Oklahoma City Thunder history. Before even reading the article, I thought to myselft, “Wow, 3 years in, and we already have a Top 5 point guards in franchise history article. Let me see, Westbrook, Maynor, Watson, Ivey, and Ollie.” Kind of scraping the bottom of the barrell at the end of that list. But then I started reading the article and starting seeing names like Gary Payton, Lenny Wilkens, Gus Johnson, etc. It is then that I realized, “Crap, they are including the Seattle Sonics’s stats also.”\n\nI’m one of those people that has a problem with the combining of Sonics and Thunder history. Its like going through an acrimonious divorce and having your new wife constantly bring up things about your old wife. You just don’t want to listen to it. Let it be known, though, that I have no problem with the emotions being felt by true Sonics fans. Those guys were left without a team and that part of the equation, in my opinion, is just wrong. Especially when its the little guys (a.k.a the fans) that suffer the most. In the 5 years that this team has been on OKC’s radar, I’ve felt every range of emotion towards Seattle and its fans. But, if this lockout has taught me anything, its that, in the grand scheme of things, we’re quite inconsequential. The other thing that it has made me realize is that missing basketball games sucks ass.\n\nIn reading this article, I realized the list of OKC Thunder point guards may be quite small, but the list of combined OKC Hornets and Thunder point guards can be enough to make a respectable Top 5 list. Yeah, you remember those OKC Hornets teams, right? The ones that played a combined 71 of 82 home games in the state of Oklahoma in 2 seasons spanning from November 2005 to April 2007. Here’s some pictures to remind you:\n\nUsing these 5 seasons of Oklahoma City basketball, here’s the list of the Top 5 point guards in OKC basketball history.\n\nDisclaimer: Combo guards will also be included as point guards. They are just point guards that primarily score, anyways.\n\n5. Speedy Claxton (OKC Hornets ’05-’06):\n\nIn his one season in Oklahoma City, Claxton provided good veteran leadership off the bench while mentoring the rookie Chris Paul. He averaged 12.3 points, 4.8 assists, and 1.5 steals per game. Though about 4 inches shorter than Chris Paul, he was sometimes inserted in the lineup as the shooting guard in small ball situations.\n\n4. Eric Maynor (OKC Thunder ’09-’10 – present):\n\nMaynor has been the guiding touch for the second unit off the bench in each of his seasons with the Thunder. He is the antithesis to Russell Westbrook and provides a nice semblance of change when in the game. He has averaged 4.5 points and 3.1 assists in his 2 seasons with the Thunder and continues to improve and build upon his national acclaim as best back-up point guard in the game.\n\n3. Bobby Jackson (OKC Hornets ’06-’07):\n\nBrought in to replace Speedy Claxton, Bobby Jackson brought an instant spark off the bench as one of the premier combo guards in the league. Used primarily as a point guard, Jackson’s quickness helped the Hornets whether the storm of losing their best 3 players for the 1st quarter of the season to stay afloat for enough time to contend for a playoff spot until the final week of the season. His averages of 10.6 points and 2.5 assists don’t measure how valuable Jackson was for that team that season.\n\n2. Russell Westbrook (OKC Thunder ’08-’09 – present):\n\nOne of the most dynamic players in the league, Westbrook (along with Derrick Rose and John Wall) is redefining what a point guard is in the league. This is what the game envisioned when it inserted the Hand Check rule before the ’04-’05 season. Someone that constantly puts pressure on the defense, while working his way into the lane. While still a work in progress, Westbrook has averaged 17.8 points, 7.1 assists, 4.8 rebounds, and 1.5 steals per game in his career, increasing his points, assists, and steals averages every season. In his young career, he has already made an All Star game, been named to 2nd team All-NBA, won a World Championship gold medal, and led a team to the Western Conference finals. Although he is still learning the nuances of the position, there is no doubt that if his career trajectory continues in a similar fashion, he may undoubtly wrestle the No. 1 spot from this guy…\n\n1. Chris Paul (OKC Hornets ’05-’06 – ’06-’07)\n\nThe current gold standard for NBA point guards, Chris Paul started off his career as a member of Your Hometown Hornets, becoming Oklahoma City’s only Rookie of the Year recipient. While still in the traditional point guard mold, Chris Paul was the beginning in a breed of point guards that do most of their damage driving to the hole and breaking the defense down while in the paint. Owning, probably, the best court vision in the league, Paul has led the league in assists twice and averaged close to double figures for his career. In it, he has averaged 18.7 points, 9.9 assists, 4.6 boards, and 2.4 steals in 6 seasons. He is the only player in league history to lead the league in assists and steals in the same season for 2 consecutive seasons. That’s John Stockton territory right there. He’s been named to 4 All Star games, 1 All-NBA team, 1 All-Defensive First team, has won 1 Olympic gold medal, and has been to 1 Western Conference Championship. Although injuries derailed Paul the last few seasons, he seems to be getting over that and getting back to his elite form.\n\nThe only negative part to most “Top 5 Whatevers Within the same Franchise” is that you’ll probaby never see any of the players on the list play against each other. You’ll never get to see Rajon Rondo vs. Bob Cousy. Or Yao Ming vs. Hakeem Olajuwon. But the great thing about this list is that you will hopefully see Westbrook and Paul duke it out for the better part of their primes for the next decade. And the only reason they’ll be duking it out, is for OKC point guard supremacy, right?"
