        "text": "(AP Photo/Sue Ogrocki)\n\nKevin Durant will be a Warrior.\n\nThe Oklahoma City free agent announced on The Players Tribune he will be leaving the Thunder to move to the Bay Area. The Warriors’ three-year plans to woo Durant and pair him with two-time MVP Stephen Curry results in one of the biggest free agent acquisitions in NBA history.\n\nDurant, the former MVP and four-time scoring champ, joins a Warriors core that won 140 games the last two seasons and were minutes away from back-to-back championships. Durant is not allowed to sign until the NBA moratorium ends on July 7, but when he does theWarriors willhave four current All-NBA players in Durant, Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green.\n\nDurant, a free agent, met with six teams over the weekend in the Hamptons area of Long Island in New York. The incumbent Thunder, the Warriors, the Los Angeles Clippers, the San Antonio Spurs, Miami Heat and Boston Celtics all had a chance to pitch Durant. The Thunder closed with a second meeting.\n\nSeveral sources said it was down to the Warriors and Thunder. Golden State sent four players — Curry, Thompson, Green and Andre Iguodala — along with CEO Joe Lacob, general manager Bob Myers and coach Steve Kerr. Durant called and talked to NBA legend Jerry West, and executive board member, on Saturday night.\n\nThe Warriors invited Durant to come make history with them. And though Oklahoma City, which raised Durant from college prodigy to Hall of Fame candidate, was pegged as the heavy favorites to keep Durant. But the Warriors’ offer proved too good to pass up.\n\nDurant has had his eye on the Warriors for some time, per sources. He built a relationship with Curry, Thompson and Iguodala with Team USA in 2010. Durant, Curry and Iguodala have a connection as men of faith, and Draymond Green and Durant have grown friendly over the years.\n\nThe Warriors added to that by becoming a power in the Western Conference with a style of play that fits Durant’s game. The Warriors’ ball-movement, shooting and transition game plays to his strengths. And with three other All-Stars, Durant won’t have to carry as large a burden as he did in Oklahoma City.\n\nThe Warriors are also willing to spend. They are based in a booming area of the country, which is good for Durant’s manifold business interests. And they are planning to move into a state of the art arena in 2019.\n\nOklahoma City is an elite team in the Western Conference with Durant. But the Thunder has failed to capture that elusive title despite having two of the league’s best players in Durant and Russell Westbrook.\n\nOklahoma City reached the NBA Finals in 2012, but followed by trading key piece James Harden to Houston in part to avoid paying three huge salaries. Since that move, Oklahoma City has struggled to rediscover that third piece of the puzzle.\n\nOklahoma City looked to be headed back to the Finals in May, when they had the Warriors down 3-1 in the Western Conference Finals. But the Thunder squandered that golden opportunity, continuing a trend of falling just short despite looking for stretches as good as it ever has.\n\nDurant was expected by many to return and try to finish the job, deliver Oklahoma City that championship. But Westbrook is a free agent next season and could leave, which meant the Thunder’s run as a contender might have had but one more year anyway.\n\nInsiders said Durant only wanted to go through this free agency process once. And with the Thunder’s long-term future being uncertain, he took the chance to be historic. He joined the team with a chance to win multiple titles and be considered among the best ever.\n\nTo make room for Durant, the Warriors willpart ways with Harrison Barnes.The fifth-year small forward — who doubled as power forward in the Warriors’ vaunted Death Lineup andcame up big in several big playoff games in the route to the 2015 championship — is a free agent and the Warriors must renounce his rights.\n\nThe Warriorsare also going to renounce their rights to Festus Ezeli, also a free agent, as well as Marreese Speights, Brandon Rush and Leandro Barbosa. The Warriors will also have to trade Andrew Bogut to a team with salary cap space to shed his contract.\n\nThe Warriors will need to find a center to fit into the top of their rotation:Curry, Thompson, Durant, Green, Iguodala and Shaun Livingston. The Warriors also have 2015 first-round pick Kevan Looney, 2016 first-round pick Damian Jones and 2016 second-round pick Patrick McCaw."
