        "text": "Here are my player reviews for each Warrior from Monday night’s 96-88 Game 7 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nStephen Curry\n\nRelevant statline: 36 points on 13-for-24 shooting (7-for-12 from 3-point range), 8 assists, 3 turnovers, 5 rebounds, +18 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: 24 points on 8-for-13 shooting (5-for-9 from three) and +18 in the second half\n\nIn the first half, Stephen Curry’s play was pretty much in line with most of what we have seen in this series. He did well on some switches in what is still a jarring change after years of struggling against size but also struggled inside the arc, making just one of his three shots at the rim. Curry’s defense was solid but the Warriors gave him manageable assignments to keep his workload reasonable.\n\nBut that all changed in the third quarter. Curry started aggressively attacking switches and feeling more comfortable taking tough shots, including a rainbow over Steven Adams. That performance carried over into the fourth, when Curry came as close to his MVP form as he has since spraining his MCL in the Rockets series. He looked more confident on ball and was a constant threat in a way he simply was not earlier in the series. That extra attention also helped open up looks for other players, including one missed Klay Thompson three-pointer where one defender was too fixated on Curry to fight through a screen. The performance climaxed in a quintessentially Curry moment: when the Thunder decided not to foul, he probed around the front court and even faked a layup before trotting back out to the three point line. He put a move on Roberson and nailed the three to effectively end the game and the series.\n\nKlay Thompson\n\nRelevant statline: 21 points on 7-for-19 shooting (6-for-11 from 3-point range), 5 rebounds, -2 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: Russell Westbrook’s 7-for-21 from the field and four free throw attempts\n\nAfter carrying the team for large stretches of Game 6, Klay Thompson’s shot left him in the early part of Game 7. He still did a solid job defensively but could not convert looks he often makes. Of course, that happens from time to time for Thompson and he ended up putting together a respectable offensive performance despite a few bad shots and a few unusual misses.\n\nChanging up the defensive assignments gave Thompson a much larger workload on that end, but he did well challenging Russell Westbrook in terms of both shots and free throw attempts. The rest of the team provided help defense when necessary but Thompson contained Westbrook for the most part and some of his makes were shots opponents just have to be OK with.\n\nThe concept of a two-way player gets too much ink in basketball media today but players who can be reliably positive on offense and defense are huge in terms of team building and even more so if they can be a stronger plus on either end. Thompson’s performance in the playoffs so far has proven his mettle as a pivotal player in Golden State’s remarkable success.\n\nAndre Iguodala\n\nRelevant statline: 7 points on 3-for-7 shooting (1-for-4 from three), 4 rebounds, 3 assists, 1 turnover, 43 minutes, +1 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: 43 minutes\n\nShifting from the sixth man slot to starting completely changes things for Andre Iguodala. While he will always be a key anchor for the defense, playing with the starters turns him from a central ballhandler and playmaker to a catch-and-shoot guy who sometimes has to make the right decision with the ball. That reduction in intensity works well because guarding Kevin Durant had to be Iguodala’s No. 1 priority. While Durant’s final line looks good after a fourth quarter explosion, Iguodala spent most of the game limiting his shots and preventing him from getting to the free throw line. Durant ended the game with only four free throw attempts, less than half his series average.\n\nIt is remarkable to see Iguodala shift from his typical role of team defender to one-on-one shutdown assignments. He still uses quick hands to force deflections and turnovers but Iguodala’s help instincts are marginalized. That said, slowing down Durant is a far more important task against a star-driven team like the Thunder so the assignment and role make complete sense.\n\nDraymond Green\n\nRelevant statline: 11 points on 5-for-14 shooting (1-for-5 from 3-point range), 9 rebounds, 4 assists, 2 turnovers, 2 blocks, +3 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: The Thunder shot 15-for-43 (34.9 percent) in the paint\n\nWhile not a bad game by any stretch of the imagination, Game 7 was not a dominant Draymond Green performance. He played solid defense (the Thunder were just 14-for-30 in the restricted area and 1-for-13 in the paint outside the restricted area) and hit a few open shots but he was not the destroyer that helped carry this historic team throughout the season.\n\nAt some level, that is a sign of progress for the Warriors as a team. Green was the team’s second most valuable player during the regular season and a reliable bellwether for their overall performance. He will still play an integral role for the team but the lack of dependence coincides with Thompson’s stronger performances and makes life even harder on opponents. After the game, Green talked about how he needs to work on defense regardless of whether the shots are falling and that will hold true in the next round. Cleveland’s personnel and defensive choices may also bring back the Curry/Green pick and rolls that terrorized the league all season.\n\nAndrew Bogut\n\nRelevant statline: 2 points on 1-for-2 shooting, 3 rebounds, 15 minutes, -2 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: 3:17 played in the second half\n\nWhile he didn’t start the series this way, Andrew Bogut’s role eventually ended up shifting to something more similar to last year’s NBA Finals. He struggled immensely with Adams’ physicality crashing the offensive glass and was not the reliable rim protector he was at other times in the series. In fact, the Thunder rebounded half of their misses during Bogut’s time on the floor. Oklahoma City’s multi-player attack on the glass is not the same as what Cleveland typically throws out, but that will be something to watch.\n\nHarrison Barnes\n\nRelevant statline: 5 points on 2-for-6 shooting (1-for-4 from 3-point range), 8 rebounds, 2 assists, 2 seals, 22 minutes, +9 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: 8 rebounds in 22 minutes\n\nHarrison Barnes’ contributions changed substantially after shifting from spending serious minutes with the starters to primarily a bench role. He will not get as many reliable scoring chances in minutes without Curry but played with great energy. Barnes’ eight rebounds were a playoff high despite Game 7 being his shortest playing time of the entire playoffs. In fact, the last time Barnes played 22 minutes or less was the first game against the Spurs way back in January. While we like to think everyone will work their hardest no matter what, Barnes deserves credit for handling his role change without making any waves and while still providing quality minutes. He will need to do the same against Cleveland if Iguodala can handle the workload.\n\nShaun Livingston\n\nRelevant statline: 5 points on 2-for-4 shooting, 6 rebounds, 1 assist, 0 turnovers, 1 block, 14 minutes, +0 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: 5 third quarter points\n\nShaun Livingston’s first half was more of the same for him in this series. The Thunder did not give him a place to be on either end of the floor and he struggled to find clean looks and create for teammates. However, he had a big stretch in the third quarter that coach Steve Kerr pointed to as a swing point in the game. After rimming in a two, Livingston grabbed a defensive rebound, took the ball on the break and pushed towards the basket. The Thunder players did not protect the rim and gave him a lane, which Livingston took and got a clean dunk. To top it off, Serge Ibaka committed a lazy push to Livingston’s back, which made it a three-point play. As crazy as it may sound, that 31-second stretch was enough to provide a real positive as it got the crowd into it and broke a cold streak for the Warriors’ offense.\n\nMarreese Speights\n\nRelevant statline: 3 points on 1-for-3 shooting (1-for-1 from 3-point range), 1 rebound, 6 minutes, -6 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: One 3-pointer\n\nMo Speights ended up with two dramatically different short stints. In the second quarter, his defense on Enes Kanter was shaky but his three-pointer kept the teams about even. In the fourth quarter, Speights had two terrible offensive possessions, a bad post-up miss and an even worse botched layup when he could have dunked. Modifying the rotation by having Thompson on the floor for those early-quarter stretches should have alleviated the need for Speights but Kerr tried to make it work anyway. It will be fascinating to see what role he plays in the Finals.\n\nFestus Ezeli\n\nRelevant statline: 2 points on 1-for-3 shooting, 4 rebounds, 13 minutes, +9 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: OKC’s offensive rebound rate was 7.7 percent with Ezeli on the floor (35.1 percent otherwise)\n\nGame 7 was a pretty standard Festus Ezeli performance. He defended well and helped the Warriors stem a bad stretch of defensive rebounding but made a few mistakes on the offensive end, including missing Curry in the near corner after a third quarter offensive rebound and instead throwing the ball into the backcourt for a turnover. It is certainly understandable that Ezeli’s miscues are more frustrating for the coaching staff and teammates alike than Speights’ are, but the boost in defense and rebounding should be enough to solidify Ezeli’s role against Cleveland.\n\nAnderson Varejao\n\nRelevant statline: 2 points on 1-for-1 shooting, 2 assists, 2 minutes, +5 plus/minus\n\nKey stat: +5 in 1:51\n\nOnce again, Kerr knew exactly what buttons to push. Despite all evidence to the contrary, he put Anderson Varejao in for a big spot in the third quarter and he absolutely delivered. Two spectacularly awkward drives (one leading to a corner 3 and one a Varejao layup) and a trademark drawn charge gave the Warriors a +5 boost in less than two minutes. It happens that way sometimes."
