        "text": "The National Basketball Association champions Golden State Warriors rode a dominant third quarter to a decisive 123-95 victory over the Heat in Miami on Sunday.\n\nMiami took a 36-33 first-quarter lead despite 16 points in the period from Stephen Curry.\n\n\"When they smell blood, they go for it,\" said Miami coach Erik Spoelstra. \"So many of their guys just come alive when they start to get it rolling â each one of them becomes ignitable.\n\n\"They start foaming at the mouth when the game starts to turn.\"\n\nThe Warriors saw forward Shaun Livingston ejected in the second quarter after making contact with a game official while arguing a non-call.\n\nBut they roared ahead in the third quarter, opening the second half with a dunk from Kevin Durant en route to a 12-2 scoring run.\n\nThe Warriors outscored the Heat 37-17 in the third to take a 99-77 lead into the final frame.\n\nCurry finished with 30 points as the Warriors improved to 3-0 on their current road trip.\n\nDurant added 24 and Klay Thompson scored 19.\n\nThe Warriors seemed fired up by the ejection of Livingston, who thought he was fouled on a shot attempt and leaned in to argue with the referee. He bumped heads with the official, who also appeared to be moving forward, and was instantly sent to the locker room.\n\nGoran Dragic scored 20 points for the Heat.\n\nIn Oklahoma City, the Thunder held off the depleted San Antonio Spurs 90-87, aided by Russell Westbrook's seventh triple-double of the season.\n\nWestbrook scored 22 points with 10 rebounds and 10 assists for the Thunder, who led 90-82 before failing to score in the final 3:34.\n\nA turnover in the closing seconds gave San Antonio a chance to tie the game, but Brandon Paul missed a 3-pointer and Oklahoma City's Raymond Felton grabbed the rebound to seal it.\n\nSteven Adams added 19 points and 10 rebounds for the Thunder, whose 20 turnovers made it closer than was comfortable against a Spurs team missing Kawhi Leonard, LaMarcus Aldridge, Rudy Gay, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili.\n\nSpurs forward Kyle Anderson suffered a sprained knee when he went down hard under the basket in the third quarter. He hit the court in obvious pain and had to be helped to the locker room.\n\nIn Los Angeles, James Harden scored 36 points and handed out 9 assists, and the Houston Rockets won their sixth consecutive road game with a 118-95 victory against the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nHouston has won all six road games in the streak by at least 15 points, setting a league record.\n\nElsewhere, it was: Timberwolves 112, Clippers 106; and Magic 105, Knicks 100."
