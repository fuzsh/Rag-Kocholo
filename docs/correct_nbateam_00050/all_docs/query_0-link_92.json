        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder haven't exactly figured out the whole Big 3 concept just yet. At this point, they remain a mediocre team that hasn't come close to realizing their potential. Could something be in the works?\n\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 8 of Jumping to Conclusions takes the pulse in OKC and examines whether the Chicago Bulls' feisty forwards can co-exist.\n\nThe Thunder won't trade Paul George or fire Billy Donovan:\n\nCan you really blame Carmelo Anthony for wanting to FaceTime with his 10-year-old son rather than face all those confounding questions about these puzzling Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night?\n\nThat was Anthony’s explanation for his postgame media absence in Charlotte, where a loss to the Hornets dropped this would-be Super Team to 12-14 and left executives around the league wondering what might happen if they continue to struggle. With the Thunder facing the ill-timed Paul George reunion game in Indiana on Wednesday night, only Sam Presti knows how he sees this sensitive landscape.\n\nThe Thunder’s longtime general manager has a track record that makes it impossible to guess what will happen next. Two of his most memorable moves during this decade-long stretch of success reflect contrasting traits - the preemptive strike (the James Harden trade to Houston in Oct. 2012) and the patient play (the decision to fire coach Scott Brooks after seven seasons and years of criticism in April of 2015). Now, after Presti was justifiably celebrated for landing George and Anthony last summer, only to see their new superstar trio stumble thus far, the questions circulating in front office circles simply can’t be answered without knowing which tact he will take.\n\nWill the combination of their disjointed play and concern about George leaving for the Lakers (or elsewhere) in free agency next summer inspire Presti to trade him before the Feb. 8 trade deadline?\n\nMight coach Billy Donovan be held responsible, perhaps being fired midway through his third season because, well, the one-man offense of last season has somehow regressed from 17th in offensive rating during Westbrook’s MVP campaign to 24th this season?\n\nThe educated guess from this vantage point? Presti lets it play out on both fronts – for now.\n\nDespite the awful appearance, the internal dynamic remains – by all accounts – very positive. There has been no rotting of this superstar core, just a well-intentioned group that can’t seem to play consistently. From their respectable net rating (plus-1.2, 11th overall) to their stout defense (2nd overall), there are reasons to believe they'll turn this around.\n\nThe league is watching the George situation very closely, and there’s a general belief that the Thunder will have to act if they haven’t significantly improved a few months from now (there are 29 games left before the deadline). With every George trade inquiry – whether it’s Presti on the call or recently returned front office mate/former Orlando Magic GM Rob Hennigan, who often handles such discussions for OKC – executives will be eager to exploit the situation.\n\nAnd if that unlikely day comes? Rival executives will argue that his value is depressed because of the alive-and-well rumor he is headed for the Lakers, knowing full well that the Thunder don’t want to lose a superstar for the second time in three summers after Kevin Durant. The lack of leverage, if nothing else, could compel the Thunder to see this through until the summertime.\n\nAll-Star?Tired of trade talk, Victor Oladipo emerging as star of 'hungry' Pacers team\n\nWeek 8 NBA power rankings: Rockets hold top spot, but should Warriors be afraid?\n\nNBA MVP rankings: Kevin Durant shines in Stephen Curry's absence\n\nAs for Donovan, it’s worth remembering that Presti came up with the San Antonio Spurs as a scout. That means he understands the value of longevity, having seen the fruits of Gregg Popovich’s labor up close and learned how much stability matters. So despite the subpar results, and even with nuanced factors like the presence of an assistant coach in Adrian Griffin who has been in the running for head coaching jobs and who has also formed a productive bond with George, all signs point to Oklahoma City staying the course. (Amick)\n\nMaybe Nikola Mirotic and Bobby Portis can co-exist on the Chicago Bulls – at least for the rest of this season:\n\nWhen the two got into a scuffle at practice before the season began and Portis hit Mirotic, causing a concussion and two broken bones in Mirotic’s face, it seemed unrealistic that the Bulls could keep both. Mirotic returned three games ago and is averaging 16.3 points and shooting 54.8% from the field and 50% on three-pointers. It’s a small sample size for sure, but Mirotic is showing he can play. Portis, who was suspended for eight games, is playing well, too, at 12.4 points and 6.4 rebounds per game while shooting 48.8% from the field and 39.2% on threes.\n\nAll good?Bulls' Nikola Mirotic, Bobby Portis finding 'great chemistry' after fight\n\nRookie Power Rankings: Celtics' Tatum is leading the NBA in three-point shooting\n\nAnd while this is another small sample size at just 35 minutes, when Mirotic and Portis are on the floor together, the Bulls score 129.8 points and allow just 98.6 points per 100 possessions for a plus-31.1 net efficiency rating. Mirotic can’t be traded until Jan. 15 and maybe the Bulls ended up shipping one of the players. But Portis and Mirotic have managed to push harsh feelings aside and produce. (Zillgitt)"
