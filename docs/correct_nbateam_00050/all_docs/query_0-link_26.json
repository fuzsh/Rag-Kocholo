        "text": "Warriors point guard Shaun Livingston did not practice for the second straight day on Monday. Livingston is dealing with right foot soreness, and is questionable for Golden State's season opener against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Tuesday, the team announced on Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, point guard Stephen Curry and forward Draymond Green were not listed on the injury report. Curry skipped Sunday's practice to rehab some \"minor ailments,\" according to Warriors head coach Steve Kerr. Green played in just his second game of the preseason on Friday, after missing a couple weeks with soreness in his right knee. Kerr told reporters on Monday that Green will not have a minutes restriction in the season opener, but that the Warriors are still looking to ease him back into the lineup."
