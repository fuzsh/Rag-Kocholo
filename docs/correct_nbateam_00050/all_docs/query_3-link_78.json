        "text": "[jwplayer ypEn1ZiD-z6KDnl0B]\n\nAfter the Warriors announced Leandro Barbosa is joining Steve Kerr’s coaching staff, another member of the Golden State alumni is returning to the Bay Area.\n\nFormer guard Shaun Livingston is rejoining the organization as a member of the Warriors front office, according to Marcus Thompson II of The Athletic. Livingston will serve as director of player affairs and engagement in Golden State’s front office.\n\nLivingston will become the highest-ranking Black person in the Warriors’ front office since Mitch Richmond in 2008, per Thompson II.\n\nLivingston capped off his 15 year NBA playing career prior to the 2019-20 campaign. The 35-year-old spent the last five seasons with the Golden State Warriors, attending five consecutive NBA Finals and winning three championships.\n\nAccording to Thompson II, Livingston is slated to be the “headliner” in Golden State’s plan to work with non-traditional candidates for executive roles.\n\nVia The Athletic:\n\nLivingston, the Warriors contend, is the headliner of the Warriors’ plan to train and empower non-traditional candidates for executive positions.\n\nDuring his time in Golden State, the former first-round draft pick averaged 5.4 points on 52.0% shooting from the field with 2.4 assists and two rebounds in 17.5 minutes per game.\n\nAfter the hires of Barbosa and Livingston, Kerr chimed in on Twitter with the message, “today was a good day.”\n\nvia @SteveKerr on Twitter:\n\nAlong with five years in Golden State, the Peoria, Illinois product spent time with the Los Angeles Clippers, Miami Heat, Washington Wizards, Charlotte Bobcats, Milwaukee Bucks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Cleveland Cavaliers and Brooklyn Nets."
