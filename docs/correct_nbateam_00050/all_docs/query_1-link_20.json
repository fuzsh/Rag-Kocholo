        "text": "NBA players face tough path to front-office positions\n\nShaun Livingston could teach a course on running the break or defending the pick-and-roll in the NBA.\n\nBut ask him about the salary cap, trade exceptions, luxury tax thresholds and the like, and the veteran point guard is the first to admit he has a lot to learn.\n\n\"The cap is like an algorithm, you know what I mean?\" said Livingston, who signed as a free agent with the Brooklyn Nets in July. \"Once you really pick up and you understand that stuff, then you're creating ways that you can put together a team and structure it. What can (each team) do? Where's the (salary) room? How much room do they have? The tax situation, exceptions, how you use all the exceptions.\n\n\"There's kind of a — I forgot the term, what they called it, where you can go up to four million dollars over the tax and (still get) an exception.\"\n\nThe apron, they call it.\n\n\"Yeah, there it is,\" he said with a laugh. \"See. The apron. We're players. We just understand our contracts. We're learning all this stuff.\"\n\nAnd they're learning it out of necessity now.\n\nWith the age-old trend of hiring former players to run teams appearing to be on the serious decline, more than 20 current players who want to eventually have a role in team building gathered in Las Vegas for a three-day leadership seminar in July and have been sharpening their studies ever since as they wait for training camp to arrive. The realization is setting in, it seems, that having played in the league is hardly qualification enough to win these jobs.\n\nThe front office frontier is a world of strategies, numbers and rules that are very different from the court, where players like Livingston thrive. And as franchise values have soared, new collective bargaining agreement rules have restricted the general manager's playing field, and the focus on player analytics has grown, NBA owners have begun to rely on decision-makers whose backgrounds go well beyond basketball.\n\nOnly two of the past 15 additions of a top front-office position went to former NBA players, with three leaving the league in the process (Otis Smith in Orlando, Lance Blanks in Phoenix and Geoff Petrie in Sacramento). The recent return of Larry Bird in Indiana was not counted among that group, but there are now 11 former NBA players in prominent front office positions among the 30 teams with him back in the fold.\n\nThe most recent general manager hirings show owners are increasingly hiring respected executives who, while not former NBA players, have proven track records learning this game inside the game.\n\n• Before being hired as general manager of the Dallas Mavericks in late July, Gersson Rosas began as an intern in the Houston Rockets video department whose 10-year rise through their ranks included promotions to video coordinator, director of scouting, director of player personnel and executive vice president of basketball operations.\n\n• Rosas' former Rockets colleague, recently hired Philadelphia 76ers general manager Sam Hinkie, has an MBA from Stanford and was an integral part of the Rockets' push toward advanced statistics that has become a league-wide trend in recent years. He spent eight years with the Rockets and was the right-hand man to general manager Daryl Morey for the past six, most recently as executive vice president of basketball operations.\n\n• Pete D'Alessandro, formerly the vice president of basketball operations for the Denver Nuggets, was hired to be the Sacramento Kings general manager in June, two months after the team was purchased for a league-record $535 million valuation by Silicon Valley software magnate Vivek Ranadive. He is a highly regarded salary cap expert, law school graduate and former sports agent who was given the job instead of, among many others, former Kings point guard and current TNT analyst Kenny Smith.\n\n• After 10 years with the Boston Celtics as a basketball operations special assistant, scouting director, director of player personnel and assistant general manager, Ryan McDonough was hired as the Phoenix Suns' general manager in May.\n\n• Masai Ujiri, who came up as a scout with the Denver Nuggets and assistant general manager with the Toronto Raptors, was hired as the Raptors general manager in May after spending the past two seasons as the Nuggets' general manager. He won the NBA Executive of the Year Award last season.\n\n• Tim Connelly, who was hired as Ujiri's replacement in Denver in June, was the director of player personnel for the Washington Wizards and assistant general manager of the New Orleans Hornets previously.\n\n• After firing general manager David Kahn in early May, Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor added two more non-former NBA players to the mix: Flip Saunders, who was the Timberwolves coach from 1995 to 2005, returned as president of basketball operations. Then he hired a new general manager in Milt Newton, who spent the previous decade with the Washington Wizards and was most recently their vice president of player personnel.\n\nFormer players, in other words, are playing from behind in the general manager game these days.\n\nLivingston was thinking about life after basketball long before his peers. He's 27 now, more than six years removed from the gruesome left knee injury that nearly ended his career and forced him to start formulating his contingency plan at a far younger age than most. And while so many of his colleagues have spent this offseason hopping from one vacation destination to another or perhaps focusing only on how to improve the basketball skills that are so vital in the present, Livingston continued to lay the foundation for his future.\n\n\"Just for me to have that mind shift at that age, and find myself, try to get my career back stable again, you appreciate the opportunities that are given from the Players Association, from the NBA, and being in the NBA, to where they can open doors,\" Livingston said. \"I'm really trying to take advantage of it, and learn and soak everything in to where if I can study and meet the right people and stars can align then I can really create some good opportunities.\"\n\nAtlanta Hawks assistant general manager Wes Wilcox was one of the speakers at the July seminar put on by the National Basketball Players Association, along with McDonough, former New York Knicks and Washington Wizards executive Ed Tapscott , Oklahoma City Thunder general manager Sam Presti, and Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle, who is head of the coaches' assocation.\n\nWilcox spoke to players about the scouting process, the ins and outs of the collective bargaining rules and how they pertain to team-building, as well as his personal path from Cleveland Cavaliers advance scout to second in command for the Hawks under former NBA player Danny Ferry.\n\nWhen players were done with the classroom part of their session, they sat in the stands of UNLV and wrote scouting reports of young players who participated in summer league. The seminar was created by Brendan Suhr, the former Detroit Pistons assistant, New York Knicks executive and author of the book, \"Chuck Daly Coaching U.\"\n\n\"It's an education,\" Wilcox said. \"The more NBA players are aware of the mechanics of how the league works, how trades get put together, I think it helps them better understand their profession and maybe the realities of being in the NBA.\n\n\"These guys need to be thinking about life after basketball. Their careers are over when many of our careers — 'our' being non-player careers — are just beginning. To be amongst a group that is already thinking that, and to have an opportunity to share it with them, and hear their experiences and share yours with them, that's a pretty cool thing.\"\n\nShareef Abdur-Rahim has been the rare exception to the recent rule. After earning more than $100 million in the 12-year playing career in which he averaged 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, he retired in 2008 and became an assistant coach with the Kings. He joined Petrie as the Kings' assistant general manager two years later, and became the director of player personnel under D'Alessandro after the recent regime change.\n\nWhile knowing the CBA as if it's your team's playbook will always help a former player's cause when it comes to pursuing front-office positions, Abdur-Rahim stressed the importance of maintaining a good reputation during one's playing days.\n\n\"People have an opinion of you as a player, so if you were a dependable guy — not if you were the best player, but if you were a dependable guy — if I could count on you to give effort every night, knew you were a hard worker, knew you'd be on time, knew you were responsible, just that in itself will go a long way for you in anything else you want to do after playing,\" he said. \"My advice to guys is, don't think it's the same as playing. It's totally different rules. Totally different skill sets, totally different environment.\n\n\"It's like everything else: You have to work. You have a duty to work, to get better.\"\n\nAnd, of course, to learn about the apron."
