Sign up for the free DubsDaily newsletter.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY — The Warriors might have three All-Stars back, but they have lost a good chunk of their bench.\n\nThe Warriors (56-21) enter Tuesday’s game against the Oklahoma City Thunder (45-33) with Andre Iguodala (left knee), Kevon Looney (flu), Omri Casspi (right ankle) and Shaun Livingston (personal reasons) all ruled out. Oh, and Warriors guards Stephen Curry (left MCL sprain) and Patrick McCaw (lumbar spine contusion) are sidelined, too.\n\nAs if Warriors coach Steve Kerr did not already have enough concerns with the Thunder’s Russell Westbrook, Paul George, Steven Adams and Carmelo Anthony on his mind.\n\nKerr expressed optimism that Iguodala will return for Thursday’s game in Indiana after missing the previous two games with the same injury. It is not clear on the other reserves, though. Looney and Livingston are not currently with the team, though it is possible either could rejoin the Warriors in Indiana.\n\nFor now, Kerr will start Zaza Pachulia at center to counter Adams’ size. The Warriors will also have their three All-Stars in Kevin Durant, Draymond Green and Klay Thompson start alongside Quinn Cook.\n\nTo subscribe to the Planet Dubs podcast, click here.\n\nWant real-time Warriors news texted to your phone?
