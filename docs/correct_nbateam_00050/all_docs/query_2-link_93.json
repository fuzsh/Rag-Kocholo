The versatile guard can play both at the point and off the ball and gives them a defensive dimension on the second unit as well.\n\nIt was the first move the champions made in what figures to be a busy summer. They also expect to sign Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant to big deals and are trying to keep Andre Iguodala as well."
