        "text": "The Oklahoma City Thunder have signed former first-round draft pick Shaun Livingston to a multi-year contract and recalled rookie forward D.J. White from the Tulsa 66ers of the NBA Development League.\n\nOklahoma City general manager Sam Presti announced the moves Tuesday.\n\nLivingston is a six-foot-seven point guard who's averaged 9.5 points, 6.0 assists and 3.5 rebounds in 11 games with the 66ers.\n\nLivingston was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers with the fourth overall pick in the 2004 NBA draft and has played in 149 career games with the Clippers and Miami Heat, averaging 7.3 points, 4.7 assists and 3.1 rebounds.\n\nThis is the second time in two weeks White has been recalled. He averaged 17.3 points and 9.7 rebounds in three games with the 66ers before being recalled last week. He remained inactive with the Thunder and then got sick before being sent back to Tulsa on Sunday."
