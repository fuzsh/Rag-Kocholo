        "text": "Once again, another NBA season has just got into full flow and the Brooklyn Nets are off on a less than impressive start. But is anyone really surprised? Brooklyn are now 6-8 and are set to play Chicago (9-6) on Sunday.\n\nThe Nets have managed to rack up wins against the Detroit Pistons, New York Knicks, Orlando Magic, Philadelphia 76ers and the Oklahoma City Thunder twice. On paper, it may not look so bad. Oklahoma are always a contender, everyone knows that, right? But without superstars Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, the Thunder have slumped to a 4-12 record. This, along with the Spurs 10-4, Cleveland 7-7 and the Heat 8-7, just goes to prove a slow start is not the end of all hope.\n\nSo why are Lionel Hollins and the Nets walking along this bumpy road once again? Are the players simply adjusting to Lionel Hollins’ coaching methods? Are members of the squad happy? Does Brooklyn just need to wait while the new members of the squad learn each others style of play?\n\nThere are a lot of questions floating about as to why the Nets continue to under perform and frustrate themselves and the fans. Last year we heard a lot of excuses from the organization and did not see any promising basketball until big man Brook Lopez went down injured.\n\nIs Lopez the reason the Nets are struggling again? Should the organization trade him? Mason Plumlee is coming off a run in Team USA and an excellent rookie season, and you know what? He looks worse. His numbers are down ever since Lopez made his return from injury.\n\nIs the playmaking and ever threat of Shaun Livingston truely that missed? Livingston was credited on numerous occasions as one of the reasons for the Nets’ late success last year. It is understandable from an outside perspective to see that the team changes so often to players begin to learn and mesh with their teammates and then one of them is gone. Replaced by someone else.\n\nHowever, as every cloud has a silver lining, Kevin Garnett is “back”. Garnett has stepped up as a leader for the team, even on limited minutes, and is offering glimmers of what the organization had hoped for back when they made the trade with the Boston Celtics. If things put up for the Nets and Garnett continues to be, well, himself, Brooklyn could be up for another good playoff run.\n\nThe Nets have had a lot busier offseason than many have thought, conducting a trade, making their way into the draft and signing some European talent via free agency. The question remains however, have the Nets gotten better?\n\nAdditions: Bojan Bogdanovic, Jarrett Jack, Sergey Karasev, Markel Brown, Cory Jefferson and Brook Lopez*\n\nLosses: Paul Pierce, Shaun Livingston, Marcus Thornton, Andray Blatche, Jason Collins\n\n*Brook Lopez was out nearly all of the season last year, making him a non-factor. He is now back from injury and looks to contribute.\n\nShaun Livingston vs Jarrett Jack\n\nShaun Livingston darted to Oakland in the early part of free agency, but the Nets did not wait long to replace the lanky floor general. The Nets swung a three-team deal that brought Jarrett Jack to Brooklyn along with Sergey Karasev while only giving up Marcus Thornton.\n\nWhat the real question about Jack is. Can he replace Livingston? But in reality, there is no answer to that. Can Jack do what Livingston did on the floor for the Nets? No. Can Jack contribute in different ways that will still be beneficial to Brooklyn? Yes.\n\nJack and Livingston are different plays. Some could say polar opposite. Livingston is a guard that loves to get to the rim, struggles with his outside shot and is a menace to multiple positions on the defensive end.\n\nOn the contrary, Jack is a perimeter-oriented guard who struggles near the rim and can hardly defend his own position let alone others.\n\nIt is no secret that Jack struggled while backing up Kyrie Irving last year in Cleveland, but besides that he has usually been a very solid backup PG even finishing third in sixth man of the year voting in 2012 with the Warriors.\n\nJack has the ability to succeed with the Nets, and while he cannot replace what Livingston did, Jack can be just as valuable off the bench and possibly in the starting unit.\n\nThe Loss of Paul Pierce\n\nAs we all know, Paul Pierce is now playing alongside John Wall in Washington. Pierce played a big role with the Nets last year on and off the court. While the Nets do not have one player that can replace Pierce’s production, but have players that together can produce like Pierce did. Bojan Bogdanovic has finally decided to come over to Brooklyn. While he will not live up to what Pierce did, Bogdanovic has the chance to come in off the bench and make shots. Pierce also spent a lot of time at PF this season, and the improvements of Mason Plumlee and Mirza Teletovic along with drafting Cory Jefferson should more than make up for the loss.\n\nAndray Blatche and Jason Collins\n\nWhile it is still possible the Nets sign Andray Blatche after the FIBA World Cup, it is unlikely as they would have to waive a player, likely being Jorge Gutierrez’s non-guaranteed deal or buying out Marquis Teague. Blatche is a unique player. He has the size of a PF/C but handles the ball and runs the floor like a guard. While he is prone to bad decisions, Blatche also has the ability to take over a game. Personally, I want him back on the squad, but the Nets are equipped to survive post-Blatche. This is again due to the emergence of Mason Plumlee along with the steady improvement of the Bosnian sniper, Mirza Teletovic. We also cannot forget that Brook Lopez is returning is sure to be a force on offense yet again. However, I along with many other Nets fans will miss “Dray Live”. I sincerely hope he finds an NBA job this year. As for Jason Collins, he played a very small role with the Nets last year as his role was basically to foul people. Collins is now pursuing other things besides basketball such as public speaking and advocating for homosexual athletes.\n\nMarcus Thornton\n\nMany people tend to forget, but Marcus Thornton played a big role for the Nets off the bench in the second half of the season. While not an efficient scorer, Thornton did put up points in his time as a Net. One underdog to replace Thornton’s scoring is Markel Brown. The combo guard out of Oklahoma State may not score his points the same way as Thornton, but if given playing time, he does have the ability to put up points.\n\nSo, have the Nets improved this season? As far as offseason moves go, the Nets have likely gotten a little worse. However, with Brook Lopez healthy and Deron Williams finally getting ankle surgery they have the chance to be better than ever. This season hinges on the health of Lopez and Williams.\n\nAlthough the Brooklyn Nets seemed to not have much to work with, the Nets made a few under the radar positive moves in the 2014 offseason. Especially in trades, Brooklyn made some sneaky good transactions.\n\nFREE AGENCY\n\nNotable Additions: Alan Anderson (Re-Sign), Bojan Bogdanović\n\nNotable Subtractions: Paul Pierce, Shaun Livingston\n\nAnderson (31) posted some impressive numbers last year despite the lack of significant playing time. He recorded 7 points and 2 rebounds in 23 minutes per game. Although re-signing Alan Anderson is smart, letting Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston will really bite the Nets in the butt.\n\nBehind Joe Johnson and Deron Williams, Paul Pierce and Shaun Livingston were clearly the next two most important players on Brooklyn last year. With losing “The Truth”, the Nets lose a go-to scorer, clutch performer, and leader. However, the Nets were able to keep Kevin Garnett, so they won’t be lacking in the “old guy leader” front.\n\nShaun Livingston was one of the most consistent players for the Nets down the stretch last season. When Williams played poorly (about half the games), Livingston stepped up big time. He was masterful at attacking the rim and getting his shot around the paint. Livingston’s dependability at the point guard position will surely be missed, but it has been replaced (read on to the trade section).\n\nGRADE: C-\n\nTRADES\n\nNotable Additions: Lionel Hollins (signed after the Jason Kidd trade), Jarrett Jack, Sergey Karasev, Two future second round draft picks\n\nNotable Subtractions: Jason Kidd, Marcus Thornton\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets truly upgraded immensely in both trades they made. They traded Jason Kidd for two second round picks (in one of the most bizarre trades ever) and replaced him with an undoubtably more experienced coach with a better track record. The two draft picks aren’t flashy, but they will help Brooklyn get younger as the veterans grow older.\n\nAs for the Marcus Thornton trade, the Nets gained an experienced veteran in Jarrett Jack and a young player with a lot of potential in Sergey Karasev. Jack placed third in 6th man of the year voting two years ago, but his game hit rock bottom last year on a bad Cleveland team loaded with heavy-headed guards. Jack will thrive with the Nets because he will fill Shaun Livingston’s role. Jarrett Jack’s confidence off the bench will benefit the Nets as well as individual players like Mirza Teletovic.\n\nSergey Karasev is a relatively unknown commodity, but he has a high ceiling and could become a heavy contributor down the road.\n\nAlthough the Nets didn’t make a huge splash in the trade department, they didn’t really have much to work with. Brooklyn won both of their trades and upgraded their coach.\n\nGRADE: B+\n\nDRAFT\n\nKey Additions: Markel Brown (Oklahoma State), Cory Jefferson (Baylor)\n\nKey Losses: Cash\n\nOnce again, it seemed like the Nets’ front office made something out of nothing. They had no draft picks, but they acquired two rookies for money out of billionaire owner, Mikhail Prokhorov’s pockets. They got Markel Brown (44th pick) from the Minnesota Timberwolves and Cory Jefferson (60th pick) from the Spurs.\n\nAlthough they both have some potential, Markel Brown is the one that can really make an impact in the NBA. Brown is a high-flying two guard whose athleticism is prime on both ends of the floor. He is just what the old Nets need.\n\nDespite not having a pick in the first round, the Nets made the most of their options by buying two players late in the draft. They were unable to get a high profile name in the lottery, but they rolled the dice on two outside-the-box talents.\n\nThe Nets also traded for the 59th pick Xavier Thames, who was originally selected by the Raptors. However, Thames performed poorly in Summer League and did not make the team.\n\nGRADE: B\n\nOVERALL\n\nA common theme for the Nets this summer was making something out of nothing. Whether it was making creative trades when no one thought they had any assets or attaining two rookies without any draft picks, the Nets found ways to reinvent themselves in minor ways.\n\nConsidering what they started with and what they will have at the beginning of the 2014-15 season (including a healthy Brook Lopez), the Brooklyn Nets had a surprisingly good offseason.\n\nOVERALL GRADE: B\n\nWith the season still a few months away and the roster changes in place for the start of the new season, Nets fans anxiously wait to see how their Brooklyn Nets will do. Fans from the Brooklyn Nets News & More fan page and the Brooklyn Nets Basketball group submitted a lot of great questions for me to answer. Without further ado…. Brooklyn Nets Mailbag: Part I:\n\nQ: Do you think Mirza Teletovic can start this season? – Mido\n\nA: Last season Mirza Teletovic made the most of his playing time, putting up the best numbers of his NBA career. After averaging 8.6 points and 3.7 rebounds, Teletovic looks to build upon his current success in the NBA. Although we know Mirza can be a starter one day, I do not see starting in the beginning of the season. Seasoned veteran Kevin Garnett and Mason Plumlee are currently slightly above Teletovic on the depth chart. With Brook Lopez coming back from injury and Garnett’s limited minutes, Teletovic should have the minutes he needs to shine. Who knows, maybe he can take his game to a whole new level and be a starter by the end of the season.\n\nQ: Will the new European players be a big factor in this upcoming season? – Kenry Taylor\n\nA: This offseason, the Brooklyn Nets signed Bojan Bogdanovic and landed Sergey Karasev in a trade with the Cleveland Cavaliers. Bojan Bogdanovic averaged 14.8 points, 2.4 rebounds and 1.9 assists in 30.6 minutes per game in the Adriatic League. After months of speculation, Bogdanovic has agreed to sign with Brooklyn and play in the NBA. However, don’t expect him to make a big impact right away. It will take time for him to adjust to his new teammates and coach. Sergey Karasev is a young swingman with great upside. I don’t think he is close to a polished player just yet, but being mentored by Andrei Kirilenko will help the young player improve his game. The new European players can be a big factor for the Nets by the end of the season. Let’s see how quickly they can adjust playing for a new team.\n\nQ: How much of a change can we expect from Plumlee compared to his rookie season? – Rob Cosgrove\n\nA: Selected 22nd overall in the 2013 NBA Draft, Mason Plumlee was an absolute steal for the Brooklyn Nets. Last season, he led all rookies in Player Efficiency Rating (19.0) and Win Shares (4.7). After a solid rookie season, Plumlee should be even better for the Nets this season. With Kevin Garnett getting older and Lopez returning from injury, there will be plenty of opportunities for the former-Duke power forward to shine.\n\nProjected stat-line: 12 points, 7 rebounds, 1 block (25 minutes a game)"
