        "text": "Deflating is a word that has taken on new meaning in New England in recent years, but there’s no better descriptor for what happened to Gordon Hayward just five minutes and 15 seconds into his Celtics debut.\n\nThe premier free-agent signing went to catch an alley-oop pass from Kyrie Irving in traffic, then fell awkwardly on his left leg, leaving his ankle bent at a devastatingly wrong angle. It recalled all the worst injuries we know from sports history, from Paul George to Shaun Livingston, Jason Kendall to Geoff Jenkins, Joe Theismann to Frank Gifford.\n\nCeltics and Cavaliers players looked on in horror as a deep, engrossing sadness cast a pall over The Q. Marcus Smart and Irving gripped each other in an emotional embrace. Hayward, for his part, seemed to be in shock as he remained calm through the entire cringe-inducing ordeal.\n\nSuddenly, Hayward’s career and the Celtics’ trajectory have to be reconsidered. After the game, coach Brad Stevens announced Hayward had a dislocated ankle and a fractured tibia. He was reportedly flown back to New England Baptist Hospital in Boston on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile the Celtics struggled to compose themselves through the remainder of the first half, they came out after the break — I’d assume spurred on by a few “Win it for Gordon” cries in the locker room — and rallied from 18 down against the defending Eastern Conference champs to take a four-point lead late in the fourth quarter. But without their second-best player, the Celtics’ pups — Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum combined for 77 minutes — didn’t have quite enough down the stretch, falling 102-99 when Brown and Irving misfired on last-second 3-point attempts.\n\nWhat does this mean for Hayward?\n\nEveryone around Hayward, from his family and friends to fans and team executives, are hoping that his recovery goes as well as Paul George’s. The current Oklahoma City Thunder star missed almost the entire 2014-15 season — he played six games — after breaking his tibia while playing in an exhibition game for Team USA in August 2014.\n\nBut after missing that year, he returned to the Indiana Pacers as basically the same player, averaging a then-career best 23 points and seven rebounds in 2015-16.\n\nOn the other end of that spectrum is Shaun Livingston, who suffered a knee injury that was equally disturbing to watch in 2007. While Livingston’s injury was much different — he tore three tendons in his knee and dislocated his patella and tibia — and occurred when he was just 21 years old (Hayward is 27) and averaging a tick over nine points and five rebounds a game. He missed the entire next season, played in just 12 games the year after that and didn’t play a full season again until 2010-11, at which point he was still only 25 but was lacking the athleticism he came into the league with and was relegated to being a useful bench piece the rest of his career.\n\nMaybe the closest injury to Hayward’s was Derrick Roland, a Texas A&M player who broke his tibia and fibula in 2009, and just under a year later was playing in the NBDL, although his borderline NBA talent makes it tough to determine how much his injury affected his career trajectory.\n\nWhat does it mean for the Celtics?\n\nHayward’s injury — and let’s assume he’s out the season, despite some rumors he could return in March — certainly puts a cap on the Celtics’ possibilities this year. There’s still enough talent to accomplish what I predicted: 55 wins and a loss in the Eastern Conference finals. But Hayward’s absence erases an NBA title as a possibility this year, and makes it even more unlikely that Boston gets past Cleveland in the conference finals.\n\nThere’s no real reason to think the Celtics will be worse than last year, when they won 53 games and reached the Eastern Conference Finals. In the offseason, they essentially traded Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder and Avery Bradley for Kyrie Irving, Marcus Morris and Tatum. That’s at least an equal trade-off, if not a slight improvement, and the guys they got have more upside than the guys they sent away.\n\nAnd it could actually help the Celtics long-term. Hayward’s 32-34 minutes will likely get spread between Brown, Tatum, Marcus Smart and, when he’s healthy, Morris. Even Semi Ojeyele and Terry Rozier could get a little boost.\n\nThat’s five players (excluding Morris) who are 23 or younger getting extra run alongside veterans like Irving, Al Horford and Aron Baynes.\n\nBrown in particular looked like a different player in his second season, finishing with 25 points and six rebounds in a team-high 40 minutes. But his lack of strength was exposed by LeBron James, who quickly realized he could bully his way to the hoop when Brown was on him.\n\nAfter a slow start, which was understandable considering the situation, Tatum played well in the second half, finishing with 14 points and 10 rebounds as he showed off tremendous finishing skills at the rim with either hand to go with the strong shooting Celtics fans have been swooning about since Summer League.\n\nWhat does it mean for fans?\n\nAs stated earlier, Hayward’s absence takes the top off this season’s expectations, but there’s still a top-four Eastern Conference team calling TD Garden home. The extended playing time for the young guys could pay off in 2018-19, when, hopefully, Hayward returns at full strength and the Celtics have possibly added another lottery pick (if the Lakers finish with a top-five selection).\n\nThere was little to console most fans during the first half on Tuesday night, but by the second half the silver linings were peeking through, as Smart caused disruption on defense, Brown finished on the break and Irving identified mismatches involving Derrick Rose and Kyle Korver and distributed appropriately.\n\nIn just a year, deflating could become inspiring.\n\nFollow Brendan Kurie on Twitter @BrendanKurieSCT"
