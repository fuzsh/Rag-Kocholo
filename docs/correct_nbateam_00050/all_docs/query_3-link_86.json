        "text": "Arizona. Duke. Illinois.\n\nShaun Livingston’s remaining three finalists have been known for nearly a month now, but the secrecy of his recruitment has left fans of all three programs wondering exactly who has the upper hand. And with only three or four days until he makes his decision public, coaches from Durham, Tucson and Champaign are starting to sweat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter all, it’s not often that a game-changing, championship-caliber point guard comes along. Especially not one that happens to stand 6-foot-7-inches and passes like Magic.\n\nGOAZCATS.com spoke with Livingston’s grandfather, Frank, on Friday afternoon about Shaun’s final week of courtship. It’s been made clear by Shaun that the ultimate decision will be his own, but he will solicit advice from those closest to him, and that means that his grandfather will have considerable input.\n\nWe’ll let Frank take it from here.\n\nThe following text is entirely from the mouth of Frank Livingston, grandfather of star 2004 recruit Shaun Livingston.\n\nOn Shaun’s recruitment and imminent decision\n\n“Last time I talked to (Shaun) that was the plan, to announce his decision next week. I talked to him Monday night about his decision. I told him to take your time, you don’t have to make your choice tonight. I talked to his high school coach (Chuck Buescher) and I guess they are going to have a press conference when he makes his decision. His coach said ‘I don’t want him to tell me until the day of the press conference because I don’t want to leak anything’.\n\n“This whole thing doesn’t bother me one bit. It’s been a great experience for me. I’m the type of person that likes to meet people and talk to them. (Arizona assistant coach) Josh (Pastner) and Jack (Murphy, an administrative assistant at Arizona), everyone. I intend to write both of them a letter and call them soon because we had a great visit when I was in Arizona. This is an amazing process, life is an amazing thing. Everything must come to an end so Shaun’s next step will be just another chapter in a book.\n\n“This has been going on since Shaun was young but it’s not all that he does (in life). He sang in the choir, he played in the band, everything. His baseball coach told me he wasn’t sure his future was in baseball but he could pitch. He was a quarterback in football and he could catch the ball, too.”\n\nOn Shaun’s talents and mentor\n\n“Shaun sang in a Peoria area youth choir for two years…he did everything. One summer school was out and it was 9:30 or so in the morning and he was in bed. I left and I said he’s getting some rest. And when I came back and he was gone. I said to myself ‘I wonder where he went?’ He had gone over to church four blocks away and learned how to read music.\n\n“I told Josh (Pastner) to call Shaun’s mentor at Concordia (College), Tom Ruppert. He was an All-American basketball player at Concordia Lutheran College and he could have had a pro career but God was his choice. He will oversee Shaun’s education through college. They go to church and basketball games together. Mr. Ruppert and his wife were at Shaun’s birthday in September (12th) like they always are. They’re part of the family. He showed up in a pair of shorts at one of Shaun’s softball games and I thought ‘how the heck did he know Shaun was playing a softball game tonight?’ School was out and he looked like he had just come back from vacation or something. That’s the kind of connection they have.”\n\nOn basically raising Shaun himself\n\n“His dad (Reggie) wanted to put Shaun into Head Start when he was young but they said he’d lose interest because of his intelligence so he didn’t go. His birthday fell so that he couldn’t start school when he was five and he had to wait a year. His dad said I’ll send him to a private school for a year, which was church-affiliated at the time. Then his dad sent him to a Lutheran school where he met Mr. Ruppert in 1st grade. Shaun won two state Lutheran championships, one 4th place finish at nationals. The year that they won the 4th place at nationals they came back and were going to have a track team. I thought, ‘this is going to be a waste of time’…they got 3rd in state! He ran a 220 relay, 440 and did the high jump. I remember the year before that he came in 3rd (in the high jump) and the kid who won said ‘you should continue to jump because you’re just going on raw talent’. He had on basketball shorts and he was jumping too far back from the bar. That was in 7th grade.\n\n“Reggie and Shaun stayed with me until he went to Richwood. All the time he went to Concordia they were living with me. Shaun wanted to go to Richwood because his friends were going there so they got an apartment the two years he went there. He was at Richwood for two years and then transferred to Central where they won the state title last year. They are expecting another good team this year.\n\n“Shaun lived with me all that time except when Reggie and his wife were together. They both lived with me. I went and got Shaun because he was going through things that I saw, and I thought he needed to be here with me. He goes to his father’s probably every day and in fact he stays out there some times. They have a computer, I don’t have a computer so he goes out there and does homework and talks to different people. But most times he stays with me, yes.”\n\nOn NBA talk and college choices\n\n“Everybody’s talking about him going to the NBA or how most people only think he’ll spend two years in college. I don’t listen to that talk. I hope he stays four years. I don’t think he’ll need $100 million dollars to be happy. I don’t even think he’ll need $10 million to be happy. He’s got a chance to go to college for four years and this will be the last of the luxury ride for him. He’s going to have to start producing, start doing things for him and other people like they did for him That’s his obligation – to share. He knows how. His college should be about that, not thinking about the NBA.\n\n“I have chopped his choices down to three (schools): Duke, Arizona and Illinois. He’s about to make the biggest decision of his adult life. Fortunately it’s a fool-proof decision. No matter which college he picks he’s going to be okay. I’ve talked to the coaches and they said they will take care of him, and I believe them.\n\n“The major difference between the three schools … the one thing I did tell Shaun, I said Mr. Ruppert taught you the Ten Commandments, all the other coaches will teach you the Ten Commandments, too. But Coach K is going to teach you the Ten Commandments and he will also teach you about the military code of honor. That is the difference I see with Coach K’s background as a West Point man. I know of the pride because I have that from the Marine Corps. I talked to Josh and Jack about that. I know Coach K has that training, that it’s special, and that anyone in the service is special to me.\n\n“Shaun’s still got a year of high school left and he is going to try to win another championship. That’s a goal. College isn’t the most important thing that’s going to happen for him this year. That championship is the most important.”\n\nOn his extended stay in Arizona\n\n“I came down (to Arizona) the day after he got there (Friday), and I stayed until Tuesday morning. I went back to the University with Josh and Jack and went for a walk at 7:00 that morning. At eight I went to breakfast. I went to practice at 1:30 or so…I watched practice and had a chance to see Mr. (Lute) Olson teach and coach. I thought he was a good teacher. Then I ate with the team but I had to pay for my meal because the visit was over and it would have been a violation for them to do anything for me. So I ate and we walked back to the campus and we talked. Me and Jack and Josh. We walked to my hotel from campus and we talked and I told them I was going to watch TV and get ready to leave at 4:30 the next morning. I told them good-bye and shook hands with them. Josh said ‘I think I could hug you’, so I said ‘ah go ahead’. I hugged Josh and Jack both.\n\n“I woke up at 4:30 and there was Jack and Josh down there already. So we said good-bye for a final time. We had some great talks. I was in the Marine Corps and on our walk to campus Jack showed me the anchor chain on the U.S.S. Arizona. The building was closed but we could see the chain. I knew about the Arizona and the monument (in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii), and we talked about other things. It was just a great opportunity to meet everyone there.”\n\nOn Shaun’s comfort level with the players\n\n“Shaun was very comfortable with Arizona players and coaches. I didn’t go to North Carolina with him but I get a feeling when I go to the places; I see what he likes. At Arizona, he knows Andre (Iguodala) since he’s from Springfield. And at Illinois he knows Richard McBride and Brian Randle, who are both down there. And another kid from Central that’s a senior on the team, too. (Arizona freshman point guard Mustafa) Shakur’s one guy I didn’t mention. He went to ABCD camp with him in ‘02 and played together in a tourney in Pennsylvania. They aren’t strangers with each other. It’s an amazing process because of all the social interaction between the players and the schools. No one else gets to see what I see.”\n\nIn the end we’re all right back where we started. It has become obvious that no one is going to truly know where Shaun Livingston is going to college next year until the words come out of his mouth this week at his press conference.\n\nAdvantage: Duke."
