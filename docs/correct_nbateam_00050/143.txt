Former Oklahoma City guard, Shaun Livingston, announced his retirement from the NBA Friday.

In a post on his Instagram, the 15-year NBA veteran said that he was “excited, sad, fortunate and grateful all in one breath”.

Livingston played for the Thunder during the 2008-09 season after being signed from the Tulsa ‘66ers. As a backup guard, he appeared in eight games, averaging 7.8 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.0 assists.

The former No. 4 overall pick in 2004, Livingston suffered a gruesome knee injury in 2007 that nearly cost him his left leg as well as his career. He missed an entire season while rehabilitating three torn ligaments and a dislocated patella. When he returned, he was let go by six teams and traded by three others. Livingston did play on the same team in consecutive seasons for more than eight years.

Livingston finally found a home in Golden State in 2014 as a key role player, helping the Warriors to win three NBA Championships.
