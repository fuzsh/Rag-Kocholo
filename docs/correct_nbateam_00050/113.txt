According to Chris Silvia from thunder-nba.com/thunderblog/the Oklahoma City Thunder have signed Tulsa 66'er PG Shaun Livingston to a multi-year contract. In his time with OKC's D-League team, Livingston has averaged 9.5 PTS, 3.5 RBS, and 6 assists.

Shaun Livingston was the No. 4 pick in the 2004 draft by the L.A. Clippers. His career was, seemingly, cut short when he blew out his knee on Feb. 26, 2007. He spent the next year rehabbing his knee and basically learning to walk again.

At the start of this season, Livingston was on the Miami Heat's roster, but was waived shortly after the season got under way. He eventually made his way to Tulsa, where he has been a steady force on an unstable team.

For those who don't know, Tulsa is in last place in the D-League but has shown improvement since the acquiring Livingston.

Many Thunder fans will ask why Oklahoma City is taking a chance on a player who is basically trying to learn how to play basketball again.

Livingston is a true PG who helps the players around him before taking the shot himself. This move is probably being made so that OKC can trade Earl Watson and possibly Chucky Atkins in the off-season and bring in some vital pieces the Thunder are currently lacking.

This signing has the potential to be a great deal for the Thunder, getting a former top 5 pick can almost always help a team, but having a player with a known health issue may make his contract wasted cap space.
