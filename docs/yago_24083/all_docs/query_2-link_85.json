        "text": "Career\n\nShe met Augustus, Grand Duke of Oldenburg in 1830, and after an hour\"s conversation, the marriage was decided. Cecilia had an interest in culture. As Grand Duchess of Oldenburg she composed the melody of a hymn for Oldenburg.\n\nThe hymn was later added with lyrics by Theodor von Kobbe and named ‘Heil director, o Oldenburg’.\n\nIn 1833, Cecila supported the founding of the city\"s first theatre, which today is the Oldenburgisches Staatstheater. She was, however, never known to be close to the population in Oldenburg, where she lived a life confined to the circles of the court.\n\nA bridge, a square and a road are named after her, as well as a school. In honour of the late Cecilia, the locality Cäciliengroden at the Jade Bight near Wilhelmshaven (later incorporated into Sande in Frisia) was named after her.\n\nShe was buried in the Ducal Mausoleum in the Churchyard of Saint Gertrude (Street Gertrudenkirchhof / Gertrudenfriedhof) in the city of Oldenburg.\n\nHer sister, Amalia Maria Charlotta, was buried there, too. Marriage 22 June 1807 – 5 May 1831: Her Royal Highness Princess Cecilia of Sweden 5 May 1831 – 27 January 1844: Her Royal Highness The Grand Duchess of Oldenburg."
