        "text": "Prince Erik of Sweden and Norway, Duke of Västmanland (Erik Gustav Ludvig Albert Bernadotte) (20 April, 1889 – 20 September, 1918), Duke of Västmanland, was the third and youngest son of King Gustav V of Sweden and his wife, Queen Victoria. Prince Erik suffered from epilepsy and mental retardation. Because of his conditions, he was seldom seen in public, and led a quiet life away from the public eye, similar to the life of Prince John of the United Kingdom. In 1904 Prince Erik was appointed a Knight of the Norwegian lion by King Oscar II. He died of the Spanish flu just before the end of World War I.\n\nAncestry"
