        "text": "Adolf Frederick 1710 - 1771\n\nAdolf Frederick (Adolf Fredrik) was Sweden's king from 1751 until 1771.\n\nAdolf's father was Christian Augustus, the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp. Adolf's mother was Albertina Frederica of Baden-Durlach.\n\nHence, Adolf Frederick was not a king by birth. How then did he get the seat? By election.\n\nWhy was Adolf Frederick Elected King?\n\nHe became king in large parts because Russian empress Elizabeth wanted him to be. And since she just won the Russo-Swedish War of 1741 - 1743, people complied to her wishes.\n\nAdolf Frederick followed Frederick I of Hessen to the throne, who died in 1751 and without a legal heir, although he did not suffer from a lack of illegal offspring.\n\nAdolf Frederick's Family\n\nAdolf Frederick's wife was Queen Louisa Ulrika, the sister of Frederick II of Prussia, also called Frederick the Great. Power, therefore, was in the house.\n\nAmong other children, their sons were the later kings Gustav III and Charles XIII.\n\nMore History"
