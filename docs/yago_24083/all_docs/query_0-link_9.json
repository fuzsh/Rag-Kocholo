        "text": "Gustav IV Adolf or Gustav IV Adolph (1 November 1778 – 7 February 1837) was King of Sweden from 1792 until he was deposed in a coup in 1809. He was also the last Swedish monarch to be the ruler of Finland.\n\nThe occupation of Finland in 1808–09 by Russian forces was the immediate cause of Gustav's violent overthrow by officers of his own army. Following his abdication on 29 March 1809, an Instrument of Government was hastily written, which severely circumscribed the powers of the monarchy. The \"Instrument\" was adopted in 1809 on 6 June, the National Day of Sweden now as well as in his time. It remained in force until replaced in 1974. The crown, now with strictly limited powers, passed to Gustav's uncle Charles XIII, who had no legitimate children; this want of heirs set into motion the quest for a successor, who was found the following year in the person of Jean-Baptiste Jules Bernadotte, the first monarch of the present royal family.\n\nMore information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gustav_IV_Adolf\n\nKing of Sweden:\n\nReign: 29 March 1792 – 29 March 1809\n\nCoronation: 3 April 1800\n\nPredecessor: Gustav III\n\nSuccessor: Charles XIII\n\nRegent: Charles, Duke of Södermanland (1792–1796),\n\nBorn: 1 November 1778,\n\nStockholm Palace, Sweden\n\nDied: 7 February 1837 (aged 58)\n\nSt. Gallen, Swiss Confederacy\n\nBurial: 29 May 1884, Riddarholm Church\n\nSpouse: Frederica of Baden\n\n​​(m. 1797; div. 1812)​\n\nChildren:\n\nGustav, Prince of Vasa\n\nSophie, Grand Duchess of Baden\n\nPrincess Amalia\n\nCecilia, Grand Duchess of Oldenburg\n\nHouse: Holstein-Gottorp\n\nFather: Gustav III of Sweden\n\nMother: Sophia Magdalena of Denmark\n\nReligion: Lutheran\n\nGustav Adolf at the age of seven\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/Gustav_Adolf_Vierte_Schweden_Kind.jpg\n\nTheir son, Crown Prince Gustaf, later Prince Vasa, was engaged to Princess Marianne of the Netherlands, daughter of King Willem I and Mimi of Prussia.\n\nI am now reading a book about the court of the King Willem. And in it they shed some light on the engagement. I always found it a peculiar one. As a prince without a throne in the family what prospects did the Dutch king expect?\n\nThe book says that people [including Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia, mother of the Princess of Orange at the time] found Marianne rather spoiled. Both her parents doted on her, she slept in her mother's bedroom until her late teens. The princess fell in love with the prince.\n\nPerhaps this would have been a way to keep her in the Netherlands after a wedding. The King's sister Louise and his aunt Pss Caroline married relatively unimportant German princes and were able to spend much time in The Hague.\n\nThe prince Vasa was set to be promoted to the rank of General-Major in the Dutch army so perhaps the idea was they would set up a life in the alternating court residences of The Hague and Brussels. The book is not clear about it.\n\nNot unimportant to a Dutch mindset: the prince was supposed to be very wealthy. They do not elaborate much on this in the book but they claim it was 20 million guilders. Does anybody know where the wealth came from? Did the Vasa's receive some sort of compensation from Sweden when they lost the throne?\n\nThe engagement was broken of after a double campaign against it. Sweden threatened to break all trade ties if the wedding went on [in the official statement Gustaf had been referred to as ' Prince of Sweden' , to the dismay of the court in Stockholm]. More opposition came from the Russian Princess of Orange, Anna Pavlova. She and her relatives stated that the prince was anti-Russian. Does anybody know why he was considered such? In the end the government pressured the King to break the engagement, which he did. Did the Swedes object to Gustaf's wedding to a Princess of Baden too?\n\nIn the end both Gustaf as Marianne went on to have two very unhappy marriages. Both of them divorced, something very irregular at the time.\n\nTheir son, Crown Prince Gustaf, later Prince Vasa, was engaged to Pass Marianne of the Netherlands, daughter of King Willem I and Mimi of Prussia.\n\nI am now reading a book about the court of the King Willem.

What became of their status afterwards under Swedish law or court protocol? Dukes of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp? Princes Vasa? Messrs. Gustafsson?"
