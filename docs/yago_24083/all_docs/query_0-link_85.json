        "text": "The below cited work, which I possess has this to say about the first\n\ngeneration\n\nGustav I was married three times (or at least they only list the first three\n\nwives)\n\nFirst to Catherine in 1531, she b 1513 d 1535, d of Magnus I, Duke of\n\nSaxe-Lauenburg.\n\nThey only list one child, a son, Eric XIV K of Sweden 1560-8, b 1533 d 1577,\n\nwho m in 1568 to Catherine Maansdatter b 1550 d 1612. Then list two children,\n\nsons, Henry d 1633 and Gustavus b 1568 d 1607. Nothing further on this line.\n\nSecond wife of Gustav I is Margaret d of Eric Lejonhufvud, she was born 1514\n\nand d 1551. They married in 1536.\n\nFive children are listed, 1) John III K of Sweden 1568, b 1526 [maybe 1536,\n\nbut as found], d 1583; 2) Cecily b 1540 d 1627; 3) Magnus b 1542, d 1595; 4)\n\nAnne Mary b 1545 d 1610; 5) Charles IX K of Sweden 1604, b 1550, d 1611\n\nThere is more detail but tell me what you're looking for cause I don't wanna\n\ntype out six pages of details...\n\nThanks\n\nWill Johnson\n\nIn a message dated 5/22/2004 5:19:34 PM Pacific Daylight Time,\n\n\n\n\n\nOldest daughter: Katarina Gustafsdotter - married to Count Edzard II of\n\nOstfriesland. Male line extinct. Heir of line seems to be Moritz,\n\nLandgrave of Hesse (b. 1926)\n\nSecond daghter: Cäcilie Gustafsdotter - married Margrave Christoph II of\n\nBaden-Rodemarchern. Male line extinct. Heir of line seems to be\n\nArchduchess Margherita of Austria, née Princess of Savoy, b. 1930.\n\nThird daughter: Anna Maria Gustafsdotter - married Pfalzgraf Georg\n\nJohann I of Veldenz. Male line and all other lines extinct.\n\nFourth daughter: Sofia Gustafsdotter - married Duke Magnus II of\n\nSaxe-Lauenburg. Male line extinct. Heir of line seems to be someone in\n\nthe Swedish nobility, since their son Duke Gustav of Saxe-Lauenburg only\n\nhad one illegitimate son who was ennobled in Sweden as Gustaf Gustafsson\n\nRutencrantz. (UN General Secretary Dag Hammarskiöld was one of their\n\ndescendants.)\n\nFifth daughter: Elisabeth Gustafsdotter - married Duke Christof of\n\nMecklenburg-Schwerin. No sons.
