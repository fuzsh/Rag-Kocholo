About the Frederika Bust

Frederika of Baden was born in Karlsruhe, Stockholm, Sweden on 12 Mar. 1781. She married King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden on 31 Oct. 1797, and became queen. Her husband had arranged the marriage himself because she was the sister of the Russian Empress, which made a form of alliance with Russia even after he refused to marry the Russian Grand Duchess Alexandra Pavlovna, but mostly because he wanted a beautiful consort; in 1795, he refused a marriage with a Princess of Mecklenburg, Duchess Louise Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, because he had heard that she was not beautiful.

About How The Statuary Is Made

The Frederika Bust features the romance of days gone by. Great care has been made to capture the aesthetic qualities of both European and American craftsmanship. These masterpieces are made in one of Atlanta, Georgia’s old historic buildings. This aged structure provides an ideal home for the molding and casting process. Each individual plaster casting is then hand finished in our signature “Fossil” finish. Artisans with years of experience display artistic and technical knowledge, as well as an ability and skill in mold making. Each bust is handmade per order.
