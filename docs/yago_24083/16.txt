The wedding of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden, and Miss Silvia Sommerlath took place on Friday, 19 June 1976 at Storkyrkan. It was the first marriage of a reigning Swedish monarch since 1797 when Gustav IV Adolf married Princess Frederica of Baden. In 1972, then Crown Prince Carl Gustaf attended the Summer Olympics in Munich, West Germany, where interpreter Silvia Sommerlath was charged with escorting him. In a later interview, the King explained how it just "clicked" when they met.[2] In the subsequent years, Carl Gustaf's mother, Princess Sibylla, died, as did his grandfather, Gustaf VI Adolf, and he, therefore, acceded to the Swedish throne. On 12 March 1976, King Carl XVI Gustaf announced his engagement to Silvia Sommerlath. The King presented his fianc√©e with a single solitaire ring set with a 2-carat diamond. The ring once belonged to his late mother. The date was set for 19 June. The same date that the future King Oscar I married Josephine of Leuchtenberg in 1823 and their son, the future King Charles XV married Princess Louise of the Netherlands in 1850. The wedding began at 12:00 CET on 19 June 1976. The Church of Sweden ceremony was officiated by Olof Sundby, Archbishop of Uppsala, in Storkyrkan. At approximately 12:45, the marriage was solemnized and Sommerlath officially became Queen consort of Sweden. #RoyalWedding #SwedishRoyalFamily #SwedishRoyals #Bernadotte #KingCarlXVIGustaf #QueenSilvia #kungaparet #Monarchy #EuropeanRoyalties https://www.instagram.com/p/CQVTyCgnM9O/?utm_medium=tumblr
