        "text": "Eva Herzigová is a Czech supermodel and actress. She began her modeling career after winning a modeling beauty contest in Prague in 1989, at the age of sixteen. She was a member of Thomas Zeumer's Metropolitan Models. After arriving in Paris, her popularity increased. Her first important appearance was as the model for the first Wonderbra campaign. In 1994, advertising executive Trevor Beattie, working for TBWA/London, developed an ad for Sara Lee's \"Hello Boys\" Wonderbra campaign. It featured a close-up image of Herzigová wearing a black Wonderbra. The ad used only two words: \"Hello boys.\" The influential poster was featured in an exhibition at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and it was voted in at number 10 in a \"Poster of the Century\" contest. The Canada-based lingerie fashion label wanted the ad campaign to motivate women to see the Wonderbra \"as a cosmetic and as a beauty enhancer rather than a functional garment\". The billboard was voted in 2011 as the most iconic outdoor ad during the past five decades by the Outdoor Media Centre. She was also featured in Guess? jeans campaigns, the Victoria's Secret catalog and Sports Illustrated. Herzigová has featured in a variety of international fashion magazines, gracing the covers of Vogue (France, Britain, Spain, Germany, Japan, Australia, Mexico, Poland, Turkey, Thailand), Harper's Bazaar (Britain, Spain, Ukraine, Italy, Australia) as well as Elle, Marie Claire, Numéro and Allure. She has also walked for designers including Louis Vuitton, Benedetta Dubini, Giles Deacon, Emilio Pucci and Versace.\n\nAmongst her most recent projects, Herzigová also starred in a fashion art film by Imagine Fashion, called Decadent Control with Roberto Cavalli. It featured fashions by Agent Provocateur and H&M. Herzigová posed for the August 2004 edition of Playboy. In 2006, she portrayed Venus at the 2006 Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony. In 2016, Herzigová featured in campaigns for Giorgio Armani and Dior Beauty.\n\nStunningly beautiful and charismatic blonde Barbara Bouchet was born Barbel Goutscherola on August 15th, 1943 in Liberec, Czechoslovakia, known as Reichenberg, during the German occupation. Her father, Fritz, was a war photographer.\n\nHer family was forced to leave the country when Barbara was a little girl and her name was changed to Barbara Gutscher. They got separated, but ended up getting together again. They migrated in December 1956 and settled in San Francisco, California, where Barbara attended the prestigious Galileo High School, a polytechnic school with commercial and industrial branches. Bouchet speaks English, German and Italian with equal fluency. In an interview to Shock Cinema (Number 44), Barbara Bouchet says her name had been changed again to Bouchet at the start of her career, because it sounded like her German name.\n\nBarbara was inspired to be a screen actress after seeing the work of German actress Christine Kaufmann in Der schweigende Engel (1954) (\"The Silent Angel\").\n\nIn 1959, her father submitted a photo of her to the \"Miss Gidget\" beauty contest, and she won. The contest was held by the local television station KPIX-TV, based on the character of what has been considered the first \"beach party movie\" in Hollywood history, April entdeckt die Männer (1959). The prize included a date with James Darren the famous star of that movie, and a screen test. The screen test never materialized.\n\nBarbara was featured as a dancer on the teen-targeted rock'n'roll TV show, The KPIX Dance Party, from 1959 to 1962.\n\nBouchet began a career of teen model that led to her extensive magazine cover model (35 covers). In October 1983, at age 40, Bouchet did a nude pictorial for the Italian edition of \"Penthouse\" magazine.\n\nBarbara acted in TV commercials. She made her film debut with an uncredited bit part in the comedy Immer mit einem anderen (1964). Bouchet soon became known for openly flaunting her spectacularly curvaceous figure in several pictures: clad in alluring silk harem robes in Eine zuviel im Harem (1965), cavorting nude on the beaches of Pearl Harbor in the World War II epic Erster Sieg (1965), and wearing a bikini for the bulk of her screen time in Im Auftrag von H.A.R.M. (1966). She also portrayed \"Ursula\" in Bob Fosse's outstanding musical Sweet Charity (1969), made for a nicely sultry \"Miss Moneypenny\" in the tongue-in-cheek 007 outing Casino Royale (1967), and had guest spots on such TV series as Die Leute von der Shiloh Ranch (1962), Raumschiff Enterprise (1966), Die Seaview - In geheimer Mission (1964), and Solo für O.N.K.E.L. (1964).\n\nIn 1970, fed-up with being typecast as a mindless sexpot in Hollywood fare, she moved to Italy. She soon became one of Italy's top actresses, carving out a fruitful niche for herself in sex comedies, giallo murder mysteries and gritty crime thrillers. Among her most memorable roles in these Italian features are the brazen spoiled rich lady \"Patrizia\" in Lucio Fulci's disturbing Don't Torture a Duckling - Quäle nie ein Kind zum Scherz (1972) (\"Don't Torture A Duckling\"), prostitute \"Francine\" in Das Auge des Bösen (1972) (\"The French Sex Murders\"), modeling agency choreographer \"Kitty\" in La dama rossa uccide sette volte (1972) (\"Red Queen Kills 7 Times\"), saucy love interest \"Scilla\" in the splendidly sleazy Der Clan der Killer (1973), and enticing stripper \"Anny\" in Höllenhunde bellen zum Gebet (1976) (\"Death Rage\"). Bouchet had an unforgettably steamy lesbian love scene with Rosalba Neri in Haus der tödlichen Sünden (1972) (\"Amuck\"). Barbara Bouchet appeared alongside fellow Bond girls Barbara Bach and Claudine Auger in Der schwarze Leib der Tarantel (1971) (\"The Black Belly of the Tarantula\"). Barbara Bouchet continues to act in both films and TV shows, alike, made in Italy. Barbara popped up in a small role (as the wife of giallo star David Hemmings) in Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York (2002).\n\nBarbara married producer Luigi Borghese in 1976. They had two sons: Alessandro Borgese (b. 1974), a chef hosting a show on the Italian cable TV; and Massimiliano Borghese (b. 1989), a bartender. During the shooting of Diamond Connection (1984) in Istanbul, there was mention of a separation in the Turkish language \"New World Video & Magazine\" of September 1984, but the divorce happened much later.\n\nIn 1985, Bouchet started her own production company, opened her own health club in Rome, and launched her own line of fitness books and videos.\n\n[based on woodyanders]\n\nPetra Buckova\n\nAn actress with a wild temperament and a wide scale of facets - from crazy slapstick through irony and satire to the realms of tragedy. Having grown up in the South Bohemian town of Tabor and reaching the height of 174 centimetres (or 5 feet 8½ inches), she deemed that satisfactory and left home to pursue her calling. She was selected from many candidates to study acting at the Janacek Academy of Performing Arts (JAMU) the first year she applied, even though she could barely fit in the door back then. Over the course of the first semester, she lost 10 kilograms thanks to singing, acrobacy, ballet and karate, gradually morphing into the shape that we know nowadays.\n\nGraduate of the PADI diving course, she is equally unafraid to dive into the depths of the characters she embodies. She starred in the mini-series Jitrni zare (Morning Glow) and the streaming thriller #martyisdead, which became the first-ever Czech series to win an International Emmy. She was also a notable presence as a supporting actress in numerous Czech TV series and films including Uzly a pomerance (Scent of Orange).\n\nWith stuntsmen she trains shooting in order to kill or pursue criminals in Czech crime series such as Hlava Meduzy (Head of Medusa), Vrazdy v kruhu (The Zodiac Murders), Polda (The Cop), Specialiste (Specialists) or Sefka (Boss), while also having enjoyed some bubbles of the soap opera Ordinace v ruzove zahrade (Surgery in the Rose Garden).\n\nLiving in Prague and married to an Austrian, she knows no communication barriers. She has mastered several languages and often puts them to use in international film and TV productions. She has utilised her English in Haunted (Netflix), Carnival Row (Amazon) or The Wheel of Time, with American filmmakers often casting her as Jewish heroines in the dark times of WWII. She acted in German in Decision Game (Amazon) and Home Is Here, her French was heard in Totems (Amazon).\n\nFollowing her studies at JAMU, she went on to be an ensemble member of various high-profile theaters, such as the Petr Bezruc Theatre in Ostrava or the Goose on a String Theatre in Brno, before finally joining the Balustrade Theatre in Prague, the very theatre linked inseparably to Vaclav Havel. She is currently starring there as Marianne in Persony (Personas) based on the works of Ingmar Bergman, following notable classic roles which have included starring parts in Macbeth, Othello (performed in the English original) or The Cherry Orchard.\n\nWith utmost joy she often records audio books, being an avid lover of the microphone that won't forgive anything fake. Her voice can be heard in Lady Chatterley's Lover (D. H. Lawrence), Winesburg, Ohio (S. Anderson) or The Hours (M. Cunningham). She has been nominated twice for Neviditelný herec (Invisible Actor), the Czech radio acting award.\n\nA femme fatale in the Eva Green style at first glance, Petra Buckova can also be quite a monster, swiftly becoming any role from a screaming child to a sleazy ravisher of innocent girls. Whatever wildness she has in her, she is also able to tame it whenever needed, having portrayed an uptight school teacher and other austere parts.\n\nHer principal work method is empathy. She can tone into the frequency of others, which also allowed her to spend twelve years as part of the Czech team of hospital clowns, a work requiring an extensive sense of empathy.\n\nBorn in interwar Prague as Miroslava Stanclová, her father died and she was adopted by a Jewish doctor, the psychoanalyst Dr. Oskar Leo Stern (1900-1972) who married her mother, Miroslava (née Becka; 1898-1945). Dr. and Mrs. Stern had a son, Ivo (1931-2011), the actress's half-brother. The family was, at one point, interned in a concentration camp after they fled their native Czechoslovakia in 1939. They sought refuge in various Scandinavian countries before emigrating to Mexico in 1941.\n\nAfter winning a beauty contest in Mexico City, young Miroslava spent some time in Los Angeles studying acting. Due to her European features and accent, she rarely found roles other than mysterious women or foreign beauties. She was eventually offered a role in what would become her last and most remembered film: Luis Buñuel's Das verbrecherische Leben des Archibaldo de la Cruz (1955).\n\nSoon after the film wrapped, she committed suicide reportedly because the man she loved married another woman. In a macabre coincidence, the premiere of Das verbrecherische Leben des Archibaldo de la Cruz (1955), in which a mannequin in her likeness is incinerated, was released during her own cremation in a Mexican graveyard. Her short, tragic life inspired a short story in 1990, and a film, Miroslava (1993).\n\nEdita Brychta was born in Prague but grew up in London, having fled with her family from the 1968 Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her parents, Jan and Lida Brychta, are renowned artists who have exhibited all over the world, and her brother Alex Brychta MBE is a worldwide published book illustrator.\n\nEdita began acting as a small child in the Czech film Kinoautomat, the world's first interactive movie, which was presented at the 1967 Expo in Montreal. It wasn't until the age of 16, when she joined London's National Theatre Youth Workshop, that she abandoned her dream of being an ornithologist and decided to pursue an acting career.\n\nShe trained at LAMDA and was swiftly signed by leading agent Ken McReddie. In the UK, Edita went on to play Juliet in Romeo & Juliet, Ophelia in Hamlet, Desdemona in Othello and Marguerite in the world premiere of Vaclav Havel's Largo Desolato, directed by Tom Stoppard. She played Sybil Burlington in the award-winning West End production of Daisy Pulls It Off, produced by Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n\nStarring roles in TV series such as Maelstrom, Gentleman and Players, Lovejoy and Taggart followed, as well as the award winning The Escape (Border in the UK) and the BAFTA nominated The Britoil Affair.\n\nFlying In The Branches was created for Edita to play the leading role of a Czech girl trying to make her escape from communist occupied Czechoslovakia.\n\nThe highly publicized role of Princess Diana in NBC's Behind The Palace Doors brought Edita to the USA. She continued to work in diverse roles alongside Julia Roberts in Conspiracy Theory, Jim Carrey in Man On The Moon, James Garner in The Rockford Files and Angela Lansbury in Murder She Wrote. She also acted alongside Stellan Skarsgard and Lena Olin in the Swedish film, Friends.\n\nShe worked with directors Ronald Neame, Milos Forman, Richard Donner, and in Mark Rydell's Crime Of The Century for HBO with Isabella Rossellini and Stephen Rea.\n\nIn the Czech Republic, Edita played in her native language in two films, notably the leading role in Jan Sverak's Akumulator 1. With her language skills, she also starred in a French TV series, Cinq Filles à Paris.\n\nHer knowledge of languages, accents and dialects makes her much in demand for voiceover work in national campaigns, together with animated films such as Ice Age: Continental Drift, Cosmos and The Bunbury Tails, and numerous features including The Bourne Identity, Pirates Of The Caribbean and Man of Steel, as the voice of the mother ship.\n\nAmong many video games featuring her voiceover talents are Ming Xiao in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines. She has featured in radio plays for the BBC, including the critically acclaimed Me, Cheeta: My Life in Hollywood with John Malkovich.\n\nEdita has voiced many audio books including Jane Goodall's Seeds of Hope and was nominated for an Audie for the trilogy, This Man. She performed a live narration for Leonard Bernstein's The Kaddish at Royce Hall in Los Angeles.\n\nFor LA Theatre Works, she featured in Daniel Deronda, A Room With a View, Watch on the Rhine and the Tony-award-winning Oslo.\n\nEdita is married to producer David Ladd and has one daughter, Lauren Cassidy, by a previous marriage.\n\nHer passion is open water swimming and she has completed four swims from Alcatraz Island, the length of the Golden Gate Bridge three times and the 10K distance from the Golden Gate Bridge to the Bay Bridge twice, winning numerous medals.\n\nUpdated Jan 11, 2020\n\nKlára Issová is a Czech actress with Syrian roots.
