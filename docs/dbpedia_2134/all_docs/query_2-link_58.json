        "text": "Czechia secured 28th place in the Olympic medal rankings at the Paris Games, marking its lowest medal count in its independent history. Czech athletes won five medals, including three golds and two bronzes, a significant drop from the 11 medals won in Tokyo. The United States led the rankings with 40 golds and 126 total medals, followed by China and Japan. Czech golds were achieved by tennis players Kateřina Siniaková and Tomáš Macháč in mixed doubles, and canoeists Martin Fuksa and Josef Dostál, with additional bronze medals won by the épée fencing team and javelin thrower Nikola Ogrodníková.\n\nThe number of children with eating disorders in Czechia has significantly increased, particularly among girls, with a 200% rise since 2010, now affecting around 3,500 children. This surge, highlighted by data from the Institute of Health Information and analyzed by iROZHLAS, saw a notable spike following the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychologist Tereza Maková advises parents to be vigilant for changes in eating habits, excessive focus on food, overeating, or reluctance to discuss food.\n\nCzechia recorded its lowest-ever medal count at the Paris Olympics, securing only three gold and two bronze medals. These results fall short of the country's previous lowest tally at the 2008 Beijing Games. Despite the disappointing overall result, Czech Olympic Committee President Jiří Kejval and mission head Martin Doktor remained positive, emphasizing the significance of the three gold medals won by Czech athletes. Notable victories included Martin Fuksa and Josef Dostál in canoe and kayak events, and a surprise bronze in javelin by Nikola Ogrodníková. Despite the challenges, the leaders highlighted the strong participation and the vibrant atmosphere in Paris.\n\nMinister for Regional Development Ivan Bartoš from the Pirate Party announced that the digitalized construction permit system in Czechia will become fully operational in August. Despite criticisms of the system's initial rollout in July, Bartoš assured that key updates are planned for this month and that most issues are being addressed. Around 64% of the 6,000 applications submitted so far are in progress, with approximately 500 decisions made, mainly occupancy permits. The seemingly mundane administrative issue has become a highly politicized problem for Bartoš with opposition calling for his resignation over the system's challenges.\n\nElectric vehicle sales in Czechia grew by 44% in the first seven months of 2024, reaching nearly 5,000 units. Hybrid car sales also saw a 36% increase, with over 30,000 vehicles sold. According to the Czech Car Importers Association, electric vehicles now account for 3.65% of all registered passenger cars, while hybrids make up 22.1%. Tesla led electric car sales with 2,000 units, followed by Škoda and Volvo. In the hybrid market, Toyota topped the list, followed by Škoda and Volvo. Overall, new car sales in Czechia rose by nearkly 4 percent during the same period.\n\nYear-on-year inflation in July is expected to have remained at 2%, the same as in June, according to analysts surveyed by the Czech Press Agency. Consumer prices increased by 0.5% compared to the previous month, driven by higher fuel and food prices, as well as increases in housing, dining, and recreational services. The Czech National Bank also forecasted 2% inflation for July. The Czech Statistical Office will release the official data on Monday. Inflation is expected to fluctuate slightly in the coming months, with projections of 1.8% in August and 2.3% in September.\n\nSince its launch, 36% of Czechs have tried ChatGPT, and nearly two-thirds are familiar with it. The AI tool is particularly popular among younger users, with over half of those under 26 using it actively, often as a work aid. A survey by Enehano software company shows that over a quarter of young users engage with ChatGPT weekly, and some use it daily. However, the systematic integration of AI in businesses is still lagging. Around 7% of people see the potential for ChatGPT in their work but choose not to use it, while 2% express concerns about the technology.\n\nJavelin thrower Nikola Ogrodníková, who won a bronze medal, will carry the Czech flag alongside canoeist Martin Fuksa at the closing ceremony of the Paris Olympics, the Czech Olympic Committee announced. This marks the first time in Olympic history that two flag bearers will represent the Czech Republic at both the opening and closing ceremonies. Ogrodníková expressed her deep emotion and honor at being chosen, especially after her medal win. The ceremony will take place at Stade de France, starting at 9:00 PM on Sunday.\n\nDespite improvements in attitudes towards sexual minorities in the Czech Republic, participants of the Prague Pride parade emphasized that LGBT+ individuals still lack equal rights. They called particularly for the same-sex marriage. Many attendees joined the parade to advocate for these rights while also enjoying the event’s atmosphere of solidarity, joy, and tolerance. Although Czech lawmakers have rejected equal marriage, same-sex couples will be able to form partnerships with most marriage rights starting next year. Activists plan to continue pushing for full marriage equality.\n\nTens of thousands of people participated in the Prague Pride parade on Saturday, marching from Wenceslas Square to Letná Plain to support LGBT+ rights. The event, part of a week-long festival, saw participants in colorful outfits, waving rainbow flags, and was attended by politicians, diplomats, and activists. Increased police presence ensured safety due to recent threats at a similar event in Bratislava, but no incidents were reported. This year's festival theme is \"family,\" with various activities and performances planned throughout the day. The Prague Pride festival, now in its 14th year, first took place in 2011."
