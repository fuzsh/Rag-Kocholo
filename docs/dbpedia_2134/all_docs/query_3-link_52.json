The CCEC aims to foster ties between the United States and the Czech Republic in the areas of culture, education and civil society.\n\nThe CCEC is committed to the exchange of knowledge and ideas — exchange necessary for citizens to better understand not just their own their societies and cultures, but to appreciate the importance and contributions of cultures outside their own borders."
