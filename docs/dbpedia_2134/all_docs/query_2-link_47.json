However, she never managed to establish herself as a leading name in the Italian cinema of those years, always being considered, both by the public and the critics, a second-rate performer. In the post-war period she took part in a few more films, which were not particularly successful; later, after marrying a Roman antique dealer, she decided to give up acting and devote herself to her family. \n\t\n\tA discrete filmography remains of her, including titles that made a sort of history of Italian society at the turn of the 1930s (I grandi magazzini, by Mario Camerini) and the 1940s (Ecco la radio!, by Giacomo Gentilomo). While she mostly had supporting parts she had the lead in La signorina (László Kish, 1942), a romantic comedy about the young daughter of a libertine (Loredana), who is entrusted to the care of a novelist (Nino Besozzi), who agrees to be her father. The novelist also finds a suitable boy for her as a husband (Paolo Stoppa), but then discovers that he is the lover of his wife (Laura Nucci). Despite these and other twists and turns, the happy ending sees love blossom between the ward and her guardian. \n\t\n\tWhile she had a major supporting part in the adventure film  Il figlio del corsaro rosso (Marco Elter, 1943), Loredana had the female lead in the sequel, Gli ultimi filibustieri (Elter, 1943) - both films being based on Emilio Salgari. She also starred in La gondola del diavolo by Carlo Campogalliani, one of the last films shot the Venice Cinevillaggio during the war, and released after the war, in 1946. The plot deals with a serial killer in medieval Venice. Loredana's last part was as the family's daughter in Aldo Fabrizi's interesting film Emigrantes (1949) about Italian emigrants leaving for Argentina but finding hardship there.\n\t\n\tSources: Italian Wikipedia, IMDb.",
