Can't you tell?\n\nKiss me, my girl. Kiss me now\n\nKiss me. Do not shun love\n\nYour eyes are so seductive\n\nCome here, girl. Come closer to me\n\nWell this here is Adina.\n\nAdina Mandlov.\n\nAnd this is me.\n\nAnd this here is Ljuba Hermanov.\n\nI don't know, but I think this\n\nis going to be the last conversation\n\nI will ever have.\n\nI'm not sure why I agreed to it.\n\nMaybe you have a yearning\n\nfor the Czech language.\n\nAre you in touch\n\nwith any fellow countrymen at all?\n\nWell, there are plenty of Czechs\n\nhere in Salzburg, but...\n\nI don't really go out anymore.\n\nRight. Let's start.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia\n\nyou were already famous in the 1930s.\n\nYou were young, beautiful\n\nand idolized by men.\n\nYou had a brilliant career ahead of you.\n\nBut in 1934 everything\n\nchanged dramatically, didn't it?\n\nResponsible for that was Milo Havel,\n\nproprietor of the Barrandov Studios.\n\nMy mother wanted to realize her unfilled\n\ndesire of being an actress through me.\n\nThat's why she was thrilled when Havel\n\nfinally invited us into his office.\n\nThe day after tomorrow\n\nyou'll be expected at the UFA Studios.\n\nIn Babelsberg.\n\nSo we did it.\n\nMilo.\n\nYour partner will be either\n\nRolf Wanka or Gustav Frhlich.\n\nGustav Frhlich?\n\nAll of Prague is at your feet.\n\nNow you can take Berlin by storm.\n\nI want to go to the academy of music\n\ntoo, but I'll never be as good as you.\n\nZorka, you could be better than me.\n\nBut you have to work at it\n\nand not let anyone push you aside.\n\nBeing successful is a struggle.\n\nIt's a struggle?\n\nA struggle.\n\nGirls, go to sleep.\n\nWhat is it, Papa?\n\nWhat is it'?\n\nWhen did you grow so tall'?\n\nNot long ago we were\n\npushing you around in a baby carriage.\n\nI will miss you. Do you know that?\n\nMama wants you\n\nto be successful so badly, but...\n\nI'm not so sure\n\nit's a good thing you're going there.\n\nAh Well...\n\nIn Czechoslovakia\n\nyou're a movie star, Lduka.\n\nBehave accordingly.\n\nI never managed to have a career,\n\nas you know.\n\nSo now you will make my dream come true.\n\nRight. Bye.\n\nThe lighting's set.\n\nMake-up, get over here!\n\nLast preparations!\n\nSet camera!\n\nGet out of the frame!\n\nI beg you, please get out of the frame.\n\nDirector!\n\nYes, Lda?\n\nI thought my partner\n\nwas going to be Gustav Frhlich?\n\nYou don't approve of Rolf Wanka?\n\nNo, that's not what I meant.\n\nWe're getting started.\n\nIt's just...\n\nQuiet!\n\nQuiet please, we're rolling.\n\nEveryone ready?\n\nRoll camera!\n\nMark it.\n\nRehearsal \"Barcarole\", take one!\n\nAction!\n\nWhat?\n\nPlease answer me!\n\nThat\n\nthere was nothing until now\n\nbut bleak, barren nothingness.\n\nIn for a penny,\n\nin for a pound.\n\nPound.\n\nFund'?\n\nCut!\n\n\"Pound\", you see?\n\nMiss, try and get it right. \"Pound\".\n\nThat's Lda Baarov.\n\nTry to give it a wider sound. \"Pound\".\n\nPound.\n\nThere, you see?\n\nLet's take it from the top, okay?\n\nPound?\n\nRoll camera!\n\nRehearsal \"Barcarole\", take two.\n\nAnd action!\n\nIn for a penny,\n\nin for a pound.\n\nPund.\n\nPound.\n\nCut!\n\nOnce more. And please try\n\nto pronounce it right. \"Pound\".\n\nOkay?\n\nSo, once more. Quiet, please!\n\n\"Pound.\" - Roll camera.\n\nRehearsal \"Barcarole\", take three.\n\nAnd action!\n\nIn for a penny, in for a pound.\n\nPond. Pond?\n\nCut! If she concentrates on\n\nthe pronunciation, she forgets to act.\n\nIt's useless. She's too distraught now.\n\nMama, they're laughing at me.\n\nThey may be laughing at you now,\n\nbut one day\n\nthey will bow down before you.\n\nCome on.\n\nGood day.\n\nMilo Havel ensured me\n\nBaarov could speak German.\n\nThe little doe\n\nis absolutely enchanting, Correll.\n\nWho's idea was it anyway\n\nto cast Wanka as \"Count Colloredo\"?\n\nHe speaks with a Viennese accent!\n\nOriginally we wanted Gustav Frhlich,\n\nbut his financial demands were...\n\nFrhlich is a star. Pay him!\n\nIt'll be worth our while.\n\nSo what about Baarov?\n\nYou got her over here, Mr. Correll.\n\nDon't ask me.\n\nAccording to the script\n\n\"Giacinta\" is Italian.\n\nIt demands a dark-haired type.\n\nMiss Baarov would be perfect for it.\n\nBut I don't know if she can manage with\n\nthe lines. - What do you say, Miss Hahn?\n\nMiss Baarov speaks German\n\nwith a typical Prague accent.\n\nShe has to get rid of the accent\n\nand learn the proper intonation.\n\nIt can be done.\n\nThe hat.\n\nHat.\n\nMy hat,\n\nit is three-cornered.\n\nThree-cornered is my hat.\n\nAnd if it isn't three-cornered,\n\nit cannot be my hat.\n\nWould he come from Oberammergau,\n\nor would he come from Unterammergau,\n\nor would he come at all?\n\nIt was uncertain.\n\nPlease.\n\nMy hat, it is threecornered.\n\nThree-cornered is my hat.\n\nAnd if it isn't three-cornered,\n\nit cannot be my hat.\n\nFaster!\n\nHans is coming home, Lies is happy...\n\nWould he come from Oberammergau,\n\nor would he come from Unterammergau,\n\nor...\n\nFaster, faster!\n\nIf Elisabeth's legs weren't as pretty...\n\nFaster still!\n\nA pug spotted a bowl of milk\n\nand took an enormous gulp.\n\nThe cook grabbed himself a ladle\n\nand beat it to a pulp.\n\nNow that's a great start.\n\nHer German is okay.\n\nNow have her sing and dance.\n\nNow please sing something for us\n\nand dance with it.\n\nWhat makes the Rhine so beautiful?\n\nWhat makes the Rhine so beautiful?\n\nWhat makes the Rhine so beautiful?\n\nWhat makes the Rhine so beautiful?\n\nThe Rhine so beautiful?\n\nBecause the girls are so trusty\n\nAnd the boys are so thirsty\n\nBecause the girls are so trusty\n\nAnd the boys are so thirsty\n\nBecause the girls are so trusty\n\nAnd the boys are so thirsty\n\nThat makes the Rhine so beautiful\n\nThe Rhine\n\nSO:\n\nbeautiful!\n\nBravo! Very good!\n\nBeautiful. Beautiful!\n\nThey engaged me.\n\nBarcarole...\n\nWe start at 7:\n\n37 in studio 4.\n\nMr. Frhlich?\n\nAh, Miss Baarov, at last!\n\nIt is an honor.\n\nI've seen all your movies.\n\nI'm looking forward to working with you.\n\nSo do I.\n\nYou look wonderful there.\n\nBut a little tame for a lover,\n\ndon't you think?\n\nAh, you've already met!\n\nOur young actress is very talented\n\nand extraordinarily observant.\n\nA good choice.\n\nCongratulations!\n\nThank you.\n\nLda is the best of all Czech actresses.\n\nThis will be her first German movie.\n\nLda, please get ready.\n\nShall we go?\n\nTake two identical ones, okay?\n\nSuddenly my girlhood dream came true.\n\nI was in front of the camera\n\nwith Gustav Frhlich.\n\nAnd action!\n\nIt was beautiful, wasn't it?\n\nGiacinta,\n\naren't you afraid\n\nit will never again be this beautiful?\n\nNo.\n\nIt will always be\n\nincreasingly beautiful.\n\nIncreasingly beautiful.\n\nYes.\n\nI'm just a little tired, you know?\n\nCut.\n\nWe're doing this scene for the 5th time.\n\nThere's really no other way to tell you\n\nthis, Miss Baarov, but your accent...\n\nDon't you think you're overreacting?\n\nShe plays an Italian. She can have\n\na small accent. Just let her talk.\n\nIt sounds unnatural.\n\nBut most charming.\n\nIf it doesn't bother you...\n\nOnce more from the top.\n\nThank you.\n\nThere's no need to thank me.\n\nI have reasons of my own.\n\n[So this was the man of my dreams: Gust].\n\nI had come to take Berlin by storm,\n\nand soon Gustav Frhlich,\n\nfilm star and idol of all German women,\n\ninvited me to dinner."
