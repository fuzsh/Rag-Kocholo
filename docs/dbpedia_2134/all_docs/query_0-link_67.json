        "text": "This text explores Lída Baarová (2016) by Filip Renč, a film that exceeds the limits of storytelling practices shaping views on female emancipation. Altman’s semantic/syntactic/pragmatic approach to the genre frames the deconstruction of the film as an example of non-random cannibalization of narrative strategies and cultural codes. Introducing Renč’s filmography sheds light on a specific set of intertexts for contextualizing Lída Baarová as mixing meta-cinematic farce and female bildungsroman. Examining Lída Baarová in the context of European meta-cinematic farce about female representatives of mass culture in fascist regimes aims to recognize the pathway of musealizing the totalitarian past. The comparison of Lída Baarová with Lili Marleen (1981), Marlene (2000) and especially La niña de tus ojos (1998) reveals the contest between multi-layered visual matches of Lída Baarová with these films and consistent deconstruction of the meta-cinematic farce in favor of reintroducing the binary distinction between us/them. Seeing Lída Baarová embedded in the formation of female bildungsroman directly addresses the role of the our/their dichotomy in building the Czech nation. Comparing From Subway with Love (2004) and Lída Baarová points to the intertextuality that interprets Lída Baarová as exaggerating the core of the master coming-of-age narrative. By juxtaposing meta-cinematic farce and bildungsroman, Lída Baarová determines the deconstruction of both units of cultural information and limited spectatorial pleasure from pedagogical emotions. Deconstructing Lída Baarová as a film crossing the borders between national and international narratives restores particular options for reengagement with sensitive issues of the post-socialist production and consumption of films.\n\nGender is rarely considered in the works on state socialism in Czech history writing. Given the prominence of the equality of the sexes in communist rhetoric and the heated anti- and pro-feminism media and intellectual debates of the 1990s, the omission stands out as a remarkable loss of opportunity in historical research. It also defies logic. For if “emancipation” and “equality” were so strongly present in pre-1989 discourse and women constituted half the population, does it not follow that the plain demographic fact should drive the interest of researchers to inquire where this population was, what it did, and what it had to say? The question has so far attracted primarily sociologists, but how does it fare in historiography? What are the losses of the absence and the gains of the inclusion of a gender perspective on the history and memory-making of state socialism? This article will first consider the status quo of gender blindness in Czech historiography and its possible reason...\n\nIn East-Central Europe, Marxist humanism embodied one of the most promising theoretical developments of the 1960s. While respecting the unquestionable value of this intellectual current, this article highlights the contradiction between the emancipatory proclamations of humanist intellectuals and their reluctance to recognize certain prevalent forms of oppression. After comparing the humanist approach toward gender-structured themes in the former Czechoslovakia with the contrasting techno-optimist approach, the latter group is shown to have been more sensitive toward women’s issues. The article concludes that there was an intrinsic problem in Marxist humanist theory that contributed to this historical shortcoming in its emancipatory efforts.\n\nTHE AIDS OUTBREAK IN THE TIME OF NORMALIZED BOREDOM The bleak time of ‘normalization’, the image of suffocating ennui so well described in Václav Havel’s phrase, ‘the bleak sky [of] boredom and mortifying eventlessness’ (cited in Oates-Indruchová 2002: 54), has become one of the quintessential associations of the period of late socialism. However, portraying this long period as one overdrawn moment of tedious stasis makes invisible the intense ideological labour spent on producing and maintaining the aura of quiet, content and conflict-free ‘normalized’ times. Socialism, as Alexei Yurchak argues, appeared to ‘be forever’ until it was suddenly ‘no more’ (Yurchak 2006). Even if in retrospect – a retrospect often informed by a powerful abjection of the ‘shameful’ communist past – the fall of the regime might appear inevitable and only a question of time, Yurchak documents how on the contrary it came as a surprise, a ‘stunning shock’ experienced as a ‘break of consciousness’ (ibid.: 2). Similarly Michal Pullmann’s most recent study of perestroika (přestavba) radically questions the notion of the foreseeable end of socialism and reinterprets perestroika as an experiment in the transformation of state socialism, an experiment invested in an attempt to renegotiate and re-establish the waning ideological consensus that the socialist state is – despite its drawbacks – the best state order imaginable (Pullmann 2011). Breaking down the presumption of ‘the “totality” of the communist experience’ (Bren 2010: 3), recent scholarship has instead drawn attention to moments of friction, fissures and ways of differentiating investment in the (dis-)continuities of the socialist present. My reading of Kopytem sem, kopytem tam (A Tainted Horseplay; dir. Věra Chytilová 1988), a film rendition of the ‘bleak times of normalization’ and the first and only Czech(oslovak) full-length feature film dealing with HIV and AIDS, builds on these differing investments. Reading A Tainted Horseplay I attempt to make visible the ideological labour invested in re-creating and re-construing the socialist consensus and in negotiating the ambivalences and contradictions that shaped socialist reality....\n\nThe hostility that met feminist ideas and gender equality issues in East Central Europe (ECE) after the demise of the Communist regimes was accompanied by a notion that feminism was imported to these societies after 1989. In the Czech Republic, the record of the publishing output by feminist scholars in the 1990s, however, rather speaks against this myth. Drawing on existing scholarship and author’s own research on cultural discourses of gender and on state-socialist science policies and censorship, this article argues that there has been a long tradition of gender critique that was present in a variety of discourses even during late state socialism. It proposes that the feminist impulse begun in the 19th century continued in some form throughout the 20th century. It then examines how the myth of the feminist import came to exist and what were the possible sources of the hostility against feminism in the 1990s.\n\nThe paper analyses a subliminal backlash against feminism paradoxically within the very cultural context that founded its legitimacy in the discourse of human rights, equality and justice, namely the context of cultural activities or more specifically literary outcomes of the then anti-establishment, dissident activism in former pre-1989 Czechoslovakia. In several literary texts it tracks down de-centred, intra-active entanglements of discursive and affective mechanisms of silencing (foreclosure) of feminist activism by those (ex post) highly prestigious, dignified, symbolically loaded dissident cultural discourses. The paper focuses specifically on the ways gender was dispossessed, ridiculed, trivialised, and silenced in analysed literary texts by processes of interpellating readers through positive, dignified values and identities that were however at the same time essentially wounding and dis-empowering. In this regard it is clear that in the given literary texts, the microphysics of epistemic violence and the work of self-oppression and self-silencing was not only invisible and performed by those very subjects suffering its consequences but also carried out by them in paradoxically affectively engaged manner."
