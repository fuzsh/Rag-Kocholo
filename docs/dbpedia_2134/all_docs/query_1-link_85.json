During these years, he went on to join the African National Congress (ANC) in which a group of young Africans aimed to start a mass grassroots movement to voice the concerns of rural peasants and working people.

He utilised his practical insight and common sense to bring triumph to the country as a brilliant military strategist and savvy leader. It was not just his military genius that set him apart, but his gradual plan to bring freedom to the slaves through his tactical Emancipation Proclamation which paved the way for the abolishment of slavery in America.\n\nDr APJ Abdul Kalam\n\n“Dream, dream, dream.

From little black dresses, tweed jackets, bell-bottomed pants, gold-chained handbags, menswear and womenswear to their signature scent, Coco Chanel has contributed to the sphere of fashion and design making her one of the great personalities.\n\nCoco’s intense belief that fashion cannot be restricted to couture clothing brought accessories and fragrances as an essential part of fashion. She worked as a seamstress and stage performer to save money to put up her first store. In 1913, Coco managed to open her first shop in Paris followed by another in Deauville.\n\nHer affection and passion for every item produced by the brand made her a fashion icon in no time.
