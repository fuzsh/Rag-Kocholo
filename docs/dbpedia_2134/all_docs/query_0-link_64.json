        "text": "The very last social call Adolf Hitler made, before he retreated for ever into his bunker as the Red Army closed in on Berlin in April 1945, was on Joseph and Magda Goebbels. He brought his own cake and flask of tea with him to their villa, and when he left Magda said triumphantly: “He would not have gone to the Goerings!” Her husband duly recorded this remark the following day.\n\nJoseph Goebbels began his diary in 1925, as a 27-year-old failed novelist and playwright, and kept it meticulously until 10 April 1945. He was well aware of the diaries’ historical and commercial value and in the late 1930s struck a very lucrative deal with Max Amann, the Nazi party’s publisher, for their publication 20 years after his death. In fact, the first selection in English came out in 1948 and there have been further extracts over the years but, because large portions were carted off to Moscow, the diaries were not published in full, in 29 volumes, until 2008. Peter Longerich’s biography is the first to make use of the complete edition.\n\nThe story it tells is familiar in outline – the failed intellectual finds his destiny as the propaganda genius of the Nazi party, choreographs the Nuremberg rallies, creates the Führer myth, is the only Nazi leader to show his face in public after wartime air raids, and, in the final Götterdämmerung, remains loyal to his Führer by committing suicide with his wife after murdering their children. But the extra material now available allows Longerich to bring his subject more sharply into focus. Goebbels was driven not simply by a need to compensate for his small stature and deformed foot, but by a profound narcissistic need for attention and admiration. At the same time, he was psychologically completely dependent on Hitler, who used him mercilessly. Goebbels’s marriage in 1931 to the rich divorcee Magda Quandt created a curious emotional triangle: Hitler was in love with Magda and spent much time alone with her, without ever consummating the relationship. And, because this arrangement suited Hitler so well, Goebbels miscalculated badly when he tried to ditch Magda for his mistress, the Czech actress Lída Baarová. Magda immediately appealed to Hitler, who forced Goebbels to stay with his wife.\n\nLongerich also brings out very well Goebbels’s role in paving the way for the Holocaust, by propaganda and antisemitic agitation. The radical instincts that had in earlier years led him to flirt with socialism had by this time been channelled completely into hatred of the Jews; and, at times when he was out of favour, whipping up antisemitic feeling was a way of getting back into Hitler’s good books.\n\nBut the real revelation is that Goebbels’s importance within the Third Reich has always been greatly exaggerated, thanks to his own propaganda, the diaries, and the feeling of historians such as Alan Bullock and Hugh Trevor-Roper that he was the only really interesting man in the Nazi leadership beside Hitler. Goebbels was often a marginal figure, outside the decision-making loop. He played no part in the slippery manoeuvring that brought the Nazis to power in 1933 or in the Night of the Long Knives, when Hitler had his rivals in the party murdered. Unlike Goering, Himmler, Bormann and Speer, Goebbels never created a power base of his own independent of Hitler – except, arguably, at the very end of the war – and frequently had to appeal to the Führer to fend off challenges to his authority. Whenever Hitler made sudden changes of policy – such as the Nazi-Soviet Pact of 1939 – Goebbels would faithfully swing into action to justify the new line.\n\nBut if Goebbels wasn’t really that important, why write such an enormous book on him? This is where the diaries are as much a curse as a blessing: Longerich is far too dependent on them and seldom applies his own dictum of weighing them against other sources. Also, the rigidly chronological approach that worked well in his biography of Heinrich Himmler here produces much needless repetition and greatly lengthens the book: every spat with rivals such as Rosenberg or Ribbentrop is faithfully recorded. The discussion of news management, cultural policy, and how morale was sustained in wartime contains rich and fascinating material – even Goebbels couldn’t put a positive spin on Rudolf Hess’s flight to Britain – but is too piecemeal to be easy to follow. And Longerich doesn’t have much low human curiosity; although he assiduously chronicles Goebbels’s love affairs, he never manages to bring any of his women to life. Even Magda remains a colourless figure – which, as we know from Speer and others, she was not.\n\nThis is a major work of scholarship but not, I fear, the last word on its subject."
