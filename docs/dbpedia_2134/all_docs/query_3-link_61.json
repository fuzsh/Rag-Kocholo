        "text": "Austrian actor Karl Markovics (The Counterfeiters , The Grand Budapest Hotel) will play Joseph Goebbels and the German actor Gedeon Burkhard (Inglourious Basterds) plays Lída Baarová’s partner, actor Gustav Fröhlich. Ivan Hubač wrote the script.\n\nThe film is produced by the Czech agency NoGup, which also produced the hit Babovresky 2. The estimated budget is 2,8m EUR/ 80 m CZK. The State Cinematography Fund is supporting with approximately a half million EUR/15m CZK.\n\nAccording to the Czech press agency CTK quoting the producer, distributors from the UK and the USA have shown their interest, including Monty Pythons’ producer Kent Walwin and Graham King’s U.S. Initial Entertainment Group.\n\nGerman TV channels are also interested in buying, so the director is considering making both German and Czech versions of the film. The release is planned for 2016.\n\nProduction Information:\n\nNoGup\n\nKaprova 14/13, 110 00 Praha 1\n\nThis email address is being protected from spambots.
