        "text": "Jewish pigs!\n\nDamned Jews!\n\nMove, move!\n\nWhat in God's name is going on?\n\nThe Nuremburg Laws in practice,\n\nMiss Baarov.\n\nJEW:\n\nI left Berlin at one minute past 12.\n\nThis fascist frenzy later became known\n\nas \"The Reichskristallnacht\".\n\nThe biggest pogrom against Jews\n\nin Germany before the war started.\n\nWhere are you taking us, Hans?\n\nWe should've reached the border ages ago.\n\nWhen the Sudentenland was taken the old\n\nborder vanished. There's no new one yet.\n\nThe trains to Berlin pass through here.\n\nI'll take the first train back.\n\nYou drive to Prague in the car.\n\nOkay.\n\nThank you very much, Hans.\n\nI don't want any money.\n\nThen how can I show my gratitude?\n\nIf you'd allow me to... Just once...\n\nKiss me?\n\nStroke your breasts?\n\nNow I can die in peace.\n\nThank you.\n\nA wonderful villa, Papa.\n\nThat was the living room,\n\nand this here is my study.\n\nIt's beautiful here.\n\nThanks to you.\n\nLet me show you the kitchen.\n\nCome on, Mama and Zorka\n\nhave prepared us a meal. - Papa.\n\nPlease put a record on.\n\nBut nothing by Wagner.\n\nSure.\n\nA celebrated star\n\nof the film world,\n\nand you flee like a thief.\n\nI don't understand.\n\nYou did nothing wrong.\n\nShe was seeing Goebbels, that's all.\n\nHe got her into this. - Be quiet!\n\nYou don't understand a thing.\n\nZorka's right, Mama.\n\nThat's how it was.\n\nNo,\n\nso many people worship you!\n\nThey can't just erase you.\n\nThey will occupy our border territories\n\nand liquidate the Jews.\n\nThey want to conquer the whole world.\n\nThey can do anything they want.\n\nDidn't you know of it before?\n\nI'd never go with a Nazi.\n\nBe quiet.\n\nNever. Be quiet!\n\nSo how about your latest film?\n\n\"A Prussian Love Story?\"\n\nIt was the first to be banned.\n\nBecause of you?\n\nThey had no other reason to.\n\nWe can't just put up with this.\n\nWe have to defend ourselves.\n\nYou have to defend yourself.\n\nMama, the order\n\ncame directly from the Fhrer.\n\nYou don't like it.\n\nYet I made every effort.\n\nYou're so careless, Lda.\n\nBringing only a single case.\n\nWere you going\n\nto leave everything in Berlin?\n\nShe barely manage to save her skin.\n\nAll right, but...\n\nshe could've worn\n\nthe silver-fox jacket!\n\nSilverfox jacket?\n\nThat's all you care about.\n\nYou go and get it!\n\nHow could you have a relationship\n\nwith such a man, Lda?\n\nI just fell in love.\n\nI have no other explanation.\n\nNo one will believe you here.\n\nThis is Czechoslovakia.\n\nEnvy rules all,\n\nand success is inexcusable.\n\nIf I'd been in your shoes,\n\nI'd never have done such a thing.\n\nAnd you didn't need it.\n\nAre you condemning me too, Zorka?\n\nHello, girls!\n\nHello. Listen,\n\nyou know the difference between Goebbels\n\nand a horse? - Cut it out, Ljuba!\n\nThere is none.\n\nBoth have hooves and stupid ideas.\n\nWhat brings you to the Protectorate\n\nof Bohemia and Moravia, Lduka?\n\nYour stupid jokes, Ljuba.\n\nI missed them so much.\n\nMy jokes may be stupid, but unlike you,\n\nI don't hang out with Nazis!\n\nApparently no one is as handsome\n\nas Frhlich or as clever as Goebbels.\n\nRemember? Didn't I warn you:\n\n\"Don't come crying later on.\"\n\nI'm not crying, my dear.\n\nIn Czechoslovakia\n\nI felt like a stranger.\n\nLuckily my friend\n\nMilo Havel helped me again.\n\nHe'd made it possible for me\n\nto play in a few Czech movies.\n\nAfter that I shot some films in Italy.\n\nUnfortunately, at the end of the war\n\nI returned to Czechoslovakia.\n\nIn September of 1945\n\nI was charged with treason.\n\nMiss Baarov,\n\nI regard you very highly as an actress,\n\nand I really like your films.\n\nI like \"The Masked Lover\" best.\n\nA fitting title.\n\nIt is befitting of you.\n\nCigarette?\n\nThank you.\n\nYou cannot deny your relationships\n\nwith some famous Nazis.\n\nI came home before the end of the war.\n\nThat put an end to it all.\n\nI see.\n\nThey sent you\n\nto Czechoslovakia as a secret agent.\n\nRubbish.\n\nI'd like to know\n\nwhat you're accusing me of?\n\nMe?\n\nNothing.\n\nYou'll learn all the charges when\n\nyou appear before the people's court.\n\nI hate to say it,\n\nbut I fear the worst.\n\nWhich is?\n\nThe gallows.\n\nYou lied to us.\n\nWe found all of your jewelry\n\nwith the family of director Svitak.\n\nHow did it get there?\n\nWe... I hid it With them.\n\nI was afraid it might be taken from us.\n\nCould I have some water, please?\n\nThe property of all traitors\n\nand collaborators will be confiscated.\n\nIncluding that of your darling daughter\n\nwho did so well for herself.\n\nLdunka never betrayed anyone.\n\nYou're right there.\n\nShe's remained faithful.\n\nTo Goebbels.\n\nTell us! What was it like?\n\nPlease, just a little water.\n\nSo which of these jewels\n\ndid your daughter get from him?\n\nYou know they were all stolen from Jews?\n\nI need something to drink.\n\nYou're not in a caf here.\n\nTalk.\n\nYour little Nazi daughter\n\nwill end up at the gallows anyway.\n\nYou know what happens next.\n\nYou old comedic whore!\n\nNot the gallows.\n\nStop putting on an act.\n\nWe'll get it out of you anyway.\n\nDamn.\n\nHow do you feel?\n\nThere's a tuberculous\n\ninflammation in your ankle.\n\nYou'll have to stay in bed\n\nfor three months. Maybe longer.\n\nWe will try to save your foot.\n\nI can't afford to lie here\n\nfor three months, Doctor.\n\nMy daughter needs me. She's in prison.\n\nIf you're not patient,\n\nyou will lose your leg.\n\nNurse.\n\nDoctor, could you come here, please?\n\nBaarov, your mother just died.\n\nNurse!\n\nDoctor!\n\nWhat are you running around for?\n\nYou should be lying down!\n\nI want you to solve my problem radically.\n\nExcuse me?\n\nMy wife died yesterday.\n\nNow it's up to me\n\nto get my daughter out of prison.\n\nI have to get out of here as quickly\n\nas possible or she'll be convicted.\n\nI'd been in prison for almost a year\n\nwhen my sister visited me in the spring.\n\nZorka was very frail\n\nand mentally unstable.\n\nI could see that the horror\n\nwas beyond her strength.\n\nAt times she seemed rather confused.\n\nThey mustn't execute you.\n\nIt's spring again outside.\n\nZorka.\n\nI fear the longing is driving me mad.\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat are you talking about?\n\nI met Frantiek.\n\nApparently...\n\nhe doesn't love me anymore.\n\nWait, dear, how is Father?\n\nI'm burning up.\n\nThis shouldn't have happened, Lda.\n\nNo one talks to me at the theater.\n\nDuring rehearsals they all\n\nturn their back on me or say nothing.\n\nBecause I'm your sister.\n\nVisiting time's over.\n\nWait...\n\nEnough!\n\nGod protect you.\n\nWait...\n\nWhat shouldn't have happened?\n\nZorka.\n\n\"And I, of ladies most deject\n\nand wretched...\"\n\nLike sweet bells jangled\n\nout of tune and harsh.\n\nThat unmatched form and feature\n\nof blown youth blasted with ecstasy.\"\n\nEcstasy...\n\nMiss, stop looking for the verse.\n\nYou will no longer play Ophelia.\n\nAm I right, Comrade Director?\n\nExcuse me, I just forget two words.\n\nIt won't happen again.\n\nLda Baarov's sister\n\nhas no place among Czech artists.\n\nIt's the end of the line for you.\n\nWe, actors\n\nand members of the Communist Party,\n\nforbid you\n\nto set foot in the theater again.\n\nPlease, Mr. Vydra!\n\nWhat are you looking at? Leave here\n\nand never come back.\n\nPlease.\n\nAnd we will continue,\n\nam I right, Comrade Director?\n\nPapa.\n\nWhy did you do that?\n\nHow are they treating you here?\n\nI went to the Ministry of Justice."
