        "text": "Prague Photo Spots\n\nPrague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is the ultimate in fairytale scenery and one of Europe‚Äôs most beautiful cities. Famous as the birthplace of Franz Kafka and for its iconic Astronomical Clock, the city boasts outstanding gothic and baroque architecture, delightful cafes, and spectacular viewpoints along the Vltava River. No matter where you go, Praha, as locals call it, offers countless photo opportunities, from major sightseeing spots like the Prague Castle complex to Instagrammable hidden gems like the dancing house and the John Lennon wall. When it comes to snapping your trip, you‚Äôll have plenty of material, and we‚Äôre here to sort it out for you. This travel guide doubles as a Prague photography guide with a list of the top 10 places to take photos in Prague. üá®üáø\n\nTLDR\n\nCharles Bridge: One of the most famous photography locations in the Czech Republic.\n\nOld Town: Also known as Star√© Mƒõsto, this district is made of cobblestone streets and replete with medieval buildings, churches, and squares.\n\nPrague Castle: The president‚Äôs seat and a treasure trove of historical and cultural relics.\n\nValdstejnska Zahrada Gardens: A hidden gem with unparalleled opportunities for great photos!\n\nPetrinske Sady: The perfect city gateway, a hillside park in the middle of Prague with pathways, gardens, and vantage points.\n\nMala Strana: A fairytale-like district of cobblestone streets hides excellent eateries and traditional pubs.\n\nTram station Pohorelec: A 14th-century area filled with picturesque buildings.\n\nHradcanske Namesti Square: The last spot on the Royal Route before Prague Castle ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a required stop when visiting Prague!\n\nLetensk√© sady: One of the largest green patches in Prague and the perfect place for a picnic.\n\nM√°nes≈Øv most: With a unique Czech Cubism style, this bridge is considered a piece of art.\n\n1. Charles Bridge\n\nPart of the so-called Royal Route and connecting the Old Town to Lesser Town sits Charles Bridge, one of the most famous photography locations in the Czech Republic. Built in the 15th century, this is the oldest bridge over the Vltava River. It is a medieval structure standing on 15 stone pillars and lined with intricate statues, many of which are still original.\n\nLook for the famous statue of St. John of Nepomuk and rub its nameplate. As legend has it, if this is your first time visiting Prague and you want to return, that‚Äôs what you should do. They also say rubbing the plaque will bring you luck. üçÄ\n\nAlong the bridge, you‚Äôll meet many musicians and artists entertaining visitors. However, if you prefer a calmer experience, try touring in the early morning or evening, when the place is a lot emptier.\n\nOn both sides of the bridge, you‚Äôll find the imposing Old Town bridge towers with pointed arch gates. Ascend to the top of the towers for a beautiful view and one of the best places to take photos in Prague. Try to do it at dusk; the golden hues of sunset make the panorama even more breathtaking.\n\nHere‚Äôs a curiosity: some people believe that the bridge builders added egg yolks to the mortar to strengthen the structure. Maybe it was a medieval engineering technique‚Ä¶? If this is true, we don‚Äôt know, but a rather fun anecdote, isn‚Äôt it? üòÑ\n\n2. Old Town\n\nPrague‚Äôs Old Town, also known as Star√© Mƒõsto, is the most impressive part of the city, a district made of cobblestone streets and replete with medieval buildings, churches, and squares.\n\nThe monumental Powder Tower is one of the original city gates, another gothic structure from the 15th century, named this way for being used to store gunpowder in the past. Take a deep breath, climb the 186 steps to the top of the tower and admire the most fantastic city views.\n\nAt the heart of Old Town is Old Town Square. That‚Äôs where you‚Äôll find the Astronomical Clock, Old Town Hall Tower, and Church of Our Lady Before T√Ωn.\n\nThe clock shows the relative positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. üåî üåè Oh, it also tells the time! Try seeing it during the full hour to catch ‚ÄúThe Walk of the Apostles,‚Äù when miniatures of 12 apostles move above the piece.\n\nThe church, with its spires and towers, was the inspiration for Disney‚Äôs Magic Kingdom Castle. See what we mean by saying this city is out of a fairytale? üè∞\n\nThe square is also the stage for one of Europe‚Äôs most beautiful Christmas markets. If you visit Prague during the holiday season, the best thing to do is grab a cup of mulled wine, take fabulous pictures, and forget all about the cold!\n\nWhile in Old Town, don‚Äôt miss the 13th-century Havel Market, the exuberant Klementinum Library, and the Jewish Quarter. We‚Äôve said it before, and we‚Äôll say it again: forget Google maps and just get lost in these magical alleyways ‚Äî that‚Äôs the best way to explore.\n\n3. Prague Castle\n\nSitting on top of a hill, Prague Castle is not a single building but a large complex of historical buildings, gardens, museums, and churches. In the past, it was the home of kings and royalty; today, it‚Äôs the president‚Äôs seat and a treasure trove of historical and cultural relics. ‚ú®\n\nThe site was listed the world‚Äôs largest castle complex by the Guinness World Records. It‚Äôll be hard to miss St. Vitus Cathedral during your visit. This religious piece is quite striking because of its architectural mix of Gothic, Baroque, and Renaissance styles. Tourists flock to the cathedral all year round to admire the famous stained glass windows. Another highlight inside the building is the altar of St. Wenceslas Chapel, encrusted with Bohemian gems and gold.\n\nAnother photo-worthy spot in the complex is Golden Lane, a street lined by quaint houses. Built in the 16th century for the castle‚Äôs guards, they were later inhabited by goldsmiths, hence the name. In the 1950s, these picturesque buildings were painted in bright colours, which made them lovely photo backgrounds. Don‚Äôt miss house number 22, where the sister of Franz Kafka lived. The writer used the residence as a refuge to write on a number of occasions. üñãÔ∏è\n\nNearby, the Royal Garden has manicured laws, stunning flower beds, and the charming Singing Fountain. The most impressive building facing it is Queen Anne‚Äôs Summer Palace. With its unique green roof and elaborate arcade, the palace is one reason Prague is such a photogenic city.\n\n4. Valdstejnska Zahrada Gardens\n\nDespite being one of the city‚Äôs most beautiful gardens and a prime place to take photos in Prague, you can still think of Valdstejnska Zahrada, or Wallenstein Garden, as a hidden gem in the Lesser Town. Almost nobody talks about it.\n\nThe garden is part of the Wallenstein Palace, a gracious baroque palace built in the 17th century. The palace‚Äôs most notable feature is Sala Terrena, a loggia with magnificent arches and frescoes that serves as a stage for several cultural and musical events during summer.\n\nWith a symmetrical design, stunning fountains, and magnificent sculptures, the garden offers unparalleled opportunities for great photos, and it‚Äôs also an ideal spot for a picnic. üßÄ\n\nThere are even some extra-fun idyllic touches! You‚Äôll get to see peacocks roaming the lawn, a koi fish pond, and even an artificial stalactite cave.\n\nThe park is only open during summer, from April to October, but it is free to enter, saving you a few czks. üëç\n\n5. Petrinske Sady\n\nAlso known as Petrin Hill, Petrinske Sady is the perfect city gateway, a hillside park in the middle of Prague with many pathways, gardens, and vantage points. Locals flock here during summer to lie on its lawns and admire the lush surroundings. üå≥\n\nFor the romantics, the Rose Garden is a must: a unique spot with several species and a delicate floral aroma in the air. Equally remarkable is the Seminary Garden, where several fruit trees create a mesmerizing display of colours. The garden also has stunning vistas of both Lesser Town and Old Town.\n\nThe big star of Petrin Hill, however, is the Petrin Lookout Tower. This former transmission tower from the 19th century takes inspiration from the Eiffel Tower. It is now an observation deck that offers a 360-degree view of the beautiful city of Prague. Undoubtedly, this is one of the best vantage points to marvel at the city‚Äôs hundreds of spires. It‚Äôs also fun to count them from up there ‚Äî just know that it might take a while! ‚è≥\n\nYou can reach the top of Petrin Hill by funicular or by hiking. Both are lovely scenic options. Every season brings a unique touch to the area. Autumn, for instance, is buoyant in colours; with snow, the park becomes a winter wonderland. ‚ùÑÔ∏è\n\n6. Mala Strana\n\nAcross the Vltava River, Mala Strana, also known as Lesser Town or Lesser Quarter, is another hillside areareplete with cultural activities, trendy boutiques, and hidden gems. Besides being home to the one and only Prague Castle, this fairytale-like district of cobblestone streets hides excellent eateries and traditional pubs and, of course, spectacular places to take photos in Prague.\n\nNotable artists have visited the area throughout history. Two of them are Bach and Mozart, who played concerts inside St. Nicholas Church. One of Prague‚Äôs most recognizable buildings, the church has an elaborate structure with a bell tower and a green dome. üîî\n\nSpeaking of musical celebrities, Mala Strana is also the site of something unique: the John Lennon wall. Once an ordinary wall, it became a mural for all kinds of tributes after his death in 1980. Fans from all over the world leave their mark there, reproducing Lennon‚Äôs iconic face and writing his lyrics and quotes on the wall.\n\nNear the Lennon wall is the Franz Kafka Museum. Since 2005, this institution has celebrated the life and work of one of the greatest writers of the 20th century. What better spot to get a copy of The Metamorphosis? üêû\n\nPhoto alert: while in Mala Strana, head to the river banks to see Prague‚Äôs most beautiful residents, the white swans that live in the river. These elegant creatures will add a magical touch to your photo shoot.\n\n7. Tram station Pohorelec\n\nTo get off the beaten track, jump on a tram and get off at the Pohorelec stop. You‚Äôll find an area from the 14th century filled with picturesque buildings. This suburb is near Prague Castle and a gateway to great attractions. One of them is the Strahov Monastery, a building that‚Äôs nearly 900 years old. Its lavishing baroque library has a ceiling covered in frescos and, beyond literary masterpieces, it contains several cabinets of curiosities. You can think of these delightful displays as museums in miniature and can spend hours just looking at the strange artifacts they exhibit.\n\nA stone‚Äôs throw away from the monastery sits a pilgrimage site called Loreto, with another baroque church and a cloister. It‚Äôs a great idea to explore Pohorelec and stroll its lovely streets before or after visiting the castle complex. üòâ\n\n8. Hradcanske Namesti Square\n\nAlso known as Hradƒçanska Square, Hradcanske Namesti Square is the last spot on the Royal Route before Prague Castle ‚Äî and it‚Äôs a required stop if you visit Prague.\n\nHistorical buildings that vary in style and colour line the square. The baroque Tuscan Palace is one of the most popular. Like Charles Bridge, the palace‚Äôs symmetric fa√ßade is decorated with several statues, except they sit on the roof between two towers. Another building worth checking out is the Schwarzenberg Palace. In Renaissance style, the fa√ßade displays elegant black-and-white patterns created through a process called sgraffito; the interior holds an extraordinary art collection. üñºÔ∏è\n\nAnother feature of this square is the ornamented gate that leads to the castle. In this spot, you can see the ceremonial changing of the guard every day at noon. Next to the entrance, there‚Äôs a wide-angle viewpoint with more vistas that are a feast for the eyes. üòç\n\n9. Letensk√© sady\n\nOverlooking the Vltava River, Letensk√© sady, also known as Letna Park, is one of the largest green patches in Prague. Locals flock here to enjoy weekends and holidays, play sports, have picnics on the lawn, and soak in the place‚Äôs serenity. üòå\n\nStroll through its lush pathways, all lined with plane trees, and admire the wide-angle views of the city ‚Äî they are fascinating in this park since you get to see the many stone bridges crossing the river.\n\nThe park‚Äôs beer garden offers more open views of the city. Nearby sits the stylish Hanavsk√Ω Pavilion, a remarkable Art Nouveau structure that is one of the best places to take photos in Prague.\n\nThe star of the park is the 23-meter-tall metronome that counts the hours. This massive kinetic sculpture symbolizes the struggle against Soviet control and the dawning of a new era, ever since it replaced a statue of Josef Stalin. The area next to it is full of family-friendly activities, with locals skating, cycling, and jogging. üö¥\n\nRegardless of time of year, if you want to end your day relaxing and watching a fantastic sunset, this is the place. Try staying a bit after dawn; the night city views from the park are also well worth it, and you can try a long exposure shot to capture the cars crossing the bridges and leaving their light trails behind.\n\nCapturing memories in Prague\n\nWhile that is already a long list of places to visit, that‚Äôs not everything ‚Äî Prague is like a box of surprises! By strolling its streets, you‚Äôll discover many more fantastic spots throughout the city.\n\nHere are a few more worth mentioning: the unusual Dancing House, a building designed to resemble a couple dancing, but not just any couple, specifically the dancing partners Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire üíÉ; the bohemian district of ≈Ωi≈ækov is home to the controversial ≈Ωi≈ækov Television Tower, a steel structure that rises above the city, contrasting with its traditional skyline; Wenceslas Square is a shopaholic paradise with countless trendy boutiques and is also where you‚Äôll find the grand National Museum.\n\nOne of our longtime Prague native customers has created an incredible guide for travellers who are interested in exploring the less-expected, modern sights of the city.
