A new film by one of the country’s leading documentary makers, Helena Třeštíková about the Czech interwar actress Lída Baarová, who was the mistress of Nazi propaganda chief Josef Goebbels, will hit the country’s cinemas on Thursday. Called Zkáza krásou, or Doomed Beauty, the documentary probes the life of one of the country’s biggest film stars, whose life was shaped by the dramatic events of the 20th century. A feature film biography about Baarová, by director Filip Renč and starring Táňa Pauhofová, will be shown in Czech cinemas in the spring.
