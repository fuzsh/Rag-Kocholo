        "text": "\"Geometrical Problems\"\n\nWashington copied these geometrical problems from the textbook, The Compleat Surveyor. Striking in their precision, Washington’s “Geometrical Problems” represent one set of exercises within a larger group of school papers that he produced as a teenager, between 1744 and 1748. These papers are the primary evidence for the scope and quality of Washington’s formal education, and document some of the earliest formative influences on him. Having been originally preserved by Washington himself, they also attest to the value he placed on their contents.\n\nWashington mastered 17 of the problems provided in the text, presumably ones chosen by his tutor. In 1747, within a year or two of completing the problems, Washington executed his first practice surveys, and in 1749 he secured the lucrative office of county surveyor in Culpeper County, Virginia. Even after years of experience in the field as a surveyor, Washington appears to have continued to draw on Leybourn’s text as a reference. The circa 1764 “List of Books at Mount Vernon” includes “Leybourn’s Surveying” with a notation indicating that it had been borrowed from his neighbor, George William Fairfax (1724-1787).\n\nTowards the end of his schooling, George Washington copied out 110 “Rules of Civility and Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation.” These rules were drawn from a popular English text, Youth’s Behaviour, or Decency in Conversation Amongst Men, which was itself an adaptation of a 1595 work written by French Jesuit priests. The rules instruct students to practice consideration and respect towards others by paying careful attention to body language, dress, and speech.\n\nRule 1\n\nEvery Action done in Company, ought to be with Some Sign of Respect, to those that are Present.\n\nRule 19\n\nLet your Countenance be pleasant but in Serious Matters Somewhat grave.\n\nRule 35\n\nLet your Discourse with Men of Business be Short and Comprehensive."
