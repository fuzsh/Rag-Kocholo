        "text": "This talk by Christopher Monroe gives a good overview of the state of the art in the Quantum Computing field. Below there are two paragraphs describing prospects for breaking encryption and the overview of current research. We can do parallel computing. With three qubits there are eight states and they have eight weightings here and […]\n\nA useful quantum computer needs to process a set of continuous parameters that is larger than the number of subatomic particles in the observable universe. At this point in a description of a possible future technology, a hardheaded engineer loses interest. In the physical world, continuous quantities (be they voltages or the parameters defining quantum-mechanical […]\n\nThree lectures explaining basic concepts and history of Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Computing. We are promised all-powerful quantum computers within the next 15 years or so. All these promises that we’ll have a universal quantum computer in 15 years reminded me of a story about Nasreddin who lived some 1000 years ago. Nasreddin Hodja: I […]\n\nRediscovered a talk by Ross Anderson dismissing quantum mechanics and hence quantum computing. His very first words are: I was invited here to provide a dissenting view. He is basically saying that quantum mechanics are not different from classical physics. That’s what Bohm/De Broglie pilot wave theory argues but it has been dismissed many times […]\n\nSo, I would like to see if there’s some other way out, and I want to emphasize, or bring the question here, because the discovery of computers and the thinking about computers has turned out to be extremely useful in many branches of human reasoning. For instance, we never really understood how lousy our understanding […]\n\nThere’s a good story about Nasreddin who lived some 1000 years ago. Nasreddin Hodja: I promised the Emir (King) of Bukhara that I will teach his donkey to speak like a human being, in 15 years time. He gave me lots of money for it. Friend: Are you crazy? You cannot do it. The Emir […]\n\nLecture notes from the talk Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists by Andrew Helwer at Microsoft This talk discards hand-wavy pop-science metaphors and answers a simple question: from a computer science perspective, how can a quantum computer outperform a classical computer? Attendees will learn the following: Representing computation with basic linear algebra (matrices and vectors) The […]\n\nFollowing are the lectures on quantum computing in increasing complexity order. The lectures give good overview of the science and technology as it works now. In the popular press, quantum computers are often presented not just as an exciting frontier of science and technology (which they are), but as magic devices that would work by […]\n\nTwo interesting and related talks, one on the physical limitations of computational power and the other on cryptography and computational puzzles presented to us by Nature herself. Quantum Computing and the Limits of the Efficiently Computable Breaking Codes and Finding Patterns Quantum Computing and the Limits of the Efficiently Computable Talk by Scott Aaronson, 2011 […]\n\nThese are the latest articles and videos I found most interesting. Quantum Technology & National Security Have We Missed Half of What the Neocortex Does? Allocentric Location as the Basis of Perception Quantum computing – Schrodinger’s cats can calculate faster How We Learn to Interpret Speech New dataset to help AI with video understanding Quantum […]"
