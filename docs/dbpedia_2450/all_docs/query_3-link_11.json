        "text": "This short piece is a long overdue follow up to one of my more popular LinkedIn articles. In January 2015 I wrote about Category Theory, a mathematical discipline that is so abstract that even other working mathematicians can find it somewhat intimidating. In that article I explained how, 70 yrs or so after the initial exposition of the theory by Saunders Mac Lane and his collaborator Samuel Eilenberg, Category Theory had slowly emerged as the bedrock upon which modern mathematics is based. In that article (here) I used the term “bedrock” very deliberately in order to contrast with the word “foundation”. Structures require foundations, but foundations in turn cannot be relied upon unless they rest on solid bedrock.\n\nThe divergence of work between a largely North American approach exploring categorical mappings that explored linkages between different parts of mathematics, and a European tradition led by the brilliance of Alexander Grothendieck who delved deeper than perhaps any mathematician since Gauss and Riemann into the core truths of mathematical structures, marked a lively and rich 1950's and 1960's for the then still newly minted area of mathematics. More than the almost mystical efficacy of categorical approaches to mathematicians such as Serre, Lawvere and Deligne, what really stood out then, and what, frankly, continues to captivate me on a personal basis now, is the all encompassing beauty of Category Theory. It is, to borrow from Bertrand Russell, an 'austere' beauty that seems to defies description.\n\n“Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty—a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show” Bertrand Russell\n\nAt its heart Category Theory shifts the traditional focus of mathematics from seeking and recognising patterns, to the startling realisation that what really matters are the similarities between different structures as represented by maps or morphisms. In some respects the migration of forms from, say, integers to topological spaces reveals more about the deepest mathematical truths than seeing and defining patterns in one or the other. Having been derived in large part from research related to algebra, geometry and topology, Category Theory has a far more natural approach as a foundational resource for the whole of mathematics than Set Theory, and the first three decades of its development are, not surprisingly, linked to algebraic geometry and topos theory - which leads me to Grothendieck.\n\nPerhaps the most brilliant of all mathematicians in the 20th century, Alexander Grothendieck created structures where none were thought to exist and in doing so pushed the boundaries of mathematical (and possibly even human) knowledge into areas that are still being appreciated 3 years after his death. To many, Grothendieck is the epitomy of a pure mathematician in the tradition of that ultimate purist, GH Hardy, and his explanation of what he found most compelling in his work is worth sharing (see quote below). Grothendieck's work is vast enough to occupy a very (very !!) large archive of books and articles, and the truth is that his approach to a Algebraic Geometry bought to the fore category theoretical methods that more thoroughly explored and understood deep truths that cross conventional boundaries. Grothendieck's unique personal story and his almost 4 decade retreat to solitude and early retirement from formal mathematics is part of his charisma. However the sheer bulk of his work, and the research that has yet to be properly carried out means that his real contribution to mathematics is likely only to become clear in the years ahead, despite the almost universal acknowledgement that he was the most important 20th century mathematician. The following link to the New York Times obituary is typical of the way that he is now seen and there are an increasing number of scientific historians who rank Grothendieck alongside Gauss, Riemann and Euler in historic terms.\n\n\"If there is one thing in mathematics that fascinates me more than anything else (and doubtless always has), it is neither \"number\" nor \"size\", but always form. And among the thousand-and-one faces whereby form chooses to reveal itself to us, the one that fascinates me more than any other and continues to fascinate me, is the structure hidden in mathematical things\" Grothendieck\n\nThere exists in almost all Universities a clear division between pure and applied mathematics. A friendly (and sometimes not so friendly) rivalry exists between both sides of the divide, with separate conferences, separate journals and in many cases even a whole separate language. Category Theory was seen as such an abstract area of research that even pure mathematicians started to refer to it as \"abstract nonsense\", and until the mid 1980's almost all category theorists occupied a place hidden somewhere up above the 'cloud level' in the highest reaches of the peaks that defined \"pure\" maths.\n\nAnd then something rather odd happened. The emerging academic discipline of computer science started to discover the effectiveness of categorical approaches to linking elements - or objects - from one set (or category) to another. It was not just that the simple maps composed through elegant diagrams worked well in building high level languages (although for anyone familiar with the effectivenss of Feynman diagrams in theoretical physics, the idea of maps representing formulae is not particularly odd), but the ability to manipulate instructions and create programmes by managing the relationship between seemingly different areas, that appealed most to computer scientists and a new generation of programmers let loose on increasingly powerful processors. In short, Category Theory allowed for higher and higher level language compilations. Programming relationships represented by maps (or arrows or, more formally, morphisms) between different objects within those areas and between those areas themselves provided clarity and delivered purpose, and lo and behold, category theory became an applied tradition whilst still seen within the mathematical community as highly abstract (and highly pure).\n\nBy the mid 1990's and then by the turn of the millenium, a whole world of computer programmers were learning basic category theory as part of their induction into functional programming. The best known product of these efforts is the Haskell language, but even in the past 7 or 8 yrs, workshops on category theory for computer programmers of all types have flourished and proliferated. It is almost as if there are two separate communities masquerading as one - mathematical category theory and computer programming category theory - and never the twain would meet. Or so it seemed, until now.\n\nIt would be wrong to suggest that the broadening appeal of category theory is based wholly on the expansion of the research teams beyond mathematics departments to computer scientists and programmers, and as noted elsewhere in this article, there are far fewer category theorists than other types of mathematicians, and certainly far far fewer than there are, for example, string theorists in theoretical physics.\n\nHowever, although small, there are some stand out talents in this new generation, including people that will, in my view, become known far beyond their respective groups in the years ahead. Amongst those on the mathematical side of the fence Tom Leinster and Emily Riehl stand out as exceptionally gifted (I have elsewhere stated my opinion that Riehl has the prospect to become one of the most important young mathematicians of her generation and here and here are links to two videos where she presents her research). Amongst the mathematicians, however, no one quites dominates the scene and is as respected and widely admired as John Baez who describes himself as a mathematical physicist and who's blog has become one of the most followed amongst all mathematical blogs. Baez's work stands out in particular for the irreverence with which he has approached widely disparate topics, and then shown that his lack of respect for established norms does not lead to any compromise in terms of intellectual depth and probity.\n\n\"I hope most mathematicians continue to fear and despise category theory, so I can continue to maintain a certain advantage over them\" John Baez\n\nOn the computer science side Bob Coecke and Bartosz Milewski stand out, although Coecke is as much a theoretical physicist as he is a computer scientist. I will write a little more about Coecke and his remarkable group at Oxford below, but it is interesting and a little amusing to note that he is seen by quantum computing people as a pure mathematician, by pure mathermaticans as a computer scientist, and by programmers as some exotic philosopher. Coecke is a product of the iconic group established by University of Oxford Computer Science Professor, Samson Abramsky although his academic lineage also includes a stint with Cambridge pure mathematician Martin Hyland.\n\nThe graph to the right (with credit for the information to Rob Seaton and his ever helpful blog) shows the number of times the phrase category theory occurs in books, and starts around 1950 and extends until just after 2010. The trajectory of the graph would show an even steeper rise in the 7 years since 2010 and although slightly outside the scope of this short article, an example of just how mainstream category theory is becoming from an \"applied\" point of view, even NIST in the USA is taking Category Theory on board with a variety of initiatives including sponsoring post doc positions that help evaluate Category Theory applications in interoperability standards across industries.\n\nI turn now to the main reason for penning this follow up to my 2015 effort, and bring to your attention the fascinating work being done by Coecke and his collaborators and broader group (that includes Aleks Kissinger, Niel De Baudrup and Dominic Horsman amongst others) on the creation of Diagrammatic Reasoning. Diagrammatic Reasoning hopes to advance research in quantum theory, and also, most interestingly (in my view) in quantum information theory and quantum computing by the use of schematics that are called diagrams and maps (or in circuit processes, 'strings'). The diagrams (and \"strings\") that I refer to here are as far from trivial, and are developed through a thoroughly category theoretical approach that in scope and ambition are comprable to Feynman diagrams that theoretical physicists are so used to. Coecke's pedigree in this area extends back to work done over a decade ago. He is a prolific researcher and some of his relatively early work on diagrammatic approaches to quantum theory remain important landmarks in this emerging discipline (here is a link to his arxiv index and here is a link to a 2009 paper that first bought him to my attention and that I still think is one of his best works). However it is his jointly authored work with Alex Kissinger that was published earlier this summer (\"Picturing Quantum Processes\") that marks a more serious advance in method and substance, and allied to the work on closely related areas that the Oxford University Computer Science department (and a few others) have continued to devote time and attention to,\n\nIf you are interesting in taking a deeper dive into this captivating area, then an adjunct to the book I mention above is the presentation by Aleks Kissinger here that is a gentle introduction to the rigour and the exansive scope of the methodology.\n\nThe main reason that I am excited by these developments is, of course, the possible links with Quantum Computing. Specifically, since it is not yet clear what the ultimate \"winner\" will be in terms of quantum hardware from the various different platforms that are currently being built, it is even less clear what the precise format of quantum computations will be that actually \"measure\" the outputs. These computational alternatives, ranging from simple circuit-like computation, to architectures where the final measurements or computations are reduced to observations (\"MBQC\") will have a major bearing on the ease and efficiency with which valuable applications will become useful in the real world. As we know, different platforms for quantum computation (superconductors, ion traps, topological qubits etc) turn out not to translate easily into each other, and even figuring out whether a translation exists, is a challenge. The main reason for this is that each format comes with a series of constraints (e.g. in circuits all quantum operations have to be unitaries while in MBQC they have to be measurements) and these simply cannot be matched onto each other.\n\nCoecke and his team propose to use their \"process\" and the ZX calculus to play the role of an intermediate (or compiler) for translating programs to architectures in much the same way that classical computers rely upon traditional compilers. It remains to be seen whether the ZX calculus and Diagrammatic Reasoning more broadly, can provide an efficient means to reduce the cost of implementing a quantum program on different platforms, but the fact that the challenge can even be articulated and explored is very exciting and I am optimistic that we will start to hear about some interesting results over the coming year to 18 months. The stakes, as we all know, are very high, and anything that can supplement and abet the overall advance in gaining efficiencies for early, smaller scale quantum computers is of great value. In this regard alone all credible efforts are worth backing in this critical stage of development.\n\nAnd finally - if you think you have caught the bug for category theory, then one of the more interesting websites that you can explore and that offers some good resource is \"The n category cafe\" a blog that covers a whole lot of ground and frequented by many of the people I have mentioned above.\n\nIlyas Khan, Cambridge Quantum Computing"
