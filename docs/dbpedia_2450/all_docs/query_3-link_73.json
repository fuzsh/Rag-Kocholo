        "text": "During your study at Oxford, you can share in the excitement of contributing to research in one or more of the many topics studied by Oxford mathematicians. The department’s research covers the entire spectrum of mathematics, with subject areas including:\n\nalgebra (primarily group theory and representation theory)\n\nnumber theory\n\nalgebraic geometry\n\ndifferential geometry\n\ntopology\n\ncomplex manifolds\n\nglobal analysis\n\npartial differential equations\n\nfunctional analysis\n\nstochastic analysis\n\ndynamical systems\n\nmathematical logic\n\noptimisation\n\ncombinatorial theory\n\nquantum theory\n\nstring theory\n\nrelativity\n\nmathematical biology and ecology\n\nmathematical modelling\n\nfluid and continuum mechanics\n\nmathematical and computational finance\n\nnumerical analysis\n\nhistory of mathematics\n\nmathematics applied to problems in earth sciences, materials science and finance\n\ndata science\n\nnetwork science.\n\nYou will be asked to outline your research interests when you apply by listing at least one but no more than three of the fields of research listed above on your application form. More information about the Research Groups in the Mathematical Institute can be found on the department's website. Full instructions for completing this section of the application form can be found in the How to apply section of this page.\n\nYou will be expected to acquire transferable skills as part of your training, which will require you to attend courses, lectures, workshops and colloquia. You will be expected to complete a minimum of 68 hours of broadening training during your studies, comprising the equivalent of 3 standard 16-hour lecture courses and attendance at relevant seminars and colloquia. You will have the opportunity to develop other valuable skills and to contribute to the teaching work of the department, both by marking students’ work and later by leading classes of around eight to twelve students.\n\nUndertaking the course is regarded as equivalent to working full-time hours and may also sometimes require some additional hours. The minimum period of registration for the DPhil is six terms but in practice you may need nine terms at least.\n\nSupervision\n\nYou will be invited to suggest a specific supervisor or supervisors in your application, and your preferences will be taken into account in allocating you a supervisor (which will be done before your arrival). The allocation of graduate supervision for this course is the responsibility of the Mathematical Institute and it is not always possible to accommodate the preferences of incoming graduate students to work with a particular member of staff. Under exceptional circumstances a supervisor may be found outside the Mathematical Institute.\n\nStudents are expected to meet with their supervisors at least four times per term. A more typical pattern is weekly, at least until you reach the stage of writing up your thesis.\n\nAssessment\n\nAll students will be initially admitted to the status of Probationer Research Student (PRS). Within four terms of admission as a PRS student you will be expected to apply for transfer of status from Probationer Research Student to DPhil status.\n\nA successful transfer of status from PRS to DPhil status will require satisfactory attendance and the submission of a thesis. Students who are successful at transfer will also be expected to apply for and gain confirmation of DPhil status within nine terms of admission, to verify that their work continues to be on track. Both milestones normally involve an interview with two assessors (other than your supervisor) and therefore provide important experience for the final oral examination.\n\nYou will be expected to teach at least one set of classes before transfer of status and a further two additional sets before confirmation of status. You will be expected to acquire transferable skills as part of your training and to undertake 68 hours of broadening courses outside your specialist area. This normally involves the submission of written work for three 16-hour lecture courses and attendance at workshops and colloquia.\n\nYou will be expected to submit a substantial original thesis which should not exceed 200 pages after three or, at most, four years from the date of admission. To be successfully awarded a Doctor of Philosophy in Mathematics you will need to defend your thesis orally (viva voce) in front of two appointed examiners.\n\nGraduate destinations\n\nThe department, working alongside the university’s Careers Service, supports graduate students as they move from the DPhil to the next stage of their career. Many graduate students stay in academia, by taking up a postdoctoral position, and many move into employment in a range of industries and sectors where the expertise and skills developed during the DPhil are highly valued.\n\nChanges to this course and your supervision\n\nThe University will seek to deliver this course in accordance with the description set out in this course page. However, there may be situations in which it is desirable or necessary for the University to make changes in course provision, either before or after registration. The safety of students, staff and visitors is paramount and major changes to delivery or services may have to be made in circumstances of a pandemic, epidemic or local health emergency. In addition, in certain circumstances, for example due to visa difficulties or because the health needs of students cannot be met, it may be necessary to make adjustments to course requirements for international study.\n\nWhere possible your academic supervisor will not change for the duration of your course. However, it may be necessary to assign a new academic supervisor during the course of study or before registration for reasons which might include illness, sabbatical leave, parental leave or change in employment.\n\nFor further information please see our page on changes to courses and the provisions of the student contract regarding changes to courses.\n\nEntry requirements for entry in 2024-25\n\nProven and potential academic excellence\n\nThe requirements described below are specific to this course and apply only in the year of entry that is shown.
