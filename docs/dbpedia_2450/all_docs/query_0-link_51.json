        "text": "In this blog post in Nature, we discuss our recent paper published in Nature Communications on “observing and braiding topological Majorana modes”. This was a joint work with Oles Shtanko and Nikhil Harle. Since we wrote a blog on this for Nature, here I only give a complementary background along with some social anecdotes, and new research updates.\n\nHistorically, problems in physical sciences were tackled in two complementary ways: controlled physical experiments, and the theoretical development of analytical (closed form) solutions. The former often informs the latter. This dual approach allowed us to develop a fundamental understanding of basic phenomena, e.g. through Newton’s law of gravity between masses and Maxwell’s equations of electrodynamics. For example, the gravitational two-body problem in classical physics is exactly solvable. However, beyond experimental study and analytical solutions afforded by very simple systems, we did not have reliable ways of studying physical systems without making limiting assumptions to get an approximate understanding. For example, the analytical solution of the gravitational three-body problem has remained an open problem for over 350 years! To make progress on body problem, one needs to assume that, say, one of the masses is much much more massive than others and that every other mass is sufficiently far from each other. Kind of like our solar system. In principle we can integrate the equations of motion of an -body problem and trace the trajectory of each particle for all time, but this is very painstaking and inefficient to do by hand.\n\nThe story is the same in the quantum realm, where interacting quantum systems with interesting properties involve many-particles. After all to call something a piece of quantum matter, we better have a lot of elementary particles. And as we discuss below, quantum many-body systems are even more complex to solve than the classical ones.\n\nThis all changed in the 20th century with the advent of computers and therefore increased the accuracy of our approximate calculations through a new approach: simulation. We now have yet another way of studying physical systems– by simulating them on a computer. We can quantify the errors that result from the simulation technique etc. (yes chaotic systems make the simulations harder because errors can exponentially ruin the end-result, but let’s not get digress). The utility of simulation extends well beyond physical systems into mathematics, economy, etc.\n\nQuantum systems are particularly challenging to study on standard computers as the number of parameters needed grows exponentially with the number of elementary constituents (see here). So as far as a serious exact study of many interacting quantum particles is concerned, for all practical purposes, we are back to the traditional method of experimentation with occasional analytical solutions for some very special classes of problems or making limiting assumptions to get some hand-wavy approximate predictions. However, quantum many-body systems can be efficiently studied on quantum computers. This was famously proposed by Richard Feynman in the 1980s (see here). A side note: looking at page 4 of Feynman’s paper (page 14 of the journal’s), Mr. Feynman surely must have been joking with his matrix multiplication rules!\n\nQuantum computers have only recently become large and reliable enough to allow the study of quantum matter. Simulation of quantum systems on quantum computers is often used to provide quantum demonstrations, in which the current generation of quantum computers are used to perform a task that informs or validates our understanding of quantum systems or simply does something useful. An example of a quantum many-body system that was in a dire need of a quantum demonstration was the existence of topological Majorana modes.\n\nMajorana modes are named after the Italian physicist Ettore Majorana who tragically went missing at the age of 32. Majorana considered the problem of a fermion which is its own antiparticle. Topological Majorana modes are exotic quantum many-body excitations that in some ways behave more fundamental than an electron. In fact they can act as a “half” electron. This is indeed weird as an electron is an elementary particle and a Majorana mode is an excitation that emerges from the collective behavior of many electrons! In addition to being exotic quantum states, Alexei Kitaev proposed the topological model of quantum computation in which topological Majorana modes are the fundamental building blocks much like the qubits are in the standard model of quantum computation.\n\nHowever, despite various efforts by many groups and especially those of Microsoft quantum research, the experimental observation of topological Majorana modes remained elusive. For years claims were made about their experimental realization. In 2018, after a controversial series of findings, the state of the art claims about experimental detection of Majoranas were invalidated with a key paper being retracted from the journal Nature. Other similar claims also proved to be controversial – in 2021, quanta magazine wrote that “no one has convincingly shown the existence of even a single (Majorana zero-mode) quasiparticle.” So despite vigorous effort, the search for these exotic quasiparticles has had a similar fate as their discoverer.\n\nGiven all this and the limitations to simulate them on classical computers, we asked ourselves: Can we establish their existence and verify their properties by simulating the topological Majorana modes on a quantum computer? This led to our paper mentioned at the top of this post and the accompanying blog post. In our paper, we consider a setting that is simpler than Majoranas found in solid state devices. We then, for the first time, demonstrate verifiable identification and braiding of topological Majorana modes, using superconducting quantum processors as our quantum simulators.\n\nWhen we were working on this paper I was still at IBM, and we knew that Google was also trying to do this. In a friendly competition we managed to get there a month before Google’s 128-author paper. Our paper also developed a new theory that we implemented on actual quantum hardware to reveal the correct braiding statistics of the topological Majorana modes. I have since moved to Google Quantum AI. This year at Google we demonstrated the braiding of the non-abelian anyons (see here), which goes beyond the (abelian) braiding of the Majorana fermions in our earlier paper. Ideas in our paper also lead to our most recent paper on the investigation of the many-body quantum phenomenon of many-body localization, which was just posted (see here).\n\nThis post discusses an algorithm that Yingkai Ouyang and I found in (the first part of) our paper. At its core, this algorithm is purely linear algebraic and may be of independent interest.\n\nThis algorithm takes as input any classical code and outputs the corresponding quantum code. So it builds a systematic bridge between the mature field of classical error correction and the rapidly evolving quantum error correction. Using it we found new codes outside the known formalisms of quantum error correction as depicted in this picture:\n\nThe theory of classical error correction is beautiful and highly mature see Ref.[1]. Previously ingenious quantum error correcting codes were discovered that (perhaps) took inspiration from the field of classical error correction (e.g. CSS), but as far as we can tell, never a systematic bridge between the classical and quantum error correction. We were driven by answering the following questions: What if you love a classical code because of its utility for your purposes (e.g., its properties or its naturalness for the hardware you are building), and wish to find the corresponding natural quantum code? There are celebrated classical codes and you might ask, what is the quantum version of them? How much of, say, Hamming’s celebrated [7,4,3] code can I make quantum?\n\nBasic notions of error correction\n\nA main challenge in quantum computing today is protection of quantum information. More specifically correcting the errors as they inevitably occur in the course of the computation. In classical computers (e.g., your laptop, super-computers, …) the computation is encoded in ‘bits’.\n\nThe state of a bit is either : or . Never in-between.\n\nAnd the errors are of bit-flip type, where a accidentally becomes a or a accidentally becomes . That is you wish to send or compute 0011 but instead 0010 is received or computed. The source of the errors may be thermal fluctuations, faulty gates, hardware limitations etc.\n\nThe field of error correction strives to detect errors in the course of the computation and (if possible) correct them. For example, in the classical case, one can use redundancy to correct errors: repeat the state of every bit an odd number of times, say three times and use this ‘encoding’ for the computation. If the rate of error is low enough then with high probability only one of the three bits might flip. And one can look at every -blocks of endcoded bits and take a majority vote to correct the potential error.\n\nQuantum information is encoded in quantum bits (qubits). The state of a qubit can be represented as (see this post for a more on quantum state):\n\nBy looking at the definition of the state of a qubit ( above) we see that there are two ways the qubit can be corrupted (an error to occur):\n\nBit-flip error: This is very much like the classical case where accidentally becomes or a accidentally becomes . For example, we wish to compute or send the state of 3 qubits but an error occurs and instead is received or computed.\n\nPhase-flip error: This only happens in quantum computing. Here a relative phase of and can accidentially change. For example, the following error can happen\n\n.\n\nBecause of the phase-errors the quantum errors are much more difficult to detect and correct; phase-flip errors make the situation much more complex. So much so, that despite the amazing recent experimental progress, we do not yet have even a single error corrected qubit (although this will likely change quite soon)! Such an error corrected qubit is called a logical qubit. The reason is that the overheards needed in the encoding of the quantum information is very high– With the current error correcting codes, we need at least thousands of fairly good qubits to build a single logical qubit. This in part motivates our work. Can we find better codes that need smaller overheard by leveraging the amazing progresses in classical error correction?\n\nBasic notions of a code (distance, rate):\n\nA classical code can be generally considered. See Ref [1] for an excellent introduction to classical codes (especially chapter 1). In practice one often considers ‘linear’ codes. A classical linear code is defined by three parameters and denoted by :\n\n: is the number of bits you use to encode a logical bit. In the example above we used for the repetition code to encode one logical qubit. We use a majority vote to correct errors.\n\n: is the distance. Distance between two strings is the number of positions in the strings that they differ (distance between and is three. But the distance between and is one. The distance of a code is the minimum distance between all pairs of stings in it.\n\n: is the number of encoded bits (i.e., logical bits). There are bits encoded in bit codewords (in the repetition code it was one). The size of the code is the number of strings (called codewords) in it and equals (over binary field).\n\n(Classical linear code ): is formally a linear subspace in the space of binary strings in which -bit strings are encoded in bits and every pair of strings have a Hamming distance (number of positions that they disagree) of at least .\n\n(Quantum linear code ): Denoted by is the generalization of the above, where one uses qubits for encoding. The code then is a (linear) subspace of the Hilbert space.\n\nThe idea of error correction is that one encodes a bit (qubit), sometimes called a physical bit (qubit), into a logical bit (qubit). In the quantum setting one defines a (cleverly designed) logical qubit out of many physical qubits. The quantum code will clearly be a subspace of the Hilbert space of the many physical qubits consumed.\n\nI was going to give an intro to the basics of error correction but realized there are excellent other resources for this. For example, you can see this talk by Peter Shor (the discoverer of quantum error correction):\n\nBridging classical to quantum error correction\n\nNow to our results (first part of this paper)! It bridges classical and quantum by taking as input any classical error correcting code and outputting the corresponding quantum code. A fun finding was that the classical Hamming’s [7,4,3] code uniquely corresponds to Steane’s qubit quantum code. We use this algorithm to construct explicit linear distance (best possible scaling) codes with constant rates (best possible scaling). So how does it work?\n\nSuppose is your favorite classical code with desirable properties. We first focus on building a single logical qubit, i.e., and .\n\nThe codewords in are in general some strings shown in yellow circles below. These could be binary strings or more generally q-ary strings. Suppose the favorite classical codes has a distance . Then every pair of strings (shown in yellow circles) have a hamming distance of at least .\n\nBut how does the algorithm identify and , and find the coefficients that go into the superposition? Any error is mathematically an operator that acts on the qubit(s) to alter the state away from its ideal. Any such error can be written in the basis of Pauli matrices (and identity), which form a spanning set. Let denote a (Pauli) error that corrupts the state. We say a Pauli error has weight if it is a tensor product of Paulis on qubits– it corrupts qubits.\n\nA nifty fact is that the necessary and sufficient conditions for information recovery operation in quantum error correction is for the logical qubits to satisfy the so called Knill-Laflamme conditions: , where in our qubit construction above, denotes any error that can be corrected, and is the kronecker delta. We unpack this condition into the following form, which is a set of two conditions:\n\n(1) Orthogonality: .\n\n(2) Non-deformation condition: .\n\nNow if the distance of the underlying code is then condition (1) is satisfied for any Pauli error of weight . Why? Because any product state in the superposition of has a distance from any other product state in the superposition of , hence one would need to flip at least qubits to have a non-zero overlap between the logical codewords. Similarly, if the error is of phase flip type still the underlying distance of the classical code would require at least flips. So the orthogonality condition (trivially) holds for Pauli errors of weight .\n\nBut how about the deformation condition? Here it is important that indeed is equal to as the equation says. Note that if the only type of error I have are non-trivial bit-flips (at least one) then again as long as their weight is at most this condition is satisfied, and actually each expectation value is zero!\n\nRemark: So the crux of the matter is to satisfy the non-deformation condition for phase-flip errors.\n\nPhase-flip errors correspond to that are diagonal, because they are modeled by Pauli-Z matrices. You should have known that at the end phase-flip errors would be the nemesis we would have to face in the quantum land! So what do we do? We will use the best and most versatile weapon of any applied mathematician–linear algebra!\n\nLet us first construct a matrix we shall call as follows: label its columns by all of the classical codewords in , i.e., the strings shown in yellow. We can assign to each classical codeword a product state in the quantum realm, e.g., the classical codeword corresponds to the product state in the computational basis etc. If the size of the classical code is then the matrix has columns. Ok, how do we label its rows?\n\nWe label the rows systematically by the Pauli-Z errors and organize them by their weight. So the first row corresponds to the Pauli errors of weight zero, i.e., no error where instead of we have the identity. This clearly yields a row of all ones (see the matrix below). The next rows correspond to single-qubit Pauli-Z error on each of the qubits respectively. The following rows correspond to Pauli-Z errors on two distinct qubits, etc.\n\nIn the more general case where we work over not just binaries but rather q-aries, Pauli-Z errors will in general be complex-valued matrices yet still diagonal. In this case, to keep real, each row in the above construction will become two rows one for the real part and one for the imaginary part shown:\n\nSo how many rows will it have? As we’ll see, this number will be dictated by how many rows we can insert and still be able to solve , which for a full-rank would mean rows in total. This will in turn define the maximum weight of the Pauli-Z errors we can allow; i.e., defines the so-called -distance of the code (absent in the classical world). In the diagram above denotes the hamming volume of a ball of radius over q-ary codes, where denotes the Z-distance of the code. The Hamming volume comes about because we deal with rows.\n\nHow does this matrix help us find and , as well as, the coefficients and to build a single logical qubit?!\n\nAnswer: We solve the linear system ! A solution always exists as long as the number of rows is less than . Moreover the solution can be taken to be a real vector (of length ) as is real. Ok so we can solve it and get the solution :\n\nWe can write the non-deformation condition as\n\nwhich using the notation business for logical qubits in the diagram above that depicts the classical code (with the blue ellipse in it) would write\n\nHow does this help? Since the first row of is all ones, we are guaranteed that is balanced in the sense that the sum of its negative entries is equal to the sum of its positive entries.\n\nThe solution can be written as where is equal to the positive part of and zero otherwise. Further, is equal to absolute value of the negative part of . Indeed it was crucial that we defined with a minus sign. For example would result in and . They have the same norm .\n\nBy the way, do you recall that if is a matrix and is the th standard basis (i.e., a column vector of all zeros except in the j-th position where it is 1), then is equal to the th column of ? Sure you do! Since the th position of selects out column of the matrix , the nonzero entries of will define a subset of classical codewords that we call . Similarly the nonzero entries of will define the set of codewords that we call . It should be clear that these two sets are disjoint for and cannot simultaneously have a non-zero entry at the same position (see the previous diagram). So we identified and in our quest (see big blue ellipse-diagram above).\n\nSo how do we identify the coefficients of the superposition? Well, just write\n\nThe normalization works out because the solution is balanced. Following the non-zero pattern of and we can write these logical qubits in the desired form\n\nwhere the set of is equal to the set of nonzero , and the set of is equal to the set of nonzero .\n\nSo we managed to construct a logical qubit from whatever underlying classical code as long as it has enough columns to give us a non-trivial code. For example, the repetition code won’t do as it will have only 2 columns. In order to correct a non-trivial phase-flip we need more than two rows. However, there are many classical codes with many codewords (sometimes exponentially many in ). We used these to build ‘good’ quantum codes that have linear distance and constant rate. We also wrote down some short explicit codes starting from short classical codes to reify the very first diagram above. For example, we found an advantage compared to the best previously known, for constant excitation codes. We could also construct non-linear codes or codes not supported on product states.\n\nWhat next?\n\nOur paper does a lot more than the above algorithm. In particular we address:\n\nNote that any solution in the kernel allows us to build a single logical qubit. What if there are more solutions in the kernel as can often be the case? It is non-trivial but one can use the kernel structure and linear programming to build many logical states.\n\nWhat if we want to build many logical states even when there is not enough room in the kernel (too little number of columns or too many rows)? Then we can use Approximate Error Correction Criterion to do it, in which the Knill-Laflamme condition is only approximately satisfied.\n\nCan one have “good” codes in the ground space of local Hamiltonians? This is motivated by problems related to QLDPC codes and physically realistic codes. In the second part of the paper we construct a new local quantum spin-chain whose ground space we completely and analytically characterize, and prove contains excellent quantum codes.\n\nSome useful references:\n\n[1] MacWilliams and Sloane, “The theory of [classical] error-correcting codes” (Chapter 1). For classical error-correction.\n\n[2] Nielsen and Chuang, “Quantum Computation and Quantum Information”. For quantum error-correction.\n\nis the classical code with distance that is passed as an input to our algorithm. By definition, the yellow circles being the codewords of the classical algorithm, have distance . The algorithm outputs: two disjoint subsets depicted as and . These identify the set of product states that go into defining the logical qubits and respectively. the coefficients and which are the coefficients in the superposition that define the logical qubits and respectively .\n\nWith Marius Lemm and Radu Andrei we just posted our paper “The spin-one Motzkin chain is gapped for any area weight t<1” that proves that the -deformed Motzkin spin-one chain is uniformly gapped in the thermodynamic limit for and spin . In a future post I might blog about the details of these set of exactly solvable models that we called s-colored Motzkin quantum spin-chain (see Ref [1,2] at the bottom of this post). But the goal of this post is to give a high level overview and summarize what we know about the Motzkin spin-chain ten years after we found them. Let me set some basic notation:\n\nNotation below:\n\n: number of spins in the spin chain\n\n: Entanglement entropy about a cut in the middle\n\n: Energy gap, which is the positive difference of the smallest two distinct eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian\n\n: The deformation of the model introduced in Ref [4]. The original Motzkin spin-chain corresponds to\n\nExactly solvable models and spin chains date back to at least Heisenberg’s model of magnetism. Quantum spin chains have other exotic properties such as entanglement in their many-body states. Bulk of matter often is in its lowest energy state (i.e., the ground state) so physicists and chemists care most about the ground state properties of quantum matter at equilibrium. Naturally the energy gap to the first state above the ground state is significant as it quantifies the excitations needed to transition the system out of its ground state to a different state with potentially different physical properties. So the question of how large the energy gap of a certain model is, is one of the central questions to be answered for that model. The issue however is that proving the gap is often quite challenging. For some well-known models the proof of the gap remains open after decades of effort (e.g., model Hamiltonian for fractional quantum hall state). The gap of any quantum system falls into one of these two important broad classes:\n\nGapped : The model is gapped if as the size of the system tends to infinity (the so called thermodynamic limit), the energy different between the smallest two eigenvalues of its Hamiltonian is greater than a constant independent of the size. Mathematically, for some constant .\n\nGapless : The model is gapless if as the size of the system tends to infinity (the so called thermodynamic limit), the energy different between the smallest two eigenvalues of its Hamiltonian tends to zero. Mathematically, .\n\nIn the latter case how the gap tends to zero is significant and can directly quantify the critical exponents which capture the behavior near phase transitions. More about this another time.\n\nMoreover, gapless-ness is a necessary condition for existence of quantum phase transitions. Whereas, being in a gapped phase may protect the ground state properties against perturbations (see discussion on topological order).\n\nOne-dimensional (1D) systems are in a way more quantum than higher dimensional systems. Nevertheless there is a belief that 1D systems are easier to classically simulate because of DMRG and MPS and their cousins and generalizations. When I was a graduate student I wanted to better understand this tension. We know for fact that in 1D when the system is gapped, the so call area-law holds and classical simulation is efficient (can be performed in polynomial time). This was first proved in a seminal work by Matt Hastings who showed that the entanglement entropy of 1D gapped systems is a constant (see this paper). Then based on intuition rooted in critical systems in 1+1 dimension which by and large were assumed to be describable by relativistic conformal field theories, people thought that for ‘physical’ matter the entanglement entropy can at most be . But what is ‘physical’? It is believed that the following three criteria are sufficient for physicality of a model (I will likely blog about the notion of physical in a future post as it continues to be controversial):\n\nHamiltonian is geometrically local: Interactions involve a constant number of consecutive spins\n\nGround state is unique: No finite size degeneracies\n\nTranslation invariance: The interactions are the same among the consecutive spins regardless of where in the chain you look\n\nWhat we contributed is that under this physicality conditions, the belief that is the maximum possible for gapless systems is false! To do so, we proposed a new class of quantum spin chains which we called Motzkin chains. These ended up becoming interesting to various communities and beyond the original purpose (e.g, condensed matter physicists, high energy physics, mathematical physicists, and quantum information folks). We proved that its ground state is exponentially more entangled that previously believed possible, and proved that the gap closes polynomially. I won’t describe the details of the model in this post but rather refer you to one of my talks. See for example this talk I gave at QuICS University of Maryland :\n\nMotzkin spin chain was first introduced in Ref [1] and [2] below. The origin of the name is due to the combinatorial nature of the ground state of the model being a uniform superposition of Motzkin walks:\n\nThe model is an integer spin- model where is also known as the ‘color’ of the Motzkin walks. For example the spin states can be put in one-to-one correspondence with ‘steps’ in a lattice walk:\n\nThen any spin configuration on the chain makes a walk. A Motzkin walk is one that starts at zero height, ends at zero height and never becomes negative. For example this is a Motzkin walk for the spin-1 case:\n\nThis is an example of an s-colored Motzkin walk, where :\n\nIn addition to the s-coloring generalization of the spin-1 Motzkin chain, there have been two other remarkable generalizations:\n\nFredkin spin chain which is a half-integer version of our work by Vladimir Korepin and Olof Salberger.\n\ndeformation of the Motzkin walk where the walks in the superposition are weighted by , where is the area of the m-th Motzkin walk in the superposition above. Ref[4] introduced the deformation of the Motzkin spin chain. This was introduced by Zhang, Ahmadain, and Klich [4].\n\nEnergy Gap vs. spin and\n\nThe proof of the gap in each case took a different set of techniques:\n\nin Ref. [1] : For Lower-bound we used the projection lemma, canonical path technique to bound the mixing time of the induced Markov chain, integer programming and fractional matching.\n\nin Ref. [2] : Generalization of the above for the Lower-bound. For the upper-bound we used Brownian excursions, universality of brownian motion.\n\nin Ref. [5] we used Cheeger’s inequality.\n\nin Ref. [6] we used the finite size criterion and its extensions.\n\nYet another related problem is the Fredkin spin chain which extends Motzkin to half-integer spin chains (proposed by Vladimir Korepin and Olof Salberger) [7]. The gap of this model was ultimately proved in this paper, in which I had to use yet a new technique [8]. In addition to the new combinatorial structure of the ground state, I had to use the comparison lemma in Markov chains [8].\n\nEntanglement Entropy vs. spin and\n\nThe techniques for the calculation of entanglement entropy were combinatorial, asymptotic analysis (e.g., 2-d steepest descent), and basic notions of quantum information theory.\n\nA lot more is known about the original spin-1 Motzkin spin-chain, i.e., where . The following were worked out and summarized on page 2 of this paper (Ref [3] below):\n\nOne-point functions in the ground state: , ,\n\nTwo-point spin-correlation functions in the ground state: where\n\nSchmidt rank about arbitrary cuts\n\nBipartite von Neumann and Rényi entanglement entropies about an arbitrary cut on the chain\n\nvon Neumann and Rényi entanglement (tripartite) entropies of a consecutive set of spins\n\nSpin representation of the Hamiltonian and its U(1) symmetry\n\nAlternative derivation based on Brownian excursions and universality of Brownian motion\n\nOpen Problems\n\nThere are quite a few related open problems in addition to the conjectures in the table above.

A map is ergodic if and only if for all measurable sets , for all implies or\n\nSo how are the math and physics definitions related?\n\nBecause of my recent paper with Jeff Schenker and more recent work with Oles Shtanko on random circuits, I have been thinking about the relationship between the two. My goal in this post is to bridge the rigorous mathematical definition to physics by using two examples: (1) The familiar (classical) Boltzmann gas (2) Ergodic quantum channels from our paper (see this post).\n\nLet the set of all possible microstates be denoted by , where if the microstates are constrained to a sub-manifold because of a constrained (such as energy conservation) we take the sub-manifold as the phase space and denote it by .\n\nFor example, a classical system of point-like particle have a phase space that is dimensional, because the state is fully specified by where each particle is and how it is moving. More precisely, coordinate (3 per particle) and velocities (more precisely momenta because we want to take into account the mass of each particle). Once these parameters are specified at a given time, then the state of the system can be fully and, in principle, deterministically specified at any other time by integrating Newton’s twice. The that appears on the LHS is entirely determined by the experiment (i.e., physics); the right hand size is math; the equality bridges the math to the physics. Now a point in the phase space determines the state of the system and it evolves in time based on the microscopic laws of interaction among the constituents.\n\nLet us be the state at some time, i.e., the set of coordinates in the phase space. We denote by the map that evolves the point in the phase space for unit of time. Namely it maps to . Since the state fully specifies the system, the value of any observable at the given time is a function of the state. Let a macroscopic observable (e.g., energy) be denoted by the function since only real quantities can be measured. For thermodynamic systems the details of the dynamics (collisions of particles) happen on time-scales that are much smaller than those for macroscopic observables (e.g., sticking a thermostat in a fluid to measure temperature, or measuring pressure by observing how a shaft moves in response to the expansion of the gas).\n\nSome History and a myth\n\nThermodynamics has its roots in chemistry and is the study of macroscopic properties of matter (esp. developed for weakly interacting systems such as gases and liquids). These properties are relationship between measurable quantities such as pressure, volume and temperature of matter. Ludwig Boltzmann believed that matter was made up of tiny corpuscular things that we now call atoms and molecules. He set to derive thermodynamics from the kinematics of these many tiny things zipping around in the container. He succeeded but faced a lot of skepticism because many (e.g., Mach) did not believe matter was made up of atoms and molecules. They believed in the continuum and disbelieved that the macroscopic properties could have a kinetic basis- they thought a piece of wood is wood regardless of how may times you halve it, and that radiation was indefinitely continuous. Due to his struggles and (most likely) bipolar disorder, Boltzmann took his own life a couple of years before the atomistic hypothesis was experimentally verified.\n\nNow Boltzmann coined the term ergodic, which is closer to the physics definition above, to work his statistical theory of thermodynamics. In 1930s, John von Neumann and G.B. Birkhoff brought ergodicity into mathematics with their celebrated ergodic theorems.\n\nThere is a myth in mathematics that “Any system approaches an equilibrium state” and that this is the content of the zeroth law of thermodynamics. (see Reed and Simon Vol 1, Chpt. 2, section 5).\n\nZeroth law applies to thermodynamic systems, in which there is a thermodynamic equilibrium. At equilibrium the macrostate is time-invariant with overwhelming probability because the macroscopic observables (e.g., energy, temperature, etc.) have sharp mean values with small fluctuations. Thermodynamic equilibrium is an abstraction that well-approximates systems with a large (say Avogadro) number of constituents that interact weakly and locally. In particular, you can derive thermodynamics from Boltzmann’s equation, and the collision terms that appear on the right-hand side of his equation assume 2-body collisions.\n\nThese fail for systems with long range-interactions in which constituents interact via coulomb and gravitational forces. Mathematically if the central force between the particles is derived from a potential of the form with , where is the spatial dimension. In particular, if one defines a specific heat for a gravitational system (say a galaxy), then one finds that it is negative– Namely, “temperature” decreases if you pump energy into the system (!). For example an isolated gravitational system involving many constituents would expand by storing energy into the potential energy; consequently the particles move slower. If we define temperature by the mean kinetic energy then we have to say that the gravitational system has cooled down.\n\nMoreover, such gravitational systems evolve with time into states that are far from uniform and in no way look time invariant. For example, if the total energy and angular momentum are small enough, a gigantic gravitational dust clumps to form planets and stars. This is the opposite of what you expect for systems reaching equilibrium where the macrostate tends toward more boring and uniform states.\n\nStatistical theory of self-gravitating systems and their generalization (e.g., plasma) is quite different and is a subject I hope to return to in the future. There indeed are physical systems that are ‘non-ergodic’ to which our theory does not apply.\n\nIn the quantum setting there are examples of systems that are non-ergodic and the system forms partial subsystem equilibration and fails to reach global thermal equilibrium for really long times. Interesting enough P.W. Anderson in his original famous 1958 ‘localization paper‘ alluded to these. However, people were mainly fascinated by his result on disorder driven localization of electrons on a lattice, and it took till early 2000’s for people to pick up the subject, which now referred to as ‘Many-Body Localization‘.\n\nBridging the Math and Physics\n\nClassical Gas\n\nFor a classical gas the two aforementioned conditions of (1) Map is probability preserving and (2) The shift invariant events have probability one or zero are satisfied as follows. The maps is probability preserving is the content of Liouville’s theorem, which shows that the evolution in phase space is volume preserving; the phase space distribution is a constant in time for the system points in phase space under the evolution governed by the (weak) interaction of the constituents. The second condition of shift invariant events having zero or full measure is the mathematical statement for the fact that the number of microstates corresponding to a given thermodynamical macrostate (with say a fixed Volume and Energy) are just so overwhelmingly more than the set of microstates that do not describe the thermodynamical macrostate. The canonical example of the latter is that all the gas molecules just so happening to occupy a small corner of the room at a given moment. This is permissible but is just so so so very very very unlikely (i.e., measure zero event!).\n\nAll of this was understood by Boltzmann so let us take a look at a more modern example in a quantum setting.\n\nQuantum Channels\n\nQuantum channels are defined over the space of all completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP) maps, which as you can imagine, has nothing to do with a classical gas. One can directly define a sequence of channels that satisfy the conditions in the definition of what it means to be ergodic (see above). Or you can take a more pragmatic approach and find an ergodic system you love which someone worked hard to prove is ergodic (e.g., like the gas or billiard balls) and port over the ergodic properties to the space of quantum channels. How does this work?\n\nTake a probability space on which your favorite ergodic process is defined:\n\nThen map the trajectory of the underlying ergodic system onto the space of interest (here quantum channels):\n\nNow looking at the Proposition above we see that the map is ergodic– Its pre-image by construction is an ergodic map which indeed satisfies the two ergodic conditions mentioned above. See this short video for the description (a talk I gave in Taiwan at IID conference after mid-night my time).\n\nIn this blog I want to discuss the bare minimum of the differences between classical and quantum formulations of a ‘physical state’ especially to the non-specialists. It will also serve as a useful post to cite in the future when I talk about a “state” or a qubit.\n\nThis post might evolve if in the future posts other features of “states” not currently discussed are needed.\n\nPhysics is about predicting the state of a system (a particle or many particles) at an arbitrary time, given an initial state, and the laws of interactions the constituents are subjected to. These laws of interaction and therefore the evolution can be strongly influenced by symmetries.\n\nClassical Physics: is the physics we humans can directly experience such as mechanics and electromagnetism. Suppose one has particles with arbitrary laws of interactions. One can think of celestial bodies. The state of the system at a given time is fully specified by parameters, of which are the coordinates of each particle and the remaining are the components of the velocity of each particle. One can express the latter in terms of momenta to include the mass in the description of the state. Therefore the dimension of the “phase space” (the space of all possible states), in which the state of the classical particles resides grows additively with the number of particles. And the state of the particles at any given time is a point in this dimensional real space.\n\nNow, empirical physics (experimental measurements) give us the laws of interaction. For example, if I pull the two charged particle by so much then the force is this much, and it only depends on the distance between the two charges. This, in principle, is enough to ‘solve’ the many-body system by integrating Newton’s equation of motion, which for any one of the particles writes:\n\nThe left hand side is math and right hand side is physics (i.e., needs the experiment). Moreover, the right hand side in general is a function of time and space (e.g., the force field of a moving comet). Since we have the aforementioned parameters specified at a given time, we can integrate Newton’s equation twice, and in principle, write down . This enables us to specify the state at an arbitrary time (future or past).\n\nBits: Particularly relevant for computation are classical objects called bits. Each bit has two definite states conventionally denoted by and . Information can be encoded in binary into the state of many bits. A bit is the simplest classical object with only two states. The state of bits is specified by binary parameters. Together the state of bits encodes an bit string in with the total number of states being .\n\nAt the turn of the last century the experiments on subatomic particles showed large deviations from Newton’s equation. After some initial attempts to shake and bake the classical laws to fit the observed data, we gave up and found that it is best to formulate the physics of the very small, very differently! This was the birth of quantum mechanics.\n\nQuantum Physics: Suppose one has tiny particles for which classical laws are empirically seen to be inadequate. One can think of electrons on a lattice each with a ‘spin’ that can be either up or down. The state of one electron is a vector , and the state of electrons is a vector in the -fold tensor product space of the constituents . The tensor product structure result in a multiplicative growth of the dimension of the vector representing the state.\n\nThe quantum state being so different allows for new possibilities that are entirely absent in classical physics. The best example of this is that in quantum physics one can have entangled states (see the interlude in this post)\n\nThe so called (pure) state of the system is a gigantic vector in the Hilbert space. It’s components are basis-dependent like every other vector and the absolute value squared of each component quantifies the probability of observing the system in that state (this is Born’s rule). Note that calculating probabilities is the best we can do and the determinism of classical physics is no longer. For example, we can’t write down an explicit . We can only write down what is the probability of having a particular value.\n\nThe transformation of the state through time is affected by unitary operations. This makes sense because in the simplest case we want to preserve the norm of the vector for the probabilities to add up to one. In symbols the state at time , denoted by is related to the initial state by\n\nNote that the unitary also needs to grow exponentially with the number of particles to be able to act on the state. In practice could result from the action of a quantum circuit, or it could result from the time evolution generated by a Hamiltonian where and mathematically models the interaction that changes the state. The quantum circuit, by the virtue of being a physical system, can also be expressed in terms of an underlying Hamiltonian. But we usually abstract that away and simply write down the evolution of the state of the qubits at the circuit level. Speaking of which…\n\nQubits: Quantum information is encoded in quantum bits (qubits). The state of a qubit is a two-dimensional vector (in a Hilbert space) denoted by . In the so called computational basis the state writes:\n\nwhere and , such that . Each time we measure a qubit we get either or and never something in-between just like the classical bit; however we obtain with probability and we obtain with probability .\n\nWhat amazes me is the stark dissimilarity between the classical and quantum state formulations. By the correspondence principle one expects that the behavior of a quantum system with large number of particle (quantum numbers) would reduce to classical. Take as an example the many atoms making up a (manifestly classical) tennis ball. However it is by no means obvious how the gigantic Hilbert space of many atoms transforms into a classical phase space (of a tennis ball). Is there a scaling law? Because of existence of macroscopic quantum phases such as Bose-Einstein condensate or high-temperature superconductivity, it is not always the case that as one increases the number of particles one obtains classical behavior. So how exactly does the correspondence principle work? These are interesting questions that I don’t believe are fully resolved. I hope to return back to in a future post."
