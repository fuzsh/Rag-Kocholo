We carry out internationally recognized research, we offer internationally recognized graduate and undergraduate programs, and we reach out to the Tucson community and beyond to increase understanding and appreciation of the mathematical sciences.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nWelcome to the Department of Mathematics!\n\nIn the beginning there was mathematics; it has been with us ever since. Math plays a fundamental role in numerous aspects of our daily lives, as well as in broader societal and scientific contexts. Problems always require solutions and that's where math comes in. As a department, it is our goal to create, communicate, and apply mathematics of the highest caliber. UArizona Mathematics is dedicated to creating and maintaining high quality, expansive programs that allow us to give back to not only the mathematics community, but the quality of life within the university, Tucson community, and beyond.\n\nWhy Mathematics?\n\nSpecial topics courses are always changing. From Homological Algebra to Stochastic Control and Learning, if there is enough demand for a specific class, the course will be properly scheduled. See the Special Topics Course Archive for an idea of what has been taught in the past!"
