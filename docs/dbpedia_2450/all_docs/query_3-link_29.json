Visit Our Math Page, where youâll find the best math colleges and universities, career information, interviews with top mathematicians, influential scholars in the field of mathematics, great books, a history of the discipline, online math degrees, and more.\n\nIf you already have a bachelorâs degree in mathematics and are wondering if pursuing an advanced degree in mathematics will help to advance your career, check out what you can do with a masterâs degree in mathematics.\n\nDid you know that a degree in mathematics is a future-proof degree that can qualify you for an extremely wide range of jobs in a variety of high-growth industries? This degree can put you in a strong position to take on new roles necessitated by the rise in machine learning and AI-based technology.\n\nEarly Greek thinkers extended the Egyptian and Sumerian systems to the mathematics of shapes and places, with Euclidâs geometry. The Scientific Revolution brought us systems for describing rates of change-the calculus, developed by Enlightenment geniuses like Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibnitz. Today, we have string theory, knot theory, and the abstract analysis of multi-dimensional shapes that would seem bizarre to the ancients (and to non-mathematicians today).\n\nMathematics has continually expanded into more and more powerful and abstract areas of study. Professional mathematicians understandably specialize, and only a few truly great mathematicians can honestly be said to understand most of the field. Yet, in the end, mathematics remains counting. The study of numbers (and numerical treatments of structures, shapes, and changes) is one of the most powerful fields of study-one of the central discoveries of all of humankind-that has made possible modern science and technology, from abstract physics to the blueprints for an iPhone or automobile. Math runs the world. And in this list, weâll get introduced to the most influential-and brilliant-mathematicians in our modern world.\n\nIn what follows, we look at influential mathematicians over the last decade. Based on our ranking methodology, these individuals have significantly impacted the academic discipline of mathematics within 2010-2020. Influence can be produced in a variety of ways. Some have had revolutionary ideas, some may have climbed by popularity, but all are academicians primarily working in mathematics. Read more about our methodology.\n\nNote: This isnât simply a list of the most influential mathematicians alive today. Here we are focused on the number of citations and web presence of scholars in the last 10 years. There are other highly influential scholars who simply havenât been cited and talked about as much in the last 10 years, whereas some new faces have been making a splash in the news, speaking events, and publishing, publishing, publishing. Our AI is time sensitive. To find some of the big names you might have expected to see here, we encourage you to use our dynamic ranking system and check influence over the past 20 and 50 years.\n\nTop Influential Mathematicians\n\n2010-2020\n\nWant more?

He has authored over 30 books during his storied career as a mathematician, and 80 research articles! No wonder, then, that in 2007 Devlin was awarded the Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization. These days, Devlinâs research is focused mainly on applying media and other technologies to help students and others learn about math. For instance, he is co-founder and president of BrainQuake, a company that makes video games to facilitate learning mathematics. He is also known as the âMath Guyâ on NPRâs Weekend Edition Saturday, where he is a commentator.\n\nDevlin became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in 2012.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n2.Terence Tao\n\nAreas of Specialization: Green-Tao Theorem, ErdÅs Discrepancy Problem, Compressed Sensing, Taoâs Inequality, Analysis, Oscillatory Integrals\n\nTao is arguably the greatest living mathematician, and has been called the greatest mathematician of his generation. Born in South Australia, Tao was a child prodigy, the youngest person ever to win a medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad-he was ten. He has since won the Field Medal, the âNobel Prizeâ for mathematicians. Terence Tao holds the James and Carol Collins Chair in Mathematics at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).\n\nAt the age of 14, Tao attended the Research Science Institute, a summer seminar for talented high school students hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). At the age of 16, he received his bachelorâs and masterâs degrees in mathematics at Princeton University. He received his Ph.D. from Princeton at age 20. He joined UCLA at the age of 24 and became the youngest person ever appointed to full professor by the university.\n\nTaoâs focus is on partial differential equations, a nonlinear area of calculus, or the mathematics of change. Those who know him are quick to point out that he has an impressive grasp of seemingly all of mathematics-a rare feat, particularly today in an age of specialization. He has also done important work in fields as diverse as probability theory to number theory. As fellow mathematician Timothy Gowers put it when reviewing one of Taoâs books, âit is not easy to find gaps in Taoâs knowledge, and if you do then you may well find that the gaps have been filled a year later.â\n\nTao has won numerous awards, including but not limited to the Field Medal (referenced above), in 2006 a MacArthur Award (the âgeniusâ award), Fellow of the Royal Society (2007), and in 2009 he was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\n3.Ian Stewart\n\nAreas of Specialization: Catastrophe theory, Dynamical Systems, Bifurcation Theory, Pattern Formation, Biomathematics\n\nStewart is Emeritus Professor of Mathematics at the University of Warwick, England.

Duke Professor of Mathematics at Duke University. Prior to Duke, Daubechies was William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University from 2004-2011. She is one of the most widely cited mathematicians, and is world renowned for her work on the mathematics of image compression, known as wavelets (an area of relevance to computer science and other disciplines in addition to mathematics). From Belgium, Daubechies received her bachelorâs in physics at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel in 1975. She received her Ph.D. from CNRS Center for Theoretical Physics in Marseille, France in 1980.\n\nDaubechies proved an important result in wavelet theory that extended the theory to digital signal processing, a result of significant theoretic and practical significance. Her work on wavelets has made her one of the most influential mathematicians of our era. Notably, Daubechies has also been active in encouraging women to pursue studies and careers in mathematics and other cognate fields (like physics). She is co-founder of the Duke Summer Workshop in Mathematics for promising female students.\n\nDaubechies was awarded the MacArthur Fellowship for her pivotal work in mathematics, and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1993. She received the Steele Prize for Exposition for her book Ten Lectures on Wavelets in 1994. She was also the first female president of the International Mathematical Union, among other notable distinctions.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n10.Andrew Wiles\n\nAreas of Specialization: Taniyama-Shimura Conjecture for Semistable Elliptic Curves, Fermatâs Last Theorem, Iwasawa Theory\n\nWiles is Royal Society Research Professor at the University of Oxford. He became an overnight sensation when he proved one of the most famous conjectures in all of mathematics, known as Fermatâs Last Theorem, after the 17th century mathematician Pierre Fermat. Wiles received his bachelorâs degree in Mathematics from Oxford and his Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Cambridge. He spent a year at Princeton Universityâs Institute for Advanced Study and then became Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University. He has taught back and forth between Princeton and Oxford for much of his stellar career.\n\nWiles became interested in Fermatâs Last Theorem as a child of ten, he recalls, and his later professional career became a quest to find a proof of the famous centuries old conjecture in number theory. When he proved it true in 1993, not just the world of mathematics but the entire world and the media reported the accomplishment (technically, it wasnât completely proved until 1994). Wiles thus enjoys status among mathematicians as having solved a problem many thought true, but essentially unprovable before him.\n\nNot surprisingly, Wiles has received many honors and awards for his career in mathematics, including the Fermat Prize (no surprise), the Wolf Prize, and a Copley Medal. He was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship in 1997.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n11.Caroline Klivans\n\nAreas of Specialization: Alegbraic, Geometric, and Topological Combinatorics, Chip-Firing\n\nCaroline Klivans currently holds the title of Associate Professor of Applied Mathematics in the Division of Applied Mathematics at Brown University; she is also the Associate Director of the Institute for Computational and Experimental Research in Mathematics (ICERM).

He received degrees in mathematics and physics at the University of Maryland, College Park at age 17. He received his Ph.D. in Mathematics at Princeton University in three years and by 22 he was full professor at the University of Chicago, the youngest full professor ever in the United States. At the ripe old age of 24, he returned to Princeton as full professor and has been there since. In 1984 he became Herbert Jones Professor of Mathematics at Princeton. Not surprisingly, the prodigy Fefferman won the Fields Medal in 1978.\n\nFeffermanâs work in mathematics is focused primarily on partial differential equations, having unknowns that require modeling. Partial differential equations often have useful applications in computer models of complex systems, like weather forecasting and climate change. In addition to his career working out important results in partial differential equations, Fefferman has been extraordinarily prolific in diverse topics in the study of mathematics, from the mathematics involved in financial prediction, to fluid dynamics in, say, turbulent systems (i.e., chaos theory) to the study of neural networks in computer science (neural networks are an important topic in machine learning).\n\nIn addition to the Fields Medal, Fefferman won the Wolf Prize in Mathematics in 2017, and is a fellow of the National Academy of Science as well as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n17.Manjul Bhargava\n\nAreas of Specialization: Bhargava Cube, Bhargava Factorial, 15 and 290 theorems\n\nBhargava is the R.

He is also Emeritus Fellow of Wadham College, a constituent college of Oxford, and an honorary Fellow of Saint Johnâs College, Cambridge. Penrose received his bachelorâs in mathematics (first-class degree) from University College, London, and completed his Ph.D. at St. Johnâs College, Cambridge in 1958.\n\nAlong with the late Stephen Hawking, Penrose is one of a select few mathematicians (or mathematical physicists, in the case of Hawking) who are generally known and âfamous.â Over his impressive career, Penrose has developed sophisticated mathematics to analyze Einsteinâs âspace-time,â contributing greatly to our understanding of fundamental physics. His exploration of mathematical singularities has expanded our understanding of core phenomena like the Big Bang and Black Holes. Penrose used advanced mathematics to develop a theory of how energy can be extracted from a Black Hole, now called the âPenrose processâ in his honor. He is also known for his contributions to tiling theory, another area of mathematics dealing with shapes and topologies. He discovered the eponymous Penrose tilings in 1974. He is also known for Penrose Diagrams, causal diagrams connecting points in spacetime.\n\nIn addition to his ongoing and fundamental contribution to mathematics and mathematical physics, Penrose is a successful popularizer of difficult concepts in the sciences. His The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe, published in 2004 is a readable tour of the laws of physics for interested non-specialists. He is also known for his foray into the problem of consciousness (what is the nature of conscious experience?), writing two widely-read books on the subject, where he argues that consciousness arises from quantum events in the brain.\n\nPenrose was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1972. Among his many other accomplishments, he won the prestigious Eddington Medal with Stephen Hawking in 1975, and the Albert Einstein Medal in 1990. In 1994, Penrose was knighted for his outstanding service to science and mathematics.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\n21.Edward Witten\n\nAreas of Specialization: String Theory, Quantum Gravity, Supersymmetric Quantum Field Theory\n\nWitten is Professor of Mathematical Physics at Princetonâs Institute for Advanced Study (IAS). He is known world-wide for his many important contributions to the mathematics of string theory and treatments of theoretical physics. Interestingly, Witten received his Bachelor of Arts degree in History, with a minor in Linguistics at Brandeis University in 1971. After graduation, Witten wrote for The New Republic and The Nation, and even worked on George McGovernâs presidential campaign! He returned to college and studied economics at the University of WisconsinâMadison before dropping out, returning to Princeton University to study applied mathematics, where he received his Ph.D. in Physics in 1976.\n\nThe rest, as they say, is history. Witten won the âgenius award,â the MacArthur Grant in 1982, and had won the Fields Medal in Mathematics in 1990. Technically a physicist (not a mathematician), the noted mathematician Michael Atiyah noted that Wittenâs âcommand of mathematics is rivaled by few mathematicians, and his ability to interpret physical ideas in mathematical form is quite unique.â Indeed, with Wittenâs talent it is difficult to separate his thinking about theoretical physics with mathematics proper, as the âthinkingâ about physics is done in the language of mathematics. At any rate, Witten is widely regarded as one of the finest mathematicians in the world, as the Fields Medal surely attests.\n\nAmong many other awards, Witten received the Nemmers Prize in Mathematics in 2000.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n22.James Maynard\n\nAreas of Specialization: Prime Gaps, Duffin-Schaeffer Conjecture\n\nJames Maynard is a research professor at the University of Oxford, and was previously a postdoctoral researcher at the UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al. He completed his bachelorâs and masterâs degrees at University of Cambridge in 2009, and earned his Ph.D. at Oxford in 2013.\n\nOne of the youngest names among influential mathematicians, Maynard was just 26 when he came to prominence after providing a different proof to a popular theory of prime gaps at the time provided by Yitang Zhang. Indeed, Maynard is seen as a kind of specialist in prime gaps, and also solved a conjecture proposed by Paul ErdÅs concerning the topic. More recently, he helped prove the Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture.\n\nFor his work, Maynard has received several major awards, including the SASTRA Ramanujan Prize, the Whitehead Prize, the EMS Prize, and the Cole Prize in Number Theory.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n23.Peter Lax\n\nAreas of Specialization: Lax-Wendroff Method, Lax Equivalence Theorem, BabuÅ¡ka-Lax-Milgram Theorem, Lax Pairs\n\nHungarian-born Peter Lax currently holds the title of Professor Emeritus at the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University. Lax began working at NYU in 1951; prior to that, he worked on the Manhattan Project.\n\nLaxâs family emigrated from Hungary in 1941 while he was a teenager, and at 17 he was able to study for three semesters at NYU (where he wound up acting as an instructor). He was drafted into the U.S. army and allowed to take classes at Texas A&M University, though his studies were again interrupted when he was sent to work at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, as well as the Manhattan Project (all before earning an undergraduate degree). He was finally able to return to NYU in 1946, earn his bachelorâs degree with pooled credits, and complete his PhD there in 1949.\n\nAs a mathematician, Lax is known for a wide body of work on partial differential equations, pure mathematics, fluid dynamics, shockwaves, and computing. In particular, Lax is famous for the âLax conjectureâ about hyperbolic polynomials, which he proposed in 1958, and which went unproven for over four decades.\n\nPublished works from Lax include Linear Algebra and Its Applications.\n\nFor his work, Lax has received numerous awards and honors, including membership with the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters and the (American) National Academy of Sciences, as well as a Lester R. Ford Award, National Medal of Science, Wolf Prize, Abel Prize, and fellowship with the American Mathematical Society.\n\nAcademic Website\n\n24.Barry Mazur\n\nAreas of Specialization: Diophantine Geometry, Generalized Schoenflies Conjecture, Mazur Swindle, Mazurâs Torsion Theorem\n\nBarry Mazur currently holds the title of Gerhard Gade University Professor at Harvard University, where he has worked as a professor since 1962. Prior to his long tenure at Harvard, Mazur held post-doctoral fellowships at Harvard and the Institute for Advanced Study. Mazur earned his PhD in Mathematics at Princeton University; though he attended Massachusetts Institute of Technology as an undergraduate, he did not complete a bachelorâs degree.\n\nMazur boasts a long career of discoveries and advancements in geometry, arithmetic, and number theory. In fact, he has several discoveries and proofs named after him, including the Mazur swindle, the Mazur manifold, and Mazurâs torsion theorem. Mazur is particularly famous for the latter, which was used by Andrew Wiles in his groundbreaking proof of Fermatâs Last Theorem.\n\nNotable works from Mazur include Imagining Numbers and Prime Numbers and the Riemann Hypothesis.\n\nFor his work, Mazur has received awards and honors including membership with the American Philosophical Society, the Steele Prize, the Cole Prize, and the Veblen prize from the American Mathematical Society, as well as fellowship, and the Chauvenet Prize from the Mathematical Association of America.\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\n25.Alain Connes\n\nAreas of Specialization: Baum-Connes Conjecture, Noncommutative Geometry, Operator Algebras, Thermal Time Hypothesis\n\nConnes is currently Professor at the CollÃ¨ge de France, IHÃS, in France, as well as at Ohio State University and Vanderbilt University. Connesâ work focuses on algebra, or what is known as âoperator algebra,â an important area in functional analysis. Born in France, Connes received his undergraduate degree in Mathematics from the prestigious Ãcole normale supÃ©rieure in Paris and his Ph.D. from the University Pierre et Marie Curie.\n\nAmong other notables, Connes was a member of Bourbaki, a group of predominantly French mathematicians who formed after the First World War in response to the loss of so many mathematicians in the wake of the war. The Bourbaki group (a pseudonym-there was no person âBourbakiâ) consisted of world-class mathematicians who contributed to mathematics by taking up the task of writing major new texts. Connes is also known for fundamental work in mathematics, such as the Connes embedding problem, a problem in algebra. He is also known for the Baum-Connes conjecture and has made important contributions to differential geometry.\n\nConnes was awarded the Fields Medal in 1982. He is a member of the French Academy of Sciences as well as the US National Academy of Sciences (and others, including Danish, Norwegian, and Russian).\n\nAcademic Website\n\nProfessional Website\n\nHonorable Mentions in Mathematics"
