        "text": "In mathematics it is said that a demonstration is elegant when it is made with the smallest number of steps and the intelligence of the observations leads to answering a question that at first glance seems difficult to solve, in a surprisingly simple way. For the thought is basically the same: a thought can be defined elegant when no matter how complicated and absurd it is in our mind, it is expressed in a simple and seemingly effortless way by the thinker. The Phosphorescent Room believes that the unnecessarily complicated, flashy, vulgar and over prolific way of thinking of our times, our thoughts need to be elegant more than brilliant and beautiful more than useful If you are interested in the findings of our research please contact us at thephosphorescentroom@gmail.com ---------- In the photo: Elegant thinkers at the Solvay conference. It is considered \"the most intelligent photo ever made\" due to the fact that 17 of the 29 attendees were or became Nobel Prize winners.\n\n#Science #technology #knowledge Science, derived from the Latin word *scientia* meaning \"knowledge,\" is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge through testable explanations and predictions about the universe. It is a broad and dynamic field that encompasses a variety of disciplines, each dedicated to understanding specific aspects of the natural and physical world. Science relies on empirical evidence, logical reasoning, and rigorous methodologies to uncover the principles governing the cosmos. This article provides an in-depth overview of science and its main fields.

The depth of the sentence is important. We all go to university and industry every day, we do things like computing chemistry (DFT, Gaussian and...), sometimes we do research or sometimes we are in the laboratory. But most of the time we see that most of them repeat the previous methods and wait for creativity, If any student does something new during a test, most professors punish or ignore it. Lets dive into innovation and creativity. In honor of all the supervisors and professors who have always been innovative , creative, and They do not hesitate to do their best to increase the creativity and ability of the new generation and students. cheers.\n\nAlbert Einstein and Peter Drucker were rare geniuses that both left a trail of success supported by significant achievement. Both are widely ranked among the greatest and most influential in their fields. Yet neither followed the models of scientific research which are sought by most universities. In this article, we take a look at how each approached research and how we can apply the same in our own analysis, problem-solving, decision-making and strategic planning. https://lnkd.in/ejjWSYvF #peterdrucker #druckermanagement #operationalexcellence #leansixsigma\n\nScientists and philosophers have grappled with the concept of emergence in complex systems for a long time. Emergent phenomena are those fascinating instances where the whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts, which gives rise to unexpected behaviors and properties. We‚Äôre familiar with examples of emergence such as the collective intelligence of ant colonies or the consciousness emerging from billions of neurons, for example. Even though we've been able to observe and describe emergent behaviors, predicting them has remained largely out of reach. This means that when it comes to dealing with complexity we are left being more reactive than proactive. Recent research has given us some new tools. By bridging concepts from information theory, computational mechanics, and complex systems science, researchers have developed a theoretical framework that, for the first time, provides a formal foundation for understanding and potentially predicting emergent phenomena. #complexity #emergence https://lnkd.in/g8VpYF8X\n\nYann LeCun: ‚ÄúIf you do research and don‚Äôt publish, it‚Äôs not Science. Research must be correct and reproducible.‚Äù Elon Musk: ‚ÄúOur mission of understanding the universe [‚Ä¶] requires maximally rigorous pursuit of the truth, without regard to popularity or political correctness‚Äù üìç However, even among scientists, ‚Äúdoing science‚Äù does not always equate to ‚Äúdoing genuine research.‚Äù Reproducibility Crisis: In fields like chemistry, medicine, biology, and physics, a significant portion of work remains irreproducible. The ability to replicate experiments and obtain consistent results is crucial for scientific progress. Awful Statistics: Some research suffers from poor statistical practices. Researchers may cherry-pick data or draw broad conclusions from a limited sample size. Methodological Expertise: Mistakes and misinterpretations often lurk in scientific publications. Even well-known scientists occasionally use methods without deep expertise in those areas. Asking Deep Questions: Many scientists stick to mainstream topics, avoiding riskier research. However, true breakthroughs come from asking novel and profound questions. üìç My Point: Science is gaining public attention due to new technologies, discoveries, and social media. It‚Äôs crucial to maintain high-quality research: Be bold and explore uncharted territory. Publish rigorously and only when the study meets robust standards. Real science withstands the test of time, and you have the power to uphold its integrity. üåü Tamas Sohajda #science #research #education #publishing"
