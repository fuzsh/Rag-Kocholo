        "text": "This image was created on a HELIOS FIB - a Focused Ion Beam microscope - sometime during my PhD. I was trying to create pyramids on a silicon wafer of different sizes - from a few nanometers in height to a few micrometers. Back then I was an experimentalist and the idea was to squeeze nano and micropyramids with the sharp probe of an AFM to see how much current it generates. The FIB has a very simple system that allows the user to input a bitmap as the input where each pixel has a value between 0 and 1. The FIB converts this to a milling depth so that highly energetic ions of Argon strike the surface like cannon balls creating atom sized holes. The bimap can be as complex as needed helping to create complex 3D structures on thin film surfaces. Such as this beauty. #materials #Science #Technology\n\nLast week, I had the pleasure of attending the FAIR train workshop organized to inspire and educate the next generation of material scientists on the importance of FAIR principles (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, Reusable). I spoke about my experience in developing the MatKG dataset, which was a great learning for me in creating FAIR compatible data. Gretchen Greene from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) spoke about the importance of FAIR in databases while Jane Greenberg from Drexel University discussed metadata. Dr. Markus Schilling at BAM demonstrated the development of Matolab. FAIR wasn't something I heard anytme during my grad school or before. But all the fundamental principles seem pretty common sense so it's surprising that we material scientists don't think of making our data or experiments more reproducible and logical. Alejandro Strachan from NanoHub showed a live demo of property prediction in phases while Brian Schuster and David Elbert shared ongoing projects from their labs. A big thank you to the organizers - Olga Wodo, Brian Schuster, and David Elbert for this great experience! #materials #Science #technology #FAIR\n\nThis picture is from the early days of my PhD. I was trying to do a high temperature anneal of some film on a silicon wafer. By high temperature I mean 900 C - which is crazy - we generally don't heat a silicon wafer to these temperatures but I did not know it back then. The annealed film looked good but it kept shorting whenever I tried to take a capacitance reading. It turned out that the problem was with the platinum bottom electrode - a 200 nm thin layer of platinum coating the entire wafer surface. Above 700 C or so, platinum starts liquifying and as it liquifies, it starts 'dewetting' from the silicon surface - much like how water scrambles across a nonstick pan. This behavior is clearly seen in the image below. Platinum has moved away from the dark areas, coagulating in certain regions and forming large grains as it cools down. It's a simple process and rather well known. But for me, it was an early aha moment that cemented the tight bond between structure and property in materials, even if we cannot always see it. #materials #science #technology\n\nReviewers can be tough and reviews can be nasty. But there are some first impressions of scientific work that just don't age well. The great Linus Pauling famously said that \"there are no quasi crystals only quasi scientists\" in response to the work of Dan Shechtman who had just discovered non periodic crystals. Shechtman would go on to win the Nobel Prize for his discovery. But then Pauling was probably drunk on vitamin C. A century ago, W L Bragg announced that \"In Sodium Chloride there appear to be no molecules represented by NaCl. The equality in number of sodium and chlorine atoms is arrived at by a chessboard pattern of these atoms; it is the result of geometry and not of a pairing-off of the atoms\". In short, he was saying that if you keep breaking down a salt crystal, you will not end up with a \"molecule\" of salt. Ionic crystals like NaCl just don't have molecules. This was revolutionary for the time, given that all anyone knew in Chemistry were atoms and molecules. That here was a thing without a \"soul\" was hard to swallow. Writing in Nature, the chemist H E Armstrong decried this as \"more than repugnant to common sense\", \"absurd to the nth degree\", and \"chemical cricket\" (he was English). He declared that \"Chemistry is neither chess nor geometry, whatever X-ray physics may be. Such unjustified aspersion of the molecular character of our most necessary condiment must not be allowed to pass unchallenged\" . You've got to admire the man's love for salt. It should be noted that by this time, W.L. Bragg had already won the Nobel Prize for X-ray crystallography and was thus a well-renowned figure, unlike the relatively unknown Shechtman. The worst criticism that I've so far received is \"this proposal seems to be written by a grad student with no experience in proposal writing\". I was a grad student and I had no experience in proposal writing - so the reviewer gets marks for accuracy. If Armstrong or Pauling had read the said proposal, I would probably have quit Science! #materials #technology #history\n\nIs it \"Material Science\" or \"Materials Science\"? The first materials science department in the world was founded at Northwestern University in Illinois January 1959. In February of 1958, a memo was submitted to the dean with the title \"The Importance of Materials Science and Engineering\". However, the first line of this memo read \"Traditionally, the field of material science...\" Commenting on this in 2001, R W Cahn wrote that \"even at this early stage, the final 's' in 'materials' was toggled on and off\". I always instinctively write \"material science\" as \"material\" sounds more like an adjective than \"materials\" (which sounds like a plural noun). Also, 'material science' rolls faster off the tongue - the extra 's' feels like a bump on the road. However, the accepted term today is \"Materials Science\" - symbolizing the science of all materials and not just any single material. At the same time, I would argue that \"vehicle science\", \"ship science\", \"people science\" sounds more correct than \"vehicles science\", \"ships science\" or \"peoples science\". However, \"material scientist\" sounds weird. If I am a 'material scientist' does that make all other scientists immaterial? Out of curiosity, I searched through 10 million publications in the field for instances of both 'material science' and 'materials science'. You can see the result below . The values are normalized (divided by number of publications in that year). The overall consesus is \"materials science\" though there are still a few that accidentally roll out a 'material science' once in a while. Why do you think it should be \"materials\" or \"material\"? #materials #science #technology\n\nIt was my great priviledge and pleasure to speak at the India Science Festival 2024 held at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. I spoke on \"The role of Artificial Intelligence in the Future of Material Science\". In 25 minutes, I tried to convey in the simplest of terms why: 1. It is very very difficult to discover a new material. 2. Why materials are so cool and indispensable to civilization. (Think bronze age, iron age, paper age) 3. What are the challenges in discovering new materials. 4. How Artificial Intelligence is beginning to create a new pathway for us to discover new materials. 5. Why you should care. I found it very hard to distill down the essense of my work in terms simple enough for a lay audience. For example, how do you explain 'Density Functional theory' or 'Active Learning' to a middle schooler? (The answer is not to explain). I tried my talk on several people (including my parents, room mates, and unsuspecting friends) for feedback - all of whom helped make the talk better. The audience was a pleasure to talk to and engage with. I stayed on the stage for an additional 30 minutes answering some great questions after which I answered more great questions offstage for 90 minutes! You can watch the whole talk here: https://lnkd.in/gymsCnQm Thanks to India Science Festival, Foundation for Advancing Science and Technology - India, and Varun Aggarwal for the kind invitation. And all the great organizers for taking such good care of me. [Follow me for your daily dose of Science]\n\nAt the University of Michigan today for the annual conference of Scientific Foundation Models. I'm excited to listen to all the amazing speakers lined for today. Karthik Duraisamy opened the session with a series of interesting questions setting the stage for a deep discussion of foundation models. 30 minutes in and I'm already learning a lot! Heng Ji spoke about Joint language and molecule representation for drug discovery highlighting that there are over 166 billion small molecules of which 970 million are known to be drug like! There is no future for drug discovery without AI. Arvind Ramanathan spoke about GenSLM, a model pretrained on genomic data that predicted new strains of the #COVID virus a year before they actually manifested! Venkat Viswanathan spoke about scaling up Materials models and the evidence of scaling laws from the domain. Its already one of the most informed discussions on scientific model building I have been to so far. Looking forward to the rest of the conference.

This metal, vital for batteries in cell phones, laptops, and electric vehicles, is abundant in the arid salt flats at the junction of Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia. Spanning 500,000 square kilometers, the Altiplano-Puna Plateau in the Central Andes stands as the world's second highest plateau. Its unique climatic and geological conditions have fostered extensive underground lithium reserves. Positioned over a vast active magma reservoir, the Altiplano-Puna receives minimal rainfall but benefits from hydrothermal fluids that replenish its aquifers. These conditions have led to significant lithium accumulation, with Bolivia, Argentina, and Chile hosting approximately half of the globe's measured lithium resources. Lithium mines in northwestern Argentina's Jujuy province utilize light blue evaporation ponds to process lithium from brine. This method, highlighted in Landsat 8 images, showcases the region's contribution to lithium production. The expansion of lithium mining, as evidenced by Landsat imagery, underscores the growing demand for lithium, which has seen global production surge from 15,000 metric tons in 2001 to 146,000 metric tons in 2022. This growth highlights the critical role of lithium in our technological future. This exploration of lithium in the Central Andes illuminates the intersection of geology, technology, and sustainability, marking a significant chapter in our quest for renewable energy sources.

We know that Taylor Swift is an economic and cultural juggernaut but it seems that \"swifties\" literally causes earthquakes when they are at her concerts. A new study by the Seismological Laboratory, Pasadena shows that a Swift concert held on 5 August 2023 in Inglewood California produced tremors that could be measured at seismic network stations located 9 km away. The 70,000 strong concert generated 2.3 magnitude quakes on the richter scale. Each song even had a distinctive tremor that resulted in energy being radiated in all directions. \"Shake it off\" had the highest energy, followed by \"You belong with me\" and \"Love Story\". To be fair, all large gathering produce seismic signatures that can be measured - including football games and rock concerts. What sets the current work apart is that they have managed to isolate the vibrations as being due to crowd motion in response to music.
