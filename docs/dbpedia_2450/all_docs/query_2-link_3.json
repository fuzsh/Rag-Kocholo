        "text": "About ten years ago Ahcène Lamari and Nicholas Buchdahl independently proved that all compact complex surfaces with even first Betti number are Kahler. This was known since 1983, but earlier proofs made use of the classification of surfaces to reduce to hard case-by-case verification.\n\nAt the time, Lamari was a teacher at a high school in Paris. Apparently he announced his result by crashing a conference in Paris and going up to Siu (who had proved the last case in the earlier proof in 1983) with a copy of his proof. Lamari's proof was published in the Annales de l'Institut Fourier in 1999 (Courants kählériens et surfaces compactes, Annales de l'institut Fourier, 49 no. 1 (1999), p. 263-285, doi:10.5802/aif.1673), next to Buchdahl's (On compact Kähler surfaces, Annales de l'institut Fourier, 49 no. 1 (1999), p. 287-302, doi: 10.5802/aif.1674)\n\nGreg Egan. He's a very renowned science fiction writer who holds a bachelor degree in mathematics. He wrote, as a coauthor, 2 articles which were published in peer-reviewed journals, one of them is with John Baez. The first one was written when he was approximately 40 years old.\n\nThere's also more eccentric example of Andrew Beal, which is much more known in the world of poker. He made however one minor conjecture in number theory for whose proof or disproof he offers $100,000.\n\nAnd there's also a list on wikipedia which might be worth going through.\n\nEdit: (nov-2018) Some recent progress by G. Egan has been made with an anonymous 4chan-member, on a problem on permutations.\n\nThe complete graph on $n$ vertices $K_n$ is not planar for $n \\geq 5.$ One may ask: what is the maximum Euler characteristic $\\gamma(K_n)$ among all compact orientable surfaces into which $K_n$ may be embedded? It is a nice exercise to embed $K_5,$ $K_6,$ and $K_7$ into the torus. The final result was that $\\gamma(K_n) = 2 \\lfloor \\frac{n (7 - n)}{12} \\rfloor.$ In 1968 this theorem had been proven for \"all cases except $n = 18,20,$ and $23.$ The proof was completed, at the end of the sixties, by Jean Mayer, a professor of French literature (!), when he found embeddings for these three values.\" (Surface topology, Firby and Gardiner, p. 111).\n\nKenneth A. Perko Jr. is a lawyer and an amateur topologist (with graduate-level training). In 1974 he found that two knots that were listed as separate knots in C. N. Little's \"On knots, with a census for order 10\" (1885) and similar tables, were actually identical.\n\nMathoverflow-user Daniel Moskovich recounted earlier on this site:\n\nLittle (with Tait and Kirkman) compiled his tables combinatorially. He drew all possible 4-valent graphs with some number of vertices (in this case 10), and resolved 4-valent vertices into crossings in all possible ways. He ended up with 210 knots. Then he worked BY HAND to eliminate doubles, by making physical models with string. He failed to bring these two knots to the same position, and concluded that they must be different. It took almost 100 years to find the ambient isotopy which shows that there are the same knot.\n\nThe book \"Knots and Links\" by Dale Rolfsen, published two years after Perko's publication, still lists the knots as different, they are knots [; 10_{161} ;] and [; 10_{162} ;] in Appendix C.\n\nAn anonymous poster of a 4chan messaging board, in thinking about how long it would take to watch a 14-episode nonlinear anime program in any order, improved the lower bound for a length of a superpermutation. A superpermutation is a string that contains each permutation of $n$ elements as a substring. See OEIS A180632. Superpermutations are somewhat similar to De Bruijn sequences.\n\nWhether the anonymous poster meets the definition of \"amateur\" may never be known, but the posting was from 2011, and apparently was noted by a handful of other mathematicians who think about these things not long afterwards.\n\nThe story has taken off in the public recently in part because Greg Egan, who was previously mentioned, has also in October 2018 improved the upper bound on the length of a minimal superpermutation.\n\nQuanta Magazine has a nice article as well.\n\nEugène Ehrhart was a high school teacher when he discovered the so-called Ehrhart polynomial, at the age of 55. He got his PhD at the age of 60.\n\nLet $\\Delta$ be a polytope with integral vertices in $\\bf R^d$. Then there exists a polynomial $P$ such that for every integer $n$, $P(n)$ is the number of integral points in $n\\Delta $. This polynomial satisfies a duality property: $(-1)^dP(-n)$ is the number of integral vertices in the interior of $P$. This duality property has been interpreted as Serre duality on toric varieties by Khovanskii in the 80's. The geometric interpretation of the coefficients of $P$ is still an open problem despite a huge literature. See http://icps.u-strasbg.fr/~clauss/Ehrhart.html for a short bibliography, and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ehrhart_polynomial for an introduction to the subject.\n\nBill Gates co-authored the following paper in the 1970s with Christos Papadimitriou:\n\n\"Bounds for sorting by prefix reversal,\" Discrete Mathematics 27 (1979), no. 1, 47–57, MR0534952.\n\nNot sure if Gates counts as an amateur, but he is at least a college dropout. :)\n\nThe only reason I know this is because once I ran across a book or article that discusses the results in this paper and then says something like, \"Yes, this is THE Bill Gates.\" I was almost certain the book or article was by Knuth, but now I can't find the reference in any of my Knuth books. If someone else knows the reference I'm talking about, I would be grateful if they would post it as a comment to my answer. (It now bothers me that I can't find that reference. :) )\n\nKurt Heegner was a radio engineer by trade, but gave (essentially) the first proof of the Gauss class number one problem in 1952: namely that $\\mathbb{Q}\\sqrt{d}$ has class number $1$ if and only if $d \\in \\{-1, -2, -3, -7, -11, -19, -43, -67, -163\\}$. Unfortunately, his work was largely ignored until around 1967, two years after his death.\n\nHis ideas also led to the development of Heegner points, which are very influential in modern number theory.\n\nI was hoping that someone would add David Smith to this list. But a few days has passed and no one has brought this up. So please allow me to kick this thread a bit.\n\nAs discussed in another answer, it is recently discovered that the “einstein” tiling exists, settling a long-standing open problem. This discovery is primarily credited to David Smith, who describes himself as a shape hobbyist.\n\nThe story is also featured in QuantaMagazine.\n\nRichard Friedberg, then an undergraduate pre-medical student, independently solved Post's problem (of whether there are intermediate Turing degrees) by the priority-injury method. This was a significant open problem at the time, so the result made news:\n\n1956 news article \"Senior solves logic problem, astounds mathematicians\"\n\nIn Gödel's now famous letter to von Neumann that introduced the P vs NP problem, Gödel wrote\n\nI do not know if you have heard that “Post’s problem”, whether there are degrees of unsolvability among problems of the form (∃y)φ(y, x), where φ is recursive, has been solved in the positive sense by a very young man by the name of Richard Friedberg. The solution is very elegant. Unfortunately, Friedberg does not intend to study mathematics, but rather medicine (apparently under the influence of his father).\n\nFriedberg ended up becoming a physicist (Wikipedia biography).\n\nHow about Saul Kripke?\n\nKripke-Platek set theory \"is used all over the place, in recursion theory and set theory, [b]oth in classical results, and in fairly recent ones.\"\n\nModern philosophers (of science, mathematics, language etc. -- analytical philosophers) are probably a rich source of the list you seek. many do not have above-undergrad training in math, although I would use the definition of 'amateur' that we think of when we think of the ancients. that is, people who are distinctly in another field but make contributions to mathematics as part of their work or hobby.\n\nAs for other philosophers/logicians (off the top):\n\nPutnam\n\nFrank Ramsey (I don't have the rep to post more links--had a bunch for this question)\n\nI know that by the time we get to someone like Ramsey, everyone's like: \"surely that's not an amateur mathematician\" but by the definition given in the question, i think he fits.\n\nAt any rate, you can probably find the names you're looking for in analytical philosophy, (mathematical/computational) economics/biology/linguistics, and so on.\n\nThe problem, I suspect, will be (in addition to the definition of 'amateur' which is not too difficult in my opinion, as long as you are satisfied with it for your list) the definitions of 'important' and 'discovery'. For example, I've known about Kripke's contributions for a while but I don't know, even now, whether this community considers them as important.\n\nIn 2002, Manindra Agrawal, Neeraj Kayal, and Nitin Saxena proved the amazing result \"PRIMES is in P,\" i.e., there is a deterministic, polynomial time algorithm for determining whether a given number is prime or not. The resulting paper was published in the Annals in 2004. The story was covered in the New York Times. The trio won the 2006 Fulkerson Prize, and the 2006 Gödel Prize.\n\nIn 2002, Kayal and Saxena were undergraduate students. I'd say that counts as \"amateur.\""
