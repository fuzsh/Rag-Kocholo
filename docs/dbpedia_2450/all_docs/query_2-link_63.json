        "text": "From Quanta Magazine\n\n3.14.24\n\nCharlie Wood\n\nForces push one way near the proton’s center and the opposite way near its surface. Credit: Samuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine.\n\nPhysicists have begun to explore the proton as if it were a subatomic planet. Cutaway maps display newfound details of the particle’s interior. The proton’s core features pressures more intense than in any other known form of matter. Halfway to the surface, clashing vortices of force push against each other. And the “planet” as a whole is smaller than previous experiments had suggested.\n\nThe experimental investigations mark the next stage in the quest to understand the particle that anchors every atom and makes up the bulk of our world.\n\n“We really see it as opening up a completely new direction that will change our way of looking at the fundamental structure of matter,” said Latifa Elouadrhiri, a physicist at the DOE’s Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility in Newport News, Virginia, who is involved in the effort.\n\nThe experiments literally shine a new light on the proton. Over decades, researchers have meticulously mapped out the electromagnetic influence of the positively charged particle. But in the new research, the Jefferson Lab physicists are instead mapping the proton’s gravitational influence — namely, the distribution of energies, pressures and shear stresses throughout, which bend the space-time fabric in and around the particle. The researchers do so by exploiting a peculiar way in which pairs of photons, particles of light, can imitate a graviton, the hypothesized particle that conveys the force of gravity. By pinging the proton with photons, they indirectly infer how gravity would interact with it, realizing a decades-old dream of interrogating the proton in this alternative way.\n\n“It’s a tour de force,” said Cédric Lorcé, a physicist at the Ecole Polytechnique in France who was not involved in the work. “Experimentally, it’s extremely complicated.”\n\nFrom Photons to Gravitons\n\nPhysicists have learned a tremendous amount about the proton over the last 70 years by repeatedly hitting it with electrons.\n\nThey know that its electric charge extends roughly 0.8 femtometers, or quadrillionths of a meter, from its center. They know that incoming electrons tend to glance off one of three quarks — elementary particles with fractions of charge — that buzz about inside it. They have also observed the deeply strange consequence of quantum theory where, in more forceful collisions, electrons appear to encounter a frothy sea made up of far more quarks as well as gluons, the carriers of the so-called strong force, which glues the quarks together.\n\nAll this information comes from a single setup: You fire an electron at a proton, and the particles exchange a single photon — the carrier of the electromagnetic force — and push each other away. This electromagnetic interaction tells physicists how quarks, as charged objects, tend to arrange themselves. But there is a lot more to the proton than its electric charge.\n\n“How are matter and energy distributed?” asked Peter Schweitzer, a theoretical physicist at the University of Connecticut. “We don’t know.”\n\nSchweitzer has spent most of his career thinking about the gravitational side of the proton. Specifically, he’s interested in a matrix of properties of the proton called the energy-momentum tensor. “The energy-momentum tensor knows everything there is to be known about the particle,” he said.\n\nIn Albert Einstein’s Theory of General Relativity, which casts gravitational attraction as objects following curves in space-time, the energy-momentum tensor tells space-time how to bend. It describes, for instance, the arrangement of energy (or, equivalently, mass) — the source of the lion’s share of space-time twisting. It also tracks information about how momentum is distributed, as well as where there will be compression or expansion, which can also lightly curve space-time.\n\nIf we could learn the shape of space-time surrounding a proton, Russian and American physicists independently worked out in the 1960s, we could infer all the properties indexed in its energy-momentum tensor. Those include the proton’s mass and spin, which are already known, along with the arrangement of the proton’s pressures and forces, a collective property physicists refer to as the “Druck term,” after the word for pressure in German. This term is “as important as mass and spin, and nobody knows what it is,” Schweitzer said — though that’s starting to change.\n\nIn the ’60s, it seemed as if measuring the energy-momentum tensor and calculating the Druck term would require a gravitational version of the usual scattering experiment: You fire a massive particle at a proton and let the two exchange a graviton — the hypothetical particle that makes up gravitational waves — rather than a photon. But due to the extreme weakness of gravity, physicists expect graviton scattering to occur 39 orders of magnitude more rarely than photon scattering. Experiments can’t possibly detect such a weak effect.\n\n“I remember reading about this when I was a student,” said Volker Burkert, a member of the Jefferson Lab team. The takeaway was that “we probably will never be able to learn anything about mechanical properties of particles.”\n\nGravity Without Gravity\n\nGravitational experiments are still unimaginable today. But research in the late 1990s and early 2000s by the physicists Xiangdong Ji and, working separately, the late Maxim Polyakov revealed a workaround.\n\nThe general scheme is the following. When you fire an electron lightly at a proton, it usually delivers a photon to one of the quarks and glances off. But in fewer than one in a billion events, something special happens. The incoming electron sends in a photon. A quark absorbs it and then emits another photon a heartbeat later. The key difference is that this rare event involves two photons instead of one — both incoming and outgoing photons. Ji’s and Polyakov’s calculations showed that if experimentalists could collect the resulting electron, proton and photon, they could infer from the energies and momentums of these particles what happened with the two photons. And that two-photon experiment would be essentially as informative as the impossible graviton-scattering experiment.\n\nCredit: Merrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine.\n\nHow could two photons know anything about gravity? The answer involves gnarly mathematics. But physicists offer two ways of thinking about why the trick works.\n\nPhotons are ripples in the electromagnetic field, which can be described by a single arrow, or vector, at each location in space indicating the field’s value and direction. Gravitons would be ripples in the geometry of space-time, a more complicated field represented by a combination of two vectors at every point. Capturing a graviton would give physicists two vectors of information. Short of that, two photons can stand in for a graviton, since they also collectively carry two vectors of information.\n\nAn alternative interpretation of the math goes as follows. During the moment that elapses between when a quark absorbs the first photon and when it emits the second, the quark follows a path through space. By probing this path, we can learn about properties like the pressures and forces that surround the path.\n\n“We are not doing a gravitational experiment,” Lorcé said. But “we should obtain indirect access to how a proton should interact with a graviton.”\n\nProbing Planet Proton\n\nThe Jefferson Lab physicists scraped together a few two-photon scattering events in 2000. That proof of concept motivated them to build a new experiment, and in 2007, they smashed electrons into protons enough times to amass roughly 500,000 graviton-mimicking collisions. Analyzing the experimental data took another decade.\n\nFrom their index of space-time-bending properties, the team extracted the elusive Druck term, publishing their estimate of the proton’s internal pressures in Nature in 2018.\n\nThey found that in the heart of the proton, the strong force generates pressures of unimaginable intensity — 100 billion trillion trillion pascals, or about 10 times the pressure at the heart of a neutron star. Farther out from the center, the pressure falls and eventually turns inward, as it must for the proton not to blow itself apart. “This comes out of the experiment,” Burkert said. “Yes, a proton is actually stable.” (This finding has no bearing on whether protons decay, however, which involves a different type of instability predicted by some speculative theories.)\n\nCredit: Merrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine.\n\nThe Jefferson Lab group continued to analyze the Druck term. They released an estimate of the shear forces — internal forces pushing parallel to the proton’s surface — as part of a review published in December. The physicists found that close to its core, the proton experiences a twisting force that gets neutralized by a twisting in the other direction nearer the surface. These measurements also underscore the particle’s stability. The twists had been expected based on theoretical work from Schweitzer and Polyakov. “Nonetheless, witnessing it emerging from the experiment for the first time is truly astounding,” Elouadrhiri said.\n\nNow they’re using these tools to calculate the proton’s size in a new way. In traditional scattering experiments, physicists had observed that the particle’s electric charge extends about 0.8 femtometers from its center (that is, its constituent quarks buzz about in that region). But that “charge radius” has some quirks. In the case of the neutron, for instance — the proton’s neutral counterpart, in which two negatively charged quarks tend to hang out deep inside the particle while one positively charged quark spends more time near the surface — the charge radius comes out as a negative number. “It doesn’t mean the size is negative; it’s just not a faithful measure,” Schweitzer said.\n\nThe new approach measures the region of space-time that’s significantly curved by the proton. In a preprint that has not yet been peer reviewed, the Jefferson Lab team calculated that this radius may be about 25% smaller than the charge radius, just 0.6 femtometers.\n\nPlanet Proton’s Limits\n\nConceptually, this kind of analysis smooths out the blurry dance of quarks into a solid, planetlike object, with pressures and forces acting on each speck of volume. That frozen planet does not fully reflect the raucous proton in all its quantum glory, but it’s a useful model. “It’s an interpretation,” Schweitzer said.\n\nAnd physicists stress that the initial maps are rough, for a few reasons.\n\nFirst, precisely measuring the energy-momentum tensor would require much higher collision energies than Jefferson Lab can produce. The team has worked hard to carefully extrapolate trends from the relatively low energies they can access, but physicists remain unsure how accurate these extrapolations are.\n\nMoreover, the proton is more than its quarks; it also contains gluons, which slosh around with their own pressures and forces. The two-photon trick cannot detect gluons’ effects. A separate team at Jefferson Lab used an analogous trick (involving a double-gluon interaction) to publish a preliminary gravitational map of these gluon effects in Nature last year, but it too was based on limited, low-energy data.\n\n“It’s a first step,” said Yoshitaka Hatta, a physicist at the DOE’s Brookhaven National Laboratory who was inspired to start studying the gravitational proton after the Jefferson Lab group’s 2018 work.\n\nIn the meantime, physicists are pushing ahead with digital experiments. Phiala Shanahan, a nuclear and particle physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, leads a team that computes the behavior of quarks and gluons starting from the equations of the strong force. In 2019, she and her collaborators estimated the pressures and shear forces, and in October, they estimated the radius, among other properties. So far, their digital findings have broadly aligned with Jefferson Lab’s physical ones. “I am certainly quite excited by the consistency between recent experimental results and our data,” Shanahan said.\n\nEven the blurry glimpses of the proton attained so far have gently reshaped researchers’ understanding of the particle.\n\nSome consequences are practical. At CERN, the European organization that runs the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest proton smasher, physicists had previously assumed that in certain rare collisions, quarks could be anywhere within the colliding protons.\n\nBut the gravitationally inspired maps suggest that quarks tend to hang out near the center in such cases.\n\n“Already the models they use at CERN have been updated,” said Francois-Xavier Girod, a Jefferson Lab physicist who worked on the experiments.\n\nThe new maps may also offer guidance toward resolving one of the deepest mysteries of the proton: why quarks bind themselves into protons at all. There’s an intuitive argument that because the strong force between each pair of quarks intensifies as they get further apart, like an elastic band, quarks can never escape from their comrades.\n\nBut protons are made from the lightest members of the quark family. And lightweight quarks can also be thought of as lengthy waves extending beyond the proton’s surface. This picture suggests that the binding of the proton may come about not through the internal pulling of elastic bands but through some external interaction between these wavy, drawn-out quarks. The pressure map shows the attraction of the strong force extending all the way out to 1.4 femtometers and beyond, bolstering the argument for such alternative theories.\n\n“It’s not a definite answer,” Girod said, “but it points toward the fact that these simple images with elastic bands are not relevant for light quarks.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Credit: Nash Weerasekera for Quanta Magazine.\n\nIt is a truth of both physics and everyday experience that things fall apart. Ice melts. Buildings crumble. Any object, if you wait long enough, gets mixed up with itself and its surroundings beyond recognition.\n\nBut beginning in 2005, a series of breakthroughs made this death march seem optional. In just the right quantum setting, any arrangement of electrons or atoms would stay put for all eternity — even uneven arrangements thrumming with activity. The finding flew in the face of the conventional wisdom that quantum phenomena were fragile things, observable only at extremely low temperatures. It also punched a hole in the foundations of thermodynamics, the venerable branch of physics that explains phenomena like heat and entropy as inevitable consequences of the interplay of vast swarms of particles.\n\nThe results came as a shock to physicists like Norman Yao, a graduate student at the time who is now a professor at Harvard University. “Holy hell,” he recalled thinking, using a stronger word than hell. “If this is true in an interacting, many-particle system, then statistical mechanics fails. Thermodynamics fails.”\n\nThe notion of a radical new quantum stability spread. It inspired theorists to conjure up a menagerie of new phases of quantum matter such as time crystals — systems that sustain a repeating behavior indefinitely without absorbing energy. And quantum engineers battling the skittishness of qubits to build quantum computers took heart at this indication that their fight was a winnable one.\n\n“In a quantum computer you need to have memory of your initial conditions; otherwise you can’t do anything,” Yao said.\n\nThe accumulation of evidence peaked in 2014 with a rigorous mathematical proof that quantum patterns could indeed last forever.\n\nIn recent years, however, the promise of eternally stable quantum structures has itself begun to wobble. Such patterns can indeed last for eons, as the breakthrough experiments found. But a debate rages as to whether those eons can truly stretch out to eternity, as many physicists have believed. In the course of dissecting the fundamental nature of quantum fate, the physicists involved have discovered previously unknown quantum phenomena that threaten the stability of great hordes of particles.\n\n“You thought you understood [this idea] really well, and now you don’t,” said Vedika Khemani, a physicist at Stanford University. “That’s fun. There’s a mystery to solve again.”\n\nA Taste of Eternity\n\nAn early intimation of quantum eternity was picked up by Phil Anderson, a physicist who would become a legend in his field. In the 1950s, Anderson was at Bell Labs studying what was then bleeding-edge physics — the behavior of electrons inside semiconductors. While trying to understand some puzzling experimental results, he found himself thinking about a more abstract problem.\n\nWas it possible, Anderson wondered, to trap a single quantum particle in place?\n\nIt’s easy to trap a classical object, such as a billiard ball. Just surround it with barriers, like the rails of a billiard table. But quantum particles can travel with complete disregard for barriers by “tunneling” through them. The catch is that they can’t travel far. Tunneling becomes hard — that is, exponentially unlikely — the further a particle tries to go. Anderson wondered what surroundings could contain a quantum escape artist.\n\nThe secret, he found, was to stick the particle in a “disordered” quantum landscape, one dotted with peaks and valleys. Each location would have a random height, representing a random energy. In a real material, this disorder might come from impurities such as missing atoms or atoms of different elements.\n\nWith enough disorder, Anderson concluded, a particle would never tunnel far. In order to tunnel, a particle needs to find a location with a similar energy (or at a similar altitude) to the one it starts out in. And more disorder makes such sites scarcer. By looking further into the landscape, a particle might be able to scout candidate sites at a decent clip. This rate could be quite fast in “higher” dimensions like 2D planes and 3D bricks, where the particle has more options available to it. But the exponential difficulty of reaching those locations would always rise even faster, making tunneling an unlikely proposition.\n\nCredit: Merrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine.\n\nTunneling was not enough, Anderson argued in a 1958 paper. A disordered landscape of any dimension would “localize” a particle. The work went essentially unread for years, although it would eventually help secure him a share of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics.\n\nWhile Anderson’s musings had been inspired by electrons in a semiconductor, his framing reveals that he was thinking more abstractly. The anomaly that had motivated him was a mysterious resistance among electrons to a process known as thermalization. He sought to understand more deeply when a system would or would not thermalize. He was not the first physicist to study this phenomenon, but the questions he raised in his work would capture the imaginations of a later generation of physicists.\n\n“It was 50 years ahead of its time,” said David Huse, a physicist at Princeton University.\n\nIn everyday language, thermalization is the natural tendency for systems to get mixed up. A new deck of cards quickly loses its original order. A sandcastle winds up as a wet lump of sand. In thermodynamics, this trend is a straightforward consequence of statistics. There are just a few ways to be ordered and a tremendous number of ways to be mixed up, so an initially ordered system is extremely likely to end up mixed.\n\nThe key feature of thermalization is that any initial patterns get wiped out by the mixing. Any initial hot spot or concentration of energy, for instance, spreads out until no further spreading is possible. At this point, the system becomes stable and stops noticeably changing — a scenario physicists refer to as thermal equilibrium.\n\nIn retrospect, physicists see that Anderson’s work contained the seeds of a rebellion against thermalization. He had shown that a disordered landscape could trap one particle. The key question became: Could it localize many particles? If particles became stuck in place, energy would not spread, and a system would never thermalize. As the opposite of thermalization, localization would represent a whole new type of stability, an unexpected way for quantum patterns of energy to persist forever.\n\n“Knowing whether thermalization is this universal thing that will happen in a closed system, or whether it can completely break down,” said Maissam Barkeshli, a physicist at the University of Maryland, “is one of the most fundamental questions in physics.”\n\nAnswering that question, however, would require solving a problem that made Anderson’s Nobel Prize-winning work seem like a warmup. The basic issue is that groups of particles can influence each other in colossally complex ways. Accounting for these interactions proved so complicated that nearly 50 years would elapse between Anderson’s 1958 paper and the first serious attempts to understand localization in many-particle systems, which physicists call many-body localization.\n\nThe unbelievable answer that would emerge, half a century later, was that thermalization is not always inevitable. In defiance of thermalization, many-body localization seemed possible.\n\n“It breaks the laws of thermodynamics,” said Wojciech De Roeck, a physicist at KU Leuven in Belgium. “It means that chaos does not always win.”\n\nThe Rise of Many-Body Localization\n\nThe blockbuster sequel to Anderson’s work came in 2005, when Denis Basko, Igor Aleiner and Boris Altshuler, physicists with affiliations at Princeton and Columbia universities, published a landmark paper that would make their initials instantly recognizable to researchers in the field. In it, BAA studied whether atomic impurities in a metal could localize electrons, trapping them near atoms and transforming the conducting material into an insulator.\n\nIn 88 pages of dense math comprising 173 numbered equations and 24 figures (excluding appendices), BAA showed that a messy material could indeed stop groups of electrons in their tracks, much as Anderson had shown that it could stop one particle. Their work effectively launched the study of many-body localization, or MBL.\n\n“It really was a tour de force,” Khemani said. “They showed that MBL is stable in all dimensions.” The work was also impenetrable. Researchers believed it but didn’t understand it well enough to build upon it. “Nobody could really do the BAA calculation other than them,” said Jed Pixley, a condensed matter physicist at Rutgers University.\n\nBut BAA’s finding did send ripples across the Princeton campus. Basko told his friend Vadim Oganesyan, who discussed it with his adviser, David Huse. The two of them were already running computer simulations that would allow them to test BAA’s ideas more directly in the more abstract context of thermalization.\n\nIn their simulations, Huse and Oganesyan set up chains of quantum particles that could point up or down and could flip their neighbors. When they added more and more disorder, as per the localization recipe, they saw signs that the chains of particles were switching from a thermalizing scenario (where, say, a rapidly flipping particle would spread its energy and start flipping its neighbors) to a nearly localized scenario (where the particle would hold onto its energy). The transition from thermalization to localization at a certain level of disorder looked rather like transitions between phases of matter, such as between liquid and ice, that occur at a certain temperature.\n\nCredit: Merrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine.\n\nCould MBL qualify as a phase of sorts? Phases hold a special status in physics. They also have a special definition. Crucially, a phase of matter must be stable for an infinitely long time period, and for an infinitely large system. If indeed there was a transition between thermalization and localization, and if localization occurred indefinitely for infinite systems, perhaps the two types of stability could be thought of as phases in their own right.\n\nOganesyan and Huse couldn’t simulate infinitely long chains for infinitely long times (they could do around a dozen particles), so they weren’t surprised that they saw imperfect signs of localization. But as they made their chains longer, the transition to localization got sharper. Their first work, posted in 2006, teased the intriguing possibility that for infinitely long chains with enough disorder, a localizing phase could exist.\n\nPerhaps more importantly, their simulations were easy to understand. “David made the calculation so anybody could do it,” Pixley said.\n\nSubsequent numerical studies supported the notion that a rugged landscape could localize energy, and physicists began to consider the implications. Deluges of energy, often in the form of heat, wipe out delicate phases of quantum matter. But if sufficiently jagged peaks could halt the spread of energy, quantum structures might survive at effectively any temperature. “You are able to obtain phenomena that we really associate and only understand at zero temperature,” said Anushya Chandran, a physicist at Boston University who studied MBL as a Princeton graduate student.\n\nOne high-profile quantum structure to grow out of MBL was a pattern in time. Flip one end of a chain of particles at a certain rate, and the entire chain could flip between two configurations without absorbing any of the energy from the flipping. These “time crystals” were an exotic out-of-equilibrium phase of matter, which was possible only because a sufficiently disordered landscape stopped any conceivable arrangement of particles from reaching thermal equilibrium.\n\n“There’s just no analogue,” said Khemani, who came through Princeton around this time and would go on to play a pioneering role in understanding and creating time crystals. “That’s a complete paradigm shift.”\n\nThe final piece of the theoretical puzzle fell into place in 2014, when John Imbrie, a mathematical physicist at the University of Virginia, showed that if you could string together an infinitely long chain of particles with enough disorder, any configuration would stay localized. Despite the ability of the particles to interact with their neighbors, they would individually continue to do their own thing forever.\n\nThe rigorous mathematical proof, the likes of which are rare in physics, was the result of five years of effort. It all but guaranteed that localization was possible, solidifying its status as a phase. “When you do a mathematical argument, you have to consider every possibility,” Imbrie said. “That’s part of the beauty.”\n\nAround the same time, physicists with labs specializing in manipulating cold atoms were confirming that real particles behaved in much the same way that digital ones did. Modest numbers of atoms separated by mountains of light spread out at a glacial pace, both when arranged in 1D lines and when arrayed in 2D grids..\n\nWith a preponderance of experimental, mathematical and numerical evidence, MBL seemed destined to enter the pantheon of phase transitions alongside magnetism and superconductivity. Physicists expected that a wide variety of different systems in different dimensions could flagrantly disregard their presumed thermodynamic fate.\n\nIn 2022, the American Physical Society awarded Altshuler, Huse and Aleiner the prestigious Lars Onsager Prize, named for the mathematical physicist who proved that a cartoon model captured the phase transition as a material became magnetized.\n\nBut even before the prizes were given out, the idea of infinitely durable structures had begun to fall apart.\n\nThe Start of the Wobble\n\nThe first tremor came about a year and a half after Imbrie’s proof.\n\nRecall that the transition from thermalization to localization is thought to go down like transitions between familiar phases of matter. When metal magnetizes, for instance, certain properties change at particular rates, described by meticulously calculated equations. Particular values in these equations have certain exponents, like the 2 in x2.\n\nFor a true phase transition in one dimension, mathematicians had proved that two of these exponents must be greater than 2. But the MBL simulations had found them to be 1 — a major disagreement. In a still-unpublished preprint posted in 2015, Oganesyan and Chandran, together with Christopher Laumann of Boston University, showed that the mismatch was not just a trivial side effect of studying short chains rather than infinite ones. Something more fundamental seemed off.\n\n“They looked into it carefully,” Huse said. “But we couldn’t figure out what was wrong.”\n\nA string of bigger shocks came over the next few years. Imagine the kind of mountainous landscape that would lead to MBL. Now extend that landscape to infinity in all directions. If you randomly explore enough of it, at some point you’re bound to run into an extended flat patch.\n\nParticles in a flat zone can easily find states of similar energy to tunnel to, so they mingle and thermalize. In such a region, energy states abound, increasing the odds that a particle in the neighboring mountains could make contact and become thermalized itself, argued De Roeck of KU Leuven and François Huveneers, who was then at the University of Paris-Dauphine in France. Thus, the flat zone can serve as a source of thermalizing energy.\n\nBut could such a tiny patch take down the whole system? The scenario intuitively seemed about as plausible as a hot tub in Denver causing meltdowns in Vail, Breckenridge and Telluride. Physicists didn’t accept it right away. When De Roeck and Huveneers raised the possibility at conferences, their talks provoked angry outbursts from the audience.\n\n“It was a big surprise,” De Roeck said. “A lot of people in the beginning did not believe us.”\n\nIn a series of papers starting in 2016, De Roeck, Huveneers and collaborators laid out their case for a process now known as an avalanche. They argued that, unlike a hot tub, what starts as a drop of thermalized particles can snowball into an ocean.\n\n“You have a heat bath, and it recruits neighboring sites into the heat bath,” Imbrie said. “It gets stronger and stronger and pulls in more and more sites. That’s the avalanche.”\n\nThe crucial question was whether an avalanche would gain momentum or lose it. With each step, the heat bath would indeed become a bigger and better energy reservoir. But each step also made thermalizing the next site harder. Reminiscent of Anderson’s single-particle localization, the debate came down to a race between two effects: the bath’s improvement versus its difficulty in growing further.\n\nDe Roeck and Huveneers argued that avalanches would win in two and three dimensions, because they stockpiled energy states incredibly quickly — at rates related to their rapidly growing area (in 2D) or volume (in 3D). Most physicists came to accept that avalanches in these landscapes were unstoppable, making MBL a remote prospect in sheets or bricks.\n\nBut the possibility of MBL in one-dimensional chains survived, because an avalanche sweeping across a line accrues energy states more slowly. In fact, the heat bath grows more powerful at about the same rate at which the difficulty of growth rises. It was a tie. Avalanches might continue in 1D, or they might stop.\n\nOther physicists, meanwhile, grew skeptical that MBL could exist even in a 1D chain. In 2019, a team of Slovenian chaos experts including Tomaž Prosen reanalyzed old numerical data and highlighted the fact that as the landscape got more mountainous, thermalization slowed tremendously but never completely stopped — an inconvenient truth MBL researchers had taken to be an artifact of their small-scale simulations. Anatoli Polkovnikov of Boston University and Dries Sels, now of New York University and the Flatiron Institute, among other researchers, came to similar conclusions. Their arguments directly challenged the central allure of MBL: the promise of eternal life for a quantum sandcastle.\n\n“At the level of theorists talking about MBL,” Chandran said, “there’s an honest-to-God regime where [the thermalization time] is not just age of the universe, and we can’t see it. No, it’s truly infinite.”\n\nA vigorous debate followed, both in the academic literature and in private discussions. Sels and Huse spent hours on Zoom during the depths of the pandemic. They talked past each other at times, but each credits the other with productive insights. The ins and outs of the controversy are extremely technical, and not even the researchers involved can fully articulate all the perspectives. But ultimately, their differences come down to each camp making a different educated — extremely educated — guess as to what you would see if you could watch a chain of particles flip forever.\n\nThe two sides still disagree about whether a genuine MBL phase exists in one dimension, but one concrete result of the clash is that it drove researchers to scrutinize the effect that avalanches might have on the presumed onset of MBL.\n\nThe skeptical groups “had some very good points, but they took them a little too far,” Huse said. “It really got us motivated.”\n\nHuse, collaborating with a team of MBL veterans including Khemani, cooked up a way to simulate the effect of an avalanche on short chains without actually triggering one. (No one has seen an avalanche, even numerically, because to get a big enough flat spot you might need a chain billions of particles long, Sels estimates, and researchers typically study chains of about 12.) Sels subsequently developed his own avalanche mock-up.\n\nThe two groups came to similar conclusions in 2021: The MBL transition, if it existed, required a much more mountainous landscape than researchers had believed. With the ruggedness level previously thought to bring about MBL, thermalization would slow, but would not stop. To give quantum snowmen a fighting chance against avalanches, the landscape would have to be more disordered than Huse and company had suspected. Huse’s group initially found that the mountains would need to be least twice as rugged. Sels’ work pushed that number up to at least six times as rugged, making the mountains more like Himalayas than Rockies. MBL may still occur in those extreme settings, but the theory that had been built around the less rugged transition did indeed have problems.\n\n“We sort of accepted it too thoroughly, and we didn’t look at the subtleties of it,” Huse said.\n\nIn the 2021 works, the researchers rewrote and expanded the MBL phase diagram for 1D chains. In Kansas-like flatlands, particles thermalize quickly. In the Rockies, the researchers reclassified the MBL “phase” as a “pre-thermal regime.” This is the seemingly stable regime discovered by BAA, the Princeton simulations, and atomic experiments. But now the researchers had concluded that if one waited an extremely long time — literally billions of years for some setups — particles separated by the Rockies would in fact mingle and thermalize.\n\nBeyond the Rockies lie the Himalayas. What happens there remains an open question. Sels and Prosen are convinced that energy will spread and thermalization will eventually occur, even if it takes eons. Huse and company continue to believe that genuine MBL sets in.\n\nChief among their reasons for belief in MBL is the 2014 proof. Of the once numerous pillars of evidence supporting the existence of true MBL, Imbrie’s proof is the last one standing. And after a career developing bespoke mathematical tools for just this type of problem, he stands by it.\n\n“It’s not unheard of in mathematics to have an error in a proof,” he said, “but I think I know what I’m doing.”\n\nThe proof divides physicists, however, because physicists don’t understand it. It isn’t for lack of trying. Laumann once got Imbrie to teach the proof to him and a handful of researchers over the course of a week in Italy, but they couldn’t follow the steps in detail. That’s not entirely surprising, though, as physicists typically use mathematics in a faster and looser way than mathematicians do. Imbrie’s argument doesn’t depend on any specific level of ruggedness in the landscape, so the recent revisions to the MBL phase diagram in no way undermine it. To determine whether MBL truly exists, researchers will need to buckle down and either find a problem in the proof or verify every line.\n\nSuch efforts are underway. Sels and collaborators say they’re finalizing an argument that will contradict Imbrie’s. Meanwhile, De Roeck and Huveneers, the mathematicians who discovered the threat of avalanches, are two years into an effort to rewrite Imbrie’s proof in a more accessible form. De Roeck says they’ve put all the major pieces in place, and so far the logic looks solid.\n\n“MBL, I believe it exists,” De Roeck said. But “we’re doing mathematics here, so any small problem can derail the whole thing.”\n\nBeyond Quantum Angels\n\nIn the universe we inhabit, which will itself thermalize in some incomprehensible number of years, permanence is always something of an illusion. Manhattan is sinking under its own weight at 1.6 centimeters per decade. The continents will merge in roughly 250 million years. And while it’s a myth that the bottoms of medieval stained-glass windows have thickened slightly over the centuries, physicists do believe that glass flows over some unknown timescale, likely many billions of years or more.\n\nIf MBL proves unstable, a many-body localized system will be at least as durable as any of these examples. So will those quantum phenomena that depend on MBL states. Time crystals, for instance, might lose their textbook designations as “phases of matter,” but they’d still be able to keep ticking for far, far longer than the quantum computers that simulate them (or the humans that operate the computers, for that matter). Many academics do care deeply about the mathematical possibility of defeating thermalization as the beautiful, academic question that it is. But these days, most aren’t losing much sleep over it.\n\n“Maybe it was always angels dancing on the head of a pin,” Chandran said.\n\nInstead, Chandran and others have reveled in the chance to discover a new thermalization-causing phenomenon, one that physicists might actually observe in small systems.\n\nBack in 2018, she and her collaborator Philip Crowley had set out to understand why small chains appeared to slowly thermalize even though they were far too small for flat spots to crop up. The duo determined that groups of particles were occasionally getting lucky and borrowing energy from a neighboring group in the exact amount they needed to flip to a new configuration. They dubbed these coincidences “resonances” and observed how they tended to spread from group to group, leading to a drawn-out thermalization in systems too small for avalanches. In 2020, they showed that resonances can explain the 2015 exponent mismatch and many of the fishy features that have been showing up in numerical experiments, insights that helped Huse and company update the phase diagram for short chains in 2021.\n\nToday, physicists believe that resonances destabilize modest chains with Rockies-level disorder, while avalanches destabilize longer chains at higher levels of disorder.\n\nAs Chandran and others improve their simulations and experiments and explore longer, more rugged chains, they wonder what else might lurk in the Himalayas and beyond.\n\n“It seems like there is other physics going on in there,” Huse said. “That would be nicest for me. I like finding new things.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

Why Quanta? Albert Einstein called photons “quanta of light.” Our goal is to “illuminate science.” At Quanta Magazine, scientific accuracy is every bit as important as telling a good story. All of our articles are meticulously researched, reported, edited, copy-edited and fact-checked.\n\nFrom Quanta Magazine\n\nAnd\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n\n2.12.24\n\nMichael Greshko\n\nErin Kara studies the supermassive black holes that pin galaxies to the fabric of the cosmos. Credit: Katherine Taylor for Quanta Magazine.\n\nUnlike many astronomers, Erin Kara didn’t grow up star-struck. “I don’t have that story of being that little kid staring up at the stars and wanting to do this, which gave me some anxiety,” she said. “Did that make me a fake?”\n\nBut after discovering astrophysics as an undergraduate, Kara was hooked. Now an observational astrophysicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she visits mind-bending territory. Like an astronaut in the film Interstellar, she explores the regions near gargantuan black holes. Her goal is to better understand how those black holes behave and how they continually reshape galaxies across the universe.\n\nPacked with mass equal to millions or billions of suns, supermassive black holes lurk at the center of nearly every galaxy. Energetically, these black holes are like galaxies’ dark, beating hearts.\n\n“They’re not just ornamental. They’re not just sitting there passively,” Kara said. “They’re actually dictating how the galaxy evolves and why the galaxy looks the way that it does.”\n\nKara tries to understand the environment near these black holes, where most of their energy is released. By carefully tracking the gas and plasma that swirls near a black hole — forming what’s known as an accretion disk — she can approximate the black hole’s mass, for example. That nearby gas and plasma can also help reveal how feasting black holes create extreme cosmic structures such as relativistic jets — gigantic beams of superheated plasma accelerated to nearly the speed of light.\n\nHow a New X-Ray Technique Sees Black Holes.\n\nBut there’s a huge problem that Kara and other researchers must overcome: These target black holes are so far away that conventional imaging techniques can’t resolve their immediate surroundings. To reconstruct the immediate environment around a black hole, Kara turns to the X-ray light given off by the accretion disk. She measures subtle delays in when that light reaches Earth. By doing so, she can infer the structure of the gas and plasma with remarkable resolution. Kara’s work on this method — called reverberation mapping — has exposed black holes’ feeding frenzies in unprecedented detail, with findings that include the first X-ray “echoes” ever seen from a black hole shredding a star. Kara received the American Astronomical Society’s 2022 Newton Lacy Pierce Prize, which recognizes outstanding achievements in observational astronomy over the preceding five years.\n\nQuanta Magazine recently spoke with Kara about her path into science, the nuts and bolts of reverberation mapping, and the black holes that keep her up at night. The interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\n________________________________\n\nYou spend a lot of time thinking about black holes, to the point where you have even converted simulations of them into sounds. Many people think of black holes as “weird” or “spooky” or “eerie.” Do you buy that characterization?\n\nThere’s this stereotype that black holes are nasty things that we should all be afraid of, but what’s amazing is that black holes actually give us life, if you want to take it to that level of abstraction. The reason we’re all here is that the gas in our galaxy is distributed such that stars could form, which eventually led to the planet that we live on. This was, in some ways, dictated by our galaxy’s central black hole.\n\nBlack holes aren’t, like, a demise and the end of everything. They’re actually, in some ways, a beginning.\n\nKara and MIT research staffer Beverly LaMarr.\n\nAt the big-picture level, what are the questions about black holes that you’re most interested in addressing?\n\nIf you understand how gas flows behave in the strongly curved space-time around a black hole, then you can use that information to measure the fundamental properties of the black hole: its mass and its spin, a measure of how fast it’s rotating.\n\nCould you describe the general setting of the black holes you’re looking at?\n\nThey’re all surrounded by disks of gas and dust. These accretion disks can get hot enough on their own to emit optical and ultraviolet radiation, but they’re not hot enough to create X-rays. What we see with our telescopes is that accreting black holes — which are in the process of consuming those disks — always produce X-rays. If you see X-rays from a billion light-years away, it’s probably from an accreting supermassive black hole.\n\nHow are the black holes creating those X-rays?\n\nWe know that there must be some really high-energy plasma around the black hole that’s creating these X-ray photons. We call that the corona — like the hot plasma that’s around the sun. A black hole’s corona is like the crown on top of the accretion disk. It can get extremely hot, and it produces a lot of X-rays. The material in the accretion disk is about a million kelvins, but the corona is a billion kelvins. We don’t actually know a lot about this corona, and one of the big questions is: How does it form? What’s its geometry?\n\nTo map the darkest of galactic hearts, Kara uses the X-rays produced by the maelstrom of matter surrounding black holes. Credit: Katherine Taylor for Quanta Magazine.\n\nSo how can the technique you use, reverberation mapping, go from collecting X-rays to revealing the corona and its surroundings?\n\nYou have this corona around a black hole, as well as an accretion disk. And as the corona irradiates that colder accretion disk with X-rays, it causes ions in the disk to radiate X-rays of their own, mainly through fluorescence.\n\nFundamentally, these secondary X-rays are like echoes of light, so we call them reverberation echoes. What we’re doing is measuring time delays between a primary flash of X-ray light from the corona and the corresponding echoes from the accretion disk. If we can measure those echoes, then we can reconstruct what it looks like around the black hole.\n\nIt’s akin to how bats use echolocation. They can’t see the dark cave that they’re flying through, but they know that the echo will come back at them with some delay, and they can use the fact that the echo is traveling at the speed of sound to map out the dark cave. We’re doing that, except with light traveling at the speed of light.\n\nI was about to say, the walls around a bat are not moving at relativistic speeds, so I imagine that things are a little bit dicier when you’re doing this.\n\n[Laughs.] It’s a little bit more complicated than that, just slightly …\n\nWhat does it take, then, to go from your data — X-ray photons in a bucket — to a map of the region around a black hole?\n\nOriginally, we were just looking for a range of X-ray wavelengths that we knew was dominated by emission from the corona, and a range that we knew was dominated by that echo. We found that if you converted the time delay between those ranges into a distance for light to travel, it roughly corresponded to mapping the gas flows very close to the black hole — something within a few times the event horizon’s radius.\n\nNow we try to create many different simulations of corona-accretion disk systems and then identify the ones that look like the data that we see. We do this with what are called general relativistic ray-tracing simulations. Ray-tracing simulations are used in all sorts of video games, and it’s the same kind of principle: We take a point that’s a model for the corona, we shine light rays from it in all different directions, and we just follow where those light rays go. Some of them will go to a distant observer, and some of them will fall into the disk, irradiate the disk, and then bounce off and reflect into the plane of the telescope.\n\nHow does reverberation mapping differ from, say, what the Event Horizon Telescope did to obtain direct images of black holes?\n\nThe Event Horizon Telescope has been just amazing for imaging the black holes at the center of our galaxy and Messier 87, but it really can only do those two black holes. More than that, if we want to get at the question of how black holes grow, we need to look at black holes that are actively growing right now — or rather, black holes that are extremely luminous in X-rays.\n\nThe black hole at the center of our galaxy must have had this phase where it was actively growing and eating a lot of material. Right now, it’s not doing that — and it’s precisely because it’s not growing very much that the Event Horizon Telescope can image it directly. To study those black holes that are actively growing, where there’s high-density material rushing toward the black hole, we need another technique. And that’s where reverberation mapping comes in.\n\nAre there any specific black holes that you’ve looked at that stand out to you as particularly informative?\n\nMy general research tactic is to find black holes that behave in a way we kind of expect. If you can understand the details of those systems, and you can really cleanly trace the geometry around the black hole, then you can make precision measurements of the mass and the spin of the black hole.\n\nOne of my favorites right now is an X-ray binary called MAXI J1820+070. It’s not a supermassive black hole; it’s just 10 times the mass of the sun. It’s in a companion system with a star, and it’s pulling gas off of that star and forming an accretion disk and a corona. It’s just a very clean system, and it’s so close to Earth: It’s about a thousand times brighter for us than these supermassive black holes.\n\nAnd on the flip side, which black holes stand out to you as particularly extreme or particularly weird?\n\nI like to study the normal guys, and then I like to crank things up and see where things break. What’s also really fun are the oddball systems that just keep you up at night wondering: How the heck did nature let that happen? And the source that has kept me up at night is called ASASSN-18el, which is a supermassive black hole.\n\nASASSN-18el was found by the ASAS-SN all-sky survey as one of these black holes that were kind of normal-looking and then, all of a sudden, went into this crazy outburst.\n\nWe started observing it with optical, UV, and lots of X-ray observations as well, and it just went totally bananas. It had these initial outbursts, and then it turned off — like, a four-orders-of-magnitude decrease in luminosity. And then it turned back on again and became the brightest X-ray source in the extragalactic sky for about a year, and then it began to turn off again. Now it looks like it may be turning back on.\n\nWe thought that the timescale for something to turn off by four orders of magnitude would be at least millions of years. And yet we saw it happen in a year — or in a few months. How does something like that happen?\n\nHistorically, what we knew about these accreting supermassive black holes — called active galactic nuclei — we learned from surveys where we’d look at them every once in a while. But now we have these all-sky surveys that are scanning the sky a couple of times a week, and we’re just staring at these black holes, seeing what they do. And it turns out that when we weren’t looking at them, they were doing all sorts of crazy things. Now we’re just finally realizing it.\n\nWhat motivated you to get into astronomy and study black holes, and what keeps you inspired today?\n\nThe thing that really got me excited about pursuing astronomy was the discovery aspect: It was just super thrilling to be the first person to look at light that was released from around a black hole a billion years ago. That’s amazing. How is it that we puny human beings can even think about these things, or come together to build technologies to answer some of these huge fundamental questions that people have been asking since the beginning of human thinking?\n\nAnd I love the community aspect of bringing people together for a common goal. We have this idea about what “science” is — that you were, like, sitting by yourself and inspired by your own creative genius, and you made all of these discoveries on your own. But that’s not what’s super inspiring about it. To me, it’s that we are able to work together and use each other’s expertise to create something so much bigger than any of us.\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.

The institute has an urban campus that extends more than a mile (1.6 km) alongside the Charles River. The institute also encompasses a number of major off-campus facilities such as the MIT Lincoln Laboratory , the MIT Bates Research and Engineering Center , and the Haystack Observatory , as well as affiliated laboratories such as the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard and Whitehead Institute.\n\nFounded in 1861 in response to the increasing industrialization of the United States, Massachusetts Institute of Technology adopted a European polytechnic university model and stressed laboratory instruction in applied science and engineering. It has since played a key role in the development of many aspects of modern science, engineering, mathematics, and technology, and is widely known for its innovation and academic strength. It is frequently regarded as one of the most prestigious universities in the world.\n\nNobel laureates, Turing Award winners, and Fields Medalists have been affiliated with MIT as alumni, faculty members, or researchers. In addition, National Medal of Science recipients, National Medals of Technology and Innovation recipients, MacArthur Fellows, Marshall Scholars, Mitchell Scholars, Schwarzman Scholars, astronauts, and Chief Scientists of the U.S. Air Force have been affiliated with The Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The university also has a strong entrepreneurial culture and MIT alumni have founded or co-founded many notable companies. Massachusetts Institute of Technology is a member of the Association of American Universities.\n\nFoundation and vision\n\nIn 1859, a proposal was submitted to the Massachusetts General Court to use newly filled lands in Back Bay, Boston for a “Conservatory of Art and Science”, but the proposal failed. A charter for the incorporation of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, proposed by William Barton Rogers, was signed by John Albion Andrew, the governor of Massachusetts, on April 10, 1861.\n\nRogers, a professor from the University of Virginia , wanted to establish an institution to address rapid scientific and technological advances. He did not wish to found a professional school, but a combination with elements of both professional and liberal education, proposing that:\n\n“The true and only practicable object of a polytechnic school is, as I conceive, the teaching, not of the minute details and manipulations of the arts, which can be done only in the workshop, but the inculcation of those scientific principles which form the basis and explanation of them, and along with this, a full and methodical review of all their leading processes and operations in connection with physical laws.”\n\nThe Rogers Plan reflected the German research university model, emphasizing an independent faculty engaged in research, as well as instruction oriented around seminars and laboratories.\n\nEarly developments\n\nTwo days after The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was chartered, the first battle of the Civil War broke out. After a long delay through the war years, MIT’s first classes were held in the Mercantile Building in Boston in 1865. The new institute was founded as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to fund institutions “to promote the liberal and practical education of the industrial classes” and was a land-grant school. In 1863 under the same act, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts founded the Massachusetts Agricultural College, which developed as the University of Massachusetts- Amherst ). In 1866, the proceeds from land sales went toward new buildings in the Back Bay.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was informally called “Boston Tech”. The institute adopted the European polytechnic university model and emphasized laboratory instruction from an early date. Despite chronic financial problems, the institute saw growth in the last two decades of the 19th century under President Francis Amasa Walker. Programs in electrical, chemical, marine, and sanitary engineering were introduced, new buildings were built, and the size of the student body increased to more than one thousand.\n\nThe curriculum drifted to a vocational emphasis, with less focus on theoretical science. The fledgling school still suffered from chronic financial shortages which diverted the attention of the MIT leadership. During these “Boston Tech” years, Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty and alumni rebuffed Harvard University president (and former MIT faculty) Charles W. Eliot’s repeated attempts to merge MIT with Harvard College’s Lawrence Scientific School. There would be at least six attempts to absorb MIT into Harvard. In its cramped Back Bay location, MIT could not afford to expand its overcrowded facilities, driving a desperate search for a new campus and funding. Eventually, the MIT Corporation approved a formal agreement to merge with Harvard, over the vehement objections of MIT faculty, students, and alumni. However, a 1917 decision by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court effectively put an end to the merger scheme.\n\nIn 1916, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology administration and the MIT charter crossed the Charles River on the ceremonial barge Bucentaur built for the occasion, to signify MIT’s move to a spacious new campus largely consisting of filled land on a one-mile-long (1.6 km) tract along the Cambridge side of the Charles River. The neoclassical “New Technology” campus was designed by William W. Bosworth and had been funded largely by anonymous donations from a mysterious “Mr. Smith”, starting in 1912. In January 1920, the donor was revealed to be the industrialist George Eastman of Rochester, New York, who had invented methods of film production and processing, and founded Eastman Kodak. Between 1912 and 1920, Eastman donated $20 million ($236.6 million in 2015 dollars) in cash and Kodak stock to MIT.\n\nCurricular reforms\n\nIn the 1930s, President Karl Taylor Compton and Vice-President (effectively Provost) Vannevar Bush emphasized the importance of pure sciences like physics and chemistry and reduced the vocational practice required in shops and drafting studios. The Compton reforms “renewed confidence in the ability of the Institute to develop leadership in science as well as in engineering”. Unlike Ivy League schools, Massachusetts Institute of Technology catered more to middle-class families, and depended more on tuition than on endowments or grants for its funding. The school was elected to the Association of American Universities in 1934.\n\nStill, as late as 1949, the Lewis Committee lamented in its report on the state of education at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology that “the Institute is widely conceived as basically a vocational school”, a “partly unjustified” perception the committee sought to change. The report comprehensively reviewed the undergraduate curriculum, recommended offering a broader education, and warned against letting engineering and government-sponsored research detract from the sciences and humanities. The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences and the MIT Sloan School of Management were formed in 1950 to compete with the powerful Schools of Science and Engineering. Previously marginalized faculties in the areas of economics, management, political science, and linguistics emerged into cohesive and assertive departments by attracting respected professors and launching competitive graduate programs. The School of Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences continued to develop under the successive terms of the more humanistically oriented presidents Howard W. Johnson and Jerome Wiesner between 1966 and 1980.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology‘s involvement in military science surged during World War II. In 1941, Vannevar Bush was appointed head of the federal Office of Scientific Research and Development and directed funding to only a select group of universities, including MIT. Engineers and scientists from across the country gathered at Massachusetts Institute of Technology ‘s Radiation Laboratory [now The Lincoln Laboratory], established in 1940 to assist the British military in developing microwave radar. The work done there significantly affected both the war and subsequent research in the area. Other defense projects included gyroscope-based and other complex control systems for gunsight, bombsight, and inertial navigation under Charles Stark Draper’s Instrumentation Laboratory; the development of a digital computer for flight simulations under Project Whirlwind; and high-speed and high-altitude photography under Harold Edgerton. By the end of the war, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology became the nation’s largest wartime R&D contractor (attracting some criticism of Bush), employing nearly 4000 in the Radiation Laboratory alone and receiving in excess of $100 million ($1.2 billion in 2015 dollars) before 1946. Work on defense projects continued even after then. Post-war government-sponsored research at MIT included SAGE and guidance systems for ballistic missiles and Project Apollo.\n\nThese activities affected The Massachusetts Institute of Technology profoundly. A 1949 report noted the lack of “any great slackening in the pace of life at the Institute” to match the return to peacetime, remembering the “academic tranquility of the prewar years”, though acknowledging the significant contributions of military research to the increased emphasis on graduate education and rapid growth of personnel and facilities. The faculty doubled and the graduate student body quintupled during the terms of Karl Taylor Compton, president of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology between 1930 and 1948; James Rhyne Killian, president from 1948 to 1957; and Julius Adams Stratton, chancellor from 1952 to 1957, whose institution-building strategies shaped the expanding university. By the 1950s, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology no longer simply benefited the industries with which it had worked for three decades, and it had developed closer working relationships with new patrons, philanthropic foundations and the federal government.\n\nIn late 1960s and early 1970s, student and faculty activists protested against the Vietnam War and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ‘s defense research. In this period Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s various departments were researching helicopters, smart bombs and counterinsurgency techniques for the war in Vietnam as well as guidance systems for nuclear missiles. The Union of Concerned Scientists was founded on March 4, 1969 during a meeting of faculty members and students seeking to shift the emphasis on military research toward environmental and social problems. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology ultimately divested itself from the Instrumentation Laboratory and moved all classified research off-campus to the MIT Lincoln Laboratory facility in 1973 in response to the protests. The student body, faculty, and administration remained comparatively unpolarized during what was a tumultuous time for many other universities. Johnson was seen to be highly successful in leading his institution to “greater strength and unity” after these times of turmoil. However, six Massachusetts Institute of Technology students were sentenced to prison terms at this time and some former student leaders, such as Michael Albert and George Katsiaficas, are still indignant about MIT’s role in military research and its suppression of these protests. (Richard Leacock’s film, November Actions, records some of these tumultuous events.)\n\nIn the 1980s, there was more controversy at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology over its involvement in SDI (space weaponry) and CBW (chemical and biological warfare) research. More recently, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s research for the military has included work on robots, drones and ‘battle suits’.\n\nRecent history\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has kept pace with and helped to advance the digital age. In addition to developing the predecessors to modern computing and networking technologies, students, staff, and faculty members at Project MAC, the Artificial Intelligence Laboratory [now the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory], and the Tech Model Railroad Club wrote some of the earliest interactive computer video games like Spacewar! and created much of modern hacker slang and culture. Several major computer-related organizations have originated at MIT since the 1980s: Richard Stallman’s GNU Project and the subsequent Free Software Foundation were founded in the mid-1980s at the AI Lab; the MIT Media Lab was founded in 1985 by Nicholas Negroponte and Jerome Wiesner to promote research into novel uses of computer technology; the World Wide Web Consortium standards organization was founded at the Laboratory for Computer Science in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee; the MIT OpenCourseWare project has made course materials for over 2,000 Massachusetts Institute of Technology classes available online free of charge since 2002; and the One Laptop per Child initiative to expand computer education and connectivity to children worldwide was launched in 2005.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology was named a sea-grant college in 1976 to support its programs in oceanography and marine sciences and was named a space-grant college in 1989 to support its aeronautics and astronautics programs. Despite diminishing government financial support over the past quarter century, MIT launched several successful development campaigns to significantly expand the campus: new dormitories and athletics buildings on west campus; the Tang Center for Management Education; several buildings in the northeast corner of campus supporting research into biology, brain and cognitive sciences, genomics, biotechnology, and cancer research; and a number of new “backlot” buildings on Vassar Street including the Stata Center. Construction on campus in the 2000s included expansions of the Media Lab, the Sloan School’s eastern campus, and graduate residences in the northwest. In 2006, President Hockfield launched the MIT Energy Research Council [now the MIT Energy Initiative] to investigate the interdisciplinary challenges posed by increasing global energy consumption.\n\nIn 2001, inspired by the open source and open access movements, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology launched “OpenCourseWare” to make the lecture notes, problem sets, syllabi, exams, and lectures from the great majority of its courses available online for no charge, though without any formal accreditation for coursework completed. While the cost of supporting and hosting the project is high, OCW expanded in 2005 to include other universities as a part of the OpenCourseWare Consortium, which currently includes more than 250 academic institutions with content available in at least six languages. In 2011, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced it would offer formal certification (but not credits or degrees) to online participants completing coursework in its “MITx” program, for a modest fee. The “edX” online platform supporting MITx was initially developed in partnership with Harvard and its analogous “Harvardx” initiative. The courseware platform is open source, and other universities have already joined and added their own course content. In March 2009 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.\n\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology has its own police force. Three days after the Boston Marathon bombing of April 2013, MIT Police patrol officer Sean Collier was fatally shot by the suspects Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, setting off a violent manhunt that shut down the campus and much of the Boston metropolitan area for a day. One week later, Collier’s memorial service was attended by more than 10,000 people, in a ceremony hosted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology community with thousands of police officers from the New England region and Canada. On November 25, 2013, The Massachusetts Institute of Technology announced the creation of the Collier Medal, to be awarded annually to “an individual or group that embodies the character and qualities that Officer Collier exhibited as a member of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology community and in all aspects of his life”. The announcement further stated that “Future recipients of the award will include those whose contributions exceed the boundaries of their profession, those who have contributed to building bridges across the community, and those who consistently and selflessly perform acts of kindness”.\n\nIn September 2017, the school announced the creation of an artificial intelligence research lab called the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab. IBM will spend $240 million over the next decade, and the lab will be staffed by MIT and IBM scientists. In October 2018 MIT announced that it would open the new Schwarzman College of Computing dedicated to the study of artificial intelligence, named after lead donor and The Blackstone Group CEO Stephen Schwarzman. The focus of the new college is to study not just AI, but interdisciplinary AI education, and how AI can be used in fields as diverse as history and biology. The cost of buildings and new faculty for the new college is expected to be $1 billion upon completion.\n\nThe Caltech/MIT Advanced aLIGO was designed and constructed by a team of scientists from California Institute of Technology , Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and industrial contractors, and funded by the National Science Foundation .\n\nCaltech /MIT Advanced aLigo\n\nIt was designed to open the field of gravitational-wave astronomy through the detection of gravitational waves predicted by general relativity. Gravitational waves were detected for the first time by the LIGO detector in 2015. For contributions to the LIGO detector and the observation of gravitational waves, two Caltech physicists, Kip Thorne and Barry Barish, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology physicist Rainer Weiss won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2017. Weiss, who is also a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate, designed the laser interferometric technique, which served as the essential blueprint for the LIGO.\n\nThe mission of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is to advance knowledge and educate students in science, technology, and other areas of scholarship that will best serve the nation and the world in the twenty-first century. We seek to develop in each member of The Massachusetts Institute of Technology community the ability and passion to work wisely, creatively, and effectively for the betterment of humankind.\n\nFormerly known as Simons Science News, Quanta Magazine is an editorially independent online publication launched by the Simons Foundation to enhance public understanding of science. Why Quanta? Albert Einstein called photons “quanta of light.” Our goal is to “illuminate science.” At Quanta Magazine, scientific accuracy is every bit as important as telling a good story. All of our articles are meticulously researched, reported, edited, copy-edited and fact-checked.\n\nFrom Quanta Magazine\n\n2.23.24\n\nBen Brubaker\n\nSamuel Velasco/Quanta Magazine.\n\nIf you want to tile a bathroom floor, square tiles are the simplest option — they fit together without any gaps in a grid pattern that can continue indefinitely. That square grid has a property shared by many other tilings: Shift the whole grid over by a fixed amount, and the resulting pattern is indistinguishable from the original. But to many mathematicians, such “periodic” tilings are boring. If you’ve seen one small patch, you’ve seen it all.\n\nIn the 1960s, mathematicians began to study “aperiodic” tile sets with far richer behavior. Perhaps the most famous is a pair of diamond-shaped tiles discovered in the 1970s by the polymathic physicist and future Nobel laureate Roger Penrose. Copies of these two tiles can form infinitely many different patterns that go on forever, called Penrose tilings. Yet no matter how you arrange the tiles, you’ll never get a periodic repeating pattern.\n\n“These are tilings that shouldn’t really exist,” said Nikolas Breuckmann, a physicist at the University of Bristol.\n\nFor over half a century, aperiodic tilings have fascinated mathematicians, hobbyists and researchers in many other fields. Now, two physicists have discovered a connection between aperiodic tilings and a seemingly unrelated branch of computer science: the study of how future quantum computers can encode information to shield it from errors. In a paper posted to the preprint server arxiv.org in November, the researchers showed how to transform Penrose tilings into an entirely new type of quantum error-correcting code. They also constructed similar codes based on two other kinds of aperiodic tiling.\n\nAt the heart of the correspondence is a simple observation: In both aperiodic tilings and quantum error-correcting codes, learning about a small part of a large system reveals nothing about the system as a whole.\n\n“It’s one of those beautiful things that seems obvious in retrospect,” said Toby Cubitt, a quantum information researcher at University College London. “You’re like, ‘Why didn’t I think of that?’”\n\nForbidden Knowledge\n\nOrdinary computers represent information using bits with two distinct states, labeled 0 and 1. Quantum bits, or qubits, likewise have two states, but they can also be coaxed into so-called superpositions in which their 0 and 1 states coexist. By harnessing more elaborate superpositions involving many qubits, quantum computers can perform certain computations much faster than any conventional machine.\n\nYet quantum superpositions are skittish creatures. Measure a qubit in a superposition state and it will collapse to either 0 or 1, wiping out any computation in progress. To make matters worse, errors stemming from feeble interactions between qubits and their environment can mimic the destructive effects of measurement. Anything that rubs a qubit the wrong way, whether it’s a nosy researcher or a stray photon, can spoil the computation.\n\nRoger Penrose discovered a pair of diamond-shaped tiles that can only form non-repeating patterns, seen here under his feet.

But in 1995, the applied mathematician Peter Shor discovered a clever way to store quantum information. His encoding had two key properties. First, it could tolerate errors that only affected individual qubits. Second, it came with a procedure for correcting errors as they occurred, preventing them from piling up and derailing a computation. Shor’s discovery was the first example of a quantum error-correcting code, and its two key properties are the defining features of all such codes.\n\nThe first property stems from a simple principle: Secret information is less vulnerable when it’s divided up. Spy networks employ a similar strategy. Each spy knows very little about the network as a whole, so the organization remains safe even if any individual is captured. But quantum error-correcting codes take this logic to the extreme. In a quantum spy network, no single spy would know anything at all, yet together they’d know a lot.\n\nEach quantum error-correcting code is a specific recipe for distributing quantum information across many qubits in a collective superposition state. This procedure effectively transforms a cluster of physical qubits into a single virtual qubit. Repeat the process many times with a large array of qubits, and you’ll get many virtual qubits that you can use to perform computations.\n\nThe physical qubits that make up each virtual qubit are like those oblivious quantum spies. Measure any one of them, and you’ll learn nothing about the state of the virtual qubit it’s a part of — a property called local indistinguishability. Since each physical qubit encodes no information, errors in single qubits won’t ruin a computation. The information that matters is somehow everywhere, yet nowhere in particular.\n\n“You can’t pin it down to any individual qubit,” Cubitt said.\n\nAll quantum error-correcting codes can absorb at least one error without any effect on the encoded information, but they will all eventually succumb as errors accumulate. That’s where the second property of quantum error-correcting codes kicks in — the actual error correction. This is closely related to local indistinguishability: Because errors in individual qubits don’t destroy any information, it’s always possible to reverse any error using established procedures specific to each code.\n\nTaken for a Ride\n\nZhi Li, a postdoc at the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo, Canada, was well versed in the theory of quantum error correction. But the subject was far from his mind when he struck up a conversation with his colleague Latham Boyle. It was the fall of 2022, and the two physicists were on an evening shuttle from Waterloo to Toronto. Boyle, an expert in aperiodic tilings who lived in Toronto at the time and is now at the University of Edinburgh, was a familiar face on those shuttle rides, which often got stuck in heavy traffic.\n\n“Normally they could be very miserable,” Boyle said. “This was like the greatest one of all time.”\n\nBefore that fateful evening, Li and Boyle knew of each other’s work, but their research areas didn’t directly overlap, and they’d never had a one-on-one conversation. But like countless researchers in unrelated fields, Li was curious about aperiodic tilings. “It’s very hard to be not interested,” he said.\n\nInterest turned into fascination when Boyle mentioned a special property of aperiodic tilings: local indistinguishability. In that context, the term means something different. The same set of tiles can form infinitely many tilings that look completely different overall, but it’s impossible to tell any two tilings apart by examining any local area. That’s because every finite patch of any tiling, no matter how large, will show up somewhere in every other tiling.\n\n“If I plop you down in one tiling or the other and give you the rest of your life to explore, you’ll never be able to figure out whether I put you down in your tiling or my tiling,” Boyle said.\n\nMerrill Sherman/Quanta Magazine.\n\nTo Li, this seemed tantalizingly similar to the definition of local indistinguishability in quantum error correction. He mentioned the connection to Boyle, who was instantly transfixed. The underlying mathematics in the two cases was quite different, but the resemblance was too intriguing to dismiss.\n\nLi and Boyle wondered whether they could draw a more precise connection between the two definitions of local indistinguishability by building a quantum error-correcting code based on a class of aperiodic tilings. They continued talking through the entire two-hour shuttle ride, and by the time they arrived in Toronto they were sure that such a code was possible — it was just a matter of constructing a formal proof.\n\nQuantum Tiles\n\nLi and Boyle decided to start with Penrose tilings, which were simple and familiar. To transform them into a quantum error-correcting code, they’d have to first define what quantum states and errors would look like in this unusual system. That part was easy. An infinite two-dimensional plane covered with Penrose tiles, like a grid of qubits, can be described using the mathematical framework of quantum physics: The quantum states are specific tilings instead of 0s and 1s. An error simply deletes a single patch of the tiling pattern, the way certain errors in qubit arrays wipe out the state of every qubit in a small cluster.\n\nThe next step was to identify tiling configurations that wouldn’t be affected by localized errors, like the virtual qubit states in ordinary quantum error-correcting codes. The solution, as in an ordinary code, was to use superpositions. A carefully chosen superposition of Penrose tilings is akin to a bathroom tile arrangement proposed by the world’s most indecisive interior decorator. Even if a piece of that jumbled blueprint is missing, it won’t betray any information about the overall floor plan.\n\nZhi Li noticed an intriguing resemblance between a property of quantum error-correcting codes and a property of aperiodic tilings that has the same name. Courtesy of Zhi Li.\n\nFor this approach to work, Li and Boyle first had to distinguish two qualitatively different relationships between distinct Penrose tilings. Given any tiling, you can generate an infinite number of new tilings by shifting it in any direction or rotating it. The set of all tilings generated this way is called an equivalence class.\n\nBut not all Penrose tilings fall into the same equivalence class. A tiling in one equivalence class can’t be transformed into a tiling in another class through any combination of rotations and translations — the two infinite patterns are qualitatively different, yet still locally indistinguishable.\n\nWith this distinction in place, Li and Boyle could finally construct an error-correcting code. Recall that in an ordinary quantum error-correcting code, a virtual qubit is encoded in superpositions of physical qubits. In their tiling-based code, the analogous states are superpositions of all tilings within a single equivalence class. If the plane is tiled with this kind of superposition, there’s a procedure for filling in gaps without revealing any information about the overall quantum state.\n\n“The Penrose tiling somehow knew about quantum error correction before the invention of the quantum computer,” Boyle said.\n\nLi and Boyle’s intuition on the bus ride had been right. At a deep level, the two definitions of local indistinguishability were themselves indistinguishable.\n\nFinding the Pattern\n\nThough mathematically well defined, Li and Boyle’s new code was hardly practical. The edges of tiles in Penrose tilings don’t fall at regular intervals, so specifying their distribution requires continuous real numbers rather than discrete integers. Quantum computers, on the other hand, typically use discrete systems like grids of qubits. Worse, Penrose tilings are only locally indistinguishable on an infinite plane, which doesn’t translate well to the finite real world.\n\nLatham Boyle worked with Li to construct quantum error-correcting codes based on aperiodic tilings.

The discrete code can also be made finite, but other challenges remain. Both finite codes can only correct errors that are clustered together, whereas the most popular quantum error-correcting codes can handle randomly distributed errors. It’s not yet clear whether this is an inherent limitation of tiling-based codes or if it could be circumvented with a cleverer design.\n\n“There’s lots of follow-up work that can be done,” said Felix Flicker, a physicist at the University of Bristol. “All good papers should do that.”\n\nIt’s not just the technical details that need to be better understood — the new discovery raises more fundamental questions as well. One obvious next step is to determine which other tilings also work as codes. Just last year, mathematicians discovered a family of aperiodic tilings that each only use a single tile. “It would be fascinating to see how these recent developments might perhaps connect with the quantum error-correction issue,” Penrose wrote in an email.\n\nAnother direction involves exploring connections between quantum error-correcting codes and certain models of quantum gravity. In a 2020 paper, Boyle, Flicker and the late Madeline Dickens showed that aperiodic tilings appear in the space-time geometry of those models. But that connection stemmed from a property of the tilings that plays no role in Li and Boyle’s work. It seems quantum gravity, quantum error correction and aperiodic tilings are different pieces of a puzzle whose contours researchers are just beginning to understand. As with aperiodic tilings themselves, figuring out how those pieces fit together can be remarkably subtle.\n\n“There are deep roots connecting these different things,” Flicker said. “This tantalizing set of connections is begging to be worked out.”\n\nSee the full article here .\n\nComments are invited and will be appreciated, especially if the reader finds any errors which I can correct.
