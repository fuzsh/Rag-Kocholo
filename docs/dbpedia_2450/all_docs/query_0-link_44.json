        "text": "Coleman Postdoctoral Fellow, Queen's University, Kingston\n\nA new class of quantum channels, which we call Temperley-Lieb channels, and their investigated properties will be discussed in this talk. It has turned out that some important quantum information-theoretic quantities of these channels are computable despite their highly non-trivial structures. As an effort to explain their quantitative aspects, asymptotically sharp minimum output entropy, Holevo capacity, one-shot quantum capacity and entanglement of formation will be presented.\n\nPosters\n\nQuantum Security Properties of Hash Functions\n\nBenjamin Hamlin, TAMU\n\nIn this work, we consider security properties of cryptographic hash functions versus quantum adversaries. We adapt the seven properties from Rogaway and Shrimpton (FSE'04) to a quantum setting, and prove that allowing the adversary superposition access to the challenger provides no additional power over classical access, showing that superposition attacks are not useful in this setting. We confirm that the implications and separations among the adapted classical properties carry over to a quantum setting. Moreover, we consider an inherently quantum property called collapsing, proposed by Unruh (Eurocrypt'16), and construct explicit examples separating it from several classical properties. Finally, we examine the property-preservation of several iterated hashing schemes and show, in particular, that that the ROX construction in Andreeva et al. (Asiacrypt'07) preserves the seven properties as well as collapsing in the quantum random oracle model.\n\nBounds for Hybrid Codes\n\nAndrew Nemec, TAMU\n\nHybrid codes simultaneously encode classical and quantum information. We give weight enumerators for general hybrid codes and derive linear programming bounds from them. These bounds are compared to bounds for quantum codes to identify parameters where hybrid codes may outperform quantum codes.\n\nAn Expository on Peter Shor's Quantum Algorithm for Factoring\n\nKristopher Watkins, TAMU\n\nPeter Shor gave us the beautiful algorithm for factoring a number in polynomial time of the size of the number. This is a huge threat to RSA encryption and we can also apply some of the methods to solving the Discrete Logarithm Problem in polynomial time as well. I have mixed Shor's ideas as well as a few others to provide a simple overview of how we beat the factoring problem.\n\nDelegating Quantum Computation Using Only Hash Functions\n\nJiayu Zhang, Boston University\n\nIn this paper, we construct a new scheme for delegating a large circuit family, which we call \"C+P circuits\". \"C+P\" circuits are the circuits composed of Toffoli gates and diagonal gates. Our scheme is non-interactive, only requires small quantum resources on the client side, and can be proved secure in the quantum random oracle model, without relying on additional assumptions, for example, the existence of fully homomorphic encryption. In practice the random oracle can be replaced by appropriate hash functions or symmetric key encryption schemes, for example, SHA-3, AES.\n\nThis protocol allows a client to delegate the most expensive part of some quantum algorithms, for example, Shor's algorithm. The previous protocols that are powerful enough to delegate Shor's algorithm require either many rounds of interactions or the existence of FHE. The quantum resources required by the client are fewer than when it runs Shor's algorithm locally. Different from many previous protocols, our scheme is not based on quantum one time pad, but on a new encoding called \"entanglement encoding\". We then generalize the garbled circuit to reversible garbled circuit to allow the computation on this encoding.\n\nTo prove the security of this protocol, we study key dependent message (KDM) security in the quantum random oracle model. Then as a natural generalization, we define and study quantum KDM security. KDM security was not previously studied in quantum settings.\n\nBraid Group Representations from Twisted Tensor Products of Group Algebras\n\nQing Zhang, TAMU\n\nIn a topological quantum computer, braiding anyons corresponds to computation in unitary braid group representations on their state space. These braid group representations arise in a complicated way from centralizer algebras for simple objects in tensor categories. It is an important problem to find more straightforward descriptions of these braid group representations. Towards this goal, we are working on a method of constructing braid group representations from twisted tensor products of group algebras. We outline this construction, give examples, and compare the resulting representations with the ones coming from tensor categories."
