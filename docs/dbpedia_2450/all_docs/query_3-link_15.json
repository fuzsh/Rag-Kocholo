        "text": "What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences is a series of publications that report on the latest mathematical research in a way that both mathematicians and non-mathematicians can appreciate.\n\nThe table of contents of each and the full text of selected articles are below.\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 12\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 11\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 10\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 9\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 8\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 7\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 6\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 5\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 4\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 3\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 2\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 1\n\nOrder What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 12 on the AMS Bookstore\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 12\n\nFifty Ways to Beat a Virus (Part 1)\n\nIn 2020, the world for the first time in a century confronted a global pandemic that would claim millions of lives. While students were sent home and campuses closed, many mathematicians found an opportunity to join the fight against COVID-19. Even simple differential equation models can teach us important lessons about the exponential growth of a new epidemic and the importance of threshold behavior. Using more elaborate (and realistic) models, two mathematical modeling groups, in Texas and Illinois, had a profound and positive effect on the management of the epidemic by local and state authorities during the first waves.\n\nFifty Ways to Beat a Virus (Part 2)\n\nContinuing the previous chapter, Part 2 discusses the problems confronted by mathematicians and epidemiologists in the later part of 2020 and in early 2021. How could universities re-open safely? How does the uncontrolled spread of an epidemic in prisons affect the surrounding community, and what can be done about it? And the biggest question: could vaccination bring the epidemic under control? Even though the coronavirus kept throwing surprises at us, mathematicians did a surprisingly good job of developing strategies, giving realistic answers and highlighting the main reasons for uncertainty.\n\nFifty Ways to Beat a Virus (Part 3)\n\nAnother important front in the battle against COVID-19 was to understand how the infection progresses within the human body. Why do some people have life-threatening symptoms, while others have none at all? An online group called the “Immune Gals” highlighted the delayed release of interferon as a characteristic marker of severe cases. Another mathematician used the tools of graph theory to identify parts of the viral RNA that are especially vulnerable to attack by drugs or gene therapy. And a third group adapted a machine-learning language model to detect escape variants of coronavirus. In effect, they taught the computer to “speak virus.”\n\nDescartes' Homework\n\nA homework problem assigned in 1643 by René Descartes to his star pupil, Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia, backfired when Descartes himself couldn’t solve it. But he redeemed himself by solving a special case that still fascinates geometers and number theorists. Descartes’ theorem and its generalizations have revealed startling symmetries in infinite foams (called Apollonian packings) that are created by squeezing circles as tightly as possible into the spaces created by other circles. New Apollonian and Apollonian-like patterns continue to be discovered in the plane, in 3-space, and in higher dimensions all the way up to dimension 20.\n\nSquare Pegs and Squiggly Holes\n\nA century-old “folklore problem” in topology asks whether any continuous loop in the plane that does not cross itself must contain four points that form a perfect square. This is known as the Square Peg Conjecture. Recently, a team of two geometers proved something even better: if the curve is smooth (i.e., it has no corners or cusps) then it contains rectangles of all conceivable shapes, and also quadrilaterals of any shape that will fit snugly in a circle. Their proof ingeniously weaves together 2000-year-old theorems of Euclidean geometry with less than 20-year-old theorems of symplectic geometry.\n\nDancing on the Edge of the Impossible\n\nThe ultimate dream of many number theorists would be an algorithm that inputs a polynomial equation and outputs all the rational solutions to that equation. For equations with integer coefficients in one variable, it’s easy. For equations with nine or more variables, it’s impossible. But equations in two variables are right on the edge. Faltings’ theorem, proved in 1983, guarantees (for most such equations) that there are only finitely many solutions… but it doesn’t say whether there are four or four million. Number theorists are now inching closer to an “effective” Faltings theorem that would tell them when they can stop looking for more solutions.\n\nA Climate for Math\n\nUnprecedented heat waves. Orange skies. Ten-thousand-year floods. When the weather gets weirder than ever before, whom are you going to call? A climatologist, sure. But you might want to talk with a mathematician, too. This chapter explains how mathematical techniques like extreme value analysis, differential equations, changepoint analysis, and machine learning can give us some idea of what has happened already and what will happen next in climate change.\n\nMuch Ado About Zero\n\nWhat is the friendliest research community in mathematics? You could make a good case for zero-forcing. This mash-up of linear algebra and graph theory has been in existence for less than 20 years, but has attracted a large following, with a sizeable proportion of young mathematicians and people from diverse academic and social backgrounds. Zero-forcing is a way to turn hard problems about eigenvalues of matrices into easy games played on graphs (i.e., dot-and-line networks). Or vice versa, it’s a way to turn simple graph games into challenging math problems. Applications to quantum control and electrical and civil engineering are the icing on the cake.\n\nOrder What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 11 on the AMS Bookstore\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 11\n\nGerrymandering: Mathematics on Trial\n\nIn the last ten years, mathematicians have developed much more sophisticated methods to detect partisan gerrymandering (i.e., the redrawing of election districts to favor one political party). Unfamiliar words like “outliers” and “efficiency gap” were heard in the US Supreme Court. Though the court eventually withheld its endorsement of any such methods, awareness of the issue among mathematicians reached an all-time high.\n\nThe Calculus of Calories\n\nDieting comes down to a simple equation: Energy stored = energy intake – energy expenditure. If only it were so easy! Mathematicians have developed new algorithms and smartphone apps to help you take the weight off. But they have also made surprising and sobering discoveries about the ways in which your body will fight to put the weight back on.\n\nWhen Black Holes Collide\n\nOne of the boldest predictions of Einstein’s theory of general relativity was the possibility of ripples in spacetime, called gravitational waves. The biggest roadblock to detecting them was figuring out what these waves should “sound like.” In 2015, astrophysicists finally heard the mathematically predicted chirp of two black holes colliding, a billion light-years away and a billion years ago.\n\nThe Shape of Data\n\nA new hybrid of statistics and topology, called topological data analysis, uses tools like persistent homology to uncover hidden geometric structures in data, such as loops and bubbles. Applications have run the gamut from figuring out how rat brains encode spatial information to finding optimal molecular structures for porous molecules called zeolites.\n\nThe \"Set®\" Game Has Met Its Match\n\nA popular card game leads to an unexpectedly challenging problem on arithmetic progressions in finite vector spaces, known as the Cap Set Conjecture. In 2016, mathematicians discovered an unexpectedly simple solution. A very rough analog is that it you don’t need too many stars in the sky before you’ll start seeing “three-in-a-row” patterns like the belt of Orion. (Four in a row, though, is another story!)\n\nThe Mathematics of Commuting\n\nBike-sharing systems (like New York’s CitiBike) and ridesharing services (like Uber and Lyft) have led to an explosion of interest in optimization problems. How do you move bikes efficiently from hubs with too many to hubs with too few? How much could traffic congestion be reduced if people shared Uber rides? And what would be the effect of a door-to-door solution that combined bike sharing with ride sharing?\n\nExpanding Horizons\n\nExpanding graphs, or expanders, have multiple personalities. They are networks that are hard to cut in two; networks in which information propagates rapidly; and networks with a large “spectral gap.” In recent years their applications have become even more numerous than their personalities. This chapter explains how they are used in coding, knot theory, and nearest-neighbor search, plus a surprising generalization to hypergraphs.\n\nQuantum Computers and Golden Gates\n\nEven as the U.S. government invests more than $1 billion in quantum computing, fundamental questions remain about how (or if) quantum computers will work. A universal computer needs to use a small vocabulary of elementary “gate” operations to place several quantum bits (qubits) into any target state, with some guarantee of efficiency and accuracy. Mathematicians have now obtained such guarantees for single-qubit operations, using “golden gate” sets.\n\nNeedles in an Infinite Haystack\n\nThe “asymptotic Fermat’s last theorem” (AFLT), a generalization of the most famous theorem in number theory, can in many cases be reduced to solving the ultra-simple equation x + y = 1, but with restrictions on the prime divisors of x and y. Though theory says there are only finitely many solutions, finding them has been like combing through an infinitely large haystack. Until 2018! Now it can be done (and many cases of AFLT proved) entirely by computer.\n\nOrder What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 10 on the AMS Bookstore\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 10\n\nOrigami: Unfolding the Future\n\nThe ancient Japanese art of paper-folding is going high-tech, as engineers invent new devices that deploy or undeply folding. These inventions lead in turn to challenging mathematical problems about assembly pathways, defects, and curved folds in flat materials.\n\nPrime Clusters and Gaps: Out-Experting the Experts\n\nMathematics got its real-life Walter Mitty story in 2013, when Yitang Zhang shocked number theorists with the first finite upper bound on the minimum size of prime gaps. One of the oldest problems in number theory, the Twin Prime Conjecture, may now be within reach.\n\nThe Truth Shall Set Your Fee\n\nWhen you pay a stranger, especially online, for help, how can you be sure you're getting honest answers? A new theory in computer science shows how rational self-interest dovetails with the pressing need for trustworthy computation.\n\nClimate Past, Present, and Future\n\nChange is everywhere you look in Earth’s climate, and always has been. Throughout climate science, mathematical models help sort out what did happen (mass extinctions), what is happening (melting ice sheets), and what might happen (tipping points).\n\nFollowing in Sherlock Holmes' Bike Tracks\n\nIn a story published in 1905, Sherlock Holmes incorrectly deduced which way a bicycle went, on the basis of its tracks. The subtle relationship between a bike’s front and rear tracks recently helped mathematicians solve another Victorian-era problem on the operation of planimeters.\n\nQuod Erat Demonstrandum\n\nA proof is a kind of mathematical poem—and sometimes an epic one, at that. Two recent proofs, each years in the making, show the lengths to which mathematicians will go in the dogged pursuit of truth, including, these days, enlisting computers to double check their logic.\n\nThe Kadison-Singer Problem: A Fine Balance\n\nGreat problems come in many disguises. The Kadison-Singer problem, first posed as a problem in theoretical physics, popped up in many other mathematical contexts over more than half a century until it was finally solved in 2013 graph theorists.\n\nA Pentagonal Search Pays Off\n\nFinding shapes that tile the plane isn’t hard to do. Finding all of them is trickier. Mathematicians still don't know how many different convex pentagons are capable of tiling the plane. But the list, long stalled at 14, just inched up, thanks to a new algorithm and a computer search.\n\nThe Brave New World of Sports Analytics\n\nIn the last few years, professional sports have been swept a new wave of statistical methods, or “analytics.” These methods, coupled with new data sources like video capture, quantify elusive skills and challenge cherished assumptions about in-game strategy.\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 9\n\nMassive Breakthrough\n\nIn 1963, Peter Higgs predicted the existence of the Higgs field, which explains why many subatomic particles have nonzero mass. This prediction was based on a mere page of mathematical calculation and an inspired analogy with the Landau-Ginzburg theory of phase transitions. Almost half a century and more than $9 billion later, experimental physicists at CERN finally chased down the Higgs boson, the most elusive quarry in physics. The discovery filled in the last missing piece of the Standard Model of quantum physics, and spectacularly vindicated the use of abstract symmetry principles to discover new physical phenomena.\n\nTubing through Hyperspace\n\nIn 2012, geometers in rapid succession solved three open problems concerning optimal geometries of tori (inner tubes). The Willmore Conjecture identified the torus with least bending energy; the Lawson Conjecture identified the torus in the hypersphere (a sphere in four-dimensional space) with the least surface area; and the Pinkall-Sterling Conjecture classified all of the tori in the hypersphere that minimize area subject to a volume constraint. Tubing has never been so much fun!\n\nTsunamis: Learning from Math, Learning from the Past\n\nThe great Japanese tsunami of 2011 killed more than 15,000 people in a country that had been better prepared for tsunamis than any other in the world. The tragedy highlighted gaps in our scientific understanding of this hugely destructive natural phenomenon, and even more so in the public’s understanding. It also pointed out some ways in which mathematical models got it right, but not fast enough.\n\nToday's Forecast: Ten Percent Chance of Burglary\n\nAn interdisciplinary team at UCLA discovered how to adapt a mathematical model developed for earthquake prediction to identify likely crime “hot spots.” Two field tests of their software were resounding successes, and predictive policing was recognized in Time magazine and other media outlets as one of the top scientific discoveries of 2011.\n\nTopologists Cross Four Off \"Bucket List\"\n\nThree decades ago, three-dimensional topology seemed like a wild, untamed jungle of disparate examples. Then William Thurston proposed a series of conjectures that brought some order to the chaos. In 2012, just months before Thurston’s death, the Virtual Haken Conjecture and Virtual Fibering Conjecture were finally proved, showing that almost all three-dimensional manifolds are descended from templates constructed in an elementary fashion.\n\nMathematicians Do the Twist\n\nRubik’s cube, the mathematician’s favorite toy, continues to attract new fans and inspire new research. While “speedcubers” developed new algorithms (and manual dexterity) to solve the cube in less than 10 seconds, mathematicians proved that an omniscient being could always solve the classic, 3-by-3-by-3 cube in 20 moves or less.\n\nThe Right Epidemic at the Right Time\n\nIn 2009 the world experienced its first flu pandemic in forty years. Fortunately it turned out much milder than the three great pandemics of the twentieth century, but it provided an ideal opportunity to test a variety of mathematical simulations in real time. Conclusions: The simulations worked pretty well, and communications between modelers and field workers were excellent, but the late delivery of vaccine would have been a fiasco in a worse epidemic.\n\nThinking Topically\n\nTopic modeling is a new statistical technique named after its ability to identify topics (such as genetics or climate change) in a large body of documents. While still in its early days, it has proved hugely popular in the fields of “digital humanities” and it might enable social-networking websites to respond automatically and anonymously to cyber-bullying.\n\nThinking Tropically\n\nBlessed (or perhaps cursed?) with a catchy name, tropical geometry enables mathematicians to solve difficult problems in classical algebraic geometry by making simple combinatorial models that look a lot like stick figures. This new type of geometry also has surprising applications to string theory in physics, evolutionary trees in biology, and the scheduling of trains.\n\nUnfortunately, Volume 9 is no longer available.\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 8\n\nAccounting for Taste\n\nNetflix, a movie rental company, offered a million-dollar prize for a computer algorithm that could significantly upgrade the company's ability to predict its customers' likes and dislikes. The wildly successful competition upset some conventional wisdom in the field of machine learning and vividly demonstrated the power of \"crowdsourcing.\"\n\nA Brave New Symplectic World\n\nThirty years ago, Alan Weinstein conjectured that certain kinds of dynamical systems with two degrees of freedom, such as a pendulum that is free to stretch as well as swing, always have periodic (repeating) solutions. At the time, no one had any idea how to prove his conjecture. But that was before \"symplectic camels\" and a \"crazy\" homology theory based on the equations for a magnetic monopole. Conclusion: Periodic orbits exist. (Magnetic monopoles still don't.)\n\nMathematics and the Financial Crisis\n\nIn the first decade of the 2000s, investors embraced credit derivatives: a clever, formula-based method to parcel out the risk of subprime loans and profit from a booming housing market. But they forgot--or chose to ignore--that a mathematical model is only as good as its assumptions.\n\nThe Ultimate Billiard Shot\n\nIn an inside-out version of billiards that you can't quite fit into your garage (or even the Milky Way), two groups of researchers find different ways to sink the cue ball into a pocket at infinity.\n\nSimPatient\n\nMathematical models of patient populations have begun to supplement or replace clinical trials in cases where the trials would be difficult or impossible to perform. In 2009, a public health panel used six breast cancer models to arrive at a controversial recommendation that women aged 40-49 should no longer be advised to have an annual mammogram.\n\nInstant Randomness\n\nHow long does it take to mix milk in a coffee cup, neutrons in an atomic reactor, atoms in a gas, or electron spins in a magnet? In the Ising model of magnetism, mathematicians have calculated a unique cutoff time when the system abruptly goes from essentially unmixed to almost completely mixed. The same behavior is expected for other systems described by the theory of Markov chains.\n\nIn Search of Quantum Chaos\n\nA classical billiard ball, on a table with curved, \"dispersing\" sides, travels on a chaotic trajectory that essentially randomizes the ball's position over the long term. However, at low energies, quantum billiard balls are not chaotic. In a tour de force combining pure number theory with physics, mathematicians proved that quantum chaos does emerge at high energies.\n\n3-D Surprises\n\nEven in the twenty-first century, mathematics can still reveal new phenomena in ordinary three-dimensional space. Item 1: a stunningly efficient way to pack tetrahedra. Item 2: the Gömböc, a homogeneous body that automatically rights (and wrongs) itself.\n\nAs One Heroic Age Ends, a New One Begins\n\nJohn Milnor's discovery of \"exotic spheres\" in 1956 ushered in a new era of high-dimensional topology, with powerful new tools like framed cobordism theory, stable homotopy theory, and surgery. But one question, called the Kervaire Invariant One problem, remained stubbornly unanswered for more than 40 years, until three topologists found \"a shortcut to Mount Everest.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Volume 8 is no longer available.\n\nOrder What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 7 on the AMS Bookstore\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 7\n\nA New Twist in Knot Theory\n\n( 846 KB)\n\nTwo seemingly unrelated kinds of knots--modular knots and Lorenz knots--turn out to be the same. For number theorists, the payoff is a new way to look at an old concept, the modular surface. For dynamical systems theorists, it's a new way to understand the beginnings of chaos.\n\nError-term Roulette and the Sato-Tate Conjecture\n\nFifteen years ago, Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's Last Theorem, thereby solving the most famous problem in mathematics. The aftershocks are still being felt. A team of number theorists, including Wiles collaborator, Richard Taylor, adapts Wiles' machinery to polish off another celebrated unsolved problem in number theory.\n\nThe Fifty-one Percent Solution\n\n( 846 KB)\n\nPersi Diaconis, Susan Holmes and Richard Montgomery tell you how to get the odds in your favor the next time you flip a coin. And no, you don't have to cheat.\n\nDominos, Anyone?\n\nAn innocent puzzle about tiling a checkerboard with dominos leads, ultimately, to a new model of random surfaces. The theory is both simple enough to be exactly solvable, and complex enough to include phase transitions between \"solid,\" \"liquid,\" and \"gaseous\" states--a combination that has never occurred previously in statistical physics.\n\nNot Seeing Is Believing\n\nNew \"metamaterials\" may soon bring invisibility cloaks--and inaudibility cloaks, too--out of the realm of fantasy and into reality. Unlike Harry Potter's cloak, these devices will work strictly on the principles of mathematics, not magic.\n\nGetting with the (Mori) Program\n\nIn algebraic geometry, the Mori Minimal Model Program is an ambitious effort to match the geometry of surfaces defined by polynomial equations to their algebra. After 100 years of carrying out the program one dimension at a time, algebraic geometers race to the top of the ladder.\n\nThe Book that Time Couldn't Erase\n\nMore than 1000 years ago, an unknown scribe copied some of Archimedes' works onto parchment. But 200 years later, another scribe erased them and wrote a prayer book over the top. Over the last ten years, high-tech imaging methods have penetrated through the damage done by centuries of neglect and abuse to reveal what Archimedes, the greatest mathematician of ancient Greece, really wrote.\n\nCharting a 248-dimensional World\n\nRacing against time and the incurable illness of one of their colleagues, a team of twenty group theorists puts together a detailed survey of \"the most beautiful structure in mathematics\"-- the exceptional Lie group, E8.\n\nCompressed Sensing Makes Every Pixel Count\n\n( 878 KB)\n\nProving that more is not always better, mathematicians show that \"sparse\" or \"compressible\" signals, such as digital photographs and cell phone messages, can be reconstructed from many fewer measurements than engineers previously supposed. As an extreme proof of principle, engineers design the world's first single-pixel camera.\n\nOrder What's Happening in the Mathematical Sciences, Volume 6 on the AMS Bookstore\n\nTable of Contents, Volume 6\n\nSee links to Cipra and Mackenzie talking about the subject of each chapter.\n\nFirst of Seven Millennium Problems Nears Completion\n\nby Barry Cipra ( 1 MB)\n\nhear the podcast interview with the author\n\nIn 2002, Grigory Perelman announced a solution to the Poincaré Conjecture, a problem in topology selected in 2000 as one of the seven leading math challenges of the millennium. After more than three years of scrutiny, mathematicians are cautiously accepting his proof, which uses a geometric partial differential equation called \"Ricci flow,\" first studied by Richard Hamilton.\n\nClassifying Hyperbolic Manifolds--All's Well that Ends Well\n\nby Dana Mackenzie ( 1.62 MB)\n\nhear the podcast interview with the author\n\nWhile three-dimensional topologists awaited a verdict on the Poincaré Conjecture (which deals with closed manifolds), several of them solved a suite of long-standing conjectures about the ends of open manifolds.\n\nDigits of Pi\n\nby Barry Cipra ( 317 KB)\n\nhear the podcast interview with the author\n\nPi lovers rejoice! You can now stick your finger into pi and pluck out any digit (say, the trillionth one) without having to compute all the preceding digits. The only catch is that you have to count in sixteens.\n\nCombinatoricists Solve a Venn-erable Problem\n\nby Barry Cipra ( 415 KB)\n\nhear the podcast interview with the author\n\nA question posed by an undergraduate student--can a Venn diagram be rotationally symmetric?--leads to some beautiful \"doilies,\" intricate mathematics, and (after forty years) a solution found by another student.\n\nNew Insights into Prime Numbers\n\nby Barry Cipra ( hear the podcast interview with the author)\n\nnumbers surprised number theorists. A team of Indian mathematicians, including two students, discovers the first polynomial-time algorithm for testing to see if a number is prime. American, Turkish, and Hungarian mathematicians collaborate to show that small gaps between consecutive primes occur much more often than anyone had previously proved. And another international collaboration finds evenly spaced (but non-consecutive) prime sequences of any desired length.\n\nFrom Rubik's Cube to Quadratic Number Fields ... and Beyond\n\nby Dana Mackenzie ( hear the podcast interview with the author)\n\nManjul Bhargava started with a simple idea of putting numbers into a box. What came out of the box, eventually, was a whole new way to combine and to count objects in algebraic number theory.\n\nVortices in the Navier-Stokes Equations\n\nby Barry Cipra ( hear the podcast interview with the author)\n\nFrom Jupiter's Great Red Spot to the eddies in a stream, vortices are a familiar feature of fluid flow. Mathematicians have gained new insights into the formation and long-term survival of vortices in both two- and three-dimensional fluids.\n\nFluid Dynamics Explains Mysteries of Insect Motion\n\nby Dana Mackenzie ( 735 KB)\n\nhear the podcast interview with the author\n\nHow do water striders move on a nearly frictionless surface? How do dragonflies hover? These and other conundrums of biology can be explained by the mathematics of the Navier-Stokes equations.\n\nBrownian Motion, Phase Transitions, and Conformal Maps\n\nby Dana Mackenzie ( hear the podcast interview with the author)\n\nA new random process called Schramm-Loewner evolution turns out to be a good model for a variety of physical phenomena, from the random jitters of air molecules to phase transitions of a magnetic material. The key mathematical property of these systems, proven in some cases and still conjectural in others, is conformal invariance.\n\nSmooth(ed) Moves\n\nby Barry Cipra ( hear the podcast interview with the author)\n\nSome algorithms of computer science, such as the simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems, work better than they are supposed to.
