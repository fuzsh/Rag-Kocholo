        "text": "By Ali Hussein, Peter Sigrist, Ilyas Khan\n\n“To reject one paradigm without simultaneously substituting another is to reject science itself” (Thomas Kuhn, author of “The Structure of Scientific Revolutions” and the originator of the phrase “paradigm shift”)¹\n\nHumans have been asking fundamental questions about the nature of reality for a very long time. From Democritus to Empedocles of Akragas, from Gallileo to Newton, from Kant to Wittgenstein, and from Einstein to Hawking.\n\nOver a hundred years ago, a series of advances, in an extraordinarily short period of time that has been described as the most innovative period in human history², led to the discovery of quantum mechanics — the laws that govern the universe at the most fundamental level, and which are unchanging across the known universe.\n\nSince its discovery, quantum mechanics has become the most proven scientific theory ever, allowing scientists to make predictions of unparalleled accuracy.³\n\nHowever, despite the extent to which the “what” of quantum mechanics has been experimentally proven time and time again, we still do not understand the “why”. Although scientists have spent more than a century investigating the foundations of quantum physics, the “why” of quantum mechanics remains shrouded in mystery and largely inaccessible to anyone other than trained physicists and advanced mathematicians. Non-specialists, from artists to lawyers, from architects to engineers, from educators to the “person on the street”, have only been able to follow from afar.\n\nAnyone who has tried to understand quantum mechanics without a formal training in physics, and more specifically without a strong foundation in mathematics, has struggled. Part of the difficulty lies in the fact that the vast majority of the literature that tries to explain quantum physics is written by mathematicians and physicists for their own peers.\n\nHowever, an equally important part of the difficulty that we all face in really getting to grips with quantum mechanics stems from our habitually applying a classical lens to concepts such as superposition or entanglement, and painstakingly trying to pick our way through counterintuitive processes. This is inevitable. After all, the universe at the smallest scale works in ways that are at odds with our everyday experience. We inhabit a classical world, whereas quantum mechanics describes the rules of the world at the infinitesimal level of the atom and its constituent parts such as electrons and other impossibly small things such as photons. We humans are simply too big, and the world of quantum mechanics is not visible and its effects not obviously evident to us, in our day to day lives.\n\nIn this article, we focus on the “what” of quantum physics and hope to shed some light on the way that, no matter how counterintuitive quantum mechanics might seem, it may be possible to gain an understanding of it without being a scientist. We examine ZX-calculus, a relatively new innovation which helps to move us away from the classical paradigm, with a new approach to the mathematics of quantum mechanics that encapsulates it in comprehensible “game-like” rules. We consider the role of ZX-calculus in supporting the development of transformational technologies like quantum computing, and how ZX aids in satisfying the need for more people in a successful modern society to come to terms with the “what” of quantum mechanics. We also hope to inspire some readers to consider how it might lead them to engage more deeply with the “why”.\n\nClosing a 100-year quantum knowledge gap\n\n“The problem of getting the interpretation proved to be rather more difficult than just working out the equations”(Paul Dirac, one of the founding fathers of quantum mechanics)⁴\n\nQuantum mechanics was discovered at the beginning of the twentieth century by a handful of scientists, some of whom have subsequently become household names. Scientists such as Einstein, Planck, Bohr, Schrödinger, Jordan, Dirac, Heisenberg and von Neumann, developed explanations to interpret, formalise and account for discrepancies that had been observed in nature at the very tiniest scale. These discrepancies often appeared to contradict the world as it could be normally observed at the “macro” or human level.\n\nA systematic framework was devised and developed by these scientists and then supplemented throughout the twentieth century by others, to account for accurate observations of quantum phenomena arising from increasingly high-energy physics experiments, and using instrumentation with futuristic names such as “cyclotrons”, “betatrons”, “synchrotrons”, and “the Cosmotron”.⁵ Yet, while the “what” was consistently advancing, the “why” remained baffling even to the founders of quantum theory, who preferred to describe their perspectives on the experimental data as “interpretations”.\n\nThis lack of clarity was reflected in the very low level of understanding amongst the public at large. Aside from Schrödinger’s Cat, a well known thought experiment, there remains a very large gulf between the understanding of quantum mechanics by specialists in physics and mathematics on the one hand, and the general public on the other, with the theory often introduced as being so “hard” that it is not worth most people’s time. Descriptions such as “irrational”, “strange”⁶ and “spooky”⁷ have long been the norm, even among professional theoreticians.\n\nA rigorous quantum mathematics\n\nFrom the very earliest days there was growing confidence that the “what” of quantum theory, at least, was described correctly by the mathematics that formalised the theory. The most important mathematical treatment of quantum physics, which was celebrated for its rigour, was presented by the Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann in his 1932 book, Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics (Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik).⁸ This built on the innovations and breakthroughs of the founders of quantum mechanics and created a complete system. This work remains central to quantum mechanics, although ironically within three years of publishing his masterpiece, von Neumann was unhappy with it and expressed a desire for a new approach⁹.\n\nVon Neumann believed that quantum physics was a theory not limited to describing the subatomic, but was “a theory of the whole world”¹⁰. This bold reflection was typical of physicists and mathematicians engaged in quantum physics at that time. Von Neumann’s contemporary, Erwin Schrödinger, who also became something of a “public intellectual”, wrote, “if you cannot — in the long run — tell everyone what you have been doing, your doing has been worthless.”¹¹\n\nVon Neumann never finished working on the mathematical basis of quantum mechanics and, with the Second World War looming, practical applications of physics overtook concerns about what quantum mechanics was telling us about the fundamentals of the universe.¹²\n\nA categorical approach to quantum mathematics\n\nDuring the early and mid 1940’s, Saunders Mac Lane of the University of Chicago and Samuel Eilenberg of Columbia in New York City, produced a seminal paper¹³ laying the foundations of category theory, a field of mathematics that connects branches such as algebra — where mathematical symbols are manipulated as part of formulae, with topology — the study of continuous properties of spatial objects. From its inception, category theory, which places an emphasis on links between objects rather than the objects themselves, promised to reveal fresh insights about the way systems in the world relate to one another. In the past two or three decades category theory has started to deliver on that promise, and is being widely used, for example, by computer scientists.\n\nCategory theorists also work on better understanding and explaining challenging problems in physics, engineering, natural language processing and more, in addition to computer science. The movement has been advanced by mathematicians such as Jean Bénabou, Vladimir Voevodsky, John Baez, Emily Riehl, Joachim Lambek, and Alexander Grothendieck.\n\nIn 2004, Professor Samson Abramsky and Bob Coecke, from the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Computer Science Department), applied category theory to quantum mechanics, to create the new field of categorical quantum mechanics. They explicitly set out to “recast” the mathematics of “quantum mechanics, due to von Neumann”,¹⁴ picking up the baton passed on, over 70 years earlier, when von Neumann expressed his dissatisfaction, particularly with Hilbert space formalism. Abramsky and Coecke’s new formalism, which is as rigorous as von Neumann’s standard system, was designed as a pictorial method for reasoning about quantum processes. This followed and built upon graphical notations used by Nobel Laureate physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose in the 1970s. In the years following the introduction of categorical quantum mechanics, Coecke worked with other collaborators to develop and refine the approach, for example in papers with Ross Duncan, A Graphical Calculus for Quantum Observables¹⁵ and with Eric Oliver Paquette and Dusko Pavlovic, Classical and Quantum Structuralism¹⁶, which introduced to the world new elements of graphical notation, including in a variety of instances, an element called a “spider”. As we shall see shortly, this would subsequently become a central character in the new ZX-calculus.\n\nPicturing difficult concepts\n\nThere is a long tradition of using pictures to explain the complex. When the 17th century Bohemian theologian, Jan Amos Komenský — often called the father of modern education — wanted to grant knowledge to every child in the world, he chose pictures as the most natural, accessible, and immediate medium available. In Komenský’s view, the measure of an education lay not in its curriculum, but in its accessibility to all. “Not the children of the rich or the powerful only,” he wrote, “but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school.”¹⁷\n\nHis book, Orbis Sensualium Pictus (The Visible World in Pictures, 1658), became the first widely printed resource for children, that explained concepts as diverse as bread making, shipbuilding, weather-forecasting, and caring for animals.\n\nKomenský’s grand idea took more than two centuries to be widely adopted, but his instincts were as revolutionary as they were right.\n\nIn this regard, ZX-calculus follows a long tradition. A rapidly growing industrial and educational interest in ZX means pictures might again prove able to offer widespread access to previously closed-off and thereby restricted knowledge.\n\nQuantum mechanics in pictures — a brief history and explanation of ZX-calculus\n\nZX-calculus was formally introduced in a 2009 paper¹⁸ by Coecke (now the Chief Scientist at Quantinuum, a world leader in quantum computing) and Dr Ross Duncan (now Head of Software at Quantinuum) as an intuitive and diagrammatical way of expressing the properties of quantum particles, based on the principles of categorical quantum mechanics and considered from the perspective of quantum information science, which, according to the authors, had “provided a breath of fresh air for quantum foundations research”. Following that introduction, and thanks to the work of a dedicated and growing group of scientists based all over the world, ZX has become increasingly influential and plays an important part in the enormous and continuing growth of interest in quantum computing, particularly in recent years, as working quantum processors have started to emerge.\n\nVariously described as “a graphical language that goes beyond circuit diagrams….(and) ‘splits the atom’ of well known quantum logic gates”¹⁹ and “a rigorous graphical language for reasoning about linear maps between qubits”²⁰, ZX is most easily thought of as a form of mathematics that uses pictures and simple, game-like rules to represent the vital elements of quantum mechanics. It does this by representing the relationship between qubits, which are the basic form of information in quantum information theory and quantum computing. Think of the qubit as the quantum equivalent of a “bit” in classical computing.\n\nZX allows anyone to “play” with quantum processes, (including those that take place when quantum logic gates are applied to qubits as part of a quantum circuit), using string diagrams, mostly made up of small, coloured, counter-like disks with wiry legs. These building blocks, string diagrams with “bodies” and “legs” are called spiders.\n\nThe link with games is important. In classical computing, some of the most impressive breakthroughs can be traced to events inspired by game-play, such as when IBM created a computer that could consistently beat human opponents at chess.²¹ More recently Google’s DeepMind group developed a programme that could play “Go”, a game that for a long time was assumed to be beyond the reach of AI.²² John von Neumann, who played such a central role in formalising quantum mechanics has also been described as “the father of game theory”²³, following the publication in 1928 of On the theory of parlour games (Zur Theorie der Gesellschaftsspiele)²⁴, and later, with Oskar Morgenstern the foundational work, Theory of games and economic behavior²⁵. Von Neumann was also one of the original architects of the classical computer, working alongside another founding father of classical computing, Alan Turing, who in turn used a game as his test for machine intelligence, the Turing Test.²⁶\n\nBuilt into ZX are the necessary mathematical rules (the “calculus”) to handle quantum mechanics. “Doing” mathematics with ZX means using a method known as picturalism, which means playing with and manipulating spiders in diagrams. ZX has been proven mathematically to be universal, sound and complete — in other words, you can reason about and calculate quantum processes as effectively as if you had a university-level of prior mathematical training and were calculating solutions to complex quantum mechanical problems.\n\nZX diagrams are not at all trivial. The green and red (and very occasionally yellow) nodes that are referred to as spiders represent rigorously and accurately the linear maps that define a process that is applied in quantum computers when quantum circuits are implemented. By way of example, the small yellow box in the diagram above is the operator (or fundamental building block) in ZX-calculus that is critical in quantum computing circuits, known as the Hadamard Gate. In traditional mathematics it is represented as a linear map, which, depending on the state of the input qubit, can look like this:\n\nWorking with this notation typically requires special mathematical training, however in ZX all there is to it is that:\n\nIn a breakthrough event in 2017, almost a decade after the formal introduction of ZX-calculus by Coecke and Duncan, the seminal ZX book, Picturing Quantum Processes by Coecke and Dr Aleks Kissinger, was published. Picturing Quantum Processes has become an essential resource for many university-based quantum computing research groups, doctoral and post-doctoral students of quantum information theory, as well as quantum computing professionals. ZX is rapidly being adopted and used for meaningful research to advance quantum computing, for example, in a recent paper²⁹ published by researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University, including Peter W. Shor, a founding father of quantum computing. This paper describes ZX as being “of more interest than ever in fault-tolerant quantum computation and quantum compiler theory” because it can intuitively visualise “the properties of circuits and entanglement”.\n\nVery recently, a new book, Quantum in Pictures by Coecke and Dr Stefano Gogioso (see below) has further distilled ZX into the 5 rules that open the door for almost anyone to get to grips with quantum mechanics and its most important principles. ZX-calculus allows topics such as teleportation and non-locality to become more accessible and easily understood, and even proven from scratch in a small number of “moves”.\n\nBringing quantum mechanics — and the technologies being built on it — to a global audience\n\nEngineering advances in the past two decades mean that quantum computers — based on a computing paradigm that was conceived in the late 1970’s and early 1980’s — are now becoming a reality. Early stage proto-typical quantum computers now proliferate and there is an increasing amount of evidence that they will scale in size and capacity steadily in the next few years. Fault tolerant quantum computers change entirely the way that we approach and solve certain problems, which remain intractable for classical computers. Quantum computers take advantage of the properties and laws of quantum mechanics that are inaccessible to classical devices, and thus address problems in a way that is beyond the reach of classical computers.\n\nIt is for this reason that quantum computers and quantum technologies have been adopted as national strategic priorities by many countries around the world³⁰, and most credible estimates show that the annual expenditure by governments, large corporates and private capital has been many billions of dollars annually for the past few years.\n\nThe reason for this geo-political and investment interest is that quantum computing presents a huge economic and social opportunity. Quantum information technologies suggest we may discover promising new solutions to some of our planet’s most worrying problems and challenges, not only in the development of information technology, but much more widely across fields of chemistry, physics and beyond, leading to improvements in medicine and food production, and dealing with processes that affect climate change.³¹\n\nIn order to take full advantage of this opportunity, and more importantly, to ensure that the benefits of quantum technologies are democratised in the truest sense of the word, there must be a more consistent comprehension among the public of what quantum mechanics means. Technologies such as quantum computing can only benefit humanity as a whole when everyone “has a seat at the table”, and new tools and efforts to close the information gap are a necessity for this understanding to become universal.\n\nZX-calculus provides us with the first generation of such tools, combining comprehensive mathematical power with accessibility.\n\nThe power of accessibility\n\nObserving the rapid growth of quantum picturalism, Professor Coecke has now taken on the mission to show how, using ZX, the most important and useful aspects of quantum mechanics can be understood by anyone with a basic level of mathematical education.\n\nHe and his collaborators believe that giving people direct access to quantum mechanics will have a profound and lasting impact on the way they see the world more generally. Coecke and one of the authors of this article, Ilyas Khan (Founder and CEO of Quantinuum), believe that access to quantum mechanics, and first-hand experience of quantum principles such as uncertainty, entanglement and teleportation could help redefine what is meant by “common sense”.\n\nOne thing has become obvious — by thinking very differently about the mathematics used to reason with quantum mechanics we can turn the most important explanatory theory of our age into an accessible and creative playground — using intuitive methodologies that are engaging and fun.\n\nSidebar: five rules that account for most of quantum mechanics\n\n“Using pictures alone (we will) equip you with the tools you need to understand the quantum world” (Bob Coecke and Stefano Gogioso authors of “Quantum in Pictures”)\n\nIn the book noted above, one of the founders of ZX-calculus, Coecke and his former doctoral student Dr Stefano Gogioso, introduce a game-like process using ZX-calculus. Quantum in Pictures provides anyone with a chance to learn about quantum mechanics, what it tells us about our universe and the nature of reality — and to start to understand how quantum computers work. This is all made possible through the simplicity and completeness of ZX-calculus.\n\nThe five ZX rules used in Quantum in Pictures\n\nZX in the present\n\nZX has proved its importance within many of the world’s leading quantum computing companies, being front and centre in different aspects of their research and experimentation with quantum circuits that are implemented on actual quantum computers. This includes early work in compiling and routing circuits for use in quantum chemistry, quantum computing enhanced cybersecurity, quantum machine learning and quantum natural language processing.\n\nOne of the most compelling examples of this practical application is that Quantinuum’s quantum software development kit TKET, which has been downloaded all over the world more than 900,000 times, and is growing rapidly, has ZX right at the heart of its powerful functionality. In other examples, computer scientists working at Google use ZX to deal with central challenges such as error correction, and companies such as PsiQuantum and Quandela are using it to research and develop optical measurement-based quantum computing. ZX continues to be actively adopted beyond these limited examples.\n\nThe adoption of ZX in research organisations is accelerating too, being substantially used in a growing number of PhD theses and post-doctoral research papers from universities such as Oxford University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Imperial College London, and Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität; as well as the Universities of Cambridge, Lorraine, Tokyo, and Marseille, and institutions such as NASA. A whole generation of quantum computing experts who are familiar with and proponents of ZX-calculus are coming to the fore, and the annual rate of papers published on the arXiv pre-print repository that cite ZX has doubled every single year for the past six years.³²\n\nQuantum computing is yet to be given any serious consideration within high school education³³ but ZX could change that too, over time. Through educational books that utilise ZX it will be possible to broaden and deepen our understanding of quantum mechanics. Just as regular computer science is now studied by high school students, quantum mechanics and quantum computing might be taken up in the future.\n\nIn this respect, ZX offers us a helping hand in understanding aspects of quantum mechanics from quantum foundations all the way through to quantum computing.\n\nWhat next?\n\nThe publication of Quantum in Pictures will accelerate public engagement with the most profound and important thoughts and ideas ever devised to describe the nature of the universe. Einstein, Bohr, Schrödinger, and Heisenberg did not agree on what quantum mechanics revealed to us about the universe³⁴, but they knew it challenged many beliefs that had been widely held and taught for thousands of years throughout human history.\n\nA more recent public scientific intellectual, Carl Sagan, in a 1996 interview with American journalist Charlie Rose, said presciently, “We’ve arranged a society based on science and technology, in which nobody understands anything about science and technology.” He followed this with a challenge: “And this combustible mixture of ignorance and power, sooner or later, is going to blow up in our faces. Who is running the science and technology in a democracy if the people don’t know anything about it?”³⁵\n\nZX gives us access to the “what” of quantum mechanics and importantly, given the pace of technological development in the field, it offers the public the opportunity to consider the “what” of quantum computing too.\n\nBy engaging with these issues, through books such as Quantum in Pictures, ZX also offers all of us a chance to gain personal insight into the “why” of quantum mechanics, the question that continues to elude us. For those of us who are not trained scientists, it helps us to close the gap that has affected quantum physics for a century, and it can help in the bigger challenge to make sure that the progress and benefits of quantum computing will be available to everyone.\n\nConclusion\n\nThomas Kuhn, in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions sought to explain why human understanding, throughout history, progresses in fits and starts.³⁶ Rather than a smooth process of new ideas surpassing older ones in their explanatory power, there are linguistic and social forces at play, which first resist the necessity for a new system of understanding, and then produce Kuhn’s famous “paradigm shifts,” which are so rapid and so complete, that sometimes the preceding theories and the language they employed may be lost entirely.\n\nThe period between 1895 and 1945 represents a period of paradigm shifts across multiple scientific domains. Abraham Pais, in Inward Bound, a history of particle physics, recounts how it was not individual phenomena that required new explanations based on observations and experiments made during that period, but entire fields of science that required complete rewriting as theories and discoveries cascaded relentlessly, decade after decade:\n\n“Part I of this book begins in 1895, when none of the fundamental particles […] had yet been found, cosmic rays had not been discovered, the only accelerator in captivity was the cathode ray tube, and relativity theory and quantum theory were yet to come. It ends in 1945 when physicists had become familiar with the electron, the proton, the neutron, a neutrino, and a meson, when cosmic rays were ardently studied, when cyclotrons had produced particles with energies larger than 10 MeV, and when the first explorations of relativistic quantum field theories had yielded a puzzling mixture of success and failure.”³⁷\n\nParadigm shifts in the physical sciences continue to occur, with quantum mechanics being joined by theories of quantum fields, quantum chromodynamics and supersymmetry. But as Kuhn argues, one of the most important features of a paradigm shift is the change in language that accompanies it, and allows scientists — and, we would argue, society as a whole — to engage with the systems and theories of the new paradigm.\n\nIn this context, ZX-calculus is best thought of as a critical piece of a puzzle that was missing for over a century in the paradigm shift from classical to quantum explanations of the physical world. Up to now, without access to the language required to reason about quantum phenomena, non-scientists have been very largely excluded from the dialogue. The gap between understanding the science, and understanding how the resulting technologies might be applied, was simply too big.\n\nOne of the most important consequences of ZX-calculus therefore, is that quantum physics can be made far more accessible than it has been in the past. In turn, this increases the potential of quantum technologies such as quantum computing to be better appreciated by as many people as possible — and therein lies the key to unlocking the full potential of the revolutionary change in the computing and AI landscape that is unfolding before us."
