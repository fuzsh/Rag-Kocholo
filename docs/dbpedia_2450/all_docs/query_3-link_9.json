        "text": "When Gauss died in 1855, his post at Göttingen was taken by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet. One mathematician who found the presence of Dirichlet a stimulus to research was Bernhard Riemann, and his few short contributions to mathematics were among the most influential of the century. Riemann’s first paper, his doctoral thesis (1851) on the theory of complex functions, provided the foundations for a geometric treatment of functions of a complex variable. His main result guaranteed the existence of a wide class of complex functions satisfying only modest general requirements and so made it clear that complex functions could be expected to occur widely in mathematics. More important, Riemann achieved this result by yoking together the theory of complex functions with the theory of harmonic functions and with potential theory. The theories of complex and harmonic functions were henceforth inseparable.\n\nRecent News\n\nRiemann then wrote on the theory of Fourier series and their integrability. His paper was directly in the tradition that ran from Cauchy and Fourier to Dirichlet, and it marked a considerable step forward in the precision with which the concept of integral can be defined. In 1854 he took up a subject that much interested Gauss, the hypotheses lying at the basis of geometry.\n\nThe study of geometry has always been one of the central concerns of mathematicians. It was the language, and the principal subject matter, of Greek mathematics, was the mainstay of elementary education in the subject, and has an obvious visual appeal. It seems easy to apply, for one can proceed from a base of naively intelligible concepts. In keeping with the general trends of the century, however, it was just the naive concepts that Riemann chose to refine. What he proposed as the basis of geometry was far more radical and fundamental than anything that had gone before.\n\nRiemann took his inspiration from Gauss’s discovery that the curvature of a surface is intrinsic, and he argued that one should therefore ignore Euclidean space and treat each surface by itself. A geometric property, he argued, was one that was intrinsic to the surface. To do geometry, it was enough to be given a set of points and a way of measuring lengths along curves in the surface. For this, traditional ways of applying the calculus to the study of curves could be made to suffice. But Riemann did not stop with surfaces. He proposed that geometers study spaces of any dimension in this spirit—even, he said, spaces of infinite dimension.\n\nSeveral profound consequences followed from this view. It dethroned Euclidean geometry, which now became just one of many geometries. It allowed the geometry of Bolyai and Lobachevsky to be recognized as the geometry of a surface of constant negative curvature, thus resolving doubts about the logical consistency of their work. It highlighted the importance of intrinsic concepts in geometry. It helped open the way to the study of spaces of many dimensions. Last but not least, Riemann’s work ensured that any investigation of the geometric nature of physical space would thereafter have to be partly empirical. One could no longer say that physical space is Euclidean because there is no geometry but Euclid’s. This realization finally destroyed any hope that questions about the world could be answered by a priori reasoning.\n\nIn 1857 Riemann published several papers applying his very general methods for the study of complex functions to various parts of mathematics. One of these papers solved the outstanding problem of extending the theory of elliptic functions to the integration of any algebraic function. It opened up the theory of complex functions of several variables and showed how Riemann’s novel topological ideas were essential in the study of complex functions. (In subsequent lectures Riemann showed how the special case of the theory of elliptic functions could be regarded as the study of complex functions on a torus.)\n\nIn another paper Riemann dealt with the question of how many prime numbers are less than any given number x. The answer is a function of x, and Gauss had conjectured on the basis of extensive numerical evidence that this function was approximately x/ln(x). This turned out to be true, but it was not proved until 1896, when both Charles-Jean de la Vallée Poussin of Belgium and Jacques-Salomon Hadamard of France independently proved it. It is remarkable that a question about integers led to a discussion of functions of a complex variable, but similar connections had previously been made by Dirichlet. Riemann took the expression Π(1 − p−s)−1 = Σn−s, introduced by Euler the century before, where the infinite product is taken over all prime numbers p and the sum over all whole numbers n, and treated it as a function of s. The infinite sum makes sense whenever s is real and greater than 1. Riemann proceeded to study this function when s is complex (now called the Riemann zeta function), and he thereby not only helped clarify the question of the distribution of primes but also was led to several other remarks that later mathematicians were to find of exceptional interest. One remark has continued to elude proof and remains one of the greatest conjectures in mathematics: the claim that the nonreal zeros of the zeta function are complex numbers whose real part is always equal to 1/2.\n\nRiemann’s influence\n\nIn 1859 Dirichlet died and Riemann became a full professor, but he was already ill with tuberculosis, and in 1862 his health broke. He died in 1866. His work, however, exercised a growing influence on his successors. His work on trigonometric series, for example, led to a deepening investigation of the question of when a function is integrable. Attention was concentrated on the nature of the sets of points at which functions and their integrals (when these existed) had unexpected properties. The conclusions that emerged were at first obscure, but it became clear that some properties of point sets were important in the theory of integration, while others were not. (These other properties proved to be a vital part of the emerging subject of topology.) The properties of point sets that matter in integration have to do with the size of the set. If one can change the values of a function on a set of points without changing its integral, it is said that the set is of negligible size. The naive idea is that integrating is a generalization of counting: negligible sets do not need to be counted. About the turn of the century the French mathematician Henri-Léon Lebesgue managed to systematize this naive idea into a new theory about the size of sets, which included integration as a special case. In this theory, called measure theory, there are sets that can be measured, and they either have positive measure or are negligible (they have zero measure), and there are sets that cannot be measured at all.\n\nThe first success for Lebesgue’s theory was that, unlike the Cauchy-Riemann integral, it obeyed the rule that if a sequence of functions fn(x) tends suitably to a function f(x), then the sequence of integrals ∫fn(x)dx tends to the integral ∫f(x)dx. This has made it the natural theory of the integral when dealing with questions about trigonometric series. (See the figure.) Another advantage is that it is very general. For example, in probability theory it is desirable to estimate the likelihood of certain outcomes of an experiment. By imposing a measure on the space of all possible outcomes, the Russian mathematician Andrey Kolmogorov was the first to put probability theory on a rigorous mathematical footing.\n\nAnother example is provided by a remarkable result discovered by the 20th-century American mathematician Norbert Wiener: within the set of all continuous functions on an interval, the set of differentiable functions has measure zero. In probabilistic terms, therefore, the chance that a function taken at random is differentiable has probability zero. In physical terms, this means that, for example, a particle moving under Brownian motion almost certainly is moving on a nondifferentiable path. This discovery clarified Albert Einstein’s fundamental ideas about Brownian motion (displayed by the continual motion of specks of dust in a fluid under the constant bombardment of surrounding molecules). The hope of physicists is that Richard Feynman’s theory of quantum electrodynamics will yield to a similar measure-theoretic treatment, for it has the disturbing aspect of a theory that has not been made rigorous mathematically but accords excellently with observation.\n\nYet another setting for Lebesgue’s ideas was to be the theory of Lie groups. The Hungarian mathematician Alfréd Haar showed how to define the concept of measure so that functions defined on Lie groups could be integrated. This became a crucial part of Hermann Weyl’s way of representing a Lie group as acting linearly on the space of all (suitable) functions on the group (for technical reasons, suitable means that the square of the function is integrable with respect to a Haar measure on the group)."
