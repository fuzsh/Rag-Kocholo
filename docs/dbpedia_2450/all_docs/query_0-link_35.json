        "text": "*****\n\nPaul Verlaine is one of the most famous French poets of the 19th century. He was born in 1844 and died in 1896. His first book of poetry appeared when he was only 22, and during his lifetime. he published nearly 20 collections of poetry. Although he did not receive much acclaim early in his career, he was pronounced ‘Prince of Poets’ in 1894, shortly before he died.\n\n*****\n\nPeter Shor is a professor in the Mathematics Department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has loved poetry since his father read poems to him as a child. He has written poetry sporadically for the last forty years, and recently has started translating it. The only poem he has published so far was in one about a mathematician, published in a recreational mathematics magazine, The Mathematical Intelligencer.\n\n*****\n\nINTRODUCTION • POEMS\n\n*****\n\nOne of the defining episodes of Paul Verlaine’s life took place between 1871 and 1873. In 1870, he had married Mathilde Mauté, who was only seventeen years old at the time. A year later, he received a letter from Arthur Rimbaud that contained several remarkable poems, and he invited Rimbaud to come visit him in Paris. Not long after Rimbaud arrived, he and Verlaine entered into a passionate affair. In 1872, Verlaine left his wife and young child in Paris and traveled with Rimbaud to Belgium and then England. This episode came to an end in 1873, when Verlaine shot Rimbaud in the wrist during a drunken argument. Verlaine was sentenced to two years in prison for attempted murder. In prison, he reconverted to Catholicism and wrote poetry, eventually earning an early release for good behavior. When he got out of prison, neither Arthur Rimbaud nor Mathilde was interested in continuing their relationship with him.\n\nVerlaine’s life did not proceed smoothly after his release from jail. In 1880, together with a former student of his, Lucien Létinois, he bought a farm, and started farming it. The enterprise was a failure, and two years later Verlaine had to sell the farm. Less than a year after that, his beloved companion, Létinois, died of typhoid fever. Verlaine, who had always had problems with drug abuse and alcoholism, eventually became a confirmed drug addict and alcoholic, and eventually died, destitute and in ill health.\n\n*****\n\nAbout these translations:\n\nPaul Verlaine was given to experimenting with new techniques in his poetry. For example, while the common meters in classical French poetry all use lines of even length — twelve, eight, and ten syllables — Paul Verlaine often used odd-length lines — five, seven, nine, eleven, and even thirteen syllables. Some of his poems are sonorant with internal rhymes, and some of his poems have repeated phrases or grammatical parallelism, used to great effect. In these translations, I have tried to preserve some of these aspects, something thatnot all previous translators have done. More specifically, in ‘Love’s Shards’, I have used a pattern of repeated phrases that is close to the original pattern, while in ‘I came, calm orphan’, I have kept the original grammatical parallelism between the last lines of the verses.In some of Verlaine’s poems, there are a number of little hints that, when all taken together, reveal what the poem is about. I believe this is true of ‘Green”, and that ‘sweet moments and splendid storm (‘les chers instants’ and ‘la bonne tempête’) are two of these hints. While you probably don’t need these hints to figure out what happens between the second and third verses, I have nonetheless tried to preserve these hints as accurately as possible in my translation.\n\nTwo of these poems, ‘The sun gently warms and bathes in golden light’ and ‘Madrigal’, were written to Paul Verlaine’s wife, Mathide Mauté: the first of these appears in the collection, La Bonne Chanson, written for Mathilde before they were married. While it appears that Verlaine was genuinely in love with Mathilde when he wrote La Bonne Chanson, ‘Madrigal’ seems to have been written after Verlaine’s first flush of love for Mathilde faded. It was first published in 1883, although it quite likely was written some years before then. I have untangled the convoluted word order in the last part of ‘Madrigal’. Two more comments on this poem: the name Mouse Princess (Princesse Souris) was one of Verlaine’s pet names for Mathilde, and there is an untranslatable play on words in the last two lines; in French, a ‘deaf’ sound is one that is muffled or faint, and not, as Verlaine seems to imply, one that can only be heard by deaf people.\n\nThe last two of these poems, ‘I came, calm orphan’ and ‘Over the Water’, were written in prison. These poems were originally slated to be published in Cellulairement, a collection of poems written in prison; however, Verlaine canceled its publication and distributed the poems over several other volumes. Any interpretation of ‘Over the Water’ should probably take into account where it was written. The poem ‘I came, calm orphan’ also has a connection to prisons: its subject is Gaspar Hauser, who was a teenager who appeared mysteriously in Nuremberg, Germany in 1828, claiming that he had previously been imprisoned in a dark cell for as long as he could remember.\n\n*****\n\nNB: You can listen to the poems read in French if you click on the French titles. [Ed.]\n\n*****\n\nPaul Verlaine: Six Poems translated by Peter Shor\n\nLOVE’S SHARDS\n\nThe wind the other evening laid Love low,\n\nWho stood in the park’s most mysterious corner;\n\nFor an entire day he made us ponder\n\nOn how he grinned and wickedly bent his bow.\n\nThe wind the other evening felled him, the marble\n\nScattered to the morning breezes. It’s a shame\n\nTo see the base, on which the artist’s name\n\nCan just be made out, shaded by an arbor.\n\nOh, it’s a shame to see the empty base\n\nSo lonesome there. And coursing through my psyche\n\nAre dismal futures that now seem all too likely,\n\nWhere I must, all alone, great troubles face.\n\nOh, it’s a shame! And you—do you, too, shudder\n\nInwardly, even though your frivolous eye\n\nFollows a gold and purple butterfly\n\nFluttering above Love’s shards and the wind’s clutter?\n\n*\n\nL’amour par terre\n\nLe vent de l’autre nuit a jeté bas l’Amour\n\nQui, dans le coin le plus mystérieux du parc,\n\nSouriait en bandant malignement son arc,\n\nEt dont l’aspect nous fit tant songer tout un jour !\n\nLe vent de l’autre nuit l’a jeté bas ! Le marbre\n\nAu souffle du matin tournoie, épars. C’est triste\n\nDe voir le piédestal, où le nom de l’artiste\n\nSe lit péniblement parmi l’ombre d’un arbre.\n\nOh ! c’est triste de voir debout le piédestal\n\nTout seul ! Et des pensers mélancoliques vont\n\nEt viennent dans mon rêve où le chagrin profond\n\nÉvoque un avenir solitaire et fatal.\n\nOh ! c’est triste ! – Et toi-même, est-ce pas ? es touchée\n\nD’un si dolent tableau, bien que ton œil frivole\n\nS’amuse au papillon de pourpre et d’or qui vole\n\nAu-dessus des débris dont l’allée est jonchée.\n\n***\n\nTHE SUN GENTLY WARMS AND BATHES IN GOLDEN LIGHT\n\nThe sun gently warms and bathes in golden light\n\nSparkling with morning dew, the rye and wheat,\n\nAnd the blue has kept its freshness from the night.\n\nOne leaves without a goal except to leave,\n\nFollowing the river through waves of yellow grass\n\nOn paths of turf lined with old alder trees.\n\nThe air is crisp. Now and then a bird flies past\n\nWith wisps of straw or berries in its beak;\n\nIts reflection in the water lags behind.\n\nThat’s all.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxExcept the rambler loves these scenes;\n\nIn this clear and gentle countryside, he finds\n\nHis dream of happiness caressed, and sees\n\nThe charming image of a girl in his mind,\n\nSinging and scintillating, a bright dream\n\nThat the man holds dear and that the poet extols,\n\nEvoking in his thoughts, as a smile sweeps\n\nAcross his face, the Partner he has found at last, the soul\n\nFor which his soul eternally yearns and weeps.\n\n*\n\nLe soleil du matin doucement chauffe et dore\n\nLe soleil du matin doucement chauffe et dore\n\nLes seigles et les blés tout humides encore,\n\nEt l’azur a gardé sa fraîcheur de la nuit.\n\nL’on sort sans autre but que de sortir ; on suit,\n\nLe long de la rivière aux vagues herbes jaunes,\n\nUn chemin de gazon que bordent de vieux aunes.\n\nL’air est vif. Par moments un oiseau vole avec\n\nQuelque fruit de la haie ou quelque paille au bec,\n\nEt son reflet dans l’eau survit à son passage.\n\nC’est tout.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxMais le songeur aime ce paysage\n\nDont la claire douceur a soudain caressé\n\nSon rêve de bonheur adorable, et bercé\n\nLe souvenir charmant de cette jeune fille,\n\nBlanche apparition qui chante et qui scintille,\n\nDont rêve le poète et que l’homme chérit,\n\nÉvoquant en ses vœux dont peut-être on sourit\n\nLa Compagne qu’enfin il a trouvée, et l’âme\n\nQue son âme depuis toujours pleure et réclame.\n\n***\n\nMADRIGAL\n\nIn those white autumn days, you caused me much distress,\n\nFor in your eyes there shone the animal,\n\nAnd you gnawed on me, little Mouse Princess,\n\nWith the sharp eyetooth of your smile.\n\nNoble girl who set my agony ablaze\n\nWith rancid oil from old tears you had shed,\n\nYes, you fool, I would have died of your damned gaze,\n\nBut the pond sleeps down there, unsuspected,\n\nAnd its still water has drunk the winds that flow\n\nFrom the tall mast of the lily, boat that should have had high praise,\n\nSo now (you know you want to) go,\n\nJump in, paddle! I’ll ask forgiveness with so soft a word\n\nThat only were you deaf could it be heard.\n\n*\n\nMadrigal\n\nTu m’as, ces pâles jours d’automne blanc, fait mal\n\nA cause de tes yeux où fleurit l’animal,\n\nEt tu me rongerais, en princesse Souris,\n\nDu bout fin de la quenotte de ton souris.\n\nFille auguste qui fis flamboyer ma douleur\n\nAvec l’huile rancie encor de ton vieux pleur!\n\nOui, folle, je mourrais de ton regard damné.\n\nMais va (veux-tu?) l’étang là dort insoupçonné\n\nDont du lis, nef qu’il eût fallu qu’on acclamât,\n\nL’eau morte a bu le vent qui coule du grand mât\n\nT’y jeter, palme! et d’avance mon repentir\n\nParle si bas qu’il faut être sourd pour l’ouïr.\n\n***\n\nGREEN\n\nHere is some fruit, some flowers, some branches and some leaves.\n\nAnd here, too, is my heart, that only beats for you.\n\nDo not tear it apart with your two pale hands,\n\nBut in your eyes, so lovely, may my small gift seem good.\n\nI arrive on your doorstep still drenched in morning dew\n\nThat the brisk dawn breezes have frozen to my face.\n\nPermit my fatigue, lying at your feet,\n\nTo dream of those sweet moments that reinvigorate.\n\nThe echoes of your last kisses are still ringing in my head;\n\nAllow it to roll upon your soft young breast,\n\nSo it can find some peace after the splendid storm,\n\nAnd I can sleep a little while you rest.\n\n*\n\nGreen\n\nVoici des fruits, des fleurs, des feuilles et des branches.\n\nEt puis voici mon cœur, qui ne bat que pour vous.\n\nNe le déchirez pas avec vos deux mains blanches\n\nEt qu’à vos yeux si beaux l’humble présent soit doux.\n\nJ’arrive tout couvert encore de rosée\n\nQue le vent du matin vient glacer à mon front.\n\nSouffrez que ma fatigue, à vos pieds reposée,\n\nRêve des chers instants qui la délasseront.\n\nSur votre jeune sein laissez rouler ma tête\n\nToute sonore encore de vos derniers baisers ;\n\nLaissez-la s’apaiser de la bonne tempête,\n\nEt que je dorme un peu puisque vous reposez.\n\n***\n\nI CAME, CALM ORPHAN\n\nGaspard Hauser sings:\n\nI came, calm orphan with no riches,\n\nSave only for my tranquil eyes,\n\nTo the men living in big cities.\n\nThey did not think me clever.\n\nAt twenty, yet another trouble\n\nUnder the name of love’s fever\n\nMade me find women beautiful.\n\nThey did not find me handsome.\n\nThough nobody would call me brave\n\nAnd I have neither king nor country,\n\nI went to war to find a grave.\n\nDeath did not want me, either.\n\nWas I born too early or too late?\n\nWhat am I doing in this world?\n\nI tell you all, I am desperate—\n\nSay a prayer for poor Gaspard.\n\n*\n\nJe suis venu, calme orphelin\n\nGaspard Hauser chante :\n\nJe suis venu, calme orphelin\n\nRiche de mes seuls yeux tranquilles,\n\nVers les hommes des grandes villes :\n\nIls ne m’ont pas trouvé malin.\n\nÀ vingt ans un trouble nouveau,\n\nSous le nom d’amoureuses flammes\n\nM’a fait trouver belles les femmes :\n\nElles ne m’ont pas trouvé beau.\n\nBien que sans patrie et sans roi\n\nEt très brave ne l’étant guère,\n\nJ’ai voulu mourir à la guerre :\n\nLa mort n’a pas voulu de moi.\n\nSuis-je né trop tôt ou trop tard ?\n\nQu’est-ce que je fais en ce monde ?\n\nÔ vous tous, ma peine est profonde :\n\nPriez pour le pauvre Gaspard !\n\n***\n\nOVER THE WATER\n\nI do not know why\n\nBitter thoughts take me\n\nTo fly on troubled and crazed wings above the sea.\n\nAll I hold dear,\n\nWith wings of fear\n\nMy love enfolds upon the waves. Why? Why?\n\nGull in melancholy flight\n\nFollowing the swells, my spirit,\n\nBuffeted by every wind,\n\nTurning when the tide slants in,\n\nGull in melancholy flight.\n\nDrunk on the sun’s rays\n\nAnd on liberty\n\nAn instinct guides it across this immensity.\n\nThe summer breeze\n\nOver crimson seas\n\nCarries it gently in a warm half-daze.\n\nSometimes it cries so sorrowfully\n\nThat it alarms the far-off pilot.\n\nIt lets the wind take it, and soars, and stalls,\n\nAnd plummets, then, wings wrenched in the fall,\n\nFlies again, crying so sorrowfully.\n\nI do not know why\n\nBitter thoughts take me\n\nTo fly on troubled and crazed wings above the sea.\n\nAll I hold dear,\n\nWith wings of fear\n\nMy love enfolds upon the waves. Why? Why?\n\n*\n\nSur les eaux\n\nJe ne sais pourquoi\n\nMon esprit amer\n\nD’une aile inquiète et folle vole sur la mer,\n\nTout ce qui m’est cher,\n\nD’une aile d’effroi\n\nMon amour le couve au ras des flots. Pourquoi, pourquoi ?\n\nMouette à l’essor mélancolique.\n\nElle suit la vague, ma pensée,\n\nÀ tous les vents du ciel balancée\n\nEt biaisant quand la marée oblique,\n\nMouette à l’essor mélancolique.\n\nIvre de soleil\n\nEt de liberté,\n\nUn instinct la guide à travers cette immensité.\n\nLa brise d’été\n\nSur le flot vermeil\n\nDoucement la porte en un tiède demi-sommeil.\n\nParfois si tristement elle crie\n\nQu’elle alarme au lointain le pilote\n\nPuis au gré du vent se livre et flotte\n\nEt plonge, et l’aile toute meurtrie\n\nRevole, et puis si tristement crie !\n\nJe ne sais pourquoi\n\nMon esprit amer\n\nD’une aile inquiète et folle vole sur la mer.\n\nTout ce qui m’est cher,\n\nD’une aile d’effroi\n\nMon amour le couve au ras des flots. Pourquoi, pourquoi ?"
