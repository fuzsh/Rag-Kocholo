        "text": "He is quite famous; at forty, he discovered\n\nA law for the distribution of the size\n\nOf gaps between consecutive prime numbers,\n\nAnd for this work, he won the Abel Prize.\n\nSo all his friends try to dissuade him gently\n\nFrom announcing he has proved Goldbach was right;\n\nHis colleagues listen to his talk intently,\n\nAnd laugh at him when he is out of sight.\n\nFor the fact is that proof is an addiction,\n\nAnd it doesn’t matter if you’re right or wrong;\n\nWhat matters is the absolute conviction\n\nThat you’ve found something no one has ever known.\n\nThe basic idea originally came from my realizing that the thrill of discovery is just as exciting with an incorrect proof as with a correct one, and wondering whether this is what motivates some of the cranks who send mathematicians their proofs of the Riemann hypothesis, \\(\\text{P}\\ne \\text{NP}\\), the continuum hypothesis, and so forth. The thrill of discovery is one of the things that motivates me, so if I ever start acting this way, please accept this poem as my apology in advance.\n\nOn reading this poem, you may believe that you can identify the person who inspired it. However, you are likely to be only partly right—I had more than one person in mind when I wrote it."
