        "text": "(Inspired by Pat Sajak stepping down from Wheel of Fortune)\n\nHow many different game show are there? Many. How many could there be?\n\n1) Based on Knowledge or something else. Jeopardy is knowledge. Wheel and Deal-No Deal are something else. The oddest are Family Feud and America Says where you have to guess what people said which might not be whats true. Reminds me of the SNL sketch about a fictional game show Common Knowledge. Oddly enough there now is a REAL game show of that name, but it actually wants true answers to questions.\n\n2) Do the losers get anything more than some min? On Wheel they do, but I do not know of any other show where they do. On People Puzzler they get a subscription to People Magazine!\n\n3) Is how much the winners win based on how well they do in the game, or is it a flat number. Jeop and Wheel is based on how they do in the game. America Says, Switch, and many others the winner does something else do either win (say) $10,000 or just $1,000.\n\n4) MONEY: I want to say can you win A LOT or NOT SO MUCH. I'll set $20,000 above or below. ON Jeop or Wheel you CAN get > $20.000. As noted in the above item there are shows where at the end you can win $10,000 but that's it.\n\n5) Do winners get to come back the next day? Jeop and Masterminds does that but I do not know of any other show that does.\n\n6) Are celebrities involved? This used to be more common, but seems to have faded. Hollywood Squares was an example. Masterminds is hard to classify in this regard since the celebs are people who know a lot of stuff (they are called Masterminds) and their main claim to fame might be being on Mastermind. Or on some other quiz show. Ken Jennings was a Mastermind in the first season.\n\n7) If its question-based then is it multiple choice or fill in the blank? Some do both. Common Knowledge has the first round multiple choice, and later rounds fill-in-the-blank, and the finale is multiple-choice.\n\n8) Do you win money or merchandise? There are many combinations of the two.\n\n9) Are the players teams-of-3? (Common Knowledge), Individuals (Jeopardy), just one person or team (Deal-No Deal and Cash Cab), or something else.\n\n10) Is it a competition so people vs people (most of the quiz shows) or is it one person answering questions (Who wants to be a Millionaire, Cash Cab). I've noticed that on Cash Cab if you are close to the answer they give it to you, which I don't think hey would do on Jeop. This could be because there is no competitor, so being flexible is not unfair to someone else. Millionaire can't do this since its strictly multiple choice.\n\nThere are other parameters but I will stop here. I leave it to the reader to more fully expand these categories and find out how many game shows there can be.\n\nI was wondering what the hardest math problems were, and how to define it. So I googled\n\nHardest Math Problems\n\nThe first hit is here. The 10 problems given there bring up the question of what is meant by hard?\n\nI do not think the order they problems were given is an indication of hardness. Then again, they seem to implicitly use many definitions of hardness\n\n1) The 4-color problem. It required a computer to solve it and had lots of cases. But even if that is why its considered hard, the solution to the Kepler Conjecture (see here) is harder. And, of course, its possible that either of these may get simpler proofs (the 4-color theorem already has, though it still needs a computer).\n\n2) Fermat's Last Theorem. Open a long time, used lots of hard math, so that makes sense.\n\n3) The Monty Hall Paradox. Really? If hard means confusing to most people and even some mathematicians then yes, its hard. But on a list of the 10 hardest math problems of all time? I think not.\n\n4) The Traveling Salesperson problem. If they mean resolving P vs NP then yes, its hard. If they mean finding a poly time algorithm for TSP then it may be impossible.\n\n5) The Twin Primes Conjecture. Yes that one is hard. Open a long time and the Sieve method is known to NOT be able to solve it. There is a song about it here.\n\n6) The Poincare Conjecture. Yes, that was hard before it was solved. Its still hard. This is another issue with the list- they mix together SOLVED and UNSOLVED problems.\n\n7) The Goldbach Conjecture. Yes, that one is hard.\n\n8) The Riemann hypothesis is the only problem on both Hilbert's 23 problems in 1900 and on the Clay prize list. Respect! There is a song about it here.\n\n9) The Collatz conjecture. Hard but this might not be a good problem. Fermat was a good problem since working on it lead to math of interest even before it was solved. Riemann is a good problem since we really want to know it. Collatz has not lead to that much math of interest and the final result is not that interesting.\n\n10) Navier-Stokes and Smoothness. Hard! Note that its a Millennium problem.\n\nNOTES\n\n1) TSP, Poincare, Riemann, Navier-Stokes are all Millennium problems. While that's fine, it also means that there are some Millennium problems that were not included: The Hodge Conjecture, The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, Yang-Mills and the Mass gap (thats one problem: YM and the Mass gap). These three would be hard to explain to a layperson.Yang Mills and the Mass Gap is a good name for a rock band.\n\n2) Four have been solved (4-color, FLT, Monty Hall (which was never open), Poincare) and six have not been solved (TSP, Twin primes, Goldbach, RH, Collatz, Navier-Stokes)\n\n3) I have also asked the web for the longest amount of time between a problem being posed and solved. FLT seems to be the winner with 358 years, though I think the number is too precise since it not quite clear when it was posed. I have another candidate but you might not want to count it: The Greek Constructions of trisecting an angle, duplicating the cube, and squaring the circle. The problem is that the statement:\n\nIn 400BC the Greeks posed the question: Prove or Disprove that one can trisect an angle with a ruler and compass\n\nis false on many level:\n\na) Nobody thought of prove or disprove back in 400BC (and that date is to precise).\n\nb) Why would a compass, which helps you find where North is, help you with this problem?\n\n(ADDED LATER: Some of the comments indicate that people do not know that point b is a joke. Perhaps not a good joke, but a joke.)\n\nSO, when was it POSED in the modern sense is much harder to say. For more on this problem see the book Tales of Impossibility or read my review of it here.\n\n(ADDED LATER: A comment pointed out that the constructing a trisection (and duplicating a cube and squaring the circuit) were proven impossible. I knew that but forgot to say it., and make the point of the very long time between posing and solving, so I will elaborate here:\n\n1837: Wantzel showed that there is no way to, with a straightedge and compass, trisect an angle or duplicate the cute. This used Field Theory.\n\n1882: Lindemann showed pi was transcendental and hence there is no straightedge and compass construction to square the circle.\n\nSo one could say it took 1882+400 years to solve the problem, but as noted above, to say the problem was posed in 400BC is not really right.)\n\n4) Songs are needed for the other problems on this list UNION the Millennium problem. The Hodge Conjecture would be a challenge. I DID see some songs on You Tube that claimed to be about some of these problems, but they weren't. Some were instrumentals and some seemed to have no connection to the math.\n\n5) Other lists I've seen include:\n\na) Prove there are no odd perfect numbers. That seems to be hard. This could have been posed before FLT was posed, but its hard to say.\n\nb) Prove the following are transcendental: pi + e, the Euler-Mascheroni. There are other open problems here as well.\n\nThese lists make me think more carefully about what I mean by HARD and PROBLEM and even MATH.\n\nIn response to my blog post about how its easier to FIND novelty songs (and other things) than it used to be (see here) Lance showed how easy it is to CREATE a novelty song using AI. He had an AI write lyrics and music for THE BILL, see here.\n\nThe song is pretty good and pretty accurate (except that I don't drink coffee or burn toast and I would not say that in math I'm quite the star), but this post is NOT about the song.\n\nThere have been songs about\n\nThe Mandelbrot set (see here),\n\nLobachevsky (see here),\n\nGauss's Law (see here),\n\nGalois (see here),\n\nThe Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem (see here),\n\nWilliam Rowan Hamilton (see here),\n\nand I will end this list with the Newton-Leibniz Rap (see here).\n\n(I am sure there are more songs about famous mathematicians. If you know any that are better than the BW Rap, that is, any of them, please leave a comment.)\n\nSide note: There are poems about Fermat's last theorem, as discussed in my post here.\n\nSo what do Mandelbrot, Lobachevsky, Gauss, Galois, Bolzano, Weierstrass, Hamilton, Newton, Leibniz, and Fermat have in common?\n\nThey are all famous and for a good reason- they all did math worth doing that is remembered many years later.\n\nBill Gasarch- not so much (unless the Muffin Problem is the key to solving world hunger).\n\nIn the past the EFFORT to write a song about someone was enough so that one would only bother for famous people.\n\nWith AI it is now EASY, as Lance did with his song THE BILL. He used ChatGPT for the lyrics and Suno for the song itself.\n\nSo what does this say about the future? It will be so easy to write songs about ANYBODY that it will be done. So having a song about you will no longer be a sign that you are famous or special. We are RIGHT NOW in a transition. If I tell my nephew that there is a song about me and that I have a Wikipedia page, he is impressed. My great niece- not so much.\n\nOn June 21, 1993, at the Issac Newton Institute for Mathematical Science, Andrew Wiles announced that he had proven Fermat's Last Theorem. That wasn't quite right- there was a hole in the proof that was later patched up with the help of Richard Taylor (his former grad student). A correct proof was submitted in 1994 and appeared in 1995. Wiles is the sole author.\n\nJune 21, 2024 was the 31st anniversary of the announcement. (So today is the 31-years and 1-month anniversary). I COULD have had ChatGPT write some poems about it. But there is no need. There are already some very nice poems about it written by humans. Will humans eventually lose the ability to write such things? Would that be a bad thing? Either ponder those questions or just enjoy the poems. (My spellcheck still thinks ChatGPT is not a word. It needs to get with the times.)\n\n1) A link to a set of poems about FLT: here.\n\n2) Here is a poem that is not in that set but is excellent.\n\nA challenge for many long ages\n\nHad baffled the savants and sages\n\nYet at last came the light\n\nSeems that Fermat was right\n\nTo the margins add 200 pages\n\n(I don't know who wrote this or even where I read it. If you know anything about where it was published or who wrote it, please let me know. ADDED LATER:Eric Angelini left a comment telling me that this limerick was written by Paul Robert Chernoff. The commets also has a link to lots of limericks that Paul Robert Chernoff wrote. Thanks!)\n\n3) Here is a poem by Jonathan Harvey that mentions the gap in the original proof.\n\nA mathematician named Wiles\n\nHad papers stacked in large piles\n\nSince he saw a clue\n\nHe could show Fermat true\n\nMixing many mathematical styles\n\nHe labored in search of the light\n\nTo find the crucial insight\n\nYoung Andrew, it seems\n\nHad childhood dreams\n\nTo prove Mr. Fermat was right\n\nHe studied for seven long years\n\nExpending much blood, sweat, and tears\n\nAfter showing the proof\n\nA skeptic said “Poof!\n\nThere’s a hole here”, raising deep fears.\n\nThis shattered Mr. Wiles’s belief\n\nHis ship was wrecked on a reef\n\nThen a quick switcheroo\n\nCame out of the blue\n\nProviding his mind much relief.\n\nMr. Wiles had been under the gun\n\nBut the obstacle blocking Proof One\n\nFixed a much older way\n\nFrom an earlier day\n\nAnd now Wiles has his place in the sun\n\n4) Here is a poem by John Fitzgerald that mentions other unsolved problems including P vs NP\n\nFermat’s theorem has been solved,\n\nWhat will now make math evolve?\n\nThere are many problems still,\n\nNone of which can cause that thrill.\n\nYears and years of history,\n\nGave romance to Fermat-spree,\n\nAmateurs and top men too,\n\nTried to push this theorem through.\n\nSome have thought they reached the goal,\n\nBut were shipwrecked on the shoal,\n\nSo the quest grew stronger still;\n\nWho would pay for Fermat’s bill?\n\nSo what is now the pearl to probe,\n\nThe snark to hunt, the pot of gold,\n\nThe fish to catch, the rainbows end,\n\nThe distant call towards which to tend?\n\nOne such goal’s the number brick,\n\nwhere integers to all lengths stick:\n\nTo sides, diagonals, everyone,\n\nDoes it exist or are there none?\n\nThen there are those famous pearls,\n\nThat have stymied kins and earls:\n\nGoldbach, Twin Primes, Riemann Zeta;\n\nNo solutions, plenty data.\n\nFind a perfect number odd;\n\nThrough 3n + 1 go plod;\n\nWill the P = N P ?\n\nSend a code unbreakably.\n\nAre independence proofs amiss;\n\nContinuum Hypothesis;\n\nFind a proof which has some texture\n\nof the Poincaré conjecture.\n\nAnd so, you see, onward we sail,\n\nthere still are mountains we must scale;\n\nBut now there’s something gone from math,\n\nAt Fermat’s end we weep and laugh.\n\nTrump is pondering who to pick for his vice president. For a recent podcast about it go here. Spoiler alert: Doug B or Marco R or J.D. Vance.\n\nIn 2008 I did a blog post titled I would bet on INTRADE that INTRADE will do badly picking VP nominations where I showed that about half the time the VP candidate is not on anyone's short list, and hence would do badly in betting markets. At the time INTRADE was synonymous with betting markets. I would not have bet that INTRADE would go out of business.\n\nWhat criteria does a prez nominee use when picking a vice president? How many combinations are there?\n\n1) Someone who will help with a block of voters.\n\nTrump-Pence 2016: Mike Pence was thought to help Trump with Evangelicals and establishment Republicans.\n\nBiden-Harris-2020: Kamala Harris was thought to help Biden with women and African-Americans.\n\nJFK-LBJ-1960-LBJ was thought to help JFK in the South.\n\nKerry-Edwards-2004: Edwards was thought to help win North Carolina (Edwards state). It didn't work.\n\nDukakis-Bentson-1988- Mike Dukakis (liberal) picked Lloyd Benson (moderate) as the VP. The ticket lost though its possible that Benson brought in some votes, just not enough.\n\nThere are other examples. Even for the cases where the candidate won its not clear if the VP mattered. The podcast says that Trump thinks that this kind of thing (e.g., picking a women or an African American) won't help him get their votes. He might be right. But (my speculation) a women on the ticket might help some men be more comfortable voting for him. That is, they could think Trump is not a misogynist, see- he picked a women for VP. Similar for an African-American.\n\nCaveat: Perhaps a candidate who would help in Swing States.\n\n2) Someone who will help him if he wins.\n\nObama-Biden-2008: Biden helped new-comer Obama since Biden had Congressional experience, having been a senator for X years for some large value of X.\n\nBush-Cheney-2000: Dick Cheney knew Washington DC and hence could help George W Bush (who had been a governor but had no FEDERAL experience).\n\n3) Someone who the voters can see taking over the presidency in case that is needed.\n\nClinton-Gore-1992: I've heard that Clinton chose Gore for that reason. I'm NOT an insider so it may not be true.\n\nFDR-Truman-1944: The party chose Harry Truman as VP knowing that FDR would likely pass away and we'd have President Truman. (I've read this and believe it is true on some level.)\n\n4) Party Unity- Pick someone who you fought in the primary to show that the party is united. Bonus: the VP nominee has been vetted and is some-known to the public.\n\nBiden-Harris-2020 may have had had some of this.\n\nThis mentality is rarer now since people tend to NOT pick people they ran against in the primary lately.\n\nJFK-LBJ-1960 was in this category.\n\nBiden did run for the nomination in 2008 but didn't run much (I think he dropped out either right before or right after the Iowa Caucus) so that one doesn't really count.\n\n5) DO NO HARM. Counterexamples:\n\nSome people voted against McCain since they didn't wan to see Sarah Palin one heartbeat away from the presidency. This was especially important since McCain was old. And hence this may be important for Trump in 2024.\n\nBiden may have the same problem with Harris. Note that the issue is NOT if Harris would BE a bad prez, its if people THINK she would be a bad Prez.\n\nKrisiti Noem- Trump doesn't want to answer questions about why his VP shot a dog and a goat. (Note- if Trump himself had shot a dog and a goat the party and FOX news would be defending that action.)\n\n6) Someone who the Prez candidate gets along with personally. I've heard that Clinton-Gore and Obama-Biden got along. JFK and LBJ did not.\n\n7) Someone who won't outshine the president.\n\nDukakis-Benson=1988 might have had this problem.\n\n8) All of the above might matter less than usual since there are so few undecided people in swing states. And that's NOT just because the country is polarized. Ponder the following:\n\nIn most elections its either two people NEITHER of whom has been president, so you don't quite know what they will do, OR one has been prez and the other has not, so you don't know what the newcomer will do.\n\nBut in this election BOTH have been president. We KNOW what they will do. So there is less room for doubt.\n\nHistory: This only happened once before:\n\n1884: Cleveland beats Blaine\n\n1888: Harrison beats Cleveland\n\n1892: Cleveland vs Harrison and Cleveland wins\n\nEven though I say its hard to predict, and it could be someone NOT on the short list, here are my thoughts.\n\na) Marco R. The electors in the electoral college cannot vote for a Prez and vice-Prez who are residents of the same state. (Note1- This is an idiotic rule which dates from either the late 1700's or the early 1800's. Note2- Dick Cheney changes his residency from Texas to Wyoming so he could be Bush's VP in 2000. I have NO problem with that whatsoever.) So one of Marco R or Trump would have to change residencies. Trump won't bother. Marco R is a SENATOR from Florida so I doubt he would either. Also, Marco said nasty things about Trump when he ran against him for the nomination in 2016. I am surprised Marco is on anyone's short list. NOT going to be VP nominee.\n\nb) Doug B. Who? He doesn't outshine Trump, and he gets along with Trump. Won't bring in any voters, but Trump says he doesn't care about that. How would American's view him as a possible prez? I doubt Trump cares. QUITE POSSIBLE to be VP nominee.\n\nc) JD Vance. Author of a thoughtful book, Hillbilly Elegy, which indirectly explains why poor white rural voters are attracted to Trump. He then became a Senator and is now all-in on Trump. This is NOT hypocritical, but its odd. In 2016 he was anti-Trump but now he is pro-Trump. Even that is NOT hypocritical using the usual standards for politicians. He has praised Trump and there may be people who think he would be a good president. He is young (39) and handsome, so I wonder if Trump worries that Vance might outshine him. Even so QUITE POSSIBLE to be VP nominee.\n\nd) I am surprised that Tim Scott and Elise Stefanik seem to have fallen out of Trump's Short list, though they were at one time on it, so would not be to big a surprise if either becomes the VP nominee. IF one thinks that Tim Scott will help with the African-American vote, or that Elise Stefanik will help with the women-vote (OR as noted above, would help white men feel more comfortable voting for Trump) then either would be a politically good choice. However, Trump does not think this is true, and he may be right. I've also heard that Trump doesn't want people saying something like Tim Scott helped Trump win the African-American Vote since Trump wants to think that HE won the election without help. I would think neither will be VP but YOU NEVER KNOW.\n\ne) Someone NOT on the horizon. This brings us back to my 2008 post- IT REALLY COULD BE SOMEONE THAT NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT. So Who? I DON\"T KNOW SINCE NOBODY IS TALKING ABOUT THEM. Maybe Lance.\n\nIn 2013 I wrote a blog to celebrate Lance's 50th birthday by contrasting what things were like when Lance was 10 to when he was 50. That post is here.\n\nBut life has even changed from 2006 to 2023. I will tell three stories, one from 1966, one from 2006, one from 2023. They all have to do with my hobby of collection novelty songs; however, I am sure there are similar stories in other realms\n\n1) On Sept 21, 1966 there was an episode of Batman with special guest villain The Minstrel. He sang several songs in the episode that I thought were funny. My favorite was when Batman and Robin are tied up over a rotisserie, the Minstrel sings, to the tune of Rock-a-bye baby.\n\nBatman and Robin Rotate and Resolve\n\nAs the heat grows, your bodies Dissolve\n\nWhen its still hotter, then you will Melt\n\nNothing left but your Utility Belt.\n\nI LIKED the song and WANTED it. So I found out when the episode would re-run and set up my tape recorder to record it. I still have the tape, though I don't have a tape player (see my blog post here) however it doesn't matter because a compilation of the songs in that episode (actually two episodes) is on YouTube here.\n\n2) On March 6, 2006 there was an Episode of Monk Mr. Monk goes to the dentist which has in it The Randy Disher Project singing Don't need a badge. This was great and I wanted that song. At the time I was buying the DVDs of Monk. When the DVD of that season came out I assumed the song would be included as an extra. It was not :-(. By that time I was busier than in 1966 so I didn't have the time, patience, or tape recorder to track it down. But that does not matter since 8 years later it was on YouTube here. But I had to wait 8 years.\n\n3) On Aug 23, 2023 there was an episode of ST-SNW entitled Subspace Rhapsody that had NINE songs in it, sung by the crew (actually sung by the actors!) I don't have streaming so I didn't watch it but I heard about it (people know I am interested in novelty songs so they tell me about stuff like that). I spend about 30 minutes on YouTube finding ALL NINE and putting them in my file of novelty song links, see here. And it was worth the effort- three of the songs are GREAT and the rest are pretty good (in my opinion).\n\nPoints\n\n1) Also easier to find now then it was in 2006 and certainly in 1966: Everything. Okay, lets list some examples: Music (not just novelty), TV shows, Movies, Journal articles, Conference articles, books. But see next point.\n\n2) Big Caveat: For a recording from 1890 to have survived it would have to be on wax cylinder, then vinyl, then CD, maybe back to vinyl (Vinyl is having a comeback), and perhaps mp3, streaming, You Tube, or Spotify. Some music will be lost. I would like to think that the lost music is not the good stuff, but I know of cases that is incorrect (my blog post here gives an example). For journal articles there is also the issue of language. Some articles were never translated. And some are written in a style we no longer understand. And some you really can't find. And there may be some songs where the only copy is in my collection.\n\n3) Corollary to the Big Caveat: Some things are on YouTube one day and gone the next. There is an SNL short video Conspiracy Theory Rock which seems to come and go and come and go. I don't think its on YouTube, but I found it here. Lets hope it stays. I have that one on VHS tape but I don't have a VHS tape player. And modern e-journals might vanish. See my post on that issue here.\n\n4) Some of my fellow collectors think they miss the days when only they had access to (say) Weird Al's Patterns which he sang on Square One Television (a math-for-kids show on PBS which I discovered and liked when I was 45). The song is on YouTube here. I find this point of view idiotic. The PRO of the modern world is I can find lots of stuff I like and listen to it (and its free!). The CON is a loss of bragging rights for people like me. Really? Seems like a very minor CON. I do not miss the days of hunting in used record shops for an old Alan Sherman record (ask your grandmother what a used record shop is and what an Alan Sherman is).\n\n5) When I played the song Combinatorics (see here) in my discrete math class the students liked it (for some reason the TA hated it, oh well) and the students asked\n\nIs that a real song\n\nI asked them to clarify the question. They couldn't. To ask if it ever came out on a physical medium is a silly question- it didn't, but that doesn't matter. Did it make money? Unlikely, but that would be a rather crass criteria. There are lots of VERY GOOD songs on You Tube (whether Combinatorics is one of them is a question I leave to the reader) so the question Is that a Real Song is either ill-defined or crass. All that matters is do you like it.\n\nLANCE: I had my first Quanta Article published! I explore computation, complexity, randomness and learning and feeling the machine.\n\nBILL: Feels to me like a mashup of old blog posts. Changing topics, I told Darling that you used Pat for Prover and Vanna for Verifier in a 1987 conference talk but those terms did not catch on. She was shocked!\n\nLANCE: I'm shocked you two are married 32 years.\n\nBILL: We hope to get to 64. However, she thought those were really good names for the concept (she has a masters degree in Computer Science so she knows stuff) and wondered why wouldn't those have caught on.\n\nLANCE: I think that its frowned upon to use a cultural icon to tied to one country. There are Europeans who have no idea who Pat and Vanna are. For that matter, there are some Americans, particularly academics, who have no idea who Pat and Vanna are. And who would remember either of them once they stopped hosting the show? And who thought that would be 2024?\n\nBILL: Who do papers on Interactive Proof Systems use? Of course Author-Merlin games. Is the legend of King Author so well known (or at least it's well know that there IS a legend) that its okay to use those names? I think yes.\n\nLANCE: Did you really think his name is Author? I command thee to see Excalibur and learn the legend for yourself. Excalibur also being the name of a Computer Othello program I wrote in the 80's.\n\nBILL: All right, Arthur. For one thing, we, or at least everyone but me, still knows who they are many years later, whereas Pat and Vanna will be lost to history. Hey Arthur and Merlin even got a science cartoon for their role in interactive proofs.\n\nLANCE: Did Arthur and Merlin ever host a game show? I used Victor and Pulu in my thesis. I've also written papers where we use Prover and Verifier.\n\nBILL: Pulu? Anyway, Prover and Verifier are boring!\n\nLANCE: Sometimes boring works. We need to only use cultural icons that spans many cultures and won't be forgotten in 200 years. Just to be on the safe side, use cultural icons that are over 200 years old.\n\nBILL: Can you think of any cultural icon that has been used in Math or Computer Science and the name did catch on?\n\nLANCE: The Monty Hall Problem.\n\nBILL: I suspect there are many people who know who Monty Hall is only because of the paradox. And that is a paradox. Here is a name that didn't catch on: Sheldon's Conjecture was named after Sheldon Cooper from The Big Bang Theory. However, since it was solved, the name won't catch on, which is probably just as well.\n\nLANCE: How does the Chicken McNugget Theorem fit into this?\n\nBILL: I don't know but it's making me hungry. Let's eat!\n\nFor this post all Context Free Grammars (henceforth CFGs) are assumed to be in Chomsky Normal Form. The size of a CFG \\(G\\) is the number of rules. We denote this by \\(|G|\\).\n\nBILL: In my automata theory class I want to do some lower bounds on the size of CFGs. It is easy to show that if \\(w=0^n\\) then there is a CFG G such that \\(L(G)=\\{w\\}\\) and \\(|G|=O(\\log n)\\). I showed that if \\(w\\) is a Kolmogorov random string of length \\(n\\), and G is a CFG such that \\(L(G)=\\{w\\}\\), then \\( |G|=\\Omega(n/\\log n\\)), though this is surely known. So here is my question: Is there a natural such \\(w\\)? I will blog about that and make an open problems column out of it.\n\nLANCE: Kolmogorov strings are natural!\n\nBILL: Oh yeah. If that was true then spell check would not flag Kolmogorov as being misspelled. So there!\n\nLANCE: Can you ask a more rigorous question?\n\nBILL: Okay. We can view the Kolm-result as saying that there is a function \\(f\\) from \\(1^*\\) to \\(\\{0,1\\}^*\\) such that \\(f(1^n)\\) is a string of length \\(n\\) such that any CFG for \\( \\{w\\}\\) is large. But the function f is not computable!\n\nLANCE: That shouldn't bother you. You wrote an entire book about how many queries to HALT and other incomputable sets are needed to solve certain problems (see here). Also now that you know you there are such strings, you can simply search for a w and test all small CFGs. So Computable!\n\nBILL: Still not natural. And what is the complexity? Exponential? Poly?\n\nWE DROP THE TOPIC AND PICK IT UP AGAIN A FEW TIMES. WE (meaning mostly Lance) HAVE SOME BRILLIANT INSIGHTS THAT LEAD TO THE FOLLOWING RESULTS:\n\n1) For every \\(w \\in \\{0,1\\}^n\\) there is a CFG G with \\(L(G)=\\{w\\}\\) and \\( |G|=O(n/\\log n)\\)\n\n2) If \\(w\\) is a de Bruijn sequence of length \\(n\\) and order \\(k=\\log n\\) (we assume n is a power of 2). Then every CFG G with \\(L(G)=\\{w\\}\\) has \\( |G|=\\Omega(n/\\log n)\\). There is a known algorithm that will, given \\(1^n\\), produce a de Bruijn sequence or length n and order \\(k=\\log n\\), in time quasilinear in \\(n\\).\n\nBILL: That bums me out for two contradictory reasons\n\na) The problem is NOT solved since de Bruijn is flagged by spellcheck, so the sequences are not natural.\n\nb) The problems IS solved, so I can't use it for an open problems column.\n\nLANCE: Do not despair!\n\na) De Bruijn sequences have a Wikipedia page and therefore are natural.\n\nb) We can post on ArXiv.\n\nWE DID and a day later Markus Lohrey emailed us that, aside from the De Bruijn result, the results are already known using a different terminology, word chains. See his survey here. Then the next day, Giovanni Pighizzini emails us that he had previously published lower bounds for De Bruijn sequences. We have since withdrawn the paper. We revised it by putting in references and history but will not put it on arxiv. The revised paper is here.\n\nLANCE: Bill, are you bummed out? Why did we even write the paper anyway?\n\nBILL: Not at all! My original goal was pedagogical, and the paper we have can still be taught in automata theory next spring. PLUS, we got invited to submit to Advanced in AI and ML with a 10% discount on publication fees (see here.) Since we are used to getting 100% discount on publication fees we won't be submitting, but it was nice to be asked.\n\nLANCE: Yeah, nice to be asked to be parted from my money. At least I learned about word chains.\n\nIt started with a post from Fermat's Library.\n\nMy immediate reaction was why not list them all? Giving the smallest such number suggests there are an infinite number of them. But the value of a d-digit number grows exponentially in d, while the 2-digit sum grows quadratically so there must only be a finite number.\n\nLet's be a little more formal. Let's restrict ourselves to positive integers with no leading zeros. The 2-digit sum of x is the sum of all 2-digit numbers formed by concatenating the ith digit of x and the jth digit of x for all i,j with i\\(\\neq\\)j. The 2-digit sum of 132 is 13+12+31+32+21+23 = 132. The 2-digit sum of 121 is 12+11+21+21+11+12 = 88. A number x if 2-idempotent if the 2-digit sum of x is x.\n\nLet's look at the possible lengths of 2-idempotent numbers.\n\nFor 1-digit numbers the 2-digit sum is zero.\n\nFor 2-digit numbers the 2-digit sum is that number plus another positive number so never equal.\n\nFor 5-digit numbers, the 2-digit sum is bounded by 20*99 = 1980 < 10000. So there are no 2-idempotent numbers with 5-digits. More than 5 digits can be discarded similarly.\n\nFor 4-digit numbers, the two digit sum is at most 12*99 = 1188. So a 2-idempotent number must begin with a one. Which now bounds it by 19*3+91*3+99*6=924. So there are no 2-idempotent numbers of 4 digits.\n\nSo every 2-idempotent must have 3 digits. I wrote up a quick Python program and the only three 2-idempotents are 132, 264 and 396. Note that 264 is 2*132 and 396 is 3*132. That makes sense, if you double every digit and don't generate carries, every two-digit part of the sum also doubles.\n\nBiscuit asks if there is some mathematical argument that avoids a computer or manual search. You can cut down the search space. Every length 3 2-idempotent is bounded by 6*99=594 and must be even since every digit appears in the one's position twice. But I don't know how to avoid the search completely.\n\nTwo more Python searches: 35964 is the only 3-idempotent number. If you allow leading zeros then 0594 is 2-idempotent. There may (or may not) be infinitely many such numbers.\n\nAfter my post on different holiDAYS, here, such as Talk like a Pirate Day, and Raegan Revor day, two other Days were brought to my attention\n\n1) Lance emailed me about National BBQ day, which is May 16. See here\n\n2) While at a Quantum Computing Prelim I saw a poster for World Quantum Day, which is April 14. See here.\n\nThe obvious question: Which of these days is better known? I Googled them again but this time note the number of hits.\n\nI found out that Google seems to have removed that feature!\n\nWhen using Google on both Firefox and Chrome, I did not get number of hits.\n\nSome points about this\n\n1) Is there a way to turn the number-of-hits feature on?\n\n2) Bing DOES give number of hits.\n\nWorld Quantum Day: 899,000 hits\n\nNational BBQ Day: 418,000 hits\n\nTo get a baseline I binged Pi Day. This did not reveal the number of hits. An unscientific set of Bing searches seems to indicate that if the number of hits is large then they are not shown.\n\nIs hits-on-Bing a good measure of popularity? I do not know.\n\n3) Duck Duck Go does not give number of hits. This might be part of their privacy policy.\n\n4) I also noticed a while back that You Tube no longer allows DISLIKES, just likes. That may explain why my Muffin Math song on You Tube (see here), with Lance on the Piano, has 0 dislikes. It does not explain why it got 19 likes.\n\n5) Google said that the number-of-hits is really an approximation and one should not take it too seriously.\n\nYouTube said that (not in these words) the haters caused dislikes to be far more than they should be.\n\nOn the one hand, I want to know those numbers. On the other hand I think Google and YouTube are right about about the numbers not being that accurate. And more so for Bing which is used less so (I assume) has less data to work from.\n\n6) Back to my question: What is better known National BBQ day or World Quantum Day? The nation and the world may never know.\n\n7) All of the above is speculation.\n\nIn the book Those Fascinating Numbers by Jean-Marie De Konick they find interesting (or `interesting') things to say about many numbers. I reviewed the book in a SIGACT News book review column here. The entry for 13 is odd: 13 is the third Horse Number. The nth Horse number is the number of ways n horses can finish a race. You might think: OH, that's just n!. AH- horses can tie. So it's the number of ways to order n objects allowing ties.\n\nIs there a closed form for H(n)? We will come back to that later.\n\n0) The Wikipedia Entry on horse races that ended in a dead heat is here. They list 78 dead heats (two horses tie for first place) and 10 triple dead heats (three horses tie for first place). For the horse numbers we care if (say) two horses tie for 4th place. In reality nobody cares about that.\n\n1) I have found nowhere else where these numbers are called The Horse Numbers.\n\n2) They are called the Ordered Bell Numbers. The Wikipedia entry here has some applications.\n\n3) They are also called the Fubini Numbers according to the Ordered Bell Number Wikipedia page.\n\n4) I had not thought about the Horse Numbers for a long time when they came up while I was making slides for the proof that (Q,<) is decidable (the slides are here).\n\n5) There is an OEIS page for the Horse Numbers, though they are called the Ordered Bell Numbers and the Fubini Numbers. It is here. That page says H(n) is asymptotically \\(\\frac{1}{2}n!(\\log_2(e))^{n+1}\\) which is approx \\(\\frac{1}{2}n!(1.44)^{n+1}\\).\n\n6) There is a recurrence for the Horse Numbers:\n\nH(0)=1\n\nH(1)=1\n\nH(2)=3\n\nFor all \\(n\\ge 3\\) we split H(n) into what happens if i horses are tied for last place (choose i out of n) and if the rest are ordered H(n-i) ways. Hence\n\n\\( H(n) = \\binom{n}{1}H(n-1) + \\binom{n}{2}H(n-2) + \\cdots + \\binom{n}{n}H(0) \\)\n\nUsing \\(\\binom{n}{i} = \\binom{n}{n-i}\\) we get\n\n\\( H(n) = \\binom{n}{0}H(0) + \\binom{n}{1}H(1) + \\cdots + \\binom{n}{n-1}H(n-1) \\)\n\nSTUDENT: Is there a closed form for H(n)?\n\nBILL: Yes. Its H(n).\n\nSTUDENT: That's not closed form.\n\nBILL: Is there a closed form for the number of ways to choose i items out of n?\n\nSTUDENT: Yes, \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) or \\( \\frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}\\)\n\nBILL: Does that let you compute it easily? No. The way you compute \\(\\binom{n}{i}\\) is with a recurrence. The way you compute H(n) is with a recurrence. Just having a nice notation for something does not mean you have a closed form for it.\n\nSTUDENT: I disagree! We know what n! is!\n\nBILL: Do not be seduced by the familiarity of the notation.\n\n(This post was inspired by Rachel F, a prior REU-CAAR student, emailing me wishing me a happy Star Wars Day.)\n\nI am writing this on May 4 which is Star Wars day. Off the top of my head I know of the following special days (I exclude official holidays, though the term official has no official meaning.)\n\nJan 25: Opposite Day Wikipedia Link\n\nFeb 2: Groundhog Day Wikipedia Link\n\nFeb 12: Darwin Day Wikipedia Link\n\nMarch 14: Pi Day Wikipedia link\n\nMay 4: Star Wars Day Wikipedia Link\n\nApril 22: Earth Day Wikipedia link\n\nApril 25: Take your Child to Work Day Wikipedia Link\n\nSep 21: National Cleanup Day Wikipedia Link\n\nSept 22: Hobbit Day Wikipedia Link\n\nOct 1: International Coffee Day Wikipedia Link\n\nOct 8: Ada Lovelace Day Wikipedia Link\n\nOct 16: Boss's Day Wikipedia Link\n\nOct 23: Mole Day Wikipedia Link\n\nNov 13: Sadie Hawkins Day Wikipedia Link\n\nSept 19: Talk like a Pirate Day Wikipedia Link\n\nA few notes\n\n1a) Oct 23 is also Weird Al's birthday.\n\n1b) May 4 is also Edward Nelson's birthday (he invented the problem of finding the chromatic number of the plan). See my post (actually a guest post by Alexander Soifer) on the problem here for more information on that.\n\n1c) I left off St. Patrick's Day (March 17) and International LGBT + Pride day (June 28) and many others. Those left off are so well known that they are official where as I was looking for unofficial holidays. But see next point.\n\n2) The Wikipedia entry for Talk Like a Pirate Day says it's a parodic holiday. The entries on the others holidays use terms like unofficial. I prefer unofficial since ALL holidays are made up, so the only real question is which ones are recognized. But even that is problematic since one can ask recognized by who? Also, despite collecting parody music and videos for the last 50 years, I have never heard the term parodic. Therefore it is not a word. Spellcheck agrees!\n\n3) Darwin Day should be Darwin-Lincoln day since they were both born on Feb 12. In fact,they were both born in 1809. Most famous same-birthday-and-year pair ever. Second place is Lenny Bruce and Margaret Thatcher (Oct 13, 1925).\n\n4) The page on Pi Day mentions Tau Day, but Tau day has no page of its own. Tau is \\(2\\pi\\) which some say comes up more often then \\(\\pi\\) and hence should be THE constant. Some say that \\(2\\pi i\\) comes up so often that it should be THE constant. However, there can't really be a day to celebrate it.(I blogged about is-tau-better-than-pi here.)\n\n5) In the future every day will be some kind of day. The Future Is NOW: Website of Fun Holidays\n\nAre the holidays on the list real? Depends what you mean by real. Because of the web anyone can post a list of anything and its just one person's opinion. I do not know who controls that website but even if I did, it would be hard to say YES THOSE ARE REAL or NO THOSE ARE NOT.\n\nOne could say that to be a real DAY, it has to be on Wikipedia. But there are two problems with this:\n\na) Goodhart's law. When a measure becomes a target it stops being a measure. If I want Jan 15 to be Bagel and Lox Day, I'll make a page for it.\n\nb) I'm still waiting for Raegan Revord, who has played Missy on Young Sheldon for 7 years, to get a Wikipedia Page. So what hope does Polar Bear Plunge day (Jan 1) have for getting a Wikipedia Page?"
