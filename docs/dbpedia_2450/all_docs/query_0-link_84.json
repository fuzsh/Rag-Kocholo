        "text": "Karen E. Smith\n\nM. S. Keeler Professor of Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Michigan\n\nA series of three lectures entitled Singularities in Algebraic Geometry: Resolving and Measuring using reduction modulo p\n\nLecture I - Resolutions of Singularities\n\nWhile conic sections and spheres are smooth varieties, in general, a variety can have singular points—places where it is pinched or intersects itself. In this first talk, we will discuss Hironaka's famous theorem on resolution of singularities—a technique to \"get rid\" of the singular points. We introduce a class of singular varieties called rational singularities that are important because they are well-approximated by their resolutions, and explain how one can use \"reduction modulo p\" to characterize them.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/GOSo03vj7KM\n\nLecture II - Measuring Singularities\n\nWe discuss some ways to quantify how singular a given variety is. We introduce an analytic index of singularities, defined in terms of convergence of a certain integral. This provides a numerical measure of the singularity, sometimes called the log-canonical threshold. Remarkably, this numerical invariant can also be defined using reduction to characteristic p: for each p, we define a numerical measure of singularities called the F-pure threshold, which has striking fractal-like behavior. Amazing, taking the limit as p goes to infinity, we recover the analytically defined log canonical threshold. We will discuss these theorems and some deep open questions that remain at the frontier of this topic.\n\nLecture III - Non-Commutative Resolutions of Singularities\n\nA foundational result of Hilbert underlies all of algebraic geometry: an algebraic variety can be understood more or less completely by fully understanding its ring of regular (polynomial) functions. As we saw in the first two lectures, questions about varieties can be translated into corresponding questions about their coordinate rings—which are always commutative Noetherian rings—and then attacked with tools of commutative algebra. On the other hand, many of these algebraic tools make sense even for non-commutative rings. In the final talk, we consider what it might mean to have a \"non-commutative\" variety, and what it might mean that it is \"smooth.\" We will introduce Van den Bergh's idea of a non-commutative resolution of singularities, and again, show how working over a field of prime characteristic can provide insight into this problem.\n\nTop of page\n\nMartin Hairer\n\nChair in Probability and Stochastic Analysis\n\nImperial College London\n\nLecture I - Bridging scales: from microscopic dynamics to macroscopic laws\n\nOne fascinating aspect of probability theory is the universal aspect of the objects it allows us to construct. The most well-known example of this phenomenon is the central limit theorem: for a very large class of collections of random variables, additive functionals that only depend weakly on any one element of the collection exhibit Gaussian behaviour in the limit. When taking time evolution into account, it turns out that in certain \"cross-over regimes\" the large-scale behaviour of a number of stochastic systems can formally be described by an ill-posed stochastic PDE.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/8ITmBUa7ba0\n\nLecture II - An analyst’s incursion into quantum field theory\n\nIn quantum field theory, scattering amplitudes are described by sums over terms described by Feynman diagrams. In many cases, these are meant to describe singular divergent integrals, so it is not clear how they should be interpreted and whether different interpretations are equivalent. In the Euclidean context, we turn this into a clean problem of real analysis and show how algebraic techniques allow to tackle it.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/JR1zMqZDqkI\n\nLecture III - Renormalization: a BPHZ theorem for stochastic PDEs\n\nWe show how some of the ideas explored in the previous two lectures can be applied to the study of singular stochastic PDEs. In particular, we show that although it is not clear a priori what it means to \"solve\" any particular one of these equations, they can be divided into finite-dimensional families of solutions that are themselves defined in a canonical way. This is a consequence of a version of the celebrated \"BPHZ theorem\" which governs renormalisation techniques in perturbative QFT.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/LpEsOK0NqEc\n\nTop of page\n\nFan Chung\n\nDistinguished Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science\n\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nLecture I: Can you hear the shape of a network?\n\nNew directions in spectral graph theory We will discuss some recent developments in several new directions of spectral graph theory, including random walks for directed graphs, ranking algorithms, network games, graph limits and graphlets, for example.\n\nLecture II: 'Sequences: random, structured or something in between?'\n\nThere are many fundamental problems concerning sequences that arise in many areas of mathematics and computation. Typical problems include finding or avoiding patterns; testing or validating various 'random-like' behavior; analyzing or comparing different statistics, etc. In this talk, we will examine various notions of regularity or irregularity for sequences and mention numerous open problems.\n\nLecture III: Semigroup Spectral Theory and Graph Coloring Games\n\nWe consider a coloring game on graphs as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of the semigroup spectral method for determining the spectrum of the directed graphs which arise as the state graphs associated with the game. Originating from the study of the so-called Tsetlin library random walks and the like, this method can be used to analyze dynamic processes such as voting and ranking, provided the random processes satisfy certain \"memoryless\" conditions (corresponding to left-regular-band semigroups).\n\nTop of page\n\nLaure Saint-Raymond\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nPierre & Marie Curie University (Paris VI), and École Normale Supérieure\n\nA series of three lectures entitled From Particle Systems to Kinetic Equations\n\nLecture I: The low density limit: formal derivation\n\nConsider a deterministic system of N hard spheres of diameter ε. Assume that they are initially independent and identically distributed. Then, in the limit when N→∞ and ε→0 with Nεd-1=1 (Boltzmann-Grad scaling), the one-particle density can be approximated by the solution to the kinetic Boltzmann equation. In particular, particles remain asymptotically independent. In the first lecture, we will present the formal derivation of this low density limit, and discuss two important features, namely the propagation of chaos and the appearance of irreversibility.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/_8J-bWWZPAI\n\nLecture II: A short time convergence result\n\nLanford's theorem states that in the Boltzmann-Grad limit the one-particle density converges to the solution of the kinetic Boltzmann equation almost everywhere on a short time interval (corresponding actually to a fraction of the average first collision time). The proof relies on a careful study of the recollision mechanism (which is not described by the Boltzmann dynamics), and on a priori bounds obtained by a Cauchy-Kowalewski argument. In the second lecture, we will give a sketch of this proof, and show that the time restriction is due to the lack of global a priori bounds.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/S6JKI370gh0\n\nLecture III: The case of fluctuations around a global equilibrium\n\nTo improve the convergence time, the idea is therefore to consider situations where one can obtain global a priori bounds. Since the system of particles is Hamiltonian, the Gibbs measures are invariant under the flow and provide constant solutions to the Boltzmann equation. By perturbation, we get initial data leading to linear kinetic equations. In the third lecture, we will show that, for such initial data, we can control a priori the collision rate, and extend Lanford's strategy to get a quasi-global convergence result in the low density limit.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/_H3DxJBqWcw\n\nTop of page\n\nRichard M. Schoen\n\nDistinguished Professor and Excellence in Teaching Endowed Chair\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\nLecture I: Problems and progress in mathematical relativity\n\nThe Einstein equations were invented to unify gravity and special relativity. The theory of curved space times evolving under the Einstein evolution equations leads to a unique set of mathematical problems which lie in the fields of differential geometry and partial differential equations of elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic type. This lecture will survey some of these problems with emphasis on topics of current interest for which progress is being made. It is intended for a general audience.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/jBjOVFGEhZE\n\nLecture II: Two eigenvalue problems for surfaces\n\nThe problem of finding surface geometries (metrics) of a given area which maximize their lowest eigenvalue has been studied for over 50 years. Despite some spectacular successes the problem is still not well understood for most surfaces. In this colloquium lecture we will describe this question and the results which have been obtained. We will also describe a related problem for surfaces with boundary. Both of these questions lead to geometric descriptions of extremal metrics as minimal surfaces and thus lead to a new set of minimal surfaces questions.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/Tvs0Q_wrl4Y\n\nLecture III: Localizing solutions of the Einstein equations\n\nIn general it is not possible to localize solutions of the Einstein equations since there are asymptotic conserved quantities such as the total mass which are nonzero for every nontrivial space-time. In this lecture we will describe recent work with A. Carlotto which achieves a localization in cones and leads to new constructions of non-interacting superpositions of solutions.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/H7z6m1TzOt4\n\nTop of page\n\nBernd Sturmfels\n\nProfessor of Mathematics, Statistics, and Computer Science\n\nUniversity of California, Berkeley\n\nLecture I: Convex Algebraic Geometry\n\nWe introduce convex bodies with an interesting algebraic structure. A primary focus lies on the geometry of semidefinite optimization. Starting with elementary questions about ellipses in the plane, we move on to discuss the geometry of spectrahedra, orbitopes, and convex hulls of real varieties. This lecture has many beautiful pictures and can be enjoyed by undergraduate students.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/MKv8-z4zyJ8\n\nLecture II: Maximum Likelihood for Matrices with Rank Constraint\n\nMaximum likelihood estimation is a fundamental computational task in statistics. We discuss this problem for manifolds of low rank matrices. These represent mixtures of independent distributions of two discrete random variables. This non-convex optimization problems leads to some beautiful geometry, topology, and combinatorics. We explain how numerical algebraic geometry is used to find the global maximum of the likelihood function, and we present a remarkable duality theorem due to Draisma and Rodriguez.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/CM3hdOxpj10\n\nLecture III: Tropicalization of Classical Moduli Spaces\n\nAlgebraic geometry is the study of solutions sets to polynomial equations. Solutions that depend on an infinitesimal parameter are studied combinatorially by tropical geometry. Tropicalization works especially well for varieties that are parametrized by monomials in linear forms. Many classical moduli spaces (for curves of low genus and few points in the plane) admit such a representation, and we here explore their tropical geometry. Examples to be discussed include the Segre cubic, the Igusa quartic, the Burkhardt quartic, and moduli of marked del Pezzo surfaces. Matroids, hyperplane arrangements, and Weyl groups play a prominent role. Our favorites are E6, E7 and G32.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/WKoi5Mu2dsE\n\nTop of page\n\nRichard Taylor\n\nHerchel Smith Professor of Mathematics\n\nHarvard University\n\nLecture I: Reciprocity Laws and Density Theorems\n\nIf one fixes a polynomial (or a system of polynomials) in one or more variables, one can ask how the number of solutions modulo a prime number p varies with the prime p. Reciprocity laws give a formula involving completely different areas of mathematics (discrete subgroups of Lie groups). Density theorems give statistical information on how the number of solutions varies with p.\n\nIn the first lecture I will present a leisurely historical introduction to reciprocity laws and density theorems, starting with Gauss' law of quadratic reciprocity and finishing with the Sato-Tate conjecture. This lecture will also sketch Serre's approach to deducing density theorems from reciprocity laws.\n\nLecture II: Galois Representations\n\nIn the second lecture I will talk about a more general framework for discussing reciprocity laws. I will introduce Galois representations, L-functions and automorphic forms, and discuss their relevance in number theory. I will describe Langlands' very general reciprocity conjecture and the Fontaine-Mazur conjecture.\n\nLecture III: Automorphy\n\nI will describe what we currently know about general reciprocity theorems. I will give some indication of the techniques we have and what I see as the main stumbling blocks to further progress.\n\nTop of page\n\nNick Trefethen\n\nProfessor of Numerical Analysis\n\nOxford University\n\nLecture I: Four Bugs on a Rectangle (and the Biggest Numbers You've Ever Seen)\n\nSuppose four bugs at the corners of a 2 x 1 rectangle start chasing each other at speed 1. Bug 1 chases bug 2, bug 2 chases bug 3, and so on. What happens next will amaze you -- or at least it amazed me! As we follow the bugs to their eventual collision at the center, we will encounter the biggest numbers you've probably ever seen and confront some fundamental questions about what it means to try to understand our world through mathematics.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/ukZdM7aUS8E\n\nLecture II: Approximation Theory in One Hour\n\nMy first love was approximation theory, and during my current sabbatical I have returned to this subject to write a book called Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice. This talk will be a fast tour of about twenty of the main theorems of this book (with a handout), each illustrated by chebfun computations on the computer. We will see vividly how approximation ideas are at the heart of all kinds of practical computational problems including quadrature, rootfinding, and solution of differential equations.\n\nThis is the accompanying handout for this lecture.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/PggLWg7-53Y\n\nLecture III: You Can't Beat Gibbs and Runge\n\nSuppose you sample an analytic function f in n equispaced points in [-1,1]. Can you use this data to approximatef in a manner that converges exponentially as n → ∞? Many algorithms have been proposed that are effective for moderate values of n, but we prove that they must all fail in the limit n → ∞: exponential convergence implies exponential instability. This is joint work with Rodrigo Platte and Arno Kuijlaars.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/K1RUvR6Vau0\n\nTop of page\n\nTerence Tao\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\n\nA series of three lectures entitled Recent Developments in Arithmetic Combinatorics\n\nLecture I: Additive Combinatorics and the Primes\n\nGiven a set A of N integers, how many additive patterns (e.g. arithmetic progressions of length three) does A have? The answer depends of course on the nature of A. At one extreme are sets with very strong additive structure, such as the arithmetic progression {1,..., N}, which tend to have many additive patterns. At the other extreme are \"random\" sets A, which tend to have relatively few additive patterns. Understanding and classifying these two extremes, and the extent to which an arbitrary set lies between these extremes, is a major topic of additive combinatorics today. Recent progress on these questions has led to applications in number theory, particularly regarding the question of detecting additive patterns in the primes; in particular, I will discuss my result with Ben Green that the primes contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/Lz3JG_V6f-Q\n\nLecture II: Additive Combinatorics and Random Matrices\n\nThe theory of random continuous matrices (such as the gaussian unitary ensemble or GUE), and in particular the study of their eigenvalues, is an intensively studied and well-understood subject. In contrast, the theory of random discrete matrices, such as the Bernoulli ensemble in which each entry of the matrix equals +1 and -1 with equal probability, is only just now being developed. Much of the recent progress relies on an understanding of the distribution of discrete random walks, and in particular on solving the inverse Littlewood-Offord problem. This in turn requires the use of tools from additive combinatorics, such as the geometry of multidimensional arithmetic progressions, and Freiman's inverse theorem. I will survey these developments, which include joint work of myself with Van Vu.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/XaDJIddgyQE\n\nLecture III: Sum-product Estimates, Expanders, and Exponential Sums\n\nConsider a finite set A of elements in a ring or field. This set might be \"almost closed under addition\", which for instance occurs when A is an arithmetic progression such as {1,..., N}. Or it may be \"almost closed under multiplication\", which for instance occurs when A is a geometric progression such as {1, a,..., aN}. But it is difficult for A to be almost closed under addition and multiplication simultaneously, unless it is very close to a subring or subfield. The emerging field of sum-product estimates in arithmetic combinatorics seeks to establish strong inequalities to quantify this phenomenon. Recent breakthroughs in this area by Bourgain and coauthors, based primarily on Fourier analysis and additive combinatorial tools, have yielded new exponential sum and sieve estimates in number theory, new randomness extractors in computer science, and new constructions of expander graphs in combinatorics. This lecture will be a survey of several of these developments.\n\nVideo: https://youtu.be/iLvAG2CeBN8\n\nTop of page\n\nTimothy Gowers\n\nRouse Ball Professor of Mathematics\n\nCambridge University\n\nLecture I: Some Theorems and Open Problems in Arithmetic Combinatorics\n\nArithmetic combinatorics is the name that has been given to a thriving new area of mathematics, or, to be more accurate, a new and very interesting fusion of old areas. I shall give an overview of the area and try to explain what combinatorics, harmonic analysis, and number theory have to offer each other.\n\nLecture II: Discrete Fourier Analysis: Its Uses and Limitations\n\nThis lecture will be about one of the main techniques in arithmetic combinatorics: the use of the discrete Fourier transform. I shall outline how it can be used to prove two central theorems in the subject, namely Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions, and Freiman's theorem on the structure of sets with small sumsets. Both these theorems result in major open problems, and I shall try to explain their difficulty by highlighting what it is that we do not yet understand about Fourier analysis.\n\nLecture III: Discrete Fourier Analysis: Its Uses and Limitations\n\nIn this lecture I shall try to give some idea about the proofs of two celebrated results about arithmetic progressions: Szemerécdi's theorem, which states that every dense set of integers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions, and the Green-Tao theorem, which tells us that the same is true of the set of primes. Both these results involve situations where conventional Fourier analysis is inadequate, but recently discovered \"polynomial\" generalizations can be used instead. Much remains to be understood: if time permits, I shall speculate about what arithmetic combinatorics may look like in twenty years' time.\n\nTop of page\n\nLuis Caffarelli\n\nSid Richardson Chair holder, Professor in Mathematics\n\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, and the Texas Institute for Computations and Applied Mathematics\n\nA series of three lectures entitled Free Boundary Problems of Obstacle Type\n\nAbstract: Free boundary problems of obstacle type became of interest during the development of the theory of Variational Inequalities in the late 1960s, and applications surfaced in many areas of applied math, probability and geometry.\n\nFrom the variational point of view, the problem consists of minimizing some variational integral , among those configurations staying above a given graph. From the probabilistic point of view, it concerns an optimal stopping time problem that gives rise to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.\n\nTypical examples of the variational integrals involve those giving rise to second order linear or non linear equations (Laplacian, minimal surfaces, p-Laplacian), fourth order problems like the bi-Laplacian (clamped plates), or the fractional Laplacian for instance for boundary control problems or optimal stopping times for Levi processes. We will discuss matters of regularity, stability, and the geometric properties of the contact set and its free boundary.\n\nLecture I: We will discuss what is a free boundary problem, in particular one of obstacle type, describe different areas, from geometry to fluid dynamics to probability in which they appear, and what type of information we seek.\n\nLecture II: We will give a more detailed discussion of regularity and geometric behavior of solutions to these types of problems, as well as its interpretations, in particular in connection with recent work on non-local variational inequalities.\n\nLecture III: We will discuss in greater detail the main techniques to tackle this type of problem, in particular \"convexity\" properties of solutions, and the role of monotonicity formulas.\n\nTop of page\n\nAlain Connes\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nCollège de France, and Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques\n\nA series of three lectures entitled Non-Commutative Geometry\n\nAbstract: Non-commutative geometry has its roots in the following theorem of Gelfand: if X is a (locally) compact Hausdorff space and C(X) is the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on X, then X may be recovered as the space of maximal ideals of C(X). More precisely, the category of commutative C*-algebras is equivalent to the category of locally compact Hausdorff spaces.\n\nGelfand's Theorem allows one to transport the usual geometric notions to corresponding algebraic properties and features of the ring C(X). For example, complex vector bundles on X correspond to finitely generated projective modules over C(X), and the topological K-theory of X is isomorphic to the algebraic K-theory of C(X).\n\nThe basic idea behind non-commutative geometry is allow C*-algebras that are not necessarily commutative to play the role of \"functions\" on spaces that are not necessarily Hausdorff.\n\nAmong the naturally occurring spaces with obvious geometric meaning that fail to be Hausdorff are:\n\nthe space of leaves of a foliation\n\nthe space of irreducible representations of a discrete group\n\nthe space of Penrose tilings of the plane\n\nthe Brouillon zone in the quantum Hall effect\n\nphase space in quantum mechanics\n\nspace-time\n\nthe space of Q-lattices in Rn\n\nFar-reaching non-commutative extensions of classical geometric concepts such as measure theory, topology, differential geometry, and Riemannian geometry have been obtained with varying degrees of perfection. These extensions allow the usual geometric notions to be used to analyze spaces such as those above.\n\nThese three talks will provide an introduction to, and overview of, non-commutative geometry. Connections with other branches of mathematics and physics will be emphasized.\n\nTop of page\n\nPeter Shor\n\nAT&T Research\n\nLecture I: Quantum Algorithms\n\nQuantum computers are hypothetical devices that use the principles of quantum mechanics to perform computations. For some difficult computational problems, including the cryptographically important problems of prime factorization and finding discrete logarithms, the best algorithms known for classical computers are exponentially slower than ones known for quantum computers. Although they have not yet been built, quantum computers do not appear to violate any fundamental principles of physics. I will explain how quantum mechanics provides this extra computational power, and show how Fourier transforms lets quantum computers find periodicity in situations classical computers cannot. Finally, I show how large integers can be factored by finding the periodicity of an exponentially long sequence.\n\nLecture II: Quantum Error Correction\n\nOne of the main difficulties in building quantum computers is in manipulating coherent quantum states without introducing errors or losing coherence. This problem can be alleviated by the use of quantum error correcting codes. Until these codes were discovered, it was widely believed that quantum computers could not be made resistant to errors - the argument was that to detect an error, a quantum computer's state would have to be measured, which by the laws of quantum mechanics would perturb the computer's state and thus disrupt the computation. Quantum error correcting codes get around this by encoding the data so that errors can be measured without disturbing the computational state. I will explain how these codes work, and briefly sketch how they can be used to make quantum computes extremely reliable via software if they can be built with only moderately reliable hardware.\n\nLecture III: Quantum Information Theory\n\nOne of the most remarkable papers of this century was the 1948 paper in which Shannon laid out the fundamentals of information theory, giving formulae for the compressibility of data and for the information-carrying capacity of a channel. Only in the last ten years, however, have researchers started to investigate what happens to the theorems of information theory in a quantum mechanical setting. We will define quantum channels, and present what is known about the analogs of Shannon's theorems in the quantum setting. Aside from knowledge of basic quantum mechanics (the necessary part of which I plan to cover in the first lecture), these lectures should be independent.\n\nTop of page\n\nIngrid Daubechies\n\nProfessor of Mathematics\n\nPrinceton University\n\nLecture I: Wavelets: An Overview, with Recent Applications\n\nWavelets have emerged in the last decade as a synthesis from many disciplines, ranging from pure mathematics (where forerunners were used to study singular integral operators) to electrical engineering (quadrature mirror filters), borrowing in passing from quantum physics, from geophysics and from computer aided design. The first part of the talk will present an overview of the ideas in wavelet theory, in particular wavelet bases. The second part of the talk will discuss some recent applications, ranging from loss-less as well as lossy image compression or speech analysis to nonlinear approximation methods.\n\nLecture II: Subdivision Schemes\n\nSubdivision schemes are used in computer aided design for the construction of locally adaptable curves and surfaces. A \"good\" scheme can lead to surfaces or curves that look quite smooth. This talk will discuss mathematical techniques to study the regularity of these curves and surfaces. In the \"equally spaced\" case, this is all well understood. The corresponding techniques in the non-equally spaced case are under development now; the talk will end with a presentation of some work in progress on this topic.\n\nLecture III: Using Transfer Operators to Find the Regularity of Refinable Functions\n\nA function f(x) is refinable if it can be written as a linear combination of the dilated and translated copies f(2x -n) of f. Such functions come up naturally in the construction of wavelet bases and in equally spaced subdivision schemes. Many techniques exist to find the regularity of such functions; for most, the complexity of the computation depends crucially on the number of coefficients is the refinement equation. This talk will present a link with transfer operators for the doubling operator, used in an estimation method for the regularity that can handle even infinite numbers of coefficients.\n\nTop of page"
