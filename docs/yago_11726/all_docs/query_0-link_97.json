        "text": "This Interactive workshop aims at exploring the origin of genres, their functions in cinema and their evolution, with particular emphasis on the latest developments. We first ask why we need genres at all and examine the variety of classification criteria that can be used. Then we focus on the specific features of genre films, analysing their conventions and their narrative structures. We then explore how different agents (from producers to audiences, from critics to film scholars) have used and still use genres, and highlight their economic, sociocultural and communicative functions. Finally, by taking a historical perspective, we explore how genres have evolved in the course of time and how modern cinema extensively use genre mixing and hybridization, thus pointing to the future of this important but complex category of film analysis. Part of the www.cinemafocus.eu research materials.\n\nThis reading list provides an introductory guide to fundamental texts and films. The selections encompass essential discussions about a range of topics. It is not expected that students will read the entirety of every book that appears below; they are encouraged, however, to use these suggestions in order to gain a comprehensive overview of the history of film and visual studies in preparation for their General Examinations. Students should also familiarize themselves with about 200-250 films from the additional \"Suggested/Suggestive Viewing List,\" being certain that their choices allow for a comprehensive knowledge of narrative, non-fiction, avant-garde, and animated films as well as videos and video installations."
