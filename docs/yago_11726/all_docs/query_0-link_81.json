What other comics FAQs are available?\n\nIn addition to this general FAQ, there are a number of comics FAQs and\n\nother on-line resources available about more specific topics or characters.\n\nInformation about how to obtain these can be found in parts 7-10 of the Welcome\n\nto r.a.c.* posts. FAQs are also available for the newsgroups:\n\nrec.arts.comics.alternative\n\nrec.arts.comics.creative\n\nrec.arts.comics.info\n\nrec.arts.comics.marketplace\n\nrec.arts.comics.xbooks\n\nBefore posting a query asking for information about a topic, check the\n\nindex of topics in Part 6, and the specific entry for where information\n\nabout the topic can be found in Parts 7-10.\n\nA1. Why not split off a new group for Sandman/superheroes/adult comics/etc?\n\nThis is a highly flammable topic of debate. Several dozen splits have been\n\nsuggested over the past few years. Relatively few have succeeded. Some\n\nreaders would still prefer going back to a single r.a.c. with no subgroups.\n\nHere is an incomplete list of previously rejected ideas:\n\nrac.superhero battlin' guys wearing tights. Failed in the 1992 vote;\n\nalso ambiguous (define superhero. be aware that we've\n\ngot *lots* of ambiguous characters by any definition\n\nso far).\n\nrac.image got less than 40% positive response in 10/94 straw poll.\n\nrac.mature implies other comics are immature. ambiguous.\n\nrac.adult implies sexually-explicit material. ambiguous.\n\nrac.sandman Sandman is ending as a regular series within the year.\n\nEmpheral groups like this are very unlikely to pass.\n\nA straw poll was taken of suggested new groups in 10/94. From that, six groups\n\nand a rename received sufficent support to justify going to a formal vote. Due\n\nto various problems, the first wave vote was not completed until 4/95. In it,\n\nthe groups rac.dc.universe, rac.marvel.universe, rac.other-media, and\n\nrac.elfquest were created. The discussion/voting process is currently taking\n\nplace for rac.dc.lsh, rac.dc.vertigo, and renaming rac.xbooks to\n\nrac.marvel.xbooks and should be completed around mid-June.\n\nDue to the delays, and a group creation rule against further reorging a\n\nhierarchy within 3 months of a reorg, there are unlikely to be any further\n\nsplits/new groups in the r.a.c. hierarchy until fall. It is expected that a\n\nsuggestion period for new groups, followed by a straw poll, will take place in\n\nSeptember/October '95. Groups which receive significant support in the poll\n\nwill go to the formal voting process. Bringing up new groups before then would\n\nbe pretty much a waste of time.\n\nWhen thinking about a split or new group, keep in mind that it will have to\n\nbe well justified. If you want your proposal to have a chance, it should meet\n\nthe following criteria:\n\n- Is the group easily and clearly defined (i.e. given any post, would it\n\ngo in the new group or an existing one)\n\n- Is it sufficiently different from existing groups?\n\n- Will a fair number of people *not* want to read the new group or stop\n\nreading the old group it's split off from?\n\n(there's no point in splitting off a new group if most people will\n\nread both the old group and the new group)\n\n- Is current group traffic too high? Will the split reduce it?\n\n- Will the topic die off in a few years, leaving us a redundant group?\n\n(Usenet reality is that groups aren't easy to get rid of, so groups\n\nwhich are about transitory topics are unlikely to pass)\n\n- Is there sufficient traffic already about the topic? (Usenet does not\n\nwork on the \"Field of Dreams principle\" of \"If you build it they will\n\ncome\". There has to be existing evidence of traffic)\n\n- Will at least 2/3rds, not a majority, of voters want to create it?\n\n- Can you convince thousands of people you are not a raving loon?\n\nPlease note: r.a.c. has seen a lot of split discussion over the years.\n\nSome proposals, such as the ones above, will likely be quickly shot down\n\nunless distinguished from what's been seen many times before. However,\n\nopinions do change. Within 18 months, sentiment went from less than 35%\n\nin favor of publisher groups to almost an 80% majority. Both rac.creative\n\nand rac.other-media took two votes to be passed.\n\nA2. Where can I get JPEG/GIFs or other scanned comics art?\n\nWith a few exceptions (Generation X #1, Cerebus: Operation Crazed Ferret, etc.\n\nall described in Parts 7-10 of these Welcome messages), you won't find that\n\ninformation here. It is illegal to post or make available for FTP scanned in\n\ncopyrighted art (the by far most common requests being for same). Yes, it's\n\nagainst copyright even if no one makes money off of it. Yes, it's against\n\ncopyright even if you *really* want it and don't have a scanner to make your\n\nown fair use copy. Before posting about this or other copyright related\n\nissues, you are urged to read the misc.legal copyright FAQ or Brad Templeton's\n\n10 Common Copyright Myths post in news.announce.newusers as past evidence has\n\nshown that most people do *not* understand even the basics of copyright law,\n\nlet alone the nuances. Hint: If the words \"Berne Convention\" have no meaning\n\nto you, you're not aware that under it any work is automatically copyrighted\n\nas soon as it is in a fixed form, and you think whether the copy is made for a\n\nprofit matters in terms of violating copyright, you're ignorant of the\n\ntopic and need to read up on it before posting.\n\nNote: there are people watching for this. An r.a.c.er got a cease and desist\n\nemail, with a cc: to Marvel, from a Berkeley Systems representative when he\n\nposted images taken from Berkeley's Marvel Screen Saver. Many companies have\n\nemployees reading the net.\n\nOnly images for which the copyright holder provided permission for posting\n\nwill be listed in the Welcome messages.\n\nA3. Are there pros on the net?\n\nYes. Lots of them.\n\nFirst let's get the three people who sometimes post here who are likely to be\n\nmistaken for comics pros out of the way. If you see a post by Art Adams, Kevin\n\nMaguire, or Michael Collins, as of the latest update of this FAQ it is *not*\n\nby the comics creator of that same name, but rather by people who happen to\n\nshare the name in real life (i.e. they are not trying to be confusing by\n\nassuming an alias).\n\nThe first pro on the net was probably Henry Vogel of the late, lamented,\n\nSouthern Knights. He's not been on for a few years, but one scene in the\n\nKnights involving breaking into a computer used an r.a.c.er's name and site as\n\nusername and password.\n\nFor a number of years, the only pro on was Peter David. He's worked a number\n\nof net references into his work, including a reference to Suicide Squid in the\n\ndialogue of Spider-Man 2099 #20, page 3 and the following from one of his\n\nPsi-Man books, written under the pen name of David Peters:\n\n\"Chuck was impressed to see the latest hardware rolling his way--the\n\ncomputer aided RAC 3000, Ultraflame Model.....'What does RAC stand for?' he\n\nasked.\"\n\n\"Really Awesome Car.\"\n\n\"'Oh.' He shrugged. Obviously a name developed by people in marketing.\"\n\nNot to mention individual netters who have shown up as characters in his\n\ncomics and novel work. It's considered bad form to ask for him to do this for\n\nyou.\n\nStarting in late '93, a lot of other pros started coming onto the net, in\n\naddition to a few others who came on after Peter but before then. A probably\n\nincomplete list includes, in alphabetical order: Scott Adams, Steve Addlesee,\n\nBill Amend, Chuck Austen, Mark Badger, Kyle Baker, Scott Bateman, Ward Batty,\n\nCliff Biggers, Addie Blaustein, Steve Blevins, Larry Bogad, Craig Boldman,\n\nRuben Bolling, Joyce Brabner, Tom Brevoort, MD Bright, Larry Brody, Fred\n\nBurke, Kurt Busiek, Louis Bright-Raven, Steve Campbell, Cedrick Chan, Bernard\n\nChang, Dan Chichester, Chris Claremont, Steve Conley, Rebecca Dart, Peter\n\nDavid, Dwight Decker, John Dennett, Alma Derricks, Evan Dorkin, Diane Duane,\n\nBen Dunn, Sarah Dyer, Mark Evanier, Matt Feazell, Kevin Fitzpatrick, Roger\n\nFletcher, Michael Fry, Steve Gallacci, Steve Gerber, Dave Gibbons, Clay\n\nGriffith, Al Gross, Phil Hall, Larry Hama, Amanda Hass, Matt Hawkins, Tom\n\nHeintjes, Mike Heisler, Matt High, Jay Hosler, Bob Ingersoll, Marie Javins,\n\nPatty Jeres, Jimmy Johnson, Rich Johnston, Jason Scott Jones, Matthew\n\nKelleigh, Jay Kennedy, Rick Kirkman, Jeff Lang, Jim Lee, Christian Lichtner,\n\nSteve Lieber, Randy and Jean-Marc Lofficier, Roland Mann, Jose Marzan Jr.,\n\nScott McCloud, Dwayne McDuffie, Jim Meddick, Larry Merrill, Patricia\n\nMulvihill, Will Murray, Fabian Nicieza, Teresa Nielsen-Hayden, Kris\n\nOverstreet, Tom Peyer, Richard Pini, Dan Piraro, Christopher Priest, Dave\n\nRawson, John Ney Rieber, John Rozum, Scott Saavedra, Mark Sherman, Dez Skinn,\n\nWalt Simonson, Laurie Smith, Roger Stern, Len Strazewski, Martha Thomases,\n\nGarry Trudeau, Gary Ushaw, Dan Vado, Ivan Velez, Martin Wagner, Mark Waid,\n\nLawrence Watt-Evans, Bob Wayne, Mack White, Bebe Williams, Elin Winkler, Paul\n\nWitcover, Marv Wolfman, Wayne Wong, and Gregory Wright. Neil Gaiman is\n\noccasionally forwarded posts about Sandman, but is not directly on the net.\n\nIMPORTANT!: Unless you know the pro doesn't mind, do *not* send email to a pro\n\nposting from a Compuserve address. Compuserve, and Compuserve only, charges the\n\nrecipiant of email from the Internet $.15 for each such message. It's rather\n\ngauche to make someone pay to read fan mail you send them, don't you think?\n\nBtw, pros are put on this list based on their posting on some group in the\n\nrec.arts.comics or alt.comics hierarchies or stating to the FAQ maintainer\n\nthat they are lurking. A pro is defined as people who have been paid for\n\ncreating (including editing) comics, are employed by a comics company, or do\n\nsignificant work for publications about comics. If a pro is active elsewhere\n\non the net, but not in these hierarchies, they're not listed. If they are a\n\npro in some other creative field, but haven't done pro comics work, they're\n\nnot listed.\n\nThe following etiquette has developed around the presence of pros. First off,\n\nthey are under no more obligation to read or answer posts than any other\n\nr.a.c.er. It's nice if they do, but they're not paid to do so any more than\n\nanyone else here. It's also considered bad form to ask a question specifically\n\nof a pro about a book or topic with which they have no special association, as\n\nopposed to a general query to the newsgroup. For example, it's fine to ask\n\nPeter David a question about the Hulk since he writes it, but not about the\n\nSuperman books since he doesn't and hasn't written them and has no special\n\nknowledge of them.\n\nThere are, unfortunately, fairly common debates about whether r.a.c.ers\n\neither suck up to or gratuitously flame pros. Probably both are true to an\n\nextent. In general, most r.a.c.ers feel that efforts should be made to treat\n\npros the same as other r.a.c.ers. Just as you wouldn't gush at or insult a\n\nnon-pro poster, you shouldn't do it just because the poster has had work\n\npublished. Unfortunately, there are some people who apparently take pleasure\n\nin the chance to flame, either by post or email, pros who appear here. Please\n\nnote that the majority of people here are *not* like that, and we don't\n\nappreciate that type of behavior. However, note that this does not mean that\n\na pro's work may not be criticized; that's considered fair game.\n\nFor pros who are both particularly active on r.a.c. and who generate a high\n\nvolume of queries or comments about their work, a convention has developed to\n\ncall their attention to such posts. Prefix the Subject: of such posts with\n\ntheir initials, logins, or last names in all capital letters, followed by a\n\ncolon. For example, if you wanted to address a query to Peter David, you'd\n\nhave: Subject: PAD: When will Aquaman encounter Suicide Squid?\n\nThe ones this seems to happen with are:\n\nDan Chichester: DGCHI:\n\nPeter David: PAD:\n\nMark Evanier: ME:\n\nSteve Gerber: SG:\n\nSteve Lieber: SL: or LIEBER:\n\nDave Rawson: RAWSON:\n\nMark Waid: MWAID: or WAID:\n\nDan Vado: DV: or DANSLAVE:\n\nFinally, general compliments/fan mail should be sent to creators via email\n\nrather than posted. Unless the post will be of interest to someone other than\n\nyou and the creator, it's bad netiquette to post rather than email. Note that\n\nmany creators (and other \"real world\" celebrities on the net) get such massive\n\namounts of email that you should not expect an answer or even that your email\n\nwill be read. After all, if they spend all their time reading and answering\n\nemail, they won't have time to do the creative work that's getting them all\n\nthat email in the first place. But keep in mind that sending email to\n\nCompuserve addresses is considered rude due to Compuserve's practice of\n\ncharging the recipient $.15 per Internet message.\n\nA4.

Who is Suicide Squid?\n\nShort answer: Suicide Squid is the de facto r.a.c. mascot. Squiddy was\n\naccidently created in April, 1991 when a netter wanted to ask the question\n\n\"Can someone tell me what's going on in Suicide Squad?\" and typed an \"i\"\n\nfor the \"a\" in Squad. Many netters responded with what had been going on\n\nin the Suicide Squid comic, which was a pretty good trick since it didn't\n\nreally exist. People then tried to reconcile the different versions of the\n\ncomic, and it mushroomed from there. Suicide Squid is now used in r.a.c.\n\nposts for a generic comic book title when one is needed, or as a way of\n\ncommenting satirically on various events in comics. The current\n\nwriter/artist of the book is usually said to be Alonzo Mori, and the SS\n\nfan club is the Black Ink Irregulars. The annual r.a.c. Awards are often\n\nrefered to as the Squiddies, and the r.a.c. team in the last three San Diego\n\nComicon trivia contests has gone by the name of the Black Ink Irregulars\n\n(and won all three years).\n\nA copy of the Squid relevant parts of just about every post mentioning\n\nSquiddy since his creation is kept at theory.lcs.mit.edu in the FTPable\n\nfile pub/wald/suicide-squid. As you might expect, it's quite large but\n\nfun to read.\n\nThere are Suicide Squid t-shirts, and wearing them is a good way to be\n\nrecognized by other r.a.c.ers at cons, signings, and other events.\n\nA7. How can I get a Suicide Squid t-shirt?\n\nThere have been three runs of these shirts, sold only to r.a.c.ers and a few\n\ncomics professionals. The art was done by pro artist Ty Templeton, and the\n\nshirts have appeared on an episode of Parker Lewis Can't Lose (then on Fox,\n\nnow being rerun on USA Cable in the U.S.) and on Prisoners of Gravity, an\n\nOntario public TV show about science fiction and comics which is also shown on\n\nsome PBS stations in the U.S.. A Squid shirt appeared regularly on the '93-4\n\nseason of Prisoners of Gravity.\n\nThe third run has been mailed out. There may be extras. Send email to\n\nt...@hq.ileaf.com to be put on a waiting list or to be put on a mailing list\n\nfor a fourth run should the third run be sold out (fourth run probably won't\n\nhappen until Fall '94, but could go earlier if a lot of interest).\n\nA8. Who is Paul?\n\nPaul is essentially Suicide Squid mark 2. Someone posted about a rumor that\n\nMarvel was going to kill off one of their characters and concluded the post\n\nwith a list of possibilities, one per line. Underneath the last, they had\n\ntheir name, \"Paul\". People promptly jumped on this, and started constructing a\n\ncomics continuity for a character named Paul. The continuity frequently made\n\nreference to the christian disciple Paul and his history. There is no\n\nrelation between this Paul and the New England Comics character and comic book\n\nPaul the Samurai.\n\nB. CURRENT EVENTS\n\nB1. What's this about Sandman ending?\n\nNeil Gaiman has announced that Sandman will end with #75 as a regular series.\n\nThe Kindly Ones was the last multi-issue major storyline. It will be followed\n\nby a short storyline titled The Wake (#70-72ish), and a some standalone one\n\nissue stories, possibly including an issue about what it's been like to write\n\nSandman. The final issue will be The Tempest, drawn by Charles Vess. Neil's\n\nannounced his intent to continue to do specials and mini-series about the\n\nEndless and their supporting cast, but not as a continuing, regular, series.\n\nDC will be doing an anthology series called The Dreaming, with stories mostly\n\nabout the existing DC characters Neil moved into the Dreaming such as Cain and\n\nAbel and the like.\n\nB2. When is the 1995 San Diego Comics Convention\n\nThe 1995, 26th Annual, SDCC takes place July 27-30. This is the largest\n\ncomics convention in North America, with literally thousands of pros, a huge\n\ndealer's room, and interesting programming...and 35,000 or so total attendees.\n\nNot to mention that the r.a.c. trivia team, the Black Ink Irregulars, has won\n\nthe trivia bowl the last three years, and will likely be going up against\n\na team of comics professionals this year as a special event)\n\nFeatured guests this year include: Neil Gaiman, James Gurney, Jeff Smith,\n\nJoe Sinnott, Ramona Fradon, Stan Sakai, Mike Baron, art spiegelman,\n\nFrancoise Mouly, and Alan Davis\n\nUntil April 15, registration is $40 for all four days for adults, $20 for\n\nchildren under 16 and seniors over 60. Children under 7 are free when\n\naccompanied by an adult member.\n\nSan Diego Comic Convention\n\nP.O.

What and When/Where are the Spirits Of Independence Conventions?\n\nThese are conventions \"sponsored\" by Dave Sim/Cerebus and a local\n\nself-publisher and retailer in each of the towns holding a SOI convention.\n\nOnes scheduled so far, with creators scheduled to attend and the retailer\n\nsponsor are: (Dave Sim and Gerhard will be at all conventions)\n\nManchester, Vermont - July 1, 1995\n\nSteve Bissette\n\nChicago, Illinois - August 12, 1995\n\nLarry Marder, Evan Dorkin, Steve Bissette\n\nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania - September 9, 1995\n\nDon Simpson, Bill Tucci, Steve Bissette\n\nPhoenix, Arizona - October 7, 1995\n\nJames Owen\n\nKansas City, Missouri - November 4, 1995\n\nRichard Corben, Steve Bissette\n\nKitchener, Ontario - December 3, 1995\n\nSteve Bissette\n\nMore information can be found at:\n\nhttp://www.digimark.net/wraith/spirits.html\n\nA complete text file containing all on the homepage except for maps and\n\ngraphics is available via anonymous ftp from:\n\nftp://digimark.net/wraith/Cerebus/Spirits/spirits.txt\n\nB4. Whatever happened to Akira, Big Numbers, D'arc Tangent, Grimjack,\n\nMiracleman, 1963, Mage II, Eye of Mogambo, Sweeny Todd, and Puma Blues?\n\nThese are all series at least seemingly vanished without having actually\n\nbeen cancelled, and in the midst of an active storyline. There are different\n\nreasons for each.\n\nAKIRA: According to its US editor, Marie Javins, Akira #34 ships in August\n\n1995 and is monthly thereafter until #38. #37 and 38 will contain tributes by\n\nwestern artists and writers such as Moebius, Mark Texeira, Alex Toth, and Kent\n\nWilliams. Whether the trade paperback collections will be completed is up in\n\nthe air.\n\nBIG NUMBERS: Two issues of the twelve issue series came out, written by Alan\n\nMoore and drawn by Bill Sienkiewicz. It's unclear whether #3 with art by\n\nSienkiewicz was completed or not. At any rate, the book went on hiatus in\n\norder to build up inventory. Sienkiewicz left the project, and was replaced\n\nby his former assistant Al Columbia. Columbia apparently finished the art\n\nfor one issue, and then destroyed it (the two most common stories are either\n\nhe burned it or tore it up and make a collage out of it). Moore would like\n\nto see it finished, but hasn't found an artist for it.\n\nD'ARC TANGENT: One issue of this came out back around 1982 from the team of\n\nPhil Foglio, Connor Freff Cochran (who at the time went only by Freff), and\n\nMelissa Singer. It was good and is missed. Foglio and Freff had a serious\n\nfalling out by the time of issue two, leading to lawyers. I won't try to\n\nexplain that, as both sides still have very different explanations. Instead,\n\nhere's the current, legally determined, status. Foglio has rights to do a DT\n\ncomic as of April 20, 1995. DT ideas from Freff and Singer are not to be\n\nused. Should there be a movie, Freff and Singer control any comic book\n\nadaptation of it. Freff has original novel rights, and Singer has all\n\nsecondary rights. As of 1993, Freff was working on DT screenplays, but I've\n\nno further knowledge of this. As of late 1994, Foglio stated not to expect\n\nany D'arc Tangent work from him until at least after the current 8 issue\n\nBuck Godot series wraps up, as he's busy with that, Xxxenophile, and doing\n\nwork for the Magic:The Addiction people.\n\nGRIMJACK: Creator John Ostrander would like to start up Grimjack again, but\n\nthe rights are held by what's left of First Comics after various corporate\n\nbuyouts and mergers. He's said that he gets the rights back after five years\n\nwithout publication though. There may also be a question about the ownership\n\nof Cynosure, since it was both created by someone else, and used extensively\n\nwithin the First \"universe\". Cynosure is also the name of a new comic by\n\ncompletely separate people, so it's not even clear what the trademark status\n\nis. On the other hand, Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski is currently\n\nworking on a script for a Grimjack feature film. It'll be an adaptation of\n\nthe Demon Wars/Dancer storyline, and JMS plans to be as true to the source\n\nas possible. He's a long time comics fan and should do a good job.\n\nMIRACLEMAN: Was published by Eclipse Comics, which basically disentegrated for\n\nboth market and personal reasons. The problem is that Miracleman is owned by a\n\ncombination of Neil Gaiman and Mark Buckingham (most recent creators, and\n\nowners of Alan Moore's original share), Eclipse's former owners (the company\n\nlegally ceased to be in December 1994), and possibly by the original British\n\npublisher although the last is less certain. At any rate, in order for it to\n\nbe published again, all owners would have to agree as to where, when, and\n\nunder what terms. This is unlikely to happen any time soon. Here's what\n\nNeil Gaiman had to say about it in May '95:\n\n\"Let's see. Eclipse filed for bankruptcy some time ago, fairly secretly.\n\n(At least, I've heard nothing from Dean about it.) I'm owed money by them,\n\nso is Mark Buckingham.\n\nMM 25 was finished years ago. They had it in a drawer for over a year, but\n\nnever published it. Nor did they pay Mark for drawing it.\n\nI managed to get the artwork back for MM 25 before the bankruptcy.\n\nThe legal status of Miracleman is a can of worms you'd not believe.\"\n\n1963: The mini-series finished, and was supposed to be wrapped up in an\n\n80-page Giant with artwork by the Image founders as the 1963 characters\n\ncrossed over with the present day Imageverse. This hasn't happened, and it\n\nis rumored that the delays lie with the artwork. It's not on the schedule,\n\nand no one seems to know when or if it'll be coming out. Meanwhile, the\n\n1963 characters were used in an issue of Shadowhawk.\n\nMAGE II: Matt Wagner's Mage series was supposed to have a followup. It has\n\nbecome a cliche in r.a.c. circles that the statement \"Mage II will be out\n\nin 18 months\" is time invariant. Who knows when it'll actually appear, but\n\nr.a.c.ers won't believe reports of it until they have it in their hot little\n\nhands.\n\nEYE OF MOGAMBO: According to Martin Wagner, \"Doug Grey was so disenchanted by\n\nthe lousy sales of Eye of Mongombo that he just gave up on the series after 7\n\nof its 10 issues and went back to the world of commercial art. A true shame.\"\n\nSWEENEY TODD: The last information from Neil Gaiman was that once Michael Zulli\n\nand himself had cleared room on their schedules for it, work would proceed.\n\nHowever, no further information as to when it might be available is\n\nforthcoming.\n\nPUMA BLUES: According to Michael Zulli in 4/95, it is very unlikely we'll\n\nsee any more of this series. No reason given.\n\nB5. What's this about Marvel buying Heroes World? And DC going exclusive\n\nwith Diamond? Why does this matter?\n\nIn early 1995, Marvel bought Heroes World distributors, which had been a\n\ngeneral comics distributor based in the New York/New Jersey area. As of July\n\n1995, Marvel & Malibu Comics will be sold exclusively through Heroes World\n\nDistribution. Few other items will be distributed through Heroes World, and\n\nmost non-Marvel/Malibu comics are not among those few. Retailers will have to\n\norder comics through multiple sources, as opposed to the former\n\nall-encompassing services of Capital City, Diamond, and similar distributors.\n\nWhy should this matter to you? For starters, most comic retailers will have a\n\nslightly smaller discount than before, hence reduced profitability. Some\n\nstores may be forced out of business this year. It's also the case that\n\nMarvel will have better information about what comics sell where. It's been\n\ntheorized that this may help lead to Marvel Stores similar to Disney or\n\nWarner Bros. Stores.\n\nAs fallout from this, late April 1995 saw an announcement that as of July 1,\n\nDC comics will be exclusively distributed through Diamond distributors.\n\nDiamond will continue to distribute other comics though.\n\nDue to lost profits and an uncertain market, your local store may cut back on\n\ncomics sold off the rack. You are STRONGLY advised to talk to your retailer,\n\nand make your buying preferences known in advance. We live in interesting\n\ntimes, and open communication is more important than ever.\n\nIt's also the case that determining Marvel's market share and sales will\n\nbe much more difficult than before, when Diamond and Capital City released\n\ninformation about company market shares and relative ordering of different\n\nbooks. Since only Heroes World will carry Marvel, there will be no way of\n\nobtaining this comparative information.\n\nSome posters believe this is an evil act. Others believe that MEG is no more\n\nevil than any other multinational conglomerate. Changes in the industry (such\n\nas the rise of Image Comics) have cost MEG millions of sales, and Marvel\n\nwants that market share back. What is certain is that the comics industry\n\nand markets will be in a state of flux for the next year or so, much more\n\nso than usual.\n\nC. GENERAL INFORMATION/HISTORY\n\nC1. Where does the money go from buying a comic?\n\nPer a January 1995 post from Matt High of Antarctic Comics, this rough guide.\n\nMileage may vary among different publishers, but this should be reasonably\n\naccurate.\n\n\"Out of the cover price of our books ($2.75/2.95 usually):\n\n40-45% goes to the retailer\n\n20-25% goes to the distributor\n\n13% goes to the printer\n\n7-8% goes to the creators/artists\n\n2% goes to shipping (UPS/USPS)\n\nthe remainder (10-12%) goes to the publisher (salaries, rent, utilities,\n\nsupplies, advertising, etc).\n\n...\n\nAntarctic Press is at the second-highest discount level...We sell distributors\n\nbooks at 65% off cover price, they turn around and resell them for 35-50% off.\n\nMarvel and DC sell their books to the distributors at 59-62% off, and they\n\nturn around and resell them to the stores at 40-57.5% off.\"\n\nC2. How can I become a pro comics writer or artist?\n\nLet's start with the bad news. Right now, there are basically four ways\n\nto become a pro comics writer.\n\n1) Get a job with a comics company. This way, you'll know of needed stories\n\nthe day they're needed, the editors will know you, etc. Notice how many new\n\nMarvel writers are Marvel assistant editors or have other jobs at Marvel?\n\n2) Get a reputation for writing outside the comics field. DC seems more\n\nopen to this than other companies (Nancy Collins, Rachel Pollack, Lewis\n\nShiner, Paul Dini, Sam Hamm, etc.), but if Stephen King walked into Marvel\n\nand said he wanted to write a comic, they'd fall over themselves getting\n\nhim one.\n\n3) Learn to draw. Sort of like one, but wartists are becoming more and\n\nmore common these days. But see below for artists.\n\n4) Start your own comic or comic company. Expect to lose money. But you'll\n\nget to write your own comic without company constraints, and you'll have\n\na portfolio if you decide to go for the big time. And who knows; it might\n\neven take off and make money. But don't count on it or quit your day job\n\nuntil you're sure based on several issues worth of sales.\n\nNotice that none of these say \"Write up one page story submissions and\n\nmail them to a company\". To be blunt, in the current market, your odds of\n\ngetting in doing that are incredibly low. You might, and I'll be the first\n\nto congratulate you if you can pull it off, but frankly the four ways\n\nmentioned here are *much* more likely to succeed. And note that none of\n\nthem offer great odds either.\n\nBecoming a pro comics artist is a lot easier, but still tough. As the old\n\njoke about making chicken soup goes, first catch a chicken. Or in this case,\n\nactually be able to draw at a professional level of quality. What you need\n\nto do is make up a portfolio showing that you can draw comics, and not just\n\npin-ups. Do about 4-6 pages of storytelling, with multiple panels on the\n\npages showing that you can work with the flow of a story. Don't skimp on\n\nbackgrounds; show you can draw buildings, cars, trees, civilians not in skin\n\ntight suits, etc. Also, when you do this, note your speed. If you can't draw\n\none professionally ready page per working day, you're too slow for a monthly\n\nbook. Keep this in mind when looking for work; you can kill your rep by\n\nclaiming to be much faster than you are and then blowing deadlines due to\n\nthe lie catching up with you.\n\nThen you can either mail (photocopies) of your art to companies, or, if you\n\ncan, go to any major comics conventions in your area and show your work to\n\neditors and possibly artists at the company tables. At the very least,\n\nyou'll get some useful criticism of your work. At the best, you may end up\n\ngetting an assignment.\n\nThere's also the Joe Kubert School in New Jersey, founded by long time\n\ncomics artist Joe Kubert. It's oriented towards producing comics artists,\n\nand a number of alumni have gotten jobs in the industry. Doesn't hurt in\n\nmaking contacts either, as many of the instructors are working comics\n\nartists. Its adddress is: The Joe Kubert School, 37 Myrtle Ave., Dover, NJ\n\n07801 (201)361-1327.\n\nOnline, check out the resources listed in Part 6 of the Welcome messages\n\nand detailed in parts 7-10. In particular, look for SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\n\nand COMICS GROUND. The latter is an on-line resource for aspiring comics\n\ncreators to display their work for commentary and criticism, as well as\n\nmake connections with other creators. Also look at SELF PUBLISHING PRIMER\n\nin part 9.\n\nC3. What are the Ages of comics?\n\nIf you read comics for any length of time, you'll encounter references to\n\nGolden Age and Silver Age comics. While I'm personally fond of the science\n\nfiction definition of Golden Age (\"The Golden Age of science fiction is\n\ntwelve\" i.e. whatever you read at that age was your Golden Age), in comics\n\nit's generally used to refer to comics from the 30s and 40s and those\n\nsuperhero comics that continued into the 50s. There is then a gap of a few\n\nyears with no real name for the comics published in that period. The Silver\n\nAge is generally considered to have begun with either the first appearance\n\nof the Martian Manhunter in Detective Comics, or the Barry Allen Flash in\n\nShowcase, both around 1955. However, Marvel's Silver Age is considered to\n\nstart with the publication of Fantastic Four #1 in 1961.\n\nAs for the ending date of the Silver Age, it gets fuzzy. Pretty much all of\n\nthe 60s and little of the 70s are included. Two events suggested for the\n\nend of the Silver Age are Jack Kirby's move from Marvel to DC and Mort\n\nWeisinger's retirement as editor of the Superman line.\n\nThere is no clearly defined Age after the Silver Age, although a number of\n\npossibilities such as Platinum, Bronze, Independent, and (in more depressed\n\nmoments) Mylar and Silicon (the last based both on computer coloring and the\n\never expanding female breast size in many comics these days) have been\n\nsuggested. A number of different events signifying the start of new ages have\n\nalso been suggested, such as Giant-Size X-Men #1 (new X-Men introduction),\n\nCerebus and Elfquest #1 (start of major groundlevel/self-publishing), Pacific\n\nComics startup (first major independent line), DC's Crisis, and even as late as\n\nImage Comics startup (first creator owned books to fight it out with Marvel and\n\nDC for the top of the sales charts). It can be amusing to chat about it, but\n\nit's doubtful that any real conclusions will be reached; they haven't been so\n\nfar, and there've been a *lot* of iterations of this discussion over the years.\n\nC4. What was the first #0 issue?\n\nZap Comix #0 came out in the late 60s/early 70s. Apparently the art to what\n\nwould have been Zap #1 was stolen, and Robert Crumb did new art that became\n\nthe published Zap #1. The art was later recovered, and printed as Zap #0.\n\nC5. Who are some of the gay characters in comics?\n\nA short list for DC includes Mindy Meyer's brother (Wonder Woman), Maggie\n\nSawyer and Toby Gaines (Superman), Extrano (New Guardians), Pied Piper\n\n(Flash), perhaps Jan Arrah, Lightning Lass and Shrinking Violet (Legion of\n\nSuperheroes v4). It has also been suggested that the Amazons in WW are gay to\n\nsome extent. Watchmen had Silouette, Hooded Justice, Captain Metropolis, and\n\npossibly others. Fighting American #6 has about the most unambiguous coming\n\nout scene you're ever likely to see in a code-approved comic.\n\nIn the Vertigo line, there are numerous gay characters. Offhand, Hazel,\n\nFoxglove, Judy, Cluracan, and Hal in Sandman, along with Judy. Lenny and\n\nKathy in Shade, Ray Monde in Hellblazer, Liz Tremayne in Swamp Thing, and\n\nothers.\n\nMarvel has Northstar, perhaps Mystique and Destiny. Mystique has been\n\nrevealed to have mothered two children, and it's strongly implied that she\n\nhad sex with Wolverine in Wolverine #51, so if she is gay, she's bi-. Note\n\nthat according to Chris Claremont, his planned origin for Nightcrawler had\n\nMystique, a shape-changer, being Kurt's father and Destiny being the mother.\n\nAt the time, Mystique was in male form and sufficiently traumatized from war\n\nincidents to not realize her true gender or past. Hector of the Pantheon in\n\nHulk is gay; while at first this was somewhat hinted around in the comic and\n\nonly stated in Peter David's CBG column, he has now explicitly stated his\n\norientation in the comic. Justice's father was gay, but in the main Marvel\n\ntimeline he closeted himself due to pressure/abuse from his father and\n\npassed to the degree of marrying and having a kid. From Malibu, Spectral\n\n(The Strangers) and Pinnacle (Mantra) are gay.\n\nIn the Milestone line, Fade in Blood Syndiate is gay, and Masquerade is\n\nwhat amounts to a self operated transsexual, although it's unclear what\n\nhis orientation is beyond that. Donner and Blitzen in Shadow Cabinet\n\nare lesbian partners, and Rick, a supporting character in Static, is gay.\n\nWarp Graphics has stated that all elves in the Elfquest comics are omnisexual,\n\nwith some cases of explicit gay relationships such as Dart and Kimo.\n\nAt Image, Sarah, aka Rainmaker, in Gen13 is lesbian.\n\nOthers include the women warriors in Epic's _Sisterhood of Steel_, Barney (The\n\nMasked Man), the woman from _Detectives, Inc._, Robbie and Rik from _Omaha_,\n\nand Terry, Pam, and George from _Zot!_. Several characters are either gay or\n\nbi in _Love and Rockets_. _Desert Peach_ has a gay main character, Erwin\n\nRommel's (fictitious) younger brother.\n\nMany of the above are gays-written-by-straights and are of questionable\n\nmerit. Others have been said by gays to have been handled quite well.\n\nC6. Where can I buy original comics art?\n\nOK, so strictly speaking, this isn't a FAQ. However, the following\n\nstrikes me as useful enough info to include here.\n\nFour Color Images, the comic art gallery, sells original art by a large number\n\nof comics artists. They're located at 32 Watts St. New York City, NY 10013,\n\n212-431-4234, Comi...@aol.com, and are open M-Sat 11-7. A catalog is\n\navailable by mail.\n\nAlso, the following will send a free sample catalog upon request:\n\nGraphic Collectibles, 22 Blue Hills Drive, Saugerties, NY 12477\n\nC7. Where are various comics museums located?\n\nInternational Museum of Cartoon Art, Boca Raton, FL\n\nPlans to open in January, 1996, Founder - Mort Walker, Board Members include\n\nWill Eisner, Jim Davis and Marty Nodell\n\nWords & Pictures Museum of Fine Sequential Art. Northampton, MA\n\nCurator - Peter Laird, rotating exhibits. Heavy on fantasy art, but a wide\n\nvariety of comics art is represented Other highlights include Mark Martin\n\ngargoyles, a large Gilbert Shelton mural, original Wrightson Frankenstein,\n\nMcKean, Sim/Gerhard, JJ Muth, etc. Admission normally $3, $1 on Wed.\n\nMuseum of Cartoon Art, Rye, NY\n\nWindsor McKay originals, Bathroom graffiti by 100s of cartoonists, including\n\nWill Eisner (i.e. when a cartoonist visits, they're invited to draw on\n\nthe bathroom walls.\n\nComic Art Museum, San Francisco CA\n\nRotating exhibits of original comic strip and comic book art\n\nNational Gallery of Caricature and Cartoon Art, Washington, D.C.\n\nThe museum was made possible by four cartoonists: Thomas F. Gibson, William\n\nRechin, Pat Oliphant and J. Arthur Wood. The gallery is built around Wood's\n\ncartoon collection. The hours are 11-4 Tuesdays through Saturdays, no\n\nadmission charge and it's located at 1317 F. St. N.W.\n\nMichigan State University Library\n\nNot quite a museum, but they have a, to my knowledge, unsurpassed special\n\ncollection of comics. The comics are available for reading in a reading\n\nroom; you fill out a request and the librarian brings back the comic,\n\nwhich you read in a specific room. No stack browsing.\n\nC8. Where did the \"On the Internet, no one knows you're a dog\" cartoon\n\nappear?\n\nPage 61 of the July 5, 1993 issue of the New Yorker.\n\nC9. How do you spell/pronounce the last name of artist Bill Sienkiewicz?\n\nIt's spelled as above, and pronounced \"sin-KEV-itch\".\n\nC10. What is \"The Cowboy Wally Show\"?\n\nTCWS is a graphic novel written and drawn by Kyle Baker around 1988. It was\n\ndone for Doubleday, not a regular comics publisher, and thus showed up in\n\nbookstores rather than comics stores. In a strip in Spy Magazine in 1993,\n\nBaker comments that more copies were returned than were published; it's\n\nhard to tell how much he was exaggerating.\n\nAt any rate, this book is now out of print and very hard to find. To give you\n\nan idea, Jim Cowling bought a copy via an ad on the net for $100. As for why\n\nit's in such demand, Jim later stated it was worth every penny to him. It's a\n\nvery funny book, and has contributed numerous .sig quotes to those of us who\n\nhave a copy. It's become something of an icon on r.a.c.m., and in the 1993\n\nAlternative Squiddies, one category (inspired by a thread the previous year on\n\nr.a.c.m.) was \"Body Part You'd Give Up For A Copy Of The Cowboy Wally Show\".\n\nAs of August 1994, Baker stated that he only has one copy of it, and had\n\nthought about reprinting it when he does a new book.\n\nC12. Where can I get comics on microfiche/CD-ROM?\n\nPer Mike Kelly, a customer of theirs:\n\nMicroColor International, Inc.\n\n85 Godwin Avenue\n\nMidland Park, New Jersey 07432\n\nUSA\n\nPhone 1-800-666-4054 or 201-445-3450 9 am - 6 pm (mon-fri) EST\n\n(EST is GMT minus 5 hours)\n\nFAX: 201-445-2924\n\nAsk for a recent newsletter and order form.\n\nMicroColor sells 5 issues of a comic per set, with the price in early '95 being\n\n$34. Each comic is on its own fiche. The stock is mostly, if not all, from the\n\nGolden Age in the 40s, and from a variety of publishers of that period. They\n\nalso have viewers for sale, but most public libraries have viewers you can use\n\nto view microfiche. Apparently they're thinking of getting into CD-ROMs, but so\n\nfar no source of reprinted comics on CD-ROM is known to me.\n\nD. DC STUFF\n\nD1. What was the Crisis on Infinite Earths?\n\nThe _Crisis on Infinite Earths_ was a 12-issue series published by DC in\n\n1985-6. The \"Crisis\" effectively revamped the entire DC Universe by\n\nmerging several universes (containing the various DC characters) into a\n\nsingle universe (whose history is still somewhat unclear in parts). The\n\nCrisis was used as an opportunity to change DC history retroactively (see\n\n\"retcon\" in the list of definitions in part 2), including the remaking of\n\nseveral main DC characters. Thus people refer to the \"post-Crisis\" Superman,\n\nWonder Woman, etc., as distinct from the \"pre-Crisis\" versions who existed\n\non \"Earth-1\" (Silver Age) or \"Earth-2\" (Golden Age).\n\nThe confusion *really* begins because the revamping and \"retconning\" didn't\n\nall take place in the Crisis limited series itself, nor in the comics\n\nimmediately after then. If DC had simply started all their series over from\n\nscratch, things would have been pretty straightforward. Instead, they declared\n\nthe Pre-Crisis history to be implicitly intact, until and unless they could\n\nexplicitly create the new, post-Crisis versions of characters and histories.\n\nThus, new changes were still being made in titles up to eight years after the\n\nend of Crisis. So, for example, the \"old\" Hawkman appeared in the \"new\"\n\nJustice League. But then Timothy Truman began writing _Hawkworld_, which\n\nretconned Hawkman's character; among other changes, Hawkman \"now\" arrived on\n\nEarth much later. So, the Hawkman who appeared in the new Justice League\n\ncomic (call him the Silver Age Hawkman, or the pre-Crisis Hawkman) \"now\" (in\n\nreal world time) \"no longer exists, and never has\" (within current DC\n\ncontinuity).\n\nBut then the creators realized the problem, so they said that most of the\n\nSilver Age Hawkman appearances in JLA were actually by the Golden Age Hawkman,\n\nand a new Hawkman was created whose purpose was to satisfy those few JLA\n\nappearances made after the GA Hawkman was known to have been MIA.\n\nConfused yet? Suffice it to say, the way DC handled the Crisis and its\n\naftermath confuses *lots* of readers and provides a perennial topic of\n\ndiscussion on r.a.c.misc. Zero Hour was said to be an attempt to \"fix\"\n\nproblems caused by Crisis and part of the McGuffin for Zero Hour was that\n\nCrisis actually didn't end, and all continuity problems until ZH were symptoms\n\nof this. (see next question).\n\nThere has been the occasional announcement that Crisis would be reprinted as a\n\ntrade paperback, but the latest word from DC is that they feel it would be too\n\nexpensive and don't plan to do so.\n\nD2. What was Zero Hour?\n\nZero Hour was intended to fix problems resulting from inconsistant post-Crisis\n\nDC continuity. It was a five issue mini-series in summer 1994 which will cause\n\nprice guides fits since the order of the issues was #4, #3, #2, #1, #0. The\n\nmonth after Zero Hour, all mainstream DC Universe books were #0 issues, making\n\nit even more fun for indexers.\n\nThe #0 issue had a timeline of the DC Universe which is considered definitive.\n\nThe end result of Zero Hour was the killing off and aging to their proper age\n\nseveral Justice Society members, and a resetting of the DC Universe such that\n\nit's much the same as the post-Crisis but with \"subtle differences\". So far,\n\nthe only specific differences stated are:\n\n# It's no longer true that Batman has caught his parents' killer.\n\n# Bruce Wayne did officially adopt Dick Grayson\n\n# Dick Grayson had a traumatic experience in his early days as Robin relating\n\nto failing to prevent someone being killed by Two-Face. This has seems to\n\nhave caused a character change to his being much more self doubting.\n\n# Catwoman's origin was completed revamped in Catwoman #0. Changes include her\n\nno longer having been a prostitute (which was itself a post-Crisis retcon),\n\nher not having a sister, and not having been trained by Ted (Wildcat) Grant.\n\n# Legion of Super-Heroes/Legionnaires: both books have started over completely\n\nfrom scratch, similar to the post-Crisis reboot of Superman and Wonder Woman.\n\nPast continuity has some effect on the books, but the writers are free to\n\nchuck it if they want to.\n\n# Wonder Woman does not have her powers on Paradise Island\n\n# Contrary to what was said in the early 1990s JSA series about her having\n\ndied when the JSA was in limbo, Al (Atom) Pratt's wife, Mary, was killed\n\nshortly after giving birth to Grant (Damage) Emerson circa 14-15 years\n\nbefore the JSA entered limbo. This would also invalidate her appearance in\n\na pre-Crisis \"Whatever Happened to the Golden Age Atom\" story in DC Comics\n\nPresents, since she would have died before the current heroic age began.\n\n# According to Christopher Priest, he was told circa June 1995 that Batman\n\nand J'onn J'onzz no longer know each other, and apparently Batman has\n\nnever been in the Justice League. This is strange, given that the JL's\n\nYear One annual, out just weeks before (and after Zero Hour) had Batman\n\nin it (and J'onn J'onzz for that matter)\n\nD3. Where can I find \"Man of Steel, Women of Kleenex\"?\n\nIn the late 1960s, Larry Niven wrote a hysterically funny essay in which he\n\nspeculated about possible problems that the pre-Crisis Superman would have in\n\nattempting to reproduce or just have sex with a Terran. The essay appears in\n\nNiven's collections _All the Myriad Ways_ and _N-Space_, and in the anthology\n\n_Alien Sex_. And yes, we know that Niven didn't take the bottle city of Kandor\n\ninto account. The story was also reprinted in Penthouse Comix #5, with some\n\nillustrations by Curt Swan (with all trademarked Superman indicators like\n\ncostume colors and S-shield obscured).\n\nD4. What are the different types of Kryptonite?\n\nPost-Crisis there have been only three main types, of which only one has made\n\nmore than one appearance. This, usually refered to just as \"kryptonite\", is\n\ngreen and has similar effects on Kryptonians as pre-Crisis Green K. While it\n\nhas no immediate effect on Terrans or other races, prolonged exposure has\n\nresulted in cancer due to radiation.\n\nMr. Mxyzptlk created a chunk of Red Kryptonite, which effectively removed\n\nSuperman's powers for a time.\n\nIn the Pocket Universe storyline, Superman encountered what amounted to a\n\nrainbow of types of pre-Crisis Kryptonite. He was not affected by any of it,\n\nalthough PU Kryptonians were.\n\nPre-Crisis, there were numerous types. These were:\n\nGreen Kryptonite: weakens and eventually kills super-powered Kryptonians.\n\nUsually harmless to other races, but one story in Brave and the Bold had a\n\ndevice used which resulted in Terrans being affected similar to Kryptonians.\n\nAnti-Kryptonite: similar to Green K, but affects non-super-powered\n\nKryptonians. This was a retcon used to explain why the non-powered Argo\n\nCity residents could be killed by what seemed to be Green K.\n\nX-Kryptonite: Only one chunk, it was created by Supergirl trying to find a\n\ncure for Green K. It gives Terrans, or at least Terran cats, Kryptonian\n\nstyle powers for a limited time.\n\nRed Kryptonite: Causes a specific, odd, effect. Often involved physical\n\ntransformations or mental changes. Each chunk had a different effect, and\n\ncould only affect a given Kryptonian once. Effects usually wore off in\n\n24-48 hours. Created when Green K passed through a space cloud.\n\nGold Kryptonite: Removes a Kryptonian's super-powers permanently. Created\n\nwhen Green K passed through a different space cloud.\n\nWhite Kryptonite: Kills any plant life from any world. Yep, another space\n\ncloud.\n\nBlue Kryptonite: Has the same effect on Bizarro Kryptonians as Green K does\n\non real Kryptonians. Created by the same imperfect duplicator ray that\n\ncreated the Bizarros.\n\nJewel Kryptonite: Remnents of Krypton's Jewel Mountains, it allows Phantom\n\nZone residents to focus their mental energy and cause explosions in the\n\noutside world.\n\nTwo notable fake varieties are Silver and Yellow K. Silver was used to keep\n\nSuperman from closely investigating what turned out to be a 25th (silver)\n\nanniversary gift for him from his friends, and Yellow was used by Luthor to\n\nfake out what he thought was Superman. It turned out it was a Superman\n\nrobot ordered to react to Kryptonite like the real thing. When Luthor found\n\nthis out, he returned all the gold from Fort Knox which he'd stolen.\n\nD5. Where are the \"real\" locations of Metropolis, Gotham City, Hub City,\n\netc., in the DC Universe?\n\nMetropolis and Gotham City have been equated to *many* different real-world\n\ncities over the years; there is no one correct answer. (Even if there were,\n\nthe current writers are under no duress to use it.) Hub City, from _The\n\nQuestion_, is a bit different; it is based on a combination of two cities in\n\nIllinois, one of which is definitely East St. Louis. Writer Denny O'Neil\n\nadmitted this at one point, but no longer does so in order not to offend\n\nresidents of the cities.\n\nMetropolis, as originally developed by Siegel and Shuster, was probably\n\nCleveland, the \"big city\" with which they were most familiar. There are also\n\npossible early references to Toronto. Later, Superman's home was moved to\n\nsomewhere in the BosWash corridor on the U.S. East Coast. _Who's Who in the\n\nLegion of Superheroes_ showed a 30th century Metropolis, which stretched\n\nslightly beyond New York and Boston in either direction, and used those names\n\nexplicitly in the description of Metropolis. John Byrne seemed to think it\n\nwas back in the midwest.\n\nGotham is a traditional nickname for New York City, but there is a separate\n\nNYC in the DC universe. It is definitely a port city, probably on the east\n\ncoast; too much plot has depended on that fact. Again, various sources have\n\nplaced Gotham City all along the east coast, often near Metropolis. The\n\ndistance to Metropolis has also varied; from hundreds of miles to linked by a\n\nbridge.\n\nIn DC Comics Presents #87 (Maggin written, Schwartz edited), Superman is\n\ntransported to Earth-Prime, which, pre-Crisis, was supposedly our Earth. His\n\nthoughts are:\n\n\"The Earth's there all right...but everything's out of place! New York is\n\nsprawled out all over where Gotham is supposed to be...Boston suburbs cover\n\nStar City...and Metropolis is...Metropolis is nowhere to be seen!\"\n\nAlso, in Adventures of Superman #425, Clark and Lois board a train travelling\n\nfrom Atlanta to Metropolis. Cities mentioned as in-between stops are\n\nCharlotte, Washington D.C., Philadelphia, and Gotham City, in that order.\n\nThis would seem to imply that both Gotham and Metropolis are in New Jersey as\n\nthe train is heading in a northern direction and New York City is not\n\nmentioned.\n\nFrank Miller once claimed that, metaphorically, \"Metropolis is New York in the\n\ndaytime, while Gotham is New York at night.\" Works for me.\n\nMayfair Games published an Atlas of the DC Universe, written by DC staffer\n\nPaul Kupperberg. While not completely official, it does jibe with locations\n\nthat DC used when its house fanzine of the mid-70s discussed this same\n\nquestion. The locations given for the main DC fictional cities are:\n\nMetropolis: Delaware\n\nGotham City: New Jersey\n\nStar City: far nothern California\n\nCoast City: on 101 near Sausalito between San Francisco and Oakland\n\n[Now destroyed, but based on maps shown in the Superman\n\ntitles, seemingly moved to midway between LA and SF.]\n\nMiddleton (where J'onn J'Onzz first operated): suburb of Denver\n\nLittleville (Robby Reed): Wyoming\n\nBlue Valley (Kid Flash): northwest Nebraska, near South Dakota\n\nCentral City/Keystone City: a bit north of Kansas City, Central is in\n\nMissouri while Keystone is in Kansas on the other side of the Mississippi\n\nCalvin City/Ivy Town (Atoms): both in Connecticut near New Haven\n\nDos Rios (El Diablo): 65 miles south of San Antonio\n\nFairfax (2nd Dial H for Hero): suburb of Bangor, Maine\n\nMidway City (Doom Patrol, Hawkman): Michigan, just east of Sault Ste. Marie\n\nSmallville: Kansas, 50 miles west of the I-70/I-35 interchange on I-70.\n\nThe population is given as 90,000 btw.\n\nMany people have noted errors in the geographical plausibility of the above\n\nentries. For example, the state borders near the Mississippi and Missouri\n\nRivers are obviously different in the DC Universe than in our world, and Coast\n\nCity can only be \"between San Franciso and Oakland\" if one intends to drive\n\nfrom one city to the other without bothering to use the bridge that directly\n\nconnects the two. These are from the Mayfair Games book, which was obviously\n\nnot edited as scrupulously as the r.a.c Welcome posting. :-)\n\nJohn Byrne is moving Wonder Woman to Gateway City, a fictional city not listed\n\nin the Mayfair Atlas. However, it was previously used at least twice. Once\n\nas the home of Jim (Spectre) Corrigan in the 1960s Spectre series, and it\n\nwas mentioned as the final home of Terry (Mr. Terrific) Sloane in the JLA/JSA\n\nteam-up where he was killed. At the time, Gateway City was on Earth-2, and\n\ngiven the Gateway Arch lookalike shown in Spectre, was clearly meant to be\n\na St. Louis analog. However, Byrne has said that his Gateway City will be\n\nsimilar to San Francisco. Blame it on Crisis I guess.\n\nOne final note: There's an actual small town in southern Illinois named\n\nMetropolis, located about twenty miles north of where the Mississippi and Ohio\n\nRivers meet. Their \"Welcome to Metropolis\" sign has \"Home of Superman\" on it,\n\nthey have a Superman statue on display, and every year they have a Superman\n\nfestival. The local paper, a weekly, is called the Metropolis Planet.\n\nD6. Who were the original Charlton equivalents to the characters in\n\nWatchmen?\n\nAlan Moore's original proposal for Watchmen used characters from Charlton\n\nComics who had recently been purchased by DC. However, these characters\n\ndated from the time then DC Editor-in-Chief Dick Giordano was in a similar\n\nposition at Charlton, and he wanted to make use of the characters after\n\nWatchmen was over, which for a number of them wouldn't have really been\n\nfeasible. So Moore changed the characters to originals, but who can still\n\nbe matched up well with the preexisting Charlton characters (even without\n\ncheating and looking in the back of the Graphitti Watchmen hardcover where\n\nMoore's notes list the match-ups).\n\nThe match-ups are:\n\nBlue Beetle I & II - Night Owl I & II\n\nThe Question - Rorschach\n\nNightshade - Silk Spectre II\n\nPeacemaker - The Comedian\n\nCaptain Atom - Dr. Manhattan\n\nPeter Cannon, Thunderbolt - Ozymandius\n\nOther characters had no direct Charlton counterparts. In particular, the\n\nMinutemen were a Moore creation.\n\nE. MARVEL STUFF\n\nE1. Isn't there a gay Marvel mutant?\n\nYes. This is Northstar (Jean-Paul Beaubier) from _Alpha Flight_. When John\n\nByrne began the series (issues #1-26), he made the point that Jean-Paul was\n\ngay, using tiny hints that are obvious if you're looking for them.\n\nIn issue #7, Northstar visits Raymonde Belmonde, presumably a former lover.\n\nIn #8, Aurora apparently knows (and disapproves) of his sexual orientation.\n\nIn #11's back-up story, James Hudson comments that Northstar didn't seem\n\ntoo interested in women. There were other tiny hints as well-- nothing\n\nthat really made sense unless you knew what to look for.\n\nThe hints were subtle enough that you might not get the idea independently.\n\nBut if you read the stories with the possibility in mind, it was quite clear.\n\nLater in the series, there were strong hints that Jean-Paul had contracted\n\nAIDS.\n\nUnfortunately, the Editor-in-Chief of Marvel, (there is debate on which\n\none; Jim Shooter or Tom DeFalco), declared \"There are no homosexuals in the\n\nMarvel Universe,\" and decided to \"fix things.\" After Byrne, Bill Mantlo\n\nwas writing Alpha Flight, and he retconned both Northstar and Aurora into\n\nbeing half-human and half-elf (thus their pointed ears), and decided that\n\nNorthstar's sickness was due to being outside of the realm of faerie.\n\nNote that nothing in the faerie storyline indicated that Jean-Paul was\n\n*not* gay, just that he didn't have AIDS. Also, Mantlo should be given\n\nsome credit. He dropped several \"hints\" as well, including issues #28 and\n\n#45 or 46. Unlike Byrne's, these had the subtlety of a sledgehammer.\n\nThe \"faerie\" change was later de-retconned, though I am unfamiliar with the\n\ndetails. In any case, much later, in issue #106, Northstar held a press\n\nconference is which he came out of the closet (He does *not* have AIDS). A\n\nMarvel editor explained that (paraphrasing), \"Many of our readers suspected\n\nthe truth all along, but now we decided to make the issue clear.\" Yeah,\n\nright.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the true powers-that-be at Marvel (i.e. way\n\nabove the editor-in-chief level and at the corporate level) got very antsy\n\nabout this story and the media attention it got. Northstar pretty quickly\n\neffectively went back in the closet in that little if any reference to his\n\norientation was mentioned during the rest of Alpha Flight's run.\n\nE2. How old is Kitty Pryde (of Excalibur)?\n\nThe short answer: Kitty was 13 1/2 when she joined the X-Men. She had her\n\n15th birthday in Excalibur #24. Soren F. Peterson reports that Claremont\n\nspoke at a con the weekend of July 27-28, 1991 and stated without a shadow\n\nof a doubt that Kitty Pryde is only 15. Now, there's no *way* that only 18\n\nmonths passed in the interim; too many events have occurred. But forget\n\ntrying to make sense of it. If Chris Claremont can't keep track of Kitty's\n\nage, why should you? Until the writers retcon it, 15 it is.\n\nHowever, as of October, 1993, an issue of Excalibur had Kitty saying:\n\n\"Unh-uh, Professor...we've *had* this conversation once too often,\n\nwhen I was still a *minor* [her emphasis], living at the mansion. The\n\nwhole stern-but-benevolent patriarch riff isn't going to *work* anymore.\n\nYou have a *case* to make -- make it as an *adult, one-on-one*.\"\n\nSo she may be 18 now, but it's not completely sure. Particularly since an\n\nissue of X-Men appearing at about the same time stated that only a year had\n\npassed since events which took place before Kitty's 15th birthday party.\n\nE3. What is Marvel's corporate structure?\n\nMarvel Comics is part of Marvel Entertainment Group. While Marvel\n\nEntertainment is a publically traded company on the New York Stock Exchange,\n\nonly 20% or fewer of its shares are available for trade. The other 80% are\n\ncontrolled by financier Ron Perelman (*not* Ron Perlman, the actor who played\n\nVincent in TV's Beauty and the Beast) via various holding companies. This\n\nmeans that Perelman cannot be outvoted, and has complete control over the\n\ncompany. It's estimated that at a stock price of $16, that 80% is worth\n\naround $640 million, so don't bother posting about trying to buy out Marvel\n\nunless your login is something like bga...@microsoft.com.\n\nCompanies under the MEG umbrella or otherwise controlled by Perelman include:\n\nNew World Media: TV/movie production.\n\nMarvel Comics: X-Men, Conan, Barbie, etc.\n\nToy Biz: action figures & such.\n\nFleer Cards: sports & non-sports. (bought in 1993)\n\nPannini Stickers: stickers (made in Italy). (bought in 1994)\n\nWelsh Publishing: backer of Bongo Comics (The Simpsons) and publisher\n\nof various children's magazines. (bought in 1994)\n\nMalibu Comics: Ultraverse, Bravura, ST:DS9, et al. (bought in 1994)\n\nHeroes World: comic distributor (not retail shops) (bought in 1995)\n\nSkybox Cards: non-sports (notably DC comic cards). (bought in 1995)\n\nF. INDY STUFF\n\nF1. Who's this Cerebus character people post a lot about?\n\nCerebus, written and produced by Dave Sim, is longest running and generally\n\nbest selling black & white comic on the market. Cerebus, the main character,\n\nis a 3 foot tall aardvark who has been, among other things, a barbarian, prime\n\nminister, pope, and outlaw. The series is expected to run exactly 300 issues,\n\nending in March 2004 (I'm not making this up) with the death of Cerebus. A\n\nlong time net.favorite, the comic can be read on several levels. Sim keeps\n\njust about all regular issues of Cerebus in print via what are called\n\nphonebooks; trade paperbacks collecting 20-25 issues at a stretch, all of\n\nwhich are kept in print. See near the back of any issue of Cerebus for details\n\non how to order them if your shop doesn't carry them.\n\nF2. What's the joke behind John Byrne's Next Men's letter column title?\n\nThe title is \"A Flame About This High\". The joke to which this is the\n\npunchline is \"You know what really burns my ass?\"\n\nG. STRIPS STUFF\n\nG1. Where can I get a Calvin & Hobbes t-shirt, stuffed tiger, phone, etc.?\n\nYou can't. Bill Watterson has made the decision not to merchandise C&H beyond\n\nthe strip itself, collections, and possibly a calendar. Anything else you may\n\nsee that uses the characters is bootleg, and is done against Watterson's\n\nexplicit wishes. Also, Watterson receives no money from the bootlegs, so\n\nin buying such you're only supporting ripoff artists, not the creator. In the\n\npast Watterson and his syndicate have won large judgements against\n\nmanufacturers of such material.\n\nG2. How can I contact syndicates about submitting my strip?\n\nAccording to Ted Rall in June 1995:\n\n\"For addresses and contacts at all the major and minor syndicates, THE\n\nsource is the Editor & Publisher Syndicate Directory. It comes out every\n\nsummer in July. Call 1-212-674-5151 to order it for about $7 if I recall\n\ncorrectly.\"\n\nH. OTHER-MEDIA STUFF\n\nH1. When's the James Cameron Spider-Man movie coming out?\n\nPer Hank Driskell, who works for Digital Doman, Cameron's special effects\n\ncompany, the movie is still tied up in legal wrangling among studios about who\n\nowns it. There is no script (as of May 3, 1995) as yet, and Cameron has at\n\nleast two movies definitely scheduled before he could do Spider-Man. There is\n\nno way the movie will be out before 1997 at the earliest.\n\nH2. What were the lyrics to the 1960s Spider-Man cartoon theme song?\n\n(Side notes: the Canadian group Moxy Fruvious does a, rather altered, version\n\nof this song. Also, per the warped mind of Nick Smith, these lyrics make for a\n\nhysterical comedy routine if you read them as you would a dramatic reading of\n\nan epic poem)\n\nSpider-Man, Spider-Man\n\nDoes whatever a spider can\n\nSpins a web, any size\n\nCatches thieves, just like flies\n\nLook out, here comes the Spider-Man\n\nIs he strong? Listen, Bud.\n\nHe's got radioactive blood.\n\nCan he swing, from a thread?\n\nTake a look, overhead.\n\nHey there! There goes the Spider-Man\n\nIn the chill of the night\n\nAt the scene of a crime\n\nLike a streak of light\n\nHe arrives just in time!\n\nSpider-Man, Spider-Man\n\nFriendly neighborhood Spider-Man\n\nWealth and fame, he's ignored.\n\nAction is, his reward\n\nTo him life is a great big bang up\n\nWherever there's a hang up\n\nYou'll find the Spider-Man\n\n[end of part 3]"
