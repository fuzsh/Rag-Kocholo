Having now experienced Georgia's many other scenic treasures, like the sunny coastal beaches and the pristine beauty of our lakes and rivers, I am pleased to share them with you. Georgia even has its own \"Little Grand Canyon\" that is well worth the trip off the interstate that you are accustomed to traveling.\n\nAs a former history professor, I would especially like to invite you to explore Georgia's rich and colorful past. Georgia is one of the original 13 colonies that eventually became one of the first states in our country. We are home to two American presidents, the world's most popular soft drink, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet and the world's largest college campus.\n\nMy wife, Shirley, and I maintain our family home in the mountains, but our memories of great Georgia vacations stretch the entire length of the state. We are honored that you are considering Georgia as your U.S. vacation destination. We believe that you will find, as we did, that each visit ends with a longing to return.\n\nWith warm best wishes and best regards, I am,\n\nSincerely,\n\nZell MIiier Governor\n\nZell Miller Governor\n\nI\n\n1994 Geor a On M Mind\n\nGeorgia's Travel Regions\n\nNorthwest Georgia Mountains (NW)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 142.\n\nNortheast Georgia\n\nMountains (NE)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 127.\n\nAtlanta Metro (AM)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 48.\n\nHistoric Heartland (HH) For a detailed map of this area, see page 95.\n\nClassic South\n\nClassic South (CS) For a detailed map of this area, see page 66.\n\nMagnolia Midlands (MM) For a detailed map of this area, see page 107.\n\nPresidential Pathways\n\n(PP)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 167.\n\nMagnolia Midlands\n\nPlantation Trace (PT)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 155.\n\nPlantation Trace\n\n\">\n\nColonial Coast (CC)\n\nFor a detailed map of this area, see page 81.\n\nHow To Use This Travel Directory\n\nGeorgia On My Mind is published annually by the Georgia Department of Industry, Trade & Tourism and Publication Concepts, Inc. to help you plan yo ur trip to Georgia and to guide you during your visit.\n\nThe State of Georgia is divided into nine travel regions, as pictured above.

The newlynamed James Brown Boulevard salutes this city's famous native son.\n\nJust a short drive east ofAugusta is Thomson, the birthplace and final resting place of Blind Willie McTell, one ofAmerica's most revered blues musicians of the '30s.\n\nCoastal Georgia blends a rich African American legacy with the allure of the oceanside. Brunswick and the Golden Isles, renowned today for sunny beaches and recreational variety, also offer a glimpse at plantation life in the black experience. Hofwyl-Broadfield Plantation\n\nremains much as it was nearly two centuries ago, although it ceased harvesting rice, its primary crop, in 1915. HofwylBroadfield is now a State Historic Site where visitors can examine dwellings, a museum, exhibits and artifacts which chronicle the history of the slaves who cultivated the rice fields and later settled in communities as free men and women.\n\nBrunswick and the Golden Isles are also the home of the Sea Island Festival, an annual celebration of black culture and heritage. Neptune Park, a popular leisure-time spot, is named for Neptune Small, a freedman and Civil War hero. And Selden Park was once the site of The Selden Normal and Industrial Institute, which opened in 1903 as one of the\n\nfinest black educational facilities of its time.\n\nSavannah, the coastal city where Georgia was established as an English colony in 1733, offers additional opportunities for insight into the African American experience. The Beach Institute, established in 1865 to educate newly-free black citizens in Savannah, now spotlights African American arts and crafts.\n\nBlack culture and heritage are celebrated as well at the King-Tisdell Cottage, a restored Victorian-era home. The First African Baptist Church, founded in 1773, and one of the several historically significant churches in Savannah, is said to be the oldest, continuously active, autonomously developed black church in America.\n\nNot On~AreWelellir,JYoulo H~The Road,\n\nBut AlsoWhere lo Get Off.\n\nIt's advice you can use every weekend.

The world will be watching more than just the televised sports action. Record numbers of visitors will be descending upon the city, testing its legendary southern hospitality and looking for amusements. Pleasant surprises await chem, and everyone else who visits, now or in 1996.\n\nAtlanta is a sprawling city. Viewed from the air, it appears to be a mass of greenery, with gleaming sky- scrapers at the heart of a spaghetti -knot of interstate highways. At ground level it is all trees, rolling hills, pretty neighborhoods, and a clean, architecturally impressive hotel and central business core. Underground, beneath the viaducts that cover the original streets and railyards of old Atlanta, are an atmospheric historic district and an entertainment capital.\n\nSince Atlanta's streets do not form a grid pattern, and since there is a profusion of streets containing the\n\nRunne,-s cool off after running in Atlanta's Peachtru Road Race on July 4th.\n\nword \"Peachtree\" (32 at last count), the easiest way to get oriented to Atlanta is to learn the main neighborhoods, suburban areas, and a few notable landmarks.\n\nFive Points is synonymous with central downtown. It is the intersection of Peachtree Street (the famous one), Marietta Street, and Edgewood Avenue. It's also the\n\nsouthern end of the business and financial district and the location of Woodruff Park, a $10 million gift to the city from the former president of Coca-Cola, Robert Woodruff. Covering an entire block, the park is one of the best places to catch a lunchtime glimpse of a cross section of Atlanta's citizenry.\n\nA short walk away, Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority's (MARTA) rapid rail lines cross at the main Five Points Station. The nationally acclaimed MARTA public transportation system, with 39 miles of track and 1,500 miles of feeder bus routes, is the least expensive way to go just about anywhere in Atlanta. Downtown to the airport is a cool 15-minute ride.\n\nAcross from the MARTA Five Points Station is the entrance to Underground Atlanta, now in its second exciting reincarnation. Covering 12 cavernous acres, Underground is filled with three dozen restaurants and nightclubs, over 100 specialty shops and streetcart\n\n32\n\n1994 Georgia On My Mind\n\nEvent Facility\n\nStep back in time to the opulent splendor of the Egyptian Pharoahs, or into the mystique of a Middle Eastern Palace. The Egyptian Ballroom and Grand Salon, are lavishly decorated with sweeping columns and ornamentation, creating the perfect setting for corporate events, receptions and association functions.\n\nThe Theatre, Egyptian Ballroom and Grand Salon have been completely renovated to their original grandeur. The Fox provides complete beverage service, a state of the art kitchen, and we can suggest musicians, caterers and other supporting cast.\n\nFor corporate events, conventions and association events, weddings or other social events, contact the Sales and Marketing Department.\n\nmerchants, and is the gateway to three of the city's historical attractions.\n\nLower Alabama Street was the original Underground, the hottest spot in town in the late 1960s and early 70s. It is now just one part of a totally redeveloped complex that reopened in 1988. Old Alabama Street Eatery is the colorful, fun-filled food court, and Kenney's Alley is entertainment row. Night dubbers can do the \"Texas Two-Step\" at Miss Kitty's Saloon and Dance Hall, boogie to 60s beach memories at the Atlanta Beach Club, take in a comedy or magic show, or enjoy a variety of folk, bluegrass, jazz, and rock music.\n\nThe Zero Milepost in Underground marks the spot where, in 1837, Colonel Stephen H. Long drove a stake into the ground, in near total wilderness, to designate a new southern terminus for the Western and Atlantic Railroad. The settlement that sprang up around it was called Terminus, later the town of Marthasville, and finally, in 1847, the city ofAtlanta.
