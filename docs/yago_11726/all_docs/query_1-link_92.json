        "text": "It has been over four and a half years since I originally made this list. Since then many of my picks have moved a little, and I have seen so many more movies, and I have wanted to remake it and make it much bigger ever since September of 2019. After years of taking notes I decided I was ready for the big upgrade all the way to 50.\n\nRules\n\nCannot be made by Disney. Only one per franchise, but spin-off franchises are allowed (I know 4 titles push it on what counts as sequel vs spin-off, but I have to finish the list, and I wanted to include them). I will get to sequels that would have easily made it at the end. That also means only one Batman movie, Justice League movie, etc. even if they are not in continuity with each other. Since I am much more familiar with Western Animation (and the Anime fans keep insisting they are a separate medium anyway) I am just focusing on Western Animation).\n\n50. Watership Down\n\nVastly inferior to the book, but plenty of its brilliance shines.\n\nHistory- Plenty of book adaptations came afterwards\n\n49. Open Season\n\nDumb plot, but it is funny and has a cool villain.\n\nHistory- Beginning of Sony Pictures Animation\n\n48. Isle of Dogs\n\nI think the drama is not that good, but the comedy is great.\n\n47. Smallfoot\n\nNot amazing but distinctly entertaining.\n\n46. League of Super Pets\n\nThis time it is the drama that really carries it.\n\n45. Lego Aquaman\n\nBy this point the DC Lego movies had really found their groove, and made an Aquaman movie very distinct from the DCEU version.\n\n44. Lego Ninjago Movie\n\nSurprisingly wholesome father-son movie.\n\nHistory- Key financial failure for Warner Animation group.\n\n43. Megamind\n\nI am surprised I do not like this movie more. I think it is all the superhero parodies I have seen. Anyway it is really funny, and it knows how to take itself seriously when it needs to.\n\nHistory- With its fanbase I am surprised it did not spawn a fanbase.\n\n42. Madagascar 3\n\nA great example of personal growth in a film franchise. To stick out from the others this is the only one with such a big Man (animal in this case) vs man plot. The other two are more about man (animal) vs himself. This one takes all that growth and uses it to face bigger external threats.\n\nHistory- Known for being a great way to end a series and a rare case in this age of stopping at 3 despite being a big hit at the box office.\n\n41. Lego Shazam\n\nIt is fun seeing The Justice League like this.\n\nHistory- Final Lego DC movie.\n\n40. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Mayhem\n\nDue to how new it is this is the one most likely to move big time if I ever remake this list again.\n\nI really enjoyed this distinctly child friendly version of some of my favorite heroes, while keeping all the dark themes they had since day 1.\n\n39. Justice Society World War II\n\n38. The Little Bear Movie\n\nGreat to see a childhood favorite series with bigger stakes while staying true to its country life style.\n\n37. Gulliver’s Travels\n\nThe minor comedy is really good, and the songs are very catchy.\n\nHistory- The second American animated movie.\n\n36. Ice Age\n\nsurprisingly adult. It is visually appealing and has good action scenes.\n\nHistory- Showed the power of Blue Sky and the ability of smaller studios to compete with Pixar and Dreamworks with CG animation.\n\n35. Charlotte’s Web\n\nGreat story with very good acting. Does have some tone issues.\n\n34. Despicable Me\n\nThe focus is where it needs to be, on Gru.\n\nHistory- Started a widely successful studio and franchise.\n\n33. Anastasia\n\nGreat job at showing emotions through songs.\n\nHistory- Bluth’s last financial success, and it almost made 20th century Fox Animation Studios into a major force.\n\n32. Prince of Egypt\n\nam going to get flack for not making it higher. It is this low as I consider The Ten Commandments to be a better version, and it is still a great movie.\n\n31. Titan A.E.\n\nMade by all the twists and character interactions.\n\n30. Green Lantern First Flight\n\nVery villain focused with the hero trying to navigate this new world.\n\n29. The Seventh Brother\n\nVery scary children’s movie.\n\n28. Tom and Jerry the Fast and the Furry\n\nI lost track of the death count a few million ago.\n\n27. The Adventures of Prince Achmed\n\nThis is the oldest surviving animated movie, and its limitations were made into a style that makes it beautiful stick out.\n\nHistory- The third oldest animated film and the oldest surviving one.\n\n26. The Peanuts Movie\n\nA great adaptation of a beloved series.\n\nHistory- Restored faith in Blue Sky Studios.\n\n25. Cats don’t Dance\n\nI think the villain is the key part holding it all together.\n\n24. Shrek 2\n\nA great comedy and drama in one.\n\nHistory- Was the highest grossing animated film of all time, and introduced Puss ‘N’ Boots.\n\n23. Bartok the Magnificent\n\nI have no idea if this is a sequel or a prequel, but it really did take the show in a whole other direction.\n\nHistory- The only DTV Sequel Bluth directed.\n\n22. Curious George\n\nCharming and heartfelt in every scene.\n\n21. The Lord of the Rings\n\nA mix of so bad its good and great scenes.\n\nHistory- Made a lot of money, and animated fantasies became much more common place.\n\n20. Into the Spider-Verse\n\nNot as a great as most people on the internet say in my opinion, but the animation and comedy are great. I just do not think it has the emotional payoff needed like the next movies have.\n\n19. Reign of the Supermen\n\nThis reminded me why Superman used to be my favorite superhero.\n\nHistory- Best film of the DCAMU\n\n18. Rise of the Guardians\n\nThe marketing was terrible, and I expected to hate it. I instead loved it. Big jump from last ranking.\n\nHistory- The first victim of Fox’s bad management of Dreamworks.\n\n17. Kung Fu Panda\n\nYes, the first one is my favorite, partly as Shi-Fu is my favorite character. He and Po are close to the top of my protagonist list. It is a perfect example of how good Dreamworks can be.\n\nHistory- Became the new codifier for Dreamworks movies.\n\n16. Puss ‘N’ Boots the Last Wish\n\nGreat villains, comedy, heroes, and drama. Just not that interesting on a rewatch, or it would have been around 10 spots higher.\n\n15. Arthur Christmas\n\nMy favorite film from Sony Pictures Animation. Great family drama.\n\n14. The Secret of NIMH\n\nBeautiful movie, and it focuses on motherhood\n\nHistory- Instrumental for the rerise of animated movies a few years later.\n\n13. The Flight of Dragons\n\nThe most adult film on the list. Very thought provoking climax.\n\n12. Balto\n\nThe major plot points are man vs society, man vs himself, man vs man, man vs nature, and man vs higher power. All of the first four are on here.\n\n11. Scooby-Doo on Zombie Island\n\nSome of the best movie villains I have ever seen.\n\nHistory- Saved a franchise and showed the value of DTV films.\n\n10. The Hobbit\n\nShows the power of even cheap animation over live action.\n\nHistory- Along with The Rescuers it restored interest in animated movies.\n\n9. Justice League vs. Fatal Five\n\nMy favorite time travel and mental health movie.\n\n8. The Plague Dogs\n\nMasterfully done tone by Martin Rosen, and the incredible ending.\n\nHistory- First animated film to be rated PG-13.\n\n7. Animal Farm\n\nWhile it has major issues its great scenes are always enough for me to overlook them.\n\nHistory- First British animated feature film.\n\n6. The Iron Giant\n\nYou probably already love it if you are reading this list.\n\nHistory- The codifier for vindication by cable.\n\n5. The Lego Movie 2\n\nWonderful twists and character development. Making it a musical really helps it to stick out from the rest of the franchise.\n\nHistory- Bomb that cemented end of the franchise.\n\n4. An American Tail\n\nWhenever I have family issues this movie solves them.\n\nHistory-Ended the dark age of animation after nearly thirty years.\n\n3. The Dark Knight Returns Part II\n\nFinally, I get to make a list with it where it is not number one. This movies changed my life, motivated me to get a job, and be an essential worker during the pandemic.\n\n2. All Dogs go to Heaven\n\nVery personal for me, as I converted to Christianity while watching it.\n\n1. The Land Before Time\n\nMy favorite movie of all time and the reason I became a film buff.\n\nHistory- solidified the Renaissance age of animation.\n\nThese next two would have made the list. They were not made by Disney, but were ultimately distributed by them.\n\nThe Brave Little Toaster\n\nRon’s Gone Wrong\n\nThese are par of a franchise that otherwise would have made the list in the five Tree Star category (ranked from best to least great)\n\nThe Dark Knight Returns Part I\n\nThe Lego Movie\n\nThe Land Before Time 5\n\nThe Land Before Time 7\n\nBatman The Doom that Came to Gotham\n\nKung Fu Panda 3\n\nThe Land Before Time 3\n\nBatman Under the Red Hood\n\nJustice League Gods and Monsters\n\nKung Fu Panda 2\n\nScooby-Doo and Batman The Brave and the Bold\n\nStat Time\n\n1910s\n\nThere are two films from this era. The first ever animated feature is The Apostle followed by Without a Trace from 1917 and 1918 respectively (I am using the English translation titles). Both were made by Quirino Cristiani. Both films along with almost every thing he did is lost. The Apostle got better reception, and its plot sounds better, but again nothing from this decade survives, so I cannot give either of them the top spot.\n\n1920s\n\nThis decade only has one film. The Adventures of Prince Achmed. It is the oldest surviving, and it is very good and fun to watch. That makes it by far the easiest pick for best film.\n\n1930s\n\nThis decade there are 5 features (I am not counting hybrids, but there are two Soviet one by the same director). Cristiani again made a film that is considered lost. Peludo City is the first one with sound, and I always heard it was considered his best work. That leaves the French The Tale of the Fox, the German The 7 Ravens, the American Snow White, and the American Gulliver’s Travels (coincidently one of the Soviet films was also about Gulliver).\n\nI know Snow White sounds like the easy win, and it easily wins the overall popularity contest, but this my list. The film is boring. Gulliver is actually a good movie. I could not find Ravens in English. I looked through it, and it looks very nice, but mostly focused on showing off that they made an animated feature like Snow White would later do. It does look much better. Fox is a pretty fun movie. It is about an immoral protagonist trickster (Reynard), and I enjoyed it. It looks great too, but it gets repetitive especially towards the end. Fox is pretty good, but not as good as Gulliver. Gulliver wins.\n\n1940s\n\n26 features this year and for the first time Chile, China, Japan, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Italy, and many other countries made an animated feature. Just looking through the list there is an obvious top two in Pinocchio and Dumbo. Pinocchio wins.\n\n1950s\n\n40 this decade. Frist time Canada and The United Kingdom made one. I am not a fan of The Silver Age of Animation. Unlike the Golden Age I find most of the movies here boring. Of the five Disney films the only one I like at all is Lady and the Tramp. Other than those it is a group of unrecognizable movies except for the easy winner, Animal Farm.\n\n1960s\n\nIsrael made their first film. Hanna-Barbera made their first theatrical film. There are many films here I never heard of, and part of that is this is fully in The Dark Age. Animated films were not profitable, and very few were made in America without much ambition. The only contenders I saw on the entire list were A Boy Named Charlie Brown and 101 Dalmatians. Dalmatians win. There were many tv specials, but I do not consider specials to be movies. They are too short (made for TV movies do count).\n\n1970s\n\nAs I said before I divide the dark age into two parts. Part 1 is full of unambitious films, but that ends in 1977 with films like The Hobbit, The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and The Rescuers. Next year has The Lord of The Rings. Funny that my four favorite animated films of the decades came out within 20 months of each other. My pick for top film of the decade of these four is The Hobbit.\n\n1980s\n\nMy all time favorite movie, The Land Before Time, came out in 1988 so it wins. 2nd place is All Dogs go to Heaven, and 3rd is An American Tail. This is my absolute favorite decade for animated films. I love so many movies from it.\n\n1990s\n\nLike last decade I know right away what the winner is, Toy Story. The whole year of 1995 is great with films I love such as Balto, The Land Before Time 3, and A Goofy Movie. For the rest of the decade I find myself enjoying the direct-to-video films more than the theatrical ones.\n\n2000s\n\nUnlike last two decades I have no idea what is going to win this decade beforehand, and it takes a while to go through the lists. Early candidates are The Emperor’s New Groove and The Land Before Time 7. Next comes Monsters Inc, Ratatouille near the end of the decade, and those are my four candidates. I am giving the title to… This is by far the hardest to rank. I was born in 1996, so this is where I have the most nostalgia for and all of them seem so right for the pick without something notable to separate them from the top of the pack like the next decade has (the only reason I could do the ’80s so easily is how many days of thought I have put into that decade). I am completely unable to do this, and it will throw off all my coming up charts. Sorry.\n\n2010s\n\nIn my previous history of animation post I debated Wreck-It-Ralph, Coco, and The Lego Movie, but those ratings are now out of date. The winner (to the surprise of none of my loyal readers) is The Dark Knight Returns Part II.\n\n2020s\n\nTime to look at all the animated films I have seen from this decade, all… ten of them. Batman Soul of the Dragon currently has the top spot.\n\nChart time\n\nAside from Pinocchio every film here was a financial success with Toy Story being the biggest hit. None were directed or written by the same person but Bruce Timm was in charge of 2 of them and John Lasseter was also in charge of 1.5 of them. 2.25 of these are direct-to-video.\n\nNext time on Tuesday the 25 is Charlotte’s Web 2.\n\nI have reviewed many DTV film partly to bring recognition to some obscure films that were normally ignored. I then realized there are many theatrical animated movies I also want to discuss, thus here is a new series about films that I think less than half of big animation fans have seen. It will be started by one of the first animated movies ever made.\n\nIt is around the year 1934. The Fleischer Brothers, Max and Dave, are two of the best animation creators. Their signature characters are Betty Boop and Popeye the Sailor man. They are probably the best at the technical side of animation besides Quirino Cristiani, as they invented many new techniques for it, and they are the very first to mix live-action with animation. It was first done with Koko the Clown.\n\nThey work for Parmaount, and they have been trying to make a feature animated movie. Paramount did not think it would succeed. At the time there were five animated movies (over half made by Cristiani) and one was not even released yet with five others being made. It is a risky idea, as no studio has ever done it, but three independent creators have done it. This is nowhere near as revolutionary an idea that modern day audiences would think who likely believe that Snow White was number 1.\n\nAfter a certain film became the highest grossing of all time The Fleischers were given their dream job of making a feature, but they now had hordes of executive meddling to deal with. They only had eighteen months to make the movie compared to four years with Snow White despite the Fleischers having half the budget, they were ordered to make it very similar to Disney, and they had to quickly train hundreds of new animators to make it. They had hordes of problems, yet I do not feel that bad for them. They had around 800 workers. In contrast Cristiani made three features all by himself (Walt Disney was amazed and begged him to move to America and direct features for him), and that is part of big budget movies. You must be able to deal with executive meddling, and the more money the more meddling, and many films had far more issues. Time to see if the legendary animators could pull it off in a film that holds up today.\n\nThe credits seem to be the typical opening for an early animated movie, except they are actually the codifier. This is the first time a movie ever credited its voice cast. It begins with Gulliver’s ship (Why is he the whole crew?) getting bombarded by waves, and Gulliver washes up on the shore, and a tiny lantern shines in the distance.\n\nGabby the town Crier comes in, and he is clearly ordered by Paramount. He is voiced by Pinto Colvig who had a great career as a voice actor. His characters include Oswald, Pluto, Goofy, Munchkin voice, Grumpy, and many more. Unfortunately his very high pitched and cartoony voice he uses here is a notable contrast to the rest of the film, and he is probably the worst character. Thankfully his singing voice is really good with “All’s Well.” He is the town crier (he finds dangerous things and reports them to everyone else), and he is singing a mandatory song, and he quickly changes it to a song about complaining about his boots being full of water. It is very catchy and quite funny.\n\nHe wonders on to a giant hand and takes a full seventeen seconds to realize what it is. I would not be sleeping easy knowing this guy is keeping the town safe (there is a threat of war people! Hire somebody alert!)\n\nI hope this picture helps show how good the lightning animation is (it looks better in movement). The comic animation is very good as well, thus currently the movie has great animation and bad acting.\n\nIn the meantime there is a wedding being planned between Glory and Davids, children of Kings Little and Bombo respectively. Bombo is a warrior king (no wonder he named his son David, a guy known for being great at everything except being a father and faithful husband), while Little looks more like a wealthy aristocrat\n\nThey are clearly old friends, but then they do one of the few things from the actual story. In the book the Lilliputians are fighting for a trivial cause, how to fry an egg. Here they are fighting over the wedding song. For Little the family song is “Faithful.” For Bombo the family song is “Forever.” Considering “Forever” is sung more in the film I think the filmmakers liked it more and I do too. Remember these guys are a warrior culture. To motivate the troops for a cause that may means dying they almost always focus on immortality in some way, whether it means an afterlife or in being remembered forever. The kings declare war over their disagreement, and sadly the scene is bad. It is too slow, and I would think they could just agree to play the songs back to back.\n\nThings finally look up again when Bombo smashes the wedding cake, starts to leave, but then looks back at his friend. He starts to cry and then happily walks back to make amends. Instead Gabby runs in and Little’s useless guards in an attempt to grab him grab the warrior king instead. He then declares war again after he clobbers both guards. As a student of history this is actually very accurate. Some tiny changes in timing or wrong/right place at the wrong/right time have completely changed history.\n\nThe two guards are easily clobbered by the king, which shows something very important. King Little is heavily outmatched. The king admits this to himself, as Bombo tells the spies it is war. If I am a soldier my morale wlil not be boosted knowing I am commanded by a king called “Little.” Is his General named Sir Ender? Gabby finally convinces Little about the giant. This scene is just too slow. It has god stuff like some funny gags, but that is sadly all. It gets worse before it gets better.\n\nFor three minutes these idiots cannot tell they are on top of something. Come on movie, you were doing so well.\n\nIt finally gets god again when they discover they are on Gulliver and do the iconic part of tying him up. Despite how slow it is I love the following scene. They tie Gulliver up in a very funny way. They use a pulley to pick up Gulliver’s hands and actually use them to help tie the knots. They the use pulleys to pick him up, put him down on a huge cart, and roll him back to the city. They go through his things, including his revolver and accidentally fire it.\n\nThis wakes up our titular character half way through the movie. Everyone hides, but Gabby gets locked out and Gulliver grabs the guy claiming he has a wife and millions of kids. The king finally proves why he is king and comes out demanding the safety of his subjects.\n\nGulliver is completely rotoscoped, which is using photorealism to animate a character. The Fleischer Brothers invented rotoscoping, and this is really incredible animation. Gulliver looks like a storybook character come to life, incredible definition in his face (especially the eyes) and fingernails, and he looks completely alien to the Lilliputians. Little orders everyone to attack Gulliver, but then a huge war fleet lead by Bombo directly attacks him, and their arrows shoot the word “Forever” into the walls. The scenes then cut to Little’s subjects fleeing the projectiles for dear life and apparently Gulliver takes pity on his want-to-be-murderers and stares down Bombo who smartly breaks the speed sailing record. Little realizes Goliath is who they need and recruits him as the down protector.\n\nThey then make him a new suit while singing “Hap-Hap-Happy Day.” This sounds familiar.\n\nI love accusing Disney of plagiarism as much as the next Bluth fan, but I can not honestly do it here. The songs have very similar lyrics, but in Disney’s versions they are very matter of fact, like every single day is that happy. Here it is a big celebration, as they are never this happy. Their inevitable capitulation has been replaced with a savior. I do not care for this Disneyesque song, but I really like the visuals, like how they shave him with farm tools and use other typical household objects to give Gulliver a makeover.\n\nRemember how they had to copy Disney? I think the next part is fighting back. King Bombo has his own animal sidekick, a pigeon.\n\nHe is sending a message (kill Gulliver) to the spies at Liliput, and they are my favorite characters. They are completely mute for a long time, which makes them seem stealthy despite constantly spying while wearing conspicuous black cloaks. Despite the smaller one being notably dumb (and funny in a similar manner to Dopey) the other two are legitimately able to seem threatening despite facing Gulliver.\n\nI am sure most of their antics are not so fun to read about, but their scenes are always funny partly due to how restrained they are. It is more realistic every-day actions that work to the story becoming more serious.\n\nThe party ends and Gulliver tucks in the same people who wanted to murder him earlier. I think that is why Gulliver works as a character. He is the archetype of a flawless character, and I almost always hate them. Yet, he is surrounded by such flawed characters. He is clearly trying to help them all morally, which actually makes me relate to him. While I am not that good, Gulliver appeals to the side of me that wants to help people, especially the undeserving as they need it most. We also get some sad scenes with him looking at the water and wanting to go back home. He even has the torturous task of releasing very tiny boats into the sea. It is hard to pull off a Superman archetype, and I think the Fleischers did it successfully. The camera then shows that the spies took Gulliver’s revolver after a slingshot from idiot spy (clearly the big idea guy which makes him their version of Walt Disney. I doubt that was an intended jab). They use pullies resembling a slingshot to practice firing it.\n\nPrince David comes to see Princess Glory only to be attacked by the guards.\n\nPresumably the guards are thinking this.\n\nGuard 1: What happened in the Bible when David had to win the love of a princess again?\n\nGuard 2: He killed two hundred enemy soldiers and brought their foreskins to his future father in law. I am scared.\n\nGulliver saves them from David by blowing them away, and he reunites the two love birds. He then get them to combine “Faithful” and “Forever” into one song.\n\nMeanwhile the spies use the pigeon to get the news back to Bombo who writes back that he will attack at Dawn (to much information in case pigeon gets captured) and permission to kill Gulliver much to the bird’s horror. He sends back the exhausted bird for the news.\n\nGabby finds the bird and surprisingly proves himself more capable than Dick Dastardly at catching pigeons and warns the entire city. Since Gulliver is still with the lovers Gabby goes to get him as every soldier sings the war anthem, “All Together Now,” A fittingly ominous song that illustrates how in war everyone thinks they are the good guys even if there are none. To continue the big tone shift the bird heroically drags his exhausted body to the spies who actually start talking as they try to find the note.\n\nThey refuse to fire until they receive the orders from their king, which is actually good for their side and the movie. For the movie it helps illustrate that their are really no good or bad guys on either sides, just hordes of people obsessed with fighting over trivial matters. If there are other great powers firing unprovoked will also look incredibly bad, and they need permission for it. Just ask the confederacy and other nations that were harmed diplomatically by firing first.\n\nThe voiceless and exhausted bird points to Gabby and big idea Spy tricks him into going to them, and they grab the note. They also throw Gabby into a food bag to finally shut him up.\n\nThe pacing then gets very slow and dramatic. The Lilliputians are on the shore and Bombo’s huge fleet is in the water. Gulliver tries to make a last second truce only for cheers of war to come from the shore and projectiles from the sea. Gulliver decides the best way to do this without death is to slowly walk into the water and grab all the anchors to move the fleet out of the way. He even saves a large group of Bombo’s men who jumped in the water and then goes back to save the one he missed.\n\nIt then all looks good until Glory points out to David that the spies are pointing the revolver at Gulliver. David rides up, as time practically stops. David saves Goliath from the slingshot. The one biblical joke I am sure was intended. He grabs the gun knocking it and himself off a cliff. This makes me realize something about the comparisons to Snow White. I have seen Snow White many times, yet I have never, ever, ever cried in it. Nor have I ever felt the slightest interest for anyone’s well being in it. This film just made me cry about a death that will obviously be undone. In the meantime everyone looks in horror at David’s somehow not dead body.\n\nGulliver finally goes off on the selfish and stubborn kings until David is risen from the dead (In the Bible he instead ordered the death of his top general for mass disloyalty and murder).\n\nThe ending is definitely harmed by the deus- ex-machina. This is why I hate deus-ex- machina for important plot points and love Diabolus-ex-machina.\n\nSince this is about war why not kill someone? It now shows the big negativity of war, death. It is like if an adaptation of The Black Cauldron ended with someone jumping in the Cauldron and the came back to life… On second thought this has been done worse. It has flaws in characters, ending, and early pacing, but it also has huge victories in animation, climax, story, and message. It came out when America was dreading fighting a repeat of World War I, and this fight matches it in many ways. A war best of if nobody wins that is seen as pointless. I like it way more than Snow White, as this has way better unity of plot and pacing. A few scenes have padding, but every scene develops the plot, characters, or both. I overall really enjoyed it, as I felt the god outweighed the bad. Without the executive meddling I expect it would have been a better movie, but the Fleischer Bros still pulled it off."
