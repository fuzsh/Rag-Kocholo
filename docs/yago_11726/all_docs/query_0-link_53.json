What is spotted dick and chocolate gatto? I am a great fan of desserts as my waist line will attest to. I'd like to try them if the recipe is easy enough.\n\nJack\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDoxy Bowtruckle - Oct 15, 2004 5:56 am (#1653 of 2977) Reply\n\nI'm really sorry for starting all this food talk!\n\nChocolate Gateaux is like a moist layered chocolate cake with a filling and or topping of cream. There are so many variations of it, all as delicious as the next. Some use fruit like cherries (black forest gateaux) thick pipped cream on top and some with nuts!\n\nSpotted Dick is like a swiss roll, i think, but made with currants or sultanas, hence the spotted bit! It may have jam in it too. will have to find out that one for myself.\n\nOff for my bowl of custard!\n\nDoxyB\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLupin is Lupin.

Back that truck up. I don't believe I ever said I'd be buying these things for you. I just said they made me think of you. And really, isn't it the thought that counts?\n\n***wondering if Catherine's MSN is still down***\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Oct 15, 2004 6:24 am (#1655 of 2977) Reply\n\nWhoa, you two. Back that truck up. I don't believe I ever said I'd be buying these things for you. I just said they made me think of you. And really, isn't it the thought that counts? --Lupin is Lupin\n\nActually, I didn't even have to read between the lines to know that you were just thinking of us. And yes, the thought counts.\n\nAs for you, Kim, I am so torn. What would suit you best? Something that comes in a little box, or perhaps the complete works of William Faulkner? Or maybe Dictionary of Southern Culture?\n\nAs of last night, my MSN was still not operational. In fact, it messed up my computer for a while, too.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Oct 15, 2004 6:29 am (#1656 of 2977) Reply\n\nYou get her the Faulkner, I'll get her the Dictionary of Southern Culture with a complimentary bookmark strategically placed somewhere in the \"c\" section, as it were.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulia. - Oct 15, 2004 6:55 am (#1657 of 2977) Reply\n\nOh, Kim, a Shakespeare umbrella?! I could really use one of those with all this rain we're getting lately.\n\nUmmmmm, food. For the record, my family is a Chinese food on Christmas family. Although I do agree with the rest of you that all this food talk is making my very hungry.

I am so excited today. A few days ago I had to attempt to get my computer running again by myself, husband wasn't in. To put things into perspective, I hadn't even done a simple copy/paste or e-mail attachment until just a few months ago. I was really struggling to get it to work. Everything that I had sent from our \"loaner\" computer to our old dinosaur was coming out all messed up.\n\nWell, I am very proud to say that after three days of messing with this I managed to get all of those bugs worked out. I am so pleased! I know that it's silly, but I feel as if I've really accomplished something that I never thought that I could. At 2:30 this morning I was doing a happy jig and saying \"Yeah, me!\"\n\nI've found that the key to forcing me to properly convert these things was that if I hadn't managed to fix these things, I would have lost all of my HP documents and pictures. THIS was the extra incentive for me, as there was NO WAY that I was going to lose this stuff! (If it had been my husband's pictures of knives, flashlights, motorcycles or whatever that was in jeopardy it would have been a vastly different story, I assure you!)\n\nI woke up with the weather distinctly cool this morning. It's a really nice change for us. I've seen times that we were b-b-q'ing outside in our shorts on New Year's Day. We don't often get a chance for such nice weather. I'll take it!\n\nHope that everyone has a great day!\n\nBarbie\n\n_____________________________________\n\nGood Evans - Oct 15, 2004 8:54 am (#1659 of 2977) Reply\n\nHello everyone\n\nJust got back from Brighton (clearly one has to get ones Priorities right and get straight on lexicon). I'm going to check out posts and then be in the chat room later.\n\nSo much to tell. I have drunk soooo much champagne and wine this week I am afloat (am sipping a glass at presnet so cheers to all potties!!). Week started well - sunday we did the bus ride and unbeleivebaly I won best ladies outfit!!! (1 bottle of champers). Next night at a dinner with the president I was given a bottle of champers for the help I did with our performance awards this year. (hey hey two days and two bottles!!!). then the conference started on tuesday and I have given three papers (well I was supposed to but no one turned up for the optional session (am I that boring??) - seriously it clashed with something else and the advertising was a bit awry so I'm not taking it personally! I have also hosted a group of sponsors (that is, made sure they had yet more champagne and showed them to their table for dinner last night) and last night at the performance awards dinner, Chris Barrie (eat your heart our Leila) was our special guest and compere - he was very funny. And although I ddint meet him I did see him relaly up close.\n\nWhat a week - I finished my last paper at 11.50 this morning and I am now really pleased it is the weekend as I am soooo tired. We had a suite in the hotel overlooking the sea (never had that before, with a balcony) only trouble was it rained almost all week.\n\nStill what a week - I've had a great time - only missed my lexicon fix!!!! But at dinner on tuesday night I was sat next to a chap that is known as \"remus lupin\" in a legal matter (one of the lawyers referred to one of the parties as a bit dursleyish and then they allocated nicknames based on the book to everyone on their side, he he). He didnt know much about HP going in to the meal but he certainly does now!!!\n\nAnyhow thats it - speak soon\n\nJulie\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAccio Sirius - Oct 15, 2004 10:21 am (#1660 of 2977) Reply\n\nJulia, You know you can heat up a pop-tart nicely with an iron on a cotton blend setting! Ah, dorm life. I remember making many a macaroni and cheese dinner in a hot water pot. Of course, butter was a luxury so unless we nicked it from the cafeteria, it was made only with water! Yikes. By the way, I had some friends at the UCONN game the other night, of course, they were in the WVU section! (my old school!).\n\nHappy Friday to everyone!\n\nSpeaking of Thanksgiving and turkeys, can anyone vouch for the deep-frying method? My husband is very curious.

We had an article in our paper last year about an old man who got severely burned when his fryer tipped over. The instruction I read about safety were somewhat alarming: like making certain you have a fire extinguisher nearby; do it at least 20 feet from your house on a flat surface, and don't let children or pets anywhere near it.\n\nThat said, it does sound yummy. My dad has been trying to convince my mom for the last few years to let him try it.\n\nSince my family has a Thanksgiving curse on it, we have always dissuaded him so far. We just know that we'd probably burn not just the house, but the whole neighborhood with it!\n\nMaybe someone will post something good in the recipe section on fried turkeys! Hmmm, how to make it Harry Potter themed....Fried Phoenix? Ick.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJohn Bumbledore - Oct 15, 2004 12:39 pm (#1662 of 2977) Reply\n\nGood afternoon all!\n\nPheonix Song, I second the TGIF! Congrats on the 'puter transfer stuff. They haven't made these 'puters easy for everyone yet, and that doesn't mean you're (collective for all non-geeks) a dumbie (like all those books suggest.) I am a tech geek but I also consider myself a handy-man about the house. Well, having tried (time and again) to solder fittings in copper pipes, I can tell you I soon learned to appreciate the skills of a professional plumber. I would much rather build a computer from parts (including operating system and application software than to try soldering copper pipes any time soon. Ah, I'm rambling, but the point is you have to be smart to learn something totally new on your own. So I can empathize with the frustration you when through and admire you determination. Here is to your smarts, determination, and success! <):^D Party Hat Time! Woo Hoo!\n\nLupin is Lupin, though I didn't make your list (probably since I don't think I've posted to this thread before now) you can note that I would be happy with a pair of warm socks (like my HP namesake).\n\nAccio Sirius, Love your Avatar! But about Julia's breakfast, why should Julia ruin a perfectly good toaster pastry by heating it up?

Giving papers, drinking champagne, going to dinners, and educating lawyers about HP all together sounds like a wonderful occupation.

Using an outdoor grill & mesquite chips, we usually buy only the turkey drumsticks and stick them on a salmon.\n\n(No, that last part was a joke; we're not good little Darwinists, we use two different serving platters.)\n\n_____________________________________\n\nAccio Sirius - Oct 15, 2004 2:59 pm (#1665 of 2977) Reply\n\nChemyst, I never tried it in the wrapper--I always used waxed paper.

I had wondered where to even start describing the process... For all of those considering it, I've yet to find a person that doesn't rave about how good they are when cooked this way. I'll just give one other piece of advice, do not place a frozen turkey into the hot oil. The frozen ice crystals will not react nicely to this. (Yes, I'm warning of this because someone has actually done it.)\n\nWe all seem to be a bunch of food obsessed people lately. I'm right there with you. My mom always makes the BEST homemade fudge. She's well known for it with our friends/family begging for her to make some all year long. She has a staunch rule about the fudge, though. She only makes it between the third week of November and Christmas. (Good for me that she does, to be honest!) A few years ago my husband's assistant at work got a batch for Christmas. He tried in vain to convince my mom to start a tradition of making \"Valentine's Fudge\" or \"Easter Fudge\" because he couldn't stand to think about waiting a whole year for more. (And we think that it's only women who get obsessed by chocolate!) It's a standard joke in my family now, \"Mom, how about making some Columbus Day fudge for us?\"\n\nBumbledore: Thanks for the praise! I do feel so enormously proud of myself for fixing old Dino the computer without help. To be perfectly honest, I'd have been glad to have kept my loaner computer forever, (it was much nicer and more modern!), but I needed to give it back before I sued for visitation rights. Oh well, comfortable old shoes are better than no shoes at all.\n\nDaioma: Since you're already there due to the time difference, how's tomorrow looking for us?

Just apparated back, this little titbit won't really fit on an established thread and it's not worth setting up a new one. You may have heard it before;\n\nWhen JKR went on her first book tour in the USA an adult tried to give her a brown envelope. One of the assistants that accompanied her whisked it away before she touched it. This happened 17 times during one book signing.\n\nAt the end of the session JKR asked the (American) assistants why they had grabbed the envelopes. They told her that the envelopes would contain ideas/plots/thoughts/suggestions for future Harry Potter novels. If any of her next books included anything like the contents of the envelopes, then she may be sued.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nMarie E. - Oct 15, 2004 5:15 pm (#1670 of 2977) Reply\n\nI will never, ever again, leave reading this forum for the end of the week.

My favorite is a citrus turkey. I generously rub margarine (or butter if you prefer) and dried orange and lemon peel on the outside and under the skin, then stuff the inside with peeled lemons, clementines, and oranges. The gravy this turkey makes has a nice tangy/sweet taste to it. Sometimes we'll change it up with a garlic turkey, following the same procedure, but with garlic outside and garlic cloves and onions inside the bird. YUM!\n\nJulia- We also do the whole movies/ Chinese food on Christmas. It makes me a little sad that the movies used to be pretty empty, but now are crowded with families that can't find anything better to do together on such an important day for them. Of course, its also sad that there won't be a new HP movie to see this year!\n\nI can't think of British food without remembering the episode of 'Friends' where Rachel makes trifle and puts in beef. Ahh, at least now we have 'Joey' to fill that empty 'mindless yet funny sitcom' void.\n\nWell, off to rinse with salt water again.

If you are even occasionally offended by anything, don't see this movie. It's got violence, graphic sex, and Kim Jong Il...all done with puppets. Personally, I thought it was the most hilarious thing I've seen in years. I was watching it with only one coworker & we both had tears in our eyes from the laughter. I'm sure in a theater full of people it'll be even more so.\n\nMarie is right about her first car. It was a tank--right down to the olive green color. All it was missing was the gun turret on top. On the plus side, she was pretty much guaranteed to walk away from any collision not involving an 18-wheeler.\n\nNice to know I'm your favorite brother...out of a group of one.

No, no, no! You're not crazy, you're adventurous. Most of our family vacations have been with three children, so there was that additional middle-seat & no window thing to contend with. (I'm going to let some of my ideas on child-rearing seep into the next paragraph. I'm not judging anyone, just telling what I found and what worked better for us, but if you get easily offended, just skip ahead.)\n\nFor me, the purpose of family vacation is: FAMILY. So electronic entertainment gets the kibosh, or at least, is highly limited. I've found that gameboys & cd players with headphones are OK for 2-hour trips, but not for multi-day cross-country vacations. They are too isolating, and over-use actually increases tensions. I know it sounds hokey, but, singing and storytelling games break up monotony better because it forces some interaction. If we do use an electronic boost, books on tape where everyone listens have an advantage over headphone games because it gives us common ground for restaurant conversation. When the kids were little, we used some intro to foreign language tapes with hilarious results; and when they were teens, we listened to lectures on history and business law which led to some very interesting discussion. (A Feed the Geek philosophy of child-rearing.)\n\nOne potentially stressful situation actually turned out as a blessing in disguise due to vacation circumstance. Family modesty levels are often less than normal when everyone is sharing a motel room or staying in a friend's home. We were on a road trip to the Pacific Northwest and over 2000 miles from home when my daughter, then 20 months old, sees our friend's child who is a year older being potty trained. My daughter, who was born with a bit of an you-can't-stop-me attitude, decides she can do that! And she pretty much did. Because we were with her 24/7, we never once had to say, \"Why didn't you come tell me?\" By the time we got home two weeks later, she switched to wearing diapers only at night. It was the easiest potty-training ever and our biggest problem was finding underwear small enough for daytime. She was tiny and they don't make a 1yr. size.\n\nSo you see, Haymoni, what might look crazy on the surface sometimes isn't.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nEbonyRebel - Oct 17, 2004 10:11 am (#1689 of 2977) Reply\n\nI like Paneuse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulia. - Oct 17, 2004 11:14 am (#1690 of 2977) Reply\n\nGood afternoon everyone.

To make all those nifty avatars I need a graphic editor and I just have a graphic viewer. I will also need something that can make thumbnails. Any suggestions? I am looking for something free. If you do have any ideas let me know, my e-mail address is under my profile. Thanks.\n\n_____________________________________\n\ntimrew - Oct 17, 2004 3:06 pm (#1694 of 2977) Reply\n\nPadfoot: Send Betty our best Julia!\n\nThat goes for me, too! All the best, Betty.

Hopefully they can find the right mix of meds for her soon. Having to bounce in & out of the hospital can't help her any.\n\nOh, and good luck on the midterms, Julia. I can vaguely remember those from the dark past when I was in school, and they kinda sucked.\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Oct 17, 2004 4:14 pm (#1696 of 2977) Reply\n\nHappy Sunday to all.\n\nI am pleased to finally have enough freedom to post properly. My mother-in-law is gone, and to all who really know me, you will understand what this means.\n\nChemyst, I read your post about child-rearing and trips with fascinated interest, as we have had our own travel challenges. I am pleased to have an ally against the automatic \"tv in the car\" thingy.\n\nWe had a child who, for the first 28 months of her life, no matter what, screamed in the car non-stop. Neighbors recommended getting an in-car TV as the solution, but we figured that since our oldest child was already half-nutso listening to the screaming, trying to watch TV over it wouldn't help much.\n\nAlso, unbeknownst to these friends, we aren't big TV watchers at our house. So hubby, being the cute cheapo that he is, thought, \"Why buy an appliance that we don't use IN the house?\"\n\nInterestingly, we became addicted to Harry Potter at our house about this time. So on long car trips, we listen to Harry Potter books or other good books on CD. The \"baby,\" who is now 4 1/2, hasn't cried since.\n\nSo there is a happy ending after all!\n\nCheers to Betty, and feel better; Hi to all my friends who have posted; and Hi to all the friends who haven't posted yet, and the new friends I haven't met yet!\n\n**waves to everyone**\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDenise P. - Oct 17, 2004 5:41 pm (#1697 of 2977) Reply\n\nWe always take the kids with us when we go places. This weekend, we went to a Cub Scout camp out that was 40 min away. Over the summer, we drove from TN to UT and back with 6 in the van with me. I think we may be going back again in the summer of 2005 since it will be the bigger family reunion, my grandmother's family rather than just my mom's family. This means we get to see extended cousins, aunts, great uncles etc. It is really cool to see the resemblances between every but a bit unnerving when you are getting a soda from the cooler and someone who you don't know exclaims \"You have to be Kathy's daughter!\"\n\nThe camp out was a lot of fun. It did get chilly, dropping to 40°F the first night and 35°F last night. We got to hear wild cats, coyotes and owls (as well as assorted other woodland creatures) during the night.\n\nIt was muzzleloading season and even though we were on a protected area, there were still poachers. The ranger had an attack when he realized that we were hiking in an area where he knew there were poachers. We were hustled back out of there quickly. Apparently he didn't think we would go down there and for whatever reason, decided to not go chase off the poachers.\n\nWe had a great time, we did a scale model of the universe using tissue paper and rocks, we had a contest to see who could find the most unique 4 complete items that would fit on a penny without touching one another or overlapping, we played games, we had a puppet show and learned a lovely song called Road Kill Stew (it was that or Ruff, the Tragic Maggot)\n\nWe are already planning a Winter Camp Out. Now, I am off to try to read a few threads before calling it a night!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeila 2X4B - Oct 17, 2004 5:44 pm (#1698 of 2977) Reply\n\nHi everyone.

I've lived in here for almost a year, and I can say I have never been in a friendlier forum family.\n\nYou know, when we were kids, we were usually really nice to each other. We used to go on extended-family trips all around southern Norway and to Denmark, never any fighting. But when we turned 14... Let's just say that my cousin once removed and me, who had been best friends since we were 3 suddenly weren't best friends anymore. Nothing really happended, we just grew to think the other one was hopeless. It took most of high school to get us on speaking terms again. We are friends again now, however.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeprechaun Jack - Oct 19, 2004 5:33 am (#1756 of 2977) Reply\n\nMany thanks for the well wishes.

(Which I highly recommend!!!) As it was mentioned earlier it can be dangerous if you don't know what you are doing & one of the common accidents people have with the process is putting too much oil in their cookers. Just as a hint, what we always do is when we start to thaw out the turkey we put it in the cooker and then fill the cooker up with water till it covers not only the turkey BUT is at least 5 to 6 inches from the top -- then remove the turkey & mark the water level on the cooker. That way, when we are ready to fry the thawed out turkey we know exactly how much oil to add without it overflowing.

I only gave a website because I like to back up my statements with proof; I knew I was right to begin with being an insufferable know-it-all and everything. And no, that was not me at the Huey Lewis and the News concert in '85.\n\nOh, and here's more. I was sooooo busted this weekend. I was taking my 15 year-old niece to her grandmother's. I was trying to do the bonding thing by agreeing with her that I totally hate Avril Lavigne (however you spell that chick's last name) too. Anyway, my niece, who always has control of the radio, was flipping through stations and I said \"Oh wait, I like that song\" at one point. I had no idea whose song it was, but you guessed it. I had just told her to stop on one of Avril's little ditties.

Well, if I must be included in this collection of geeks then I'll out myself too.\n\nMy first concert ever was Michael Jackson and his brothers on the Victory Tour. It was at JFK Stadium in Philly, which doesn't exist anymore (I think The Stones Steel Wheels tour was the last show there). My girlfriends and I had a slumber party afterwards. We LOOOOOOVED Michael. I was HUGELY into Duran Duran, and at one point or another had my hair cut like each of them. Simon was last because his hair was shortest.\n\nI was down the shore with a friend when Live Aid happened, and we were crabbing and flounder fishing that day and we made her Dad bring the transistor radio out on the boat so we could listen to it. (Transistor radios...) I did get to see The Hooters open the show, which was a big deal since they were Philly Boys.\n\nMost freakish moment? Our Junior High had a \"Gofer\" Day, where the 9th Graders were sold to 7th and 8th graders to raise money for the Student Council. I was purchased by a cadre of students and some teachers, who all chipped in to save me from the \"Freak\" guy. Aside from carrying 6 people's books and getting their lunches I had to perform on stage. I was dressed all in \"Pleather,\" with studded belts and boots, hair teased out and Adam Ant make-up on, lip-synching \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" while dancing with a giant stuffed mouse.\n\nOk, there's a TON more, but I would really like my State Fair buddies to want to be seen with me.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Oct 20, 2004 5:48 pm (#1793 of 2977) Reply\n\nThanks for sharing, Julie.

This may be a historical \"urban legend,\" so if it is incorrect, I will stand to learn something. In a modern setting, without the historic connotations, I suppose it could be thought of as a rallying cry of the underdog against the mighty, or ruling forces.\n\nAlso, I might've heard that there is an adult beverage **not glorifying intoxicants to the underage, here!** called a Rebel Yell.\n\nFinally, where I grew up, in the Richmond, VA, area, there was an amusement park called Kings Dominion north of town. The first \"real\" grown-up roller-coaster I ever rode was called \"The Rebel Yell\" and, to my eight year-old self, it seemed rather frightening. **waves to the second grade teacher, Mr. Flannagan, who took me on this roller-coaster over his wife's protests!**\n\nWhew.

Nothing like fun and excitement in the neighborhood! This afternoon, a friend came over with her kids so we could canvas my neighborhood selling popcorn for Cub Scouts. On the way back, we came to a house that had an alarm going off. We could smell smoke. We looked around the house, it appeared to be vacant and had a for sale sign. We decided to be cautious and called 911. I clearly told the operator that the house appeared to be vacant and that while I could smell smoke, I could not be sure it was from the house or from outside in the neighborhood somewhere. I did say the alarm was going off. I was concerned that maybe some kids broke in there and set something on fire. Well, within just a few minutes, 2 fire trucks and an emergency response vehicle came screaming into the neighborhood. Naturally, all the neighbors came out to see what the fuss was and I found out THEN that the alarm has been going off since Tuesday! The real estate agent had been called loads of times about the alarm from various neighbors (I am only 5 houses down and never heard it). Wanna bet he gets his butt out there and turns it off now? I feel bad that the fire department came out for nothing but I also felt it was better to err on the side of caution. The firemen were very nice, talked to the kids and told them to come down to the station for a tour. The smoke we smelled was coming from behind the house, in another yard.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nPinky - Oct 20, 2004 8:28 pm (#1804 of 2977) Reply\n\nNope. Not a salad shooter.

Best concert I've ever been to was R.E.M. at a small place in Pittsburgh that no longer exists. It was the Fables of the Reconstruction tour and they sang Happy Birthday to a friend of mine. They were great. Now, without Bill Berry, they are just mediocre. I forgot that I saw The Romantics and Huey Lewis in a high school gym in Fairmont, West Viriginia in the early 80s.\n\nDenise, Our piggie is quite the piggie. I'm not sure how much he weighs, but he is a big fellow. My in-laws were in Peru last year, where they dined on guinea pigs. I made them promise not to tell my daughter that story. Quick question.

You'll be happy to know that after last night's events my dinner stayed where it was, although my stomach did still hurt today.\n\nI just got off the phone with Betty. She's still in the hospital, but she sounds a lot better than she did the last time I talked to her. She says hello to everyone, she misses us all, and she sends out hugs to everyone.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Oct 21, 2004 8:04 pm (#1829 of 2977) Reply\n\nCatherine,\n\nI know you tried \"Pig Butt on a Stick.\" Mmmmm.....Pig Butt.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nViola Intonada - Oct 21, 2004 8:25 pm (#1830 of 2977) Reply\n\nReading all of the posts the last few days has really brought back the memories of the days of big hair and ripped jeans. The amount of hair spray and the hours I spent achieving my big hair. Ugh. I was a freshman in college when I saw my first concert. It was Chicago, others that I attended while in college were Genesis, Heart, Bangles, John Cougar (yes, afraid so) Mellencamp, AC/DC and The Who. The last concert I attended was The Pink Floyd. Since then I have only been to orchestra concerts. I am tempted to take my daughters to a Phil Collins concert, but probably won't.\n\nThere is a video on MTV now that just cracks me up about 1985.\n\nBetty, I hope you feel better soon.\n\nI think I will pass on the Pig Butt on a stick. Fried candy bars? Really? I had never heard of fried candy bars. I haven't been to a State Fair in 15 years. Maybe I will just have to go again someday.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nThe giant squid - Oct 21, 2004 8:46 pm (#1831 of 2977) Reply\n\nViola, I dig that song and video \"1985\" too. That, and you've got to love a band called \"Bowling For Soup\"...\n\nJack, for having seen the Ramones & Blondie live at CBGB you are officially cool.\n\nI've been to the Whiskey (a Go-Go), but not when it was cool... My wife, on the other hand, used to do band photography down on the Sunset Strip in the mid- to late-80's. She got to know bands like Warrant, Poison & Black N Blue--all the guys I was listening to at the time back in ND. Yes, my wife is cooler than me and I'm OK with that.\n\nJulia, next time you talk to Betty let her know her hugs are most definitely returned in kind.\n\nPig butt...\n\n--Mike\n\n_____________________________________\n\nOzymandias - Oct 22, 2004 12:35 am (#1832 of 2977) Reply\n\nOh, what a shame that I missed the 80's. I was at most 5 years old (I was born in '85), but I do remember being subjected to the side ponytail look by my cousins and their Evil Crimping Iron of Doom! Ooh, and bicycle shorts with big t-shirts tied off to the side. I was tragically too skinny to fill out the shorts.\n\nI am a child of the 90's and as such am profoundly disturbed by \"I Love the 90's.\" To see movies I saw in the theatre 5 years ago presented as nostalgia is just creepy.\n\nFried candy bars...sounds kind of scary, but in a good way. I haven't done the state fair thing in a while. I might have to make a trip...\n\nLet me be the first to say Happy Friday to all! Especially since Saturday will be unhappy for me, since I have to take an English exam. Stupid graduation requirements. Can't they tell I speak English goodly already enough now?\n\nFarewell, and may the forces of evil become confused on the way to your house. ~Erin\n\n_____________________________________\n\nVeronikaG - Oct 22, 2004 2:41 am (#1833 of 2977) Reply\n\nIt's kind of funny how close the 90's still seem. Ten years ago we already felt that the 80's were waaaaaaay back in the past.\n\nHaving Guinea pig for dinner, how unethical! My friends family bred rabbits for food. I always thought it was so sad going into their shed and seeing all the cute little bunnies about to become roast. *sniff* I had a rabbit myself for 6 years, so I can say for certain I'm never going to eat rabbit. Or Guinea pig.\n\nIt's Friday, meaning that I now look forwards to a couple of days of unplugging the intellectual parts of my brain. Cool.\n\nHmmm... Haven't been at st. Mungo's for a while...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Oct 22, 2004 4:46 am (#1834 of 2977) Reply\n\nHappy Friday! Yay, Friday!\n\nThis is a busy weekend for us, with lots of Halloween socializing to do.\n\nTomorrow afternoon the kids will attend a Halloween dress-up party, and the hosts, once dusk falls, hang up a huge white sheet and show movies in their backyard, which is always very cool. The mom who gives this party is one of the original, unashamed Slacker moms, and that makes going to her house so much fun. My friend and I are bringing our food \"contribution\"-a huge amount of Chik-fil-a chicken nuggets. No cooking, no clean-up--W00T! (Hmm, unless Shelter Girl could just pop by the State Fair and pick us up some Gator Kabobs or Pig Butt on a stick? )\n\nMust run to a boring meeting. I don't even have a \"real\" job, and yet I cannot escape boring meetings, alas earwax.\n\nHave a great weekend.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLeprechaun Jack! - Oct 22, 2004 5:18 am (#1835 of 2977) Reply\n\nThe giant squid :Jack, for having seen the Ramones & Blondie live at CBGB you are officially cool.\n\nI don't know about cool but I definitely feel old. I was watching TV last night and saw “I love the 70's.” They were spotlighting 1977 and showed the Ramones. I was lucky to be part of that scene at that time, I had a blast but now that I think back on it, it kinda' scary thinking of a 10-15 y/o kid in a mosh pit. I still live in fear that my mother will find out half the things I did as a kid.\n\nTim: I love your list, wanna' trade.\n\nDenise P: As for eating the Guinea pigs no matter how big they got I can't see eating them either. You would probably need a herd of them to feed your troop, not very cost effective.\n\nJulia: Please give lots of hugs and love to Betty for me. I've been going through a bad patch myself, I think it has to do with the change of the seasons and the upcoming holidays. But this too shall pass.\n\nJack\n\n_____________________________________\n\nseptentrion - Oct 22, 2004 6:07 am (#1836 of 2977) Reply\n\nHug Betty for me too, please Julia !\n\n_____________________________________\n\nJulia. - Oct 22, 2004 6:57 am (#1837 of 2977) Reply\n\nWill do guys!\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Oct 22, 2004 7:34 am (#1838 of 2977) Reply\n\nHappy Friday everyone!!!

I have a big maths exam next week, and I really must study. For some reason, I have this big problem when I study...\n\nI open the books...Fine...\n\nI might \"hit\" the books - literally\n\nI read a few paragraphs, then I start thinking...\"Hey, this is not so bad, I am doing quite well.\" Then it happens...\n\nI look up...Yes, I look around my room, and suddenly, computer games that I haven't played in years suddenly seems interesting, or magazines I have read before, sounds like a good substitute for notes.\n\nYes. It is a situation that I am not proud of - perhaps there is a club for people like me....

Or even worse my closet needed straitening and maybe even color coordinating my clothes in the closet. I would somehow justify not studying because the cleaning needed to be done. In other words anything to do other than study My home was very clean when Finals came around, and I got very little studying done.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nLoopy Lupin - Oct 22, 2004 12:02 pm (#1842 of 2977) Reply\n\nI look up...Yes, I look around my room, and suddenly, computer games that I haven't played in years suddenly seems interesting, or magazines I have read before, sounds like a good substitute for notes. -- Richard Reid\n\nThere has to be a name for this phenomenon. (Catherine?) I also seem to recall that the fates (karma or something) used to work against me as well. Has anyone ever seen the movie \"Murder by Death\"? It is a somewhat amusing spoof of murder mysteries. Anyway, I must have managed to see that movie on tv 100 times during law school because it would always come on as I sat down to study. I wouldn't give it a passing glance right now, but at that time, it suddenly became \"Must-See-TV.\"\n\nAnyway, Richard! Good to see you. How are the Italians?\n\n_____________________________________\n\nDJ Evans - Oct 22, 2004 12:10 pm (#1843 of 2977) Reply\n\nGuinea pigs for a meal? Hmmm, that's a little bit too -- well let's just say I \"don't\" think I would ever try them myself. Now I might/would invite a couple of guinea pigs to share my meal but I don't think I would like to have them for my meal!!! I'm sure if anyone is brave enough to try them, I can just hear it now \"They taste just like chicken!!!\" (For those wondering about the chicken comment, I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but Americans are known to compare nearly any meat they taste to the taste of a chicken.)\n\nYes, Julia please let Betty know that she is in our hearts & prayers. That we are thinking of her and miss her terribly. So glad to hear that when you talked to her she sounded better!!! Wish I knew how to do one of those online Get Well greeting cards like we did for when Kip was in the hospital a while back. Then we all could get on there and leave her a little message for her to see when she got out.\n\nWell, it's looking like it's going to be another rainy weekend here. I wouldn't mind it so much, but my sister & her husband are in the process of building their own house themselves. With all of the rain/storms that we've been getting for the last 2 or 3 weeks it's really putting them behind.\n\nJack -- Hope you will be feeling \"up\" again soon too. Don't like it when one of us in our forum family is feeling down or sick. Maybe this will cheer you and others some ----- Only ONE MONTH (& a few hours) from today and we'll have the DVD for PoA out on the shelves & in our hands to watch over & over!!!! Hey, so good to see the little leprechaun \"dancing\" again!!!\n\nRichard: - perhaps there is a club for people like me.... Procrastinators Anonymous perhaps?\n\nHmmmm, there is a club for procrastinators? I just might have to join that club, I think I would fit right in there!!! Yes, I will definitely have to give that some thought -- later on sometime that is.\n\nHope everyone has a great Friday, a great weekend -- well heck just a great everything. That everybody gets all of their studying done early so they can have some time to \"play\" later on. Priorities \"must\" be put in order here.\n\nLater, Deb\n\nP.S. Loopy -- \"Murder by Death\" oooooh I love that movie!!! I've seen it a gazillion times too, along with \"Clue\"!!! Both are classics for me. I also like those \"old\" Black/White murder mysteries. Like the Charlie Chan series, the Thin Man series, etc...\n\n_____________________________________\n\nRichard !!!Reid - Oct 22, 2004 12:24 pm (#1844 of 2977) Reply\n\nLoopy, I was fortunate enough to move out of that room, and into one - equally disgusting - with room mates my own age, and nationaliy - it just made communicating a lot easier (not great at sign language).\n\nNevertheless. I now know what my procrastination technique is this year...Harry Potter Forums. I really need to log off...I really need to log off - well...I seriously doubt that will happen.\n\n_____________________________________\n\nhaymoni - Oct 22, 2004 12:40 pm (#1845 of 2977) Reply\n\nI'm glad things are going better for you, Richard.

Thankfully brief!\n\nI once offered to buy Joey Ramone a drink at a bar on Avenue A and he looked at me like I had eight heads. I wasn't hitting on him, either. Maybe that was his problem! It makes me sad that 3 Ramones are now deceased.\n\nI've never seen Blondie perform, but I've seen Debbie Harry loads of times at different events--performing at Wigstock, shopping in SoHo, schmoozing at art gallery openings. She was also a guest on the RuPaul show once and I talked to her because my friend at the time was RuPaul's personal assistant. She wasn't a friendly person.\n\nThe first record I ever bought was a \"Copa Cabana\" '45 by Barry Manilow because we were dancing to it in my dance class and I wanted to practise! But the first proper album I ever purchased was Ghost in the Machine by The Police. It was a cassette tape and I recall the plastic cover breaking after about 3 days. My father took me to see Rick Springfield at Great Adventure with some friends when I was a young teen (pre-teen maybe). But the first concert I ever went to was actually a very small show. Black Flag to an audience of about 50 people. And I'd won the tickets no less! The biggest show I've ever seen (as in largest venue and number of people) was The Cure, Pixies and Love and Rockets at Giant's Stadium.\n\nDuran Duran performed at the Virgin MegaStore in Times Square last week and I was a little sad to miss it because I was a huge fan of their's in the early to mid-eighties.\n\nNYC is such a great place because we get to see so many people and host so many interesting events. I see famous people all the time. But quite possibly nothing will ever top when I met Alan Rickman in November of last year... :swoon:\n\n_____________________________________\n\nCatherine - Oct 22, 2004 5:53 pm (#1848 of 2977) Reply\n\nCalling Richard and all Procrastinators:\n\nLoopy's faith that I would have a \"name\" for the dreaded disease will, so unfortunately, prove unsatisfactory.
