A MATTER OF of Upjohn : THROWING The Investment Bankers Association's sound is shares , Co. for selling .• STONES argument against \"industrial aid bonds\" in danger of being used against itself. This would not, however, lessen in any the correctness of the argument leveled against unfair competition resulting the abuse of the tax-exemption privilege reserved to state-local government activities failling outside the purview of private enterprise and the Federal Government. •' /-v.■' '.y way from , corporate issues still pending as of last July 27 numbered a record high of 527. The comparable figure last year (July 29, 1961) was 318. The lowest figure in the past 12 months was 300 (Dec. 15, 1960). This seems somewhat incon¬ for leading the fight against the extension of the tax-exemption savings, to activities of a private character and at the expense of competing private enterprise not privy to the financing-savings. Unfortunately, the LB.A.'s stand is tainted by its inconsistent application of this worthy principal. gruous in view of the marked decline in the four-week float compared to last week's The very computation and the downward leveling-off of the total formal backlog. vis The SEC registered A lean selection of corporate bonds is in prospect and amounts to but $80.7 million period Aug. 7-31. The total backlog of bonds, with and without dates, likely to be publicly offered has dropped from last week's estimates of $397 million to for the $283 million in a week's time. The tables below should depict the the financing wind blows way as of this writing. TOTAL FORMAL BACKLOG This Week Corporate bonds with dates Corporate bonds without dates.

But, the I.B.A. should take a stand against the extension of financing savings costs to rails' competing common carriers. Investment bankers know, also, too well the uphill fight of the private power companies against gov¬ ernment and REA public power. Savings due to the tax-exemption privilege should be denied to all private activities no matter how disguised. $333,653,490(133) 560,316,950(276) $940,138,300(449) Total municipals with $893,970,440(409) 1^...*$1,223,296,000(500) Total corporates $1,290,667,340(467) date\\____ $608,697,000 (73) LARGER * (70) in parentheses denote number of issues.
