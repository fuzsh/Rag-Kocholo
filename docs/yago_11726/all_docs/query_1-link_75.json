        "text": "Comparison of the good, the bad, and the ugly of Korean Comedies\n\nComedy is an art form. What one person finds funny another might find boring or sickened. For example, my husband likes Sasha Baron Cohen films. I do not. I find them repulsive. However, we can both agree that we find Grandma’s Boy very funny.\n\nA great comedy movie has the same requirements that make any movie great: a good story, script, character and actors. However, you also need timing and things to which you can relate. In the end , despite any outlandish behavior, there are human qualities that make it easier to identify with the movie and it’s characters.\n\nMy Sassy Girlfriend (2000)\n\nMy Sassy Girlfriend is about a headstrong girl who is suffering the loss of her beloved boyfriend. It’s the anniversary of his death, and she’s gone and gotten drunk. In steps Gyeon Woo (Chae Tae Hyun) to save the day. However, his initial act of kindness leads him into further unfortunate and funny circumstances like going to jail twice and being threatened at gun point by a deserter. My Sassy Girlfriend is a different kind of romantic comedy. It takes two people who need to grow, places them in awkward yet plausible situations.\n\nCrazy First Love (2003)\n\nSon Tae-il and Yu Il-mae grew up together. While Yu Il-mae is a serious and dedicated student, Son Tae-il is a deliquent. Despite an incredible IQ of 148, Tae-il is only interested in claiming Il-mae as his own and marrying her. The movie revolves around Son Tae-il’s efforts to land Yu Il-mae’s hand while Yu Il-mae’s father, a teacher at Son Tae-il’s school, tries to keep him on the right path toward college. Il-mae’s father comes up with various scenarios to keep Son Tae-il advancing in life until he thinks the pair belong together (Alternative thought: Sometimes I really think the father wants to be with Tae-il, however, I have heard that while male and female PDA is not seen a lot, you will see a lot of PDA (as in friendships, bonds, etc.) between friends of the same sex).\n\nBattle of the Comedies\n\nChae Tae Hyun stars in both romantic comedies. However, despite his expressive body language and voice and decent acting talent, it isn’t enough to salvage Crazy First Love. My Sassy Girlfriend is the best thing I have seen him in so far. His expressions and body gags are not over-the-top in My Sassy Girlfriend. Conversely, in Crazy First Love, he acts too extreme. I think it is honestly to cover up how thin of a plot this movie has. Usually, in a Korean Comedy there is one loud-mouth character, who makes a lot of noise but is usually somewhat likeable. Chae Tae Hyun plays Son Tae-il and Son Tae-il is as much of a loud mouth as he is a whiner. He spends most of the movie whining. The movie takes so long to resolve the connection between Son Tae-il and Yu Il-mae that when they do get together, you just don’t really care that much. You are breathing a sigh of a relief that is over.\n\nMy Sassy Girlfriend is a cute and silly romantic comedy that never seems to lose its edge. Chae Tae Hyun and Jeon Hyun’s acting and characters are grounded in everyday Korean life and pop culture unlike the over exaggerated and flamboyant characters of My Crazy First Love. My Sassy Girlfriend humor hits its mark and it doesn’t try to throw in stupid sex jokes or stupid humor as seen in My Crazy First Love (i.e. excessive whining, ddong chim (poop needle), male-on-male crotch grabbing, etc.).\n\nMy Sassy Girlfriend has a solid story and good pacing. My Crazy First Love suffers with it’s pacing and there is a disjointed. My Sassy Girlfriend is a lengthy film but if offers up different sequences, pacing, character progression, etc. My Crazy First Love is full of excessive crying and whining by characters, has hackneyed pacing, a lack of significant character progression, and is toooo long.\n\nThe only interesting thing about My Crazy First Love is Chae Tae Hyun’s characters bond with his teacher, the father of Yu Il-mae. However, this hampered by the contrived marriage plot and the worse offender, the thrown-in and somewhat random terminal illness. The film is off the rails and is quite crazy itself.\n\nBetween the two films, My Sassy Girlfriend is the way to do comedy. It’s funny and sweet-yet-not-overbearing and has a nice love twist.\n\nGrades\n\nCrazy First Love ** 1/2 out of 5 Stars\n\nMy Sassy Girlfriend **** 1/2 out of 5 Stars\n\nBichunmoo\n\nRelease Date: 2000 July 1\n\nInternational Release Title: Out Live\n\nGenre: Drama, Romance, Action\n\nDirected & Written by Kim Young-jun [Shadowless Sword, Last Present]\n\nPrincipal Cast\n\nSynopsis\n\nSet in the past when Asia was under Mongolian rule, childhood sweethearts and star-crossed lovers Jinha and Sullie (Kim Hee Sun) are separated but vow to reunite. Raised by his Uncle, orphan Jinha (Shin Hyun Jun). trains to inherit the Bichun martial arts. After Sullie’s departure, Jinha arrives home to discover his uncle is under attack. Assassins have arrived seeking to steal the Bichun martial arts. Unfortunately, his uncle is gravely injured. Before his death, his uncle reveals that his parents were murdered by Sullie’s father, General Taruga, during the racial conflicts of the Mongolians, The Hans, and the Koryo (ancient Korean migrants). Meanwhile Sullie’s father, a Mongol general, arranges for her to marry a Mongol noble named Namgung Jun-kwang (Jeong Jin-yeong). However, when Jin-ha tries to stop Sullie’s impending nuptials, he is apparently murdered by Taruga’s archers. Believing Jin-ha to be dead, Sullie marries the Namgung Jun-kwang and has a son. Recovering from near-death, Jin-ha takes on the persona of bandit Jahalang, and begins an anti-Mongol crusade with the help of his army of warriors. Finally Jin-ha and Sullie are re-united, when Jin-ha’s bandit warriors infiltrate Sullie’s family manor. Their reunion is not a happy one for both their lives have changed, and they have new priorities. However, despite the initial bitterness, both love each other and they suffer through trial and tribulation to hold one another again, but it was never meant to last.\n\nRomeo & Juliet\n\nAlthough not identical, the story of Bichunmoo shares similarities with Romeo & Juliet. How?\n\nTwo ill-fated Lovers\n\nOpposing Families\n\nLove & Hate between Yu Jin-ha and Sullie\n\n“Youth in this play is a separate nation,” wrote Frank Kermode about “Romeo and Juliet.” Jin-ha and Sullie’s youthful and passion conflicts with the values of their feuding families and nation.\n\nTransience. While the events in Bichunmoo are not as swift as Romeo and Juliet, the movie still shows that Jin-ha and Sullie’s love gains its power from the movie’s “constant reminders that life, love and beauty are ultimately fleeting.”\n\nThemes\n\nThere are many themes that appear in Bichunmoo. I have mentioned a few above to draw comparison but here’s a list of other themes that can be found in Bichunmoo:\n\nFilial Piety\n\nLoyalty\n\nRevenge\n\nFate and Free Will\n\nFoolishness and Folly\n\nRepentance\n\nDuty and Honor\n\nColors in Costuming\n\nI would like to think that the choices in colors of garments had some symbolic reference in the film. Before Jin-ha and Sullie are separated, we see him in blue and her in peach/pink/coral. Blue is symbolic of immortality – perhaps the immortal naivete of youth, self cultivation, peace and peach/pink/coral is symbolic of desire, love, and trust. Before Jin-ha’s apparent death, we see Jin-ha and Sullie together dressed in white – foreshadowing of their fate?\n\nWhen Jin-ha becomes Jahalang he dresses in a deep burgundy representing summoning or a rebirth. Red in Eastern culture is a color of prosperity. Perhaps, the prosperity is Jin-ha’s second chance to make peace and come together with Sullie. Meanwhile, we see Sullie wear greens and reds before eventually reverting to white, which is representative of death.\n\nBoromir Would Have Been Proud\n\nI think one of the moments that I found impressive was a scene that reminded me of Boromir’s repentance/redemption. After being poisoned and tortured for the Bichun martial arts secrets, Jin-ha is partially cured by the very person who poisoned him. However, in the course of traveling to rescue Sung, his son, and friends, he is met with a team of bandits sent to kill him. Namgung, the husband of Sullie, joins the fray and saves the ailing Jin-ha. Previously, Namgung dishonored himself by giving into his desires and foresaking his honor. He watched as Taruga’s men shot arrows into Jin-ha’s body. This time Namgung takes the arrows meant for Jin-ha. Namgung wears a coat with am emblem on back. The arrows pierce and blood runs from the eyes of the emblem. It’s an epic death scene.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThere are some reviewers that have been exceptionally harsh on this film. The film’s plot is not difficult to follow. The acting by the principal cast is done with care and appropriate emotion. There were a few supporting actors that were a little ham-fisted, but I think overall the actors captured their characters well. The scenery is appropriate. The costuming does out do the scenery. In fact, the wardrobe department should be applauded. The action is fast enough to keep you involved in and interested. The movie does not get weighed down by the sentimentality of the love between Jin-ha and Sullie. Eventually they do make it back to each others arms, but it is bittersweet. It’s not a perfect film because I wish the director had not rushed through some of the development of the characters. I think a strength of the bond between Jin-ha and Sullie could have deserved more attention. Also, I would have liked to have seen more of the progression of character within Namgung. It also suffers from predictability.\n\nIt’s a decent first film to get acquainted with the Korean POV on fantasy swordplay. Also, Despite it’s imperfections, I recommend that you check out this movie because if you are Tsui Hark fan, you will get a kick out of the similarity and martial arts styles.\n\nFinal Grade: *** 1/2 out of 5 Stars\n\nSPECIAL NOTE: This was my first Korean movie. It was a great introduction to Korean Cinema for me.\n\nI got to thinking about Harry Morgan’s passing, and I came to remember where I first heard his voice. Strange enough, but I knew his voice before his physical appearance. When I was a kid (and some would question if I wasn’t still a kid) I use to be obsessed with a Rankin/Bass animated movie called “The Flight of Dragons.” It had a hero, dragons, wizards, a handsome knight, a beautiful ranger, an elf, etc. It was the makings of a D&D game. There was even a board game involved (as a kid I bought a lot of D & D choose your own adventure novels at yard sales with my grandmother).\n\nThe Flight of Dragons was a 1982 animated movie produced by Jules Bass and Arthur Rankin, Jr. (creators of the classic holiday cartoons Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer and Frosty, The Snowman) which loosely combined “The Flight of Dragons” by Peter Dickinson (1979) with the novel “The Dragon and the George” by Gordon R. Dickson (1976). The film focuses upon a quest undertaken to stop an evil wizard who plans to rule the world by dark magic. A major theme within the story is the question of whether science and magic can co-exist. This is told mostly through the experience of character Peter Dickinson, drawn from the 20th Century into the magical realm.\n\nThe Flight of Dragons aired as an ABC ‘Movie of the Week’ in 1986.\n\nThe Flight of Dragons Intro\n\nThe animated movie features an excellent voice cast – Harry Morgan, John Ritter, James Earl Jones (voice of Darth Vader), Don Messick (voice of Scooby Doo, Papa Smurf), Bob McFadden (voice of Thundercats’s Snarf), Victor Buono (Count Manzeppi in The Wild Wild West, King Tut in Batman), and James Gregory (Lt. Gen. Robert ‘Iron Guts’ Kelly on M*A*S*H, Dr. Tristan Adams in “Dagger of the Mind” on the OG Star Trek series).\n\nWhy is The Flight of Dragons worth watching? Why was it special to me?\n\nAs a child, I wasn’t exposed to many books. I grew up in a rural part of Virginia. We just didn’t have much. My grandmother had a few books – mostly Stephen King and romance novels. At school, I got a few books through the Scholastic program – when my poor mother could afford to buy me something. Our library was rather pathetic. Though I did get to read some Judy Blume, Beverly Cleary, and few other’s works. The first book with many pages I read was Bram Stoker’s “Dracula”. I was 5. Not that a lot of the themes stood out for me, I just enjoyed as a scary adventure, which would immediately result in my seeking shelter behind my grandmother’s back and under the covers that night. I was terrified of the pitch black nights in the country. It’s an eeriness you just can’t find in the city. Sorry, I am really deviating from my intended answer to the proposed questions.\n\nSo, with a limited selection of books, I had my imagination and television. I didn’t have cable television. I had only regular channels and good old UHF. Also, I grew up most of my childhood without a color television and the TV we had was 13″. Also, did I mention – we didn’t have a telephone. TV was my buddy. Through it, I got see more about life, and I came to understand more about my world. I watched the news with my grandmother. I watched television shows like Dallas, Falcon Crest, Hunter, etc. However, I coveted Saturday morning cartoons and Sunday movies.\n\nMy cousin exposed me to The Flight of Dragons. When I would visit, I demanded to watch the movie along with Dune. Over at my aunt’s, she had a disc player that used a cartridge. It wasn’t a laser disc. I was obsessed with watching Harry Harryhausen’s Clash of the Titans, Barbarella, Vincent Price’s House of Wax, and Sinbad. Sometimes I would also watch Jason and the Argonauts.\n\nHowever, what I loved to watch the most was The Flight of Dragons. But, why?\n\nIt wasn’t a sugar-coated animated film. It was dark and fantastical with intelligent and mature themes spread throughout. I am sure some children were confused by the themes but it is an animated film that was still stimulating for both children and adults.\n\nThemes\n\nChildhood vs. Adulthood\n\nGood vs. Evil\n\nLogic vs. Emotion\n\nRealty (i.e Science) vs. Fantasy (i.e. Magic)\n\nQuotes/Dialogue\n\nFor as evil is a part of all things, evil is a part of magic.\n\n-Carolinus (Harry Morgan)\n\nBlade with whom I have lived, blade with whom I now die, serve right and justice one last time, seek one last heart of evil, still one last life of pain, cut well old friend, and then farewell.\n\n-Sir Orin Neville Smythe\n\nSounds almost like Inigo Montoya From Princess Bride.\n\nThere was time between the waning age of enchantment and the dawning age of logic when dragons flew the skies, free and unencumbered. Look down there Gorbash, my friend. On the top of the earth below us, confusion and chaos reign. All mankind is facing an epic choice: a world of magic or a world of science. Which will it be? -Carolinus (Harry Morgan)\n\nThe story is not full of the typical over the top action found in many fantasy films. It is a believable tale that could have very easily turned into a rip off Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings, but it has a story that can stand on it’s own. It’s rather an minor homage to Tolkien.\n\nThe animation style was created by Japanese animators. Its quirky and shared some similarities to other works of Japanese Animation such as Star Blazers and Voltron. However, it was a hodge podge of style that made it on its own and was not a true copy of another animation film. The animation was lead by Toru Hara, who had worked on Miyazaki’s Nausicaa and would work in the future as producer on other Studio Ghibli films – My Neighbor Totoro and Graveyard of the Fireflies.\n\nDespite having a few flaws like cliches and an epic story with a less than epic ending (i.e. it definitely wasn’t like Gandalf fighting the Balrog whilst falling down a deep chasm), this story even with it’s dark, thoughtfulness had charm, humor, warmth, and it didn’t sugar coat the ending. The ending chafes. I say this because we see the separation of the mystical from the logical, scientific. This is a bit saddening because everything we do in life should have a little magic in it. However, I think when people examine the ending, they might narrowly interpret the separation. I will let you be the judge.\n\nIt’s a great film that can appeal to children and adults. Some adults, who just aren’t tapped into magic *wink*, might have a hard time with the cliches and the ending. Finally, I think children will still be pleased despite the lack of 90MPH pacing and CGI.\n\nThe Korean Wave\n\nHave you ever heard of the Korean Wave? It is also called Korean Fever, KDrama Fever, or the Hallyu Wave.\n\nThe Hallyu Wave \"term coined a few years ago by Beijing journalists startled by the growing popularity of South Koreans and South Korean goods in China. Now, the craze for all things Korean has spread across Asia, driving regional sales of everything from cars to Kimchi.\"\n\nIn recent years, the Hallyu wave has spread around the globe from Japan to the US to Britain to Iran of the Middle East. \"According to Michael D. Shin, professor of Modern Korean Literature and History at Cornell University, Hallyu is overwhelmingly driven by Korean TV dramas. The export earnings of Korean TV dramas far surpass those of Korean music and film.\"\n\nDrama Fever is evident by the incredible popularity Korean celebrities have experienced away from home. From Bae Yong Joon (Winter Sonata, Untold Scandal) in Japan to the Korean Music Festival at the Hollywood Bowl in California, USA to Iran's embrace of a \"A Jewel in the Palace,\" starring talented Lee Young Ae and the handsome Ji Jin-hee.\n\nEvery year, Korean Dramas have grown stronger in popularity. Korean Dramas have been subtitled by fans for years, but they now have dedicated Internet channels, one of which is called Drama Fever that not only shows Korean Dramas on their website but through Hulu, a major entertainment hub in the U.S. created by various entities (i.e. AOL, MSN, Facebook, and Yahoo!, etc.).\n\nWhy are Korean Dramas popular?\n\nKorean Dramas can be categorized in two ways: Modern or Historical. The first category involves conflicts such involving singletons, married couples, money, in-laws, and love triangles (a staple). Many heroines fall in love with the lead male, who may have not treated her very nice in the beginning instead of the one who always cares for her. These dramas have a modern setting and last anywhere from 16 episodes to over 100 (most often not exceeding 200). In contrast, most Japanese Dramas last for about 11 episodes. If they are popular, they might get a second season, a special, or movie.\n\nThe other category of Korean Drama is the historical dramas (Sa Geuk). They are dramatizations of Korean history. Korean historical dramas are usually lengthy and involve complex story lines with elaborate costumes, sets and special effects. You can expect to see many feats of athleticism and action, such as sword play, martial arts, horse riding, and fighting.\n\nKorean dramas, whether the historical or modern, have been recognized for excellent production quality, characters with depth, and intelligent writing. Avid watchers of dramas will notice familiar themes, types of characters, settings, and Korean cultural references (i.e. expressions, behavior, food, drink, etc.).\n\nUnlike the modern dramas, historical dramas are designed to reach a broad audience and thus, they will showcase a combination of human interest plot lines sprinkled with themes of family, romance, friendship, martial arts, political strategy, wars, etc. With a broad appeal, the shows attract fans of all ages and genders.\n\nBut, still, Why are Korean Dramas popular?\n\nSome believe it is the quality of acting, the script, no ... the production. Others believe that women have fallen in love with the celluloid Korean man. Back in 2006, Anthony Faiola, of The Washington Post, painted a picture that Asian women were hot for Korean men, or at least, the Korean man they saw in dramas. Faiola claims that \"the number of foreign tourists traveling to South Korea leapt from 2.8 million in 2003 to 3.7 million in 2004. The bulk of the growth, South Korean tourism officials say, stemmed from Korean Wave-loving Asian women.\"\n\nAs an avid Internet traveler and participant in the World Wide Web, I have seen since 2003 - the explosion of Asian male celebrity fandom. Kdramas are popular with teens as well as mature women in their 20s, 30s and beyond. Since many stars in Kdramas debut eventually on the silver screen and some participate in musical activities, women around the world have had an increasing interest in films and Korean Pop Music. This is not to say there are no male fans of Kdramas, but I suspect more males watch the historical dramas and films versus the modern dramas. However, we are still waiting on some statistics to back that assumption up.\n\nAlso, I don't want be dismissive of the talented and beautiful Korean women represented in Korean Entertainment. They have as much to offer everyone as the men. Some of my favorite Korean actresses happen to be Kim Sun Ah, Lee Ji Ah, Kim Ha Neul, Bae Doo Na, Ha Ji Won, Yoon Eun Hye, Park Shin Ae, Moon Geun Young, and Koo Hye Sun.\n\nWhere there are celebrities, there are fans. With the Internet, fans are more vocal these days and word-of-mouth travels fast. Since dramas, films, and music are accessible, they are gaining fans around the world as viewers and consumers (i.e. YesAsia.com, HanBooks.com, etc).\n\nHowever, the popularity of Korean Dramas I think is not a result of one thing but a combination of the influences that we have discussed along with the fact that Korean culture is accessible and it is new. The stories and themes present in Korean films, dramas, and pop aren't all that new. What is different is the culture that encapsulates them. We are all getting to know the Korean perspective, Korean ideals, Korean customs and traditions. This is exceptionally appealing.\n\nSide Note: I can't count how many times I have witnessed one of the characters of a drama make some form of Kimchi! Kimchi is Korean! I admit, I wish I was there to taste it. :)\n\nThe Final Answer\n\nOur desire to know one another better and to understand the familiarity that binds us is what I think truly drives the Korean Wave. Well, not to mention, how entertaining these programs, films, and music can be.\n\nI honestly don't think my words do as much justice as those of three quotes by Italian Director Federico Fellini's.\n\n“There is no end. There is no beginning. There is only the passion of life.”\n\n“A different language is a different vision of life.”\n\n“All art is autobiographical; the pearl is the oyster's autobiography”\n\n.....\n\nTo experience a Korean Drama, I recommend going over to Drama Fever. Also, to help you get started, I recommend the following assortment of dramas:\n\nFull House starring Rain (Bi) and Song Kye Hyo\n\nLovers in Paris starring Kim Jung Eun, Park Shin Young, and Lee Dong Gun\n\nBeethoven Virus starring Kim Myung Min, Lee Ji Ah, and Jang Guen Suk\n\nMy Lovely Samsoon starring Kim Sun Ah, Hyun Bin, and Jung Ryeo Won\n\nYou're Beautiful starring Park Shin Hye, Jang Geun Seuk, Lee Hong Ki, and Jung Yong Hwa\n\nJewel in the Palace starring Lee Young Ae and Ji Jin hee\n\nHave Fun!"
