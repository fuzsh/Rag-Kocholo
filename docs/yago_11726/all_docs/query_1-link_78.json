        "text": "In his book The Reading Life, C. S. Lewis shares his insights on the joys of reading books. At the end of the book, readers are asked several questions to help us reflect on our own reading lives. One of the questions is “Write down your earliest childhood memories of books that transported you and created in you a love of books. Have you re-read these titles lately? Were they still magical? How did these early experiences influence you?”\n\nIn this blog series, we wanted to share our early experiences with reading and our thoughts on a childhood book we have recently re-read—as stereotypical librarians are known to do.\n\nWhen I (Micah, Cataloging Associate) was growing up, summers were the time of year to run barefoot through the neighborhood, engaging in epic imagined adventures with my friends (which usually just turned out to be a lot of smacking each other with Nerf swords or plastic lightsabers). Summer was also when my mother would take my siblings and me to the public library every week to check out new books and participate in the summer reading program. My outdoor escapades and indoor literary encounters fueled my love of imagined worlds, both of my own creation and those of the authors.\n\nOne of my favorite series to read back then was Ranger’s Apprentice, a medieval, coming-of-age realistic fantasy about a young boy training to become—you guessed it—a Ranger of the kingdom of Araluen. I call it “realistic” fantasy because, unlike Harry Potter or The Lord of the Rings, there is very little magic involved and few fantastical creatures to be found. Instead, Ranger’s Apprentice focuses on building a world that loosely mirrors our own in the past and elevates those abilities real humans could feasibly attain…with a lot of practice and discipline.\n\nIn fact, it is that emphasis on discipline, as well as integrity, honesty, and friendship that caught my attention as I reread the first book in the series: The Ruins of Gorlan. When I was a kid, I was mostly interested in the mystique of the Ranger Corps; their camouflage cloaks and ranged weaponry had me wearing capes and building throwing knives out of Legos. Now, as I am eagerly anticipating the arrival of my firstborn son in less than a month, I find myself appreciating the focus on the cultivation of the virtue of the characters. I had forgotten that the young heroes were trained in character and conduct as much as they were in combat and stealth.\n\nMasculinity has become a loaded term in our society, with so many different voices saying what it is or isn’t and what it should or shouldn’t be (while Ranger’s Apprentice is certainly an enjoyable read for anyone who likes adventure, most of its central characters are male and will relate especially to boys and young men.) Ranger’s Apprentice advocates for a quiet, courageous, and humble masculinity. I remembered liking the series for the friendships that developed between the characters and the humorous banter that arose because of it, but re-reading the first book reminded me just how honorable those characters are or become. They are brave in the faces of danger and evil, learn how to forgive, practice humility, form deep bonds with each other, turn those bonds into a community focused on helping those who can’t help themselves, treat others with the respect they deserve, and are honest. The mentor figures practice these things and teach them to the young heroes, who take the lessons to heart and implement them. As I am about to be a father, these are all virtues I want to practice myself and teach to my son. I want to share these books, a love of reading, and the desire to run around outside with him, to cultivate his character along with his imagination.\n\nMan, what a good flashback! I might just reread the whole series. If you remember books you loved as a child or have reread some recently, feel free to let us know!\n\nThis review reflects Micah Rhodes’ own opinions and not necessarily those of the library or of Union University.\n\nAs librarians, we love books, and of course, think books shape and change us. But if we are being honest, movies do the same thing. So, today we are veering from our traditional book recommendations and reminiscing to bring you movies that have shaped us. Not just any movies, but those kids’ movies we remember so fondly watching over and over, as kids do. We also couldn’t pass up celebrating Stitch Day (June 26). For those Disney lovers, you will remember the movie Lilo and Stitch and know Stitch was also known as Experiment 626.\n\nJoin us in looking back at the children’s movies that have shaped or impacted us.\n\nI, Amber, Instruction Librarian, have so many favorite kids’ movies. I shamelessly admit kids’ movies are still one of my favorite genres. So, this was a tough pick for me. I would have to say Lion King or Monsters, Inc. Lion King came out the year my sister was born and was probably one of the first Disney movies I ever saw. The music and plot were fun, and I still enjoy this movie as an adult. Monsters, Inc. is one I saw in theaters while we were visiting family. My cousin and his friends took us to see it. Spoiler Alert: when Boo has to leave and they shred the door, I remember seeing both my cousin and his friends crying. These strong teenage boys were crying because they were so moved by this animated movie. I can’t say much more than that, other than I still enjoy watching this movie too and still hear, “We have a 2319!” whenever those numbers are used.\n\nStephen, Systems Librarian, remembers Aladdin. Here is what he told me: “I watched the Aladdin movie and listened to the soundtrack countless times as a child. I basically knew the movie verbatim, and still know most of the words of the songs. The love for this movie revealed itself when the live action version of the movie came out a few years back. While my daughter claims the newer version is the better version, I wholeheartedly disagree.”\n\nI would have to agree with Stephen. The animated version is my favorite.\n\nMelissa, Director for Library Services, remembers Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music. Here is what she said about them: “I would say that my favorite movies when I was a kid were The Sound of Music and Mary Poppins. The singing was gorgeous (except for the nuns’ singing, which I didn’t like), and I loved Maria von Trapp. I also really enjoyed Dick van Dyke’s dancing in Mary Poppins. As an adult now, I think I unconsciously try to make chores fun (“A Spoonful of Sugar”) and I seek to be innovative (like Maria using old curtains for clothing). However, I am NO DANCER.”\n\nI love The Sound of Music too. I remember watching the VHS tapes (there were at least two) in our portable TV on the way to Austria.\n\nJeannie, Technical Services Librarian, mentioned Bambi and Old Yeller. Here is what she said: “I would have to credit two Disney movies for being important to me: (1) Bambi and (2) Old Yeller. Disney is often accused of making syrupy, sweet movies that are totally unrealistic. Spoiler Alert: I felt somewhat traumatized when Bambi’s mother and Old Yeller are shot, and they don’t miraculously come back to life, as in some Disney movies. I learned that life is not always fair and sad events are a part of life.”\n\nI have to agree, Jeannie, seeing important characters in Disney movies die teaches a valuable lesson about life.\n\nRachel, Circulation Manager, mentioned Mulan and Cars. Here are her thoughts: “Mulan is one of the first movies I remember seeing at the movie theater. As someone who jumped out of my chair when the Huns “popped out of the snow like daisies,” as Mushu said, I learned early on that I was not meant to watch scary movies.\n\n“Cars is one that came out when I was a teen, and I remember enjoying it with my younger cousin, Ben. In more recent years, I’ve been able to share it with my nephew and see his love for it. There’s something special about passing the tradition of watching certain movies on to the next generation.”\n\nThat sounds like a good rule of thumb for scary movies.\n\nMicah, Cataloging Associate, noted How to Train Your Dragons was his favorite. Here is what he said: “My favorite children’s movie has to be How to Train Your Dragon and its sequels. I loved dragons as a kid (and still do!) and this movie was a big part of developing my gravitation toward the fantasy genre. As an adult, I especially appreciate the themes of reconciliation, supportive and wholesome romance, friendship across divides, and of course, the music.”\n\nWhat a great series, Micah. I love Toothless (probably because my family’s cat looked like him).\n\nSarah, Circulation Association and Administrative Secretary, loves princess movies. This is what she said: “I remember watching a lot of Disney classics growing up, which helped build a love for stories. The movies featuring princesses were (and still are) particular favorites. Some childhood memories that stick out are spinning around in a pink dress inspired by Aurora in Sleeping Beauty and belting all the words I knew to “Part of Your World” from The Litte Mermaid.”\n\nThe princess movies were some of my favorites too, although I’d have to say Belle and Mulan were my favorite.\n\nLibrary Staff reviews reflect their personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nOne of the titans of speculative fiction, the sci-fi genre encompasses a wide range of very different works. From the “hard” science fiction of The Martian and Jurassic Park, to the epic space operas of Dune and Ender’s Game, to the fantasy elements of A Wrinkle in Time, authors have gradually established science fiction as a broad “umbrella” literary field.\n\nThough sci-fi contains a plethora of styles, tones, and subjects, the common unifier of the field is the speculated effect of science, whether real or imagined, on individuals and/or societies. This speculation often delves into philosophical, psychological, or sociological territories; and like these sub-fields, certain sci-fi authors rise above their singular creations to become known for their whole body of work.\n\nThis list is certainly not conclusive, but it should give you, dear reader, a solid foundation from which to explore the genre as far as you wish.\n\nDune by Frank Herbert\n\nWith the recent releases of Denis Villeneuve’s two Dune movies, Frank Herbert’s original novel has surged back into the public consciousness. An explosive tour-de-force of everything the genre can be, Dune rightfully takes one of the top seats in the sci-fi pantheon. If you enjoyed the new movies, you will enjoy the book.\n\nAlso, do yourself a favor and read Dune: Messiah. While polarizing for fans, the sequel is a proper continuation of what Herbert was setting up in the first book.\n\nIsaac Asimov\n\nAsimov is one of those writers who is better known for their overall impact on the genre rather than any one specific work. Some of his highlights:\n\nI, Robot\n\nFoundation\n\nThe Complete Stories\n\nIsaac Asimov by Fiedler & Mele\n\nAndy Weir\n\nAn emerging author, Andy Weir is best known for his breakout hit The Martian and its subsequent film adaptation. He followed up with the less-than-well-received Artemis and the exceedingly excellent Project: Hail Mary. Weir’s novels have quickly become known for their wisecracking, sarcastic characters and accessible yet comprehensive presentation of real scientific concepts.\n\nEnder’s Game by Orson Scott Card\n\nA sci-fi classic about a boy-turned-hero by stopping an alien invasion, with social and philosophical twists.\n\nRemembrance of Earth’s Past trilogy by Cixin Liu\n\nA near-future Chinese sci-fi series, this trilogy portrays humanity’s first contact with an alien race and the resulting reactions to the knowledge that we are not alone. Includes The Three-Body Problem, The Dark Forest, and Death’s End.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nA science fantasy series for children and adults, detailing the efforts of the Murry family and their place in the cosmic struggle of good and evil.\n\nJurassic Park by Michael Crichton\n\nOne of those rare storytelling gems where the book and the movie are both of superb quality. Crichton is a master of realistic science fiction, and his skill shines brightest in his most popular work.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nI don’t have the space to list all the great literature of science fiction, but here are some more books and authors to check out!\n\n1984 by George Orwell\n\nFahrenheit 451 and other books by Ray Bradbury\n\n2001: A Space Odyssey and others by Arthur C. Clarke\n\nPhilip K. Dick\n\nH.G. Wells\n\nUrsula K. Le Guin\n\nMicah Rhodes’ reviews reflect his personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to another Monday Movie! Today, Darius and Micah are talking about the 1986 animated film When the Wind Blows. This feature is one of more than 35,000 available via Films on Demand. Watching When the Wind Blows was an interesting experience; check out our thoughts below!\n\nWhat do you think of the animation style(s) of this film?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: The animation style feels very normal, but somehow at the same time, slightly different than what I’m used to in 2D animation—even 2D animation of decades past—in a way that I don’t really have the vocabulary to describe. Suffice to say, this subtle, minute element of unconventionality helped contribute to the overall uncanniness of the film.\n\nThe movie also makes use of alternate animation styles for a few sequences over the course of the story. Some of these were strange and jarring, but overall, I thought they added to the story by providing insight into the inner lives of the two main characters. There’s also one sequence that’s done in a very minimal style that looks like a sketchbook, which was very evocative for its context.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: The animation style was quite archaic by today’s standards, and distracted me from time to time. There were several sequences when either real imagery or very realistic art was used, contrasting strongly against the more simplistic 2D animation of the characters. I’m unsure whether these were artistic choices or caused by animation constraints during production; regardless, they were quite jarring and did not enhance my understanding of the story or message.\n\nThe plot of this movie is pretty basic. Did it hold your attention? Why or why not?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The plot did hold my attention. The pacing of When the Wind Blows is really good: nothing much happens for quite some time, but somehow the viewer experiences a steadily growing sense of dread. (If you’ve seen The Clone Wars episode “Shattered,” you know what I’m talking about.) In fact, the very fact that almost nothing really happens during the movie’s runtime (with, of course, one major exception) seems to be the whole point. Hilda and Jim have nothing to do with the events unfolding around them.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Yes, it kept my attention for the whole movie. Though it was simple, the tension became more and more oppressive as you waited for the thing you knew had to happen.\n\nWhat did you think of the two main characters?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The two main characters, Jim and Hilda, are an elderly English couple, who have retired in the countryside. In another context the pair would be unbearably boring, but as I’ve alluded to above, the normalcy of the couple is clearly intentional. They are a charming pair, if flawed.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: The two characters were quaint and rather ignorant, or perhaps ill-informed. Their simple life contrasted severely with the events they went through, and they were clearly unprepared for the circumstances they found themselves in. I wanted to root for them, even though I knew there was nothing that could be done.\n\nWhat point(s) do you think the makers of When the Wind Blows are trying to make, if any?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Jim and Hilda are victims of a complicated geopolitical event / set of events that they clearly don’t even understand. It’s hard not to finish the movie without that fact weighing heavy on your mind.\n\nMaybe When the Wind Blows has an anti-war message. Or maybe it’s that ordinary people are disregarded and trampled upon by the opaquely massive machinations of the various opposing forces that operate in this world. Or maybe that ugly feeling of pointless tragedy is the whole message by itself.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: The points I remember most clearly:\n\n– A government does not necessarily know for certain how best to equip its citizens to endure a crisis, and if it is not transparent about this, could end up recommending nothing helpful or even causing harm.\n\n– It takes a long time for people to let go of past hurts or prejudices. Jim keeps calling the enemy the Germans and then has to correct himself to call them the Russians, getting confused by World War II.\n\n– Nuclear war is bad! Don’t do it! Innocent people will be hurt and killed.\n\nWould you recommend watching When the Wind Blows?\n\nDarius Mullin said: I think so. The overall effect of the movie is pretty unnerving. Nonetheless, it’s a very unique film and an absolutely fascinating look into the mood of the time when it was made.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Yes. It’s not long, but provides a sobering perspective on nuclear warfare and is a clear product of Cold War concerns. It was a particularly interesting watch for me after seeing Oppenheimer this summer and the BBC Chernobyl show this fall.\n\nYou can find When the Wind Blows via Films on Demand.

We’ve had a great field of competitors so far, but it won’t be complete until we feature our Science Fiction and Fairy Tale Retelling genre selections. Micah and Amber will serve as our commentators for this final round. Micah is up first. Micah, since this is your first week with us, will you introduce yourself, tell us some about the sci-fi genre, and your classic pick?\n\nMicah: Welcome back to March Book Madness, everyone! My name is Micah Rhodes, and I serve as the Cataloging Associate for the library. This means I take all the books we order or receive, put them in our digital catalog, and get them ready to go on the shelves. I’m also a huge fan of science fiction! This genre falls under the umbrella of speculative fiction, or imagined stories with elements that diverge from realism. Science fiction specifically imagines developments in science, technology, society, the environment, and other fields to create futuristic, fantastic, and sometimes eerily prophetic stories.\n\nMy classic pick for this genre is A Wrinkle in Time, the first book in Madeleine L’Engle’s Time Quintet. The story is about a group of children who travel through time and space to rescue their father from a dark, malevolent force. They are aided by many strange and alien creatures along the way and learn about the ongoing cosmic struggle between good and evil. The novel’s themes reflect L’Engle’s Christian convictions, and some elements are more in the realm of science fantasy than fiction. It’s an incredible journey, a Newbery winner, and a thoughtful book for youngsters.\n\nAnnouncer: Thank you for telling us more about this match-up. Can you tell us about your contemporary pick now and which of the two you think will win?\n\nMicah: My pick for contemporary juvenile science fiction is Found, the first book in The Missing series by Margaret Peterson Haddix. Like A Wrinkle in Time, this book and the rest of the series uses time travel as its core concept, but instead of leaving their own time to fight evil, the children in Found are from the past! Kidnapped by “time smugglers,” they must help each other correct events in the past to keep their present and future from collapsing.\n\nI’m pretty sure A Wrinkle in Time is going to beat Found. While an enjoyable, time-hopping romp, The Missing is narrowly appealing to the older elementary/middle-grade reader, whereas A Wrinkle in Time has deeper themes that adult readers will appreciate, too. I think A Wrinkle in Time also has a lot more staying power, as could be inferred by its various accolades and popularity since its publication in 1962. What can I say? It’s a classic for a reason! I could be proven wrong if our audience happens to include a sizeable Haddix fan base, though.\n\nAnnouncer: Thank you. I’m excited to see who advances to the Elite Eight. Now, it’s time for Amber to jump back in and tell us about our final genre: Fairy Tale Retelling. Amber, could you tell us about your genre and your classic pick?\n\nAmber: This classic pick brings back fond childhood memories. Fairy Tale Retellings are what you would expect: authors take those classic Grimm Brothers and Hans Christian Anderson fairy tales and add a twist. That twist could be adding humor, telling the story from a different perspective, or giving it a different ending. Today, we have one of each. My classic pick is The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs, a true childhood favorite of mine. This picture book is by Jon Scieszka. The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs is set in the courtroom as the Big Bad Wolf tells his side of the story. Obviously, the Wolf says he is innocent and only needed to borrow a cup of sugar. The jury is still out on that one.\n\nAnnouncer: Fascinating. I’ve always been a fan of fairy tales and like seeing the different versions. Can you tell us some about your contemporary selection, plus who you think will advance to the next round?\n\nAmber: My contemporary pick is The Little Mermaid by Jerry Pinkney. In this retelling, the little mermaid, Melody, trades her voice for legs and the chance to make a friend. This little mermaid doesn’t need a prince to save her.\n\nThis is a tough match-up. The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs is one people have been enjoying for over 25 years (well at least I have). It is funny and keeps the same story from a different perspective. On the other side, we have The Little Mermaid by a favorite author, Jerry Pinkney. The illustrations are beautiful, and Pinkney stays true to the tale while adding his own spin and giving Melody the strength to help her family. Pinkney takes the prince out, but the story is still sweet. I think The True Story of the 3 Little Pigs may win out because it has been around longer.\n\nAnnouncer: That’s it, folks. 8 genres and 16 books. Which one will prevail to reach the top of the shelf? Only time (and your votes) will tell. Our voting will take place via the library’s Instagram, but we’ll also have paper brackets available in the library to fill out beginning February 22nd. Brackets will be due Friday, March 8th before our students leave for Spring Break. The one with the most points will win a prize. Voting will start taking place on Monday, March 18th, and those advancing to the Elite Eight will be announced on Tuesday, March 19th. This pattern will continue until the Championship round the week of April 8th. We hope you will follow along, share, and vote to help us decide this year’s champion.\n\nWait, really? Read about music? Absolutely! Music is never created in a vacuum, but is written because of, in spite of, in response to, or in hope for human experiences. These books will help you learn about music, the people who make it, and how we can think about structured sound more deeply and creatively.\n\nResounding Truth by Jeremy Begbie\n\nDr. Begbie is one of today’s foremost thinkers considering the intersection of Christian theology and the arts, particularly in the realm of music. Resounding Truth is an excellent, approachable invitation to consider music not merely for “entertainment value,” but as a force that can shape our imagination, equipping us to creatively contemplate God and the truths of creation.\n\nA History of Emotion in Western Music by Michael Spitzer\n\nFrom contemporary pop to Gregorian chant, Spitzer uses philosophy and cognitive psychology to chronicle the broad spectrum of emotions evoked by Western music.\n\nShe Raised Her Voice by Jordannah Elizabeth\n\nGeared toward middle schoolers, but appropriate for all readers, this book collects miniature biographies of 50 of the most influential Black women in music history.\n\nThe Rest is Noise & Listen to This & Wagnerism by Alex Ross\n\nThis trifecta of books by music critic Alex Ross is essential for those interested in the impact of Western classical music on our contemporary musical landscape. The Rest is Noise is an illustrative walkthrough of the 20th century through its many musical movements, Listen to This provides a witty overview of musicalhistory through Ross’s writings for The New Yorker, and Wagnerism delves deep into the controversial musical legacy of Richard Wagner and a discovery of “how art acts in the world.”\n\nRural Rhythm by Tony Russell\n\nThis examination of 78rpm records from the 1920s and 30s catalogs the beginnings of country music and the small-town, personal stories that inspired the songs.\n\nSymphony for the City of the Dead by M. T. Anderson\n\nOne part spy thriller, one part war story, two parts music biography, and entirely engaging, Symphony for the City of the Dead uses the siege of Leningrad in WWII to tell the broader story of the life of Dmitri Shostakovich. Though his Seventh Symphony, written for his besieged city, was lauded in the Soviet Union and worldwide, Shostakovich’s sympathies did not always align with those of the Soviet Party.

This time around we’re talking about the 1980 animated film The Return of the King: A Story of the Hobbits, an adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien’s classic fantasy novel The Return of the King. Despite both being fans of Tolkien’s work since an early age, neither Darius nor Micah had ever seen this movie before. Dive into our thoughts below!\n\nThe animated Return of the King had a runtime of only 97 minutes, and many characters and events from Tolkien’s book were cut. What or whom did you miss the most?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: In a weird way, the fact that Return of the King was necessarily such a condensed version of the Lord of the Rings story made me miss the characters that were cut less. In the live action movies, whenever something was cut or altered it stood out and my instinct was instantly to question that decision. In the 97-minute animated film, I had to accept from the opening scene that this rendition would (of course) not have everything in it, allowing me to enjoy what was present more fully. So, for example, when I watched 2003’s Return of the King for the first time I was really disappointed when the scouring of the Shire was left out, but this time around I never considered its inclusion to be a possibility. To answer the question, though, one character I was hoping to see and didn’t was Faramir.\n\nOn a related note, I found it interesting whenever the 1980 Return of the King included details that were absent from Peter Jackson’s trilogy, such as the Two Watchers of Cirith Ungol.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: I missed Legolas and Gimli the most. Elrond was the only elf present in the movie, and dwarves were mentioned at the beginning but never appeared. I think the absence of the nobler fantasy races diminishes some of the fairytale whimsy The Lord of the Rings is known for. Additionally, since this movie was a direct sequel from The Hobbit animation, a lot of exposition was required at the beginning to set up the story and recount The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers. Many important events and characters were discarded in this summary, too, which had a twofold effect on my viewing experience. First, I think the introduction was too long and therefore pushed out other important details to the Return of the King narrative. Second, I suspect that watching The Hobbit and then The Return of the King with a 20-minute recap of what happened between the two would be confusing and unsatisfying for audiences, both for those who have read the books and those who have not. Finally, for being called The Return of the King, we actually didn’t see Aragorn, the king, very much.\n\nTolkien included songs and poems in The Lord of the Rings to give Middle-Earth languages a rich sense of history. What did you think of the music written for the animation?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The music itself didn’t particularly impress me one way or the other (with one exception: at one point the orcs sang a song that I found to be downright silly). I loved the overall decision to frame the whole narrative as the ballad of “Frodo of the Nine Fingers.” Within Tolkien’s world, telling a story through song is the most natural thing possible. Check out “The Adventures of Tom Bombadil” in The Tolkien Reader for some more songs from Middle Earth!\n\nMicah Rhodes said: I really liked that song was a big focus in this movie! It felt like reading the books in some ways, where Tolkien includes long lays that pause the narrative and linger in the love of language. However, the actual content and musicality of the songs left much to be desired. They were cheesy and shallow, and I wish that the film creators had either adapted songs from the books, or at least tried to mimic Tolkien’s poetic style.\n\nMiddle-Earth’s unique blend of whimsical fairy tale and epic mythology creates a recognizably ancient, deep, and authentic aesthetic. Do you think this aesthetic is well-communicated through the animated feature?\n\nDarius Mullin said: I do. A lot of late 20th-century 2D animation has a kind of bizarre quality to it, and I think this tone lends itself to the task of crafting fantastical landscapes. One of my favorite aspects of this adaptation was the character design, which perfectly straddles the familiar and the foreign. The hobbits, for example, look enough like humans as to be relatable, but also look different enough that they actually seemed like a different kind of creature (as opposed to just small men). I enjoyed seeing different takes on what some of the more unsettling denizens of Middle Earth might look like, such as the Nazgul Witch-King, the Mouth of Sauron, and Gollum.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: Mostly yes, and a little no. I’ll explain! The artistic direction for the backgrounds was spot-on. The hand-drawn landscapes were gorgeous and evocative, bringing to life an old and mythical world. I also noticed several interesting similarities to what we see later in Peter Jackson’s live-action movies. The city of Minas-Tirith was remarkably similar, with many tiers that gradually led to the royal buildings at the top, and a large rock formation jutted out from the middle of everything. A brief glimpse at the Gray Havens showed a swan ship that would be right at home in the books or Jackson’s movies, and Gondorian heraldry included wing-shaped designs on the helmets. Eowyn’s stand against the Witch-King was as heroic and courageous as I’ve ever seen it. It makes me want to go back and read Tolkien’s descriptions of these places, events, and objects, because these two very different adaptations included very similar aesthetics.\n\nMy “no” comes in some of the character designs, particularly the Witch-King. Since Sauron was an off-screen nemesis, the Witch-King of Angmar was the biggest villain we saw, and he looked and sounded like a Saturday morning cartoon villain (*cough* Skeletor! *cough​*). We don’t even see him fight Theoden at all! In my opinion, it was not a satisfying design for a millennia-old sorcerer king turned into a wraith and bent to the will of a dark lord by magic rings. But that’s just me.\n\nWhat advantages does this adaptation of Tolkien’s work hold over others you may have experienced?\n\nDarius Mullin said: My experience with Middle Earth adaptations (prior to this) is really just the live-action Lord of the Rings and Hobbit films. Building on my previous answer, I did quite enjoy the way the 1980 Return of the King felt even more like a whole different world, as opposed to a fantastical alternative version of medieval Europe.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: I think that it is a great way for children to begin to enter Middle-Earth when they may still be too young for the books or live-action movies. The animated Return of the King gets the basic plot of the end of The Lord of the Rings across, truncated though it may be. Hopefully, it draws kids into the beauty of Tolkien’s world and makes them want to read the books for themselves!\n\nYou can find The Return of the King in the Media Collection of the Union University Library.\n\nLibrary staff reviews reflect their personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nWelcome back to another Monday Movie! Today, Darius and Micah are talking about Goodfellas, the acclaimed 1990 movie directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, and Robert De Niro. The movie is a biographical film following the lives of Henry Hill, an American gangster, and his wife, Karen. The movie is based on Wiseguy by Nicholas Pileggi, a nonfiction book on the same subject published in 1985. Dive into our thoughts below!\n\nWhat do you think of the worldbuilding in Goodfellas?\n\nDarius Mullin, Evening Circulation Supervisor, said: I couldn’t help but compare Goodfellas to The Godfather as I watched. In The Godfather, the danger of the Corleones’ world lurks like a shadow even in the most benign scenes. In Goodfellas, the moral depravity of Henry Hill’s world is more subtle most of the movie (at least for the first half) but is readily apparent in certain explosive scenes. This is probably because the movie is told through Hill’s eyes, and Hill repeatedly mentions how “normal” everything felt for him.\n\nWhat do you make of the decision to include voiceover monologues as part of the storytelling?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Really interesting decision. It’s interesting to hear what the characters are thinking in situations where an audience would naturally want to know and otherwise wouldn’t. On the other hand, it introduces an unreliable narrator element to the story, as both narrators have a) hindsight, b) normalization, and c) other personal motives potentially skewing their recollection and interpretation of events.\n\nMicah Rhodes, Cataloging Associate, said: It was a smart choice, especially for a mobster movie and world. The core value of mobster society as presented in Goodfellas seems to be the tying of threads of individuals and nuclear families into the shared narrative tapestry of “The Family,” which makes its own rules to take care of its own people. A combination of where someone comes from, what they do, and who they know determines their place and importance in this narrative and Family. If someone doesn’t show the proper respect to one of those three areas, no matter how much they may respect the other two, they risk being cut out of that tapestry. So, the historical story of the mob Family is held as one of the most important parts of mobster life. Additionally, we see many moments where characters recount and reminisce about past crime jobs, lovers, fights, and other wild activities; indicating that personal storytelling is both a skill and a way to establish your place in the Family. It matters what stories someone has to tell and how they tell them. Thus, the voiceover monologues are internally consistent to how any Goodfellas mobster would recount their lives, as well as effective in communicating important details while showing related, and equally important, but different details that provide important characterization and context for the audience. Finally, the plot justification for the monologues is revealed by the end of the movie, which I think was unnecessary given all the utility I just described, but it was simply the cherry on top of a well-executed frame device.\n\nGoodfellas could be considered a “slice of life” movie focusing on a particular community. What do you think draws audiences to this world?\n\nDarius Mullin said: The crime world that is so normal to Henry Hill is equally alien to (most) viewers. True-to-life stories of human depravity like Goodfellas, The Godfather, or even Breaking Bad give viewers a window through which to observe “the life” without the danger of experiencing it. I remember when working on an article for the library’s March Book Madness I came across a literary critic who described the appeal of The Godfather novel being a sort of nonsexual voyeurism. I reckon he hit it on the head. Henry Hill frequently asserts how enchanted he was with “the life” and how great it was to experience such freedom in such a tight-knit community; movies like Goodfellas give an opportunity to peek in on these things without the danger of, you know, being murdered.\n\nOne last thought—both The Godfather and Goodfellas present the increased sale of illegal drugs as a marker delineating the beginning of a new, worse era of organized crime, and therefore the end of the previous era. I suspect that presenting the organized crime world as a bygone golden era allows audiences to somewhat suspend the instinct for ethical judgement.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: There are many reasons, so I’ll list just a few. One is that it’s simply a little thrilling to see life lived outside of legal and social rules; after all, that thrill is one of the chief reasons mobsters embrace that lifestyle. Another is that there’s always a spectacle when things go wrong. It’s never something mundane like missing bills or getting over the flu, but heists turning into stings or murders going too far. There might even be a bit of wistfulness in wondering what you would do with all that wealth, if you would make smarter decisions than the “wise guys,” if you could get out before you get too sucked in, or what it would be like to belong to a close-knit community. When everyday life is all about keeping away from the law and taking as much as you can get, “slice of life” tends to be intense.\n\nWhat character did you find most interesting?\n\nDarius Mullin said: Probably the protagonist, Henry Hill. At times he seems to be a decent guy, but then he does something awful. You want to root for him but know you shouldn’t.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: For me, it has to be the main character, Henry Hill. It’s never explicitly stated that he’s a diplomat, but he is always doing whatever he can to defuse tensions and act as the go-between for deals with competing personalities. He’s the “nice guy” who may not achieve the same notoriety as some of his peers but without whom many would tear each other apart—along with a good portion of the Family and its assets. You naturally want to root for him but must be conflicted while doing so, as it’s quite clear from his actions and family life that he is not a good guy.\n\nWithout spoiling it—what did you think of the ending?\n\nDarius Mullin said: One of the characters makes a decision at the end of the story that I found to be quite surprising. The revelation of who the protagonist was speaking to in all the monologues also surprised me. Needless to say, the movie did not end the way I expected. In a way I was pleasantly surprised that the movie did not conclude the way I thought it would; on the other hand, the ending felt out of character for the kind of story that was being told.\n\nMicah Rhodes said: It’s deliciously ironic. I think viewers generally walk away with a sense that things ended in a somewhat positive manner, but the film’s protagonist would not see it that way at all. Not many movies—or any stories for that matter—end with those two perceptions in such clear opposition. Goodfellas pulls it off quite well.\n\nYou can find Goodfellas in the Media Collection of the Union University Library.\n\nLibrary staff reviews reflect their personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university.\n\nSummers here at the Union University Library are certainly quieter than during the semester, but that doesn’t mean we stop working!

Mamie Till-Mobley is the mother of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old boy who was brutally murdered while visiting the South in 1955. His death became a rallying point for the civil rights movement, but few know that it was his mother who was the catalyst for bringing his name to the forefront of history. In Choosing Brave, Angela Joy and Janelle Washington offer a testament to the power of love, the bond of motherhood, and one woman’s unwavering advocacy for justice. It is a poised, moving work about a woman who refocused her unimaginable grief into action for the greater good. Mamie fearlessly refused to allow America to turn away from what happened to her only child. She turned pain into change that ensured her son’s life mattered. Timely, powerful, and beautifully told, this thorough and moving story has been masterfully crafted to be both comprehensive and suitable for younger readers.\n\n-Provided by the publisher.\n\nAgainst All Odds — ML 410 .T954 2016\n\nOur Evening Supervisor, Darius Mullin, has the following to say about Against All Odds: “Rapper, label founder, and motivational speaker Travis ‘Thi’sl’ Tyler tells his life story in this gripping autobiography. Thi’sl was a gang member and drug dealer before becoming a Christian, turning around, and running right back ‘into the fire’ to do inner-city ministry. Many might also be familiar with Thi’sl music and involvement with the 116 movement—if that’s the case, prepare to learn the incredible stories behind his music. Against All Odds is a powerful testimony weaving together tales of drug dealing, poverty, fatherlessness, gun violence, and God’s saving grace.”\n\nBeyond the Messy Truth — JK 275 .J66 2017\n\nVan Jones burst into the American consciousness during the 2016 presidential campaign with an unscripted, truth-telling style and an established history of bridge-building across party lines. His election night commentary became a viral sensation. A longtime progressive activist with deep roots in the conservative South, Jones has made it his mission to challenge voters and viewers to stand in one another’s shoes and disagree constructively. Now, in Beyond the Messy Truth, Jones offers a blueprint for transforming our collective anxiety into meaningful change. Tough on Donald Trump but showing respect and empathy for his supporters, Jones takes aim at the failures of both parties before and after Trump’s victory. He urges both sides to abandon the politics of accusation and focus on real solutions. Calling us to a deeper patriotism, he shows us how to get down to the vital business of solving, together, some of our toughest problems. “The entire national conversation today can be reduced to a simple statement—‘I’m right, and you’re wrong,’” Jones has said. But the truth is messier; both sides have flaws. Both parties have strayed from their highest principles and let down their core constituencies. Rejecting today’s political tribalism, Jones issues a stirring call for a new “bipartisanship from below.” Recognizing that tough challenges require the best wisdom from both liberals and conservatives, he points us toward practical answers to problems that affect us all regardless of region or ideology: rural and inner-city poverty, unemployment, addiction, unfair incarceration, and the devastating effects of the pollution-based economy on both coal country and our urban centers. In explaining how he arrived at his views, Jones shares behind-the-scenes memories from his decades spent marching and protesting on behalf of working people, inspiring stories of ordinary citizens who became champions of their communities, and little-known examples of cooperation that have risen from the fog of partisan conflict. In his quest for positive solutions, Van Jones encourages us to set fire to our old ways of thinking about politics and come together where the pain is greatest.\n\n-Provided by the publisher.\n\nLethal Tides — D 767 .M874 2022\n\nIn Lethal Tides, Catherine Musemeche weaves together science, biography, and military history in the compelling story of an unsung woman who had a dramatic effect on the U.S. Navy’s success against Japan in WWII, creating an intelligence-gathering juggernaut based on the new science of oceanography. When World War II began, the U.S. Navy was unprepared to enact its island-hopping strategy to reach Japan. Anticipating tides, planning for coral reefs, and preparing for enemy fire was new ground for them, and with lives at stake it was ground that had to be covered quickly. Mary Sears, a marine biologist, was the untapped talent they turned to, and she along with a team of quirky marine scientists were instrumental in turning the tide of the war in the United States’ favor. The Sears team analyzed ocean currents, made wave and tide predictions, identified zones of bioluminescence, mapped deep-water levels where submarines could hide and gathered information about the topography and surf conditions surrounding the Pacific islands and Japan. Sears was frequently called upon to make middle-of-the-night calculations for last-minute top-secret landing destinations and boldly predicted optimal landing times and locations for amphibious invasions. In supplying these crucial details, Sears and her team played a major role in averting catastrophes that plagued earlier amphibious landings, like the disastrous Tarawa, and cleared a path to Okinawa, the last major battle of World War II.\n\n-Provided by the publisher.\n\nPractice the Pause — BV 4813 .O25 2023\n\nThese days, many of us live in a state of overreactive fight-or-flight response and chronic stress. The demands of modern life pull us in all directions and can often put the meaningful connections in our lives at risk—connections to our deepest selves, to others, and even to God. But there is good news. New developments in brain science have recently proven that an intentional practice of pausing for a few minutes of meditation, prayer, or other contemplative practice actually rewires our brain in ways that make us calmer, less reactive, and better able to see the bigger picture.\n\n-Provided by the publisher.\n\nSharks in the Time of Saviors — Rec Reading PS 3623.A86733 S53 2020\n\nIn 1995 Kailua-Kona, Hawaii, on a rare family vacation, seven-year-old Nainoa Flores falls overboard a cruise ship into the Pacific Ocean. When a shiver of sharks appears in the water, everyone fears for the worst. But instead, Noa is gingerly delivered to his mother in the jaws of a shark, marking his story as the stuff of legends. Nainoa’s family, struggling amidst the collapse of the sugarcane industry, hails his rescue as a sign of favor from ancient Hawaiian gods—a belief that appears validated after he exhibits puzzling new abilities. But as time passes, this supposed divine favor begins to drive the family apart: Nainoa, working now as a paramedic on the streets of Portland, struggles to fathom the full measure of his expanding abilities; further north in Washington, his older brother Dean hurtles into the world of elite college athletics, obsessed with wealth and fame; while in California, risk-obsessed younger sister Kaui navigates an unforgiving academic workload in an attempt to forge her independence from the family’s legacy. When supernatural events revisit the Flores family in Hawai’i—this time with tragic consequences—they are all forced to reckon with the bonds of family, the meaning of heritage, and the cost of survival.\n\n-Provided by the publisher.\n\nUnder the Sky We Make — QC 903 .N54 2021\n\nA leading global sustainability scientist, Dr. Kimberly Nicholas knows the data about climate change, knows the catastrophes looming. Here she reveals how all the passionate sentiments she was taught to suppress as a scientist turned out to be the key tools to navigating a path out of the climate crisis. She makes a hopeful, clear-eyed and at times hilarious guide to effecting radical change in our society and culture—starting with our own lives.\n\n–Adapted from back cover.\n\nFollow the links in the blog to see library resources related to the topic.\n\nI come from a family that enjoys traveling quite a bit. When my siblings and I were younger, we would trace routes to the Wisconsin Dells in our family atlas and count the days, even months out, until we got to go back to our favorite waterpark resort. As we got older, our trips took on a more intellectual nature as my mother made sure to include museums and historical sites in our journeys around the country. All this research helped Mom realize that she loves to plan trips almost as much as experience them, and now regularly has destinations and itineraries (usually national parks) lined up a year or two in advance. I always looked forward to seeing what she has prepared, and still do! However, these days it’s ultimately up to my wife and I to plan our own trips, and this summer we decided to take a big one to Austria.\n\nAustria, not Australia! You’d be surprised how many people get that confused, to the point that you can buy all sorts of souvenirs that say, “No kangaroos in Austria.” Unlike the similar-sounding island continent down under, Austria is a landlocked country in Central Europe.\n\nAre you familiar with the musical film The Sound of Music? It’s set in Austria, and some of the filming was done in Salzburg, near the Alps. Even though it’s further north than Salzburg, the region around the capital city of Vienna is called lower Austria because there aren’t any mountains. We stayed in lower Austria with some friends from college; they were gracious hosts and gave us tours of Vienna and the surrounding countryside. Our first full day in the country was spent on a tour of the Weinviertel (“wine quarter”). The rolling hills and ripening vineyards weren’t the rugged majesty of the Alps, but I found them just as beautiful in their own way. I got to try Weiner schnitzel (which is very much not eaten with noodles, Fräulein Maria), and we even explored the ruins of the old Falkenstein castle.\n\nThe next few days we took trains into Vienna itself to visit museums, try new foods, and explore several historic churches and other locations. The gothic Stephansdom cathedral, one of the tallest churches in the world, was breathtakingly gorgeous and massive, a dominating feature of Vienna’s skyline. My wife and I particularly enjoyed the Hapsburg Imperial Armory exhibit at the Weltmuseum, which contained hall after hall of historic armor and weapons. The highlight of the trip for me, however, was the music.\n\nVienna is a city with one of the richest musical histories in the world. Many of the biggest names in Western art music lived, wrote, performed, and died here. Perhaps the pinnacle of this pride are the paragons of classical music known as the Viennese School: symphonic master Franz Joseph Haydn, compositional prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Romantic catalyst Ludwig van Beethoven. In an exhibit at the Weltmuseum my wife and I found pianos and other instruments played by these three composers and others like Gustav Mahler, Franz Liszt, Frederic Chopin, and Franz Schubert. Several statues of these figures dot the city. Finally, we had the opportunity to hear a concert by the Vienna Philharmonic, one the of the best orchestras in the world, in which they performed music by Mozart and Richard Strauss. Though we purchased tickets late and didn’t get to choose where exactly we’d sit, we somehow ended up in the middle of the balcony with a perfect view and perfect acoustics. I was in awe; I got to hear an historic ensemble perform historic music in a historic city. It’s a musical experience I’ll never forget.\n\nThe rest of our trip was mostly spent relaxing with our friends, playing board games, and visiting an Austrian church service. Flying back to the States proved to be grueling, with at least 4 hours spent standing in lines. Nevertheless, the trip was well worth it. I encourage you to visit Austria if you ever get the chance. The land is gorgeous, the food is amazing, and…forgive me, I can’t resist: I can report that the hills are indeed alive with the sound of music!\n\nMicah Rhodes’s reviews reflect his personal opinions and not necessarily those of the library or university."
