We all love Rudolph, but what about Bilbo? What about the unicorn? What about Carolinus, the green wizard? I am a personal fan of the animated films that were fantasy tales that warmed the heart and inspired the mind. I would really like to see more mention of them on this website. I would also like to know, is there a soundtrack for Flight of Dragons yet? I heard they were working on one. Please e-mail me, if you can.\n\nName: Richard Fenwick\n\nLocation: Richmond , VA USA\n\nDate: Sunday, March 12, 2000 at 00:38:16\n\nComments:\n\nThank you very much for responding to my questions, Mr Goldschmidt. I am glad that you took the time to respond. I will most likely contact your legal person with any other questions I might have in the future. To answer your \"question\" about my email address the reason why it's Jack Frost34 is because since my College My buddies gave me the nick name Jack Frost because one night when we were hunting I got lost in the woods and I was out there all night. Since it was in the middle of Winter they started calling me Jack Frost. It's a stupid little story, but perhaps it made some of the fans chuckle. Someone at Hotmail already had claimed the name \"Jack Frost\" so I tacked on the 34 because that was my age at the time I aquired that email address. Well, you have a great day.\n\nName: Rick Goldschmidt\n\nMERCHANDISE addition and response to LEGAL question\n\nDate: Saturday, March 11, 2000 at 23:17:56\n\nComments:\n\nA \"Fang\" Big Head resin model kit has been added to our MERCHANDISE page from MONSTER CELLAR. Joe at MONSTERCELLAR is also offering a resin plaque with all the MMP characters and a Big Head version of YETCH. We are not selling his kits directly or profiting from the sales BUT we have had many requests for direction on these great model kits. In response to the previous MAIL page message from Richard, the legal issues are very complicated and I can assure you that Arthur Rankin and Jules Bass are aware of the activities on this website. We have worked closely with WARNER BROTHERS (owners of the RANKIN/BASS specials after 1974) and GOLDEN BOOKS FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT (for whom I work as a consultant), who own everthing between 1960-1974 except the EMBASSY feature films and live-action films Produced by R/B. When we obtained the rights to use the photographic images prior to my book's release, we were instructed to use RANKIN/BASS PRODUCTIONS as the copyright by both WB and GOLDEN due to the fact that the creations of the characters are the sole property of RANKIN/BASS. If an image is changed, such as in the case of the video box art, then the copyright would read c.WARNER BROS. HOME VIDEO, etc.. In the case of MAD MONSTER PARTY, DELUXO purchased the video and liscensing rights for a certain period of years; They did not buy Television rights, which SONY does own and where they got the 35mm print from is a bit of a mystery. As far as sales from this website go, they are solely to maintain the website so that we can bring you many free advertisements for the companies involved and at the same time offer exclusive information that comes from the hub of the RANKIN/BASS world. In other words, we will not be on the FORTUNE 500 list anytime soon. By the way, that is a very peculiar e-mail address you have there. For more legal information, contact our legal representation at ZEELAWYER@aol.com. ENJOY!

Who really does own the rights to the Rankin/Bass stuff? I mean I know Warner Bros. releases the videos and such, but who acctually owns the rights to the characters themselves? You sell several things on your site that just deal with the characters, are you leagally allowed to do this? When you guys published that book a few years back how could you put \"Rankin/Bass Productions\" as the copyright for each picture, when they don't even own the films? How was Delux selling a video that sony owned the rights to? I mean how is that Possible? I was just curious about all of this. I hope that someone will enlighten me. Thanks.\n\nName: Rick Goldschmidt\n\nLocation: Chicago, IL U.S.A.\n\nDate: Friday, March 10, 2000 at 22:41:23\n\nComments:\n\nI am sorry to report that the DELUXO DVD version of MAD MONSTER PARTY will not be released. The official word is that there were too many legal hurdles to overcome. In fact, the VHS video production has ceased as well...get your copies while you can. Personally, this is disappointing news...especially after devoting much time in photographing my MAD MONSTER PARTY archives and taking part in the \"Making of\" special. I suspected that this project might have trouble getting off the ground after learning of the unattainable COLUMBIA/TRISTAR (SONY) print that AMC has been airing. In order for a sucessful DVD release, that print was a must. I have personally discovered the MMP theatrical trailer and a television promo that would be perfect for a collector's release.....maybe one day. I do want to commend Dave Witting for his devotion to the film and his very kind treatment of me. The world needs more Dave Wittings and Taylor Whites (CD Producer) so that Projects like MAD MONSTER PARTY are treated properly and not exploited just for the sake of making a buck. A great deal of care and preparation went into the Video and CD release of MAD MONSTER PARTY and it shows. Quoth the Raven...Nevermore.

I was just letting all of you other SWELL Rankin/Bass fFans know that Fox Family Channel is airing \"Here Comes Peter Cottontail\" SEVERAL times in April, as they did last year, in case you were unaware. I was also at CVS and I would like to add to Rick's update that CVS also has the goofy colored Peter Cottontail dolls that sing and dance (There are 2 different Versions). Also at CVS they had a Coloring Book Display and it showed not only a Peter Cottontail Plush on it (Which stands instead of sits, as the one from last year does.) But they also had Irontail, Col. Bunny, and Donna Bunny on the display (in plush form) No one at CVS knows anything about Peter Cottontail. I also wanted to inform Rick that my new buddy who sells Enesco Products asked his dealer about the Peter Cottontail Line and he was informed that they would NOT be released UNTIL Easter of 2001, which is also the 30th Anniversery. It's amazing that Rick was not informed of that first?!!! Well, keep an eye out at CVS for NEAT Peter Cottontail Stuff!!! And if you're ever in Erie PA (which is nearby for me) please stop by Boarders. They have a HUGE Rankin/Bass display going on to promote Rick's Book, as I know you are all aware. Stop on out and buy a copy for EVERY member of your family!!!!. Have a HAPPY Easter, and PLEASE join the Rankin/Bass Yahoo Club!!!!\n\nName: Rick Goldschmidt\n\nRESPONSE to Jason Baron's MAIL!\n\nLocation: Chicago, IL U.S.A.\n\nDate: Wednesday, March 8, 2000 at 23:19:52\n\nComments:\n\nTHANK YOU Jason! BORDERS BOOKS & MUSIC is one of my very favorite places to go. I did a Book signing tour for the BORDERS BOOK stores in the Illinois area during the Winter of 1997 and 1998 (pictures soon to come on the ABOUT US pages)! Erie, PENN is tops in my book! THANK YOU for your kind words and actions Jason! Warm Regards, Rick\n\nName: Rick Goldschmidt\n\nNEWS FROM THE MAGIC EASTER EGG!\n\nLocation: Palos Hills, IL U.S.A.\n\nDate: Tuesday, March 7, 2000 at 21:38:07\n\nComments:\n\nNow that we are entering the month of March....wanted to give you an update on some of the Easter things going on in the world of RANKIN/BASS! First of all, want to apologize for the lack of recent updates on the site. We were having some problems with our server that we have now cleared up. We started a Don Duga section in the SPOTLIGHT section and have many more things to add to it. I spoke with Don over the weekend and we are planning to sell some original MAD MONSTER PARTY paperweights that Don designed. Each piece of art will be an original and feature many of the many MAD MONSTER PARTY characters that Don storyboarded in the film. For Easter, we are offering a 8 1/2 x 11 color laser of the original poster art by Paul Coker of HERE COMES PETER COTTONTAIL signed by RANKIN/BASS Musical Conductor Maury Laws! This print (suitable for frameing) is in a limited edition of 50 and for SALE right now for the price of $15 + $3.20 for Priority Mail shipping! Perfect unique RANKIN/BASS item for the holiday! WARNER BROTHERS HOME VIDEO re-issued THE EASTER BUNNY IS COMIN' TO TOWN in a beautiful clam shell edition VHS...if they had on DVD! The video features a gorgous print of the special and will surely delight the entire family. GOLDEN BOOKS FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT has issued a variety of Children's books based on the RANKIN/BASS classic HERE COMES PETER COTTONTAIL. The line of books includes a coloring book, Two story books, a Paint book (with a small picture from the Special on the cover) and a deluxe boxed activity set. Unfortunately, the FOX FAMILY CHANNEL has a blurb on each cover claiming the special as their own and the artwork is only fair at best BUT my kids liked the books and yours will too! STUFFINS also issued a small bean bag (6\") version of PETER, which is exactly like the 14\" doll that came out at CVS DRUGSTORES last Easter. TARGET has a variation of the PETER doll that plays music and moves and they have a small bean bag as well BUT he lacks the RANKIN/BASS likeness. He is also clothed in a blue or purple outfit? I doubt the ENESCO figurine line will be issued this Easter. I have received no official word on the line and have heard of no reported sightings. For St. Patrick's Day, I recommend a viewing of THE LEPRECHAUN'S CHRISTMAS GOLD on WARNER BROS. HOME VIDEO. I recently spoke to our good friend Art Carney and his grandchildren recently enjoyed another viewing. Beautiful packaging on the VHS if you can find it...check with the WHOLE TOON CATALOG at 1-800-331-6197 or e-mail at sales@facets.org. Look for my article entitled THE RANKIN/BASS - MAD MAGAZINE CONNECTION (art by Jack Davis and Paul Coker, Jr.) in the next issue of ANIMATION BLAST magazine. I am also writing a PROFILE on our friend David Sheldon for the same issue. SCARY MONSTERS magazine will feature a cover story I wrote on MAD MONSTER PARTY VS. MAD, MAD, MAD MONSTERS in their Halloween, 2000 issue! Check TVPARTY.com for many other articles I have recently written including an upcoming article on GARFIELD GOOSE & FRIENDS. We recently discovered THE NBC Network 12-06-1964 print of RUDOLPH THE RED-NOSED REINDEER w/ commercials and hope to bring you exclusive info and photos from this RARE find! I want to wish everyone a HAPPY ST. PATRICK'S DAY! Look for a SPRING Change to the site very soon.

There was only one copy of it, which is unfortunate, so I chose your book as my staff selection for this month. During March, at the Erie, Pennsylvania Borders store, your book will be heavily stocked and prominently displayed.\n\nName: Barbara Bertolo\n\nEmail: Location: Oakville, Ontario Canada\n\nDate: Sunday, March 5, 2000 at 19:00:48\n\nComments:\n\nI love your website, it is incredible.

It's great. I grew up loving both Heat & Snow Miser. I would love to find products such as ties and figurines. I have twin boys and I can not wait to introduce them to the Miser brothers."
