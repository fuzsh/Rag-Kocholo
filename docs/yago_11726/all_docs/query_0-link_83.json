        "text": "In this modern western with a twist, Mercy Gunderson is on furlough from the Army and back home on the family ranch in South Dakota. Her father, the local sheriff, has just died and everyone is expecting Mercy to look after both his affairs and her irresponsible younger sister. Mercy’s already heavy load gets even more worrisome when her 15-year-old nephew Levi begins running with a gang of native kids called “The Warrior Society,” and reservation teens begin turning up dead.\n\nFrustrated when the handsome new sheriff doesn’t seem interested in the first killing, and a second killing strikes close to home, Mercy takes it upon herself to investigate. A prickly love-hate relationship develops when the sheriff resents her intrusion on his job. There’s a reason Mercy’s nickname is “No Mercy”—she’s tough. A hard drinker, a loner, and a bit psychotic, the hero of this dark, exciting series debut is a female who drives a fast sports car rather than rides a white horse, but she’s a wild west vigilante all the same.\n\nMercy is used to going after bad guys. In her Army job she’s a sniper trained to track and kill human prey. If she’s the one to find this local killer, she may just take him out on the spot. Author Lori Armstrong is already known for her mass market PI Julie Collins series, and she proves here with her first hardcover release that she’s just getting started."
