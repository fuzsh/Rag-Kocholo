        "text": "– No ‘The Hobbit’ spoilers\n\nI love dragons. They’re simply the most fascinating creatures in any mythology or fantasy story – capable of breathing fire and roaming the skies (among other things). Modern-day narratives seem to place these beings on the good side, and whilst still intriguing, I rather prefer the good-old evil and nasty creatures from European literature.\n\nNothing beats the wickedness of Fáfnir from the Volsunga Saga; nor the gold-hoarding dragon from Beowulf; not to mention Tolkien’s own array of scaly beasts; mainly from ‘The Silmarillion’ and ‘The Hobbit’.\n\nSo why this post?\n\nA couple of things come to mind as to the reason for this slightly complex, but highly fascinating (to me) discussion.\n\nI’ve just acquired (and seen) the Extended Edition to ‘An Unexpected Journey’ (to which I’ll be adding a review very soon) and noticed something particular about Smaug’s design.\n\nMy suspicions first arose when the second trailer of ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ was released in October, noticing that the last shot of Smaug throwing fire to the screen had no forelegs – unlike what we had clearly seen in the prologue to ‘An Unexpected Journey’.\n\nBut first let’s give a quick introduction to the technical terms in dragonology …\n\n[Spoilers note: I’ll be using a few images from ‘The Hobbit’ that may give a slight glimpse into the shape of the dragon. Most of these are close-ups or darkly lit illustrations – so do not fear to look!]\n\n– “Dragons” and “Wyverns”\n\nAt first glance, they look exactly the same. Even I, up to a couple of weeks ago, thought that the two creatures were basically the same – thinking that the two words were simply describing the same being.\n\nBut I was wrong, to my glad surprise.\n\nWyverns are (or were) described in Medieval literature as being these serpent-like creatures with wings, often having spiked tails and mainly used in heraldic emblems\n\nPretty similar, right? The catch?\n\nUnlike dragons, wyverns often have only two hind legs – using claws attached to their wings to make their way on ground.\n\nApart from a whole lot of differences currently not relevant to the scope of this article, you need only keep in mind that dragons have four legs in total – whilst wyverns have only two.\n\n– Smaug IS a dragon\n\nYes he is. There’s no denying. Tolkien clearly states that Smaug was one of the last great dragons to come out of the North.\n\nThe man himself even provided his own illustrations for this creature, clearly outlining the four-legs feature.\n\nIn the prologue to ‘An Unexpected Journey’, we even see Smaug’s legs grabbing hold of the gates of Erebor as he storms through, stomping dwarves along the way.\n\nSo far so good.\n\n– There’s one slight problem\n\nHere is where things start to diverge a bit.\n\nEver since the release of both ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ main trailer and the extended edition of ‘An Unexpected Journey’, it seems clear that Smaug’s forelegs are absent – indeed turning him into a wyvern-like creature.\n\nLet’s have a look at two shots from both examples:\n\nDarkness and smoke do much to conceal the overall appearance of the dragon, but it’s simply unmistakable. Smaug has only two legs and what appear to be claws at the points where the wings bend a little.\n\nBut having already seen ‘An Unexpected Journey’ many many times (hopefully), the keenest of viewers might ask then why we get a prologue in which Smaug clearly seems to use a set of forelegs to burst his way into Erebor.\n\nThere seems to be some kind of discrepancy here, no?\n\nPeter Jackson solves this (partially) by altering one, single shot for the extended edition.\n\nLet’s have a look at this shot in the two versions of the film:\n\nIn the top image (theatrical) we can clearly see two immense forelegs stomping around and trampling dwarves, whilst on the bottom image (extended), the shot has been altered to replace those legs with claws attached to a wingspan.\n\nObviously Peter Jackson has had second thoughts in including his dragon with four legs and re-designed (at least partially) the overall appearance of Smaug.\n\nHowever, although this particular shot was changed, the previous shots showing Smaug bursting into the Mountain have been left the same. And it’s hard to believe that he is using his hind legs to do so.\n\nThis begs the question: If they changed the “stomping shot” with the new one, why didn’t they change the others to adhere with the new design?\n\nI simply have no answer; however, I believe it may have been left on purpose to allow a switch between two distinct designs (read about the evolution of Smaug’s appearance below).\n\nAgain, it is very difficult to make exact statements on the character, since we have yet to see him in his true form in just under a month. But so far, considering the clues that have been provided in ‘An Unexpected Journey’ and the trailers, it seems as if Smaug is becoming more and more like a wyvern.\n\nPAUSE.\n\nLet’s be clear. Smaug in ‘The Hobbit’ is still a dragon, no matter whether he has two or four legs. When I refer to him being more “like a wyvern”, I’m referring to the shape and appearance, which is unlike the traditional four-legged dragon form.\n\nJackson himself stated, months before the first film’s release, that they were keeping Smaug a secret, partly due to possible changes in his appearance. Rightly so, it seems that the final look of Smaug was not yet locked and was still evolving over the course of release between films 1 and 2.\n\nBy giving only a few glimpses in AUJ, the director was able to happily alter some characteristics of the “dragon” without worrying too much about continuity.\n\nThat said, the change in the extended edition is pretty obviously nonetheless …\n\n– The two Smaugs\n\nAs a film enthusiast with a slight tendency to go into too much detail, this has some profound ‘consequences’ (not necessarily negative) when it comes to viewing ‘The Hobbit’ as a cinematic trilogy.\n\nI would start asking questions like:\n\n-Which version of ‘An Unexpected Journey’ should I watch?\n\n-If I decide on the theatrical edition, then THAT Smaug is not entirely the same as the one in ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ – so technically speaking there’s not one, but two.\n\nWe have two of these creatures were one is shaped like a typical dragon and the other like wyvern. Considering ‘The Desolation of Smaug’ adopts the latter concept, then the particular scene of the attack on Erebor in the theatrical AUJ is nullified.\n\nWhat?!?!\n\nPardon me. There goes my instinct of analyzing things I care about in intricate detail and complexity.\n\nIf a particular creature design has been shown in a trailer but then turns out to be completely different in the main film, that is perfectly fine (see the first teaser for PJ’s ‘King Kong’).\n\nHowever, it is a different thing when two “final” versions of the film (theatrical and extended) display two differing images.\n\nA film is a story with its own time and space; consisting of specific rules and content pertaining to that narrative. Visuals complement sound and vice-versa, supporting the overall storytelling within a believable world.\n\nWhen I see these two shots next to each other, I can’t help but think that there are two Smaugs in ‘The Hobbit’ Trilogy – the Smaug as we shall see in the upcoming films and the Smaug which never was (i.e. the four-legged creature).\n\nAnd yet, the latter Smaug still exists to some extent. He exists within the time-space continuum (sorry!) of the theatrical version of ‘An Unexpected Journey’. And even though we only see glimpses of him, we can image the four-legged dragon residing under the Lonely Mountain – and when we see a foot, a tail, a head or an eye, in that version of the film, we can conjure up the image of that particular dragon.\n\nWith the alterations in the extended edition, the imaginary path that started with the first film, kind of branches off into a parallel universe where exactly the same things occur in the narrative, but will in some way create a new path for the rest of the story containing a two-legged dragon.\n\nPlease see illustration below explaining my chain of thought, in simple terms as much as possible:\n\n– I love dragons. And wyverns!\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this post, I’m in love with dragons. These beautifully depicted creatures that soar into the sky with a roar and scorch the earth as a hobby, are fantastic.\n\nAnd that is not to say that wyverns aren’t either. Considering their shape, and the lack of any forelegs, makes them look somewhat more sinister (or evil) than their dragon counterpart.\n\nHaving four legs instead of two, dragons give me the impression that they have more control over their movements, rather than having to rely on their claws and wings; by keeping the wings as separate limbs, they can much easily and quickly fly or run (not sure what dragons do exactly … gallop?) – seriously making them more powerful than wyverns.\n\nNonetheless, they too are awesome and I still cannot avoid relating (or momentarily confusing) one with the other.\n\nHence I have absolutely nothing against Smaug having two legs instead of four – as long as he still retains his “dragon qualities”; with Benedict Cumberbatch providing the right amount of spine-tingling moments with his voice and performance (which seems very promising in the trailers).\n\nYes Tolkien specifically illustrated the dragon as having four, instead of two, legs and I would still prefer it if Peter Jackson retained the original design.\n\nBut unfortunately, I can’t change the man’s decisions.\n\nIf you’re still not convinced about the whole two-legged dragon, have a look at a couple of other dragon films that you may have enjoyed but never really realized what kind creatures they had.\n\n– A good dose of consolation …\n\nRemember the Harry Potter films?\n\nYou may remember the two dragons found in ‘Goblet of Fire’ and ‘Deathly Hallows: Part II’.\n\nIt is only after researching for this post that I realized both of them do not have four legs – and yet, they are still “dragons”.\n\nThey still look cool and perform the job of chasing or aiding the characters well.\n\nLet’s not also forget two other films known for their fire-breathing dragons: ‘Dragonslayer’ and ‘Reign of Fire’. In both stories, the dragons are also two-legged, giving them a seemingly more viscous and evil appearance than other similar creatures.\n\n***\n\nAnd aren’t we forgetting something from Middle-earth too?\n\nRemember the Ringwraiths in ‘The Lord of the Rings’? After being unhorsed at Rivendell, they acquire fell-beasts to aid them in their search for the One Ring.\n\nNow, now…\n\nI can already hear some of you loudly proclaiming that these are not dragons – and rightly so.\n\nNonetheless, their attributes and physical characteristics bear a close resemblance to the traditional form of a dragon (at least, according to Peter Jackson’s vision).\n\nStill not convinced?\n\nThen I urge you to wait just four more weeks to see the finished result on Smaug the Magnificent!\n\n[Copyright of all screenshots, illustrations and images belong to the respective studios and artists]"
