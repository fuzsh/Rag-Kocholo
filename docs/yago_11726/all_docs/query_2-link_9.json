        "text": "Animation\n\nDirecting\n\nThe Definitive List of Rankin Bass Christmas Claymation Movies\n\nNothing says the holidays like Rankin Bass Christmas claymation movies. Whether you’re in your fifties or early twenties, you probably remember those Christmas movies that infiltrated your living room right around December 1st. Producer, writer, and director(s), Arthur Rankin Jr. and Jules Bass, have imprinted their style and Christmas cheer on several generations. But just out of curiosity…does anyone actually remember how weird these movies were? It’s a list all of the Rankin Bass Christmas claymation movies ever made!\n\nWatch: The Ultimate Guide to Animation\n\nSubscribe for more filmmaking videos like this.\n\nClassic Christmas Claymation Movies\n\n12. Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (1964)\n\nRankin Bass’ Rudolph was a hit\n\nOne of the most festive of the Rankin Bass Productions — the one that started it all. It has everything you’d want in a Christmas movie — elves making toys, Santa giving out those toys, and a beautiful sleigh ride on Christmas Eve. Seems fairly typical.\n\nBut, in addition, there’s also an island for “The Misfits.” There are elves who want more for themselves than toy-making (one in particular has big dreams of becoming a dentist?), a skinny Santa Claus who won’t stop calling Mrs. Claus, “Mama,” and reindeer who fall in love.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nRudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\n\nWeird Thing? Everyone, including Santa, treats the misfits pretty horribly until they decide they’re “useful” Not the best message for kids, but hey, it was the '60s.\n\nTomatometer: 95%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nChristmas Claymation Movies\n\n11. The Little Drummer Boy (1968)\n\nThe Little Drummer Boy claymation\n\nLike most Rankin Bass claymation movies, this one was written by Romeo Muller, and is based off of the song. It’s a biblically-inspired claymation film, but that’s not what’s wrong with it. It’s just overall pretty depressing in tone and story.\n\nOur protagonist (a little boy) sees his parents get killed at around 8 minutes in. Happy Holidays, everyone! It does end better but the 25-minute film mostly stays depressing.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe Little Drummer Boy\n\nWeird Thing? The opening has little drummer boy barking orders at his animal friends until they get attacked by some dudes in the desert. Good times.\n\nTomatometer: 75%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nChristmas Claymation\n\n10. Santa Claus is Comin’ to Town (1970)\n\nFred Astaire narrates this iconic Christmas Movie\n\nWhen I was kid, Christmas wouldn’t have been the same without this movie. It’s synonymous with tradition. The story of Kris Kringle and the future Mrs. Claus. Though, there are a few things now that I seemed to have missed as a kid.\n\nThe origin story of Santa Claus is that of a blonde-haired, blue-eyed kid who saves the town from German tyranny. You might remember the name, Burgermeister Meisterberger. It’s this film that is the start of many more European villains by the Rankin Bass duo.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nSanta Claus is Comin’ to Town\n\nWeird Thing? The future Mrs. Claus sings a song about what could be with Kris, going into a kind of psychedelic fantasy. Again, maybe it was just the '70s.\n\nTomatometer: 93%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nClaymation Xmas Movies\n\n9. The Year Without a Santa Claus (1974)\n\nA claymation Christmas in California\n\nBased on the book by Phyllis McGinley, screenplay by William Keenan, Rankin and Bass give us a great story about the power of belief. But if you’re familiar with Rankin/Bass productions, there is a propensity for deity figures.\n\nMother nature meets with Mrs. Claus and Heat Miser and Snow Miser, are representative of good and evil? Either way, a pretty underrated Christmas movie. It’s more than festive, fun, and Mrs. Claus actually takes charge. When Santa takes a break, she devises a master plan. It’s kind of awesome.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe Year Without a Santa Claus\n\nWeird Thing? Okay, this one isn’t really that weird but a lot of it does take place in California. Great for Californians, and a nice change of pace for those kids! But they do mistake a reindeer for a dog...enough said.\n\nTomatometer: 90%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nRankin Bass Movies\n\n8. The First Christmas: The Story of the First Christmas Snow (1975)\n\nIf you haven’t seen it...well, makes sense\n\nA young Shepard is left blind after a freak lightning storm and brought into a convent to recover. Of course, we all learn the \"true meaning of Christmas\" but you wouldn't expect anything less.\n\nAngela Lansbury is the narrator of this claymation short, voicing as Mother Theresa, and that’s really the best part of it.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe First Christmas\n\nWeird Thing? The writer of the song “White Christmas,” Irving Berlin was reportedly against the use of his song in the special. But no one, not even Rankin discussing it in an interview later, really knows why.\n\nTomatometer: N/A\n\nWatch Now →\n\nRankin Bass Rudolph Movies\n\n7. Rudolph’s Shiny New Year (1976)\n\nNot really a Christmas special, but close enough\n\nThe sequel to the 1964 Rudolph is a strange one. Baby New Year (literally a baby) runs away for being mocked for his big ears and Rudolph is there to help? Written by none other than Rankin and Bass’ go-to, Romeo Muller, it’s fairly in-line with the other films.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nRudolph’s Shiny New Year\n\nWeird Thing? A baby gets made fun of, and there’s also a giant baby-eating vulture, which...why?\n\nTomatometer: 50%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nOld Christmas Claymation Movies\n\n6. Nestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey (1977)\n\nWatch a Donkey be a hero\n\nNot the most festive of the Rankin Bass Christmas claymation movies, but an interesting one nonetheless. It’s extremely heartfelt and sweet, but ultimately about a donkey understanding his destiny on the road to Bethlehem. A little weird.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nNestor the Long-Eared Christmas Donkey\n\nWeird Thing? The entire point of this film. I mean it was cute. But a donkey’s mom dies on top of her son. And that donkey’s long ears protect the Virgin Mary?\n\nTomatometer: 56%\n\nWatch Now: N/A\n\nCreepy Claymation Movies\n\n5. Jack Frost (1979)\n\nRankin and Bass do it again: a classic creepy Christmas\n\nJack Frost controls everything from inside his cloud, with other weird elf like creatures. Also, a Russian is the villain. Though I guess this isn’t totally surprising considering it is Rankin and Bass.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nJack Frost\n\nWeird Thing? Poor European villagers who can’t afford gifts, fake excitement when they pretend to exchange presents. Merry Christmas!\n\nTomatometer: 57%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nWeird Rankin and Bass Movies\n\n4. Rudolph & Frosty’s Christmas in July (1979)\n\nThis one is a little dark, but still a Christmas movie nonetheless\n\nAnother warlock comes into be ⏤ Winterbolt. I’d argue it lacks some holiday spirit, with a slightly villainous plot. But there are enough Christmas songs in it, I guess.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nRudolph & Frosty’s Christmas in July\n\nWeird Thing? Lots of death. Frosty, his wife, their kids. And a light goddess. All die. I guess it's summer, right?\n\nTomatometer: 20%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nClassic Christmas Claymation\n\n3. Pinocchio’s Christmas (1980)\n\nRankin and Bass try their style with Pinocchio\n\nNot their best claymation Christmas special. Pinocchio can’t buy his dad a present. It’s not so much weird as a little boring.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nPinocchio’s Christmas\n\nWeird Thing? What inspired them to make this movie? Money? It trickled its way into the plot. The entire plot.\n\nTomatometer: 20%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nTrying Something New?\n\n2. Leprechaun's Christmas Gold (1981)\n\nA not-so-classic claymation short film\n\nAnother great screenplay written by Romeo Muller. Just kidding. An Irish sailor is stranded on a magical island filled with Leprechauns? Ah, yes, a Christmas keeper. But I have to hand it to them filmmakers, it’s so bad, it’s kind of glorious.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nLeprechaun's Christmas Gold\n\nWeird Thing? The whole damn thing.\n\nTomatometer: N/A\n\nWatch Now: N/A\n\nStop Motion Christmas Movies\n\n1. The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus (1985)\n\nThe weirdest of them all\n\nI just, I’m not sure what they were thinking with this one. It makes sense that they ended their Christmas claymation spectacular’s here. It’s a Santa Claus origin story filled with magical lions, children-hating demons, and spirit lords voting on his immortality?\n\nI mean all right. I’m not really mad at this.\n\nIN CONCLUSION\n\nThe Life and Adventures of Santa Claus\n\nWeird Thing? Santa gets kidnapped by demons. And the premise. The whole premise.\n\nTomatometer: 63%\n\nWatch Now →\n\nShowcase your vision with elegant shot lists and storyboards.\n\nCreate robust and customizable shot lists.
