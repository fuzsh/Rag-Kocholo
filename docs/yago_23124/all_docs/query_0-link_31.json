        "text": "BRUCE Willis and Demi Moore were one of Hollywood's most talked about it couples.\n\nDespite a high-profile divorce, the two have remained close friends who have stuck together through parenthood, health battles, and more.\n\nWhat is Bruce Willis and Demi Moore's relationship timeline?\n\nThe Meeting: July 1987\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis first met at a movie screening in Los Angeles.\n\nThe GI Jane actress was actually with her then-fiancé, Emilio Estevez when she met Bruce at the premiere of Stakeout.\n\nIn December 1986, Demi and Emilio called off their engagement.\n\nAfter ending her relationship with Estevez, she and Bruce began dating.\n\nThe Wedding: November 21, 1987\n\nNot long after meeting, Demi and Bruce headed off on an impromptu trip to Las Vegas.\n\nWhile on their spur-of-the-moment getaway, the Die Hard actor popped the question.\n\nThe loved-up couple was wed inside their suite at the Golden Nugget hotel with only a handful of guests in attendance.\n\nSpeaking in her 2019 memoir, Demi said: \"We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married.'\n\n\"We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding.\"\n\nA month later, the couple had another ceremony with their friends and family.\n\nThe Children: August 16, 1988/July 20, 1991/February 3, 1994\n\nIt is believed that Demi fell pregnant on their wedding night, as Rumer Willis was born on August 16, 1988.\n\nThey later welcomed two more daughters: Scout on July 20, 1991, and Tallulah on February 3, 1994.\n\nDuring this period, the couple juggled parenthood and their careers - regularly traveling to Hollywood from Idaho during filming.\n\nThe Split: June 25, 1998\n\nOn June 25, 1998, the couple released a statement saying that they were splitting up after more than a decade of marriage.\n\nThey revealed: \"Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have announced they are ending their marriage after 11 years. They were married on November 21, 1987.\"\n\nAccording to reports, the couple had been living apart for months due to conflicting film schedules.\n\nThe former husband and wife were officially divorced on October 18, 2000.\n\nDespite no longer being a couple, the pair continued to co-parent their kids and have always remained great friends.\n\nOther Marriages: 2005/2009\n\nDemi and Ashton Kutcher:\n\nOn September 24, 2005, Demi married actor Ashton Kutcher in a private ceremony at their home.\n\nBruce was a guest at their nuptials.\n\nDemi and Ashton's divorce was finalized on November 26, 2013, and Bruce remained by her side to help her through the split.\n\nAshton went on to marry his childhood sweetheart Mila Kunis, and they now have two children.\n\nBruce and Emma Heming:\n\nOn March 21, 2009, Bruce married model Emma Heming.\n\nThe couple met through friends and dated for a year before tying the knot.\n\nAt the time, Demi and Ashton were still together and attended the Pulp Fiction star's second wedding.\n\nThe Lockdown: 2020\n\nDuring the initial quarantine of early 2020 due to Covid-19, Bruce and Demi - along with their kids and their partners - began isolating themselves together.\n\nBruce was unable to be with his wife Emma and his youngest daughter Evelyn because the latter had accidentally stabbed herself with a needle in a park.\n\nThe travel ban went into effect while Emma and Evelyn were still seeking medical treatment in Los Angeles.\n\nThe family continuously updated fans with pictures of them in matching PJs, taking part in an art class, and uploading funny videos - which included Bruce mimicking Demi's famous scene from the 90s movie, Ghost.\n\nThe Diagnosis: March 30, 2022\n\nOn March 30, 2022, members of Bruce's family took to Instagram to announce the actor would be stepping down from his career due to a diagnosis of aphasia, a cognitive disability.\n\n\"To Bruce's amazing supporters, as a family we wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,\" the caption read, across various family member's profiles - including Demi's.\n\n\"As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\"\n\nThey continued: \"This is a really challenging time for our family and we are so appreciative of your continued love, compassion and support.\n\n\"We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him.\"\n\nThe post concluded: \"As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that.\"\n\nOn February 16, 2023, Bruce's eldest daughter Rumer shared an update that specified his exact health condition.\n\nHe now has a more specific diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia - a distinctive form of dementia that affects language and behavior.\n\nShe revealed: \"Our family wanted to start by expressing our deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love, support, and wonderful stories we have all received since sharing Bruce’s original diagnosis.\n\n\"In the spirit of that, we wanted to give you an update about our beloved husband, father and friend since we now have a deeper understanding of what he is experiencing."
