        "text": "DEMI Moore has shared a series of previously unseen photos of Bruce Willis in celebration of Father's Day amid his battle with aphasia.\n\nThe Rough Night star and other members of her family have been open with fans about Bruce's health struggles, sharing updates along the way.\n\nOn Sunday, Demi, 61, posted a carousel of snaps of Bruce, 69, through the years.\n\nThe former couple's children, including Rumer Willis, Scout Willis, and Tallulah Willis, appeared in many of the adorable snaps.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to our favorite girl dad. We love you, BW!\" Demi captioned the post.\n\nThe first photo in the bunch showed a young Bruce holding one of his children.\n\nHe was shirtless, wearing only swim trunks, while she was dressed in a pink outfit.\n\nThe second pic was more recent.\n\nIt showed Bruce standing alongside Rumer, 35, pointing up toward the sky.\n\nShe was cuddled close to her father, resting her head on his shoulder.\n\nDemi shared yet a third pic of young Bruce, this time with one of his kids sitting on his lap.\n\nHe was again shirtless, wearing only shorts, while the little girl was wrapped in a towel.\n\nThe fourth photo showed a heartwarming moment between Bruce and Scout, 32.\n\nBruce was sitting on a couch while his daughter rested a hand on his cheek.\n\nIn a different pic, the Paradise City star posed with one of his girls inside his shirt.\n\nBoth were sticking out their tongues.\n\nAnother photo showed the award-winning actor playing around with Tallulah.\n\nThe pair appeared to be dancing.\n\nThen Bruce was seen cuddling one of his daughters in a throwback.\n\nMabel and Evelyn, the young children the Die Hard actor shares with his current wife, Emma Hemming Willis, were featured as well.\n\nIn one photo, he cuddled one of the little girls, while in another, he appeared to be enjoying a spa day.\n\nBRUCE'S BATTLE\n\nBruce's family offered an update on his health struggles in May.\n\nThe Vendetta star was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in February 2023.\n\nHe retired from acting one year earlier, after it was revealed that he was struggling with aphasia.\n\nHis daughter Rumer shared new details about her father's health on the Today Show.\n\n\"He's so good,\" she said before reflecting on him spending time with her daughter, Louetta.\n\n\"They had some sweet moments during their last visit together, which was recently,\" she recalled.\n\n\"Lou is just starting to walk a little bit, and she was walking over to him, and it was so sweet.\n\n\"He's a girl dad, through and through. I saw him with my sisters, my little sisters. So you're seeing that all come back again.\"\n\nRumer went on to reveal that she and her family have received so much love after opening up about Bruce's condition.\n\nShe also noted how important it has been for them to be open about it.\n\n\"If it can have any impact on another family that is struggling in any way with something like this, or bring more attention to the disease in hopes of finding a cure or anything that can be of service to anybody else, I think it's really important,\" she explained.\n\nBruce has been diagnosed with an aggressive degenerative disorder.\n\nDoctors have said that patients with this ailment are frequently mute within two years of being diagnosed.\n\n\"Usually, once symptoms start, it's a pretty steady progression over the next few years,\" Dr Chris Winter, a neurologist, told DailyMail.com.\n\n\"Generally speaking, when they're diagnosed, there's a five-to-10-year prognosis, but in terms of the disability, it's in a few years, a lot of individuals are just not communicative.\"\n\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the most common form of dementia in people under the age of 60.\n\nSymptoms include personality changes, obsessive behavior, and speaking difficulties.\n\nAphasia is the inability to understand or formulate language due to damage to areas of the brain."
