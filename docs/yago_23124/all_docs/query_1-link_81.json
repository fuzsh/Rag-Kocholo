Bruce and his ex-wife Moore share three daughters including their 35-year-old Rumer 32-year-old Scout, and 30-year-old Tallulah. He also shares two daughters with his current wife Emma - 12-year-old Mabel Ray and 10-year-old Evelyn Penn.\n\nThe joint post shared by Emma, Demi, Tallulah, Rumer, and Scout showcased Bruce being a loving father over the years including a precious recent snap of his daughter Scout caressing the 69-year-old retired actor's face.

Happy Father's Day.\"\n\nA third added: \"Such a gorgeous man! Talented actor! Total package.\" Another brought up Bruce's ongoing battle with frontotemporal dementia and wrote: \"This is beautiful.

Happy Father's Day to Papa.\"\n\nThis comes as his daughter Rumer recently shared how Bruce is not only an incredible dad but also the best grandfather. Despite his health struggles, Bruce has grown to share a strong bond with her young daughter.

It almost unlocks that kind of little-kid, girl-dad thing. He's so sweet with her.\""
