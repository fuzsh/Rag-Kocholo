        "text": "Bruce Willis‚Äô wifehas made a comment that will either raise eyebrows or sound refreshingly secure.\n\nEmma Heming Willis, who has been married to the ‚ÄúDie Hard‚Äù star since 2009 and shares two children with him, posted a surprising Instagram Story about him and his ex-wife, Demi Moore, on Tuesday.\n\nThe model reposted a throwback black-and-white photo of her husband with Moore when they were married, sourced from a Bruce Willis fan account. In overlaying text, Heming Willis wrote: ‚ÄúYeah. Me too. I liked them together as well ü•∞.‚Äù\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis pose for a portrait at the opening of Planet Hollywood at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, in 1993.\n\nThe post is no longer available on Heming Willis‚Äô account, but was screenshot by People. The image Heming Willis used is above.\n\nMoore and the ‚ÄúMoonlighting‚Äù star were married from 1987 to 2000, during which they welcomed three daughters: Rumer Willis, 34, Scout LaRue Willis, 31, and Tallulah Willis, 29. He later went on to welcome two more children with his second wife: Mabel Ray Willis, 11, and Evelyn Penn Willis, 8.\n\nThe blended family has always appeared to be close.\n\nRumer Willis, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Scout Willis, Emma Heming Willis and Tallulah Willis at Moore's \"Inside Out\" book party on Sept. 23, 2019, in Los Angeles.\n\nIn fact, Heming Willis shared a video on Instagram featuring Moore at a surprise birthday dinner for Mabel just hours after originally sharing the old photo of Moore and the ‚ÄúPulp Fiction‚Äù star together. Heming Willis also thanked Moore on Instagram for acting as her ‚Äúvideographer‚Äù at her 10-year vow renewal ceremony to Bruce Willis in late March.\n\nHeming Willis was also pretty cool about her husband quarantining with Moore in Idaho during the pandemic without her.\n\nScout Willis explained on the ‚ÄúDopey‚Äù podcast that Heming Willis had intended to join her husband, the ‚ÄúGhost‚Äù star and Moore‚Äôs daughters at their Idaho home, but she opted to stay in Los Angeles with her girls after one of her daughters had a medical emergency,\n\n‚ÄúSo my stepmom had to be in LA waiting to get the results from taking her to the doctor, so my dad came [to Idaho] early and then travel got crazy,‚Äù Scout Willis said. ‚ÄúSo my stepmom stayed in LA with my little sisters.‚Äù"
