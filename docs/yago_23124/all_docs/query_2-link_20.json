Because there's great beauty and sweetness and loving and joy out of that.\"\n\nPreviously, the Brat Pack star spoke with E! News about learning how to prioritize and deal with life in the face of hardships and challenges, whether personal or in the family.\n\n\"I had this illness at 18 that really pushed me to focus on following a different path,\" she told the publication. \"And it is a journey of finding what's right. And I think that consciousness around what we want has really elevated on a more mass level, which is very exciting.\"\n\nIn 2022, the ladies of the Willis-Moore family (which also includes Bruce and Emma's two young daughters, Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, nine) revealed that the Die Hard star, 68, had been diagnosed with aphasia and would be effectively retiring from acting.\n\nMORE: Rumer Willis reflects on spending 'precious moments' with father Bruce Willis amid declining health\n\nIn February 2023, they shared a new update on his diagnosis, revealing that it had progressed to frontotemporal dementia, which was affecting his communication and language skills.\n\n\"Our family wanted to start by expressing our deepest gratitude for the incredible outpouring of love, support and wonderful stories we have all received since sharing Bruce's original diagnosis,\" their statement read.\n\nAfter sharing more about the disease, it continued: \"Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces. While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.\"\n\nMORE: Bruce Willis' daughter Rumer Willis makes heartbreaking confession about relationship with dad amid illness – fans react\n\nEmma, in particular, has been a vocal advocate for research on the disease and has been tremendously open about life as a caregiver, spreading awareness, making time for physical and mental health, and the importance of family and community support.\n\nLooking back on 2023, she shared on Instagram recently that over the past year, she'd built that \"inner circle\" that helped the couple find their healing.\n\nSEE: Emma Heming Willis cozies up to Bruce Willis in rare photo as they celebrate during challenging time\n\n\"People from all walks of life [are] sharing the same unfortunate thread that connects us,\" she penned. \"I receive countless messages of love and support because Bruce is so beloved.\n\n\"That showers on him and I am fortunate enough to stand below that to catch those sprinkles that yet, feel like a waterfall of kindness. I wish I could answer all the messages because they are deep, raw and poetic but please know that I appreciate them so very much. It also makes me feel less alone.\""
