        "text": "Hollywood actress Demi Moore has posted an emotional tribute to her ailing ex-husband Bruce Willis to mark his 69th birthday.\n\nMoore shared a photo of her perched on the arm of a couch beside Willis, who was diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia in 2023.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Bruce Willis and Demi Moore sweetly dance at home.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nThe candid snap appeared to be taken during a conversation they were having.\n\n“Happy birthday, BW! We love you and are so grateful for you ♥️,” Moore captioned the photo.\n\nThe second photo was of the Die Hard actor smiling lovingly at his grandchild Louetta, whom Willis and Moore’s oldest daughter Rumer welcomed in April 2023.\n\nMoore’s third photo was a throwback of Willis smiling to the camera surrounded by their three girls, Rumer, Scout and Tallulah, who are now all in their 30s.\n\nFans were quick to react to the sweet post and admire their relationship.\n\n“Their relationship is the sweetest thing ever ❤,” one said.\n\n“Thank you for providing a loving example of parenting even after divorce. ❤️ You’re helping your children more than you know 🥰,” a second said.\n\n“Absolutely love how, even though Bruce and Demi are divorced, they love and respect each other as parents and grandparents ❤🙌,” added another.\n\nMoore also shared to her Instagram stories a video first posted by their first-born daughter, Rumer, 35.\n\nThe video can be viewed in the video player above.\n\nWillis counts to keep his ex-wife on beat as they dance “down the hall” and their daughter laughs on.\n\n“This is you in all your silliness and glory and I love it,” Moore said.\n\nMeanwhile, Rumer also shared a tribute for Willis’ 69th birthday, writing, “Oh Daddio, to be loved by you is such a gift.\n\n“You are the funniest, most tender, charming, out of this world silly, talented and magical papa.\n\n“Looking through these photos ... I am just filled with the deepest gratitude that we chose to spend this life together.\n\n“I am your first baby and, man, sometimes I wish I could be tiny enough to just cozy up on your chest again and laugh and cuddle you.\n\n“I love you so deep in my bones I don’t know how my muscles hold them.\n\n“You are the greatest papa I could ever hope for.\n\n“Thank you for your generosity, your silliness and heart.\n\n“Lou (Rumer’s daughter) loves you so big.”\n\nRumer’s younger sister Scout, 32, said in her own social media post that “dad is one of my best friends, perhaps now on a deeper level than ever honestly.\n\n“I cherish his affection and the immense freedom with which he’s always loved us.”\n\nWillis’ wife Emma Heming Willis, 45, also shared a sweet message, posting a throwback photo of the actor hugging one of their two daughters.\n\nThe couple has two children, Mabel Ray Willis, 11, and Evelyn Penn Willis, nine.\n\n“Just like you, we simply adore him. What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world,” Heming Willis said.\n\n“He’s a true gentle man. With so much love to give and share.\n\n“That’s what I get to see, his true core. I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good.\n\n“Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving 💞.”\n\nIn 2022, the family shared that Willis had been diagnosed with aphasia.\n\nBut in February 2023, they said the disease had progressed to frontotemporal dementia, or FTD.\n\n“Since we announced Bruce’s diagnosis of aphasia in spring 2022, Bruce’s condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD),” the family said in a joint statement in February 2023.\n\n“Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces.\n\n“While this is painful, it is a relief to finally have a clear diagnosis.”\n\nIn a broader statement, posted to The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration (AFTD) website, Bruce’s family explained more about the condition.\n\n“FTD is a cruel disease that many of us have never heard of and can strike anyone. For people under 60, FTD is the most common form of dementia, and because getting the diagnosis can take years, FTD is likely much more prevalent than we know,” they wrote.\n\n“Today there are no treatments for the disease, a reality that we hope can change in the years ahead.\n\n“As Bruce’s condition advances, we hope that any media attention can be focused on shining a light on this disease that needs far more awareness and research.”"
