        "text": "Bruce Willis’ family members celebrated the actor’s 69th birthday with beautifully written social media posts, including a tender photograph of him with ex Demi Moore.\n\nThe Die Hard star, who is living with dementia, has five daughters – Rumer, 35, Scout, 32 and Tallulah, 30, with former wife Demi, 61, and Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9, with wife Emma Hemming Willis, 45.\n\nDespite their divorce in 1998, Bruce and Demi have remained close, raising their children and now grandchildren together, and she also has a good relationship with Emma and her own daughters.\n\nHis family celebrated Bruce’s birthday this week, with Emma sharing special message summarising her experience of being a loved one to ‘true gentle-man’ Bruce.\n\nSince his initial aphasia and subsequent frontotemporal dementia diagnosis, Bruce has been supported by other members of his loving family including Demi, who posted a recent photograph of them together for his special day.\n\nIn the snap, Bruce sits in a comfortable armchair while Demi sits on the armrest, facing each other with serious but gentle looks on their faces, and hold each other’s hands.\n\n‘Happy birthday, BW! We love you and are so grateful for you,’ the actress told her five million followers.\n\nEmma, meanwhile, wrote a lengthy, heartfelt post about how much he meant to her, addressing his fans as she wrote ‘just like you, we simply adore him’,’ she began her tribute on Instagram. ‘.\n\n‘What you might not know, but maybe you could imagine, that being wrapped in his arms is the safest place in this whole wide world.’\n\nAlongside Anne’s thoughtful words, she shared a photo of Bruce hugging a young child.\n\n‘He’s a true gentle-man. With so much love to give and share. That’s what I get to see, his true core. I can tell you, it’s so pure and ever so good,’ the caption continued.\n\n‘Happy Birthday my love. You are the gift that keeps giving.’\n\nRumer showed her gratitude for Bruce with a series of throwback photos.\n\n‘Oh Daddio, to be loved by you is such a gift. You are the funniest, most tender, charming, out of this world silly talented and magical papa.\n\n‘I am your first baby and man sometimes I wish I could be tiny enough to just cozy up on your chest again and laugh and cuddle you,’ she added.\n\n‘Lou [Rumer’s daughter] loves you so big,’ the post concluded.\n\nScout echoed the sentiments calling Bruce one of her best friends.\n\n‘A tender, moody, beautiful, very Piscean man, whose depth of love for his family can only be felt, not articulated. Any words I use would be woefully inadequate.\n\n‘So instead I want to say thank you for loving my papa, thank you for sharing your stories of what he means to you, it’s such a gift to feel your love.’\n\nTallulah decided to share a video of Bruce previously shaving her hair and simply wrote: ‘I love my twin HBD’.\n\nBruce’s friend Glenn Gordon Caron, who directed episodes of 80s TV series Moonlighting where Bruce made his big break, said he was no longer ‘totally verbal’ or able to read, but he is ‘still Bruce’.\n\nBruce retired from acting in 2022 after being told he had aphasia, which is classed as an inability to comprehend language because of damage to specific brain regions. In February 2023, Bruce’s family announced he had been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) – the second most common form of the disease after Alzheimer’s.\n\nThere are currently no treatments for the condition.\n\nEmma recently felt forced to hit back at a claim that Bruce had no joy in his life, saying it was ‘far from the truth’.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Demi Moore had to ‘let go’ of Bruce Willis to cope with dementia diagnosis\n\nMORE : Bruce Willis’ wife shares poignant throwback photo to mark Valentine’s Day after his health struggles"
