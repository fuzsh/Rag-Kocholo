        "text": "Almost the entire entertainment industry was surprised to learn about Ashton Kutcher and Demi Moore’s relationship. The 15-year age difference between the celebrities was a prominent topic of discussion among fans. Interestingly, Moore’s family dynamics also changed as daughter Rumer Willis became awkward on Kutcher’s inclusion.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore Ashton Kutcher, Demi Moore was married to the Die Hard actor Bruce Willis, with whom she shares three children. Among them, Rumer Glenn Willis was the eldest daughter. In an interview, Rumer stated that it was initially awkward for her to know her mom was in a relationship with the That ’70s Show star as the latter was her celebrity crush.\n\nDemi Moore’s relationship with Ashton Kutcher shocked Rumer Willis\n\nWhen the popular celebrity duo tied the knot in 2005, Demi Moore was 42 while Ashton Kutcher was only 27. But the duo had been already seeing each other since 2003. It was a time when Kutcher was a sensation among many girls and Moore’s eldest daughter, Rumer Willis, happened to be one of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with Cosmopolitan (via Contact Music), Moore’s eldest daughter stated that back then the Punk’d host was her heart-throb and she was madly fan-girling over him. She had pictures of him all over her wall and it was not easy to grasp that her mom was seeing her celebrity crush.\n\nIt was strange when mom, who is 15 years older than Ashton, started seeing him [in 2003]. I was 15 and he was a heart-throb to me – I had pictures of him on my wall. I remember mom saying her new ‘friend’ was going to hang out with us. I said, ‘What’s his name?’ and she said, ‘It’s Ashton’. And I said, ‘Whoa – Ashton Kutcher?’ I freaked out a bit and blushed.\n\nNevertheless, things did not stay awkward for long, as Bruce Willis’ daughter understood that nothing could be more important than her mother being happy. She figured out that Demi Moore was very happy with Ashton Kutcher and it slowly cleared out the awkwardness for her- “I realized I’d never seen my mom happier. It was like watching two sixteen-year-olds going to the prom.”\n\nUnfortunately, six months into the relationship, Demi Moore also had a tough time when she lost a child with Kutcher. However, that bad time also affected Moore’s relationship with her daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow did Demi Moore’s relationship with Ashton Kutcher affect her relationship with her daughters?\n\nWhen Rumer Willis appeared alongside her sister Tallulah Willis and mother Demi Moore on the Red Table Talk (via HuffPost), she shared that Ashton Kutcher’s inclusion in the family affected the dynamics between the mother and the sisters.\n\nRumer Willis asserted that she felt a lack of attention and went into self-doubt if she was not enough for Demi Moore to stay happy.\n\nSo much of that time, especially with Ashton, I was so angry because I felt like something that was mine had been taken away. I think also, when she wanted to have another baby and then it wasn’t happening, and there was so much focus on that, it was like ‘Oh, well we’re not enough.’\n\nRumer Willis also added that she moved out of the house partly because she was not happy with her mother wanting another baby after the first miscarriage with Kutcher. But things soon changed as she caught the pregnancy photos of Moore and realized that she was being inconsiderate- “But then I found these pictures, and I was like, ‘Oh my god.'”\n\nAdvertisement"
