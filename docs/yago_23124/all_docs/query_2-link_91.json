        "text": "Bruce Willis turned 69 on March 19 and the legendary actor received a multitude of messages that reached him through social media and one of the ones the Die Hard star will treasure most the affection of his ex-wife, Demi Moore.\n\nThe actress, who was married to him for 13 years between 1987-2000, showed again that they have an excellent relationship and shared a beautiful post to celebrate their anniversary, although he has since gone on to marry Emma Heming.\n\nSince the news of Bruce Willis' illness, diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia, Moore has been one of the people who have been closest to him and, in fact, she often visits him at home, although sometimes Willis does not recognise her.\n\nNonetheless, in a post on her Instagram profile, where she has five million followers, Moore wrote: \"Happy Birthday, BW! We love you and are so grateful for you.\"\n\nAlong with the post, which earned thousands of likes and interactions in a few hours, Moore added a couple of image.\n\nOne was of the actress with Bruce Willis in one of his visits and, in another, the actor was with their three children and were enjoying their time together as she is also seen smiling.\n\nWhat is frontotemporal dementia?\n\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive damage to nerve cells in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. These regions are responsible for personality, behavior, language, and decision-making, essentially making a person \"a person\".\n\nFTD typically affects individuals under the age of 65, often striking in their 40s and 50s, making it one of the most common forms of dementia in younger adults and symptoms include changes in behavior, personality, and language difficulties but vary from each sufferer.\n\nBehavioral changes may manifest as apathy, disinhibition, social withdrawal, or repetitive behaviors. Language difficulties can range from difficulty finding words to complete loss of speech. Memory loss, a hallmark symptom of other dementias like Alzheimer's disease, is less prominent in FTD."
