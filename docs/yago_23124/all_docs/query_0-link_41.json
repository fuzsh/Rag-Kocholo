That of dad.\n\nFather to five daughters—Rumer, 35, Scout, 32, and Tallulah, 30, whom he shares with ex-wife Demi Moore as well as Mabel, 12, and Evelyn, 10, with wife Emma Heming Willis—the Die Hard actor is the ultimate girl dad, and for Father's Day the women in his life paid tribute to that fact.\n\n\"Happy Father's Day to our favorite girl dad,\" Demi captioned a joint June 16 post with her daughters and Emma. \"We love you, BW!\"\n\nAnd in the sweet carousel of pictures, Bruce could be seen living up to the title in a series of throwback images alongside more recent photos. And from lying with cucumbers on his eyes to holding all his children close, it's clear girl dad is a role Bruce took to beautifully his entire life."
