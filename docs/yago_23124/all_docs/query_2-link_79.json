        "text": "It’s been 22 years since Demi Moore and Bruce Willis said “I don’t” and got divorced after 12 years of marriage, but that doesn’t stop the co-parents from remaining close. The duo celebrated Willis’ 67th birthday this past weekend and Moore shared the moment in a sweet post on Instagram.\n\nIf you know anything about this family, you know they’ve stayed close. They even spent some of lockdown together! But over the years, they’ve used their social media handles to prove that yes, coparenting can work!\n\nOver the weekend, with a caption of “Happy Birthday, Bruce! Thankful for our blended family,” Demi shared a funny photo of the ex-es at home (whose home, we aren’t sure). The couple shares their three adult daughters together, Rumer, 33, Scout, 30, and Talulah, 28 and have long maintained a friendship that is major #blendedfamilygoals.\n\nNot only did Moore’s post get tons of birthday wishes, but fans also recognize the magic that is their long-standing friendship. Comments included “Love that you two are still close!!” and “it’s great you both can be together for the family” to “You guys do what you do so well…… such a cool family, and there seems to be such a fantastic balance.”\n\nBruces shares two daughters with wife, Emma Heming Willis (making Bruce a committed girl dad), Mabel Ray and Evelyn Penn. Even Emma is accepting of her husband and his ex-wife’s relationship. In a PEOPLE article from 2020, sources told the magazine that “Demi and Emma are close, and all three get on great as a big blended family. There are no issues at all.”\n\nMoore shares more about her and Willis’ relationship in her memoir, Inside Out. “We managed to move the heart of our relationship, the heart of what created our family, into something new that gave the girls a loving, supportive environment with both parents.”\n\nWhatever type of magic potion the two are using, it’s working. Judging by the successful young women that are their daughters, they’ve created a relationship that brings out the best.\n\nRELATED STORIES\n\nMichelle Branch Was Shamed For Public Breastfeeding–by Another Mom\n\nParents Can’t Stop Joking About Tom Brady’s Short-Lived Retirement\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda’s ‘Cure’ for ‘Encanto-Obsessed’ Kids Is Hilarious"
