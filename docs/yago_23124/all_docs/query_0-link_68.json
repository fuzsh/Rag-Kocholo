Maybe they are better people than I, but if my BF's ex wife ever ingratiated herself so firmly into our home life I would explode with rage. it's all just too eurgh for me. Curious what others think?",

        "text": "I think with celebrities they function at a different level because they are sort of removed from each other to begin with. The kids are raised by nannies (so that eliminates fighting over custody), and itâ€™s hard to hate somebody you probably only saw in between your acting schedules. Actors are all about appearances also, so if playing \"happy cohesive family\" for a few minutes is going to garner them public attention and put them in a good light they have no problem doing it.\n\nWhen I read how Valerie acted when Eddie died it turned my stomache.\n\nDH and I had a laugh this morning over the latest NJ Housewives episode (dont judge us, we live in Jersey and get a kick out of it during our hour together in the morning).\n\nTo break it down for the non-watchers: Frank and Dolores have been divorced for YEARS due to his cheating, but co-parented and even lived together while the dated other people. Dolores has a new man who has boundries and Frank is all butt hurt because it is changing the dynamic of his family. It's funny to watch this huge Jersey guy all in his fee fees because his ex is putting her new man first.\n\nCelebrities are primarily narcissistic and most of the actors I have met live on an emotional edge.\n\nI heard stories from a reliable source working on many sets in Hollywood that when Jim Carrey would take a role and show up on set he would morph into what he believed that person would be. He would get that much into the character and not shut off. That was his form of method acting. It threw those who were not used to him into confusion.\n\nIt is a world I do not understand. How someone can walk around for months and not break character does not make sense to me. You have to live disconnected from reality in order to do that i.e. Will Smith slapping Chris Rock over a silly joke and then delivering a speech about how he defends his family. His character was the Williams sister's dad and he was still in character when he did that, at least that is what I believe.\n\nThis is why I don't understand why anyone would ever take any advice from an actor outside of their craft, which is quite impressive. When it comes to marriage advice, kid advice, interior decorating, etc I would not want any advice or their opinions.\n\nThese two probably had an open marriage which is the norm for that culture.\n\nHowever, as public personalities, there may be some PR impetus in this. If Demi demonstrates anger and resentment towards Bruce it can impact her persona, their dauthers's public standing, etc.\n\nHopefully they truly are a big, close, happy, multiple phase blended family.\n\nI met Bruce when I worked in his home town in the early 00s for a number of years. He was a pleasant guy when I met him a couple of times at what I was told was his favorite watering hole. The plant I was at had the Bruce phone tree and when he was in town a number of people he had grown up with, etc... would show up at his favorite bar. I was invited a couple of times.\n\nHe supported his disabled cousin in that town providing a home and a living stipend, and did a lot of community support investments."
