        "text": "It's an overcast morning in Los Angeles, and I'm in a chauffeured limo on my way to Bruce Willis's house. I've known Bruce for eight years, but the last time I visited him at home was four years ago, when he was still living in New York, in Hell's Kitchen, on Tenth Avenue and Forty-ninth Street. A lot has happened to him since then. He's put a few rungs between us on the success ladder—an Emmy, a record album, three feature films—and I'm feeling a bit intimidated, even though his voice sounded the same on the phone last week and again this morning.\n\nWe pull up at the gate, a man inside punches out a combination on the touch-tone security system, a buzzer sounds, and the door opens. The man leads me to the house, a nice, unpretentious, two-story place, and takes me into the bright, spacious living room. It's modestly furnished; the polished floors are bare. There's Bruce, barefoot, in gym shorts, chomping away on a bowl of granola. He brings Hell's Kitchen and Malibu together in a second when he smiles and says, \"Hey, D, welcome to my crib.\"\n\nHe introduces me to his wife, Demi Moore, who's sitting on a couch in the living room, and then takes me out to a small backyard filled with lawn furniture. A closed gate opens out onto Malibu Beach, which I can see over the tall wooden fence. Before we sit down, I glance back through the patio door and watch Demi cross the living room to the kitchen. Her striking beauty, combined with the glow that emanates from women in early pregnancy, seems to accentuate each graceful stride. Bruce, noticing where my attention is directed, sighs with his old intimacy. \"She's something special, isn't she?\"\n\nWe plop down in a couple of chairs and look at each other. \"Jesus,\" I finally say, \"you've gone from zero to ninety in a flash. How'd you ever manage to shift gears so quickly?\"\n\n\"Are you talking about life or money?\" Bruce asks.\n\n\"Money first. That's what we used to have in common: neither of us had any. What was it like to make your first million?\"\n\n\"I didn't believe it. I was thrifty. You don't change overnight. I kept living like someone was going to call me up and say, 'Your phone bill is due.' \"\n\n\"And now you're getting five million for the movie Die Hard?\"\n\nHe takes a deep breath, and a disturbed look comes over his face, which indicates a clear distaste for the subject. He speaks slowly, as if he were cutting words into stone. \"I can still remember very clearly when money was very scarce. Five dollars was a lot of money. But once you have all of your financial needs taken care of, you don't worry about that anymore. You say, 'Now what? What do I focus on?' After a while it becomes just a number, an arbitrary figure, something of a game. I can tell you one thing: money doesn't make you happy. At first it becomes a weapon, and you use it to put distance between you and the things that are really important.\"\n\n\"But after you get beyond that stage,\" I say, \"what do you reach for?\"\n\n\"Love of my wife and my friends,\" he says without hesitation, \"and—whether it's for a hundred dollars or a million dollars—the chance to act.\"\n\n\"When I got hit with that first wave of success, it was like I was sixteen with wealthy parents and I was given my first car. I did this town over, partied hard, and in many cases I wasn't the nicest guy in the world.\"\n\nI met Bruce in the late summer of 1980, in a loft in Little Italy. The owner of the loft was directing a play I had written called Bullpen. Two new actors had been cast, and I was in no great shape to meet them. I'd been out whooping it up the night before, and I arrived at the rehearsal with a bad hangover. I alternated between watching the rehearsal and catching winks.\n\nAll of a sudden a voice was saying, \"Let's stop this thing,'' and the director was asking why.\n\n\"Because it's not going well.''\n\n\"Let's break and talk about it,'' the director suggested.\n\n\"We don't need a break,\" the other guy snapped back. \"What I want to know is what the writer thinks should be happening.\" He walked over to me, and as I squinted up through my headache he extended his hand and said, \"Hi. My name is Bruce Willis.\"\n\nHe was twenty-five, from Penns Grove, New Jersey, the oldest of four children who grew up in a blue-collar household. He had gone for a couple of years to Montclair State College and had appeared in two or three Off Off Broadway shows.\n\nOur meeting that day was the beginning of a four-and-a-half-year collaboration. Bullpen was then being produced by a group called Theatre for the Forgotten, a small company that toured plays in jails, drug-rehabilitation centers, and colleges. Shortly after Bruce was cast, the director was fired, and I took over. I soon discovered that Bruce could be very demanding. He questioned everything, and even when my answers satisfied him, he would proceed to act a scene differently from what we had agreed upon. But more often than not he would improve on the original concept.\n\nAlthough his tremendous presence and his comedic timing were evident from the beginning, he had trouble harnessing his fear of being onstage. He was a great rehearsal actor, but he would often shrink under the heat of actual performance lights. In front of an audience he was raw nerves, and it was difficult for him to remain focused on the action. He would often find a way to hide upstage. At times he could be very disappointing, but flashes of a unique talent always showed through, no matter how badly he screwed up. His problem was inconsistency, never lack of ability. When he cooked, he singed the floorboards.\n\nRecalling those days, he says, \"I knew when something worked, but I couldn't tell you exactly why. I was working on instinct and learning to trust myself.\"\n\nAs a company, we really roughed it. People talk about low-budget shows; this was a no-budget show. We all had to have other jobs in order to live. Bruce worked as a bartender, a waiter, and an attendant at several health clubs.\n\nWe rehearsed in a cold basement in a Harlem community center, and the neighborhood street heavies would come in and watch. Bruce was their great favorite. He was so believable strutting his stuff as a badass white boy in a black play that they'd comment out loud watching him. \"Whoo-o-o, that white boy is bad.\"\n\n\"Bullpen marked the time I got into what I call street acting,\" Bruce says. \"I was able to merge a character and my personality. It was a strong growing and learning process. I was expanding and finding out what I could do. I played that role ten different ways.\"\n\nHe smiles. \"Remember those crazy New York days, D? My first apartment was $170 a month, a fifth-floor walk-up. Some black-magic voodoo-type cat must have lived there. Everything in the kitchen was painted black, even the bathtub—all in black enamel with moons and crescents. There were so many cockroaches that I went down to Eleventh Avenue and stole about fifteen wood pallets, dragged them back up to my house, and laid them all over the apartment so that I would be about four inches off the floor and wouldn't have to walk on roaches.\" He lets out a big laugh. \"I found most of my furniture on the sidewalk. I had this old desk with no knobs, so I used bent nails in order to open and close the drawers. I lived there for six years. I would add things from time to time. I was satisfied. I didn't know any different. It met my needs.\"\n\nBruce and I loved to go out drinking. On a good night, we wouldn't just turn a bottle up to our lips, we'd turn the whole bar up. When it came to hanging out in the city, he was fearless. \"The only thing that mattered in those days was getting a gig as an actor,\" Bruce says. \"I lived a very unstructured life. I was like a jungle animal and only had to answer to myself. Hard living was my cross to bear if I wanted to be an actor. Acting was what I loved. My job was to party.\"\n\nSlam dancing was in then, and we were both physical types, so we often wound up late in punk-rock joints slamming bodies. We were wild and crazy in lots of ways. Once when I was loaded, I watched Bullpen from the wings. Bruce was great that night, and to show my appreciation, when he came offstage, I hugged him and bit him on the head.\n\nAccording to the press, he brought his wild ways west with him. Last May, things climaxed when he was booked for assaulting an officer who was responding to neighbors' complaints about a long, loud party at his house.\n\n\"What is all this shit about you being the bad boy of Hollywood?\" I ask him.\n\n\"Believe me, I never wanted to be,\" he says, \"but I had no preparation for what happened out here. There's no handbook. Fear was a big part of it. It was all happening too fast. I spoke with Robin Williams, who had a similar experience. He said, 'There are no rules. Just follow your heart.' When I got hit with that first wave of success, it was like I was sixteen with wealthy parents and I was given my first car. I did this town over, partied hard, and in many cases I wasn't the nicest guy in the world. But I wasn't the worst either. George Bernard Shaw said, 'Every human being is entitled to be an asshole for one year of his life.' \"\n\n\"Was the press justified?\" I ask. \"Were they just reporting what they saw?\"\n\n\"Some of it, but I think the larger part of this bad-boy thing started because I wouldn't respond to the media. I never chose to dignify something that was written about me without my permission. I never cried out, 'Oh, no, no, I'm not a bad boy.' I felt if I answered them it would open up a dialogue I didn't want to be a part of, because I felt it was none of their business. So they figured if I wasn't going to respond, they could have a field day. It became a one-sided conversation. Headline: BRUCE WILLIS PLAYS HIS MUSIC LOUD. Once that's in print, people read it and say, 'Bruce Willis always plays his music loud.' I didn't really understand the power the press had. In this business there is so much to learn and yet so little anyone can teach you; you have to go through it. You get defensive. The more bullshit you see written about you, the more you duck for cover when you see them coming. I don't mind talking to the press. I know they have a job to do. I've had some great things written about me and some true things that weren't so great, but they were true. I can accept that. I just want them to be standup dudes.\"\n\n\"Forgetting the press and the publicity, when did all the heavy hanging out come crashing down on you?\"\n\nAlmost before I can finish the question, his answer is ready, and he gives it to me right between the eyes. \"Memorial Day, the day the police crashed my crib. That experience changed everything. Living hard wasn't fun anymore.\"\n\nThe next day I go to the Twentieth Century Fox lot to visit Bruce in his trailer on the Moonlighting set. After a few minutes he's called to do a scene, and as he opens the door of the trailer I can hear the squeals of female fans. He's been doing this three and a half years, I think, and they're still screaming. Of course, Bruce was always extremely attractive to the ladies, and he's been involved with five times his share of them. Always, though, his natural inclination was to search for a solid relationship.\n\nHe was seriously in love with one woman when I knew him. The day after he felt they had really connected, he came into rehearsal wild with joy and yelled at the top of his lungs, \"I've met the one!\" After that, my wife and I double-dated with Bruce and her on occasion, and it was obvious that his feelings were very deep. He was warm and courteous and affectionate with her, and they behaved like a married couple. Shortly after they became engaged, her family raised objections to Bruce's choice of profession. They were afraid he would never amount to anything.\n\nHe came to me to talk about it, and I'd never seen him so upset. He said, \"D, I know in my heart that somehow I'm going to make it in this business. \" Then he asked, \"Do you think I'm going to make it?\"\n\n\"I know you've got the juice,\" I said. \"But who can tell whether you'll be the one the hand plucks out of the 29 zillion folks who want to make it as badly as you do?\"\n\nHe said he felt as if he were fighting time. He really cared for this woman, but he couldn't give up acting. That was the end of it, and he was heartbroken.\n\nWhen he comes back to the trailer, I remind him of that time. \"One of the big lessons I had to learn was how to love better,\" he says, \"how to be tender—a softer person. I never like myself more than when I'm with a woman, when I'm in a caring, loving relationship. I feel balanced and very centered. I have never felt that to a greater degree than with the love I feel for my wife. It's just an incredible high. It doesn't cost anything, and your head doesn't hurt in the morning.\"\n\nHe hasn't had a drink in months, and when I mention this he says, \"With the love and support of Demi and my friends, I honestly don't need it anymore.\"\n\nBruce met Demi Moore last year at a screening of Stakeout, which starred her former fiancé, Emilio Estevez. That same evening, in a Mexican restaurant, Demi tells me, \"he approached me and asked if he could buy me a drink. I told him, 'I don't drink.' \"\n\nLater they met up at the Improv. \"I'd heard that he was wild, a partyer, and probably a ladies' man. I was checking him out. Bruce has never been anything but open, honest, and available on all levels, emotional and physical. He's caring, interested in me and what I'm about, interested in what I'm thinking. I never met the person that I'd heard about.\"\n\nDemi moved to California when she was fourteen. Before that she had moved around a lot, owing to the fact that her father was a journalist. In L.A. she finally established roots and took up acting. In the early eighties she was married briefly to Freddy Moore, a rock musician. When she was eighteen she was cast in the role of Jackie Templeton on General Hospital, and gained national recognition. Three years later she left to make movies, including St. Elmo's Fire and About Last Night. She became part of the new generation of actors known as the Brat Pack.\n\nToday she seems calm and sure of herself. Her latest film, The Seventh Sign, was released last month. \"If Bruce were a nine-to-five salesman and you were a schoolteacher,\" I ask her, ''would your love and feelings still hold up?\"\n\n''If I were to write down all of the elements I wanted in a person, he is beyond anything I could have ever imagined. On a daily basis, it grows, and so much more is revealed. I have never felt the kind of love I have with him.\"\n\nBruce returns from the beach. Demi gets up and goes out to greet him. They share a few words which I can't hear, and then I see her express a physical act of endearment that I've witnessed several times in the course of my stay. She leaps into his arms, clasps her arms around his neck, and clamps her legs around his waist as they embrace.\n\n\"Let's talk music. Is music your soul?\" ask him. Last year Bruce made his first record, The Return of Bruno, and did a concert tour across the country.\n\n\"I've been playing the harmonica for a long time, for my personal satisfaction. I was flattered when Motown offered me the chance to do an album. But just playing music is its own reward. It wouldn't have mattered to me if the album had made ten cents.\" He laughs. \"I'm sure it would have mattered to Motown.\"\n\n\"How much business did it do?\" I ask.\n\n\"Platinum.\"\n\n\"Does this mean Springsteen has to watch out?\"\n\n\"No.\" He smiles. \"It may have been a case of the dancing chicken. Out of curiosity, everyone will pay once to see a chicken dance on a hot plate. But will they do it again?\"\n\n\"Only if the chicken can really dance,\" I say.\n\n\"Exactly. At the time of the album, I was doing four major projects, so I wasn't satisfied with the amount of time I had to devote to the record. If I were to do another one, I would want to give all my time to it.\"\n\n\"Do you think the critics were laying to ambush you?' '\n\n\"I think so,\" Bruce says. \"At the time, so much attention and praise were being heaped on me, I was due for a spanking. And in some instances they were right.\"\n\nI ask him why he thinks black people like Moonlighting so much.\n\n\"I don't know. I guess we share a groove together.\"\n\nI remember how, in New York, the cast used to psych themselves before a performance. We would all gather around Bruce. He would play some sweet blues, and we would all funk down together.\n\n\"I grew up around a lot of racism in South Jersey,\" he tells me. \"And to this day when you get around certain groups of white people, you still hear 'nigger this' and 'nigger that.' But you know, D,\" he continues in a challenging tone, \"that around certain groups of black people you also hear 'white this' and 'white motherfucker that.' I never felt that way, so I learned to judge people for who they were. I loved hanging out with you cats. It was an equal thing, like a code between us. The common denominator was that we were all poor. So those barriers didn't exist. If you were in that same groove, no matter what you were, you were of the same spirit.\"\n\nBlake Edwards, who directed Willis in Blind Date and Sunset, which is being released this month, says, \"In Blind Date he did pretty much the same thing he does in the TV show, only less. Playing the brash, cocky character of Tom Mix in Sunset was more difficult because of the nature of the film. I love Bruce's demons and his battles with them. I didn't feel that he bullshitted me at all. Right now he's at a dangerous point. He has to go into the gym and work at his craft—be a better actor in addition to being a movie star.\" Die Hard, Bruce's third movie, the one he got $5 million for, is scheduled to be released late this summer.\n\nFor years he was afflicted with a terrible stutter. He says that acting in high school and college helped him to overcome it. \"When I played another character, I lost my stutter. It was phenomenal.\" In college he got help from a therapist. \"I found that when I started to view myself as an individual and started to get in touch with my own self-worth, I learned how to stop beating myself up. It breaks my heart when I talk to someone who stutters, because, man, I see myself. I see that fourteen-year-old kid.\" He winces as the painful memory resurfaces. \"I could hardly talk. I couldn't make a sentence. It took three minutes to complete a sentence. It was crushing for an adolescent who wanted to express himself, who wanted to be heard, and couldn't. It was frightening.\"\n\nWe're back on the Moonlighting set, on a soundstage the size of a huge warehouse. There are about thirty-five crew members buzzing around setting things up. The set, a hospital room, covers only a small area, and the two stars, Bruce and Cybill Shepherd, seem doll-like standing in it. As they run lines, they crack jokes and help each other prepare.\n\nMaddie Hayes is telling David Addison that the child she is carrying is not his. Expecting to be rejected, she is surprised when David says yes, it is his child, because he loves her. He then puts her at ease by playfully telling her she has to eat her vegetables because she is eating for two. The scene is both funny and tender.\n\nWhen they finish, Bruce says to the director that he's not satisfied. He wants to shoot it again. He chats calmly with me about nothing in particular while the crew sets up a second time. Then he goes back and performs flawlessly.\n\nBruce Willis was two people when I first knew him. One was the wild, fear-filled, insecure actor who reacted poorly under pressure. The other was a sweet, loyal friend with traditional values, who was courtly with women and a great running buddy with other men. The responsibility it took to meet the demands of his success has created a third person, David Addison, one of the solid characters of eighties television—witty, debonair, tender, articulate.\n\nBruce was one of three thousand actors who auditioned for the part. After a stint in Sam Shepard's Fool for Love in New York in 1984, he had flown to L.A. to try out for a part in the film Desperately Seeking Susan. When he didn't get it, his agent said he might as well try out for Moonlighting, since everyone else was.\n\n\"Then it took seven weeks for ABC to make up their mind that they wanted me, even though the producers wanted me. ABC was totally freaked out by the fact that I didn't fit their standard model of what a leading man on a TV series should look like. I think everything happens for a reason. It was my time. Fortunately, I had enough craft so that I could rise to the occasion. Success happens when opportunity meets preparation. If you're prepared for it, you can get it.''\n\nAs we walk back to his trailer, he talks about the show. \"Moonlighting is a rare animal. It was a loving, caring collaboration. We took a little more time, we spent a little more money, than what the standard is. Our attitude has always been: Let's make it good, quality entertainment, and if it costs a little more money or it takes a little more time, why not break those rules? The industry was afraid that other shows might say, 'If Moonlighting is spending more time and more money, why can't we?' We incurred the wrath of the TV icons.\"\n\nI ask him about Cybill Shepherd. He says that when she was out having her twins the show's balance was off. \"She's very important to this show. We've been working together so long we have our communication down to a shorthand. She has a very difficult job playing straight man to all of David Addison's madness.\"\n\nWe're walking along the ocean in front of his house. Yesterday, while being photographed out here for Vanity Fair, he was spotted by media helicopters scanning the beach for stars, and had to evacuate the area. But today it's quiet.\n\nI've got a few last questions for him. Who are his close friends now?\n\n\"Michael J. Fox and D.J.\"\n\nI look quizzical, and he says matter-of-factly, \"Don Johnson.\"\n\n\"What do you do for thrills?\"\n\n\"Skiing. It's like living on the edge. Legal danger.\"\n\n\"What's left to achieve?\"\n\nHe gives a one-word response: \"Simplicity.\" He looks down and notices a tiny, oddly shaped seashell. \"Check this out, D,\" he says. He picks it up and flips it to me. \"Do you think my kid might like that?\""
