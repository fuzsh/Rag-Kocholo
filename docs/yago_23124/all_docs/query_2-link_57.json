        "text": "Caught up in a whirlwind romance, Demi Moore and Bruce Willis tied the knot back in 1987 just after four months of dating. However, it seems that was the very reason that led to their eventual split years later. Although the former couple have remained friends throughout the years after their split, things weren’t always so easy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBoth have recounted their own version of what exactly went wrong in their marriage. And in Demi Moore’s version, it seems that the real culprit was time or the lack thereof. She hinted that there was little to no time for them to really get to know each other before their wedding and the birth of their first daughter. As a result, she allegedly saw hints of cracks even in the first year of their marriage.\n\nAlso Read: “Demi isn’t stepping on her toes”: Demi Moore Moving in With Ex-husband Bruce Willis Amid His Concerning Medical Condition Does Not Bother Emma Heming Willis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis’ whirlwind romance\n\nDemi Moore and Bruce Willis allegedly met at a movie premiere in Los Angeles back in 1987. Although Willis immediately was ensnared by Moore’s charms, it took a lot of convincing for the actress to come to the same page. Especially as the Charlie’s Angels star was engaged to her then fiancé Emilio Estevez.\n\nIn fact, the actress even attended said premiere with him. As a result, Bruce Willis’ flirtatious behavior was not appreciated by her. Moore even mentioned that at first, she thought that the Die Hard star was, “kind of a jerk.”\n\nThat impression, however, only deteriorated when Willis asked her to write her phone number on his arm and even pulled up beside her car when they were returning home from the event. However, Bruce Willis was persistent and eventually won her over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis inevitably followed Demi Moore ending her engagement with Estevez to get into a relationship with Willis. Four months later the Looper star proposed to Moore, and they promptly got married in Las Vegas before holding a more formal ceremony in California a month later.\n\nAlso Read: “I still love Demi”: Bruce Willis Made Shocking Confession to Ex-Wife Demi Moore Despite Leaving Her for Emma Heming as Die Hard Star Struggles With Aphasia\n\nDemi Moore saw hints of cracks in their first year together\n\nAs if the chain of surprises wasn’t enough up until then, a whirlwind romance and a whirlwind wedding immediately followed a whirlwind family. Allegedly, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore’s first daughter, Rumer, was conceived on the couple’s honeymoon night. As a result, they did not really get the time to get to know each other to build a stable foundation for their relationship to thrive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd although things went well for a while, the couple eventually announced their separation in 1998. As Demi Moore mentioned in her memoir,\n\n“We had a whirlwind, truncated infatuation that morphed into a full-on family, all in our very first year. When reality set in, I don’t know if we really knew each other.”\n\nAnother thing that played a major part in their separation was living in Idaho where they moved to raise their children away from public scrutiny. However, this also caused them to have to constantly travel to LA for shootings and events, and they started seeing less and less of each other.\n\nThis not only made conflicts grow heavier between them but there were also rumors of Willis’ cheating during that time, although that remains to date unconfirmed. Following all this they finalized their divorce in 2000, but have remained good friends over the years. Strangely, though, it had been their kids who helped them build that bridge between them through their co-parenting duties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlso Read: Bruce Willis Had Regrets After Refusing to Work in a Romantic Movie With Wife Demi Moore: “How are you gonna have a romance?”\n\nMoore also noted in her memoir that Willis was allegedly afraid of being restricted from being able to see his kids. She noted, “I think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger … By obstructing his access to the kids. But I didn’t, and neither did he.”\n\nAnd this over the years helped them to understand each other and build a stronger friendship better. To the point where they even attended each other’s weddings.\n\nAdvertisement"
