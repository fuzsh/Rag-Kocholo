        "text": "In the show, celebrities compete to survive in a Mars-like simulation in Australia.\n\nWhen her competitor Ronda Rousey asked what it was like growing up with famous parents, the actor and entrepreneur was brutally honest.\n\n\"I grew up in Idaho. And I knew my parents had this job that made them this thing, and we got to do cool stuff, but I didn't fully understand,\" Tallulah said.\n\nShe said that it wasn't until her mother started dating Ashton Kutcher in 2003 that things became real.\n\n\"It was that moment, a lot going on, and I really went inside of myself, and that did send me into like a total dumpster fire. It was really hard, and I'm still unpacking,\" she said.\n\nTallulah said the silver lining was the bond she formed with her older sisters, Rumer Willis, 34, and Scout Willis, 31.\n\n\"I found the other side of that, which is like I really love myself now, and I love my family,\" she continued.\n\nTallulah was 11 when Moore, then 42, married Kutcher, then 27, in September 2005.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe two split after six years of marriage in 2011 and finalized their divorce in 2013.\n\nThe Willises are close with their father, Bruce, who announced he was stepping away from acting because of his aphasia diagnosis in March 2022. Bruce married the model Emma Heming in 2009, and the couple share two daughters, Mabel, 11, and Evelyn, 9.\n\nTallulah has talked openly about her struggles with anorexia nervosa and body dysmorphia, which she said were exacerbated by her parents' time in the spotlight.\n\nIn an essay in Vogue, she described a formative experience when photos of her at age 11 at an event with Moore and Kutcher were met online with a trove of negative comments about her body and appearance.\n\n\"I wanted to see if my outfit had made the party pages of any of the style websites,\" she wrote. \"Then I found my way to the comments, hundreds of them, the words just burning off the screen.\"\n\nCorrection: June 7, 2023: An earlier version of this story misstated the ages Tallulah, Moore, and Kutcher were when Moore and Kutcher wed. They were 11, 42, and 27, respectively, not 8, 40, and 25."
