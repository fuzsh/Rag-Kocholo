However, their nuptials were called off shortly before their December 1986 wedding date.\n\nMoore and Estevez remained on good terms and even attended the premiere of his movie \"Stakeout\" together in 1987. At the event, she was introduced to Bruce Willis, who'd appeared in his first leading movie role in \"Blind Date\" earlier that year.\n\nWillis, then 32, and Moore, then 24, began dating shortly after meeting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNovember 1987: Willis and Moore married in an impromptu Las Vegas ceremony.\n\n\"We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married.' We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding,\" Moore wrote in her 2019 memoir, \"Inside Out.\"\n\nWillis and Moore were married inside their suite at the Golden Nugget Hotel, with only a few guests. A month later, they had a ceremony, officiated by Little Richard, with all of their family and friends.\n\nIt was Willis' first marriage, while Moore was previously married to singer Freddie Moore for five years before splitting in 1985.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAugust 16, 1988: The couple welcomed their first child, Rumer Willis.\n\nMoore has said she conceived Rumer on the couple's wedding night, ET Online reported.\n\nRumer Willis, named after the British writer Rumer Godden, was born on August 16, 1988, in Paducah, Kentucky. Willis was shooting a movie called \"In Country\" in the nearby Jackson Purchase area.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1991-1994: They later welcomed two more daughters, Scout and Tallulah.\n\nWillis, 67, is now the father of five daughters.\n\nHe shares Rumer Glenn Willis, 34, Scout LaRue Willis, 31, and Tallulah Belle Willis, 29, with Moore, 60, and two more daughters — Mabel Ray Willis, 10, and Evelyn Penn Willis, 8 — with his second wife, Emma Heming, 44.\n\n\"Bruce's response when asked if he'd like to have a son?… 'I'd have 5 more girls right now,'\" Heming shared on Instagram in June 2021.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune 1998: Bruce Willis and Demi Moore announced their separation.\n\n\"Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have announced they are ending their marriage after 11 years,\" a spokesperson for the couple shared in a statement at the time.\n\nTheir marriage was later dissolved due to \"irreconcilable differences.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2000: Two years after their separation, Willis and Moore's divorce was finalized. However, the pair remained close friends.\n\nAfter their split was finalized, Moore and Willis continued to co-parent their three children.\n\n\"I still love Demi. We're very close,\" the \"Die Hard\" actor told Rolling Stone in 2000. \"We have three children whom we will continue to raise together, and we're probably as close now as we ever were.\"\n\n\"We realize we have a lifelong commitment to our kids,\" Willis continued. \"Our friendship continues. The institution has been set aside … It's difficult to live your life and marriage under a magnifying glass, which is what happens to movie star couples.\"\n\nSpeaking to Harper's Bazaar in 2008, Moore said, \"I'm the product of divorced parents, and my brother and I were the pawns in my parents' game. I never wanted that for my kids. At that time, I could not have seen what a gift that situation was, but without that experience, I would not have known there was a different choice to make in my own divorce.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeptember 24, 2005: Demi Moore married Ashton Kutcher at their home, with Willis in attendance.\n\nMoore, then 42, and Kutcher, then 27, were married in a Kabbalah ceremony at their Beverly Hills home in front of over 100 guests, according to People.\n\nKutcher and Moore first met at a dinner in New York City in 2003, and Kutcher soon became integrated into the lives of Moore's and Willis' three children.\n\n\"When Ashton came into our lives, he was just an extension of our family. He's like a friend as well as a stepdad,\" Rumer told the Daily Mail in 2009. \"We talk about everything — auditions, boyfriends, family. He understands more than my parents sometimes because he's closer to my age.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 21, 2009: Willis married model Emma Heming. Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher attended the wedding.\n\n\"I'm so thankful and grateful that my parents made such an effort at that time,\" Rumer told Larry King in March 2015, years after both her parents had remarried.\n\n\"They always made an effort to do all of the family events still together and made such an effort to still have our family be as one unit, as opposed to two separate things, which I think really made an impact,\" she continued.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2011: Kutcher and Moore separated. They would officially divorce two years later.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,\" Moore said in a statement.\n\n\"As a woman, a mother, and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life,\" she continued. \"This is a trying time for me and my family, and so I would ask for the same compassion and privacy that you would give to anyone going through a similar situation.\"\n\nIn a January 2023 interview with Esquire, Kutcher described feeling like a \"failure\" after his marriage to Moore ended. He went on to date his former \"That '70s Show\" costar Mila Kunis. They married in 2015 and now share two children.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJuly 14, 2018: Moore was a guest of honor at Willis' \"Comedy Central Roast.\"\n\nWillis' wife, Emma Heming, his and Moore's three daughters Rumer, Tallulah, and Scout, and Willis' mother, Marlene Willis, were all in the audience as Moore took to the stage to roast the actor.\n\n\"I look at our marriage like 'The Sixth Sense,'\" Moore said, according to Deadline. \"You were dead the whole time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 2020: Willis and Moore began isolating themselves together with their kids in Idaho during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nWillis, Moore, their children, and their children's partners all posted photos of fun family activities together, from wearing matching pajamas to scrapbooking and musical jam sessions.\n\nHeming and their daughters isolated separately after their youngest accidentally poked herself with a hypodermic needle at a park in Los Angeles and needed medical tests, so they were initially unable to travel to Idaho to join the rest of the family.\n\n\"It's been really fun having both my parents at the house where they, like, raised us,\" Scout Willis told Us Weekly in April 2020. \"It's kind of divine time to just hang out with them. … I'm very grateful to be with my family.\"\n\nThe entire family reunited in May 2020 to celebrate Heming and Willis' youngest daughter Evelyn's 6th birthday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarch 30, 2022: Members of Willis' family, including Moore, announced on Instagram that he would be stepping away from his acting career after an aphasia diagnosis.\n\nAphasia is a condition that causes loss of speech and can make writing and understanding language difficult as well, according to the Mayo Clinic. It typically occurs after a stroke or other brain injury and affects over 2 million Americans of all ages.\n\n\"We wanted to share that our beloved Bruce has been experiencing some health issues and has recently been diagnosed with aphasia, which is impacting his cognitive abilities,\" Rumer Willis said in a post on her account. \"As a result of this and with much consideration Bruce is stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\"\n\n\"As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that,\" the statement concluded.\n\nThe post was signed by the entire family: Heming and their two daughters, and Moore and their three daughters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFebruary 2023: Moore and the extended Willis family share that Bruce has been diagnosed with frontotemporal dementia.\n\nThe family shared an update on Willis' condition on The Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration's website. Willis himself has not made any public statements concerning his health.\n\n\"Bruce's condition has progressed and we now have a more specific diagnosis: frontotemporal dementia (known as FTD). Unfortunately, challenges with communication are just one symptom of the disease Bruce faces,\" read the family's statement, signed by Heming, Moore, and his five children.\n\n\"Bruce always believed in using his voice in the world to help others, and to raise awareness about important issues both publicly and privately,\" the statement continued. \"We know in our hearts that – if he could today — he would want to respond by bringing global attention and a connectedness with those who are also dealing with this debilitating disease and how it impacts so many individuals and their families.\"\n\nRead next\n\nCelebrity Couples\n\nAdvertisement"
