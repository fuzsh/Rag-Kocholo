        "text": "Before Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie and George and Amal Clooney, Bruce Willis and Demi Moore were Hollywood's golden couple.\n\nHe was an action hero and she was a movie star, and together they were fire. But just like that, their flame burned out and they called it quits in 1998 after 11 years of marriage.\n\nUnlike many celebrity couples Willis, 67, and Moore, 59, remained good friends for the sake of their three daughters.\n\nOn Wednesday, Willis' family announced that the Die Hard actor was \"stepping away from the career that has meant so much to him.\"\n\nThe caption on her post continued, \"We are moving through this as a strong family unit, and wanted to bring his fans in because we know how much he means to you, as you do to him. As Bruce always says, 'Live it up' and together we plan to do just that.\"\n\nThe heartfelt post was signed off by Willis' wife Emma Heming, Moore, and the daughters they share with the actor respectively.\n\nHere's a look back at Moore and Willis' relationship, from how he wooed the actress to her very candid tell-all memoir...\n\nREAD MORE: Celebrities send love to Bruce Willis as star steps down from Hollywood\n\nJuly 1987: Just like many other Hollywood couples, Willis and Moore meet at a movie screening in LA. The actress accompanies her then-fiancé, Emilio Estevez, to the premiere of his film, Stakeout, and Willis is among the guests at the event.\n\n\"My impression was, he's kind of a jerk… but Bruce was so gallant — in his own boisterous way, a real gentleman,\" Moore reveals years later in her memoir, Inside Out.\n\nIn the tell-all, Moore remembers attending an afterparty with Willis that same night, where he requests she write her phone number on his arm. Later, when she drives home, the actor and his entourage pull up beside her car on a highway.\n\n\"It was a stretch limousine in the next lane, with Bruce Willis and his buddies poking up through the open sunroof, waving and shouting, 'Hey, Demi!'\" she writes. \"It was like the universe was telling me: pay attention to this one.\"\n\nMoore and Estevez, her co-star in St. Elmo's Fire, split soon after.\n\nREAD MORE: Bruce Willis' wife Emma Heming shared beautiful tribute to actor days before revealing his health battle\n\nNovember 1987: The actress embarks on a relationship with Willis, who sweeps her off her feet, wining and dining her and taking her around on a private jet.\n\nDuring one impromptu visit to Las Vegas, Willis proposes and Moore says 'yes'. After a whirlwind four months of dating, the couple marry inside their suite at the Golden Nugget hotel, with only a handful of guests in attendance.\n\n\"We were moving to the gambling tables when Bruce said, 'I think we should get married.' We'd been joking about it on the flight there, but suddenly it didn't seem like he was kidding,\" she writes.\n\nOne month after their Vegas wedding, the couple have another ceremony, this time it is a lavish affair in front of their famous friends in LA. Singer Little Richard, an ordained minister, marries the couple.\n\nThis is Willis' first marriage — Moore was married to singer Freddie Moore for five years before their 1985 split, but she held on to his surname.\n\nThe actress reportedly falls pregnant with her and Willis' first child, Rumer, on their wedding night.\n\n\"We had a whirlwind, truncated infatuation that morphed into a full-on family, all in our very first year,\" Moore recalls in her memoir. \"When reality set in, I don't know if we really knew each other.\"\n\n1990s: Following Rumer's birth in August 1988, the couple move to rural Idaho to raise their family away from the glare of Hollywood. They later welcome two more daughters, Scout in 1991 and Tallulah in 1994.\n\nDuring this period, Willis and Moore juggle parenthood and their careers, regularly travelling to Hollywood from Idaho during filming.\n\nIn her memoir, Moore reveals that their busy schedules took a heavy toll on their marriage. But they forge on and become Hollywood's golden couple.\n\nBoth are at the height of their careers — Willis stars in a slew of films such as Twelve Monkeys, Pulp Fiction and two more Die Hard movies, meanwhile Moore brings in the big bucks with Ghost, Indecent Proposal and A Few Good Men.\n\nRumours begin to circulate that the couple are on the brink of divorce, with their busy schedules to blame. In 1993, two years after a pregnant Moore posed nude on the cover of Vanity Fair, she fatefully tells the magazine that \"[the rumours] won't stop until one day they may be right\".\n\nIt isn't until Moore's 2019 memoir that she confirms the rumours were true. The actress writes about Willis preferring that she stay home with the kids, saying of their marriage, \"This is never going to work if you're off shooting a film.\"\n\n\"I experienced the most conventional family dynamic I'd ever known in those years,\" she shares in her tell-all.\n\n1996: Cheating allegations surround their marriage, and more eyebrows are raised when Willis shares his thoughts on monogamy in an interview with Playboy in 1996.\n\n\"No woman is going to satisfy a man's natural impulse to procreate, procreate, procreate. The impulse doesn't go away because you have three or 10 or a hundred kids,\" he tells the magazine.\n\n\"We try hard, but we're animals. We're just donkeys walking up to the trough for food and wanting to f--- everything we see because of this unconscious agenda.\"\n\nMoore later explains that Willis \"craved excitement and novelty. Basically he wanted to do whatever the f--- he wanted. He was 36, throw in celebrity and money. You do the math.\"\n\n1998: In June 1998, the couple release a statement and go their separate ways.\n\n\"Bruce Willis and Demi Moore have announced they are ending their marriage after 11 years. They were married on November 21, 1987,\" writes Paul Bloch, a spokesman for the actor.\n\nAccording to reports, the couple have been living apart for months due to conflicting film schedules. After the announcement, Moore retreats from the spotlight to focus on raising their daughters. The couple's divorce is finalised in 2000.\n\n\"It's a funny thing to say, but I'm very proud of our divorce,\" she later reveals. \"I think Bruce was fearful at the beginning that I was going to make our split difficult, and that I would express my anger and whatever baggage that I had from our marriage by obstructing his access to the kids — that I'd turn to all of those ploys divorcing couples use as weapons. But I didn't, and neither did he.\"\n\n2003: Moore returns to the spotlight to make a cameo in Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, her first appearance in a feature film in five years. She is now 41 years old and is the fittest she has been in her life, yet movie roles are far and few.\n\n\"They'd say they don't really know what to do with you, where to place you,\" she says. \"I was like, oh, well is that supposed to flatter me?\"\n\nNevertheless, her career experiences a resurgence of sorts and Moore is once again in demand. Around the same time, she finds love again with That '70s Show star Ashton Kutcher, the pair meeting at a play in New York.\n\nThe actor is 25 years old but the 16-year age gap does not faze the couple, who publicly debut their relationship at the premiere of Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle.\n\n2005: After two years of dating, Moore and Kutcher marry in a private ceremony at their home in Beverly Hills on September 25. Only 100 of the couple's nearest and dearest are invited to the event, including stars Wilmer Valderrama and Lucy Liu. Willis also attends the event.\n\nThe actress later refers to her relationship with her new husband as \"a do-over\" of her twenties.\n\n\"Like I could just go back in time and experience what it was like to be young, with him — much more so than I'd ever been able to experience it when I was actually in my twenties,\" she reveals.\n\n2009: Willis marries model Emma Heming, who is 23 years younger, in an intimate ceremony in Turks & Caicos on March 21. The newlyweds met through friends many years ago and dated for more than one year before tying the knot.\n\nThe private affair — which Moore attends with Kutcher — is held at Willis' Parrot Cay estate overlooking the Caribbean.\n\n\"It was a tough time for me during those years after the break-up,\" the actor tells W Magazine of his divorce in July. \"I went from 'F--- love' to 'Love is truly the answer.'\n\n\"I spent the last 10 years single and, for the most part, unhappy. In a dark place. I never thought that being with someone else was the answer. I would say, 'I'm alone, but I'm not lonely.' But I was just kidding myself. Then I started hanging around Emma, and on a day-to-day basis my life became much happier.\"\n\n2011: Moore and Kutcher announce their separation after six years of marriage.\n\n\"It is with great sadness and a heavy heart that I have decided to end my six-year marriage to Ashton,\" Moore writes in a statement. \"As a woman, a mother, and a wife there are certain values and vows that I hold sacred, and it is in this spirit that I have chosen to move forward with my life.\"\n\nReports suggest the couple — who finalise their divorce in 2013 — split due to Kutcher's alleged infidelity.\n\nThey never had children during their time together, but Moore later reveals that they miscarried six months into their first pregnancy, just before their 2005 wedding. She says they were going to have a daughter and her name was to be Chaplin Ray.\n\n2015: Moore and Willis continue to co-parent their daughters since their divorce, with their eldest child, Rumer, praising their efforts.\n\n\"I never had to split up vacations or split up birthdays,\" Rumer reveals on Larry King Now. \"They always made an effort to do all of the family events still together and made such an effort to still have our family be as one unit, as opposed to two separate things, which I think really made an impact.\"\n\nThey remain one big happy family, and when Willis welcomes children with new wife Heming — daughters Mabel, eight, and Evelyn, five — Rumer is the first to embrace her half-siblings.\n\n\"The four most important beings on this planet and in any year from now to eternity,\" she gushes of her sisters on Instagram. \"Thank you for making everyday better. For the tears, the belly hurting laughter, the inside jokes, cuddles, Netflix binges, secret language, surprise sleepovers, pushing me to grow, sharing clothes and for all that is to come. You are my best friends for life.\"\n\n2018: The Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis airs on TV and Moore is one of the stars to playfully throw shade at the actor.\n\nTaking to the stage to roast her ex, Moore proves that they've both come a long way since their divorce, and are now able to laugh about their failed marriage.\n\n\"For those of you that don't know me, I am Demi Moore. I was married to Bruce for the first three Die Hard movies, which makes sense because the last two sucked,\" she tells the audience as the actor sits nearby.\n\nLater, she makes another dig, saying, \"I look at our marriage like The Sixth Sense. You were dead the whole time.\"\n\nMarch 2019: Willis renews his vows with Heming at his Parrot Cay home in Turks & Caicos, the same place they married 10 years ago.\n\n\"We said, we do, again, 10 years later,\" Heming writes on Instagram while sharing a photo of their big day.\n\nMoore attends the wedding and features in a happy family portrait eldest daughter Rumer shares on Instagram.\n\n\"Papa and Stepmama got married again 10 years later!!! So happy I was able to be here and celebrate with the crew. I love you both so much,\" Rumer captions the photo.\n\nSeptember, 2019: Moore releases her memoir, Inside Out, in which she confesses she was once not a great mother or wife. While she is in a better place now with her daughters, she writes that it was a long road to rebuilding their relationships.\n\nMoore also details her substance abuse issues and breakups with both Willis and Kutcher. The Die Hard star supports his ex's book and even attends the launch in LA with Heming. Willis also calls Moore personally to tell her he is 'proud' of her memoir.\n\n\"I was getting ready to do Jimmy Fallon Live the other night, and I was in the dressing room and my phone rang, and it was Bruce,\" she reveals in a Netflix podcast while promoting the book. \"I was prepared for there, maybe, to be some sensitivities, and he called and he got very emotional. He said, 'I'm so proud of you.'\"\n\nKutcher, however, was not so pleased that Moore shared details of their marriage in the book, where she brought forth allegations of threesomes and infidelity.\n\n\"Because we had brought in a third party into our relationship, Ashton said, that blurred the lines and, to some extent, justified what he's done,\" Moore writes of his alleged cheating.\n\nAfter hearing of the contents of the book, Kutcher tweets, \"I was about to push the button on a really snarky tweet. Then I saw my son, daughter, and wife and I deleted it.\"\n\nThe actor is now married to That '70s Show co-star Mila Kunis and together they share two children, Wyatt, five, and Dimitri, three.\n\nApril 8, 2020: Twenty years on from their divorce, Moore and Willis quarantine together with their daughters in LA as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps the globe. Tallulah and Scout's boyfriends are also in lockdown with the family in LA.\n\nSurprisingly, Willis' second wife, Heming, and their daughters are in isolation at another residence, causing many to wonder if the famous exes have reconciled. But Heming — who in March celebrated her 11th wedding anniversary with Willis — quashes the rumours on Instagram.\n\n\"[Family bonding] at its finest, love and miss you guys,\" she comments on the photo Moore posts.\n\nApril 14, 2020: The famous exes continue to quarantine together at Moore's LA house, with the actress posting yet another fun photo of them huddled for a group reading session of Laura Day's self-help book, How to Rule the World from Your Couch.\n\n\"Family book club... ⁣How to Rule the World from Your Couch — quarantine edition,\" Moore captioned the pic.\n\nIt's all love here in the extended Willis clan!\n\nJune 18, 2020: Heming celebrates her 42nd birthday with both Willis and Moore.\n\n\"It really was a happy birthday for me,\" Heming captions a slideshow of photos from their family picnic with her two daughters Mabel and Evelyn as well as Moore and Willis' daughter Rumer.\n\nJune 21, 2020: On Father's Day in the US, Moore showers Willis with love. \"Happy Father's Day, Bruce! Your kids are so lucky to have you,\" she captions a photo of their blended family and their close friends celebrating the occasion.\n\nMarch 30, 2022: Moore, Heming and the children they each share with Willis, release a statement announcing Willis' health and subsequent retirement."
