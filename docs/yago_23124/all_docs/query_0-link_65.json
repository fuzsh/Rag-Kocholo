Just before he left, he dropped the bombshell: ‘I don’t know if I want to be married.”\n\nDespite the pain of their separation, both former couples managed to forge an extraordinary friendship and maintain a positive co-parenting relationship. They continued to support each other as they moved on to new relationships, showcasing a remarkable level of maturity and mutual respect.\n\nSource: Cheatsheet"
