        "text": "Demi Moore offered a positive update on her ex-husband Bruce Willis‘ battle with dementia.\n\nWhile appearing on this morning’s broadcast of Good Morning America to promote Hulu‘s Feud: Capote Vs. The Swans, the actress said, “I think, given the givens, he’s doing very well.”\n\nShe continued, “What I’ll say is what I say to my children, which is it’s important to just meet them where they’re at and not hold onto what isn’t. Because there’s great beauty and sweetness and loving and joy out of that.”\n\nThe Ghost star made similar remarks on Andy Cohen‘s Sirius XM radio show, Radio Andy, after the Bravo boss asked what advice she would give to families dealing with dementia.\n\n“When you let go of who they’ve been or who you think they [should be], or who even you would like them to be, you can then really stay in the present and take in the joy and the love that is present and there for all that they are, not all that they’re not,” she said, per the New York Post.\n\nMoore and Willis, who were married for 13 years before they divorced in 2000, share daughters Rumer, Scout and Tallulah. Since their split more than two decades ago, Moore has remained tight-knit with the Die Hard actor, who is now married to Emma Heming.\n\nWillis announced that he was retiring from Hollywood in 2022 after he was initially diagnosed with aphasia. The following year, his family revealed that his condition had turned into frontotemporal dementia (FTD), which they described at the time as the “most common form of dementia” for people under 60.\n\nShortly after it was revealed that Willis had been “rendered incommunicative,” Tallulah opened up about her father’s diagnosis on The Drew Barrymore Show.\n\n“He is the same, which I think in this regard I’ve learned is the best thing that you can ask for,” she told host Drew Barrymore back in November 2023. “What I see is, I see love when I’m with him. He’s my dad and he loves me, which is really special.”\n\nAs for why the family is “so open” about his health battle, Tallulah said it’s “really important” for them to spread awareness about FTD, adding, “If we can take something that we’re struggling with as a family and individually to help other people, to turn it around, to make something beautiful about it, that’s really special for us.”"
