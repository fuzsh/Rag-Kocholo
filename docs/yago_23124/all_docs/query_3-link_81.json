        "text": "Background\n\nDemi Moore was born in Roswell, New Mexico, on November 11, 1962, to parents Virginia and Charles Harmon, though the relationship ended before Moore was even born. Her childhood was riddled with struggles, from her mother and stepfather’s alcoholism to being moved around for most of her early life, moving over 20 times before the star was 16 years old. The troubles she had at home led her down a dark path, and the actress left home when she was 16, hoping to forge a better future for herself. She became a pin-up girl to make money and unfortunately dropped out of school so that she could make ends meet.\n\nIt was in 1980, when Moore was just 18 years old, that she met and married Freddy Moore. Demi had never expressed a desire to become an actress, but a big break in 1981 led her to work in the entertainment industry. She was cast in the movie “Choices” at 19 as a minor character. Though she was only playing a minor role in this low-budget movie, it played an important part in catapulting her into many more roles. Just a year later, in 1982, she was cast in “Parasite” as one of the lead characters. Moore’s career skyrocketed from here, earning many roles in movies over the next few years. In 1985 she sadly divorced her husband Freddy Moore, though in 1987 she married fellow actor Bruce Willis, and they had three children. The couple was married until 2000 when they were divorced. In 1990, she starred in one of her biggest movies, “Ghost,” which did wonders for her career, further cementing her name in Hollywood.\n\nThe years to come would be extremely successful for the talented actress, with her starring in many movies. In 2005, she married fellow actor Ashton Kutcher, though they were divorced a mere six years later, in 2011. Moore has had an extremely successful career and we just love to see her on the big screen. We can only hope that we will see a movie with her in it soon."
