        "text": "Jonas Brothers star Joe Jonas and actress Demi Moore have been spotted dining together in France, sparking speculation over whether the pair were romantically involved.\n\nHowever reports have since claimed that there was “no romance brewing” between the duo, as Jonas was focused on his career, children, and divorce while Moore was looking to settle down with someone outside the entertainment industry.\n\nWATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE: Joe Jonas addresses Sophie Turner split.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\n“She’s learned her lesson about dating men much younger than her,” an insider told In Touch referring to her marriage to ex-husband Ashton Kutcher.\n\nMoore was said to find “Joe attractive, (but) that’s all.\n\n“But then again, you can never predict anything when it comes to Demi,” the insider added.\n\nJonas, 34, and Moore, 61, were seen having lunch together at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in Antibes, a town in the South of France, on Tuesday in a photograph published by Page Six.\n\nMoore wore a black and white top with a grey cardigan, paired with her signature aviators and held on to her puppy Pilaf.\n\nMeanwhile, Jonas was all smiles in a neutral linen shirt, white pants and glasses.\n\nThe source told InTouch the actress was “being very selective” about dating and is “totally closed off to dating someone else in the industry”.\n\n“She wants to find love and settle down eventually, but she wants it to be with someone outside of the business because, in her view, there’s just not room in a relationship for two stars,” they said.\n\nMeanwhile another insider told US Weekly: “Joe has a very busy schedule between his kids and his career, so his romantic life has to take a back seat for now.”\n\nJonas recently split from model Stormi Bree who first sparked dating rumours when she joined Jonas and his brothers Kevin and Nick Jonas on the Australian leg of their tour in March.\n\nThey dated for five months after Jonas split from ex-wife Sophie Turner in September 2023.\n\nTurner and Jonas, who married in 2019, have two daughters, Willa and Delphine.\n\nThey publicly announced their split via Instagram, saying they had decided to “amicably end” their marriage.\n\nHowever, in the weeks after the announcement, rumours emerged that Turner had been struggling after the birth of their second child and Jonas had been “less than supportive”.\n\nSources close to the couple said the “strain in the relationship” was clear to those around them."
