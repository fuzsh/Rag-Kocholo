        "text": "The Unit Circle\n\nWritten by tutor ShuJen W.\n\nThe above drawing is the graph of the Unit Circle on the X – Y Coordinate Axis.\n\nIt can be seen from the graph, that the Unit Circle is defined as having a Radius ( r ) = 1.\n\nGoing from Quadrant I to Quadrant IV, counter clockwise, the Coordinate points on the axis of the Unit Circle are:\n\n(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), and (0, -1)\n\nThis is important to remember when we define the X and Y Coordinates around the Unit Circle. The Unit Circle has 360°. In the above graph, the Unit Circle is divided into 4 Quadrants that split the Unit Circle into 4 equal pieces. Each piece is exactly 90°.\n\nQuestion: Why is each section / Quadrant equal to 90°?\n\nAlso it can be shown that the Unit Circle is made up of four 90° angles, which total 360°:\n\nNow we are going to divide the Unit Circle into 30°, 45°, and 60° angles. These are the special angles and are very important to remember.\n\nLet’s start with Quadrant I, since this is the basics, and the X and Y Coordinates are both Positive. See below.\n\nWe then move on to Quadrant II, which starts at 90° and goes to 180°. From the diagram below, each angle in Quadrant II measures 30°, 45°, and 60° within that Quadrant. However, since the angles have a point of reference at the 0° mark in Quadrant I, they are labeled according to the angle they make from Quadrant I to Quadrant II. For example, 45° in Quadrant II is labeled 135° because that is the angle it makes from 0° in Quadrant I to the 45° angle in Quadrant II. Also, it can be seen from the graph that the 45° angle in Quadrant II falls between 90° and 180° on the Unit Circle. This is done for 30°, 45°, and 60° angles in each Quadrant. See below.\n\nThe graph below shows the degrees of the Unit Circle in all 4 Quadrants, from 0° to 360°.\n\nNow we will add Radians to the Unit Circle. Radians is the standard unit of angle measure.\n\nThe Formula for calculating Radians is:\n\nWe will calculate the Radians for each degree on the Unit Circle labeled above.\n\nDegrees Formula Radians (simplified) 0° (0°)*(π/180°) 0 30° (30°)*(π/180°) = 30π/180° radians π/6 45° (45°)*(π/180°) = 45π/180° radians π/4 60° (60°)*(π/180°) = 60π/180° radians π/3 90° (90°)*(π/180°) = 90π/180° radians π/2 120° (120°)*(π/180°) = 120π/180° radians 2π/3 135° (135°)*(π/180°) = 135π/180° radians 3π/4 150° (150°)*(π/180°) = 150π/180° radians 5π/6 180° (180°)*(π/180°) = 180π/180° radians π/1 210° (210°)*(π/180°) = 210π/180° radians 7π/6 225° (225°)*(π/180°) = 225π/180° radians 5π/4 240° (240°)*(π/180°) = 240π/180° radians 4π/3 270° (270°)*(π/180°) = 270π/180° radians 3π/2 300° (300°)*(π/180°) = 300π/180° radians 5π/3 315° (315°)*(π/180°) = 315π/180° radians 7π/4 330° (330°)*(π/180°) = 330π/180° radians 11π/6 360° (360°)*(π/180°) = 360π/180° radians 2π/1\n\nThe graph below shows radian measure in all 4 Quadrants with their corresponding angles. This article explains an easy way to memorize points on the unit circle.\n\nNext, we will define the X and Y Coordinate points on the Unit Circle. In order to do this, we need to understand the relationship of the Special Right Triangles 30 – 60 – 90 and 45 – 45 – 90 degrees to the coordinate plane. These Right Triangles are very important to remember because they have certain properties that come in handy when solving Trigonometric functions.\n\nBelow shows the 30-60-90 and 45-45-90 degree Right Triangles in Quadrant I.\n\nThese triangles can also be represented in the other 3 Quadrants, except that X and Y may change sign depending on the Quadrant. For example, the below graph shows the 45-45-90 degree Right Triangle in all 4 Quadrants. Notice that the angles of the triangles are still 45° regardless of which Quadrant they are in, but the X and Y coordinates change sign. For example, notice that Quadrant III, both X and Y is negative. Also notice that r = Radius of the Circle = Hypotenuse of the Triangle. This information is used to solve for the X and Y coordinates on the Unit Circle.\n\nWhen solving for X, Y, or r in a 90° triangle, we can use the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nX2 + Y2 = r2 (Pythagorean Theorem)\n\nTo the right, the Pythagorean Theorem is used to solve for the radius of the 45° angle.\n\nSo, for the 45° angle, we have X = 1, Y = 1, and r = √2\n\nAlso, X and Y in terms of radius and angle can be written as:\n\nX = r*cosΘ and Y = r*sinΘ\n\nIf r and Θ are given, then the X coordinate can be found.\n\nNext we will define the Trigonometric Functions:\n\ncosΘ° = X/r = Adjacent/Hypotenuse sinΘ° = Y/r = Opposite/Hypotenuse tanΘ° = Y/X = Opposite/Adjacent secΘ° = r/X = Hypotenuse/Adjacent cscΘ° = r/Y = Hypotenuse/Opposite cotΘ° = X/Y = Adjacent/Opposite\n\nLet’s solve Trigonometric Functions for the 45-45-90 Degree triangle and define the X – Y Coordinates:\n\ncosΘ° = X/r sinΘ° = Y/r tanΘ° = Y/X cos45° = 1/√2 = √2/2 sin45° = 1/√2 = √2/2 tan45° = Y/X = 1/1 = 1\n\nAfter solving for cos45° and sin45°, let’s define the X and Y coordinate points for the Unit Circle.\n\nSince X = r*cosΘ, Y = r*sinΘ, and r = 1\n\nFor Θ = 45°, we have X = 1*cos45° = √2/2 and Y = 1*sin45° = √2/2\n\nBelow is the graph of the X and Y Coordinates for the 45° angle:\n\nLet’s solve Trigonometric Functions for the 30-60-90 Degree triangle and define the X – Y Coordinates:\n\ncosΘ° = X/r sinΘ° = Y/r tanΘ° = Y/X cos30° = √3/2 sin30° = 1/2 tan30° = 1/√3 = √3/3 cos60° = 1/2 sin60° = √3/2 tan60° = √3/1\n\nBelow are the graphs of the X and Y Coordinates for the 30° and 60° angles:\n\nThe table below shows the X,Y coordinate points associated with the degrees on the Unit Circle.\n\nDegrees = Θ (X,Y) coordinate Degrees = Θ (X,Y) coordinate 0° (1, 0) 210° (-√3/2, –1/2) 30° (√3/2, 1/2) 225° (-√2/2, –√2/2) 45° (√2/2, √2/2) 240° (-1/2, –√3/2) 60° (1/2, √3/2) 270° (0, -1) 90° (0, 1) 300° (1/2, –√3/2) 120° (-1/2, √3/2) 315° (-√2/2, –√2/2) 135° (-√2/2, √2/2) 330° (√3/2, –1/2) 150° (-√3/2, 1/2) 360° (1, 0) 180° (-1, 0)\n\nKey formulas to remember:\n\nX = r*cosΘ\n\nY = r*sinΘ\n\nOn the Unit Circle, Radius (r) = 1\n\nPythagorean Theorem: X2 + Y2 = r2\n\nSpecial Right Triangles:\n\nThe graph below shows the X and Y Coordinates on the Unit Circle. Note in Quadrant I, both X and Y coordinate points are positive. However in Quadrant II, the X coordinate is negative and the Y coordinate is positive. In Quadrant III, both X and Y are negative, and in Quadrant IV, X is positive, but Y is negative."
