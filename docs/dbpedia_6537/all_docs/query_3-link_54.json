        "text": "This tutorial is designed to compare units of measurement in Minecraft to real life units and to compare different units used in-game.\n\nTime[]\n\nTo convert time in Minecraft to time in real life, simply divide by 72, and vice versa. To measure ticks in Minecraft, multiply the real time (seconds) by 20 (this doesn't factor in lag and assumes a constant 20tps).\n\nMinecraft Time Real Time Ticks 3.6 seconds = 0.05 seconds = 1 1 minute ≈ 0.83 seconds ≈ 17 1.2 minutes = 1 second = 20 1 hour = 50 seconds = 1,000 1.2 hours = 1 minute = 1,200 1 day = 20 minutes = 24,000 3 days = 1 hour = 72,000 1 week ≈ 2.33 hours = 168,000 1 lunar cycle (8 days) ≈ 2.67 hours = 192,000 1 month (30 days) = 10 hours = 720,000 72 days = 1 day = 1,728,000 1 year (365 days) ≈ 5.07 days = 8,760,000 504 days (1.38 years) = 1 week = 12,096,000 2160 days (5.92 years) = 1 month = 51,840,000 1 decade ≈ 50.69 days ≈ 7.22 weeks = 87,600,000 72 years (26280 days) = 1 year = 630,720,000 1 century ≈ 1.39 years = 876,000,000\n\nAmount of items[]\n\n1 item is the most basic measurement in quantity.\n\n1 block = 9 items. Used for resources that can be crafted into storage blocks and back (most kinds of processed minerals, slimeballs, bone meal, melon slices, wheat, dried kelp)\n\n1 stack = 64 items = 7 blocks, 1 item. Note that some items like banners, signs, eggs, and ender pearls only stack to 16. So if someone says they have a stack of eggs, they have 16. For unstackable items, a stack is just 1.\n\nOne stack of a fully-stackable material (e.g. stone, diamond) will fully occupy one slot in one's inventory.\n\n1 full hopper = 5 stacks = 320 items.\n\n1 stack of blocks = 9 stacks = 576 items when completely uncrafted.\n\n1 full dispenser or dropper = 9 stacks = 576 items.\n\nMining capacity of an unenchanted diamond pickaxe = 24 stacks 25 items = 1561 items.\n\n1 full chest = 27 slots or 27 stacks = 1,728 items.\n\nMining capacity of an unenchanted netherite pickaxe = 31 stacks 47 items = 2031 items\n\n1 inventory = 37 stacks = 2,368 items, when the offhand is included.\n\n1 full double chest = 2 chestfuls = 54 stacks = 3,456 items.\n\nNote: The phrase \"double chest\" is often shortened to \"dub\"; e.g. \"a dub of cobblestone\", meaning 54 stacks.\n\n1 chestful of shulker boxes = 27 chestfuls = 729 stacks = 46,656 items.\n\n1 double-chestful of shulker boxes = 54 chestfuls = 1458 stacks = 93,312 items.\n\nA useful tool to convert different units in the game can be found on https://gamertools.net/tools/1.\n\nHealth[]\n\nMain article: Health\n\nThe basic measure of health is one health point (1 ). One heart (2 ) is also commonly used when talking about health.\n\nDamage/entity HP Chicken 4 Item 5 Instant Damage 6 Diamond Sword 7 Netherite Sword 8 Cow 10 Sharpness V Netherite Axe 13 × 6.5 Player 20 × 10 Enderman 40 × 20 TNT 65 × 32.5 max Iron Golem 100 × 50 Ender Dragon 200 × 100 Wither 300 × 150 [JE only] 600 × 300 [BE only] Warden 500 × 250 Player with maximum Health Boost and maximum Absorption 2068 × 1034 /kill 3.4028234663852886E38 × 1.7014117331926E+38 (max value of double 0x7F7FFFFF)\n\nHunger[]\n\nMain article: Hunger\n\nSimilarly, the basic unit in hunger is a food point—1 ( )—displayed as a chicken drumstick.\n\nA full hunger bar (20 ( × 10)) contains 20 food points.\n\nAdditionally there are another 20 saturation points, which are invisible but are used when performing actions before hunger, so the maximum value is 40.\n\nSpeed[]\n\nMain article: Player § Movement\n\nDistance[]\n\nMinecraft's worlds are a voxel grid where each block represents a voxel which is one cubic meter (1m3) in real life.\n\nKnowing that one block is one cubic meter,we can derive that:\n\nMetric units[]\n\nUnit Desgination Blocks Pixels 1 Terameter* 1e12 blocks 16e12 pixels 1 Gigameter 1e09 blocks 16e09 pixels 1 Megameter 1e06 blocks 16e06 pixels 1 Kilometer 1000 blocks 16000 pixels 1 Hectometer 100 blocks 1600 pixels 1 Decameter 10 blocks 160 pixels 1 Meter 1 block 16 pixels 1 Decimeter 0.1 blocks 1.6 pixels 1 Centimeter 0.01 blocks 0.16 pixels 1 Millimeter 0.001 blocks 0.016 pixels 6.25 cm 0.0625 blocks 1 pixel 62.5 cm 0.625 blocks 10 pixels 6.25 m 6.25 blocks 100 pixels\n\nA \"Terameter\" is unneeded, because of the value exceeds the 32-Bit Integer, of 2,147,483,648 meters (2.147 Billion Meters, [2.147e09]), Let alone, that you can't even teleport past 30 million meters, horse-ride to 8,388,608 meters, or even walking past 4,194,304 meters.\n\nBlocks Volume 1 block 1 m3 1 block 1000 liters\n\nNote that a water block is 0.9 m3 beacuse it is 0.9 meters high.\n\nImperial/U.S customary units[]\n\nLength Blocks 1 mile 1,609.344 blocks 1 yard 0.9144 blocks 1 foot 0.3048 blocks 1 inch 0.0254 blocks\n\nBlocks Length 1 block 0.000621371192 miles 1.0936133 yards 3.2808399 feet 39.3700787 inches\n\nBlocks Length (approx.) 1 block ≈ 1⁄1,760 miles ≈ 1 yard ≈ 3 feet ≈ 36 inches 1 pixel 1⁄28,160 miles 0.2 feet 2.46 inches"
