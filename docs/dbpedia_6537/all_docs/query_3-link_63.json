        "text": "Before humans created a standardized system of measurement, many cultures utilized local traditions for measuring objects. These are as follows:\n\nThe Cubit - This measurement originated in Egypt about 3000 B.C. It was used to build pyramids.\n\nThe Fathom - It is a unit of length in the imperial and the U.S. customary systems equal to 6 feet (1.8288 m).\n\nThe Hand-Span - It is the distance between the tip of the smallest finger and the tip of the thumb. We still use this to measure the height of horses.\n\nNeed for Measurement\n\nWe all know that Physics is a branch of Science which deals with the study of nature and natural phenomena.\n\nLet’s say I drop a ball from a certain height; it falls freely on the ground.\n\nBeing a physics enthusiast to understand this natural phenomenon; I will search for answers to the following questions:\n\nWhy did this ball fall on the ground?\n\nAt what speed does an object fall?\n\nIs the velocity of a ball constant?\n\nHow much will it take for a ball to reach the ground?\n\nIs the velocity of a body directly related to its mass?\n\nTo get a precise answer to these questions, measuring the quantities like distance, velocity, and time becomes essential.\n\nA System of Units\n\nThe system of units is the complete set of units, both fundamental units, and derived units, for all kinds of physical quantities. Each system is named with reference to fundamental units on which it is based. The common system of units utilized in mechanics are as follows:\n\nThe F.P.S or Foot-Pound System: A British engineering system of units that uses the foot as the unit of measurement of length, and pound as the unit of mass and second as the unit of time.\n\nThe C.G.S or Centimeter-Gram-Second System: A Gaussian system that uses centimeter, gram, and second as the three basic units for length, mass, and time respectively.\n\nThe M.K.S or Meter-Kilogram-Second System: The fundamental units of length, mass, and time are meter, kilogram, and second respectively.\n\nFundamental and Derived Units\n\nThe quantities which we can measure directly or indirectly are known as physical quantities.\n\nFor example, distance, displacement, momentum, etc.\n\nThe Physical Quantities are Divided into Two Categories:\n\nFundamental quantities, and\n\nDerived quantities\n\nFundamental Quantities\n\nThe physical quantities that do not depend upon the other quantities are the fundamental quantities.\n\nThere are Seven Fundamental Quantities\n\nRow 8, and 9: Two supplementary units on the SI system are:\n\nThe Radian - It is the unit of a plane angle. One radian is the angle subtended by the centre of a circle by an arc and is equal in length to the radius of a circle.\n\nThe Steradian - It is the unit of solid angle. One steradian is the solid angle subtended at the centre of a sphere, by the surface of a sphere which is equal in area to the square of its radius.\n\nDerived Quantities\n\nThe physical quantities that depend upon the fundamental quantities are known as the derived quantities.\n\nLet’s take examples of derived units:\n\nDerived Units Table: The Table Shows the List of Derived Units\n\nSome Important Practical Units\n\n1. In macrocosm measurements, i.e., measurement of very large distances:\n\nAstronomical units (A.U.)\n\nIt is the average distance of the centre of the sun from the centre of the earth.\n\n1 A.U. = 1.496 x 1011m ≃ 1.5 x 1011m\n\nA light-year (ly)\n\nOne light-year is the distance traveled by light in a vacuum in one Earth year.\n\nAs the speed of light in a vacuum is 3 x 108 m/s, and\n\n1 year = 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 seconds.\n\nTherefore, one light-year = 3 x 108 x 365 x 24 x 60 x 60 meter\n\n1 ly = 9.46 x 1015meter\n\nParsec\n\nIt is the unit of long distances and represents the parallactic seconds.\n\nParsec is the distance at which 1 A.U. a long arc subtends an angle of 1”.\n\nAs 1 A.U. = 1.496 x 1011m, and\n\nӨ = 1/60 min = 1/60 x 60 degree = 1/60 x 60 x π/180 radian\n\nSince the radius of an arc, r = length of an arc (l)/angle subtended (Ө)\n\nTherefore, 1 parsec = 1 A.U./1 sec = (1.496 x 1011) x (60 x 60 x 180)/(π)\n\nSo,\n\n1 parsec = 3.1 x 1016m\n\nThe Evolution of Measurement\n\nThe concept of measurement is one of the most fundamental concepts in scientific theory. Scientists would have a difficult time conducting experiments and forming theories if they did not have the ability to measure their results. The word \"measurement\" is derived from the Greek word \"metron,\" which literally translates as \"limited ratio.\"\n\nAn object's properties can be determined by comparing them to a standard, which is achieved through the use of measurement techniques.\n\nTo provide scientists with a quantity, measurement necessitates the use of tools. A quantity is a way of describing how much of something there is and how many of them there are in total. Researchers employ a system of measurement known as the \"metric system,\" which is still widely used today. It was developed in France in the 1790s and was the world's first standardised system of measurement. Except for the United States, this is the standard unit of measurement in every country except the United States today.\n\nMeasurement Units\n\nThe Seven Fundamental Units of Measurement (BMUs)\n\nLength is measured in metres (m)\n\nIn Physics, it is defined as the length of the path taken by light in an interval of precisely one second.\n\nA foundation for this theory is the fundamental quantity, the speed of light in a vacuum, which is 299 792 458 m/s.\n\nSeconds are Measured In Time (S)\n\nThe time taken by 9 192 631 770 periods of oscillations of the light emitted by a cesium -133 atoms to transition between two hyper-fine levels of the ground state, as measured by the time taken by 9 192 631 770 periods of oscillations of the light emitted by a cesium -133 atoms. Atomic clocks, which are extremely precise, are used to determine this.\n\nKilogram is the Unit of Mass (kg)\n\nIt is the mass of a prototype platinum-iridium cylinder, which is kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures in Paris, France, as a permanent record. Many countries, including the United States, keep copies of this cylinder because they use it to standardise and compare weights.\n\nAmpere is the Unit of Electric Current (A)\n\nThe constant current that, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible circular cross-section when placed 1 m apart in vacuum, would produce a force equal to the product of the square of the distance between the conductors.\n\nThe force between these conductors is one Newton for every metre of length between them. While it may appear that electric charge should have been used as a base unit, measuring current is far more straightforward, and as a result, current was selected as the standard base unit for all calculations.\n\nKelvin is the Unit of Temperature (K)\n\nThe Kelvin temperature unit is used in the International System of Units. That is exactly what it is.\n\n273.16-the thermodynamic temperature of water's triple point, as measured in degrees Celsius It is the temperature and pressure at which the solid, liquid, and gaseous states of water can all exist at the same time that is known as the triple point of water.\n\nMolecules are Units of Measurement for the Amount of a Substance (mol)\n\nIt is measured in moles, which is the amount of substance that contains the same number of entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogrammes of carbon-12. A mole is made up of an Avogadro number of different entities. Check out our chemistry articles to learn more about the Avogadro number and other related topics.\n\nCandela is the Unit of Luminous Intensity (cd)\n\nIt refers to the luminous intensity of a source that emits radiation with a constant frequency of a particular wavelength.\n\nUnits Derived from Other Units"
