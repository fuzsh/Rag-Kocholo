        "text": "Scientists measure radiation in different ways. Sometimes, they measure the dose that a person receives from a radioactive source, and sometimes they measure the amount of radioactivity in water, or in soil, or in the air. These measurements are taken to determine if safety actions are needed.\n\nThere are different but interrelated units for measuring radioactivity and estimating health effects.\n\nOn this page:\n\nRadioactivity\n\nAbsorbed Dose\n\nEffective Dose\n\nRadioactivity\n\nRadioactivity is the release of ionizing radiation that occurs when the nucleus of a radioactive atom decays. Activity refers to the frequency of radioactive decay (disintegrations per unit time) produced by a given amount of radioactive material. The ionizing radiation released can be in the form of alpha particles, beta particles, or gamma rays. The different forms of ionizing radiation have different potentials to damage human tissue. Learn more about different types of ionizing radiation here.\n\nA material's radioactivity is measured in becquerels (Bq, international unit) and curies (Ci, U.S. unit). Because a curie is a large unit, radioactivity results are usually shown in picocuries (pCi). A picocurie is one trillionth of a curie. The higher the number, the more radiation released by the material.\n\nExamples:\n\nA dose to the lens of the eyes from a brain CT scan is about 60 milligray (mGy) or 6 rad.\n\nA dose to the thyroid from a chest CT scan is about 10 milligray (mGy) or 1 rad.3\n\nUnit Conversions and Calculations\n\nTopic\n\nGray (Gy) | International or SI unit\n\nRad (rad) | U.S. unit\n\nHow the unit is derived\n\nAbsorbed dose is energy per unit mass\n\n1 gray (Gy) = 1 joule(J)/kilogram(kg)\n\n1 rad = 0.01 joule(J)/kilogram(kg) Conversions 1 gray (Gy) = 100 rad 1 rad = 0.01 gray (Gy)\n\nEffective Dose\n\nEffective dose takes the absorbed dose (see above) and adjusts it for radiation type and relative organ sensitivity. The result is an indicator for the potential for long-term health effects (i.e., cancer and hereditary effects) from an exposure. It is used to set regulatory limits that protect against long-term health effects in a population. It also allows experts to compare anticipated health effects from different exposure situations. Because this value is a calculated approximation, not a physical quantity, it cannot be used to predict individual health effects. The units for effective dose are sievert (Sv, international unit) and rem (rem, U.S. unit).\n\nExamples:\n\nThe annual radiation dose limit for workers is 0.05 sieverts (Sv) or 5 rem.4\n\nDuring an emergency, the guidance for when to evacuate or shelter in place is when the total projected dose exceeds 10-50 millisieverts (mSv) or 1-5 rem over the course of four days.5\n\nUnit Conversions and Calculations\n\nTopic Sievert (Sv) | International or SI unit Rem (rem) | U.S. unit\n\nUse the Radiation Dose Calculator to estimate your yearly dose from sources of ionizing radiation.\n\nView a PDF version of the Radiation Terms and Units infographic here.\n\n1 Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, 1990. \"Toxicological Profile for Radium\" (p. 53).
