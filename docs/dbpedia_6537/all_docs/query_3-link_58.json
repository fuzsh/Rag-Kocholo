        "text": "This page explains how to calculate the volume of solid objects, i.e. how much you could fit into an object if, for example, you filled it with a liquid.\n\nArea is the measure of how much space there is within a two dimensional object (see our page: Calculating Area for more).\n\nVolume is the measure of how much space there is within a three-dimensional object. Our page on three-dimensional shapes explains the basics of such shapes.\n\nIn the real world, calculating volume is probably not something that you will use as often as calculating area.\n\nHowever it can still be important. Being able to calculate volume will enable you to, for example, work out how much packing space you have when moving house, how much office space you need, or how much jam you can fit into a jar.\n\nIt can also be useful for understanding what the media mean when they talk about the capacity of a dam or the flow of a river.\n\nBasic Formulae for Calculating Volume\n\nVolume of Rectangle-Based Solids\n\nWhereas the basic formula for the area of a rectangular shape is length Ã width, the basic formula for volume is length Ã width Ã height.\n\nHow you refer to the different dimensions does not change the calculation: you may, for example, use 'depth' instead of 'height'. The important thing is that the three dimensions are multiplied together. You can multiply in which-ever order you like as it won't change the answer (see our page on multiplication for more).\n\nA box with the dimensions 15cm width, 25cm length and 5 cm height has a volume of:\n\n15 Ã 25 Ã 5 = 1875cm3\n\nVolume of Prisms and Cylinders\n\nThis basic formula can be extended to cover the volume of cylinders and prisms too. Instead of a rectangular end, you simply have another shape: a circle for cylinders, a triangle, hexagon or, indeed, any other polygon for a prism.\n\nEffectively, for cylinders and prisms, the volume is the area of one side multiplied by the depth or height of the shape.\n\nThe basic formula for volume of prisms and cylinders is therefore:\n\nArea of the end shape Ã the height/depth of the prism/cylinder.\n\nVolume of Cones and Pyramids\n\nThe same principle as above (width Ã length Ã height) holds for calculating the volume of a cone or a pyramid except that, because they come to a point, the volume is only a proportion of the total that it would be if they continued in the same shape (cross-section) right through.\n\nThe volume of a cone or pyramid is exactly one third of what it would be for a box or cylinder with the same base.\n\nThe formula is therefore:\n\nArea of the base or end shape Ã the height of the cone/pyramid Ã 1/3\n\nRefer back to our page Calculating Area if you cannot remember how to calculate the area of a circle or triangle.\n\nFor example, to calculate the volume of a cone with a radius of 5cm and a height of 10cm:\n\nThe area within a circle = Ïr2 (where Ï (pi) is approximately 3.14 and r is the radius of the circle).\n\nIn this example, area of base (circle) = Ïr2 = 3.14 Ã 5 Ã 5 = 78.5cm2.\n\n78.5 Ã 10 = 785\n\n785 Ã 1/3 = 261.6667cm3\n\nVolume of a Sphere\n\nAs with a circle, you need Ï (pi) to calculate the volume of a sphere.\n\nThe formula is 4/3 Ã Ï Ã radius3.\n\nYou may be wondering how you could work out the radius of a ball. Short of sticking a knitting needle through it (effective, but terminal for the ball!), there is a simpler way.\n\nYou can measure the distance around the widest point of the sphere directly, for example, with a tape measure. This circle is the circumference and has the same radius as the sphere itself.\n\nThe circumference of a circle is calculated as 2 x Ï x radius.\n\nTo calculate the radius from the circumference you:\n\nDivide the circumference by (2 x Ï).\n\nWorked Examples: Calculating Volume\n\nCalculating the Volume of Irregular Solids\n\nJust as you can calculate the area of irregular two-dimensional shapes by breaking them down into regular ones, you can do the same to calculate the volume of irregular solids. Just split the solid up into smaller parts until you reach only polyhedrons that you can work with easily.\n\nIn Conclusionâ¦"
