        "text": "A B C D 1 Factor (x) Mean (μ) St. Dev. (σ) Z-Score 2 3 12.17 6.4 -1.43 3 13 12.17 6.4 0.13 4 8 12.17 6.4 -0.65 5 21 12.17 6.4 1.38 6 17 12.17 6.4 0.75 7 11 12.17 6.4 -0.18\n\nHow the Z-Score Is Used\n\nIn it's most basic form, the z-score allows you determine how far (measured in standard deviations) the returns for the stock you're evaluating are from the mean of a sample of stocks. The average score you have could be the mean of a stock's annual return, the average return of the index it is listed on, or the average return of a selection of stocks you've picked.\n\nSome traders use the z-scores in more advanced evalulation methods, such as weighting each stock's return to use factor investing, where stocks are evaluated based on specific attributes using z-scores and standard deviation. In the forex markets, traders use z-scores and confidence limits to test the capability of a trading system to generate winning and losing streaks.\n\nZ-Scores vs. Standard Deviation\n\nIn most large data sets (assuming a normal distribution of data), 99.7% of values lie between -3 and 3 standard deviations, 95% between -2 and 2 standard deviations, and 68% between -1 and 1 standard deviations.\n\nStandard deviation indicates the amount of variability (or dispersion) within a given data set. For instance, if a sample of normally distributed data had a standard deviation of 3.1, and another had one of 6.3, the model with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.3 is more dispersed and would graph with a lower peak than the sample with an SD of 3.1.\n\nA distribution curve has negative and positive sides, so there are positive and negative standard deviations and z-scores. However, this has no relevance to the value itself other than indicating which side of the mean it is on. A negative value means it is on the left of the mean, and a positive value indicates it is on the right.\n\nThe z-score shows the number of standard deviations a given data point lies from the mean. So, standard deviation must be calculated first because the z-score uses it to communicate a data point's variability.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nA z-score is a statistical measurement that tells you how far away from the mean (or average) your datum lies in a normally distributed sample. At its most basic level, investors and traders use quantitative analysis methods such as a z-score to determine how a stock performs compared to other stocks or its own historical performance. In more advanced z-score uses, traders weigh investments based on desirable criteria, develop other indicators, or even try to predict the outcome of a trading strategy."
