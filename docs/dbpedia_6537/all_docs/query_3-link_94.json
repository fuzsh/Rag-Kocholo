        "text": "Calculator Use\n\nChoose a calculation for density p, mass m or Volume V. Enter the other two values and the calculator will solve for the third in the selected units. You can also enter scientific notation such as 3.45e22.\n\nDensity Equation for these Calculations:\n\n\\( p = \\dfrac{m}{V} \\)\n\nWhere:\n\np = density\n\nm = mass\n\nV = volume\n\nThe Density Calculator uses the formula p=m/V, or density (p) is equal to mass (m) divided by volume (V). The calculator can use any two of the values to calculate the third. Density is defined as mass per unit volume. Along with values, enter the known units of measure for each and this calculator will convert among units.\n\nSignificant Figures\n\nFor a value of 165778, selecting 4 significant figures will return 165800. For a value of 0.00165778, selecting 4 significant figures will return 0.001658. See also our help notes on significant figures.\n\nDensity calculations:\n\nSolving for density, mass or volume we can use the following formulas:\n\nCalculate p Given m and V\n\nCalculate density given mass and volume.\n\n\\( p = \\dfrac{m}{V} \\)\n\nCalculate m Given p and V\n\nCalculate mass given density and volume.\n\n\\( m = pV \\)\n\nCalculate V Given p and m\n\nCalculate volume given density and mass.\n\n\\( V = \\dfrac{m}{p} \\)\n\nCube root of Volume, is shown to help in the mental visualization of the actual volume. Thanks again to the user who suggested this calculator!\n\n\\( \\sqrt[3]{V} \\)"
