        "text": "Metric System is basically a system used for measuring distance, length, volume, weight and temperature. It is based on three basic units with which we can measure almost everything in the world\n\nM- meter, used to measure the length\n\nKg- kilogram, used to measure the mass\n\nS- second, used to measure time\n\nThe metric system was originated in the year 1799. Over the years, this system has been extended to incorporate many units. Although a number of variants of this system were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the term – metric system is used as another word for SI or the International System of Units.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nMetric System (SI Units)\n\nMetric Number Prefixes\n\nMetric System Conversion\n\nConversion Ratio\n\nExamples\n\nFAQs\n\nSI Units Metric System\n\nThe SI Units (standard International System of Units) give proper definitions for meter, kilogram and the second. It also specifies and defines four different additional units :\n\nKelvin- temperature\n\nAmpere – Electric Current\n\nCandela- luminous Intensity\n\nMole – Material Quantity\n\nRead more:\n\nConversion of Units\n\nCentimeter to meter Calculator\n\nInches to cm Converter\n\nMetric Number Prefixes\n\nIn order to remember the proper movement of units, arrange the prefixes from the largest to the smallest.\n\nKilo hecto deca Unit deci centi milli 103 102 101 100 10-1 10-2 10–3\n\nThus, the conversion from one unit to the other unit is done by multiplying or dividing the powers of 10.\n\nNow, let us discuss some of the units for length, weight, volume, and time.\n\nLength:\n\nThe most common units used to measure the length are as follows:\n\nKilometer (km) Hectometer (hm) Decameter (dam) Meter (m) Decimeter (dm) Centimeter\n\n(cm)\n\nMillimeter (mm) 1000 100 10 1 1/10 1/100 1/1000\n\nAlso, check: Centimeter\n\nVolume or Capacity\n\nThe most common units used to measure the capacity or volume of any object are as follows:\n\nKiloliter (kl) Hectoliter (hl) Decaliter(dal) Liter (l) Deciliter (dl) Centiliter\n\n(cl)\n\nMilliliter(ml) 1000 100 10 1 1/10 1/100 1/1000\n\nWeight\n\nThe most common units used to measure the weight of any object are as follows:\n\nKilogram (kg) Hectogram (hg) Decagram (dag) Gram (g) Decigram (dg) Centigram\n\n(cg)\n\nMilligram (mg) 1000 100 10 1 1/10 1/100 1/1000\n\nTime\n\nTo calculate the time, the base unit is second. Now, let us discuss some other units of time.\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\n1 day = 24 hours\n\n1 week = 7 days\n\n1 month = 30 or 31 days (Note: February has 28 days, but in leap year February has 29 days)\n\n1 year = 12 months (or)\n\n1 year = 365 days (But, in leap year, 1 year = 366 days)\n\nWhether you want to measure very small or very big things, You can go for metric number prefixes—for example- kilo and milli.\n\nThere are some common units that are based on the kilogram, meter and second.\n\nArea = Square Meter (Area= length by length) Therefore the basic unit of area is equal to meters by meters = m2 (square meters).\n\nVolume = Cubic Meter. Therefore, the basic unit of volume = m3 (cubic meters).\n\nLiter = one-thousandth of a cubic meter(1 m3 = 1,000 Liters) Therefore, 1 Liter = 1/1000 m3\n\nTime = Hour (1 hour=60 minutes, 1 minutes=60 seconds) Therefore,1 hour= 60×60= 3600 seconds\n\nDay = (1 day= 24 hours) Therefore, 1 day= 24 x 60 x 60 = 86400 seconds\n\nImportant Things to Remember\n\nMetric System Conversion\n\nWe can follow different methods for metric conversions. The below metric conversion chart shows the conversion of Metric Units to Metric Units for Length.\n\nConversion Ratio\n\nIn the measurement of units, the metric conversion ratio is a ratio, which is equal to 1. It is also known as unit factors. It is used to convert the units between the same system, as well as the conversion between the metric and the English systems. It is based on the concept of equivalent values. Similarly, a conversion factor is defined as a number that is used to convert one unit to another unit by dividing or multiplying to get the equivalent values.\n\nFor example, to convert 5 meters to centimetres, a conversion factor is required.\n\nWe know that 1 meter = 100 centimetres\n\nThus, the conversion factor is “multiplying by 100”.\n\n(i.e.,) 5 m = 5 x 100 cm\n\n5 m = 500 cm\n\nTherefore, the conversion from 5 m to cm is 500 cm.\n\nIn terms of conversion ratio, it can be written as:\n\n5m / 500 cm = 1\n\nMetric System Examples\n\nThe following examples explain the conversion from one unit to the other unit.\n\nExample 1:\n\nConvert 356 centimetres to meters.\n\nSolution:\n\nWe know that, 1 cm = 0.01 m\n\nThus, 356 cm = 356 x 0.01\n\n356 cm = 3.56 m.\n\nTherefore, 356 cm is equivalent to 3.56 meters.\n\nExample 2:\n\nConvert 4000 grams to kilograms.\n\nSolution:\n\nWe know that, 1 gram = 0.001 kilogram\n\nThus, 4000 g = 4000 x 0.001\n\n4000 g = 4 kilogram\n\nTherefore, 4000 grams is equivalent to 4 kilogram\n\nExample 3:\n\nConvert 50 kilolitres to liters.\n\nSolution:\n\nWe know that 1 kilolitre = 1000 liters\n\nThus, 50 kilolitres = 50 x 1000 litres\n\n50 kilolitres = 50000 litres"
