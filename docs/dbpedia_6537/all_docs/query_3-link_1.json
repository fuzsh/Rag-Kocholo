        "text": "Using Scientific Notation with Physical Measurements\n\nScientific notation is a way of writing numbers that are too large or small to be conveniently written as a decimal. For example, consider the number 840,000,000,000,000. It’s a rather large number to write out. The scientific notation for this number is 8.40 ×× 1014. Scientific notation follows this general format\n\nx× 10 y . x× 10 y .\n\nIn this format x is the value of the measurement with all placeholder zeros removed. In the example above, x is 8.4. The x is multiplied by a factor, 10y, which indicates the number of placeholder zeros in the measurement. Placeholder zeros are those at the end of a number that is 10 or greater, and at the beginning of a decimal number that is less than 1. In the example above, the factor is 1014. This tells you that you should move the decimal point 14 positions to the right, filling in placeholder zeros as you go. In this case, moving the decimal point 14 places creates only 13 placeholder zeros, indicating that the actual measurement value is 840,000,000,000,000.\n\nNumbers that are fractions can be indicated by scientific notation as well. Consider the number 0.0000045. Its scientific notation is 4.5 ×× 10–6. Its scientific notation has the same format\n\nx× 10 y . x× 10 y .\n\nHere, x is 4.5. However, the value of y in the 10y factor is negative, which indicates that the measurement is a fraction of 1. Therefore, we move the decimal place to the left, for a negative y. In our example of 4.5 ×× 10–6, the decimal point would be moved to the left six times to yield the original number, which would be 0.0000045.\n\nThe term order of magnitude refers to the power of 10 when numbers are expressed in scientific notation. Quantities that have the same power of 10 when expressed in scientific notation, or come close to it, are said to be of the same order of magnitude. For example, the number 800 can be written as 8 ×× 102, and the number 450 can be written as 4.5 ×× 102. Both numbers have the same value for y. Therefore, 800 and 450 are of the same order of magnitude. Similarly, 101 and 99 would be regarded as the same order of magnitude, 102. Order of magnitude can be thought of as a ballpark estimate for the scale of a value. The diameter of an atom is on the order of 10−9 m, while the diameter of the sun is on the order of 109 m. These two values are 18 orders of magnitude apart.\n\nScientists make frequent use of scientific notation because of the vast range of physical measurements possible in the universe, such as the distance from Earth to the moon (Figure 1.18), or to the nearest star.\n\nUnit Conversion and Dimensional Analysis\n\nIt is often necessary to convert from one type of unit to another. For example, if you are reading a European cookbook in the United States, some quantities may be expressed in liters and you need to convert them to cups. A Canadian tourist driving through the United States might want to convert miles to kilometers, to have a sense of how far away his next destination is. A doctor in the United States might convert a patient’s weight in pounds to kilograms.\n\nLet’s consider a simple example of how to convert units within the metric system. How can we want to convert 1 hour to seconds?\n\nNext, we need to determine a conversion factor relating meters to kilometers. A conversion factor is a ratio expressing how many of one unit are equal to another unit. A conversion factor is simply a fraction which equals 1. You can multiply any number by 1 and get the same value. When you multiply a number by a conversion factor, you are simply multiplying it by one. For example, the following are conversion factors: (1 foot)/(12 inches) = 1 to convert inches to feet, (1 meter)/(100 centimeters) = 1 to convert centimeters to meters, (1 minute)/(60 seconds) = 1 to convert seconds to minutes. In this case, we know that there are 1,000 meters in 1 kilometer.\n\nNow we can set up our unit conversion. We will write the units that we have and then multiply them by the conversion factor (1 km/1,000m) = 1, so we are simply multiplying 80m by 1:\n\n1.1 1 h × 60 min 1 h × 60 s 1 min =3600 s = 3 .6 × 10 2 s 1 h × 60 min 1 h × 60 s 1 min =3600 s = 3 .6 × 10 2 s\n\nWhen there is a unit in the original number, and a unit in the denominator (bottom) of the conversion factor, the units cancel. In this case, hours and minutes cancel and the value in seconds remains.\n\nYou can use this method to convert between any types of unit, including between the U.S. customary system and metric system. Notice also that, although you can multiply and divide units algebraically, you cannot add or subtract different units. An expression like 10 km + 5 kg makes no sense. Even adding two lengths in different units, such as 10 km + 20 m does not make sense. You express both lengths in the same unit. See Appendix C for a more complete list of conversion factors.\n\nWorked Example\n\nUnit Conversions: A Short Drive Home\n\nSuppose that you drive the 10.0 km from your university to home in 20.0 min. Calculate your average speed (a) in kilometers per hour (km/h) and (b) in meters per second (m/s). (Note—Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel.)\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst we calculate the average speed using the given units. Then we can get the average speed into the desired units by picking the correct conversion factor and multiplying by it. The correct conversion factor is the one that cancels the unwanted unit and leaves the desired unit in its place.\n\nSolution for (a)\n\nCalculate average speed. Average speed is distance traveled divided by time of travel. (Take this definition as a given for now—average speed and other motion concepts will be covered in a later module.) In equation form,\n\naverage speed = distance time . average speed = distance time .\n\nSubstitute the given values for distance and time.\n\naverage speed = 10.0 km 20.0 min =0.500 km min average speed = 10.0 km 20.0 min =0.500 km min\n\nConvert km/min to km/h: multiply by the conversion factor that will cancel minutes and leave hours. That conversion factor is 60min/1h 60min/1h. Thus,\n\naverage speed = 0.500 km min × 60 min 1 h =30.0 km h . average speed = 0.500 km min × 60 min 1 h =30.0 km h .\n\nDiscussion for (a)\n\nTo check your answer, consider the following:\n\nBe sure that you have properly cancelled the units in the unit conversion. If you have written the unit conversion factor upside down, the units will not cancel properly in the equation. If you accidentally get the ratio upside down, then the units will not cancel; rather, they will give you the wrong units as follows\n\nkm min × 1 hr 60 min = 1 60 km·h min 2 , km min × 1 hr 60 min = 1 60 km·h min 2 ,\n\nwhich are obviously not the desired units of km/h.\n\nCheck that the units of the final answer are the desired units. The problem asked us to solve for average speed in units of km/h and we have indeed obtained these units.\n\nCheck the significant figures. Because each of the values given in the problem has three significant figures, the answer should also have three significant figures. The answer 30.0 km/h does indeed have three significant figures, so this is appropriate. Note that the significant figures in the conversion factor are not relevant because an hour is defined to be 60 min, so the precision of the conversion factor is perfect.\n\nNext, check whether the answer is reasonable. Let us consider some information from the problem—if you travel 10 km in a third of an hour (20 min), you would travel three times that far in an hour. The answer does seem reasonable.\n\nSolution (b)\n\nThere are several ways to convert the average speed into meters per second.\n\nStart with the answer to (a) and convert km/h to m/s. Two conversion factors are needed—one to convert hours to seconds, and another to convert kilometers to meters.\n\nMultiplying by these yields\n\nAveragespeed=30.0 km h × 1 h 3,600 s × 1,000 m 1 km Averagespeed=30.0 km h × 1 h 3,600 s × 1,000 m 1 km\n\nAveragespeed=8.33 m s Averagespeed=8.33 m s\n\nDiscussion for (b)\n\nIf we had started with 0.500 km/min, we would have needed different conversion factors, but the answer would have been the same: 8.33 m/s.\n\nYou may have noted that the answers in the worked example just covered were given to three digits. Why? When do you need to be concerned about the number of digits in something you calculate? Why not write down all the digits your calculator produces?\n\nWorked Example\n\nUsing Physics to Evaluate Promotional Materials\n\nA commemorative coin that is 2″ in diameter is advertised to be plated with 15 mg of gold. If the density of gold is 19.3 g/cc, and the amount of gold around the edge of the coin can be ignored, what is the thickness of the gold on the top and bottom faces of the coin?\n\nStrategy\n\nTo solve this problem, the volume of the gold needs to be determined using the gold’s mass and density. Half of that volume is distributed on each face of the coin, and, for each face, the gold can be represented as a cylinder that is 2″ in diameter with a height equal to the thickness. Use the volume formula for a cylinder to determine the thickness.\n\nSolution\n\nThe mass of the gold is given by the formula m=ρV=15× 10 −3 g m=ρV=15× 10 −3 where ρ=19.3 g/cc and V is the volume. Solving for the volume gives V= m ρ = 15× 10 −3 g 19.3 g/cc ≅7.8× 10 −4 cc.\n\nIf t is the thickness, the volume corresponding to half the gold is 1 2 ( 7.8× 10 −4 )=π r 2 t=π ( 2.54 ) 2 t, where the 1″ radius has been converted to cm. Solving for the thickness gives t= ( 3.9× 10 −4 ) π ( 2.54 ) 2 ≅1.9× 10 −5 cm = 0.00019 mm.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe amount of gold used is stated to be 15 mg, which is equivalent to a thickness of about 0.00019 mm. The mass figure may make the amount of gold sound larger, both because the number is much bigger (15 versus 0.00019), and because people may have a more intuitive feel for how much a millimeter is than for how much a milligram is. A simple analysis of this sort can clarify the significance of claims made by advertisers.\n\nAccuracy, Precision and Significant Figures\n\nScience is based on experimentation that requires good measurements. The validity of a measurement can be described in terms of its accuracy and its precision (see Figure 1.19 and Figure 1.20). Accuracy is how close a measurement is to the correct value for that measurement. For example, let us say that you are measuring the length of standard piece of printer paper. The packaging in which you purchased the paper states that it is 11 inches long, and suppose this stated value is correct. You measure the length of the paper three times and obtain the following measurements: 11.1 inches, 11.2 inches, and 10.9 inches. These measurements are quite accurate because they are very close to the correct value of 11.0 inches. In contrast, if you had obtained a measurement of 12 inches, your measurement would not be very accurate. This is why measuring instruments are calibrated based on a known measurement. If the instrument consistently returns the correct value of the known measurement, it is safe for use in finding unknown values.\n\nPrecision states how well repeated measurements of something generate the same or similar results. Therefore, the precision of measurements refers to how close together the measurements are when you measure the same thing several times. One way to analyze the precision of measurements would be to determine the range, or difference between the lowest and the highest measured values. In the case of the printer paper measurements, the lowest value was 10.9 inches and the highest value was 11.2 inches. Thus, the measured values deviated from each other by, at most, 0.3 inches. These measurements were reasonably precise because they varied by only a fraction of an inch. However, if the measured values had been 10.9 inches, 11.1 inches, and 11.9 inches, then the measurements would not be very precise because there is a lot of variation from one measurement to another.\n\nThe measurements in the paper example are both accurate and precise, but in some cases, measurements are accurate but not precise, or they are precise but not accurate. Let us consider a GPS system that is attempting to locate the position of a restaurant in a city. Think of the restaurant location as existing at the center of a bull’s-eye target. Then think of each GPS attempt to locate the restaurant as a black dot on the bull’s eye.\n\nIn Figure 1.21, you can see that the GPS measurements are spread far apart from each other, but they are all relatively close to the actual location of the restaurant at the center of the target. This indicates a low precision, high accuracy measuring system. However, in Figure 1.22, the GPS measurements are concentrated quite closely to one another, but they are far away from the target location. This indicates a high precision, low accuracy measuring system. Finally, in Figure 1.23, the GPS is both precise and accurate, allowing the restaurant to be located.\n\nUncertainty\n\nThe accuracy and precision of a measuring system determine the uncertainty of its measurements. Uncertainty is a way to describe how much your measured value deviates from the actual value that the object has. If your measurements are not very accurate or precise, then the uncertainty of your values will be very high. In more general terms, uncertainty can be thought of as a disclaimer for your measured values. For example, if someone asked you to provide the mileage on your car, you might say that it is 45,000 miles, plus or minus 500 miles. The plus or minus amount is the uncertainty in your value. That is, you are indicating that the actual mileage of your car might be as low as 44,500 miles or as high as 45,500 miles, or anywhere in between. All measurements contain some amount of uncertainty. In our example of measuring the length of the paper, we might say that the length of the paper is 11 inches plus or minus 0.2 inches or 11.0 ± 0.2 inches. The uncertainty in a measurement, A, is often denoted as δA (\"delta A\"),\n\nThe factors contributing to uncertainty in a measurement include the following:\n\nLimitations of the measuring device\n\nThe skill of the person making the measurement\n\nIrregularities in the object being measured\n\nAny other factors that affect the outcome (highly dependent on the situation)\n\nIn the printer paper example uncertainty could be caused by: the fact that the smallest division on the ruler is 0.1 inches, the person using the ruler has bad eyesight, or uncertainty caused by the paper cutting machine (e.g., one side of the paper is slightly longer than the other.) It is good practice to carefully consider all possible sources of uncertainty in a measurement and reduce or eliminate them,\n\nPercent Uncertainty\n\nOne method of expressing uncertainty is as a percent of the measured value. If a measurement, A, is expressed with uncertainty, δA, the percent uncertainty is\n\n1.2 % uncertainty = δA A × 100%. % uncertainty = δA A × 100%.\n\nWorked Example\n\nCalculating Percent Uncertainty: A Bag of Apples\n\nA grocery store sells 5-lb bags of apples. You purchase four bags over the course of a month and weigh the apples each time. You obtain the following measurements:\n\nWeek 1 weight: 4.8lb 4.8lb\n\nWeek 2 weight: 5.3lb 5.3lb\n\nWeek 3 weight: 4.9lb 4.9lb\n\nWeek 4 weight: 5.4lb 5.4lb\n\nYou determine that the weight of the 5 lb bag has an uncertainty of ±0.4 lb. What is the percent uncertainty of the bag’s weight?\n\nStrategy\n\nFirst, observe that the expected value of the bag’s weight, AA , is 5 lb. The uncertainty in this value, δAδA , is 0.4 lb. We can use the following equation to determine the percent uncertainty of the weight\n\n% uncertainty = δA A × 100%. % uncertainty = δA A × 100%.\n\nSolution\n\nPlug the known values into the equation\n\n% uncertainty = 0.4 lb 5 lb ×100%=8%. % uncertainty = 0.4 lb 5 lb ×100%=8%.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe can conclude that the weight of the apple bag is 5 lb ± 8 percent. Consider how this percent uncertainty would change if the bag of apples were half as heavy, but the uncertainty in the weight remained the same. Hint for future calculations: when calculating percent uncertainty, always remember that you must multiply the fraction by 100 percent. If you do not do this, you will have a decimal quantity, not a percent value.\n\nUncertainty in Calculations\n\nThere is an uncertainty in anything calculated from measured quantities. For example, the area of a floor calculated from measurements of its length and width has an uncertainty because the both the length and width have uncertainties. How big is the uncertainty in something you calculate by multiplication or division? If the measurements in the calculation have small uncertainties (a few percent or less), then the method of adding percents can be used. This method says that the percent uncertainty in a quantity calculated by multiplication or division is the sum of the percent uncertainties in the items used to make the calculation. For example, if a floor has a length of 4.00 m and a width of 3.00 m, with uncertainties of 2 percent and 1 percent, respectively, then the area of the floor is 12.0 m2 and has an uncertainty of 3 percent (expressed as an area this is 0.36 m2, which we round to 0.4 m2 since the area of the floor is given to a tenth of a square meter).\n\nFor a quick demonstration of the accuracy, precision, and uncertainty of measurements based upon the units of measurement, try this simulation. You will have the opportunity to measure the length and weight of a desk, using milli- versus centi- units. Which do you think will provide greater accuracy, precision and uncertainty when measuring the desk and the notepad in the simulation? Consider how the nature of the hypothesis or research question might influence how precise of a measuring tool you need to collect data.\n\nPrecision of Measuring Tools and Significant Figures\n\nAn important factor in the accuracy and precision of measurements is the precision of the measuring tool. In general, a precise measuring tool is one that can measure values in very small increments. For example, consider measuring the thickness of a coin. A standard ruler can measure thickness to the nearest millimeter, while a micrometer can measure the thickness to the nearest 0.005 millimeter. The micrometer is a more precise measuring tool because it can measure extremely small differences in thickness. The more precise the measuring tool, the more precise and accurate the measurements can be.\n\nWhen we express measured values, we can only list as many digits as we initially measured with our measuring tool (such as the rulers shown in Figure 1.24). For example, if you use a standard ruler to measure the length of a stick, you may measure it with a decimeter ruler as 3.6 cm. You could not express this value as 3.65 cm because your measuring tool was not precise enough to measure a hundredth of a centimeter. It should be noted that the last digit in a measured value has been estimated in some way by the person performing the measurement. For example, the person measuring the length of a stick with a ruler notices that the stick length seems to be somewhere in between 36 mm and 37 mm. He or she must estimate the value of the last digit. The rule is that the last digit written down in a measurement is the first digit with some uncertainty. For example, the last measured value 36.5 mm has three digits, or three significant figures. The number of significant figures in a measurement indicates the precision of the measuring tool. The more precise a measuring tool is, the greater the number of significant figures it can report.\n\nZeros\n\nSpecial consideration is given to zeros when counting significant figures. For example, the zeros in 0.053 are not significant because they are only placeholders that locate the decimal point. There are two significant figures in 0.053—the 5 and the 3. However, if the zero occurs between other significant figures, the zeros are significant. For example, both zeros in 10.053 are significant, as these zeros were actually measured. Therefore, the 10.053 placeholder has five significant figures. The zeros in 1300 may or may not be significant, depending on the style of writing numbers. They could mean the number is known to the last zero, or the zeros could be placeholders. So 1300 could have two, three, or four significant figures. To avoid this ambiguity, write 1300 in scientific notation as 1.3 × 103. Only significant figures are given in the x factor for a number in scientific notation (in the form x×10yx×10y). Therefore, we know that 1 and 3 are the only significant digits in this number. In summary, zeros are significant except when they serve only as placeholders. Table 1.4 provides examples of the number of significant figures in various numbers.\n\nTable 1.4 Number Significant Figures Rationale 1.657 4 There are no zeros and all non-zero numbers are always significant. 0.4578 4 The first zero is only a placeholder for the decimal point. 0.000458 3 The first four zeros are placeholders needed to report the data to the ten-thousandths place. 2000.56 6 The three zeros are significant here because they occur between other significant figures. 45,600 3 With no underlines or scientific notation, we assume that the last two zeros are placeholders and are not significant. 15895000 7 The two underlined zeros are significant, while the last zero is not, as it is not underlined. 5.457 ×× 1013 4 In scientific notation, all numbers reported in front of the multiplication sign are significant 6.520 ×× 10–23 4 In scientific notation, all numbers reported in front of the multiplication sign are significant, including zeros.\n\nSignificant Figures in Calculations\n\nWhen combining measurements with different degrees of accuracy and precision, the number of significant digits in the final answer can be no greater than the number of significant digits in the least precise measured value. There are two different rules, one for multiplication and division and another rule for addition and subtraction, as discussed below.\n\nFor multiplication and division: The answer should have the same number of significant figures as the starting value with the fewest significant figures. For example, the area of a circle can be calculated from its radius using A=π r 2 A=π r 2 . Let us see how many significant figures the area will have if the radius has only two significant figures, for example, r = 2.0 m. Then, using a calculator that keeps eight significant figures, you would get\n\nA= π r 2 =( 3.1415927... )× ( 2.0 m ) 2 =4.5238934 m 2 . A= π r 2 =( 3.1415927... )× ( 2.0 m ) 2 =4.5238934 m 2 .\n\nBut because the radius has only two significant figures, the area calculated is meaningful only to two significant figures or\n\nA=4.5 m 2 A=4.5 m 2\n\neven though the value of ππ is meaningful to at least eight digits.\n\nFor addition and subtraction: The answer should have the same number places (e.g. tens place, ones place, tenths place, etc.) as the least-precise starting value. Suppose that you buy 7.56 kg of potatoes in a grocery store as measured with a scale having a precision of 0.01 kg. Then you drop off 6.052 kg of potatoes at your laboratory as measured by a scale with a precision of 0.001 kg. Finally, you go home and add 13.7 kg of potatoes as measured by a bathroom scale with a precision of 0.1 kg. How many kilograms of potatoes do you now have, and how many significant figures are appropriate in the answer? The mass is found by simple addition and subtraction:\n\n7.56 kg −6.052 kg +13.7 kg _ 15.208 kg 7.56 kg −6.052 kg +13.7 kg _ 15.208 kg\n\nThe least precise measurement is 13.7 kg. This measurement is expressed to the 0.1 decimal place, so our final answer must also be expressed to the 0.1 decimal place. Thus, the answer should be rounded to the tenths place, giving 15.2 kg. The same is true for non-decimal numbers. For example,\n\n6527.23+2=6528.23=6528. 6527.23+2=6528.23=6528.\n\nWe cannot report the decimal places in the answer because 2 has no decimal places that would be significant. Therefore, we can only report to the ones place.\n\nIt is a good idea to keep extra significant figures while calculating, and to round off to the correct number of significant figures only in the final answers. The reason is that small errors from rounding while calculating can sometimes produce significant errors in the final answer. As an example, try calculating 5,098−( 5.000 )×( 1,010 ) 5,098−( 5.000 )×( 1,010 ) to obtain a final answer to only two significant figures. Keeping all significant during the calculation gives 48. Rounding to two significant figures in the middle of the calculation changes it to 5,100 – (5.000) × (1,000) = 100, 5,100 – (5.000) × (1,000) = 100, which is way off. You would similarly avoid rounding in the middle of the calculation in counting and in doing accounting, where many small numbers need to be added and subtracted accurately to give possibly much larger final numbers.\n\nSignificant Figures in this Text\n\nIn this textbook, most numbers are assumed to have three significant figures. Furthermore, consistent numbers of significant figures are used in all worked examples. You will note that an answer given to three digits is based on input good to at least three digits. If the input has fewer significant figures, the answer will also have fewer significant figures. Care is also taken that the number of significant figures is reasonable for the situation posed. In some topics, such as optics, more than three significant figures will be used. Finally, if a number is exact, such as the 2 in the formula, c=2πr c=2πr, it does not affect the number of significant figures in a calculation.\n\nWorked Example\n\nApproximating Vast Numbers: a Trillion Dollars\n\nThe U.S. federal deficit in the 2008 fiscal year was a little greater than $10 trillion. Most of us do not have any concept of how much even one trillion actually is. Suppose that you were given a trillion dollars in $100 bills. If you made 100-bill stacks, like that shown in Figure 1.25, and used them to evenly cover a football field (between the end zones), make an approximation of how high the money pile would become. (We will use feet/inches rather than meters here because football fields are measured in yards.) One of your friends says 3 in., while another says 10 ft. What do you think?\n\nStrategy\n\nWhen you imagine the situation, you probably envision thousands of small stacks of 100 wrapped $100 bills, such as you might see in movies or at a bank. Since this is an easy-to-approximate quantity, let us start there. We can find the volume of a stack of 100 bills, find out how many stacks make up one trillion dollars, and then set this volume equal to the area of the football field multiplied by the unknown height.\n\nSolution\n\nCalculate the volume of a stack of 100 bills. The dimensions of a single bill are approximately 3 in. by 6 in. A stack of 100 of these is about 0.5 in. thick. So the total volume of a stack of 100 bills is\n\nvolume of stack=length×width×height, volume of stack=6 in.×3 in.×0.5 in., volume of stack=9 in . 3 . volume of stack=length×width×height, volume of stack=6 in.×3 in.×0.5 in., volume of stack=9 in . 3 .\n\nCalculate the number of stacks. Note that a trillion dollars is equal to $1× 10 12 $1× 10 12 , and a stack of one-hundred $100 $100 bills is equal to $10,000, $10,000, or $1× 10 4 $1× 10 4 . The number of stacks you will have is\n\n1.3 $1 × 10 12 (a trillion dollars) / $1 × 10 4 per stack = 1 × 10 8 stacks. $1 × 10 12 (a trillion dollars) / $1 × 10 4 per stack = 1 × 10 8 stacks.\n\nCalculate the area of a football field in square inches. The area of a football field is 100 yd× 50yd 100 yd× 50yd, which gives 5,000 yd 2 5,000 yd 2 . Because we are working in inches, we need to convert square yards to square inches\n\nArea = 5,000 yd 2 × 3 ft 1yd × 3 ft 1yd × 12 in. 1 foot × 12 in. 1 foot = 6,480,000 in . 2 , Area≈ 6 × 10 6 in . 2 . Area = 5,000 yd 2 × 3 ft 1yd × 3 ft 1yd × 12 in. 1 foot × 12 in. 1 foot = 6,480,000 in . 2 , Area≈ 6 × 10 6 in . 2 .\n\nThis conversion gives us 6 × 10 6 in . 2 6 × 10 6 in . 2 for the area of the field. (Note that we are using only one significant figure in these calculations.)\n\nCalculate the total volume of the bills. The volume of all the $100-bill stacks is 9 in . 3 / stack × 10 8 stacks = 9 × 10 8 in . 3 9 in . 3 / stack × 10 8 stacks = 9 × 10 8 in . 3\n\nCalculate the height. To determine the height of the bills, use the following equation\n\nvolume of bills = area of field × height of money Height of money = volume of bills area of field Height of money = 9 × 10 8 in . 3 6 × 10 6 in . 2 = 1 .33 × 10 2 in. Height of money = 1×10 2 in. = 100 in. volume of bills = area of field × height of money Height of money = volume of bills area of field Height of money = 9 × 10 8 in . 3 6 × 10 6 in . 2 = 1 .33 × 10 2 in. Height of money = 1×10 2 in. = 100 in.\n\nThe height of the money will be about 100 in. high. Converting this value to feet gives\n\n100 in.× 1ft 12 in. =8.33 ft≈8 ft. 100 in.× 1ft 12 in. =8.33 ft≈8 ft.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe final approximate value is much higher than the early estimate of 3 in., but the other early estimate of 10 ft (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise tell you in terms of rough guesstimates versus carefully calculated approximations?\n\nIn the example above, the final approximate value is much higher than the first friend’s early estimate of 3 in. However, the other friend’s early estimate of 10 ft. (120 in.) was roughly correct. How did the approximation measure up to your first guess? What can this exercise suggest about the value of rough guesstimates versus carefully calculated approximations?"
