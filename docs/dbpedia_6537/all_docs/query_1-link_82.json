        "text": "Eternal Gardens, our new #Web4 project has now reached 70+ mints and we have just completed the in-VR build system which will allow our holders and users to create their own memorial gardens, homes, spiritual getaways and other scenes in which they can begin training multiple personas as life coaches, mentors, teachers, as well as creating and evolving their own digital essence and even that of their pets, to leave for future generations to discover and interact with. We thank all those who have joined with founder Nathaniel Vegh, leading this project out of the innovation hub in Montreal at McGill University. Enjoy some of our beautiful works of art from the collection. Read more about Eternal Gardens here: https://lnkd.in/gSXgSDZf\n\nShipping another 10 physical works of art this week to our holders in Eternal Gardens. The Confluence rewards its holders with real world products exceeding any costs of mint. Giving to our community, rather than taking. Our #Web4 Eternal Gardens project is something that will push the boundaries of everything we built before in Web3, which is a massive Gaming and experiential Universe across PC, mobile and VR with true portability of scores, inventory and currencies. You can read about Eternal Gardens and join us here at our campaign page: https://lnkd.in/gSXgSDZf Or contact me directly if you prefer person to person communication and input prior to making a decision. We are always open to new partnerships and to leveraging our playable-now ecosystem to assist start-ups in Web3. If you are a project founder and need a boost, we have the entire full-stack of tech and extensive, successful real-world experience in the art world as well. We are stable and methodical builders building new products pushing the boundaries of current technology in gaming, Metaverse, VR and AI, so if you are building for the long-term and are not out there to flash-in-the-pan it, then we are definitely an option for you.\n\nWhy the Confluence Universe and its well-thought-out business model is the key to Web3's Comeback. **1. Low Cost of Entry: Web3's for everyone, not just the elite. It's time for all to join the party! **2. Solid Products: Not just NFTs, but NFT projects backed by games with real revenue streams and rewards. **3. Micro-Transaction Magic: Real gamers, real money, real value established on a third-party-in end user consumer basis. **4. Community & Ecosystem: More than a platform, it's a universe where everyone's a part of the story. **5. The Comeback: Web3's positive sequel has already started with the Confluence, our 40+ Collections and incredible gaming products. It's not just hype; it's built to last. We've built a #MatureNFT market for holders, that does not at all follow the typical thought-process of the vast majority of people in the space. It is not about market cap, number of holders, trade volume. All of those things are so easily manipulated and have been. We've created an ecosystem that turns the entire past Web3 ethos and degen mentality on its head, creating the perfect balance to achieve positive results for all core holders, regardless of floor outcomes.\n\nRecently, I surpassed my 900th sale of original artwork (918 and pushing for 1,000 by the end of 2024). I do this without any assistants or apprentices like some of the establishment darlings do. Though included in my total sales are several crossover or collaborative works with other artists. I am also a daily user of Grok on X to help me with my 20 X feeds for my over 580k followers plus another 800k on Discord. I was looking for Grok's help with explaining some things about my methodology for sales and Grok came up with this. At the very least, I hope it inspires other artists who may not be able to crack the hallowed halls of the establishment art world. Give it a read and let me know your thoughts.\n\nI have been very fortunate that my work is appreciated by people all over the world. This past year I have shipped over 100 original works of art to the UK, the USA, Canada, Germany, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, South Africa, Ireland, the Netherlands and even as far as Chile. I am sure I am forgetting some places. Apologies if I missed you! While most of my business is still conducted in China, an ever-increasing percentage is being accomplished through Web3 globally now with our Eternal Gardens \"Patron of the Arts\" Collection. I have shipped the first 26 works of art to our holders and I am now in the process of packaging to ship the next batch of 25 which will bring my total sales of original artwork from 893 to 918 this coming week. I started painting in the summer of 2015, but did not begin selling my work until January of 2017 and I have sold over 100+ original works of art on average every year since then. In the past 16 months I have also sold over 5,500 custom digital works of art as NFT's to our Confluence Universe holders, in addition to primary minting over 22,000 NFT's in the worst bear market Web3 has ever seen. We can do this because we give to the space, rather than take. We have rescued 17 Legacy projects. More than any Blue Chip, by far. It's not even close. We are a small but very honest and hard-working team of professionals who are always looking to collab and connect with like-minded people as we move towards creating a Mature NFT market backed by our solid real-world products in the art world and in our gaming Universe.\n\nExciting news for all our Eternal Gardens enthusiasts! We are thrilled to announce that our #Web4 project, Eternal Gardens, has officially begun shipping physical artwork to our holders who purchased the Patron of the Arts Presale Mint package! As we embark on this new chapter, we invite you to join us in celebrating the fusion of digital and physical art. Each piece of artwork is a testament to the creativity and innovation that define Eternal Gardens. To learn more about our project and how you can become a part of this vibrant community, visit our campaign page at https://lnkd.in/gSXgSDZf We can't wait to see how our artwork will brighten up your homes and offices, bringing a piece of the Eternal Gardens universe into your daily lives. Thank you for your support, and stay tuned for more exciting updates! #EternalGardens #Web4 #DigitalArt #PhysicalArt #ArtCollectors #ArtLovers #ArtCommunity #NFTs #PresaleMint #PatronOfTheArts\n\nIntroducing the Confluence Universe: Where Innovation Meets Entertainment At the Confluence Universe, we're not just building games; we're crafting immersive worlds that transcend the boundaries of traditional gaming.

We own over 40 NFT collections, with 3 of them in the All-Time, All-Chain, All-Category Opensea Top 50 and 8 in the Top 150. We've rescued more NFT projects than any other company in the space. We primary minted over 20,000 NFTs pre-chain through direct sales and raised our floors in the worst market while the vast majority of other projects saw their holders' asset values decline over 90%. Join the Confluence Universe and embark on a journey where the only limit is your imagination. #ConfluenceUniverse #BlockchainGaming #GenerativeAI #Web3 #CrossPlatformGaming\n\nThis week I will begin shipping out 26 physical works of art as RWA rewards to minters of our #EternalGardens #Web4 Collection, with 50+ works on the waiting list to be completed and shipped after these initial shipments. These represent my 868th through 893rd original works of art sold since January of 2017. The #Confluence has been one of the best performing #Web3 companies over the past 16 months by far and by many metrics. In the worst market in the short history of NFT's we have: - held all of our floors and mostly doubled, tripled, quadrupled and even 5x'ed some of them - rescued 16 Legacy Collections from previous founders who could not sustain the projects or fulfill roadmaps for their holders - grown from just 200 members 16 months ago to over 800k on X and Discord combined at ZERO user acquisition cost and NEVER paying influencers - minted over 20k+ NFT's all pre-chain (meaning we did not need to go to a public mint) including over 5k 1/1 custom requested works of digital art for our holders - gave out more rewards to our holders than was taken in at mint (over 300k USD value and counting) - maintained a very low cost range of entry into our ecosystem for the masses starting as low as $3, with most falling in the $30-70 USD range, but some as high as 1 ETH (for which you get a massive Bounty package including the physical artwork worth more than the mint price) - built the first truly cross-platform Web3 Gaming Metaversian ecosystem with portability of scores, inventory and currencies across PC, mobile and VR - coded over 50 smart contracts, 20 minting Dapps involving complex migrations and custom choice selections for our holders and many completely proprietary Web3 Gaming integrations - created the first ever #Web4 project called Eternal Gardens harnassing artificial intelligence in developing our virtual environments for our users - built what is arguably the largest #Web3Gaming ecosystem with over 300+ playable now levels across PC, mobile and VR, on track to hit 1,000+ levels by October - 3 Collections in the Top 50 OS Gaming charts and 8 in the Top 150, All-Time, All-Category, All-Chain with over 32,000 ETH in secondary sales, all the more impressive since the bulk of our sales over the past 16 months are done pre-chain - did all this and more with a team of 5 highly skilled professionals\n\nJoin us in #Web4, powered by arguably the most successful company in all of #Web3 this past year, returning an average 3x to early adopters and this in the absolute worst market while most all other projects including industry darlings tanked over 80%. The #Confluence is a company that NEVER gouged a single holder, but instead rescued 25,000 OG holders from #Web3 oblivion, building a massive #Web3Gaming and experiential Universe that surpasses all others in the space and which has now led to the advent of #Web4 with its #EternalGardens project. Drawing on our expertise in experiential VR and machine learning and bolstered by over 3 years of building out and testing real-world, deployed-now products with a community of support from our Discord, X and other socials growing from 200 members to 800k+ in the past 12 months, the #Confluence leads the field in so many metrics. A profitable, cash-flow positive startup with traction and 5 major products entering monetization at the forefront of #Web3 and literally, the creators of #Web4, we are currently entertaining a Seed Round from early-stage investors, although we are actually well beyond Seed in terms of status, capability and performance of the company. For individuals who enjoy collecting NFT's of significant value and utility, join #EternalGardens and get an incredible Presale Mint Package Bounty which includes 5 #Confluence assets as well as a physical painting from one of Canada's Top Ten living artists in terms of volume and hammer prices. .Join us, pick up an #EternalGardens Presale Mint Package and download our Universe at theConfluence.World Congratulations to the first 12 Minters of #Web4 assets featured below! You have made history!"
