        "text": "What are metric units of measurement?\n\nMetric units of measurement are the international system of units (SI units) and include the standard units of length (meter), mass (gram), capacity (liter) and time (second).\n\nThe metric system is based on powers of 10 (the decimal system). The metric prefixes along with the basic unit vocabulary help identify their standard unit and size.\n\nThe prefix “milli” means \\cfrac{1}{1000} \\, th.\n\nFor example,\n\nA millimeter is \\cfrac{1}{1000} \\, th of a meter.\n\nA milliliter is \\cfrac{1}{1000} \\, th of a liter.\n\nThe prefix “centi” means \\cfrac{1}{100} \\, th.\n\nFor example,\n\nA centimeter is \\cfrac{1}{100} \\, th of a meter.\n\nA centiliter is \\cfrac{1}{100} \\, th of a liter.\n\nThe prefix “deci,” “deca,” or “deka” means \\cfrac{1}{10} \\, th.\n\nFor example,\n\nA decimeter is \\cfrac{1}{10} \\, th of a meter.\n\nA decigram is \\cfrac{1}{10} \\, th of a gram.\n\nThe prefix “kilo” means 1,000 times larger.\n\nFor example,\n\nA kilometer is 1,000 times larger than a meter.\n\nA kilogram is 1,000 times larger than a gram.\n\nRelative sizes for metric unit measurements\n\nSince there are many different units for measuring, it is helpful to think about each unit in relation to something in the real world. Let’s look at some common units and their relative sizes.\n\nOne way to measure an object is length – the distance from one point to another. In the metric system, a meter is the base unit for length.\n\nOne way to measure an object is mass – the weight of an object. In the metric system, a gram is the base unit for mass.\n\nNote: A tonne is also referred to as a metric ton, but is NOT the same as a customary ton (2,000 pounds ).\n\nOne way to measure an object is capacity – how much space something takes up. In the metric system, a liter is the base unit for capacity (also referred to as the base unit of volume).\n\nOne way to measure an event is time – the length of an event with a clear starting and ending moment. In the metric system, a second is the base unit for time.\n\nNote: All of these time measurements are very small, and it can be harder to tell the difference between them on our own.\n\nWhat are metric units of measurement?\n\nExample 1: units of length\n\nWhat are the most appropriate units to measure the width of a hand-held calculator?\n\nDecide if the measurement is length, mass, capacity or time.\n\nWidth is a measurement of length, so you need to consider the measurement units based on the meter (m).\n\n2Consider the size.\n\nThinking about the size of a hand-held calculator, a meter (about the length of a baseball bat) is too large, or a unit and millimeters (about the width of the tip of a pencil) are too small.\n\n3Write down the most reasonable choice.\n\nCentimeters (each about the width of a fingernail) is the most appropriate unit to measure the width of a hand-held calculator.\n\nStill stuck?\n\nAt Third Space Learning, we specialize in helping teachers and school leaders to provide personalized math support for more of their students through high-quality, online one-on-one math tutoring delivered by subject experts.\n\nEach week, our tutors support thousands of students who are at risk of not meeting their grade-level expectations, and help accelerate their progress and boost their confidence.\n\nFind out how we can help your students achieve success with our math tutoring programs."
