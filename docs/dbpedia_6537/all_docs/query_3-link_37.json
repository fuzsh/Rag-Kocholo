        "text": "by Dennis Silverman\n\nU. C. Irvine, Physics and Astronomy\n\nEnergy Units and Conversions\n\n1 Joule (J) is the MKS unit of energy, equal to the force of one Newton acting through one meter.\n\n1 Watt is the power of a Joule of energy per second\n\nPower = Current x Voltage (P = I V)\n\n1 Watt is the power from a current of 1 Ampere flowing through 1 Volt.\n\n1 kilowatt is a thousand Watts.\n\n1 kilowatt-hour is the energy of one kilowatt power flowing for one hour. (E = P t).\n\n1 kilowatt-hour (kWh) = 3.6 x 106 J = 3.6 million Joules\n\n1 calorie of heat is the amount needed to raise 1 gram of water 1 degree Centigrade.\n\n1 calorie (cal) = 4.184 J\n\n(The Calories in food ratings are actually kilocalories.)\n\nA BTU (British Thermal Unit) is the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water by 1 degree Farenheit (F).\n\n1 British Thermal Unit (BTU) = 1055 J (The Mechanical Equivalent of Heat Relation)\n\n1 BTU = 252 cal = 1.055 kJ\n\n1 Quad = 1015 BTU (World energy usage is about 300 Quads/year, US is about 100 Quads/year in 1996.)\n\n1 therm = 100,000 BTU\n\n1,000 kWh = 3.41 million BTU\n\nPower Conversion\n\n1 horsepower (hp) = 745.7 watts\n\nGas Volume to Energy Conversion\n\nOne thousand cubic feet of gas (Mcf) -> 1.027 million BTU = 1.083 billion J = 301 kWh\n\nOne therm = 100,000 BTU = 105.5 MJ = 29.3 kWh\n\n1 Mcf -> 10.27 therms\n\nEnergy Content of Fuels\n\nCoal 25 million BTU/ton\n\nCrude Oil 5.6 million BTU/barrel\n\nOil 5.78 million BTU/barrel = 1700 kWh / barrel\n\nGasoline 5.6 million BTU/barrel (a barrel is 42 gallons) = 1.33 therms / gallon\n\nNatural gas liquids 4.2 million BTU/barrel\n\nNatural gas 1030 BTU/cubic foot\n\nWood 20 million BTU/cord\n\nCO2 Pollution of Fossil Fuels\n\nPounds of CO2 per billion BTU of energy::\n\nCoal 208,000 pounds\n\nOil 164,000 pounds\n\nNatural Gas 117,000 pounds\n\nRatios of CO2 pollution:\n\nOil / Natural Gas = 1.40\n\nCoal / Natural Gas = 1.78\n\nPounds of CO2 per 1,000 kWh, at 100% efficiency:\n\nCoal 709 pounds\n\nOil 559 pounds\n\nNatural Gas 399 pounds"
