Seven dimensions of the world Fundamental quantities Length Mass Time Temperature Current Amount of substance Luminous intensity Dimensions [L] [M] [T] [K] [A] [N] [J]\n\n42. Dimensions of a physical quantity The powers of fundamental quantities in a derived quantity are called dimensions of that quantity.\n\n43. = Mass length × breath × height [Density] = [M] L × L × L = [M] L3 = [ML−3 ] Dimensions of a physical quantity Density = Mass Volume Example: Hence the dimensions of density are 1 in mass and − 3 in length.\n\n44. Uses of Dimension To check the correctness of equation To convert units To derive a formula\n\n45. To check the correctness of equation ∆x = displacement = [L] Consider the equation of displacement, By writing the dimensions we get, vit = velocity × time = length time × time = [L] at2 = acceleration × time2 = length time2 × time2 = [L] The dimensions of each term are same, hence the equation is dimensionally correct. ∆x = vit + 1 2 a t2\n\n46. To convert units Let us convert newton SI unit of force into dyne CGS unit of force . The dimesions of force are = [LMT−2 ] So, 1 newton = (1 m)(1 kg)(1 s)−2 and, 1 dyne = (1 cm)(1 g)(1 s)−2 Thus, 1 newton 1 dyne = 1 m 1 cm 1 kg 1 g 1 s 1 s −2 = 100 cm 1 cm 1000 g 1 g 1 s 1 s −2 = 100 × 1000 = 105 Therefore, 1 newton = 105 dyne\n\n47. To derive a formula The time period ‘T’ of oscillation of a simple pendulum depends on length ‘l’ and acceleration due to gravity ‘g’. Let us assume that, T ∝ 𝑙a 𝑔b or T = K 𝑙a 𝑔b K = constant which is dimensionless Dimensions of T = [L0M0T1] Dimensions of 𝑙 = [L1 M0 T0 ] Dimensions of g = [L1M0T−2] Thus, L0M0T1 = K [L1M0T0]a [L1M0T−2]b = K LaM0T0 LbM0T−2b L0M0T1 = K La+bM0T−2b a + b = 0 & − 2b = 1 ∴ b = − 1 2 & a = 1 2 T = K 𝑙1/2 𝑔−1/2 ∴ T = K 𝑙 𝑔\n\n48. Least count of instruments The smallest value that can be measured by the measuring instrument is called its least count or resolution.\n\n49. LC of length measuring instruments Ruler scale Least count = 1 mm Vernier Calliper Least count = 0.1 mm\n\n50. LC of length measuring instruments Screw Gauge Least count = 0.01 mm Spherometer Least count = 0.001 mm\n\n51. LC of mass measuring instruments Weighing scale Least count = 1 kg Electronic balance Least count = 1 g\n\n52. LC of time measuring instruments Wrist watch Least count = 1 s Stopwatch Least count = 0.01 s\n\n53. Accuracy of measurement It refers to the closeness of a measurement to the true value of the physical quantity. Example: • True value of mass = 25.67 kg • Mass measured by student A = 25.61 kg • Mass measured by student B = 25.65 kg • The measurement made by student B is more accurate.\n\n54. Precision of measurement It refers to the limit to which a physical quantity is measured. Example: • Time measured by student A = 3.6 s • Time measured by student B = 3.69 s • Time measured by student C = 3.695 s • The measurement made by student C is most precise.\n\n55. Significant figures The total number of digits (reliable digits + last uncertain digit) which are directly obtained from a particular measurement are called significant figures.\n\n56.

Rules for counting significant figures 4 Terminal zeros that are also to the right of a decimal point in a number are significant. Number 64.00 3.60 25.060 Significant figures 4 3 5\n\n62. Rules for counting significant figures 5 If the number is less than 1, all zeroes before the first non-zero digit are not significant.

Rules for counting significant figures Number 2.700 m 2.700 x 10 2 cm 2.700 x 10 −3 km Significant figures 4 4 4\n\n64. Exact numbers • Exact numbers are either defined numbers or the result of a count. • They have infinite number of significant figures because they are reliable. By definition 1 dozen = 12 objects 1 hour = 60 minute 1 inch = 2.54 cm By counting 45 students 5 apples 6 faces of cube\n\n65. Rules for rounding off a measurement 1 If the digit to be dropped is less than 5, then the preceding digit is left unchanged. Number 64.62 3.651 546.3 Round off up to 3 digits 64.6 3.65 546\n\n66. 2 If the digit to be dropped is more than 5, then the preceding digit is raised by one. Number 3.479 93.46 683.7 Round off up to 3 digits 3.48 93.5 684 Rules for rounding off a measurement\n\n67. 3 If the digit to be dropped is 5 followed by digits other than zero, then the preceding digit is raised by one. Number 62.354 9.6552 589.51 Round off up to 3 digits 62.4 9.66 590 Rules for rounding off a measurement\n\n68. 4 If the digit to be dropped is 5 followed by zero or nothing, the last remaining digit is increased by 1 if it is odd, but left as it is if even. Number 53.350 9.455 782.5 Round off up to 3 digits 53.4 9.46 782 Rules for rounding off a measurement\n\n69. Significant figures in calculations Addition & subtraction The final result would round to the same decimal place as the least precise number. Example: • 13.2 + 34.654 + 59.53 = 107.384 = 107.4 • 19 – 1.567 - 14.6 = 2.833 = 3\n\n70. Significant figures in calculations Multiplication & division The final result would round to the same number of significant digits as the least accurate number. Example: • 1.5 x 3.67 x 2.986 = 16.4379 = 16 • 6.579/4.56 = 1.508 = 1.51\n\n71. Errors in measurement Difference between the actual value of a quantity and the value obtained by a measurement is called an error. Error = actual value – measured value\n\n72. Types of errors Systematic errors Gross errors Random errors\n\n73. 1. Systematic errors • These errors are arise due to flaws in experimental system. • The system involves observer, measuring instrument and the environment. • These errors are eliminated by detecting the source of the error.\n\n74. Types of systematic errors Personal errors Instrumental errors Environmental errors\n\n75. a. Personal errors These errors are arise due to faulty procedures adopted by the person making measurements. Parallax error\n\n76. b. Instrumental errors These errors are arise due to faulty construction of instruments. Zero error\n\n77. c. Environmental errors These errors are caused by external conditions like pressure, temperature, magnetic field, wind etc. Following are the steps that one must follow in order to eliminate the environmental errors: a. Try to maintain the temperature and humidity of the laboratory constant by making some arrangements. b. Ensure that there should not be any external magnetic or electric field around the instrument.\n\n79. 2. Gross errors These errors are caused by mistake in using instruments, recording data and calculating results. Example: a. A person may read a pressure gauge indicating 1.01 Pa as 1.10 Pa. b. By mistake a person make use of an ordinary electronic scale having poor sensitivity to measure very low masses. Careful reading and recording of the data can reduce the gross errors to a great extent.\n\n80. 3. Random errors • These errors are due to unknown causes and are sometimes termed as chance errors. • Due to unknown causes, they cannot be eliminated. • They can only be reduced and the error can be estimated by using some statistical operations.\n\n81. Error analysis For example, suppose you measure the oscillation period of a pendulum with a stopwatch five times. Trial no ( i ) 1 2 3 4 5 Measured value ( Xi ) 3.9 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.5\n\n82. Mean value The average of all the five readings gives the most probable value for time period. X = 1 n Xi X = 3.9 + 3.5 + 3.6 + 3.7 + 3.5 5 = 18.2 5 X = 3.64 = 3.6\n\n83. Absolute error The magnitude of the difference between mean value and each individual value is called absolute error. ∆Xi = X − Xi Xi 3.9 3.5 3.6 3.7 3.5 ∆Xi 0.3 0.1 0 0.1 0.1 The absolute error in each individual reading:\n\n84. Mean absolute error The arithmetic mean of all the absolute errors is called mean absolute error. ∆X = 1 n ∆Xi ∆X = 0.3 + 0.1 + 0 + 0.1 + 0.1 5 = 0.6 5 ∆X = 0.12 = 0.1\n\n85. Reporting of result • The most common way adopted by scientist and engineers to report a result is: Result = best estimate ± error • It represent a range of values and from that we expect a true value fall within. • Thus, the period of oscillation is likely to be within (3.6 ± 0.1) s.\n\n86. Relative error The relative error is defined as the ratio of the mean absolute error to the mean value. relative error = ∆X / X ∆X / X = 0.1 3.6 = 0.0277 ∆X / X = 0.028\n\n87. Percentage error The relative error multiplied by 100 is called as percentage error. percentage error = relative error x 100 percentage error = 0.028 x 100 percentage error = 2.8 %\n\n88. Least count error Least count error is the error associated with the resolution of the instrument. • The least count error of any instrument is equal to its resolution. • Thus, the length of pen is likely to be within (4.7 ± 0.1) cm.\n\n89. Combination of errors • Let ∆A be absolute error in measurement of A • Let ∆B be absolute error in measurement of B • Let ∆X be absolute error in measurement of X In different mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication and division the errors are combined according to some rules.\n\n90. When X = A ± B ∆X X = ∆A+∆B A ± B ∆X = ∆A + ∆B\n\n91. When X = A × B or A / B ∆X X = ∆A A + ∆B B ∆X = ∆A A + ∆B B X\n\n92. When X = An ∆X X = n ∆A A ∆X = n ∆A A X\n\n93. Estimation Estimation is a rough calculation to find an approximate value of something that is useful for some purpose.\n\n94. Estimate the number of flats in Dubai city\n\n95. Estimate the volume of water stored in a dam\n\n96. Order of magnitude The approximate size of something expressed in powers of 10 is called order of magnitude.\n\n97. To get an approximate idea of the number, one may round the coefficient a to 1 if it is less than or equal to 5 and to 10 if it is greater than 5. Examples: • Mass of electron = 9.1 x 10 −31 kg ≈ 10 x 10 −31 kg ≈ 10 −30 kg • Mass of observable universe = 1.59 x 10 53 kg ≈ 1 x 10 53 kg ≈ 10 53 kg"
