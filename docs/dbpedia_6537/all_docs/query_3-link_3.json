        "text": "The International System of Units (SI): Base units\n\nBase quantity Base unit Name Typical symbol Name Symbol time t second s length l, x, r, etc. metre m mass m kilogram kg electric current I, i ampere A thermodynamic temperature T kelvin K amount of substance n mole mol luminous intensity Iv candela cd\n\nAll other SI units can be derived from these, by multiplying together different powers of the base units.\n\nIn the 2018 revision of the SI, the definitions of four of the SI base units – the kilogram, the ampere, the kelvin and the mole – were changed. Their new definitions are based on fixed numerical values of the Planck constant (h), the elementary charge (e), the Boltzmann constant (k), and the Avogadro constant (NA), respectively.\n\nFurther, the definitions of all seven base units of the SI are now uniformly expressed using the explicit-constant formulation. Specific mises en pratique have been drawn up to explain the realization of the definitions of each of the base units in a practical way."
