A setting of 0 effectively renders the line invisible.\n\nStyle: Determines the line pattern. In addition, there are several advanced line styles and you can create Custom Line Styles, if desired.\n\nStart and End: Controls the appearance of the endpoints for each side of the line. The diagram below shows samples of each type of endpoint.\n\nEach endpoint has an associated Scale that determines the size of the endpoint in relation to the Line Width. By default, it is set to Auto and will automatically adjust as the Line Width is changed.\n\nShow Caption: Select to include caption text on the markup. Click Edit to choose which measurements to include.\n\nShow Caption Leader Line: Select to show the leader line to the caption.\n\nFont: Sets the font used for the selected text. Available fonts are divided into three regions:\n\nThe first region shows all fonts used in the currently selected text element.\n\nThe second region lists the standard PDF fonts that are supported by all PDF viewers. These fonts do not need to be embedded in the PDF when used, thereby cutting down on file size.\n\nThe third shows all other available fonts. When used, these fonts need to be embedded in the PDF.\n\nNote: If you attempt to embed a font for which the viewing and editing permissions do not allow formatting, Revu will display a message indicating the font will not be embedded in the PDF.\n\nFont parameters are retained in the PDF such that even if the original font is not embedded or on the viewer's workstation, a suitable representation of the font will be substituted.\n\nFont Size: Sets the size of the font. While the list shows sizes ranging from 2 to 72, font sizes between 1 to 144 points are supported; just enter the desired size manually. Also, values with up to one digit after the decimal point can be used.\n\nText Color: Sets the color of text."
