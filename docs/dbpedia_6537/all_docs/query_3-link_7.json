        "text": "The globally-agreed system of measurement units was formally named the 'International System of Units' (SI) in 1960. The SI covers units for every type of measurement, but at the heart of the SI is a set of seven units known as the ‘base units’.\n\nkilogram (kg) Unit of mass metre (m) Unit of length second (s) Unit of time ampere (A) Unit of electric current kelvin (K) Unit of thermodynamic temperature mole (mol) Unit of amount of substance candela (cd) Unit of luminous intensity\n\nThis International System of Units is necessary to ensure that our everyday measurements remain comparable and consistent worldwide. Standardising such measurements not only helps to keep them consistent and accurate, but also helps society have confidence in data. For instance, mass is measured every day, and having agreement on the definition of the kilogram means that consumers can trust that the shop is really providing the mass they say they are. Equally, having reliable information on climate change, pollution and medical diagnostics is important to society and builds trust, allowing effective decisions to be made.\n\nFind out more about the redefinition of the SI units\n\nIn November 2022, measurement scientists and government representatives from around the world voted to expand the range of prefixes used within the International System of Units, meaning that four new prefixes, (which were proposed by NPL's Head of Metrology, Richard Brown) will now be used to express measurements worldwide.\n\nFind out more about the expansion of the SI prefixes here\n\nHistorically, units of measurement were defined by physical objects or properties of materials. For example, the metre was defined by the length between lines engraved on a metal bar and the kilogram was defined as the mass of a single cylinder of platinum-iridium metal – the International Prototype of the Kilogram (IPK).\n\nIn these two examples, the definition was also the realisation – the physical form – of the unit. However, such physical representations can change over time and are susceptible to damage or loss. So, over the years, the definitions have evolved to depend instead on constants of nature that are more stable and reproducible, meeting the demanding needs of today’s research and technological applications.\n\nDuring the last century, scientists measured constants of nature, such as the speed of light and the Planck constant, with increasing accuracy. They discovered that these were far more stable than physical objects. It became clear that these constants of nature could offer a new and more stable foundation for the SI.\n\nFind out about our current research on SI units\n\nWe welcome the opportunity to deliver technical lectures on metrology and SI units at universities and other organisations, please contact us to discuss your requirements.\n\nThere are certain non-SI units, which are accepted for use with the SI. These include units which are in continuous everyday use, in particular the traditional units of time and of angle, together with a few other units which have assumed increasing technical importance and those needed for commercial, legal and specialist scientific interests or for the interpretation of older texts.\n\nNon-SI units accepted for use with the International System\n\nName Symbol Value in SI Units\n\nminute\n\nmin\n\n1 min = 60 s\n\nhour (1)\n\nh\n\n1 h = 60 min = 3600 s\n\nday\n\nd\n\n1 d = 24 h = 86 400 s\n\ndegree of arc (2)\n\n°\n\n1° = (π/180) rad\n\nminute of arc\n\n′\n\n1′ = (1/60)° = (π/10 800) rad\n\nminute of plane angle\n\n′\n\n1′ = (1/60)° = (π/10 800) rad\n\nsecond of arc\n\n″\n\n1″ = (1/60)' = (π/648 000) rad\n\nlitre (3)\n\nl, L\n\n1 l = 1 dm3 = 10-3 m3\n\ntonne (4, 5)\n\nt\n\n1 t = 103 kg\n\ntonne (4, 5)\n\nt\n\n1 t = 103 kg\n\nneper\n\nNp\n\n1 Np = 1\n\nbel\n\nB\n\n1 B = (1/2) ln 10 (Np)(9)\n\nThe neper and the bel are units of logarithmic ratio quantities. In using these units it is important that the nature of the quantity be specified and that any reference value used be specified.\n\nMore information on the SI can be found on the BIPM website (https://www.bipm.org/en/measurement-units)."
