        "text": "What is a measuring unit?\n\nA measuring unit is a standard quantity used to express a physical quantity. Let us learn about the physical quantities and some of the standard units used to measure them.\n\nThe Physical quantities are further classified into 4 types:\n\n1. Lengths of given objects\n\n2. Weights of given objects\n\n3. Money\n\n4. Time\n\n1. Lengths of given objects\n\nLength describes how long a thing is from one end to the other. Length is used to identify the size of the object or a distance from one point to another.\n\nMetric Unit US Standard Unit (English Unit or Customary Unit) Millimetre (mm): Used to measure very short lengths or thicknesses.\n\nExample: length of a pen tip. Inch (in): Used to measure the length of small objects.\n\nExample: Length of a rod. Centimetre (cm): Used to measure small lengths.\n\nExample: Length of a pen. Foot (ft): Used to measure short distances and heights.\n\nExample: Heights of buildings. Meter (m): Used to measure big lengths.\n\nExample: Length of a classroom. Yard (yd): It is bigger than a foot.\n\nExample: Length of a football field. Kilometre (km): Used to measure very long lengths or distance.\n\nExample: Distance between two places. Mile (mi): Used to measure long distances.\n\nExample: Distance between two places.\n\nThe object can be differentiated or compared by its length.\n\nHereâ€™s an image showing 3cm length.\n\nThe above example is an illustration of how the object is compared by its length.\n\nHere are few conversions of length:\n\n1. 1 km = 1000m\n\n2. 1m = 100 cm. 1cm = 10mm\n\n2. Weights of given objects\n\nMetric Unit US Standard Unit (English Unit or Customary Unit) Millimetre (mm): Used to measure very light things.\n\nExample: Medicines Ounce (oz): Used to measure small quantities.\n\nExample: Bread. Gram (g): Used to measure small things.\n\nExample: Potato Pound (lb): Used to measure body weight, etc.\n\nExample: Bread Kilogram (kg): Used to measure heavy things.\n\nExample: Bodyweight.\n\nTon: Used to measure much heavier things.\n\nExample: Trucks and heavy load\n\nMeasuring Units-PDF\n\nCuemathâ€™s learning platform has carefully designed simulations to help the student visualize concepts. This blog will help us understand about the measuring units. Here is a downloadable PDF to explore more.\n\nðŸ“¥ Measuring Units-PDF\n\nDownload\n\nHere are few conversions of weight:\n\n1. 1 kg = 1000 grams.\n\n2. 1 gram = 1000 milligrams.\n\n3. 1 gram = (1/1000) kg.\n\n4. 1 milligram = (1/1000) gram.\n\nThe object can be compared with its weight.\n\nThe above example is an illustration of how an object is compared by its weight.\n\nNote: The heavier object weighs down.\n\nCountry\n\nUS Standard Unit (English Unit or Customary Unit)\n\nIndia\n\nIndian Rupees.\n\nUnited States\n\nUnited States Dollars.\n\nUnited Kingdom.\n\nPound.\n\nJapan\n\nJapanese Yen.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralian dollar.\n\nRussia\n\nRussian Rouble.\n\nHere are few currency conversions:\n\nOne U.S Dollar = 74.74 rupee.\n\nOne Pound = 96.97 rupee.\n\nOne Rupee = 1.40 Japanese yen.\n\nAccording to Indian currency:\n\nâ‚¹1 = 100 paisa\n\n1 paisa = (1/100) rupee\n\n4. Time\n\nThe ongoing sequence of events is time.\n\nThe basic unit of time is the second.\n\nThere are also minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years.\n\nMetric Units and US Standard Unit are the same for the time\n\nSecond (s)\n\nMinute (min)\n\nHour (hr)\n\nDay\n\nWeek\n\nMonth\n\nYea\n\nWhereas,\n\n1 year = 12 months\n\n1 month = 4 weeks approx.\n\n1 week = 7days.\n\n1 day = 24 hours.\n\n1 hour = 60 minutes\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds.\n\nMeasuring units is a basic concept which we come across in our daily life. Teaching kids about the measuring unit such as length, weight, money and time give them a good idea and will let the kid explore more.\n\nIt gives a proper image to the kids in comparing the objects based on the units because kids must understand the importance of measurement and be familiar with their use in everyday life. It is an essential life skill.\n\nExternal References\n\nAbout Cuemath"
