        "text": "Final Cut Pro X quits whenever I attempt to import footage from a recent film shoot. This is the first time I've used the Sony FX6 shooting XMF.\n\nI've attempted to import each file separately and have isolated the files which crash the import (i've highlighted these in blue in the screenshots)\n\nHOWEVER, I am 100% sure these files are not corrupt as they open in Quicktime and Da Vinci Resolve.\n\nHalf of the offending files will open in Compressor, the other half will not.\n\nCrash Log attached:\n\nScreenshots attached below\n\nAny helpful suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nI'm on\n\nFCPX 10.5.2\n\nMac OS 11.4\n\n2019 16-Inch MacBook Pro\n\nWhenever there is a crash, don't forget to delete preferences - they tend to become corrupted, and that may cause further crashes.\n\nTo delete preferences, hold down command and option while starting FCP X and click Delete Preferences. The application will start in a default state, and open an \"Untitled\" library. Reopen the library you were working on, set the preferences the way you like them, and try again.\n\nAre you copying to the library or leaving in place? Where is the library stored?\n\nDoes FCP have Full Disk Access in System Preferences->Security & Privacy->Privacy?\n\nThere is likely to be some subtle issue with the file that is not noticeable in other applications but that FCP stumbles on.\n\nBut there also some serious issues that the Etrecheck report brings to light and that could cause you other problems down the road. I think you should address them sooner rather than later.\n\n1) Your drive is essentially FULL. 50GB out of 2TB. This causes performance issues and as available space fluctuates a lot there is a chance that at some point you run out of space altogether, crashing your mac. Always leave some 10-15% or more free.\n\n2) System security updates are disabled, and Gatekeeper is set to \"everywhere\".\n\n2a)You do NOT need to set Gatekeeper this way, even if you want to run some unsigned applications.\n\nAll you need is to control-click and choose \"Open\" the very first time you launch an application.\n\n2b) Go to System Preferences->Software Update, click Advanced and CHECK \"install system data files and security updates\"\n\nYou obviously have migrated from a previous mac, as your system has lots of old stuff, many of those very old and deprecated years ago. This can cause many issues, especially since some of these things modify the system at a rather low level.\n\n3) Launchd: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.bittorrent.uTorrent.plist Executable: /Applications/uTorrent.app\n\nWhy do you have this running all the time?\n\n4) Many of these plugins and preference panes are OLD. Flip4mac, Silverlight....\n\nand PERIAN - this has been obsoleted more than 5 years ago.\n\nPlugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/PMCADownloader.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/ContentUploaderPlugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/NPVirtools.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Flip4Mac WMV Plugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/RealPlayer Plugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/AdobePDFViewerNPAPI.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/DivXBrowserPlugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/Silverlight.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/SharePointBrowserPlugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/AdobePDFViewer.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/EPPEX Plugin.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/eMusic.plugin Plugin: /Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JoostPlugin.plugin Preference Pane: /Library/PreferencePanes/Flip4Mac WMV.prefPane Preference Pane: /Library/PreferencePanes/Perian.prefPane\n\nthe problem is not with editing, I can edit all projects I have but since it start to export \"share\" it shut down .. I have the 11.5.3 version two days ago and since that I cant done any projects. even the latest projects I already done I cant export them again . I people in Apple read this and try to solve our problem before they lost more people swich to other application ."
