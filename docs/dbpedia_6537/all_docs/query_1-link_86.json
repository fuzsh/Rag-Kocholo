And then how do i apply it to a random sentence to extract the information?\n\nThanks in advance for all the help!\n\nIf you run the following command:\n\nRSiteSearch('hidden markov model')\n\nThen it finds 4 Task Views, 40 Vignettes, and 255 functions (when I ran it, there could be more by the time you run it).\n\nI would suggest looking through those results (probably start with the views and vignettes) to see if anything there works for you. If not, then tell us what you have tried and what you need that is not provided there.\n\nanswered Jul 17, 2013 at 14:48\n\nGreg SnowGreg Snow\n\n49.3k66 gold badges8585 silver badges112112 bronze badges"
