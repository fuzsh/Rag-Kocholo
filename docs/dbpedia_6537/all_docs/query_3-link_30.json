The letter “x” can be any number from 1 to 8 to show whether you are multiplying by 10, 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000 etc. In this case it would be 2.0 x 104 – ie 2.0 x 10,000.\n\nUsing a log scale this would be 4.3 log10 copies/mL.\n\nConversion table between viral load as numbers and logs.\n\nLast updated: 16 September 2016."
