        "text": "Introducing the Confluence Universe: Where Innovation Meets Entertainment At the Confluence Universe, we're not just building games; we're crafting immersive worlds that transcend the boundaries of traditional gaming. As a leading blockchain gaming company, we're harnessing the power of generative AI to revolutionize the development process and deliver unparalleled experiences to our community. Generative AI: Our Secret Weapon By integrating generative AI into our development pipeline, we're able to create dynamic, ever-evolving worlds that adapt to player behavior and preferences. Cross-Platform Web3 Gaming Ecosystem Our Web3 gaming ecosystem is a true game-changer. With seamless portability of scores, inventory, and currencies across PC, mobile, and VR platforms, we're breaking down barriers and creating a unified gaming experience like never before. Whether you're exploring on your desktop, battling foes on your phone, or diving into virtual reality, your progress and achievements are always with you. Substance, Quality, and Innovation We're not just another blockchain gaming company; we're a team of passionate visionaries dedicated to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the gaming world. Our commitment to substance, quality, and innovation shines through in every aspect of our games, from the captivating storylines to the cutting-edge technology powering them. Impressive Stats Our Web3 Gaming ecosystem now boasts over 300 games, game modes and levels and our VR SimSuite will reach an astonishing 1,000 games, game modes and levels by this fall, primed for a mass market release of a VR Title with over 60 hours of gameplay. We own over 40 NFT collections, with 3 of them in the All-Time, All-Chain, All-Category Opensea Top 50 and 8 in the Top 150. We've rescued more NFT projects than any other company in the space. We primary minted over 20,000 NFTs pre-chain through direct sales and raised our floors in the worst market while the vast majority of other projects saw their holders' asset values decline over 90%. Join the Confluence Universe and embark on a journey where the only limit is your imagination. #ConfluenceUniverse #BlockchainGaming #GenerativeAI #Web3 #CrossPlatformGaming\n\nThis week I will begin shipping out 26 physical works of art as RWA rewards to minters of our #EternalGardens #Web4 Collection, with 50+ works on the waiting list to be completed and shipped after these initial shipments. These represent my 868th through 893rd original works of art sold since January of 2017. The #Confluence has been one of the best performing #Web3 companies over the past 16 months by far and by many metrics. In the worst market in the short history of NFT's we have: - held all of our floors and mostly doubled, tripled, quadrupled and even 5x'ed some of them - rescued 16 Legacy Collections from previous founders who could not sustain the projects or fulfill roadmaps for their holders - grown from just 200 members 16 months ago to over 800k on X and Discord combined at ZERO user acquisition cost and NEVER paying influencers - minted over 20k+ NFT's all pre-chain (meaning we did not need to go to a public mint) including over 5k 1/1 custom requested works of digital art for our holders - gave out more rewards to our holders than was taken in at mint (over 300k USD value and counting) - maintained a very low cost range of entry into our ecosystem for the masses starting as low as $3, with most falling in the $30-70 USD range, but some as high as 1 ETH (for which you get a massive Bounty package including the physical artwork worth more than the mint price) - built the first truly cross-platform Web3 Gaming Metaversian ecosystem with portability of scores, inventory and currencies across PC, mobile and VR - coded over 50 smart contracts, 20 minting Dapps involving complex migrations and custom choice selections for our holders and many completely proprietary Web3 Gaming integrations - created the first ever #Web4 project called Eternal Gardens harnassing artificial intelligence in developing our virtual environments for our users - built what is arguably the largest #Web3Gaming ecosystem with over 300+ playable now levels across PC, mobile and VR, on track to hit 1,000+ levels by October - 3 Collections in the Top 50 OS Gaming charts and 8 in the Top 150, All-Time, All-Category, All-Chain with over 32,000 ETH in secondary sales, all the more impressive since the bulk of our sales over the past 16 months are done pre-chain - did all this and more with a team of 5 highly skilled professionals\n\nJoin us in #Web4, powered by arguably the most successful company in all of #Web3 this past year, returning an average 3x to early adopters and this in the absolute worst market while most all other projects including industry darlings tanked over 80%. The #Confluence is a company that NEVER gouged a single holder, but instead rescued 25,000 OG holders from #Web3 oblivion, building a massive #Web3Gaming and experiential Universe that surpasses all others in the space and which has now led to the advent of #Web4 with its #EternalGardens project. Drawing on our expertise in experiential VR and machine learning and bolstered by over 3 years of building out and testing real-world, deployed-now products with a community of support from our Discord, X and other socials growing from 200 members to 800k+ in the past 12 months, the #Confluence leads the field in so many metrics. A profitable, cash-flow positive startup with traction and 5 major products entering monetization at the forefront of #Web3 and literally, the creators of #Web4, we are currently entertaining a Seed Round from early-stage investors, although we are actually well beyond Seed in terms of status, capability and performance of the company. For individuals who enjoy collecting NFT's of significant value and utility, join #EternalGardens and get an incredible Presale Mint Package Bounty which includes 5 #Confluence assets as well as a physical painting from one of Canada's Top Ten living artists in terms of volume and hammer prices. .Join us, pick up an #EternalGardens Presale Mint Package and download our Universe at theConfluence.World Congratulations to the first 12 Minters of #Web4 assets featured below! You have made history!\n\nThe #Confluence introduces the advent of #Web4 with its #EternalGardens Campaign. #ReadWriteOwnTrain Eternal Gardens is not just another project in the vast universe of Web3 and virtual reality; it is the next evolutionary step—Web4. Building on the solid foundation laid by The Confluence Universe, we are pioneering an experience that merges the best of Web3 gaming and virtual reality with generative AI and machine learning. Our journey has been one of innovation, determination, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. Our fusion of technologies enables a new level of user interaction and personalization, making every experience unique and tailored to the individual's preferences. The Confluence Universe has always been at the forefront of Web3 infrastructure. Our extensive experience in developing dynamic collections and constantly evolving gaming ecosystems has set the stage for the next big leap. Our pioneering efforts in Web3 gaming, multi-player, multi-game, and multi-device experiences have established a comprehensive platform for virtual commerce and branding. By integrating blockchain, NFTs, virtual reality, and AI, we have developed a platform where users can truly own and personalize their digital experiences. The Confluence community has always been a driving force behind our success. Their feedback, support, and engagement have been instrumental in shaping our vision and guiding our development. With Eternal Gardens, we are taking this community-driven approach to the next level, inviting users to actively participate in the creation and evolution of their virtual experiences, where users are not just passive participants; they are active creators and owners of their digital worlds. We invite you to join us on this exciting journey and be a part of the future of Web4. Eternal Gardens is more than just a project; it is a vision for the future of digital interaction. By combining the best of Web3 and Web4 technologies, we are creating a platform where users can truly harness the power of innovation. Become a community member, owner, user, holder and/or creator by joining us in the #Confluence through investment in Eternal Gardens the company or by becoming a holder of one of our beautiful NFT's as pictured here. There are many Mint Packages available, some of which include a physical work of art from the founder, an international award-winning abstract artist and one of Canada's Top Ten living artists. The Confluence owns 40+ Legacy NFT Collections, 100+ trademarks, with over $112 million USD in secondary sales, ranking 80th All-Time, All-Category, All Chain worldwide. They have built arguably the biggest Metaversian #Web3Gaming infrastructure with over 100+ playable now #Web3 Games and Virtual Experiences with an additional 160 game-level VR SimSuite also playable now and are rolling out 5 main products simultaneously for monetization this year.\n\nExtended Life in the Metaverse for the Masses. It's here. Eternal Gardens. Our team embarked on a journey last year to create the infrastructure for what others called an interoperable Metaverse. What many didn't realize, but which we did, was that it would be extremely difficult to bring together the hundreds of companies who all wanted to lead this sector. So what we did was bring the scale necessary into our own fold by acquiring over 40+ projects and brands featuring over 100 trademarks. We did all that in 12 months with no paid promotions or influencers, while onboarding upwards of 800k social media followers, all started from scratch from 2 small NFT Mints; the #UASO UBots (1k collection) and the #UASO Gen 1's (2k collection) that at that time only had around 200 members in our Discord. According to the All-Time, All-Chain, All-Genre rankings on OpenSea our 32,000+ ETH in secondary sales puts us in the Top 100 of all projects globally and this is absolutely remarkable considering the fact that we do most of our sales on the primary market. We now have, by far, the largest Metaversian infrastructure in Web3, with not only our 100+ in-house created Web3 Games, but experiential VR from our 160+ game in-house library already built, such as our Mindfulness Mountain experience and our building sub-verses like Dragon World utilizing our native building system known as ENVY. We have also demonstrated true cross-platform portability of in-game and on-chain currencies, game item inventory and universal scoreboards across PC, VR and mobile. With our highly experienced world-class team, experts in game dev, VR and artificial intelligence, we have built all of the components and infrastructure necessary to allow our users to extend their lives in the Metaverse through the training of a \"digital essence\" of themselves, utilizing all of our combined technologies and innovations that exist now. Not some roadmap. Now. We have the systems, the infrastructure and the expertise and we are always there to lead with new products in #Web3 integrations which allows for a myriad of new business models. The Confluence Universe has bootstrapped all of this in such a short time. It is an incredible story, so far very much under the radar, but now emerging as we enter into the monetization phase of our growth. We appreciate our many core and loyal #Web3 holders who have supported us all along. We are always open for collaborations and strategic partnerships. Investment opportunities are available in several of our #Web3 projects including Eternal Gardens and Dragon World, as well as our VR Experiential Worlds. We have packages available starting from 5 ETH up to 100 ETH. Also reach out if you are looking for a strong partner with significant #Web3 expertise and resources to assist you with your project's developmental needs.\n\nEnjoy a beautiful gameplay video of our latest update to #DragonWorld in our #Web3Gaming Universe as we prepare for our new Tower Defence gamification for our holders/players and for our next #Web3Gaming Tournament. The #Confluence is a Cross-Platform (PC, mobile, VR) Metaverse in Web 3 (most importantly, with Universal Scoreboard and Currency Portability Cross-Platform already achieved) with over 100 games, game modes and experiences playable now for free and integrated for perks, charms, buffs and loot with our 40+ NFT Collections utilizing our own proprietary Web3 integrations. We will reach 300+ games by this summer as we accelerate the development of our worlds, all created in-house by our small 5-person dev team in a period of 12 months and NOT aggregated from dozens of other 3rd party developers like our peers and competition tend to do. The #Confluence owns 40+ NFT Collections, 3 in the Top 50 All-Time in Web3 Gaming and 8 in the Top 150 All-Time. We've recently completed our Easter-themed Web3Gaming Tournament where we gave out 870k Aura Atoms, 30k $DRAGON Coin and over $20k USD in NFT's to winners on our Top 30 Scoreboard. Our games are family-friendly and we have people from 5 years old to 75 years old playing in our Universe. We are also about to launch our \"Eternal Gardens\" Experience utilizing several of our native innovations such as our ENVY Building System, Custom Avatar Creator, Generative AI Models and SimSuite Cinema, where we will Extend Virtual Life for the Masses in the Metaverse. Very few, if any other companies are as advanced as we are along this path. We are making it happen with a small team of absolute world-class experts and professionals in their fields. The #Confluence is also now actively looking to do an early-stage investment round up to one million USD, through our main vehicle or perhaps looking at segmented options including some of our individual branded experiences, such as #DragonWorld, #EternalGardens or through any number of our 40+ Brands and over 100 trademarks. We are prepared to do this through Web3 or more traditional investment methodologies. Alternatively, if your company, firm or brand is serious about the possibilities in any of the above-mentioned fields, then certainly reach out and speak with us. We have done many successful market activations and collabs and we have the infrastructure in place to vault your project immediately onto the playing field at a low cost of entry.\n\nWe've just finished tabulating our prize list and metrics for our most recent #Web3Gaming Tournament in the #Confluence and the List just went out to our holders prior to our regular weekly AMA which is always at 10 am EST on Saturdays. You can join us here: https://lnkd.in/gZvbmNbt We also hold X Spaces, LinkedIn Audio Events and many VC's in Discord. We are very excited to have hit the 1,000 registrations mark in our ecosystem, without paying any influencers or buying signups, and had many new players come to play this tournament with an average user engagement time of just under 6 hours per player over the 12 days of competition. This marks a 3x improvement over our Christmas event. Our players enjoyed our new native custom building system called #ENVY which powers not only the building in #DragonWorld, but also our Build Master experiences and many other worlds. Not only did they Hunt for DragonEggs (the subject of our new Dynamic NFT Mint coming this summer), but they also participated in the Builder's Challenge. You can see some of our community playing at these X links: https://lnkd.in/gUmrgY3r https://lnkd.in/gtKmR5rW https://lnkd.in/gjJ8N22n or on Youtube: https://lnkd.in/gZsEZgaA There are way too many links to include here! They also most of the time choose to use our native custom avatar creator to make avatars that look like them. We knew that would happen! This past week we have also acquired a treasure trove of more IP, rescuing another Legacy Collection; our first one on Solana. The prior team spent 18 months trying to get a game out. Within 3 days we have a new model and completely new game mode built and in alpha, nearly ready to release to the community and in which we will feature our last two rescued projects, the Meka Apes v Alien Fungi! This is because we have already spent the past nearly 3 years building out our own Web3Gaming infrastructure and are second to none in all of Web3. We've outbuilt the most well-funded and dev-heavy teams in the space, by far and bar none. We will be approaching 400 games and games modes in our ecosystem, natively created and built by us. NOT aggregated, like our competitors do and claim as their own. We also have a 160 game VR SimSuite already built and ready to deploy, which we are about to do. One thing important that people should note is that we do not believe in doing fancy cinematics to deceive our players. We show the real gameplay. There are people playing our games using 5-10 year old laptops! We build highly optimized games for the widest engagement possible and welcome people of all social strata. That is what Web3 Community is supposed to be about. Lots of fun! Come and see what it is all about."
