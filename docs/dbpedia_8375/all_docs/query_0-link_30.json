        "text": "THE young actor sitting down to lunch could be the next Harrison Ford. Or he could follow a less stellar path for unknowns who have been in a ''Star Wars'' movie: he could be the next Mark Hamill.\n\nCome next summer, and the release of ''Star Wars: Episode 2 Attack of the Clones,'' in which Hayden Christensen, 20, plays Anakin Skywalker (the character who becomes Darth Vader), he may earn the regard that has already inspired fan sites like ''Anakin and Amidala Erotic Fanfiction Archive (No one under 18, please)'' and the ''Hayden Christensen Estrogen Brigade.'' But first he's starring in a family drama, ''Life as a House,'' opening on Friday, that few avid ''Star Wars'' fans are likely to notice.\n\n''Life as a House'' opens with Sam (Mr. Christensen), stoned and wearing heavy eye makeup, practicing autoerotic asphyxiation in a closet. The actor, a 6-foot-1-inch natural blond who is of Italian and Swedish heritage, dyed his hair black and lost 20 pounds to play the gaunt 16-year-old Goth. ''I'm hardly recognizable in it,'' he said. (In truth, he looks like the male equivalent of Leelee Sobieski in ''My First Mister.'')\n\nAlthough he was 19 when he played the part, Mr. Christensen felt he needed to observe younger teenagers to get it right. ''All those insecurities of being 16,'' he said, ''how they'd fidget with their thumbs when they're nervous.''\n\n''Life as a House,'' a sort of ''Mr. Neurotic-and-Fatally-Ill Builds His Dream House,'' gives Sam much to be nervous about. His father (Kevin Kline) is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. His mother (Kristin Scott Thomas) has remarried and isn't even sure she likes her difficult son.\n\n''I must have interviewed 75 actors for the part of Sam,'' said Irwin Winkler, the director. But watching Mr. Christensen read with Mr. Kline, he said to himself, ''I think this guy has the stuff.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
