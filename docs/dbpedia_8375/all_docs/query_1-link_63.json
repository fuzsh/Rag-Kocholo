        "text": "Day 22: Life as a House (2001)\n\nThis movie is such a guilty pleasure for me. I love me some horror movies but every now and then I like a real touching make-you-cry-at-the-end film. This is a really touching movie. It is a father son movie which my husband loves. The film centers around a dying man trying to connect with his estranged son by taking him for the entire summer. In this time they live in basically a shack, while they build a house together. His son is not happy to stay with his dad who he does not have the best relationship with. Over the course of the film they bond and even his ex-wife cares for him again. His goal of building the house bring together everyone in his life.\n\nCast\n\nThe dad is played by Kevin Kline. Kline has been in an array of dramas and comedies. Best known for his Oscar worthy supporting role in A Fish Called Wanda (1988) He reunited with the cast for the film Fierce Creatures (1997). His ex-wife and mother of his only son is played by Kristin Scott Thomas better known from her role in British comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994). The brooding goth son is played by Hayden Christensen. His career would blow up the following year as the Star Wars movies come out. He played Anakin Skywalker. His love intrest is his dad’s neighbor’s daughter played by Donnie Darko (2001) co-star Jena Malone. Her mom is played by the super talented Mary Steenburgen. Mary has been in so many films inclusing Woody Allen’s A Midsummer Night’s Sex Comedy (1982), What’s Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Elf (2003), Step Brothers (2008), Dead of Winter (1987) and Back to the Future Part III (1990). Vampire Diaries star Ian Somerhalder plays the boyfriend of the girl and the girls mom! That is one of the most messed up parts of this whole movie.\n\nFilming Location\n\nThe majority of the movie is filmed at the house site where they are building. It is a beautiful cliff side spot overlooking the amazing ocean. They live in a shack while they build the house. You can see from some shots a lighthouse in the back. This is the Point Vicente Lighthouse in Palos Verdas in Southern California. You can see from Terranea Bluff Top Park nearby the lighthouse that there is a cliffside known as Long Point. This is where they filmed most of the movie. On an empty bluff surrounded by residential homes. This was the site of Marineland Aquarium (also known as Marineland of The Pacific) which was open from 1954 to 1987. It cost more to renovate than they expected and they just decided to sell the land. It lay abandoned for many years until they finally finished building the residential community in 2009.\n\nMarineland of the Pacific was a well known filming location. I know it from Sea Hunt but many big movies such as Pirates of the Caribbean (2003), Fun with Dick and Jane (2005), and Pearl Harbor (2001) also filmed in this spot.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe video of George and young Sam playing in the surf was shot by Kevin Kline’s wife, Phoebe Cates (Gremlins, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, I Love You To Death, Drop Dead Fred). She videotaped Kevin and their son Owen on the beach in Bermuda. (imdb)\n\nThe house was built on the edge of a hill looking over the ocean. Since they could not keep the house up, the costume designer had some people help dismantle, move, and enlarge it at Kenter Canyon school in Brentwood, California as a library which opened in 2004.\n\nThe writer, Mark Andrus, is a fan of the band Guster, and named the dog after the band and two of the characters (Ryan & Adam) after two of the band members. Two of Guster’s songs are featured in the movie. The original script called for the Guster song “All the Way up to Heaven” to be used in the “car” scene that used the Guster song “Rainy Day” instead. (imdb)\n\nIn the audio commentary of the DVD, Irwin Winkler stated that Kevin Kline lost about 25 pounds. He was also on a constant diet and had a trainer with him. But he was not sick. It’s to let the audience think George is getting sicker and sicker.\n\nHayden Christensen injured his hand while filming this movie. During the scene where George finally tells Sam that he’s dying, Christensen improvised the punching of the wall. For subsequent takes of the scene he refused to add a pad to the section of the wall he was hitting, so his knuckles were swollen and bleeding by the time the scene was finished.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nI initially watched this film to see the hot goth from the trailer. The movie really is fantastic. Kevin Kline is really funny like always but also very sweet. Hayden starts the movie off real snarky but he grows on you by the end of the movie once he gets over his teenage angst. It really is a sweet little film."
