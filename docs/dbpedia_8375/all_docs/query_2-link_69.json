        "text": "The sound designers behind the Emmy-nominated Disney+ limited series “Obi-Wan Kenobi” sat down with Variety for Artisans, presented by HBO to discuss blending the iconic voice of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) with his younger incarnation Hayden Christensen.\n\nRe-recording mixer Bonnie Wild and supervising sound editor Matthew Wood broke down the climactic battle between Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker (Christensen) and his former Jedi mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor).\n\nWood reflected on what it means to build on the legacy of this momentous franchise.\n\n“We knew that there was gonna be confrontations between two legacy characters and we want to make sure we honor what’s come before us and the legacy of [‘Star Wars’ sound designer] Ben Burtt and what he’s created here at Skywalker Sound,” Wood said. “So when you hear these things, it’s kind of like the subconscious glue that holds ‘Star Wars’ together, is the sound and the music.”\n\nIn the climactic fight scene, Obi-Wan is forced to reckon with the fact that his protégé and friend Anakin is gone and there is only Darth Vader in his place. However, in the midst of their battle, the scene shows glimpses of Christensen’s character struggling between those two identities.\n\nSound design played an essential role in this moment as Darth Vader’s cracked mask reveals what remains of his human side. His dialogue oscillates between Anakin’s natural voice and the deeper bass that comes from speaking through the mask. The “Obi-Wan” crew came up with a creative solution to merge the talents of Jones and Christensen.\n\n“This is a moment for them to have some humanity. We really wanted to make sure that Hayden Christensen’s performance came through… we had that very fragile, intimate scene there, but then in the meantime we also had the voice of James Earl jones to come through. And so we tried a really nice blend of those two moments and we found the great moments where we could start the sentence with Hayden but end it with James,” Wood explained.\n\nThough no one wins in the end, Obi-Wan and Darth Vader are constantly fighting for dominance in this tense, action-packed scene.\n\n“The exciting thing about the sounds of ‘Star Wars,’ it’s always about the blend and the balance…it’s considering who has the upperhand in each moment,” Wild explained.\n\nWild and Wood have just finished up working on the latest Disney+ “Star Wars” series “Ahsoka,” at Skywalker Sound, which is a part of George Lucas’s Skywalker Ranch."
