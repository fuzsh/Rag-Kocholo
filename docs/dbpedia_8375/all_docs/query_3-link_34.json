        "text": "Alyssa:\n\nLook, I thought I was helping you.\n\nSam:\n\nIt would help me if I could kiss you.\n\nAlyssa:\n\nNo. Look I thought we were just friends.\n\nSam:\n\nWell, what you think you know doesn't necessarily have much to do with reality. I mean I hope I'm not the first one to tell you this.\n\nRobin:\n\nOh, I dreamed about your house last night.\n\nGeorge:\n\nFinished or unfinished?\n\nRobin:\n\nNo, it was perfect George. Amazing. And so real.\n\nGeorge:\n\nDidn't you once dream that you could lick people well?\n\nRobin:\n\nThat was a dream about Sam.\n\nGeorge:\n\nOh yeah, his ear infection.\n\nRobin:\n\nMy tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.\n\nGeorge:\n\nYou think you could go in there and lick his attitude?\n\nRobin:\n\nThe antibiotics were not working and that is what I believe, George. I have a few hours before I have to pick up the boys, where will I be most useful?\n\nGeorge:\n\nYour hands or your tongue?\n\nRobin:\n\nYou're not well.\n\nSam:\n\nWhat's wrong with your back? Do you have to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you are taking are for a lot of pain. And you seem to be going though them pretty quick, that's all.\n\nGeorge:\n\nYou're not still taking any, are you?\n\nSam:\n\nNo. But I count them. In a sock isn't exactly new, you know.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI'm having a problem with cancer.\n\nSam:\n\nI don't know what that means. What kind of problem?\n\nGeorge:\n\nThe kind where there isn't any answer.\n\nSam:\n\nI still don't know what it means.\n\nGeorge:\n\nSam I wanted us to... You know, spend a few months together. Here. Sometimes things happen for a reason. Something bad to force something good.\n\nSam:\n\nSo you're dying. And you told mom today. F*** you, ok f*** you. You knew you were dying from the start?\n\nGeorge:\n\nWe're all dying from the start. I just got pushed to the head of the line.\n\nSam:\n\nBut you lied to me.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI would've lied to myself if I thought I'd believe it.\n\nSam:\n\nSo this whole thing... this whole summer, having me here, was for your sake. You selfish f***. Having me here trying to get me to like you.\n\nGeorge:\n\nNo, Sam I wasn't trying to get you to like me. I was trying to get you to love me.\n\nSam:\n\nWell, congratulations... Because you f***ing pulled it off.\n\nSam:\n\nI took some of your Vicatin.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI know. Why?\n\nSam:\n\nI like how it feels to not feel.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI know the feeling.\n\nSam:\n\nHow do you become something that you're not?\n\nGeorge:\n\nWhat would you like to be?\n\nSam:\n\nWhat I'm not.\n\nGeorge:\n\nWhat are you now?\n\nSam:\n\nI'm nothing.\n\nGeorge:\n\nThat's not true.\n\nSam:\n\nYou see, that's the thing though is that I am what I say I am.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI gave up on you.\n\nSam:\n\nNo, no if you'd given up on me I'd be in Tahoe right now.\n\nGeorge:\n\nAnd what would you be doing there right now?\n\nSam:\n\nGetting high, I guess.\n\nGeorge:\n\nIf I asked you to stop, would you?\n\nSam:\n\nI haven't used anything in two days. I'm trying.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI'm proud of you.\n\nSam:\n\nYeah, well don't be. And hide that new Daily...whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.\n\nGeorge:\n\nI held I gun up to my father’s head once. You ever think like that? He had just been yelling at my mom over, nothing, undercooked meat. I went to my room, I held the barrel right up to his ear, and then I chickened out again. Of course it was a bb gun but it still would’ve hurt like hell.\n\nSam:\n\n(takes of headphones) Are you talking?\n\nGeorge:\n\nI was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave my dad. I remember one time she made dinner for us wearing sunglasses. Remind you it was dark outside, and in. And nobody said a thing about it.\n\nSam:\n\nWhy wouldn't she just leave?\n\nGeorge:\n\nI think she was terrified to live with him but maybe even more terrified of life without him.\n\nSam:\n\nI would've killed him.\n\nGeorge:\n\nIt would have been so much better if you had. Maybe then he wouldn’t have driven drunk, killed my mom in a car crash, other women in the car. Hurt a little girl in the back seat too. You would’ve liked your grandma, she was pretty cool. I still think about that little girl, they couldn’t find her father and her mother was dead.\n\nSam:\n\nDo you ever wish you'd have done it?\n\nGeorge:\n\nWhat, killed my dad?\n\nSam:\n\n(Nods)\n\nGeorge:\n\nI loved him too much.\n\nSam:\n\nThat's weird.\n\nGeorge:\n\nYeah, I guess it is."
