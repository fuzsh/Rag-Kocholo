        "text": "Former handmaiden Sofia Coppola directed her own film released in 1999, “The Virgin Suicides,” starring Kirsten Dunst.\n\nThe sisters go to their school’s homecoming dance in one scene and one of the dates was 17-year-old Hayden Christensen. He’s pretty easy to spot on the dance floor. He had a line or two before this scene but for some reason I can’t find the clip. So you’ll have to settle for seeing him dance like a goof.\n\nCoppola’s next film was “Lost In Translation,” and a year after this film, Hayden gets cast in AOTC.\n\nTags: SW alumni"
