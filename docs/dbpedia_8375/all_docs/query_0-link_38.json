        "text": "Hayden Christensen (born April 19, 1981) is a Canadian actor and producer. He began his career on Canadian television at the age of 13, then diversified into American television in the late 1990s. He was praised for his acting as Sam in Life as a House (2001), earning Golden Globe Award and Screen Actors Guild Award nominations. Christensen gained international fame for his portrayal of Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader in the Star Wars prequel trilogy films, Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005). His honours for these films include a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Actor and the Cannes Film Festival Revelation Award. He also received critical acclaim for his portrayal of Stephen Glass in the film Shattered Glass.\n\nCareer[]\n\n1993–2005[]\n\nChristensen made his acting debut in September 1993, when, at the age of 12, he played a supporting role on the German-Canadian television series Macht Der Leidenschaft/Family Passions. The following year, he had a minor role in John Carpenter's In the Mouth of Madness. From 1995 through 1999, he appeared in several films and television series, including Harrison Bergeron, Forever Knight, Goosebumps, The Virgin Suicides, and Are You Afraid of the Dark?\n\nHe acquired wider notice while starring in Fox Family Channel's television series Higher Ground in 2000, portraying a teen who was sexually molested by his stepmother, and then turned to drugs in his despair.\n\nChristensen's critically acclaimed portrayal of a misunderstood teenager in Life as a House (2001) earned him Golden Globe and SAG Award nominations, as well as the National Board of Review's award for Breakthrough Performance of the Year. However, the performance did not receive widespread public notice. In 2002, Christensen made his London theatre debut with Jake Gyllenhaal and Anna Paquin in This Is Our Youth.\n\nHe went on to receive good reviews for 2003's Shattered Glass, which tells the true story of journalist Stephen Glass, who was discovered to be fabricating stories as a writer for The New Republicand other publications. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \"Hayden Christensen is sensational as Glass, finding the wonder boy and the weasel in a disturbed kid flying high on a fame he hasn't earned.\" In 2005, Christensen made his Broadway debut when he appeared briefly in a 10-minute play.\n\nIn 2005, he took part in the fifth annual \"24 Hour Plays\" benefit, which raises cash for nonprofit groups in the Big Apple.\n\nStar Wars[]\n\nOn May 12, 2000, Christensen announced that he would be starring as an adult Anakin Skywalker in Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones (2002) and Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith (2005), Skywalker was previously portrayed by Jake Lloyd as a child in Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999). The casting director reviewed about 1,500 other candidates before director George Lucas selected Christensen. Lucas is quoted as saying that he chose Christensen because he \"needed an actor who has that presence of the Dark Side\". This was essential to solidify the story that Lucas was trying to tell: Anakin Skywalker's fall from grace and transformation into Darth Vader.\n\nDuring the production of Revenge of the Sith, Christensen asked Lucas if a special Vader suit could be constructed to fit his own body, rather than have a different actor don one of the original sets of Vader armour worn by David Prowse. Lucas agreed, and a suit was engineered to fit Christensen's frame, even including extensions to allow for the actor to attain Vader's 6 ft 6 in (1.98 m) height. His voice as the \"robotic\" Vader, however, was dubbed over by James Earl Jones, who first made the voice famous in the original trilogy.\n\nStock footage of Christensen was used in the 2004 DVD-release edition of Return of the Jedi, where he was inserted to replace Sebastian Shaw as the force ghost of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker. This was one of the most controversial changes. Lucas wanted Anakin's inner person to return to who he was before he turned to the dark side. Christensen insisted this was done without his knowledge, an act that was confirmed by Lucasfilm itself in the featurette \"Return of the Jedi: What has changed?\" as seen on the official website to commemorate the 2006 DVDs.\n\nHis performance in both Episode II and III received generally mixed reviews by critics (earning him the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor in both films).\n\nChristensen was named in both People magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People and Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars under 25. For his performance in Episode III, he won the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.\n\nIn 2019, Christensen returned to the role of Anakin Skywalker, providing a surprise cameo of the character's voice in Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.\n\n2006–present[]\n\nBetween 2006 and 2007, he starred in Awake, with Jessica Alba, which tells the story of a man who remains awake but paralyzed during heart surgery, and co-starred in Factory Girl, opposite Sienna Miller and Guy Pearce. Christensen next co-starred with Samuel L. Jackson, Jamie Bell, and Rachel Bilson in the film Jumper, the story of a young man who discovers he has the ability to teleport; the film was released on February 14, 2008. Bilson and Christensen co-starred again in the same segment of the film New York, I Love You. Christensen appeared opposite Mischa Barton in Virgin Territory, which was released directly-to-DVD in North America on August 26, 2008. The film, based on The Decameron, is about a group of people who escape the Black Plague epidemic by hiding out in a Tuscan villa in Italy.\n\nIn October 2009, Christensen started shooting the horror film Vanishing on 7th Street, directed by Brad Anderson, with Thandie Newton and John Leguizamo. Christensen appeared in the crime drama Takers with Idris Elba and Paul Walker, released in the United States on August 27, 2010. Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey is the fourth film in which Christensen stars with Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nIn 2010, Christensen sued USA Network over allegations that they stole his idea for the TV show Royal Pains. The suit alleges that Christensen met with USA to pitch a similar series entitled Housecalls. During the meeting, Christensen alleges, he was never informed that a similar program was in development. Although a federal judge at first dismissed Christensen's lawsuit in 2011, in June 2012, the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals reversed this decision and remanded the case back to the district court for further proceedings, in what was considered a legal victory for Christensen.\n\nOn May 20, 2013, during the Cannes Film Festival, the Russian company Enjoy Movies announced the creation of Glacier Films, an alliance company with Christensen and his brother Tove. Over a three-year period, Glacier Films intends to make 11 \"micro-budget\" movies costing $1.5M each. The first project, American Heist, starring Christensen, Adrien Brody and Jordana Brewster, started filming in June 2013. It is a remake of Steve McQueen's The Great St. Louis Bank Robbery. In 2014, he starred in the American-Chinese-Canadian film Outcast, an action drama, alongside Nicolas Cage.\n\nIn 2015, Christensen starred in the film 90 Minutes in Heaven co-starring Kate Bosworth and directed by Michael Polish based on the best-selling novel by the same name. In 2015, filming began of an ureleased WW2 Nazi zombies horror movie titled Untöt, set to star Christensen. In 2017, he was in the film First Kill alongside Bruce Willis. In 2018 he appeared in the Canadian-American romantic comedy Little Italy with Emma Roberts and in the same year was in The Last Man.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nFilm Year Title Character Notes 1995 In the Mouth of Madness Paper boy No Greater Love Teddy Winfield Street Law Young John Ryan 1998 The Hairy Bird Tinka's date 1999 The Virgin Suicides Jake Hill Conley Free Fall Patrick Brennan 2001 Life as a House Sam Monroe Young Hollywood Award One to Watch – Male\n\nNational Board of Review – Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Motion Picture\n\nNominated – Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role - Motion Picture\n\nNominated – Dallas–Fort Worth Film Critics Association Award for Best Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Online Film Critics Society Award for Best Breakthrough Performance\n\nNominated – Chicago Film Critics Association Awards – Most Promising Performer 2002 Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones Anakin Skywalker Cannes Film Festival – Male Revelation\n\nGolden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Couple (shared with Natalie Portman)\n\nNominated – Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor\n\nNominated – Saturn Award – Cinescape Genre Face of the Future Award\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie Actor: Action\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie: Chemistry (shared with Natalie Portman)\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie: Liplock (shared with Natalie Portman)\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie: Male Breakout Star 2003 Shattered Glass Stephen Glass Las Palmas Film Festival – Best Actor (shared with Peter Sarsgaard)\n\nNominated – Satellite Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama 2004 Star Wars: Episode VI – Return of the Jedi Anakin Skywalker DVD re-release 2005 Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith Anakin Skywalker / Darth Vader ShoWest – Male Star of Tomorrow\n\nMTV Movie Award for Best Villain\n\nGolden Raspberry Award for Worst Supporting Actor\n\nNominated – Saturn Award – Best Actor\n\nNominated – MTV Movie Award for Best Fight (shared with Ewan McGregor)\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie Actor: Action\n\nNominated – Teen Choice Award – Choice Movie: Villain 2006 Factory Girl Billy Quinn 2007 Awake Clayton \"Clay\" Beresford, Jr. Nominated – Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Screen Combo (shared with Jessica Alba) Virgin Territory Lorenzo de Lamberti 2008 Jumper David Rice Nominated – MTV Movie Award for Best Fight (shared with Jamie Bell) 2009 New York, I Love You Ben Segment: \"Jiang Wen\" 2010 Takers AJ Nominated – Black Reel Award for Best Ensemble Vanishing on 7th Street Luke Ryder Quantum Quest: A Cassini Space Odyssey Jammer (voice) 2014 Outcast Jacob American Heist James Kelly 2015 90 Minutes in Heaven Don Piper 2015 Star Wars: The Force Awakens Anakin Skywalker Voice (archive recording) 2017 First Kill Billy 2018 The Last Man Kurt Little Italy Leo Campo 2019 Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker Anakin Skywalker Vocal cameo\n\nTelevision Year Title Role Notes 1993 Family Passions Skip McDeere Unknown episodes 1995 Love and Betrayal: The Mia Farrow Story Fletcher Television film 1995 Harrison Bergeron Eric Television film 1996 No Greater Love Teddy Winfield Television film 1996 Forever Knight Andre Episode: \"Fallen Idol\" 1997 Goosebumps Zane Episode: \"Night of the Living Dummy III\" 1999 Real Kids, Real Adventures Eli Goodner Episode: \"Paralyzed: The Eli Goodner Story\" 1999 Are You Afraid of the Dark?
