What was McGregor's initial reaction when he was cast in Star Wars? Did the new series change their perception of the Star Wars universe?",

        "text": "Well, I don't know if I'm getting\n\ninto spoiler territory here.\n\nCan I say anything that possibly\n\ngets into spoiler territory here?\n\nI'm Ewan McGregor.\n\nMy name is Hayden Christensen.\n\nMy name is Moses Ingram.\n\nI play Anakin Skywalker.\n\nI play Reba Sevander.\n\nAnd I play the part of Obi-Wan Kenobi.\n\nJedi Knight, never a Jedi master,\n\nturned Darth Vader, Lord of the Sith.\n\nI am an inquisitor.\n\nI would call myself the inquisitor actually.\n\nA very complex character.\n\nHe has a strong sort of desire for power.\n\nFierce, fiercely intelligent, and very quick on her feet.\n\nSomeone who is always listening\n\nand intent on doing what she thinks is right,\n\neven if no one else agrees with what it is that she's doing.\n\nThere's also a lot of inner conflict\n\nand there's certainly an inner sort of struggle of identity.\n\nI was living in Vancouver at the time.\n\nI was renting an apartment with a good friend of mine.\n\nHe knew that I was up for this role\n\nand I was gonna be finding out soon.\n\nI got the phone call when I was still in bed, actually.\n\nI remember coming out of the room,\n\njust like an ear-to-ear grin on my face\n\nand my roommate looked at me and he was like,\n\nis that, you know, is that smile what I think it is?\n\nAnd then, so I lit up an imaginary lightsaber, you know.\n\n[light saber buzzing]\n\nAnd immediately he got it\n\nand then he ran over to his record player\n\nand he had a a Star Wars soundtrack\n\nand he put the Star Wars soundtrack on\n\nand then he lit up his imaginary light saber\n\nand we had a whole light saber battle\n\nas we were laughing and jumping\n\nall over the couch and apartment.\n\nIt was a very exciting time for me.\n\nYeah, it was amazing time.\n\nI mean, I'd been working with Danny Boyle\n\nand I did a film with Greenaway\n\nand I'd done a certain amount of work in Britain\n\nand I very much felt like I was in a moment\n\nin British cinema\n\nand Star Wars was definitely in a different lane.\n\nI did a lot of thinking about it, a lot of research,\n\na lot of speaking to people I knew and trusted\n\nabout their opinion about it,\n\nwhether it it was the right thing to do or not.\n\nAnd then the closer I got to being cast as Obi-Wan,\n\nthe more I wanted to do it, you know.\n\nI was such a great fan of the original films as a child\n\nand I felt like I just wanted to be part of that.\n\nIf I could be part of that, then I would want to do that.\n\nI don't think I said anything, actually.\n\nIt was like one intense really long week of auditioning,\n\nand then we got to that final Zoom\n\nand I thought I was gonna have to do something else.\n\nThen Deb told me I had the job\n\nand honestly, I think I probably was like, okay, thanks.\n\nI think that's how it went.\n\nBy the time I actually heard about it,\n\nI was stoked, you know.\n\nIt was a great experience.\n\nIt was different from anything I'd done\n\nin terms of its scale.\n\nI got to work with Liam Neeson\n\nand Ahmed Best and Natalie Portman,\n\nand I had a great experience, you know, making those films.\n\nOn the original films it was the technology,\n\nthe fact that we did so much of the filming\n\non blue screen and green screen.\n\nThere were certain challenges with that.\n\nThe fact that there was so little of the environment there.\n\nIn episode two, for instance, I spent a lot of time\n\nwith some tall alien people who weren't really there.\n\nSo that was challenging as for an actor\n\nto make that all realistic.\n\nWell, this one required a lot more athleticism\n\nthan anything else.\n\nWe did about four months of training\n\nbefore we ever even hit the stage to start acting,\n\nand so it just took a lot\n\nto pull everything together in that way.\n\nI always had a tough time\n\nnot making the light saber sound effects\n\nwhen I was doing my light saber scenes,\n\njust because you're sort of,\n\nit's like muscle memory from being a kid.\n\nI always have the acting challenge\n\nof playing a younger Alec Guinness,\n\nand that's my great joy in doing this,\n\nis to feel like I'm moving towards\n\nbecoming Alec Guinness, you know.\n\nThat's always where I'm trying to do.\n\nWell, it's difficult to pinpoint a favorite scene.\n\nSome of them are so long ago.\n\nOh, it's really hard to pick just one.\n\nThere were a number of scenes that were very memorable.\n\nWorking with Hayden again was a great pleasure.\n\nTo be coming back with him after so long since we, you know,\n\n17 years after we finished episode three was great.\n\nThe first scene that we shot on the very first day,\n\nit was stepping off of our ship,\n\nand I remember thinking to myself,\n\noh my God, this is, this is huge.\n\nAnd there were like air cannons and so many people,\n\nand I think my first thought was,\n\ndon't, don't mess this up.\n\nDon't mess this up.\n\nAt the end of episode three\n\nwhen the Darth Vader helmet comes down\n\nand he's officially encapsulated in the suit,\n\nthat for me was a very big moment,\n\nand I remember that very well.\n\nOur costume designer [indistinct]\n\ndid such an amazing job building that costume.\n\nIt sort of just lends itself to making you stand\n\nin a certain way.\n\nI felt bold and I felt strong\n\nand I felt like the leader that Reva is.\n\nAt the time, it felt like sort of completion\n\nfor my journey with the character, you know.\n\nI was playing Anakin\n\nand then when he becomes Darth Vader, that's sort of, right.\n\nBut now I've gotten to come back\n\nand continue my journey with the character,\n\nbut at the time it signified that my job was done.\n\nLittle did I know.\n\nProbably the biggest thing is\n\nthat it already has millions of fans.\n\nAnd I think the thing that's daunting\n\nis that whether people like it or not,\n\nI'm absolutely gonna hear about it\n\nand that's scary.\n\nI don't know that it's changed my view of Star Wars\n\nand this character as much as it's just sort of\n\nfurther informed the story and these characters,\n\nand that was kind of what was really appealing\n\nabout it for me, was that\n\nwe were given the opportunity to sort of\n\nflesh these characters out just a little bit more.\n\nIt's also super exciting to be joining a project\n\nin which I don't have the same things to live up to\n\nas Ewan and Hayden do.\n\nI am coming in as somebody who's never been here before\n\nand so nobody is looking for me to be something specific\n\nand I sort of have free reign to be who I think Reva is.\n\nGetting to come back and play Darth Vader\n\nand this sort of the notion\n\nthat we were going to get a glimpse\n\ninto the experience of being Darth Vader,\n\nI thought that had a tremendous amount of value.\n\nSo it's really just been about\n\nfurther informing these characters.\n\nI felt has been sort of very satisfying.\n\nYou know, I wasn't a big fan of Star Wars before this.\n\nI knew like the cultural pinpoints like Vader,\n\nLuke, I am your father, Obi-Wan, those things.\n\nBut I think what I've appreciated\n\nis the depth of the world\n\nthat George Lucas built and the escapism\n\nit provides so many people and provides myself now.\n\nI've been very, very happy to join the universe.\n\nThe Volume is just an amazing bit of technology.\n\nThe approach to working in the Volume is much different\n\nthan filming in front of a blue screen or a green screen.\n\nI never had to pretend or imagine where I was.\n\nEwan and Hayden sort of were used to\n\nlike green screens and tennis balls.\n\nI feel really blessed that I could just walk in\n\nand be in whatever environment I was in.\n\nYou're totally surrounded by it and it's incredible.\n\nYou step into the Volume and you're in Star Wars.\n\nYou can never really see sort of where it ends\n\nbecause it's so vast.\n\nI think that was probably one of my favorite things\n\nabout working on the series.\n\nIt's quite the experience.\n\nIf I can meet one Star Wars creature, who would it be?\n\nWell, I'd like to meet Jar Jar again.\n\nI guess I'm gonna go with Yoda,\n\njust to see if I could get some of his wisdom.\n\nMaybe some of his knowledge might rub off on me.\n\nI loved working with Ahmed Best, who played Jar Jar Binks.\n\nMaybe we could bring him back."
