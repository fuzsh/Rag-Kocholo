        "text": "After I read the poll about shirtless actors on Just Jared last week, I spent a little time browsing back through their Hayden Christensen posts, to see what was new to me. apparently he really liked juice drinks/smoothies back in the day because more than a few of the paparazzi photos were of him purchasing the fruity ‘health conscious’ drinks.\n\nAs I started clicking on other links (and getting lost for hours) one of the things that grabbed my attention were recurring entries on old fan sites referring to film projects Hayden had signed on for, that never came to be. financing issues, location disputes, script rewrites, and scheduling conflicts are just some of the reasons films never get made. as director Peter Howitt said:\n\n“When you set out to finance a film you have to get some actors attached and they, in essence, want to be in it but you have to go back and check with them because they don’t know when you’ll make it, or if you’ll even be able to do a deal with them to make it. They just say: ‘Look, if all the planets align at the time you make it I’d like to play this part and you can tell people that to help raise the money…’ But then you have to go back to them when you have the money and your dates and they’re either available or not. If not, you replace them.”\n\nIn the case of The Madison Kid biopic about Phil Hellmuth, who become the youngest world champion of Poker in 1989 at the age of 24, it seemed to be a location/financing issue. the desired filming location was Madison Wisconsin, where the true story was set. if tax breaks and city codes forced the production to move to Canada, then the film would have taken on the title of ‘Poker Brat’, a nickname attributed to Phil Hellmuth because of his inflated ego. Hayden was attached to the role in 2006, but there isn’t a film title for either name on IMDb now.\n\nUntot centers on an elite World War II military unit, which is dropped behind enemy lines in the snowy mountains of Poland to destroy a secret Nazi weapons facility. oh, and there’s zombies. it’s a horror film, obviously. Hayden was attached in 2015, and there was a mention again in 2017, but nothing on IMDb that matches up. Jamie Dornan’s Anthropoid in 2016 and Jack O’Connell’s The Man with the Iron Heart in 2017 both had a similar premise, though they dealt with the assassination of a real life war criminal, not zombies.\n\nIn 2010 Hayden was attached to The Genesis Code, based on a John Chase novel. the story follows a former national security expert who discovers a religious sect may be involved in the murder of his sister and her son. with the help of his sister’s friend, he follows the clues to a clinic in the mountains of Italy, where a terrifying secret experiment has been conducted.\n\nSome of the titles I ran across did end up being made with other actors instead of Hayden, like the romantic dramas Battlecreek, starring Bill Skarsgard, and Cheri, with Rupert Friend. I can’t picture Hayden in either of those. the former would have been fine, but I’m glad he passed on the latter. although someone by the name of Jim Osbourne doesn’t agree, saying in a 2010 Deadline article:\n\n“He wouldn’t read for Clint Eastwood’s Hereafter, he passed on Afterlife opposite Liam Neeson, he passed on Cheri opposite Michelle Pfeiffer. It’s so competitive for young actors right now that sitting on a farm in Toronto is not going to get him a job.”\n\nThere is nothing wrong with sitting on a farm in Toronto, Sir! I’d like to be there right now, if I could.\n\nSome of the other possibilities that sounded good to me were: The Diplomat, where a junior diplomat is thrown into a violent conspiracy when his daughter witnesses the murder of the US ambassador to Ireland, and forces will stop at nothing to make sure she testifies.\n\nMona Lisa, a remake of a 1986 movie starring Bob Hoskins. but instead of being set in London, this one would be set in New York City, where an ex-con is having difficulty fitting back into his former life and takes a job as a driver for a high priced escort.\n\nand Beast of Bataan, based on Lawrence Taylor’s A Trial of Generals, which follows the aftermath of the 1942 Bataan Death March and a young lawyer, trying his first case as he fights against the death penalty for his war criminal client. Willem Defoe was set to play General McArthur.\n\nI like war movies and I love courtroom dramas, but there’s just something about a rough-around-the-edges ex convict being the hired driver for a high class hooker, that greatly intrigues me!"
