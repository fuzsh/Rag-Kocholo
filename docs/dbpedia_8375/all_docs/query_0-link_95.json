        "text": "Simple. Keep him out of Star Wars. Most people who were in Star Wars had it damage their careers, either from typecasting or Lucas's dialog making them look bad if they were new to acting, which is what got Hayden. Jackson, McGregor were established actors. Harrison Ford got very lucky and had a great career, but he clearly dislikes Star Wars and prefers Indy/Blade Runner. Portman, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill all had problems from Star Wars that took time to get past, and alot of the sequel actors have suffered like Kelly Tran, Daisey Ridley and John Boyega.\n\nSimple.

I'm not saying go 100% off script, but a bit more ability to ad lib or otherwise be more spontaneous might not hurt.\n\nHe focused on his family and kids, seems to lead a pretty comfy life.\n\nYou'd need to butterfly that at least, a lot of good actors or public figures gave up their stressful careers for their families.\n\nA pretty major example was Nico Rossberg who gave up his career at the top, after winning just a single championship in F1 in 2016.\n\nA nice story, but fundamentally untrue. I am a huge fan of Hayden Christensen and the Prequels, and believe he was unfairly maligned for his performance in the movies, but to say he gave up acting to focus on his family is a complete fabrication. He was incredibly active in the industry after the Prequels but, as aforementioned, every film was critically panned and his career fizzled out in the middle 2010s. To compare him to Nico Rossberg and to say he needs to put aside his family to become a more successful actor is a little silly. Let’s not rewrite history.\n\nSimple. Keep him out of Star Wars.

Portman, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill all had problems from Star Wars that took time to get past, and alot of the sequel actors have suffered like Kelly Tran, Daisey Ridley and John Boyega.\n\nIt would be hard to ascertain a career trajectory for Hayden if he didn’t star in the Prequels. It just becomes guesswork. The purpose of putting the POD after ROTS is so we can determine, with some accuracy, what opportunities he missed out on which could potentially improve his status in Hollywood.\n\nHave George Lucas be less hands on with Ep I, II, and III, and/or have one or more other people on set or whatever be willing to put their foot down a bit firmer if they don't like something and give the cast a bit more flexibility or freedom to go about their roles.\n\nHe was not very domineering on set. He originally didn't even plan to direct the films; the problem was that everybody he asked, turned him down.\n\nI'm not saying go 100% off script, but a bit more ability to ad lib or otherwise be more spontaneous might not hurt.\n\nYeah... Tell me, how much spontaneous dialogue was in the Originals? Not all that much.\n\nAnyway, George was fair with leaving in ad-lib dialogue that worked well in the Original Trilogy, and if you believe what some people who worked on the films say, also was like that for the Prequels. E.g., \"There's always a bigger fish.\" We know that he was capable of listening to advice while on the Prequels.\n\nA nice story, but fundamentally untrue.

To compare him to Nico Rossberg and to say he needs to put aside his family to become a more successful actor is a little silly. Let’s not rewrite history.\n\nDang, i remember watching a interview where he said that stuff.\n\nGuess he wanted to focus on his brighter side then.\n\nHayden fell into gap between the pretty and the handsome male Hollywood stars. It gives him something of a problem, he was not pretty enough to take the roles of young Leonard and he’s not handsome enough to take the roles of more traditional masculine roles. Of course he has aged into looking like one of the better looking British tv-detective.\n\nSo all in all, I think the best thing Hayden could do is shifting to TV and become star in a multi season award winning series. This would keep him a household name, while also allow him to show his acting, it could allow him to return as a star\n\nBizarrely enough I think the answer is more Star Wars; but not movies. Around 2005 was right when Lucas was trying to develop a live action Star Wars tv series. While the initial idea was to focus on new characters with only cameos and guest appearances from film characters all one needs is a few well written scenes with Vader - maybe even flashbacks pre RoTS so he’s not stuck in that suit- for positive fan reception and thus more screen time. With Lucas not writing and a stable of decent writers hired who can better play to Hayden’s strengths things could go better.\n\nStar Wars: Underworld\n\nStar Wars: Underworld is the working title of a proposed live-action television series that would be set during the timespan between the films Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith and Star Wars: Episode IV A New Hope. George Lucas first announced the series at 2005's Celebration III. Over...\n\nEasy, make him less attractive. Maybe the years were hard on him, maybe he gets depressed and grows a gut, either way once he loses his looks people will stop looking at his face and start appreciating him, kind of like brad pitt or russell crowe. Then he won't get cheesy films like \"Little Italy\" and can focus on more reputable projects.\n\nI think the answer is just to keep him out of Star Wars or have him kind of be like Mark Hamill where he’s super low key but does voice work. However, I don’t think he has the acting ability Mark does, though Mark has his niche in voice work.\n\nAlso I’d be more interested in saving Jake Lloyd. Kid got screwed up and it ruined his life, not just career.\n\nBizarrely enough I think the answer is more Star Wars; but not movies.

The prequels only started getting appreciated when fanboys got their hands on Star Wars….and delivered the Sequel trilogy."
