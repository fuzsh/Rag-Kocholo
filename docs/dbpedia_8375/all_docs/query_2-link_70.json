According to disappointed attendees, Disney was worried about spoilers leaking.\n\n47 brilliant films that didn't receive a single Oscar nomination\n\nShow all 47\n\nThe biggest theory relating to Anakin's return predicts that the film's title could be referring to him and not Luke, as has been suspected, and that he will return as a Force ghost.\n\nBacking this idea up is new book The Secrets of the Jedi, which will be released in November. It confirms that Anakin – alongside Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi – returned a few times following his demise, and even trained others to become “Force spirits” after death.\n\nAn excerpt reads: “Their spirits guided me for many years but vanished when I shut myself off from the Force. It’s a relief to feel their presence after all this time.”\n\nLet’s not forget, Hayden Christensen – who played Anakin in the prequel trilogy – attended this year’s Star Wars Celebration. Has the reveal been hiding in plain sight the whole time?\n\nInverse also points out that when Kevin Smith visited the set, he witnessed one Star Wars actor delivering “a career best” performance. Sure, this could mean Daisy Ridley or John Boyega, but Christensen received quite a bit of criticism for his previous performances – and his quote made it seem as if it was somebody more unexpected.\n\n“[It’s] somebody I’ve seen in these movies before,” he said, adding: “I rolled a tear, it was so darn powerful.”\n\nStar Wars films – ranked worst to best\n\nShow all 11\n\nAbrams prevented Smith from looking at the film’s “mind-meltingly huge” final shot during the visit, claiming he’s “going to want to see [it] with an audience in the cinema”.\n\nOne character who’s definitely returning in Episode IX is Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid), with one theory questioning if he ever really left the franchise at all.\n\nStar Wars: Episode IX – The Rise of Skywalker is released 16 December.\n\nSubscribe to Independent Premium to bookmark this article\n\nWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?
