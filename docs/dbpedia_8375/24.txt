Hayden Christensen arrived seemingly out of nowhere to land the role of pre-Vader Anakin Skywalker, becoming one of Hollywood’s hottest stars overnight and largely untested as a screen presence. After a respected turn in Life As A House(see previous episode!), the Attack of the Clones reviews soured audiences on this brand new star. The very next year, he gave a terrific performance in Shattered Glass as journalist Stephen Glass who famously fabricated stories for The New Republic. But awards bodies overlooked Christensen’s work and instead nominated the rising Peter Sarsgaard as Glass’ pseudo-rival Chuck Lane.

This episode, we talk about the Entertainment Weekly It List that was Christensen’s first debut post-Star Wars casting and his return to the franchise. We also talk about director/writer Billy Ray, Sarsgaard’s near nomination here, and journalism movies that were successful with Oscar.

Topics also include working with fact checkers, college group watch television, and the 2003 Independent Spirit Awards.

This week, we’re looking back at Oscar buzz molded from the success of American Beauty and the (new) hope of an incoming mega-franchise star: 2001′s Life As A House. Writer and podcaster LaToya Ferguson joins us to talk about the film that stars Kevin Kline as a dying man building a dream house with his estranged troubled son, played by Hayden Christensen. The film stayed long in season thanks to precursor attention for Christensen, recently announced as the next Anakin Skywalker – but Oscar wasn’t quite so eager to herald him as the next big thing before seeing his Darth Vader.

Much more unwell than you remember it, Life As A House features a slew of no-boundaries behaviors that we unpack including shower intrusions, milfs, toilets next to kitchen sinks, and going postal at the office. But this episode finds us in nostalgia mode as we look back at Entertainment Weekly’s It List, pre-movie trailer reels on VHS, and the WB’s “Oh What A Night” promo.

Topics also include the 2001 Supporting Actor race, Fred Durst’s directorial oeuvre, and “Anatomy 101 with Professor D’Angelo.”
