Biography

Rúrik Gíslason (born 25 February 1988) is an Icelandic former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Club career

Rúrik started his career with HK Kópavogur in his youth. Following a youth stint at R.S.C. Anderlecht, the then-champions of Belgium, he made his senior debut with HK Kópavogur.

At the end of August 2005, Rúrik signed for Charlton Athletic, but failed to make an appearance for Charlton's first team.

On 10 November 2020, Rúrik announced his retirement from football. He is currently appearing on the German TV programme Let’s Dance.

International career

In 2011, Rúrik was chosen as part of the Iceland U21 squad to represent Iceland at the 2011 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship in Denmark. The striker was named on the bench for the opening game against Belarus.

In May 2018 he was named in Iceland's 23-man squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.

Personal life

After Iceland's World Cup Group game against Argentina, Rúrik's Instagram profile went viral, as his followers increased by 250,000 after the game. His follower count is now right under one million, more than triple the size of Iceland's current population.

In 2021, Rúrik is scheduled to appear in the action-comedy film Cop Secret, directed by Hannes Þór Halldórsson.
