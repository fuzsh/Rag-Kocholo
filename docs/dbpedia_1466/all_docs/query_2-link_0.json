        "text": "2017 Season\n\nLeague - Upper League Cup - Icelandic Cup - Europa League\n\nKey Players\n\nEmil Atlason - P34, 20 Goals, 15 Assists. In his third season for the club, I felt Emil really started to make that position upfront his own; exactly what I was hoping he would do at the start of the season. Big game player and still only 24.\n\nGabríel Ingi Agnarsson - P36, 8 Goals, 14 Assists. A huge signing for us, Gabríel was the key this season, not just in his performances but because it allowed us to move hugely influential playmaker, Gudjónsson from the Advanced Playmaker central position (which is where Agnarsson now plays) to right back. Going forward, we now have that extra option which we didn't have. Only 20 years of age too.\n\nIngimundur Níels Óskarsson - P31, 18 Goals, 8 Assists. In his second season for the club, Oskarsson hit the ground running with 5 goals in the Upper League Cup and maintained a brilliant level of performance throughout the season.\n\nExciting Youth Prospects\n\nRúnar Eiriksson - After breaking into the first team last year, he was an ever-present this, cementing his place as our Deep-Lying Playmaker. Absolutely solid, no fuss, moves the ball well doesn't score many or make many mistakes, does a great job for the team. 18 years old and I like to think he could be playing for HK for a long time.\n\nEinar Karl Júlíusson - Came through our youth setup last season and I liked the look of him, so I asked Oskarsson to tutor him and that seems to have worked wonders (I've done the same with all other prospects). At 31, Oskarsson won't be in the team for much longer so by the time he retires, I anticipate Júlíusson will be ready for regular first team football.\n\nPorvaldur Sigurdsson - I really like the look of this lad, came through our youth setup in August so has only been at the club for a couple of months but he looks sharp whenever he comes on and plays the False Nine role well. Double figures for Heading, Aggression, Composure, Finishing, Dribbling, Decisions, Determination, Off The Ball, Jumping Reach and Strength, amongst others, means he has huge potential to lead the line for us in future.\n\nOverview\n\nAn awesome season. I was quietly confident we would mount a title challenge, particularly because the other teams just aren't strong enough. KR won the league back-to-back and they have a tiny squad with sporadic quality. We were top for the majority of the season, only being replaced when we had fixtures rearranged. After being eliminated from the Upper League Cup, we played 30 matches in 19 weeks, averaging a match approximately every four days. I felt we rotated the squad well and always had a decent youth player to step in and do a job for the team.\n\nOur European adventure got off to a perfect start, racing into a 4-0 lead at HT, away against Slovenian side Celje, only for us to be pegged back to 4-2 (I have to confess a poorly judged teamtalk didn't help). We then lost the return leg 1-0 at home but the match was almost a formality. We then faced Maccabi Tel-Aviv, who I've met a few times in previous FMs and they've always been one of the better sides in the early qualifying rounds so knew we would be in for a tough match. In the home tie, we were winning 2-1 only for them to score just before HT and then again after the break. I thought a 3-2 loss was respectable. In Tel-Aviv, no doubt with a hostile home crowd, we lost 2-0 and kissed goodbye to the European dream. I was happy with that first outing though, the club probably make somewhere between £100k - £200k, which is a lot of money considering last years turnover was just shy of £1m.\n\nOur Icelandic Cup run was a bit ropey, we saw off non-league Kári, before needing penalties to beat Fjolnir. Then we narrowly beat Njardvik before, again, edging past Tindastóll, a Div 1 side. We faced major rivals and, annoyingly, a huge bogey team for me but beat them 1-0 in the final with a scrappy goal from a corner. What do they say about the best sides finding a way to win!? I looked through and we scored 9 goals to win the cup, with not one player scoring more than one goal each!\n\nNext Season\n\nWin the Upper League Cup, Icelandic Cup and Úrvalsdeild, make as much money from CL and keep bringing youngsters through.\n\nHandknattleiksfélag Kópavogs 2018 Season\n\nCompetitions\n\nLeague - Upper League Cup - Icelandic Cup - Champions Cup - Champions League - Europa League\n\nKey Players\n\nHafsteinn Briem - Moved back into the Adv. PM position and thrived as I knew he would, after Agnarsson leaving. 9 goals, 9 assists from 33 matches.\n\nArnar Már Gudjónsson - Solid season from our attacking RB, contributing a staggering 15 assists and 6 goals from 35 matches.\n\nEinar Karl Júlísson - A huge season for Júlíusson in which he converted his potential into real substance, aiding the cause with 15 goals and 13 assists from 34 matches. We rejected a £2m bid for him from Rosenborg.\n\nExciting Youth Prospects\n\nValdemar Kamban - Signed Kamban for £45k in July, and he notched 5 goals in his first 12 matches. Very excited to see how Kamban will progress. Atlason hasn't been consistent enough this season so next year Kamban will feature heavily.\n\nEinar Magnússon - This lad came through our youth setup (which we're pouring good money into!) and I'm very optimistic about him. Good mental stats and a possible candidate for our next attacking full back after Gudjónsson retires.\n\nFreyr Pórdarson - Another young striker that has great potential.\n\nOthers\n\nRúnar Eiriksson is ticking along nicely, playing lots of matches but not setting the world alight. Solid progress.\n\nPorvaldur Sigurdsson has been hampered by injuries, hopefully he can kick on next season.\n\nOverview\n\nOn paper a brilliant season, we won three of four domestic competitions, missing out only on the Icelandic Cup.\n\nWe scored one less point than last season in the league but it felt like we just did enough in lots of the matches, not playing well but getting the results; a sign of a top team?\n\nWe lost the Icelandic Cup final in frustrating circumstances. Breidablik had six days rest before the match and we only had three due to success in other competitions, which was disappointing as we could only field half of our first team.\n\nWinning the Upper League Cup in extra-time of the final was a relief if nothing else. The one domestic competition that seemed to keep evading us, it was nice to get it under our belt.\n\nOur European adventures this season reaped lots of financial rewards. We were drawn again FC Midtjylland in the second Qualifier of the CL and managed to beat them 2-1 away from home, then drawing 1-1 at home just doing enough to progress through to the next round. In the third Qualifier, we faced a strong BATE Borisov side and somehow managed to beat them 1-0 at home before doubling our first leg lead in the second leg, going 2-0 up on aggregate after just 12 minutes of the second tie. Unfortunately, after withstanding attack after attack, we conceded three goals and were eliminated from our first Champions League campaign. I felt more than happy with the way we played, definitely not embarrassing ourselves.\n\nWe were then drawn in the Europa League Playoff against Bayer Leverkusen of all teams. As soon as I saw the draw I knew it was going to be a damage limitation task; they were simply streets ahead of us. We lost the first leg 4-1 away from home and went into the second looking to give a good account of ourselves. With fifteen minutes of the tie remaining, we found ourselves 6-1 down on aggregate and not showing much fight. Three late goals and one from Leverkusen meant we finished the second leg tied 3-3 and 7-4 down on aggregate; again not embarrassing ourselves.\n\nWe sold Gabriel Ingi Agnarsson to IFK Goteborg for £1.2m + 50% of his next transfer, which I'm hoping will bring in a few million when one of the big boys picks him up, no doubt they will.\n\nTo conclude, a great season, we did well in Europe, maintained our good work domestically and have picked up a few more exciting youth prospects. Of the 26 players in the first team squad, half are 20 or younger. Bodes very well for the future.\n\nFinances\n\nA hugely successful season, financially. The sale of Agnarsson combined with our European run effectively paid for the stadium extension and the £850k we've spent on the Youth Setup!\n\nNext Season\n\nSame as last season: Win the Upper League Cup, Icelandic Cup and Úrvalsdeild, make as much money from CL and keep bringing youngsters through.\n\nCompetitions\n\nTable - Upper League Cup - Icelandic Cup - Champions Cup - Champions League\n\nKey Players\n\nEinar Karl Júlísson - Another great season, 21 goals and 13 assists in 36 matches including 9 goals in the Champions League. This season was a big one for Júlíusson, when we needed him most he stood up. Great season.\n\nEmil Atlason - I'm still not convinced Emil is the man to take us forward but he always posts a great return. 24 goals and 12 assists from 35 matches can't be argued with.\n\nExciting Youth Prospects\n\nValdemar Kamban - We have a lot of exciting youth players but by far the most exciting is Valdemar. 7 goals and 8 assists from 14 starts (15 sub apps) is a great return. Kamban always does a job when he comes into the team.\n\nOthers\n\nRúnar Eiriksson has cemented his place as our deep lying playmaker. Solid, unspectacular and tidy. Recycles possession nicely and rarely puts a foot wrong.\n\nOverview\n\nAnother brilliant season, we won three of four domestic competitions, missing out only on the Icelandic Cup again.\n\nIn the league we were unstoppable, posting a record 53 points from just 22 matches. We usually dropped points in between European fixtures, which is understandable now that we travel to Italy, England and Russia(!).\n\nTo me the Upper League Cup feels like the League Cup to Jose Mourinho; it's the first competition you have the chance to win and it really sets the tone for the season. We won it for the second time this season, which really installs that winning mentality into the group.\n\nOur Icelandic Cup run ended very prematurely this year, frustrating as I don't believe any team in Iceland is fit to clean our boots, such is the gulf in class.\n\nChampions League\n\nWith the league as good as tied up (we needed one point from our last four matches), we started the Group Stage in good spirits. My only aspiration for the Group Stage was to give a respectable account of ourselves, score a couple of goals and not get beaten too heavily. Third place would be a miracle.\n\nI wasn't aware of this before but our U19s play in a youth replica of the tournament, which is very exciting for me as I believe the best way to improve players in FM and IRL is game time, so we'd be playing at least six matches against top quality young players.\n\nMatchday 1 v Man Utd (H)\n\nManchester United were the first team to visit us at \"home\" (we play our CL matches at Fram's 15,182 capacity stadium Laugardalsvöllur). 9,522 people showed up for the historic match. Tactically, I didn't want to change anything for the first game, I went with my strongest XI and played exactly how we would against any other team. The first half was as you would expect: us pinned in our half, attempted to restrict them to long shots. It went according to plan too. I was very happy with 0-0 at half time, they didn't really have a great deal of chances either. Unfortunately, the second half was a different story, Danny Welbeck scored in the 48th, 71st and 93rd minute to give United a deserved 3-0 win. A fair scoreline and confirmation of the gulf in class at this level.\n\nYouth result: 1-2. Ásgeir Rúnarsson with our goal.\n\nMatchday 2 v Roma (A)\n\nAfter losing 3-0 to Man Utd, I wanted to change our style of play so I told the team to drop deeper and play narrower whilst altering the mentality from 'standard' to 'counter'. 37,331 people attended (just over half full) the Stade Olimpico in Rome and the vast majority of the crowd would've gone to get their half time pie (pizza?) and pint frustrated. 0-0 at half-time. We were solid, much like the Man Utd match, hardworking, difficult to breakdown and looking good in possession, when we would wrestle it away from them that was. Unfortunately, again, we conceded an early goal in the second half, this time Antoine Griezmann snaking his way past Magnússon at left back before goosing G.Júlíusson at centre back and firing in from the angle. A phenomenal strike from a phenomenal player. We stuck to the game plan knowing that Roma hadn't really had much with me thinking that if we could get to 80 minutes with it still 1-0, we'd have a good go in the last 10 minutes. And then it happened. Every manager worth his salt will know a good chance when he sees it. We broke from a Roma free-kick in the 80th minute, Pétursson alert as ever with a good long ball to Sigurdsson on the left wing who nodded it down to Eiriksson in the middle of the park, who fed sub striker Pórdarson who in turn played Sigurdsson back in down the left wing. Years of playing FM and watching football had heightened my Chanceometer. A flat out race between Sigurdsson, a 23-year-old nippy winger with 16 acceleration, versus Argentinian international Enzo Beloso with 15 accleration. Sigurdsson did enough to get there first and won the race. He was in. Sigurdsson raced into the area with no-one for support, he was but one Icelandic man stranded abroad in a cauldron in Rome and then he hits it near post. Always go across the keeper you're told, make him work, get the ball on target and get a corner out of it worst case scenario. But Icelandic men don't play the percentages, Magnús Pór Sigurdsson has ice in his veins, as do all his compatriots. He thunders it near post, beating Asmir Begovic before clattering off the post and back into the arms of the grateful Bosnian. And just like that, our honeymoon in Rome was over. Thoroughly happy with that, though stealing a point in Rome would've been cause for a trip to the local for a bottle of Southern Comfort. Never mind, we move on.\n\nSigurdsson shot 1 Sigurdsson shot 2 Sigurdsson shot 3\n\nYouth results: 2-1! Ásgeir Rúnarsson with both goals.\n\nMatchday 3 v Zenit (H)\n\nI didn't pay any attention to either of the three teams squads but, at a first glance I would've said Zenit were the weakest, yet still far too strong for us. When the third matchday came around I thought we'd have a go at Zenit, buoyed from our near-miss in Rome. And then it happened. Arnarson, Júlíusson and Hauksson are moving the ball well in the Zenit half before Júlíusson plays the ball to Hauksson who knows exactly where Júlíusson is going; in behind the full back. He doesn't even have to look, he instinctively knows and slides the ball through, perfectly weighted. Júlíusson is in behind with just the keeper to beat, he takes a touch and laces the ball across the keeper and into the back of the net. 1-0 and the crowd are going mental. Unfortunately the lead lasted all of three minutes before Oleg Shatov scored. Once more, we went in at half-time level and we had even managed to score! Also once more, however, we conceded straight after the restart with Oleg Shatov scoring his second and what turned out to be the winning goal in the 46th minute. We had a couple of half chances but nothing of note. Another stellar performance from the Icelandic underdogs.\n\nJúlíusson shot 1 Júlíusson shot 2 Júlíusson shot 3\n\nYouth result: 1-1. Ásgeir Rúnarsson with his (and our) fourth goal of the Group Stage.\n\nHalfway Report\n\nHappy with the first team's performance in the three matches, certainly not disgraced ourselves and really given it a good go.\n\nThe U19s have been brilliant and find themselves in second place with four points. Man Utd top the group with seven, Zenit in third with three points and Roma bottom with just one point.\n\nMatchday 4 v Zenit (A)\n\nAfter taking the lead in the Home fixture, I thought we would be able to give Zenit a game in Russia but this wasn't the case. After a cagey opening 25 minutes, they scored two goals in 10 minutes leaving us 2-0 down with 35 minutes on the clock. Our right winger Júlíusson pulled one back with a trademark bullet from the edge of the box going across the keeper (I can't tell you how many times he's done that). Half time oranges were eaten 2-1 down. Not bad. I subbed off both full backs to give them a rest and put young striker Kamban upfront but to no avail. Zenit scored again to finish us off 3-1 and that officially meant we were eliminated. Luckily, though, Roma only have 3 points so, as unlikely as it is, third place is not out of the question and the Italians won't fancy coming to Iceland I can tell you that for sure.\n\nYouth result: 0-2.\n\nMatchday 5 v Man Utd (A)\n\nWith three weeks between fixtures and the ever-presents in the first team spent at the end of their regular season, I gave the first team a week off of training hoping that would freshen them up a little. The emphatic 5-1 scoreline suggests it did the opposite. Apart from Hafsteinn Briem burying a 25 yard volley, we offered little else and it could have been so many more had United converted more of their 31 shots. Conceding two goals from set pieces was particularly hard to take.\n\nYouth result: 0-2.\n\nMatchday 6 v Roma (H)\n\nI was slightly despondent going after the United result. I felt we had let ourselves down a little in the way we lost that match. As I didn't know when we were next going to be featuring in the Group Stage and with literally nothing to lose (Roma drew with Zenit in matchday 5 so we would finish bottom regardless), I decided to give the team a rousing team talk, tell them to hassle the opposition and to get stuck in and that's exactly what they did. Valdemar Kamban was playing left wing for me today and pounced on a rebound in the 39th minute to give us a well-earned lead. Very happy with that, nothing less than we deserved after a half full of us attacking and Roma defending(!). With a minute to play of the half, we had a throw in deep into the Roma half and, when Eiriksson swung the ball to the back post, Matarr Jobe was on hand to volley home. 2-0 up against Roma at half time! I couldn't quite believe it.\n\nHalf time came and I had to make the two important decisions. Firstly - tell the team I'm pleased or warn against complacency. Heart says pleased, head says complacent. Complacent it is, and it worked. All focused. Secondly, stick or twist? We knew Roma would come at us in the second half, they're a team full of internationals. Fortune favours the brave so we stuck as we were.\n\nSecond half came and to my absolute delight, Kamban put us three up from a position similar to Sigurdsson's chance against Roma in the reverse tie. Pandemonium on the sidelines with the HK bench going wild. Thirty minutes left, surely Roma would throw the kitchen sink at us now. They had nothing or, more accurately, we gave them nothing. Roma ended the match with 0 shots on target. Staggering performance from HK and, had it not been for Roma snatching a draw against Zenit, we would've finished third. Outstanding stuff.\n\nYouth result: 3-1 Ásgeir Rúnarsson bagged one and Gylfi Örn Öfjord got two but it wasn't enough, we finished third level on points with Zenit.\n\nU19s Group\n\nFinances\n\nReaching the Champions League Group Stage is a game changer. £7m plus all of the added benefits of six fixtures against world class sides means we made a huge profit, enough to keep us going for a long time.\n\nNext Season\n\nDomestically, the aim will always be to win every competition. In Europe we over-achieved massively. I will be ecstatic to make the group stages of the CL again, though I certainly am not expecting to.\n\nMiscellaneous\n\nAfter reaching the CL group stage, the board granted my request to go full time from the start of next season, as well as upgrading everything! Stadium, training facilities, youth facilities the lot.\n\nHandknattleiksfélag Kópavogs 2020 Season\n\nCompetitions\n\nTable - Upper League Cup - Icelandic Cup - Champions Cup - Champions League\n\nAs cliché as this might sound, this season was absolutely crucial. For the past six seasons we had always overachieved with young players on a tight budget. Yes, we had borrowed a bit of money but we were solvent. This season, after turning professional and sextupling, anything other than success was unacceptable. The budget went from £10k p/w to £60k p/w, with nearly all of the squad and staff moving onto full time contracts and adding a fair amount of new faces, including far too many non-EU nationals (you're only allowed 3 per matchday squad).\n\nUpper League Cup\n\nAfter first winning this in 2018 then retaining it last year, I do not want to relinquish our deathgrip on it. It's the first domestic competition and will always be taken seriously by HK as long as I'm in charge! Seven wins out of seven in the group stage with 25 goals scored and just 2 conceded suggests the players took it equally as seriously. Fram were seen off in the quarters, while Valur (promoted last year as our feeder club) took us to penalties, though I was confident especially as our fifth penalty taker was Hafsteinn Briem (all hail!). I've likened my approach to Mourinho's before and the final was another typical example of that; a 2-0 win, nothing silly, get the job done give them nothing and bring the trophy home.\n\nChampions Cup\n\nNothing to note, 3-1 win against First Division Selfoss. Two cups out of two.\n\nLeague Campaign\n\nWe have started both of the last two league campaigns on fire both wobbling a little and then powering on to win the title. In 2018 we started with seven consecutive wins and in 2019 we started with nine. This season we started with eight consecutive wins before slipping up in the match three days before we started our Champions League campaign (shock). We went onto win the league by 13 points (same as last year), with 52 points.\n\nChampions League\n\nAfter our heroics in reaching the group stage last year, we again begun our campaign in the second qualifying round against Hibernians of Malta. Our record win (6-0) was broken in the first leg as we put seven past the bewildered Maltese in their own backyard before breaking our record for a third time in less than five weeks by beating them 8-0 at home. 15-0 on aggregate wasn't flattering, only ever one side in it.\n\nAs expected, the first leg of the third qualifying round was a lot tighter and in Dinamo of Croatia, we came up against much tougher opposition. The first leg at home was frustrating, especially as we created a number of good chances but couldn't convert any of them. In total, both teams mustered 26 shots with just two hitting the target. Our first stalemate for over 16 months. On a positive note, we didn't concede an away goal so if we score first in Croatia, we'll be in the driving seat.\n\nBetween the two most crucial fixtures of our season so far, was the small matter of an Icelandic Cup semi-final. We rested the whole XI and thankfully won 4-0.\n\nAs you would expect, the first half was as cagey a match as I've seen with less than a handful of shots and the deadlock wasn't broken until the 53rd minute when cultured centre half Júlíusson volleyed home from 12 yards out! This really opened the game up but proved to be the only goal, with us going through 1-0 on aggregate. Before the game I felt whoever scored first would win this tie and I'm so pleased to be proven right!\n\nDue to our lowly status, we weren't seeded for the Playoff draw, meaning we would face Basel, BATE Borisov, Rosenborg, Rangers or Helsingborg. I was hoping for Helsingborg, though we did overcome Rosenborg last year. We were drawn against Rosenborg with the first leg at home four days after the Icelandic Cup final.\n\nAfter successfully negotiating the Icelandic Cup final, we faced Rosenborg in the first leg of our pivotal Playoff tie. The first half went perfectly according to plan; we were solid and Lopez in midfield was running the show, which meant we went in 2-0 up at HT. Whether it was my team talk or something the players ate, I don't know but within ten minutes of the second half we had been pegged back to 2-2 before Pórdarson put us ahead again a few minutes later. Not long after that, Rosenborg equalised again and that was how it would end. 3-3 at home. Not happy with conceding three away goals but we're still in the tie.\n\nAgain, we had a domestic fixture between European matches and negotiated that by resting the whole XI. Our season really does pivot around whether we get into the group stages, so this match was crucial. I felt that the first goal of the second leg would be crucial, as it so often is. We drew first blood in the 13th minute with Freyr Pórdarson nodding in from a corner and, remarkably, that was the only goal of the game. Into the group stage! I really can't stress how important this achievement is. Obviously, last year was fantastic but this year we had the added pressure of a wage budget of £60k as opposed to a mere £10k. Financially, it would've been very damaging to miss out on the group stage this year, particularly because the board have, rightly, invested so much of last years money into the infrastructure of the club.\n\nThe Group Stage drew us against holders Man City, Bayern Munich and Benfica. Ha! We'll take fourth again.\n\nFinances\n\nAlthough reaching the Group Stage of the CL last year was big, this year was bigger as we had the added pressure of having invested most of the money in the infrastructure as well as sextupling our budget (£10k p/w to £60k p/w). Our expenses are relatively low compared to the prize money the CL brings. If we can continue making the Group Stages, we can really push on from there.\n\nNext Season\n\nSame again: dominate domestically, reach the Group Stage again."
