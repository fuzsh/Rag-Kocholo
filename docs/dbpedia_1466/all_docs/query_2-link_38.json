        "text": "Zeiko Lewis says he is honoured to have been named among the top players within the Concacaf region plying their trade in the United States.\n\nThe Bermuda international has been ranked eighth by Inside Caribbean Football on their list of the best Caribbean players in North America in 2021.\n\n“To be named one of the top in the region is a great honour,” Lewis told The Royal Gazette. “It’s motivation to not only push harder to rise up the list, but also to prove that I can be there, and want to be the best that I can be.”\n\nThe accolade follows on the heels of the 27-year-old forward being named as Charleston Battery’s most valuable player during his final season with the USL Championship club last year.\n\nLewis was voted by his team’s fans for the coveted Nigel Cooper Most Valuable Player Award for his five goals and ten assists, the fourth highest in the league, in 22 appearances during the 2021 campaign.\n\n“It’s an honour and a privilege to be given the award,” said Lewis, who was also nominated for Charleston’s offensive player award along with fellow forwards Nicque Daley and Claudio Repetto.\n\nCharleston failed to reach the postseason play-offs having finished sixth in the eight-team Atlantic Division during the regular campaign.\n\nSince then Lewis has joined Sacramento Republic FC, who play in the USL Championship Western Conference.\n\n“Looking forward to getting started,” he added. “New club, new adventure\n\n“Excited to join such an amazing club and can’t wait to get started.”\n\nLewis joined the club last month after agreeing to the terms of an undisclosed deal.\n\n“Zeiko is a difference-maker with a proven ability to score and create chances,” Todd Dunivant, the Sacramento FC president and general manager, said. “His competitive drive demands excellence from himself and his team-mates, and we look forward to adding Zeiko to our attack.”\n\nLewis joined Charleston from Iceland’s Handknattleiksfélag Kópavogs in 2019 and led their scoring in his first two seasons to earn the club’s Offensive Player of the Year award back-to-back."
