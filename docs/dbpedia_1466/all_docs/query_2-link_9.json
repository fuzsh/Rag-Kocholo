        "text": "PAPILLION, Neb. – Union Omaha today announced the signing of Bermuda international midfielder Zeiko Lewis, pending league and federation approval. Lewis joins after spending the previous five years in the USL Championship, following a brief sojourn to Iceland's top flight.\n\nThe Bermudan forward was drafted 17th overall by New York Red Bulls in the 2017 MLS SuperDraft out of Boston College, where he was team captain and All-ACC First Team as a senior. Lewis made his professional debut in the USL Championship with New York Red Bulls II on April 1, 2017 against the Richmond Kickers. Lewis made 23 appearances and tallied four goal contributions for the club across all competitions.\n\nHe soon moved on to brief stints with top-flight Besta deild karla side Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar and second-division 1. deild karla club Handknattleiksfélag Kópavogs in Iceland before returning stateside. Since 2019, he's featured for the Charleston Battery, where he scored 19 goals in 73 appearances, and Sacramento Republic FC, where he scored six goals in 61 appearances, both in the USL Championship. The versatile attacker has most frequently played as an attacking midfielder, but he has often shown out at central midfield, striker, and on both flanks.\n\nLewis is also an experienced international with the Bermuda national team. He was first called up in 2011 at only 17 years old and has gone on to rack up 34 senior caps. Across his 13-year career with the Gombey Warriors, Lewis has accumulated 17 goal contributions across Concacaf Gold Cup, Concacaf Nations League and FIFA World Cup qualification play, among other competitions.\n\n\"We are excited to add Zeiko to the squad as we look to become more dangerous in the final third,\" said Omaha Head Coach Dominic Casciato. \"He has a proven record of impacting the game from any of the forward positions, is willing to work hard for the team without the ball and joins us from a winning environment at Sacramento.\"\n\n\"I'm excited to get started,\" said Lewis. \"I'm looking to build and grow on a foundation of success that the club consistently strives for on and off the field, and to give the fans something to cheer about and be proud of.\""
