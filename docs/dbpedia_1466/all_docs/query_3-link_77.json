        "text": "As I have got a real interest in Countries of the World and of course Football, I recently tweeted a question on twitter – “If Money and time were no object, which three Countries would you like to go and watch football in” – I added in my tweet that my three dream destinations would be as follows:- Argentina, Faroe Islands and Iceland.\n\nI was taken aback as to how many people responded to my tweet and read with interest some of the dream destinations that people would like to go and watch football in. As well as my countries of choice, other destinations that people tweeted, included – American Samoa, Greenland, Falkland Islands, Chile, South Korea and Finland to name but a few.\n\nAfter the tweets had finished coming in over a period of two days or so, I made a note of all of the destinations that had been tweeted and counted up how many times each country had been tweeted to find the three most popular countries. The top three countries were as follows:\n\nArgentina – 8 Votes\n\nFaroe Islands – 6 Votes\n\nIceland – 4 Votes\n\nIronically and as you can see, the three countries with the most votes were the ones that I originally tweeted.\n\nIn this blog I will take a look at each of the three top Countries with regards to football and I have also picked a country at random that was voted for and to be honest one that I find very intriguing – Greenland.\n\nAll of the following was correct at the time of my research.\n\nARGENTINA\n\nNational Anthem – Himno Nacional Argentino (Argentine National Anthem)\n\nCapital City – Buenos Aires\n\nPopulation – 43,847,430\n\nNational Language – Spanish\n\nRegional Languages – Guarani (In Corrientes) Qom, Mocovi and Wichi (In Chaco)\n\nPresident – Mauricio Macri\n\nCurrency – Peso $\n\nNational Sport – Pato: An ancient horseback game that originated in the 16th century.\n\nMost Popular Sport – Football\n\nFootball In Argentina\n\nGoverning Body – Argentine Football Association\n\nRegistered Players – 331,811\n\nRegistered Clubs – 3,337\n\nLeague System – Pyramid of eight leagues\n\nTop Division – Primera Division\n\nDomestic Cup Competitions – Copa Argentina\n\nSupercopa Argentina\n\nCopa de la Superliga Argentina\n\nThe game of Football was first played in Argentina in 1867 after it was introduced to the country by British Immigrants in Buenos Aires. The first League Championship in Argentina was contested 24 years later in 1891, thus making the Argentine League Championship the 5th oldest in the World (recognised by FIFA) behind – England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Netherlands.\n\nDuring those early years of Argentinian Football the most successful club was a club by the name of Alumni Athletic Club. Founded in 1898 and disbanded in 1913, the club won 10 Argentine National Championships and several triumphs in various cup competitions. The Alumni name had it’s rebirth in 1951 with the formation of a Rugby Club in it’s name and remains to this day.\n\nRiver Plate are the most successful club in Argentine League history with 36 Primera Division titles to their name, followed by Boca Juniors (32) and Racing Club (18)\n\nLike most countries in World Football there are several big rivalries in Argentinian football. The biggest of these rivalries is the Superclasico between Buenos Aires rivals River Plate and Boca Juniors. This is one of the most keenly contested football rivalries in the whole world. Other important rivalries in Argentinian football include:\n\nThe Avellaneda Derby – Independiente v Racing Club\n\nThe Rosarian Derby – Newell’s Old Boys v Rosario Central\n\nThe Platense Derby – Estudiantes de La Plata v Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata\n\nThe West Derby – Ferro Carril Oeste v Velez Sarsfield\n\nThe Santafesino Derby – Colon v Union\n\nThe North Zone Derby – Platense v Tigre\n\nThe Cordovan Derby – Belgrano v Talleres\n\nThe Tucumanian Derby – San Martin v Tucuman\n\nObviously it goes without saying that Argentina is a country that is situated in South America. The main South American Club Championship is known as the Copa Libertadores, as of 2018/2019 season, six teams from Argentina were eligble to qualify for the 2020 Copa Libertadores. Four of these teams come from the top four places in the Primera Division with the other two teams coming from winning the Copa Argentina and Copa de la Superliga Argentina. The club from Argentina with the most triumphs in the Copa Libertadores is Independiente with 7 competition victories followed by – Boca Juniors (6) Estudiantes (4) River Plate (3) Racing Club (1) Argentinos Juniors (1) Velez Sarsfield (1) San Lorenzo (1)\n\nARGENTINA NATIONAL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Uruguay 2-3 Argentina. 16th May 1901\n\nBiggest Win – Argentina 12-0 Ecuador. 22nd January 1942\n\nBiggest Defeat – Czechoslovakia 6-1 Argentina. 15th June 1958\n\nBolivia 6-1 Argentina. 1st April 2009\n\nSpain 6-1 Argentina. 27th March 2018\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 17\n\nBest World Cup Result – Champions: 1978, 1986\n\nCopa America Appearnces – 41\n\nBest Copa America Result – Champions: 1921, 1925, 1927, 1929, 1937, 1941, 1945, 1946, 1947, 1955, 1957, 1959, 1991, 1993\n\nConfederations Cup Appearances – 3\n\nConfederations Cup Best Result – Champions: 1992\n\nOlympic Games Gold Medals – 2: 2004, 2008\n\nNational Stadium – El Monumental: Capacity 66,266\n\nMost Caps – Javier Mascherano – 147\n\nTop Goalscorer – Lionel Messi – (Currently on 65 goals)\n\nHead Coach – Lionel Scaloni\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – 11\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN ARGENTINA\n\nWomen’s Club Football in Aregntina has struggled somewhat to attract a mainstream audience despite their being Women’s Clubs in the Country for several Decades. In the early 1990’s a group of Women’s Clubs were accepted as members of the Argentine Football Association, by the end of the decade their were reported to be as many as 35 female teams within the FA. Sadly, since then the numbers of decreased rather rapidly.\n\nARGENTINA WOMEN’S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Argentina 3-2 Chile: 3rd December 1993\n\nBiggest Win – Argentina 12-0 Bolivia: 12th January 1995\n\nBiggest Defeat – Germany 11-0 Argentina: 10th September 2007\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 3 (Including Qualifying for 2019 Tournament)\n\nBest World Cup Result – Group Stages: 2003 and 2007\n\nCopa America Femenina Appearances – 7\n\nCopa America Femenina Best Result – Champions 2006\n\nOlympic Games Appearances – 0\n\nPan American Games Appearances – 5 (Including Qualifying for 2019 Tournament)\n\nPan American Games Best Result – 4th Place 2003\n\nNational Stadium – Not Known\n\nMost Caps – Gabriela Lacobellis 120\n\nTop Goalscorer – Gabriela Lacobellis 88\n\nHead Coach – Carlos Borrello\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – 37\n\n……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………..\n\nFAROE ISLANDS\n\nNational Anthem – Tu alfagra land mitt (Thou my beauteous land)\n\nCapital City – Torshavn\n\nPopulation – 51,540\n\nOfficial Languages – Faroese, Danish\n\nSovereign State – Kingdom of Denmark\n\nGovernment – Devolved government within parliamentary constitutional monarchy\n\nMonarch – Margrethe II (Queen of Denmark)\n\nPrime Minister – Aksel V.

More clubs were established and during those early years of Faroese football, clubs played home and away friendlies before the first National Championship was established in 1942. The National Cup Competition (The Faroe Islands Cup) was first contested in 1955, the first winners of this trophy were Hanvar Boltfelag or as they are more commonly known – HB. In that first Faroese Cup final, HB lifted the cup by beating Klaksvikar Irottarfelag (Ki) 3-1 in Gundadalur, Torshavn.\n\nThe newly formed League and Cup Competitions were organised by the Faroe Islands Sports Association until 1979 when The Faroes Islands Football Association was formed. Clubs from the Faroe Islands have now been taking part in UEFA competitions for a period of 27 years.\n\nIn terms of League titles successes the club with the most Premier League triumphs is Havnar Boltfelag (HB) with 23 title wins up to 2018. The current 2019 season commenced on March 10th and concludes on 26th October, the current League leaders for the 2019 campaign are Klaksvikar Itrottarfelag (Ki) – Ki are second to HB in terms of Premier League titles with 17 wins and third place comes B36 Torshavn 11 titles.\n\nAs I have previously mentioned – clubs from the Faroe Islands have been taking part in UEFA Club competitions for 27 years (1992)\n\nIf we look at Havnar Boltfelag (HB) the most successful club in Faroese Football in terms of League titles – They have played an impressive amount of 50 games in all UEFA Competitions with an overall record of:\n\nP 50, W 5, D 12, L 33, GF 34, GA 137\n\nTheir best performance in UEFA Competions have come in the UEFA Champions League by reaching the Second Qualifying Round on three occassions:\n\n2010/2011: 1-5 Aggregate Score: Versus Red Bull Salzburg (Austria)\n\n2011/2012: 1-3 Aggregate Score: Versus Malmo FF (Sweden)\n\n2014/2015: 16 Aggregate Score: Versus FK Partizan (Serbia)\n\nFAROE ISLANDS NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Iceland 1-0 Faroe Islands: 24th August 1988\n\nBiggest Win – Faroe Islands 3-0 San Marino: 25th May 1995\n\nGibralter 1-4 Faroe Islands: 1st March 2014\n\nFaroe Islands 3-0 Liechtenstein: 25th March 2018\n\nBiggest Defeat – Yugoslavia 7-0 Faroe Islands: 16th May 1991\n\nRomania 7-0 Faroe Islands: 6th May 1992\n\nFaroe Islands 0-7 Norway: 11th August 1993\n\nFaroe Islands 1-8 Serbia and Montenegro: 6th October 1996\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 0\n\nEuropean Championships Appearances – 0\n\nEuropean Nations League – Division D (Maintained Position in Group D For 2020/2021\n\nIslands Games Appearances – 2\n\nIslands Gaames Best Result – Winners: 1989, 1991\n\nGreenland Cup Appearances – 3 (Competition no longer in existence)\n\nGreenland Cup Best Result – Winners 1983, Shared win with Iceland 1984\n\nNational Stadium – Torsvollur: Capacity 6,000\n\nMost Caps – Frooi Benjaminsen (94) – Still playing.\n\nTop Goalscorer – Rogvi Jacobsen (10)\n\nHead Coach – Lars Olsen\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – 102\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN THE FAROE ISLAND\n\nWomen’s Football in The Faroe Islands has two National Divisions but at the time of writing without any promotion or relegation. From what I can asscertain from my research the top division comprises of five teams in 2019 and runs from March to September. The division is currently being led by Klaksvikar Itrottarfelag (Ki) after 8 rounds of games at the time of writing (7th June 2019). The 2nd Division also runs from March to September and comprises of 6 teams. The 2nd Division is currently being led by if/Vikingur/B68.\n\nKi are the most successful Womens Football team in Faroese history, currently with 18 top division titles to their name.\n\nFAROE ISLANDS WOMEN’S NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Iceland 6-0 Faroe Islands: Unofficial: 25th June 1986\n\nFaore Islands 0-2 Ireland: Official: 24th September 1995\n\nBiggest Win – Faroe Islands 16-0 Jersey: Unofficial: 12th July 2001\n\nFaroe Islands 8-0 Andorra: 6th April 2015\n\nBiggest Defeat – Germany 11-0 Faroe Islands: 24th October 2017\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 0\n\nEuropean Championships Appearances – 0\n\nIsland Games Appearances – 3\n\nIsland Games Best Result – Winners: 2001, 2003, 2005\n\nAlgarve Cup Appearnces – 1 (2009)\n\nAlgarve Cup best Result – 12th\n\nNational Stadium – Torsvollur: Capacity 6,000\n\nMost Caps – Rannva B.

The first National Championship in Iceland can be traced back to 1912, the winners of the inaugural Icelandic Championship were Knattspyrnufelag Reykjavikur (KR Reykjavik) the same club is the oldest in Iceland having been founded in 1899.\n\nA second division was introduced in 1955 enabling promotion and relegation in the country for the first time. Since then a third division (1966) fourth division (1982) and finally a fifth division was introduced in 2013.\n\nAs well as being the first club in Iceland to lift the first ever league championship in 1912, KR Reykjavik currently hold the record for most League titles (26) their last triumph coming in 2013. Knattspyrnufelagio Valur or just Valur for short are next in line with 22 titles, in third place comes Iprottabandalag Akraness (iA) with 18 title wins.\n\nIcelandic Football Clubs have been competing in UEFA organised cup competitions since 1964/1965 when KR Reykjavik appeared in that seasons European Cup. They played only one two legged tie in that seasons competiton in the Qualifying round losing 1-11 against Liverpool. KR have reached the thrid qualifying round of the UEFA Europa League on two occassions. Their progress on each of these occassions is as follows:\n\n2009/2010: 2Q 3-1 Aggregate Score Versus Larissa (Greece)\n\n3Q 3-5 Aggregate Score Versus Basel (Switzerland)\n\n2011/2012: 1Q 8-2 Aggregate Score Versus Itrottarfelag Fuglafjaroar (Faroe Islands)\n\n2Q 3-2 Aggregate Score Versus MSK Zilina (Slovakia)\n\n3Q 1-6 Aggregate Score Versus Dinamo Tibilisi (Georgia)\n\nIn terms of the Icelandic Cup – Again, KR Reykjavik are out in front with the most cup final victories, 14 wins at the time of writing, their last triumph coming in 2014 – and you’ve guessed it, they are also out in front with the most wins in the Deildabikar (the Icelandic League Cup) with 7 wins. The most recent win coming in 2017 when they beat Grindavik 4-0 in the final. The Icelandic Super Cup is headed by Valur with regards to number of wins – 11.\n\nICELAND NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Iceland 0-3 Denmark: 17th July 1946 (First official game)\n\nBiggest Win – Iceland 5-0 Malta: 27th July 2000 (official)\n\nBiggest Defeat – Denmark 14-2 Iceland: 23rd August 1967\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – 1\n\nBest World Cup Result – 2018 Group Stage\n\nEuropean Championships Appearances – 1\n\nBest European Championship Result – 2016 Quarter Finals\n\nEuropean Nations League – 2018/2019 Division A – Relegated\n\nGreenland Cup Appearances – 2\n\nGreenland Cup Best Result – Winners 1980 – Shared Trophy in 1984 with Faroe Islands\n\nChina Cup Appearances – 1\n\nChina Cup Best Result – 2017 Ruuners-up\n\nNational Stadium – Laugardalsvollur: Capacity 15,000\n\nMost Caps – Runar Kristinsson (104)\n\nTop Goalscorer – Eidur Gudjohnsen (26)\n\nHead Coach – Erik Hamren\n\nCurrent FIFA Ranking – 40\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN ICELAND\n\nThe top level of Women’s Club Football in Iceland is known as – Urvalsdeild Kvenna.

From the research I have conducted into football in Greenland, I have read that approaches from the country have been made to join FIFA and the hope is that one day the countries ambition of joining the World governing body of Football will be realised. Especially as FIFA now allow artifical turf pitches in international football to be used.\n\nGreenland does have it’s own Football Championship, namely – The Greenlandic Football Championship. It was first contested in 1954 with the first winners being Nuuk Idraetslag or Nuuk IL for Short. Since 1971 The Football Association of Greenland has organised the competition. Last year’s winners of the Championship were Boldklubben af 1967 or B-67 for short.\n\nThe Greenlandic Football Football Championship must go down as one if not the most unique national championships in the whole world, with the Championship being decided in one week! If we take a look at the 2018 Championship – Regional Qualifying games are played before the main championship week, the 2018 championship saw teams qualifying from the following regions:\n\nNorth Greenland\n\nDisko Bay\n\nCentral Greenland\n\nSouth Greenland\n\nThe regional qualifiers were played in a group format – the top two placed teams from North Greenland, Disko Bay and South Greenland were joined in the main championship week with four teams from Central Greenland – Qualified Teams were:\n\nGodhavn-44 Qeqertarsuaq (North Greenland)\n\nUpernavik BK 83 (North Greenland)\n\nKugsak-45 (Disko Bay)\n\nNagdlunguaq-48 (Disko Bay)\n\nBoldklubben af 1967 (Central Greenland)\n\nInuit Timersoqatigiiffiat-79 (Central Greenland)\n\nNuuk Idraetslag (Central Greenland)\n\nKagssagssuk Maniitsoq (Central Greenland)\n\nKissaviarsuk-33 (South Greenland)\n\nEqaluk-54 (South Greenland)\n\nThe ten qualifiers then took part in the main championship week held between 12th-19th August. The teams were split into two groups of 5 with the top two from each group progressing to the semi-final stages, all of the other teams that didnt progress did have play off matches to determine 9th place, 7th place so on and so forth. All of the games took place in the Capital City of Nuuk at the Nuuk Stadium.\n\nSemi-Final 1:\n\nNagdlungguaq-48 3-0 Inuit Timersoqatigiiffiat-79\n\nSemi-Final 2:\n\nNuuk IL 1-4 Boldklubben af 1967\n\nThird Place Match:\n\nNuuk IL 1-3 Inuit Timersoqatigiiffiat-79\n\nFinal:\n\nBoldklubben af 1967 2-0 Nagdlungguaq-48\n\nBy claiming their latest Greenlandic Football Championship and their 7th this decade, Boldklubben af 1967 increased their number of overall title wins to 13 meaning that they are the most successful club at present in Greenlandic Football History.\n\nGREENLAND NATIONAL FOOTBALL TEAM\n\nFirst International – Faore Islands 6-0 Greenland: 2nd July 1980\n\nBiggest Win – Greenland 16-0 Sark: 1st July 2003\n\nBiggest Defeat- Faroe Islands 6-0 Greenland: 2nd July 1980\n\nGuernsey 6-0 Greenland: 13th July 2005\n\nMencorca 6-0 Greenland: 29th June 2009\n\nIsle of Man 6-0 Greenland: 30th June 2017\n\nWorld Cup Appearances – N/A Not affilliated to FIFA\n\nIsland Games Appearances – 14\n\nIsland Games Best Results – Runners-up on two occassions: 2013, 2017\n\nFIFI Wild Cup Appearances – 1 (One competition held (2006) at the time of writing)\n\nFIFI Wild Cup Best Result – Group Stages 2006\n\nELF Cup Appearances – 1 (One competition held (2006) at the time of writing\n\nELF Cup Best Results – Group Stages 2006\n\nGreenland Cup Appearances – 3\n\nGreenland Cup Best Result – Runners-Up 1983\n\nNational Stadium – Nuuk Stadium: Capacity 2,000\n\nMost Caps – Not Known at the time of writing\n\nTop Goalscorer – Not known at the time of writing\n\nHead Coaches – Rene Olsen and Tekle Ghebrelul\n\nELO Ranking – 196\n\nWOMEN’S FOOTBALL IN GREENLAND\n\nUnfortunately at the time of writing I could find out very little about Women’s Football in Greenland other than the fact that Women do play the game in Greenland and indeed they do an International Team.\n\n…………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………….\n\nI have got to say that that I have really enjoyed writing this blog – whilst conducting my research into all of the featured countries, at certain times I was picturing myself watching football in all four countries. Whether it be in Argentina, watching the Superclasico between Boca Juniors v River Plate, watching an international fixture in the Faroe Islands, visiting the Laugardalsvollur Stadium in Iceland or spending a week in Greenland whilst taking in The Greenlandic Championship.\n\nI doubt that I will ever physically get to any of these fabulous Football destinations but saying that who knows what is around the corner.\n\nGareth Thomas\n\n7th June 2019"
