        "text": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. – Sacramento Republic FC announced on Wednesday the club had signed Bermuda international Zeiko Lewis, pending league and federation approval, bringing the attacking playmaker to the west coast after a standout 2021 campaign for fellow USL Championship club the Charleston Battery.\n\nLewis’s signing is pending receipt of his P-1 Visa and ITC, and league and federation approval. Per club policy, the terms of the contract were not disclosed.\n\n“Zeiko is a difference-maker with a proven ability to score and create chances,” said Republic FC President and General Manager Todd Dunivant. “His competitive drive demands excellence from himself and his teammates, and we look forward to adding Zeiko to our attack.”\n\nLewis joins Republic FC after three seasons with the Battery. Since 2019, he has been one of the most consistent attacking players in the Eastern Conference, recording 19 goals and 18 assists in 73 appearances across all competitions. He was named Charleston’s Offensive Player of the Year in 2019 and 2020 after leading the squad in scoring both seasons, and in 2021 was voted the team MVP after contributing five goals and team-best 10 assists, which ranked fourth in the league during the regular season.\n\nThe 27-year-old has also logged valuable minutes at the international level for the Bermuda National Football Team after earning his first senior cap at the age of 16. He has made 30 appearances for his country across all competitions and led the side to its first Concacaf Gold Cup appearance in 2019 while also competing in FIFA World Cup Qualification and the Concacaf Nations League.\n\nPrior to joining Charleston in 2019, Lewis played for two clubs in Iceland’s top division, the Urvalsdeild – Fimleikafélag Hafnarfjarðar (FH) and Handknattleiksfélag Kópavogs (HK).\n\nIn 2017, Lewis was selected 17th overall in the Major League Soccer SuperDraft by the New York Red Bulls, who loaned him to USL Championship affiliate Red Bulls II. In his rookie season, Lewis helped NYRBII reach the Eastern Conference Final of the 2017 USL Championship Playoffs as he recorded two goals and 23 key passes. Throughout his USL Championship career, he has won the Fans’ Choice Goal of the Week twice, as well as named Championship Player of the Week once.\n\nBefore joining the professional ranks, Lewis scored 18 goals and added 26 assists in 73 appearances over four seasons at Boston College. In his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons, he served as team captain and earned several conference accolades – including All-ACC First Team (2016) and All-ACC Second Team (2014, 2015). In high school, he was named an NSCAA All-American and scored in the High School All-American Game. He remains the career leader in every offensive category at Berkshire Academy (Massachusetts)."
