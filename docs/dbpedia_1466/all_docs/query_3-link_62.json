        "text": "The Deildabikar, also known as the Icelandic League Cup is a pre-season professional football competition in Iceland. It is considered the third most important competition in Icelandic football.\n\nThe pre-season tournament involves the top 22 clubs in Iceland from the previous season and the two clubs promoted from 2. deild, for a total of the 24 teams that will comprise the top two divisions in Iceland the following season. It generally takes place between February and May. The number of teams in the 2008 edition rose from 16 to 24.\n\nFormat[]\n\nThe 24 teams are divided into four pools of six teams. Each team meets each other once during the pool stage. The final positions of the group are determined after these 5 games are played. The top two of each group automatically gain entry to the next stage in the competition.\n\nFrom the quarter final round it is a purely knockout competition where ties take place over 1-leg only. If a tie is not decided in 90 minutes, penalty kicks are taken to decide the game.\n\nSince 2001, two other pre-season tournaments have been arranged in the same format for teams lower down in the Icelandic football league ladder.\n\nWinners[]\n\nClub Titles Year(s) KR 7 1998, 2001, 2005, 2010, 2012, 2016, 2017 FH 6 2002, 2004, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2014 ÍA 3 1996, 1999, 2003 Breiðablik 2 2013, 2015 Valur 2 2008, 2011 Grindavík 1 2000 ÍBV 1 1997\n\nFinals[]\n\nYear Winner Score Runner-up 1996 ÍA 3–1 (aet) Breiðablik 1997 ÍBV 3–2 (aet) Valur 1998 KR 2–2 (6–5p) Valur 1999 ÍA 1–0 Fylkir 2000 Grindavík 4–0 Valur 2001 KR 0–0 (5–3p) FH 2002 FH 2–2 (4–3p) Fylkir 2003 ÍA 1–1 (4–2p) Keflavik 2004 FH 2–1 KR 2005 KR 3–2 Þróttur 2006 FH 3–2 Keflavik 2007 FH 3–2 (aet) Valur 2008 Valur 4–1 Fram 2009 FH 3–0 Breiðablik 2010 KR 2–1 Breiðablik 2011 Valur 3–1 (aet) Fylkir 2012 KR 1–0 Fram 2013 Breiðablik 3–2 Valur 2014 FH 4–1 Breiðablik 2015 Breiðablik 1−0 KA 2016 KR 2−0 Víkingur R. 2017 KR 4–0 Grindavík\n\n[]\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20090415071050/http://ksi.is:80/\n\nhttp://www.rsssf.com/tablesi/ijsleagcuphist.html\n\nIcelandFootball.net - League cup results.
