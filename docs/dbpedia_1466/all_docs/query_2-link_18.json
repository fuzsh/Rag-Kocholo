        "text": "The Charleston Battery lost 1-0 to the Chicago Fire on the final night of the Carolina Challenge Cup.\n\nOn a night of chances for both sides, the Battery come up just short to finish out the preseason in 4th place with one point.\n\nChicago pressured the Battery early attacking down both wings with talents forwards in Aleksandar Katai and Nemanja Nikolic. The Battery defense defended well against a barrage of first-half crosses and dangerous passes through the box.\n\nIan Svantesson lead the attack for the Battery once again, and had chances to score for his 3rd consecutive match, but couldn’t find the back of the net. His first opportunity came in the 17th minute when Svantesson fought off two defenders after receiving a lofted through ball but pushed the shot wide of the far post.\n\nThe Battery continued to put pressure on the Chicago defense with a corner in the 27th minute. A quick pass found Tah Brain Anunga at the top of the eighteen-yard box and a chipped pass into Svantesson was headed just over the bar.\n\nThe first half concluded 0-0 but the Chicago Fire came out flying forcing a save from Joe Kuzminsky. Kuzminsky made a number of big save throughout the game to keep the Battery in the match.\n\nChicago’s breakthrough came in the 85th minute. The ball found its way into the boxed controlled nicely by Amando Moreno who found Fabian Herbers near the top of the box who slotted it past Kuzminsky.\n\nCharleston had an opportunity late as trialist Arthur Bosua ran at a group of Fire defends but couldn’t find the final ball to Romario Piggott who was making a run down the near sideline.\n\nThe Columbus Crew finished first in the cup, winning the competition for the third consecutive year. The Chicago Fire finished in second place followed by FC Cincinnati and the Charleston Battery.\n\nBoxscore:\n\nCHARLESTON –\n\nCHICAGO – 85′ Goal, Herbers. Assisted by Moreno.\n\nThe Battery kicked off the second day of the Carolina Challenge Cup with a 1-1 draw against former Challenge Cup winners, Columbus Crew.\n\nThe cold, rainy weather played a part early in the match as players attempted to find their footing on the slick surface. Both sides took advantage of the conditions by putting pressure on attackers and defenders alike.\n\nIan Svantesson put the Battery up 1-0 in the 25th minute, his second goal of the tournament. A quick spell of attacking play led to a Battery corner which resulted in the goal. Jared van Schaik’s cross found the head of Svantesson, giving the Columbus goalie no chance at making a save.\n\nThe Battery came inches from doubling their lead late in the first half thanks to a powerful header from midfielder Vincenzo Candela. Jared van Schaik’s chipped ball in from the left side connected with Candela. The header hit the middle of the crossbar before being cleared by the Columbus defence.\n\nThe Battery nearly made it to half time unscathed, but a late stoppage time goal from Robinho leveled things up. Columbus Crew attacker Edward Opoku provided the assist with a quick pass across the box which evaded the Battery defense and found Robinho in the middle of the box.\n\nSecond half heroics from goalkeeper Joe Kuzminsky and defender Leland Archer preserved the draw for the Battery. A late Crew attack forced a number of saves from Kuzminsky and a critical block on the goal line from Archer.\n\nThe result leaves the Battery on one point through two matches with a final game against the Chicago Fire on February 23rd at 7:30 PM.\n\nThe 2019 Carolina Challenge Cup wraps up on the 23rd.

Goals from Fanendo Adi and Darren Mattocks propelled FC Cincinnati to a win in a game that saw both teams convert on penalties.\n\nIt only took two minutes for FC Cincinnati to get their first goal of the evening. A fast build-up of play and short quick passes led to a Darren Mattocks pass across the box, which connected with the former Portland Timbers foot. Battery goalkeeper, Joe Kuzminksy, made the initial save only to see the ball land back at Adi’s feet and led to an easy tap in.\n\nThe Battery’s best chance of the first half came in the 31st minute when Tah Brian Anunga found himself at the top of the box and had a shot on goal. The shot was blocked by a Cincinnati defender and out for a corner. The ensuing corner produced another opportunity for the Battery as Cincinnati’s goalkeeper couldn’t handle the cross. A scramble broke out in front of goal but a defender was able to clear the danger.\n\nComing out of halftime, the Battery made nine substitutions to the starting eleven, with a number of trialists getting a look. New Battery signing Zeiko Lewis played 68 minutes and was presented with the Heineken Man of the Match award.\n\nIan Svantesson would equalize in the 52nd minute from the spot. A shot from Dante Marini hit the hand of a Cincinnati defender and was ruled a penalty. Svantesson stepped up cooly and converted the penalty to equalize. Five minutes later FC Cincinnati would claim a penalty of their own to go back on top. Adi drew the foul and Mattocks finished.\n\nThe Battery are back in action on Wednesday, February 20th, as they take on the Columbus Crew who tied in their opening match against the Chicago Fire.\n\nBoxscore:\n\nCHARLESTON – Ian Svantesson, goal 52′\n\nCINCINNATI – Fanendo Adi, goal 2′ Darren Mattocks, goal 57′ (PEN)\n\nCharleston Battery youth academy product, Nico Rittmeyer has signed a new, multi-year contract ahead of the 2019 season.\n\nDespite growing up in Savannah, Georgia, Rittmeyer has played nearly his entire soccer career in Charleston. At the age of 11, Rittmeyer and his dad started making the two-hour trek to and from Charleston to play for Summerville Soccer Club under former Battery player Clark Brisson. With the support of the Battery, Brission helped create the Charleston Battery Academy, merging Rittmeyer’s team with other clubs in the area shortly after his first trip to Charleston.\n\nDuring Rittmeyer’s time with the academy as a teenager, Battery Head Coach Mike Anhaeuser invited him to train with the first team. Rittmeyer played his first matches for the professional club as a 17-year old against the Chicago Fire and Toronto FC at the 2011 Carolina Challenge Cup.\n\n“It was crazy being thrown into that environment as a teenager,” said Rittmeyer. “But, I gained a lot of valuable experience as a youth player in the Battery system. Testing myself against professional players and other high level youth players from a young age prepared me for the next level.”\n\nFor Rittmeyer, the next level was NCAA Division 1 with the University of North Carolina, however, an injury cut his freshman season short. After recovering from the injury and finishing his first year at Chapel Hill, Rittmeyer sought out a fresh start and elected to transfer from UNC. For his fresh start, Rittmeyer turned to the familiar and put the school in his adopted hometown at the top of his list.\n\nRittmeyer transferred to College of Charleston to play under former Cougar assistant coach Troy Lesesne, who is now the head coach of the new USL Championship franchise New Mexico United. Lesesne knew Rittmeyer from his time with the academy, giving him leverage to lure the highly-touted recruit to The College.\n\n“Troy was a coach at the academy when I was coming through the system, so I knew him pretty well,” said Rittmeyer. “He’s a great coach and had a plan to help get me to the professional level. Unfortunately he left midway through my first semester to take a job with the Battery first team, so I didn’t get to play under him for very long” Despite Lesesne’s absence, Rittmeyer flourished as a Cougar in his new, but familiar, setting. During his three seasons with The College, Rittmeyer scored 13 goals and registered four assists in 50 starts. He served as team captain for all three seasons and earned several all-conference awards.\n\nHis performances with CofC earned him an invite to Anhaeuser’s trials a few months after the end of his senior season. Rittmeyer earned a contract shortly thereafter and spent the majority of his rookie season as a role player.\n\n“My first season was a huge learning experience for me,” Rittmeyer said. “I just showed up every day with a hunger to train and get better. I put my head down, worked as hard as I could, and leaned on some of the veterans like Taylor [Mueller] and [Odisnel] Cooper to help me navigate through that first year.”\n\nThe hard work as a rookie paid off in year two. In his second season as a professional, Rittmeyer scored four goals and tallied four assists in 32 appearances. He was named USL Player of the Week in July and finished the season with the 26 chances created, the third highest total on the team.\n\n“I was much more comfortable from the start in my second season,” said Rittmeyer. “I had a year of training in that environment day in and day out under my belt which really helped my confidence. I think what I did last year is true representation of my abilities and I’m looking to build on that in 2019.”\n\nRittmeyer’s efforts in the Battery’s run to an eleventh consecutive playoff appearance earned him a new, multi-year contract with his hometown Club.\n\n“I’m excited,” Rittmeyer said of the new contract. “This is an amazing city and a great Club with a long history of success. I love living here and I love playing here. It’s cool to see things come full circle; to get to play here as a pro after all the hard work I put in as a youth player is rewarding.”\n\nFresh off signing his new contract, Rittmeyer hit ground running when preseason officially began on Sunday, February 10 with a match against his alma mater. Eight years after his first appearance in Challenge Cup, Rittmeyer will take part in his third CCC this weekend when the Battery opens the tournament against FC Cincinnati.\n\n“All the boys are ready to get started,” Rittmeyer said. “Challenge Cup always offers us the chance to see what we have against some of the best teams in the country early on in preseason. I’m looking forward to building on what I did last year and helping the team get back to the playoffs to give ourselves a chance to win the championship.”\n\nTickets for Carolina Challenge Cup are on sale now at https://www.www.charlestonbattery.com.
