        "text": "Overall it was a very fun and enjoyable day. It was nice to spend most of the day as a team and to be able to talk to everyone that I had not spent as much time with the first few days.\n\nFriday, May 18 - David \"Geordie\" Brown | Head Coach\n\nToday started with a 45-minute ride to the Lava Tunnel at Raufarholshellier. It was pretty remote there, basically only a hut. After getting our instructions, and helmets with lights we were led out the back door and into the tunnel. We descended into caves where it was amazing to see the build-up of ice and snow sculptures naturally made underground. The tunnel is one of the biggest core tunnels in Iceland. Our guide (Daniel) explained how we were going \"upstream\" in terms of the lava flow. The tunnel was huge and rugged. Unlike many tourist areas in the US, in Iceland there are fewer safeguards like ropes, paths, lighting, etc. We were able to climb over the Lava Rocks to get to a perfect picture spot. The colors in the tunnel walls were so vivid and explained the boiling lava and cooling that took places thousands of years ago. The tour lasted about an hour and gave us a glimpse inside something very Icelandic.\n\nWe returned to our hotel in time for lunch. The Coaches decided to walk down to the harbor and have a pre-game lunch meeting over Reykjavik Fish and Chips. While in the harbor it was a good chance to check up on the tours and excursions that we will be taking tomorrow from that area.\n\nAt 3:15 p.m., we left the hotel to listen to a presentation at the Iceland University by Sociology Professor Viðar Halldórsson. He has been studying Why Iceland, with its population of just over 300,000 can compete and be successful in team sports against countries 10, 50, 100 or 1000 times bigger. It was a fascinating look at how the team is bigger than the individual. He looked at success in sports like Handball, Soccer and Basketball and how the community feel of sports in Iceland plays a big part in creating a team atmosphere. One of the things he looked at was the number of times in a game players celebrated something good happening (with gestures). Iceland teams more than doubled their actions in this area than their opponents in the games studied. He also looked at communication and positive body language. He was able to quantify these into data to show Icelanders are real team players. I think it gave our team a lift going into our evening game.\n\nAfter leaving the university, we traveled the short drive to a place called Grotta. This is in the north-east corner of Reykjavik, right on the coast. The field was set against a wonderful backdrop of the Atlantic ocean on one side and snow-covered mountains on the other. The game went very well for the Scots, with early first-half goals from forwards, Miura Wiley and Erica White, however by half-time the home team had evened up the score at 2-2. Within seconds of the second half starting Claire Davis restored our lead and Erica White added a 2ndto have the game finish up 4-2. The defense kept Grotta at bay in the second half and secured the victory. Our hosts at Grotta were extremely hospitable and good competition. We ended the soccer part of the trip with 2 wins and a loss. Not too shabby!\n\nWe returned to the Hotel Fron for a shower and late dinner. The Chicken, Lobster and Fish Pasta's were all very tasty. Tomorrow, we are back to being tourists as the group splits up and chooses between whale watching, horseback riding, puffin watching or the Blue Lagoon.\n\nSaturday, May 19 - Emma Lawrence | Jr., Defender\n\nWe began our morning with the usual hotel breakfast that never failed to fill our tummies. We trekked down to the harbor for whale watching; however, the weather did not permit it. The rain began to pick up and the waves began to crash over the rocks, but that did not stop us. We attempted a few whale calls in hopes the whales would come out to say hello; we had no luck.\n\nPuffin tours were the next go-to. As we waited for the 11 o'clock puffin tour, we sat in the Röst and enjoyed some coffee and bonding time. Games of chess and Jenga occupied the time until we were soon disappointed that the weather did not permit the puffin tours, as they were also too scared of the weather. However, our teammates had luck at the Blue Lagoon for some relaxation and horseback riding on the native Icelandic horses.\n\nThe flea market was the next big stop for us on this Saturday afternoon. There were many vendors with an assortment of items and most importantly... free samples. Most of the team and even coach Wes Davis got the famous Icelandic hot dogs, an absolute must. Claire Davis and I finished off a wonderful morning of whale calls and flea market adventures with a nice, long, needed nap before dinner. We were treated to an awesome dinner at Lebowski's of burgers, fries, and shakes! Basically back in America, right? As we ate, we watched the Manchester United versus Chelsea FA cup final game. Chelsea won off a questionable PK call early in the first half. After dinner, many of us packed and first stopped for crêpes (again) and then began our search for a fun place to enjoy some live music on our last night here. And that is Emma Lawrence signing off...\n\nSunday, May 20 - Wes Davis | Assistant Coach\n\nToday was the last day in Iceland... what do you do on the last day? You do everything you wanted to do previously, you shop til you drop, you eat at your favorite little restaurant, you recover from the experiences of earlier days, you see Puffins!\n\nThe breakfast in the hotel has been the starting point for many, fill up your tank to take on Reykjavík. I've enjoyed decent coffee, breakfast meats and cheeses and yogurts. On days like today when the itinerary has been light, the players on the team have scattered to explore end interact with Iceland. Before the players left this morning they did have to pack and stow their luggage. We had a mountain of bags stacked in the lobby nearly as tall as Mt. Esja."
