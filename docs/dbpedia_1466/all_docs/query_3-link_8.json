        "text": "We are all on the same team. Icelandair is proud to support Iceland’s sporting teams, including its men’s and women’s football (soccer) teams, and its handball and basketball squads.\n\nThe sporting world´s newest crush is the Iceland men’s football team, after its amazing run at Euro 2016 in France. The supporters’ Viking thunder-clap and our favorite commentator Gummi Ben received plenty of media attention, but it was the team’s heart and dedication that won it thousands of new fans around the world.\n\nAfter the team´s brilliant result at Euro 2016 (reaching the quarterfinals, and eliminating England in its wake), the fairytale continues. In 2018, Iceland will play at the FIFA World Cup in Russia. Iceland is the smallest nation to ever qualify for the tournament.\n\nIcelandair has had a long and successful partnership with the Football Association of Iceland (KSÍ). We are the main sponsor of the national team and look forward to flying Our Boys to Russia 2018. Áfram Ísland! (Go Iceland!)\n\nInteresting Icelandic Football Facts\n\nAs a nation of just 350,000, Iceland is the smallest nation ever to qualify for the European Championship finals. Before Iceland, the smallest nation to qualify was Slovenia, with a population just under 2 million\n\nIn 2017, Iceland became the smallest nation ever to qualify for the World Cup. Before Iceland, that honor was held by Trinidad and Tobago, which qualified for the 2006 World Cup with a population of 1.3 million\n\nThe nickname for the men's national team in Iceland, Strákarnir okkar, means Our Boys. Similarly, the women's team is referred to as Stelpurnar okkar, or Our Girls\n\nA rough estimate indicated that about 8% of the Icelandic population accompanied the team to France for Euro 2016\n\nIn 2017, approximately 23,000 individuals are registered football practitioners in Iceland, according to statistics from the Football Association of Iceland. About one third of these players are female\n\nIn late 2017, the Iceland men's team is ranked 21 in FIFA's world ranking. In October 2012, Iceland ranked 131st, the lowest it has ever been\n\nThe Iceland Euro qualifying team consisted of players that have played together since the early stages and youth teams. The core of the squad has also remained together on a national level since the U17\n\nHeimir Hallgrímsson, the team's coach, works part time as a dentist in his home town of Vestmannaeyjar\n\nICELAND’S JOURNEY TO EURO 2016 & RUSSIA 2018\n\nEarly Stars of Icelandic Football\n\nAlthough football has remained a popular sport in Iceland since its heyday in the 1890s, the Icelandic national football team has not been very successful until recently. Before 2000, Iceland had produced only a few decent players that would go on and make their mark as professional footballers.\n\nAlbert Guðmundsson was the first Icelandic player to play at a professional level. In 1944 he moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where he played for Rangers in wartime football. After a brief spell in Glasgow he moved to London, where he played for Arsenal, still at an amateur level. In 1947, Guðmundsson became the first Icelander to play professional football, when he signed with Nancy in France and later AC Milan in Italy.\n\nÁsgeir 'Sigi' Sigurvinsson is widely regarded as one of the greatest players Iceland has ever produced. He had a successful career in Germany, where, in 1984, he captained Stuttgart towards winning the Bundesliga for the first time in 32 years, earning himself a Player of the Year nomination.\n\nOther notable players from the latter half of the 20th century include Pétur Pétursson, Guðni Bergsson, Atli Eðvaldsson and Arnór Guðjohnsen - Eiður Smári Guðjohnsen's father.\n\nA New Beginning\n\nIn the early 2000s, the Icelandic Football Association (KSÍ) realised it needed to revise its approach from the bottom up. In 2002 it began strategic reformulation of the coaching education it provided, eventually receiving A and B licences from UEFA.\n\nAnother important step was the rise of indoor training halls. With Iceland going through an economic boom, significant amounts of funds went into building quality training grounds, both indoors and outdoors, that were available all year round. The youth teams now had a chance to practice their technique despite harsh winter weather or wet summers.\n\nThe Football Association’s plans began to bear results. In 2011, the men's U21 team reached the final stages of Euro 2011 in Denmark. The core of that team would later move up into the first team. This is the team that represented Iceland at Euro 2016.\n\nRise of the Indoor Kids\n\nLagerbäck and Hallgrímsson's appointment in 2011 marked the moment when things began to turn. Soon after his arrival, Lagerbäck stated his ambition to take the Iceland team to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil. Although the general population cheered, it was considered a bold statement. And yet, Iceland finished second within their qualifying group, sending them into the playoffs where they were ultimately defeated by Croatia.\n\nWe Are All on the Same Team\n\nIn 1946, Icelandair teamed up with the national team by flying the squad to Scotland, where they played a series of games considered their first international away games. Ever since, Icelandair has accompanied the national team on their exciting journey.\n\nHighlights of Icelandic Football History\n\nDespite the lack of tradition, people in Iceland are proud of the most successful moments in Icelandic football history. These are the highlights:"
