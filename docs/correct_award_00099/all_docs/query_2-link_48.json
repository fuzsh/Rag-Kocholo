        "text": "“Please bring the lady one green tea,” went the request. “She has won the Nobel Prize.” Svetlana Alexievich, the sixty-seven-year-old winner of this year’s prize in literature, was at a table for ten in the front of a noisy restaurant in Berlin, where she held her Nobel press conference, two weekends ago. Alexievich is a little over five feet tall and stocky; her straight shoulder-length hair is dyed a redder shade of brown than it once was. The waitress nodded respectfully, motioning toward a stack of books on the table to show that she understood. Germans were protesting a trade agreement between the United States and the European Union, and the center of the city was closed to traffic. After answering an hour’s worth of questions—most of them about Belarusian and Russian politics—Alexievich had walked for blocks in the cold wind before ducking into the restaurant with a group of friends and publishers.\n\nThis year’s literature Nobel is the first to be awarded to a writer who works exclusively with living people. Her books deal with historical crises—the Second World War, the Soviet war in Afghanistan, the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl, and the collapse of the Soviet Union—through the voices of ordinary individuals. This is oral history stripped down to segments so raw that it can stretch both credulity and the reader’s tolerance for pain. At the beginning of “Voices from Chernobyl,” published in Russia in 1997, a young woman describes watching her husband, a firefighter, die from radiation poisoning:\n\nAt the morgue they said, “Want to see what we’ll dress him in?” I do! They dressed him up in formal wear, with his service cap. They couldn’t get shoes on him because his feet had swelled up. They had to cut up the formal wear, too, because they couldn’t get it on him, there wasn’t a whole body to put it on. It was all—wounds. The last two days in the hospital—I’d lift his arm, and meanwhile the bone is shaking, just sort of dangling, the body has gone away from it. Pieces of his lungs, of his liver, were coming out of his mouth. He was choking on his internal organs. I’d wrap my hand in a bandage and put it in his mouth, take out all that stuff. It’s impossible to talk about. It’s impossible to write about. And even to live through. It was all mine. My love. They couldn’t get a single pair of shoes to fit him. They buried him barefoot.\n\nAlexievich told me, “We live in an environment of banality. For most people, that’s enough. But how do you get through? How do you rip off that coating of banality? You have to make people descend into the depths of themselves.” Announcing the award, the Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, credited Alexievich with inventing a new literary genre, which she called “a history of emotions—a history of the soul, if you wish.”\n\nAlexievich’s books are published all over the world, but mostly by small presses. “Voices from Chernobyl” came out ten years ago in the United States, released by Dalkey Archive Press, a small nonprofit publisher. (The translator was my brother, Keith Gessen.) She has won awards, including a 2005 National Book Critics Circle Award and, in 2013, the Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. But her most recent major prize before the Nobel was the French Prix Médicis Essai, reserved for writers whose fame has yet to match their talent.\n\nAlexievich, who writes in Russian, is from Belarus, a country of fewer than ten million people, which has been run since 1994 by Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet Army officer. Belarus has maintained a close relationship with Russia, and is probably the most Soviet of the fifteen post-Soviet countries, with a largely state-controlled economy and stringent restrictions on free speech and assembly. For a long time, Alexievich’s books were brought into Belarus from Russia and sold on the black market. In recent years, as Lukashenko has attempted to improve relations with the West, her books have been allowed in stores.\n\nAlexievich has lived most of her adult life in a small apartment—two rooms and a kitchen—in a ten-story Soviet-era apartment block in central Minsk, the capital. Her parents are dead, and her daughter—who is, in fact, the daughter of her late sister, whom she adopted when the girl was four—teaches at a trade school in Minsk and is raising her own daughter. A longtime companion lives in the apartment next door.\n\nIn recent years, Alexievich has been looking for a bigger apartment, but she is reluctant to give up the bright light and the view of the Svisloch River, and hopes to get a place in the same building, with windows facing the same direction. The thought of moving fills her with dread. The prize money—a little less than a million dollars—will not help, she told me, because she cannot delegate the renovations: she cannot find anyone in Minsk whose taste matches hers. She likes solid shapes, simple lines, and no clutter.\n\nAlexievich is the first person to receive the Nobel for books that are based entirely on interviews. This has led some writers to laud the committee for recognizing a journalist. The headline of a Los Angeles Times piece announcing the prize called Alexievich a reporter, a term she finds almost insulting. “I’ve known since I was five that I wanted to be a writer,” not a journalist, she said. In Russian publishing, the line between fiction and nonfiction is often blurred—her books tend to be classified as proza, with literary novels—but the border between journalism and literature is inviolable.\n\nHer parents were rural schoolteachers, and she grew up the oldest of three children in a family that began in abject poverty and achieved a life that was modest even by Soviet standards. She applied to the journalism department of Belarusian State University, because it was the closest thing she could imagine to a writing school. A generation earlier, during Stalin’s reign, her father dropped out of the department to serve in the Red Army, and later, after a relative was arrested, left his career in journalism.\n\nShe worked at a newspaper, wrote poetry and plays and screenplays, but kept looking, as she puts it, “to create a new text.” She drew inspiration from her mentor, the Belarusian writer Ales Adamovich, whose genre was oral history, but she had less patience for authorial intrusions than Adamovich did. His best-remembered work, “The Book of the Siege,” written with Daniil Granin, a fellow Soviet-era liberal, is a people’s history of the siege of Leningrad, from 1941 to 1944. “There is this story of a boy and his mother, who share an apartment with a woman who steals,” Alexievich told me. “The boy and his mother are starving to death.” As Alexievich recalled, the boy knows that the woman’s stash includes half a meatball, and he struggles over whether to take it. “And suddenly there are three pages of ruminations on the nature of the Russian intelligentsia. The thing I always say is ‘Don’t put yourself next to the meatball. You’ll lose.’ ”\n\nAlexievich wanted to dispense with the author’s voice and with the usual chronologies and contexts. She wanted to approximate the voices she heard in her childhood, when village women gathered in the evenings and told stories about the Second World War. It was always women, because most of the men had been killed in the war, and the few remaining ones were typically passed out drunk. Alexievich was born three years after the war ended, in Soviet Ukraine, and grew up in Soviet Belarus, where the Nazis had exterminated Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs, and burned down entire villages.\n\nWhen she started gathering material for her first book, she told me, she looked for women who had stories similar to those she remembered from her childhood and asked them “about the things I wanted to know.” She spoke to women who had been in the military. “I had no interest in how many people they had killed or how; I wanted to know how a woman feels.” She added, “I was young, so they told me stories as older women do to a younger one.” Focussing on women was a wise decision, Alexievich said: “Women tell things in more interesting ways. They live with more feeling. They observe themselves and their lives. Men are more impressed with action. For them, the sequence of events is more important.” Women’s voices predominate in her later work, too.\n\nThe resulting book, “War Has Not a Woman’s Face,” was published in abridged form in 1984, in the Moscow-based journal Oktyabr, after being rejected by journals in Belarus as “pacifist and naturalistic.” It consisted of a series of monologues by female survivors. The glorious victory in the Great Patriotic War was the driving myth of Soviet propaganda, and the job of Soviet writers was to praise Soviet military might and to exalt the Soviet citizen. Instead, these women recounted the bloody and messy tragedies they saw on the ground.\n\nAccording to Alexievich, Mikhail Gorbachev read the piece, and then used the title in a speech, turning it into a literal Party line. This was the dawn of glasnost, a new openness in literary and intellectual life, and the Soviet people were about to focus, briefly and painfully, on the country’s history. “War Has Not a Woman’s Face” was published in book form in 1985 and eventually sold more than two million copies in Russian, and won Alexievich one of the highest Soviet civilian honors, the Lenin Komsomol Prize. An uncensored edition was not published until after the Soviet Union fell, six years later.\n\nIn “The Last Witnesses,” written after “Woman’s Face” but published the same year, Alexievich spoke to people who had experienced the Second World War as children. Unlike the women in her first book, most of these narrators had not been soldiers. Perestroika began in 1985, the year Alexievich became a nationally known author. Suddenly, it was possible to openly question the myths and policies of the Soviet Union, and Alexievich used her newfound fame to make her way to Afghanistan, where the Soviet Union had been fighting Afghan rebels and the mujahideen since 1979.\n\n“Boys of Zinc,” which featured the voices of Soviet soldiers, their mothers, and their widows, was published in 1989, the year that the Soviet Union pulled out of Afghanistan. (The title of the existing English translation, “Zinky Boys,” is unfortunate; the reference is to the sealed caskets in which bodies were shipped back to the U.S.S.R.) Alexievich had punctured another myth of Soviet military might: she showed the soldiers as scared, confused, impoverished and humiliated boys. “It was my first time at a war,” she told me. “I was so shaken by what I was seeing—the dead, how simply they kill, how then they drink vodka, sell, laugh, barter. It was the Soviet period, and they wanted to get souvenirs for their mothers, but where did they get the money? They sold bullets, which, the following day, would be used to kill them.”\n\nIn 1992, some of the subjects of “Boys of Zinc,” along with an organization representing the mothers of soldiers killed in the war, sued Alexievich for libelling the Soviet military. Called as a witness, a soldier’s mother said, “You are saying that I should hate the state and the Party. But I am proud of my son! He died an officer in battle. His comrades loved him. I love the country we used to live in, the U.S.S.R., because my son died for it. And I hate you! I don’t need your scary truth.”\n\nAlexievich prevailed in court, but the trial marked a turning point. The Soviet Union had collapsed in 1991, taking with it the idea of “restructuring” (the literal meaning of perestroika) the regime. In most of what had been the Soviet Union, reaction set in—the project of questioning Soviet mythology began to seem irrelevant or, worse, insulting to people who now felt its loss. In more recent years, with Vladimir Putin in power, the official ideology is anti-democratic, nationalist, and suspicious of voices like Alexievich’s. As her fame increased abroad, her popularity in Russia faded.\n\nOn the eve of the Nobel announcement, Colta, a highbrow Russian online culture publication, posted a short item headed “Why You Should Know Who Svetlana Alexievich Is.” The crux of the piece was that Russians should care about the writer because foreigners do.\n\nThe state-controlled media in Russia greeted the Nobel with an outpouring of vitriol reminiscent of Soviet newspapers’ reactions to most of the earlier Russian-language Nobels. Almost invariably, the Swedish Academy has recognized writers who opposed the Soviet regime. In 1933, the prize went to the émigré writer Ivan Bunin, whom Literaturnaya Gazeta branded a “full-grown wolf of the counterrevolution.” In 1958, Boris Pasternak was chosen, after “Doctor Zhivago” had been smuggled to the West with the help of the C.I.A. “He has been rewarded for his willingness to play the bait on the rusty fishing hook of anti-Soviet propaganda,” Literaturnaya Gazeta wrote. Pasternak was forced to decline the prize. When Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn won, in 1970, his books were banned in the Soviet Union. After the first volume of “The Gulag Archipelago” was published in the West, in 1973, Solzhenitsyn was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and exiled. Joseph Brodsky had been kicked out of the country, for insisting on writing poetry instead of working a regular Soviet job, fifteen years before he received the Nobel, in 1987.\n\nThis year, in Izvestia, Zakhar Prilepin, one of Russia’s best-known writers, said that Alexievich was “not a writer,” and that she had been chosen only for her opposition to the Kremlin—and for not actually being Russian. “We get the picture: Bunin, Solzhenitsyn, Pasternak, Brodsky,” he wrote. Alexievich’s agent, Galina Dursthoff, who lives in Cologne, told me that she had accumulated a pile of hate mail from Russia comparable to the pile of congratulations from elsewhere in the world. The writers blasted the Nobel committee for awarding the prize to “a Russophobe” as well as “a Jew and a lesbian.” (Alexievich is not Jewish and has never made any public statements about her personal life.)\n\nAlexievich says the word “information” with the kind of disdain that a different kind of Belarusian might reserve for “capitalism.” Information, in her view, rules the world and means nothing. “I just don’t believe that ‘new facts’ can help us understand anything,” she told me, referring to the slew of recent books about Russia and the former Soviet Union. Often, she includes in her books only the subject’s name, age, and profession. These are important, she said, because they express the “measure of our time on earth” and “the angle at which we view life.” Occasionally, she gives the briefest of descriptions, meant to confirm the subjects’ testimony, as at the end of this fragment from a conversation with a fifty-seven-year-old writer—a survivor of internal exile that killed her parents—included in “Second-Hand Time” (2013), an oral history of the post-Soviet legacy:\n\nI am walking with Vladya. . . . We are carrying a feather shawl. . . . It’s a beautiful thing for some other world. It’s made to order. Vladya knew how to knit, and we lived on that. The woman paid us and then said, “How about I cut some flowers for you?” A bouquet for us? . . . We had only ever thought about bread, but this person saw that we were capable of thinking of other things too. That meant we weren’t different from other people. You were locked in, shut down, and a window was cracked for you. . . . She wasn’t going to pick them or grab them, she was going to cut them for us in her own garden. That was the moment. . . . It may have been the key. . . . I was handed the key. . . . It turned me around. . . . I remember those flowers. . . . A large bunch of asters. . . . I always plant them at my own dacha now. (We happen to be talking at her dacha. The only things growing here are flowers and trees.)\n\nThe woman describes surviving events more tragic, difficult, and frightening than many readers could imagine: being exiled, living in a mud hut, losing her parents and her older sister. But Alexievich answers questions of consequence—Did this person survive? Did she see her family again? Was the truth discovered?—not when they would naturally occur to the reader, as a journalist might, but, in the way of a novelist, when her character addresses them, which may be never. “I am a writer who happens to use some tools of journalism,” she said.\n\nWhen she began writing down speech, around 1980, Alexievich realized that she could not take notes by hand. She needed to preserve the subject’s every word, including the silences. “When people talk, it matters how they place words next to each other,” she said. A tape recorder in Belarus cost about five hundred rubles, roughly three months’ salary, money that she borrowed from Adamovich and several other older writers. She developed a process that she still uses: she tapes conversations, has them transcribed, then writes from transcripts, longhand, often rehearsing the monologue out loud. A book takes between five and ten years and represents the voices of anywhere from three hundred to five hundred interview subjects. It contains about a hundred voices, of which ten to twenty are what she calls “pillars,” subjects she’ll interview up to twenty times each. “It’s like painting a portrait,” she said. “You keep going back and making calls, adding a stroke at a time.”\n\nAlexievich told me that “Voices from Chernobyl” was her easiest book to write: nothing like those events had happened before, “so people had no culture to protect them.” She began researching the book almost immediately after the disaster, in 1986, so she was able to capture raw feeling on the page. “I realized you have to follow history,” she said. “This genre works for epic stories only.” Still, the events serve to get at the hidden heart of a person. “I work to create an image of time and the person who lived through it.”\n\nWhile Alexievich was working on the book, she came to realize that she was writing a cycle on what she calls the Red man, the Soviet person. It began with the most mythologized event in the formation of the Red man—the Great Patriotic War—and ended with the collapse of the Soviet Empire. “Voices from Chernobyl” was the fourth book in the series. The fifth and final volume, “Second-Hand Time,” is her most ambitious work: many women and a few men talk about the loss of the Soviet idea, the post-Soviet ethnic wars, the legacy of the Gulag, and other aspects of the Soviet experience. Alexievich said, “We are surrounded by victims. Who did it all to them? Aliens? Questions like that come up, but these are working questions—I only need them in the process.”\n\nAlexievich is now working on two books—one about old age and dying, and the other about love. Neither centers on a historical event, and neither, she says, is going very well: “When I started recording, I found I had a problem. The older generation is a Soviet generation. They have to talk about themselves and they have no experience of doing that. You start talking to them about love, and they talk about how they built Minsk. You start talking to them about old age, they tell you how difficult life was after the war. It’s like they never had a life of their own.”\n\nPerestroika was a blessed time, Alexievich said: “People became more interesting. They actually started paying more attention to details of the past. They were a different kind of people.” When she was writing “Second-Hand Time,” she had the sense that her subjects were finding nothing new for themselves in the past or in the present. The hope engendered by perestroika was gone, and people were trying to recycle old ideas and attachments. This pursuit appeared so desperate that for a while Alexievich thought she was writing a book about suicide. In 1993, she published a short book on the subject, called “Enchanted by Death”; those stories later became a part of “Second-Hand Time.”\n\nAlexievich keeps in touch with many of her subjects, who often tell her new stories; a phone call, she said, can “just blow up that previous knowledge.” She often expands her books for new editions. “For, what is a person?” she asked. “It depends on his mood, and who his friends are, and what books he’s read, and even whether you are visiting in the morning or in the evening. Everything means something.” So what is a person? “Of course, you can never come face to face with reality—it is unknowable—but you can grab a solid substance, something.” Mostly, she encounters pain. Many of her subjects talk about “carrying” pain or “handing over” pain, as if that is how they understand their relationship with the interviewer—as the process of transferring their pain.\n\nIn the early aughts, Alexievich decided to leave Belarus, in part to protest the authoritarian politics of Lukashenko, in part to save her energies for writing. “No one was chasing after me with a Kalashnikov,” she said. Unlike some Belarusian intellectuals who were arrested or “disappeared,” Alexievich was protected by her international renown. At the same time, as a public person, she felt she had to add her voice to the opposition’s weak chorus. In 2000, she co-founded a human-rights group called Helsinki XXI. “But I was tired of being on the barricades,” she said. “I realized I was giving in to the passion of the fight. That’s the most dangerous thing that can happen to an artist: revolutions are dangerous, barricades are. They are intellectual traps. Russian culture is a culture of the barricade. I needed to free myself of this, and I realized that in the world in which I was living there was no one whose example I could follow—no one who had freed himself of this.” One escape route that intellectuals had used since the nineteen-seventies was religion (Lyudmila Ulitskaya and Alexievich’s friend Olga Sedakova are two writers who took this path), but this did not appeal to Alexievich. “When I see a garden in flower, then I believe in God for a second,” she said. “But not the rest of the time.”\n\nShe moved to Western Europe, where she could secure writing fellowships for one or two years. She lived in Italy, Germany, France, and Sweden, never learning more than a word or two of the language. She made friends with her translators, she saw plays based on her books—with their emphasis on human speech, they lend themselves to the stage. “The world became more multicolored, more layered,” she said. She hoped that while she was abroad Lukashenko’s reign might end. But eventually, she said, “I was wrong to think I could sit him out.” She found herself in a different kind of intellectual trap: she was living where she could write freely but not use her immersion method. She went many months between trips to the former Soviet Union, and found that her subjects’ language was changing. A few years ago, she returned to Minsk.\n\nThe choice proved even lonelier than Alexievich expected. Her mentors are dead. Her peers have either emigrated or faded from view. In Western Europe, she said, she has fascinating friends who are in their seventies, but in Belarus people over fifty believe that life is over. Even casual acquaintances have disappeared. “I noticed that when I fly somewhere I don’t run into people of my generation at the airport anymore,” she said. “No one is going anywhere.”\n\nThe conventional ways of broadening her social circle do not appeal to her. “I cannot teach, because I can’t stand to repeat myself,” she said. “Also, there are very few talented young people.” Now that her books are openly sold in Belarus, she has readers, but “readers can give you nothing but banalities.” Not that she doesn’t like her readers—she just does not want to talk to them. “I’m not interested in people as such,” she said. “A conversation with someone who can be a real interlocutor, an actual exchange—but that happens so rarely.” She goes to Moscow to see photography exhibits. The visual images, she finds, stay with her for a long time and help with work. Music also helps: Alexievich listens to contemporary post-Soviet composers such as the Ukrainian Valentin Silvestrov, the Estonian Arvo Pärt, and the Russian Sergei Nevsky.\n\nShe no longer has much patience for fiction, even some that she used to love: “I tried rereading Platonov, but that kind of baroque voice doesn’t do it for me anymore. Even Tolstoy—I went to read his ‘Sevastopol Sketches,’ but I just can’t abide those masculine superstitions now.” She’s more interested in nonfiction, but, as Russia continues to isolate itself from the world, fewer interesting books are available in translation.\n\nStill, she has all that is essential for work: time and solitude. Alexievich thinks a lot about privacy, both her own and that of her subjects. The last story in “Voices from Chernobyl” is narrated by a woman who took care of her dying husband at home:"
