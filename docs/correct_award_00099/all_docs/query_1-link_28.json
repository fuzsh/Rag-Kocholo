        "text": "ON LITERATURE\n\nWhen Bob Dylan won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2016, I found myself impressed by the caliber of those who preceded him. Like many, I read his Nobel Lecture and found it inspiring. I then went on to read some of the Nobel Lectures by others whom have been so honored.\n\nIt’s an uncommon opportunity not to be taken lightly. Many of the best literary minds of the past century have distilled their best thoughts into something others can read and be inspired by.\n\nKudos to the Nobel committee and this catalog of wisdom and achievement that is preserved for us and available online to any and all.\n\nI’ve been on a Solzhenitsyn jag lately, somewhat astonished at how relevant his writings are today. For this reason I’ve been writing about his work in the hopes that others might revisit this writer’s extensive catalog.\n\nWhat follows are excerpts from Solzhenitsyn’s Nobel Lecture, which has much to say about the importance and power of art. I’ve included a link to the full transcript at the end. If you can find time I’d encourage you to read the whole."
