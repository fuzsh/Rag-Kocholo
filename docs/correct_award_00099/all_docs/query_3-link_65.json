        "text": "When I heard Alice Munro had won the Nobel Prize in Literature, I blurted, “Yeah!” My team had captured the holy grail of writers. “Yeah!”\n\nTo say I am on the same team as Munro is wild overstatement, but I can say she is the writer I most wanted to get the fabled phone call from Stockholm. Even more than Joyce Carol Oates and Bob Dylan, perennial sentimental favorites.\n\nMunro is one of only three Nobel laureates I had read before they won the prize. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn won in 1970 after he had written “Gulag Archipelago,” and after I had read “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovitch.” Another Russian, Mikhail Sholokhov, won in 1965, after I had read “And Quiet Flows the Don.”\n\nI read some of the other Nobel laureates after they had won and it was the fashionable thing to do, but many of them I have never read and never will. Nearly all the winners in recent times had names I could not pronounce and came from countries I could not find on a map.\n\nBut Praises Be! Alice Munro is a writer I know. She is a North American country girl, from Ontario, Canada. Except for a difference in latitude, she writes of the places I have known and of the tribe that is mine.\n\nI met her in The New Yorker, and it was love at first read, and I began buying her books. I was so eager to read “Runaway,” I forgot I had ordered it on the Internet and bought it in a bookstore before it came in the mail. I have a copy and a spare.\n\nI am not a lit’ry critic, and it is naked hubris for me to comment on Alice Munro when every critic in the world is explicating the work of the newest Nobel laureate. Just indulge an old man, if you will, and let me ramble among the thoughts that come to me.\n\nAs a young girl, Munro shared the grim chores of her family’s fox farm outside of town and was used to outhouses and muddy roads. Almost all her stories take place in southwest Ontario where she was born. She still lives there.\n\nSignificantly, the Nobel committee ignored Munro’s gender and called her “master of the contemporary short story.” She is a woman who writes chiefly about the lives of women, but she is not a “women’s writer.”\n\nShe is simply a master who stands among other masters of the form — Chekhov, say. Nobody who reads even one of Munro’s stories is likely to dismiss her work as “chick lit.”\n\nMunro writes of women who set out to change their dull lives, and of women who bury their dreams and accept the lives they have. Whether they are going to meet a lover or to take a job in a distant TB sanatorium, the women always ride trains.\n\nThe trains are both lonely and alive with the promise of romance. The romances all fail. The bad guys always get away.\n\nI have a weakness for women writers who see darkness in the souls of all of us. I hear the Southern voices of Eudora Welty, Flannery O’Connor or Carson McCullers in Munro’s stories of Ontario. I think she could have written “A Good Man is Hard to Find.”\n\nIn 1962, novelist Irving Wallace wrote “The Prize,” a book about the intrigue, politics and prejudice behind the awarding of the Nobel prizes. It also is about how the winners in the various fields learn they have won, and how they meld with and clash with other winners.\n\nTo keep the various narratives parallel, Wallace begins with the winners getting a phone call from the Nobel committee to tell them they have been awarded the highest honor in the world.\n\nIn a twist that Irving did not think of, when the Nobel committee called to tell Munro she had won the prize in literature, she was not at home. They left the news on her answering machine.\n\nShe eventually got the word when the daughter she was visiting woke her up to answer the phone.\n\nAlthough Munro knew she was being considered for the prize, she did what a modest woman in one of her stories might have done. Instead of sitting up all night listening for the phone, she went to bed and went to sleep. Good for her.\n\nMunro has declined the Swedish Academy’s invitation to attend the Nobel awards ceremony because of ill health. She is 82."
