He was 89.\n\nSolzhenitsyn revealed to the Western world the inner workings of the gulag, the network of prisons and camps that held as many as 20 million people during Stalin’s reign of terror and killed at least 1.5 million. He became a thorn in the side of Soviet authorities and was an icon for Russian intellectuals, helping trigger the demise of the communist regime with his calls for social conscience and historical justice.\n\n“No writer that I can think of in history really was able to do so much through courage and literary skill to change the society they came from,” wrote David Remnick, the New Yorker magazine editor whose account of the Soviet collapse in “Lenin’s Tomb” won the Pulitzer Prize. “And to some extent, you have to credit the literary works of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn with helping to bring down the last empire on Earth.”\n\nSolzhenitsyn, who wrote more than 20 books, drew on his own experience as a political prisoner in his early works, including “The Gulag Archipelago” and “One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich,” which won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1970. He was stripped of citizenship in his homeland and moved to Switzerland in 1974 before emigrating to the U.S. two years later.\n\nEARLY YEARS\n\nAleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn was born Dec. 11, 1918, in Kislovodsk, a north Caucasian town between the Black and Caspian seas. He was raised by his mother after his father was killed at the end of World War I, six months before Solzhenitsyn was born.\n\nSolzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov University and took a correspondence course at the Institute of History, Philosophy and Literature in Moscow. He served in World War II as commander of an artillery-position-finding unit on the frontline.\n\nWhile in East Prussia, he was arrested in February 1945 for writing disrespectful remarks about Stalin in letters to a school friend. The sentence was eight years in a detention camp, considered relatively lenient at the time.\n\nThe periods he spent in various camps and prisons were documented in works such as “The Tenderfoot and the Tramp,” “The First Circle” and “Ivan Denisovich.” He later said he wouldn’t have survived his sentence if his mathematics skills hadn’t earned him a transfer to a “sharashka,” a secret research laboratory where inmates developed new technologies and were spared hard labor.\n\nINTERNAL EXILE\n\nIn March 1953, Solzhenitsyn was sent into “exile for life” in Kok-Terek, a town in southern Kazakhstan. A year later, he was allowed to travel to Tashkent for successful treatment of stomach cancer. His time in the clinic inspired the book “Cancer Ward,” which was published in 1968. All of his writing in exile was done in secret and was financed by his job teaching mathematics and physics at a primary school.\n\n“During all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced that I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written,” he wrote in an autobiographical profile submitted for his Nobel Prize in 1970.\n\nAfter the 22nd Congress of the Soviet Communist Party in 1961, Solzhenitsyn gambled that the thaw in political thinking would allow his works to be published. He approached Aleksandr Tvardovsky, the editor of Novy Mir magazine, who agreed to release “Ivan Denisovich” the following year. The authorities terminated the printing of the book almost immediately, and Solzhenitsyn’s papers were confiscated.\n\nSOVIET WRITERS\n\nIn 1969, he was expelled from the Soviet Writers Union for denouncing censorship in the country. Solzhenitsyn was awarded the Nobel Prize a year later, though he didn’t attend the ceremony.\n\nSolzhenitsyn spent about two years in Zurich after he was exiled abroad. There he wrote his autobiography, “The Oak and the Calf,” and “Lenin in Zurich,” a book debunking the myths surrounding the father of the Soviet Union, Vladimir Lenin.\n\nIn 1976, Solzhenitsyn moved with his family to Cavendish, Vt., where he lived in isolation and wrote “The Red Wheel,” a historical series on the 1917 Russian Revolution.\n\nSOCIAL ALIENATION\n\nFor almost two decades, he was rarely seen in public, with the notable exception of his commencement speech at Harvard University in June 1978. On that occasion, he lambasted the moral decrepitude of Western society, which stood at “the abyss of human decadence” and “in its present state of spiritual exhaustion does not look attractive.”\n\nIn 1990, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev restored Solzhenitsyn’s citizenship and treason charges were dropped against the writer the following year.\n\nSolzhenitsyn’s passion for Russian culture and disillusionment with Western consumerism prompted a return to the country of his birth in 1994, but it failed to ease Solzhenitsyn’s social alienation. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia had embraced the consumerism he so despised in the West, while its political system fell under the control of oligarchs whose actions bore a troubling resemblance to those of the old Soviet leaders.\n\n“It is as if, just having survived the heaviest case of cholera, to immediately upon recuperation get the plague,” he said of the transition.\n\nSolzhenitsyn’s wife, Natalia, returned with him to Russia, while their three sons — Yermolai, Stephan and Ignat — remained in the U.S., where they held citizenship.\n\nOriginally Published: August 3, 2008 at 11:01 p.m."
