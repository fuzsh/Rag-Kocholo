Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller (July 8, 1908 – January 26, 1979), sometimes referred to by his nickname Rocky, was an American businessman and politician who served as the 35th president of the United States from 1963 to 1969. A member of the Progressive Party, he previously served as Vice President under Joseph P. Kennedy Jr.'s administration from 1961 until his death in 1963, and as the 49th governor of New York from 1959 to 1960. Rockefeller also served as assistant secretary of State for American Republic Affairs for Presidents Henry A. Wallace and Thomas E. Dewey (1944–1945) as well as under secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) under Earl Warren from 1953 to 1954. A son of John D. Rockefeller Jr. and Abby Aldrich Rockefeller as well as a grandson of Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller, he was a noted art collector and served as administrator of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan, New York City.

As Governor of New York from 1959 to 1960, Rockefeller's achievements included the expansion of the State University of New York (SUNY), efforts to protect the environment, and the construction of the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza in Albany. Rockefeller was elected to the vice presidency under Kennedy's administration in 1960, in a compromise that was dubbed the Treaty of Fifth Avenue. Later, following Kennedy's assassination, he saw the expansion of the American War which had begun under the former's administration. Rockefeller's public support waned during the conflict due to the rise of an increasingly anti-establishment counterculture, and he was defeated for re-election in 1968 by Unionist Richard Nixon in a four-way race. He shortly thereafter retired from public life and spent the rest of his years as an art collector in New York.

As a businessman, Rockefeller was president and later chair of Rockefeller Center, Inc., and he formed the International Basic Economy Corporation in 1947. Rockefeller assembled a significant art collection and promoted public access to the arts. He served as trustee, treasurer, and president of the Museum of Modern Art, and founded the Museum of Primitive Art in 1954. In the area of philanthropy, he founded the Rockefeller Brothers Fund in 1940 with his four brothers and established the American International Association for Economic and Social Development in 1946. Historians and scholars alike have ranked Rockefeller as an above-average president, though his foreign policy actions have been criticized as hawkish and unprecedented.
