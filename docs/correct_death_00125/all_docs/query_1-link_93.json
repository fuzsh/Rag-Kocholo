        "text": "Today the Nation mourns one of its most distinguished public men, Nelson Rockefeller. Rosalynn and I extend our deepest sympathy to Mrs. Rockefeller and his family.\n\nNelson Rockefeller was born to privilege and accepted his privilege as an obligation to serve his State and Nation. He sought the highest service, but willingly and ably performed whatever tasks were asked of him by his country. He was a strong and popular Governor. He served unstintingly under many Presidents of both parties whenever there was a special task to be done.\n\nAt a time when our people's trust in their Government had been deeply shaken, he accepted appointment to the Vice Presidency, helping to reassure the Nation with his own integrity and vigorous optimism.\n\nBut Nelson Rockefeller did not limit himself to tasks others assigned him. He had special concern for the less fortunate, for the arts, for the processes of government itself, and most of all, for the vision that guided this Nation. When he saw a need, he marshaled the necessary resources and talent to set about meeting it."
