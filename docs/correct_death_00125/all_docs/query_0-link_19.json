        "text": "Former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller’s home at 812 Fifth Ave. is in contract after just 43 days on the market.\n\nThe four-bedroom, 4½-bath, full-floor co-op was asking $11.5 million. It’s the first time the 15th-floor unit will trade in almost 60 years.\n\nA grandson of billionaire John D. Rockefeller, he bought the unit in 1963 while serving as governor of New York, from 1959 to 1973. He then went on to become vice president under Gerald Ford, from 1974 to 1977.\n\nThe co-op features 75 feet of Central Park views. (At one point, Rockefeller connected it to his 12th-floor unit in an adjacent building, but the units were separated after his death in 1979, according to the listing.)\n\nThe 3,990-square-foot unit opens with a private elevator landing into a gallery.\n\nThere’s also a 295-square-foot terrace. The listing brokers are Clayton Orrigo, Stephen Ferrara and Kristen Jordan, of Compass."
