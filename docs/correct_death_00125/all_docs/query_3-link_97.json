        "text": "Excerpted fromMemoirs,by David Rockefeller, published by Random House Trade Publishing, a division of Random House, Inc.; © 2002 by the author.\n\nThere is a picture of all the men in the family waiting at the station in Tarrytown, New York, for the train carrying Grandfather’s casket from his winter home in Ormond Beach, Florida. He died [#image: /photos/54cbfe28998d4de83ba415d8]quietly in his bed on May 23, 1937, at the age of 97. While the official cause of death was sclerotic myocarditis, it would be simpler to say he died of old age. I had known him as Grandfather, not the “robber baron” or great philanthropist of the history books. He had been a constant presence in my childhood: benign, indulgent, revered by my father, John D. Rockefeller Jr., and by the family as a whole. Looking at that picture today, I find it remarkable how well it cap-tured our relationships with one another, where we were in life, and, perhaps, where we would all be going.\n\nJohn, characteristically, stands on the periphery. Thirty-one years old, he is the oldest son, inheritor of the dynastic name. After he graduated from Princeton, Father put him on the boards of many family institutions, among them the Rockefeller Foundation, the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, and Colonial Williamsburg, grooming him to be the family leader; but he is shy and uncertain of his abilities.\n\nNelson, also characteristically, has managed to situate himself at the exact center of the picture and stares authoritatively at the camera. At 29 he will soon become president of Rockefeller Center.\n\nLaurance, 27, the philosopher and businessman, gazes into the middle distance. He was emerging as a leading investor in the aviation industry and, with Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace, would soon buy a large stake in Eastern Air Lines.\n\nWinthrop is the handsomest. Somehow Mother’s family’s features—which one might describe as having a lot of “character”—combined with the Rockefeller genes to produce almost movie-star good looks. [#image: /photos/54cbfe28998d4de83ba415d6]Win is the most troubled of us and never quite fit in. Now 25, he is working as a roughneck in the Texas oil fields.\n\nI am the youngest, 21, and look very wet behind the ears. I have just completed my first year of graduate work in economics at Harvard and will leave that summer to continue my studies at the London School of Economics.\n\nFather, beginning to show his 63 years, presides over us all, completely forthright, a friendly, kind face. Perhaps a little distant.\n\nWe brought Grandfather back to the mansion that he and Father had built 25 years earlier on the family estate at Pocantico Hills, in Westchester County, just north of where the Tappan Zee Bridge now crosses the Hudson River. Called Kykuit, the Dutch word for “lookout,” the house commands a magnificent view of the river. The next day, with only immediate family and a few close friends present, we held a service for him. I remember it was a beautiful spring day, the French doors open to the terrace, and the Hudson a glistening blue below us. His favorite organist, Dr. Archer Gibson, played the large pipe organ in the main hall, on which we used to pretend to perform when we were children. Harry Emerson Fosdick, senior minister of New York’s Riverside Church, which was built by Father, gave the eulogy.\n\nAfter the service, as everyone milled about, Mr. Yordi, Grandfather’s valet, gestured to me. Yordi, a dapper Swiss fellow, had been Grandfather’s constant companion for 30 years. I knew him well, but he had always been reserved in my presence. I went over to him, and he pulled me aside, into a deserted hallway. “You know, Mr. David,” he began (from as early as I can remember, the staff always addressed us in that way; first names would have been too familiar), “of all you brothers, your grandfather always thought you were the most like him.” I must have looked very surprised. It was the last thing I expected him to say. “Yes,” he said, “you were very much his favorite.” I thanked him somewhat awkwardly, but he waved his hand and said, “No, no, I just thought you should know.” I didn’t know what to make of it. I thought it would have been Nelson, but I couldn’t pretend I wasn’t pleased.\n\nGrandfather started at $5 a week as a clerk in a dry-goods store in Cleveland and went on to found the Standard Oil Company, which for all practical purposes was the oil industry in the United States until the Supreme Court ordered the trust dissolved in 1911 after a long period of acrimonious litigation. Many of the companies that emerged from the breakup still exist: ExxonMobil, Chevron, Amoco, and about 30 others.\n\nStandard Oil made Grandfather possibly “the richest man in America.” He was also, for much of his life, one of the most hated. The tabloid press attacked Standard’s business practices and accused it of crimes—including murder—in its relentless efforts to eliminate all competition and perfect its monopoly of the oil industry. Grandfather was the target of Progressives, Populists, Socialists, and others discontented with the new American capitalist order. Robert La Follette, the powerful governor of Wisconsin, called him the “greatest criminal of his age.” Teddy Roosevelt used him as a whipping boy in his effort to bring the industrial monopolies to heel. Ida Tarbell, who through her writings probably did more than anyone to establish the image of Grandfather as a greedy and rapacious “robber baron,” wrote, “There is little doubt that Mr. Rockefeller’s chief reason for playing golf is that he may live longer to make more money.”\n\nToday most historians would agree that the picture painted of Standard in those contemporary accounts was highly partisan and often inaccurate. Grandfather and his partners were tough competitors, but they were guilty of no more than the common business practices of their day. It was a different world then. Few of the laws that regulate business competition today were in place. Standard was operating on the frontiers of the economy; it was new, unexplored territory, in some cases literally like the Wild West.\n\nSome have said that Grandfather and Father, along with Andrew Carnegie, invented modern philanthropy. Grandfather’s first major philanthropic project was the creation of the University of Chicago in the 1890s. One of the next initiatives he undertook was the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, founded in 1901. Grandfather’s vision, developed in close collaboration with the first director of the institute, Dr. Simon Flexner, was to establish a research facility modeled on the Pasteur and Koch institutes in Europe. In creating the institute Grandfather followed the same principles that he had tested at Standard Oil: he hired good men and gave them scope. While he had been intimately involved in the inception and planning, once the institute was up and running, he made it a point not to interfere with its management. Father became president of the board of trustees to ensure that the policy of independent scientific research was strictly maintained.\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation, founded in 1913, was the first philanthropic organization with a specifically global vision and was the culmination of Grandfather’s efforts to create a structure capable of wisely managing his assets for benevolent purposes. Grandfather provided more endowment for the foundation—approximately $182 million, more than $2 billion in current dollars, over a period of 10 years—than for any other institution. The foundation fought hookworm, yellow fever, malaria, tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases. In later years it became a leader in developing hybrid varieties of corn, wheat, and rice that served as the basis for the green revolution, which has done so much to transform societies around the world.\n\nWhen my parents married on October 9, 1901, the press headlined it as the union of the two most powerful families in America: the son and heir of John D. Rockefeller and the daughter of Nelson Aldrich, Republican majority leader in the U.S. Senate and, according to some, “the General Manager of the Nation.”\n\nDress was decidedly more formal in those days; in the winter Father wore a black tie to dinner every night, and Mother a long dress, even when the family dined alone. The quantity of clothing they carried everywhere was astounding. Father never ventured out even in the summer without a coat in case the weather turned cold, and he always wore a hat outdoors. A photograph of Father and me taken one summer during my college years on a motor trip through the Southwest shows us seated on a wool lap robe under a pine tree in the Arizona desert. Father is wearing a suit and tie and a felt hat, and the ever present coat is lying nearby.\n\nI have no doubt Father loved all of us very much, but his own rigid upbringing undoubtedly contributed to his inflexibility as a parent. He was formal, not cold, but rarely demonstrably affectionate. Nevertheless, he was physically more present during my childhood than many fathers. He worked hard, but mostly in his office at home, where he did not wish to be disturbed. He was with us in Pocantico on weekends and spent summer vacations with us in Maine, but on the emotional level he was distant. His sense of parental responsibility prodded him into frequent soliloquies on duty, morality, and proper behavior. My brother Laurance to this day remembers with some distress the letter he received from Father after he was voted “most likely to succeed” by his class at Princeton. Father reminded him that he would have to spend the rest of his life truly earning the good opinion his classmates had of him.\n\nFather was a complicated person. Grandfather was a self-made man who created a great fortune after starting with nothing, an accomplishment Father would have no opportunity to emulate. Even after he had built a solid record of achievement, he was plagued with feelings of inadequacy. He once described his brief involvement in the business world—as one of many vice presidents at Standard Oil—as “a race with my own conscience,” and in a sense Father was racing all his life to be worthy of his name and inheritance.\n\nIn his early 30s, Father suffered a “nervous collapse”—we would now call it depression. In order to recover his health, he took Mother and my sister, Abby, then only a year old, on a month’s vacation to the South of France. Their stay there lengthened into six months, and even when they came back, Father retreated to his home and rarely went out. It was almost a year before he felt able to return to the office, and then only part-time.\n\nOnce Father overcame his depression, he resigned from Standard and devoted himself exclusively to philanthropy and the management of Grandfather’s personal affairs. As a result, during the decade of the teens, Grandfather began to transfer some stocks and other properties to him, but still in relatively small quantities. In 1915, the year I was born, when Father was 41, he owned outright only about $250,000 worth of Standard Oil stock.\n\nBeginning in 1917, Grandfather began to transfer his remaining assets to Father—about one-half billion dollars at the time, which was equivalent to about $10 billion today. Father promptly set about restructuring his life to deal with the responsibilities that great wealth had brought him. Essentially, his goals would be the same as those expressed by the motto of the Rockefeller Foundation: improving the “well-being of mankind throughout the world.” This meant continuing his active involvement with the institutions started by Grandfather, but it also gave him the opportunity to initiate projects of his own, projects that would range over practically every field of human activity.\n\nI was born in my parents’ home at 10 West 54th Street in New York on June 12, 1915. Their home wasn’t a château with turrets, crenellated walls, and expansive ballrooms of the sort built by the Vanderbilts and others along Fifth Avenue, but it wasn’t exactly simple, either. At the time, it was the largest private residence in New York City and had nine floors and an enclosed play area on the roof. Below it there was a squash court, a gymnasium, and a private infirmary, where I was born and where family members would go if they were sick with a contagious disease such as measles or mumps. On the second floor was a music room with a pipe organ and a large piano; it was here that my parents hosted recitals by such noted artists as the pianist Jan Paderewski.\n\nThe house was filled with art, the style and period of which reflected my parents’ very different tastes and personalities. Mother’s taste was eclectic and ranged from the art of the ancient world to contemporary work from Europe and the United States. Her interest in contemporary American artists emerged during the 1920s. Under the guidance of Edith Halpert, owner of the Downtown Gallery, Mother acquired works by Charles Sheeler, Edward Hopper, Charles Demuth, Charles Burchfield, and Arthur Davies. She also came to know Lillie Bliss and Mary Quinn Sullivan, who shared her excitement about modern art. Concerned that talented artists had little prospect of being shown by a museum until they were dead—if then—the three women decided to establish a museum for contemporary artists. Through their initiative, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) came into being in late 1929.\n\nFather disliked modern art. He considered it “unlifelike,” ugly, and disturbing, and he discouraged Mother from hanging contemporary art in those areas of the house that he frequented.\n\nShortly after building their house, my parents ran out of space for some of the large and important pieces they had acquired, so they bought the house next door. Connecting doors were cut through the walls on three floors so that Father could display some of his favorite works, including 10 18th-century Gobelin tapestries, The Months of Lucas, woven originally for Louis XIV, and the famous set of 15th-century French Gothic tapestries known as Hunt of the Unicorn. In the late 1930s, Father gave both sets of tapestries to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the unicorn tapestries continue to be the central feature in the Metropolitan’s Cloisters museum in Fort Tryon Park, near the northern tip of Manhattan.\n\nDuring the week our daily routine never varied. We were roused early for a quick breakfast, preceded by morning prayers in Father’s study. Father required us to learn selected verses from the Bible, which he called upon us to recite. Each of us then took turns reading a Psalm or another passage from the Bible. We ended with a prayer. Father would explain to us the meaning of what we were reading. Making jokes or cutting up was sternly discouraged. Prayers lasted 10 or 15 minutes; neither Mother nor my sister, Abby, whom we called Babs, attended.\n\nExcept for John, we all attended the Lincoln School, at 123rd Street and Morningside Drive, near Harlem. Father considered it important for boys to get exercise, so every morning we strapped on our roller skates in the front hallway and headed uptown on Fifth Avenue along the border of Central Park. When we were younger, Winthrop and I got only to 72nd Street, whereas Nelson and Laurance often went as far as 96th Street. Following along behind us in a Nash sedan to pick us up when our energies flagged was one of the three Irish Concannon brothers, who had originally worked as coachmen and who all learned to drive a car. They were happiest driving one of our electric cars, which were popular before the advent of Henry Ford’s Model T, because the driver perched on top like a coachman.\n\nIn the winter the family spent weekends at the estate in Pocantico Hills. We drove up in a Crane-Simplex sedan with a roof high enough for a person of average height to stand upright inside. It had folding side seats and could comfortably accommodate seven people, including the chauffeur. For children it seemed like an endless journey—there were no modern highways, and the trip from Manhattan took about one and a half hours—and I remember distinctly the smell of the plush fabric on the seats, which always made me feel a little carsick.\n\nGrandfather had started buying property in Pocantico in the early 1890s. Southwestern Westchester County was still very rural then, with woodlands, lakes, fields, and streams, all teeming with wildlife. Eventually the family accumulated about 3,400 acres, which surrounded and included almost all of the little village of Pocantico Hills, where most of the residents worked for the family and lived in houses owned by Grandfather.\n\nThe wooden house my grandparents occupied burned down in 1901. Rather than rebuild, they simply moved down the hill to a smaller place, known as the Kent House, where they were perfectly content. After a great deal of prodding by Father they finally built a larger and more substantial house near where the original structure had stood. Grandfather occupied Kykuit from 1912 until his death in 1937, and then Mother and Father moved into it.\n\nMy parents’ first home in “the Park,” Abeyton Lodge, was a large, rambling wooden structure down the hill from Kykuit. Abeyton’s interior was filled with oak paneling and floors, which gave it a warm and comfortable feeling. A wide golden-oak staircase ascended from the entrance hall to the second floor, and a huge oak table almost filled the front hall. It was on that table that I recall seeing the front page of the New York Herald Tribune the day the stock market crashed in 1929. There were fireplaces in many rooms, including several of the bedrooms. The one in the living room was always lit in cool weather and contributed to the room’s inviting atmosphere. Bookcases with glass doors lined an entire wall and held sets of books by well-known authors, Charles Dickens and Robert Louis Stevenson among them, as well as bound copies of Country Life and St. Nicholas magazines, both relics of Victorian America. The only painting in the house of any distinction was a large George Inness landscape.\n\nThere was a long hallway between the living room and dining room where the heads of big-game animals lined the walls. I have no idea where they came from, because Father certainly never went on an African safari, but this wasn’t too long after Teddy Roosevelt’s time, and mounted animal trophies were much in vogue. There was also a stuffed emperor penguin standing in the front hallway. Admiral Richard Byrd had presented it to Father in gratitude for the financial support Father provided for his expeditions to the polar regions. Admiral Byrd visited us frequently in those days, and on his first expedition to Antarctica he telegraphed me from Little America saying he was naming a relay camp after me. That was an exciting thing for a 13-year-old boy. Byrd discovered mountain ranges near the Ross Sea, and he named one of them the Rockefeller Mountains, a name it bears to this day. Another famous visitor was Charles Lindbergh, who spent a weekend with us soon after his solo flight across the Atlantic in 1927.\n\nI had developed an avid interest in nature study, particularly collecting beetles, as a result of a class in natural history I attended, along with Henry Ford II, one summer in Maine. On warm spring nights I would hang up a linen sheet against the stucco wall on the porch off my bedroom and put a light in front of it. Beetles and other insects would swarm toward the light in large numbers, and in a short period of time the sheet would be covered with crawling life. On a single evening I could easily collect 30 or more species of beetles. It is a sad fact that the same result could not be produced today, clearly due to the extensive use of insecticides. When I was a child, the strident sounds of the katydids, cicadas, and other members of the insect orchestra would keep me awake at night. Now, late in the summer, we sometimes hear a few katydids sawing away, but very few.\n\nThe estate was a child’s paradise. When I was in my early teens, Father built a huge playhouse just up the hill from Abeyton Lodge with a gymnasium, an indoor pool, a bowling alley, a squash court, and a kitchen. A decade later Father added an indoor tennis court. There were an infinite number of places to play, but I remember usually having to play alone or with a tutor who came out for the weekend.\n\nSummers were always spent in Maine at the Eyrie in Seal Harbor, on the southeastern shore of Mount Desert Island, not far from Bar Harbor. We would celebrate Grandfather’s birthday on July 8 in Pocantico and head north the next day. The movement of the household was a complicated logistical task and required weeks of preparation. Large trunks and suitcases were dragged out of storage and packed with everything we might need during the nearly three-month stay. On the day of our departure, workers loaded them on trucks along with ice chests containing pasteurized milk for us children on the train. Everything was delivered to Pennsylvania Station and loaded on the train. Abeyton Lodge was filled with a wonderful bustle and sense of anticipation as we hurried about collecting all of those things that we had to have with us: books, games, and athletic equipment.\n\nBy 1900, Bar Harbor had become one of New England’s most fashionable summer resorts, on a par with Newport, Rhode Island. The rugged coastline along Frenchman’s Bay flanking Bar Harbor was covered with immense gabled mansions of the rich, and the harbor was filled with yachts. Seal Harbor, although only nine miles away, remained much quieter and more conservative. My parents thought Bar Harbor flashy and ostentatious, and spent little time there. Families such as the Atwater Kents, of radio fame, the Dorrances, of Campbell Soup, and the Potter Palmers, from Chicago, gave elaborate parties, with bands playing on yachts anchored just off their property, and dancing all through the night. Speedboats carried guests back and forth, and champagne flowed.\n\nMy parents disapproved of such opulent displays, especially because of the liquor, which was in abundant supply even during Prohibition. Many rumors circulated about the high society of Bar Harbor; it was even whispered that Mr. Kent kept a mistress! Of course, I was too young for most of this and heard about it primarily from my brothers.\n\nFather spent much of his time during the summers riding horses and driving carriages along the 55 miles of carriage roads he had built on land he owned as well as within Acadia National Park. They were marvels of engineering and meticulous planning, and provided spectacular views of the ocean, mountains, lakes, and forests.\n\nFather didn’t like sailing and rarely ventured out on the water. This was a great disappointment to Mother, who had been raised on Narragansett Bay among a family of sailors. Eventually Father bought a beautiful 36-foot racing sloop, an “R” boat named Jack Tar, undoubtedly as a concession to my older brothers. Being the youngest, I didn’t get much sailing time on it, although when I was 17 a friend and I sailed 100 miles east to Saint Andrews in New Brunswick, across the treacherous waters of Passamaquoddy Bay. Jack Tar had no engine, so Captain Oscar Bulger, who worked for the family for many years, followed along in his lobster boat in case we got into trouble.\n\nMy siblings viewed me as being far too young to be worth playing with. The eldest, my sister, Abby, was 12 years older than I. When I was a young child, she was already a debutante, out every night until early morning; once or twice I remember her getting home as I was strapping on my roller skates and heading off for school. John, two and a half years younger than Babs, was next in line and already in long pants—we all wore knickerbockers and long socks until well into our teens—so I also considered him almost part of the adult world. Nelson and Laurance were also quite a bit older, seven and five years, respectively, and Win, the closest to me in age, was my senior by three years.\n\nFrom my earliest memory Babs had already entered her rebellious phase, which in one way or another lasted most of her life. Father clearly wanted his first child to be a devout Christian woman and to do things he felt a well-brought-up lady should do. He adored Babs, but in his eagerness to have her become a paragon of modesty and charity, he badgered her constantly with lectures on good behavior and the obligations of wealth. Babs would have none of it. If Father wanted her to do something, she would refuse or do the opposite. For instance, Father strongly disapproved of alcohol and tobacco, and offered each of us $2,500 if we didn’t smoke before the age of 21, and another $2,500 if we made it all the way to 25. I don’t think Babs even tried. She smoked as obviously as possible in front of our parents.\n\nBabs was adamant in her refusal to give money to charity. Grandfather and Father expected all of us to follow their example and encouraged us to contribute 10 percent of our allowances to church and other charitable causes. In the beginning these were very small amounts, only a few dollars a month, but Father saw this practice as an essential part of our moral and civic education. Babs refused to give a cent, as a way of showing her independence. She suffered for it financially because Father was less generous to her than he was to his five sons.\n\nThe rebellion was not a happy one on either side. Father was distressed by her behavior and hurt by her animosity toward him. For Babs, life became more and more difficult. One episode when she was in her early 20s had a lasting impact on her life. She was ticketed for speeding in her Stutz convertible and was terrified at what Father might say when he found out about it. Her fiancé, Dave Milton, was an attorney and tried to get the ticket “fixed” through a judge he knew. The press picked this up, and the story appeared on the front page of the tabloids. My parents were upset, my sister even more so. In the end, seeing her real distress, Father was understanding of her plight. But from that day forward, she was terrified of public notoriety. She retreated into herself and ceased being the gay, fun-loving partygoer she had been.\n\nWhen I was 10 and Babs 22, she married Dave Milton. His family had been friends of our family’s both in Seal Harbor and in Pocantico. At first she saw marriage as a way to escape from Father, and while she attended major family events and kept in touch with Mother, she lived a very separate life.\n\nJohn, of course, had the name. He was John D. Rockefeller III, the eldest son and the heir apparent. Of all the children, John was the most like Father in personality—hardworking and conscientious, with a strong sense of duty. But Father’s standards were so high and exacting that John could never hope to win complete approval from him. Every achievement was taken for granted—that’s how a Rockefeller should behave, after all, and, furthermore, one should be careful not to get a swelled head about it and think you’re superior. Since perfection was the norm, all John could do was fail. Though probably not articulated in words, Father’s response always made him feel he should be able to do better.\n\nIt’s not surprising that John had a “nervous disposition.” He was extremely shy and awkward in social situations, so self-conscious that he would agonize for days over things he had said or thoughts he was thinking. He was, like Father, something of a hypochondriac, always concerned about his health and plagued throughout his childhood by a series of allergies and illnesses, though none of them was serious. Perhaps because he was so much like Father, John was destined to have, apart from Babs, the greatest conflict with him, but that would not come out into the open for a number of years.\n\nThe contrast between John and Nelson was dramatic. Where John was painfully shy and self-conscious, Nelson was sociable and outgoing and loved to be the center of attention. The duties and obligations that weighed John down seemed to roll off Nelson easily. It was as if Nelson had looked at Babs and John and decided he wasn’t going to make either of their mistakes in his relations with Father. If he broke the rules, as Babs did, it wouldn’t be done ostentatiously to anger Father but to have fun, get away with it, or secure some important result. If, like John, he set out to please Father, it was to achieve a clear and calculated objective—to get what he wanted—and he often succeeded.\n\nNelson was named for Mother’s father, Senator Nelson Aldrich. But even though Nelson admired both grandfathers, he thought it significant that he had been born on Grandfather Rockefeller’s birthday. He let one infer from this coincidence that he was the true Rockefeller standard-bearer. Yet his own career more closely paralleled that of Grandfather Aldrich, the career politician. In any case, Nelson was politically astute, even wily, within the family. He was a natural leader and radiated self-confidence. He was also the mischievous one in the family; he surreptitiously shot rubber bands at the rest of us during our morning prayers and was not the slightest bit concerned when Father reprimanded him.\n\nI idolized Nelson. In a household full of duties and constraints, Nelson knew how to have fun and acted as if the constraints were only minor obstacles, which could be easily avoided. Most of the time he miraculously escaped serious discipline, and even the punishments that were meted out to him never really seemed to stick, because Mother enjoyed his liveliness and independence and perhaps secretly encouraged his jaunty misbehavior. On the rare occasions when he took notice of my existence and asked me to join one of his adventures, my life was immediately transformed into something larger, better, and more exciting.\n\nLaurance—the unusual spelling is because he was named after our grandmother Laura—was the philosopher and the creative one. Quiet like John and a bit detached, he was less shy and more venturesome. When he was at Princeton and roomed with a rather fast crowd, he told me that he believed in trying anything once. He was quick and witty, but not an especially good student. His natural charm and whimsical manner made him very attractive to girls, to whom he warmly responded. As a young man, however, he searched endlessly for the right road to follow in life. Later on he became a highly successful venture capitalist as well as a conservationist.\n\nWinthrop faced an unusually difficult situation within the family. Nelson and Laurance were a club to which he wasn’t invited. I, three years his junior, was a club he didn’t want to join. He was teased unmercifully by them and gave me full measure of the grief they inflicted on him. Win did not have a particularly happy childhood. He was, like me, somewhat overweight and awkward, and received a great deal of ridicule from Nelson and Laurance, who nicknamed him Pudgy. Once, Nelson coaxed Win onto a seesaw and, when he was high in the air, jumped off, sending poor Win crashing to the ground. Win picked up a pitchfork and chased Nelson, fully intending, I’m sure, to skewer him, but Father intervened.\n\nLater in life, after Win had been governor of Arkansas for two terms and was suffering from chronic alcoholism, Nelson made some gestures of support, but Win saw them as halfhearted and very belated. He was deeply embittered about the condescending treatment he felt he had always received from Nelson.\n\nAs the youngest, I received the special attention of my mother, but there were fewer compensations for Win. Win had exceptional natural qualities of leadership, which he demonstrated during his distinguished military service in World War II and later during his political career in Arkansas. But he was never comfortable with his social and intellectual peers. He spent much of his time with fair-weather friends, who looked up to him only because of his money and position. He hated school and was actually somewhat relieved when he was expelled from Yale during his junior year. Win was restless, iconoclastic, and full of energy. I think he desperately craved Father’s approval, but his academic failures and undisciplined comportment meant that Father rarely granted him the acceptance he sought.\n\nAs children we recognized that we belonged to an unusual, even exceptional family, but the effect was different on each of us. For some it was a burden, for others an opportunity. Mother was a remarkable woman whose elegant style and gracious behavior affected everyone, especially her children, in a positive way. Father was a more austere and certainly a more awesome figure. However, much of what I learned about myself and my family’s traditions came as a result of his efforts to expose me to the special travails associated with the Rockefeller name and the realities of the world I would inevitably inherit. His accomplishments were an inspiration to me.\n\nIn the spring of 1926, Mother and Father took Nelson, Laurance, Winthrop, and me on a trip to Philadelphia and then on to Virginia to visit Revolutionary War and Civil War sites. Father also had agreed to speak at Hampton Institute, the famous black college in Hampton, Virginia, that had received a great deal of financial support from the family. We spent a day on the campus speaking to students and attending a church service.\n\nThe next morning we climbed into the car for the trip to Richmond, where Father was to meet with Governor Harry F. Byrd to discuss conservation work in the Shenandoah Valley. Father had earlier decided that he wanted to stop in Williamsburg, home of the College of William and Mary, to see the work that was being done to renovate the national memorial hall of Phi Beta Kappa, the first chapter of which was located on the campus. Father had been elected to this national honorary fraternity when he was an undergraduate at Brown and had agreed to lead the fund-raising campaign for the building. Our guide for this brief portion of the trip was to be the Reverend Dr. W. A. R. Goodwin, rector of Bruton Parish Church and a part-time development officer for the college.\n\nDr. Goodwin showed us the memorial hall and then led us around the sleepy village that had been the capital of Virginia before the American Revolution. After the capital moved to Richmond, the town entered a long period of slow decline. Many of its splendid public buildings, including the Governor’s Palace and the House of Burgesses, had fallen into ruins. Dr. Goodwin was an eloquent tour director and a very good salesman. When we visited a handsome but dilapidated brick building known as the George Wythe House, he extolled its fine architecture but pointed out with sadness its state of disrepair. Father picked up on the observation and later agreed to provide the funds needed to restore the house.\n\nThat was the modest beginning of Father’s most significant project in historic restoration, a project that gave him as much pleasure as anything he did in the field of philanthropy during his lifetime. Over a period of more than 30 years he spent some $60 million in acquiring and restoring the central portion of the town to its authentic Colonial condition. Today, Williamsburg is a pilgrimage site for millions of Americans and a place to which presidents of the United States have proudly taken visiting heads of state to catch a glimpse of an earlier America and its customs and traditions.\n\nAlthough my parents felt their children should first get to know their own country, they believed it was just as important for us to learn about European culture. So in 1927 they took Winthrop and me to France. Four years earlier Father had offered to place a million dollars at the disposal of the French government to repair sections of Reims Cathedral, which had been damaged by German artillery, and to restore portions of Fontainebleau palace and the Palace of Versailles, where the leaking lead roof threatened the integrity of the limestone walls and made the famous Hall of Mirrors, where the treaty ending World War I had been signed, too dangerous to be used.\n\nFrance was still reeling from the Great War, and neither the French government nor wealthy citizens of France were in a position to restore these monuments of incomparable architectural beauty and historic significance. Once the French government had accepted Father’s offer, he retained his old friend Welles Bosworth, the Beaux Arts architect, to supervise the restorations. Over the course of the next decade Father provided more than $2 million for these projects.\n\nWe had a chance to inspect the work that had been completed to that point during our 1927 trip. We stayed a week at Versailles in the lovely Trianon Palace hotel so that Father could spend time with Bosworth and the French architects going over the details of the work under way. The conservator of Versailles gave Winthrop and me a special pass to ride our bicycles in the park and to climb over the vast lead roofs of the palace.\n\nWe were particularly intrigued by the restoration of Marie Antoinette’s Hameau, an exact replica of an 18th-century farm village. Marie Antoinette was a devotee of the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, the great Romantic philosopher, and seems to have heeded his advice about returning to nature, at least on occasion. She constructed a bucolic fantasy where she could escape from the stress of court life and palace intrigue with a few of her friends. There she dressed as a shepherdess and tended a flock of sheep. Not wanting to be too removed from the conveniences of court life, however, the queen also built a small opera house seating fewer than 100 people, where she would go to be entertained by great musicians and singers. The story is also told that the queen objected to the smell of the sheep and would send word of her arrival so that they could be perfumed.\n\nNext we traveled in two Hispano-Suiza limousines with uniformed chauffeurs through the château country of the Loire Valley and then on to Mont-Saint-Michel and the wonderful coasts of Brittany and Normandy, which Mother loved because of their associations with the great masters of the Impressionist school.\n\nIn 1936, I returned to France with my parents to participate in the ceremony re-dedicating Reims Cathedral. Jean Zay, the former minister of culture in Léon Blum’s Popular Front government, gave a banquet in Father’s honor at the Palace of Versailles to express the French government’s appreciation for Father’s assistance, and they named a street for him there as well. A few days later President Albert Lebrun decorated Father with the Grand Croix of the Légion d’Honneur, France’s highest decoration, in front of the Élysée Palace.\n\nSixty-four years later the French government generously awarded me the same decoration at the Palace of the Legion of Honor in Paris. It was a particularly meaningful occasion because the only other living American to share that honor is Ronald Reagan.\n\nDuring my childhood and teenage years Father was involved in a number of major projects in and around New York City. He seemed to have a hand in everything, from the creation of public parks and the preservation of the natural landscape and the building of museums and churches to the provision of adequate and affordable housing for the city’s burgeoning population. Many of Father’s initiatives—the Palisades Interstate Park, the Cloisters and Fort Tryon Park, and Riverside Church—have become part of the city’s physical landscape. Ironically, however, Father will be remembered most for a project that he never intended to undertake and that inadvertently led him to become a major real-estate developer.\n\nRockefeller Center was his most visible endeavor and has had a lasting impact on urban design in New York and around the world. The project began quite modestly, but it turned out to be an enormous venture, which exposed him to serious financial risks without bringing him any financial return. Yet, paradoxically, Rockefeller Center is, with the possible exception of Standard Oil, the business venture with which my family is most closely linked.\n\nIn 1930, Mother commissioned Stefan Hirsch, a promising young artist, to paint the view from my fifth-floor bedroom window at 10 West 54th Street. Hirsch’s cityscape, Midtown Range, is dominated by the Chrysler and Empire State Buildings rising majestically in the distance and punctuated by the graceful spires of Saint Patrick’s Cathedral in the middle ground. The foreground, the neighborhood just to our south, much of it owned by Columbia University, is flat and undistinguished.\n\nThe reality was even grittier. As commercial activity surged northward through Manhattan during the first decades of the 20th century, older residential areas were overwhelmed and transformed. Columbia’s property, bounded by Fifth and Sixth Avenues between 48th and 51st Streets, was composed mostly of four-story residential brownstones, many of which were being converted to small retail businesses or subdivided into apartments. With the advent of Prohibition, nightclubs and speakeasies selling bootleg liquor also appeared, and there were rumors that a number of brothels had opened as well. The neighborhood, once the exclusive preserve of the Vanderbilts and Astors, had become seedy and down-at-the-heels. Father owned substantial land just to the north and was concerned about the deterioration of property values.\n\nBy the mid-1920s the neighborhood had become a prime candidate for redevelopment. Columbia University received little income from the properties, and with most of the leases expiring between 1928 and 1931, the trustees decided to look for a builder who could develop the entire parcel. An attractive potential tenant was the Metropolitan Opera Company.\n\nAt that time the Metropolitan Opera House was located in the heart of the Garment District, at 39th Street and Broadway. Built in the early 1880s, the house, with its crowded backstage areas and poor sight lines, had become inadequate for the needs of the company. For some time the directors had been searching for a site on which to build a new opera house. Thus, in early 1926, when Otto Kahn, the Met’s chairman, learned that Columbia wanted to improve its midtown property, he decided to explore its potential for the company.\n\nFather came into the picture in early 1928. He was impressed by the university’s aspirations and the Met’s plans to build a new house as the centerpiece of a carefully planned commercial-and-residential development on the Columbia property. This would be just the thing, he felt, to upgrade the area and safeguard his own properties.\n\nAfter months of consultation with real-estate experts, architects, and businessmen, followed by detailed negotiations with the university and the Met, on October 1, 1928, Father signed a “definitive agreement and lease” with Columbia, agreeing to rent the 12 acres of Columbia’s land for an initial period of 24 years at an average rent of $3.6 million a year [equal to $38 million today]. The agreement gave Father the option to purchase the central block for $2.5 million, but only if there was a firm commitment to the construction of an opera house. If the Met’s plans failed to materialize, the land would revert to Columbia, which would then be free to incorporate this block in the broader lease. Although Father assigned the lease to a holding company, he remained “liable as a principal and not as a surety on all of the covenants and promises contained in the Agreement.” This was a fateful clause in that it made Father personally responsible for all financial obligations related to the development, whether or not it reached fruition.\n\nAll participants agreed that the project would be called Metropolitan Square because of the opera’s role as the anchor tenant. The first site plan placed the opera house on the western portion of the central block, between 49th and 50th Streets—where 30 Rockefeller Plaza now stands. Father proposed, and the leaders of the Met and Columbia agreed, that the eastern portion of this block, fronting on Fifth Avenue, would be developed as a small park with an open plaza to give the opera house the proper setting, and that the park would then be donated to the city. This first plan envisioned apartment buildings, department stores, and hotels on the two blocks adjacent to the opera house, which would be subleased to developers.\n\nWhen Father signed the lease, everyone believed the plan would go forward as originally envisioned: the Met would sell its old house, and Father, having bought the land from Columbia, would transfer the title to the opera company, which would reimburse him for the cost of the land and his expenses. The Met would then finance the construction of its new facility, and Father would be off the hook financially for the central block of the site.\n\nIn short, Father saw his role in the project as that of a facilitator. He considered it neither a real-estate investment nor a charitable gift. He had no thought of making money from the deal, but he didn’t expect to lose any, either. He expected to come out even. Things did not work out that way.\n\nA year after Father signed the lease with Columbia, the stock-market crash changed the situation totally. The first domino to fall was the Metropolitan Opera. The Met board found it impossible to sell its old house and went to Father with a take-it-or-leave-it proposition: unless he donated the land to them outright and helped finance the construction of the new opera house as well, they would withdraw from the project. Father was outraged and promptly rejected their proposal.\n\nLosing the opera was bad enough, but with the deepening economic depression, the individuals and businesses that had earlier expressed interest in building on the other blocks also began to back out, even Standard Oil of New Jersey. Columbia refused to renegotiate the lease or even to modify it significantly. Father was stuck with leasing the property on the original terms—with no tenant. For the university, the deal was a bonanza which would turn out to be its principal source of income for the next 50 years. Columbia had Father over a barrel and was very content to keep him there.\n\nIf Father did nothing to improve the property, he stood to lose about $5 million a year (counting rent, real-estate taxes, and other expenses), which over the 24 years of the lease would amount to approximately $120 million. Developing the land without the firm promise of tenants, however, posed even greater risks. The construction cost for a project of this kind was enormous, and given the state of the economy, there was no assurance that tenants could be found once the buildings were completed.\n\nLater, Father would be praised for his courage in going forward with the project. He once said to a friend, “Often a man gets in a position where he wants to run, but there is no place to run to. So he goes ahead with the only course open to him, and people call that courage.”\n\nFather consulted with the several distinguished architects and builders who had worked with him in developing the original project, and an alternative proposal was quickly devised. The new plan—the second iteration of what would now be called Rockefeller Center—envisioned an entirely commercial development. [The team of architects, from three firms, included Wallace K. Harrison, Raymond Hood, Henry Hofmeister, and H. W. Corbett.]\n\nTo finance the project Father negotiated a $65 million line of credit from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, the largest such arrangement any insurance company had made up to that time. Father was furious at the 4.5 percent interest rate and told everyone that Fred Ecker, the chairman of Met Life, had forced him to pay an exorbitant premium. But it was the best deal he could get. Met Life also insisted that Father give his personal guarantee on the loan, making him the ultimate guarantor of both the lease and the loan.\n\nThe Met Life loan took care of cash-flow problems, but it did not relieve Father of his financial obligations to the project. For more than five years in the 1930s, during the main period of construction, Father spent between $10 million and $13 million a year on the Center, which he financed from his personal income and through the sale of oil stock, sometimes at very depressed prices. Father’s expenditures on construction, taxes, lease payments, and other aspects of the project from 1929 to 1939 totaled $125 million, or the equivalent today of more than $1.5 billion. It may surprise people to learn that, although he lived until 1960, Father received no income from this massive investment and recouped less than half of the capital he had invested.\n\nBut the cost to Father of building Rockefeller Center cannot be measured only in dollars. As with everything he did, he applied himself single-mindedly to the task, agonizing over minor details. Constant worry took its toll. He was plagued by migraines and would often come home from the office in such a state of nervous exhaustion that he would have to lie down on his couch for an hour or more before dinner. He suffered recurrent bouts of bronchitis and other ailments, which the stress he endured probably exacerbated. I recall that he was physically tired during much of this time, and he and Mother spent several weeks each winter in either Taormina, Sicily, or Tucson, Arizona, trying to get some rest and relaxation.\n\nNevertheless, he persevered, and in the process provided thousands of jobs for New Yorkers during the worst part of the Depression. Union leaders were vocal in their appreciation of Father.\n\nFor the project to be viable economically, Father needed tenants. The turning point, undoubtedly the salvation of the project, came in the summer of 1930 when David Sarnoff, chairman of the Radio Corporation of America (RCA), and Owen D. Young, chairman of General Electric, which held a controlling interest in RCA and also owned Radio-Keith-Orpheum (RKO), a major producer of motion pictures with a chain of movie theaters across the country, agreed to lease one million square feet of office and studio space in the project’s major building at $2.75 a square foot and to pay an annual rent of $1.5 million for four theaters that would be built on the property.\n\nLinking a real-estate project with radio and motion pictures, two of that era’s most dramatic new technologies and growth industries, created an excitement and a cachet that would not have been possible with the Metropolitan Opera. When the deal was announced, David Sarnoff spoke enthusiastically of a “Radio City” rising on the site, a name that caught on almost immediately.\n\nSecuring NBC [then a subsidiary of RCA] as the principal tenant of the main building was critical, but the other sites remained open. Congress agreed to special legislation that provided duty-free status for goods imported by firms taking space in the Center, and a number of foreign firms took long-term leases in some of the smaller buildings. This allowed construction to proceed on the British Empire Building and La Maison Française, the two low-rise buildings on Fifth Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets. The press immediately christened the garden between them the Channel Gardens, as in English Channel.\n\nThe Center had an enormous amount of space to fill, and this produced an intense competition for tenants. The Chrysler Building and the Empire State Building, both completed in the early 1930s, were especially strong competitors because of their proximity, superb architecture, and modern conveniences. The Empire State Building even had mooring posts for dirigibles!\n\nAs Rockefeller Center neared completion, Father persuaded Standard Oil of New Jersey, in which he was still the largest individual shareholder, to lease all of the last building erected on the original site. Other companies and institutions with which Father had a close identification also took leases. For example, the Chase National Bank agreed to open a branch, on the condition that it would have exclusive banking rights throughout the Center for a number of years. The Rockefeller Foundation, the Spelman Fund, and Industrial Relations Counselors—Father was chairman of each—also rented small amounts of space in the Center.\n\nRockefeller Center soon became a universally acclaimed real-estate property. The clean, bold thrust of its modernist lines and the Art Deco motif, plus its underground shopping malls, open plazas, and rooftop gardens, gave it a simple beauty and elegance that silenced even its harshest critics. In many ways it is better known and more respected as a model of urban design today than it was in the decade after it was built.\n\nWhile Rockefeller Center was a success aesthetically and architecturally, its financial viability remained uncertain for many years. The biggest problem, at least once the Depression eased, was the Columbia lease. Stated simply, while Father, and later my brothers and I, owned the buildings, the university owned the land. The lease provided Columbia with an unusual amount of control over a broad range of routine commercial activities—for example, the types of businesses that could locate in the Center and the amount of rent that could be charged. Most important, the lease prohibited Father’s selling any or all of the buildings, offering outside investors a participation in the ownership, or assigning the lease itself to any other individual or corporation without Columbia’s prior agreement. Father tried to get the lease restrictions modified, but the university routinely refused his requests. Essentially, the lease held Father hostage and later the next generation of the family as well.\n\nThe greatest financial burden to the family was the obligation to pay the rent regardless of tenant income. The greatest financial threat to the family was Father’s personal guarantee of the lease, an obligation that passed on to my brothers and me when we bought the equity shares of the Center after World War II. In addition, there were several onerous covenants. One required Father to maintain an escrow fund equal to three years of lease payments that had to be invested in U.S. Treasury bonds, which carried a very low interest rate. Another restricted the payment of dividends until all the original debt on the Center had been paid off, which did not occur until 1970.\n\nWhat all this meant was that during Rockefeller Center’s first five decades the family received virtually no return on its investment, despite the fact that Father had poured his heart and soul—and a good portion of his fortune—into the project.\n\nAn interesting subplot to Rockefeller Center’s early history concerns the mural commissioned for the entrance lobby of the RCA Building. As part of the plan to make the Center aesthetically pleasing, a number of artists received commissions to decorate the buildings and the open spaces. Paul Manship’s golden Prometheus, which still floats silently over the sunken plaza, was one of these works and has become a hallmark of the Center. Father was less fortunate with another selection.\n\nIn the late 1920s my mother had come to admire the work of Diego Rivera, the Mexican painter and muralist who had studied in Paris before and during World War I and become part of Matisse’s artistic circle. Like many artists of his generation, Rivera was left-wing in his political orientation, and he was a member of the Mexican Communist Party for a time.\n\nAlfred Barr, the young director of MoMA, brought Rivera to Mother’s attention, and when Barr proposed that MoMA give Rivera a one-man show in 1931, both Mother and Nelson were enthusiastic. Mother commissioned a painting from him and also bought a number of the watercolors he had done in Moscow in 1927. With this money Rivera was able to visit New York for the first time.\n\nRivera was a frequent visitor in my parents’ home, where I met him several times. He was a very imposing and charismatic figure, quite tall and weighing 300 pounds. He spoke very little English but perfect French in addition to Spanish. On one or two occasions he brought his wife, the painter Frida Kahlo, with him. Today her works command prices even higher than those paid for Rivera’s.\n\nThe MoMA show in December 1931 firmly established Rivera’s reputation in the United States, and when the time came to commission a mural for the front lobby of the RCA Building, Mother and Nelson argued strongly in favor of giving it to him. Rivera submitted a sketch for consideration, which was approved, and he agreed to a payment of $21,500 for a project which he estimated would take about three months to complete.\n\nHe arrived in New York in early 1933 to start work on the fresco after a very difficult experience at the Detroit Institute of Art, where his just-completed murals had been attacked as anti-Christian and anti-American. It would appear that Rivera decided to use the Rockefeller Center mural, Mankind at the Crossroads, to make a strong political statement. It was filled with contrasting images drawn from the Marxist canon: class conflict, oppression, and war as the theme on the “capitalist” side of the fresco; peace, cooperation, and human solidarity on the “Communist” side. The solution to these conflicts, at least in Rivera’s view, would come from the application of science and technology for the benefit of all. He filled the fresco with microscopes, telescopes, movie screens, and gigantic gears and levers to underline his point. When the mural was almost finished, he added a prominent and quite unmistakable portrait of Lenin joining hands with workers from around the world. This idyllic and somewhat fanciful grouping was balanced by a deftly done scene on the capitalist side of well-dressed men and women dancing, playing cards, and drinking martinis, all positioned under a microscope examining a slide filled with bacteria of social diseases. The backdrop for this was a scene of policemen beating workers while Catholic priests and Protestant ministers looked on approvingly.\n\nIt was wonderfully executed but not appropriate for the lobby of the RCA Building. Nelson tried to persuade Rivera to eliminate, at the very least, the portrait of Lenin. But the artist refused to change anything, saying that rather than mutilate his great work he would have the whole mural destroyed! Nelson pointed out that he had not been commissioned to paint Communist propaganda and that, based on the original, much less provocative sketch, there was no reason to accept the work as finally executed. In the end, when no compromise could be reached, Rivera was paid in full and dismissed. An attempt was made to remove and preserve the fresco, but it proved impossible, and this work of art had to be destroyed.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Rivera reproduced the mural, with more than a few embellishments, including a portrait of Father drinking a martini with a group of painted ladies. This mural is prominently located on the central staircase of the Palacio de Bellas Artes in Mexico City.\n\nDuring my 35 years at Chase Manhattan Bank, which ended with my retirement in 1981, I was frequently involved with the affairs of my hometown, New York. In the 1950s, I was chairman of a development in Upper Manhattan called Morningside Gardens. Soon after we began Morningside Gardens, I approached Robert Moses, the fabled New York “power broker” who then headed the Commission for Slum Clearance, with a request critical to Chase’s future. In order to build our new headquarters in Lower Manhattan, we needed the city’s permission to close, or “demap,” a one-block stretch of Cedar Street, a narrow but heavily traveled thoroughfare. If the city refused, the modern skyscraper we envisioned would be a nonstarter.\n\nPermanently closing a city street was not a routine request, but ours was the kind of daring and visionary project Moses liked. He acceded, but he also cautioned me, “You’ll be wasting your money unless others follow suit.” He pointed out that many Wall Street businesses had already moved uptown or were about to leave the city altogether. If any more left, Chase’s decision to remain would be viewed as a colossal blunder. Moses’s point was well taken. There had been almost no new construction in the Wall Street area since the 1920s. The financial district was cramped, dirty, congested, and a ghost town after five p.m.\n\nThe construction of a new Chase headquarters could make a difference but by itself would not be enough. If the physical infrastructure and public services in Lower Manhattan were not radically upgraded, the exodus from Wall Street would continue. Moses suggested that I put together an organization that could speak on behalf of the downtown financial community and offer a cohesive plan for the physical redevelopment of Wall Street to persuade the politicians to allocate the necessary resources.\n\nWith this objective in mind, I took the lead in organizing what became the Downtown– Lower Manhattan Association (D.L.M.A.). To ensure a high-powered and influential board I personally recruited such downtown business leaders as Cleo Craig, chairman of AT&T; Henry Alexander, chairman of J. P. Morgan; Howard Shepherd, chairman of National City Bank; John Butt, chairman of the Seamen’s Bank for Savings; Ralph Reed, treasurer of U.S. Steel; Keith Funston, president of the New York Stock Exchange; Harry Morgan, senior partner of Morgan Stanley; and others of similar stature. I served as chairman, and my close colleague Warren T. “Lindy” Lindquist became chief operating officer.\n\nTwo years after our first report, D.L.M.A. proposed the construction of a world- trade center that would firmly establish Lower Manhattan as the world’s trade and financial capital. In those days moving beyond the core of Wall Street meant entering a veritable commercial “slum.”\n\nOn the west side, squat, low-rise buildings and warehouses built in the late 19th century were now occupied by hundreds of stores whose dirty windows featured hand-lettered signs for cheap electronic gadgets. The east side was even worse. A defunct elevated railway, slowly rusting away and home to thousands of pigeons, loomed over a neighborhood of abandoned piers and warehouses. Just north, the Fulton Fish Market added a unique redolence to the area, especially on hot summer days.\n\nWe concentrated first on revitalizing the east side, which offered the greatest opportunities. D.L.M.A. commissioned the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to develop a plan for a 13.5-acre site that included a 70-story hotel-and-office building, an international trade mart and exhibition hall, and a central securities-exchange building, where we hoped the New York Stock Exchange would relocate.\n\nIt would be a costly undertaking. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey—an independent agency chartered by both states to manage New York’s maritime shipping, the area’s three airports, and regional transportation—seemed to be the only entity capable of financing such a massive project. Lindy and I discussed the matter at considerable length with Austin Tobin, executive director of the Port Authority, who enthusiastically agreed with our proposal and the Port Authority’s role.\n\nWith the Port Authority on board, we presented the proposal to those government officials whose endorsement was required. Mayor Robert Wagner was supportive; so, too, was the governor of New York—my brother Nelson. But Governor Robert Meyner of New Jersey, who liked the idea in principle, balked at locating the trade center on Water Street. He argued that New Jersey commuters arrived through the “tubes” on the west side of Manhattan and would be inconvenienced if they had to walk across town to work. Meyner’s objection could have torpedoed the project, so as a compromise Tobin suggested moving the trade center to the west side and building it above the existing train terminal for New Jersey commuters. With that issue resolved, I was optimistic that the project would move ahead immediately.\n\nAlas, we hadn’t considered the “special interests” who would be adversely impacted by the trade center. Midtown real-estate developers saw the downtown trade center as a threat to their rents and property values. Organized by Larry Wein, who owned the Empire State Building, this group posed as “valiant defenders” of the small downtown merchants threatened with relocation. They backed a series of legal challenges to the trade center, which held up the project for several years.\n\nThe trade-center plans called for 10 million square feet of office space, mostly in two 110-story buildings (taller than the Empire State Building, which may explain Larry Wein’s opposition) situated on a large plaza that would also include a number of smaller structures. Critics insisted the space would never be fully rented and demanded that the project be scaled back. But my brother Nelson immediately rode to the rescue by announcing that New York State, which wanted to consolidate its operations in the city, would lease one million square feet of office space, becoming the largest tenant. In 1965, after excavation for the “Twin Towers” (dubbed Nelson and David by the New York tabloids!) had begun, Nelson decided to take an additional million square feet of space. Nelson’s announcement elicited another chorus of gibes—some claiming I had interceded with Nelson to ensure sufficient tenants. In point of fact, neither I nor the D.L.M.A. had anything to do with the construction or rental of the trade center once the Port Authority assumed responsibility for the project.\n\nYears of litigation and delays added dramatically to the trade center’s final price tag of $1.5 billion, an amount five times the original estimate. The buildings were completed and occupied in stages between 1970 and 1977. The towers, at least for a time, would be the world’s tallest buildings and provide office space for more than 50,000 people. They used as much electricity as a city of 400,000, and their 40,000 tons of air-conditioning equipment was enough to cool refrigerators for a city of one million.\n\nThe World Trade Center soon became one of the city’s greatest assets. Like Chase Manhattan Plaza before it, the trade center helped anchor the financial community more solidly in Lower Manhattan. It provided new homes for Wall Street’s commodity exchanges and office space for all manner of large and small businesses. It was an essential public investment that brought immense benefits.\n\nIn 2000 the Rockefellers and their partners sold Rockefeller Center for $1.85 billion. The World Trade Center, which had become one of the most recognizable features of New York’s skyline, was destroyed on September 11, 2001, when Islamist terrorists crashed hijacked U.S. airliners into the Twin Towers.\n\nPurchase Memoirs on Amazon."
