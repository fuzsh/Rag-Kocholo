        "text": "Nelson Rockefeller, grandson of the famous John D. Rockefeller, was no stranger to luxury and privilege: The family name is synonymous with wealth in the U.S. The younger Rockefeller had an influence on both New York and the entire nation, serving as both Vice President and New York State governor.\n\nWith all that money and power, it's no surprise Rockefeller amassed his own impressive real estate portfolio. One of those properties, 810 Fifth Avenue, just went on the market for a staggering $27.5 million dollars. To put it in perspective, that's a monthly mortgage payment of over $100,000 with a 30-year fixed and a 20 percent â€\" or $5.5 million â€\" down payment.\n\nAccording to Zillow's real estate blog, the Nelson Rockefeller Residence occupies a large segment of the 12th floor and offers magnificent views of Central Park.\n\nKirk Henckels, Executive Vice President of Stribling, the listing brokerage, says the place was even bigger when Rockefeller and his first wife lived there together.\n\n\"When Vice President Rockefeller was married to his first wife, Mary, they owned the top three floors of 810 Fifth Avenue. After they divorced, the Vice President kept the bottom floor for himself and gave the top two floors to his ex-wife. He then purchased an apartment on an adjacent floor in the building next door, 812 Fifth Avenue, and broke through to his apartment at 810 Fifth Avenue, thereby joining the two buildings.\"\n\nAfter Rockefeller's death, his second wife separated the two apartments and kept 812 Fifth Avenue as her residence. She sold the one at 810 Fifth Avenue to the current sellers, so this property isn't too far removed from Rockefeller himself.\n\nThe floor plan is impressive: A 47-foot-long living room with two fireplaces, formal dining room and a library with a full bath. There's also a massive two-bedroom master suite with a dressing room and oversized master bath, double sized \"staff bedroom\" with its own bathroom and a large family room off the kitchen.\n\nDespite the huge $27.5 million dollar price tag, the Nelson Rockefeller Residence is currently configured with only two bedrooms. The listing says two additional bedrooms were removed to create the large entertaining space and could be added back into the floor plan; at that price, I hope the construction costs are included.\n\nWhat do you think - is Nelson Rockefeller's New York Residence worth the $27.5 million price tag?\n\nMore on MoneyWatch:\n\nWhat Can You Rent for $20,000 a Month?\n\nRefinancing: The Top 5 Mistakes You Don't Want to Make\n\nTop 10 Places to Live in 2011\n\nHouse vs. College: Which Costs More?\n\nWalt Disney's House for Sale\n\nJerry Seinfeld's Colorado Estate on the Market\n\nKatharine Hepburn's Beloved Summer Home for Sale\n\nHow Accurate is the S&P Case/Shiller Home Price Index?\n\nRealtor Data Undergoes Reporting Change\n\nTop 4 School District Home Prices\n\nTop 10 Cities for Single Men\n\nWhere Will William and Kate Live?\n\nTop 5 States for Depreciating Home Values\n\nHome Sales, Home Values Decline\n\nNuclear Meltdown: Will Your Homeowners Insurance Protect You From Radiation Damage?\n\nNew Home Sales Fall To Lowest Level on Record\n\nTop 5 States for Underwater Mortgages\n\nLoan Modification Help for Military Servicemembers\n\nIlyce R.
