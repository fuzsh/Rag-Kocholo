        "text": "Rockefellers have known prominence, tragedy\n\nDr. Richard Rockefeller, killed Friday after the plane he was piloting crashed in Purchase, was the son of David Rockefeller, the nephew of the late Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, the grandson of philanthropist John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller Sr., founder of Standard Oil.\n\nAs one of Westchester's most prominent families, they have known fame and tragedy.\n\nProminence\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller Sr.: Born in 1839 in Southern Tier town of Richford, N.Y., he is considered the founder of the dynasty. In 1870, he founded Standard Oil. He later built Kykuit, the family estate in Pocantico Hills, and began the family's tradition of philanthropy. He died in 1937 at age 97.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller Jr.: Commonly referred to as \"Junior\" to differentiate from his father, he was born in 1874, the youngest of five children. He joined Standard Oil in 1897 but left the company in 1910 to pursue philanthropy. He gave more than $537 million to various causes in his lifetime. Junior oversaw the development of Rockefeller Center, the 14-building Art Deco campus in midtown Manhattan. He and his wife, Abigail Greene Aldrich, had five children: Abigail Aldrich Rockefeller, 1903-1976; John D. Rockefeller III, 1906-1978; Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller, 1908-1979; Laurance Spelman Rockefeller, 1910-2004; Winthrop Aldrich Rockefeller, 1912-1973; and David Rockefeller, who was born in 1915 and turned 99 on Thursday.\n\nNelson Rockefeller: The second of Junior's five children was elected 49th governor of New York in 1958 and named the 41st Vice President of the United States in 1974. A moderate Republican, he lost the 1964 presidential nomination to Barry Goldwater. He is best remembered for his 14 years in Albany, which saw the expansion of state government in the areas of education (including the founding of SUNY Purchase), conservation, transportation, housing and the arts. With his first wife, Mary Todhunter Clark, he had five children. In 1962, he divorced and on May 4, 1963, created a scandal by marrying also-divorced socialite Margaretta Large Fitler \"Happy\" Murphy. They had two children. Nelson Rockefeller died in 1979 after suffering a heart attack while in his Manhattan townhouse with his 25-year-old assistant, Megan Marshack.\n\nJohn \"Jay\" D. Rockefeller IV: West Virginia's senior senator, a former governor and – unusual for the family's politicians, a Democrat – Jay Rockefeller announced he would not seek re-election in 2014. He was first elected to the Senate in 1984 while serving as governor, a position he'd held since 1977. Jay was born in 1937 and is a great-grandson of the family's patriarch.\n\nDavid Rockefeller: The last surviving of Junior's children, David Rockefeller is best known for his philanthropy and for the role he played in the development of the World Trade Center as chairman of the Chase National Bank. In 2004, David Rockefeller and daughter Peggy Dulany and associate James Ford created the Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture as a memorial to his late wife, Peggy. He is the current patriarch of the Rockefeller family and lives at Hudson Pines, his Pocantico Hills estate adjacent to Kykuit.\n\nTragedy\n\nThe Rockefellers have endured their share of tragedy, too. Here are some Rockefellers whose deaths were particularly notable:\n\nWinifred Rockefeller Emeny: A socialite and great-niece of John D. Rockefeller Sr., she committed suicide on March 15, 1951 by leaving two cars running in her Greenwich garage; two of her daughters were found dead in one of the cars.\n\nMichael Rockefeller: One of Nelson's seven children, Michael died in 1961 while visiting Netherlands New Guinea on a mission to gather indigenous art. He was 23 when the canoe he was in overturned in rough water several miles from shore. His fate remains a mystery, though decades of rumors (and several books) suggest that after swimming to shore he was killed and eaten by cannibals. Despite an extensive search, his body was never found.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller III: The philanthropist and father of West Virginia's Sen. Jay Rockefeller was killed on July 10, 1978 in a three-car crash on state Route 448 in Mount Pleasant. He was en route to Pocantico Hills from his farm in Mount Pleasant when David Low, a 16-year-old from Briarcliff Manor, crashed head-on into the car Rockefeller's secretary was driving.\n\nFake-efellers\n\nThere also have been impostors and those who have the surname but aren't part of the clan.\n\nChristian Gerhartsreiter: Earned himself the No. 1 spot on Time Magazine's Top-10 list of imposters by claiming to be Clark Rockefeller, one of many aliases he's used since the 1970s. The German-born \"Crockefeller,\" as the tabloids dubbed him, was arrested in 2008 (posing as an aristocrat was the least of his offenses) and is serving a 27-years-to-life sentence for murder."
