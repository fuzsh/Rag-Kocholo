According to the police report filed in January of 1979: Shortly after 11pm, 70 year old Nelson Rockefeller collapsed in a Manhattan townhouse. He was in the company of a 22 year old blonde (political aide Megan Marshack) under ‚Äúundeniably intimate‚Äù circumstances. She had attempted CPR, with the help of a friend she had called (reporter Ponchitta Pierce). Pierce eventually called the police. Rockefeller was alive when paramedics arrived but died at the hospital from a heart attack. \nThe initial press release said he died at his desk and the story changed several more times. Marshack, after being made fodder for many jokes, went into seclusion. Children of Rockefeller actually came to her defense saying they thought she ‚Äúdid her best‚Äù to save their father. They didn‚Äôt actually comment on the circumstances. And an interesting bit of info... young Miss Marshack was paid $60,000 a year in 1977 as political aid (about $270,000 in today‚Äôs money) and was given an interest free loan of $45,000 to purchase a co-op just two doors down from Rockefeller‚Äôs luxury townhouse. I wonder if the loan got paid back. Well Marshack apparently took seclusion seriously because I could find no more info on her after 1979. \n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\n‚Ä¢\nI tried to make sure the info is accurate. If it‚Äôs not, let me know. #vintage #history #scandal #politics #juicy #gossip #nelsonrockefeller #meganmarshack #1970s #70s #vicepresident #governor #newyork #photooftheday #picoftheday\".",
