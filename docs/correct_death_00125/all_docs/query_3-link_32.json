        "text": "(1908–79). When Gerald R. Ford assumed the U.S. presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Richard M. Nixon, the provisions of the 25th Amendment to the United States Constitution enabled him to choose a vice-presidential candidate for the Congress to approve. Ford chose Nelson A. Rockefeller, a liberal Republican who had served as governor of New York from 1959 to 1973 and had unsuccessfully sought his party’s presidential nomination several times.\n\nNelson Aldrich Rockefeller—the son of businessman John D. Rockefeller, Jr., and Abby Greene Aldrich—was born on July 8, 1908, in Bar Harbor, Me. His paternal grandfather, John D. Rockefeller, Sr., founded the Standard Oil Company and was one of the wealthiest people in the United States; his maternal grandfather, Nelson W. Aldrich, was a longtime Republican senator from Rhode Island.\n\nRockefeller attended Lincoln School of Teachers’ College at Columbia University, a New York City school with students from varied economic backgrounds. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., in 1930 with a degree in economics. That same year, he married Mary Todhunter Clark, who came from a prosperous Philadelphia family; they had five children together before their divorce in the early 1960s.\n\nBefore entering public service, Rockefeller worked for a number of family enterprises, including Chase National (later Chase Manhattan) Bank and Rockefeller Center. As director of Creole Petroleum—a Standard Oil affiliate with large holdings in Venezuela—from 1935 to 1940, Rockefeller acquired fluency in Spanish and a profound interest in Latin America. In 1940 he took his first post with the federal government as coordinator of inter-American affairs at the State Department. Although he was a Republican in the Democratic administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, in 1944 Rockefeller rose to the position of assistant secretary of state for Latin American affairs.\n\nIn 1945 Rockefeller left the federal government and a year later became one of the founders of a private nonprofit group formed to help developing nations in Latin America. He returned to government service in 1950, during the administration of Harry S. Truman, as head of the International Development Advisory Board, and two years later he was appointed chairman of a presidential advisory committee on government organization by president-elect Dwight D. Eisenhower. From 1953 to 1955 Rockefeller served as undersecretary of the newly created Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.\n\nSeeking an elective rather than appointive office, Rockefeller ran for governor of New York in 1958 against incumbent W. Averell Harriman and won by more than 500,000 votes. His victory made him a prominent candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 1960, but he withdrew when it became clear that Nixon would be the nominee. Reelected governor in 1962, 1966, and 1970, Rockefeller oversaw massive changes in New York’s fiscal, cultural, and educational policies and facilities. The state university system was greatly expanded, and the number of state employees and the size of the budget doubled and quadrupled, respectively.\n\nWith Nixon out of the presidential contest in 1964, Rockefeller again sought the Republican nomination. He had outraged his party’s traditionalists, however, by marrying Margaretta Fitler Murphy (nicknamed Happy)—some 19 years his junior—in 1963; Murphy had divorced her husband and gave him custody of their children only five weeks before she wed Rockefeller. As leader of the Republican party’s liberal wing, Rockefeller was opposed by conservative Barry Goldwater, who won the nomination by a slim margin. At the party convention, Rockefeller fought strongly, though unsuccessfully, to maintain a commitment to civil rights in the Republican platform. Reflecting a deep division between liberal and conservative Republicans, Rockefeller, who had denounced Goldwater as an extremist, was heckled by Goldwater supporters during his address. Throughout the ensuing campaign, he steadfastly refused to endorse Goldwater’s candidacy.\n\nRockefeller again entered the presidential race in 1968 and again was defeated for the nomination—for the second time by Nixon. In 1970, however, he won his fourth term as governor, defeating former United States Supreme Court justice and United Nations representative Arthur Goldberg by nearly 700,000 votes. It was during this term that Rockefeller, amid a storm of controversy, used force to stop a 1971 riot at the state prison at Attica, leading to the deaths of many inmates and hostages.\n\nRockefeller retired as governor in December 1973, more than a year before his term expired, to devote time to the National Commission on Critical Choices for America and to the Commission on Water Quality. Following Ford’s rise to the nation’s highest office, after the Watergate scandal and Nixon’s resignation, Rockefeller underwent weeks of intense Congressional hearings before the House and Senate confirmed him as vice-president on Dec. 19, 1974. As the appointed head of Ford’s Domestic Council, Rockefeller attempted to create a role for himself as the president’s principal adviser on domestic policy, but his efforts were hampered by the liberal character of some of his proposals and the opposition of other administration officials. As the 1976 presidential campaign drew near, Ford was challenged for the Republican nomination by conservative Ronald Reagan, and Rockefeller, then viewed as a political liability, announced that he did not wish to be considered for renomination as vice-president.\n\nRockefeller also was known as a collector and patron of art. He served as a trustee of the Museum of Modern Art and was the founder and president of the Museum of Primitive Art (in 1982 incorporated into the Metropolitan Museum of Art as the Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Wing), both in New York City. In 1978 he published Masterpieces of Primitive Art. Rockefeller died of heart failure on Jan. 26, 1979, in New York City."
