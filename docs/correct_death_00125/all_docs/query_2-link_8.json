        "text": "American journalist\n\nMegan Ruth Marshack[1] is an American television news writer and producer who served as an aide and was the mistress to former Vice President Nelson Rockefeller and was with him when he died on January 26, 1979.[2][3]\n\nBiography[edit]\n\nBorn in California, Marshack worked on Rockefeller's vice-presidential staff, in Washington, D.C., for two years.[4] There was speculation in the press regarding the nature of the relationship between Rockefeller and Marshack. For example, long-time Rockefeller aide Joseph E. Persico claimed in the PBS documentary about the Rockefeller family, \"It became known that he had been alone with a young woman who worked for him, in undeniably intimate circumstances, and in the course of that evening had died from a heart attack.\"[5] News organizations widely reported that Marshack was a named beneficiary in his will, which specified that loans to Marshack totalling $45,000 were to be forgiven. The bulk of his estate was left to his wife with other large gifts going to museums.[6]\n\nPrior to her employment with Rockefeller, she was a radio news reporter for the Associated Press.[7]\n\nMarshack has remained largely out of the public eye since 1979. For about a year after Rockefeller died, she dated 68-year-old cartoonist Charles Addams, who lived in the same apartment building as she did.[8]\n\nIn 1992, it was reported that Marshack was still living in New York working as a news writer for WCBS-TV, but The Washington Post noted she declined to comment, saying \"I don't do interviews.\"[9] According to newspapers in September 1994, she was a news writer and producer at WCBS-TV.[10] In December 2008, Parade reported that Marshack married a journalist and was living in Southern California.[11]"
