        "text": "The Rockefeller name looms large in America, referred to in US history textbooks and engraved on building placards thanks to patriarch John D. Rockefeller’s work in the oil, banking, and railroad industries. But in spite of its myriad associations, the surname is synonymous first and foremost with wealth itself. The magnate’s fortune ascended to astronomical levels in the late 19th century after he founded petroleum juggernaut Standard Oil, making him the world’s first billionaire (by measurable dollars) and cementing his family’s place among the nation’s blue bloods for generations to come. A number of Rockefeller scions reached the upper echelons of American politics, most notably 49th governor of New York and later VP to President Gerald Ford, Nelson Rockefeller, while others focused on growing the family fortune; John’s grandson David Rockefeller, who expanded the influence of the Rockefeller banking empire as CEO of Chase Manhattan bank, died in 2017 with an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion. As of 2020, Forbes estimated the family’s overall value at $8.4 billion.\n\nWith the kind of fortune few other families in history could conceive of, the Rockefeller mansions are as opulent as one might expect. While their commissioned properties—like New York’s iconic Rockefeller Center—are perhaps more readily called to mind by the public, dozens of other Rockefeller family properties appear on the National Register of Historic Places. From their roots in Cleveland to the state of their greatest influence, New York, read on for a selection of the many lavish Rockefeller mansions.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller’s childhood home\n\nWhile obviously not the kind of well-appointed mansion that the Rockefeller name came to be known for, this modest home is where John D. Rockefeller started out. He was born on his family’s farm near Richford, New York, in 1839. The Rockefellers moved around throughout his young life, eventually relocating to Ohio.\n\nKykuit\n\nIn 1893, John D. Rockefeller bought the manor known as Kykuit in the Westchester County, New York, hamlet of Pocantico Hills. Dutch traders gave the manse its name, which translates to “lookout.” The original wood house burned down in 1902 and was replaced by a three-story Victorian-style home in 1908, however that incarnation didn’t last long, as Mrs. Rockefeller was not a fan. Five years later, a Georgian-style four-story estate with a mansard roof was erected in its place.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller lived in the main house on the grounds while his son John D. Rockefeller Jr. resided with his own family in a separate residence on the compound. Upon John Sr.’s death, John Jr. moved into the main dwelling; afterward, Nelson lived in the estate until his 1979 death. Many of the Rockefeller heirs would go on to call Kykuit home over the years, though each of their individual residences outside of the main house bore their own names, including Hawes House, formerly for Nelson Rockefeller and Laurance Rockefeller’s Kent House.\n\nA midtown Manhattan brownstone\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller relocated the family to New York in 1884, establishing their new home base in a large brownstone at 4 West 54th Street. The grounds on which the town house once stood are now part of the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Abby Rockefeller, wife of John D. Rockefeller Jr., is recognized as one of the museum’s cofounders.\n\nForest Hill summer home\n\nEnvisioned by John D. Rockefeller as a resort centered around a Victorian mansion, the Cleveland area house was added to the Rockefeller family portfolio in 1873. The “water cure” resort was not one of the magnate’s more fruitful business ventures; after it closed the estate became the family’s summer house and continued to serve as a seasonal getaway after they left the midwest for New York in 1884. The original house burned down in 1917.\n\nThe Eyrie summer home\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller Jr. purchased the family’s Seal Harbor, Maine, estate in 1910. The financier would shepherd the cottage through vast renovations to expand its footprint in the following years, as legend has it, to a whopping 99 rooms. The sprawling manse overlooked the water. Surrounding plots that the Rockefellers snapped up in subsequent years would be donated to the very first National Park east of the Mississippi in 1919.\n\nDonating lands to the National Parks system became part of the Rockefeller family legacy over the years. In addition to Maine’s Acadia National Park, the family is credited with gifting large swaths of land to the state in Grand Teton National Park and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, among others.\n\nA New York State Executive Mansion residency\n\nThe New York Governor’s Mansion was temporarily a Rockefeller mansion when Nelson Rockefeller became the state’s governor. He would hold the position from 1959 to 1973, but his time in the original abode was short: The Italianate mansion that had hosted the Empire State’s first families since 1875 caught fire in 1961."
