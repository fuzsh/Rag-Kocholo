        "text": "Margaretta \"Happy\" Rockefeller, the widow of Nelson Rockefeller, the former vice president and New York governor, and one of the first women to speak publicly about her breast cancer in the 1970s, has died. She was 88.\n\nHappy Rockefeller, who earned her nickname as a child because of her pleasant personality, died peacefully in her sleep Tuesday at her home in Tarrytown, N.Y., said family spokesman Fraser Seitel. She had suffered from a brief illness.\n\nBoth she and the New York governor were divorced when they married in 1963. That was seen as scandalous at the time, and political pundits blamed the marriage for Nelson Rockefeller's failure to secure the 1964 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAt that time, no divorced candidate had ever won the presidency; Ronald Reagan, elected in 1980, so far has been the only divorced elected president.\n\nAfter her husband served four terms as New York's governor, he was named by President Gerald Ford to serve as vice president after Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974. Shortly after being chosen, Happy Rockefeller was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent two mastectomies. She and Ford's wife, Betty, were among the first women to speak publicly about the disease.\n\nIn 1991, she was appointed as a public delegate to the United Nations by President George H.W. Bush.\n\nShe was born Margaretta Large Fitler on June 9, 1926. In 1948, she married Dr. James Slater Murphy. The couple had four children.\n\nShe divorced Murphy about a month before marrying Rockefeller in May 1963. They had two sons. Rockefeller died in 1979.\n\nMetro on 05/21/2015"
