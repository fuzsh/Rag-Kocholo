        "text": "Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller (July 8, 1908 - January 26, 1979) was an American philanthropist, politician and businessman who served as Vice President of the United States from 1957 until 1961 under Richard Nixon and Governor of New York from 1963 until 1973. He was also the Republican nominee for the presidency in 1960.\n\nPolitical Career[]\n\nRockefeller began his political career with the Roosevelt administration in 1944 when he was appointed the 1st Assistant Secretary of State for American Republic Affairs but took a political hiatus after a short time in the Truman administration until 1953 when he was appointed the 1st Under Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, he would only last a year there.\n\nVice Presidency[]\n\nAfter the death of President Eisenhower his Vice President Richard Nixon, Rockefeller's rival, took the Presidency. But in a surprising move, possibly to present a united front for the next upcoming election the GOP decided that Rockefeller would get the nod for the V.P. slot on the ticket. The Nixon/Rockefeller ticket beat the democratic Stevenson/Humphrey handedly.\n\nRockefeller was sworn in on January 20th, 1957 as the 37th Vice President of the United States. In early 1957, Nelson undertook foreign to Africa. On his return, he helped shepherd the Civil Rights Act of 1957 through Congress. The bill was weakened in the Senate, and civil rights leaders were divided over whether Nixon should sign it. Rockefeller advised the President to sign the bill, which he did. In July 1959 President Nixon sent Rockefeller to the Soviet Union for the opening of the American National Exhibition in Moscow. On July 24, Rockefeller was touring the exhibits with Soviet First Secretary and Premier Nikita Khrushchev when the two stopped at a model of an American kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the \"Kitchen Debate\".\n\n1960 Presidential election[]\n\nAlthough Nixon was eligible to run for a second full term the President decided against it, this left Rockefeller as the front runner for the nomination. He defeated George H. Bender of Ohio and Cecil Underwood of West Virginia in the primaries and secured the nomination at the Republican convention. He selected Conservative Senator Barry Goldwater but the two were too different and often contradicted each other on the campaign trail, this lead to the democratic ticket of Al Gore Sr. and Hubert H. Humphrey to win the election.\n\nGovernor of New York[]\n\nRockefeller decided not to be deterred by the presidential loss and in 1961 he ran for the gubernatorial seat of his home state of New York. He faced no real opposition in the primaries and in the general election he faced democrat Robert Morgenthau whom he would beat by a landslide. During his time as governor he increased the state's role in education, environmental protection, transportation, housing, welfare, medical aid, civil rights, and the arts. To pay for the increased government spending, Rockefeller increased taxation - for example, a sales tax was introduced in New York in 1965. He would be re-elected 2 times in 1966 and 1970 but after a stroke in 1973 he would resign and retire from politics.\n\nLater life and death[]\n\nRockefeller's early visits to Mexico kindled a collecting interest in pre-Columbian and contemporary Mexican art, to which he added works of traditional African and Pacific Island art. In 1954 he established the Museum of Primitive Art devoted to the indigenous art of the Americas, Africa, Oceania and early Asia and Europe. His personal collection formed the core of the collection. \"In 1956, Frederic Huntington Douglas was named honorary Curator of the American Indian section of the Nelson Rockefeller Museum of Native Arts in New York.\" The museum opened to the public in 1957 in a townhouse at 15 West 54th Street in New York City. In 1969 he gave the museum's collection to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where it became the Michael C. Rockefeller Collection.\n\nRockefeller died on January 26, 1979 from a heart attack. He was 70. An initial report incorrectly stated that he died at his desk in his office at Rockefeller Center. However, the report was soon corrected to state that Rockefeller actually had the fatal heart attack at another location: a townhouse he owned at 13 West 54th Street. The heart attack occurred in the late evening in the presence of Megan Marshack, a 25-year-old aide. After Rockefeller suffered the heart attack, Marshack called her friend, news reporter Ponchitta Pierce, to the townhouse; Pierce phoned an ambulance approximately an hour after the heart attack.\n\nPersonal Life[]\n\nOn June 23, 1930, Rockefeller married Mary Todhunter Clark. They had five children: Rodman Clark Rockefeller, Ann Rockefeller, Steven Clark Rockefeller, and twins Michael Clark Rockefeller and Mary Rockefeller. Michael Rockefeller disappeared in New Guinea in November 1961. He is presumed to have drowned while trying to swim to shore after his dugout canoe capsized.\n\nNelson and Mary Rockefeller were divorced in 1962. On May 4, 1963, Rockefeller married Margaretta Large \"Happy\" Fitler. They had two sons together: Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller Jr. and Mark Fitler Rockefeller. With his first wife, Rockefeller had lived at the three top floors at 810 Fifth Avenue. After his divorce and second marriage, Mary Rockefeller kept the two top floors of the triplex apartment. The apartment was expanded by purchasing a floor of 812 Fifth Avenue. The two spaces connected via a flight of six steps. Nelson and Happy Rockefeller used the entrance at 812 Fifth, while his first wife entered through 810 Fifth. They remained married until his death. Rockefeller engaged in numerous extramarital affairs during his marriages. His first wife resented his adultery, which was one of the main reasons for their divorce. Rockefeller convinced his first wife early in the marriage that they should live separate lives but stay married for the sake of public appearances and the children."
