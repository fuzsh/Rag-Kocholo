        "text": "Was John D. Rockefeller's great-grandson Michael killed and eaten by cannibals in the remote wilds of New Guinea in 1961? Go inside the disturbing disappearance of this famed scion.\n\nThe Rockefeller name has a long and storied history in American business and politics, from Standard Oil co-founder John D. Rockefeller, widely considered the wealthiest person of all time, to his grandson Nelson Rockefeller, who served as governor of New York from 1959 to 1973 and Vice President to Gerald Ford from 1974 to 1977.\n\nBut among the long line of Rockefellers, there is one whose story is marked by tragedy, mystery, and grisly theories about his untimely death.\n\nMichael Clark Rockefeller was Nelson Rockefellerâs youngest son, a quiet and artistic young man who wanted more out of life than four walls in an office building. So after graduating from Harvard in 1960, Michael Rockefeller decided to make his mark on the world not as another businessman or politician â as many a Rockefeller had done before him â but instead as a collector of what was then called âprimitive art.â\n\nWhile on a trip to Dutch New Guinea in October 1961, the small boat transporting Rockefeller and his companion, RenÃ© Wassing, capsized roughly 14 miles from the shore. Rockefeller felt he could make it to land and swam off into the water, never to be seen again.\n\nWhat followed was a media whirlwind as the son of New Yorkâs governor and the scion of Americaâs most famous wealthy family remained missing despite an enormous search effort. Ships, airplanes, and helicopters scoured the region, but there was no sign of him.\n\nNine days later, the Dutch interior minister declared, âThere is no longer any hope of finding Michael Rockefeller alive.â Two weeks later, the search was officially called off, and Michael Rockefellerâs cause of death was listed as drowning.\n\nHis body was never found. But in 2014, National Geographic reporter Carl Hoffman released a book titled Savage Harvest: A Tale of Cannibals, Colonialism and Michael Rockefellerâs Tragic Quest for Primitive Art. This book claimed that the evidence from the inquiries of Dutch officials proved that Michael Rockefeller had, in fact, been killed and eaten by a local tribe.\n\nHoffman wrote that after deciding to kill Rockefeller, the tribe allegedly cut his skull open and eaten his brains, turned his bones into daggers and fishing spears, and drained his blood and coated themselves in it while performing ritual dances. But, in the end, what happened to Michael Rockefeller in October 1961 remains a mystery to this day.\n\nLearn more about the chilling story of Michael Rockefeller.\n\nLearn more about the music used in our podcast.
