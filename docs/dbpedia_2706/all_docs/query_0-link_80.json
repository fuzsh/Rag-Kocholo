This document summarizes the taxonomic realignment of plant species names used in Burkill's Dictionary of Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula to current accepted names. It describes how Burkill compiled the dictionary over 25 years using plant specimens collected in Malaysia and information from local collectors. It also provides context on the development of botanical study in Malaysia from the 1800s onwards. The introduction of Turner's 1995 vascular plant catalogue of the Malay Peninsula provides an updated species checklist. This study realigns 876 species from 464 genera in Burkill's dictionary to their current accepted names.",
