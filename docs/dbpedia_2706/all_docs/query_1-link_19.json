        "text": "Indian Medicinal Plants, Phytochemistry And Therapeutics 2.0 (IMPPAT 2.0) is a manually curated database which has been constructed via digitalization of information from more than 100 books on traditional Indian medicine, 7000+ published research articles and other existing resources. IMPPAT 2.0 is the largest digital database on phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants to date, and is a significant enhancement and expansion over IMPPAT 1.0.\n\nIMPPAT 2.0 captures the following types of associations:\n\n(a) Indian medicinal plant - Plant part - Phytochemical\n\n(b) Indian medicinal plant - Plant part - Therapeutic use\n\nThe current version 2.0 released on June 17, 2022 of the IMPPAT database captures 4010 Indian medicinal plants, 17967 phytochemicals and 1095 therapeutic uses. This is more than 2-fold increase in coverage of Indian medicinal plants and nearly 2-fold increase in the number of phytochemicals compared to IMPPAT 1.0. More importantly, the phytochemicals and the therapeutic uses of the Indian medicinal plants are now provided at the level of plant parts. Another significant update is the 5-fold increase in the number of Indian medicinal plant - Phytochemical associations and Indian medicinal plant - Therapeutic use associations in comparison to IMPPAT 1.0. Note that the earlier version 1.0 of IMPPAT was released on January 25, 2018.\n\nImportantly, for the 17967 phytochemicals in this database, we provide the two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) chemical structures, and have employed cheminformatics tools to compute their physicochemical properties, drug-likeness based on multiple scoring schemes, and predicted Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties. Apart from viewing phytochemicals based on physicochemical properties, drug-likeness properties, and chemical similarity, the website now enables viewing the phytochemicals based on molecular scaffolds.\n\nIn a nutshell, IMPPAT is the largest database on phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants to date, and this resource is a culmination of our ongoing efforts to digitize the wealth of information contained within traditional Indian medicine. IMPPAT provides an integrated platform to apply cheminformatic approaches to accelerate natural product based drug discovery. IMPPAT is also expected to enable application of systems-level approaches towards future elucidation of mechanistic links between phytochemicals of Indian medicinal plants and their therapeutic action.\n\nWe welcome suggestions from researchers in academia and industry for future improvements of our database."
