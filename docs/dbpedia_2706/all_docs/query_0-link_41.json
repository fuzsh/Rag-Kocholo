        "text": "In 1972, Jaime Hinton and Jerzy Rzedowski published the biography of George Boole Hinton (1882-1943, Figure 1), a botanical collector born in London, England (a spanish version of this contribution was published in 1975). These authors point out that in 1911 he arrived in Mexico and after working for many years as a metallurgist, at the age of 54 he retired from mining to devote himself to collecting botanical specimens. During ten years of intense activity of fieldwork, Hinton managed to make a collection of just over 16,000 numbers from difficult and unexplored localities in the states of Guerrero, MÃ©xico, and MichoacÃ¡n. In his biography, Hinton and Rzedowski relate the difficulties encountered and the effort required to amass one of the best collections of regions of Mexico that to this day persist as scientifically underexplored due to the ruggedness of the topography and to social and political unrest.\n\nFondness for collecting botanical specimens was also acquired by Georgeâs son James (1915-2006, Figure 1), who in July 1937 joined his father for fieldwork in the state of Guerrero. He soon became one of the main collectors of Mexican plants; after his father's death he continued collecting specimens in other parts of the country, especially Coahuila, Nuevo LeÃ³n, Oaxaca, and Tamaulipas. Table 1 indicates the number of collections carried out in these states based on the collections of George and James Hinton. Later, when James was living in the state of Nuevo LeÃ³n, his son George Sebastian (Figure 1) began accompanying James on his botanical explorations. Since then, George S. has continued this tradition, building up one of the largest personal scientific collection documenting the flora of northeastern Mexico, with the discovery of many new taxa. Based on all these collections, 6 genera and 621 new species were discovered.\n\nThis paper aims to document and analyze the entire Hinton collection in order to evaluate its contribution to our knowledge of the flora of Mexico. As can be seen in Table 1, there are three main periods when the Hinton family (the grandfather, the son, and the grandson) carried out fieldwork, mostly restricted to specific regions in the country. The role of each set of specimens is evaluated and their contribution to the knowledge of the regional and national flora is discussed. Finally, a list of the accepted species and the collection numbers documenting their occurrence is provided. The material that forms the basis of the descriptions of the new taxa is highlighted.\n\nA short story of the collecting effort of the Hinton family. George B. Hinton started fieldwork on October 11th, 1931. His first plant collected was Elaphoglossum erinaceum (FÃ©e) T. Moore in the La Labor, District (now Municipality) of Temascaltepec, state of MÃ©xico. His last collection was number 16,314 on January 31, 1943 from the Los Hornos, District of Temascaltepec. In that period he was assisted by Luis MartÃ­nez and GerÃ³nimo GarcÃ­a, natives of the region. On July 23, 1937, his son James left his studies in Canada to help his father full time in his collecting enterprise. James started his collecting in the state of Guerrero. This first period accounts for about 16,000 collecting numbers and resulted in the description of 471 new taxa.\n\nAfter his fatherÂ´s death in 1944 James collected intermittently in Coahuila, Nuevo LeÃ³n, and Morelos. In 1964 he started collecting again in the alpine areas of southeastern Nuevo LeÃ³n and adjacent Coahuila. He also collected in alpine regions of Tamaulipas and later in Oaxaca. James continued the numbering of his father and his last collecting was recorded on October 14, 1995 (GBH 26,855). During this time, he collected 7,227 numbers, which included 116 new taxa.\n\nJamesâ son George Sebastian started collecting plants in 1989; with his father he made 1,183 collections and 6,712 on his own. After his fatherâs death, he has continued to conduct fieldwork, mostly in the states of Coahuila and Nuevo LeÃ³n, and has also continued the numbering started by his grandfather. One genus and 34 new taxa have been described from these collections. To date, the Hintonsâ collection catalogues almost 29,000 collection numbers."
