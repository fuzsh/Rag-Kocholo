        "text": "Calais - Peter DelMonaco, 87, died January 20, 2015 at the Blaire House Nursing Center in Tewksbury, MA. Peter was born December 30, 1927 in Providence, RI, the son of Peter and Maria Maddelena (DiCenzo) DelMonaco. He attended Nathaniel Greene Jr. School in Providence and graduated from the Calais Academy in 1945. He also attended the University of Maine at Orono, where he studied engineering. Peter worked for nearly 60 years in the family construction business, Thomas DiCenzo, Inc.\n\nHe was predeceased by his parents, his sister Anna and her husband Harold Drew, brother William DelMonaco and wife Phoebe, and brother Nicholas DelMonaco.\n\nOn October 27, 1957 he married his loving wife Irene (Little). Peter will be deeply missed by his devoted wife, beloved son Dr. John DelMonaco and wife Jennifer (Nisi), adored grandchildren Sabrina and Isabelle, brother Edmund and wife Margaret, sister-in-law Geraldine, two special nieces Diane Brown and Donna Geel, and many cousins, nieces, and nephews.\n\nAlways generous with his time, Peter often worked on landscaping or construction projects for family and friends. No matter how small or large the project, he saw that it was completed to perfection. A recent project of which he was exceptionally proud was the restoration of the Stations of the Cross at the Immaculate Conception Church. He drew great joy from working in his vegetable and flower gardens, never allowing the harsh weather to interfere with the growth of his beautiful roses. Peter lived a life filled with vitality and, when he wasn’t working on projects, he greatly enjoyed traveling with his family. His visits to Sulmona, Italy were particularly cherished.\n\nPeter was a member of the Lions Club, a Trustee of the Calais Regional Hospital, a member of the Maine Better Transportation Association, and a communicant of the Immaculate Conception Church of Calais. Donations in Peter’s memory can be made to the Anna Drew Scholarship Fund, The Bank of Maine, 344 Main Street, Calais, ME 04619.\n\nVisiting hours will be held 6-8 p.m. Friday, January 23, 2015 at Mays Funeral Home, 26 Church St., Calais. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated by Father Rob Lupo 11 a.m. Saturday, January 24, at Immaculate Conception R.C. Church, 31 Calais Ave., Calais. Burial will follow in Calais Cemetery."
