        "text": "The woman who will always be remembered as the crazy, accident-prone, lovable Lucy Ricardo was born Lucille Desiree Ball on August 6, 1911 in Jamestown, New York, the daughter of Desiree Evelyn \"DeDe\" (Hunt) and Henry Durrell \"Had\" Ball. Her father died before she was four, and her mother worked several jobs, so she and her younger brother were raised by their grandparents. Always willing to take responsibility for her brother and young cousins, she was a restless teenager who yearned to \"make some noise\". She entered a dramatic school in New York City, but while her classmate Bette Davis received all the raves, she was sent home; \"too shy\". She found some work modeling for Hattie Carnegie's and, in 1933, she was chosen to be a \"Goldwyn Girl\" and appear in the film Roman Scandals (1933).\n\nShe was put under contract to RKO Radio Pictures and several small roles, including one in Ich tanz mich in dein Herz hinein (1935), followed. Eventually, she received starring roles in B-pictures and, occasionally, a good role in an A-picture, like in Bühneneingang (1937) or The Big Street (1942). While filming Too Many Girls (1940), she met and fell madly in love with a young Cuban actor-musician named Desi Arnaz. Despite different personalities, lifestyles, religions and ages (he was six years younger), he fell hard, too, and after a passionate romance, they eloped and were married in November 1940. Lucy soon switched to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where she got better roles in films such as Du Barry Was a Lady (1943); Best Foot Forward (1943) and the Katharine Hepburn-Spencer Tracy vehicle Zu klug für die Liebe (1945). In 1948, she took a starring role in the radio comedy \"My Favorite Husband\", in which she played the scatterbrained wife of a Midwestern banker. In 1950, CBS came knocking with the offer of turning it into a television series. After convincing the network brass to let Desi play her husband and to sign over the rights to and creative control over the series to them, work began on the most popular and universally beloved sitcom of all time.\n\nWith I Love Lucy (1951), she and Desi promoted the 3-camera technique now the standard in filming sitcoms using 35mm film (the earliest known example of the 3-camera technique is the first Russian feature film, \"Defence of Sevastopol\" in 1911). Desi syndicated I Love Lucy. Lucille Ball was the first woman to own her own studio as the head of Desilu Productions.\n\nLucille Ball died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, age 77, of an acute aortic aneurysm on April 26, 1989 in Los Angeles, CA.\n\nSinging funny girl Kaye Ballard was born to perform...and perform she did, in a career spanning eight decades. With a strong comedy background and tunnel mouth to rival Martha Raye, the broad and bouncy trouper drew laughs on the musical stage, in night clubs, in recordings and on TV. As the archetypal over-emotive, knuckle-biting Italian wife and mama, the octogenarian tickled the funny bone with her earthy brand of comedy while alternately touching hearts in song.\n\nShe was born Catherine Gloria Balotta,in Cleveland, Ohio, the daughter of Italian parents, Lena (Nacarato) and Vincenzo/Vincent James Balotta. A deep desire to perform already struck by the time she was five years old. A typical class clown during her high school years, she began to compile a number of star impressions for her act. In her teens, she performed in a Cleveland USO stage production of \"Stage Door Canteen\" (1941), and soon set out on her own.\n\nEarning a job in 1943 touring with Spike Jones and His Orchestra for two years as his featured vocalist and flute/tuba player(!), Kaye eventually set up camp in New York and made her Broadway debut with the revue \"Three to Make Ready\" (1946). From there she showcased in the musicals \"Once in a Lifetime,\" \"Touch and Go\" (in London), \"Annie Get Your Gun\" and the burlesque show \"Top Banana\". During this time, she built up a strong song-and-comedy reputation for herself on the nightclub circuit, eventually playing the country's best cabarets/niteries including The Bon Soir, Persian Room and Blue Angel in New York, The Hungry i in San Francisco, and Mr. Kelly's in Chicago.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Kaye graced nearly every talk/variety show there was including those for Ed Sullivan, Jack Paar, Johnny Carson, Steve Allen, Perry Como, Red Skelton, Carol Burnett, Merv Griffin and Mike Douglas. Two of her classic TV roles were her ugly stepsister Portia (the other sister being fellow scene-stealer Alice Ghostley) in the Julie Andrews version of Cinderella (1957), and as one of The Mothers-In-Law (1967) (the other being fellow veteran Eve Arden) in the popular but short-lived sitcom produced by Desi Arnaz. Both showcases catered perfectly to Kaye's brash comedy instincts. She also pitched in as a meddling second banana for Doris Day for one season of the star's '70s TV show.\n\nOn stage Kaye had Broadway audiences rolling in the aisles with her Helen of Troy in the 1954 musical \"The Golden Apple,\" while introducing the classic song standard \"Lazy Afternoon.\" Other raves came in the form of \"Wonderful Town\" (1958), \"Carnival\" (1961) and Cole Porter Revisited\" (1965). On the flip side of the coin, she played a frumpy Lola Delaney in a badly misguided musical version of \"Come Back, Little Sheba\" (entitled \"Sheba\") in 1974, and also tried unsuccessfully to bring life to the beloved, indomitable Molly Goldberg radio/TV character in the Broadway musical \"Molly\" (1973); the show lasted a mere two months. Kaye was much more at home sinking her teeth into two of theater's most impregnable females: Mama Rose in \"Gypsy\" and Dolly Levi in \"Hello, Dolly!\"\n\nWith an out-stretched personality on par with Carol Channing and Ethel Merman, films never became a suitable medium. Although Kaye gave a standout debut performance in Kess und kokett (1957), starring Jane Powell, she was seldom seen after that. Her sprinkling of supporting roles included Madame P. und ihre Mädchen (1964) with Shelley Winters, Wo, bitte, geht's zur Front? (1970) starring Jerry Lewis, Ein ganz verrückter Freitag (1976) with young Jodie Foster, and, perhaps more notably, in Der Mörder lauert in der Sauna (1976) starring Rita Moreno and Jerry Stiller.\n\nIn later years, Kaye dominated the stage with feisty work in \"Nunsense\", \"The Pirates of Penzance\" (a Broadway replacement), \"High Spirits\" (as Madame Arcati), \"Funny Girl\" (as Mrs. Brice), \"The Full Monty\", and the female version of \"The Odd Couple\". The Rancho Mirage, California resident performed with the Palm Spring Follies show, and was out-and-about doing her one-woman cabaret show belting out the good old songs and retracing her burlesque-styled comedy roots. A survivor of breast cancer, the never-married veteran showed no signs of slowing down. She died in her Rancho Mirage home on January 21, 2019, aged 93.\n\nFontella Bass is an American R&B and soul singer and songwriter best known for her 1965 hit, \"Rescue Me.\"\n\nFontella Bass was born in St. Louis, Missouri. She was the daughter of gospel singer Martha Bass, who was a member of The Clara Ward Gospel Singers, and the older sister of R&B singer David Peaston. At an early age, Fontella showed great musical talent. At the age of five, she provided the piano accompaniment for her grandmother's singing at funeral services, she sang in her church's choir at six, and by the time she was nine, she had accompanied her mother on tours throughout the South and Southwest America. Bass continued touring with her mother until age of sixteen. As a teenager, Bass was attracted by more secular music. She began singing R&B songs at local contests and fairs while attending Soldan High School from which she graduated in 1958. At 17, she started her professional career working at the Showboat Club near Chain of Rocks, Missouri. With the support of Bob Lyons, the manager of St. Louis station, Bass recorded several songs released through Bobbin Records and produced by Ike Turner. She also recorded on Turner's labels Prann and Sonja. Two years later she quit the Milton band and moved to Chicago after a dispute with Oliver Sain. She auditioned for Chess Records, who immediately signed her as a recording artist. Her first works with the label were several duets with Bobby McClure. The song, \"Rescue Me\", shot up the charts in the fall and winter of 1965. After a month-long run at the top of the R&B charts, the song reached #4 on the US pop charts and #11 in the UK, and gave Chess its first million-selling single since Chuck Berry a decade earlier. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc.\n\nDuring May 2000 Bass received a star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame.\n\nMarjorie Bennett was an Australian actress, who spend most of her career working in the United Kingdom and the United States. She was born in York, Western Australia, a town that was an important stop for miners and travelers during the Australian gold rushes of the late 19th century. York is located 97 kilometers (60 miles) east of Perth, Western Australia's capital and largest city.\n\nBennett made her film debut in the film \"The Girl, Glory\" (1917). She had a few credited roles in silent films of the 1910s. such as \"Naughty, Naughty!\", \"Hugon, the Mighty\", and \"The Midnight Patrol\". None of them had a lasting impact\n\nShe resumed her film career in 1946, with the uncredited part of a shop assistant in the mystery film \"Dressed to Kill\". The film was another adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes series on film, and was the 14th and final entry in a film series which cast Basil Rathbone as Sherlock. Bennet started appearing regularly in minor film roles in the late 1940s, with films such as the black comedy \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947), the romantic comedy \"June Bride\" (1948), and the horror comedy \"Abbott and Costello Meet the Killer, Boris Karloff\" (1949).\n\nBy the 1950s, Bennett was quite established as a character actress in both film and television. She played the gruff landlady Mrs. Alsop in \"Limelight\" (1952), appeared in several more \"Abbot and Costello\" films, and had a recurring role in the television series \"Lassie\".\n\nIn the 1960s, Bennett had her first known role as a voice actress, as the character \"Duchess\" in the animated film \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" (1961). Duchess is one of the cows who offers shelter for the night and warm milk to the starving puppies, following their escape from villains Horace and Jasper.\n\nBennett continued regularly appearing in film throughout the 1960s. She had small roles in both \"Mary Poppins\" (1964) and \"My Fair Lady\" (1964). Her credits included psychological thriller \"The Night Walker\" (1964) and the horror film \"Billy the Kid Versus Dracula\" (1966), She also made several more television appearances.\n\nIn the 1970s, Bennett had a more substantial role in the mystery film \"Stacey\" (1973). She played aging heiress Florence Chambers, who hired private investigator Stacey Hanson to examine whether the surviving members of Florence's family were worthy to be included in her will. Chambers eventually learns that one of her would-be heirs is homosexual, a second one is having extramarital affairs, and a third one belongs to a Manson Family-style religious cult.\n\nBennett's other film roles in this decade included the crime thriller \"Charley Varrick\" (1973), the disaster film \"Airport 1975\" (1974), the black comedy \"I Wonder Who's Killing Her Now?\" (1975), and the crime comedy \"The North Avenue Irregulars\" (1979). In the television film \"Sherlock Holmes in New York\" (1976), Bennett played Mrs. Martha Hudson, Holmes' landlady. In the television film \"Better Late Than Never\" (1979), Bennett played Marjorie Crane, one of the residents of a nursing home who revolt against oppressive rules.\n\nIn 1980, Bennet finally retired, due to poor health. Her final television appearance was in an episode of the sitcom \"Barney Miller\" (1975-1982). Bennett died in 1982, and her ashes were interred in the Great Mausoleum's Columbarium of Dawn at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale.\n\nAccording to a 1977 article by \"The Los Angeles Times\", Bennett was one of the busiest of Hollywood's veteran character actresses. Her face was familiar to many Americans due to Bennett's numerous starring roles in television commercials.\n\nGenteel, ladylike British actress who was a much respected theatrical star in the 1920s and '30s, both in her own country and in the United States. Born in March 1900 in Hove, Sussex, she took to the stage at the age of seventeen as Ela Delahay in 'Charley's Aunt'. She played Peter Pan three years later and married the first of her actor husbands, Seymour Beard. By the mid '20s, Edna had become the toast of London for her performances in 'Fallen Angel' (with Tallulah Bankhead), and (in a role she made her own) as Teresa (Tessa) Sanger in 'The Constant Nymph' (opposite Noël Coward, and, subsequently, John Gielgud). With the part of Tessa she also enjoyed a successful run on Broadway in 1926, which was followed by another Margaret Kennedy play, 'Come With Me'. She married her co-star, Herbert Marshall, after divorcing Beard in 1928.\n\nEdna started in films as early as 1921 but made little headway until Michael and Mary (1931), for which she recreated her role from the London stage. She then co-starred again with husband Herbert Marshall in The Faithful Heart (1932), but neither of these films received much international exposure. Her only Hollywood film at this time was The Key (1934), which -- though directed by Michael Curtiz -- was decidedly too 'low-key' as far as critical plaudits or the box office was concerned. She had smallish parts in other British films, notably South Riding (1938) and the original version of Alfred Hitchcock's Der Mann, der zuviel wußte (1934) as the mother of kidnap victim Nova Pilbeam. Not until 1939 did a worthy motion picture role come her way in the shape of the forlorn wife whom violinist Leslie Howard deserts for Ingrid Bergman in Intermezzo (1939). Other worthy screen roles included her Catherine Apley in The Late George Apley (1947) and the housekeeper Martha in Ein Gespenst auf Freiersfüßen (1947), which the New York Times review of June 27 considered 'by far the best performance' in the picture. All in all, Edna's film appearances were few and far between, and only a handful adequately showcased her talents as an actress otherwise so abundantly evident from the body of her work in the theatre.\n\nFrom 1939 a U.S. resident and a nationalised citizen by the early 1950s, Edna continued her frequent triumphant returns to the stage. Her most celebrated performances on Broadway were in Terence Rattigan's 'The Browning Version' as downtrodden housewife Millie Crocker-Harris and in 'Harlequinade' (1949) (both co-starred 'Maurice Evans (I)' (q)) and as the titular character 'Jane' (1952) in a play adapted by S.N. Behrman from a W. Somerset Maugham short story. Brooks Atkinson described her performance as the timorous spinster as both 'comic' and 'forceful'. In her last significant role on stage she co-starred with Brian Aherne and Lynn Fontanne in the romantic comedy 'Quadrille' (1954-55), directed by Alfred Lunt and outfitted by Cecil Beaton, who also designed the costumes. Edna retired from acting in the early 1960s and died in a clinic in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1974.\n\nWith blonde hair, big blue eyes and a big smile, Joan Blondell was usually cast as the wisecracking working girl who was the lead's best friend.\n\nJoan was born Rose Blondell in Manhattan, New York, the daughter of Katie and Eddie Blondell, who were vaudeville performers. Her father was a Polish Jewish immigrant, and her mother was of Irish heritage. Joan was on the stage when she was three years old. For years, she toured the circuit with her parents and joined a stock company when she was 17. She made her New York debut with the Ziegfeld Follies and appeared in several Broadway productions.\n\nShe was starring with James Cagney on Broadway in \"Penny Arcade\" (1929) when Warner Brothers decided to film the play as Sinners' Holiday (1930). Both Cagney and Joan were given the leads, and the film was a success. She would be teamed with Cagney again in Der öffentliche Feind (1931) and Blonde Crazy (1931) among others. In The Office Wife (1930), she stole the scene when she was dressing for work. While Warner Brothers made Cagney a star, Joan never rose to that level. In gangster movies or musicals, her performances were good enough for second leads, but not first lead. In the 1930s, she made a career playing gold-diggers and happy-go-lucky girlfriends. She would be paired with Dick Powell in ten musicals during these years, and they were married for ten years. By 1939, Joan had left Warner Brothers to become an independent actress, but by then, the blonde role was being defined by actresses like Veronica Lake. Her work slowed greatly as she went into straight comedy or dramatic roles. Three of her better roles were in Ich suche meinen Mörder (1941), Cry 'Havoc' (1943), and Ein Baum wächst in Brooklyn (1945). By the 50s, Joan would garner an Academy Award nomination for Das Herz einer Mutter (1951), but her biggest career successes would be on the stage, including a musical version of \"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.\"\n\nIn 1957, Joan would again appear on the screen as a drunk in Lizzie (1957) and as mature companion to Jayne Mansfield in Sirene in blond (1957). While she would appear in a number of television shows during the 50s and 60s, she had the regular role of Winifred on The Real McCoys (1957) during the 1963 season. Her role in the drama Cincinnati Kid (1965) was well received, but most of her remaining films would be comedies such as Wasserloch Nr. 3 (1967) and Latigo (1971). Still in demand for TV, she was cast as Lottie on Here Come the Brides (1968) and as Peggy on Los Angeles 1937 (1971).\n\nA supremely gifted, versatile player who could reach dramatic depths, as exemplified in her weary-eyed, good-hearted waitress in Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), or comedy heights, as in her sadistic drill captain in Schütze Benjamin (1980), Eileen Brennan managed to transition from lovely Broadway singing ingénue to respected film and television character actress within a decade's time. Her Hollywood career was hustling and bustling at the time of her near-fatal car accident in 1982. With courage and spirit, she recovered from her extensive facial and leg injuries, and returned to performing... slower but wiser. On top of all this, the indomitable Eileen survived a bout of alcoholism and became recognized as a breast cancer survivor, having had a mastectomy in 1990. On camera, she still tosses out those trademark barbs to the delight of all her fans, as demonstrated by her more-recent recurring roles as the prying Mrs. Bink on Eine himmlische Familie (1996) and as Zandra, the disparaging acting coach, on Will & Grace (1998).\n\nShe was born with the highly unlikely marquee name of Verla Eileen Regina Brennan in Los Angeles, California, the child of Irish-Catholic parents Regina (\"Jeanne\") Manahan (or Menehan), a minor silent film player, and John Gerald Brennan, a doctor. Following grade school education, she attended Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. and appeared in plays with the Mask and Bauble Society during that time. She then went on to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. Her lovely soprano coupled with a flair for comedy was the winning combination that earned her the break of her budding career as the not-so-dainty title role in the off-Broadway, tongue-in-cheek operetta \"Little Mary Sunshine\". For this 1959 endeavor, Eileen not only won an Obie Award, but was among an esteemed group of eight other thespians who won the Theatre World Award that year for \"Promising New Personality\", including Warren Beatty, Jane Fonda, Carol Burnett and a very young Patty Duke.\n\nUnwilling to be pigeonholed as a singing comedienne, Eileen took on one of the most arduous and demanding legit roles a young actress could ask for when she portrayed Annie Sullivan role in a major touring production of \"The Miracle Worker\" in 1961. After proving her dramatic mettle, she returned willingly to the musical theatre fold and made a very beguiling Anna in a production of \"The King and I\" (1963). She took her first Broadway bow in another comic operetta, \"The Student Gypsy\" (1963). In the musical, which was an unofficial sequel to her \"Mary Sunshine\" hit, she played a similarly-styled Merry May Glockenspiel, but the show lasted only a couple of weeks. Infinitely more successful was her deft playing of Irene Malloy alongside Carol Channing's Dolly Levi Gallagher in the original Broadway production of \"Hello, Dolly!\" (1964). Eileen stayed with the role for about two years.\n\nBy this time, Hollywood beckoned and Eileen never looked back... or returned to sing on Broadway. After a support role in the film comedy Scheidung auf amerikanisch (1967) starring Debbie Reynolds and Dick Van Dyke, Eileen's talents were selected to be showcased on the irreverent variety show Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In (1967). But what seemed to be an ideal forum to show off her abilities didn't. Overshadowed by the wackier talents of Goldie Hawn, Ruth Buzzi and Jo Anne Worley, who became television comedy stars from this, Eileen seemed out of sync with the knockabout slapstick element. She left the cast before the show barely got off the ground. \"Laugh-In\" (1968-1973) went on to become a huge cult hit.\n\nIn retrospect, this disappointment proved to be a boon to Eileen's dramatic film career. Set in a dusty, barren town, she played up her hard looks and earned terrific reviews for her downbeat role of Genevieve, the careworn waitress, in Peter Bogdanovich's Die letzte Vorstellung (1971). As part of a superb ensemble cast, her hard-knocks vulnerability and earthy sensuality added authenticity to the dreary Texas surroundings. Following this, she scored great marks for her brothel madam/confidante in George Roy Hill's ragtime-era Oscar winner Der Clou (1973). Bogdanovich himself became a fan and used Eileen again and again in his subsequent films -- the ambitious but lackluster Daisy Miller (1974) and At Long Last Love (1975). At least, the latter movie allowed her to show off her singing voice. Her comedic instincts were on full display too in the all-star mystery spoofs Eine Leiche zum Dessert (1976) and Der Schmalspurschnüffler (1978) where she fared quite well playing take-it-on-the-chin dames.\n\nEileen hit the apex of her comic fame playing the spiky and spiteful drill captain who mercilessly taunts and torments tenderfoot Goldie Hawn in the huge box-office hit Schütze Benjamin (1980). She deservedly earned a \"best supporting actress\" Oscar nomination for her scene-stealing contribution and was given the chance to reprise the role on the television series that followed. Starring Lorna Patterson in the Hawn role, Private Benjamin (1981) was less successful in its adaptation to the smaller screen but Eileen was better than great and earned both Emmy and Golden Globe Awards in the process.\n\nDuring the show's run in 1982, Brennan had dinner one evening with good friend Goldie Hawn at a Los Angeles restaurant. They had already parted ways when Brennan was hit and critically injured by a car while crossing a street. Replaced in the television series (by \"Alice\" co-star Polly Holliday), her recovery and rehabilitation lasted three years, which included an addiction to painkillers. She returned to the screen in another amusing all-star comedy whodunit, Alle Mörder sind schon da (1985), in which she played one of the popular game board suspects, Mrs. Peacock. While looking weaker and less mobile, she showed she had lost none of the disarming causticity that made her a character star.\n\nForging ahead, Eileen went on to recreate her tough luck waitress character in Texasville (1990), the sequel to Die letzte Vorstellung (1971), and also appeared with Bette Midler in the overly mawkish Stella (1990). However, for the most part, she lent herself to playing eccentric crab apples in such lightweight fare as Rented Lips (1987), 900.000 $ zuviel (1988), Das Leben geht weiter (1997), Pants on Fire (1998), Jeepers Creepers - Es ist angerichtet (2001), Miss Undercover 2 (2005) and Naked Run (2011). She has also provided crotchety animated voices for series cartoons.\n\nEileen Brennan died at age 80 on July 28, 2013 at her Burbank, California home after a battle with bladder cancer. She is survived by her two sons, Patrick (formerly a basketball player, now an actor) and Sam (a singer), from her first and only marriage in the late 1960s to mid-1970s."
