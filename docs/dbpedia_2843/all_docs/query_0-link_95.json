        "text": "Minnie Pearl ORIGINAL NAME Sara Ophelia Colley Cannon\n\nCountry Music Commedienne. Born in Centerville, Tennessee, her had debutante balls and college in mind for their daughter, who’d been stage-struck with a love for vaudeville and drama since an early age. While she was indeed a college graduate, that didn’t stop her from sneaking into tent shows, which was against her parents wishes. While producing an amateur musical comedy in Baileyton, Alabama. around 1936, she met a young mountain woman from whom she based her famed and beloved character, Miss. Minnie Pearl, on. Her first performance onstage as Minnie Pearl was in 1939 in Aiken, South Carolina, but it was her introduction to the audience of the world famous Grand Ole Opry in 1940 at age 28 that catapulted her to stardom through live performances, radio and eventually television. For over 50 years, she entertained the music world with Minnie’s tales of her fictional hometown, Grinders Switch, Tennessee, stepping onstage proclaiming “Howdeee! I’m just so proud to be here” in her straw hat adorned with flowers and a $1.98 price tag. In reality, she was known as a gracious lady of refinement, hospitality and down to earth charm, living down the street from the Tennessee Governors Mansion and known as a competitive tennis player at the local country club. Married to Henry Cannon for over 50 years, she went on to continue her performances on the Opry, her home base, but also entertained throughout the world for charitable causes and won numerous awards for her numerous contributions to humanity. In 1975, she was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. In the early 1990s a series of strokes forced her to retire from the stage, but the industry and its fans did not forget their beloved Minnie Pearl. A breast cancer survivor and spokeswoman since 1985, her cancer later returned, claiming her life on March 4, 1996, at her Nashville Home. A museum erected outside of the Grand Ole Opry House in Nashville, Tennessee, tells the story of one of America’s most beloved and remembered entertainers.\n\nBio by: 602\n\nGrave Location\n\nFelton Jarvis\n\nMusic Producer. He is best known as Elvis Presley’s record producer from 1966 to 1977. Employed by RCA, he branched out on his own in 1970 to work exclusively for Elvis. The bonds between him and the performer were so close that when Felton Jarvis’s kidney failed in 1971, Elvis paid for his dialysis and an eventual kidney transplant. His strong work ethic and being able to bring the best out of any artist, he worked over the years with such renowned artists as Willie Nelson, Jim Ed Brown, Floyd Cramer, Lloyd Price, Fats Domino, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Carl Perkins and Ronnie McDowell. In 1980 he created the practice of overdubbing new rhythm tracks on top of previously recorded vocals, a process that is commonplace in music production today. The result was the remixing and re-recording of an album of Elvis Presley songs called ‘Guitar Man’. The albums title track ‘Guitar Man’, first released in 1967, used Elvis’ original vocals with new contemporary guitar work from Jerry Reed, who was also the guitar player for the 1967 release. The song was released to much success and in February 1981 the song went to #1 on the country charts. He died before he could see this achievement in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nBio by: Allcalmap\n\nGrave Location\n\nDonna Summer\n\nVocalist. Nicknamed the “Queen of Disco”, she was a major figure of the genre’s popularity as her songs echoed throughout nightclubs during the mid 1970s to early 1980s earning her multiple Grammy Awards and nominations. Born LaDonna Adrian Gaines, in Boston on New Year’s Eve 1948, her father was a butcher her mother was a school teacher, she loved to sing as a child and experienced her first opportunity to perform in front of an audience by accident when she filled in for an absentee singer at her church when she was ten years old. While attending high school, she participated in staged musicals and following graduation she landed a role in the production of “Hair” which was performing in Germany. She remained in Europe and appeared in several more musicals, among them “Godspell” and “Porgy and Bess”, prior to launching her recording career as a backup singer and in 1974, she released her first solo album “Lady of the Night”. This was followed with “Love to Love You Baby” (1975) and the sexually-provocative single of the same title earned her gold record status and a number 2 placing on the US Charts securing her as a commercial artist. During this period, she married German actor Helmut Sommer (married in 1973 and divorced two years later) and changed the spelling of her last name to Summer. “I Feel Love”, the single from her album “I Remember Yesterday” became her second gold record. What followed was a string of number one hits including gold and platinum records among them “McArthur Park” (1978), “Last Dance” (1978), “Heaven Knows” (1979), “Hot Stuff” (1979), “Bad Girls” (1979), “Dim All The Lights” (1979), “No More Tears” (1979, a duet with Barbra Streisand), “On the Radio” (1980), “The Wanderer” (1980) and “She Works Hard For the Money” (1983). Her final Top-Ten hit would be “This Time I Know It’s For Real” (1989). Success did not come without controversy for her and during the 1980s she allegedly made remarks about gays and AIDS which had a negative affect on her career. In addition, she revealed that she had long suffered from severe depression. She died following a year- long battle with lung cancer. She left an indelible impression on the music industry and it would be difficult to think of Disco without remembering Donna Summer. She was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2013.\n\nBio by: C.S.\n\nGrave Location\n\nTeddy Wilburn\n\nCountry Music Singer. He will be remembered, as half of one the most popular country music duos of all time; his brother Doyle was the other half. At the beginning their career on Christmas Eve 1937 with two older brothers, Leslie and Lester and a sister, Geraldine, the children were singing on street corners for tips. Their father Benjamin Wilburn, a disable World War I veteran, purchased from Sears Roebuck a guitar, mandolin and fiddle in hopes that his children might aid the family’s dire financial situation during the Great Depression by performing for the public. After six months of school and six months of singing for money, the Wilburn Family was discovered in 1940 by Roy Acuff who brought them to The Grand Ole Opry. The family became very popular on the Opry, but were forced to resign because of child labor laws. In the early 1940s Geraldine retired from the group when she married. In 1948 the four Wilburn boys were featured on KWKH’s “Louisiana Hayride.” After serving in the Korean Conflict, Doyle and Teddy, formed a duo joining the Opry in 1953. Their first hit, “Sparkling Brown Eyes,” which was performed with Webb Pierce, was on the national country music chart for 18 weeks in 1954 and reaching the #1 slot in the Top Five Hit. Seven more Top Ten Hits came in the 1950s, but it was in the 1960s when the brothers really hit their career peak with 18 charted hits, many of which became Top Ten Hits. They distinguished themselves with hits, “I’m So In Love With You,” “Go Away With Me,” “Mr. Love” and “Hey, Mr. Bluebird” (both with Ernest Tubb), “Which One Is to Blame,” “Somebody’s Back in Town,” “A Woman’s Intuition,” “Trouble’s Back in Town,” “Roll Muddy River,” “Tell Her So,” “It’s Another World,” “Somebody Before Me” and “Hurt Her Once for Me.” They hosted their own television show from 1963 to 1974. In 1957 they headed-up a very successful publishing company, Surefire Music, with their older brothers, and with steel guitarist, Don Helm, started a talent booking agency for up-and-coming singers. The Wilburn Brothers are credited for discovering Loretta Lynn, who performed and toured with the brothers. Also, they launched the singing careers of Patty Loveless, Sonny James, the Osborn Brothers and Jean Shepard. The brothers made their last, and their 30th, album together in 1978. The brothers were the only performer with a “Lifetime Recording Contract” with Decca Records. In 1967, the Wilburn Brothers were named Duet of the Music City News Awards, and in 1972 nominated for Vocal Group of the Year by the Country Music Association. The Wilburn Brothers performed regularly on the Grand Ole Opry until Doyle’s death in 1982 of lung cancer. Teddy continued as a solo artist on the Opry until his health declined then dying in 2003. In 2008, the Wilburn Brothers were inducted posthumously in the Arkansas Entertainers Hall of Fame.\n\nBio by: Linda Davis\n\nGrave Location\n\nDoyle Wilburn\n\nCountry Music Singer.

Born in Carlsbad, New Mexico, he was introduced to music at a young age when he spent some time at a logging camp. In 1958, he enlisted into the United States Air Force as a radar specialist, but discharged one year later to begin touring and playing music. His venture ultimately failed and he chose to return to the military, enlisting in the United States Army as an airborne paratrooper. Shortly after training, he was shipped to Vietnam. In May of 1965, he was wounded in the knee by a Vietnamese punji stick, sharp carved sticks often coated in poison. Though he never showed any signs of sickness, the wound itself became seriously infected. While he was recovering, he would record what would be his only number one hit song, “Ballad of the Green Berets,” which was released in early 1966. None of his other songs would ever come near the success of his first and Sadler turned to writing, authoring twenty-two books about a mythical character, “Casca”, the soldier who pierced Jesus Christ’s side with his spear during the crucifixion. Christ looked down at him and condemned him to be a soldier forever — the “eternal mercenary.” Near the end of his life, Sadler would move to Guatemala City, where on September 8, 1989, he was shot while riding in a taxi. The cause of the shooting remains unknown today. He died a few months later of the wound.\n\nBio by: G.Photographer\n\nGrave Location\n\nJim Hager\n\nMusician, Entertainer.

In 1969 they signed with Capitol Records and hit the country charts at #41 with “Gotta Get To Oklahoma (‘Cause California’s Gettin’ To Me)”. and also charted Merle Haggard’s “Silver Wings”, which was an on the B-Side of Haggard’s “Working Man Blues.” They recorded six albums, three for Capitol (“The Hagers” (1970), “Two Hagers are Better Than One” (1970), “Motherhood, Apple Pie and the Flag” (1971)), one for Barnaby Records (“Music on the Country Side” (1972)), and one for Elektra-Asylum Records (“The Hagers” (1974)). His television appearances include the TV-movie “Twin Detectives” with Lillian Gish, where he starred as Shep Thomas, and the original “The Bionic Woman” in which he played ‘Dier’ in the February 11, 1978 episode “Sanctuary Earth.” He and his brother continued to perform at comedy clubs from the 1980s until the death of his brother on May of 2008. He also appeared in TV commercials and with Florence Henderson in “Country Kitchen” on The Nashville Network (TNN). He died in his sleep at the age of 67.\n\nBio by: William Bjornstad\n\nGrave Location Section DD, Row 10, Site 14\n\nJohnson Kelly Duncan\n\nCivil War Confederate Brigadier General. He was born in York, Pennsylvania. He graduated 5th in the West Point class of 1849. He then served against the Seminoles in Florida, and explored possible railroad routes in the Northwest. He left the United States Army in 1855 to supervise government construction in New Orleans. By 1861 he considered himself a Louisianian and sided with the South when the Civil War began. His first assignment was as a Colonel of Artillery defending Forts Jackson and St. Philip below New Orleans. He was commissioned a Brigadier General on January 7, 1862, and had about 500 men and 80 guns at his disposal when Union Captain David G. Farragut brought up his fleet and mortar boats to attack the forts. On the first day of firing, April 18, 1862, Farragut’s mortars lobbed close to 3000 rounds at Fort Jackson in a 10-hour bombardment. He and his men held out until April 24. On that day Farragut successfully ran with his fleet past the fort’s guns, landing infantry behind the fort. He surrendered on April 28, and was taken prisoner. After being exchanged on August 27, 1862, he was given charge of an infantry brigade during the operations in Kentucky. He briefly commanded a division, and then became General Braxton Bragg’s staff chief in Tennessee but died of typhoid fever in Knoxville.\n\nBio by: Ugaalltheway\n\nGrave Location\n\nGrandpa Jones\n\nCountry Musician. He is best remembered as an old time country and gospel music singer banjo player who always wore his pants tucked inside his boots, whose animated performances were often characterized by his leg kicks and foot stomping, and as a charter cast member of the CBS television show “Hee Haw” that aired from 1969 to 1971 before a 20-year run in local syndication.\n\nRoamona Jones\n\nAmerican Musician, Actress and Composer. Born Ramona Riggins, she became known as Ramona Jones when she married her first husband “Grandpa” Jones in 1946. The couple who met while working at a Cincinnati radio station, moved to Nashville in 1947 and were married for 52 years until his death in 1998. Her father taught her how to play the fiddle and she taught herself how to play the guitar and mandolin. In high school, she competed in several talent contests and won them all. In 1947, she made her solo debut at the Grand Ole Opry, and in the mid-1950s, the couple regularly appeared on the Washington, D.C.-based TV series ‘Town and Country Time’. The couple performed on the long-running country-comedy show ‘Hee Haw’, starting with its debut in 1969, and would be regulars for 25 years; Grandpa would joke around and play the fool, while Ramona maintained a dignified presence on stage. Their most popular routine was when they would wear cowbells on their hands and feet to play familiar songs. She would go on to record numerous duets with her husband as well as a handful of solo singles and albums that spotlighted her fiddle work. Jones, who later married Reverend Eugene Gober, died of natural causes.\n\nBio by: Louis du Mort\n\nGrave Location\n\nEddie Rabbitt\n\nSinger, Songwriter. Born in Brooklyn, New York and raised in East Orange, New Jersey, he was one of the most innovative country artists of alltime. His recording career began in 1964 but he didn’t establish himself until he moved to Nashville in 1968. His earliest success was as a songwriter. In 1970 Elvis Presley recorded his song “Kentucky Rain” and in 1974 Ronnie Milsap had his first number one country single with the Eddie Rabbitt composition “Pure Love”. In 1975 he signed with Elektra Records and from 1976 to 1988 he had 33 consecutive Top 10 hits on the country charts, 16 of them reaching number 1. Many of those songs also crossed over onto the pop charts. Among his biggest crossover hits were “You And I”(a duet with Crystal Gayle), “Step By Step”, “Drivin’ My Life Away” (from the movie “Roadie” starring Meat Loaf), and “I Love A Rainy Night” which reached number 1 on both the pop and country charts. His biggest success on the country charts came in 1979 with the title song from the Clint Eastwood movie “Every Which Way But Loose”. He continued recording sporadically in the 1990’s but never matched his earlier success. In 1997 he was diagnosed with lung cancer and he died the following year in Nashville. His album “From The Heart” was issued posthumously.\n\nBio by: Decal\n\nGrave Location\n\nDeFord Bailey\n\nMusician and Country Music Hall of Fame Member. A grandson of slaves, he was not just the first African American to appear on the Grand Ole Opry, he was the first star to appear. The show was originally named the WSM Barn Dance, but when it became a part of the NBC network in 1927 it was renamed The Grand Ole Opry and George D Hay, the announcer, introduced one of the Barn Dance’s most frequent and popular performers as the “Harmonica Wizard” – DeFord Bailey. Bailey did his classic train song, “The Pan American Blues.” The harmonica was his favorite instrument, but he was equally adept with the banjo, guitar, mandolin, and could play the fiddle, but with less skill. He wanted to perform professionally and in 1925 radio station WDAD came to Nashville and asked him to perform. A month later WSM came into being and many WDAD regulars played on both. He remained on the Grand Ole Opry from 1927 to 1941 when they fired him. There were many reasons given for the firing. Some said it was racism. Some said he played the same songs over and over and refused to learn new material. Some say it was because a license conflict with his recording company prevented him from playing his best music on the air. For whatever the reason, he was out of the business and spent 30 years shining shoes at his shop on Twelfth Avenue, South in Nashville. His career was brought to mind again in the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and he made an appearance on a local syndicated show called “Night Train.” He made an appearance on the Opry’s old timers show at the old Ryman Auditorium in 1974 and celebrated his 75th birthday by appearing at the new Grand Ole Opry House and playing some of his old songs. He appeared for the last time on the Opry on April 3, 1982. Almost exactly 3 months later he passed away. In 2005, PBS broadcast a documentary called “DeFord Bailey: A Legend Lost.” On November 15, 2005, he joined two other country music legends, Glenn Campbell and Alabama in the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nBio by: Tom Todd\n\nGrave Location\n\nJames Knox Polk\n\n11th United States President. He was born on a 250-acre farm in Pineville, North Carolina moving to Tennessee at age 11. After a mere two years of formal education James Knox Polk returned to North Carolina to become an honor student at the University of North Carolina. Upon graduation, he studied law in Nashville and then established a law practice in Columbia. During his first year in the Tennessee Legislature, he was introduced to Sarah Childress by Andrew Jackson. A courtship ensued culminating in marriage. His Congressional career lasted fourteen years including two terms as Speaker of the House. Polk returned home and successfully ran for governor of Tennessee. After a two year term he failed to be reelected. Shrewdly, he did not quit politics. His opportunity to revive his career came at the Democratic convention where he became a compromise candidate and when on to win the White House. James and Sarah arrived in Washington for the inauguration by boat and Sarah set the stage for an austere administration. There was to be no dancing, singing, or alcohol permitted in the Polk White House and the Sabbath would be strictly observed. However, his administration froth with achievement. He expanded the borders of the United States to the Pacific Ocean while adding three states to the Union, started the Naval Academy, began construction of the Washington Monument and issued the first postage stamp while proclaiming a uniform standard for all the states; elections would be held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. True to his campaign pledge, he served only a four year term. He and Sarah returned to Tennessee. The couple embarked on an extensive tour of the southern states. At the end of the trip, he moved into his recently purchased estate in Nashville, “Polk Place.” Just four months after leaving the White House, James Polk, the youngest president in history was dead at the age of 53. He was buried at the Nashville City Cemetery and later reinterred on the lawn of his home “Polk Place” under a monument designed by architect William Strickland. His widow, Sarah endured the longest widowhood of any first lady and was in her 43rd year when death took her at the mansion. She was buried beside her husband at age 87. She had allowed the residence and grounds to become a rundown eyesore. Two years after her death it was demolished and both bodies and the monument were relocated to the grounds of the State Capitol. Polk’s greatest legacy was already coming true at the time of his death. America was being forged into a land spanning from sea to shining sea. Pioneers were rushing west to settle or search for gold in California. His birthplace in Pineville is not authentic but a reconstruction on land from the farm of his birth resulted in a few embellished period cabins and a stone historic monument. The Ancestral Home in Columbia, Tennessee was constructed by the Presidents father. It is the only surviving residence of where Polk lived. Here he practiced law and began his political career. The Home displays original items from his years in Tennessee and Washington including furniture paintings and White House china. In the court yard is the cast iron fountain from the demolished Polk mansion in downtown Nashville. It is all that remains of the mansion where the President died and was buried and where Mrs Polk lived until her death and was buried.\n\nBio by: Donald Greyfield\n\nGrave Location\n\nSamuel Morgan\n\n(November 8, 1798 – June 10, 1880), was an American businessman, builder, and manufacturer, known as “The Merchant Prince of Nashville.”\n\nMorgan moved to Nashville in January 1833, where he became involved in dry goods and banking. He was at once a merchant, architect and builder. His firm, Morgan and Company, was one of the largest wholesale importers of dry goods and a manufacturer of clothing; the business was sufficiently sound and respected to be permitted to issue script money during the Panic of January 30, 1844. He was appointed to the new commission charged with planning a new State Capitol for Tennessee, becoming its president in 1854, Morgan was instrumental in choosing William Strickland of Philadelphia as the architect of this monumental structure.\n\nIn 1856 his firm built the Italianate style Morgan-Reeves Building at 208-210 Public Square; the building survived until 1975. (Building photos and details[permanent dead link]—external link)\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Morgan engaged in manufacturing munitions for the Confederates until Nashville’s occupation by Union forces. He was also a Confederate official, serving as chairman of the Central Bureau of Military Supplies in Nashville during the War. Morgan had two sons killed during the war serving in the Confederate States Army. His nephew, Brig. Gen. John Hunt Morgan of Alabama, served with the Confederate cavalry and gained fame as the leader of Morgan’s Raiders. He was killed in 1864.\n\nGrave Location\n\nDavid “Stringbean” Akeman\n\nComedian, Country Musician. One of the top musical stars of Nashville, Tennessee’ Grand Old Opry during his career, he is best known for being one of the original members the comedy and country music television variety show “Hee Haw”, which he starred in from 1969 until his murder in 1973. He and his wife were killed by burglars, who had heard rumors about them storing cash in his house, and laid in wait until the Akemans arrived home from the Ryman Auditorium (where the Grand Ole Opry was located at the time). The Akemans were known not to trust banks, and “Stringbean” always carried several thousand dollars at a time in his overalls, and he frequently showed it to friends and associates. After killing the Akemans, burglars packed several valuable items, including several firearms, in a pillowcase. The morning after, the Akemans’ friend and neighbor, Louis Marshall “Grandpa” Jones, discovered the bodies, alerted police, and testified in court, positively identifying one of the stolen pistols as one he (Jones) gave “Stringbean” as a present. In 1996, someone discovered $20,000 of the Akeman’s cash hidden above the fireplace. (The cash had long since rotted.)\n\nBio by: Steve Williams\n\nGrave Location Music Row 10-D-3\n\nRandy Hughes\n\nCountry Musician. Born Ramsey Dorris Hughes, he was called “Randy” by friends and family. He was a highly respected recording session guitarist playing for several country music artists including Cowboy Copas and at times, singing with groups. He married Cowboy Copas’ daughter, Kathy. After deciding that he could do more than just play a guitar in a country band, he made a career change to managing country artist’s careers. In 1959, Patsy Cline became one of his clients. After taking basic flying lessons, he purchased a yellow Piper PA-24 Comanche to fly his clients from one show to another. He reasoned that purchasing the plane would be to his client’s advantage; they would arrive faster for their performances, thus not have to depend on slower cars for transportation. On March 3, 1963, several country music stars including Patsy Cline, Cowboy Copas, and Hawkshaw Hawkins had performed for three benefit concerts at the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, Kansas City, Kansas. After finishing the 8 PM show, many of the artists and crew spent the night in town planning to return to their homes the next morning including Hughes, but his flight plans were changed as by daylight the area was fogged-in. The following morning, the weather was not much better and everyone’s impatience had heightened; this time using a plane for transportation was proving to be a disadvantage. After deciding who was going by car, his plane was loaded with Patsy Cline, his father-in-law Cowboy Copas, and Hawshaw Hawkins. Although he was not trained to fly in pouring rain with instruments, he continued the flight as planned even after receiving bad weather advisories. He had phoned his wife in Tennessee learning that “the storm had passed”. His flight plan was to hop from one small airport to another small airport, while waiting for storms to clear the area before taking off for the next short haul. Landing about 4:30 PM, the plane made it as far as Dyersburg, Tenn., northeast of Memphis and just east of Arkansas. The group had the chance to stay free overnight at the local motel there but declined the offer even with reports of bad weather ahead. In heavy rain and early evening darkness, the plane crashed on March 5, 1963. Patsy Cline’s recovered wristwatch had stopped at 6:20 PM. The location of the crash was just west of Camden, Tennessee in a hollow along a ridge line in a heavily wooded area known as Fatty Bottom, near a fire tower off Mule Barn Road in Sandy Point, about 5 miles west of the Tennessee River. The crash site was located the next morning by searchers. All aboard the plane had died instantly. Being a close-knit family, the entire country music industry was greatly impacted by this incident. Hughes and country singer Ferlin Husky had started a publishing company. After Hughes death, Husky insisted that Kathy Copas Hughes, who had no publishing experience, retain half the company. That insistence meant she kept half the proceeds from Husky’s country and gospel smash hit “On the Wings of a Dove”. Hughes’ widow used that money for college tuition for herself and two sons. Country singer Jack Anglin, who was killed in an auto accident on the way to Patsy Cline’s funeral; Hawkshaw Hawkins; and Cowboy Copas were all buried within days of Hughes in the same cemetery.\n\nBio by: Linda Davis\n\nGrave Location\n\nAndrew Jackson\n\n7th United States President. When he threw his hat in the ring and decided to run for the presidency, Andrew Jackson the “Hero of New Orleans” was the most popular man in the country and even received a “favorite son” endorsement from Tennessee delegates. Detractors had a field day after his marriage to Rachel Donelson seizing on a marriage technicality to tarnish both their images. He was born to poverty stricken Scottish-Irish immigrants literally on the border between North and South Carolina. His father died in a logging accident before his birth and his mother raised the family alone. He joined the Continental Army as a courier at age thirteen. Andrew was taken prisoner by the British. Because of his ill treatment, Jackson harbored a bitter resentment towards the British until his death. With his mother and both brothers deceased, Andrew was a complete orphan at the age of fourteen. He was apprenticed to a saddle maker. Still a young man, he went to the territory of Tennessee achieving prominence as a lawyer, became a judge and was the owner of a moderate sized plantation. When Tennessee became a state, he became a member of the US House of Representatives, then elected Senator. He sought and won the position of Major General of the Tennessee militia. He led troops against the Indians in both the Creek War and the First Seminole War. During the War of 1812, he gave the Americans a much needed victory at New Orleans giving the country a moral boost just after Washington was burned by the British. To win the presidency, Jackson defeated Adams for his first term and then defeated Clay to claim a second term. Rachel Jackson died a few weeks before her husband’s inauguration and Jackson blamed her early death on stress caused by detractors zeroing in on their supposed immorality of his marriage. The new President believed in a strong presidency and a strong Union. This belief brought him into open opposition with Southern legislators. In order to clear millions of acres of land from Indians, he signed the Indian Removal Act which gave them land west of the Mississippi in exchange for land east of the river. During his administration Arkansas and Michigan were admitted to the Union. He survived an assassination attempt fending off his attacker with his cane. After leaving the Whitehouse, he retired to his home near Nashville which he and Rachel had named The Hermitage. From a small cabin it was expanded, remodeled and rebuilt into a spacious plantation house. Jackson’s health deteriorated acerbated by a bullet lodged near his heart received in a duel but never removed. He died at the Hermitage reaching the age of 77. Thousands attended his funeral. Burial was beside Rachel in a tomb he had designed and constructed. Visiting her grave each evening was one of Jackson’s daily rituals in his declining years. Andrew and Rachel Jackson did not have any children but adopted a nephew of Rachel and gave him the name of Andrew Jackson, Jr. The plantation was willed to him but his debts forced the sale of the property to the State of Tennessee. The Hermitage today is open to the public, restored and is an historic site. The two disputed birthplaces: The Andrew Jackson State Park, Lancaster South Carolina: The 360 acre park has a historic marker, also a bronze sculpture recognizing the spot. Waxhaws, North Carolina: Located just across the state border from the Andrew Jackson State Park has a restored house and a historic marker. Washington DC has a huge bronze equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson cast from a bronze cannon captured in his last campaign against the Spanish. It has graced Lafayette Park since 1853.\n\nBio by: Donald Greyfield\n\nGrave Location"
