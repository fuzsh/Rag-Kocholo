        "text": "THOMAS HARRIS II\n\nThomas Harris (II) [6] was the son of Thomas and Elizabeth Leatherland Harris.\n\nHe was born before 1941 in Providence Co., Rhode Island. Thomas married Elnathan Tew on 3 Nov 1664 in Providence. [9,10] He died 27 Feb 1711 in Providence. [7,8]\n\nElnathan was born in Newport, Rhode Island , on 15 October 1644, daughter of Richard and Mary (Clarke) Tew. She died on 11 January 1718 in her 77th year and was buried in St. Peters churchyard in Johnston, R.I., [17] and was then moved to the North Burial Ground in Providence.\n\nDuring the next twenty two years there were nine children born to the family:\n\n1. Thomas was born 19 Oct 1665 and died 1 Sep 1741. [8]\n\n2. Richard was born 14 Nov 1668 and died 1750.\n\n3. Nicholas was born 5 Apr 1671 and died 27 March 1746.\n\n4. William was born 11 May 1673 and died 14 Jan 1726.\n\n5. Henry was born 10 Nov 1675 and died 29 Mar 1727.\n\n6. Amity was born 10 Dec 1677 and died 5 Jun 1749.\n\n7. Job was born 11 Jan 1682 and died Jan 1689.\n\n8. Elnathan was born about 1684 and died 27 July 1749.\n\n9. Mary was born about 1687 and died 13 Sep 1765. [4] [18]\n\nProvidence Plantation was founded 1636-1638 by Roger Williams who had bought the land from the Narragansett tribe. His father Thomas and Uncle William had been among the original twelve to sign a compact to establish the local government of the new settlement. This new type of town government was under the leadership of Roger Williams. Times were not easy. There were troubles with the Indians and the need for internal security. The neighboring orthodox colonies considered Rhode Island a sanctuary for heretics (many residents had been banished by Massachusetts) and treated then with scant respect. [1]\n\nThere were problems between the settlers too. Thomas’s Uncle William Harris had a falling out with Roger Williams the political and religious leader of Providence Plantation. William had removed to the “Pawtuxet Purchase” in 1638 which bordered Providence, and there was a dispute over jurisdiction and title which lasted for forty years. [2] Quarrels, fights, accusations, arrests, imprisonment were all a part of the atmosphere of the early settlement. Being remote from England and the civilized world also made it difficult on the settlers. Supplies, food, and shelter were all difficult to acquire without much tribulation.\n\nThomas and his siblings lived upward into areas surrounding the Mohassuck River in North Smithfield, Lincon and Limerock areas 7 miles northwest of his father's original settlement in the center of Providence on North Towne Street. Vast acres of land were aquired by the Harris through the years. Thomas’s father was a surveyor for Providence and numerous records show purchase and transfer of parcels to the expanding members of the Harris families. In 1661, he laid out sixty acres at Pangachange Hill and twenty-five more acres to the south which were designated as a lot for him. [3]\n\nThomas, lived the life style of the typical Rhode Island farmer of the time. Each was consistently referred to as a yeoman (farmer) in written records of the time. His familiy attended local Baptist churches, and as custom dictated associated principally with those of like social and religious sensibilities. That their children could read and write is problematic. \"The widespread dislike for learning produced a general disinterest in education in that day being largely centered in scholarly debates about dogma. Since neither the Quakers nor Baptists, the two predominant groups in the colony after 1676, were interested in scholarly debates... few books were published. No one thought it necessary to found a college, and few sent their sons to Harvard or Yale. The absence of a professional clergy and an established church was also largely responsible for the absence of a public school system. The emphasis upon a spirit-filled, rather than head-stored, clergy left in the colony's intellectual and cultural life a vacuum that was not filled until the Anglicans and ngregationalists established churches.\" [14]\n\nThomas always lived his entire life in Providence, Rhode Island. February 19, 1665 he had Lot a in a division of lands. In 167I-79, 1680-81-82-85,1691-94-97,1702-06-07-08 and 1710, he was deputy of the general court; and in 1684-85-86 member of town council. June 1, 1679, he was taxed eight pounds nine pence and September 1, 1687. fourteen shillings, nine pence. June 21, 1708, he made his will which was proved April 16, 1711. The executors being his wife Elnathan and his son Henry. [5]\n\nAt the time of his death on February 27, 1711; he left a large estate to his Family which included about 640 acres among other holdings.\n\nExample of early home in Providence area [16]\n\nAbstract of Will:\n\nTo eldest son Thomas, 140 acres where he dwells (except 6 acres that Henry is to have, and a small orchard to Henry), and other land. To son Richard 60 acres where he dwells and right of common, &c, and a third of orchard. To son Nicholas, land where he dwells, 150 acres, &c, and a third of orchard.
