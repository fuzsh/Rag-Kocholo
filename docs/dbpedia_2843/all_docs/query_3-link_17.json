        "text": "The Old South Cemetery measures at least 200’ wide and wider in some points, and extends 400’ to 500’ from the far edge of the South Green, to the bank overlooking the Ipswich River. The cemetery was first used in 1756. Regular burials here started about 1784, and it was used until about 1939, with some recent additions. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) surveyed this cemetery and the Old North Burying ground in 1935 and created about 900 records. The stones are quite old and beautiful, but many have been severely eroded, and there are also many tombs along one of the main avenues and many family plots. The front of the ground is bordered by an old iron fence. This cemetery is not far from the Ipswich Museum and the Whipple House, an extraordinary example of First Period architecture.\n\nDownload this page with image, maps and list as a PDF document\n\nDownload Index of WPA Records, provided by Bruce Laing PDF\n\nDownload WPA grid map\n\nView a slideshow of tombstones at the Old South Burying Ground (photos by New England Oddities)\n\nView gravestones at the Old South Burying Ground on the Findagrave site.\n\nTake a virtual tour of the Old South Cemetery\n\nView a gallery of gravestones at the Old South Cemetery\n\nThe following names, descriptions, and photos are from the FindaGrave site.
