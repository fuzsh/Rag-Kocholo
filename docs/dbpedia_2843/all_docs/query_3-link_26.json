        "text": "Abstract\n\nThis treatise reviews documentation sources and historical literature on the first and last sons of Captain John Whipple of Providence Rhode Island, and their immediate descendants. The western movement across the American frontier by later representative descendants of each chronicles the continued influence of these families on subsequent generations. This is the third in a series of articles included in a book presently being written by the authors on the life of Captain John Whipple and his descendants.\n\n(See: The Louquisset Brothers and Yeomen and Princes for previous articles). This is a work in progress. Comments, additions, and documented corrections are solicited. Send to brcgenealogy@yahoo.com and/or charles@whipple.net . The next article in the series will feature Captain John and Sarah Whipple.\n\nThe Children of Captain John and Sarah Whipple\n\nAs discussed in previous articles and continued herein, five of Captain John and Sarah Whipple's eight sons established homes on inherited \"north woods\" properties that had not as yet experienced the civilizing effect of the European ax and plow. The property of each was located to the north or northwest of Providence, a small settlement of between 200 to 300 persons, along the four principle rivers that flow past it into the Narragansset Bay. In the 1670s, Eleazer and William had to travel eight miles or so up the meandering Moshassuck River to its headwaters to establish farms at what became the Limerock Settlement. Samuel received land at that same location, although it appears that he lived and died nearer in to Providence. Specifically, at the time of his death, he resided in the former Roger Mowrey house located on the Pawtucket Road about one-and-one half miles north of the freshwater spring that had, only a few years before, compelled The Reverend Roger Williams to stake a claim to that parcel of untouched wilderness. Samuel's farm was located on the banks of the Moshassuck River next to the newly established town graveyard. Early on, David relocated from his Moshassuck farm, six miles north of Providence, to the Blackstone River, approximately two miles to the east. Benjamin established a home next to the Woonasquatucket River, roughly three miles to the north and west of Town Street. Jonathan's property, slightly more than two miles to the northwest of his birthplace, was beside the slow-moving waters of the West River. John Junior and Joseph lived and died within the environs of Town Street, as did their sisters. Sarah married the son of the village miller, Mary a son of the local Baptist minister. Abigail first married the son of the local lime manufacturer, who owned the first operation of its kind in the colonies. She then married into a family soon to become politically prominent. The approximate locations of the residences of most second generation Whipples are known, with those of Samuel, Eleazer, and Jonathan yet viewable in photographic form.\n\nEleazer and William, as well as their immediate descendants, realized considerable financial success by developing the rich deposits of limestone on their farms. David and his family immediately became involved in the newly developing and financially profitable boat-building trade on the Blackstone River. Along with his agricultural and lumber businesses, Jonathan owned a wharf on the salt-water side of Providence, as did John Junior, Benjamin, Samuel, and Joseph, they becoming part of Providence's slowly developing import/ export business. This latter enterprise, in which Joseph particularly excelled, allowed him to become one of the wealthiest men in Providence, and was the springboard to high political office at the colony's capitol in Newport. It was John Junior who took up the mantle of public service that his father had modeled for his children. In addition to serving in the paid position of town clerk for many years, as well as representative to the colony's General Assembly at Newport, he was a successful attorney and innkeeper. Joseph, Eleazer, and Samuel also served as representatives at Newport, as did Captain John's sons-in-law. As far as it is known, the single occasion where the names of John and his children (daughters through their husband's names) appear on the same document was a 29 October 1684 tax list of 109 taxpayers. John, John Junior, Samuel, Eleazer, and Epenetus Olney paid 5 shillings, the rest about 1 shilling each.[ 1 ]\n\nIt is generally agreed that the Whipples moved to Providence from Dorchester, Massachusetts in order to enjoy religious freedom. Unquestionably, they shared in the unique religious diversity of their new community, and as such, became part of a privileged few on earth to enjoy such freedom at that time. Of the 11 children, Joseph became a communicant in the Anglican Church. John Junior, it is believed, was in later life a member of the Society of Friends, as were his sisters, Sarah and Abigail, and his brother Samuel. The remaining children likely were Baptist. The religious preference of Captain John and Sarah Whipple though unknown had to have been Baptist, Quaker, or irreligious.\n\nAs exemplified in the Whipple family, most of the settlement's citizens were members of the Baptist or Quaker communions, and due to this the absence of a central parish church, with its ubiquitous graveyard, was part of their everyday experience. With the added religious bias against the use of grave markers, the nativity and necrology dates of most of the colony's earliest residents likely will not be retrieved. \"Whether through poverty or want of skill, or the early diffusion of Quaker ideas, no inscriptions were set over the earlier graves. This primitive custom of sepulture outlasted three generations.\"[ 2 ] Because of the separation of church and state, churches of several denominations were built throughout Rhode Island. However, each was small and none had a cemetery because families, following a separatist tradition, buried their dead in family plots. \"These small family cemeteries are private burial grounds that belong to and are the responsibility of the descendants. Most of them were reserved out of the deed when the farm was sold with words like 'I reserve my family burial ground 4 rods by 4 rods with rights of pass and repass forever.' Most are abandoned, overgrown, and generally decaying.\"[ 3 ]\n\nDue to the above circumstances, the graves of only three of the 11 Whipple children are yet viewable: Samuel and Joseph in the North Burial Ground, and Eleazer in his family burial plot at Limerock.[ 4 ] The headstones of William and family were moved from their family plot at Limerock and taken to the Moshassuck Cemetery about three miles to the southeast, where a common monument now stands in their stead. The headstones of John Junior and Jonathan, as well as their sisters, the subjects of this present study, long have since disappeared or never were made. Even then, the descendants of Captain John and Sarah Whipple are fortunate that their gravestones and those of three of their children were preserved for future generations.\n\nJohn Whipple Junior: Lawyer and Innkeeper\n\nJohn Whipple Junior, the oldest child of Captain John, was christened at Dorchester, Massachusetts, 1 November 1641, and died at Providence Rhode Island, 15 December 1700.[ 5 ] He married Mary Olney, the daughter of Thomas Olney and Marie Ashton, at Providence, Rhode Island, 4 December 1663, she dying in 1676. To this couple three children were born:[ 6 ]\n\nMary Whipple (4 Mar 1664/5 - 12 Mar 1739/40)\n\nJohn Whipple (2 Oct 1666 - AFT Jan 1723/24)\n\nElnathan Whipple (2 Jan 1675/76 - AFT Aug 1753)\n\nFollowing the death of his first wife, John married Rebecca Brown Scott, the widow of John Scott and daughter of John Brown of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, at Providence, Rhode Island, 15 April 1678. To this union two children were born:\n\nDeliverance Whipple (11 Feb 1678/9 - 5 Jan 1765)\n\nDorothy Whipple (1680 - 19 Sep 1728)\n\n\"Rebecca's first husband, John Scott, was said to have been killed by an Indian while standing in the doorway of his own house at Pawtucket Ferry in 1677 ... It appears that the entire Quaker Moshassuck settlement went to Newport during that struggle (King Philip's War) and that John Scott and his family returned too soon for safety. The widow remained in Providence ... and there married ... John Whipple, Jr., who was one of the prominent men in Providence colony, and had held nearly every office in town, from constable to town clerk and moderator of the Town Meeting ... The youngest child of John and Rebecca Scott, who was about six years old when his father died, lived with his mother in John Whipple's house. He became Major Silvanus Scott, and early in life entered into the politics of the town, becoming nearly as prominent in his generation as his stepfather had been before him. (Silvanus was given part of the land in the Louquisset that John Whipple Junior inherited from his father in 1663. Silvanus subsequently sold the land to David Whipple, his stepfather's brother.) He married, about 1692, Joanna, daughter of Joseph and Esther Ballard Jenckes. His wife was a sister of Governor Jenckes so noted ... \"[ 7 ] Silvanus'daughter, Sarah, married Governor Stephen Hopkins in 1726.[ 8 ] As seen later, the second wife of Governor Hopkins was the granddaughter of Sarah Whipple Smith, John Junior's sister. John, the brother of Silvanus, who likewise grew up in the Whipple home, married a daughter of Edward Wanton. This Wanton family furnished five colonial governors, and is known as the \"Fighting Quakers.\" John Scott's father, Richard, was \"the first convert in Providence ... of George Fox, (founder of the Quaker religion) and the persistent enemy of Williams. It is singular that the bitterest foes of Williams, and who gave him annoyance equal to any which he had experienced from the elders of 'the bay' were those in closest contact (they lived next door) with him.\"[ 9 ] The fact that Quakers seldom married outside the faith gives credence to the assertion that John Junior may have been a member of the Society of Friends at that time.\n\nIn 1635, Thomas Olney, the father of John Junior's first wife, a resident of St. Albans, Old England, came to Salem, Massachusetts where he early became associated with those who accepted the views of The Reverend Roger Williams, and on 12 March 1638, was banished from the colony with a number of others. On 8 October 1638, he was one of the twelve men to whom Williams deeded equal shares with himself in the Providence Plantations. He thus became one of the \"Original Thirteen Proprietors of Providence.\"[ 10 ] In 1652, he, along with a minority of members, separated from the First Baptist Church in Providence in order to establish his own church that, among other ideas, continued to teach the doctrine of predestination. His church lasted for some 70 years.[ 11 ] His son, Thomas Junior, was minister there for several years. One wonders whether members of the John Whipple family might not have been communicants in this church instead of the larger and better-known congregation.\n\nThe John Whipple Junior and Mary Whipple-Olney Inns\n\nThe two families were undoubtedly close, even to the point of witnessing marriages between two of their children. Mary, Captain John and Sarah's second daughter, married Thomas Olney's second son, Epenetus, on 9 March 1665. Epenetus and John Junior owned competing taverns in Providence, \"Taverns continued to be places of great resort especially before the building of the county court house in 1729. Those of Whipple and Epenetus Olney were famous ... \"[ 12 ] It would seem that John Junior's inn was the more luxurious of the two. \"Even at this early date a competitor had entered the field, and a rival hostelry now offered the town-meeting not house-room only, but 'fire roome and fireing and Candle at all their Towne Meetings and Council meeteings,' nor does it admit of doubt that the inner man might also be warmed and comforted should the necessity arise. This enterprising competitor was no other than John Whipple Junior. John Junior kept a tavern for many years on Mill Street and a brother, Joseph, was also at one time a licensed innkeeper within the town of Providence.\"[ 13 ] It is thus seen that at least three of Captain John Whipple's children (John Junior, Joseph, and Mary Whipple-Olney) were actively involved in that business for many years.\n\nJohn Junior started his tavern by special request of the town, because its citizens were not adequately being provided for,[ 14 ] three years before his father's death. Apparently John Senior's tavern, established in 1674,[ 15 ] no longer operated and likely had not for several years. This is understandable, considering the devastation of the Indian war of 1675-76 and the long years of recovery needed to rebuild and repopulate the town. When John Senior died in 1685, \"he left a large property in land, but the means at his disposal 'for entertainment of strangers' ... was scanty. He had one feather bed, seven pewter platters, five pewter porringers, three old spoons, and (three chairs and a decayed old warming pan) ...\"[ 16 ] According to testimony given to the town council by John Junior involving his brother Samuel's niece, Howlong Harris, Captain John Whipple was apparently living with him by the year 1681.[ 17 ] Most of what has been penned about the so-called \"prominent\" Captain John Whipple Inn, located at 369 North Main Street, should have been attributed to his children's taverns--John Junior's in particular, built approximately two blocks to the north on Mill Street. It is known that John III who inherited this tavern in the year 1700 continued as its owner for several years. The second brother to establish an inn, in 1710, was Joseph: \" ... Colonel Joseph Whipple, who at one time kept an inn on Mill Street, but is better known of local fame as a well-to-do merchant, and colonel of the militia raised on the mainland in 1719.[ 18 ]\n\nThe Olney tavern's address was just around the corner from Mill Street on Olney Lane. Mill Street led northward from Town Street across from the Whipple property to the gristmill located on the falls of the Moshassuck River. Sarah Whipple, Captain John's oldest daughter, and her husband John Smith Junior owned this mill. Sarah Whipple-Smith and her husband also owned the nearby sawmill: \"The Proprietors granted to John Smith, the son of the old miller ... the land next south of the gristmill for a sawmill ... The inns and the 'gaol [jail] house' were ... not far away, and the mill was thus the centre of the old agricultural town.\"[ 19 ]\n\n\"Throughout the colonial times, the inns of Olney ... and of Whipple, while it lasted, were the centers of any unusual excitement, and the principal scenes of public events. Thus, 23d September 1696, the Town Meeting reciting an act establishing an annual fair in Providence, appointed places for setting it up. 'Stalls for the goods shall be in the highway against William Turpin's land, and in the highway at Epenetus Olneys house, near the stocks,' (paid for by John Junior's brother Samuel)---no doubt an effectual persuasive to honest dealing---'and one in the highway against John Whipple's house,' ... Captain William Hopkins (the second husband of John Junior's youngest sister Abigail) was appointed 'clarke of the Market' for the fair. Similar orders were made in 1697 and 1698.\"[ 20 ]\n\nMary and Epenetus Olney, who were married 9 March 1665/66, and their children (Mary, James, Sarah, Epenetus, John, Mercy, Thomas, and Lydia) lived in their tavern house in Providence until their deaths in 1698;[ 21 ] at which time, their son James who maintained the business until his death in 1744, inherited the property. Epenetus Junior and family lived in North Providence on Fruit Hill near the farm of Benjamin Whipple, his mother's brother.[ 22 ] Mary Whipple-Olney's descendants became some of Rhode Island's and New England's most respected industrialists, professionals, and statesmen. The oldest house in Centerdale, Rhode Island, built in 1701, was that of Epenetus Olney Junior.[ 23 ] The destinies of the Whipple and Olney families were intertwined for many years.\n\nJohn Whipple Junior House\n\nIn the Last Will and Testament drawn by Captain John Whipple in 1682 and proved 27 May 1685, John Whipple Junior was bequeathed the sum of only twelve pence, \"excepting thirty acres which I gave unto my son John at the northwest end.\"[ 24 ] This refers to a deed for a house and land drawn up some 22 years earlier, 23 November 1663. Within two weeks of receiving this property, John Junior married and moved in to his new house.\n\nThe photograph below is of the northeast corner of Main and Star Streets. The house and land that was deeded to John Junior was located approximately where the south end of the apartment building now stands. The house would have faced south (to the right of the photograph) with its front door leading out on to Star Street. William Arnold, father of the man from whom Captain John bought the property, had apparently built an expensive house on this corner. In 1650, he was taxed five pounds, twice the sum of any other owner on the street.[ 25 ] The land immediately to the right of Star Street is now the parking lot of St. John's Episcopal Church and the Diocese of Rhode Island. Colonel Joseph Whipple, John Junior's brother, was the leading contributor to the building of the church in 1722. Whipple Hall, the first permanent public school in Providence, was located at the top and to the left of Star Street on Benefit Street, just to the left of the distant red sign in the photograph.\n\nThe enrolment of A deede, signed and sealed by John Whiple Senior. As followeth: Know all men by these presentes, That I John Whiple Inhabetant of the Town of providence in the Nanhiggansick Bay in New England (senior). Have ffreely given, granted, and confirmed; and by thes presentes doe ffreely give grant make over, and conffirme unto my sone John Whiple a howse lott, or home share of land which fformerly belojnged unto William Arnold (Now inhabitant of Pautuxett) with all the howsing ffencing,ffruite Trees standing upon the said land or appertaineing thereunto: only Excepting so much of the East part of said lott which belongeth unto Thomas Olney ... Also the aforesaid Lott, or sharae of land containeth in breadth Eight poles according unto sixteene ffoote & a halfe to the pole: Also Two shares of Meaddow lieing in one percell, they being in Esttmation six Acrs (more or less) the which shares of meadow are scituated lieing and being at the south End of the Meadow commonly called the great Meaddow; and on the East side of the fresh river called Moshosick River ...

I doe here unto putt my hand and seale, Signed John Whipple. Enroled, May the 14th 1667: by me Thomas Olney Jun': Clarke of the Towne of providence: by, & with the Townes order.[ 26 ]\n\nThe Thomas Olney mentioned in the deed \"only excepting so much of the east part of said lot which belongeth unto Thomas Olney,\" deeded his part of the lot to the young couple at the same time. The Whipple-to-Whipple deed can yet be viewed in the library of the Rhode Island Historical Society. It is interesting that John Junior and Mary were married in the same year that Rhode Island received its Charter, which unlike the other American colonies guaranteed freedom of religion, from the new king of England (whose father had been beheaded by Oliver Cromwell). The Whipples, like their recently adopted frontier homeland, were entering a new and challenging stage of life. As seen in the deed, John Junior and his bride moved into the former house of William Arnold, ancestor of the notorious Revolutionary War trader, Benedict Arnold.\n\nRoger Williams and John Whipple Junior\n\nWithin less than a decade of arriving in Providence with his parents, at about the age of 18 or19, John Junior became a major participant in a protracted, on-going legal battle to acquire Indian land. His primary opponent in a battle of words and legal machinations was none other than The Reverend Roger Williams, the colony's founder. Indeed, it has been noted that John Junior was considered by the much-revered Williams to be one of his most formidable foes, particularly in the battle of words.\n\nIn brief, the youthful John Junior allied himself with his wife's father, William Olney; his brother Samuel's wife's uncle, William Harris; and William Arnold, his sister Abigail's second husband's uncle. These men were the leaders of a consortium of the earliest settlers called \"Proprietors,\" who had for years sought to extend the plantation's boundaries westward for some 20 miles, allowing them to create vast land holdings exclusively for themselves.[ 27 ] Roger Williams, always the champion of the Indians, opposed this plan. The ensuing legal wrangling lasted well into the next century, long after the combatants had died.[ 28 ]\n\nBy virtue of two extant letters that Williams wrote to John Whipple Junior (others are known to have been exchanged between them) on 8 July 1669 and 24 August 1669, something is learned of John Junior's personality and character, at least from Williams' point of view. In the August letter, after discussing the inaccuracy of John Junior's unflattering pronouncements against him, and alluding to why the youth had been precipitously drawn under the supposed nefarious influence of his relatives, Williams next addressed the issue of John Junior's own mental and spiritual inadequacies:\n\n\" ... Further, since You seeme so fair and innocent in Your owne eye, I pray you to consider Your face impartially ... in the Glasse of these 2 or 3 particulars.\n\n\"1. First in all our Towne meetings is it not notoriously knowne that You are so far from being Swift to heare and slow to speake (according to Gods command unto us:) that what ever is propounded or by whomsoever You are the first that lets fly upon it, and betweene Your selfe and Some other begins Dispute and Contention that other Neighbours (though able, ancient, and experienced) scarce find an Interim to utter their Thoughts in the Case and Busines. Whether this be out of quicknes of your mind, or Weaknes of Judgmnt; Out of an Itch of Contention, or Self Conceitednes and pride, let Your Selfe and others Consider it. However I am sure it is not the Badge and Character of a Sober and Peaceable Townsman, least of all a humble Christian.\n\n\"2. Secondly How can you be an innocent and peaceable Christian, when Your Selfe (above others of William Harris' disciples) Continually and Voluntarily thrust in your Selfe amongst Your Adversaries, though you declaime agnst their Persons, Meetings and practices, and You to them be as welcome as Water into a Ship or a Moskeeto to the face or bozoome, and have gaind your Selfe The title of one William Harris' spies and Promoters ... If it be a dutie for all of your partie to crosse and contend with your Adversaries why doe they all Neglect their Dutie? ... how can you Wash your Hands amongst your neighbours in the Bason Of Puritie and Christian Innocencie? It is clear, that you beare up your selfe upon the Gentlenes and Patience of your Adversaries ... for they have not feard the presence of any of William Harris's promoters, though no other good can be expected from their presence but Contention, Provocation; further Alienations, and catching hold of all Advantages, according to William Harris's his Machivilliam Maxime 'All Advantages angst Adversaries.'\n\n\"If you came as a Messenger from the other Partie with messages or Proposals for Peace and Accommodation, and leave Your Adversaries alone to Consult upon them and upon an Answer, what an Instrument and Angel of peace might be between them ... how far is this from Christianitie, Yea from common prudence and Civilitie?\n\n\"Lastly if my case were Yours and I were such a Companion, Councellor, and Conferderate of William Harris and such a Spie and Promoter of his Covetuous and ambitious ends so take notice of an cried out on by the Barbarians (Indians) for such Monstrous Stealing of their Countrey I know not how to escape that Thunderbolt Psalm, 50 ... \"Now I humbly beseech the most holy and Eternall God to ... punish William Harris and you ... and beg of him to heale our Breaches, and for his Names Sake to spring us Some Providences of Love and peace amongst us. Your unworthy neighbour, RW.\"[ 29 ]\n\nThis appears clearly to be a one-sided vilification of the character of an obviously gifted and highly motivated young man. From another perspective, by carrying out the example set by his father to supplant the wilderness, John Junior clearly exemplified those familial traits that soon enlarged the extended family's ownership of much of Providence and northern Rhode Island. There is no denying that his dual personality traits of a driving ambition and thirst for land appears in others of the Whipple family, particularly in his younger brother Joseph and family, who by the early 1700s were much-admired owners of some of the town's most highly valued property.[ 30 ]\n\nFrom this perspective, the sons of Captain John Whipple became self-made men, not unlike many others in the English colonies who were determined to take advantage of every opportunity that increased their status and wealth. However, it was this very quality of acquisitiveness in John Junior, and his allies, that Roger Williams vilified in the above letters. Although the ultimate outcome (11 February 1712)[ 31 ] of the lawsuits went against the Harris, Arnold, Olney, and Whipple family syndicate, a great deal of land still came into the possession of their descendants. In the case of the Whipple family, several descendants moved into the generally disputed areas of Cranston, Scituate, and Warwick, living there for several generations under such names as Rice, Carder, Arnold, Harris, Rhodes, and Whipple.[ 32 ] In fairness, later historians note that Harris was concerned, with good reason, about the intent of Massachusetts men as well as syndicates of land speculators to take over much of the Narragansett and possibly end Rhode Island's existence as a separate colony. His motives were not entirely selfish. It should be noted that Williams himself became quite wealthy by selling land.[ 33 ] \"Near the end of his life ... Williams lamented the bitter land dispute and his own role in it.\"[ 34 ]\n\nThe War of 1675-76\n\nOne event that caused a serious delay in the final disposition of the litigation was an Indian uprising during the years 1675/76. Though the conflict lasted barely 18 months, all but a handful of Providence's 300 to 400 inhabitants fled to Aquidneck Island for safety while much of their town burned to the ground. The colony had forbidden servitude of Indians since 1674, but the incensed settlers were not willing to abide by that law so soon after the war. Hundreds were auctioned off as bondservants under the direction of a committee of five men: Roger Williams, Thomas Harris, Thomas Field, Thomas Angell, and John Whipple Junior. By early 1677 the committee, which now was composed of Arthur Fenner, William Hopkins, and John Whipple Junior, had concluded its work. \"Wee whose names are here unto Subscribed having imployed Arther Ffenner, William Hopkins, and John Whipple Junior to make Sale of a Company of Indians to us belonging as by Act of the Comittey doth Appeare, they having made Sale of the Same, and received a part of the pay for the Same, and having proportioned Each man his share of what they have received the which amovnted to Sixteene shillings and fower pence hafle peeny the which sayd svmm wee say wee have received, and Doe hereby fully Acquitt and disschareg the above named persons of the same as witness our hands this first day of January one thovsand, Six hvndred, Seventy and Seven.\"[ 35 ] Whipples who received part of the proceeds were John Senior and his sons Samuel and Eleazer. Actually, the only Whipple brothers who appear never to have been mentioned in such awards in 1676-77 were William and David. Even the 12-year-old Jonathan was listed.[ 36 ]\n\nJohn Whipple Junior played an important role in preserving the town's records. \"By the time the good people of Providence had sold off their Indian prisoners, reinstated their house-hold goods so far as that was practicable, and settled down once more to a quiet life on the Towne Street ... their first thought was for the preservation their 'Town Books and Records (saved by Gods mercifull Providence from fire and water).' Accordingly four men, who had held the position of town clerk (including John Junior), were appointed to 'view and search the papers, what is wanting or Lost, and make report to the Towne.\" This was done in October 1677, and the records were in due course delivered to the then town clerk, Daniel Abbott.[ 37 ]\n\nThis transfer actually took place almost a year later. \"We whose names are here under subscribed, being empowered by an order of this town as before said, have this 23rd day of August 1678 received of John Whipple Jr. the former town clerk, all the said books, papers, parchments, and writing herein before mentioned and particularized, which belong to the town. And do there of in the town's behalf fully, clearly, and absolutely acquit and discharge the said John Whipple Jr. of and from all papers that concern this town. In witness whereof we do here unto set our hands this day and year above said. Signed, Roger Williams & Daniel Abbott.\"[ 38 ]\n\nAn Influential Entrepreneur\n\nThe distinction of being the first resident of Providence to receive a grant of land on the west side of Town Street next to the cove and river, for the purpose of constructing a warehouse and wharf, has historically been awarded to Pardon Tillinghast in the year 1680. However, John Junior received permission from the town a year earlier to erect such a structure \" ... adjoyneth to the south part of Ware howse lot formerly laid out to John Whipple ffather of the said Now John Whipple (deceased) ... \" See the 27 January 1703/04 entry below for details of the transaction. Although the descriptor \"wharfe\" was not specifically used, there would have been no use for a structure of that size, twice that of Tillinghast's, unless commodities in significant amounts were being imported/exported for sale. As noted below, John's warehouse was kept busy buying and selling for his clients and those of others. He was listed as one of Providence's leading merchants during the decade of the 1680s.[ 39 ] He subsequently sold this property to his brother Benjamin, 6 March 1692/93.\n\nIn addition to owning the equivalent of a modern hotel/motel,[ 40 like his father before him, in the days when the holder of such a position was one of the most important public functionaries, John Junior was one of Providence's leading attorneys.[ 41 ] In reality, the two professions were symbiotic: \"A tavern keeper in these primitive days immediately radiated influence and power. His place of business was like a club center or exchange ... a permanent parliament in perpetual session, and minute regulation of town affairs was conceived and worked up in these friendly debates. As the Assembly, Courts, Town, and council meetings always sat in central taverns, the landlord often became the oracle of his neighborhood. Sometimes chief of local militia and representative in the Assembly, he enjoyed prominence which in Massachusetts belonged to the Puritan minister.\"[ 42 ]\n\nIt would seem that the profession of the law was similarly profitable, as evidenced in several references to John Junior's practice. At a time when newspapers were unheard of and back fence discussions carried the news of the day, scandal, slander, and gossip often filled the air and occasionally went on record. \"On 27 August 1684, Samuel Bennett was obliged to retain John Whipple, Jr., an attorney, to defend him against the suit of Bridget Price. In September, Bridget declared that the said Bennett charged her with being a thief and a vagabond.\" Even far-away Boston furnished him considerable tort business, for a \"Thomas Clarke in his pewtour's shop there, had an altercation with one Mary Brattle. He followed her to Providence where he arraigned her through the busy attorney Whipple\"[ 43 ] In his role as an attorney, John Junior played a role in a later important occurrence in early town history. Joshua Verin was one of the five who came in the traditional canoe with The Reverend Roger Williams on the first recorded voyage in 1636. He received a home lot in the division and settled in Providence. However, he immediately became involved in a liberty of conscience conflict that forced him to return to Salem, Massachusetts. Years later, he addressed a request to the town council to maintain his status as one of the original proprietors and retain his property in Providence. Captain John Whipple and others were able to prevail in his favor in the ensuing adjudication. Subsequently, although an absentee owner, Verin was allowed to keep his land. \"In 1674 he was represented by John Whipple Junior who held a power of attorney, he (Verin) having gone to Barbados to reside.\"[ 44 ]\n\nThe practice of the corporate side of the legal profession likewise appears to have been a profitable aspect of his busy schedule. Shortly before his death, John wrote to the town council on behalf of a client enquiring as to whether \"rivers belonging to the towne are common and ffree to sett up any mill or mills, or Contrary to law so to do.\"[ 45 ] The General Assembly, in 1707, ruled that towns could determine the use of rivers, coves, etc., providing that they avoided abrogating property rights. \"The Quakers usually confined their business to other Friends: at Providence John Whipple (Junior) acted for those in Boston, Bridgewater, Plymouth Colony, Rehoboth, and Newport. He bought rum through Daniel Gould on Rhode Island, and in turn looked after forwarding a trunk full of goods Edward Shippen wanted delivered to Newport. Frequently, too, a correspondent in a distant place made 'my good friend John Whipple' his 'Lawfull Attorney' to collect money or goods or estates due; Stephen Paine of Rehoboth used Whipple to recover what was owed to him from the estate of Leonard Smith of Providence in 1670.[ 46 ] The above has led some to think that John Junior may have been a convert to the Society of Friends.[ 47 ]\n\nIn 1672, John Junior and his brother-in-law, Thomas Olney Junior, were recipients of a letter from George Fox, the founder of that newly formed Christian sect, imploring the colony to continue to allow freedom of religion and speech. Fox had for two years been traveling in the colonies, and in that year spent the summer in Rhode Island. \"Just before his departure he wrote a singular paper to Thomas Olney, jr. and John Whipple, jr., at Providence known as 'George Fox's instructions to his friends,' which was answered with unseemly severity, the following year, by Olney, in a lengthy article entitled 'Ambition Anatomised'.\"[ 48 ] It has never entirely been explicated why the letter was addressed to them in particular, unless they held positions of authority or were able to promulgate its message in some way. John Junior was at the time serving in his third consecutive year as town clerk, and Thomas Olney Junior was the long-time minister of a Baptist Church in Providence, former town clerk, and town council member. It seems also, at least at that time, that John Junior was still a Baptist. The above is a portion of a document thought to have been written and signed by John Whipple (Junior).\n\nJohn Whipple Junior in Early Town Records\n\nIn addition to the numerous times John Whipple Junior was elected to town and colony offices,[ 49 ] he appeared in Providence Town records on several other occasions. The following is a summary of a chronological listing as extracted from The Early Records of the Town of Providence, 21 Volumes (Providence: Snow & Farnham, 1892-1915).

(XVII:206)\n\nJohn Whipple Junior, Esq., died 15 December 1700, and was most likely buried next to his first wife in a family burial plot on their household lot on Town Street. Whether his remains were subsequently moved, like his parents, to the town's common burial ground has never been shown. He and his wives are not listed in the records, which began in 1848, of the North Burial Ground. \"Existing gravestones ... mark only 18 burials here by 1725 ... There undoubtedly were unmarked burials, but without records we have no way of knowing how many. An educated guess would be that ten percent of the burials were marked with gravestones. This would indicate that there were 180 or more by 1725.\"[ 50 ] It is known that the majority of reinterments did not occur until toward the middle of the 1700s; consequently, there is almost near certainty that John Junior's remains lie near his parents (since their homes were next to each other, likely shared a common burial plot, and bodies thus removed at the same time) and brothers, Joseph and Samuel, somewhere in Sections A or B of the most ancient part of the cemetery. \"John Whipple was licensed to keep an ordinary. His south windows looked down upon the 'Whipple burying ground' in the adjoining field.\"[ 51 ]\n\nJohn Whipple III\n\nAt the meeting of the Providence Town Council, 7 January 1701, \"Rebeckah Whipple widow of the deceasd John Whipple presented unto the Councill a paper signed by John Whipple & sealed ... as witnessed by ffoure pesons (viz) ... \" One of the witnesses was Joseph Whipple, his brother. After subsequent reading of the will, \"John Whipple the son, & heir apparent ... hath this day made objections against the said will by ... reason that it is an Jllegall instrument ... he having Rendred [his] reasons for the same to the council.\" The Town Council took depositions and heard testimony on February 11, and March 11 and 12. Finally, on April 8, it ruled the proffered will to be bogus and consequently invalid.\n\nThe ruling was based on the reasoning the John Junior, being blind, did not know the actual contents of the will, he apparently having been read a variant version after the fact. When asked by four witnesses, at a later date, whether the will was his actual intent it not having been read or heard by them either, John Junior replied affirmatively. Thus neither the deceased nor the witnesses had read the piece of paper presented to the Council on 7 January. In addition to this, two individuals testified that John Junior had told them personally that it was not his will to disinherit his son, but being blind, \"he must doe as others (his wife and daughters?) have him doe ... \" When asked directly if he wanted to disinherit his son, \"John Whipple answered no, no that is not my desire ... \"[ 52 ]\n\nBy the date of the next town council session, 22 April, all parties to the litigation had resolved their differences: \"Differences have happened among relatives of deceased-now all considering that to bring it to law would be greatly troublesome to all parties, and great charge, and would cause animosities of spirit and alienation of affection-an agreement was made. To John Whipple, the homestall, dwelling house, barn, and certain lands. To Mary Carder, Elnathan Rice, Deliverance Whipple and Dorothy Rhodes, certain land. Movable estate to go one-third to widow, and the rest in five parts to five children ... \"[ 53 ] John III also inherited seven acres from his grandfather Thomas Olney at this time.\n\nAs part of the \"certain land\" above, John III apparently owned his father's property in the Louquisett meadows. John III sold part of this to his uncle Eleazer Whipple: \" ... I give (to my son Job) 120 acres in the district of Louquisset Woods and from part of the land bought from my cousin (nephew) John Whipple.\"[ 54 ]\n\nBy virtue of the agreement above, John III inherited the property, originally deeded to his father in 1663, seen below.[ 55 ] He in turn sold the land to his uncle Colonel Joseph Whipple in 1705.[ 56 ] The remainder of the original Captain John Whipple property, extending from the lot (each being about 125 feet in width) of Francis Wickes northward to that of John Green Junior, had been willed to Colonel Whipple in 1685, who in turn willed it to his son John in 1746. \"Beyond Scot, along nearly the whole east side of the present 'Constitution Hill' there was scarcely a house. The steep hill-side behind it did not invite purchasers. In 1659, came John Whipple, from Massachusetts. He purchased nearly the whole tract eastward of that part of the Town street.\"[ 57 ] The only street at the time was Main Street, or \"Towne Streete,\" as it was then called. In the year 1798, this entire area from Star Street northward was still owned by John Whipple, S. Whipple, J. Whipple, and Joseph Whipple.[ 58 ] Note that the additional streets shown in the drawing below were constructed years later.\n\nIt is a conundrum why John III's sisters and stepmother would go to such lengths to have him disinherited. He does not appear in town records until late. He apparently was not living in Providence as of 15 April 1687. At that time, the village drew up a list of 27 men who were fit to serve in the militia. John III was not listed, although his father, seven uncles, and two cousins were.[ 59 ] The cousins were Samuel Junior and Thomas, sons of Samuel, and were yet teenagers, while he was 21 years of age. On at least one occasion, seven months before his father's death, John III characterized himself, at age 34, as destitute. In response to a request, he was answered, \"In Consederation of the Condtion of the said John Whipple that he is destetude of land & in want of land to improve for a lively hood the Towne doe grant the said John Whipple Tenn Acres of land.\"[ 60 ]\n\nWhat character flaws could have led to such a fiscal state? Records show that immediately following the death of his father, he attempted to confiscate the property of his deceased uncle Benjamin Whipple, leaving his cousins, who were yet children, and their mother destitute.[ 61 ] Not only this, due to an apparent flaw in Captain John's 1682 will, the inherited properties of three other of his uncles were challenged as well. Uncharitably, this forced them, in 1708, to buy off John III's claims for an undisclosed sum of money: \" ... And lest that any inconveniency or Trouble Should at any time arise by ye Meanes of any PerSon or PerSons WhatSoever Making Claime to any of the lands or Said house in Said Will Given and DeviSed unto any of ye abouve Named PerSons through any apprehension or Conjecture of any defect in Said Will, as they May, SuppoSe for want of Words or formality any Wayes; ffor the prevention therof, & the ye Said lands and HouSe by the Said Will ...

He appears to have returned to his childhood home just in time to claim an immense inheritance.\n\nThe controversy over the birth of his (or his wife's) first son sheds an added degree of clarity as to the effects of John III's behavior on others. Though it is speculative, he could have lived a significant part of his adult life in another colony until at least the mid 1690s. As seen, he was not listed in Providence military records of 1687, and in December of 1688 his wife gave birth to a child in Taunton, Massachusetts. This child was born approximately one month after his marriage to Lydia Hoare, 9 November 1688. \"In volume 44 of the American Genealogist appears an article entitled, Job Whipple of Providence, RI, by H. Minot Pitman, FASG of Bronksville, NY. The gist of the story is that Job Whipple was born prior to the marriage of his purported father, John Whipple and his mother, Lydia Hoar. Mr. Pittman says Job was born in Taunton, probably 25 December 1688 ... oddly there is no record in Taunton for the birth of a Job Hoar or Whipple. The vital records of Providence, giving the dates of birth and marriage for Job Whipple were not entered in the book (Vol.1 p.11) until the month of November 1719. The entry was probably made from information given by Job himself to the clerk and reads: 'Job Whipple, the son of John Whipple of Providence' ... The facts are further supported by an indenture of apprenticeship to be found in the rebound volume now known as, 'Third Town Book B,' made between Job Liddeason (Lydia's son) John Whipple, Jr. and Lydia his wife, all of Providence on the one party and John Sayles of Providence ... This shows that at the time Job had not taken the Whipple name. As apprenticeships usually began at about the age of 7 years and lasted until the age of 21 years, Job was probably born 25 December 1688.\"[ 63 ]\n\nCould John III's relatives have been disenthralled at this treatment of his wife and son, and other such aberrant behavior? Due to cultural strictures of the time, he likely would not have married Lydia had the unborn child not been his. It is difficult to understand why he, if he had loved and respected his wife, would yet have allowed her child to live through life bearing the stigma of being considered a bastard, and she even worse. Such would have hurt a great many people and caused much embarrassment to his father and sisters.\n\nUnquestionably, this treatment of their daughter and grandson would have been an egregious affront to the Hoare family. Lydia was the daughter of Ensign Hezekiah Hoare, Esq., one of the original purchasers of Taunton, Massachusetts, who had served under Captain Miles Standish in the Dutch wars. They were the politically prominent and wealthy part owners of the first iron works in the colonies. The family lived on \"Hoare's Lane\" in Taunton. It traced its ancestry to 1093 England and its founding ancestor, Sir William Le Hoar. The castle and estate of Pole Hoar had ever since remained the property of the family of Hezekiah's cousin, Sir Philip Hoar.[ 64 ] The Hoare family likely maintained at best a rather strained relationship with the John Whipples, as would the families of his uncles, and his own sisters. His was not the first instance in which the only son of a rich and powerful father was unable to measure up to familial expectations.\n\nJohn Whipple III appeared in Providence Township records on several other occasions. The following is a chronological listing of a summary of these taken from The Early Records of the Town of Providence, 21 Volumes, (Providence: Snow & Farnham, 1892-1915). Individual entries are noted with the volume number and page.\n\nNote that there were at least four adult John Whipples living in Providence in the early to mid 1700s. In the year 1700, John III was 34 years old; his son was eight. John III's cousin, Captain John Whipple, known as the \"bonesetter,\" and a Justice of the Peace, the oldest son of Joseph, was 15 years old. John Whipple of North Providence, son of Benjamin, had just been born. Town records only infrequently clearly differentiate them. Numerous entries merely state that an indeterminate \"John Whipple\" served as a juryman or committeeman, and such. Consequently, the authors have attempted to make discriminations based on known historical data and particularity of circumstances at the time.\n\nIt is assumed that until the year 1705/06, the year that John son of Joseph became of age, entries refer to John III, particularly in the matter of town council meetings at his house/tavern. It is apparent that John III took over ownership, and the council continued to meet in the same location as it had during the late 1690s. Entries that mention the office of Justice of the Peace, or sea-faring commerce, as well as his father, siblings, and in-laws, were assigned to John, son of Joseph. John, son of Benjamin, in the few cases he is mentioned, appears in connection with locations in North Providence and his sibling and in-laws. We have not been able to locate any John IV entries at this time.\n\n30 March 1696\n\nIndenture of Job Lideasson by John Whipple (IV:156-58)\n\n27 April 1700\n\nWhereas John Whipple hath desired if the Towne that they would accomedate him with a percell of land lieing under the Southeasterne part of the hill Called the Wine mill hill to the quantetye of about Tenn acres, In Consederation of the Condition of the said John Whipple he is destitude of land & in want of land to improve for a livelihood the Towne doe grant unto the said John Whipple Tenn acres of land (XI:55)\n\n27 July 1702\n\n...

Hezekiah was born 17 February 1701 in Providence and there married Katherine Olney 14 July 1723. Katherine's maternal great grandfather was The Reverend Roger Williams through his daughter Mary. Also, Saylesville, Rhode Island was named for her mother's father, John Sayles.[ 65 ] Their son Christopher was born 19 March 1736. Christopher married Mary Proud at Providence on 27 July 1765. He died before 3 December 1796, and she on 13 July 1820 at Providence. They had four children, three of whom died young, and Captain Christopher6 Whipple (Christopher5, Hezekiah4, John3, John2, John1), born 5 March 1773 at Providence.[ 66 ] He died 29 September 1807.\n\nRobert Farquarhar Whipple, Pioneer New York Descendant of John Whipple Junior\n\nJob Liddeason Whipple married Lydia Harding 2 December 1713[ 67 ] at Providence and there had four children, including Elijah and John. John (1718-1767) was in Glocester Township, Rhode Island before 1742, where his 10 children, including seven sons, were born. Jonah (22 October 1761- 6 January1843), his youngest child, moved to Gilmanton, New Hampshire before 1793, then Quebec, Canada, Sheffield, Vermont, then to Chateaugay, New York. Jonah Whipple and his wife, Hepsibeth Melvin, had seven children, including Nathan, Jonathan, Daniel, and John J.\n\nJonathan Whipple was born in the year 1800 in Stanstead, Quebec, Canada and died in 1892. He and his wife, Lucinda Kentner, had nine children, including William, who was born in Chateaugay, New York 13 January 1841 and died there 21 October 1927. William and his wife, Mary Ward, had eight children including Jasper9 Whipple (William8, Jonathan7, Jonah6, John5, Job4, John3, John2, John1), who was born in Reese, Michigan 9 March 1883 and died there 10 February 1966.[ 68 ]\n\nJonah's third son, Daniel, was born in Gilmanton, New Hampshire, and died in Chateaugay, New York 1 August 1885. He and his wife, Agnes McClatchie, had nine children, including four sons: James (1835-1923), who died in Rogue River, Oregon; William (1839-1888), who died in Wadena, Minnesota; John (1849-1924), who died in Hartford, Connecticut; and Alfred (1853-1926).[ 69 ]\n\nJohn J. Whipple, Jonah's youngest son, was born in Sheffield, Vermont and married Esther Bickford 20 December 1828. Six of their children were sons. He apparently moved back to Canada before his marriage, as least four of his children (Daniel, Ida, Gordon, and John), several grandchildren, as well as his wife were born there. John J's grandson, Ira John9 Whipple (John8, John J7, Jonah6, John5, Job4, John3, John2, John1) was born in Hatley, Quebec, and moved to Iowa around the year 1885 where he married his second wife, Hattie Dunbar. He died at Cheyenne, Kansas 25 January 1940. This couple had three children: Dallas, who was born in Stratton, Colorado, and died in Parsons, Kansas 14 September 1956; Alan (1890-1946), who lived and died at Stratton, Colorado, as did his five children; and Ethel, who married William Armknecht and lived out her life at Colorado, Springs, Colorado, dying there in 1952.[ 70 ]\n\nRobert Farquarhar8 Whipple (Nathan7, Jonah6, John5, Job4, John3, John2, John1) was the son of Nathan Whipple of Gilmanton, New Hampshire. Nathan, Jonah Whipple's oldest son, moved with his father's family to Chateaugay, New York, where he died in 1873. \"He married Rachel Farquhar, daughter of Robert and Barbara Farquhar. She was a full blood Scott and came to America with her parents when she was 15 years old. The Farquarhars were very zealous Scotch Presbyterians and Rachel brought her family up in the faith. When Robert F. converted in a Methodist revival meeting and joined that church his mother emphatically declared that he had started on the direct road to hell. Robert Farquhar Whipple, son of Nathan and Rachel Whipple, was born at Chateaugay, N.Y., April 2, 1840 and died at Brockport, N.Y., Jan. 10, 1914. He married Lucy C. Stevens, daughter of Linus and Susan Witherell Stevens, Jan. 1, 1861. She was born July 28, 1840, and died at Brockport, N.Y., Feb. 16, 1914 ... [They] began their married life at Chateaugay N.Y., but in the spring of 1862 moved to Fort Jackson N.Y. where they lived until 1872 when Robert began his life work as a Methodist Episcopal Minister ... At that period it was the custom to move Methodist Ministers ever year or two ... \"\n\nIn a thirteen-year period he served seven churches in the state of New York. \"At the conference in April 1885 he assumed a supernumerary (retired) relation ... Early in the summer he moved to Black River, N.Y. where he bought a lot and built a house on West Street, which he sold later. In 1886 he resumed his ministerial work ... \" In the next twenty years he served seven more churches in the state of New York. \"He retired from active ministry and moved to Brockport, N.Y. and bought a small fruit farm, where he was living at the time of his death, January 10th, 1914. He was educated in the Common Schools and the Chateaugay Academy. He learned the shoemakers trade and was very expert, especially in the manufacture of 'Mens Fine Boots' for dress wear. He followed that occupation until he entered the ministry. He was a member of the Masonic and Odd Fellows fraternities. Robert and Lucy were the parents of five children including Charles, Robert, and Fred.\n\n\"Fred E. Whipple was born at Chateaugay, N.Y., Dec.22, 1861. He married Elsie J. Humes ... of Harrisville, N.Y. May 19, 1883. They had two children, Lucia and Harlan F. Whipple. Fred and Elsie Whipple began housekeeping at Black River, N.Y. soon after they were married. In 1886 he built a house on Maple Street in that village where they lived until 1906.On March 12, 1883 he bought a small store ... which proved to be a poor venture and he sold out and engaged as clerk with Poor & Son. This store retained him as manager when he entered a co-partnership with A.W. Hadsell and ran the store under the name Whipple & Hadsell until it burned Feb.19, 1890 in the disastrous fire which wiped out the entire business section of the village. On Oct. 1st 1890 he engaged as office manager with Dexter's Sons, chair manufacturers at Black River. In 1907 he was assistant manager (of F.W. Woolworth Co.) at Lorain, Ohio and that fall was transferred to Cleveland, Ohio, in that same capacity, where he remained until 1908 when he was made manager of the store at Oil City, Pa., where he remained until resigned from the syndicate on Jan.1, 1915. On Feb. 25, 1915 he ... opened a novelty store which he ran as F.E. Whipple & Company. On May 1st 1918, he accepted the position of cashier of the First National Bank of Harrisville, N.Y. Fred E. Whipple was always active in civic affairs. He was a zealous worker for the incorporation of the village of Black River in 1890, and the incorporation of the fire department in which he served 12 years, in the establishing of the Black River High school and the cemetery association. He was village clerk for several years and village president for two years (1903-05).\"[ 71 ]\n\n\"My connection to the Job Whipple family is through Charles Wesley Whipple, the brother of Fred Whipple.

Immediately upon immigrating to Providence with her family in 1659, she married John Smith Junior, son of her father's former neighbor in Dorchester, Massachusetts. John Smith Senior's home in Massachusetts was at Ponkapog, in the southern foothills of the Blue Mountains. His name appears on the records of Dorchester in connection with a small tract of land \"about the mill.\" Captain John Whipple lived near this same mill, and is thought to have played a role, as an indentured servant, in its construction for Israel Stoughton in 1634.[ 73 ]\n\nSmith was exiled after the Massachusetts General Court ordered that, \"John Smyth salbe sent within theis 6 weekes out of this jurisdiccion for dyvers dangerous opinions, wch hee holdeth, & hath divulged, if in the meane tyme he removes not himselfe out of this plantation.\" He immediately joined Roger Williams, William Harris, Joshua Verin, Thomas Angell, and Francis Wickes as they fled through the wilderness to the mouth of the Moshassuck River. Williams stated on 17 November 1677, \"I consented to John Smith, Miller, at Dorchester [banished also] to go with me.\" He was given the exclusive right to operate a gristmill on north Mill Street as long as he provided satisfactory service in grinding corn for the townsmen. He served as Town Clerk in 1641 and died in 1647. Below is a photo of the commemorative plaque that marks the location of the Smith gristmill. It is located approximately 100 yards northwest of where Mill Street crosses the Moshassuck River, and on the north side of the present Girl Scouts of America Building.\n\n\"Long before jail or meeting-house, the Town mill was the earliest institution of the Plantations. It received much careful oversight from the Town meeting ... The mill fixed the centre of the town at the North end, and long kept it there. Around and near it, those who were able, set their houses, and it became not merely the nucleus of population, but the place of public rendezvous and exchange. It served the same purpose as the meeting-house in early Massachusetts, or as the newspaper and insurance offices of later days ... it took part in many a sturdy encounter of the Baptist, the Gortonian, and the Quaker ... During one hundred and eighty years the Town Mill fulfilled its office, and was one of the last memorials of primitive times. It was destroyed at last, by the Blackstone canal ... \"[ 74 ]\n\nSarah Whipple and John Smith Junior inherited the Smith mill property, started a nearby sawmill on their own, and carried on the family businesses along with their 10 children (John, Sarah, Alice, Mary, Joseph, Benjamin, Israel, Daniel, Elisha, and William). Sarah died after 21 May 1688 and her first husband in 1682.[ 75 ] The mill stayed in possession of the family for several generations.[ 76 ] The entire Sarah Whipple-Smith family is thought to have been members of the Society of Friends. And as noted, Sarah's granddaughter, Anne Smith, married Stephen Hopkins in 1755, a few months before he became governor of Rhode Island at a Friend's Meetinghouse in Smithfield.[ 77 ]\n\nJonathan Whipple, Lumberman and Husbandman\n\nLieutenant Jonathan Whipple, youngest child of Captain John, was born in 1664 at Providence Rhode Island, and died at Providence 8 September 1721. He was married to Margaret (Margary) Angell about the year 1690. She died after 1703. Margaret and Jonathan had seven children:[ 78 ]\n\nJonathan Whipple (22 Feb 1691/92 - 6 Aug 1741)\n\nThomas W. Whipple (26 Feb 1693/94 - 13 Oct 1770)\n\nSarah Whipple (ABT 1696 - Bef 8 Sep 1721)\n\nMargaret Whipple ( - Aft 31 Dec 1726)\n\nParatine Whipple\n\nMary Whipple ( - Aft 1725)\n\nAlice Whipple\n\nThe marriage of Jonathan and Margaret is the second occasion where the children of Captain John and Sarah Whipple married into the same family. (Margaret Angell's older sister, Alice, had married Eleazer Whipple, Jonathan's older brother.)[ 79 ] Jonathan's father-in-law, Thomas Angell, and mother-in-law, Alice Ashton, were born in Old England. Thomas Angell came from London as a servant or apprentice of The Reverend Roger Williams as a boy of 12 or 13, and moved to Providence with him some five years later. On 27 July 1640, he was one of thirty-nine signers of the agreement to found a government at Providence. He held several town offices, despite being illiterate (or at least unable to write), including membership on the town council and commissioner. His name appeared on several documents along with the names of the Whipple brothers, including the 5 June 1676 Providence town meeting, where five men were chosen to settle the question of what to do with the surviving Indians subsequent to King Philip's War. As one of the five, Thomas Angell subscribed to the decision that they should be placed in servitude for a number of years, according to their present ages. Other colonies were not so generous, either killing their vanquished foes or selling them to slavery in distant lands.[ 80 ] It should also be noted that Jonathan's oldest brother John Junior's mother-in-law was Marie Ashton, Jonathan's mother-in-law's sister.\n\nThrough his father's last will and testament Jonathan received \"twenty-five acres on which he now dwelleth. Also, I give unto my son Jonathan, one division of land which is ordered by the town to be laid out between the 'seven mile line' and the 'four mile line' and papers already drawn for.\" In an addendum to the will, Jonathan also received \"one of his rights of land and common, on the west side of the 'seven mile line,' to be unto him, his heirs and assigns forever; and that that was his mind when the said will was written. However, it was omitted in part by the scribe of the said will.\"\n\nAs seen below, Jonathan sold this latter property to his brother, Joseph, about ten years later. He subsequently bought over 150 acres of land (in addition to the one division, usually 100 acres, of land between the four-mile line and the seven-mile line) over the years nearer to his homestead, including 10 acres from his cousin, James Dexter, on 20 September 1701, \"which is described in the deed as laying about one and a half miles Northerly from the salt water or town harbor, bounded on the south and west sides, by the river called the West river, and on the north by his own lands, which evidently was the land that was given to him by his father, by will, where he then lived.\"[ 81 ] Jonathan built the house opposite, at 238 Lexington Avenue, about the year 1701.[ 82 ] The photograph was taken about the year 1925. This and those of his brothers, Samuel and Eleazer, are the only known images of houses built or lived in by any of the first two generations of Rhode Island Whipples.\n\nBy virtue of having access to almost unlimited virgin stands of timber, and living so close to the town's salt-water harbor, Jonathan and three others applied for land to build a wharf. On 19 May 1707, the town council ruled that \"they shall have the vse of a percell of land by the salt water side in the Towne, that is to say from the Towne street west ward to the sea Chaniell for the vse of laying Timber, Boards, or other matter for transportation ... and of loadeing of Boates ... \" This enterprise was an obvious success, for as noted herein his descendants were for over a century actively involved in the \"Jonathan Whipple Sawmill\" on the West River.[ 83 ] There is no direct mention of it in his last will and testament. In that document, as throughout his lifetime he was consistently referred to as \"yeoman\" or \"husbandman,\" although the lumber business undoubtedly was a major source of income:\n\nI Jonathan Whipple of the Towne of Providence in the Colony of Rhoad Jsland and Providence plantation in New England: yeoman: being sick and Weake of body but of sound and dissoposeing mind and member praise be given to God for the Same; Doe make this my Last Will and Testament: in manner and forme following: first and principally I Commit my spirit into the mercifull hands of Almighty God my creator and my body I commit to the Earth to be decently buried after the discression of my Executors hereinafter named and as to the outward and worldly Esstate the Lord hath Lent mee in this present world: I Give and bequeathe as followeth\n\nJmprimis: my will is that my son Thomas Whipple shall pay unto his Brother Jonathan Whipple the Sum of five pounds in Good and Lawfull Bills of publick, Creadit or Currant money of New England.\n\n2nly my will is And I doe hereby Give and Bequeathe unto my two Sons Jonathan Whipple and Thomas Whipple: all my lands both devided and undevided which are scituate Lieing and being with the Towneship of Provident aforesaid that I heave not before disposed of by deedes of Gift: To be Equally devided betwixt them my aforesaid two sons Jonathan Whipple and Thomas Whipple and to be unto them theire Heirs Executors administrators and assigns To have and To hold with the previledges and appurtinanses theire unto belonging forever\n\nJtem I Give and bequeathe unto my son Jonathan Whipple my Cane\n\nJtem I Give and bequeath unto my two sons Jonathan Whipple and Thomas Whipple: my wareing Apparrill to be Equally devided betwixt them\n\nJtem I Give and bequeath unto my Loveing Wife Anna Whipple one third parte of all my housing: and one third parte of my homestead Lands orchard and appurtinanses theire unto belonging: and aloes one third part of all my moveable Goods and Esstate to be for her use during the term of her naturall Life providing shee Remaine a widow: Butt in Case shee marrey then for the sd moveable Esstate to goe to my Executors for them to dispose of amongst my Children as they shall see Cause.\n\nJtem I Give and bequeathe unto my daughter Alice Whipple the sum of twenty pounds to be paid to her by my Executors in Goods merchandize or publick Bills of Creadite and to be Leavied out of my Esstate.\n\nJtem I Give and bequeathe unto my daughter Parrataine White the Sum of five pounds to be paid to her by my Executors in Bills of Creadite or moveable goods as they may be Raise out of my Esstate\n\nJtem I Give and bequeathe unto my daughter Mary Haman the Sum of ten pounds to be paid to her by my Executors Jn Bills of Creadite marchandize or moveable Goods as it Can be Raises out of my Estate\n\nI Give and bequeath unto my Grandson Jonathan Haman my Gun And my Will is that what silver money I have shall be Equally devided amongst my wife and all my Children Each to have an Equal parte thereof And my will further is and I doe here by order that my daughter Alice Whipple shall have the Liberty of dwell in my dwelling house during the term of her Naturall Life provided shee Remaine single and unmarried.

Jonathan Whipple, his mark.[ 84 ]\n\nEnumerated as part of his inventory of movable goods was one Negro boy valued at 47 pounds, the most expensive item in the inventory of approximately 220 pounds. Jonathan, it would seem, was a slave owner. His second wife Anna, who died four years later, willed all of her possessions valued at just over 105 pounds to her stepdaughter Mary Haman.[ 85 ]\n\nAs noted above, \"Jonathan Whipple at his decease gave his land or farm to two sons, viz: Jonathan and Thomas, to be equally divided between them. This farm or land is situated in what is now the town of North Providence, a little north of the Waunscot factory, and has been retained in the name ever since the first settlement of the country. At this place there has been four Thomas Whipples lived in succession, and it has always been understood by them that they were a distant connection to those Whipples who live at Fruit Hill.\"[ 86 ] The 300-acre property of Jonathan's brother, Benjamin, was located approximately one"
