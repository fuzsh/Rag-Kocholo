        "text": "On December 16, 1773, approximately 100-150 colonists changed the course of history by destroying 340 chests of East India Company tea. This act of defiance and protest would eventually become known as the “Boston Tea Party” and propel America down to road to Revolution. In honor of their bravery and participation in this historic event, The Boston Tea Party Ships and Museum and Revolution 250 — a consortium of organizations working together to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the events that led to the American Revolution — have come together to form the Boston Tea Party Participant Grave Marker Project.\n\nThe goal of this international initiative is to locate the final resting places of the Boston Tea Party participants and place a commemorative marker at their graves, thus honoring their role in this iconic moment in world history. The project will proudly partner with local historical societies, museums, schools, and living history organizations, to celebrate and commemorate each community’s connection to the legacy of the Boston Tea Party.\n\nThe most recent dedication took place on October 15, 2022, in Westford, Massachusetts with the placement of the 118th commemorative plaque at the grave of Boston Tea Party participant Capt. Joseph Read. This commemoration took place in partnership with the Westford Cemetery Commission and the Westford Museum & Historical Society. Capt. Joseph Read was 57 years of age at the time of the Boston Tea Party, making him one of the oldest participants in the event. He became a prominent man in Westford and represented the community for 20 years in the General Court and served the town of Westford as a delegate at the provincial Congress."
