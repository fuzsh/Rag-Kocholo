        "text": "History\n\nEarly Colonial’s chose to situate their burying grounds on a hill. It was no longer important to establish a cemetery in a churchyard, as had been the custom in England, (although, New England does have a number of churchyard cemeteries.) The Colonials buried their dead in an east-west orientation. They believed, this way the dead would be the first to see the “second coming” (as it would came from the east), and they would stand up in their graves and be taken to heaven. As one looks around New England towns, one can see many old burying grounds are indeed located on hills.\n\nWalpole‟s earliest cemetery is the Old Burial Ground. The first known burial occurred there in 1714, some ten years before Walpole was set-off from Dedham. Before the establishment of this burying ground, early Walpolians had to bury their dead in Dedham (proper) which was many miles away. The next Cemetery established was the Billings Cemetery in Stoughtonham (now Sharon) in 1717. It islocated just over the border from South Walpole. The Plains Cemetery, in West Walpole, was the next cemetery established in 1731, followed by South Dedham (now Norwood), which established their first cemetery, the Second Parish Cemetery, some ten years later in 1741. In the late 1700‟s, in Norfolk County, many families began to establish their own small family cemeteries on their land. In our study, those family cemeteries include the Morse, Guild, Blake, Lothrop, Hartshorn and Esty. Some of these cemeteries have grown into a small neighborhood cemeteries, such as the Guild and Esty Cemeteries.\n\nIn the 1830‟s a new movement began to occur in America, with the establishment of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This movement is referred to as the Rural Cemetery Movement or the Garden Cemetery Movement. Cemeteries took on a garden-park like air; meandering paths were laid out, specimen trees, bushes and plants were imported and planted, ponds were dug, and cemetery monuments became grander and reflected the Greek revival and many other architectural movements that were popular among early Victorians. No longer were cemeteries just a place for the dead, now the living could enjoy them too. Approximately, ten years before this Rural Cemetery Movement, Walpole, Sharon, Wrentham and South Dedham established new cemeteries, as their ancient burying grounds were small and becoming over crowded. Like the early Colonials, these cemeteries are situated on hills, but they quickly began to reflect the Garden Movement that was so popular. These cemeteries include; Terrace Hill, Rural Cemetery and Maple Grove in Walpole, West Cemetery in Sharon, the Pondville Cemetery in Wrentham (now Norfolk), and the “New Cemetery” in South Dedham (Now “East Walpole Cemetery” in Walpole). It should be noted; Sharon, Norwood, Norfolk and Wrentham established other cemeteries about this time that are not included in this study).\n\nIn the early 1900‟s, concerned citizens in Walpole were alarmed at how the town‟s cemeteries had fallen in to disrepair, stones had fallen over, grass was uncut, and plants were either over-grown or had died. Cemeteries were privatized, and a board of directors were established at each the 4 garden-like cemeteries. These newly created boards were to over see and care for these cemeteries. They quickly cleaned up the cemeteries, many new maple trees were planted to replace dying vegetation, or to simply beautify the cemetery. The cemeteries were also, expanded by the purchasing of neighboring parcels of land. However, as the members of the board retired, it became difficult to find replacement members, and by the 1970‟s Walpole‟s cemeteries again fell into disrepair. One by one, the board of directors voted to be dissolved and to make the town of Walpole the trustee of their cemeteries. The only cemetery, which remains privately maintained, is the East Walpole Cemetery, which is care for by the Bird Family. Today only East Walpole, Terrace Hill, Maple Grove, Rural and Pondville Cemeteries are still in use, although, the town of Walpole has allowed a few burials to West Walpole neighbors in the Plains Cemetery.\n\nBlake Private Burying Ground\n\nWalpole, Massachusetts\n\nLocation: This is a small burying ground that is located off South Street, beyond the site of the Blake-Blackburn House, in the Town Forest.\n\nAncestry: Aaron Blake, b. 24 April 1730 in Wrentham, d. 3 June 1789 in Walpole was a great grandson of John Blake (1640 – 25 May 1700) and his wife Bridget (_____ – 30 May 1706). In 1686, John found his way from the Island of Monserrat to Sandwich, Plymouth Bay Colony and the same year, this family removed to Wrentham. John and Bridget settled on the shores of Blake’s Pond (Lake Archer). Their youngest son Robert settled on the home farm at Lake Archer.\n\nOthers sons Andrew and John, Jr, each lived at Stop River/Stony Brook. This land was in Wrentham until 1870 when the town of Norfolk was established from Franklin and Medway. Today, we know this area of land as the Audubon Society’s Stony Brook Nature Center.\n\nJohn, Jr.’s son James, b. 7 October 1689, d. 12 January 1765 married Ann Bullard, daughter of Samuel Bullard and Hannah Thorpe on 15 December 1714 in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Ann was born 15 January 1692 in Dedham, d. 16 December 1767 in Wrentham. There were 11 children of this union; six sons and five daughters. Of these a son Solomon, who married Abial Pond, remained at Stony Brook and in 1762, owned the saw mill at that location and Aaron who removed to Walpole and married Mehitable Ellis.\n\nFacts: Interesting facts, as well as, photos of the cemetery and dwelling house gathered by the Walpole Historical Society, Inc. follow the cemetery listing. This is just a listing of those interned.\n\nOver the years, the original were damaged, removed, stored in the Walpole Historical Society’s location and replaced with the existing ones.\n\nListing: Graves from left to right:\n\nSene Blake, daughter of Mr. Aaron and Mrs. Elizabeth Blake, died Aug. 20, 1794 in her 3rd year.\n\nMrs. Elizabeth, widow of Mr. Aaron Blake,Jr., died March 1, 1839 in her 75th year.\n\nMr. Aaron Blake, son of Mr. Aaron Blake, died April 10, 1796 in his 34th year.\n\nMr. Aaron Blake, died 3 June 1789 in his 60th year.\n\nMrs. Mehetable Blake, Relict of Mr. Aaron Blake, died 29 October 1798.\n\nComments: Aaron Blake, Sr., married Mehitable Ellis 15 April, 1756 in Walpole. Mehitable was born 12 July 1731 in Walpole the daughter of Jacob Ellis (17 March 1702/3 -) and Mehitable Guild (18 February 1707/8 – 21 June 1798). Also, Mehitable was a 2nd great grand daughter of immigrant John Guild (ca. 1616-4 October 1682.\n\nAaron Blake,Jr., married Elizabeth Clap on 28 April 1785 in Walpole. Elizabeth was born 13 November 1764 in Walpole the daughter of Seth and Mary.\n\nBoth Aaron Blake and his son Aaron were in service during the American Revolutionary War.\n\nMary M. Bates, Compiler\n\nMarch 30, 2007\n\nThe Guild Cemetery\n\nCommon Street, Walpole, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N42.1256544 W71.2333867\n\nLocation: This cemetery is located on Old Post Road, near Hawthorne Drive and near were Old Post Road merges in to Common Street.\n\nLayout/Condition: The Guild Cemetery is a small family cemetery. It is approximately 50’ long by about 100’ deep. It is surrounded by a field stone rock wall. The front wall is stone and mortar, with two granite posts flanking the entrance footpath. At one time these posts supported a rot iron gate, which can be seen in a 1917 photograph. The remaining three field stone walls have fallen into disrepair. The Guild Cemetery is a terraced cemetery, having 5 defined terraces. There is a tomb on the fourth terrace. The very top of this cemetery is the oldest part of the cemetery, and the last row of gravestones face the forest and not Old Post Road. This is due to the fact that at one time the “front” of the cemetery was on Common Street. The original granite post “entrance” can be seen, however, if one was to walk through it, they would end up in a private yard.\n\nUsage: The first burial occurred here in 1796 (Nathaniel Guild, Sr.) and the most recent was in 1985 (Agnes E. (Johnson) Dunbar).\n\nStones: There are approximately 50 headstones and about 110 people buried here. The oldest are slate tablet style, there are a few marble tablets and two marble obelisks, the newest stones are granite family stones.\n\nCemetery History: The land for this cemetery was set aside by Nathaniel Guild, Sr.and was originally on his farm. In an 1836 map of Walpole, the property is inhabited by Nathaniel and Horace Guild. In an 1878 map Charles Guild and Charles Guild, 2nd are living there.\n\nFamily/Genealogy: This is a family burial ground. Originally on the farm of Nathaniel Guild and his wife, Mary Boyden. However, there are other families represented here, the families of Baker, Billings, Hewins, Mann and Rhoads also have plots here. The Billings and Rhoads families can be directly connected to the Guild family. The Philip Hewins and Charles Mann families that have small plots here, and can be loosely connected to Nathaniel Guild’s family. (Nathaniel’s brother, Moses, married into the Manns and his daughter, Mercy, married into the Hewins, but not into the branches represented here). There is no apparent direct (or indirect) connection to the Baker Family to the Nathaniel Guild family. The Bakers came from West Walpole. Ebenezer Baker’s (17??-18??) father, Ebenezer Baker, Sr., first wife was the daughter of a Guild and his second wife was a Boyden. In fact Esther (Boyden) Baker is buried here. Perhaps she is the connection, as no one seems to know the origins of Nathaniel’s wife, Mary Boyden.\n\nGuild: Nathaniel Guild (1711-1796), was the son of Nathaniel & Mehitable (Hartshorn) Guild. He married Mary Boyden in 1733. Together they had six children; Mary (1735), Nathaniel (1739-179?), Mercy (1741), Susanna (1743-1822), Mehitable (1745-1816) and Samuel (1746-1816). The only one of their children who is buried in this cemetery is Nathaniel. Also, Mary does not appear to have a grave here.\n\nRhoads: After the death of Mary, Nathaniel married Anna (Gould) Rhoads in 1777. She was the widow of Benjamin Rhoads, Sr., and the daughter of Jeremiah Gould. (She is buried in the West Sharon “Billings” Cemetery, next to her husband and two sons). At the time of Nathaniel and Anna’s marriage, they would have had a house full of teenagers, as Anna would have brought with her 5 children; Jeremiah (17??-1802), Anna, (son, Benjamin died in 1771). Son Jeremiah, married Mehitable Coney and they were the parents of Benjamin Rhoads. Mehitable and Benjamin are buried here, along with Benjamin’s two wives, Hannah Gay and Harriet Keith, and their children; Hannah (Rhoads) Hersey, Charles E, and Francis E. and Benjamin, Jr.. Benjamin Jr., has a large marble obelisk family monument on terrace 2, buried with him is his second wife Ann McCurdy, and their children, Sarah A. Holmes, and Benjamin F., and Benjamin F.’s wife, Nellie M. Holmes. Ann McCurdy’s sister Margaret is also buried in this cemetery.\n\nBillings: Nathaniel Guild’s (1711-1796) sister, Sarah (1725) married Jonathan Billings. Their son, Jonathan Billings, Jr. (1749-1827) is buried in the Guild Cemetery along his second wife, Mary Fisher and their niece, Susanna, and sons, Hartford, Bradford and Jonathan, III. Jonathan Billings, III is in the front terrace with his wife, Betsey Tolman and two of their children, Hervey and Louisa. Guild: Nathaniel Guild, III (1739-1793), son of Nathaniel (Jr.) & Mary (Boyden) Guild, married Rebecca Hart in 1767. She was the daughter of Jacob Hart and his second wife, Sarah Farrington. (Jacob Hart’s first wife was Susanna Guild, daughter of Nathaniel & Mehitable Guild.) Nathaniel & Rebecca were the parent of 11 children; Mary (1767), Nathaniel (1769), Herman (1773), Jacob (1775), Samuel (1777), Rebecca (1779), William (1780), James (1782), Rebecca (1784), Polly (1786) and Chester (1791). Only three of their children lie with them here: Herman & his family in the tomb, Nathaniel (IV) and his family, and Polly and her husband, John Turner.\n\nWALPOLE PLAINS CEMETERY\n\nWalpole, Massachusetts\n\nLOCATION\n\nThe Plains Cemetery is on Plain Street which is off West Street in West Walpole. At the corner of West and Plain Streets there is a circle of “memorial” stones to acknowledge certain War soldiers.\n\nLt. Alex Orr Fisher Hartshorne\n\nCorp. Increase Bliffin Noah Cross\n\nPierre Bourde John Acute\n\nAlvin Clark George Bleu\n\nCorp. Jeremiah Fales Sgt. Spencer Wood\n\nHISTORY AND BACKGROUND\n\nAccording to town history, The Plains is the second oldest cemetery in Walpole. However, it is possible that it pre-dates the Old Pioneers’ Burial Place at the corner of Main and Kendall Streets. Rationale: People were buried on their properties without location identification. As early as 1650, what is now known as Walpole Plain was called “Easy Plain” and (John?) Mason and others had land there.\n\nAccording to 1722 Dedham Town Records, two years before Walpole was set off from Dedham, some “Easy Plain” inhabitants petitioned to have a second highway laid out from Thomas Clap’s by their houses to Stop River. Because few people had lots in the Old Burial Place, a piece of land about one third the size of the present Walpole Plains Cemetery was set off for burial purposes. This land was in a field between the two highways.\n\nBy the year 1800, men who were rich and influential owned the “Plain.” To meet growing demands, a large addition was made to the burial grounds on the southerly and easterly sides.\n\nIn 1905, Isaac Newton Lewis, knowing that the old families on the “Plain” were nearly all gone either by death or relocation, decided that action had to be taken to guard and preserve the cemetery from violence and possible utter destruction. He communicated with lot owners in Boston, Milton and Walpole to present his ideas. In return for their help in organizing the Walpole Plain Cemetery Association, he offered to erect and donate a receiving tomb.\n\nOn Decoration Day May 30, 1905, he conducted a meeting of all lot owners. This meeting was in the old cemetery. Attendees were descendants of many of the original inhabitants, i.e. Baker, Bird, Bonney, Bowker, Clap, Dupee, Fales, Guild, Hartshorn, Kingsbury, Lewis, Pond, Shepard, Smith, Tarbot, Ware and others. On that date the group founded and subsequently incorporated the Walpole Plain Cemetery Association.\n\nThe elected officers were\n\nIsaac Newton Lewis, President\n\nLewis K. Bowker and William F. Ware, Vice-Presidents\n\nFrank K. Bonney, Treasurer\n\nThe Elected Board of Directors were\n\nI.N. Lewis\n\nEdward L. Shepard\n\nLewis L. Bowker\n\nEugene Bonney\n\nFrank Bonney\n\nHands L. Jepson\n\nWilliam F. Ware\n\nA small portion of the southwesterly section of the cemetery was selected for the proposed receiving tomb. In addition to having the tomb built, Isaac Newton Lewis donated 34 Maple trees that were planted around the borders of the cemetery. The body of Miss Abigail Guild, daughter of Horace Guild and a relative of I.N. Lewis was the first to occupy the tomb.\n\nIn April 1962, the Town of Walpole assumed total management of the Plains Cemetery.\n\nLISTING\n\nThere appears to have been several inventories done at various times and for various reasons; each with a separate title.\n\nThe Old Plain Cemetery\n\nRecords of The Plains Cemetery\n\nInscriptions From Some Old Gravestones in The Old Plain Cemetery\n\nRecords From The West Plain Cemetery and\n\nPlan of the West Plain Cemetery\n\nAfter an extensive review and comparison of these inventories, the compiler developed a collective listing of those individuals whose stones and/or markings were identified. Using this listing, we undertook a comprehensive “walk through” to identify the grave(s) location(s).\n\nThe individual who compiled the inventory entitled “Plan of The West Plain Cemetery” noted that the eastern was/is better defined and so, started in the most eastern corner, i.e. to the right of the east gate. We communicated with a staff member of the Walpole Parks and Cemetery Department and he verified the location identification.\n\nINTERESTING NOTE\n\nA document entitled” Records from the old cemetery on Walpole Plain, Walpole, Mass” is at the New England Historic and Genealogical Society (NEHGS) in Boston, MA. This manuscript is a handwritten copy of tombstones ca. 1746-1925. The manuscript donor is/was Mrs. Jacob B. Bruce of Medfield, Mass and is dated March 12, 1931. The call number for this manuscript is Mss A 4870.\n\nMembers of NEHGS may view the manuscript at any time during normal library hours. Nonmembers need to contact the manuscript archivist for viewing arrangements.\n\nMary M.

It is approximately 3 or 4 acres. The original part of the cemetery is located on a hill. There is a mortar and stone wall along the street side, with 2 entrance gates, and a tarmac road that parallels the street just on the inside of this wall. It is possible to drive up\n\nthe side roads, but it is not recommended as these side roads are narrow, and more like footpaths. There is a receiving tomb in this older section, which is no longer in use. This older section is dotted with ancient maple trees, which makes this cemetery one of the shadiest cemeteries in town. A newer section of Maple Grove was\n\nadded in the late 1800’s / early 1900’s. It has its own (a third) entrance. This section has larger roads that can handle cars. The Maple Grove Cemetery is owned and maintained by the town of Walpole, and it is in very good condition.\n\nUsage: The first burial was 18 year old Hannah Allen in 1817, and Maple Grove is still being used today.\n\nStones: There are approximately 325 headstones contained in the oldest part of the cemetery, and there are about 800 people buried there too. There are a variety of stones in Maple Grove. Some of the older slate and marble stones are broken or eroded, but the newer granite stones are in very good condition.\n\nCemetery History: In an article published in the Walpole Star in April of 1884 said that “Maple Grove Cemetery was dedicated some 75 years ago” and mentions that the “first burials were of the family of Allen and Lewis.” This would make the dedication in about 1806, but the first burial is that of Hannah Allen in June of 1817. On her headstone if says: “She was the first hear laid, Her journey short in life she made. But she was brought to love the Lord. And clos’d her eyes to see her God.” The second burial was Abigail (Bullard) Lewis, (Dec. 1817) she was the wife of Isaac Lewis, who is believed to be a co-founder of this cemetery. In the late 1890’s or early 1900’s Isaac Newton Lewis organized and incorporated the Maple Grove Cemetery. Like his reorganization of the Plains Cemetery in 1905, his purpose must have been to prevent further decay, and to protect and maintain this Cemetery. The cemetery was enlarged in about the same time Isaac N. Lewis reorganized Maple Grove. There is an area at the top of the hill in the old section, that is designated as a Pauper’s Field. There are several people buried here in unmarked graves.\n\nAnd One More Thing: In his own family plot, Isaac Newton Lewis has erected a memorial to the Revolutionary War Veterans who came from Walpole, and locals near by. Outlining the perimeter of his plot are 44 white marble, standard government issue marker stones. The names on these stones are: Ichabod Read, Sam’l Copp, Aaron Fales, John Lewis, Benoni Morse, Nichol Harris, John Dexter, Asa Clap, Sam’l Rhoades, Jonathan Dexter, William Dunbar, Jeremiah Dexter, Bezaleel Turner, David Walker, David Turner, John Evans, Aquilla Cheney, Abel Baker, Moses Chamberlain, Anthony Brackett, Geo. Bleu, Philip Bardins, Benj. White, Sam’l Thompson, Belling Clap, Aaron Beale, Jos. Tucker, John White, Amos Turner, Geo. Cleaveland, Timothy Walker, Aaron Clap, Christopher Smith, John Cleaveland, Thos. Howard, Elihu Lawrence, Levi Cheney, Stephen Dexter, John Ellis, David Farrington, Benj. Carryl, and Elisha Lawrence. (There are two more that were too eroded to read)\n\nNorth Sharon Cemetery\n\nHigh Plain Street, Norfolk County, Sharon, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N42.14088 W 71.20965\n\nLocation: The North Sharon Cemetery is on High Plain Street in Sharon, just beyond the Walpole border. It is located about a half mile off of Route 1, and it backs up to Route 95. There is a small turn out to park a few cars and a tarmac path leads through the woods to the westerly gate.\n\nLayout/Condition: This is a small cemetery; about 110’ by 140’. It is surrounded by a fieldstone stone wall. There are two entrances in this cemetery, one from what would have been Moose Hill Road, and one at High Plain Street. An “L” shaped carriage path runs through this cemetery, making a 90 degree turn, mid-way through, connecting both entrances. The North Sharon Cemetery is owned and maintained by the town of Sharon. It is in good condition.\n\nUsage: According to the 1900 Mann transcription, the earliest burial is Ruth (Tisdale) Fuller in 1775 but her stone in gone. The earliest stand stone is Ester (Johnson) Fuller in 1799. The most rescent was Joseph A. Brown in 1904.\n\nStones: There are approximately 60 stones in this cemetery, and about 100 people buried here. Mostly of the headstones are slate and marble tablets, a few marble obelisks, and 2 newer granite family stones. Many stones are broken, eroded and it appears many are long gone. Very few of the headstones have their matching footstone.\n\nCemetery History: According to some documentation, this cemetery was established shortly before 1799. But according to a transcription that was done by Sharon residents in 1900, the stone of Mrs. Ruth Fuller, which was still in existence, puts the first burial in 1775. In 1900 this burial ground was referred to as “The Moose Hill Bural Ground”, as it was located on the corner of Walpole St. (Now called High Plain St.) and Moose Hill Road. When Route 95 was built, Moose Hill Road was divided, and there was no bridge built to connect it. Now Moose Hill Road begins in Sharon at High Plain Street, the section by this little cemetery was removed, and Moose Hill St. dead ends at Rt 95 on the Walpole side.\n\nFamilies & Genealogy\n\nSmith: The Smith families that settled in Sharon were originally from Dedham Some of the children of Isreal & Mary (Morse) Smith are buried here. He was the son of Ireal & Mary (Dean) Smith and She was the daughter of John & Mary (Guild) Morse. They married in Dedham July 12, 1753.

At least 5 of their children are here. Ellis (1790-1810), Levi (1795-1842), Molly (1797-1819), Isreal (1802-1823) and Caroline (1804-1808)\n\nLevi married Annie Creighton, they are buried here along with several of their children.\n\nDaughter, Sibel, married Nehemiah Leonard, Jr, they are not buried here, but 8 of their children are.\n\nLeonard: Nehemiah Leonard and his wife Deborah Clapp with their 7 children: Polly (1784-1865), Noah (1786), Nehemiah Jr (1789), Sophia (1789-1849), Fanny (1791-1826), Abiel (1793-1860) and Joseph (1797). Nehemiah (Sr.) was born in Norton to Abiel & Abigail (Elliot) Leonard. He married Deborah Clapp January 15, 1784 in Taunton. According to son Abiel death record she was from Hingham (or possibly Situate). They appear in the 1790 and 1800 censuses living in Mansfield. They moved to Sharon before 1810 then on to Boston by 1820, where they lived until their deaths in 1842 and 1826. They are buried here in Sharon.\n\nPolly, married Jacob Smith; 4 of their children are here.\n\nNehemiah Jr, married Sibel Smith; 8 of their children are here.\n\nSophia, married Abner House; they are here along with 8 of their children\n\nFanny, married George Leonard; she is here along with her daughter, Elvira in the House lot.\n\nOld Burial Ground\n\nMain Street, Walpole, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N 42.14954 W 71.24060\n\nOld Burial Ground Map\n\nLocation: This cemetery is located on the corner of Main Street and Kendall Street.\n\nLayout/Condition: This is a small cemetery. It is approximately 70’ by about 70’. It is encircled by a rock wall. The walls along the 2 streets are mortar and stone retaining walls, and the other 2 walls which abut private property are traditional field stone rock walls. This cemetery is maintained by the town of Walpole, and it is in good condition. All but one or two stones have fallen over, the rest remain standing. There is one burial tomb in this cemetery, which has fallen in on its self, from age, burying its occupants. This cemetery is owned and cared for by the town of Walpole, and it is in very good condition.\n\nUsage: The first burial was Mary Clap in 1714 and the last burials were in 1863; Joshua Stetson in February and Chloe Day in May.\n\nStones: There are approximately 152 headstones. Most still have their footstones. There is just under 200 people buried here. The majority of the headstones are slate tablets, and they are in very good shape. There are a few marble tablets, and one marble family stone. These stones are not in good condition, as they have eroded, and show signs of damage from pollution.\n\nCemetery History: On April 2, 1705, a “half-acre” of land was set off from the farm of Eleazer Clapp, in exchange for three acres of land on Major’s Plain, for the express purpose of using this land for a “Buryal Plas”. It is reported that in the early 1900’s after many years of neglect, an industrious cemetery care taker re-set and reorganized the headstones so they would “look better”, setting them in a largest to smallest fashion.\n\nFamilies: In this cemetery rests the remains of many of the earliest settlers of Walpole; Allen, Robbins, Clapp, Hartshorn, Smith, Fales, Blake and Kingsbury are buried in this cemetery. In 1726 there only 45 families on the tax roll, by 1765 there were 785 people living here, and by the first census the the United States, the population had tipped the scales at a little over 1000 people. Most of the earliest families have ancestors who sleep in the Old Burial Ground.\n\nTranscription Notes: This cemetery has been transcribed several times. The first known transcription was done in 1900 by Thomas A. Dickenson, which was published in the Dedham Historical Society’s Register, January 1901; vol. XII. The next known transcription was done in the late 1960’s / early 1970’s by Betty Cottrell and Frank Larrabee of the Walpole Historical Society. The third transcription was completed in 1998 by Derick Hartshorn. This fourth transcription, done in the Spring of 2006, by Laurie Kearney and Sandy Andressi, is not only a “transcription” but also included photos of each stone and corresponding notes. It compared all transcriptions, and includes notes where there are inconsistencies were found with any or all of the previous transcriptions. Also, noted were Derick Hartshorn’s “columns” delineation, which he used to help locate each stone. When standing in the cemetery, it is hard to “see” the columns, so this fourth transcription includes “grave numbers” counting from front to back, to “order” the stones. Hopefully, a visitor to this quaint cemetery, will be able to locate their ancestor!\n\nRural Cemetery\n\nPemberton Street, Walpole, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N42.15465 W71.24840\n\nLocation: The Rural Cemetery begins where Pemberton Street and North Street meet to form a Y, and continues up the hill on the Pemberton Street side.\n\nLayout/Condition: This is a large cemetery. It is sort-of triangular-with-the-pointy-top-cutoff shape. The two sides that face a road, and the third side at the top of the cemetery have a mortar and stone wall, the fourth side is open to the private properties it abuts. There is a center carriage road that begins at the bottom of the hill and runs the length of the cemetery but does not divide the 5th and newest section of the cemetery, and then there are four carriage-roads that intersect the center road, cutting this cemetery into 9 distinct sections. The town of Walpole owns and cares for this cemetery. It is always well maintain, and in very good condition.\n\nUsage: The first burial was Daniel Nason in 1793, although this could be a cenotaph, because the next two burials occurred in 1804, David Nason and 1805 Rebecca Day. This cemetery is still used today.\n\nStones: There are approximately 525 headstones listed in this transcription, and about 1030 people buried in the sections counted. Because this is such a large cemetery, there are many different kinds of headstones; from Slate and Marble tablets, and many marble and granite elaborate family monuments. They also run the gambit for condition, from very poor to excellent.\n\nCemetery History: The “North Burying Ground” was established in 1820 between North and Gill Streets. Although it appears there are a few who were buried here earlier. In 1842 a committee was formed to enlarge and improve the cemetery. In the same year they purchased 3 acres of abutting land for $75.00 from Joshua Stetson, and in 1850 they voted to complete the receiving tomb. More land was purchased in 1861 from Charles Hartshorn, Jason Ellis and E.W. Clapp, then in 1862, 1874 and 1876 the cemetery was enlarged again with 3 purchases of land from Ira Gill.\n\nTranscription Notes: This appears to be the second transcription of the Rural Cemetery. The first being done in the early 1970’s by Betty Cottrell of the Walpole Historical Society. There is appear to be a transcription in Novemeber 2000 by Dorothy Ciriello, but her location references seem to be from Betty’s typed pages, not from where stones are really located. This second transcription, by Laurie Kearney and Sandy Andressi, starts at the base of the hill, were the earliest burials are located and goes up to the 4th entrance of the cemetery, directly across from Robbins Road. There are at least 200 more headstones, and probably close to over 1000 souls more.\n\nTerrace Hill Cemetery\n\nSouth Street, South Walpole, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N42.10739 W 71.25827\n\nLocation: The Terrace Hill Cemetery is located on Washington Street and South Street, where South St. Y’s off of Washington Street in South Walpole, near the Boyden Elementary School.\n\nLayout/Condition: The Terrace Hill Cemetery is one of the largest cemeteries in Walpole. The oldest section, which is the focus of this transcription project, sits on the South Street side of the road, behind the Jackson Memorial Chapel. It is encircled by a mortar and rock retaining wall. There are two carriage paths that provide an entrance to this part of the cemetery. One on the left, it totally over grown, mostly with poison ivy, it leads around to the back side of this cemetery. The right-side carriage path leads up the hill, and down the other side to the back of the cemetery. There are a series of foot paths that intersect these carriage paths. The cemetery well cared for, and is owned and maintained by the town of Walpole.\n\nUsage: The earliest burials were Mary Smith and Hannah Bacon, in March and April of 1780. This cemetery has a large new addition which is still in usage today.\n\nStones: There are approximately 400 stones in the oldest part of this cemetery and about 860 people buried there. The oldest stones are slate or marble tablet stones, only a few still have their matching footstones. These stones are in fair condition, and show the signs of age due to weathering, erosion and pollution. There are a few marble family monuments, they too are quite eroded. At the top of the hill are many tall and elaborate granite family monuments, which are in excellent condition.\n\nCemetery History: Although the earliest burials occurred here in early 1780, this cemetery was not officially established until 1784 for those who lived in the village of South Walpole. Jonathan Boyden sold one-quarter of an acre on October 22, 1784 to some citizens of South Walpole for L1:15:0 to be used for a burying place. When the Methodist Church was established in South Walpole in 1830, they took an interest in this local cemetery and took care of it for many years. Many of their early members are buried there.\n\nIn 1808 Benjamin Mann sold one quarter of an acre to the South School District. This land is where, in 1905 the Jackson Memorial Chapel was built by Alfred Jackson as a memorial to his family. It seats 40 people and is heated by a fireplace. It is now boarded up and is not in use. Also constructed, about this same time (1904) (and not in this transcription) was the Blake Mausoleum.\n\nThis cemetery was privately operated until the early 1970’s when the town of Walpole took over ownership.\n\nWalpole Plains Cemetery\n\nPlain Street, West Walpole, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N42.13815 W71.28311\n\nPlains Cemetery photo\n\nLocation: The Plains Cemetery is on Plain Street which is off West Street in West Walpole.\n\nLayout/Condition: This is the second oldest cemetery in Walpole. It is approximately 200′ long by 60′ wide. It is surrounded by a stone wall. On the street side, this wall is mortar and rock, with two entrance gates. The other three sides are field stone rock walls. This cemetery has two distinct sections, the old and the new. The Plains Cemetery is owned and cared for by the town of Walpole. The over all condition of this cemetery is good.\n\nUsage: The first recorded burial is Deborah Smith, in 1731. (Although it is possible others were buried here before the 1731 date). This cemetery is still being used today, but very few interments have happened in the last 50 years. Mostly people who live in West Walpole request to be buried there.\n\nStones: There are approximately 150 headstones in this cemetery, and there is over 300 people buried here. In the oldest sections (10, and 9) near the receiving tomb, the headstones are mostly slate tablets. Only a very few of these stones still have their corresponding footstones. In the center sections (8, and 7) headstones are a mix of slate and marble tablets and a few elaborate family monuments too. They are mostly in fair condition, as they show the ravages of time through erosion. In the newest sections (6, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1) most of the stones are large granite family monuments.\n\nCemetery History: The Plains is the second oldest cemetery in Walpole. A small section (section 10 and 9) is believed to have been set aside for a burial place as early as the 1720’s. Residents of West Walpole, either did not own plots in the Old Burial Place (on corner of Kendall and Main), or felt it was too far away, and requested land in West Walpole, the “Plains”. The piece of land that was chosen was located in a field between two main roads. Today’s Plain Street now connects those roads, and undoubtedly was the path cut into the ground by those heading to this cemetery.\n\nIn May of 1803, shortly after a new road had been agreed to be built from Thomas Clap’s to Stop River (Lincoln St.), this cemetery was enlarged, to meet growing demands. An addition of about 60 rods (sections 8, 7, 6 and 5) was made to the burial grounds on the southerly and easterly sides, but mostly easterly. Residents of West Walpole paid Seth Clarke $13.00 for this land. This “sale” is recorded in the Norfolk County Deeds on April 27, 1807 (bk. 28 pg 10). The names on the “bill of sale” are: Ezekiel Boyden, Samuel Boyden, John Boyden, Seth Clarke, Joshua Clap, Oliver Clap, James Dupee, Aaron Fales, Samuel Guild, Nathan Kingsbury, Jacob Kingsbury, William Kingsbury, Seth Kingsbury, Daniel Kingsbury, Otis Partridge, Henry Partridge, Nathan Pond, Jr. Asa Smith, Moses Smith, Jr., Henry Smith, Royal Smith, Samuel Smith, Sr., and Samuel Smith, Jr. On December 31, 1883, the estate of Jeremiah Hartshorn, sold to the town of Walpole for $1, ??? acres of land, to expand the Plains Cemetery (bk 553, pg 98). Bring the Plains Cemetery to its present size (Sections 4, 3, 2, and 1). However, this last land addition extends the size of this property to the edge of West Street, where the Revolutionary War Memorial is located.\n\nIn 1905, Isaac Newton Lewis concerned with the decay of this cemetery, formed the Walpole Plain Cemetery Association. He communicated with many of the descendants of those buried in the Plains, seeking their help, and in return, he offered to erect and donate a receiving tomb. A spot in the southwesterly section of the cemetery was selected for the receiving tomb. In addition to having the tomb built, Isaac Newton Lewis, donated 34 Maple trees that were planted around the borders of the cemetery. In April,1962, the Town of Walpole assumed total management of the Plains Cemetery.\n\nTranscription Notes: Other names for this cemetery are “The Old Plain Cemetery,” “The Plains Cemetery”, and “West Plains Cemetery”. There have been several transcriptions over the years of this cemetery. The earliest, we have found, was done in the late 1920’s, called “The Records of the Old Cemetery on Walpole Plains,” and can now be found at the New England Historical and Genealogical Society. The second, was complied in the late 1960’s – early 1970’s by Betty Cottrell and Frank Larrabee of the Walpole Historical Society. The most current transcription was completed in the Fall of 2006, by Laurie Kearney and Sandy Andressi. Care was taken to compare other transcriptions. Also photos and descriptions were taken of all the stones.\n\nAnd One More Thing: At the corner of West and Plain Streets, Isaac N. Lewis erected a circle of “memorial” stones to acknowledge American Revolutionary War soldiers. The soldiers were from the West Walpole neighborhood. (which also included some men from Franklin, now Norfolk), the names on these stones are: Lt. Alex Orr, Fisher Hartshorne, Corp. Increase Bliffin, Noah Cross, Pierre Bourde, John Acute, Alvin Clark, George Bleu, Corp. Jeremiah Fales and Sgt. Spencer Wood.\n\nWest Sharon Cemetery\n\na.k.a. The Billings Cemetery\n\nSouth Main Street, Norfolk County, Massachusetts\n\nGPS: N 42.09494 W71.22168\n\nLocation: This cemetery is in the southwestern side of Sharon, near the Foxboro line. It is on South Main Street in Sharon, about ¼ mile from Rte 95, and across from a shopping plaza, and over-looking a cranberry bog.\n\nLayout/Condition: This cemetery is surrounded by a stone wall, and is cared for by the Town of Sharon. The cemetery is basically rectangular in shape, except for one of the “sides” is a semi-circle. This is the oldest section (G & F), from this point, one can see that this cemetery was founded on top a steep hill. A newer section (A & B) was added in the early 1800’s. This section now serves as the main entrance to the cemetery via South Main Street. An iron gate is chained shut to prevent vehicles from drive into this burial ground, but one can easily access this cemetery on foot. This cemetery is owned and maintained by the town of Sharon, and it is in fair condition.\n\nThis cemetery is divided up into 6 sections, by a carriage path, and several foot paths. Sections A and B run front to back and are separated by a carriage path. All the stones in these two sections face the street. Section C runs parallel to South Main St, and Sections D, E, F & G are in the back in 4 “squares”, (Note: there appears to be no burials in Section E). All the stones in Sections C thru G face the carriage path. Most of front of Section A is the Morse Family Section, the back of Section A is Billings family relations. Most of the front of Section B is the Clapp family section, and the back of Section B has some Billings relations. Most of Sections C thru G are the Billings Family. (Although, there are several instances where Clapps married Billings and Morses married Billings, there are no direct burials here to link these families together.)\n\nUsage: First burial was Ebenezer Billings, in 1717/8. The most recent burial was in 1913.\n\nStones: There are approximately 130 headstone in this cemetery, and about 160 people buried here. Most of the headstones are slate tablet, about half still have their corresponding footstone. There are a few marble tablets, and a very few granite family monuments. The majority of the stones in this cemetery are in fair to good condition. They show signs of damage from pollution, time and neglect.\n\nCemetery History: Ebenezer Billings gave the land for this burial ground, and he was the first person to be buried here. Although, this cemetery was originally referred to as “The Dudley Hill Cemetery” and in recent years as “The Billings Cemetery”, and there are many members of this family here, this cemetery is also the final resting place for several other early Norfolk County Families; Clapp, Fairbanks, Hewins, Holmes, Rhoads and Talbot.\n\nGenealogy:\n\nBillings: The first burial here is that of Ebenezer Billings (1655-1717/8).
