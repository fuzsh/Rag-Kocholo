        "text": "Charles Augustus Mitchell, Jr. passed away peacefully on March 1, 2022.\n\nFuneral services will be at 2 P.M., Saturday, March 19, 2022 at Lawson Funeral Home in Meridian. Burial will be in the Mitchell Cemetery in Iredell. Visitation will be from Noon until service time on Saturday, March 19, 2022 also at Lawson Funeral Home.\n\nCharles was born on August 24, 1938, in the town of Iredell, TX. He spent many of his boyhood days fishing in the Bosque River that meandered thru his family farm. After High School graduation, Charles joined the Air Force and was stationed in Oklahoma. It was during this time that he met and married the love of his life, Louise Watson. They were married on October 15, 1960, and made their first home in Dallas, TX. It was there that they had their three children, Chuck, Debbie and Cindy. The family would eventually move to Irving, TX in 1971. It was in Irving that Charles worked as the DP Operations Manager and President of the Credit Union at Darr Equipment. He worked for 40+ years at Darr Equipment until his retirement. After his retirement, he fulfilled his lifelong dream of moving back to Iredell, TX to live out his golden years with Louise on the family farm. Charles was an avid fisherman most of his life, and he loved all things outdoors. In his retirement years he became quite the antique buff. Charles and Louise spent many days going to Antique Stores throughout Texas. We would be remiss if we didn’t mention that there was also an incredibly special place in his heart for all the four-legged creatures of the world. Charles never met a dog that wasn’t his best friend.\n\nCharles is predeceased by his father, Charles Augustus Mitchell, Sr and his mother Doris Ila Brown Mitchell.\n\nCharles is survived by his loving wife of 61 years, Wilma Louise Watson Mitchell. Charles is also survived by his sisters, Doris Bernhardt of Bedford, TX and Ethel Scruggs and husband Troy Scruggs of DeSoto, TX.\n\nCharles was a devoted father and is survived and lovingly remembered by his son, Charles Augustus Mitchell III and his wife Bettina Lynn Mitchell of Arlington, TX. His daughter, Debra Lynn Mitchell Johnston and her husband James Edward Johnston of Irving, TX. His daughter Cynthia Ann Mitchell Free and her husband Matthew Douglas Free of Iredell, TX.\n\nCharles adored and worshipped all his grandchildren and great grandchildren, and he will forever be cherished and remembered by them: Christina Amber Reid, Lauren Elizabeth Branch and her husband Ryan Neal Branch, Jacob Patrick Reid and his wife Laura Ann Valerie Reid, Jessica Ashley Reid Lalla, Ms. Stefani Mitchell and Gunnar Lampe, Thomas Mitchell Free and his wife Marisa Echovarri-Free and Phillip Matthew Free and his wife Destinee Kittrell-Free. Great grandchildren: Mason Reid Couch, Thomas James Couch, Charles Frank Couch, Liliana Nicole Reid, Zoe Elizabeth Reid, Jacob James Reid, Nicolas Allen Reid, Madison Elizabeth Branch, Lindsey Taylor Branch and Wyatt Neal Branch.\n\nArrangements were entrusted to Lawson Funeral Home, Meridian, Texas 254-435-2792."
