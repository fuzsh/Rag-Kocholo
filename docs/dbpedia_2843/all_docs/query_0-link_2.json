        "text": "United States historic place in Rhode Island\n\nThis article is about the cemetery in Rhode Island. For the cemetery in Massachusetts, see North Burial Ground (Fall River, Massachusetts).\n\nUnited States historic place\n\nNorth Burial Ground\n\nShow map of Rhode Island\n\nShow map of the United States\n\nLocationProvidence, Rhode IslandBuilt1700NRHP reference No.77000003 [1]Added to NRHPSeptember 13, 1977\n\nThe North Burial Ground is a 110-acre (0.45 km2) cemetery in Providence, Rhode Island dating to 1700, the first public cemetery in Providence.[2] It is located north of downtown Providence, bounded by North Main Street, Branch Avenue, the Moshassuck River, and Cemetery Street. Its main entrance is at the junction of Branch and North Main. The burial ground is one of the larger municipal cemeteries in Southern New England, and it accepts 220 to 225 burials per year.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nFrom the time of its founding by Roger Williams in 1636, Rhode Island had strict separation of religious and government institutions. Therefore, Providence had no state churches with adjacent public burial grounds, as most New England towns had. Instead, townspeople buried their dead in family plots on individual farms.[3]\n\nIn 1700, a town vote was held to establish a municipal cemetery. This cemetery was to be open to the deceased of all faiths, from millionaires to paupers, and even emancipated slaves. 45 acres were set aside; 10 acres were to be used for a cemetery, the remainder for a town common and militia training ground. However, the first official burial didn't take place until one Samuel Whipple was buried here in 1710/11. There were only about one or two burials per year until 1736, when 14 people were buried.[3]\n\nBy the mid-1800s, under the influence of the Rural Cemetery Movement, cemeteries generally became viewed as a place for the general public to enjoy refined outdoor recreation. In Providence, the North Burial Ground was further landscaped. More land was added, along with curving roads and trees, to make the grounds more attractive to the living.[3]\n\nNotable interments\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Category:Burials at North Burying Ground (Providence)\n\nNorth Burial Ground has the burials of many notable Rhode Island residents, including governors, members of Congress, soldiers, millionaires, emancipated slaves, and literary figures:\n\nDaniel Abbott, deputy governor of Rhode Island colony[citation needed]\n\nPhilip Allen, Governor of Rhode Island and U.S. Senator[4]\n\nZachariah Allen, prominent Providence mill owner and civic leader[5]\n\nWilliam B.
