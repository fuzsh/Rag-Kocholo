        "text": "CUMBERLAND COUNTY ILLINOIS CEMETERIES\n\n(Transcribed from the Genealogy Society book published by the Genealogy Society covering the years 1843 - 1993)\n\nCumberland County has over 73 known cemeteries and burial grounds. Many of the cemeteries are overgrown and in terrible condition. Some have not been used in over 50 years. Many are on private property, always ask permission to visit them.\n\nThere were several family cemeteries registered with the state that I was unable to locate or find anything out about. They were:\n\n1. Center Cemetery *1921E registered with State November 21, 1949, in Sumpter Township. Family by the name of True are buried there.\n\n2. Copperas, *2433 registered September 12. 1950, Neoga Township.\n\n3. Curns, Sumpter Township. The state archives list a veteran David Beals buried there.\n\n4. Downey, Neoga Township.\n\n5. Indian Hill, Sumpter Township.\n\n6. Kemper, Union Township, *787, registered March 16, 1948.\n\nI did not include the story of the County Farm Cemetery. It is located in the 1968 History Book on page 201.\n\nIn the 1960s, an extraordinary group of volunteers spent untold hours walking through these cemeteries recording the names on the stones. They had the information printed. It is available at the Greenup Library, The State Archives, and many public and genealogical libraries throughout the state.\n\nA full listing of all veterans buried in the county is available from The State Archives in Springfield. I have tried to be as accurate as possible. I thank all the people who have helped me with this project.\n\nALLISON CEMETERY - WOODBURY TOWNSHIP\n\nGRAVE SITE OF CUMBERLAND COUNTY PIONEERS\n\nThese graves are obscure evidence of one family's grief. This father and two daughters have been here since 1839. Even before the county was formed, and still settled by Indians. They were lying there through the Civil War, peacefully oblivious to the terrible tragedy around them then, and through the years of World War that followed. They lie just off the highway, four miles west and about 100 yards south of Jewett.\n\nThe mother's first name started with the letter \"A.\" On the children's stones it is \"daughter of J W and A Allison.\" This little family graveyard is located on the Aleshire properly west of Woodbury, Illinois. There were four or five stones at one time, they are all gone but three and they are all of one family. It's thought they died of Cholera. Agha Allison, daughter of J. W. and A., Died June 20, 1839, age 1 year and 4 months. Mary Allison, daughter of J. W. and A., died July 7, 1839, age 16. James W. Allison, died July 14, 1839, age 43.\n\nBELL CEMETERY - UNION TOWNSHIP\n\nBell Cemetery - Union Township) is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130. Go north approximately four miles to the Greenup Gravel Pit Road. Turn left, go to the Clear Creek Church, then right until you come to the cemetery. It's on the right side of the road.\n\nIt is a large, well kept cemetery, strongly fenced and still in use.\n\nElijah Walters came to north Cumberland County from the Oblong, Illinois area, and on March 18, 1850 bought 160 acres. The land office was still at Palestine, Illinois.\n\nOn a gentle slope to the cast, was a small pioneer burial ground. Mr. Walters gave this acre of ground for a burying place, and another acre for a school. Many years later the school was moved and the acre was assimilated into the cemetery site.\n\nJust to the south of the site lived a family by the name of Bell, and the name Bell became associated with the cemetery. Although it is an incorporated plat and officially the name is Walters, it has never been known by this name, and Bell it remains to this day.\n\nThere are five Civil War Veterans buried here, also veterans of later wars.\n\nBERRY CEMETERY - SUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located about two miles west of Toledo, Illinois, on the right - north) side of the highway. It's on a hill above the road and difficult to see coming from the east. I was told three of the Berry brothers gave the first land, Nelson and John. My informant could not remember the third. Colonel Oran Young extended the cemetery on the east side in the 1930s. There has never been a charge for burials however I'm told the cemetery is full. Early grave stones date back to the 1840s. In 1930 John Kelly donated a white wrought iron arch over the drive in memory of his wife, Sarah, laid to rest on August 10, 1929.\n\nMT. ZION OR BLOCK CEMETERY - GREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThe cemetery is located south of Greenup, Illinois. Take Route *130 to the Hazel Dell road, turn left - east) until you come to the church and cemetery.\n\nIn 1889 Jonathan and Rachel Eveland gave one half acre of land for a church. Trustees were William Wade, James Eveland and Joseph Eveland.\n\nJonathan Eveland died in 1894 and was buried in the Paul Cemetery. There was no cemetery by the church at this time.\n\nUlysses and Mary Jane Walden bought the surrounding land from the Eveland family on January 31, 1903. They realized the need for a cemetery and donated land behind the church for that purpose. The cemetery was platted August 25, 1905.\n\nGeorge Henry Eveland passed away July 26, 1905 and was the first person buried in the new cemetery.\n\nIn 1915 Robert Glenn left the sum of one hundred - $100.00) dollars in his will. \"Said amount to be deposited at the Greenup National Bank in the name of the trustees. Said amount to be used in keeping fences and cemetery in repair.\" In those days there was no township care .\n\nKeith Walden donated more ground in 1963 enlarging the cemetery to about two acres. It is an attractive and well kept cemetery.\n\nI have been told the name \"Block\" goes back to the early 1800s, when a log block house was built just a little north of where the church is located now. In those days there were no roads, only trails. The old block house has been gone and forgotten for more than a hundred years, but the name Block is still with us.\n\nBOOTS, NORTHWAY OR WARMAN CEMETERY\n\nThis old family cemetery is located near Greenup on the David Cook Farm. Go east three miles from Greenup, north across 1-70, then west about three-fourths mile, and south to the woods. It's very difficult to find. It's on a hill along a ravine.\n\nIt's an old burial ground, and it's thought there have been no new graves since 1900. Long ago there was a nice fence around the plot, but this has rusted away. Once there were 25 or 30 graves, but not that many stones. Names were mainly Boots, Bootes, Northway, Gerard and Gross. The oldest inscription was Bartus G. Boots, Died December 17, 1853. Age 65 years.\n\nBRIGHT CEMETERY - GREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 121, cross the river and go under 1-70. Turn right across the river bottom, north to the river hill over two ridges, then east on a field road to the woods. It's in the edge of the timber, on what at one time was the old Bright Farm. The last of the family was Bill Bright and a sister. They have both been dead many years.\n\nThe cemetery is overgrown with brush and trees, most of the stones have fallen over and are broken.\n\nThe grave of Cumberland County's only Revolutionary War Veteran, James Ryan is here, but the stone has been removed for safe keeping, and set in the Ryan Family Cemetery.\n\nOther stones tabulated in 1968 are :\n\nOlmsted, Adeline M. Wife of B. B. Olmsted, Died May 2, 1857;\n\nGarret, Susan, Daughter of G. W. & C. A. Garret, Died Oct. 2, 1849;\n\nWinngham, Thomas, Died Oct. 1851;\n\nWilliam A., son of A. and E. J. Paul, Died November 10, 1854.\n\nNo doubt there are many stones buried under the leaves and grass. This was a fair sized cemetery at one time.\n\nEast from the cemetery through the woods is an Indian Burial Ground. The graves have all been desecrated.\n\nBRUSH CREEK CEMETERY - SPRING POINT TOWNSHIP\n\nThe cemetery is located seven miles west of Toledo, Illinois, on Route *121 to the curve. Turn left - south) two miles, then right - west) about one mile. Just as you come to the top of the hill, on the left - south) side of the road is a stone marker with the cemetery name. Turn left down a short lane.\n\nYou come to the new section first. This is the James P. Baker addition. The old pioneer section is on the east side of the cemetery. The old graveyard has a very interesting shape, following the crest of the hill in a gentle curve. There are many unusual old tombstones. It's the largest collection of old stones I've seen in the many cemeteries that I have visited. One is a large boulder with the family names carved on the face. I found very few unmarked graves, which is also unusual in an old cemetery.\n\nBUCHANAN CEMETERY\n\nThe Buchanan Cemetery is located two and one half miles north of Neoga, Illinois, on the Old Buchanan Farm. Access to the cemetery is by foot across a field that has several rows of pine trees leading east from the township road back to the cemetery. It sits upon a slight hill above Bush Creek.\n\nOne of the earliest graves is that of Elizabeth J., wife of John B. Buchanan, died October 7, 1860.\n\nThere are two Civil War veterans and a Veteran of the War of 1812 buried here. All the soldiers' graves have government stones.\n\nLouis Buchanan told this story of Captain Buchanan's death:\n\nCaptain W. W. Buchanan and a friend were leaving for Springfield, Illinois, to receive their mustering out papers. Captain Buchanan was leading his horse out of the barn when the horse kicked, striking Captain Buchanan in the head killing him.\n\nThe cemetery is surrounded by a good chain link fence with a lone cedar tree sitting in the middle among the stones.\n\nCARSON CEMETERY - GREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nLocated near Greenup, Illinois, south of the elevator, under the Pennsylvania Railroad underpass about one-fourth mile, make a right turn, about one-eighth mile.\n\nIt's a family burial ground, on land purchased in 1837 by Daniel Carson.\n\nThere are 15 stones, the first burial was the little daughter of David and Margarette Carson. The mother, Margarette, died soon after and was buried beside the little girl.\n\nThe cemetery is still being used, with the last grave of Carrie Carson, February 2, 1975.\n\nState Archives list two Civil War Veterans.\n\nCHEZEM CEMETERY - WOODBURY TOWNSHIP\n\nThis is a small family burial ground, located two and one-fourth miles south of Jewell, Illinois, then one-half mile east and north in the woods. It would be hard to find without help. It's on the farm belonging lo Mr. and Mr*. Lee Sower*.\n\nThere are no stones left standing and it has almost disappeared in the brush and weeds. In the 1970s when the cemeteries were tabulated, several stones could still be read. They were as follows:\n\nChezem, John D., Born November 13, 1806 - Died November 12, 1876;\n\nChezem, John, Son of J.D. & Anna. Born June 4, 1830 - Died October 18, 1882;\n\nChezem, Mary, Daughter of Henry & Mary. Born February 28. 1871 -Died September 9, 1884;\n\nChezem. Rosanna, Daughter of Henry & Mary, Born December 26. 1870- Died July 12. 1871;\n\nChezem. Charles II, Son of Henry & Mary. Born January 19. 1875 - Died February 5. 1875.\n\nThe Chezem family moved away from the farm after the death of George Chezem, Died April 14, 1924. He i* buried in the Greenup Cemetery. His wife, Clarissa, moved to Terre Haute, Indiana and lived the rest of her life with n daughter, Nora. Other members of the family moved to Springfield, Greenup and Terre Haute. Indiana. I doubt that the descendants know there is an old family cemetery.\n\nCONCORD CEMETERY\n\nConcord is located four and one-half miles northwest of Neoga, Illinois, just south of the pavilion on Lake Mattoon and north of the marina.\n\nIt has a good fence surrounding it and a marker stating it was the \"Former site of the Primitive Baptist Church built in 1884.\"\n\nThere are many stones with the name of \"Ellis or Crose.\" Five Civil War veterans are buried here.\n\nCROSSING CEMETERY\n\nCrossing is located one mile north of Neoga, Illinois, on the Lake Road, then one-half mile east. It is about three-eighths mile west of the ICGRR track.\n\nMany years back a former land owner began to remove the stones so he could farm the land. He was stopped by concerned citizens and a small area was enclosed in a chain link fence.\n\nThe Crossing School was just east of the cemetery.\n\nLouis Buchanan of Neoga, Illinois, attended school here in the early 1900s. He remembers being told Indians were buried in the cemetery.\n\nWinifred Buchanan Bingaman of Neoga, Illinois, walked past the cemetery on her way to Crossing School in the early 1900s. Winifred said, \"She always understood that Indians were buried there.\" She remembers some of the stones in the cemetery as being about four feet high with an arch-like top sitting on a small base or the ground.\n\nToday inside the well-kept fenced area are a few stones still lying in the southwest corner, the only reminder that this is the final resting place of so many who now lie in unmarked graves.\n\nCUTRIGHT CEMETERY - UNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Cutright Cemetery is located in Union Township and has the distinction of having had three names, Redman, Herr and the present, Cutright.\n\nIt's located north of Greenup, Illinois. Take Route 130 to the Union Center road, turn right to Union Center. At Union Center turn right and go one mile south, then left - east) for one-half mile, right again - south) one-fourth mile, to a crushed rock drive, turn right - west) and straight ahead to the cemetery.\n\nJohn Cutright came to this area from Ohio in 1838 buying 1,000 acres of land south of Union Center. The old Cutright homestead sat southeast of the little Cutright burial ground.\n\nThe first graves were of babies and small children buried on a hilltop in the woods. As time passed other settlers died and were buried here.\n\nLater the land came into the possession of the Redman family. The name Cutright faded away and it became known as the Redman burial place. In 1880, the cemetery came into the hands of the Herr family and soon the fickle-minded community changed the name to Herr, though no Herr burials were ever made there.\n\nMr. Hughes, a veteran of the War of 1812, lies buried in the northeast corner of the cemetery with nothing but a broken piece of stone to mark his grave. There are no Hughes stones in the cemetery, apparently the family moved away.\n\nThis is a quiet and restful cemetery, certainly well worth visiting.\n\nThere are three Civil War veterans buried here and one veteran of the War of 1812. Amos Cutright provided the information for this article.\n\nDAVIDSON CEMETERY\n\nUnion Township is located east of Greenup, Illinois, on the farm of Leonard Robey. Take Route 40 to the Pleasant Valley Church, turn left - north one mile. Then left - west to a T-road, turn right - north one-fourth mile until you come to a field road. Left - west) it is about one-fourth mile to the woods on the north side of the lane. Do not attempt to drive the field road in wet weather.\n\nThe cemetery was apparently established by the first land owner, James McKnight. In 1844, he buried a child here, later his wife and two more children. The community also used the burial ground, John Reed buried two children and there were other burials.\n\nLater McKnight sold the land and through the years the little cemetery had several owners and continued to be used by all.\n\nWhen Daniel Davidson bought the farm, he spread the word there would be no more burials in his cemetery. When a member of the community died and the neighboring men gathered to dig the grave, Davidson tried to use force to prevent them from digging the grave. He was overpowered and the work continued.\n\nNext came a lawsuit by the community to prevent Davidson from disturbing the graves or interfering with further burials. They won. Davidson then appealed to the State Supreme Court of Illinois, but was ruled against and the little cemetery remained.\n\nA few years later Mrs. Davidson passed away and was buried in the hated graveyard.\n\nOne story told about Davidson was that he was so fearful of not having a tombstone for his grave that he bought one and kept it crated in his home for the time he would need it. In October 1899, Davidson died suddenly and his funeral was held in Pleasant Valley Church. He was buried in his cemetery.\n\nA few stones were found when the cemetery was tabulated in 1968, but Daniel Davidson's stone was not among them. What happened to it, no one knows.\n\nOne Civil War veteran lies buried here, just 18 years old. Christian B. Rissler, D. April 1, 1864. His stone is still standing. Other names known buried here are Bryan, Fritts, McKnight, Reed and Collins. Many stones are gone - there were probably 15 to 20 at one time.\n\nOnce the cemetery was on a road, but the road was closed long ago. The cemetery was never used after Davidson's death. His wish came true after all.\n\nInformation from Marion Kuhn\n\nDECKER CEMETERY - UNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThis is a small family cemetery located north of Greenup, Illinois. Take Route 130 to the Union Center Road. Turn right - east) and drive to the second road on your right. Go down this road about one-half mile until you cross a concrete bridge. The cemetery lane is on your left between the bridge and a hill. There are several large sycamore trees in the field by the lane. It is about one-fourth mile to the cemetery. I advise walking.\n\nOriginally this was the old George Decker farm and belonged to the Decker family for several generations. It is now the John Graves farm. He continues to care for the cemetery and maintains the lane. Visitors are always welcome to the cemetery. Names on some of the stones are Decker, Bracken, Coleman,\n\nEdwards, Handley, Matheny, Michael and Warmon. The last burial was Ella Rodebough Decker 1969.\n\nDRUMMOND CEMETERY\n\nDrummond Cemetery is located five miles west, then two and one-half miles north and one-half mile west of Toledo, Illinois.\n\nBen Drummond was the founder of the cemetery. It is told that a Price family had a son die and Benjamin told the father to go to the knoll behind his house and step off a place and this would be used as a burying place. This was William Scott Price, two days old, January 23, 1853; his mother, Mary Price, was the second person on April 12, 1853. A new addition was added on the south side of the drive about 1926. In 1926, a monument was erected at the entrance to the old part with this wording, \"Endowment to be invested in Federal or Municipal bonds, interest only to be used. Endowments: Ann Downey, S600; G. W. Miller, 8500; Isaac Croy, S300; J. W. Miller, $550; I. M. McPherson, $300; Small Gifts, $300.\"\n\nThere are many Civil War soldiers buried here. The cemetery is well maintained with a good rock road running through the older part. There are and were many trees throughout the old part, but these are slowly beginning to disappear. There are woods along the north and west side giving shade and lending a quiet, peaceful feeling while one is visiting the cemetery. The Mt. Zion Baptist Church is to the east of the newest addition.\n\nDUCK POND CEMETERY\n\nCROOKED CREEK TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located east of Greenup, Illinois. Take Route 40 to the Valley Church, turn south one mile, then right - west) on a private drive to the top of the hill.\n\nOriginally this was land belonging to a pioneer, Walter Ruffner. At the bottom of the hill is low, bottom land, now well drained and farmed. But long ago this was under water the year around and a stopping place for wild ducks and geese that nested here. The area was called Duck Pond.\n\nNeighbors of the Ruffners were the Fancher family. One day Nehemiah Fancher was deer hunting when he happened to climb to the top of this hill. Imagine his surprise to find a clearing, bare of all trees and brush, surrounded by tall trees, overlooking the pond below.\n\nSoon after this in 1850, a Fancher son died and the father asked permission to bury him on top of the hill. Mr. Ruffner offered to deed the hilltop to the community as permanent burial ground and the Duck Pond Cemetery began.\n\nIt isn't a very large cemetery, but it is fenced and well kept.\n\nThe earliest stone reads: \"Alvy Fancher, son of Nehemiah and Sarah. Died November 10, 1850, age 16 years, 1 month, 28 days.\"\n\nAlthough the lots have all been taken, there is an occasional burial here. The last was that of Jesse Denney, August 16, 1954.\n\nInformation from Bill Brussell\n\nELLIOTT CEMETERY\n\nIt is located in the northeast corner of Spring Point Township. The land was owned by a Thomas Elliott - 1819-1898). The cemetery is located on a hill, the west side being very steep. It is off the township road to the southeast. A road now runs around and through the east side. The east side is a new addition being bought from Warren Croy for expansion. At one time it was completely fenced, but now only has a fence on the farm land to the east and south. The earliest stones show the following: Peter W. Elliott, CO.B. 97 ILL. INF. - 1829-1878) and Harriette M. Stierwalt, Dau. of K. and M. L. Stierwalt, Died July 2, 1873.\n\nThere are six Civil War veterans with stones in this cemetery. There may be more buried here as many graves are without markers. Over the years many stones have become destroyed by livestock, vandalism and weather.\n\nAs a child and adult I was with my Grandfather Decker when he would tell of the people buried here and would point out their graves. They did not have markers or only a rock or brick to mark their graves. He always worried about this. I now wish I had paid more attention and could remember the names.\n\nTHE ELLIOTT GHOST\n\nMy Grandfather Decker always spoke of the ghost at Elliott Cemetery.\n\nWhen I was first married, we lived about one-half mile north of the cemetery and as I had heard the story many times, I again asked Grandpa about it. I had also heard older neighbors and family members talk about the ghost. One story was to have been told by Grandpap Hall. I am not sure when this was supposed to have taken place as he died in 1944.\n\nGrandpap Hall's brother was going past the Elliott Cemetery and saw the ghost. Grandpap's brother ran and ran and the ghost was right behind. They came to a fence and Grandpap's brother jumped upon the fence. The ghost jumped up beside him and said, \"Pretty good race wasn't it.\" Grandpap Hall's brother answered, \"Yes, and we'll have another just as soon as I catch my wind.\"\n\nGrandpa Decker always told of the mysterious things that happened in connection with Josh Elliott who was possessed by a ghost. He lived one-half mile north and one-fourth mile west of the cemetery. Grandpa Decker said stories were written up, but he didn't know by whom or where they were published. People came up from St. Louis to see the happenings. Josh Elliott's daughter and son-in-law were the victims of many of the incidents. They were married in 1918. The ghost apparently didn't like Josh's son-in-law, Johnny. A flat iron would follow him around just behind his head and he would duck and the iron would fly on by. Johnny once took the flat iron with him on his way to Montrose and threw it in a ditch. The iron was back home when he got back later. Most incidents seemed to take place after dark or after they had gone to bed. One night a buggy fifth wheel rolled across the bed Johnny and his wife were in. Objects would fly across the room hitting the walls. The lights would go out and the door would open and close. A rocking chair would rock when no one was sitting in it. Grandpa Decker was present at the death of Josh Elliott in 1920. He had shot himself and lived several days. Grandpa said Josh died a terrible death. Grandpa described the bed shaking and rattling. As Josh died, Grandpa Decker said, \"The bed springs played a tune.\" I understood Grandpa as saying this was because the ghost didn't want to die and he would die when Josh did. Grandpa Decker believed this is what did happen upon the death of Josh as there were no more mysterious happenings after that.\n\nAnother incident was of a man, I believe it was a friend or neighbor, staying overnight. After everyone had gone to bed, the noises began. It sounded like furniture being moved across the floor. He reached out and grabbed a hold of a chair that was by his bed determined that the chair would not be moved. Suddenly it sounded like a club hitting the head of his bed and he let go of that chair really quick. He had changed his mind and the ghost was welcome to the chair.\n\nFARMER CEMETERY\n\nSUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nGo west out of Toledo, Illinois, on Route 121 about two miles - just past the Berry Cemetery) and turn left - south). Continue on this road for three miles. When the blacktop turns right - west) continue south on the gravel road. Just past a sub-station, look for a lane on the right side of the road. The lane is graveled and isn't safe in wet weather.\n\nThe cemetery is fenced and there was supposed to be a gate. There have been no burials for several years, but is still open for use. I found three Civil War stones.\n\nThere are many unmarked graves including a little gypsy girl buried in the southeast corner by the gate.\n\nThe oldest burials seem to be those of: Russells; Seelys; Stirewalts;\n\nMary, Daughter of C. B. and Susan Redfern, Died - October 19, 1858;\n\nSusan Redfern, Wife of C. B., Died - September 13, 1859, age 16 years, 9 months, and child. The frontier was not a healthful place, ague, cholera, mill-sick and fevers took a heavy toll and women and children suffered most.\n\nFAUNCE CEMETERY\n\nSPRING POINT TOWNSHIP\n\nThe cemetery is located west and north of Montrose, Illinois. Take the road north out of town to the Montrose and St. Rose cemeteries. Turn left - west) on an oiled road, go to a corner, turn right. The cemetery is about one-fourth mile on the left side of the road.\n\nThe cemetery was donated by Noah and Sarah Faunce, October 12, 1866. The trustees were W. Spitler - chairman), N. W. Faunce - secretary), Thomas Gibbons and A. H. Faunce.\n\nWayne Printz has the original deed written on a piece of brown wrapping paper.\n\nThe only other addition was made about 1960 when three feet was bought on the west side from Bernard Haskenharm. A chain link fence was built around the cemetery at this time.\n\nJust to the right, as you go through the gate, is an area reserved for indigent families. There are no stones here and it is believed that mostly babies, small children and young mothers are buried here. The area is full and has been for many years.\n\nThere are four very large granite tombstones in the cemetery. One is on the grave-site of Newton Gibbons family plot. Mr. Gibbons was the first provost marshal of this area in 1878. I was told his stone required three teams of horses to haul it from the railroad to the graveyard and place on the base.\n\nAnother large stone is on the grave of Senator Lawrence Gates Sherman 1855-1939. He was appointed United States senator in 1913 by Governor Charles Deneen to replace the late Senator Wm. Larimer. Sherman was elected one term, 1915-1921. His wife, Mary Estelle Spitler, preceded him in death and was buried here in 1910.\n\nI was told of one man, back in the early days of the cemetery, who bartered enough hedge fence posts to build a fence around the cemetery in exchange for burial space for himself and his family.\n\nThere are many open places in the cemetery which are unmarked graves. The graveyard is full with no lots for sale.\n\nFAUNCE GRAVEYARD\n\nThe first record of this graveyard reads as follows on page one of the meeting book. \"At a meeting held at the school house in district No 3 Twp. 9 Range 7 Cumberland County and State of Illinois on Saturday Oct 12th, 1876 for the purpose of electing trustee's of grave yard known as The Faunce Grave Yard. W. Spitler was chosen chairman and N. W. Faunce Secretary of meeting. Thomas D. Gibbons, A. H. Faunce and W. Spitler duly elected trustees.\"\n\nThe trustees measured off the ground in company with N. W. Faunce and others. \"Beginning at the N.E. corner of the S.E. quarter of Section 34, and running West 12 rods, thence South 13 rods, thence East 12 with the section line North 13 rods to place of beginning. N. W. Faunce Sec. and W. Spitler chairman.\n\n\"Subscribe and sworn before me May 12, 1877 W. L. Bruster\"\n\n\"In April of 1879, the trustees had the above named graveyard enclosed with a good board fence by David Spitler for the sum of $38.00 and then laid the ground off in lots and sold them at $2.00 dollars a lot, out of which the said Spitler is to receive his pay. There is an alley on the North East and West of five feet, on the South 25 feet and Alleys five feet wide between the lots except 50, 51, 57, 58, 66 and 67. The deed to the foregoing named grave yard is on record in volume 29 page 420 in Prairie City, Cumb. Co., IL\"\n\nIn with the records was a piece of brown paper bag which they had had a meeting recorded on. It read as follows: \"August 19th, 1895 at an election held at the Faunce Grave Yard. George Wilkens was duly elected, motion made by T. D. Gibbons that there be a tax of 25 cents levy on every person holding a lot.\" Current trustees are Everett Scott, Wayne Printz and Milton McKinney.\n\nNoah W. Faunce and Sarah Faunce gave Warranty Deed dated Oct. 23, 1866, to trustees of Grave Yard. Noah W. Faunce and Sarah Faunce were Milton McKinney's great-grandparents.\n\nFELTNER CEMETERY - GREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Feltner Cemetery is located near Greenup, Illinois. Go west on Lincoln Street until the street turns south at the elevator, continue south under 1-70 and the Penn Railroad. Turn right at the first road, drive about three miles. The cemetery is on the right side of the road.\n\nIt has an iron fence around it and is fairly well kept. It is the only family cemetery owned by the Greenup Township. Some of the stones are three infants of L. C. and L. B. Feltner; Harriet, wife of J. Feltner, Died May 9, 1866 (same stone); John Feltner Died October 6, 1876; Lieut. J. A. Rawlings CO. A. 97th Inf. - Civil War).\n\nSeveral small stones are broken or without inscriptions.\n\nFERGUSON CEMETERY - WOODBURY TOWNSHIP\n\nThis little burial ground was located one mile southwest of the Jewett Cemetery and off on the left side to the Muddy Creek hilltop.\n\nIn the early 1880s, a small group of Negros settled in this area. The family names were Derrickson, Derixson, Brown, Estel and Ferguson. The graves are all believed to be babies and children, probably buried in the years between 1880 and 1905, and few in number. They were all marked with large field stones. The families have moved away long ago and the exact cemetery site has been lost.\n\nThere is another article in this book about these people. Look in the index for Derrickson.\n\nFOX BURIAL GROUND - COTTONWOOD TOWNSHIP\n\nThis old family cemetery is located west out of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 121, turn right - north) about one-fourth mile past the high school and drive six miles. Make a jog left - west) and right - back north) again for one mile. You will come to a T-road, turn right - east) one-half mile and one-fourth mile south. The cemetery is on private property belonging to Glena Tippit Mullen. Go in dry weather, preferably with a guide. It is hard to find and some walking will be necessary.\n\nAt one time there were several Fox families living in the area. The cemetery was on the farm of Nicholas Fox. After Mr. Heath bought the land, he refused to allow any more burials in the cemetery. Mr. Fox is supposed to have asked permission to be buried here and was denied.\n\nMuch later a Fox family member had a fence built around the little burial ground, but with time it has completely rusted away.\n\nAt one time there may have been two dozen graves, many with stones. Now it's condensed to about 20 square feet. Some stones were supposed to have been carried away and thrown in an old well. A few are still propped against a fence or tree.\n\nI was told the first burial was William Waldroop in 1837, although his stone was not found when the cemetery was tabulated in 1968. Possibly the Waldroop family were here first or else were related to the Fox family. The name Waldroop is also spelled Waldrop. Information from Ralph McCormick.\n\nFRIENDS GROVE CEMETERY - SUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located west of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 121 to the high school, turn right - north) and drive about one and onehalf miles.\n\nThis is a well-kept cemetery beside the church. The burial ground was given to Friends Grove by William and Mary A. Munger-Hubbert, the deed was signed January 26, 1875.\n\nThe first recorded burial was little Eva G. Sincox, March 14, 1875 - age 12 years and ten months.\n\nThere are several unmarked graves and about the same number of old and new stones.\n\nGARRETT CEMETERY\n\nGarrett Cemetery - Union Township is located east of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 40 to Vevay Park, turn left - north) one-half mile, then left - west) one-fourth mile.\n\nIn the middle 1800s, George Garrett drove a team of burros from Ohio to the eastern side of Cumberland County bringing his family and possessions. He bought 100 acres of land, setting aside one-half acre for a family burial ground. There are 25 stones and a few unmarked graves. The last burial was that of Louis Garrett in the 1950s, a World War II veteran.\n\nThanks to Dale Lacey for this information.\n\nGOODWIN, GREENWOOD OR BEAR CREEK\n\nSUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nTo find this little cemetery, go west out of Toledo, Illinois, on Route 121 for three miles. Turn right - north) for two miles, then east one-fourth mile. It's on the left side of the road back in a pasture about 500 feet. There is no road, walking will be necessary. It's on land owned by Clark Gardner and Genetta Townley.\n\nThis was once a nice community cemetery fenced and cared for. Now it's overgrown with brush and large trees. Most of the stones are gone or else broken into bits. There may be two or three still standing. It's said that the burial ground is filled to capacity and the last grave was dug on both sides of the fence because there was no room for another full-sized grave inside the fence.\n\nIn 1968, when the cemeteries were tabulated, names on stones were Barger, Brewster, Cooter, Cowan, Crogg, Pickering and Pritchard, early dates are 1851 and 1852. There have been no burials in this century.\n\nGREENUP CEMETERY\n\nGREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThe early history of the Greenup Cemetery seems to be lost in the mist of time. It is the oldest one in the county and was probably started as a family graveyard by the Decius or Jackson family. The oldest tombstones are those of babies, Emmau Jackson September 8, 1812, age eight months, and Emma Jackson, September 12, 18 months. Catherine Decius, wife of Abraham, died November 20, 1816. Two infant daughters preceded her in death, 1814 and 1815. There were many burials in the early 1820s. By 1860, our local newspaper described the Greenup Cemetery as being heavily populated.\n\nThe first owner of the graveyard may have been Joseph Barbour. We know he bought land in this vicinity although I could find no confirming record.\n\nIt is known the Ewart family moved to Greenup between 1850 and 1855 and bought land in this area including the old cemetery. John P. Ewart sold cemetery plots for several years. His large tombstone is in the old south part. Donald Ewart, youngest son of John P., sold lots until the 1960s.\n\nJune 7, 1989, Beulah Ewart Brower and daughters. Sue Peters and Mabel Lynn Benson, sold the remaining four acres of Ewart land to the township trustees. This ground is on the west side of the cemetery and is now in the process of being cleared and filled for cemetery use. There will be a circle drive built here in the near future.\n\nThe Emmett Havens addition was north of the Ewart land between the middle square and the north circle drive. There are about 12 acres and it was obtained November 9, 1921.\n\nThe land on the far north end, where the circle is now, was purchased from Elizabeth Mullens Oakley and Ora Mullens, June 15, 1972.\n\nThe cemetery contains approximately 25 acres and an estimated 2,000 graves. The trustees - 1992) are John Roberts Jr., Richard Button, Reece Wakefield and Raymond James.\n\nThe Memorial Park was donated by Nick Ettlebrick I to the ladies of the Bi-Weekly Club with the stipulation it could never be used for any other purpose. An impressive new memorial stone honoring all veterans was set in the northeast corner in the summer of 1991. There are 137 Civil War, two Spanish-American and many veterans from later wars buried in the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery is cared for by the township, but this hasn't always been so. In the early 1900s, Mr. Conzet gave the present I.O.O.F. building and the west building of the D & M Hardware store to the I.O.O.F. Lodge in return for the assurance that the family grave sites would always be maintained.\n\nOther notes out of old Greenup newspapers are the 16-foot monument described \"as the highest in the cemetery,\" erected in 1895 by Mrs. D. L. Peters for her late husband, David Peters.\n\nMarch 1908, the town was letting bids to complete the sidewalks leading to the cemetery.\n\n1895 was the first year veterans were furnished free tombstones. The only expense to the family was receiving the stone at the depot and placing in the cemetery.\n\nGREESON CEMETERY\n\nSUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThis old family graveyard is located south of Toledo on the Clifford Sherwood farm. Go south on Route 121 to the second curve, continue south on the blacktop and turn on the first road to the right - west). The little cemetery is on the north side of the road, around a pond, in the edge of the woods. Some walking will be necessary.\n\nI have been told there were six or seven stones here several years ago. Now there are only broken pieces with possibly one still standing. In 1968, when the cemeteries were tabulated, this stone could still be read: Elizabeth Armer, Wife of John, Died February 23, 1844, age 47 years, with this verse:\n\n\"Sleep on now and take your rest. God called you home, He thot it best. It's hard indeed to understand thee, But Christ's strong arm supported me.\"\n\nJohn and Elizabeth bought their land from the Palestine Land Office and moved to the area about 1840. They lived near here with their little family until Elizabeth's death.\n\nSeveral years later Reuben Greeson bought the farm and the graveyard has been called the Greeson ever since.\n\nHAGGIN CEMETERY\n\nCOTTONWOOD TOWNSHIP\n\nIt is located north of Toledo, Illinois, to the Bradbury Road. Turn left - west) about one and one-half miles until you come to the cemetery sign, on the right - north) side of the road. Turn down this graveled drive to the hilltop.\n\nIt is well fenced and mowed by the township several times a year.\n\nThis land was bought by Henry Smith on November 11, 1836. He came to Cumberland County with his wife, Mary Haggin Smith, and stepson John Haggin, from Kentucky. Mary was a doctor, growing and gathering herbs and preparing her own medicines. She rode many miles to c are for the settlers in the are a.\n\nBy 1868, app are ntly John Haggin had inherited the farm which he promptly lost in a card game to Joseph Berry. This included the Haggin Cemetery.\n\nHenry Smith died soon after settling here and it is thought his was the first burial. Other members of the Haggin family died and were buried here although no stones were ever set at their graves. After a few years the road was changed and no longer passed the graveyard although the burying continued. The way in was by a lane. The last burial was that of Woodrow Gaines, 1876 to 1941.\n\nThere are many burials here with stones in good condition as well as some marked with field stones.\n\nHere are a few of the names, Harvey, Berry, Fulfer, James, Blakely, Carwells, Haggins, Struevs, Browns and Furrys.\n\nHARMONY OR PEACH TREE CEMETERY\n\nHarmony Cemetery is located two miles north of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130. Turn left at the second road and go around the hill about one-fourth mile.\n\nThere was an Indian burial ground on the top of the hill. When the early settlers began to bury their dead, they used the slope of the hill and the Indian graves were not disturbed. This cemetery was called the Free Indian Graveyard.\n\nThe adjoining land was first owned by John Elder and later H. J. Hickle. On April 2, 1909, H. J. Hickle sold to L. A. and Harriet Stewart.\n\nThe Stewarts made a drive along the north side of the old graveyard and added a second section to the cemetery. It was called Peach Blossom or Peach Tree Cemetery. It was named for the many peach trees scattered on the hillside. The third section was added by Luther Fred Stewart who later sold to the township.\n\nThe Friends Harmony Church was built adjacent to the cemetery in 1876. As time passed, the cemetery was called Harmony and associated with the church.\n\nIt's a beautiful well-kept cemetery. For many years, Buddy Shelton and later Bill Decker cultivated a flower garden on the old Indian burial ground and no burials have ever been allowed on the hilltop. There were many peony plants and cedar trees scattered throughout the cemetery. The trees are gone now and most of the peonies and the name, Peach Tree, has been forgotten.\n\nInformation from Louise Williams and Eleanor Outright.\n\nHAZEL DELL CEMETERIES\n\nThe year was 1848. Rachel White and her husband, Alexander, walked out from their pioneer home to a knoll where their cattle grazed. No fence to speak of confined the animals and Rachel and Alex were rounding them up for evening milking. They paused on the gentle slope overlooking Crooked Creek and rested for a while under the big pines. Rachel, who hadn't been feeling too well of late, said to Alex, \"If I do not get over this sick spell, I want you to lay me to rest here under these beautiful old trees.\" And so, in January of the year 1849, it was done. Her grave was the beginning of a cemetery holding scores of our early settlers, neighbors, friends and our war veterans.\n\nIn 1866, a warranty deed was issued to the trustees of the graveyard surrounding the Union Church, situated on the north side of the road at the west edge of Hazel Dell consisting of one and one-half acres by John B. Kelly and his wife, Celina Kelly. In time all available lots were reserved and when Charles Barkley, son of Will Henry Barkley, early settler of our community, was taken sick and died in early manhood, in the year 1892, he was laid to rest across the roadway in a new plot provided then for the future. These two cemeteries, the Old North and newer South, are situated in the west edge of Hazel Dell, on the high ground above Crooked Creek and close by the two churches. A monument to our World War I veterans stands at the entrance to South Cemetery. The monument was erected around the year 1920 by local men and boys and serves as a memorial to earlier and later heroes as well and is a focal point for Decoration Day services every year.\n\nSome 68 soldiers lie in the Old North Cemetery. More than 80 veterans rest in South Cemetery. According to information from the State Archives in Springfield, there are 35 Civil War veterans and one from the War of 1812. ..and to date some 15 other veterans of later conflicts: Spanish and Philippine wars. World War I and World War II. More than 150 soldiers' graves are decorated each Memorial Day in the Hazel Dell cemeteries.\n\nNo abandoned cemeteries theseÂthe new occupants arrive unceasingly and the boundaries are pushed farther out as the years go on. The grounds are beautifully well kept so the wish of any and all who cherish a claim to old Hazel Dell village, through ancestry or previous residences, seems to be for a final resting place in either of these two spots.\n\nThe \"Rachel\" of this account was the wife of Alexander White who was granted land in 1846 from the United States Land Office, much of the land on which Hazel Dell was later plotted.\n\nToday, 1992, the headstones of Rachel White, her husband, Alexander, and others of the White family can be found on the hill overlooking the same creek and meadow. A few of the \"old pine trees\" grown in the cemetery are left, but they are pretty well destroyed by wind and ice storms.\n\nSOLDIERS' MONUMENT\n\nIn the middle or early 1920s after World War I, citizens of the Hazel Dell community decided they wanted a memorial set up to commemorate those of the Hazel Dell are a who gave their lives and whose fate remains unknown. Perhaps other communities were setting monuments at that time and since Hazel Dell was a thriving and up-to-date village, they became interested in erecting one.\n\nFirst a decision was made where the monument would be placed. On the south side of the road at the entrance of the new cemetery was a place visible to all passersby.\n\nHolly Timmons and other interested persons canvassed the neighborhood for funds and with the help of his son Ike, Bruce Kelly and son Wayne, and Milt Kelly, work began. The boys, Ike and Wayne, and their teams of horses moved the necessary soil from the roadside bank north of the proposed monument site. Clone Markwell of Casey gave the monument at cost and donated the cement for the concrete form and sidewalk on all four sides of the monument.\n\nAfter the monument was finished. Holly and Ike decided a background was needed as a finishing touch. So about 20 feet south of the monument a trellis of wood and woven wire was made. Honeysuckle vines were set out and soon a dense screen was formed. This honeysuckle-covered trellis remained until the ground breaking for the new Church of God in 1939 made it necessary to destroy it.\n\nHILL CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Hill Cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois, to the Union Center Road then two miles east. At the second crossroad, it's on the farm of Gary McMechan. The burial ground is south about one-fourth mile on top of a steep hill. I understand there is no path up to the cemetery and it has been neglected. It's a small family burial ground with only a few stones although there may be some unmarked graves. The oldest stone reads 1869 and there have been no new burials since the early 1900s.\n\nHUTTON OR SCONCE CEMETERY\n\nCOTTONWOOD TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located north of Toledo, Illinois, to Bradbury, then right - east) about four miles, then south one-fourth mile across the field. It may be hard to find without help. Go in dry weather.\n\nIt's a very old burial ground, located in the Sconce Bend are a. At one time there were probably 15 cabins here, rivaling Greenup in size, and was even considered for the county seat. It's all gone now except the cemetery.\n\nCumberland County's first sheriff, Thomas Sconce, lived here and the are a was named for his family. He was sheriff from 1843 to 1848 and is buried here. His original stone was only a small white slab. In the late 1930s, Clint Walters, township supervisor, and 0. K. Carrell decided our first sheriff should have a more pretentious stone. One was bought and set on the grave. It reads: Thomas Sconce, Born October 28, 1796; Died July 10, 1848.\n\nOther names on stones are Heddins, Hutton, Kirkling, McMorris, Black, Teets and Brown.\n\nThis cemetery is mowed and c are d for by the township.\n\nAnother interesting bit of history about this community is the sheriff also furnished his own jail. It was a huge, hollow, sweet gum log. A prisoner climbed a ladder and was let down the inside with a rope. A large flat rock was then placed on top to prevent a jail break.\n\nInformation from Aleen Ryan and Charles Hutton.\n\nILLINOIS CENTRAL PIONEER CEMETERY\n\nThis cemetery is located about one and three-fourths miles north of Neoga, Illinois, with the Illinois Central Gulf tracks on the west and the township road on the east and just south of Bush Creek, now a finger of Lake Mattoon. The Illinois Central Railroad \"inherited\" the cemetery when it obtained the right of way. The ICRR received its charter on February 10, 1851, to construct its lines in Illinois. The 1853 land deed of sale of the right of way to the ICRR specifically excludes a portion of the land \"opposite to two graves.\" The official right-of-way map shows the tiny rectangle near milepost 182 as a \"Burial Ground.\"\n\nIn the early days Illinois was not healthful and cholera, fever and milk sickness took many lives and the children especially suffered. Two of these pioneer children were buried here on a knoll among the cedar and fir trees. They are the children of Stephen and Pricilla Wait. A daughter, Mariah, died on October 27, 1852, at the age of seven, and a son, Luther, who died on November 5, 1852, age 11. Later another child followed, Harvey, son of S. D. and P. A. Parks, who died on August 15, 1854, at the age of one year.\n\nThe children's graves could have been forgotten and neglected, but throughout the years ICRR section forces have c are d for the graves, cutting weeds and in 1951, plantings were made and a small fence added to outline the final resting place. Former section foreman Lon E. Bishop in 1967 recalled this incident.\n\n\"Water running off the right of way toward the creek was threatening to wash out the little graveyard. In 1918, Division Superintendent H. Battisfore told Foreman W. Roby, 'I don't c are how much it costs or what it takes, keep the water off the graves.' \" Bishop remembers helping unload three or four carloads of riprap stone to shore up the graveyard and to divert the water flow around it.\n\nAnother time he recalled was when the trees had grown tall and bushy. Linemen had topped the trees so they would not interfere with the power lines and left branches and limbs covering the graves.\n\nIn the early 1950s the railroad dug a deep ditch along the tracks and a dragline operator working there called attention to the headstones and the ditch went around the knoll.\n\nFor 140 years the children have slept their eternal sleep in this peaceful setting. The headstones are still legible with a marker at the foot of each grave. The cedar and fir trees that once marked the graves are now gone and work is needed to clear back the small brush that is beginning to overtake the site.\n\nJACK OAK CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Jack Oak Cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130. Take the Union Center Road east one-fourth mile to the Jack Oak Church.\n\nAbout 1976, Everett and Maurine Decker gave two acres of land for a community cemetery. It is not a township cemetery and is taken c are of by the trustees.\n\nIt's an attractive cemetery with a custom-made name plate arch at the entrance.\n\nThe first burial was that of Clifford Kuhn in 1976.\n\nThere are now 25 graves.\n\nJEWETT CEMETERY\n\nWOODBURY TOWNSHIP\n\nThe cemetery is west of the town of Jewett, Illinois, and can be reached by either Main Street Road - which is part of the old Cumberland Trail) or Route 40. A black wrought iron cemetery nameplate faces Route 40. It's owned by the township and consists of about three acres.\n\nI could find out very little about the old - east) part. The family names of Beals, Boggs, Browning, Goldsby and House have gravestones dating back to 1845 and early 1850s. The new part was donated by the Glasner family.\n\nThe state archives list 14 Civil War, nine World War I, and two World War II veterans.\n\nIt is an attractive, well-kept cemetery with many beautiful old evergreen trees in the east part.\n\nJOHNSON OR UNION CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThis old pioneer cemetery is located east of Greenup, Illinois, to the Pleasant Valley Church, turn left - north), drive seven miles until you come to the Union Church. Across the road from the church is the land leading to the cemetery.\n\nThe cemetery is pleasantly located on a bluff overlooking Hurricane Creek. There is one very large old cedar tree and several smaller ones.\n\nIt's supposed the old north half of the cemetery was donated by George and Mary Ann Johnson. They came to Illinois from Indiana about 1840. A few years later William Johnson, age 19 years, was buried here on September 21, 1843. He was too old to be their son, but was surely a relative. It is certain that Mary Ann gave the south half of the cemetery after her husband died in 1856.\n\nThere are seven Civil War veterans buried here, also veterans of later wars.\n\nThe cemetery is still being used and is well kept although many stones in the old section have fallen down and some are broken.\n\nKINGERY CEMETERY\n\nSPRING POINT TOWNSHIP\n\nThis little family cemetery is located near Montrose, Illinois. Take the service road east about one-fourth mile to a lane going north - right). The lane ends at an old house site. The cemetery is north and west on the slope of a hill. The lane is not in good condition, walking is advised.\n\nSamuel Kingery migrated from Madison, Ohio, to what was then Coles County in 1834. He bought 80 acres from the government and built a log cabin. He returned to Ohio for his family, bringing them back the next year. He was the father of eight sons and three daughters.\n\nHis son, Elias Elvert Kingery, also bought 80 acres from the government August 4, 1838. The cemetery site is on this land. The next year Elias sold this land to his father in August 1839.\n\nSamuel Kingery died April 5, 1843, and was the first to be buried in the family graveyard. There are at least 40 graves in the cemetery, many without stones.\n\nThe Kingery is the second oldest cemetery in the county. Needham has the honor of being the first.\n\nThe last burials were Emma Jane Ritz, 1884-1946, and Flora Randolph, 1876-1939.\n\nKIRKLING CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThis is an old family graveyard located north of Greenup, Illinois. Take Route 130 to the Union Center Road, turn right - east) to the Jack Oak Church. It is about one mile south - right) on a hilltop overlooking Hurricane Creek bottom on land now owned by Everett Decker. It would be hard to find the exact location without help.\n\nThe cemetery was first established by W. Kirkling. He bought the land on April 15, 1839. Tradition has it that an Indian burial ground was located here.\n\nAccording to Forest Hampsten, the stones are all gone and the field has been plowed and planted. He also told of attending the last burial there, about 80 years ago.\n\nAndy Vantassel was teaching at the Jack Oak School, Forest was one of the pupils. Mr. Vantassel dismissed the children and teacher and pupils followed the procession to the graveyard. Guy Carrell gave information about his relatives who are buried in the cemetery:\n\nJane Brewer, died May 23, 1845, 52 years;\n\nWinfred Scott, died March 27, 1848, eight months;\n\nAngela Kirkling, died September 18, 1846, 21 years;\n\nMary McCollough, died August 10, 1846, ten months;\n\nMicky Branson, died August 5, 1853, five years;\n\nWilliam A. Brewer, died April 18, 1848, two years.\n\nAt one time there were several Kirkling stones, also graves marked with field stones.\n\nLIBERTY HILL CEMETERY\n\nGREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located three miles south of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130 to the Liberty Hill Community Center, then onefourth mile east to the church.\n\nIt is a rather small cemetery with a beautiful old tree overlooking the graves. It's thought that the burial ground was donated by J. L. Wright at about the same time the church was built.\n\nThe first funeral in the church and the first burial was that of the little daughter of J. L. and Missouri Wright on February 17, 1888. Later the same year the mother, Missouri Wright, was laid to rest by her little daughter on August 6, 1888. Also on the same day little Dellie Strader was buried at the age of three months.\n\nThe state archives list two Civil War veterans buried here, but I could only find one stone.\n\nIn the spring of 1990, Carl Paden donated 81,000 to the cemetery fund for the purpose of repairing the old tombstones. Many have been reset or repaired.\n\nLOCKHART CEMETERY\n\nLockhart is located one and one-half miles north of Neoga, Illinois, on the now Lake Mattoon road, then west three-eighths mile, then north one-fourth mile on the short subdivision road, then west following the road around to the southwest corner of the subdivision overlooking Lake Mattoon.\n\nThe cemetery is fenced in, but should include 100 feet south of the fenced are a where old wooden box graves and wooden markers were at one time.\n\nThere are three Civil War veterans here.\n\nThis cemetery is no longer used; the last burial was around 1916.\n\nThe fence is in poor condition and many of the old stones are beginning to fall over.\n\nLONG POINT CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nLong Point Cemetery is located three miles west and north one and one-half miles of Casey, Illinois.\n\nAbout the year 1849, David Fancher moved with his family to this are a. With the help of a few neighbors he started a church and burial ground.\n\nThis cemetery was probably the only one in the county to have its own oil field. Starting in July 1906, there were seven oil wells drilled on church and cemetery property. One well paid a small royalty check monthly for many years.\n\nThe church is gone now and so are the oil wells.\n\nThe cemetery is mowed and c are d for by the township.\n\nLONG POINT\n\n(KINGMAN-CLINE CEMETERY)\n\nLong Point is located about four miles southeast of Neoga, Illinois. The official name is Kingman-Cline as there is another Long Point Cemetery on the east side of the county near Casey, Illinois, and they are often confused. The cemetery is all that remains of the once prosperous community of Long Point. Long Point was one of five polling places listed when Cumberland County separated from Coles County in 1843. The town and old cemetery were located a little northwest of the present cemetery.\n\nH. C. Cline deeded land for the present cemetery in 1862 when his father-in-law died.\n\nIn 1895, John Morrison, a Methodist minister who owned adjacent land, gave additional land to build the first church.\n\nSometime in 1895, John Henry Kimery, William Cline, Joe Cline and others moved the graves to the new cemetery. The John Gilpin grave - February 2, 1858, age 56 years) was the only grave not moved. His family refused to let his be moved.\n\nThe cemetery has expanded over the years west of the original church and churchyard site and into the new part, the last church being torn down in 1966. There are 21 Civil War, one Mexican War and two Spanish-American War veterans buried here. There were six stones that had weathered so badly that in 1970 when the cemetery was read, they were unreadable.\n\nToday the cemetery is well kept and a large cedar tree shades the old part of the cemetery. The lane runs from east to west almost in the center with the township road running along the north and west sides. A small grove of trees stands on the far northwest corner.\n\nIt has a very old and interesting section of pioneer stones on the east side of the drive with new and more modern stones on the west.\n\nJames Mullen was the first land owner, buying from the government January 11, 1840. The cemetery was probably started as a family burial ground with the death of James Mullen. He passed away July 13, 1846, age 71 years. Five members of his family were buried here in the next 11 years. It app are ntly became a community cemetery with many burials between the death of James Mullen and September 1889, when Levi C. Hall and Sarah Ann Hall sold one acre to the Mullen Cemetery trustees.\n\nMore land was needed by July 2, 1908, when Andrew Hall sold another acre to the cemetery trustees, H. G. Thayer, W. W. Grissom and G. Kingery.\n\nThe most recent addition was January 8, 1975, when Mary Tanner granted more ground in consideration of 810.00 making it possible to build a circle drive from the north around the south end. There are now approximately three acres.\n\nThe cemetery is c are d for by the township and is neat and well kept.\n\nThere are six Civil War and one Spanish-American veterans, also veterans from later wars buried here.\n\nMACEDONIA OR YANAWAY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Yanaway Cemetery had probably been a family burial ground for many years when Isreal W. Yanaway gave land for a community cemetery. The earliest burials were the wife of Henry Yanaway, born November 1, 1786, died April 13, 1864. Her name can no longer be read on the stone and Charles Yanaway, son of S. S. and M. E., died December 23, 1869.\n\nAfter the Macedonia Baptist Church was built, the name Yanaway faded away and the cemetery was known as the Macedonia.\n\nMore land was needed and on April 9, 1889, Melissa Harmason sold one-half acre of land for $20.00 to the cemetery. A few years later on October 25, 1902, W. S. and Ollie Emrick were paid $50.00 for another acre of cemetery land.\n\nA few years ago the fence was taken down between the church and the graveyard. It's an attractive and well-c are d-for cemetery. It's located about two miles north of Casey, Illinois. Go on Route 49 until you see the church sign, turn left - west) two miles until you come to a T. Turn left about one-fourth mile.\n\nMULLEN CEMETERY\n\nSPRING POINT TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located east and north of Montrose, Illinois. Take Route *40 east two miles, turn left - north), go to the Mullen Baptist Church. The cemetery is west about one-eighth mile.\n\nNEAL CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nNeal Cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130. Turn right on Gravel Pit Road. Go to the top of the river hill and continue due south to the Bill Reeder farm. The cemetery is east of the road across a pasture. At one time there was a road south of the Clear Creek Church, but it has gone back to the wilderness.\n\nIt has a fence around it and is mowed by the township. Many of the stones are broken or fallen over. There are several stones still intact, also one grave with an iron cover.\n\nI will list only a few of the names: Woodrow, Wall, C are lls, Franklin, Dowden, Neal and Brewer. There are many broken stones that could not be read.\n\nMT. ZION OR NEBO CEMETERY\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois. Go north on Route 130 to the Union Center Road, two miles east and one mile back north.\n\nThe community was given a warranty deed for the cemetery plat April 7, 1891. The grantors were Sarah and George Jobe and Hannah Cook. At this time the cemetery was already very old and may have been a family burial ground belonging to the Cook family.\n\nThe earliest stone seems to be that of a baby, Mary E. Darter, daughter of G. L. and M. A., died February 22, 1832, age 28 days.\n\nAbout 1845 to 1848, the Mt. Zion Separate Baptist Church was built close by the south side of the cemetery.\n\nBoth church and cemetery are commonly called Nebo. No one seems to know where the nickname came from, but this is a neighborhood of nicknames. The cemetery is still used and is fenced and well c are d for.\n\nNEEDHAM CEMETERY - SPRING POINT TOWNSHIP\n\nThe old pioneer cemetery is located west and north of Montrose, Illinois. Take the road out of town to the Montrose and St. Rose cemeteries. Turn left - west) on an oiled road, make a right - north) when you come to a corner. About one-fourth mile north you will come to the Faunce Cemetery, curve around to the left - west) to a T-road, turn right about one-half mile. The little cemetery is on the right - east) side of the road, overgrown with many old cedar trees.\n\nI could not find anyone who knew the early history, but assume it started as the Needham family cemetery or else was a neighborhood cemetery on the Needham land. It is app are ntly the oldest cemetery in the community. Many of the tombstones are down, others weathered away and can no longer be read. When Needham Cemetery the cemeteries were tabulated in 1969, the oldest stone was Wiley C. Vales, died October 11, 1801, age 11 years, also, Mary D. Vales, daughter of W. 0. and L. J., died April 18, 1826, two years.\n\nI was told of two incidents that happened many years ago and the victims were buried here in the Needham graveyard. One, a horse thief, was caught in Montrose and was executed at sunrise. Some sly he was hung, others say he was shot. Justice was swift on the frontier.\n\nThe other was an Indian that came into town on the train, staying at the hotel or rooming house in Montrose. Every day he would take a pick and shovel and go out into the woods. Several times he was followed, but always managed to elude the men. Unfortunately, he became ill with influenza and died. What he was looking for remains a mystery to this day. Their graves are probably two of the unmarked burial places in the cemetery.\n\nNEOGA MEMORIAL CEMETERY\n\nThe Neoga Memorial Cemetery is located one-half mile south of the town of Neoga, Illinois, and then west across the Illinois Central Gulf track.\n\nAt the time Neoga Memorial Cemetery was founded, many rural churches had adjoining cemeteries that were still used. Many other churches and their cemeteries had been abandoned or neglected. Therefore, Neoga Memorial was founded as a central burying ground.\n\nThe first lot was sold to Robert E. McAllister in the year of 1872. It is located north of the entrance and is noted for its round headstone. During the first three years, lots sold for 815.\n\nIn 1924, the Voris heirs deeded three-fourths of an acre in the northeast section with the stipulation that money from the sale of lots be added to an endowment fund, the interest to be used for perpetual c are of the cemetery. An endowment fund was sought and mainly due to the efforts of Mrs. Ambler - Duluth) Wilson, one of the originators of the plan, $9,000 was raised.\n\nIn 1938, an addition of six and one-half acres was presented to the city by Mr. Frank Kendall and Mrs. Mary Stewart. A bronze tablet was placed at the cemetery to commemorate this act. It is located toward the northwest corner of the cemetery.\n\nIn 1948, a township cemetery board was created and a tax levied to maintain all the cemeteries in the township. Those cemeteries include Buchanan, Crossing, Zion, Long Point, Neoga Memorial, Concord, Lockhart and Drummond.\n\nThe center drive leads to the G.A.R. Memorial in the center of the cemetery. The memorial was moved from its original place in the old East Park. The school children purchased it with pennies they had collected.\n\nIn 1929, a flag pole was erected just north of the entrance gate by the Neoga Votaw-Swank Post. Each Memorial day the American Legion decorates the graves of comrades and holds services on the American Legion plot. Citizens were wanting a walk constructed and led by Lyman Votaw, $800 was raised by subscription to build the walk. After the walk was completed, 860 remained and this was used to maintain the walk in the years to follow.\n\nThe sidewalk is still usable along the east side of south Route 45 from Neoga to Sudkamp Plumbing, Heating and Electric business across the highway from the entrance.\n\nOver the years many of the beautiful trees and shrubs have had to be removed as well as the brick pillars and the fence at the entrance.\n\nPAUL CEMETERY\n\nThe Paul Cemetery - Greenup Township is located south of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 130 to the Hazel Dell Road, turn east, drive to the Mt. Zion Church, then north to the second road, turn right, go about one-fourth mile, and you are there.\n\nIt's an old cemetery, located on the Old Palestine Road. This road angled cross country from Palestine to Greenup. The cemetery has been hard to date. James Paul and his family were in this are a in the mid-1840s. His eldest son, Allen, set aside an acre of ground, probably in the 1860s, to be used as a cemetery.\n\nI believe there was already a burial ground here when he bought the land as the oldest graves are of children from the Black, Smith and Newburn families. There are also many unmarked graves.\n\nAbout 1880, James Tharp donated an acre of ground on the east side of the ravine. For many years there was a fence down the ravine overgrown with brush, briars, and rattlesnakes. Eventually this was all cle are d away, making one big cemetery.\n\nAt one time there was talk of building a church here. A better location was chosen a mile east on the corner of S. Allen's farm - now the Bill Hallet farm). This church was called the Allen Chapel and was disbanded and torn down about 1915.\n\nThe state archives list eight Civil War veterans buried here. I have never been able to find that many stones. They may have been too weathered to read or else broken.\n\nMy roots go very deep in this cemetery. James and Sarah Tharp are my great-grandp are nts and Druzella Gilbert was my greatgreat-grandmother.\n\nAlvie Wade helped me reconstruct this bit of history.\n\nPRENTICE CEMETERY\n\nGREENUP TOWNSHIP\n\nThe Prentice Cemetery is located near Greenup, Illinois. Go south on Route 130 to the high line, turn right, go to first road and make another right. It's behind the first house on the right on the Pauline Sutherland farm. There is a drive back to the cemetery. It was cleaned up in the summer of 1991 and the stones reset.\n\nJames P. Prentice came to America in 1839 with a cousin, John Shields. They walked to Greenup from the east coast carrying their tools and everything they owned. James was a stonemason and worked on the Pennsylvania Railroad.\n\nHe married and raised a family. This was a family burial ground.\n\nRUFFNER CEMETERY\n\nCROOKED CREEK TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located five miles east of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 40.\n\nThe original graveyard was located on the south side of the railroad. Rumors began to circulate in the community that the Pennsylvania Railroad was going to lay a second track on the south side of the existing one. If they did, it would go right through the graveyard. The community was so concerned that a new cemetery site was situated on the high ground between the railroad and the National Road. In 1901, the new cemetery was completed and the first burial was Rachel Tutewiler, wife of Jacob Tutewiler.\n\nSeveral years passed before the new track was finally built. Meanwhile all burials were in the new cemetery.\n\nAbout 1926, a work crew of Irishmen arrived in the are a to move all the old graves to the new cemetery. There are very few really old stones, probably many graves had no markers and were not moved.\n\nThis cemetery is a very well kept and attractive place. I understand it's on the township line and the c are is sh are d by both\n\nCrooked Creek and Union townships.\n\nI found six Civil War veterans buried here as well as those of later wars. Dale Lacy provided information for this article.\n\nRYAN CEMETERY\n\nCOTTONWOOD TOWNSHIP\n\nThis old family burial ground is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Rt. 130 to the Lincoln Log Cabin Road, turn right - west) about two miles and cross the river. The little cemetery is on the hill behind the first house.\n\nIt is located on what was originally the farm of pioneer William Ryan. The first burial seems to be that of his daughter Maneriva, died December 26, 1840, at the age of 17 years, ten months, and two days.\n\nThis little burial ground is well c are d for. The monuments are still standing and there is a good fence around it. I understand the township takes c are of the mowing.\n\nRyan Cemetery\n\nRecently the stone of Revolutionary War veteran James Ryan was moved to this little cemetery, for safe keeping, by a direct descendant.\n\nSome of the names on the stones are Rogers, Taylor, Gill, and Phipps. There has not been a burial here for many years.\n\nThanks to Aleen Ryan for this information.\n\nSACRED HEART PARISH CEMETERY\n\nLILLYVILLE\n\nThe Parish Cemetery is located two miles east and two miles south of Sigel, Illinois, in Springpoint Township, Cumberland County. The cemetery is within walking distance of Sacred Heart Church. There is also a school located nearby.\n\nJohn Will donated ten acres of land he had bought from Clem Uptmor II for church and school purposes about 1875. John Will Sr. and his wife, Elizabeth, deeded ten acres of their farm on April 21, 1877, to be used for church and school purposes. The original plot was consecrated in the autumn of 1877 by V. Rev. P. Mauritus Klostermann O.F.M. In 1918, Rev. P. Herman Joseph Fister O.F.M. enlarged the cemetery with additional ground and it was consecrated by him April 21, 1918.\n\nThe earliest stone found is of Gucker-Anna E.: Geb. 22 Feb. 1836~Gest 2 Maz 1857. Some lettering on the stones are in German. Some of the Lillyville are a was settled in 1843 by the German Land Company from Cincinnati, Ohio. Most of the early Catholic settlers settled in the western and central part of the Lillyville are a. They came from the early 1850s to 1860s.\n\nSALEM CEMETERY\n\nSUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located west of Greenup, Illinois, on Route 121 to the curve. Turn left about one mile - south) or until you see the church and cemetery about one-eighth mile on the right - west). In 1844, W. E. Smith gave a tract of land near the southwest corner of his land large enough to build the meeting house and also for a graveyard. Soon after the church was built, a day was set aside and all the settlers came together for a day of clearing and preparing the ground for the cemetery. There has never been a charge for burial plots as the graveyard had been donated to the people.\n\nThe first death in the community and burial was George Smith about 1845.\n\nThe cemetery is well kept although many of the old stones are black with age, leaning and some have fallen on the ground.\n\nIn the far corner is an interesting bit of whimsy. On the Lyons family plot are a stone lion and lioness marking the graves of Mr. and Mrs. Lyons.\n\nIn 1992, John - Bill) and Dorsa Mock donated land adjoining the existing cemetery. It will be known as the John H. Mock addition to the Salem Cemetery.\n\nTHE GRAVE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD\n\nUNION TOWNSHIP\n\nIn 1851 during a cholera epidemic in this are a, a Mrs. Shaner died of this terrible plague. There were several members of the family and all were sent away for safety.\n\nSo great was the fear of this disease that the body was immediately taken by two neighbors, Uriah and David Walling, about one and one-half miles west of the homestead and buried in the woods. No stone was ever set at the grave, but a stout rail fence was built around it. In later years, when the roads were surveyed and straightened, the Timothy Road was built through the field, but angled on either side around the grave. As the years passed, brush and trees grew in the enclosure. For many years there was a large tree in the middle of the road over the grave. Finally the tree was removed, the road straightened and so passed directly over the grave. Amos Cutright, who provided the information for this article believes the grave was located about one-half mile east of the Plum Grove Church.\n\nST. ROSE PARISH CEMETERY\n\nSt. Rose Cemetery is located on the north edge of Montrose, Illinois, just inside the Cumberland County line. It is believed the cemetery was established about 1879 or later as the St. Rose of Lima Catholic Church was built November 9, 1879.\n\nThe earliest dated stone is Joseph Koeing, 1843-1881.\n\nThe road ran along the east side until 1944 when the road was changed and now a good blacktop road runs along the west side. An acre of land was added onto the west. In November 1977, an additional one and one-half acres was purchased for expansion on the north side.\n\nThe cemetery has a row of evergreen trees across the west and south side. Many graves on the west part of the original cemetery, facing the blacktop road, are marked with white crosses, thus giving it a well-kept, restful appearance.\n\nTIPPITT CEMETERY\n\nCOTTONWOOD TOWNSHIP\n\nThis is an old cemetery located three and one-half miles east of Bradbury, Illinois. It is an attractive, well-kept place with many interesting tombstones both old and new.\n\nThe original pioneer burial ground may have been donated by the Glosser-Sherman families in the 1840s or 1850s.\n\nThe first ground was purchased July 9, 1904, from Arthur and Symantha Brewer. They were paid 850.00 for one acre. Trustees were John Tippitt, Alec Carrell and David Butler. In 1963 an additional two acres was bought from Kent and Peggy Ryan. In 1991 three-fourths of an acre was purchased from Mildred Titus, filling out the rectangular shape of the cemetery.\n\nRecently Owen and Aleen Ryan donated a wrought-iron arch over the west entrance.\n\nJust across the road from the cemetery are two tombstones wired to a fence. The names on the stones are Samuel Jones, March 11, 1856, 53 years; and Lucinda Jones, daughter of S. E. and Mary, died December 21, 1854, 18 years. I was told that years ago there were several more stones, and other members of the Jones family perished on one of the many cholera epidemics that swept the country in frontier times. So great was the fear of this disease, no one came near the family to help c are for the sick. The strongest, a young man, c are d for and buried his family as one by one they died. When he became too ill to c are for himself, he came outside the cabin, sat down on the ground and, leaning against a stump, died. Two neighboring men buried him in the little family graveyard. A sad story, but one that was far too common in pioneer days.\n\nTOLEDO MEMORIAL\n\nSUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThe cemetery is located one-fourth of a mile south of the courthouse then left about one-fourth of a mile. It's a very well- kept cemetery consisting of approximately 15 acres.\n\nOn June 16, 1886, Thomas and Mary Brewer gave to the Village of Toledo a tract of land containing approximately three acres. This included \"the Toledo Grave Yard as now laid out and fenced.\" He reserved a strip of ground containing his family graves, and for the use of his remaining family.\n\nHis first two wives are buried here, Mary, 1865, and Sarah, 1872, and several children. The third wife, Mary, survived at his death November 11, 1886.\n\nSeveral years later when more land was needed the Edger Neal Addition extended the cemetery to the road on the north. Later Edger Lashmet added several acres on the south side.\n\nTROXEL\n\nThis was a small family burial ground, once owned by Bill Troxel. It's located east of Greenup, Illinois, on the north side of Rt. 40, where Gary Shobe now lives. The stones are gone and a pond is there now. Two of the stones were: Harriet Troxel, died February 20, 1918, age 83, and Nicholas Troxel, died May 1, 1904, age 73. There were other stones, no names. Information from\n\nEdith Troxel Biggs.\n\nUPPER BERRY - SUMPTER TOWNSHIP\n\nThis small family burial ground is located one mile west of Toledo, Illinois, on Rt. 121. Turn right - north) about one and three-fourths mile. This is mostly a dirt road and should only be attempted in dry weather. It's on a hill on the left side of the road, on the farm belonging to Bill Robinson. It may be hard to find.\n\nThe Berry family came to what was then Coles County from Tennessee, northwest of the site where Toledo was later platted.\n\nDuring a cholera epidemic, probably 1851, Joe Berry and his wife died of this disease and were supposed to be the first burials in this little burial ground. No stones were set at their graves.\n\nThere are only seven stones standing at this time, some have been destroyed. It's overgrown with weeds and grass, and has been abandoned for many years. Names on the stones are Berry and Dobbs. The state archive states there is one Civil War veteran buried here, N. C. Dobbs, Co. I, 5th Illinois Cavalry.\n\nInformation from Louise Shupe.\n\nAN UNKNOWN FAMILY CEMETERY\n\nOn the farm of Laverle Shepherd, southwest of Greenup, Illinois, is a broken tombstone leaning against a large oak tree.\n\nThe inscription reads: Franklin O., son of S. and L. Greeson. Age two years and 28 days. There is a foot marker with the initials F.O.G.\n\nThe name Shephard has been scratched into the headstone and the name Daniel Noah Sherrick scratched into the foot marker, probably by children.\n\nI have been told that the stone was there, broken and fallen over, as long as can be remembered. Mr. Shephard later moved it to a nearby tree.\n\nWASHINGTON CEMETERY\n\nCROOKED CREEK TOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located about six miles east of Greenup, Illinois, on the York Road.\n\nIt's a very old cemetery, consisting of two acres. It was started in the early 1800s when Eli Bower recognized a need for a burial ground in the community and gave half an acre for that purpose.\n\nSeveral years later Eli's daughter Lily Brown gave another half an acre. Then sometime in the 1970s Lily's son Theron Brown sold the cemetery another acre.\n\nIt's a well-kept cemetery in an attractive setting.\n\nThere are 18 Civil War veterans and also veterans of later wars.\n\nThelma Bishop told about the Memorial Day celebrations they had several years ago. Mrs. Susie Starks and Daisy Sharp always made bouquets for every grave. Then the children would all perform recitations or little skits. After the program was over the children would be handed flags and with John Sharp leading the parade they marched around the graveyard placing a flag on each veteran's grave.\n\nI want to thank Lurene Ramsey for this information.\n\nWEBSTER OR McCORMICK CEMETERY\n\nCOTTONWOODTOWNSHIP\n\nThis old pioneer cemetery is located north of Greenup, Illinois, on Rt. 121 past the high school about one-fourth of a mile, turn right - north), drive seven miles, make a jog left, then continue north one mile, until you come to a T-road. Turn right - east) about one-half of a mile. It is on the hill north of the road - left side). Walking will be necessary. The cemetery is on Ralph McCormick's farm. Go in dry weather, preferably with a guide.\n\nI understand the cemetery has some care and the brush is cleared away. Rows of graves can still be seen, many with field stones for markers, and a few broken stones. The Boy Scouts from Effingham started to build a fence around the little burial ground last summer. We hope they finish it this summer of 1992.\n\nOne interesting person buried here is Cumberland County's legendary strong man, \"Big Jim Eaton\". It is said he could lifi a barrel of whiskey and drink from the bung hole. Once when helping with a cabin raising, he uncovered a large stone. He lifted the stone in his arms and started up the hill to the cemetery. Telling his friends that when he died to bury him where he dropped the stone. The big stone is still there and \"Big Jim\" is buried beside it.\n\nOther families buried here are Grimes, Strickland, Taylor, Norris, Stewart, Pinksard Lane, Grafton, Best, Eaton, and Thomas.\n\nInformation from Ralph McCormick.\n\nOLD WOODBURY CEMETERY\n\nWOODBURYTOWNSHIP\n\nThis cemetery is located west of Jewett, Illinois, across the muddy creek bridge to the top of the hill. Turn left (south) down a private lane to a farm home. This is the Robinson farm. I understand there is no road back to the cemetery. It's overgrown with many stones down and others carried away and used for other purposes.\n\nDuring W.P.A. days the graveyard was cleaned up and enclosed with a strong wire fence and gate. These are all gone now.\n\nI'm told Charles Garrett gave the land for a burial ground although there were graves here before he bought the land.\n\nIn 1968, when the cemeteries were tabulated, names on tombstones still standing were: Garrett, Glasener, Ricker, Walker, Welk, and Wisner. Some of these people were buried in this century; William G. Walker - 1912, Mary Welk - 1909. Older stones go back to 1855 with the grave of John Glasener.\n\nZION CEMETERY\n\nZion is located about three and one-half miles west of the intersection of Routes 121 and 45, across Brush Creek, a finger of Lake Mattoon.\n\nThe Zion Chapel United Brethren Church sat on the northwest corner of the intersection, with the older cemetery on the northeast corner and the newer cemetery on the southeast corner. The Zion School was west of the church.\n\nThe older cemetery on the north side of the road has many stones falling over and many graves no longer have markers. It is enclosed in a good fence. In front of the fence a stone marker has been erected stating \"Zion Chapel Cemeteries\".\n\nThe earliest stone found in the older cemetery is dated 1833.\n\nThe new part, on the south side, is enclosed in a good fence and is being used today for burials.\n\nThere are 11 Civil War veterans buried here."
