        "text": "SEABROOK — The oldest burial ground within Seabrook's Hillside Cemetery has been placed on the N.H. Register of Historic Places, thanks to the effort of Seabrook Library Director Ann Robinson.\n\nKnown as either the Methodist or Smithtown Cemetery, the area consists of 1.7 acres abutting Route 1 on its western border and a small business to the north. Rustic headstones and markers give credence not only to the cemetery's age but also to the generations of Seabrook families laid to rest, their contributions to the country, the arts, and trades of the time etched into stone for posterity.\n\nRobinson submitted her research citing the historical significance of the cemetery as it relates to Seabrook.\n\n\"Prominent families and founders, veterans, businesspeople, clergy, fisherman and artists, many of the people who created Seabrook and helped it develop, are laid to rest here,\" Robinson wrote.\n\nRobinson noted that family names such as Brown, Eaton, Falch (now Felch), Fowler, Janvrin and Knowles, still prominent in Seabrook politics and culture, bring to life the early days of the town's settlers as far back as the Revolutionary War. One of them, John R. Beckman, (1753-1845), was a member of the New Hampshire Militia in 1776, for a period of five months. Nicholas Falch (1755-1840) fought at the Battle of Bennington. Thomas Fowler, (1761-1842) served in the New Hampshire Militia for the defense of West Point, while his son, Thomas Fowler Jr., (1794-1854) was drafted into the War of 1812.\n\nThe Civil War laid its claim to Seabrook citizens, including Robert T. Morgan (1831-1862), who, at age 31, died from injuries he suffered at the Battle of Bull Run. Henry A. Felch, (1852-1888), was a mere 12 or 13 years old at the time he enlisted, perhaps as a drummer boy, bugler or musician. A town landmark, the Raymond E. Walton Post, American Legion, bears his name after he lost his life in World War I at age 23 in France.\n\nRobinson's report includes names of the many Beckman family members, 50 of whom are buried in Methodist Cemetery with dates back to the 1860s, and another 49 found in the Hillside Cemetery. One member, John R. Beckman fought in the Revolutionary War while another, Hervey Beckman, (1873-1963) was a well-known fiddler who began playing at town dances at the age of 15. Other personal notes relay that he was a cobbler out of his Farm Lane home, as well as a clam digger and an employee of the Boston and Maine Railroad, and a bird decoy carver. The Beckman family name today is evident in Beckman Landing, an area of homes at the end of Farm Lane bordering the Hampton Harbor Inlet.\n\nOther early settlers whose names are revealed in the Smithtown Cemetery include many generations of the Brown family, including Capt. John Lewis Brown (1818-1986), sea captain of a fishing schooner, and Lincoln L. Brown (1868-1929), a railroad conductor who also held many civic positions in both Seabrook and at the state level. The Smith family, from which the name of the Smithtown Cemetery was derived, is another prominent name synonymous with the town's founding members.\n\nRobinson, who was also responsible for the addition of the Brown Library to New Hampshire's Register of Historic Places, said part of her inspiration for the cemetery recognition came from Seabrook Public Works Department Manager John Starkey, who oversees the maintenance of the cemetery. Starkey has expressed concern about the cemetery's deteriorating retaining wall which runs along Lafayette Road, and Robinson's success with the placement of Hillside Cemetery on the N.H. Register of Historic Places may aid him in his attempts to acquire grants for the wall's restoration.\n\nRobinson said she spent about month gathering information for her report, which she submitted a year ago.\n\n\"I worked very closely with the Historical Society of Seabrook,\" Robinson said, adding that she had a great deal of help from Historical Society member Evelyn Fowler. She said she used photos from the collection of Historical Society president Eric Small."
