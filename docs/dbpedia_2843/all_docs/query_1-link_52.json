        "text": "David Joseph Borges passed away at the age of 42 on Friday, January 12, 2024, in Healdsburg, California. He is survived by his mother, Kirstine Keel, daughter, Isabella Adams, sister Stephanie Sharp, brother-in-law Ernest Brown and nephews Edward and Nicolas Brown. David, was the first-born of four brothers. Derek, Dylan and Daniel have preceded him in death.\n\nRecognized early for his keen intellect, David was an avid reader, talented poet and loved roasting marshmallows on a campfire. He loved to teach his daughter how to swim, ride her bike and encouraged her to be confident in pursuing her dreams. His concern for others led him to advocate for the carry of Naloxone shots by first responders in the state of Utah. His appearance on CW30 News contributed to positive election results. Family and friends loved his sense of humor and ability to recognize truth which also drew others to him.\n\nDavidâ€™s funeral will be held at 11 AM on Saturday, February 10th at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 355 East Center Street, Springville, UT. Interment will be at the Spanish Fork Cemetery, 420 South 400 East, Spanish Fork, Utah.\n\nFor those unable to join us in person, you may view the Services via YouTube on Saturday, February 10th beginning at 11:00 am at the following link: https://youtube.com/live/fOTjp382sD0\n\nCondolences for the family may be expressed on this page."
