        "text": "Birth*5 May 1706Nathaniel Bolton was born on 5 May 1706 in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England).1,2 (6th Son) Guardianship4 June 1722Nathaniel was a minor child of 15, and his siblings, Joseph and Abigail Bolton, were also minors when their father died on 21 December 1721. Nathaniel at age 15 and Joseph at age 17, both being under the age of 21 and above the age of 14 were, under the law, permitted to choose their own guardians. Both Nathaniel and Joseph chose their mother, Sarah (Chesebrough) Bolton, and she was approved by the court on 4 June 1722. Abigail, who was only 12, was under the age of 14 and, on the same date, the court appointed the children's mother guardian of Abigail, as well.\n\nSarah's guardianship duties to all three of her minor children, as instructed by the court, were to take them into her care and tuition until their majority at age 21. She was directed, for each child, to take into her hands and possession, to their benefit, their estates, lands, moneys, goods and chattels for the purpose of improving them in such a manner as she should judge best for them. She was also instructed to submit a plain and true account of her guardianship for each upon oath, and to include all and singular such estate that came into her hands and possession by virtue of her guardianship, and to account for the profits and improvements of each of the minor children's estates. She would be lawfully required to pay and deliver the accounting, and as much of the estate remaining, after first being examined and allowed by the appropriate judge, as each child reached the age of full majority.3,4 (6th Son) Estate and Land5 April 1723The personal estate of Nathaniel's father, John Bolton, late of Bridgewater, after the payment of debts and charges, was divided by agreement between Sarah, his widow, and their children.\n\nA special committee of five good and sufficient freeholders, Josiah Edson Esq., Nathaniel Hayward, Joseph Edson, Nathaniel Brett and John Field, was appointed by Judge Isaac Winslow to determine a fair distribution of real estate that John Bolton died seized of in the County of Plymouth. The committee's task was completed on 5 April 1723 and included setting off the widow Sarah Bolton's Dower or Thirds of housing and lands, and also setting off an equitable portion or share of land for each of the couple's ten children, John Bolton Jr., Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth Bolton, Nicholas Bolton, Mary Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton, and Abigail Bolton.\n\nNathaniel Bolton, the couple's sixth and youngest son, received the portion or share defined by the committee as Lot# 8. It was bounded south-westerly by his sister Mary's Lot# 7, lying 15 rods and 7 feet in breadth, and was bounded north-easterly by a stake with stones around it and ranging in length south-east and by east and north-west and by west across the 50 acres. Added also to Nathaniel's Lot# 8 to complete his share was 1 acre of land lying in the lower lands by the river which was bounded south-westerly by his brother Joseph's Lot# 4, and easterly by his mother's land, and bounded north-westerly by Jonathan Sprague's range.5,6 (Brother) Land Transfer16 February 1730The surviving siblings of John Bolton Jr., all residing in Bridgewater and consisting of Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton and Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth (Bolton) May and Abigail Bolton and their husbands, William Leonard and Michael May, children and heirs of John Bolton, late of Bridgewater, signed a deed agreement on 16 February 1730, registered on 13 March 1743, stating that their honored father, had in his lifetime, sold to their brother John Bolton Jr. of Bridgewater, yeoman, for a valuable consideration, a small parcel of land containing by estimation one acre and a half which lay adjoining to their brother's land where he then lived in Bridgewater. The land was described as beginning at a stake and heap of stones which was on bounds of his own land, then running northerly about 5 rods to a red oak tree marked on two sides and running still on the low range 6 rods and a half further to a stake and a heap of stones. From there running easterly about 20 rods (by a double red oak and a single red oak) to a rock by the side of the river, then bounded by the river upstream to John Bolton Jr.'s land. Then by his land to the bounds first mentioned. The deed then stated that, because their honored father did not give a deed to their brother, they separately and together, released all claim to the tract or parcel of land to their brother.7 (6th Son) Estate and Land25 September 1730Nathaniel's sister, Mary Bolton, had died intestate and the settlement and distribution of her real estate was completed on 25 September 1730. Mary's estate was divided into ten equal shares and distributed between her mother, Sarah (Chesebrough) Bolton, and brothers and sisters, John Bolton, Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth (Bolton) May, Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton, and Abigail Bolton.\n\nA special committee of five freeholders consisting of Joseph Alden, whose land bordered the deceased's, and Joseph Edson, Eleazer Carver, Daniel Hudson and Jonathan Sprague had earlier been appointed by Judge Isaac Winslow on 15 June 1730 to inventory Mary's land and to determine, in their best judgment, an equitable division of her real estate, which they estimated to be 6 acres. Their recommendation, submitted to the court on 10 August 1730 and approved on 21 August 1730, distributed the lands into ten equal shares or lots.\n\nNathaniel received the lot identified by the committee as the third share. It was on the south side of the lot distributed to his brother Elisha, joining it, and containing about 3/4 of an acre of land. It began at the south-east corner, and from there ranged north 56 degrees west 20 rods to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged north 60 degrees west 30 rods to a stake and heap of stones and from there ranged south 30 degrees west 4 rods to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged south 64 degrees east 30 rods and 1/2 to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged south 56 degrees east 16 rods and 1/2 to a stake and heap of stones, standing by the highway and bounding by the highway 4 rods to the bounds first mentioned at the south-east corner of his lot.8,9 (Defendant) Court ActionMarch 1730/31 In March 1730/31, the Court of Common Pleas for Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), recorded the case of Samuel Packard of Bridgewater v. John Bolton, Samuel Bolton, Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton and Nathaniel Bolton, all Husbandmen of Bridgewater, as Trespass: Defendants pleaded they cut the trees mentioned in the writ, but were not guilty of trespass because they were in possession. The jury verdict was for the Defendants, and for costs taxed at Â£5.16s.3d.10 (Witness to Deed) Land Transfer12 February 1732Joseph Bolton of Bridgewater, in the County of Plymouth in New England, signed a deed agreement on 12 February 1732 to sell a certain piece of land in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, to his brother-in-law Michael May and sister Elizabeth (Bolton) May, his Wife, also of Bridgewater, for the sum of One Hundred and Ten Pounds. The deed was witnessed by Nathaniel Bolton and Samuel Bolton, brothers of Joseph Bolton and Elizabeth May, on 5 Mar 1732 and recorded on 13 Dec 1732. The land was described as containing by estimation twelve acres, be there more or less, bounded as follows: Beginning at a Stake and Heap of Stones by the Highway which is the South Easterly corner and from there bounded Northerly as the fence now stands next to his brother Elisha Bolton's land to a Stake and Heap of Stones by the Side of the Swamp and then running North Easterly to the land of Joseph Alden, and then bounded by the land of Joseph Alden Westerly to the land of John Willis and then bounded by the land of John Willis Southerly to the Highway and then by the Highway to the bounds first mentioned.11 Land Transfer*1 May 1734Nathaniel Bolton, husbandman, of Bridgewater, in the County of Plymouth, signed a deed agreement on 1 May 1734 to sell all his right and title in lands that his father died seized of in the township of Dorchester alias Stoughton, Suffolk County, to David Leach, husbandman, of Kingston, Plymouth County, for the sum of twenty pounds current money of New England. The deed was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of witnesses Thomas Willis and Susanna Willis, and on 20 August 1734, Josiah Edson Esq., a Plymouth County Justice of the Peace, verified that Nathaniel had personally appeared before him and acknowledged the instrument to be his act and deed. The document was recorded in Suffolk County on 23 August 1734 by Samuel Gerrish, Registrar.\n\nAt the same time of Nathaniel's sale, two of his brothers, Elisha Bolton and Nicholas Bolton, each also sold land in Stoughton, Suffolk County, they had inherited from their father to David Leach, who was the brother-in-law of the brothers' niece, Ruth (Bolton) Leach. Each sale was for twenty pounds current money, and none of the brothers' deeds identified the land sold. Although the location of the Dorchester and Stoughton land each of the brothers sold was not described, it was very likely part of the land laid out previously to the right of the brother's grandfather, Nicholas Bolton, in the Twenty-Five Divisions of Land late in the township of Dorchester and now in the township of Stoughton. When their grandfather died in 1683, their father, John Bolton, inherited the land, and when he died in December of 1721, the remaining Dorchester/Stoughton land was passed on to Nathaniel and his siblings, each receiving a one-ninth part.12 (Brother) Land Transfer22 August 1734 The deed identified the land as his ninth part of all the lands that his father died seized of in the township of Dorchester in the County of Suffolk, both divided and undivided -- except one lot of land containing thirty-three acres lying.12 (Brother) Land Transfer23 August 1734 Although the location of the Dorchester and Stoughton land each of the brothers sold was not described, it was very likely part of the land laid out previously to the right of the brother's grandfather.12 (Brother) Land Transfer23 February 1735 On 23 February 1735, for the sum of sixty pounds, his brother Elisha purchased back all of the land in the township of Stoughton, Suffolk County, that the three brothers had just, a few months before, sold to David Leach of Kingston. The deed was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of Benjamin White, Justice of the Peace and recorded in Suffolk County on 31 October 1765 by Ezekiel Goldthwait, Registrar.13 Marriage*24 March 1739/40He married Deborah (Washburn) Ripley, daughter of Israel Washburn and Waitstil Sumner, on 24 March 1739/40 in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England). The marriage notation said she was the widow of John Ripley and the daughter of Isaac Washburn.1,14 (Soldier) French & Indian War6 October 1755Nathaniel Bolton appeared on a Return dated 6 October 1755 in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England). The return, made by Josiah Edson Jr., Commissary of the Musterers, stated Nathaniel was age 48, his birthplace Bridgewater and that his residence was also Bridgewater. It reported that Nathaniel had been furnished with a gun fit for service. Another return, also dated 06 Oct 1755, but in Scituate, Plymouth County, listed Nathaniel as one of the men in Captain Edward Curtis's Company, Colonel Thomas Clap's Regiment who had been enlisted and impressed for reinforcing the army against Crown Point. Nathaniel was acknowledged as having a \"good firelock.\"15,16 (Centinel) French & Indian War22 December 1755Nathaniel Bolton appeared as a Centinel on a Muster Roll of a company in His Majesty's service under the command of Captain Joseph Washburn on the Crown Point Expedition, Crown Point, Essex County, New York, in 1755. Nathaniel's residence was noted as Bridgewater, Plymouth County. He had entered the service on 15 Sep 1755 and served until 22 December 1755, for a length of service of 14 weeks, 1 day. He was given 16 days of billeting (lodging) and travel time from Albany to Bridgewater.17 (Husband) Death26 March 1759Nathaniel became a widower when Deborah (Washburn) Ripley Bolton died on 26 March 1759.1,18,19 (Soldier) French & Indian War12 April 1759Nathaniel Bolton and his nephew, John Bolton, both of Bridgewater, appeared on a Return dated 12 April 1759 in Scituate, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), of men enlisted or impressed for His Majesty's service in Colonel Thomas Clap's Regiment for the invasion of Canada. Nathaniel's enlistment date was 06 Apr, he stated his age as 50, although he was actually 52 years old and was recorded to have served in a former expedition at Crown Point in 1755. His nephew John had enlisted 8 days earlier.20,21 (Soldier) French & Indian War11 May 1759Nathaniel Bolton and William Bolton were among those who appeared on the list of Massachusetts Soldiers who landed at Halifax, Halifax County, Nova Scotia Province, Canada, with Captain Josiah Thacher's Company, Colonel John Thomas's Regiment on 11 May 1759. The notations following Nathaniel's name indicated that he was from Bridgewater and that he was in Halifax on 26 Jun 1760.22 (Father-Possible) BirthNathaniel Bolton may have been the father of Apollos Bolton. Our only clue to the parentage of Apollos, at this point in our research, is that our first (and only) finding of his name in any records, was on a list of Revolutionary War Soldiers who served from Oakham, Worcester County, Massachusetts. Two other Bolton men, Nathaniel Jr. and Elias, were also listed and both were sons of Nathaniel Bolton of Bridgewater. So, we wonder... Was Apollos Bolton their brother?23 (Private) French & Indian War28 February 1760Nathaniel Bolton of Bridgewater and his nephew, William Bolton of Halifax, both appeared as Privates on a Muster Roll of a company in His Majesty's service under the command of Captain Josiah Thacher, in Colonel John Thomas's Regiment serving in Halifax, Halifax County, Nova Scotia Province. The roll was endorsed in 1759 and dated 28 February 1760. Nathaniel began his service on 06 Apr and served until 1 Nov, probably 1759, although the year was not given. He served for 30 weeks.24,25 (Private) French & Indian War28 February 1760Nathaniel Bolton appeared as a Private on a Roll of Officers and Men in Captain Josiah Thacher's Company, Colonel John Thomas's Regiment, in service at Halifax, Halifax County, Nova Scotia Province. Nathaniel's service began on 01 Jan 1760 and he was discharged on 28 February 1760.26 (Private) French & Indian War18 July 1760Nathaniel Bolton appeared as a Private on a Roll of Officers and Men in Captain Josiah Thacher's Company, Colonel Nathan Thwing's Regiment in service at Nova Scotia Province, Canada. Nathaniel's service began 01 Jan 1760 and he was discharged on 18 July 1760.26 (Private) French & Indian War13 January 1761Nathaniel Bolton's Company commander, Captain Josiah Thacher, signed an Account dated 13 January 1761 in Boston, Suffolk County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), of amounts due him from various men. Nathaniel appeared on the list for a charge of 10 shillings for cash and for cash paid for damage done to his gun.27 Marriage*19 March 1761He married Jane Wetherell of Taunton on 19 March 1761 in Taunton, Bristol County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England).28 Death*8 August 1770He died in 8 August 1770 in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), at age 64.1,19 Burial*He was buried in Scotland Graveyard, Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), and either their record, or its transcription, noted the year as 1769.29 (3rd Great Granduncle) LineageHe may have been a 3rd great-granduncle of Harry Emmett Bolton, who stated to the New England Historic and Genealogical Society, sometime before his death in 1958, that he was unable to prove the ancestry of his great-grandfather, Lemuel Bolton, but he believed that Lemuel was the son of William, the son of Nathaniel, the son of Nicholas, the Immigrant. Our research indicates that Harry's 2nd Great-Grandfather, if William Bolton, was actually the son of Elisha Bolton, Nathaniel's brother. It appears from the French & Indian War records that the young William was very close to his Uncle Nathaniel, and they may have continued their close relationship later in life as well. Nathaniel and Elisha Bolton were sons of John Bolton who was the son of the immigrant Nicholas Boulton.30,31\n\nBirth*17 April 1695Nicholas Bolton was born on 17 April 1695 in Bridgewater, Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England).1,2 Marriage*He married Mary __?__.1 (3rd Son) Estate and Land5 April 1723The personal estate of Nicholas' father, John Bolton, late of Bridgewater, after the payment of debts and charges, was divided by agreement between Sarah, his widow, and their children.\n\nA special committee of five good and sufficient freeholders, Josiah Edson Esq., Nathaniel Hayward, Joseph Edson, Nathaniel Brett and John Field, was appointed by Judge Isaac Winslow to determine a fair distribution of real estate that John Bolton died seized of in the County of Plymouth. The committee's task was completed on 5 April 1723 and included setting off the widow Sarah Bolton's Dower or Thirds of housing and lands, and also setting off an equitable portion or share of land for each of the couple's ten children, John Bolton Jr., Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth Bolton, Nicholas Bolton, Mary Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton, and Abigail Bolton.\n\nNicholas Bolton, the couple's third son, received the portion or share defined by the committee as Lot# 2. It was bounded with the river and bounded south-westerly by his brother Samuel's Lot# 1 to Jonathan Sprague's range, so keeping his range 10 rods to a stake which was the northerly corner bound, and then ranging south-east 5 degrees easterly to the river.3,4 (Brother) Land Transfer16 February 1730The surviving siblings of John Bolton Jr., all residing in Bridgewater and consisting of Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton and Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth (Bolton) May and Abigail Bolton and their husbands, William Leonard and Michael May, children and heirs of John Bolton, late of Bridgewater, signed a deed agreement on 16 February 1730, registered on 13 March 1743, stating that their honored father, had in his lifetime, sold to their brother John Bolton Jr. of Bridgewater, yeoman, for a valuable consideration, a small parcel of land containing by estimation one acre and a half which lay adjoining to their brother's land where he then lived in Bridgewater.

From there running easterly about 20 rods (by a double red oak and a single red oak) to a rock by the side of the river, then bounded by the river upstream to John Bolton Jr.'s land. Then by his land to the bounds first mentioned. The deed then stated that, because their honored father did not give a deed to their brother, they separately and together, released all claim to the tract or parcel of land to their brother.5 (3rd Son) Estate and Land25 September 1730Nicholas' sister, Mary Bolton, had died intestate and the settlement and distribution of her real estate was completed on 25 September 1730. Mary's estate was divided into ten equal shares and distributed between her mother, Sarah (Chesebrough) Bolton, and brothers and sisters, John Bolton, Samuel Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard, Elizabeth (Bolton) May, Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton, Nathaniel Bolton, and Abigail Bolton.\n\nA special committee of five freeholders consisting of Joseph Alden, whose land bordered the deceased's, and Joseph Edson, Eleazer Carver, Daniel Hudson and Jonathan Sprague had earlier been appointed by Judge Isaac Winslow on 15 June 1730 to inventory Mary's land and to determine, in their best judgment, an equitable division of her real estate, which they estimated to be 6 acres. Their recommendation, submitted to the court on 10 August 1730 and approved on 21 August 1730, distributed the lands into ten equal shares or lots.\n\nNicholas received the lot identified by the committee as the fourth share. It contained about 3/4 of an acre of land lying on the south side of the share distributed to his brother Nathaniel. It began at the south-east corner at a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged north 56 degrees west 16 rods to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged north 64 degrees west 30 rods and1/2 to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged south 30 degrees west 5 rods to a stake and heap of stones, then ranged south 68 degrees east 30 rods and 3/4 to a stake and heap of stones, and from there ranged south 56 degrees east 13 rods to a stake and heap of stones standing by the highway, and bounding by the highway 4 rods to the bounds first mentioned at the south-east corner of his lot.6,7 (3rd Brother) Land Records22 February 1730/31 On 22 February 1730/31, Nicholas Bolton, Sarah (Bolton) Leonard and her husband William Leonard, Elizabeth (Bolton) May and her husband Michael May and Joseph Bolton, all of Bridgewater, sold to Jonathan Washburn of Bridgewater, for the sum of Â£40, the land in Bridgewater they had, a few months earlier, received as heirs in the distribution of their deceased sister Mary Bolton's estate. Josiah Edson and Sarah Edson witnessed the signatures of the Boltons and their husbands on 22 February 1730/31 and the deed was recorded in Plymouth County on 18 May 1761. It described the property as four tenths part of their sister Mary's real estate, being the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh shares as described, with the details of quantity and bounds, in the earlier settlement document for the division of Mary Bolton's estate on file with the Judge of Probate.8 (Defendant) Court ActionMarch 1730/31 In March 1730/31, the Court of Common Pleas for Plymouth County, Massachusetts Bay Province (New England), recorded the case of Samuel Packard of Bridgewater v. John Bolton, Samuel Bolton, Nicholas Bolton, Elisha Bolton, Joseph Bolton and Nathaniel Bolton, all Husbandmen of Bridgewater, as Trespass: Defendants pleaded they cut the trees mentioned in the writ, but were not guilty of trespass because they were in possession. The jury verdict was for the Defendants, and for costs taxed at Â£5.16s.3d.9 Land Transfer*22 August 1734Nicholas Bolton, labourer, of Bridgewater, in the County of Plymouth, signed a deed agreement on 22 August 1734 to sell land to David Leach, yeoman, of Kingston, Plymouth County, for the sum of twenty pounds current money of New England. The deed identified the land as his ninth part of all the lands that his father died seized of in the township of Dorchester in the County of Suffolk, both divided and undivided -- except one lot of land containing thirty-three acres lying in Stoughton, in the County of Suffolk, beside the lot of John Cowen. The deed was signed with Nicholas' mark, sealed and delivered in the presence of witnesses Daniel Johnson and Mary Perkins, and Isaac Johnson, a Justice of the Peace, verified that Nicholas had personally appeared before him and acknowledged the instrument to be his act and deed. The document was recorded in Suffolk County on 23 August 1734 by Samuel Gerrish, Registrar.\n\nAt the same time of Nicholas' sale, two of his brothers, Elisha Bolton and Nathaniel Bolton, each also sold land in Stoughton they had inherited from their father to David Leach, who was the brother-in-law of the brothers' niece, Ruth (Bolton) Leach. Each sale was for twenty pounds current money, and only the deed for the sale of Nicholas gave any indication of the location of any of the brothers' inherited land.\n\nAlthough the Dorchester and Stoughton land each of the brothers sold was not described, it was very likely part of the land laid out previously to the right of the brother's grandfather, Nicholas Boulton the Immigrant, in the Twenty-Five Divisions of Land late in the township of Dorchester and now in the township of Stoughton. When their grandfather died in 1683, their father, John Bolton, inherited the land, and when he died in December of 1721, the remaining Dorchester/Stoughton land was passed on to Nicholas and his siblings, each receiving a one-ninth part.10 (Brother) Land Transfer23 February 1735 On 23 February 1735, for the sum of sixty pounds, his brother Elisha purchased back all of the land in the township of Stoughton, Suffolk County, that the three brothers had just, a few months before, sold to David Leach of Kingston. The deed was signed, sealed and delivered in the presence of Benjamin White, Justice of the Peace and recorded in Suffolk County on 31 October 1765 by Ezekiel Goldthwait, Registrar.11 (Husband) Death2 March 1747Nicholas became a widower when Mary (__?__) Bolton died on 2 March 1747.12,13,1 MarriageHe may have married second Judith __?__. We are far from certain about who the widow Judith Bolton was, or which of the Boltons she married. We suspect, though, that it may have been Nicholas, whose first wife Mary had died in 1747. Nicholas died in 1750, so if he had married a second time, his wife would have been a widow at the time the widow Judith Bolton first appeared to us in her baptismal in Bridgewater in 1751. All of the other Plymouth County Boltons in our Bolton Project were either alive and accounted for after 1751 or had died with widows already identified who lived beyond that year. Nicholas is our \"last man standing\" until we find additional information to help us identify Judith.14,15 Death*2 March 1750He died on 2 March 1750 in Bridgewater at age 54.16,17"
