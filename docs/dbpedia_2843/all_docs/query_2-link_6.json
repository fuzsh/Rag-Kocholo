His forty-minute trip by balloon from Philadelphia to Deptford Township was the actual beginning of the aero-space age in our hemisphere.\n\nBarnsboro Hotel\n\nLocated in center of Barnsboro\n\nThe original section of this old hotel was built of cedar logs twelve by sixteen inches squared, and was standing as early as 1720, then owned by John Budd. John Barnes, from whom Barnsboro takes its name, was issued the first license for an inn March 19th, 1778.\n\nFour old fireplaces were made of one-inch bricks. The added sections of the building make it now of three levels.\n\nPrivately Owned\n\nThe Benjamin Clark House\n\nOn the east side of the Woodbury-Glassboro Road, Deptford Township\n\nThis was the original Benjamin Clark farm.

It was constructed with cedar clapboards and much of the interior is in its original state. Several Indian sites have been found on the 80-acre tract where the house is located, and one of the oldest landmarks on the farm is a boundary marker dated 1731. The farm's owner, Charles Quay, established one of the nation's largest private collections of antique farm implements and memorabilia.\n\nPrivately Owned\n\nChew House\n\n436 East Barber Ave., Woodbury\n\nThe oldest part of this house is the story-and-a-half section at the west with a dormer window breaking the gabled roof line.

This was in the early days a rendezvous of a famous sporting club with membership from Philadelphia and Gloucester County. It got its name because the hunters of the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club (1766 to 1818) often gathered at the inn after the chase. This was the first such hunt club in America. Here the Philadelphia members served a delightful repast and the Gloucester County members could promise good sport with horses, dogs and a fox. The chase even led the sportsmen as far as Salem. During the Revolution it was used for recruiting and as a military headquarters.\n\nPrivately Owned\n\nDeptford Free School Building\n\n33 Delaware Street, Woodbury\n\nThe Quakers erected this building in 1774 as a one-story school.

Just when this sturdy building was erected, no one seems to know, but it was before 1826, for on March 8, 1826 Phebe Cake petitioned to have the license continued.\n\nIt once had a large cook house adjoining the tavern with an immense cook stove. Shelves lined two walls with all things ready and necessary for a meal. Crocks stood full of preserves, mince-meat, jams and jellies. In the old smoke house hung hams, beef and meat galore.

Lawrence's younger brother, James, lived in the house and received his education at Woodbury Academy. In 1813 James was fatally wounded on the deck of his ship.

In 1771 Bishop Asbury makes mention of preaching at Jesse Chew's, in his diary. Jesse was regarded like many Methodists in those days as a Tory.\n\nWhen the British marched up from Hancocks Bridge after that depredation, they came thru Barnsboro. Hearing of the British coming, the family took up the hearth stones in front of the huge fireplace and buried the family silver. When the troops arrived they served them food and drink and they marched on.

It is known that during the mid-19th century, Mr. West Jessup owned this house and 120 acres immediately surrounding it. Jessup was one of the largest land owners in Gloucester County at this time. There's a strong possibility that the home was moved to its present location just prior to Jessup's ownership, which would explain the absence of early records pertaining to the house in this area.\n\nPrivately Owned\n\nThe Parish-Moore House\n\n127 North Broad Street, Woodbury\n\nBuilt in the early 19th century, this fine brick home boasts a symmetrical Georgian five-bay facade.
