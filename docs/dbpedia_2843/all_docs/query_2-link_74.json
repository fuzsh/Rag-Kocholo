Historically, public lots at Green-Wood were the most affordable burial sites. Over one-third of the 570,000 burials at Green-Wood are located in public lots or single graves (the modern equivalent.) However, many of the graves from the Victorian era and early 20th century were never memorialized. These biographies, all from unmarked graves, aim to make visible what is not apparent in the landscape and bring to the forefront the lives of individuals that have slipped out of our visual, and historical record.\n\nIn my preparation for this exhibition, I spent a lot of time with Green-Wood’s burial ledgers, which record biographical details at the time of interment, including name, residence, cause of death, and purchase details. In some cases, this was the only record that a person existed. This small amount of information was enough to draw my attention towards certain individuals – the tragic circumstances of their death, or a question about the relationship between two people buried together – and it helped me choose which people to focus on for further genealogical research. With the support of several generous volunteers – Michele Dubal, Lucy Redmond and Teddy Sansone – we were able to collect more information about these individuals through census records, ship manifests, death certificates, marriage records, and newspaper archives. I used this information to create narrative biographies, bringing life back to these fragmentary details.\n\nAlthough I am not a historian, I wrote these biographies with an eye towards the conventions of that genre, rather than taking broader artistic license to interpret. I try not to make assumptions that are not backed by records, and when I do make inferences I try to be transparent. My hope is that this will open up the possibility for the reader to interpret these stories and build their own connections, and to place these stories into larger historical context. I have made the original research reports available for a similar reason: because I see this as a start, and not an end, and I want to encourage other researchers to continue.\n\nThere are many possible avenues to continue this research. Lot 88, now one of the “Freedom Lots,” was a segregated lot for “Colored adults.” There are people interred in this lot who were born enslaved in both the south and the north, as well as people who travelled to New York during the Great Migration, and freedmen born in New York before emancipation. There are community connections between several of the people and families I researched, and there may be further connections between others in this lot. One possible avenue for research would be to see if there are more connections to the Bridge St. AME Church, which is the oldest documented Black congregation in the Brooklyn-Long Island area, and which was once a stop on the Underground Railroad. Another is the life of William Russell Johnson, who was a prominent public figure at the turn of the 20th century, and who is buried in an unmarked grave.\n\nOne area where I do break with convention is my decision to organize this research spatially, by grave, rather than by individual names. This allowed me to look at the relationships between those interred together in a single grave, and in Lot 88, across multiple graves. In some cases there are clear family ties. In others, there appears to be no connection between the individuals. Green-Wood was not a potter’s field, meaning all people presumably paid for their plots. Although there were some charitable burials, these were typically in private lots donated to organizations that managed their distribution to people in need. Green-Wood does not have complete records for lot purchases in the public lots for the time periods I researched. I feel like further research in this area could illuminate more about the history of class dynamics at Green-Wood and how it influenced the landscape of the cemetery.\n\nAdditionally, I want to thank Stacy Locke, Jeff Richman and Gabrielle Gatto for their assistance navigating archives, connecting me to volunteers and advising me on how to structure this research."
