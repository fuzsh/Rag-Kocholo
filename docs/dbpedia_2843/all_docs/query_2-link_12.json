Hugh was preceded in death by his paternal grandparents, Robert and Leura Franklin; maternal grandparents, Lawrence and Sarah Wyatt. Hugh was employed at Haywood Regional Medical Center as a Phlebotomist for many years. He was the \"best Phlebotomist\" where patients often ask to only see him. Hugh had a contagious smile and brought calm to those around him. He was an instructor at Haywood Community College in the Phlebotomy program as well. Hugh enjoyed outdoor life, carpentry, landscaping and working on cars. He especially loved his kids.\n\nIn addition to Hugh’s parents, he is survived by two sons, Hunter Lane Franklin and Colby Wyatt Franklin; sister, Tina Powell, and her husband, Scott, all of Waynesville; two nieces, a great-niece and a great-nephew.\n\nA funeral service will be held at 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, May 1, 2022, at Antioch Baptist Church with Reverend Chris Wilmoth officiating. Burial will follow at Fulbright Cemetery. The family will receive friends from 1:00 p.m. until service time at the church. Serving as pallbearers will be Allan James, Scott Powell, Nick Amezquita, Johnny Glance, Larry Greene and Tony Greene.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials may be made to one’s favorite charity.\n\nThe care of Mr. Franklin has been entrusted to Wells Funeral Home of Waynesville."
