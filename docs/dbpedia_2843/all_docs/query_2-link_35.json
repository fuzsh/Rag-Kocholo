        "text": "In Loving Memory of Carl A. Moertle Jr.\n\nCarl A. Moertle, Jr., aged 89, of North Bend, Ohio, passed away unexpectedly at his home on July 23, 2023. He was born on January 15, 1934, in Cincinnati, Ohio, to Mary Moertle (nee Newman) and Carl Moertle Sr., both of whom he joined in eternal rest. Carl attended St. Lawrence Latin School and graduated from Elder High School in 1951. In 1958, he married the love of his life, Carol Moertle (nee Kleinberg), who sadly preceded him in death in 2010. He continued his education by attending evening classes at the University of Cincinnati.\n\nA devoted father, Carl is survived by his six children: Mary (Richard) Skaats, Robert (Kelly) Moertle, Susan (the late Dorian Ladue) Moertle, James (Amy) Moertle, Amy Wyatt, and Laura (Joe) Clark. He was a cherished pawpaw to 11 grandchildren: Katie (Brian) Jabeck, Nick (Heather) Skaats, Benjamin Moertle, Kiersten (Andy) Schatzel, Jason Moertle, Paige (Tom) McNamara, Jennifer Moertle, Emily Moertle, Courtney Clark, Steven Wyatt, and Abigail Brown, and an adored great-grandpa to 22 great-grandchildren: Aidan Frommeyer; Logan and Brooks Jabeck; Kaelynn and Aneleigh Meyer; Austin, Luke, Alyssa and Christian Skaats; Paxton, Knox, Kennedy and Jax Schatzel; Hayden and Killian Moertle; Lucas and Mallory Davis; Rory and Jack McNamara; Isabella and Leia Wyatt. Each child held a special place in his heart.\n\nCarl spent much of his working life at The Cincinnati Gas & Electric company, retiring as a supervisor in the Gas Operating Department in 1992. He worked diligently to provide for his six children, taking on additional jobs at Hoinke Bowling Lanes and Western Bowl. Even after retirement, Carl continued to work, including stints at K-Mart and Argosy Casino as a security guard until 2016.\n\nFamily meant everything to Carl, and he cherished the time spent with them. He enjoyed unforgettable trips to various destinations with his loved ones, creating lasting memories together. Sports were another passion, and he loved watching bowling, Cincinnati Reds, Cincinnati Bengals games, and was an avid Xavier basketball fan. In his leisure time, Carl enjoyed watching wrestling matches, Dr. Phil, and the Gaither music hour on television. He was known for his love of fun and socializing, engaging in games of euchre at the Senior Center in Cleves, and playing bingo at St. Jude, St. Ilijah, and the Addyston VFW. Poker and Uno were regular favorites during family gatherings, and he relished trips to the casino for some excitement.\n\nCarl had a heart of gold and a great sense of humor, endearing him to everyone he met. Fondly remembered by his neighbors, friends, and family, he will forever be remembered as the kindest and sweetest man. His passing leaves an irreplaceable void in the lives of all who knew and loved him.\n\nIn honor of Carl A. Moertle's memory, a celebration of his life will be held to share stories, laughter, and love. May his spirit continue to live on in the hearts of those he touched."
