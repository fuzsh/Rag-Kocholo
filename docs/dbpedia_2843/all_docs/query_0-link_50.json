        "text": "American Revolutionary War Patriots Buried In Texas\n\nThere have been several efforts by the Texas SAR to memorialize those Revolutionary War Patriots who were buried in Texas. The first was the Bicentennial Patriots Plaques that were placed in 5 locations around the state in 1976. The names on the plaques were gathered by the Graves Registration Committee, SAR's, DAR's, the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission of Texas, the Institute of Texan Cultures, and others. Clovis Brakebill (Texas SAR President 1982-1983 and President General 1986-1987) published \"American Revolutionary Soldiers Buried in Texas\" in 1998 (click here for a downloadable version) which included confirmed and unconfirmed Patriots buried in Texas. The Patriot/Compatriot Graves Buried in Texas Sub-Committee compiled a comprehensive list of confirmed Patriots buried in Texas in 2023.\n\nThe Patriots Buried in Texas listings on this page are presented in two sections: Confirmed and Unconfirmed. Both sections may have footnote numbers beside a respective Patriot to indicate:\n\n1. Name is included on the Patriots Plaque\n\n2. Name is included in the Brakebill book.\n\nThe unconfirmed names have either been disproven or need additional research for proof prior to being officially marked. To submit new/corrected information about Texas SAR Patriot Graves, please use our Patriot Grave Updater.\n\nConfirmed\n\nAbston, John (1, 2) born 2 Jan 1761 in Halifax County, Virginia and died 4 Feb 1857 in Lavon, Collin County Texas, he was only 18 years old when he fought in the Battle of King's Mountain.

According to family records he served as a messenger boy during the American Revolution when a lad of twelve years -- it being safer for boys to carry the messages than men. He carried messages from the camp of General George Washington to that of Captain Robert Lemmon (his father) and others. He lived in Washington's camp in Valley Forge and affectionately called him \"Uncle George.\" Toward the end of the war James entered the Continental Army as a private and served until the end of the war. In 1800 James Lemmon married Sarah Carr and lived in Bowling Green, Ky. It was during his residence here that he volunteered for military service in the War of 1812. After her death in 1815 he moved his family of children to Indiana where he married Amy Rawlins. About 1834 they were lured by free land into Illinois where they settled in Green County â living neighbors to Roderick Rawlins. In 1844 Roderick Rawlins moved his entire family from Illinois to Texas and settled in Peters' Colony on a land-grant located partly on Ten Mile Creek in what is now known as the southern part of Dallas County. Needing some help in getting his large family to Texas, Roderick Rawlins brought along young Robert Allen Lemmon (son of James Lemmon) and also Charles Wise, neighbors and also friends of his own son \"Alec.\" These two boys were so delighted with Texas that they selected 640 acres of land lying next to the Rawlins grand and walked back to Illinois to bring their parents. When they reached the Mississippi River they fashioned a raft from drift wood â tying the wood together with stout vines and attempted to paddle directly across, but when they reached the other side they were fifteen miles down-stream and had to walk back to their destination. Robert Allen Lemmon returned with his father, James Lemmon, his mother Amy Rawlins Lemmon and his younger brother Jackson Lemmon in August 1845. James Lemmon, a citizen of the Republic of Texas, died on July 4th, 1858 at his home three miles below Lancaster on the Dallas Ellis County line.

In 1833 the family started clearing trees to build a stockade located between the present towns of Grosebeck and Medina, Texas in Limestone County. It was on May 19, 1836 that the large band of Comanche Indians approached the stockade under a white flag, but then attacked, killing five of the Parker family, and capturing Cynthia Ann Parker, who became the wife of Nacoma and the mother of Quanah Parker, chief of the Comanches.

He entered the service of the Continental Army in 1776 with the Third Regiment of the Virginia line and participated in the battles of Germantown, Brandywine, and Stony Point, as well as the siege of Charleston, where he was captured; he remained a prisoner of war until exchanged, at which time he received a promotion to lieutenant. On October 1, 1781, during a furlough, he married Margaret (Peggy) Berry in Frederick County, Virginia. He returned to active duty on October 15 and served until the war's end. Robert and Margaret Rankin had three daughters and seven sons, one of whom was Frederick Harrison Rankin. The family moved to Kentucky in 1784. In 1786 Rankin was named by the Virginia legislature as one of nine trustees for the newly established town of Washington, in Bourbon County (later Mason County), Kentucky. In 1792 he served as a delegate from Mason County to the Danville Convention, which drafted the first constitution of Kentucky. He also became an elector of the Kentucky Senate of 1792. The last mention of Rankin in Mason County, Kentucky, is in the 1800 census. The Rankins moved to Logan County, Kentucky, in 1802 and to the Tombigbee River in Mississippi Territory in 1811; the area of their home eventually became Washington County, Alabama. Four of the Rankin sons fought in the War of 1812. The family suffered a severe financial reversal around 1819-20, probably in conjunction with land speculation and the panic of 1819. In July 1828 Rankin first made an application for a pension for his Revolutionary War service. In 1832 the Rankins moved to Joseph Vehlein's colony in Texas, along with the William Butler and Peter Cartwright families. Rankin was issued a certificate of character by Jesse Grimes on November 3, 1834, as required by the Mexican government. He applied for a land grant in Vehlein's colony on November 13 of the same year and received a league and labor in October 1835. The town of Coldspring, San Jacinto County, is located on Rankin's original grant. Rankin had the reputation of being a just and diplomatic man. He was a friend of Sam Houston, and his influence with the Indians in the region was well known. Houston reputedly called upon him in the spring of 1836 to encourage neutrality among the Indians during the crucial Texan retreat toward San Jacinto. Toward the end of 1836 Rankin became ill, and he and his wife moved to St. Landry parish, Louisiana, where he died on November 13, 1837. His body was brought back to the family home near Coldspring, in the new Republic of Texas, and buried in the old Butler Cemetery. In 1936 he was reinterred at the State Cemetery in Austin. His widow lived in Texas with her sons, William and Frederick, in Polk, Montgomery, and Liberty counties until her death sometime after December 1852.
