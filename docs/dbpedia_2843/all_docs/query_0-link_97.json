We stayed in a hotel there overnight and headed for Oakland Cemetery the next morning.\n\nAccording to its website, Oakland Cemetery was deeded to the people of Iowa City by the Iowa territorial legislature on Feb. 13, 1843. The original plot was one block square. The cemetery now encompasses 40 acres. Oakland Cemetery is a non-perpetual care cemetery supported by city taxes. The staff is committed to the maintenance and preservation of privately-owned lots and accessories. It is still an active cemetery and you can purchase a plot there if you so desire.\n\nAccording to Find a Grave, Oakland Cemetery has around 16,000 graves recorded there. However, I’m sure there are more than that.\n\nTeresa Karasek Dolezal Pica Feldervert\n\nMost people visit Oakland Cemetery for one reason and that’s to see the Black Angel. This is the second Black Angel I’ve encountered in Iowa. The first was the statue in memory of Ruth Anne Dodge by sculptor Daniel Chester French that’s adjacent to Fairview Cemetery in Council Bluffs, Iowa. I wrote about that one in 2017.\n\nThe story surrounding Iowa City’s Black Angel is a bit sketchy in places and some of the specifics are unknown. But when it comes to a haunted statue, that’s kind of the norm. Right?\n\nWe do know that Terezie “Teresa” Karasek was born around 1836 in Czechoslovakia (then known as Bohemia). It was only after her death that it was discovered that she’d studied at the University of Vienna, earning the equivalent of a degree in gynecology and becoming a midwife. She reportedly delivered more than 100 babies.\n\nHer son, Eduard, or “Eddie”, was born in 1873. He was her son by Dr. Frantizek Dolezal, whom she married in 1865. She arrived with Eddie in Iowa City sometime around 1877. I’m not sure what became of Dr. Dolezal.\n\nEddie died in 1891 at age 17 of meningitis. He was buried in a crypt in a different plot in the cemetery than where he is now and a tree-shaped monument was erected in his honor. His body (and the tree marker) were later moved to the site of the Black Angel monument around 1913.\n\nOverwhelmed with grief, Teresa moved to Chicago then to Minnesota where she married Joseph Pica. She would divorce him and move to Eugene, Ore. where she met and married wealthy ranch owner Nicholas Feldevert in 1897. He was of German heritage.\n\nAt the base of the monument, you can see the words “Rodina Feldevertova”. The word “rodina” means “family” in Czech. Both Teresa and Nicholas shortened it to Feldevert at some point.\n\nWhen Nicholas died in 1911, he left Teresa a wealthy widow. Much of the money went to fund projects back in her hometown of Strmilov in Czechoslovakia.\n\nBut Teresa also wanted to honor her third husband and son, so she began making plans to commission a statue that would eventually be placed by their graves at Oakland. It would eventually be her final resting place as well.\n\nMario Korbel\n\nOn the advice of friends, Teresa contacted up and coming Czech sculptor Mario Korbel in Chicago to create a statue. She also wanted him to incorporate Eddie’s tree monument into his design. His model in clay at the Art Institute of Chicago caused a stir and Teresa gave him the green light to cast it in bronze. In July 1911, he stopped in Iowa City on his way west to check the site where it would eventually be placed.\n\nWhile waiting for Korbel to finish, Teresa had Nicholas’ remains disinterred in February 1912 and sent to Portland, Ore. to be cremated before having them sent on to Oakland Cemetery in Iowa.\n\nKorbel’s eight and a half foot statue arrived in Iowa City in November 1912. Unfortunately, Teresa didn’t like what she saw and refused to pay Korbel for his hard work. He hadn’t incorporated Eddie’s tree monument as she had requested. She also did not like the dark patina on the bronze at all.\n\nA lawsuit ensued and Teresa ended up paying for it after all. The statue was placed on its four-foot tall base. An inscription in Czech is on the side of it.\n\nThe inscription translated reads:\n\nThe sun and clouds stood above my journey/There were tough and joyful days in my life./ You did my work just to make the world better./ You fold your hands and your head goes down./ Your spirit flies away where everlasting reward/ Is waiting for you after hardship.\n\nTeresa died on Nov. 18, 1924 in Iowa City. Her remains were cremated in Davenport, Iowa, and her ashes were buried with her husband and son beside the Black Angel. She was 88 and had little money left. Her death year was never carved into the base because there was nobody left in her family to pay for it.\n\nThe Black Angel only darkened more over the years, causing people to talk. But according to an NPR article bout the statue that I found, that’s not unusual:\n\nBronze is an alloy made up of copper and zinc and sometimes even other metals like aluminum, manganese, nickel or zinc. So that metal combination can change the color. Also chemical combination called a patina is added to the surface of Bronze sculptures and that can create some interesting color changes.\n\nPaul Benson is an art conservator for the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art and he also says the environment can play a big role.\n\n“Put a sculpture out in Kansas City, put another one out in New York City they may turn completely different colors,” says Benson.\n\nThe Myths of the Black Angel\n\nThere are quite a few myths and stories surrounding the Black Angel. Many students and other Iowa City residents visit the statue, along with interested travelers like me.\n\nThe biggest night of attraction is on Halloween where visitors gather around the statue, and some test their luck by touching or kissing the statue. It’s said that if someone touches or kisses the statue they will be struck dead unless that person is a virgin.\n\nIt is also rumored that if a pregnant woman walks beneath the statue’s stretched wings that she will miscarry. Some have seen mysterious ghostly figures walking nearby. It goes on from there.\n\nThe Black Angel has been vandalized several times over the years. Her outstretched fingers have been damaged. Paint has been applied many times. It’s rather amazing that she is still intact after all these years.\n\nThe Black Angel appears in W.P. Kinsella’s 1986 novel “The Iowa Baseball Confederacy” in which the statue plays right field for the Confederacy. She also makes an appearance in Andrea Lawlor’s 2017 novel “Paul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl,” in which the titular Paul seduces a graduate student under its wings. Footage of the Black Angel is included in the music video for “Alive Twice” by the band Friendship.\n\nMore recently, a new restaurant called The Black Angel opened in Iowa City in August 2023.\n\nThe NPR article said Oakland’s grounds keeper Russell Buffington noted that people leave money and flowers for the angel. He’s found bottles of liquor given as offerings, and a lot of people have been married in front of it.\n\nTeresa’s Legacy\n\nIn the end, the ghost stories aren’t what really matter. It’s always been about one woman’s wish to keep the memories of her beloved son and her husband alive.\n\nAuthor Tim Parrot wrote a book called “The Black Angel A Centennial History 1913 – 2013”. He said Teresa didn’t care about the whispers about the statue, according to interviews with her that he’s read.\n\n“Her concern wasn’t for the Black Angel. It wasn’t about anything except her son and her last husband. She seemed very concerned about people knowing who they were.”\n\nI’ll be back next week with more stories from Oakland Cemetery.\n\nWhen I realized we would be driving right past the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library in West Branch, Iowa on our journey back to Omaha, I was determine that we’d stop. We wouldn’t have time to visit the library itself, but if it was possible to get a glimpse of Hoover’s grave, I was going to try.\n\nThis was my first official U.S. presidential grave! I’ve seen 10 more since, but seeing Hoover’s was special to me.\n\nBorn in West Branch, Iowa\n\nHerbert Clark Hoover was born in West Branch, Iowa on Aug. 10, 1874, making him the first American president to be born west of the Mississippi River.\n\nHis father, Jesse Hoover, was a blacksmith and farm implement store owner. His mother, Hulda Randall Minthorn Hoover, raised in Canada, moved to Iowa in 1859. They were Quakers. From what I’ve read, he had a happy early childhood.\n\nJesse died in 1880 at age 34 of a sudden heart attack and Hulda died in 1884 of typhoid, leaving Herbert and his two siblings orphans. Hoover lived the next 18 months with his paternal uncle Allen Hoover at a nearby farm.\n\nIn November 1885, Hoover went to Newberg, Ore., to live with his maternal uncle John Minthorn, a Quaker physician and businessman. The Minthorn household was considered cultured and educational, and imparted in Herbert a strong work ethic.\n\nWe did watch a film at the visitor’s center before they closed. I was curious to know why, since Hoover only lived in West Branch nine years, did he choose it as the site for his presidential library? Apparently, Hoover always had fond memories of his childhood in West Branch, when his parents were still living, so that’s where he wanted it.\n\nThe library and museum are located within the Herbert Hoover National Historic Site, which contains Hoover’s birthplace, a reconstruction of Hoover’s father’s blacksmith shop, a one-room schoolhouse, and a Quaker meeting house. We had time to briefly visit Hoover’s birthplace cottage then hoofed it down a long path up a hillside to his grave. The National Park Service manages the site.\n\nEarly Days\n\nPlenty of authors have written about the Hoovers, so I’m going to try to hit the highlights.\n\nHerbert Hoover was part of the inaugural class at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif. He graduated in 1895 with a degree in geology and became a mining engineer, working on a wide variety of projects on four continents.\n\nWhile a senior at Stanford, Hoover met his future wife, Waterloo, Iowa native Lou Henry. Born in 1874, Lou grew up something of a tomboy in the Monterey, Calif. area. She loved the outdoors as much as Herbert did.\n\nLou got a teaching credential in 1893 from San Jose State University (then San Jose Normal School) and worked at her father’s bank. The following year, she enrolled at Stanford to pursue a degree in geology. In 1898, Lou became the first woman to receive a bachelor’s degree in geology from Stanford, one of the first women in America to hold such a degree.\n\nMarried Life\n\nIn 1897, Hoover took an engineering job in Australia. Lou and Herbert were engaged before he left. They were married in her family’s home on Feb. 10, 1899. Herbert was hired as chief engineer of the Chinese Engineering and Mining Company in Tianjin, China, where they went after their honeymoon.\n\nCaught in China during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Hoover organized relief for trapped foreigners. Lou, who learned Chinese, treated gunshot wounds, built barricades, and rode through the area on her bicycle with a pistol patrolling with Western troops. I have to say, Lou was no slouch!\n\nThe Hoovers made their home in London in November 1901 after Herbert was offered a partnership with a British mining company. His work took them all over the world. The Hoovers had two sons who joined them as they traveled. Herbert Hoover Jr. was born in 1903, and Allan Hoover was born in 1907. The family became wealthy after Herbert’s decision to become an independent consultant in 1908.\n\nIn 1914, Hoover helped Americans stranded in Europe at the outbreak of World War I. For the next three years, he headed the Commission for Relief in Belgium, helping find food for some nine million people. His skills impressed Pres. Woodrow Wilson so much that he appointed him U.S. food administrator for the duration of the war.\n\nThe Hoovers returned to America in January 1917. When the U.S. entered World War I three months later, Herbert was appointed head of the Food and Drug Administration, and the family made their home in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter World War I\n\nHoover was tapped to head the American Relief Administration. The ARA sent food and supplies to war-ravaged Europe. The outreach to Soviet Russia garnered Hoover much criticism, but he defended his actions by saying, “Twenty million people are starving. Whatever their politics, they shall be fed.”\n\nIn 1921, President-elect Warren G. Harding chose Hoover to serve as secretary of commerce. Continuing as commerce secretary under Pres. Calvin Coolidge, Hoover spearheaded efforts that ultimately led to construction of Hoover Dam and the St. Lawrence Seaway.\n\nWhen Coolidge decided not to run for another term in 1928, Hoover received the Republican presidential nomination. Hoover and running mate Charles Curtis ran against New York Gov. Alfred E. Smith and vice presidential candidate Joseph T. Robinson in a contest that focused on Prohibition and religion. Hoover captured more than 21 million popular votes to Smith’s approximately 15 million, and he received 444 electoral votes to his Democratic opponent’s 87.\n\nPresidential Years\n\nLou was her husband’s frequent adviser while he was president. Throughout her tenure, she refused to give interviews to the press, seeing them as intrusive. Instead, she gave speeches over the radio, the first president’s wife to do so.\n\nThe stock market cash of 1929 plunged the country into the worst economic collapse in its history. Hoover parted ways with leaders of the Republican Party who thought there was nothing for the government to do but wait for the next phase of the business cycle.\n\nHoover called business leaders to the White House to urge them not to lay off workers or cut wages. He urged state and local governments to join private charities in caring for Americans made destitute by the Depression. He asked Congress to appropriate money for public works projects to expand government employment. He established new agencies such as the Federal Farm Board, the Federal Drought Relief Committee, and the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.\n\nBut Hoover would not provide direct federal relief to the unemployed. Instead, he promoted indirect relief through public works projects and loans to states. His programs proved inadequate as the number of unemployed workers increased from 7 million in 1931 to 11 million in 1933.\n\nHoover’s political reputation as the “master of emergencies” collapsed in the face of rising unemployment. Although he mounted a vigorous campaign for re-election in 1932, Hoover lost to Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Hoovers departed Washington on March 4, 1933. He was only 58.\n\nBack to Private Life\n\nWhile Hoover considered going back into politics after his defeat, the Hoovers were understandably bitter about what happened. He and Lou lived in Palo Alto until her death after a heart attack in New York City at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel on Jan. 7, 1944. Her funeral was held at St. Bartholomew’s Church in New York.\n\nHoover was a constant critic of Roosevelt. In response to continued attacks on his character and presidency, Hoover wrote more than two dozen books, including The Challenge to Liberty (1934). At the 1940 Republican National Convention, Hoover hoped for the presidential nomination, but it went to the Wendell Willkie, who lost to Roosevelt in the general election.\n\nAfter World War II, Hoover befriended President Harry Truman despite their differences. Because of Hoover’s experience with Germany at the end of World War I, Truman selected him in 1946 to tour Allied-occupied Germany and Rome, Italy to ascertain the food needs of the occupied nations. On Hoover’s initiative, a school meals program in the American and British occupation zones of Germany began on April 14, 1947. It served 3,500,000 children.\n\nIn 1954, a group of Hoover’s friends incorporated the Herbert Hoover Birthplace Foundation to raise money for preservation of his birthplace, and to plan for site improvements. One of their ideas was to build a small museum, and with Hoover’s approval work began in the late 1950s. The architectural firm of Eggers and Higgins of New York drew the plans for the original building. While the museum at West Branch was still under construction, Hoover decided to expand it and make it his Presidential Library.\n\nThe Library and Museum was officially dedicated on Aug. 10, 1962, Hoover’s 88th birthday. Hoover and former President Truman were present at the dedication.\n\nHerbert Hoover died in New York City on Oct. 20, 1964, following massive internal bleeding. Two months earlier, Hoover reached the age of 90, only the second U.S. president (after John Adams) to do so. At the time of his death, Hoover had been out of office for over 31 years. This was the longest retirement in presidential history until Jimmy Carter broke that record in September 2012. Hoover was honored with a state funeral in which he lay in state in the U.S. Capitol rotunda.\n\nOn October 25, Hoover was buried in West Branch. Lou Hoover, buried in Palo Alto following her death in 1944, was re-interred beside him soon after.\n\nThe original Library and Museum building was expanded several times. On Aug. 8, 1992, former President Ronald Reagan rededicated the Library and Museum. The $6.5 million renovation/expansion was a public–private partnership, with Washington supplying $5 million for bricks and mortar, supplementing $1.5 million raised by the Herbert Hoover Presidential Library Association for new exhibits.\n\nIowa architect William Wagner designed the memorial. Two plainly inscribed ledger stones of Vermont white marble mark the Hoover graves.\n\nAcross the curved walkway, an American flag waves. Hoover signed the congressional resolution making “The Star Spangled Banner” the national anthem during his term as president in 1931. My picture of it isn’t very good but it gives you an idea of what it looks like.\n\nIt would be easy to sink into the debate over how much Herbert Hoover was out of touch and inept as a president, as many scholars opine. But as we were heading back to our car, I thought how more interested I was in the Hoover marriage. They were both outdoor enthusiasts, highly intelligent, shared a love of geology, and were devoted to each other. I don’t doubt that they had some lively debates in their private moments. More than some presidential marriages, I think the Hoovers respected and loved each other deeply.\n\nIt was time to head to Iowa City to check into our hotel for the night. We had another Iowa cemetery stop before we returned to Nebraska.\n\nIt’s not often I visit a large cemetery and only visit a few graves, then take off. But in the case of Anamosa, Iowa’s Riverside Cemetery, that is exactly what I did. Sometimes time is not on my side.\n\nYou might remember that I talked about artist Grant Wood a few months ago when I was writing about Cedar Rapids’ Oak Hill Cemetery because Dr. Byron McKeeby is buried there. A dentist in real life, he stood is as the model for the farmer in Wood’s classic “American Gothic” painting.\n\nIn a nutshell, Riverside Cemetery has about 4,720 memorials listed on Find a Grave with the earliest death date listed in the 1840s. It’s an active cemetery with burials taking place. That’s about all I know about it.\n\nGrant Wood’s Home Town\n\nBorn in Anamosa in 1891 to Francis Maryville Wood and Hattie DeEtte Weaver Wood, Grant Devolson Wood and his mother moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa after Francis passed away in 1901. Soon after, Wood began as an apprentice in a local metal shop. After graduating from high school, Wood enrolled in the Handicraft Guild, an art school run entirely by women in Minneapolis, Minn. in 1910.\n\nIn 1913, Wood enrolled at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and performed some work as a silversmith. Near the end of World War I, Wood joined the military, working as an artist designing camouflage scenes as well as other art.\n\nFrom 1919 to 1925, Wood taught art to junior high school students in the Cedar Rapids public school system. From 1922 to 1935, Wood lived with his mother in the loft of a carriage house in Cedar Rapids, which he turned into his personal studio.\n\nBetween 1922 and 1928, Wood made four trips to Europe, where he studied many styles of painting. But it was the work of the 15th-century Flemish artist Jan van Eyck that influenced him to take on the clarity of this technique and incorporate it in his new works.\n\nIn 1932, Wood helped found the Stone City Art Colony near Anamosa to help artists get through the Great Depression. He became a great proponent of Regionalism in the arts, lecturing throughout the country on the topic.\n\nFrom 1934 to 1941, Wood taught painting at the University of Iowa’s School of Art. During that time, he supervised mural painting projects, mentored students, produced a variety of his own works, and became a key part of the university’s cultural community.\n\nOn our journey east, we stopped at Iowa State University and visited the Parks Library to see some of the murals Wood did there. According to a sign, the murals illustrate the theme put forth by Daniel Webster: “When tillage begins, other arts follow.” The murals were restored in 1974.\n\nRegionalism\n\nWood is associated with the American movement of Regionalism, primarily situated in the Midwest, and advanced figurative painting of rural American themes in an aggressive rejection of European abstraction.\n\nWood was one of three artists most associated with the movement. The others, John Steuart Curry and Thomas Hart Benton (a favorite of mine), returned to the Midwest in the 1930s due to Wood’s encouragement and assistance with locating teaching positions for them at colleges in Wisconsin and Missouri, respectively.\n\nA portrait of the Wood’s mother, “Woman With Plants” (1929), is regarded as Wood’s stylistic breakthrough, but it was “American Gothic” in 1930 that put him on the art world map and has kept him there. Alternately interpreted as a hymn to Middle American values or a spoof of them, it caused a sensation when it first appeared at the Art Institute of Chicago and has since been endlessly reproduced and parodied in all kinds of media.\n\nWood died of pancreatic cancer one day before his 51st birthday on Feb. 12, 1942. A lounging lion dominated the family stone in the middle of the plot.\n\nGrant is buried with his parents, his brother, John (who died in 1935), and his sister, Nan (who was the farmer’s daughter in “American Gothic”). Nan died in 1990 and spent the last decades of her life promoting her famous brother’s work. I did not get a picture of her marker, unfortunately.\n\nWhite Bronze Beauty\n\nIt was a delight to find a few white bronze markers scattered about Riverside Cemetery. This one for Adeline Spaulding Smith caught my eye due to the fact it was in such good condition. The clam shell on top is still intact as well. I’d never seen one up close before.\n\nBorn in Maquoketa, Iowa in 1850 to master carpenter Alonzo Spaulding and Mary Sheerer Spaulding, Adeline Brown Spaulding was one of four children the couple had. On Nov. 4, 1873, she married Scottish immigrant James E. Smith in Cedar Falls, Iowa. Before that time, her death notice told me, she had been a school teacher in the Cedar Falls, Iowa public schools.\n\nAdeline died on Oct. 7, 1878 after a short illness at age 28. Her body was returned to Anamosa so she could be buried with grandmother in Riverside Cemetery. Adeline’s husband, James, moved to Vermont to be near his mother and died there in 1933. I don’t know what became of the little child they adopted before Adeline died.\n\nThe next two white bronze markers, I later learned, are cenotaphs. That means the people they represent are not actually buried there.\n\nOn the left is the cenotaph for Martha “Patty” Eyre Booth. According to her Find a Grave memorial:\n\nShe is listed on the cemetery records as “Mrs. Martha Booth,” but she was the widow of Peter Booth, and had married a second time, to Levi Rumrill. But Rumrill also predeceased her by a number of years. Where Martha actually is buried is not known. After Rumrill’s death, she came to Anamosa, Iowa, in June 1840, where several of her children were, and she reverted to the “Booth” name. It is believed that she was buried in Wilcox Cemetery near Fairview, Iowa — where her son Edmund’s first daughter — who died at age 17 months — was buried. But the location of the graves was lost. Thus the cenotaphs in the Anamosa cemetery with the rest of the family.\n\nMrs. Booth died on June 28, 1854, many years before white bronze markers were being made. So it was placed much later.\n\nOn the right is a smaller marker for Harriet Booth, the daughter of Edmund and Mary Ann Booth. Born on Feb. 22, 1846, Harried died on July 31, 1847 at the age of 14 months.\n\nHer father, Edmund (1810-1905), was a bit of a legend as a deaf pioneer and abolitionist. His Find a Grave memorial notes:\n\nBorn in 1810, Edmund Booth epitomized virtually everything that characterized an American legend of the 19th century. He taught school in Hartford, Conn., then went west to Anamosa, Iowa, where he built the area’s first frame house. He left in 1849 to travel the Overland Trail on his way to join the California Gold Rush. After he returned to Iowa in 1854, he became the owner and editor of the Anamosa EUREKA, the local newspaper. Edmund Booth fit perfectly the mold of the ingenious pioneer of 19th-century America, except for one unusual difference – he was deaf.\n\nEdmund is buried at Riverside Cemetery with his wife (and Harriet’s mother), Mary Ann Walworth Booth. Also deaf, Mary Ann was one of Edmund’s former pupils in Connecticut. I did not get a photo of either of there graves.\n\nTime to Go\n\nWe had one more stop to make before checking in at our Iowa City hotel that night. We had a Presidential grave to visit!\n\nLast week, I introduced you to the Anamosa State Penitentiary (ASP) Cemetery and shared some of the stories I uncovered while researching the graves. I hope you’re ready for a few more!\n\n“Until Sane”\n\nOne of the more bizarre stories I came across at the ASP Cemetery was about Truman J. Gilchrist. His last name was misspelled on his grave marker. Then I saw on his Find a grave memorial was that he had been committed to ASP for safekeeping “until sane”.\n\nIf that doesn’t make you want to dig deeper, I don’t know what would.\n\nBorn in 1865 in Iowa to Joseph Gilchrist and Sarah Bushyager Gilchrist, Truman grew up on a farm in Franklin County, Iowa. At age 34, he married Tena Albertena Howard in 1901. They settled in the Hampton area (about 130 miles from ASP) and had two children together.\n\nOn the morning of Oct. 28, 1904, Truman showed up at a neighboring farm belonging to the Bushyagers (possibly his mother-in-law’s family) nearly naked and told them he had killed Tena. They rushed to the Gilchrist home to find Tena laying dead in the bedroom, her two little ones alive and well nearby. She had been shot with a double-barreled shotgun.\n\nAt first, everyone was stunned. There had been no indication that Truman ever had a beef with his wife. He’d not appeared to be insane. Rumors swirled that Truman suspected in the weeks leading up to the murder that Tena was poisoning him (she was not). He’d supposedly sought help from a doctor. Truman was put in the county jail to await the court’s decision. In the meantime, one article said, the Gilchrist children were being adopted by the Fred Paullus family in Hampton.\n\nIn early February, a judge declared Truman insane and he was sent to ASP’s Insanity Unit where he was to stay until he “became sane”. If and when he did , he could be tried for the murder. Truman would remain at ASP for 45 years, never leaving the Insanity Unit. He died there on Aug. 30, 1950 at the age of 85.\n\nTena is buried in Union Cemetery in Lockridge Township, Iowa. She was 40 when she died. I don’t know what became of their children.\n\n“Recovered”\n\nIn the case of Elias Lyons, prison officials deemed him “recovered” from his insanity but he was back at ASP not long after his release.\n\nBorn in 1890, Elias Lyons was convicted of larceny in 1911 and sentenced to serve his time at Iowa State Penitentiary in Fort Madison (which closed in 2015). He was later sent to ASP to spend some time in the Insanity Unit. But in 1914, he was deemed “recovered” and sent back to Fort Madison along with 19 other prisoners. He was released from prison on Nov. 22, 1914.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 1914, Elias attempted to stop a car to rob its passengers by placing a rope across a bridge road in Burlington, Iowa.\n\nElias was sent back to ASP where he died on May 19, 1925. He was 34. I don’t know what his cause of death was.\n\n“Interior Decorator Before Prison”\n\nCharles DeForrest Ives only spent the last few months of his life at ASP. But he’d already spent the previous 15 years at another prison. However, from what I can tell, Charles hadn’t always led a life of crime.\n\nBorn in Elkhart, Ind. in 1901, Charles was the son of Joseph G. and Helen Van Doren Ives. Charles wed teacher Florence Lake in Des Moines, Iowa in 1923. They settled there and Charles worked various jobs over the next several years, from engineer to painter/wallpaper hanger. The couple had two sons together.\n\nUnfortunately, Charles slid into criminal activity. On Jan. 10, 1931, he attempted to rob a grocery store owned by George Cordaro. He had an accomplice, whose wife was thought to be the lookout. Later, Charles would confess to sheriff Charles Keeling that he and Cordaro had struggled over the gun and “In the scuffle, my gun went off.”\n\nCharles also is noted to have felt bad about what he’d done and said, “Tell them to get the clean sheets ready at Fort Madison,” referring to the Iowa State Penitentiary.\n\nCharles was in a truth-telling frame of mind and went on to confess to six street car robberies and two holdups. He claimed he had only done it because he needed the money. When he went to trial, he plead not guilty to the murder, but was convicted and sentenced to life in prison.\n\nHowever, many suspected there was more to it than that. The lookout, Lela Wiggins, was thought to be the reason Ives had held up the store. The two were thought to be lovers and some felt Ives confessed to protect her from serving time. Her husband, Hoyt, had assisted Ives in several robberies. He was convicted of a different robbery and sentenced to 10 years at Fort Madison. Lela divorced Hoyt while he was in prison.\n\nCharles’ Find a Grave memorial claims he served time at San Quentin in California but I found no record of that. He did his time at Fort Madison. I wonder if he ran into Hoyt Wiggins while he was there. Charles contracted tuberculosis and was transferred to ASP’s hospital unit. He died there on Dec. 20, 1945 at age 44.\n\nHis death certificate listed his profession as “interior decorator before prison”.\n\nCharles’ wife, Florence, divorced him and went on with her life. She continued to teach and moved with her sons to Clinton, Iowa. She died in 1985 in Durango, Colo. One of her sons became a doctor and moved to Louisiana.\n\nMisspent Youth\n\nI have more questions than answers concerning my final story. Arthur Fawcett was still a boy when he died, having gone down the wrong path.\n\nBorn in England in 1909, Arthur was the son of Thomas Lester Fawcett and Jennie Smith Fawcett. The Fawcetts emigrated to Canada in 1910 then to America in 1911. According to the 1920 U.S. Census, Thomas was working as a miner in Polk County north of Des Moines. Later, he worked laying linoleum.\n\nSadly, Thomas died on Feb. 25, 1927 from a brain abcess. He was 41. He is buried in Floyd Cemetery in Sioux City, Iowa.\n\nIt wasn’t long after that when Arthur’s name started appearing in the Sioux City Journal as the culprit in various car thefts/joy riding incidents. On Nov. 22, 1297 he got fined for a traffic violation. On Dec. 13, 2017, Arthur and a friend were arrested for the theft of seven cars (with which they went joy riding) and charged with larceny of a vehicle. As a result, they went to jail.\n\nArthur somehow got paroled a few months later. In February 1928, he was arrested again for having tried to sell tires off of a stolen car. Back to jail he went. In May 1928, his sentence was reduced by three months.\n\nI’m not exactly sure what happened after that, but Arthur died at ASP on March 20, 1930. He was only 20 at the time. His death certificate lists his cause of death as cirrhosis of the liver. That’s not something I’ve ever seen in a fellow that young.\n\nWe had a brief stop to make in Anamosa before we began out trek back west. Join me next time at Riverside Cemetery.\n\nSince cemeteries are viewed by many as outdoor museums, it isn’t a stretch for me to say that I’m a bit of a museum junkie. It doesn’t take much to get me to visit one, the more obscure the topic the better. I love learning about anything and everything!\n\nWhen I was doing research for this road trip, I discovered that Iowa’s Anamosa State Penitentiary (ASP) not only had a museum, it had a cemetery that’s open to the public. There was no way I was going to miss out on that!\n\nSo we headed east from Springville to Anamosa, a brief 10 mile ride. I was also interested in visiting Anamosa to visit the cemetery where artist Grant Wood was buried. I talked about him during my visited to Cedar Rapids’ Oak Hill Cemetery. Wood spent his last years in the Anamosa area. I’ll be writing about that in a few weeks.\n\nApproved in 1872\n\nFirst approved in 1872 by the Iowa Legislature because the prison in Fort Madison was full, the Anamosa State Penitentiary was first known as the Additional Penitentiary, then the Anamosa Penitentiary before it was a Reformatory. Then it became a Penitentiary once again. Inmates did much of the labor on the stone walls and buildings, some of them dying in the process.\n\nASP’s walls, which are about 12 feet thick at the base and four feet thick at the top, enclose about 12 acres. It had a Female Department and an Insane Unit for decades.\n\nOne of Anamosa’s most infamous prisoners was 11-year-old Wesley Elkins, convicted of killing two people. Sentenced to life, Elkins ended up only serving a nine-year sentence. You might also remember Frank Novak, who I wrote about a few weeks ago. He tried to fake his own death for the insurance money, committed murder, and fled Cedar Rapids to Alaska. He was eventually caught and spent some years at Anamosa.\n\nASP’s most infamous inmate was serial killer John Wayne Gacy, who served time there for 18 months on a sodomy charge. He was released in 1970 and returned to the Chicago area where he began to commit his many murders.\n\nAs of March 2021, there were about 945 inmates serving time at ASP. That same year, corrections officer Robert McFarland and nurse Lorena Schulte were murdered by prisoners during a botched escape attempt. Inmates have been killed during escape attempts at ASP before, but 2021’s incident was the first time staff members working at the prison were killed by prisoners.\n\nPrison Museum & Gift Shop\n\nIt may seem hard to believe that a working prison might have a museum and a gift shop, but Anamosa does. It’s housed in the building that used to be a cheese factory. The penitentiary once produced large amounts of food for prison consumption, from beef and milk to fresh vegetables.\n\nThe museum has a recreation of a typical historic cell (it’s understandably small) and records of past inmates, photos of construction, and examples of prison products. Prison sports teams, stories of famous inmates, and the evolution of correctional policies and prison administrators are all included. I was quite impressed at the amount of information and the number of artifacts they had.\n\nOne thing I learned while I was there was that during his stay, John Wayne Gacy was a model prisoner. He worked in the bakery and helped build a miniature golf course that is still in use today. I looked for a picture of it at the museum but never saw one.\n\nWe spent a good amount of time talking to the museum staff, who told us that many of their family members currently worked at ASP or had worked there in the past. While not exactly a pleasant place to work, ASP continues to provide jobs for many in the community.\n\nI want to note that I don’t know if this museum is still open. Apparently, it closed during Covid and I don’t know if it ever reopened. If that’s true, I’m glad we had the opportunity to see it.\n\nAlso Called Boot Hill Cemetery\n\nLocated about a mile and a half from the prison is the ASP Cemetery, also known as the Iowa Men’s Reformatory Cemetery and Boot Hill Cemetery.\n\nI was a bit surprised that ASP’s cemetery is open to the public like it is. Most prison cemeteries, even the ones as old as ASP, are close to the facility and off limits. But I’m certainly glad we were able to see it.\n\nThe first cemetery associated with ASP was established in 1876 at Prison Farm No. 1 or possibly at Farm No. 5. Its exact location is unknown. The graves are of those prisoners whose bodies were left unclaimed or were not taken to one of the state’s medical colleges. They were buried in common graves that contained up to eight bodies. Tall limestone markers were placed at each grave and contained the prisoner’s name and death date.\n\nThey were moved here when the current cemetery was established in 1914. Subsequent graves hold individual bodies, and are marked with shorter limestone markers with the prisoner’s name, age, date of death, and sometimes their prison number. According to Find a Grave, the most recent burial took place in 2021. So it is still an active burial ground. Most of the time, prisoners who die at ASP are now claimed by family members and taken elsewhere for burial.\n\nThey are in three different styles. Two styles are upright stones, one with a triangular top and the other with a rounded top. They were used from 1914 to the 1940s. The third style of stone is a flat, horizontal marker that was used from the 1940s to the present.\n\nFind a Grave lists about 180 graves here. There don’t look to be that many markers. Then I realized that some of the larger stones had multiple names on them, like this one.\n\nOne of the earliest burials listed on the above marker is for George Williams, who died on Dec. 11, 1873. That was when construction began at ASP.\n\nListed right below Williams’ name is that of Noah Banks. Born in 1828 in Arkansas, Banks was convicted of more than one bank robbery in 1874 and was sent to ASP for five years. The Waterloo Courier reported that:\n\nUpon receiving his sentence he [Banks] swore the direst vengeance on all who had been instrumental, in any way, in securing that result, and more especially did he call down curses upon the devoted heads of our citizens, who may now draw a long breath of relief, resting secure.\n\nBanks escaped prison twice before he died. Once in Independence, Mo. and another at ASP. But he was captured both times. Banks died at ASP of kidney disease on June 18, 1876 at age 47.\n\nDying the same day was African-American prisoner Edwin Smith, who died of tuberculosis at age 26. He was serving a two-year term for larceny.\n\nASP Escape Attempts\n\nOn July 14, 1881, 11 prisoners on their way to the dining hall made an attempt to escape. Charles Thomas, 23, was shot by a guard and brought back inside. A few others were also caught while four managed to get away. I don’t know if they were ever caught but rewards were offered for their capture/return.\n\nThomas had been at ASP for about a year, sentenced to a six-year term for larceny and robbery.\n\nCharles died from his wound about a month later on Aug. 21, 1881. The article I found below gives us a glimpse into what a prison funeral might have been like. Warning, it’s a little medically graphic in detail.\n\nTwo more inmates died as a result of another attempted prison escape on Aug. 10, 1886. Patrick “Paddy” Ryan (30) and Albert Mitchell (27) were both shot. One died instantly and the other the next day.\n\nDeath of a Tramp\n\nSome of those resting at the ASP Cemetery were housed in what was termed the Insane Unit. John Reed was one of them.\n\nI could find out little about him. In the articles I read, Reed is described as a tramp who suffered from alcoholism. He would not disclose who his parents were, he said, because they were poor and he didn’t want to bring shame to them.\n\nBorn in 1882, he was convicted of murdering a bridge tender in 1910. What happened to bring that about and how he died in 1912 are in the article below.\n\nIt’s doubtful John’s parents knew whatever became of him. He was about 30 when he died.\n\nA Terrible End\n\nThen there are those stories that just leave you shaking your head, such as the one for Cain Russell.\n\nCain Russell was a farmer in Birmingham, Iowa, married to Etta Jane Marriott Russell. Together, they had several children over the years.\n\nOn the morning of Aug. 1, 1917, Cain shot and killed his wife with a shotgun blast to the back of her head.\n\nAccording to bits and pieces I’ve read, 18 months before this, Cain had come before an “insanity board” to determine his soundness of mind but had escaped being sent to an asylum. He was described as increasingly short-tempered and irritable. One account of the murder read as follows:\n\nThe morning of the tragedy the mother had nursed her 11-months old baby boy and laid him on the bed asleep. As she went to the kitchen she noticed her husband prowling around in a closet and asked him what he wanted, and he replied nothing, but was evidently getting his gun. She then went to the garden for a pan of beans for dinner, brought them to the kitchen and placed them on the table.\n\nIt is supposed she was going out of doors again, as the husband came behind and shot her at close range with the one-barreled shotgun, the full load striking her behind the left ear, making a frightful wound, but did not disfigure her face. She dropped to the floor and was partly in a reclining position in the kitchen, her head resting on a chair. The husband apparently realized what he had done and was filled with remorse, as he had tried to kiss her after the deed, and his face and hands were covered with blood.\n\nCain was sent to ASP and placed in the Insane Unit. He died there on March 27, 1930 at age 58. His brother, Samuel Russell, supposedly died at the asylum in Mount Pleasant, Iowa in 1911.\n\nCain’s Find a Grave memorial notes that he suffered from Huntington’s Disease., a genetic disorder with no cure. I’m doubtful anyone knew much about it at that time. Cain’s deterioration over the years leading up to the murder sound similar in some ways to what Huntington’s Disease sufferers go through.\n\nWhile some of the Russell children were grown and married, several were quite young and one was an infant. They went to live with their siblings or other relatives. Etta is buried at Iowa’s Van Buren Cemetery. She was 43 at the time of her death.\n\nCain and Etta’s youngest daughter, Leoma, had Huntington’s Disease. Born in 1914, she was only three years old when her mother died. She married Llewellyn Mallinger in 1932 and the couple had three children. Her death certificate states that when she died of pneumonia on March 24, 1959, she was living at the mental health institute in Mt. Pleasant, Iowa. It also noted she had suffered from Huntington’s Disease for 12 to 15 years. She was 45 when she died. She is buried at Highland Cemetery in Richland, Iowa.\n\nI’ll have more stories from Anamosa State Penitentiary Cemetery next week.\n\nLast week, I shared a number of white bronze (zinc) monuments at Springville Cemetery in Linn County, Iowa. Today I’m going to share some additional monuments that got my attention (made of other materials).\n\nIn reviewing my photos, I came across one that caught my eye because it has a Georgia connection. A native of Iowa, Isaac E. Robinson was only 21 when he died far from home in Rome, Ga. during the Civil War.\n\nAn estimated 76,242 Iowa men (out of a total population of 674,913 in 1860) served in the military during the Civil War, many in combat units attached to the Western armies. About 13,000 died of wounds or disease (two-thirds of whom were of the latter).\n\nFar From Home\n\nIsaac was born in Iowa around 1843 to George H. Robinson and Sarah Butler Robinson. His father died in 1847 and his mother remarried to Samuel Starry around 1850.\n\nIsaac was living in Onion Grove, Iowa (now called Clarence), which is about 33 miles east of Springville. He enlisted in the Union Army on Aug. 30,1861 and was assigned to the Ninth Iowa Infantry, Company B. Issac was 18 at the time.\n\nAccording to his military records, Isaac’s service included battles of Pea Ridge, Ark. (March 1862), Chickasaw Bayou (December 1862), Fort Hindman (January 1863), assault and siege of Vicksburg (May – Apr 1863), siege of Jackson, Miss. (July 1863), Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, Ringgold Gap (November 1863), and Resaca and Dallas, Ga. (May-June 1864).\n\nIsaac received a severe wound in his thigh on May 27, 1864 in Dallas, Ga. He died on Aug. 28, 1864 in Rome, Ga, most likely of sepsis. His remains were eventually sent back to Iowa for burial in Springville Cemetery. I don’t think he was married. Unfortunately, his inscription is very worn and faded.\n\nIsaac is buried beside his father, George, and his mother, Sarah, who died in 1872. She shares a marker with her second husband, Samuel, who died in 1880.\n\nRock of Ages\n\nIt’s hard to not be drawn to the Jordan monument with its combination of stone and mosaic tile. I’m always curious by how these were made and who made them.\n\nLemuel Dyer Jordan and his wife, Nancy, came to Iowa sometime in the 1840s from Maine. Their eldest son, George, was born in 1846. He worked as a stock buyer (cattle) and married Emily Alice Gilliland around 1865. The couple had several children.\n\nGeorge died in Springville on March 24, 1921 at age 75. Emily died on Dec. 16, 1926 at age 77 but she does not have a marker.\n\nGeorge and Emily’s youngest son, Frank, was born in 1886. He, too, was a stock buyer. He married twice and served in World War I as a private. In later years, he operated a drug store in Springville. He spent the last three years of his life at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Knoxville, Tenn. where he died on Jan. 27, 1947.\n\nDanish Blacksmith\n\nProbably the most unique grave marker at Springville Cemetery is this one for Danish immigrant Christian “Chris” Nielsen. In 1887, he married Inger Marie Nielsen (not related). They emigrated to Iowa from Denmark around 1890. Together, they had three daughters. One of them, Tevvedora, died in infancy but the other two lived long lives.\n\nAs you can see, Chris was employed as a blacksmith. The anvil and hammer make that apparent. I have no idea who made it for him, but it’s very cleverly done.\n\nChris died on Thursday, Oct. 15, 1936 after a long illness. He was 78. Marie died in 1945. She has her own marker and a shared one with Chris and Tevvedora.\n\nFort Dearborn Massacre Survivor\n\nWhen I photographed Susan Millhouse Simmons’ grave, I knew nothing about her. Frankly, I was stunned when I began reading what happened to her before she ever arrived in Iowa.\n\nBorn in 1777 in Pennsylvania, Susan married John Simmons in Ohio in 1808. In 1810, John enlisted in the First United States Infantry and was assigned for duty to Fort Dearborn in Illinois. He was soon made a non-commissioned officer. The couple’s son, David, was born that same year. A daughter, also named Susan, was born Feb. 12, 1812 at Fort Dearborn.\n\nFort Dearborn was located on the south bank of the main stem of the Chicago River in what is now the Loop community area of downtown Chicago. At the time, the area was basically wilderness.\n\nOn Aug. 15, 1812, soldiers and settlers evacuating Fort Dearborn were massacred by Pottawatomie Indians in a surprise attack, killing 53 soldiers, women, and children. Among them were John Simmons and his little son, David. John died defending the wagon his wife and children were in. He was buried much later in a mass grave on the battle site.\n\nSurvivors were taken prisoner by the Pottawatomie and were held captive as long as two years before making their way to freedom. Susan and her daughter were taken to Green Bay, Wisc. On the march, she walked and carried her baby, the entire distance being over two hundred miles. She was a captive for eight months. One narrative I read stated that many times, she was told to hand over little Susan to them but she adamantly refused.\n\nIn fall 1812, the Pottawatomie, with their prisoners, left Green Bay, and marched to the ruins of Fort Dearborn, then around the end of Lake Michigan and up to Mackinas, to Fort Meigs. In April 1813, negotiations for the prisoners were opened. Susan and little Susan were set free and returned to Ohio.\n\nSusan married widower John Redenbaugh in 1820. Daughter Susan married Moses Winans in 1828. They had nine children. John Redenbaugh died in 1847. When Moses and Susan Winans moved with their family to Springville, Iowa in 1853, her mother went with them.\n\nSusan Millhouse Simmons Redenbaugh died in Springville on Feb. 27, 1857 at age 79.\n\nMoses Winans died on Aug. 24, 1871 at age 63. Susan Winans moved to California with some of her adult children after 1885. She died in Santa Ana, Calif. at age 88 on April 27, 1900. She is buried in Santa Ana Cemetery along with her adult children Lewis, William, and Amy. Some of her other adult children (Hiram, John, Esther, David) who remained in Iowa are buried in Springville Cemetery with their father.\n\nOur next stop was Anamosa, Iowa, where we visited the Anamosa State Penitentiary museum and the prisoner cemetery located nearby. You won’t want to miss that!\n\nAfter leaving Cedar Rapids, we headed northeast 30 miles to Springville Cemetery. Springville Cemetery has an estimated 2,350 memorials on Find a Grave. Adjoining St. Isidore Cemetery seems to have between 50 to 100 graves.\n\nSpringville’s earliest graves date from the 1840s, before Iowa became the 29th state in 1846. But one of the reasons I put Springville on our itinerary was to see for myself one of the largest white bronze (zinc) monuments I’d ever come across online. It has quite a story of the family it represents and how it was brought back to its former glory after our visit.\n\nThe Brown Family\n\nThe Brown monument was erected in 1886 to honor Revolutionary War veteran Nathan Brown (1761-1842) and his family. It was commissioned by Brown’s son, Horace Nathan Brown (1822-1893). The base was made of granite but the majority of the monument is white bronze (zinc). In many articles I read, it was incorrectly reported that it was made of granite and marble.\n\nOne of the panels lists a lengthy history of Nathan Brown that I’ve included here:\n\nNathan Brown was born at White Plains, N.Y., July 22, 1761. At the age of 14, he began to drill in preparation to joining the American Army, and at 16 he entered the service in the Revolutionary War. His first battle was at Harlem Flats and his second one on the present site of Greenwood Cemetery. He was wounded but not seriously in some of the many battles in which he participated.\n\nSeven brothers served in the same army and his captain was an uncle. After the war he removed to South Hallow and afterwards to Buffalo, N.Y., where he remained a short time and then removed to Pennsylvania. April 1, 1838, removed to Geneva, Kane County, Ill. Afterwards settled one mile southwest of Springville, Ia. May 17, 1839. Died Nov. 25, 1842.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, Nathan married his first wife, Sarah Bailey, in in 1781. Their son, John, stayed behind when Nathan moved to Onondaga County, N.Y. After Sarah died, he married second wife Tamar Sammons in 1807. They had four daughters, Maria, Betsey, Amanda, and Harriet. The family moved to Erie County, Pa. It was there that their son, Horace, was born in 1822.\n\nThe Browns continued their journey west in 1838, settling in Kane County, Ill., where Nathan’s married daughters, Maria and Betsey remained, before the rest of the family moved to Linn County in Iowa Territory. Nathan died in 1842.\n\nNathan Brown was buried in Paralta Cemetery before Horace moved his father´s grave to Springville, probably when his mother Tamar died in 1868.\n\nHorace expanded the 1839 Brown farm to more than 600 acres. He wed Julia Chapman in 1853. He served the county as its third treasurer and held several offices in the township, including justice of the peace.\n\nAfter Horace died from tuberculosis at age 71 in 1893, Julia continued running the Brown farm until her death in 1904. She was 80. The plot now holds Nathan, Tamar, Horace, and Julia Brown.\n\nHistory of a Monument\n\nWhen I started researching the Brown monument, I got some surprises. All I really knew when I saw it in 2019 was that it was in desperate need of repair and that the local chapters of the Daughters of the American Revolution and Sons of the American Revolution were raising funds to do so. They had reached a little over half their goal of $40,000 then.\n\nWhen Horace Brown contacted Cedar Rapids’ Krebs Bros. in 1886 to obtain the monument, the dealer was well known for its white bronze monuments. I’ve written about these before but Iowa has more than most. That’s because the Western White Bronze factory was located in Des Moines and produced many of them.\n\nIn looking for newspaper clippings for Krebs Bros., I was stunned to find one of their ads that included a drawing of the Bever monument at Oak Hill Cemetery in Cedar Rapids that I featured a few weeks ago. I learned that the 24 ft. tall Bever monument cost $5,000. In contrast, the 16 ft. tall Brown monument cost about $1,000 when it was erected.\n\nThe plates featuring bas relief busts of Horace and Julia Brown’s faces and birth/death dates were likely added after Julia died in 1904. I’ve only seen one other monument with a portrait on it and that was in New Orleans, La.\n\nA storm in 1977 damaged the monument when a structure blew across the road into the cemetery and broke the spire into several pieces. Three local men worked to repair it and realized it wasn’t made of stone but metal. They poured a concrete base and bolted the metal together.\n\nThe monument was restored beginning in August 2020 after a several-year fundraising campaign by area Daughters of the American Revolution groups (the Mayflower Chapter, the Ashley Chapter, and the Marion Linn Chapter) and local donations. Memorials by Michel in Solon, Iowa completed the restoration work, which included replacing the fractured base.\n\nThe Brown monument was rededicated at a ceremony May 22, 2021. While it is shorter now because of the new base, I think it looks wonderful. This photo is a screenshot from a video I found on YouTube.\n\nThe Pherrin Family\n\nSince we’re already on the white bronze track, let’s keep going. Springville Cemetery has several great examples. But one of them puzzled me at first.\n\nThe Pherrin monument has eight names on it. That’s a long list but not strange. What’s different is that all the dates are birth dates with no death dates.\n\nThe Pherrin family was headed by William Harrison Pherrin (born in Erie, Pa. in 1842) and his wife, Sarah Green Pherrin (born in 1847). William’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Iowa sometime in the 1850s. He served in the 24th Iowa Infantry, Co. H., during the Civil War. He wed Sarah in 1867 and they started a family with the birth of John Bruce Perrin in 1868.\n\nMore children would follow with the births of Luella (1870), Nancy “Nannie” (1872), Charles (1876), Edward (1884) and Archie (1896). All of them, except for Archie, would live well into adulthood.\n\nYou might be asking yourself why it was done this way. I have some theories.\n\nThe first Pherrin family member to die, sadly, was little Archie. Born on July 3, 1889, he died on Feb. 11 1896 at the age of 6. Death records indicate he died from “inflammation of the bowels”. He is also the only Pherrin family member to have an individual white bronze marker.\n\nThe Western White Bronze Co. in Des Moines was in full operation from 1886 to 1908. The government took over the plant in 1914 for manufacturing munitions during World War I. After the war, demand for the monuments faded. However, they continued to make individual panels for family members who died after the monuments were ordered. The company turned to making castings for automobiles and radios until it closed in 1939.\n\nI think when Archie died in 1896, someone in the family consulted with a monument company (probably Krebs. Bros.) who advised them on creating a monument not just for Archie but for the entire family. They would only put the birth dates to save space, adding individual markers later as family members died. What they didn’t know at the time was that Western White Bronze would end up closing.\n\nYou’ll notice that one of the panels features a war medallion on a ribbon, a symbol of William’s Civil War service. Also, you can see the interlocking initials “WHP”.\n\nThere wasn’t another death in the Pherrin family until Nancy “Nannie” Pherrin Smith died in 1917 at age 45. William H. Pherrin died in 1924 at age 81 and Sarah Pherrin died in 1938. John died in 1937, he has an individual stone marker. Eva Luella died in 1943, Charles died in 1946, and Robert died in 1975.\n\nNow a good question to ask is are all of the Perrin children actually buried at Springville? The answer is no.\n\nI can safely say that John, Luella, and Archie are really there. Robert is definitely not because I found his Find a Grave memorial at Woodlawn Memorial Park in Gotha, Fla. He moved to Florida 49 years before his death. I suspect Charles is buried in the Seattle, Wash. area because he died there in 1946. I could not find an obituary for him. Nor could I find an obituary for Nannie, who had married Charles Wesley Smith and moved to North Dakota. Like Robert and Charles, it’s possible she is buried there as well.\n\nThe Chapman Siblings\n\nI always think it’s special when I find a brother/sister pair of markers. That’s the case for Daniel T. Chapman and Ellen Chapman. You might remember that last name. Horace Brown’s wife was their sister, Julia Chapman Brown.\n\nDaniel, born in 1818, was the son of Lemuel Chapman and Betsy Smouse. He died on Jan. 9, 1846 at age 27. I don’t know what his cause of death was. Ellen was the daughter of Lemuel and his second wife, Ruth Hardinger. She was born in 1837. So she was only nine when Daniel died. She never married. She lived with her mother, Ruth, in Indiana.\n\nI learned that when Ruth died in 1872, Ellen moved to Springville and moved in with her half-sister Julia and her husband, Horace. She remained there until her death at age 64 on April 13, 1903.\n\nIt’s my guess that Julia, having already perhaps been involved in the ordering of the Brown monument years before, ordered these two markers to honor her siblings. It’s the exact same style as the individual ones that she and Horace have.\n\n“Earth Has No Sorrows That Heaven Cannot Heal”\n\nFinally, I want to include this marker for Myrtle May Dennis McAtee. Born in 1882 to James Dennis and Axie Hahn Dennis, May was one of several children. She married Dwight Asa McAtee on Feb. 9, 1902 in Springville. They had a daughter named Ruby on April 4, 1903.\n\nBut their happiness was short lived. May died on Feb. 37, 1904 at age 21 of consumption, today known as tuberculosis. Ruby was not even a year old at the time.\n\nDwight remarried to Edythe Gertrude Carr in 1926. Ruby grew up and became a teacher, marrying Fordis Clifton in 1935. She died in 1962 of ovarian cancer. Dwight died in 1951 at age 73. The marker he shares with Edythe, who died in 1950, is beside May’s white bronze marker.\n\nI’ll be back with more stories from Springville Cemetery next time.\n\nHappy New Year! Let’s start 2024 right by getting a last look around Cedar Rapids, Iowa’s Oak Hill Cemetery. There are a few stories left to tell at this venerable burial ground.\n\nCedar Rapids’ First Doctor\n\nOne family plot that got my attention was this one for the Mansfields. The surname monument and individual markers were of an unusual design I hadn’t seen before. I was curious to know more about them.\n\nThe head of the family was Dr. Eber Lewis Mansifled, originally of Athens, Ohio. Born in 1821, Eber’s education was of a hit or miss nature. I’ve found this to be the case for many doctors back in the day who came from hardscrabble backgrounds. He got his medical education when and where he could find it, learning from other physicians, and finishing up at Western Reserve Medical College in Cleveland, Ohio.\n\nDr. Mansfield arrived in Cedar Rapids around 1847, becoming the town’s first physician. He left temporarily in 1850 to travel to California during the Gold Rush, combining medicine and mining. But he returned in 1851 to settle permanently in Cedar Rapids.\n\nAt 26, Dr. Mansfield wed Indiana native Lucy Ann Warriner in 1852. They had several children over the next years. Daughters Lizzie (born in 1854) and Irene (born in 1859) would die in infancy. But Sylvia (born in 1853), Lura (born in 1857) and Lewis (born in 1861) lived long lives.\n\nThe family prospered and Dr. Mansfield’s practice flourished. They owned this fine home (see illustration below).\n\nLucy died on Aug. 26, 1868 at age 42 after a long illness, according to her death notice. She was buried at OHC with her infant daughters.\n\nDr. Mansfield remarried to Mary Elizabeth Warriner in 1870. She was Lucy’s second cousin.\n\nDied in His Buggy\n\nWhen Dr. Mansfield died on May 26, 1877, his manner of death was reported on because of how it transpired. He was on his way to visit his farm out of town, according to the Cedar Rapids Gazette article:\n\nHe left the city this morning to go to his farm, which is 19 miles from this city and three miles from Urbana, a short distance from the Benton county line. It had been his custom to visit his farm once every week or two. When at Hunter’s corner his horse stopped in the road and remained there several minutes, the doctor sitting upright with the lines in his hands without moving.\n\nMr. Hunter and his daughter were sitting on their porch and saw the doctor’s horse stop. As he made no movement, one of them went down to the buggy to see what might be wrong, if anything, and found him dead. There was no sign of life whatever except that as when they first approached him they noticed a slight groan. He was holding the lines in his hands and appeared as if he were alive and sitting upright. His face had not changed color and his head was slightly inclined forward.\n\nThe same article reported that, “He had recently had an attack of neuralgia of the stomach, but had fully recovered from that. He had frequently told a physician here that he expected to died from apoplexy.” Today, apoplexy would mostly likely be considered some kind of stroke.\n\nDr. Mansfield was buried at OHC with Lucy and his infant daughters.\n\nWife Mary died of pleurisy at age 58 on Feb. 3, 1889. While her Find a Grave memorial says she is buried at OHC, the cemetery online records do not have record of her being buried there. According to Iowa death records, she was placed in the Oak Hill vault. The articles I found about her death reported her funeral but none mention where exactly she was buried. There is no marker for her in the plot as far as I could tell. So I cannot say for sure exactly where Mary ended up!\n\nThe only other Mansfield child in the plot, besides Irene and Lizzie, was son Lewis and his wife, Margaret. Lewis died in 1933 at age 71. Daughter Sylvia, who married Charles Deacon, is buried with him in another area of OHC. Daughter Lura, who married twice, is buried with her second husband in Elmwood Cemetery in Kansas City, Mo.\n\nMayor of Cedar Rapids\n\nThe reason I photographed the Carmody plot is also because I thought it looked different. John T. Carmody’s signature is on the surname monument, which is held up by what appear to be lion’s feet.\n\nThat might tell you a bit about the character of John T. Carmody.\n\nBorn in 1859, Irishman John T. Carmody left Lima, Ohio and arrived in Cedar Rapids around 1885. He started working for Whiting Bros. foundry as a foreman and became the sole owner of the factory in 1889, renaming it J.T. Carmody Foundry & Machine Co. In 30 years, the company would become Iowa Steel & Iron Works.\n\nJohn wed local Irish girl Mary Buckingham in 1887. They had no children.\n\nThe main building of Carmody’s company caught fire on April 22, 1902, totally destroying it. Despite the setback, Carmody was determined to start over and his new building, with all new equipment, was completed in 1904.\n\nCarmody’s success led to his election as Cedar Rapids mayor on March 30, 1908. Unfortunately, his tenure as mayor would not last long.\n\nDeath of a Lion Heart\n\nOn May 23, Mary Carmody was awakened by the sound of a burglar in the bedroom. She called out to her husband, and the intruder struck her in the neck. She called out again and Carmody awoke. He sprang up and wrestled the intruder into the hallway. When the intruder managed to get free on the stairs, he turned, firing two shots, one of which hit Carmody.\n\nPolice ran to the Carmody home, where they found Carmody shot in the stomach. Carmody was taken to St. Luke’s Hospital. Although his doctor expected him to recover, Carmody never left the hospital. He contracted typhoid fever and died Aug. 7, 1909. He was 49.\n\nOn Dec. 24, Arthur Johnson, alias J.A. Harris, a career criminal from Chillicothe, Mo., was given a life sentence for the murder of John Carmody.\n\nCarmody’s death weighed greatly on his wife, Mary. She continued to live with her mother, Ellen. She died four years later on Aug. 13, 1913. She was only 37. Ellen Buckingham died on Jan. 22, 1920. John, Mary, and Ellen are buried together at OHC.\n\nMedal of Honor Recipient\n\nI’d like to end my visit to Oak Hill Cemetery with the story of another lion-hearted fellow buried there.\n\nBorn in Sangerville, Maine on Jan. 26, 1841, Charles Amory Clark enlisted with the 6th Maine Infantry in July 1861, and was commissioned as a lieutenant in February 1862. He later served as captain and assistant adjutant general of volunteers from May to October 1864.\n\nThree of Charles’ brothers (see photo above) also served in the Civil War. While Whiting Steven Clark and Frank A. Clark (not pictured) would survive, their brother James William Clark died on July 31, 1864 from wounds he suffered at Petersburg, Va.\n\nLt. Col. Clark received the Medal of Honor for his actions at Brooks Ford, Va. on May 4, 1863 during the Battle of Salem Church in the Chancellorsville Campaign. He was honored with the award on May 13, 1896:\n\nHaving voluntarily taken command of his regiment in the absence of its commander, at great personal risk and with remarkable presence of mind and fertility of resource led the command down an exceedingly precipitous embankment to the Rappahannock River and by his gallantry, coolness, and good judgment in the face of the enemy saved the command from capture or destruction.\n\nAfter the war, Clark worked as a lawyer in Cedar Rapids. He was active in the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR), and was elected its national judge advocate general in 1905 and the department commander of Iowa in 1906. He was also a companion of the Iowa Commandery of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. He was named a regent of the University of Iowa in 1907.\n\nIf you’re interested in Clark’s friendship with fellow soldier Solomon Russell, read this.\n\nClark died at age 72 on Dec. 22, 1913. He is buried with his wife, Helen Brockway Clark, who died in 1929.\n\nIt wasn’t easy to leave Oak Hill Cemetery. But now it was time to head east for Springville Cemetery.\n\nThis week, I’m going to spend some time sharing the lovely white bronze (zinc) monuments at Oak Hill Cemetery.\n\nOne of the reasons I always looked forward to our trips to Iowa was that I knew we’d encounter at least a few white bronze monuments/markers. Since the Western White Bronze Company had a factory in Des Moines, there are tons of their markers scattered throughout the state. I don’t see them that often here in the South.\n\nAt OHC, white bronze monuments come in all shapes and sizes. But the largest one I could find was for the Bever family. There is one large monument for to represent all the Bevers, with individual markers for family members made of stone and white bronze. Find a Grave shows there are 23 Bever memorials listed at OHC.\n\nThe Bever Family\n\nIf you’re driving around Cedar Rapids, you can still find the name “Bever” on a handful of streets. There’s a Bever Woods historic district and a Bever Park. At one time in the early 1900s, there was even a Bever Park Zoo.\n\nBorn in 1808 in Ohio, Sampson Cicero Bever was already a wealthy man when he and his wife, Mary, moved with their family to Cedar Rapids in 1852. He opened the city’s first bank and was involved in bringing the first railroad to Cedar Rapids.\n\nAt some point, Sampson had the remains of his parents John Bever and Euphemia “Effie” Imbrie Bever Flack moved from Ohio to Cedar Rapids. John Bever died young at 32 in 1811. Effie remarried to Frances Flack in 1815 and died in 1869.\n\nSampson and Mary had a large family over the years. At least, Mary and Mirtilla, died in their teens in 1860. Their mother, Mary, died in 1885 at age 72. Five of her adult children were still living at the time.\n\nWhen Sampson died in 1892 at age 84, the local newspaper published a lengthy obituary about him that included this tribute:\n\nMr. Bever was a man of exceptional if not extraordinary business sagacity and acumen. His judgment seemed to be unerring and every business enterprise that enlisted his personal co-operation, attention and encouragement succeeded. In this long career of continuous commercial and financial success he acquired vast wealth and was rated as a millionaire. He was intimately known by all the old settlers of central and eastern Iowa, many of whom have had business transactions with him for the past forty years. Financially he was one of the most important and potential factors in the city.\n\nBever Park was established in 1893 on wooded land owned by the Bever family to honor Sampson Bever.\n\n“Whisky Killed Him”\n\nHenry Bever was one of Sampson and Mary’s sons. I did not photograph all of the Bever markers but I did get a photo of his. It is made of stone, not white bronze.\n\nBorn in 1846, Henry lived at home with his parents until he served in the 46th Iowa Volunteer Infantry, Co. E, during the Civil War. He came home and worked as a dry good merchant for a time, then as a coal dealer, and later in his father’s bank.\n\nHenry died at the age of 36 on Christmas Day 1882, which must have been quite a blow to the family. I found a few brief death notices but this one from the Dec. 29, 1882 Muscatine (Iowa) Weekly Journal got my attention.\n\nThis kind of thing always gets to me because frankly, it wasn’t necessary. No other funeral notice about Henry Bever said anything about whiskey. Even he did have a problem with alcohol, printing it in the newspaper did nothing but bring his family pain. Part of me wonders if someone at the Muscatine Weekly Journal had a beef with the Bever family to include it.\n\nWhen a Husband Dies\n\nI was only partially successful at solving the mystery behind the Downing white bronze marker. But it’s rather typical of the kind of thing that may happen when a women loses her husband at a fairly young age.\n\nBorn in Ireland around 1831, Margaret Cooper married Robert Downing in 1854. I don’t know if they wed in America or in Ireland. They had at least four children together.\n\nBy 1870, Robert was out of the picture. There is no record of his burial at OHC. Margaret and the children (Anna, Caroline, Addah, and Emma) were living in Grinnell, Iowa. That’s about 80 miles west of Cedar Rapids.\n\nOn June 18, 1873, Anna died at age 18. I don’t know her cause of death. On June 1, 1878, Addah died at age 16. Again, I don’t know the cause of death. They were both buried at OHC.\n\nAccording to the 1885 Iowa Census, Margaret and youngest daughter Emma were still living in Grinnell. Daughter Carrie had married a Mr. Smyth and moved to Tacoma, Wash. Margaret and Emma would move there sometime before 1892. Emma would marry a Mr. Merritt. Eventually, Margaret moved in with Carrie and her family.\n\nMargaret died on March 30, 1909 in Tacoma. Her body was taken back to Cedar Rapids for burial with Anna and Addah at OHC. I am wondering if the monument for all three of them was made when she died because white bronze markers were not being made in Des Moines until 1886. The factory closed around 1908 so it was likely one of the last ones made.\n\nDied from a Cut on His Knee\n\nI couldn’t find out a great deal about the Stein family but what I did discover made me sad.\n\nGerman immigrant John Stein married Irish native Sarah Jane Johnson at some point before settling in Pennsylvania. The couple would have eight children together, eventually moving to Cedar Rapids.\n\nBorn in 1861, William Robert Stein was their fourth child. He died on March 15, 1885 at age 23. I was curious to know how he died so young and found the following obituary (below). A cut evidently turned septic and it caused his death. Something that could have been easily treated today with antibiotics, mostly likely.\n\nHe was buried at OHC with a large white bronze monument.\n\nSarah Jane, his mother, died on Dec. 5, 1905 at age 78. Her death certificate notes that she died from “a broken leg and shock”. Her obituary had no further details. William’s father, John, died four years later on May 27, 1909 at age 82. Sarah Jane and John are buried in the plot with William but don’t have markers.\n\nMystery of the Mills\n\nThe white bronze marker for Marie Mills Dickerson, Bessie Mills, and Jimmie Mills left me with more questions than answers.\n\nJames “Jimmie” Mills, born sometime in March 1887, and Bessie Mills, born in 1888, were the children of Robert D. Mills and Cornelia “Cora” Dickinson (or Dickerson). Finding information on them was tricky because Cora’s last name was spelled different ways. But I did learn the two were married in Cedar Rapids in 1883.\n\nJimmie died on Jan. 4, 1890 and Bessie died on Jan. 12. 1890, both from “diphtheritic croup” or rather, diphtheria.\n\nOn the other side of the marker is a plate for Marie Mills Dickerson, wife of G.A. Dickerson. Born in 1842, Marie died of “anasarca dropsy” which is another term for edema. According to burial records, she had suffered from it for 8 years. Interesting to note is that her marker says she died on April 5, 1890 but death records indicate it was actually April 5, 1889. She was 47.\n\nI could only find one mention of a G.A. Dickerson in the newspapers and it was that he had a watch repair business in Cedar Rapids. That was it. I have no record of his burial at OHC or elsewhere. My guess is that he was Cora’s brother, and the uncle of little Jimmie and Bessie.\n\nFatal Accident\n\nThen you find one of those stories that just break your heart.\n\nBorn around 1845 in Maryland, John J. Mathias enlisted in the Union Army. He was assigned to the Third Maryland Volunteer Infantry, Company E, which was known as the Potomac Home Brigade. He married Nannie “Nancy” Stone (also of Maryland) in Ogle, Illinois in 1869. By 1860, they were living in Lisbon, Iowa with their infant son, John. That’s about 19 miles from Cedar Rapids.\n\nBy the 1880s, the Mathias family had moved to Cedar Rapids and John had gotten a job working in the fertilizer department of a packing house. On Feb. 17, 1887, John was killed in an accident that is detailed in the article below.\n\nNancy was left with their son, John, to fend for herself. A note published in the local newspaper a few days later expressed her thanks. This was a common practice back then. It sounds like John’s employer may have assisted her and John financially. They may have even provided his white bronze marker.\n\nSadly, Nancy died almost a year to the day of her husband’s death. There was no newspaper notice I could find but death records note she died on Feb. 17, 1888 of “disease of the liver and bowels”. Perhaps she also died of a broken heart.\n\nI could not find any trace of John W. Mathias, John and Nancy’s son, after she died. He would have been around 18 at the time, so hopefully he managed alright on his own. There is no record of him being buried at OHC.\n\nI’ll wrap things up next week in Part IV.\n\nLast week, I introduced you to Oak Hill Cemetery (OHC) in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. It’s a lovely place to wander around in and there was plenty to divert me.\n\nWhat I found was the story of a fellow who tried to fake his own death and start a new life, and the grave of a Cedar Rapids dentist who posed for one of America’s most famous paintings.\n\nLater in our trip, we visited the museum at Anamosa Penitentiary and its cemetery. However, I had no idea that when I was photographing graves earlier at OHC that I’d photographed the grave of an infamous former Anamosa prisoner named Frank Novak.\n\nFaked His Own Death\n\nBelow, you can see the Novak family plot at OHC. I photographed it because of the beautiful wood/tree-themed style of the surname monument and the individual stones that accompany it. Not because I ever thought there would be notoriety attached to it.\n\nIt all began with a mysterious 1:30 a.m. fire on Feb. 3, 1897 in a store called Novak & Jilek that awoke the residents of Walford, Iowa, about 12 miles southwest of Cedar Rapids. Missing was Frank Novak, the store’s owner.\n\nFrank Novak, 32, was the son of German immigrants John and Anna Novak. John emigrated from Bohemia in the 1860s and married Anna Cerveny in 1864. They had four children together and Frank was the oldest. John did well in his business/farming efforts and the family prospered.\n\nFrank was very charming, intelligent, and played the violin beautifully. Farm work was not to his taste, being of a less than robust constitution. Gambling was more his style. He was keen on starting new business ventures with his father’s help but none of them seemed to ever pan out.\n\nThe store he opened with his sister Blanche’s husband, Vaclav Jilek, however, seemed to succeed. But while Frank and Vaclav were on a train headed for the World’s Fair in Chicago, Ill. on July 23, 1893, Vaclav fell off on his way to another car on the train and was seriously injured, dying soon after. He is buried in the Novak plot at OHC.\n\nFrank rebuilt the store in 1896 and opened a small bank next door. That spring, burglars blew open the bank’s safe, making off with the contents. Frank swore it would never happen again and despite being married with children, would often sleep on a cot at the store next door to keep an eye on things.\n\nOn the night of Feb. 2, 1897 around 9 p.m. Frank and his other brother-in-law locked up the bank and store, then headed to Martin Loder’s tavern to have a beer. Among the patrons was drifter Edward Murray, an alcoholic often in and out of jail. Later, Frank and his brother-in-law were seen back at the store selling tobacco to two men who couldn’t get it at Loder’s along with Edward Murray.\n\nOnce the fire was out, the debris revealed a dead body. Everyone was sure it was Frank Novak since he was nowhere to be found. But examination of the man’s teeth soon revealed it wasn’t him. He’d recently had extensive dental work that was not present in the corpse’s mouth. Further exploration of the remains confirmed it was Edward Murray, whose skull had been bashed in. His sister, Nellie, confirmed it by an item found on his body.\n\nA Musical Murderer\n\nFrank had purchased several insurance policies on his own life totaling around $27,000 not long before he died. His plan was to leave his wife Mary (who knew nothing about it) financially settled while he pursued a new life with a new name elsewhere.\n\nNewly elected Benton County attorney M.J. Tobin was keen to track down Novak and detective C.C. Perrin took up the challenge. Thus began a pursuit covered in newspapers that was followed with interest by many across the country.\n\nIn a nutshell, Frank fled to Omaha, Neb. and purchased a train ticket to Portland, Ore. From there, he traveled by steamer to Alaska and ended up in the town of Dawson. Frank was captured in August 1897 by Perrin while playing violin in a dance hall. He was escorted back to Iowa for trial, where he received a life sentence from judge George W. Burnham for insurance fraud and murdering poor Edward Murray.\n\nBy now, Frank’s wife had divorced him, and was supporting herself and their sons Milo and Leo by running a boarding house.\n\n“Life” in Prison\n\nBut similar to today, “life” in prison didn’t always mean just that. At first, Frank served his time in Anamosa Penitentiary and behaved himself. By 1903, he was involved in photography and part of the prison band. His non-incarcerated friends petitioned Iowa’s governor for clemency. In 1908, Frank was transferred to a rougher prison in Fort Madison, where he started another prison orchestra.\n\nIn 1911, Frank was released when his life sentence was commuted by the governor because of having served 13 years already. He married Ella Johnson in 1913 and the couple moved to Chicago where he became a real estate broker, living a quiet life. Ella died in 1918.\n\nFrank’s mother, Anna, died in 1907 and was buried at OHC. Sadly, his father committed suicide on March 6, 1927 at age 88 when he turned up the gas on his home’s oven. The article below describes how John Novak made sure his pet canary was not harmed. He was buried beside Anna at OHC.\n\nFrank died on July 12, 1930 in Chicago. A few days later, his remains were sent to Oak Hill Cemetery in Cedar Rapids. He is buried in a corner of the family plot. Mary Novak never remarried and died in 1964. She and her sons (both lived long lives) are buried at Cedar Memorial Park in Cedar Rapids.\n\nAmerican Gothic Dentist\n\nOHC is also the final resting place of someone whose face you’ve likely seen, but you never knew who he actually was.\n\nBorn in 1891 in Anamosa, Iowa, artist Grant DeVolson Wood is noted for his paintings depicting the rural American Midwest. Most know him for his popular painting American Gothic. Earlier, we stopped at Iowa State University’s library in Ames to see some of Wood’s murals.\n\nWood took inspiration for the painting from what is now known as the American Gothic House in Eldon, Iowa, along with “the kind of people [he] fancied should live in that house”. It depicts a farmer standing beside his daughter – often mistakenly assumed to be his wife. The painting’s name is a word play on the house’s architectural style, Carpenter Gothic.\n\nWood asked his sister, Nan Wood Graham, to be the model for the daughter, dressing her in a colonial-print apron mimicking 20th-century rural Americana.\n\nThe model for the father was the Wood family’s dentist and Gran’s friend, Dr. Byron McKeeby. Nan told others that Grant had envisioned the pair as father and daughter, not husband and wife, which Wood himself confirmed in his letter to Nellie Sudduth in 1941: “The prim lady with him is his grown-up daughter.”\n\nWood painted Dr. McKeeby in his dental office. Dr. McKeeby, then 62, put on overalls and held a prop pitchfork. The rest of the painting, including Nan, was completed nearby in Woods’ studio. Nan and McKeeby never posed together in front of the Eldon house.\n\nDr. McKeeby studied dentistry at the University of Iowa, graduating in 1894 and founded his first practice in Winthrop, Iowa. He moved to Cedar Rapids in 1901 where he established an office which he maintained almost until his death.\n\nDenial Then Acceptance\n\nAt first, Dr. McKeeby distanced himself from the painting’s popularity. Friends thought it was him and even joked about the pitchfork’s role in his dental procedures. But Dr. McKeeby stood firm in his denials. Because the dentist was known around town for his dapper style and affable sense of humor, the real Dr. McKeeby was nothing like the dour farmer in the painting.\n\nIn 1935, Dr. McKeeby admitted he was the farmer. Cy Douglass, an Associated Press news bureau chief, helped coax his confession. Dr. McKeeby’s oldest son was married to Douglass’ sister.\n\nDr. McKeeby eventually embraced his part in the painting, appreciating the fact that he looked more like the rustic farmer as he got older.\n\nIn 1943, Dr. McKeeby was interviewed about his unexpected fame. He said, “‘It made it (the friendship) a little bumpy, but nobody could really be mad at Grant Wood. He painted a beautiful picture of a bridge for my new house and when he gave it to me he said, ‘Doctor, you made me a bridge once, now I’ve made you one!’ ”\n\nDr. McKEeeby died on Jan. 6, 1950 at age 82. He is buried at OHC beside his first wife, Belle Metcalf McKeeby, who died in 1917.\n\nNan Wood Graham is buried in Riverside Cemetery in Anamosa with her brother, Grant. We visited that cemetery, too. I’ll share more about them in an upcoming blog post.\n\nNext time, I’ll be featuring some of the white bronze (zinc) markers of Oak Hill Cemetery."
