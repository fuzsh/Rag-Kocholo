One of the highlights of "Palisades History Day" in June of 2005 was a tour of the Palisades Cemetery, which contains the gravesites of many locally renowned people.

Consisting of three acres on the north side of Closter Road, its entrance gate is behind 15 Closter Road. It was originally the Lawrence family burial ground and stayed in the family until about 1892 when it was bought, in pieces, by Sam Brown. It passed to his son, George, then to his widow, Helen, who sold it to real estate dealer Karl Kirshner in 1949. It was then sold to Adolfo Luca, of Brooklyn, in the early 1960s. There are close to 370 plots; of these about 200 are unsold. Plots can still be purchased from Mr. Luca (845) 566-0979. The cemetery is open daily. Visitors are asked to please enter and leave the cemetery quietly, as they have to cross private property to enter, and to shut the gate behind them.

A brief description of some of the gravestones:

Mary Lawrence (d: 1774) and Jonathan Lawrence (The "Elder Senior") (b: 1695-d: 1777). These are the oldest stones in the cemetery.
