Maplewood Cemetery was established as the town of Charlottesville's first official resting place for the dead in 1827.[1] However, its oldest grave marker is from 1777, which suggests that some graves may have been moved to Maplewood after the cemetery was opened. [1] The cemetery is a few blocks north of downtown, with the main entrance gate at 425 Maple Street. The 3.6 acre historic burial ground is bordered by Maple Street, Lexington Avenue, Taylor Street and 8th Street NE. The land is owned and maintained by the city of Charlottesville.[1] Among the burials at Maplewood are scores of noteworthy citizens who left their mark on the city. In addition, there are over 100 unmarked graves of civil war soldiers.[1]

There are two large, public cemeteries in Charlottesville: Maplewood Cemetery and Oakwood Cemetery. Maplewood contains hundreds of burials; it was established in 1827 or 1829 by the city of Charlottesville. Several African American families have plots in Maplewood. There are also a handful of slaves buried adjacent to family plots. For example, the photos at the right illustrates a gravestone for "Linie Winston." The inscription reads "a faithful servant." She is buried in the Williams family plot - adjacent to the graves of Thomas J. Williams (1832–1922) and his wife, Anna Harman Williams (1840-1922) - suggesting that she worked for that family. Unfortunately, her stone does not include a date.

Landscape

The imposing tree at the center of the walled cemetery displays characteristics of two members of the White Oak group—the Bur Oak and the Post Oak. Oaks often intermix within their groups, but this cross is unusual. The Bur Oak and the Post Oak are both known for their distinctive leaves. They are round-lobed, waxy, and deep green in color. To take a closer look at this tree on foot, enter the cemetery on Maple Street. Now part of the Martha Jefferson Historic District, Maplewood Cemetery was established in 1827, but it reflects the burial and landscaping practices of an earlier century. There are no formal streets or paths, and no formal plantings. Trees and shrubs appear randomly among the weathered headstones and monuments, as in an old country churchyard.

Why Do So Many Headstones Face East

Many headstones in cemeteries face east for religious or practical reasons. This practice can be traced back to ancient Egyptians and Greeks, who worshipped the sun god. Biblical scripture also contributes to this practice among Christians. The concept of being buried facing east came to represent embracing the next life, which contributed to its widespread acceptance, especially in Judeo-Christian societies.[2]

Biblical Inspiration

Of Christians, the practice of east-facing tombstones can also be traced to the bible. The scripture (Matthew 24:27), which talks about the second coming of Christ, teaches that he will come from the east. This belief also affects how Christian churches are built. The entrances face the west so that during services, worshippers face the east while looking at the altar.[2]

Since most Christians prefer burying their dead in this direction, many headstones in Maplewood cemetery have this arrangement. A notable exception is clergy members who are buried facing west. This is based on the belief that when the rapture occurs and the dead rise, the clergy will rise and face their congregation, positioned and ready to lead them again.[2]
