Her parents were Prince Valdemar of Denmark and his wife Princess Marie of Orleans. Her parents had agreed beforehand that all their sons would be raised Lutheran, their father's creed, and all their daughters Roman Catholic, their mother's faith. She was therefore the first Danish princess since the Reformation raised a Roman Catholic. She was named for her mother's sister Princess Marguerite d'Orléans. Her mother died in 1909.

In 1921, she married Prince René of Bourbon-Parma whose father was Robert I, Duke of Parma. She was the youngest grandchild of King Christian IX and Queen Louise of Denmark.
