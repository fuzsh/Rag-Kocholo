        "text": "Juwelen des dänischen Königshauses| Princess Marie de Orleans Opal Diadem| Prinzessin Viggo von Dänemark\n\nOpal and Diamond Tiara Princess Marie of Orleans|Opal Parure Duchess of Chartres|Royal Jewels Denmark\n\nThe opal and diamond spray tiara is worn by Princess Marie of Orléans, wife of prince Waldemar of Denmark.\n\nThis opal set is that Princess Marie's mother, the Duchess of Chartres had a all set of brazilian opales. She had three inventories of her jewelry made : 1881, 1903 and 1919.\n\nThe opales set of opal necklace, opal earrings and a opal brooch, is mentionned in the first one but not in the two others; As Princess Marie got married to prince Waldemar in 1885, the opales set, remounted on a tiara and a collier de chien for the occasion, may have been a wedding gift from her mother.\n\nThe french press noted, the wedding gift of the Duchess de Chartres:\n\n\"L. AA. RR. le duc et la duchesse de Chartres : une parure complète, rubis et diamants, vraiment incomparable\"\n\nDuchesse de Chartres Parure de rubis, collier, ornement de tête, broche et bracelet.\"\n\nThe collier and bracelet was made with rubis, it was the famous collier de chien, which mach her artistic opal tiara, like bunch of diamond reed sheat with flowering reed and dandelions, the danelions and the flowering reed of opals.\n\nThe diamond \"base\" from which the original opals were mounted was inherited by her son Prince Aage and was worn by his wife.\n\nThe opals were given to Prince Viggo and his wife the Countess of Rosenborg, had one or two tiaras made from the opals together with some other stones probably sapphire.\n\nHowever it is also true that the diamond base can be worn alone and that Princess Aage wore it this way, the whole opal tiara was impossible to wear in the 1920s as a bandeau as the fashion wanted it at the time.\n\nAnd the base as a tiara without the opals is also quite beautiful. Princess Aage was wearing the tiara that way several times and she has been photographed with the tiara worn as a bandeau.\n\nPrincess Ruth was wearing the opals on the occassion of the royal wedding in Norway, see above, left side and on the wedding from Queen Margarethe of Denmark.\n\nQueen Marie of Romania, a Princess of Bourbon-Parma, lent this base in the 1980, for an occassion in Monte-Carlo, as well as she lent the fringe diamond tiara from Princess Viggo- for the gala in Athens.\n\nOctober 22, 1885 Royal Orleans Wedding\n\nEu, France The marriage of Prince Waldemar, third son of King Christian of Denmark, and Princess Marie, daughter of the Duc and Duchesse de Chartres, was celebrated today at the Château d’Eu, the residence of the Comte de Paris. The civil ceremony was performed yesterday in Paris by the Mayor, and the religious services were conducted here today in the private chapel of the château. Among those present were the Queen of Denmark, the Crown Prince of and Princess of Denmark, the Prince and Princess of Wales, and their three daughters, Prince de Joinville, the Duc d’Aumale, Duc Decazes, the Duc and Duchesse de Chartres, and Count von Motlke-Hvifeld, the Danish Minister.\n\nThe handsome park and extensive gardens surrounding the château were to-night brilliantly illuminated with electric lights and Chinese lanterns. The town was profusely decorated with flags and bunting, and many private houses were also illuminated in honor of the event. Everything passed off pleasantly. At the wedding breakfast, the Prince of Wales proposed a toast to the health of the bride and bridegroom. The latter subsequently departed for Chantilly.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Oct. 22. – Today was observed as a general holiday in honor of the marriage of Prince Waldemar and Princess Marie d'Orléans. A banquet was given at the royal castle to celebrate the event, and torchlight processions from neighboring villages marched through the city. Premier Estrupp was warmly received.\n\nBy the marriage of this d'Orléans Princess to this young Prince of Denmark, the ‘Maison de France’ is once again restored to the great reigning royal families of Europe. There are a baker’s dozen of Princes, and just 14 Princesses in the House of France, but of this lot several – their descendants likewise – are excluded from any claim to the French throne.\n\nIt is true that not one of the entire 27 wears crown or is even heir presumptive to a throne, although it is possible that the Comte d’Eu may someday be Prince Consort to the sovereign ruler of Brazil, as his wife is heir apparent to Dom Pedro, of the South American Empire. The intermarrying habit of the House of France has perhaps been a good thing in the matter of binding family ties, but the political effect has been unapparent and they never gained any substantial foreign influence by such marriages. I think it was some sort of political consideration that brought about this royal wedding, and it certainly is believed in France that the Comte de Paris personally arranged the whole affair.\n\nNaturally, the marriage of his niece to the son of King Christian IX and the recent election successes of Monarchists must make the head of the d'Orléans family feel quite contented with himself as well as with the world in general. Nothing can prove this better than the mere fact of his having lent his famous country seat on the seashore for the wedding. I have visited the château, and while it is not at all grand it certainly is interesting. The royal château is at the edge of a small town called Eu – hence its name – a place not far from Treport, on the shore of the English Channel, below Boulougne. Eu is built on the side of a hill and possesses an old cathedral, in the crypt of which are many curious tombs. On many of these tombs are recumbent statues of the persons buried underneath; the statues are carved out of gray stone, but the heads and hands are rich white marble. Close by the cathedral is an ancient college wherein Bourdaloue preached his first sermon. The château stands back of the church. It is large and massive, and has an air of antiquity about it. The historical souvenirs of the site go back to the time when Charlemagne had a fortified castle there, and it is known that William the Conqueror was married in this castle to the Princess Mathilde. In after years it was part of the dower which Catherine of Cleves took to the Duc Henri de Guise when she married into the House of Lorraine. The present building was begun in 1511, but it was more than a century and a half later before the Duchesse de Montpensier laid out its beautiful park and farm. It was here ‘La Grande Mademoiselle’ carried on her intrigue with the handsome Chevalier de Lauzun, and history records that one day they had such a ‘lover’s quarrel’ that she marked his face with the pretty pink nails of her fingers. But when her lover got into trouble and the Bastille, she willingly gave the place to the Duc de Maine to secure his release. De Maine’s sons died without issue, and the property passed into the possession of the Duc de Penthièvre, who bequeathed it to his son-in-law, Philippe Égalité, who left it to Louis Philippe. The ‘Citizen King’ entertained Queen Victoria here once upon a time. Louis Napoléon confiscated Eu with other d'Orléans estates, but Thiers got them all back for the family in 1871. The park and grounds are extensive and finely laid out, and are open to the public on Fridays and Sundays. With the exception of a splendid picture gallery the interior has no special attractions, although the receptions rooms are large and handsomely decorated.\n\nThere is every reason to believe that this is a genuine love match. Certainly the royal couple are ‘awfully spoony.’ I once saw them in a box at the Paris Hippodrome on a Friday night; she was holding his hand in hers, and during the entr’acte they ate bonbons out of a pretty little package that he took from his coat-tail pocket. The bride is a lovely young lady, not handsome, nor even princely looking, but she is good and pure and intelligent; rather reserved, maybe, but never haughty or stuck up like some of the Bourbons. The bride looks very much like her mother, the Duchesse de Chartres, a truly royal person. Her father, the Prince de Joinville is known in this country. The Duchesse has a deep affection for her children, fulfills faithfully all her domestic duties, and is one of the most charitable and refined ladies on the Continent. She can swim, ride, shoot, speaks English of course – I never heard of a member of the d'Orléans family that could not – and paints well. The Duc de Chartres served on Gen. McClellan’s staff during the civil war. He is a second son of that Duc d'Orléans who was accidentally killed just outside of Paris by his carriage horses running away. All the d'Orléans Princes wanted to serve their country in the German War of 1870, but the Imperial Government refused to let them fulfill this sacred duty. Then the Duc de Chartres slipped into France, enlisted as a private under the name of Robert Lefort, and so distinguished himself that he not only rose to the rank of Captain, but was decorated with the Cross of the Legion of Honor. After the war he was allowed to retain his commission, and was successively promoted until he became Colonel of a crack regiment of Hussars. He was considered by General de Gallifet and other competent authorities as one of the most efficient officers in the service when three years ago he and all other gentlemen of royal parentage were summarily dismissed from the French Army. Since then the Duc has been living the life of a private gentleman in Paris and at his brother’s place at Eu. The Duc’s reputation as a writer as he does the sword, one of his books, a study of the Valley of the Rhine and the heroic deeds therein of earlier French soldiers being a splendid literary monument to the history of other days.\n\nGood reports are given of the young Danish Prince who is to marry this fair girl of France, but then the Schlewig-Holsteins are a wonderfully good family. There are two branches of the Royal House of Denmark, but the right of inheritance of the elder branch, the Augustenbergs, died out with Frederick VII. That King married a dressmaker. Of course their children could not inherit and when the King died the Danish Parliament chose his cousin, Christian, to succeed him. As a matter of fact Christian was not at the head of the younger branch when thus elected, but he was the only Prince among a lot who had not taken up arms against Denmark in its troubles with Prussia in 1848. At first he was not at all popular with his people, but his sound common sense, justice, and domestic manners soon won them over, and today he is greatly esteemed by all his loyal subjects. He likes to walk unattended through the streets of Copenhagen, and often people who had disputes about business or property instead of going to law about it, stop him and request him to decide the case for them. He is not, however, what you would call a liberal King; on the contrary, he is a conservative, and for some years past he has been having quite a time of it with Parliament. The quarrel originated in the project of fortifying Copenhagen. The King, who had not been able to console himself of the annexation of Schleswig-Holstein by Prussia, wanted to fortify the capital. Parliament refused on the ground that a people numbering 2,000,000 would always be too feeble to resist a foreign foe, and it was no use making elaborate preparations to do the impossible.\n\nThe Danish King has always had good luck in getting his children married. There are six of them. The eldest, the heir apparent, is married to a daughter of the Scandinavian King. The second son, George, is King of Greece, and his wife is a niece of the Emperor of Russia.\n\nThe third son, Waldemar, is the bridegroom of today. There are also three daughters. One of them, Dagmar, is the Empress of Russia. Another, Alexandra, is Princess of Wales, and will be Queen of England some day; and the third, the Duchess of Cumberland, ought now to be Queen of Hanover.\n\nAs a father, King Christian has brought up his children carefully and with much liberty of thought as to religion. It was easy enough for the Princess Alexandra to pass from Lutheranism to the Church of England faith when she married Albert Edward, and so, too, was it easy for the Princess Dagmar to enter the Greek Church when she was wedded to the Czarevitch. Prince George stipulated that he might remain a Lutheran when he accepted the Greek crown, but his six children are all being brought up under the spiritual care of the Patriarch of Constantinople.\n\nThe Princess Marie of Orléans is a devout Roman Catholic, and the Pope would never have permitted her to marry the Prince Waldemar had not the latter promised that their children, if they have any, shall be piously educated in the faith of their mother.\n\nSources:Daily Telegraph Courier; London Daily News ;London Evening Standard; ST.
