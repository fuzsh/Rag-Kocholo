        "text": "Danish Royalty: Christian IX's Children -- Valdemar (1858-1939)\n\nValdemar was born in 1858. As the youngest child and born after a considerable gap from his four older more famous brothers and sisters, there was as a result, no great intimacy between them. Prince Walderman became a Naval Officer. He married Princess Marie d'Orleans in 1885. Her father was Robert, Duke of Chartres (1840- ). Her mother was Francisca d'Orleans (1844-1909). Prince Valdemar and Marie has five children, four boys and a girl. The boys were: Aage Christian Alexander, Count of Rosenborg, (1887- ), Axel Christian George (1888- ), Erik Frederik, Duke of Rosenburg (1890- ), Viggo Christian Adolph George, Count of Rosenborg (1893- ). The girl was the baby of the family. Her name was Margrethe Fran√ßoise (1895- ). We know little about this family. We do know that Prince Axel married Swedish Princess Margaretha, the eldest daughter of Prince Karl in s high profile society wedding (1919). Margaretha was the first Swedush princess in decades, in contrast to the more prolific Danish royal family. By all accountss it was a very happy marriage. Their mother apparently liked to dress the boys in identical sailor suits. The boys, especially the first three were both very close together. This made in easy to dress them identically. Note that the sailor style was not considered appropriate for their baby sister. When young the boys wore sailor dresses. Their hair appears to have been cut at an early age, well before they were breached.\n\nHBRC\n\nNavigate the Boys' Historical Clothing Web Site royal pages:\n\n[Return to the Main Christian IX's children page]\n\n[Return to the Main royal pages]\n\n[Austria] [Belgium] [Denmark] [France] [Germany] [Italy] [Luxenburg] [Monaco] [Netherlands] [Norway] [Romania] [Russia] [Spain] [United Kingdom]\n\nCreated: June 11, 2002\n\nLast updated: 2:56 AM 5/3/2013"
