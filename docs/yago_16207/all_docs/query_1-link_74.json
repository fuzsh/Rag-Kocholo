        "text": "On June 9th 1921 a couple got married in a church in Copenhagen. He was 26 years old and his bride 25. It was, however, not just any odd couple and the circumstances were not that normal either. The bride was Her Royal Highness Princess Margrethe of Denmark, daughter of His Royal Highness Prince Waldemar of Denmark – himself the youngest son of His Majesty King Christian IX of Denmark – and Her Royal Highness Princess Marie, born a Princess of Orléans. And in that last word in the previous sentence lies a clue to the not so normal circumstances of this union. The official religion in Denmark was Protestantism and had been so for many centuries. So one would naturally assume that a granddaughter of the King of Denmark would marry a Protestant in a Protestant church. However, this was not the case. The groom was His Royal Highness Prince René of Bourbon-Parma. He came from a Catholic family and the wedding took place in the Catholic Sacred Heart of Jesus church. As for the bride, in spite of being a member of the Protestant Danish Royal Family this granddaughter of King Christian IX had also been raised in the Catholic faith. This was down to her mother being born into the French Royal family. Back in 1885 when Prince Waldemar and Princess Marie had married it had been decided that any sons born of the union would be raised as Protestants while any daughters would be raised as Catholics. It so happened that the bride on this day in 1921 was the only daughter born to this Protestant / Catholic union.\n\nPrincess Margrethe had been born in September 1895 and received the names Margrethe Françoise Louise Marie. She was baptised in her parents’ home on September 19th, only two days after her birth. However, as dictated by custom a baptism at home should be followed up by a christening performed in a church or chapel when possible. Thus a grander christening was planned for October 15th, which would be witnessed by a number of family members as well as public representatives as was fitting for a granddaughter of the King of Denmark.\n\nHer mother died already in 1909 leaving Princess Margrethe motherless at the age of 10. Prince René’s father was the Duke of Parma and his mother born Infanta of Portugal. He had a large number of half-siblings and siblings, the most famous of them would probably the last Empress of Austria, Zita. His brother Felix married the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and one of his half-sisters had married Ferdianand I, Prince of Bulgaria.\n\nEngagement\n\nThe Royal engagement was made public on Friday March 11th. It was reported as coming as a great surprise to most, even to those close to Prince Valdemar and his family it was claimed. Though a complete surprise to many it cannot have been to everybody because some organizing had clearly gone into it. On the previous day Prince Erik, one of Princess Margrethe’s brothers, had arrived from Paris in the company of Prince René and two of his brothers, Prince Sixtus and Prince Felix. The latter was the husband of Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg. The three Parma princes had not been put up in any Royal lodgings but instead checked into Hotel d’Angleterre.\n\nOn the day of the engagement Prince Waldemar then accompanied Prince René to the Royal Palace where he presented him to Their Majesties the King and Queen and immediately afterwards to Her Majesty the Queen Dowager Queen Louise.\n\nAs this day coincided with the 22nd birthday of the Danish Crown Prince the groom-to-be was able to meet the rest of the family after the happy news was announced at the birthday reception and luncheon that had been arranged.\n\nLater that evening Prince Waldemar gave a small family dinner at his Copenhagen home the Yellow Palace. In addition to the Danish Royal Family only Prince René and his two brothers were present.\n\nThe following day Prince Waldemar hosted another dinner in honour of the newly engaged couple, this time several friends of the family were also invited to celebrate the happy news.\n\nOn Sunday Their Majesties gave a dinner at their Palace at the Amalienborg Palace complex where also the Parma Princes were invited. Whether this was a dinner that had been in the planning for a long time or whether it was specifically to celebrate this engagement is not specified by the notices in the newspapers.\n\nThe chance for Prince René to meet with the Danish family did not end there. For on the next day another Royal dinner took place, this time hosted by the Dowager Queen at her residence. And as this was Princess Thyra’s birthday even a reception and luncheon had been held earlier in the day, also at the Dowager Queen’s Palace.\n\nWhether any of these dinners – or indeed all of them – were tiara events or not is impossible to say based on the information available at this moment. As they were considered more private events sadly no extensive reporting was done in the newspapers of the day.\n\nPre-wedding events\n\nAs was common with Royal weddings in those days the festivities started already a few days previous to the big day itself. So even though the wedding day had been set to June 9th, the first wedding guests started to arrive a few days earlier.\n\nFrom Berlin on the 6th, which was also Denmark’s National Day, came the bridegroom’s mother, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Parma, Maria Antonia in the company of three sons, one daughter and one daughter-in-law. They were met at the Central Railway Station by the groom and his soon-to-be brother-in-laws Their Royal Highnesses Prince Axel and Prince Erik and His Highness Prince Aage Count of Rosenborg. Representing the Danish court was Chamberlain C. A. Rothe. Also arriving on this day were the 2nd Duke of Magenta General Marie Armand Patrice de MacMahon – the bride’s uncle through marriage – and his daughter Isabelle MacMahon. His wife, the Duchess (a sister to the Duchess of Parma), was not able to attend the wedding.\n\nThat same evening Prince Waldemar hosted a grand dinner followed by a ball at Bernsdorff Palace. In addition to the Danish Royal Family and the Royal Guests many of Princess Margrethe’s close friends were present as well as friends of the family.\n\nLuckily there is a photograph taken of most of the Royal guests attending the dinner. They are pictured standing outside the Palace in all their finery. The guests coming from abroad were able to quickly change into fashionable evening wear and glittering tiaras before the dinner. What is a bit odd about the photograph is that Queen Alexandrine is seen standing on the outside stairs without a tiara. It must be safe to say that she was not one particularly fond of wearing grand jewels. But in this case it looks a bit odd as most of the other guests are indeed wearing tiaras. And what makes it even stranger is that according to some reports in the newspapers of the day she is described as wearing a tiara just like the other Royal ladies. The Queen’s dress is described by the same newspapers as being of a red golden colour.\n\nAnother guest it is a bit difficult to establish whether she wore a tiara or not is Her Majesty the Queen Dowager of Denmark. She most likely did wear one, but in the black and white photo it is not very clear as her white hear is not allowing any jewel worn in it stand out. Had she worn coloured gem stones maybe it would have been clearer, but if she did wear a tiara it was most likely with only diamonds or diamonds and pearls.\n\nPrincess Margrethe is said to have been especially happy about her other aunt Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager of Russia being able to attend the wedding. Her other aunts, Her Majesty the Queen Dowager of the United Kingdom Queen Alexandra and Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cumberland, Thyra, were not able to attend any of the Danish celebrations. In the photograph the Empress is standing next to her sister-in-law the Queen Dowager of Denmark. She is not wearing a grand tiara as such, but because her hair is still quite dark it is possible to see that she is wearing a type of aigrette topped either by a single large diamond or a pearl. In fact it looks like it could be an element from her well-known Diamond and Pearl Wave set. The tiara, necklace and brooch from this set were pictured among the jewels confiscated by the Bolsheviks after the Russian revolution, so this begs the question: is the piece worn by the Empress on this evening really from this set? If so, how is that possible? Could it be a separate piece belonging to the set that the Empress had been able to take with her when she escaped from Russia? Or was the confiscated set sold in its entirety by the Bolsheviks and broken up and as such this element could have found its way back to the Empress by the way of the purchaser of the set offering this element to her? We will probably never know.\n\nThe mother of the bridegroom, the Duchess of Bourbon-Parma, was very appropriately dressed all down to her long white opera gloves. Around her neck she seems to be wearing three diamond rivières and the whole look is topped with the famous diamond Bourbon-Parma tiara.\n\nHer daughter-in-law, Princess Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma, Marie de La Rochefoucauld wore the Chaumet Fuchsia Diamond tiara low on her forehead as was the fashion at this point in time. It had been a wedding gift to her when she married Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma. He was, as already mentioned above, the brother of Prince René. The Princess is also seen wearing a long rope of pearls (or diamonds?) around her neck, a stomacher and pearl (or diamonds again?) earrings pending from a long chain.\n\nAnother lady wearing her tiara according to fashion was Princess George of Greece, born Princess Marie Bonaparte. She had chosen to wear her famous Olive Wreath tiara and it was worn rather flat on her dark hair. Around her neck hang two long rows of pearls. Her dress was made in a wine red colour with a low cut neckline and an asymmetrical train.\n\nPrincess Axel looked striking in a gown of green and gold brocade. She wore her late mother-in-law’s Diamond Swirl tiara. This was of course a very touching choice ensuring that the bride’s mother’s memory was at least present through a piece of her jewels.\n\nThe Danish Princesses Dagmar and Thyra were also wearing glittering jewels. Both are seen with tiaras in their hair, but none that can be clearly identified. Princess Thyra’s could in fact maybe be a necklace or a bracelet worn on a frame. Her pearl choker is easy to spot though and it looks like she is even wearing a couple of more rows of pearls around her neck. Her sister, Princess Dagmar, is also wearing either a diamond or pearl string around her neck with a pendant (a cross?). The pendant is not very clear, but something is pulling down on the string in the centre, and that must be a pendant of some sort.\n\nAs for the gentlemen, most of them were in white-tie. Only Crown Prince Frederick (IX) and Prince Knud are seen in some sort of naval uniform. The King and the Danish Princes are all wearing the Sash and Star of the Order of the Elephant. Some of them, like His Majesty, Prince Harald and Prince Waldemar, are also wearing the neck-tie of the Order of Dannebrog. Likewise Prince George of Greece wore the Sash and Star of the Order of the Elephant and a neck-tie of what most likely was the one of the Order of Dannebrog.\n\nThe groom, not having been awarded the Order of the Elephant yet, wore three Breast Stars as well as a pale Sash across his chest. The Sash would have been the one for the Parma Sacred Military Constantinian Order of Saint George combined with the corresponding Star, this being the highest Order of the Duchy. Another of the Stars belongs to the Order of Saint Louis for Civil Merit, the second highest Order of the Duchy of Parma. It is harder to identify the third Star which is pinned next to the one for the Order of Saint George. Could this perhaps be a Belgian Order?\n\nSpotting what the groom’s brothers are wearing of decorations is a bit more complicated, though it would make sense that they would at least wear the Orders of the Duchy of Parma. It does seem, however, like Prince Sixtus is in fact wearing a darker coloured Sash than the pale blue one of the Order of Saint George. Maybe he is also wearing a Belgian Order and as such its Sash?\n\nMore guests were also present, but they were not included in the photograph. Actually, one of the Royal guests also doesn’t seem to have made it into the photograph. Grand Duchess Olga of Russia, sister of the murdered Emperor, is reported to have been present. And her two young sons can be seen in the photograph. But she is not in it.\n\nDuring the meal Prince Waldemar made a heart-warming speech to his beloved daughter and his soon-to-be son-in-law.\n\nThe gates to the Palace park had remained open and more and more people had made their way to the Palace grounds hoping to get a glimpse of the guests – of course – but probably most of all of their Princess Margrethe. They were rewarded when Princess Margrethe in a moonshine coloured tulle dress appeared smiling at the arm of her fiancé. Enthusiastic cheers erupted from the crowd and many of them must have made their way back to their homes rather excited of having been able to see the Princess and Prince.\n\nAfterwards there was dancing to the music provided by Marius Hansen and his popular band. The ball continued until one o’clock in the morning when the guests made their way back to their respective accommodations.\n\nAnother blog entry about the pre-wedding event:\n\nAt lunch time the following day the Royal guests gathered again at Bernstorff Palace.\n\nOn the day before the wedding Prince Waldemar had invited to a small family dinner. As this was somewhat more private than the ball he hosted the other day nothing much was reported about it in the press. So whether it was a full gala formal dinner with tiaras and orders, or a bit more relaxed, is not known.\n\nWedding Day – June 9th\n\nIn the early morning hours of the very day of the wedding everything looked peaceful at Bernsdorff Palace, the summer residence of Prince Waldemar on the outskirts of Copenhagen. At the gates an arch made of greenery and Danish flags had been erected branding the initials of the bridal couple at the very top. The avenue leading up to the Palace itself was also wonderfully decorated with Danish flags hoisted up temporary flag poles – one by each tree.\n\nInside the Palace bouquets of fresh flowers from well-wishers, both private and official, had been placed everywhere and the floral scents must have filled all the splendid rooms. Two beautiful large bouquets of orchids and roses had been sent by the Danish Government and the Diplomatic Corps station in Denmark.\n\nBut then it was time. The Royal vehicles drove up to the front doors of the Palace and the Royal guests staying with the family all got into their respective ones. One by one they began their drive into Copenhagen. The last ones to leave the Palace were the bride and her father.\n\nMeanwhile, inside the church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus the people who had been lucky enough to receive an invite to the ceremony slowly filled up the pews. These included representatives from the official authorities, like the Prime Minister and other ministers in the Danish Government, the Chief Justice of the Danish Supreme Court and members of the Corps Diplomatique. But naturally seats had also been reserved for courtiers and also members of Prince Waldemar’s staff, friends of the family and leading members of the Danish Catholic community.\n\nAlready several hours before the ceremony was to take place people had thronged the streets making up the processional route. They all wanted to see their beloved Princess as she embarked on this new stage of her life and take part in her happiness of having found true love.\n\nThe interior of the church was decorated very tastefully and to great effect. In addition to the green provided by the many palms and the large quantity of ivy brought into the church the colour scheme had been kept in the Princess’ alleged favourite colours; white and pink. White and pink peonies bound with ivy had been fastened at the end of each pew and in the rest of the church the flowers used were mainly rhododendrons and hydrangeas. On both sides of the steps leading up to the choir elaborate standards had been put up; to the left the white standard of Christ with the letters I. H. S. embroidered in gold and to the right the standard of St Canute (Knud), also in gold.\n\nTo the left and right of the altar, along with large floral decorations, were a number of large candles, the largest one decorated with painted flowers and an image of the Virgin Mary in black. These had been bought by the bridal couple themselves in Paris during the Princess’ last visit there.\n\nUpon the altar itself were seen two floral crosses in the colour of the Danish flag of red and white and two floral crosses in the colour of the French flag of red, blue and white.\n\nSix gilded rococo chairs had been placed in the choir facing the altar. The two in the middle were for the bridal couple, while the two on the right were for Their Majesties the King and Queen and the last two to the left were for the parents of the bride and groom. Several smaller chairs had been placed behind them for the page boys and the junior bridesmaids to sit.\n\nAs the guests began to arrive to the church they were received by the Marshal of the Court Chamberlain W. Rothe, Commander Amdrup (Prince Waldemar’s Aide-de-Camp) and Chamberlain Krieger. Just before noon the church bells began to ring and the Master of the Horse Count Friis arrived at the entrance wearing his splendid uniform with Orders and medals gleaming from his red tunic. This was the sign that the Royal party was about to arrive.\n\nWhen the first Royal guests arrived they were received by the Marshal of the Court and lead into a small ante-chamber where they would wait for the rest of the Royal guests before walking up the aisle in procession as per protocol.\n\nOnce all the Royal guests had arrived, with the King and Queen being the last, the Royal procession was formed and they walked slowly up to their seats reserved for them. The King and Queen, wearing a grey silk dress, walked first followed by the groom and his mother the Duchess of Parma, also in a grey silk dress. His Majesty looked very smart in his uniform of a General in the Danish Army and the pale blue Sash and the Breast Star of the Order of the Elephant and the Neck-tie and Breast Star of the Order of Dannebrog. The groom was dressed in white-tie proudly wearing his new Danish Order together with Parma Orders. Her Majesty the Queen Dowager, wearing a splendid red and purple dress, came next escorted by the Crown Prince in his naval uniform. Immediately behind them walked Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager of Russia with Prince Sixtus of Parma followed by Prince George and Princess Helena. He donned his naval uniform with Danish and Greek Orders while the Princess wore a striking green chiffon dress with silk embroidery and a black hat. Princess George of Greece in a black silk dress with large pale red and pale blue flower motif and a hat in the same colour was escorted by Prince Harald of Denmark.\n\nAlmost as soon as the last of the youngest Royal guests had taken their seats loud cheers could be heard from outside the church. It was the arrival of the bridal carriage. Again the church bells sounded and the door into the church opened up to let the bride and her proud father in. They stopped for a minute while as the beautiful dress was being straightened out before walking slowly up the aisle. The congregation rose while the organ played the Danish composer Fini Henriques’ Entry March. Princess Margrethe looked overjoyed as she walked next to her father. Her long train of magnificent lace was the one worn by her late mother. It was held in place by a wreath of myrtle and orange flowers together with a delicate diamond tiara, a gift from the groom. In her hand she wore a bouquet of large white lilies.\n\n—-\n\nAfter the ceremony in the church the Royal Family drove back to Amalienborg where Their Majesties offered a luncheon in honour of the newly-weds. The guests who had been lucky (or important) enough to receive an invitation to the luncheon were received first by the bridal couple, then by Prince Waldemar, the Duchess of Parma, the Queen Dowager and the King. When having offered their congratulations the guests moved into the Tapestry Room where they remain until all the guests have been welcomed by the Royal greeting line.\n\nOn the signal from the Court Marshal the guests made their way into the beautiful Great Hall, also known as the Hall of Knights, to the sound of the Riberhus March as played by the band from the Royal Guards. Once all the guests have found their seats the Royal procession makes its entry. First walks the bridal couple who are seated in the centre of the main table by the large windows. Behind them follows His Majesty the King and Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Parma. They take their place to the right of the bride. Her Majesty the Queen sits to the left of the groom and is escorted by HRH Prince Sixte. Then follows HRH Prince Waldemar with Her Imperial Majesty the Empress Dowager at his side and they take their place in front of the bridal couple. Her Majesty the Queen Dowager has been placed to Prince Waldemar’s left and she is escorted into the room by HRH the Crown Prince. HRH Prince Xavier of Parma leads HRH Princess George of Greece. HIH Grand Duchess Olga is escorted by HRH Prince Axel while HRH Prince Knud enters the room with HH Princess Aage by his side. Princess Margrethe’s uncle the Duke of Magenta escorted HRH Princess Axel while HRH Prince Felix had offered his arm to HRH Princess Thyra. The last couples included HRH Prince George of Greece with HRH Princess Helena, HRH Prince Louis of Parma with HRH Princess Dagmar, HRH Prince Erik with Miss Mac-Mahon, HRH Prince Gustav with HRH Princess Isabella of Parma and finally HRH Prince Harald with HRH Princess Sixte.\n\nAmong the official guests are the highest ranking Danish authorities. The Corps Diplomatique is represented by M Allart, the doyen (the diplomat stationed for the longest time in the country) and the French Minister to Denmark and his wife Viscount and Viscountess de Fontenay. So numerous were the guests that also the Dining Room had to be used to cater for them all. Many of those seated here were members of the Danish Royal Court, Prince Waldemar’s Household and Officers in the Danish Royal Forces with Count Frijs, the Master of the Horse and the 2nd Court Marshal Chamberlain Juel presiding.\n\nMenu: Bouillon * Sole Filet Normande * Cutlet of Lamb * Charlotte Renaissance * Dessert\n\nThe wines were Rhine wine, red wine, champagne and Madeira.\n\nIt all sounds absolutely delicious but when reading the recipe perhaps the Charlotte Renaissance was the most spectacular dish of the lot:\n\nhttps://app.ckbk.com/recipe/esco04831c14s033ss004r010/charlotte-renaissance\n\nThe tables were beautifully decorated with pink roses and the old magnificent crystal used added to the glitter of the occasion.\n\nOutside a sea of people had gathered in the square and they were now demanding to see the newly-weds. Between two of the courses the Prince and Princess obliged the masses and came out on the balcony. They were met with great cheers and people were enthusiastically waving up to them. Their Royal Highnesses received all this goodwill with smiles and waves back at the crowd before going inside again to continue the meal.\n\nDuring the luncheon music were played and only Danish and French melodies had been selected.\n\nOnce the meal ended the guests made their way down to the Garden Room while the band played the Champagne Gallop by Hans Christian Lumbye. Coffee was then served, which the Royal guests took outside in the garden.\n\nIt was getting late and the time had to come for the newly-weds to take their leave. They would not attend the dinner hosted in the evening by Her Majesty the Queen Dowager as had been previously planned. The parting with the family members she would not see for some time was understandably very emotional with both laughter and tears.\n\nThen Princess Margrethe’s car appeared by the garden gates splendidly decorated with flowers and with the popular Royal chauffeur Jørgensen at the wheel. Appeared did also some Royal servants with large silver terrines filled to the brim with raw rice. The Royal guests eagerly grabbed a few handfuls each and threw it heartily at the Prince and Princess who made for the car. According to one report, as the Royal car headed away from them, Prince Aage cried out to the rest of the guests: “after them!” And the younger generation with the King and Queen at the head started running after the car as it headed towards the Palace gates. Then somebody cried out “slipper! Where is the slipper?” Apparently it was a reference to the old tradition of tying old shoes to the wedding vehicle. No sooner had the words been spoken then Prince Axel resolutely takes off one of his shoes and throws it towards the wedding car.\n\nOnce the car had made it through the Palace gates it was still showered, but this time with flowers which people in the crowd threw at them. While the bridal car continued the processional route part of the Royal guests made their way to Prince Waldemar’s Bernsdorff where they would receive the newly declared man and wife."
