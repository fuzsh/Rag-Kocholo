        "text": "Anne-Marie-Louise d’Orléans, duchess de Montpensier (born May 29, 1627, Paris, France—died April 5, 1693, Paris) was a princess of the royal house of France, prominent during the Fronde and the minority of Louis XIV. She was known as Mademoiselle because her father, Gaston de France, Duke d’Orléans and uncle of Louis XIV, had the designation of Monsieur. From her mother, Marie de Bourbon-Montpensier, she inherited a huge fortune, including Eu and Dombes as well as Montpensier.\n\nTall and with a noble bearing, Montpensier set her heart on an exalted marriage, but the government would neither promise her the future Louis XIV in 1638 nor make a premature peace with the Habsburg powers in time for her to marry the Holy Roman emperor Ferdinand III in 1647. In 1651, during the first exile of the cardinal and statesman Jules Mazarin, Montpensier pulled her father along the path of collaboration with Louis II de Bourbon, Prince de Condé, in the revolts known as the Fronde.\n\nIn the third war of the Fronde, which Condé launched against the royal government, she took command of the troops that occupied Orléans on March 27, 1652, against token opposition. She saved Condé’s army from annihilation in the Battle of the Faubourg Saint-Antoine (July 2, 1652) by ordering the cannon of the Bastille to be fired against the royal troops. On Louis XIV’s return to Paris (October 1652), Montpensier went into exile until 1657. She was again exiled from court from 1662 to 1664 for refusing to marry Afonso VI of Portugal."
