        "text": "1 Prepared\n\nThis flat wood, covered with its squares of gold,\n\nThrough which my blurred reflection comes and goes,\n\nWill one day hold my image; it will hold\n\nThe face I cannot see up to the world.\n\nFor now, it keeps its secret, only shows\n\nAcross its bright gold-leaf some scars and flaws\n\nAnd one thin streak of red, an open wound,\n\nFrom which I’m told my portrait will emerge.\n\nTill then this waiting space will hold its charge;\n\nThe strong potential of its golden ground,\n\nA light behind my back, before my mind,\n\nA blaze beneath the sill of what I am,\n\nThat tells me I am always on the verge,\n\nOf something that I haven’t yet become.\n\n2 Abraded\n\nBruce Herman takes a sander to the gold\n\nTo shape my likeness in the clay and dust\n\nHis hands are bleeding as he takes a hold\n\nOf this abrasion, for he knows he must\n\nUnmake the thing he’s made to make it better.\n\nHe opens out and flays the gold and clay\n\nUnveiling shapes and painting with the sander,\n\nI see my face half-formed, and look away.\n\nHe takes me back to all that grinds me down\n\nStrips my defenses, leaving me exposed,\n\nI flinch back from the form he has disclosed\n\nAs though I had been opened to the bone\n\nHe is not finished. Now he paints through pain\n\nThe subtle strokes that make me whole again.\n\n3 Finished\n\nFor I am incomplete, my mirrors show\n\nNo more than flaws and fragments as they pass,\n\nThe selves I lose, that mock me as they go,\n\nAnd leave me trembling by the darkened glass.\n\nI do not see the face that once I had\n\nNor can I see the one I will become,\n\nFlitting between a shadow and a shade\n\nI was, I was, I whisper, not I Am."
