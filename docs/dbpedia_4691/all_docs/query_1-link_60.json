        "text": "The spirit of Mary\n\nBy Karen Lindell\n\nThe exhibit, featuring Bruce Herman’s paintings of the Virgin Mary, is on display through Feb. 6 in the Reynolds Gallery at Westmont College in Santa Barbara.\n\nThe gallery is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Mondays through Fridays and 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Saturdays. The campus is at 955 La Paz Road (off the Olive Mill exit from Highway 101, about 26 miles from Ventura).\n\nFor more information, or directions to the college, visit http://www.westmont.edu. Herman’s Web site is http://www.bruceherman.com.\n\nA small-town girl about 14 years old is confronted by an ethereal guy who appears out of nowhere to deliver a bombshell: Despite her virginal status, he says, she’s going to be pregnant with a child who will be, literally, the son of a god.\n\nInstead of gasping, freaking out or questioning her sanity, she ponders the news and says, “OK.”\n\nMeet Mary.\n\nYes, that Mary — Jesus’ mom.\n\n“The first thing I learned about Mary is that she was strong, and contemplative,” said artist Bruce Herman.\n\nWhen the angel Gabriel shows up in Nazareth to tell Mary she is the “favored one” who will deliver God’s son — called the Annunciation in Christian theology — she is troubled but doesn’t fall apart, and “ponders in her heart what she is told,” Herman said, marveling at a teenager’s willingness to take a risk, and her capacity for acceptance and introspection.\n\nThat revelation was part of Herman’s journey to paint this complex girl-woman he knew of, but didn’t really know.\n\nHerman’s paintings of the Virgin Mary, including a triptych with a panel titled “Annunciation” that shows Mary’s encounter with Gabriel, are on display through Feb. 6 at Westmont College in Santa Barbara.\n\nHerman, who lives in Gloucester, Mass., is the Lothlorien Distinguished Chair in the Fine Arts at Gordon College, a Christian school in Wenham, Mass. His work has been featured internationally in solo and group exhibitions and is part of private and public collections, including the Hammer Museum at UCLA and the Vatican Museum of Modern Religious Art in Rome.\n\nThe Westmont College exhibit, titled “Miriam — Virgin Mother” (Miriam is the Hebrew name for Mary), includes two large triptychs that portray Mary at significant moments in her life, plus four related paintings by Herman featuring women.\n\nThe paintings look familiar yet unconventional.\n\nArtistic renderings of Mary “are popular devotional images,” said Herman. “For me, as a contemporary artist, those images seem to be sentimental. They don’t have a lot of creative energy; they’re predictable, kitschy.”\n\nConsider, for example, the recent popular painting of actress Angelina Jolie as the Virgin Mary, or the odd adoration of likenesses of Mary in a grilled cheese sandwich or pretzel.\n\nTypical devotional paintings of Mary show her smiling demurely, with porcelain skin and perfect eyebrows. A halo surrounds her. Sometimes she wears a crown, at other times a blue or white hood. She’s often clutching an abnormally large and angelic baby Jesus, and is a sure-fire win for Virtuous Mother of the Millennia.\n\nHerman, however, said he “wanted to get into the heart of the Virgin Mary and look at her in a fresher, truer way.”\n\nStriving to relate\n\nHerman, who in his searching and cynical young-adult years turned to Eastern mysticism, has converted to Christianity.\n\nAs he began painting the Virgin Mary series, he was working simultaneously on a series of paintings of women.\n\n“I got some insight into Mary thinking about women I know,” Herman said. “I was really looking at my wife and daughter, trying to understand them and honor them and, as a man, trying to empathize.”\n\nPlenty of famous and not-so-famous artists over the centuries have painted scenes of the Annunciation and other Marian moments. Herman wanted to honor the sacred tradition but also make it contemporary, without resorting to the ambiguity, satire or irony that characterizes religious imagery in modern art.\n\n“As a painter of religious images in postmodern times, I personally feel a bit like a caveman in the shopping mall,” Herman said in a 2003 lecture.\n\nThe evolution of tradition\n\nIn many ways, Herman said, his paintings “deal with traditional subjects. But I believe tradition is developing, unfolding. People who are traditionalists say you have to go back to the past, but I don’t believe that. Tradition is alive and changing right before us.”\n\nSo even his “traditional” paintings are forward-looking. Gordon College professor John Skillen, writing in the preface to an exhibit of Herman’s work in 2005 at the Palazzo dei Sette in Italy, said that “even viewers who share belief in the significance of his religious themes and titles and allusions can be put off by their unconventional configuration and their complex overlapping of abstraction and figuration.”\n\nHerman’s “Miriam, Virgin Mother: Via Activa” triptych mentioned above, for example, features two familiar Marian biblical scenes: “Annunciation” on the right and “Visitation” — Mary greeting her cousin Elizabeth, pregnant with John the Baptist — on the left.\n\nIn “Annunciation,” Herman’s angel Gabriel doesn’t sport wings, but does transmit his otherworld origins with fiery blue hair and an arm that seems to be dematerializing. Mary, meanwhile, is haloless and, instead of kneeling prostrate in sheer fear or awe, touches her heart, Herman said, as if to say, “Yes, even though I’m a virgin, I’ll think about this.”\n\n‘Overshadowed’\n\nThe middle painting in the triptych is the most nontraditional, Herman said.\n\nTitled “Overshadowed,” it shows Mary when she is “impregnated” by the Holy Spirit as Gabriel tells her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.”\n\nWhile researching traditional images of Mary for the series, Herman said he could not find a depiction of this particular moment.\n\n“She’s way below eye level,” Herman said, describing his image of Mary in a twisted position on the ground. “She’s overshadowed, but there’s no shadow — she’s surrounded by gold leaf and light, the presence of God.”\n\nAll hail Mary, because we are full of grace, too.\n\n“The angel Gabriel came to Mary and said, ‘Hail, highly favored one, the Lord is with thee,’” Herman said. “I think the real message of the Gospel — and this is the surprising thing that came to me with these paintings — is ‘Hail, highly favored one, God is with you.’ We are in solidarity with Mary, invited to carry God into the world. Ordinary people are invited to be sons and daughters of God. God loves us and wants us to be his family. We don’t have to be anyone important. We just have to show up and say yes.”"
