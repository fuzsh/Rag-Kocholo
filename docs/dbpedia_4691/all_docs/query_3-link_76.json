        "text": "Saw Herman's Hermits tonight at the local casino. Yeah, that's right. Herman's Hermits. image removed\n\nPeter Noone has still got the pipes at 68 years old. And the guy is a RIOT. Had me crackin' up all night. Did a great impersonation of Mick Jagger, and the band was really tight.\n\nHe started the show with \"I'm Into Something Good\", and finished the night with \"Henry the Eighth\".\n\nWhat a fun night!\n\nAn era that has long passed us by, but songs that are as enjoyable to listen to today as they ever were: No Milk Today, I'm Into Something Good, A Kind of Hush, Listen People, This Door Swings Both Ways, Just A Little Bit Better, End of the World, etc.\n\nThere was quite a legal battle over who would get to use the name \"Herman's Hermits.\" Peter Noone gets to use it in the U.S. but Barry Whitwam, the original drummer gets to use it in the old world.\n\nSo good to hear these guys are still at it. I loved them when I was a kid, but I haven't even thought about them in years.\n\nI used to play with a friend in the mid-late 90s. We used to cover Guitar Man by Bread. Whenever we played it he remembered that he had seen one of the Herman's Hermits (possibly Peter Noone - I cannot remember) play a regular gig on his own at a restaurant. We always found the idea depressing. So, it is good to hear they are playing proper gigs now.\n\nThe very first album I ever bought was Herman Hermits on Tour ... I was embarrassed by that for a few years back then...\n\nThe second album was the \"The Best of the Animals\".\n\nAnd the third was High Tide and Green Grass by the Stones.... How many here will admit they had a pair of Beatle Boots...\n\n.....and the fourth was Over under sides ways down..... I never considered the Stones or Yardbirds at that time -1965-67 as real \"blues\"... well er, because I wouldn't have know better at the time anyway. It took a while to figure out all the details and realize there was music and stuff beyond AM KHJ Boss Radio ..... and then I started to not being able to not be distracted by all them girls...as the hormone pump kicked in...\n\nThe first blues worthy album I ever bought was \" Hooker and Heat \"\n\nGlad you guys got to Peter Noone and company live...\n\nI saw Herman's Hermits first USA tour wayyyy back in the 60's. Also The Yardbirds, the Animals, The Who, all of the British Invasion Bands. I played guitar in garage bands back then from Jr. High on. I thought they were all really great. Going to see bands touring and playing music gigs whenever we could was what I lived for. And yes we wore Beatle Boots! We were as Ringo would say \"Mockers\" Mods and Rockers.\n\nI like there rendition of Silhouettes on the Shade. It was originally done by a couple other groups Hermans Hermets probably did it best. I like a lot of there song I'm into something good is a great song. It seems kind of beach boysish to me and I allways think of the movie Naked Gun when I here it.\n\nI like there rendition of Silhouettes on the Shade.

It seems kind of beach boysish to me and I allways think of the movie Naked Gun when I here it.\n\nIf memory serves me correctly, the original version of Silhouttes was by the Rays. My experience is that covers are rarely as good as the originals. However, the Herman's Hermits version was pretty good.\n\nFrom reading all of these posts, I'd be curious to see what people consider to be the best Herman's Hermits song of them all. There are quite a few to choose from. Perhaps a poll would be in order? That we are still talking about the band and the songs 50 years later is a testament to how good they all were.\n\nThe older generation really had a problem with the youth movement of the 60s. There's the time the Stones were introduced by Dean Martin, who said they had small foreheads, and made other allusions to their appearance.\n\nHere's Danny Kaye introducing Peter Noone at 1:30. He couldn't be more condescending and mocking, especially when he combs his hair forward and mimics him."
