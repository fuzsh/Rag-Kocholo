        "text": "June 9, 1948 – April 13, 2023\n\nCheryl Ann Powers was born in Grand Island, Nebraska and attend Grand Island Senior High. She married Bruce Herman on July 27, 1968, in Grand Island, Nebraska. She was a proud graduate of the University of Nebraska Lincoln in 1970, and began her career as a teacher in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nOnce Cheryl had her kids, she spent their first years at home making sure they had creative adventures, loved to learn, and became engaged in their communities. She later joined the Department of Labor where she worked for over 20 years before retiring in 2013.\n\nCheryl loved to travel and explore and was blessed to meet many fellow adventurers along her journey. She explored countless cities while traveling for work and even met some of her closest friends on those expeditions. Some of her favorite trips included her “winter times” in Isla Mujeres and Cozumel Mexico, and Palm Springs, California. She put her passport to use and loved her times in Ecuador, Peru, Germany, Austria, and the Netherlands. One of her most fun trips was a multi-stop tour with her friends of the Northeastern United States including Niagara Falls, Boston, New York City, and Maine. Some of her most meaningful adventures came with her mother exploring places like Yellowstone, Washington D.C., and her family’s beloved Sandhills in Nebraska.\n\nIn addition to staying busy, Cheryl loved to read and shared that joy with her children and grandchildren. She spent much of her time taking care of her family, and coveted the time each year when the entire family had their special summers together.\n\nCheryl also had a wonderful cadre of friends who she loved dearly. She remembered their birthdays, family milestones, special dates, and ways to make them laugh.\n\nCheryl was preceded in death by her mother, Dorothy Ann (Demaray) Powers, brother, Dean W. Powers, father, William D. Powers, and grandparents Elmer and Renna (Smithson) Demaray.\n\nCheryl is survived by her children, Anne E. Herman (Jeremy Vlcan) and Andrew A. Herman (Aura Paucar Herman); grandchildren: Natalia A. Herman, Cami D. Herman, and Aden I. A. Vlcan; family Ashley and Kate Baribeault – Vlcan, Pat & Bill Vlcan; dearest friends Chris, Jerry & Nancy E., Judy, Julie, Norm & Diana, Nancy C., and other loved ones.\n\nCELEBRATION OF LIFE: Thursday, May 11th at 11am at Mahoney State Park at the Riverview Lodge. A special lunch and reception will immediately follow the service. In lieu of flowers, memorials are suggested to the Foundation for Lincoln City Libraries, League of Women Voters of Lancaster-Lincoln, or Nebraska Appleseed in her name. Memorials can also be sent to the family who will be making decisions on additional memorials in the future when they carry out her wishes."
