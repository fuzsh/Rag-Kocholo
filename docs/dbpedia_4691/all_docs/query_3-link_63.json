        "text": "BORN 1956 Melbourne\n\nSTUDIES\n\nFine Art RMIT 19881 – 1984\n\nDiploma of Teaching University of Melbourne – 1989\n\nBackground\n\nBorn of Dutch parents he began painting at the early age of eight and held his first solo exhibition whilst still in his teens. He spent three years studying and painting in Amsterdam and London where he encountered the works of Constable, Turner and Rembrandt. This impressed him and influenced his own work. On returning to Melbourne he began studying for his fine arts degree. This brought him in close contact with some noted exponents of abstract and contemporary art in Australia, broadening his approached by focusing on the urban landscape and presenting it in a way unknown before. Three times winner of the coveted Camberwell Art Prize and twice winner of he Alice Bale award, this multi award-winning artist paints with an enthusiasm that is well recognized overseas as well as in Australia.\n\nApart from these notable prizes Herman has won approximately 90 major awards. In 1994 the National Taiwan art institute asked Herman to participate in a book and traveling exhibition with selected artists from Australia, USA and Taiwan. His works are featured in the books, ‘Australian Impressionist and Realist artists’, which was compiled by Tom Roberts; ‘120 Years of Watercolors’, by the Australian Realist Artists; ‘ Artists and Galleries of Australia and New Zealand’ by Max Germaine, and ‘Profile on contemporary Watercolors’. Herman’s works are represented in many private and corporate collections throughout Australia and overseas. Currently Herman holds sellout exhibitions annually in the USA.\n\nArtist Statement\n\n“I always had this conflict with myself thinking, ‘God, I’m only a traditional painter. It’s been done a hundred times before.’ And now I think, Well it has been done a hundred times before but if it has artistic integrity it doesn’t matter, and artistic integrity is something that’s very hard to explain. I don’t know how to put it, you see a painting and even though you know the subject and it’s been done a hundred times before, let’s say a plain old apple, it’s the way it’s painted, the feeling in the painting, the brush strokes, the paint quality, everything about it that sets it apart. Quite often modern work hits you with a bang but really it’s very shallow if it’s taken any further and quite often doesn’t stand the test of time.”\n\nEXHIBITIONS\n\n2012 Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery, Seaforth Australia (Group Show)\n\n2011 Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery, Seaforth Australia (Group Show)\n\n2010 Solander\n\n2010 Lindberg\n\n2010 Wollongong Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2010 Gosford Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2010 ‘Landscapes’, Group Show, Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery, Seaforth Australia\n\n2009 Lindberg Contemporary\n\n2009 Mosman Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2009 Bathurst Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2009 Castlemaine Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2008 Lindberg Contemporary\n\n2008 Caulfield Arts Complex, Group Show\n\n2006 Grafton Regional Gallery, Group Show\n\n2006 Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery, Seaforth Australia\n\n2006 Greenhill Gallery\n\n2006 Axia Modern Art\n\n2004 Mahonies Gallery\n\n2004 Trevor Victor Harvey Gallery, Seaforth Australia\n\n2003 David Sumner Gallery\n\n2002 Mahonies Gallery\n\n2002 Artarmon Gallery, Group Show\n\n2001 Mahonies Gallery\n\n1998 Delshan Gallery\n\n1994 Delshan Gallery\n\n1994 Taiwan National Gallery, Group Show\n\n1985 Von Bertoch Galleries\n\n1985 Gould Gallery, Group Show\n\n1983 Australian Galleries, Group Show\n\n1983 Pinacothica Galleries\n\n1979 Wiregrass Galleries\n\n1978 Wiregrass Galleries\n\n1974 Ordon Galleries\n\nAWARDS\n\n1995 Camberwell Rotary’s Gold Medal Watercolor Prize\n\n1993 Camberwell Rotary’s Gold Medal Watercolor Prize & Alice Bale Award\n\n1989 Camberwell Travel Grant and Rotary’s Gold Medal Watercolor Prize\n\n1989 Alice Bale Award\n\n1988 Wesley Art Judged by Director of the National Gallery\n\n1987 & 83 Mountbatten Award\n\nCOLLECTIONS\n\nArtbank\n\nEltham Shire Permanent Collection\n\nNational Leasing Collection-Canberra\n\nRoyal Overseas League-London\n\nSt. Kevin’s College-Toorak\n\nBOOKS & PUBLICATIONS"
