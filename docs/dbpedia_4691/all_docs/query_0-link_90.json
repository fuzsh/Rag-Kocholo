        "text": "Herman B. Pierce, born August 1933, was called home to glory Feb. 7, 2024.\n\nHe served his county for 22 years in the U.S. Air Force and decided retirement wasn’t for him and did another 20 years at the Denver, Colo., post office. He was an avid outdoors man, and hobbies included hunting and fishing. He decided it was time to retire and settled in Idaho 13 years ago, where he found pleasure in the wild animals that frequented his yard and enjoyed the company of family and friends.\n\nHerman is proudly survived by a lineage of love: his daughter Valerie and her husband, Mike; his son Eric, along with his wife, Brenda, and their son Brandon and wife Jessica, who have blessed him with great-grandchildren, Imogen and Dresden; daughters Sherry and Holly with her husband, Ron; and granddaughter Emma, the mother of great-grandchildren Jaelynn and Patryck.\n\nHis parents, A.L. and Sigrid Pierce; and brother, Art Pierce, preceded Herman in departing this earth but we know his family and loving wife, Barbara, met him with open arms in God's glory.\n\nWhile services will not be held you can honor his memory by making a contribution to a bassett hound or doberman Rescue.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to sign Herman’s online guest book at www.coffeltfuneral.com.\n\nArrangements are under the care of Coffelt Funeral Service."
