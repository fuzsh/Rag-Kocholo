        "text": "American actor (1906–2007)\n\nFor the American player of Canadian football, see Bruce Bennett (Canadian football). For the Australian academic, see Bruce Bennett (academic).\n\nBruce Bennett (born Harold Herman Brix, also credited Herman Brix; May 19, 1906 – February 24, 2007) was an American film and television actor who was a college athlete in football and in intercollegiate and international track-and-field competitions.[1] In 1928, he won the silver medal for the shot put at the Olympic Games in Amsterdam. Bennett's acting career in film and television spanned more than 40 years.\n\nEarly life and Olympics\n\n[edit]\n\nHarold Herman Brix was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington, where he attended Stadium High School from which he graduated in 1924.[2] He was the fourth of five children born to an immigrant couple from Germany.\n\nBennett played college football at the University of Washington, where he majored in economics. He played in the 1926 Rose Bowl and was a track-and-field star. Bennett won the Silver medal for the shot put in the 1928 Olympic Games.[3] He won four consecutive AAU shot put titles (1928–31), the NCAA title in 1927, and the AAU indoor titles in 1930 and 1932. In 1930, Bennett set a world indoor record at 15.61 m (51 ft 3 in). In 1932, he set his personal best at 16.07 m (52 ft 9 in), but failed at the Olympic trials to qualify for the Los Angeles Games.[4]\n\nEarly film career as Tarzan\n\n[edit]\n\nBennett moved to Los Angeles in 1929 after being invited to compete for the Los Angeles Athletic Club and befriended actor Douglas Fairbanks Jr., who arranged a screen test for him at Paramount.\n\nIn 1931, MGM, in adapting author Edgar Rice Burroughs's Tarzan adventures for the screen, selected Bennett to play the title character. Bennett broke his shoulder filming the 1931 football film Touchdown, so swimming champion Johnny Weissmuller replaced Bennett. Ashton Dearholt cast Bennett in the lead of a Tarzan serial film. The film began production on location in Guatemala.\n\nThe film, The New Adventures of Tarzan, was released in 1935 by Burroughs-Tarzan, and offered to theaters as a 12-chapter serial or a seven-reel feature. A second feature, Tarzan and the Green Goddess, was culled from the footage in 1938.\n\nBennett portrayed the titular hero in Republic's serial Hawk of the Wilderness.\n\nName change and film career\n\n[edit]\n\nBennett worked in serials and action features for low-budget studios until 1939. Finding himself typecast as Tarzan, Bennett changed his name and became a member of Columbia Pictures' stock company. He appeared in How High Is Up? with The Three Stooges and The Spook Speaks. His screen career was interrupted by World War II, when he served in the United States Navy.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1050s, Bennett appeared in Sahara (1943), Mildred Pierce (1945), Nora Prentiss (1947), Dark Passage (1947), The Man I Love (1947), The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948), Undertow (1949), Mystery Street (1950), Angels in the Outfield (1951), Sudden Fear (1952), and Strategic Air Command (1955), The Alligator People (1959).[5][3]\n\nIn 1954, Bennett played William Quantrill, the Confederate guerrilla figure, in an episode of the syndicated television series Stories of the Century. Bennett made five guest appearances on Perry Mason and five episodes of Science Fiction Theatre.\n\nBennett co-wrote and starred in Fiend of Dope Island (filmed 1959, released 1961).[5]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBennett had two children, Christopher and Christina, by wife Jeannette, who died in 2000. They named their children after his parents.\n\nBennett became a businessman during the 1960s. He pursued parasailing and skydiving. He last skydived at the age of 96, descending from an altitude of 10,000 feet near Lake Tahoe.\n\nBennett died at 100 on February 24, 2007 from complications from a broken hip.[6][7]\n\nSelected filmography\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of centenarians (actors, filmmakers and entertainers)\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nNotes\n\nBibliography\n\nChapman, Mike.
