        "text": "Dr. Bruce Hermann is a native of the Denton County area. He grew up in Lewisville and graduated from Liberty Christian School. He then attended Baylor University, where he studied biology, chemistry, and Spanish. After attending medical school at Texas Tech School of Medicine, Dr. Hermann was accepted to the prestigious general surgery program at the University of Louisville, where he trained under legends of the surgery world such as Hiram C. Polk and J. David Richardson.\n\nWhile at Louisville, Dr. Hermann found a love for the field of plastic surgery. Although plastic surgery fellowships had only a 30% acceptance rate, Dr. Hermann was accepted to one of his top choices at the University of Tennessee-Chattanooga plastic surgery program, which is directed by renowned craniofacial surgeon Larry A. Sargent. During his tenure there, Dr. Hermann received a comprehensive training experience in plastic surgery, but he developed a particular interest for the specialties of cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery.\n\nSeeking the best fellowship possible, Dr. Hermann was accepted to train under world-renowned cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgeon Dennis C. Hammond at the Center for Breast and Body Contouring in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Under Dr. Hammond’s tutelage, Dr. Hermann was educated in the most advanced techniques for cosmetic and reconstructive breast surgery.\n\nBecause of this excellent and extensive training, Dr. Hermann was recruited by numerous hospitals and physicians across the country from Florida to California and several places in between. But as many native Texans do, Dr. Hermann found himself missing the beautiful weather and friendly people of his home state, so he decided to bring his expertise in breast and plastic surgery back to the Denton County area where he grew up. Aside from his services in the field of plastic surgery, Dr. Hermann hopes to bring to the forefront of the community, education about breast cancer and your reconstruction options in the form of informative presentations.\n\nDr. Hermann currently lives in Argyle with his wife Cyndi, a physician at the University of North Texas Student Health Center, their son Major and daughter Danica. In Dr. Hermann’s leisure time, he enjoys coaching his son’s youth hockey team and playing hockey himself. He is an avid Dallas Stars fan. In the spring, he combines his love for speed with souped up cars and takes to the track for amateur drag racing."
