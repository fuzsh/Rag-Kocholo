        "text": "NEW YORK - Bruce G. Herman, a nationally recognized expert on worker training who fought to preserve New York City’s garment district and to revive manufacturing across the country, died Feb. 7 in Manhattan. He was 54.\n\nThe cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Jennifer.\n\nMr. Herman, a Brooklyn resident, devoted himself to saving and creating manufacturing jobs, whether as president of the Garment Industry Development Corp., a labor-management partnership, or as New York State’s deputy labor commissioner. He often testified before congressional and state legislative committees.\n\nAfter the World Trade Center was destroyed, he devoted himself to helping the families of the 79 workers who were killed at Windows on the World, the restaurant atop one of the towers, and to finding jobs for the 350 Windows workers who survived.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs a top official of the Center for Workforce and Economic Development, a New York nonprofit, he arranged the first grant to underwrite the Restaurant Opportunities Center, which helped unemployed restaurant workers find jobs after the Sept. 11 attack. He later lined up more than $500,000 in investment for Colors, an unusual cooperatively owned restaurant in Greenwich Village founded by former Windows on the World workers.\n\nBruce Gregory Herman was born in Lancaster, Pa., the son of Samuel and Arlene Herman. After graduating from Penn Manor High School, in Millersville, Pa., he attended Dickinson College, where he received a bachelor’s degree in political science. He obtained a master’s degree in political science at Columbia University.\n\nHe leaves his wife, Jennifer Kleinberg, whom he married in 1998; their three sons, Luke, Taylor, and Carter; his parents; two brothers, Michael and Steven; and two sisters, Sandra Herman and Christine Fisher.\n\nGet Globe Weather Forecast\n\nYour essential daily forecast, delivered daily at 6:30 am.\n\nEnter Email"
