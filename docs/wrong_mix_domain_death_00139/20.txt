T?or many generations the price of a book has been equated with the price of a good dinner, presumably somewhere between five and ten dollars today. But that generalization now has thousands of exceptions, for any of us can buy a really good book for the price of a hamburger at the corner drugstore. For in­stance, The Silent Service, Captain William C. Chambliss’ recounting of some of the great feats accomplished by U. S. Submarines in the Pacific in World War II, has just been published by Signet as an original (not a re­print), available for 35fS. And luncheon at Ye Olde Tea Roome costs more than Walter Millis’ first rate critique of warfare, Arms and Men (Mentor, 50^), or Michael Lewis’ The History of the British Navy (Penguin, 85fl), or Henry A. Kissinger’s Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (Anchor, 95^), or probably as much as that classic belonging in every naval officer’s library, Alfred Thayer Mahan’s The Influence of Seapower Upon History (Sagamore, $1.60). '

Anyone owning all of the paperbacks cur­rently in print would have a library of over 6,000 volumes. Several hundred of those would be mysteries, a similar number Westerns, and possibly even a greater number would fall into that category aptly described by mid­shipmen at the Naval Academy as “skin books.” Skimming off anything considered scum or froth would leave a truly great li­brary, including The Bible and Sophocles, Shakespeare and Dostoevski, Plato and Wil­liam James, Heisenberg’s Quantum Theory and Besicovitch’s Almost Periodic Functions, and Doughty’s Travels in Arabia Deserta and Keynes & Slichter’s The Means to Prosperity. For re­laxation you could sail in the USF United States with Herman Melville (White Jacket) or go around the world with Charles Darwin

as a guide (The Cruise of the Beagle). If you want to build a brick wall, improve your spin­casting, save money on your income tax, or understand the female sex, there’s a paperback that claims to tell you how.

Since paperbacks come and go so quickly at the corner store, it is impossible to keep track of them. That difficulty is almost solved by Paperbound Books in Print, published semi­annually by R. R. Bowker Company, 62 West 45th Street, New York 36, N. Y., and selling for two dollars a copy or three dollars for the year. Its 202 pages with titles from 125 paper­back series unfortunately do not include the leading British importer, Penguin Books, or the outstanding publisher of science and mathematics in paperbacks, Dover Publica­tions, or a few other houses. Bowker states clearly in a preface that a “nominal fee” is charged for each listing and that Penguin and Dover are among those not included. Even so, Bowker’s list is the best answer to the question of what is available. Where to obtain a particular paperback raises another ques­tion. The profit is so small on a single copy that the publishers cannot afford to handle single-copy retail sales by mail. It is better to order through a local outlet or through a national retailer such as Book Mail Service, Box 363, Jamaica, New York, which gives no discount but does pay postage on orders for five dollars’ worth of books or more.

Currently there is no checklist of paper­backs on warfare, such as might be of particu­lar interest to Naval Institute members. A careful comparing of available lists indicates that such a library now numbers over 150 volumes of generally good quality and great variety. Even the poorest book in the list be­low is worth the price of admission, and some titles should be on every officer’s must-read list. For instance, there is the late Theodor Plievier’s great trilogy of World War II on the Russian front, Moscow, Stalingrad, and Berlin (this last just published in paperback)— fiction to be sure, but like most of the fiction listed here, it is based on personal experience and the accounts of participants. No Amer­ican can have an understanding of World War II in Europe without realization of the tremendous debacle on the Eastern front, and Plievier’s three volumes will leave with most readers an indelible impression of no little value in assessing strength and weakness factors in today’s cold war.

Most paperbacks retailing at fifty cents or less must be inexpensively manufactured and enjoy large sales if their publishers are to stay in business. Consequently, some are worth shelf-space in a library and some are super­ficial, vulgar, sensational, and distinctly of ephemeral interest. Nonetheless, most of the titles listed here will make good shipboard companions and can be passed along or dis­carded without a sense of great loss. The paperbacks selling for about a dollar and up are frequently fine examples of the book­making art. In some instances, part of an edition is bound in boards, part in paper, and the difference in retail price is at least one dollar. For anyone who wishes to save his favorite or better paperbacks, a binding kit is now available. Whether paperbacks stimulate or reduce the sales of standard books has been hotly argued in the book trade without a con­vincing conclusion.

The following checklist is intended to be inclusive for paperbacks in print concerning military and naval events since 1939. The anthologies mentioned include a few World War I items. Mahan has been included, in­deed, but the temptation to list personal favorites—Thucydides, Xenophon, Caesar, and many American Civil War titles—has been resisted, with regret.

The Ships and Aircraft of the U. S. Fleet. Seventh Edition

By James C. Fahey. Falls Church: Ships

and Aircraft, 1958. 64 pages. Illustrated. $2.50.

REVIEWED BY

Captain Russell S. Crenshaw, Jr., USN

{Captain Crenshaw is serving in the G-3 Division,

U. S. Army Headquarters Europe, as an exchange officer.)

Fahey’s Seventh Edition is a mirror of our times. It is an inventory of our Navy in simple handbook form, but in the way the material is presented it speaks of the complexity and conflict inherent in the vast responsibility of theU. S. Navy.

The cover, dominated by the bulky form of a huge attack carrier and five flashy mem­bers of her brood, is symbolic of the place these ships and aircraft take in present Navy planning. Heaped into the inner pages are all of our ships and aircraft, both active and reserve; from a picket boat to the nuclear car­rier, they are all there. Guided missiles, battle­ships, blimps, helicopters, target drones, tug­boats, nuclear submarines, and supersonic jets all get equal space. On a single page a billion dollars worth of ships may compete for recognition. With as many as twenty photo­graphs per page and masses of tabulated characteristics, the little booklet bulges with information. By resorting to minute type, abbreviated expression, and coded symbols, Fahey has expanded the inside of this edition without enlarging the outside. It takes a bit of preparation to understand the symbols and it is frequently difficult to associate a particu­lar caption with the intended photograph, but the information is there. Fahey’s Seventh

is so complete that it is an essential piece of technical equipment for the naval planner or student.

As far a cry from the majestic pages of the annual edition of Jane’s Fighting Ships of the 1930s as are our atomic striking fleets from the stately lines of battleships, this little catalogue of “where we are now” merits care­ful study by anyone who wishes to really know our Navy. He will be astonished at the magnitude and variety of our naval force. Past, present, and future; it is all there. To be on the Navy List or to be in an authorized program are the only limiting criteria for en­trance to these crowded pages.

And there’s a lot of pleasant reminiscing for the older hands as they thumb the pages. Want to know what happened to Niblack, Alabama, Mingo, or Mount Olympus? They’re all listed. The status, dimensions, armament, power, complement, and much more is given for all major ships.

The familiar, brown-covered 1938 edition (reprinted in 1943) fell gradually from favor as it failed more and more to answer the modern navi­gator’s questions. It is predicted that this splendid new edition of H. O. Publication No. 9 will very soon resume its accustomed place as a book to be kept close at hand in mariners’ chart rooms and libraries the world over.

The new Bowditch is divided into a text of eight parts (Fundamentals, Piloting and Dead Reckoning, Electronic Navigation, Celestial Navigation, the Practice of Naviga­tion, Oceanography, Weather, and Produc­tion of Charts), twenty-nine appendices, thirty-four tables, and an index. Part Three, “Electronic Navigation,” includes a superior distillation of new developments and effec­tively summarizes all pertinent and unclassi­fied material. In consonance with the an­nounced intention to provide a reference book for navigators, several appendices ap­pear for the first time; a glossary, buoyage systems, chart symbols, a fascinating miscel­laneous data collection, and others.

The tables have been extensively revised. Some of the less commonly used ones have been deleted and much tabular material which formerly appeared in the text is now appropriately grouped with the other tables. Meteorological tables have been significantly augmented and improved, in the presentation of the traverse table. The text, appendices, and tables are excellently indexed in a com­mon index which occupies 68 pages.

Careful selection of paper and binding, extensive use of color, inclusion of new photo­graphs and plates, and expert editing and proof-reading, all combine to make the 1958 Bowditch an outstanding publication. It is readable, complete, and authoritative.

The Silent Victory*

REVIEWED BY

S.W. Jackman

{Dr. Jackman is an Assistant Professor of History at

Bales College and student of military history.)

This is an interesting book in that it sup­ports very clearly two theories. The first is that in spite of the advent of air power the basic concepts of Admiral Mahan still are true. Secondly, it underscores for World War II what historians have known was true for World War I; namely that the Germans de­spite developing a fine fleet in the technical sense simply did not acquire the skill and knowledge required to use it adequately. A corollary to the second theory is that the General Staff, and also in this case Hitler, simply refused to face with honesty unpleasant facts supplied to them by men trained in naval warfare.

Perhaps nothing was more amazing to the world than the extraordinary victories of Hitler. By July 1940, almost all of Europe was in his hands either directly or as allies, and only England stood against him. It seemed that the great question was not “if Hitler invades” but rather “when Hitler in­vades.” Yet this expected event simply did not transpire. Grinnell-Milne’s explanation for the change of plan is a simple one. He takes the point of view that Hitler did not attempt a Channel crossing because Raeder, who was aware of the British command of the sea, managed to persuade him to change his mind.

Directive 16, the order issued by Hitler in July 1940, definitely set forth the plan for invasion. This plan relegated the navy to a second place and ordered them to act as “engineers.” Instead, Hitler should have given the navy first place in the planning of the over-all operation. Consequently the di­rective set forth a project that was so fantastic that it could not but bring dismay to those who understood the sea and naval warfare. The army minds at headquarters and Hitler himself could not comprehend the fact that the Channel was not merely a rather wide river. In spite of the fantasy which enveloped army minds, Raeder, good officer that he was, attempted to comply with the requests made to him.

Raeder organized a great potential Chan­nel-crossing fleet, but to do it he had to disrupt the remaining German merchant marine. He managed to persuade the army to limit the area of initial attack and further he attempted to have the Luftwaffe’s power directed against “British bases in order to destroy ships under construction or repair,” rather than to con­centrate all power on the massive attacks on London.

Here it seems is the crux of the problem.

The Luftwaffe took the view that with the destruction of London would come the in­evitable capitulation of Britain. Perhaps the Luftwaffe felt that Operation Sea Lion was only academic and would never meet any opposi­tion because by then the force needed would be a token one only. Further, by then the navy need not fear British naval opposition since the latter would have already surrendered.

Actually the real question was whether air control could effectively limit naval action. Air control by land-based aircraft did not prevent the British navy from operating in the Mediterranean, even when almost all of the surrounding land mass was in Axis hands. Experiences of the U. S. Navy in the Pacific support the contention that air control alone does not mean victory. Raeder understood this and remembered Tirpitz’s views, “Against England the main front is the sea front.”

After much difficulty it is evident that Raeder managed to present the facts in such a way that even the most obtuse could not fail to grasp them. While the initial force might be successfully landed, the supply lines could not be guaranteed. The Germans did not have command of the sea.

The classic view of the period of the summer and early autumn of 1940 is that the RAF alone caused Hitler to abandon his invasion plans. The RAF was important, but it alone could not have been the sole deterrent. It was an aid and no more. Perhaps the thing which must be emphasized here is that in order to gain victory, mere control of land, sea, or air is not sufficient. Neither is mere co­operation. There must be sympathy and understanding between all the defense forces; England was fortunate in that her forces had this last qualification; the Germans did not.

While some of Grinnell-Milne’s generaliza­tions came from interpretation rather than fact, and it is to be regretted factual docu­mentary evidence was not made available to him; nevertheless, his conclusions are sound. He presents his case for the navy adequately and succinctly, and his book is excellent read­ing. He has chosen his illustrations well. Any person remotely interested in the history of World War II, any person interested in the whole thesis of the role of sea power in his­tory, should find in this book both enjoyment and instruction.

The Art of Navigation in England in Elizabethan and Early Stuart Times

By D. W. Waters. New Haven: Yale Uni­versity Press, 1958. 696 pages. Illustrations and appendices. $12.50.

REVIEWED BY

Captain H. H. Shufeldt, USNR

(iCaptain Shufeldt, who has held several commands afloat, currently is engaged in navigation research and is the author of articles on celestial navigation.)

Under the early Tudors, English maritime commerce was chiefly concerned with the ex­port of wool to the Low Countries, French ports on the Channel and Bay of Biscay, and to northern Spain and Portugal. The ships returned with wines, fruit, and iron. There was also trade for fish with northwest Europe, and voyages were made as far afield as Ice­land. However, it was primarily a coasting trade, carried on in small single-masted vessels, generally under 100 tons displace­ment. For this voyaging, only a knowledge of piloting was required of shipmasters.

During the later years of the reign of Henry VIII, the demand in Europe for English wool began to decline, and, during the early part of Elizabeth I’s rule, it became evident that new markets, further afield, must be found if the English economy was to survive. For this, larger ships were required, capable of long ocean voyages, as well as skilled navigators, competent to sail them to their desired destinations.

Lieutenant Commander D. W. Waters, rn (Ret.), an Admiralty historian, has written a scholarly and fascinating account of how the latter need was met. Progress was rapid; the old instruments of Spanish and Portu­guese design were improved, and new ones were invented. The accuracy of the ephem- erides was increased, and navigational texts, written by Englishmen, began to replace Spanish translations. For navigation in high latitudes, the circumpolar chart replaced the old “plane chart.” Progress indeed was rapid; by the time of the Spanish Armada, the Venetian ambassador to France described the English as having “the reputation of be­ing, above all Western nations, expert and active in all naval operations, and great sea dogs.”

During the sixteenth century, great ad­vances also were made in mathematics, due in large part to the demand for continuing improvement in navigation. Edward Wright calculated his table of meridional parts, and thus was able to make available the mercator projection chart. Before the close of the cen­tury, Napier had invented logarithms. Sur­prisingly, in a short span of years, a consider­able number of mariners adopted them; this in a country where mathematics shortly be­fore had been almost entirely ignored.

At the beginning of the comparatively brief period covered in this work, it was neces­sary for the pilot to have passed a long ap­prenticeship at sea. At the end, navigation had been reduced to a science, and a compe­tent navigator could be trained in months by means of available texts. Usually he knew his latitude with considerable accuracy, and could make his landfall successfully by run­ning down the easting or westing. Only his longitude eluded him. The accurate deter­mination of longitude had to await John Harrison and his chronometer in the next century.

In the Foreword, Admiral of the Fleet the Earl Mountbatten of Burma points out that the advent of the Atomic Age provides the contemporary navigator and scientists with comparable challenges to those the Eliza­bethans faced.

Ship Salvage

By Captain G. J. Wheeler, London: George Philip and Son, Limited, 1958. Illustrated. 154 pages. 15 shillings.

REVIEWED BY

Rear Admiral William A. Sullivan, USN (Ret.)

(Rear Admiral Sullivan has had a long and dis­tinguished career in ship salvage, including service as Chief of Navy Salvage. He is President of the Sullivan Engineering Company and Chairman of Ishikawajima Foster Wheeler Company of Japan.)

Ship Salvage describes a number of salvage operations undertaken by the Royal Navy in World Wars I and II. Captain Wheeler was a senior member of the Admiralty salvage de­partment and at a critical moment in World War II Mediterranean naval operations took command of Britain’s salvage units in that area. Rear Admiral Dewar, who prepared the foreword, was the head of the Admiralty salvage department in World War II, a chal­lenge initially very difficult, but which he eventually overcame by developing a large and efficient organization.

This book has definite limitations. Unless the reader already has an extensive knowledge of salvage requirements, Ship Salvage will pro­vide only a superficial knowledge of the broad as well as particular problems in this field. Desmond Young’s Ships Ashore, pub­lished after World War I and now out of print, remains recommended reading for sea­going officers seeking accurate and detailed information on salvage work.

REVIEWED BY

William Bell Clark

(Mr. Clark, is the editor of the Navy Department's projected Documentary Naval and Maritime History of the American Revolution.)

The American Revolution in more than 600 pictures, mostly contemporary and many in full color, together with a sprightly text of the military, economic, diplomatic, and leg­islative history of the period, gives this volume an appeal no bibliophile will be able to resist. The format is ideal for the large and impres­sive reproductions of some of the outstanding historical paintings of Copley, Stuart, West, and Trumbull. Another attractive feature is the wide outside margin of the printed page, permitting the use of interesting vignettes— woodcuts, portraits, maps, and excerpts from the rebel press—to illustrate the narrative.

The arrangement is chronological with major pictures concentrated at the conclusion of each of the fourteen chapters of the ever familiar and well-told tale. There is one

exception; the complete absence of text to the chapter headed “The War at Sea.” In­stead there are twenty pages of illustrations, with numerous lengthy captions, some of them inaccurate and misleading. Naval men will raise eyebrows to learn that John Paul Jones “began his career in the 18-gun Ranger”; the editor thus omits his earlier exploits in the Providence and Alfred in 1776. Connecticut readers will not be happy to read that its navy was devoted “to procure sulphur from the West Indies.” Pennsylvanians will resent the absence of any reference to the Continental and State navies in the defense of the Dela­ware in the Fall of 1777. Strategists, who un­derstand the tactics necessary when naval strength is about twenty to one, will be amused by the conclusion that Continental naval captains were driven to become commerce raiders. Captain David McCullough would turn over in his grave to read that his famous privateer Rattlesnake cruised in the Baltic, when his and her reputation was made in the West Indies.

Battleship “Scharnhorst”**

By Albert Vulliez and Jacques Mordal. Fair Lawn, New Jersey: Essential Books, 1958. 256 pages. Charts, illustrations, in­dex. $6.00.

REVIEWED BY

Captain Roland E. Krause, USN (Ret.)

(Captain Krause has had duly in Germany on several occasions between 1938-1947, and has done extensive research in German naval history.)

This book presents a significant and interest­ing account of the German battleship Scharn- horst’s career, ably written by two French naval officers.

After completing her trials in the Baltic at the beginning of World War II, the Scharn­horst participated in a sortie to the Iceland-

Faroes narrows in which the British auxiliary cruiser Rawalpindi was sunk. In the course of the Norwegian campaign, she took part in two extended cruises and in the sinking of the British aircraft carrier Glorious.

During January-March, 1941, the Scharn­horst and her sister ship, the Gneisenau, con­ducted an extended commerce-destroying raid in the Atlantic. When the ships had broken through the Greenland-Iceland nar­rows, Admiral Leutjens, in command, is re­ported to have said that it was the first time in their history that German surface warships had succeeded in breaking through the British blockade. This is not strictly true, but it was the first time that a German battleship or squadron had broken through. This cruise was successful since much shipping was sunk, and, considering missed opportunities, the prospect for such employment seemed bright. In reality, it was the beginning of a decline; British air attacks rendered Brest and other French bases precarious refuge for German naval forces.

For almost a year the Scharnhorst was out of operations at Brest and La Pallice, under­going repairs and trials. In July, 1941, when she was about ready for service, she was struck by five bombs. The account of condi­tions at Brest will be read with added interest because Vulliez is considered an authority on this subject.

The decline had begun for the Scharnhorst. In February, 1942, she participated in the Channel break-through, suffering two mine hits. Early in 1943 she was again ready for service and was transferred to northern Nor­way. Little was accomplished there although the mere presence of German naval forces had a disturbing effect on the convoys to Russia. Finally, on December 26, 1943, the Scharnhorst was trapped by superior British forces and went down fighting in the North Cape action.
