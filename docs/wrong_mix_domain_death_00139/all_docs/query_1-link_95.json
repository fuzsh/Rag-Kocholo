        "text": "Orthotopic neobladder reconstrution: postoperative CT appearance, complications and potential pitfalls\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLee, Su Lim; Jung, Seung Eun; Im, Yeon Soo; Lee, Jae Mun; Lee, Ji Youl; Yoon, Moon Soo; Hahn, Seong Tai [The Catholic University of Korea College of Medicine, Seoul (Korea, Republic of)\n\n2003-08-01\n\nTo evaluate the postoperative CT appearance, complications and potential pitfalls of radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction. We examined 46 patients [43 men and 3 women aged 34-72 (mean, 56.7) years] who had undergone neobladder reconstruction (ileocolic neobladder in 25 patients and ileal-W neobladder in 21). The CT scans were assessed in terms of their depiction of normal anatomy, namely the shape, location and internal architecture of the neobladder, the location of bladder bases, and the ureteral course. Early and late complications were also assessed. The characteristics of ileocolic neobadder were a right-side location, a lobulated outer margin, interal projections due to haustra or plication, a base in the retropubis, and right-side insertion of both ureters. In contrast, the characteristics of an ileal-W neobladder were a central location, an ovoid shape, nodular thickening at the ureteral insertion site, internal projections due to plication, and a retropubic bladder base. Early complications included hematoma with abscess formation (n=2), and postoperative peritonitis (n=1), while late complications were hydronephrosis due to stricture ar the ureteral anastomotic site (n=16), tumor recurrence at this site (n=1), distal ureteral stone (n=1), mucus urinary retention (n=1), incisional hernia (n=2), tumor recurrence in the pelvic side wall (n=1), carcinomatosis peritonei (n=1), and liver metastasis (n=2). A knowledge of normal anatomic changes is essential for the accurate interpretation of CT scans. CT is a useful modality of the evaluation of postoperative change and the complications occurring in patients who have undergone radial cystectomy with othotopic neobladder reconstruction.\n\nPreperitoneal placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir for postoperative erectile dysfunction after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJung Kwon Kim\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Purpose: To describe a case of safe placement of an inflatable penile prosthesis reservoir for postoperative erectile dysfunction (ED with a history of radical cystoprostatectomy with an orthotopic Studer neobladder. Materials and Methods: A 55-year-old bladder cancer patient, who underwent radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic Studer neobladder 2 years prior, suffered from postoperative ED. A 3-piece inflatable penile prosthesis was implanted via a penoscrotal incision. The alternative reservoir placement began with a longitudinal 4-cm incision, which was 2 finger-breaths to the left and lateral to the umbilicus. Thereafter, the anterior and posterior rectus sheaths were dissected and incised. Then, the transversalis fascia entering into the preperitoneal space was incised, followed by circumferential sweeping using the forefinger, and, finally, placement of a 100 mL âflatâ reservoir. The reservoir was filled with 65 mL saline and then evaluated for back pressure. The reservoir tubing exited through the defect of the rectus sheaths and tunneled through the abdominal fat into the penoscrotal wound. Results: Total operative time was 105 minutes, and the estimated blood loss was minimal. The patient was discharged at postoperative day 1 and experienced no perioperative complications. At the 6-month follow-up, there was no abdominal bulging from the preperitoneal reservoir, and the reservoir was not palpable. Conclusions: The preperitoneal placement of the flat reservoir at the level of the umbilicus is a safe and acceptable surgical technique for postoperative ED after radical cystoprostatectomy with orthotopic neobladder.\n\nThe effect of N-acetyl-L-cysteine on the viscosity of ileal neobladder mucus.\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSchrier, B.P.; Lichtendonk, W.J.; Witjes, J.A.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nN-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) proved to be an effective mucolytic in pulmonary secretions. Our goal was to investigate the in vitro effect of NAC on viscosity of ileal neobladder mucus. The urine of a patient with an ileal neobladder was collected during the first 7 days postoperatively and stored in a\n\nPresence of transient hydronephrosis immediately after surgery has a limited influence on renal function 1Â year after ileal neobladder construction.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNarita, Takuma; Hatakeyama, Shingo; Koie, Takuya; Hosogoe, Shogo; Matsumoto, Teppei; Soma, Osamu; Yamamoto, Hayato; Yoneyama, Tohru; Tobisawa, Yuki; Yoneyama, Takahiro; Hashimoto, Yasuhiro; Ohyama, Chikara\n\n2017-08-31\n\nUrinary tract obstruction and postoperative hydronephrosis are risk factor for renal function deterioration after orthotopic ileal neobladder construction. However, reports of relationship between transient hydronephrosis and renal function are limited. We assess the influence of postoperative transient hydronephrosis on renal function in patients with orthotopic ileal neobladder construction. Between January 2006 and June 2013, we performed radical cystectomy in 164 patients, and 101 received orthotopic ileal neobladder construction. This study included data available from 64 patients with 128 renal units who were enrolled retrospectively. The hydronephrosis grade of each renal unit scored 0-4. The patients were divided into 4 groups according to the grade of hydronephrosis: control, low, intermediate, and high. The grade of postoperative hydronephrosis was compared with renal function 1Â month and 1Â year after surgery. There were no significant differences in renal function before surgery between groups. One month after surgery, the presence of hydronephrosis was significantly associated with decreased renal function. However, 1Â year after urinary diversion hydronephrosis grades were improved significantly, and renal function was comparable between groups. Postoperative hydronephrosis at 1Â month had no significant influence on renal function 1Â year after ileal neobladder construction. Limitations include retrospective design, short follow-up periods, and a sample composition. The presence of transient hydronephrosis immediately after surgery may have limited influence on renal function 1Â year after ileal neobladder construction.\n\nSexual Function after Non-Nerve-Sparing Radical Cystoprostatectomy: A Comparison between Ileal Conduit Urinary Diversion and Orthotopic Ileal Neobladder Substitution\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nM.A Asgari\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective To compare the erectile function (EF and sexual desire (SD in men after radical cystoprostatectomy (RCP who had either an ileal conduit urinary diversion or orthotropic ileal neobladder substitution. Materials and Methods Eighty one sexually active men with bladder cancer were enrolled in this prospective study. After RCP according to patients' preferences they underwent either ileal conduit urinary diversion (n = 41 or orthotropic ileal neobladder substitution (n = 40. EF and SD were assessed using International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF questionnaire. Patients were assessed at 4-week before surgery and were followed up at 1, 6, and 12-month postoperatively using the same questionnaire. Results Postoperatively the EF and SD domains deteriorated significantly in both groups, but in a small proportion of the patients submitted to ileal neobladder they gradually improved with time (P = 0.006. At 12-month postoperative period, 4 (9.8% and 14 (35.0% patients in ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups were able to achieve erections hard enough for vaginal penetration and maintained their erection to completion of intercourse, respectively (P = 0.006. Among patients in the ileal conduit and ileal neobladder groups, additional 4 (9.8% and 7 (17.1% patients were able to get some erection, but were unable to maintain their erection to completion of intercourse (P = 0.02. At 12-month follow up period 24.4% of the ileal conduit and 45.0% of the ileal neobladder patients rated their sexual desire very high or high (P = 0.01. Conclusion When performed properly, orthotopic ileal neobladder substitution after RCP offers better long-term results in terms of EF and SD.\n\nSuccessful Management of Neobladder Variceal Bleeding\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nAtwal, Dinesh; Chatterjee, Kshitij, E-mail: kchatterjee@uams.edu [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Residency Program: Slot 634 (United States); Osborne, Scott [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Division of Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology (United States); Kakkera, Krishna; Deas, Steven [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Residency Program: Slot 634 (United States); Li, Ruizong [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Division of Interventional Radiology, Department of Radiology (United States); Erbland, Marcia [University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Department of Internal Medicine, Residency Program: Slot 634 (United States)\n\n2016-10-15\n\nHematuria from a neobladder can occur due to a variety of pathologies including tumors, stones, and fistulas. Variceal bleeding in a neobladder is a very rare condition with only one case reported in literature. We present a case of a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension and an ileocolic orthotopic neobladder presenting with hematuria. Computed tomographic angiography showed dilated varices around the neobladder which were successfully embolized. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report case of variceal bleeding in a neobladder successfully managed with the combination of TIPS (transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) procedure and embolization.\n\nTubulovillous Adenoma in a Urethral Neobladder Anastomosis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBradley A. Morganstern\n\n2015-11-01\n\nFull Text Available We present a case of a tubulovillous adenoma arising in a neobladder that was managed by cystoscopic resection. A 64 year-old male underwent a cystectomy with creation of an ileocolic neobladder urinary diversion for T2 urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. Nine years following his surgery, the patient noted several episodes of gross hematuria. Cystoscopic evaluation revealed the rare occurrence of a 3Â cm tubulovillous adenoma with high-grade dysplasia at the neck of the neobladder.\n\nIntroduction of an enhanced recovery protocol to reduce short-term complications following radical cystectomy and intestinal urinary diversion with vescica ileale Padovana neobladder.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCerruto, Maria Angela; De Marco, Vincenzo; D'Elia, Carolina; Bizzotto, Leonardo; Curti, Pierpaolo; Baldassarre, Roberto; Artibani, Walter\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo reduce short-term complications of radical cystectomy (RC) and intestinal urinary diversion with vescica ileale Padovana (VIP) neobladder, we described and assessed an enhanced recovery protocol (ERP) in a series of consecutive patients. An ERP was introduced focusing on reduced bowel preparation, standardized feeding and analgesic regimens. We analyzed the outcomes with all patients consecutively undergoing RC and VIP neobladder who met the following inclusion criteria: American Society of Anesthesiologists score Short Form criteria; absence of inflammatory bowel diseases. Thirty-one consecutive patients were recruited to undergo our ERP. Mean age of patients was 62.16 years. No patients died due to surgical complications. Nine of 31 patients experienced complications (29.03%), none requiring surgical intervention. According to Clavien grading, all complications were grade <2. The application of our ERP to our patients undergoing RC and VIP neobladder contributed to reduce postoperative morbidity. Copyright Â© 2013 S.

This study investigated the incidence and implicated pathogen of febrile UTI after ileal neobladder reconstruction and identify clinical and urodynamic parameters associated with febrile UTI. From January 2001 to May 2015, 236 patients who underwent radical cystectomy and ileal neobladder were included in this study. Fifty-five episodes of febrile UTI were identified in 46 patients (19.4%). The probability of febrile UTI was 17.6% and 19.8% at 6 months and 24 months after surgery, respectively. While, Escherichia coli was the most common implicated pathogen (22/55, 40.0%), Enterococcus spp. were the most common pathogen during the first month after surgery (18/33, 54.5%). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, ureteral stricture was an independent risk factor associated with febrile UTI (OR 5.93, P = 0.023). However, ureteral stricture accounted for only 6 episodes (10.9%, 6/55) of febrile UTI. Most episodes of febrile UTI occurred within 6 months after surgery. Thus, to identify risk factors associated with febrile UTI in the initial postoperative period, we assessed videourodynamics within 6 months after surgery in 38 patients. On videourodyamic examination, vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) was identified in 16 patients (42.1%). The rate of VUR presence in patients who had febrile UTI was not significantly different from those in patients without febrile UTI (50% vs. 39.3%, P = 0.556). Patients with febrile UTI had significantly larger residual urine volume (212.0 Â± 193.7 vs. 90.5 Â± 148.2, P = 0.048) than those without. E. coli and Enterococcus spp. are common pathogens and ureteral stricture and residual urine are risk factors for UTI after ileal neobladder reconstruction.\n\nFurosemide urogram in patients with neobladder\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMerkle, E.M.; Aschoff, A.J.; Bachor, R.; Vogel, J.; Merk, J.; Brambs, H.J.\n\n1996-01-01\n\nPurpose: To differentiate between urodynamically relevant obstruction and functionally unimportant dilation of the upper urinary tract in patients with neobladder using a modified furosemide urogram. Method: An excretory urogram with furosemide loading was carried out in 19 patients with neobladder and sonographically and urographically confirmed dilation of the upper urinary tract. Once strong contrasting of the renal pelves and calyces has been achieved, 20 mg of furosemide were applied and late radiographs were obtained at 15 min and 30 min, respectively. An obstruction was defined as increasing dilation of the renal pelves and calices during forced diuresis and lack of washout effect of the contrast medium. Results: In 32 cases, the renoureteral unit (RUU) was dilated on ultrasound. Of these, 25 RUU's showed good emptyness of contrast medium upon stimulation of diuresis, six RUU's returned a borderline findings, while one RUU was found to exhibit a decompensated anastomotic stenosis, which was dilated. Two further patients with bordeline findings were later treated surgically due to their pain symptoms. No patient required further preoperative diagnostic procedures. Conclusions: The modified furosemide urogram represents a cost-effective diagnostic orientation strategy in patients with neobladder and dilated renal pelves and calyses and is both well-tolerated by patients and meets with broad acceptance from the urologic staff.

We report the case of a 61-year-old man with a muscle-invasive bladder tumor that was treated using radical cystectomy and the creation of a Studer's orthotopic neobladder. However, nine years after the cystectomy, we detected a mass at the left ureteroileal anastomosis. We successfully performed Studer's neobladder resection, urethrectomy, and left nephroureterectomy to remove the entire mass. Pathological examination revealed urothelial carcinoma with adenocarcinoma in the neobladder and adenocarcinomatous metastasis in the mesenteric lymph node.\n\nEndoscopic Treatment of Studer's Orthotopic Neobladder Lithiasis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDiogo Gil-Sousa\n\n2015-05-01\n\nFull Text Available Studer's neobladder lithiasis is a rare but important long term complication of this orthotopic bladder substitute technique. We report a case of a 45 year-old male patient, submitted to a radical cystoprostatectomy with a Studer's orthotopic neobladder 4 years before, presenting bad compliance to recommended urinary habits, increased production of mucus and high post voiding residue. CT scan and urethrocystography showed a distended pouch with 2 major sacculations with narrow communication and a stone in each sacculation. A minimally invasive endoscopic technique was successfully used in the treatment of the 2 small calculus.\n\nEvolution of robot-assisted orthotopic ileal neobladder formation: a step-by-step update to the University of Southern California (USC) technique.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChopra, Sameer; de Castro Abreu, Andre Luis; Berger, Andre K; Sehgal, Shuchi; Gill, Inderbir; Aron, Monish; Desai, Mihir M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nTo describe our, step-by-step, technique for robotic intracorporeal neobladder formation. The main surgical steps to forming the intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder are: isolation of 65 cm of small bowel; small bowel anastomosis; bowel detubularisation; suture of the posterior wall of the neobladder; neobladder-urethral anastomosis and cross folding of the pouch; and uretero-enteral anastomosis. Improvements have been made to these steps to enhance time efficiency without compromising neobladder configuration. Our technical improvements have resulted in an improvement in operative time from 450 to 360 min. We describe an updated step-by-step technique of robot-assisted intracorporeal orthotopic ileal neobladder formation.

This study included 51 patients, who underwent radical cystectomy with orthotopic neobladder reconstruction by a Hautmann ileal neobladder with chimney modification from 2006 to 2014. Functional outcomes were evaluated using a questionnaire and uroflowmetry. Perioperative complications were analyzed retrospectively. The mean follow-up period was 36.1 months. Eighty-six percent of patients voided without clean intermittent catheterization (CIC assistance. CIC was used 1-2x per day or every time they voided in 8% and 6% of patients, respectively, and 71% of patients were continent. The percentages of patients who used 1, 2, 3-4, and â¥5 pads per day were 15%, 6%, 2%, and 6%, respectively. Daytime and nighttime continence were achieved in 86% and 69% of patients, respectively. Daily mucus leakage was reported in 69% of patients. The mean maximum neobladder capacity, voided volume, postvoid residual volume, and maximum flow rate were 413.2âmL, 370.6âmL, 43.7âmL, and 20.8âmL/s, respectively. Eighteen early and 5 late complications developed in 13 and 5 patients, respectively. Reoperations were needed in 7 patients. The Hautmann ileal neobladder with chimney modification provided satisfactory results regarding functional outcomes.\n\nRobot-assisted radical cystectomy with intracorporeal neobladder diversion: The Karolinska experience.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nCollins, Justin W; Sooriakumaran, P; Sanchez-Salas, R; Ahonen, R; Nyberg, T; Wiklund, N P; Hosseini, A\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThe aim of this report is to describe our surgical technique of totally intracorporeal robotic assisted radical cystectomy (RARC) with neobladder formation. Between December 2003 and March 2013, a total of 147 patients (118 male, 29 female) underwent totally intracorporeal RARC for urinary bladder cancer. We also performed a systematic search of Medline, Embase and PubMed databases using the terms RARC, robotic cystectomy, robot-assisted, totally intracorporeal RARC, intracorporeal neobladder, intracorporeal urinary diversion, oncological outcomes, functional outcomes, and complication rates. The mean age of our patients was 64 years (range 37-87). On surgical pathology 47% had pT1 or less disease, 27% had pT2, 16% had pT3 and 10% had pT4. The mean number of lymph nodes removed was 21 (range 0-60). 24% of patients had lymph node positive dAQ1isease. Positive surgical margins occurred in 6 cases (4%). Mean follow-up was 31 months (range 4-115 months). Two patients (1.4%) died within 90 days of their operation. Using Kaplan-Meier analysis, overall survival and cancer specific survival at 60 months was 68% and 69.6%, respectively. 80 patients (54%) received a continent diversion with totally intracorporeal neobladder formation. In the neobladder subgroup median total operating time was 420 minutes (range 265-760). Daytime continence and satisfactory sexual function or potency at 12 months ranged between 70-90% in both men and women. Our experience with totally intracorporeal RARC demonstrates acceptable oncological and functional outcomes that suggest this is a viable alternative to open radical cystectomy.\n\nFunctional and Clinical Outcome of Ileal (Studer) Neo-bladder Reconstruction: Single Centre Experience from Pakistan\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNazim, S. M.; Ather, M. H.; Abbas, F.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nObjective: To determine the medium and long-term outcome of orthotopic continent urinary diversion with ileal (Studer) neo-bladder following radical cystectomy. Study Design: Case series. Place and Duration of Study: Department of Surgery, The Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi, from January 1998 to September 2010. Methodology: Thirty eight patients underwent radical cystectomy for invasive bladder tumor with ileal neo-bladder (Studer type) reconstruction. Peri-operative and late complications, functional outcome of neo-bladder, urinary continence, metabolic and upper urinary tract status and overall survival were evaluated in all patients. Results: A total of 29 patients (23 males and 6 females) with mean age of 59 +- 12 years were included for the final analysis. The mean duration of surgery (both radical cystectomy and urinary diversion) was 520 +- 70 minutes. Perioperative complication rate was 24% (n=7) with surgical site infection in 4 patients, sepsis in 1 patient and 2 had ureteroileal leak. At 6 months follow-up, 22 patients were fully continent while 7 patients had minimal stress / nocturnal incontinence. The continence rate was 93% (n=27) at one year follow-up. The mean capacity of neo-bladder at 6 months was 384 +- 66 mLs. The late complication rate was 17% (n=5). Three patients developed anastomotic stricture requiring transurethral incision of neo bladder neck, one formed stone in neo-bladder and one developed incision hernia. All patients had preserved renal functions on follow-up. The survival rate was 80% (n=23) at a median follow-up of 66.4 +- 36 months. Two patients developed local recurrence and four developed distant metastasis. Conclusion: Studer ileal neo-bladder is a safe and effective option for urinary diversion in select patients with good oncological and functional outcomes comparable to contemporary literature, even in a low volume center.

Patients and methods: This study included a total of 28 patients (25 males and three females) with muscle invasive bladder cancer and a solitary functioning kidney at the time of surgery who underwent radical cystectomy (anterior pelvic excentration for females) and urinary reconstruction using orthotopic neobladder at The National Cancer Institute, Cairo University between February 2004 and April 2009. The surgical procedures included ileocaecal neobladder in 19 patients, ileal neobladder (Studer) in five and sigmoid neobladder in four. All perioperative and long-term complications were recorded. The renal functions were evaluated using mainly serum creatinine level, abdominal ultrasonography and intravenous urography (IVU). Results: The mean age of patients was 51.4 years (range of 38-62 years) while the mean follow-up period was 41.4 months (range 18-62 months). Early complications included wound infections in five patients, urine leakage in six, abdominal dehiscence with deep venous thrombosis in two, intestinal obstruction and prolonged ileus in three. During the follow-up period, 21 renal units (75%) remained stable with normal serum creatinine level and normal radiological configuration of the kidney. The remaining seven patients (25%) developed varying degrees of renal deterioration either due to uretero-intestinal stricture in three patients (10.7%), who were all treated by open surgical revision of the anastomotic sites or due to stricture at the vesico-urethral anastomosis in four patients (14.3%) that had been successfully managed by endoscopic dilatation and internal ure-throtomy with stabilization of renal function. Severe metabolic acidosis occurred in one patient while mild forms occurred in three. These four patients required sodium bicarbonate therapy and\n\nPrognostic features for quality of life after radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexander Kretschmer\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACT Purpose: To analyse prognostic features on quality of life (QoL following radical cystectomy and urinary diversion via orthotopic neobladder in a single-centre patient cohort. Materials and Methods: Postoperative QoL of 152 patients was assessed retrospectively using the validated QLQ-C30 questionnaire. Potential associations of patient's quality of life including pre-and intraoperative characteristics, surgeon experience, postoperative time course, adjuvant therapies, and functional outcome were defined a priori and evaluated. Mann-Whitney-U-, Kruskal-Wallis-, Spearman correlation and post hoc-testing were used. A multivariate analysis using a multiple logistic regression model was performed. A p value 100 previous cystectomies, p=0.007, and nerve-sparing surgery (p=0.001. Patients who underwent secondary chemotherapy or radiotherapy had significant lower QLQ-C30 scores (p=0.04, p=0.02 respectively. Patients who were asymptomatic had a significantly higher quality of life (p<0.001. A significant impact of severity of incontinence based on ICIQ-SF score (p<0.001 and daily pad usage (p<0.001, existence of daytime incontinence (p<0.001, existence of urgency symptoms (p=0.007, and IIEF-5 score (p<0.001 could be observed. In multivariate analysis, independent prognostic relevance could be confirmed for preoperative ECOG performance status of 0 (p=0.020 vs. ECOG 1, p=0.047 vs. ECOG 2, experience of the respective surgeon (â¥100 vs. <100 previous cystectomies, p=0.021, and daytime continence (p=0.032. Conclusion: In the present study, we report health-related QoL outcomes in a contemporary patient cohort and confirm preoperative ECOG status, surgeon experience and daytime incontinence as independent prognostic features for a good postoperative QoL.\n\nRobot-Assisted Excision of a Pararectal Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumor in a Patient with Previous Ileal Neobladder\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nA. Ploumidis\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs are the most frequent mesenchymal tumors of the gastrointestinal tract with surgical resection remaining the cornerstone of therapy. Pararectal lesions are considered to be technically difficult and pose in some cases a challenge. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first robotic-assisted pararectal GIST excision. A 43-year-old man was referred to our center with pararectal GIST recurrence, despite treatment with targeted therapy. Eleven years ago, he underwent extensive abdominal surgery including cystoprostatectomy with ileal neobladder diversion due to GIST resection in the rectoprostatic space. Robot-assisted surgical resection was successfully performed without the need for temporary colostomy. The postoperative course of the patient was uneventful, and the pathology report confirmed a GIST recurrence with negative surgical margins and pelvic lymph nodes free of any tumor. Robotic-assisted pelvic surgery can be extended to incorporate excision of pararectal GISTs, as a safe, less invasive surgical alternative with promising oncological results and minimal injury to adjacent structures.\n\nDetour technique, Dipping technique, or IIeal bladder flap technique for surgical correction of uretero-ileal anastomotic stricture in orthotopic ileal neobladder\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMohamed Wishahi\n\n2015-08-01\n\nFull Text Available ABSTRACTBackground:Uretero-ileal anastomotic stricture (UIAS is a urological complication after ileal neobladder, the initial management being endourological intervention. If this fails or stricture recurs, surgical intervention will be indicated.Design and Participants:From 1994 to 2013, 129 patients were treated for UIAS after unsuccessful endourological intervention. Unilateral UIAS was present in 101 patients, and bilateral in 28 patients; total procedures were 157. The previous ileal neobladder techniques were Hautmann neobladder, detubularized U shape, or spherical shape neobladder.Surgical procedures:Dipping technique was performed in 74 UIAS. Detour technique was done in 60 renal units. Ileal Bladder flap was indicated in 23 renal units. Each procedure ended with insertion of double J, abdominal drain, and indwelling catheter.Results:Follow-up was done for 12 to 36 months. Patency of the anastomosis was found in 91.7 % of cases. Thirteen patients (8.3% underwent antegrade dilatation and insertion of double J.Conclusion:After endourological treatment for uretero-ileal anastomotic failure, basically three techniques may be indicated: dipping technique, detour technique, and ileal bladder flap. The indications are dependent on the length of the stenotic/dilated ureteral segment. Better results for long length of stenotic ureter are obtained with detour technique; for short length stenotic ureter dipping technique; when the stenotic segment is 5 cm or more with a short ureter, the ileal tube flap is indicated. The use of double J stent is mandatory in the majority of cases. Early intervention is the rule for protecting renal units from progressive loss of function.\n\nPerioperative and mid-term oncologic outcomes of robotic assisted radical cystectomy with totally intracorporeal neobladder: Results of a propensity score matched comparison with open cohort from a single-centre series.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSimone, Giuseppe; Tuderti, Gabriele; Misuraca, Leonardo; Anceschi, Umberto; Ferriero, Mariaconsiglia; Minisola, Francesco; Guaglianone, Salvatore; Gallucci, Michele\n\n2018-04-17\n\nIn this study, we compared perioperative and oncologic outcomes of patients treated with either open or robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal neobladder at a tertiary care center. The institutional prospective bladder cancer database was queried for \"cystectomy with curative intent\" and \"neobladder\". All patients underwent robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal neobladder or open radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder for high-grade non-muscle invasive bladder cancer or muscle invasive bladder cancer with a follow-up length â¥2 years were included. A 1:1 propensity score matching analysis was used. Kaplan-Meier method was performed to compare oncologic outcomes of selected cohorts. Survival rates were computed at 1,2,3 and 4 years after surgery and the log rank test was applied to assess statistical significance between the matched groups. Overall, 363 patients (299 open and 64 robotic) were included. Open radical cystectomy patients were more frequently male (pÂ =Â 0.08), with higher pT stages (pÂ =Â 0.003), lower incidence of urothelial histologies (pÂ =Â 0.05) and lesser adoption of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (open radical cystectomy cases (all pÂ â¥Â 0.22). Open cohort showed a higher rate of perioperative overall complications (91.3% vs 42.2%, pÂ 0.001). At Kaplan-Meier analysis robotic and open cohorts displayed comparable disease-free survival (log-rank pÂ =Â 0.746), cancer-specific survival (pÂ =Â 0.753) and overall-survival rates (pÂ =Â 0.909). Robot-assisted radical cystectomy and intracorporeal neobladder provides comparable oncologic outcomes of open radical cystectomy and orthotopic neobladder at intermediate term survival analysis.

Due to the retraction of the urethra and unfriendly pelvis, the process of taking satisfactory urethral sutures may be laborious. Here, we describe a simple method by which we could overcome similar technical problems during surgery using Foley catheter as the guide for the suture.\n\nFurosemide urogram in patients with neobladder; Das Diureseurogramm bei Patienten mit Harnblasenersatz\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMerkle, E.M.

Method: An excretory urogram with furosemide loading was carried out in 19 patients with neobladder and sonographically and urographically confirmed dilation of the upper urinary tract. Once strong contrasting of the renal pelves and calyces has been achieved, 20 mg of furosemide were applied and late radiographs were obtained at 15 min and 30 min, respectively. An obstruction was defined as increasing dilation of the renal pelves and calices during forced diuresis and lack of washout effect of the contrast medium. Results: In 32 cases, the renoureteral unit (RUU) was dilated on ultrasound. Of these, 25 RUU`s showed good emptyness of contrast medium upon stimulation of diuresis, six RUU`s returned a borderline findings, while one RUU was found to exhibit a decompensated anastomotic stenosis, which was dilated. Two further patients with bordeline findings were later treated surgically due to their pain symptoms. No patient required further preoperative diagnostic procedures. Conclusions: The modified furosemide urogram represents a cost-effective diagnostic orientation strategy in patients with neobladder and dilated renal pelves and calyses and is both well-tolerated by patients and meets with broad acceptance from the urologic staff.

A total of 12 patients (median age at recurrence: 60 years) who experienced UR after RC with an orthotopic neobladder were selected for this study from a cohort of 456 women from participating institutions. The primary clinical and pathological characteristics at RC, including the manifestation of the UR and its treatment and outcome, were reviewed. The primary bladder tumors in the 12 patients were urothelial carcinoma in 8 patients, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma in 1 patient each, and mixed histology in 2 patients. Three patients (25%) had lymph node-positive disease at RC. The median time from RC to the detection of UR was 8 months (range 4-55). Eight recurrences manifested with clinical symptoms and 4 were detected during follow-up or during a diagnostic work-up for clinical symptoms caused by distant metastases. Treatment modalities were surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and bacillus Calmette-GuÃ©rin urethral instillations. Nine patients died of cancer. The median survival after the diagnosis of UR was 6 months. UR after RC with an orthotopic neobladder in females is rare. Solitary, noninvasive recurrences have a favorable prognosis when detected early. Invasive recurrences are often associated with local and distant metastases and have a poor prognosis. Â© 2014 S.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Evaluate literature predominantly from the last decade dealing with long-term experience in large numbers of patients with an orthotopic neobladder following cystectomy. Oncological outcome specific to an orthotopic neobladder, functional aspects such as urinary continence, renal function, sexual activity and other quality of life issues are elucidated. RESULTS: Local pelvic recurrences after urothelial bladder cancer occur in 7-12%. Urethral second primary tumors in male and female patients in contemporary series with bladder substitution are 4-6% and 1.4 o 4%, respectively. Upper tract recurrences vary between 2.4-17%. Complications regarding the upper urinary tract have dramatically diminished due to simplified forms of upper tract protection as well as a more refined technique of ureterointestinal anastomosis. Depending on the technique ureteroileal stenosis was lately reported to lie between 2.7 to 3.8%. Renal function remained stable in 96% after a mean follow-up of up to 5 years. Radical cystectomy in carefully selected patients has stood the test of time by providing adequate long-term survival and low local recurrence rates. Orthotopic bladder substitution does not compromise oncological outcome, yields excellent functional results, is cost effective compared to other types of urinary diversion, may improve quality of life and should therefore be the diversion of choice both in men and women. Chronological age is generally not a contraindication for cystectomy, but for orthotopic urinary diversion, tumor extent, functional pelvic floor deficits and general life expectancy are limiting factors.\n\nLaparoscopic versus open radical cystectomy in bladder cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative studies.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKun Tang\n\nFull Text Available BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: More recently laparoscopic radical cystectomy (LRC has increasingly been an attractive alternative to open radical cystectomy (ORC and many centers have reported their early experiences in the treatment of bladder cancer. Evaluate the safety and efficacy of LRC compared with ORC in the treatment of bladder cancer. METHODS: A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library was performed up to Mar 1, 2013. Outcomes of interest assessing the two techniques included demographic and clinical baseline characteristics, perioperative, pathologic and oncological variables, and post-op neobladder function and complications. RESULTS: Sixteen eligible trials evaluating LRC vs ORC were identified including seven prospective and nine retrospective studies. Although LRC was associated with longer operative time (p<0.001, patients might benefit from significantly fewer overall complications (p<0.001, less blood loss (p<0.001, shorter length of hospital stay (p<0.001, less need of blood transfusion (p<0.001, less narcotic analgesic requirement (p<0.001, shorter time to ambulation (pâ=â0.03, shorter time to regular diet (p<0.001, fewer positive surgical margins (pâ=â0.006, fewer positive lymph node (pâ=â0.05, lower distant metastasis rate (pâ=â0.05 and fewer death (pâ=â0.004. There was no significant difference in other demographic parameters except for a lower ASA score (pâ=â0.01 in LRC while post-op neobladder function were similar between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that LRC appears to be a safe, feasible and minimally invasive alternative to ORC with reliable perioperative safety, pathologic & oncologic efficacy, comparable post-op neobladder function and fewer complications. Because of the inherent limitations of the included studies, further large sample prospective, multi-centric, long-term follow-up studies and randomized control trials should be undertaken to confirm our\n\nä¹ç¶ç»è æ°èè±æ¯æ²»çèè±ç11ä¾çæè§å¯%Sigmoid neobladder treatment for 11 cases bladder cancer\n\nInstitute of Scientific and Technical Information of China (English)\n\næ¨åæ­¦; åæ´ç; çäºåº; å¨é²è´¢; å¾é¦å; æ±ªç£; å¼ æµ·æ´; èµµç\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObjective To observe the effect of sigmoid neobladder on the bladder cancer after total cystectomy. Methods Eleven cases of male patients with bladder cancer were observed. Radical cystectomy was executed with remote prostatic capsule 0. 5 cm reserved. Mesenteric sigmoid 20 cm was freed, and the continuity of them was restored. Freed colon was ranked as the U - shaped, the intestine was opened in the opposite of the mesentery edge, and adjacent intestinal valve was sutured into the cystic form with 2-0 absorbable sutures. In both sides of the posterio - upper neobladder, a small hole was cut, respectively. The ureters were pulled into the new bladder about 1. 0 cm long and were embedded in the lined bladder about 1. 5 cm long. The lower part was incised and coincided with urethral stump, ureteral stent from anterior wall of the new bladder was pulled out to the skin, then cystostomy was made. Results The operation of 11 cases was uneventful, and the average operation time was 240 mins ( 210 ï½300 min ). Blood of average 800 ml ( 600 ï½ 1 200 ml ) was transfused. Average capacity of urinary reservoir was 370 ml ( 230 ï½ 450 ml ), and residual urine volume < 30 ml. Bilateral hydronephrosis occurred in 7 cases, hydronephrosis was stable and renal function was normal after 6 months, and ureteral reflux occurred in 2 cases. Controllable urination occurred in 10 cases during the day, and uncontrollable urination occured in 1 case in daytime. Incontinence occurred in 5 cases at nighttime. Occasional urinary incontinence occurred in 2 cases at nighttime, and voiding was improved in others 3 ï½6 months later. Metabolic acidosis and mucus blockage in the urethra were not observed. One case with airway stenosis was cured by expanding the urethra. Intestinal obstruction occured in 1 case. And 1 case died of non - indigenous diseases.

Imaging is absolutely necessary when new clinical symptoms occur postoperatively. In this case a rebleeding or an incorrect implant position abutting a root or the spinal cord must be proven. In addition to these immediately occurring postoperative clinical symptoms, there are a number of complications that can occur several days, weeks or even months later. These include the failed back surgery syndrome, implant loosening or breakage of the material and relapse of a disc herniation and spondylodiscitis. In addition to knowledge of the original clinical symptoms, it is also important to know the operation details, such as the access route and the material used. In almost all postoperative cases, imaging with contrast medium administration and corresponding correction of artefacts by the implant material, such as the dual energy technique, correction algorithms and the use of special magnetic resonance (MR) sequences are necessary. In order to correctly assess the postoperative imaging, knowledge of the surgical procedure and the previous clinical symptoms are mandatory besides special computed tomography (CT) techniques and MR sequences.

The impairmen in perception and psychomotor skills that has been shown to result from caloric restriction, bedrest, sedation and sleep deprivation suggests that a similar deficit may occur after surgical procedures. After a simple elective surgical procedure, maximal oxygen uptake decreases and the adaptability of heart rate to submaximal workloads is impaired. Similar deleterious effects on cardiorespiratory performance have been documented with starvation and bedrest; an understanding of cardiorespiratory performance postoperatively awaits further investigation. Maximal muscular force of contraction is also impaired by caloric restriction and bedrest, suggesting that similar effects may be seen in the postoperative state, although this has not been studied. A better understanding of the syndrome of postoperative fatigue could be achieved by a descriptive analysis of physiologic performance postoperatively. Such descriptive data could form the basis for objective evaluation of therapeutic measures intended to improve performance, such as nutritional supplementation and pharmacologic intervention. The observation that exercise with the patient in the supine position may decrease the impairment in maximal aerobic power otherwise expected in immobilized patients suggests that controlled exercise therapy may be of value in reducing physiologic impairment postoperatively.\n\nPostoperative MRI of the ankle; Postoperative Magnetresonanztomographie des Sprunggelenks\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSharabianlou Korth, M.; Fritz, L.B.

Pathological and postoperative changes to the primarily complex anatomy of the ankle with its great variety of bone structures, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue in a very limited space may cause great difficulty in differentiating underlying pathology from expected postoperative changes and artifacts, especially in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selecting the appropriate radiological modality is key to making the correct diagnosis. Therefore, knowledge of the initial and current symptoms is just as important as familiarity with the most frequently performed operations in the ankle. This article aims to give its reader a summary of the most important and frequently performed operation techniques of the ankle and discusses the expected appearance and possible complications in postoperative imaging.

In the modern era of pending health care reform with increasing financial constraints, the financial burden of post-operative spinal infections also deserves consideration. The aim of our work is to give to the reader an updated review of the latest achievements in prevention, risk factors, diagnosis, microbiology and treatment of post-operative spinal wound infections. A review of the scientific literature was carried out using electronic medical databases Pubmed, Google Scholar, Web of Science and Scopus for the years 1973-2012 to obtain access to all publications involving the incidence, risk factors, prevention, diagnosis, treatment of postoperative spinal wound infections. We initially identified 119 studies; of these 60 were selected.

This complication not only compromises recovery after surgery, but, if persistent, it minimizes and compromises surgery itself. Risk factors of postoperative cognitive disorders can be divided into age and comorbidity dependent, and those related to anesthesia and surgery. Cardiovascular, orthopedic and urologic surgery carries high risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. It can also occur in other types of surgical treatment, especially in elderly. Among risk factors of cognitive disorders, associated with comorbidity, underlying psychiatric and neurological disorders, substance abuse and conditions with elevation of intracranial pressure are in the first place in postoperative patients. Preoperative and perioperative predisposing conditions for cognitive dysfunction and their incidence were described in our paper. These are: geriatric patients, patients with substance abuse, preexisting psychiatric or cognitive disorders, neurologic disease with high intracranial pressure, cerebrovascular insufficiency, epilepsia, preeclampsia, acute intermittent porphyria, operation type, brain hypoxia, changes in blood glucose level, electrolyte imbalance, anesthetic agents, adjuvant medication and intraoperative awareness. For each of these factors, evaluation, prevention and treatment strategies were suggested, with special regard on anesthetic technique.\n\nPostoperative Ileus in the Elderly\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nChih-Peng Tu\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Postoperative ileus is among the most common complications after surgery. Aging is associated with an increased colonic transit time, and anesthetic disturbance to colonic motility is often aggravated in the elderly. Postoperative ileus increases morbidity, prolongs the length of hospital stay, and constitutes a significant economic burden on the healthcare system. Multimodal enhanced recovery protocols, or fast-track surgeries, have been developed to improve postoperative recovery. Patient education, avoidance of perioperative fluid overload, selective use of nasogastric decompression, early ambulation, adopting a minimally invasive approach, early initiation of clear fluids, and gum chewing are all possible measures to reduce postoperative ileus. Thoracic epidural anesthesia is a well-established technique to hasten recovery, whereas insufficient data are available to ascertain the safety and efficacy of opioid-sparing analgesia in the elderly. The evidence is clear that traditional prokinetic medications are not helpful in the treatment or prevention of postoperative ileus. Early results suggest that alvimopan is a promising agent to reverse opioid-induced ileus. Since postoperative ileus is a multifactorial condition, a concerted effort is therefore necessary to prevent or decrease the duration of postoperative ileus using multimodal strategies.\n\nPostoperative radiology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBurhenne, H.J.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThis paper reports on the importance of postoperative radiology. Most surgical procedures on the alimentary tract are successful, but postoperative complications remain a common occurrence. The radiologist must be familiar with a large variety of possible surgical complications, because it is this specialty that is most commonly called on to render a definitive diagnosis. The decision for reoperation, for instance, is usually based on results from radiologic imaging techniques.

Fifty-four patients (39 men and 15 women) were scanned with an EBCT unit between 3 and 110 months after performing orthotopic ureteroileal urethrostomy (''Hemi-Kock'') or ureteroileal rectosigmoidostomy. Various parameters and spatial viewing points were used in the 3D reconstruction, which was performed interactively on external workstations with commercially available software. The anti-reflux nipple was visualized as a distinct structure in all patients. In 8 patients with an interval of more than 12 months between surgery and CT, the pouch had developed an ovoid shape almost indistinguishable from the original bladder. The segmented data sets were partly animated to display the anatomy as virtual endoscopy. Three-dimensional depiction and virtual endoscopy of the neobladder using EBCT are a new way of imaging the postoperative anatomy. Its clinical efficacy in the diagnosis of inconclusive postoperative morbidity, especially voiding problems, and planning of necessary therapy have to be the subject of further evaluation.

The pathophysiologic features of chylothorax include dehydration, loss of nutrients and immunological components. Intraopreative prevention is the first step for the management, and treatment options include conservative therapy, percutaneous intervention, and redo-operation. Although the treatment algorithm has not been standardized, chylothorax which is refractory to conservative treatment, or that with high output greater than 1,000 ml/day should be treated aggressively with thoracic duct embolization or redo-operation in a timely fashion.

Pathological and postoperative changes to the primarily complex anatomy of the ankle with its great variety of bone structures, tendons, ligaments, and soft tissue in a very limited space may cause great difficulty in differentiating underlying pathology from expected postoperative changes and artifacts, especially in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Selecting the appropriate radiological modality is key to making the correct diagnosis. Therefore, knowledge of the initial and current symptoms is just as important as familiarity with the most frequently performed operations in the ankle. This article aims to give its reader a summary of the most important and frequently performed operation techniques of the ankle and discusses the expected appearance and possible complications in postoperative imaging.

Material and Methods: MR images obtained prior to and following craniopharyngioma resection were evaluated retrospectively in 10 patients. Tumour signal charcteristics, size and extension with particular reference to the optic chiasm, the pituitary gland, the pituitary stalk and the third ventricle were evaluated. Results: Following surgery, tumour volume was reduced in all patients. In 6 patients there was further tumour volume reduction between the first and second postoperative images. Two of these patients received radiation therapy between the 2 postoperative studies, while 4 had no adjuvant treatment to the surgical intervention. There was improved visualization of the optic chiasm, in 3, the pituitary stalk in one, and the third ventricle in 9 of the 10 patients. The pituitary gland was identified preoperatively only in one patient, postoperatively only in another, pre- and postoperatively in 5, and neither pre- nor postoperatively in 3 patients. In 3 patients MR imaging 0-7 days postoperatively identified tumour remnants not seen at the end of the surgical procedure. The signal intensities of solid and cystic tumour components were stable from pre- to the first postoperative MR images. Optic tract increased signal prior to surgery was gone 28 days postoperatively in one patient, but persisted on the left side for 197 days after surgery in another. Conclusion: Postoperative MR imaging of craniopharyngiomas demonstrated tumour volume reduction and tumour remnants not seen at surgery. Early postoperative MR imaging of craniopharyngiomas may overestimate the size of residual tumour. Improved visualization of peritumoral structures may be achieved.

Evaluation concentrates on continence and associated morbidity observed on close follow-up. Patients and Methods: A total of 37 patients including 16 females with T2 3 bladder cancer (19 transitional, 15 : squamous and 3 adenocarcinoma) were treated by radical cystectomy and totally detubularized ileocolic neobladder. Post operative morbidity, continence and urodynamic studies were evaluated. Mean time to have full daytime continence was tested against age, gender, postoperative complications, technique of pouch creation either stapler or hand suture and adjuvant irradiation. Results: Cystometry 12 months post surgery showed 493 ml median capacity with basal and maximum reservoir median pressures of 16 and 38 cm H 2 O respectively. Uro-flowmetry had maximum voiding volume of 370ml, voiding time 45s and maximum flow rate of 11.6ml/s. Within the first 2 months post operative 44% were continent by day, 33% by night and 67% had stress incontinence. By 12 months post surgery 89% were continent by day, 73% by night and 27% had stress incontinence. Two years post surgery 94% were continent by day and 81 % had complete day and night control of uri-ne. Urinary leakage was the most frequent early complication (10.8%). Late complications were urinary tract infection (13.5%), metabolic acidosis (13.5%) and reflux (10.8%). Pouch over distension (5.4%) was consistent with bladder neck obstruction. Patient's gender and postoperative morbidity were statistically significant factors to increase the mean time to continence; whereas, age, use of stapler and adjuvant radiotherapy had no significant effect. Conclusion: Modified Le Bag pouch is a simple technique with adequate pouch capacity that offers excellent slowly progressing continence rates with minor morbidity rate.

Experiences with transit ileus are often encountered after the aortic surgery. Thus traditional postoperative care involves delayed oral feeding until the patients regain their normal bowel activities. This report examines the feasibility of early postoperative feeding after abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) open-repair. From May 2002 through May 2003, 10 consecutive patients with infrarenal AAA who underwent elective surgical open-repair by the same surgeon in our department were reviewed. All of them had been operated upon and cared for according to the early feeding postoperative care protocol, which comprised of adjuvant epidural anesthesia, postoperative patient controlled analgesia, early postoperative feeding and early rehabilitation. The postoperative recovery and length of hospital stay were reviewed and analyzed. All patients were able to sip water within 1 day postoperatively without trouble (Average; 12.4 hours postoperatively). All but one patient was put on regular diet within 3 days postoperatively (Average; 2.2 days postoperatively). The average postoperative length of stay in hospital was 5.8 days. No patient died or had major morbidity. Early postoperative feeding after open repair of abdominal aorta is safe and feasible. The postoperative recovery could be improved and the length of stay reduced by simply using adjuvant epidural anesthesia during surgery, postoperative epidural patient-controlled analgesia, early feeding, early ambulation, and early rehabilitation. The initial success of our postoperative recovery program of aortic repair was demonstrated.\n\n[Effect of postoperative precision nutrition therapy on postoperative recovery for advanced gastric cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZhao, Q; Li, Y; Yu, B; Yang, P G; Fan, L Q; Tan, B B; Tian, Y; Yang, A B\n\n2018-02-23\n\nObjective: To investigate the effect of postoperative precision nutrition therapy on postoperative recovery (PR) of patients with advanced gastric cancer (AGC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NC). Methods: 71 subjects were randomly divided into 2 groups. The 34 patients of research group were treated with postoperative precision nutrition treatment according to the indirect energy measurement method. The 31 patients of control group were treated with traditional postoperative nutrition treatment. All participants were measured for body mass index (BMI), NRS2002, PG-SGA and relevant laboratory test within the 1st day before surgery and 7th day after surgery. Moreover, the difference between two groups in short-term effects were evaluated. Results: The daily energy supply of control group was 30.1%-43.74% higher than that of the experimental group ( P nutritional risk became lower in the research group ( P recovery of patients in the research group was comparable to that of the control group ( P >0.05). Moreover, the complication rate and hospitalization costs of in research group were significantly lower than that of in control group ( P nutritional risks before surgery, the nutritional index and inflammatory index in the research group were better than those in the control group.

While one chapter is dedicated to the diagnoses obtained during the postoperative case of patients operated for the lungs a second chapter deals with the X-ray diagnosis of patients during the first days after lung surgery. Chapter 3 discusses the postoperative medical care of patients in medical intensive case units after operations other than lung surgery. The parallels between the critical care of patients after heart surgery and the critical care after operations other than heart surgery explain their simultaneous discussion in one chapter. Some diagnoses refer to patients subjected to long-term oxygen breathing and patients after abdomen and bone joint surgery. These are parallels between the volume 'Postoperative X-ray morphology: Blood vessels' and the chapter 'Heart' dealing with the coronary vessels; postoperative changes due to cogenital vitiae belong to pediatric radiology. The oesophagus dealt with in 'mediastinum und mediastinal organs' is also discussed in the volume on 'Postoperative X-ray morphology: Abdomen.'

Hypnotics serve to induce and maintain anaesthesia and to abolish patients' consciousness. Their persisting clinical action can delay postoperative cognitive recovery and favour postoperative delirium. Some evidence suggests that these unwanted effects vary according to each hypnotic's specific pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics and its interaction with the individual patient. We designed this study to evaluate postoperative delirium rate after general anaesthesia with various hypnotics in patients undergoing surgical procedures other than cardiac or brain surgery. We also aimed to test whether delayed postoperative cognitive recovery increases the risk of postoperative delirium. Methods/Design After local ethics committee approval, enrolled patients will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. In all patients anaesthesia will be induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with the anaesthetics desflurane, or sevoflurane, or propofol and the analgesic opioid fentanyl. The onset of postoperative delirium will be monitored with the Nursing Delirium Scale every three hours up to 72 hours post anaesthesia. Cognitive function will be evaluated with two cognitive test batteries (the Short Memory Orientation Memory Concentration Test and the Rancho Los Amigos Scale preoperatively, at baseline, and postoperatively at 20, 40 and 60 min after extubation. Statistical analysis will investigate differences in the hypnotics used to maintain anaesthesia and the odds ratios for postoperative delirium, the relation of early postoperative cognitive recovery and postoperative delirium rate.

Methods and Materials: Eleven consecutive patients who had Whipple resection and postoperative irradiation for pancreatic cancer were evaluated. Preoperative and postoperative computed tomographs of each patient were evaluated for the position of the portal vein bifurcation and the origin of the celiac axis and superior mesenteric artery. The length along the x (medial-lateral position) and y (anterior-posterior position) axes was determined with calipers to the closest millimeter. Length along the z axis (cephalad-caudad position) was determined with the computed tomographic sectional interval between images. Statistical significance of the change in the structure's position along the x, y, or z axis between preoperative and postoperative computed tomographs was assessed with the paired t-test. Results: Evaluation of the preoperative and postoperative positions of the portal vein, celiac axis, and superior mesenteric artery along the x, y, and z axes revealed a statistically significant change in the location of the portal vein and celiac axis postoperatively. The median change of the celiac axis in the anterior-posterior position was significant (p = 0.0047), but the mean change was only 2 mm and not considered clinically significant. The median change for the portal vein was 0.97 cm and 1.07 cm along the y and x axes, respectively, and was significant (p = 0.008 and p = 0.0001). The range in position change for the portal vein was 0.0 to 2.0 cm along the y axis and 0.4 to 1.9 along the x axis. The remaining mean changes in position along all axes for all the structures were less than 3 mm (not statistically significant).
