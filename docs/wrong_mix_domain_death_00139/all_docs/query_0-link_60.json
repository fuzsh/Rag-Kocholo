The Museum exhibit says it best, Margaret Marge Hernandez, nee Spencer, was born and raised in Norfolk, Virginia. She earned a degree in English Literature from the University of Richmond and later a master's degree in Social Work from San Francisco State University. While at University of Richmond Marge began dating Midshipman Jesse Hernandez. Hernandez was the Company Commander of 3rd Company, the 1958 color Company. At the Color Parade that June she wore this dress with a large hoop skirt and a white hat with a wide brim and blue and gold ribbons. While pursuing her own passions, Marge supported and encouraged Jesse throughout a thirty six year Naval career in which he reached the rank of Rear Admiral. Marge was a founding member of the Navy Arlington Ladies, a volunteer organization who ensures that every person buried at Arlington Cemetery has someone in attendance. She also volunteered with the Navy- Marine Corps Relief Society and served as a Deacon at her church. Marge passed away on March 31, 2022 and was later laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. She is remembered for her intellect, kindness, and devotion to family and friends.\n\n1958 COLOR PARADE\n\n■ JOHN MCCAIN ARRIVES IN NORTH VIETNAM  I recently came across a photo of John McCain at the time of his capture in North Vietnam in 1967. When he ejected from his plane he landed in TrueBach Lake in Hanoi. The photo shows a number of North Vietnamese (fishermen?) who captured/rescued John. The beginning of what would be a long ordeal.\n\nJOHN MCCAIN IN TRUE BACH LAKE, HANOI\n\n■ CALIFORNIA DREAMING (part one)  Chuck Smith sent in a report of a '58 gathering for lunch at the Coronado Golf Course in San Diego in February 2024. In the picture, from the left, are Mike and MaryAnn Chapple, Chuck and Tamara Smith, Lance Massey, Marty McCullough, Tom Fleming's date Meredith and Tom, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Collette Harshberger, Lori Cook and Madelyn Fenick.\n\nHAPPY DAYS IN SAN DIEGO\n\n■ CALIFORNIA DREAMING (part two)  Golf is big in California and especially so in San Diego. Shortly after the luncheon reported above some of the guys took to the links in Coronado. No report on their scores so the picture was probably taken before they played. From the left are Mike Chapple, Taylor Keith and Chuck Smith.\n\nSUNSHINE, WARM WEATHER AND GOLF IN CALIFORNIA\n\n■ SUMMER CRUISE 1955  PART VIII (from the diary of Dave Ault, 10th Company)\n\n30 June  Poor weather with rain. PayDay! $59.00. It went very fast though. $22.75 for the London trip and then $20.00 for clocks. I'm spending it like water now, must stop soon. Have great hopes of coming back here with Frank in two years so must save the money. It was a great day except for the weather. We didn't do any work early, just stood in lines. Finally did do some firing at GQ, but again not I. Maybe tomorrow. The darn things sure do make a racket. It must be hell during a battle. I hope I never have to experience it. No movie tonight. It's inside again. It's getting pretty cold as we head north. The white hats went into blues today and we have inspection in blue service on Saturday. But not me! Again Lady Luck is with me and I'm a compartment cleaner. I'll work tomorrow and Saturday morning, but the rest of it is easy. This free time is wonderful. I never realized what I was missing. I don't like turning out so early though. Oh, for the life of a Spaniard. Well, to bed before I start thinking again.\n\nI July  Rainy, cold. My first field day, but again I luck out as I also got my first watch. Compartment cleaner of the smallest compartment aboard ship. We did work though and got it cleaned up pretty well. Went to lecture, but gun-firing was cancelled because of the weather. Hit the hay early  dropped off soon enough.\n\n2 July  Cold, sunny. Big inspection day. Our compartment was of course, excellent. While others stood at attention, us duffers hit the steel deck down on Broadway for an hour's sleep. It's so easy to sleep anywhere, anytime nowadays. Trouble was I couldn't go right to sleep at night. Yes and I worked this afternoon  stowed the damn refueling gear and painted water ways, etc. I don't like to work, I've decided. Did go to my first inside movie - Rhapsody with Liz Taylor. I liked the story, music and Liz  wasn't bad all in all. Had to fold up my laundry when I came back and then to bed.\n\n3 July  Cold, cloudy. This miserable North Atlantic weather  isn't it ever warm? We're wearing sweater or shirts since those idiotic ROTC's said ours were nonreg. Those crazy asses! Today was another lazy one  turned to at 0800 and just cleaned the place up a bit. Then secured at 1045. Picked up pounds at noon after a most vivid lecture on VD by the ship's Doc. Anchor tomorrow.\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nBuck Belcher, 1st Company, passed away on 17 October 2023\n\nRobert Lamoureux, 2nd Company, died on 24 November 2023\n\nChris Naquin, 10th Company, died on 28 November 2023\n\nJack Cresko, 21st Company, died on 10 January 2024\n\nCharles Graham, 15th Company, passed on 28 January 2024\n\nLiles Creighton, 14th Company, died on 2 March 2024\n\nDonald Carty, 20th Company, died on 7 March 2024\n\nJoanne Coyle, widow of Frank Coyle, 23rd Company, passed away on 23 February 2024\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nMARCH  APRIL 2024\n\n■THOMAS BUELL, USNA 1958, 12TH COMPANY  Admiral Raymond Spruance USN, one of our most famous Naval Officers in WWII lived in Pebble Beach CA in his retirement years and was a member of a local men's club which I currently belong to. Recently I was asked to give a talk to the club on the life of Admiral Spruance. I obtained a copy of the biography of Admiral Spruance titled The Quiet Warrior and discovered that the author was our Classmate Tom Buell. As I further discovered Tom was a well known author and historian. He received the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Distinguished Contribution to Naval Literature from the Naval Order of the United States and the Alfred Thayer Mahan Award for Literary Achievement from the Navy League. He also was the author of Master of Sea Power a biography of Admiral of the Fleet Ernest King and numerous other articles and books. Tom passed away in 2002, but left behind a well done legacy. (The Quiet Warrior is a great read if you are interested in WWII in the Pacific.)\n\n■ THE WASHINGTON SOCIAL WHIRL  On 30 November 2023 the DC chapters of USNA 58 and USMA 58 gathered for their annual pre Army/Navy football game luncheon. Harry Hurst (Navy) and Brad Johnson (Army) were the speakers. Attending from our Class were Jack and Ann Adams, Dan Bellay, Paul and Carolyn Brown, Linda Gamboa, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Harry Hurst, Taylor Keith, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Barbara Polski, and Pete and Julie Russell.\n\nPaul Brown presented the following poem which he wrote.\n\nThe Great '58\n\nOn the 4th of June 1958 we graduated from West Point and the USNA\n\nThat morning was sixty five very long years ago, that was yesterday\n\nTime flows in one direction only, to the present and future from the past\n\nIf only we could revisit that day so very long ago and make it forever last\n\nWe served in the mountains, jungles, heat and rain of South Vietnam\n\nand sailed underneath the polar ice of the Arctic Ocean for our Uncle Sam\n\nWe served our country on land, in the air and under the deep blue sea\n\nOur goal to keep the USA, the land of the brave and the home of the free\n\nIf only we could reverse that flow of time and revisit those years long past\n\nJoyful times with classmates long ago would be absolutely unsurpassed\n\nMay God bless our deceased classmates from the Great Fifty Eight\n\ntheir families, wives, children and grandchildren. May their futures be great\n\n■ MORE SOCIAL WHIRLING IN DC On 8 December our Class Washingtonians gathered at a Crystal City sports pub to view the Army/Navy game. (The name of the pub and the game are best forgotten.) On 14 December it was time for the annual Christmas luncheon at the Army/Navy Country Club. Whitey and Lois Edwards provided festive centerpieces and Polly Mitchell and Dan Bellay provided the music for Christmas carols.\n\n■SUMMER CRUISE 1955  PART VII (from the diary of Dave Ault, 10th Company)\n\n27 June - Anchors Away and right on schedule. It was a sad day seeing Spain disappear. I have to come back. Maybe for a little longer stay. I would make that darn train ride all over again just for one night with her in Madrid. How long before I'll forget her? Probably as soon as we hit London or soon after. What a fool I am! Last day in the office. The XO sort of wanted us out. So did CDR Nash. It's all right with me though they are darned screwed up. But must remember they are ROTCs. We got out at 1600 and didn't go back. It is great to go out and just be on a blanket until movie time. Worked on my plane. Don't see how I can get it home if I finish it. Guess I won't. Did practice on my castanets though. Should have them down pat by the time I get home.His Majesty O'Keefe wasn't too bad. Typical Burt Lancaster at his fair to middling though. Had a pleasant surprise when I hit the rack. Letter from Mom. Very good, long one. Full of good news too. Dick's graduation and Sara tied for first in her class. Hope she keeps it up for three more years. I think it is just as important and I certainly practice what I preach. Oh Life, how wonderful you are, especially over on this side of the ocean. It was a great night of sleep to look forward to. To bed so early.\n\nJune  A full day of sailing. It isn't rough at all yet. Still in the Med. My first day as a sailor doesn't seem as bad as working in the office was. Much more free time and am outside all day. Went to the movie again. King Richard and the Crusaders. Had already seen it, but it was nice to look at Ginny Mayo again. To bed early again. Guess it will be a common practice from now on. At least as long as I stand no watches. Hope they forgot my name since I haven't gotten any yet. They are so screwed up they probably have. Spain is rapidly disappearing. Africa has come up on the port beam. Not as clearly seen as when we came in. We should be out at sea again tomorrow. Started a letter to MN tonight. It's going to last a couple of days I guess. I wish I'd written more often, but then her last letter seemed cooler than previously they have been. Hope she still wants to come to Maine. Buenos Noches all.\n\n29 June  Belle jour. Up at 0600, turn to at 0615. Turned in first Cruise Journal assignments. It doesn't seem too bad as long as one pays attention at lectures. And that's not too easy on a hot day. Went through the usual GQ and gun firing. Free tomorrow. Was all decked out for a cool evening at the movies when they announced it would be inside. That finished that. Went to the rack immediately. Wrote another page or two to MN. It is getting to be a diary now. Must get another one off to Mom and Ruthie, also brother Dick's birthday is coming up. Graduation congrats too. It's great to hear that he made it. Sara too. To bed real early. Probably won't sleep all night.\n\n■ BETTER LATE THAN NEVER DEPARTMENT  Dianne Hughes the widow of Massie Hughes, 3rd Company visited Iceland last year with Neta Sharp the widow of Stan Sharp, 1st Company and\n\nDianne sent me this picture of the two of them with the 58 IS GREAT flag. I misfiled the email, but Dianne followed up and resent her email. Way to go Dianne.\n\nDiana Hughes and Neta Sharp in Iceland\n\n■CLOSING RANKS\n\nWilliam Simmons, 7th Company, passed away on 11 December 2023\n\nAlan Chodorow, 12th Company, died on 9 January 2024\n\nHarry Konkel, 6th Company, died on 6 January 2024\n\nWilliam Simmons, 7th Company, passed on 11 December 2023\n\nWilliam Smith, 4th Company, died on 25 November 2023\n\nArthur Immerman, 2nd Company, died on 6 May 2023\n\nMarcia Stephenson, wife of Hap Stephenson, 15th Company, died on 21 July 2021\n\nShelia Lanoue, wife of Bob Lanoue, 24th Company, died on 13 January 2024\n\nPenelope Rogers, widow of Richard Rogers, 20th Company died on 28 October 2023\n\nGrace Chevalier, wife of John Chevalier, 18th Company, died on 23 November 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nJANUARY-FEBRUARY 2024\n\n■WASHINGTON CHAPTER LUNCHEON  Not sure where, but the when was 28 September. Harry Hurst gave a talk about the new NCAA football rules, conference make-ups, and Navy's 2023 team. Several Classmates shared memories of Bruce McCandless. Dan Bellay recounted when Bruce rebuilt his Morris-Minor engine in the NAS Pensacola BOQ. Gordon Gerson remembered when Bruce repaired a faulty space camera during a simulated training mission in the cockpit of a space module and Taylor Keith remembered Bruce always using a fountain pen when taking math quizzes at USNA. Attending the luncheon were Fred and Jackie Victor, Phil Taylor and his daughter and son in law, Beverly Smedberg, Mike Salmon, Kay Powell, Barbara Polski, George and Anne Ojalehto, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Harry Hurst, Marty and Nancy Hill, Jesse Hernandez, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Linda Gamboa, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Dan Bellay, Jack and Ann Adams and John and Pat Davis (visiting from California).\n\nPhoto # 1\n\nHARRY HURST AND JACK ADAMS\n\n■ LARSON AWARD  Our Class of 1958 leaders met with the Acting USNA Supe to present our annual contribution to the Larson Award named in honor of Chuck Larson.\n\nJACK ADAMS, RADM KACHER, GORDON GERSON AND FRED VICTOR\n\n■ SECOND CLASS SUMMER  Eileen Giglio sent in a picture from our time at Little Creek in the summer of 1956. It should be noted that none of the four 58ers in the picture went into the Marines. Al Lupfer and Tom O'Neill went Navy Air, Joel Gill went Air Force Air and Mike Giglio went Air Force Ground.\n\nPhoto # 3\n\nJOEL GILL, MIKE GIGLIO, AL LUPFER, AND TOM O'NEILL\n\n■ THEN AND NOW  Back when we were Midshipmen the salary for an Ensign was $222/month and we received $111/month or 50% of the salary of an O1. Now an Ensign gets $3,477/month base pay and Mids get $1,273/month. Now, before you call to tell me that 1273 is not half of 3477 let me explain that the present policy is that Service Academy students get 35% of the O1 base salary. So what was then is not what is now.\n\n■ SUMMER CRUISE 1955  PART VI (from the diary of Dave Ault, 10th Company)\n\n23 June  Up at 0800 and on to that long, hard train ride  I hated to leave Madrid. It was a great town  I'm going to miss muchacha mia for awhile also  I'll come back some day though  maybe I'll see her again  it was the same train ride back  swapped stories, slept and suffered from thirst. We made it back okay  went immediately to the ship and to bed  watch at 0800 tomorrow.\n\n24 June  Back to the routine -the office, ship and all look very uninviting. Just ran errands and typed all day. Got off at 2200 and caught the end of a poor movie  then to bed  all in all a very poor day, but then there's liberty tomorrow  Did get off a letter to Mario and Dick and Ellie.\n\n25 June  hung around the office until 2 o'clock then hit the beach  walked around, looking the city over and also picked up bull fight tickets. 72Pts apiece. More sight seeing and a little buying then to the arena. I was impressed by my first Toreros de Toros, but didn't enjoy it too much  very bloody and also cruel. The guy had guts though. El toro was no little animal. But as usual he lost  all six times. I got some movies  should be interesting to the folks at home  After the fight we found Los Caracoles and ate there with Dale Westbrook and a couple of his buddies. Very good, am glad Dr. H. told me of it. Went to the Bagdad afterwards and was taken for muchas pesetas. It was interesting though. Spanish dancing and singing. Went to a bar afterwards and teased the girls and then back to the boat. The last time i'll set foot on Espana for some time I imagine. I liked it here very much  Madrid especially. I still have an ache in my heart for the city and one of the girls that walks its streets  I'll be back some day.\n\n26 June  Belle jour  Last day in Spain. Posted the watch at 0800 and started a long, mixed-up day. These ROTCs sure are Fubar .I finally got out by getting Jim Payne to take my watch at 2000. I managed to get to town finally and just walked around for an hour or two  Met Jim Adkins who was having a little money trouble with a Spanish doll. Got him squared away, had a few beers, walked the streets  feeling pleasant. We did talk with mucho chicas, but that's all. It ended my stay in Spain -(it really ended in Madrid)  I felt a little better when the evening ended than when it began. We pull up anchor at 0930 tomorrow.\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nDenny Huff, 14th, died on 27 July 2023\n\nBob Lane, 13th, died on 25 September 2023\n\nJack Giddens, 10th, died on 27 September 2023\n\nStuart Craig, 21st, died on 28 September 2023\n\nIvan Nance, 10th, died on 30 September 2023\n\nVic Gardy, 16th, died on 6 October 2023\n\nSam Belcher, 1st died on 17 October 2023\n\nRon Fisher, 17th, died on 31 October 2023\n\nJames McNulla, 1st, died on 7 November 2023\n\nHarold Hunter, 14th died on 9 November 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nNOVEMBER  DECEMBER 2023\n\n■ SUMMER CRUISE 1955  Part V (from the diary of Dave Ault, 10th Company)\n\nLAND HO!\n\n18 June 1955  Oh, the wonder of seeing a new land for the first time! As Hemingway said, the hills of Africa are Green - a beautiful green that really tempted me to get ashore. I'd like to come back some day. It looked so rugged and peaceful at the same time. Spain looked the same upon my first glimpse of it, but for some reason Africa was the land that held my gaze  it must be the mystery and intrigue that are so often connected with that continent. The Rock of Gibraltar was one of the more interesting sights of the day  and my life as a matter of fact. After hearing and reading so much of it, it was a thrill to see it. I got some pictures; they should make interesting showing at home. I certainly hope Mom can see all of this some day. I look at it and I wish everyone could see it. There's so much to go around. Africa drifted out of sight through the afternoon, but the mountains of Spain were still on the horizon when we hit the rack  made for a very nice sunset over the Mediterranean. I think I'll come back some day  Had a smoker tonight instead of movies  it wasn't a satisfactory substitution, I didn't think  the boxing was fun to watch, but the other talent was typically amateur. To sum it up, it's been one of the greater days of my short life  new lands, sights, etc. I hope to see so many more.\n\n19 June 1955  Well, when we got up this morning we were surrounded by water again  the sea is just a little bit bluer and the weather balmier and clearer. All in all, it's a great sight to wake up to  today was a hectic one  the ROTC's took over for the 2nd phase. Tom and I are staying for a couple of weeks and then will go back into the grind of a seaman's life. We'll work harder, but have more free time when it's over. I guess it won't be too bad, and we really should get a little Navy out of this cruise. Well, land, mail and women tomorrow. I'm all prepared to set out  liberty, Geneva, ID and camera cards. Also all the other little essentials. Saw Student Prince tonight. The music was wonderful  I really enjoy Mario Lanza's voice. Especially when mixed with Romberg. Very good show  well to bed  I probably will miss a couple of days of this, but will try to catch up  must sleep out tonight to help me think of home. Goodnight all.\n\n20 June 1955  Clear, hot. Up at 0530, anchored at 0803  left the ship immediately and set foot on Espana at about 0900. After a taste of our first Spanish beer we got on the train for Madrid. We saw some beautiful Spanish country, but the 13 hour train ride was hell otherwise. We all slept most of the time. It was terrifically hot and even though we traveled first class it was poor traveling  the Spanish food I go for was not  well we arrived in Madrid at 2400 and went immediately to the Hotel Plaza. What a joint! It was really high class, expensive stuff. Great beds, etc. After cleaning up, Harlow Manahan and I went out to see the town, Our first impression was a good one  it looked great! I'll never get over these European's attitude toward women and sex. It's really quite different and exciting. We went to the York club for a show dedicated to the USA Navy and then went roaming the streets again. Got to bed at 0500.\n\n21 June 1955  Up at the ungodly hour of 1300. Was great to just loll around in bed instead of turning out. Went on a tour of Madrid today  the Royal Palace, Plaza de la Sol, old Madrid, parks, bull ring, etc. It wasn't very satisfactory because we didn't see much  too much time was spent in an art museum. El Greco, etc. I didn't like it too much. Well, got back and bought some film  had supper at an american restaurant  food wasn't cooked. After chow we went on our usual inspection tour of Madrid. Met a most wonderful little girl via Russ Thorn  made another date for tomorrow  to bed at 0530.\n\n22 June 1955  Up at 1300 again  missed the Toledo tour. Sat around sidewalk cafes, talked with Spanish Midshipmen and also had coffee with a teacher from U. of Colorado  interesting. Did some window shopping  took mucho pictures. Harlow and I then went to see Candleejus (Limelight) with Charlie Chaplin. It was in Spanish, but could be understood. Charlie was pretty funny  sad story though. After the show we met a few of the guys and went and ate. Had the usual speech difficulties and had a mess-up to the tune of 100 pesetas. Afterwards we did our usual girl window shopping. Along about 11 we got to the Monterey and ordered beer  Chica hadn't arrived  she later walked in and got the usual stares, etc. I was surprised that she recognized me but she did and we got a table. She ordered her usual milk. Mario later came in and we just sat around and talked. Rat never showed up so we took off together (Harlow later got the dog tags). I hit the rack early tonight  0300. Slept well too.\n\n(To be continued)\n\n■THEN AND NOW  Back when Dave Ault was writing his diary the U.S. Navy had about 890 ships and 299 Admirals. In 2023 the Navy has 296 Flag Officers, but only about 241 operational USS ships.\n\n■ COACH HIGGINS WOULD BE PROUD  Our Class President Gordon Gerson continues to compete in National age group swim meets. In the 2023 National Long Course Championships he collected 7 medals to add to his impressive collection. Bravo Zulu Gordo.\n\n■ CLASS LUNCHEON  Our Washington area Classmates gathered for a luncheon in July at the Army-Navy Country Club. Captain Bill Hamblet, USN (RET), who is the Editor in Chief of the Naval Institute Proceedings, discussed the inception and history of the U. S. Naval Institute. The Naval Institute was established 150 years ago and, by act of Congress, it has been located at the Naval Academy since its inception in 1873. Capt. Hamblet discussed how articles of varying opinions are selected and presented and their effect on policy and procedures in our ever evolving Navy. He gave examples of articles written by junior officers that impacted strategy and policy and then revealed the names of the authors, many of whom reached flag rank. Attending the luncheon were Jack and Ann Adams, Dan Bellay, John Carty, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Linda Gamboa, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Harry hurst, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Barbara Polski, Bev Smedberg, Pete and Julie Russell and Buff Walter.\n\n CAPTAIN BILL HAMBLET AND JACK ADAMS\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nMiles Mixon, 4th Company, 4 August 2023\n\nJerry Larson, 18th Company, 8 August 2023\n\nGeorge Greer, 17th Company, 12 August 2023\n\nJack Osborn, 2nd Company, 12 August 2023\n\nPhil Meurer, 10th Company, 6 September 2023\n\nFaye Barrett, wife of Steve Barrett, 2nd Company, 31 January 2023\n\nAlison Williams, widow of George Williams, 2nd Company, 4 March 2023\n\nMarilyn Osborn, wife of Jack Osborn, 2nd Company, 12 March 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nOCTOBER 2023\n\n■ SUMMER CRUISE 1955  Part IV (On USS Iowa, at sea enroute to Spain)\n\n15 June 1955  Beautiful Day. Went out on the deck this morning and found the old lion of an ocean quiet as a lamb. Hardly a ripple as far as the eye could see. We were supposed to have gun firing today, but there wasn't enough wind to get the planes aloft. It was like that all day. This is tourist crossing weather I guess, but what am I but a tourist? On U.S. Government expense no less. Been typing liberty cards for the troops, 586 of them all together. It is a pleasant thought to know that we will be using them soon. Looked at cameras and watches today. I don't need a camera, but they sure are fascinating things to look at. I might get a watch before I go home. They look nice too. Will check with the home front. Today was payday. $59.00. But then we shelled out $37.10 for the Madrid tour. I have money. I might have a couple hundred back home. But I'm going to enjoy myself first. It's still hard to believe I'll be in Madrid Spain in a f ew days. It's a beautiful night, oodles of stars. Tom and I might sleep out on the fantail.\n\n16 June 1955  Another belle jour. Did sleep out. Reminded me of home and what I used to do. Same sky and hard to believe I am 3000 miles from home. The stars are all the same and the big dipper still points north. We are going out again tonight. It looks like a nice night, a little warmer as a matter of fact. We finally got off the gun firing. They secured the 5 inchers. What a racket the 40 mms make. No one hit the poor little red drone that kept buzzing around. I could have sworn it was laughing at us. Well, it was an interesting and noisy afternoon. I would like to try it soon. Probably will a week after we leave England. Hit the movie again tonight. Quite a movie goer now. I only stayed for the cartoon. Mack Sennett's, old cars and all. I couldn't see watching the Beast from 20,000 Fathoms. Well to bed under the stars again. It looks like rain later on.\n\n17 June 1955  What a day! Yes it rained about 0500. I woke up soaked. Spent the rest of the night under the Admiral's gig. It cleared up soon enough though and turned into a beautiful day. Field day for all hands except Tom and me. I did work though. Typed steadily on watch bills. We are preparing for next phase. Tom and I have hopes of staying on. I'll even do my cruise journal if I have to. I saw Steve Soitez on the Glennon during a high line this morning. He looks sick. I sympathize with him wholeheartedly. Tomorrow is inspection day. We expect to go by the Rock of Gibraltar at about 1000 too. Hope I can get some pictures. Went to see Marlon in Waterfront tonight. The 3rd time. I still enjoyed it though. He is really great. It's later tonight than it usually is. We are closing up our first phase and also preparing for inspection. Looks like tomorrow will be a good day. Land for the first time in 14 days.\n\n■ A LIFE WELL LIVED - Adrienne McCullough, the wife of Marty McCullough 12th Company, died on 18 May 2023. She was born in Chandannagar India in February 1936. Her parents were David Scott and Phyllis Scott. At this time India was a colony of the United Kingdom and her father was a business man assigned to a post in Calcutta and Adrienne's early years were in Calcutta. A very exciting and colorful place to grow up. When World War II started her father joined the Royal Indian Army Service Corps and the family moved to places like Deolali, Jhansi and Rawalpindi. Her father was killed in action while working on the Burma Road, one of the most remarkable engineering achievements of all time. After his death the family returned to Calcutta and Adrienne attended boarding school in Darjeeling, India in the foothills of the Himalayans. With the end of the war Adrienne's mother married an American executive working in India and the family relocated to Shanghai, China where Adrienne attended the Shanghai American School. All this and she was only about 10. With the fall of Shanghai to the Communists the family moved back to India where she attended the Woodstock School in Mussoorie, India. The next move for this proper young English lady was to England where, although she was English, she had never lived. There she attended Gateway Girls School before her stepfather moved the family to the Arlington VA in the United States. She finished High School in 1954 and then attended George Washington University. Worked in a D.C. law firm and then joined American Airlines as a flight attendant. In 1960 she and Marty were married and this young lady, who had already seen a lot of the world, set off for more adventure as a Navy wife. During Marty's career in the Navy they lived in Norfolk, VA, Princeton, NJ, Monterey CA, Pax river, MD, Manila, Philippines, Ankara, Turkey and Coronado CA, which is where they settled down after Marty's retirement from the Navy. She was a gifted and active watercolorist and a Member of the Coronado Art Association for over 30 years. Also an active member of the Coronado Historical Association. She was a founder of the Coronado Armchair Travel program which was adopted by the Coronado Recreation Department and also active in the Church. Before retiring she worked as a Realtor and for a Coronado travel agency (a position she was well prepared for) and as a volunteer for Navy Relief and with the PTA. And I would be remiss if I failed to mention her proudest achievements as a devoted wife to Marty and loving mother to their 3 daughters.\n\nAn active life, a rewarding life, an exciting life, and a life well lived.\n\nADRIENNE MCCULLOUGH\n\n■ CLOSNG RANKS\n\nRichard Brinegar, 8th Company, died on 19 July 2023\n\nAdrienne McCullough, wife of Marty McCullough 12th Company, passed away on 18 May 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nSEPTEMBER 2023\n\n■ SUMMER CRUISE 1955, Part III, at sea in the mid Atlantic enroute to Europe\n\nSaturday 11 June  Rainy all day. Inspection today. We heaved out and triced up at 0600 and then cleaned EVERYTHING. Then they (the Capt and Exec) inspected everything even more completely than we'd cleaned it. They spent two hours alone in the mess compartments. We got by everything okay with few complaints. We then started speed runs for the IOWA's quarterly report. She really shook and trembled. She got up to 31 knots and then settled down to 25 which they kept up for four hours. She lived through it. Late in the evening we were back with the squadron. All the little red and white lights blinking. I swear we were just off the coast of somewhere, but that is days away. I'll be glad when the trip is over and we are home again. Mom Bancroft with her soft racks, real showers and motionless decks would look might nice now. But it will come in due time and with it home and a little real sleep.\n\nSunday 12 June  Clear and warm. Holiday routine all day today. That means we did no work at all. I did hang around and do odd typing jobs. Took a few pictures this morning. Beautiful day for it. Went up to the 011 level. Sunbathed all afternoon (after the Admiral left via helicopter). I also got a letter off to MN, dear MN. How I do hope she can come up for awhile this August and things work out. I know Mom would like MN. She is what every mother's boy should have. Went to the movies for the first time. It was Down Three Dark Streets. Was pretty entertaining. An FBI thriller. Worked til 12:30 after the show and then they screwed us by setting the clocks ahead again. Oh sleep, where is thy blessed sting? When I get to Barcelona I'm going to sleep for one whole day just to get in shape for the next three. Only seven days to go.\n\nMonday 13 June  Clear then rain. Another Monday. Thank God they aren't as blue as they could be during plebe year. Again I did intermittent typing and loafing. Al Granger gave me Tom's job of assigning guests for the Admiral. That means I'll be doing a little work. I don't think that Tom and I are having too rough a cruise, but the guys in the office do. We do stay up late and don't have much free time to roam around. But we don't stand watches or have working parties. Al says he will try to get us the job for the rest of the cruise. It's all right with me. I never was one for manual labor. Went to the movies again tonight. Dangerous Crossing. It was pretty good. Must have been one of Jeanne Crane's first. Managed to type up the memo for tomorrow by 2300 and get to bed early. Everybody did for once. I don't see how Skip is managing to stay alive. He never sleeps. They gave him some sleeping pills down at sick bay so now he sleeps at his desk. I think it is sort of stupid not sleeping when you have no reason to stay up. I guess he's beginning to think so. We had a smoke screen laying demonstration today by a couple of destroyers. Interesting, but not too spectacular. I liked the sub exhibition better. Had another high line. Wonderful how they do it.\n\nTuesday 14 June  Overcast, rainy. Got up weary, but for the first time had an appetite for breakfast. Ever since I was sick I haven't eaten much. Today was a little bit better, but I'm still not eating as much as I'm used to. I sure hope it improves because I would like to enjoy the trip home. We were supposed to fire the 5s and the 40 mms at GQ today, but the weather intervened. Some poor guy who didn't get the word took a blast at a passing plane and sleeve with the after 40 mm mount. He must have felt lonesome when he heard no other guns go off. He and his crew are, I imagine, high on the Captains' list. Another high line, over the stern this time. What won't they think of next? Went up on the bow tonight all alone. I was sort of enjoying thinking of home and all. I still find it hard to believe I'm here. We passed close to the Azores today. Be hitting the home stretch soon. 5 more days. Getting to bed early tonight. It's 2200 now. We are improving down here. By the time we are squared away the ROTCs will be taking over and screwing up the works again. I'd be satisfied though, as long as I had the job for another phase or both. What a free and happy idea.\n\n■ MAY LUNCHEON (east coast version) - The Washington Chapter of the USNA Class of 1958 met at the Army-Navy Country for lunch on 25 May 2023. Our Class sponsors a fellowship at the Stockdale Center and Dr. Daniel Cervone, who is the current fellow, was the guest speaker at the luncheon. He was joined by Dr. Ed Barrett, the fellowship permanent director. Class attendees were Buff Walter and his son, Jackie and Fred Victor, Phil Taylor and his daughter, Beverly Smedberg, Kay Powell, Lynn and Taylor Keith, Harry Hurst, Eileen and Mike Giglio, Jane and Gordon Gerson, Linda Gamboa, Lois and Whitey Edwards, John Carty, Charley Brooks, Dan Bellay and Ann and Jack Adams.\n\nDr. Cervone and Jack Adams\n\n■ MAY LUNCHEON (west coast version)  The San Francisco group of USNA Class of 1958 Classmates and spouses met at Paradise Valley Estates for lunch in May. Those attending (from the left to the right in the attached photo) were Jude Potter, Bill Gibson, John Potter, Nancy Bartels, Bruce Bartels, John Davis, Bill Oliver and Virginia Oliver. (Note: you will observe that fewer Classmates attended the West Coast luncheon, but perhaps that is because it is harder to get to Paradise)\n\n58ers in Paradise\n\n■ THEN AND NOW  In June of 1958 the Dow Jones Average was about 469 and a new Chevy Impala cost $2841. Today the DJA is 3563 and a new Impala is $30,348. In 1958 an Ensign (01) received a base monthly pay of $222. Today a 01 is paid $3477/month. When we were Midshipmen we were paid $111/month. Today Midshipmen are paid on the order of $1150/month, but just as in our days there they do not receive all of that directly. Uniforms must be paid for along with tailor shop fees, laundry fees, etc and there is a nest egg waiting at the end of the four years. They do receive a $75/month stipend during plebe summer which increases to $125/month the remainder of plebe year and increases each year thereafter.\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS:\n\nCOL.

In this and subsequent columns I will continue to incorporate entries from Dave's diary as he wrote it on board the USS Iowa.\n\nNow for Summer Cruise 1955, Part II:\n\nMonday 6 June  Clear skies again. We pulled out at 0730, sailing for Spain, scheduled ETA on the 20th. We manage to start settling down to a slight routine in the office and get things organized. It was a pretty day and very smooth sailing. At about noon we had formed a formation and were on our way. We were assigned GQ stations today  I'm trainer on Mount 51  also am pointer on gunnery station 419  both very interesting jobs. I hit the sack early again  It's so easy to sleep. We had a very incomplete tour of the ship today  she's tremendous  887' long and 108' wide. That's nearly the length of three football fields.\n\nTuesday 7 June  Stormy  rain. Who says you can't get seasick on a Battleship? We started getting some swells and I upchucked breakfast  still managed to do some typing. Felt lousy all day  did not go to dinner or lunch. Skip Furlong, in charge of the Mid'n office, let me secure early and so I hit the sack at 1600  slept like a dead log  oh, yes, we had a sub exhibition by the USS Tench (SS-417)today  got some movies.\n\nWednesday 8 June  Very windy, clear. Had ourselves some 55 mph winds last night  water breaking over the deck  woke up feeling very poor  comparable to the hang-over after the Army game. I did try to down some breakfast, but lost it in a short time. Finally went to sick bay  got some pills but still felt lousy. They finally took hold though and I got down some supper which is still in the hole. We had a couple of highline transfers today from the USS Benner (DD-807) and the USS Glennon (DD-840). It was quite interesting because the seas were so rough. I certainly feel for the poor guys on the destroyers  they toss and pitch so! I'm okay now, I think will be able to tell tomorrow.\n\nThursday 9 June  Windy, rainy. Got up feeling okay  no more mal de mer!! I am beginning to enjoy ship life now. It wasn't an outstanding day  had a high-line episode again  a second one was postponed until tomorrow morning. Today we didn't work very hard  lots of spare time. Had a lecture on engineering organization  refrigeration yesterday and the evaporators the day before. Got off a letter to mom and Bridie today. When will they get them? Find myself thinking of home and next summer  should have big times. Stayed up in the office to 9:30 tonite. Am tired.\n\nFriday 10 June  Rainy  clear night. Another easy day  field day for all other hands. We just sat in the office and ate ice cream. I really felt for the guys holy-stoning, etc. We have a big inspection tomorrow  all hands are squaring away their gear and sanding the decks  shoe shine party up here in the office. Didn't feel so hot for supper  thought the M de M had come back, so took a couple of pills to be safe. Didn't eat too much. We change time again tonight  ahead an hour. We have got about 3000 miles left to go. I went out on deck tonight  it's hard to believe we are way out here in the middle of the Atlantic on a ship  and all the lights around are just the ships and not land-ho. It's a pretty night though  the spray goes up over the side into my face  love it. Still think I'll go Navy Air though  flying's the greatest.\n\nnote  Dave was onboard the USS Iowa BB-61 while I was on one of those destroyers that he observed tossing and pitching; (WGS)\n\n■ LUNCH AMONG THE CHERRY BLOSSOMS  On March 30th the DC Chapter of the Class of 1958 gathered for a luncheon at the Army/Navy Country Club. Our Class President Gordon Gerson discussed the upcoming 65th Reunion and Harry Hurst previewed the 2023 Navy football team and the new coaching staff.

RADM George Meinig USN (ret), Class of '58, is the recipient of that very special honor. For his work in the development of AEGIS the RADM GEORGE MEINIG INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE ENGINEERING CENTER was named in his honor. The Center is a 50,000 square foot building in Moorestown NJ.\n\nRADM GEORGE MEINIG INTEGRATED AIR AND MISSILE DEFENSE ENGINEERING CENTER\n\n■ PHOTOS FROM THE 65TH\n\nOne of the events at our 65th reunion was a memorial service at the Academy Chapel.

The Class owes a special thanks to the following Classmates for all their efforts Gordon Gerson 11th, Marty Hill 24th, Bruce Wilcox 12th, Dan Bellay 7th, Fred Victor 11th, Harry Hurst 7th, Jack Adams 4th, John Carty 23rd, Mike Giglio 10th, Rupe Maclean 21st, Taylor Keith 19th, Terry Cooper 24th and Whitey Edwards 17th. And a really special thanks to two Class widows for all their help, Linda Gamboa 17th and Kay Powell 13th. Well Done to you all.\n\n■ CRUISE 1955,  In June of 55, following the graduation of the Class of '55, the rest of the Brigade including the new 3/c from the Class of '58 set forth on their summer cruise adventures. One of our Classmates, Dave Ault, from the 10th Company kept a diary of his cruise. Dave is deceased now, but his family has passed along his diary which I will share in our Class column in the form of a serial.\n\nThe Cruise, part I - Saturday 4 June 1955  Weather clear. Up at 0430 and down to chow. Final cramming of gear and then down to the Maine Mast to embark in the P-boats at exactly the scheduled 0600. Took about 45 mnutes to get out to the USS Iowa where she was anchored in the Bay. She certainty looked big when we drew alongside. As soon as I found my rack and locker (both very small) and stowed my gear I was ordered to the Mid Cruise Office and put to work typing. Mass confusion reigned, but we finally got out watch bills, etc for that night. While I was busy at work the Iowa weighed anchor at 0730 and headed for Norfolk VA. We arrived at Norfolk at about 1930 and tied up at pier 7. We were granted liberty from 2000 to 0100. I met up with Bob MacGregor and Walt Kopp and we traveled by bus into Norfolk. We ended up at the Dolphin, a submariners hangout and I managed to reach that pleasant point of not being quite drunk. At about 2230 I tore myself away from the boys and came back to the ship. The rack felt great after a long day and I had no trouble going to sleep..\n\nSunday 5 June - Weather clear. Reveille at 0630 and back to the office. Did some more typing and then took off for Norfolk at 1000. Met Lou Shane on the base and we went out to Virginia Beach after a light lunch. I lost Lou somewhere after we got there and borrowed a pair of trunks from Bernie Ryan and stretched out on the beach. It was a beautiful place and not too crowded. Later I met George in the bar out there and we settled down at a table with a couple of pitchers of beer (90 cents each). Sent off a couple of post cards, played some pool and then we came back. I tossed Gene Radcliffe for a girl that Bud Kerr had available that night and won. We three then had a very good supper and the set out for an evening of pleasure. Gene left early and Bud and I wandered down Norfolk's strip and all I could see were bars. It's a poor liberty town. Not many women and mostly all white hats. I didn't feel much like drinking anymore so we just wandered around. We later met girls at the Music Box and found they were both engaged and had their fiancées along. The Music Box was a funny little place. Very respectable. The entertainers were all drunk which made them all the more entertaining. We later left Norfolk for the docks. The bus was full of drunk white hats. Everyone's last night ashore until we hit Barcelona.\n\n(to be contnued)\n\nUSS IOWA\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nDick Lawe, 22nd Company, died in March 2023\n\nWalt Reister, 19th Company, died on 19 February 2023\n\nJay Taylor, 1st Company, passed away but date unknown\n\nLarry Larson, 16th Company died on 1 February 2023\n\nChuck Baker, 11th Company, died on 5 March 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nMAY 2023\n\n■65th Reunion  Our Reunion in mid April was a great success and all the attendees had a wonderful time. (Disclaimer- I am writing this column in mid-February since submissions for the May issue were due by 21 February. So once in a while I refer to my crystal ball.)\n\n■ California Dreaming  Golf in California is a year round activity and no where more so than in San Diego. Chuck Smith, 20th Company, reported that he, Mike Chapple 5th Company and Taylor Keith 19th Company enjoyed a round of golf at the North Island golf links. There was no report on scores or who won.\n\nMike, Taylor and Chuck\n\n■ Diplomas and Dilemmas  Russ Henderson, 9th Company, wrote with an interesting observation about our Diplomas. His question was, where do they go when we go? Some of us, perhaps most of us, have a child or grandchild who will say they would like our Diploma. In some cases because they would really like a part of our history or in some cases maybe to make us feel good. But what about those of us who don't have a relative to leave it to? Any suggestions out there? By the way, the design for our Diplomas was first used at the Academy in 1869 and our Class was the last Class to get those classy Diplomas. Starting with the Class of '59 the Academy shifted to a much less attractive and much cheaper version.\n\n A Class of 1958 Diploma\n\n■ Closing Ranks:\n\nCharles Korzinek, 7th Company, passed away on January 23rd 2023\n\nFaye Barrett, wife of Steve Barrett, 2nd Company died on the 31st of January 2023\n\nCarol Bernes, wife of Don Bernes, 4th Company died on January 19th 2023\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nMARCH-APRIL 2023\n\n65TH REUNION\n\nAs I write this column in January the plans are set for our 65th reunion from 13 to 16 April 2023. Everyone should have received emails and letters with the details about the schedule, registration, etc. Reservations hopefully have been made at the Annapolis Westin along with on-line registration for the scheduled events and bags are being packed for the big trip. The reunion starts on Thursday the 13th when the out of towners will be arriving. This is a good day for some sightseeing in Annapolis and making contact with roommates, Company-mates and shipmates. Friday will be the busiest day of the reunion. That morning buses will take us to the Academy for a memorial service at the Chapel followed by a group picture. Then lunch at the Officers and Faculty Club, a presentation by the Superintendent and comments by the President of the Alumni Association followed by a Brigade Parade on Worden Field. Then buses back to the Westin to get ready for Company dinners/parties that evening. Saturday starts with another bus ride to the Academy for a tour of Terwilliger Hall, one of the newest buildings on the grounds, then free time to tour the grounds, watch the noon meal formation, visit the Mid store and catch some lunch. In the afternoon there will be a Lacrosse game at the stadium and that evening our Class dinner at the Westin. Sunday there will be chapel services for those inclined and brunch in King Hall. Then it will be time to say goodbye to old friends, and to the Academy where the Severn meets the Bay.\n\n■ Mike Giglio sent a report of a 10th Company gathering that took place in Alexandria VA in September 2022. The report and photo of that gathering came to me in late December and now in January I am including it in the column for the March-April issue of Shipmate, but the real message in these Class columns is who is doing what not when. Those in the picture, from the left, are Bill Hillsman, Bill Garvey, JJ Seeberger, Sally and Dave Sutherland, Eileen Giglio, Walker Venable (Bobs son), Bob Venable, Jake and Dianne McMichael, Bonnie Venable, Micky Hillsman, Mike Giglio and Pat Seeberger.\n\n10th Company Reunion\n\n■ December 2022 was a very social time for 58ers in the Washington-Annapolis area. Forget sheltering for COVID, the theme was let's party! Jack Adams reported on the annual Army-Navy '58 Joint luncheon on 1 December at the Army-Navy Country Club. Harry Hurst and Bob Orlosky (64) briefed the attendees about Navy's football team and Brad Johnson did the same thing for Army. USNA 58ers present in addition to Harry were Buff Walter, Jackie and Fred Victor, Beverly Smedberg, Julie and Pete Russell, Barb and Eric Mansfield, Taylor Keith, Eileen and Mike Giglio, Jane and Gordon Gerson, Linda Gamboa, Lois and Whitey Edwards, Carolyn and Paul Brown, Ann and Jack Adams and Dan Bellay who provided the musical accompaniment for the singing of Navy Blue and Gold and God Bless America.\n\nBrad Johnson (USMA 58), Harry Hurst (USNA 58) and Bob Orlosky (USNA 64)\n\n■ Rupe Maclean wrote to remind us that Classmates in the Annapolis area gather for dinner on the first Tuesday of the month at the Galway Bay restaurant which we used to know as the Little Campus Inn. Shown in the picture are those attending the December dinner. From the left they are Joan and Rupe MacLean, Polly Mitchel, Gordon Gerson, Kay Powell, Jim Corder's daughter, Janet Bouvier, and Julia Corder.\n\nDinner at the Galway Bay in Annapolis\n\n■ On December 15th our Washington/Annapolis classmates were back at the Army-Navy Country Club for their annual Christmas party and Jack Adams sent in the report and photos. Polly Mitchell and Dan Bellay provided the music before lunch and for the singing of Christmas carols after lunch. Whitey and Lois Edwards provided the center pieces for each table. Those attending were Mike and Eileen Giglio, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Marty and Nancy Hill, Linda Gamboa, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Bob and Sheila Lance, Bill and Pat Dougherty, Polly Mitchell, Dan Bellay, George and Ann Ojalehto, Jack and Ann Adams, Kay Powell, Pete and Julie Russell, Bev Smedberg and Barbara Polski.\n\nPolly Mitchell\n\nDan Bellay\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nWilliam Byman, 2nd Company passed on 12/13/22\n\nClyde Morris, 6th Company, died on 1/14/23\n\nHenry Miller, 6th Company, died on 12/9/22\n\nWilliam Omberg, 6th Company died on 1/18/23\n\nShane Daniels, 8th Company passed on 11/24/22\n\nJohn JJ Seeberger, 10th Company, died on 12/23/22\n\nVince Panala, 13th Company, passed on 12/31/22\n\nJim Higgins, 17th Company died on 11/4/22\n\nBarbara Ann Fuller, widow of Gran Fuller 22nd Company died on 12/2/22\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nJANUARY-FEBRUARY 2023\n\n■65th REUNION NEWS  Registration for our 65th Reunion will be different from past reunions. This time we will be registering on-line. As soon as the schedule and the prices for events are settled the Class will be notified and registration will start (this will be when those computer savvy grandkids will come in handy). In addition to the All Hands notification all the information for registering will be available on our Class of 1958 web site (1958.usnaclasses.com/default.htm).\n\nIf you have your '58 name tags from previous reunions be sure to bring them with you to the 65th. Disposable name tags will be available, but the old ones are really cool. I'm referring to the name tags, but the same holds for those of us in the Great USNA Class of 58 who will be at the reunion.\n\nWhen you arrive at the Westin Annapolis there will be a Check-in/Hospitality Room where you can check-in and enjoy some hospitality. The plan is to keep a listing there of all those who have checked-in to help us make contact with roommates, Company Mates and Class friends.\n\nOn the Saturday morning of our reunion we will have an opportunity to tour the Terwilliger Center for Student Athletes which is a privately funded 25,000 square foot addition to Ricketts . The primary donor was Ron Terwilliger, Class of 1963, who donated $15,000,000 for the building. An additional $10,000,000 was also donated, mostly by other Academy graduates. This is an outstanding facility and you don't want to miss this tour.\n\nIn the past our reunions were in the fall and always included attending a Navy football game. This time we will have the opportunity to attend a Navy Lacrosse game. The game will be against Lafayette and it should be an exciting game and fun to watch.\n\n■  The normal suspects were augmented by a 10th Company Reunion of Classmates from around the country and Dan Bellay was the after lunch speaker. Those attending were; Jean and Buff Walter, Jackie and Fred Victor, Sally and Dave Sutherland, Pat and JJ Seeberger, Mike Salmon, Kay Powell, Barbara Polski, Dianne and Jake McMicael, Barbara and Eric Mansfield, Harry Hurst, Mickey and Bill Hillsman, Jesse Hernandez, Eileen and Mike Gigio, Jane and Gordon Gerson, Bill Garvey, Linda Gamboa, Lois and Whitey Edwards, Charlie, Brooks, Kan Bellay, and Ann and Jack Adams.\n\nNOTE: Not that we need another reminder of getting older, but it was noted that Mike Salmon is the 9th longest continuous member of the Army-Navy Country Club. (I wonder who the other 8 guys are?)\n\n■ SECNAV  At the Navy  Notre Dame football game Gordon and Jane Gerson visited with the Secretary of the Navy, Carlos Del Toro, USNA Class of 1983. The SECNAV is also a CDR USN (ret) who served 22 years on active duty.\n\n■ HOME IS THE SAILOR, HOME FROM THE SEA  Jim Clement, 19th Company, may very well have logged more sea time than anyone in our Class. For 20 years he has been giving lectures on board cruise ships. 200 cruises so far including 45 to Alaska, 31 Panama Canal transits, 12 cruises around Cape Horn, 10 summer cruises to Norway and about 3 per year to the Caribbean to mention a few. Tough duty but someone has to do it. Pictured below are Jim and his buddy Goofy on a Disney cruise.\n\nInsert photo # 2\n\n■  Jim Higgins and Bill Oliver met 68 years ago when both were assigned to the 17th Company and they have been friends ever since. In March of 2022 Bill and Virginia Oliver visited Jim and Betty Higgins for what turned out to be the last time. Jim passed away in November 2022 at the age of 90.\n\nInsert photo # 3\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS:\n\nBill Fohrman, 11th Company died on 23 September 2022\n\nMarty Donahoe, 21st Company, passed away on 21 August 2022\n\nDavid Wier, 13th Company, passed on 26 July 2022\n\nStanley Chiocchio, 2nd Company died on 6 November 2022\n\nWayne Pulling, 13th Company died on 26 March 2022\n\nTerry Magrath, 24th Company passed on 20 October 2022\n\nPete Jokanovich, 12th Company, died on 6 November 2022\n\nJim Kenney, 6th Company, died on 1 October 2022\n\nJim Higgins 17th Company died on 7 November 2022\n\nPauline Grocki, wife of Chet Grochi, 6th Company died on 27 September 2022\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nNOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2022\n\n■BIRDS HAVE TO FLY, FISH HAVE TO SWIM  One of life's mysteries is why Gordon Gerson, our Class President, went into the Air Force instead of the Navy given that water is his natural habitat. I say that because Gordo continues to amaze with his swimming prowess. At the 2022 National Masters Swimming meet he was the National Champion in the 100 Meter Breast Stroke. And he had 3 seconds and a third in other events in the 85-89 age group.\n\nGordo with more medals for his collection\n\n■ WASHINGTON CLASS OF '58 CHAPTER LUNCHEON  At the July luncheon the guest speaker was Wes Huey, USNA '87, who is the Executive Director, Enterprise Strategy and Communications for the Academy Alumni Association and Foundation. Wes is also a son-in-law of Chuck and Sally Larson. He spoke about a program implemented in 1997 wherein Naval Officers are selected for permanent teaching positions at the Academy. The Naval Academy is authorized to have up to 55 of these Permanent Military Professors who are active duty officers at the rank of O5 and O6. If those selected have a PhD fine, if not they will be sent to school to obtain one. They commit to then serve as Professors at the Academy up until their statutory retirement. The program also authorizes 12 PMPs at the Naval Postgraduate School and 8 at the Naval War College. There is also a Permanent Military Instructor (PMI) program for O4s who have a Masters degree. Those attending the luncheon were Jack and Ann Adams, Dan Belay, John Carty, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Linda Gamboa, Gordon (alias the Fish) and Jane Gerson, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Jess Hernandez, Taylor Keith, Sally Larson, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Rupe MacLane, Kay Powell, Pete and Julie Russell, Mike Salmon, Beverly Smedberg with son Braden, Fred and Jackie Victor and Alice Wiedemann.\n\n■ STATISTICAL DATA FOR THE GRADUATING CLASS OF 1958 (part I)  I know there are those of you out there in readership-land who have been waiting 64+ years for this information so here you are:\n\nThere were 1211 new admissions in the Class of 1958, 7 ex-midshipmen readmitted with our class, 3 turned back from the Class of 1957, 9 more subsequently turned back (whatever that means), 6 ex-midshipmen readmitted with the class of 1959 and advanced to our class and 3 ex-midshipmen readmitted with the Class of 1960 and advanced to our class. That is a total of 1239, but 2 of those ex-midshipmen readmitted with our class were then advanced to the class of 1957 so the input in our class after all that moving around was 1237.\n\nBy June 4th 1958 there had been 21 discharged, 188 others honorably discharged (deficient in studies), 26 honorably discharged (physical reasons), 2 resigned (for conduct), 80 resigned (voluntary), and 4 resigned (voluntary but also deficient in studies). 16 turned back, (15 of which were for deficiency in studies and 1 for a health reason). 337 lost along the way which means we graduated 900, but wait, there was one other Classmate who was in the hospital and he was turned back to the Class of 59 so we graduated 899 who were awarded diplomas and the degree of bachelor of science.\n\n■ STATISTICAL DATA FOR THE GRADUATING CLASS OF 1958 (part II) - So what happened to the 899 of us who graduated? Turns out 13 were physically disqualified for commission and were honorably discharged and 1 was in Bethesda Hospital pending commission at a later date. 5 of the Class were foreign nationals and were commissioned later in their own Navies. The rest of us were commissioned as Officers and Gentlemen on June 4th as follows:\n\nEnsigns (line) 587\n\nEnsigns (CEC) 10\n\nEnsigns (Supply) 28\n\n2nd Lt. Marines 70\n\n2nd Lt.

It was the spring of 1958 and Bruce McCandless, 19th, told Gary he had learned about a training flight a couple of the Navy pilots stationed at the Academy were going to take to Bermuda in one of those UF amphibians they flew us in around the Annapolis area. And the pilots were willing to take along a couple of Mids so Gary and Bruce flew to Bermuda for the weekend. When they got to the plane for the return trip the big boat hull was being filled up with boxes. With the extra weight it took a long run for the plane to get up on the step and into the air, but it did and in due course arrived in Norfolk to clear customs. The customs inspector was an older guy who had his problems getting up the ladder and into the plane and never really did a search. So when the plane returned to Annapolis there were a lot of happy folks waiting for their boxes. Gary and Bruce never knew what was in the boxes, but Bermuda was a duty free port and the booze there was very cheap so???\n\nBruce McCandless in Bermuda circa 1958\n\n■ OLDER AND NOT SO INNOCENT  This one comes from Bud Manazir, 12th. Bud and his wife Paula were on a trip to Hawaii to celebrate their anniversary in May and were at the Royal Hawaiian Hotel for dinner. Bud noticed that this distinguished white haired gentleman in front of him at the hostess desk was wearing a service academy ring. So Bud spoke up and asked about the ring and the young man with the distinguished white haired gentleman said it was a Naval Academy ring and as he walked away he looked back and said his dad was Class of '58. Surprise! The DWHG was Tom Jacobs of 7th Company fame and he lives in Hawaii.\n\nBud Manazir and Tom Jacobs (with the hair)\n\n■MORE FROM THE MERRY MONTH OF MAY  Far, far from Honolulu our Classmates in the Washington DC area gathered for a luncheon. Our Class President Gordon Gerson serves on the Alumni Association of Class Presidents and represents the Classes from the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. As a result he is very up to date regarding what is happening at the Academy and with the Alumni Association He shared his insights at the luncheon about the new Terwilliger Center for Student-Athletes at the Academy, the proposed expansion of the columbarium, and the construction of the new Alumni Headquarters for the Alumni Association. Attending the luncheon were Buff and Jean Walter, Bev Smedberg, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Pete and Julie Russell, Kay Powell, Jess Hernandez, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Linda Gamboa, Dan Bellay and Jack and Ann Adams.\n\n■ WEST COAST PRE-REUNION  Bill and Mickey Hillsman made the trip north from California to Oregon to visit with 10th Companymate Jake McMichael and his wife Dianne. The visit was in the end of April and Bill shared the picture of the happy foursome at this mini-reunion.\n\nThe Hillsmans and the McMichaels\n\n■ SPEAKING OF REUNIONS  Hopefully, as you read this in September you will have made your travel arrangements and your reservations at the Westin Annapolis for the BIG 65th.Getting to Annapolis and getting around Annapolis are two different things however. Transportation in and around Annapolis at our reunions is always a major concern when the planning is being done for the reunions. The Class will be providing transportation to and from the Westin for Class events including events at the Academy, and Company/Batt parties on Friday night. The actual schedule for this transportation is a work in progress and has to wait until all the events are planned and the number of attendees is determined. To help with the transportation planning we need information on those who may not be getting around as well as before and may have special needs. If, for example, you use a walker or a wheelchair or even a cane to get around please contact Rupe MacLean at [email protected] or Dick Buss at [email protected] and let them know your situation.\n\n58 is Great\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nPeggy Brooks, the wife of Charlie Brooks, 17th Company died on 17 May 2022\n\nJay Gallo, 14th Company passed away on 18 May 2022\n\nJim Campbell, 11th Company died on 19 May 2022\n\nRoger Stallkamp, 16th Company died on 23 May 2022\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nJULY  AUGUST 2022\n\n■ 65TH REUNION NEWS  In the Class column in the June issue of Shipmate I suggested that it is time to make your reservations for the reunion. The dates are 13-16 April 2023 and our Reunion Hotel is the Westin Annapolis. The phone number for reservations is 888 627-8994 and the online reservation address for reservations is: https://www.marriott.com/event-reservations/reservation-link.mi?id=1651531010237&key=GRP&app=resvlink For questions about the Westin Annapolis or about making reservations contact Mike Giglio, 10th Company, at [email protected] or 703-751-7956.\n\n■ MORE REUNION NEWS - Now for those who may have forgotten let me comment on the weather in Annapolis in April. The average daily high temperature is 65-68 degrees F and the average daily low is 48-45 degrees F so think cool and breezy. April is also the wettest month in Annapolis with a 36% chance of rain on any given day. So, next April when you come to the 65th Reunion, bring a sweater and/or jacket and don't forget the rain gear.\n\n■ COST PER GRADUATE  In an earlier class column I reported on how much a Midshipman is paid these days which is about 10 times what we were paid. But that amount is only a small part of what it costs the taxpayers for a brand new Navy/Marine Officer after 4 years at Annapolis. According to the Academy PAO the cost for the Class of 2020 was $438,740 per graduate.\n\n■ JUNE 4TH, A DATE TO REMEMBER  Byron Brooks was an enlisted naval aviator (NAP) in the Navy prior to WWII. He was in Torpedo Squadron Five (VT-5) aboard USS Yorktown. On a flight over the Atlantic his plane went down and he was lost at sea.The date was June 4th 1941. William Lawe was also an enlisted man in the Navy. He was assigned to Torpedo Squadron Eight (VT-8) on board USS Hornet as a gunner on a TBF Avenger. During the battle of Midway his plane was shot down and he was killed.The date was June 4th 1942. Their sons, Paul Brooks and Dick Lawe both attended the Naval Academy with the Class of 1958. Moreover both were together in the 22nd Company and both graduated with our Class.The date was June 4th 1958. Paul and Dick both went on to become aviators. Paul in the Navy and Dick in the Marines. Four men, separated by years yet united by love of Country, by fate and by a date to remember; June 4th.\n\n■ WASHINGTON CHAPTER LUNCHEON  Once again Classmates and spouses in the Washington area gathered for an enjoyable luncheon. The speaker for the event was Professor Claude Berube who is the Director of the USNA Museum. Besides managing the museum the Professor teaches classes in history and elective courses such as hands on war gaming, the War of 1812 Naval Tactics (which includes a sailing event), courses about naval battles using ship replicas, etc. If you attend our 65th you might find a visit to the museum very interesting and worth the time. Attending the luncheon were Jack and Ann Adams, Dan Bellay, John Carty, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Linda Gamboa, Gorden and Jane Gerson, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Kay Powell and Bev Smedberg.\n\nJACK ADAMS AND PROFESSOR BERUBE\n\n■ WHEN DID WE BECOME MIDSHIPMEN? - Most of us, if asked that question, would say 28 June 1954, but in fact only 923 of the 1221 in our Class were sworn in on that day. There were 24 more swearing in ceremonies for the other 298 members of our class before our final Classmate took the oath on 17 August. Sometimes it was only a ceremony for 1, but sometimes it was a significant number such as on 6 July when the number was 83. Anybody out there among the 298 who can explain why they missed the big day on 28 June?\n\n■CLOSING RANKS\n\nJim Hocker, 5th Company, died on 26 February 2022\n\nJay Taylor, 1st Company, died on 14 April 2022\n\nDick Keefe, 4th Company, died on 22 April 2022\n\nDave Ault 10th Company, died on 8 May 2022\n\nAlex Martella, 13th Company, died on 1 May 2022\n\nKent Lawrence, 16th Company, died on 12 May 2022\n\nRichard McKelvey, non-grad, died on 5 April 2022\n\nBecky Caldwell, widow of Bob Caldwell 18th Company, passed away on 31 March 2022\n\nSarah Withers, wife of Bill Withers 19th Company, passed away on 27 April 2022\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nJUNE 2022\n\n■ LOST BUT FOUND  It was 1982 and George McNulty, 21st Company, was in Dublin, Ireland to attend a business meeting (he was a civilian by then). He had taken off his Class ring to get cleaned up for dinner and forgot to put it back on. Later when he went to look for the ring it was no where to be found. Fast forward to 2020 and I received an email asking me for George's contact information. I forwarded the request to George and it turned out the inquiry came from a man who was a 15 year old boy back in 1982. He had come across the ring back then and gave it to his mother who put it aside where it remained forgotten until the mother died. The family came across the ring going thru the mother's things and decided to try to find the owner which was how they came to contact our Class Secretary (me). George's daughter contacted the young man, who was now over 50, in Ireland and in due time the ring was sent to George. Our rings don't change size, but sometimes our fingers do so George sent the ring off to Jostens where they resized and polished the ring and replaced the stone which had been damaged in the process. So 40 years after it was lost the ring is back on George's finger where it belongs.\n\nA RING TO REMEMBER\n\n■ REUNION NEWS - Our 65th reunion will be different from previous reunions in several ways. This time we will gather in the Spring (13-16 April 2023) instead of the Fall so no football game. Another difference will be the hotel where we will be staying. This time it will be The Westin Annapolis. The Westin is located on West Street at Westgate Circle. The room rate is $169/night with 13% state and local taxes in addition. Parking is an extra $25/night for self-parking (I am referring to us parking the cars not the cars parking themselves). Reservations can be made by contacting Marriott reservations (they own Westin hotels) at 1-888-627-8994. Reservations opened for booking on May 1st 2022. Be sure to let them know you will be attending the USNA Class of 1958 reunion to get that special rate. 100 rooms have been reserved for us and they will be held until March 17th 2023. One other difference with this reunion. The crowd will be older, more mature, more wiser, etc.\n\n■ 58 BY THE NUMBERS  In the summer of 1954 there were 1221 of us sworn in as Midshipmen in the USNA Class of 1958. During our 4th Class year 14 additional Midshipmen were either turned back or readmitted to our Class. 215 were separated by the end of that first year, 118 due to academic deficiencies, 19 who were physically disqualified, 61 who resigned, 5 who turned back and 12 for other reasons. So by June of 1955 there were 1020 in our Class. During 3rd Class year we added 3 and lost 62 and the total in the Class was down to 961 by June 1956. A year later the number was 909 and at graduation in June of 1958 we were 899 strong.\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS -\n\nTom Barry, 8th Company died on 3 March 2022\n\nTed Driggers, 18th Company died on February 26th\n\nDan Ziegler, 11th Company passed away on 21 February 2022\n\nSam Swart, 3rd Company died on March 4th 2022\n\nCharles Collins, passed on 7 February 2022. He started with the Class of '58, but was a non-grad.\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nMAY 2022\n\n■ REUNION  Just a reminder. Our 65th reunion is less than a year away. It will be 13-16 April 2023 to be exact so start your planning.\n\nReunion Time\n\n■ HOW OLD IS OLD? - If you are starting to feel old these days just remember you probably aren't the oldest '58 Classmate. That honor goes to Marty Kuhneman 5th Company who was born on July 7th 1932. And, yes that is right, Marty will soon be turning 90. Actually we have 7 Classmates who will turn 90 this year.\n\n■ CHAPTER NEWS  We often get reports from the Washington DC Class of '58 Chapter and sometimes we also hear from the San Francisco area Chapter, but we don't often hear from the New Zealand Chapter. I'm referring to Art Bass, 2nd Company who has been living in NZ since 1980. After graduation Art served on two DDs and then had a tour as the Chief Engineer on an ice breaker which led to a visit to NZ which led to Art meeting his wife to be Gaynor (Art recalls that 85% of the bachelors on board applied for marriage licenses in NZ). Following that tour Art resigned his Regular Commission and started a second career working for the Navy as a civilian and also serving in the Reserves. In 1980 he retired and moved to New Zealand where life has been an exciting adventure. Presently Art and Gaynor live on the North Island overlooking the sea. Next time you are in NZ drop in and say hello.\n\n■ SUPER SPREADER  Pete Gatje, 24th Company, hosted a family reunion over the holidays. Isn't it nice to see smiling faces instead of a bunch of masks?\n\nThe Gatje family\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nLeroy Haenz, 20th Company, died on 21 September 2021\n\nStephen Guthman, 13th Company, died on 24 January 2022\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nMARCH  APRIL 2022\n\nAs 2021 came to an end our Classmates in the Washington DC area participated in a three- part celebration. The common theme was the Army-Navy football game.\n\n■Before the game  The Washington DC 58ers gathered with USMA class of 58 grads for the annual Army-Navy Classes of 1958 luncheon. The luncheon was held at the ANCC on the 2nd of December in advance of the Army-Navy game. Brad Johnson USMA '58 and Bob Orlosky USNA '64 presented information on the two teams. At that time Army was listed as a 9-point favorite, but both Brad and Bob declared the game would be closer. Attending from the USNA class of 1958 were Buff Walter and his son, Fred and Jackie Victor, Phil Taylor and his daughter and son-in-law, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Linda Gamboa, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Paul and Carolyn Brown, Dan Bellay and Jack and Ann Adams.\n\nBrad Johnson and Bob Orlosky\n\n■ During the game  On the 11th of December about 40 Class of 1958 classmates, spouses and friends gathered at the Crystal City Sports Pub in Arlington VA to watch the game and have a good time. Pictured below left to right are: 1st row  Marty Hill, Joan MacLean, Nancy Hill, Ann Adams and Kay Powell; 2nd row  Barbara Mansfield, Lynn Keith, and Eileen Giglio; and 3rd row  Eric Mansfield, Taylor Keith, Rupe MacLean, Jack Adams and Mike Giglio.\n\nChristmas comes early in Arlington\n\n■After the game  41 Classmates and spouses in the Washington DC area turned out for the annual Class of 1958 Christmas luncheon at the Army-Navy club and to celebrate Navy's victory over Army. Good food, nice holiday decorations and music to sing carols by presented by Polly Mitchell and Dan Bellay.\n\nPolly Mitchell and Dan Bellay\n\nNote: There have been lots of changes at the Naval Academy since the Class of 1958 graced the halls of Mother Bancroft. If you have any questions about the Academy in 2022 drop me a note, an email or call and I will try to find an answer. I'll start this with a question of my own.\n\n■What are Midshipmen paid in 2022? - When we were Midshipmen we received $111/month which was half the base pay of an Ensign. In 2022 the Mids are paid 35% of the base pay of an O1, but that amounts to $1217/month. (That adds up to more than $58,000 over 4 years in addition to tuition, room and board). Everything is not free however. From their pay Midshipmen are charged for uniforms, books, and a variety of other charges. Some examples are life insurance ($25/month for a $400,000 policy), barber shop ($26.55/month for males and a few dollars more for females), laundry and dry cleaning ($76.10/month), tailor shop ($30.65/month), Midshipmen activities ($30-$40/month depending on Class), USNA Athletic Association ($288/year), etc. In terms of actual cash the plebes get $125/month, 3/c get $225, 2/c get $325 and 1/c get $500. And of course most Midshipmen will graduate with a nice nest egg the Academy has saved for them. For more information there is a Commandant of Midshipmen Instruction titled Midshipman Stipend and Annual Budget Book that you can find on the internet.\n\n■Closing Ranks:\n\nLes Troolin, 20th Company, died on 1 December 2021\n\nLeroy Haenze, 20th Company, died on 12 September 2021\n\nFrank Herrin, 11th Company, passed away on November 10th\n\nJohn Goolsby 12th Company, passed away on November 25th\n\nJames Hoerle 20th company died on December 24th.\n\nJan Cook 15th Company died on November 25th\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nJANUARY-FEBRUARY 2022\n\n■10TH COMPANY STRONG\n\nThe 10th Company held their annual reunion from 19 to 24 September 2021. 21 Classmates, wives and widows attended. Mike and Eileen Giglio hosted an Austrian themed buffet dinner to begin the week. (Mike didn't report on the menu, but I'm guessing it was something like Wiener Schnitzel, beer, Goulash, beer, Spaetzle, beer, Tafelspitz (boiled beef) and more beer. But everyone doesn't drink beer in Austria so probably there was wine and schnapps as well. Prost!) Most of the week was spent in the Alexandria area, but on one day everyone went to Annapolis where an inurnment ceremony was held for Lee Meador and Betty Sutherland at the Columbarium followed by lunch at the Severn Inn. Those attending (L to R in the picture) were Eileen and Mike Giglio, Margareta MacGregor, Pat Doss, Shirley Ford, Bill Hillsman, Jake McMichael, Mickey Hillsman, Pat Seeberger, Sally Sutherland, Kay Powell, Dave Sutherland, Bonnie Venable, Dave Ault, Bob Venable, Bill and Alice Garvey and Dianne McMichael and Norine Ault kneeling in front. Harlow Manahan and Polly Mitchell missed the picture. As Mike noted; memories of years gone by and a new reminder to treasure.\n\n10th Company Reunion\n\n■ GREATER DC CHAPTER LUNCHEON\n\nAnother very enjoyable chapter luncheon was held on September 30th at the Army-Navy Club. Rupe MacLean spoke about executing the American Loop. This is a boat cruise north along the east coast of America, up the Hudson river, across the Great Lakes, through canals to reach the Mississippi river, down to the gulf, around Florida and up the inter-coastal waterway to home. Rupe did the planning, purchased a 43 ft cruiser and was set to go, but health issues prevented execution of the plan. However ift makes a great story and as Rupe's son said a great adventure trip, just 10 years too late. Attending the luncheon were Jackie and Fred Victor, Julie and Pete Russell, Kay Powell, Barb and Paul Polski, Barb and Eric Mansfield, Joan and Rupe MacLean, Taylor Keith, Marty Hill, Jess Hernandez, Eileen and Mike Giglio, Jane and Gordon Gerson, Lois and Whitey Edwards, John Carty, Dan Bellay and Ann and Jack Adams.\n\nIf any of our Classmates has made the American Loop trip or a similar adventure please send me your story to share.\n\nJack Adams with Joan and Rupe MacLean\n\n■ TRADITION AT THE ACADEMY\n\nIn a previous Shipmate column I commented on changing traditions at the Academy. Ralph Buck 23rd Company, wrote to share his thoughts on the subject. Ralph noted that tradition can be defined as a set of beliefs and values or as an established ritual and both definitions apply to what we think of as the traditions at the Naval Academy. Ralph also pointed out that traditions can change and should be changed if they alienate or disrespect a part of the community. For example if a community changes new members may feel excluded by an old tradition. But don't cancel or change a tradition if everyone in the community is included and it affirms the core values of the group. Instead honor and celebrate it because there is real beauty and value to be found in tradition. Thank you Ralph for your input.\n\nNote: In years past change in society was slow sometimes happening over generations, but now changes in the world we live in are constant and rapid. In this brave new world it can be hard to hang on to traditions that we have lived with and cherish.\n\n■ FAREWELL SERVICE\n\nChuck Smith reported that he, Lance Massey, John Davis, and Mike Chapple attended the funeral Mass for Joe Fenick in El Cajon California on 21 October 2021. They are pictured below with Joe's widow Madelyn Fenick. Tom Fleming represented the Class of '58 at the service at Miramar National Cemetery which was held on 26 October 2021.\n\nMadelyn Fenick with Lance Massey, John Davis, Chuck Smith and Mike Chapple\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nGeorge Kenefick, 1st Company, died on 10 October 2021\n\nKenneth Mitchell, 10th Company, died on 29 August 2021\n\nCurt McGaffin, 14th Company, died on 2 October 2021\n\nJoe Fenick, 7th Company, died on 4 October 2021\n\nDavis Matheny, non-grad, died on 14 September 2021\n\nGail Moran, widow of Michael Moran, 24th Company, died on 29 August 2021\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nNOVEMBER-DECEMBER 2021\n\n■MOLLIE HEMINGWAY  Bill Hemingway, 18th Company, wrote to report that his daughter-in-law, Mollie Hemingway, was a 2021 winner of the Bradley Prize which is awarded in recognition of her extraordinary talent and dedication to restore, strengthen and protect the principles and institutions of American exceptionalism. Mollie is a senior editor of the Federalist (an online magazine), a senior journalism fellow at Hillsdale College and a Fox News contributor. She is also the author of the national best-seller Justice on Trial: The Kavanaugh Confirmation and the Future of the Supreme Court. Her latest book Rigged: How the Media, Big Tech and the Democrats Seized our Elections went on sale in October.\n\nMollie Hemingway\n\n■COM58 AND SECNAV  The new Secretary of the Navy is Carlos del Toro a retired Navy Commander and a member of the USNA Class of 1983. He was born in Cuba and came to the United States as a young boy. Gordon Gerson came to know SecNav while both were serving as Class Presidents and they recently met again at a Parade at the Academy. Gordo did not which of them was the honored guest at the Parade?\n\nThe Secretary of the Navy and our Class President\n\n■ POINDEXTER CLAN  John sent the picture of his family gathered to celebrate he and Linda's 63rd Anniversary. Two of the four sons in the picture graduated from the Academy. Mark was Class of '85 and Tom Class of '92. Another son, Alan, who did not attend the Academy was a Navy Aviator and also a NASA Astronaut with two missions in space. Alan was a Navy Captain and Dean of Students at the Naval Postgraduate School when he died in an accident.\n\nThe Poindexter Clan\n\n■ DC CHAPTER LUNCHEON  Have you ever wondered why our Classmates who attend luncheons in the DC area refer to themselves as the GREATER DC CHAPTER? Are they referring to the number of attendees or the geographical area or is it something else that is greater? I wonder? Anyway their most recent luncheon was in July (for the latest up to date news be sure to read our class column). The guest speaker was Captain Donald Kennedy who spoke about the actions the Academy had to take to deal with the COVID problem. On-line instruction last year, graduating the Class of 2020 (5 separate ceremonies), inducting the Class of 2024, bringing the Brigade back to the Academy, etc. Attending the luncheon were Jack and Ann Adams, Dan Bellay, John Carty, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Mike and Eileen Giglio, Taylor and Lynn Keith, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Paul and Barbara Polski, Kay Powell, Mike Salmon, Phil and (son) Tim Taylor, and Buff, Jean and (son) Rich Walter.\n\nCaptain Donald Kennedy and Jack Adams\n\n■MORE HEMINGWAY NEWS  Bill and his wife Kathy celebrated their 58th wedding Anniversary on 6 July. He noted that he and Bill Bauer, who also celebrated his 58th wedding Anniversary this last summer, were both in the 18th Company and both went into the Marines. SEMPER FIDELIS\n\n■ KEEPING IN TOUCH  Gene Porter, 21st Company, attended a vintage boat show in Idaho and decided to visit his old roommate Marty Donahoe who lives in Salt Lake City. Marty resides in a senior living center, but is in pretty good shape. They had lunch, talked about the old days and enjoyed each other's company which is the way it should be.\n\nMarty and Gene\n\n■CLOSING RANKS\n\nRay Hardy, 13th Company, died on April 1st 2021\n\nMary Hardy, Ray's widow, died on May 8th 2021\n\nJames Corder, 3rd Company, died on May 21st 2021\n\nJohn Wells, 19th Company, died on July 21st 2021\n\nTed Smedberg, 19th Company, died on August 7th 2021\n\nRuss Mowery, 21st Company, died on August 9th 2021\n\nCarl Triebes, 8th Company, died on August 28th 2021\n\nKen Mitchell, 10th Company, died on August 29th 2021\n\nJohn Daniel Haney, 16th Company, died on September 14th 2021\n\nJD Peters, 13th Company, died on September 20th 2021\n\nRay Bumgardner, 22nd Company passed away on December 31st 2020\n\nNancy Stremic, widow of Tony Stremic, died on July 28th 2020\n\nUSNA CLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nOCTOBER 2021\n\n■ CLASS ATHLETIC LEGENDS\n\nIn the last couple of Class columns I have listed 4 of our 6 Classmates who were nominated as Class of '58 Athletic Legends. Here are the final 2 from that list:\n\nTony Stremic, 20th Company\n\n* Wrestling Team (co-Captain)\n\n* Undefeated in wrestling meets\n\n* Football Team\n\n* Most Valuable Lineman, 1958 Cotton Bowl\n\n* 2nd Team All American\n\nAl Swanson, 21st Company\n\n* Basketball (team Captain), Football Team, Track Team\n\n* 7 Ns, 6 N stars\n\n■ CLASS ATHLETIC LEGEND (2021 VERSION)\n\nGordon Gerson, 11th Company, our Class President participated in the 2021 National Short Course Masters Swimming Championships. The meet was held in Greensboro, North Carolina from 21 to 25 July. Gordo came in first in both the 100 Backstroke and the 200 Backstroke, and third in the 50 Backstroke. He also finished 5th in 100 Breaststroke and 200 Breaststroke and 6th in the 50 Breaststroke. WAY TO GO GORDO!!!\n\nNational Swimming Champion\n\n■ HAPPY ANNIVERSARY\n\nBill Bauer, 18th Company, and his bride Judy celebrated their 58th Wedding Anniversary on 6 July 2021. Is 58 great or what?\n\n\"Bill and Judy Bauer\n\n■ EARLY WARNING!!! HERE COMES '58\n\nBy 1959 those of us who went into Navy Air had moved on to Advanced Training. Several of the Class were assigned to the S2 pipeline and expected to be assigned to Anti-Submarine squadrons flying the S2F. But the Navy had other ideas and 6 of the 58ers received orders to Airborne Early Warning Squadron-12 (VAW-12) home-based in Quonset Point RI. The reason was that VAW-12 was receiving the E2 which was the S2 with a very big radar antenna on top. The six were Mike Woodbury, Hugh Palmer, Mike Frawley, Dave Stubbs, Jack Dittrick and Fred Victor who provided me with all this information. VAW-12 was unusual in the sense that the Squadron had 40 aircraft that were divided into 4 plane detachments which were assigned to Atlantic Fleet CVAs and CVSs. The E1s and later the E2s would go on to become an important element in early warning and vector control of carrier fighters and attack aircraft and our six intrepid airmen from the Class of '58 played a vital role in implementing these advances in carrier aviation.\n\nE1s in Formation\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nJames Lyons, 6th Company, died on 30 June 2021\n\nRalph Carestia, 20th Company, died on 8 July 2021\n\nFrank Gamboa, 17th Company, passed away on 8 July 2021\n\nJames Silldorff, 5th Company, died on 1 January 2020\n\nWilliam Geoghegan, non-grad, died on 14 June 2021\n\nCLASS OF 1958 SHIPMATE COLUMN\n\nSEPTEMBER 2021\n\n■IN THE LINE OF DUTY\n\nIn recent issues of Shipmate I have outlined the deaths of our Classmates who died in the line of duty. There were 28 of them and the last of the 28 to report on was CDR Jack Hoel USN, 6th Company. Jack died on 11 September 1974. At the time Jack was the Commanding Officer of the USS John Calhoun (SSBN-630) Blue crew. He was returning to his ship from a trip to Washington DC when the Eastern Airlines DC-9 he was traveling on crashed on approach to Charlotte, NC.\n\nOf the 28 Classmates who died in the line of duty 20 were USN Officers, 5 were USAF Officers and 3 were Marine Officers. 22 of the 28 who died were pilots or flight officers. 3 of the 28 were killed in action (KIA).\n\n■ CLASS ATHLETIC LEGENDS\n\nEach Class President was asked to present the names of outstanding athletes from his Class. In the last issue of Shipmate I described the achievements of Harry Hurst and John Griffiths. Here are the achievements of 2 more.\n\nBen Montoya, 5th Company\n\n* Starting pitcher for the Academy Baseball team for 3 years\n\n* Captain of the Baseball team 1st Class year\n\n* Three N's, two N-stars\n\n* Retired Rear Admiral\n\n* Served on the Academy Board of Visitors for 5 years including 2 years as Chairman\n\n* Selected in 2008 by the USNA Alumni Association as a Distinguished Graduate\n\nNed Oldham, 6th Company\n\n* Captain of the Academy Football team\n\n* Starting midfielder for the Lacrosse team\n\n* Scored all 14 points against Army in 14-0 victory in 1957\n\n* Halfback on offense, safety on defense\n\n* Selected for 3rd team All American in Football\n\n* Honorable mention All American in Lacrosse\n\n■ HONORING BEN MONTOYA (PART II)\n\nMike McLane 6th Company recently visited the Submarine Museum in Groton Ct. and as he was looking at some of the new exhibits he came across a large picture of Ben Montoya. Mike was surprised because this was a Submarine Museum and Ben had been a Civil Engineer Corps Officer. Turns out this was an exhibit about the contributions of hispanic/latino Officers and Ben made a very large contribution to the Navy during his active duty career and in retirement.\n\nRADM Ben Montoya USN\n\n■ WEDDING BELLS\n\nBud Manazir, 12th Company, happily reported his marriage on the 22nd of May 2021 to the beautiful Paula Jane Jacobs and is looking forward to introducing her to the Class at our 65th reunion.\n\nBud and Paula Jane Manazir\n\n■ IN THE WORDS OF JACK ADAMS, HALLELUJAH!!!\n\nThe DC Chapter of the Class of 1958 gathered on 28 May for the first get together in over a year and over 30 Classmates, spouses and friends were present. The guest speaker was RADM Samuel Cox, USN (ret), Class of '80, who is the Director of the Naval Historical and Heritage Command and Director of Navy History and Curator of the Navy. He gave an inspiring presentation explaining how history can provide real lessons for current policy makers. In his talk he linked Classmates from the Class of '58 and parents of Classmates to historic events and noted how our Class's continuing supportive efforts for the USNA Museum is so important.\n\nThose attending were Buff and Jean Walter, Fred and Jackie Victor, Mike Salmon, Pete and Julie Russell, John Rohrbaugh, Kay Powell, Eric and Barbara Mansfield, Roger and Kathy Lyons, Bob and Shelia Lance, Marty and Nancy Hill, Gordon and Jane Gerson, Whitey and Lois Edwards, Bill and Pat Dougherty, Charlie Brooks, Dan Bellay, Jack and Ann Adams plus guests from the Class of '80.\n\nJack Adams and RADM Samuel Cox\n\n■ MEANWHILE BACK AT HILTON HEAD\n\nLee Polhill, 19th Company reported that he, Pete Westphal, 1st Company Pete Berg, 18th Company, George Stubbs, 17th Company and Bill Pendley, 3rd Company met for lunch at Hudson's on the Dock on Hilton Head Island. Since this is not the first time this group has gathered at Hudson's I decided to do a little research. Turns out that Hudson's started out as an Oyster Factory in 1912 and evolved into the present day restaurant. They serve about 450,000 oysters a year and 70,000 lb of shrimp so they must be doing something right. If you want to find out what keeps bringing them back you can order Hudson's Cookbook and/or Hudson's Seasoning on line.\n\nPete B., George, Pete W., Bill and Lee from the left\n\n■ CLOSING RANKS\n\nJack Petit, 7th Company passed away on the 11th of June\n\nMike Cunningham, 18th Company died on 21 June.\n\nJULY-AUGUST 2021\n\n■THEN AND NOW\n\nTHEN  In 1970 the Class of '58 participated in the Annual Homecoming activities at the Academy. On Friday the 9th of October we joined other Alumni for a reception in Dahlgren Hall and dinner in the Mess Hall and on Saturday attended the football game. Then on that Saturday night we had our annual Class Homecoming dinner party. The party was held at the Royal restaurant on West Street with drinks and light hors d'oeuvres followed by a roast beef dinner. The cost was $10 and that was for a couple, but did not include drinks.\n\nNOW  Our Class leadership is starting to think about our next Class reunion which will be our 65th and will be held in the spring of 2023. It just takes a bit longer to organize things these days. Oh, and don't expect dinner to pay $10 (per couple) for dinner this time.\n\n■ IN THE LINE OF DUTY\n\nLCDR Guy (Sam) Houston USN, 12th Company, died in November 1969 serving with Carrier Air Wing 3 on board the USS Saratoga while deployed in the Mediterranean. Sam was participating in flight maneuvers at the time of the accident.\n\nLCDR Keith Rasmussen, USN, 24th Company, died on October 19th 1971. Keith was piloting an E-2B over the Sea of Japan when his plane collided with an A-7. All five members of Keith's crew perished in the crash. Both planes were operating from the USS Midway and entering the landing pattern at the time of the collusion.\n\nIn the January-February 2021 Class column I reported on the death of LT Bruce Wilhelmy in 1966. Dick Buss, a Companymate of Bruce from the 20th Company, sent in some additional information regarding Bruce and the fatal accident. At the time of his accident in 1966 Bruce was doing an acceleration run at 28,000 feet when the wings came off the plane. Investigators determined that an exhaust leak had caused Bruce to lose consciousness from carbon monoxide fumes and the plane went out of control at high speed.\n\nDick also noted that Bruce received the Distinguished Flying Cross for obtaining low level photos over Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.\n\n■ CLASS ATHLETIC LEGENDS\n\nThe Alumni Association has asked Class Presidents to present names of outstanding athletes in their classes. In the next several columns I will list our Classmates nominated for this honor. Let's start with:\n\nHarry Hurst, 7th Company.\n\n* Plebe football, basketball and baseball\n\n* Varsity football\n\n* 3 N's, 2 N stars\n\n* AP back of the week for gaining 137 yards on 9 carries for 2 touchdowns against William and Mary\n\n* Set Navy record for three touchdown receptions in one game.

In both theses cases they were victims of circumstances outside their control.\n\nLCDR Alan Hospes, USN, (2nd Company), died on the 31st of July 1969. At the time Al was assigned to VA-36 and stationed at NAS Cecil Field. On the 31st he was flying an A-4C on a training flight when fate intervened. During a practice bombing run the engine flamed out and Al ejected however the chute did not open.\n\nCAPT Wilbur Wright, USAF, (18th Company), died on October 9th 1969. At the time Will was an electronics warfare officer with the 93rd Bombing Wing stationed at Castle AFB. He was a crew member on B-52Fs and at the time of his death he was on a training flight. The plane was conducting night time practice touch and go landings and overran the runway, crashed and exploded on impact. All 6 crew members perished in the crash.\n\n■ CLASS OF '58 WEBSITE\n\nIf you haven't checked lately I recommend you visit our Class Website. It is full of information of interest. The Website was created by Poj Walters and Fred Victor around the time of our 45th reunion and is now maintained by Fred Victor, 11th Company, and he does an outstanding job. The Home page has current information such as the names of recently deceased Classmates and wives. You can click on a name there and access an obituary for that person. At the left of the Home page is a list of other sections of the Website you can visit.News/Events is especially useful in the run up to reunions for example. Also in this section is a link to the comprehensive guidelines for preparing and administering obituaries that Terry Cooper put together a couple of years ago and is still relevant today.Shipmate has our Class of '58 columns from Shipmate.Photo Gallery has pictures (surprise).Roster has an up to date Class roster.Binnacle List has reports of Classmates who are ill.Last Call has obits for deceased Classmates and wives.Board of Trustees lists your Class Officers and Company Reps lists the Company Representatives and Assistant Company Representatives.Links for '58ers and Fleet Link have links to other websites of interest. One important note about the website. Fred does a great job and deserves a lot of credit, but he depends on all of us to provide him with the information that goes into the website. For example, if you move, change your phone number or email address be sure to let Fred know. Also, any info and/or pictures from trips or special events in your lives that you would like to share would be welcome.\n\nOur Class of '58 Website address is http://1958,usnaclasses.com/default.htm.\n\n■ THE ONLY THING THAT IS CONSTANT IS CHANGE\n\nThat observation was made by an ancient Greek philosopher by the name of Heraclitus. Another example of how right he was is June Week at the Naval Academy. Only now it is called Commissioning Week and it takes place in May. So let me ask for an opinion poll. Can you think of a good reason for the changes? Does there need to be a good reason for changing a tradition? Is tradition a good thing in the military? Send your opinions "
