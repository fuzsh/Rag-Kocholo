        "text": "Martin\n\nThe photo comes from the 1917 edition of the Royal Scots Fusiliers magazine, and there is another photo on the same page of the NCOs of 3rd RSF taken two months later - I'll scan the whole page in as high a resolution as I can, and e-mail you a copy. I'm happy to e-mail copies to anyone else who contacts me with their e-mail address.\n\n3rd RSF was a common destination for wounded officers and NCOs of the 2 regular battalions of the RSF who were doing \"light duty\" whilst recovering from wounds. After a year as a private in the 5th Scottish Rifles, my grandfather (see avatar) did his officer training at Camp Fort Mitilda with 3rd RSF in December 1915 - March 1916, and then was back there in the winter of 1916/17 recovering from being wounded on the Somme (at Bezantin Ridge, 18th July 1916), before returning to 1st RSF as a 2nd Lieut, acting-captain, commanding A company, including at 3rd Ypres (at Zonnebeke, Battle of Polygon Wood, Sept 1917).\n\n[utterton-Kelso (born 1893) is mentioned in \"General Jack's Diary\", edited by John Terraine, where in 1918 he is back with 2nd RSF as their rather young Lieut Colonel, before being badly wounded (again) on October 5th. After the war he returned to command 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers as a Lieut. Colonel, (and ended up as a Major-General in WW2, eventually dying in 1972).]\n\nWilliam\n\nHi William, RE: Routine order No-314\n\nWondering if you could put me in the right direction please, I have been clearing my Fathers estate and I came across a handwritten letter dated August 21st 1914, it is a routine order by Col, A M Forbes\n\ncommanding 1st Batt Royal Scots Fusiliers, itemising various duties, Signed by R S Kentish, CC by J E Utterson Kelso Names mentioned in the letter are,\n\nOrderly Officer Lt D P Martin\n\nMajor F T V Dumne /Dunne\n\nR S Kentish\n\nJ E utterson Kelso. appologies for not being able to make out ranks of the above.\n\nThere is also an \" Appreciation letter, to be read out to all ranks under ( looks like Colonel ) A M Forbes.\n\nIt states \" The following letter from GD C ( looks like) 76th or 16th Infantry Pade to A M Forbes has been received\n\nand should be read out to all ranks,\n\nThe letter states...\n\n\" Dear Forbes,\n\n( cant make out the first line it is on a fold in the paper)\n\nContinues:::\n\nthe splendid and most loyal support and help you gave at a very critical moment of the operations and from the time that you came under my command\n\nuntil you left it. nothing could be finer than the work of , firstly the to boys that went up and took over the front line and subsequently the other two that\n\nwent up under my command, I appreciate to the full what your regiment did for me, and I can assure you I shall not forget the part it played whilst writing my report.\n\nI have written to General Williams ( GDC 8th Batt) and I hope you will convey what I have written to your Officers and men.\n\nTo see them at work on the advanced lines as I saw them Saturday morning was certainly in keeping with the traditions ********* action of your regiment, and there\n\nare not many Officers who would have grasped the situation as quickly as Cpt W J Cranston, and who, by his personal example did so much to keep the ground\n\nthat we had won.\n\nI am grateful to you all,\n\nyous Sincerely\n\nR S Kentish,\n\n( )--J E Utterson Kelso\n\nAdjt, 1st Batt Royal Scots Fuseliers.\n\n********************************************************************\n\nMy interest stems from , William J Cranston was my great great grandfather , Having now received the above letter I would absolutely love\n\nto learn some more information regarding this.\n\nIt would be greatly appreciated if you could help, or just point me in the right direction\n\nto further my knowledge, should you require my e-mail address it is, b.j.h@hotmail.co.uk.\n\nVery best Regards.\n\nRob.\n\nHi Rob,\n\nCharles has anticipated me - there is no mention of Cranston in the 1st Royal Scots Fusiliers war diary for August 1914, but on 18th August 1916, on the Somme, 2/Lt. W.J. Cranston is mentioned as \"Capt. Cranston\", so clearly in command of a company at the time.\n\nIn the Army list for 1917, W.J. Cranston is a Lieutenant (from 29 Dec 1916) and has been attached to 13th Battalion the Liverpool Regiment, and then I'm sure that Charles is right about his subsequent career.\n\nI will transcribe the war diary entry for you, and message you privately.. I didn't find any photos of him in the Regimental magazines, unfortunately.\n\nThere might be a Service Record for him in the National Archives at Kew, but these are not currently available online as far as I know - you have to go to Kew in person (or get someone else to to go and copy it for you.\n\nWilliam"
