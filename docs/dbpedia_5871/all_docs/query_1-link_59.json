However, restrictions on access apply to some records, in view of the sensitivity of their contents. Some personal letters are restricted while the author is still living and may be read only with the author's written permission. Some material is reserved. In the College's opinion the contents of these files might be considered confidential or offensive by living people other than the author. There is no access to these files for the time being. Records with restricted access are noted throughout the catalogue."
