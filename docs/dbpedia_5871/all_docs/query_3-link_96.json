Behavioral economics uses facts, models, and methods from neighboring sciences to establish descriptively accurate ﬁndings about human cognitive ability and social interaction and to explore the implications of these ﬁndings for economic behavior. The most fertile neighboring science in recent decades has been psychology, but sociology, anthropology, biology, and other ﬁelds can usefully inﬂuence economics as well. The Roundtable Series publishes books in economics that are deeply rooted in empirical ﬁndings or methods from one or more neighboring sciences and advance economics on its own terms—generating theoretical insights, making more accurate predictions of ﬁeld phenomena, and suggesting better policy.

These courses develop economic models to address real world problems using a series of mathematical problem-solving exercises. The book is intended for readers not only interested in a synthesis of contemporary social science reasoning applied to problems of economic institutions and behavior but also wanting to learn the basic modeling skills necessary to participate—as a user or a producer—in further development of the ﬁeld. The book is intended for use in graduate-level microeconomics courses, as well as courses in institutional and evolutionary economics and formal modeling courses in sociology, anthropology, and political science. It could also be used in advanced undergraduate courses in these subjects. General readers may ﬁnd the book a useful introduction to the emerging paradigm of evolutionary social science. Little previous exposure to economics is presumed. The mathematical techniques are limited to what is generally covered in a two-semester calculus sequence. The book originated long ago when over a period of years I taught the advanced microeconomic theory course to doctoral candidates at Harvard University. While the content of the course reﬂected the thenunquestioned neoclassical model, seeds of doubt were nurtured in long discussions with my co-teachers, Wassily Leontief, Tibor Scitovsky, and David Kendrick, as well as from reﬂection on our students’ often puzzled reactions to the material. The difference between the text published based on that course (Bowles, Kendrick, and Dixon 1980) and this book measures the distance traveled by economic theory in the intervening decades. But the two books share a common emphasis on the importance of acquiring basic modeling skills through exposure to intellectually challenging yet mathematically tractable problem-solving exercises. The extensive problem sets at the end of this book offer practice in developing these skills as well as examples of applications of the theory to important real world problems. In the body of the text I have italicized frequently used terms where they are ﬁrst introduced (and deﬁned) in the text (the deﬁnitions can be located by consulting the index). To reduce footnote clutter, I have gathered extensive suggestions for readings on\n\nx\n\n•\n\nPreface\n\nrelated subjects at the end of the book. The epigraphs that open each chapter serve to remind you that the problems addressed in these pages have been around for a while and probably will not be fully resolved anytime soon, and that they extend far beyond economics. (If you suspect the authors of the epigraphs are among those with whom I conduct imaginary conversations, you would not be far wrong, though I would not want to invite them all to dinner on the same evening!) I draw on recent developments in evolutionary economics, game theory, the theory of economic institutions, behavioral and experimental economics, and other contributions to microeconomics. While the tools of analysis are from economics (with some borrowing from biology), the subject matter is nondisciplinary, augmenting the usual economic subject matter with concerns of culture, power, asymmetric social relationships, social networks, and norms. I also make considerable reference to empirical studies, beginning each chapter with an empirical puzzle that an adequate theory should be able to address. I do this both because economic theory beneﬁts from the challenge of illuminating real world problems, and to ground the assumptions of the models in what is known about actual human behaviors and institutions. While the exercise of power in the economy plays an important role in the models I develop, the need to limit the length of the book has precluded more than passing attention to governments and other centralized allocation processes, and political decision making. Many of the ideas presented here were developed jointly with Herbert Gintis (especially those in chapters 8, 9, 10, and 14). His text in game theory (Gintis 2000) constitutes a valuable complement to this book. Important contributions to these pages have also come from my graduate students at the University of Massachusetts, whose suggestions and criticisms account for many improvements in the text. Some of the material in chapters 11, 12, and 13 draws on my collaboration with Jung-Kyoo Choi, Astrid Hopfensitz, and Yong-Jin Park. I have also beneﬁtted from the comments of the doctoral candidates I have taught at the University of Siena. My teaching assistants over the years—especially Katie Baird, Jung-Kyoo Choi, Minsik Choi, Alper Duman, Christina Fong, James Heintz, Mehrene Larudee, Edward McPhail, Yong-Jin Park, Dori Posel, and Eric Verhoogen—are also responsible for numerous improvements. Comments on the entire manuscript by Kaushik Basu, Greg Dow, Karla Hoff, Suresh Naidu, Ugo Pagano, Peter Skott, and Michael Wallerstein have made the book much better. I am especially grateful to Jung-Kyoo Choi and Elisabeth Wood who read multiple versions of the manuscript, correcting many errors and suggesting important improvements. I have also beneﬁtted from the contributions of Robert Boyd, Steven Burks, Jeffrey Carpenter, Henry Farber, Ernst Fehr, Duncan\n\nPreface\n\n•\n\nxi\n\nFoley, Gerald Friedman, Herbert Gintis, Carol Heim, Jack Hirshleifer, James Jaspers, Arjun Jayadev, Donald Katzner, Richard Lewontin, Mehrene Larudee, Paul Malherbe, John Miller, Karl Ove Moene, Melissa Osborne, Peter Richerson, Ariel Rubinstein, Cosma Shalizi, D.

Economics has gained the title Queen of the Social Sciences by choosing solved political problems as its domain. —Abba Lerner, “The Economics and Politics of Consumer Sovereignty” (1972)\n\nTo its founders, the subject of political economy was the wealth of nations and people. In the fourteenth century, Ibn Battuta, one of the leading geographers and explorers of his age, traveled widely in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Spain. In 1347, he visited the land we now call Bangladesh. “This is a country . . . abounding in rice,” he wrote. He described traveling along its waterways, passing “between villages and orchards, just as if we were going through a bazaar.”1 Six centuries later, a third of the people of Bangladesh are undernourished and the country is among the world’s poorest. At the time of Ibn Battuta’s visit to Bangladesh, Europe was reeling under the impact of the bubonic plague, which took the lives of a quarter or more in many cities. Manual workers in London, probably among the better off anywhere on the continent, consumed fewer than 2000 calories per day.2 The shortage of labor following the plague somewhat boosted real wages through the middle of the next century, but over the next four centuries, real wages of laborers did not rise in The ﬁrst epigraph comes from Robbins (1935:16), the second from Lerner (1972: 259). His account is published in Ibn Battuta (1929:267, 271). A second source (Yule 1886:457) quotes him as observing, “I have seen no region of the earth in which provisions are so plentiful,” but this may be a mistranslation due to Yule or to the French source on which he relied. 2 This account follows Allen (2001). The wage series below can be found at http:// www.econ.ox.ac.uk/members/robert.allen/wagesprices.htm. 1\n\n2\n\n•\n\nPrologue\n\nany European city for which records exist; in most, wages fell by substantial amounts—in Northern Italy to half their earlier level. Over the past two centuries, however, real wages rose dramatically, ﬁrst in England, where they increased ten-fold, and somewhat later but by even greater amounts in other European cities. What accounts for these dramatic reversals of fortune? The most plausible answer, very brieﬂy, runs as follows. The emergence and diffusion of a novel set of institutions that came to be called capitalism brought about a vast expansion in the productivity of human labor. This led to higher wages when workers’ bargaining power was eventually augmented by the expansion of workers’ political rights and by the drying up of the pool of new recruits from agriculture, household production, and other parts of the economy that were not organized according to these new institutions. This happened in Europe and not in Bangladesh. What did happen in Bangladesh, as in much of the Mughal Empire and what became British India, was a growing entrenchment of the power and property rights of powerful landlords. Their inﬂuence was already substantial before the British, but during the Bengal Presidency it was greatly strengthened by the Permanent Settlement of 1793. This act of the colonial rulers conferred de facto governmental powers on the landlords by giving them the right to collect taxes (and to keep a substantial fraction for themselves). The fact that British taxation and land tenure policy was not uniform throughout the Raj provides a natural experiment to test the importance of these institutions for subsequent patterns of backwardness or development. Banerjee and Iyer (2002) compared the post-Independence economic performance and social indicators of districts of modern-day India in which landlords had been empowered by the colonial land tenure and taxation systems with other districts in which the landlords had been bypassed in favor of the village community or direct taxation of the individual cultivator. They found that the landlord-controlled districts had signiﬁcantly lower rates of agricultural productivity growth stemming from lower rates of investment and lesser use of modern inputs. The landlord-controlled districts also lagged signiﬁcantly in educational and health improvements.3 These ﬁndings suggest a remarkable persistence of the effects of an institutional innovation that occurred a century or more earlier. 3 The details of the causal connection between landlord control and these subsequent results remain to be explored. Because colonial practices changed over time in response to exogenous events (such as the revolt by Indian soldiers in 1857) and over space in response to the idiosyncracies of local administrators, Banerjee and Iyer were able to identify independent sources of variation in the land tenure and taxation policies not due to pre-existing conditions.\n\nPrologue •\n\n3\n\nThe effects of institutions on economic performance is further afﬁrmed by a dramatic turn in land tenure in the Indian state of West Bengal.4 Following its election in 1977, the Left Front government of the state implemented a reform under which sharecroppers who registered with the Department of Land Revenue were guaranteed permanent and inheritable tenure in the plots they cultivated as long as they paid the landlord a quarter of the crop. Prior to the reform, the modal landlord’s crop share had been one half, and landlord’s had routinely used the threat of eviction to enhance their bargaining power with the sharecroppers. The cultivators’ increased crop-share signiﬁcantly increased the incentives to work the land productively. The security of tenure had two possibly offsetting effects: it enhanced the cultivators’ incentive to invest in the land, while restricting the ability of the landlord to elicit high levels of output by threat of eviction. A further indirect effect may have also been at work. The increased economic security of the sharecroppers led to their more active participation in local politics; partly as a result, the local councils—the panchayats—became more effective advocates of the interests of the less well-off in the acquisition of agricultural inputs, credit, and schooling. The effects of the reform have been estimated from a comparison of agricultural productivity between West Bengal and neighboring Bangladesh (a similar region in which no such reforms were implemented) and by exploiting the fact that the implementation of the reform (measured by the fraction of sharecroppers registering for its beneﬁts) varied considerably within West Bengal. The resulting estimates are imprecise, and it remains difﬁcult to determine which causal mechanisms were at work, but the effects of the reform appear to have been very substantial: rice yields per hectare on sharecropped land were increased by about ﬁfty percent. Having lagged behind most Indian states prior to the reform, agricultural productivity growth in West Bengal has been among the most rapid since the reform. The enduring importance of institutions is likewise suggested by the work of Sokoloff and Engerman (2000) concerning an analogous New World reversal of fortune. They estimate that in 1700 Mexico’s per capita income was about that of the British colonies that were to become the United States, while Cuba and Barbados were at least half again richer. At the close of the eighteenth century Cuba had slightly higher per capita incomes than the United States, and Haiti was probably the richest society in the world. At the opening of the twenty-ﬁrst century, however, the per capita income of Mexico was less than a third of the United States’, and Haiti’s was lower yet. In a series of papers, Sokoloff 4\n\nThis account is based on Banerjee, Gertler, and Ghatak (2002) and Bardhan (1984).\n\n4\n\n•\n\nPrologue\n\nand Engerman provide the following explanation.5 In the parts of the New World in which sugar and other plantation crops could be grown (Cuba and Haiti) or in which minerals and indigenous labor were abundant (Mexico), economic elites relied on bonded labor or slaves, and consolidated their power and material privileges by means of highly exclusive institutions. These restricted access by the less well-off to schooling, public lands, patent protection, entrepreneurial opportunities, and political participation. As a result, over the ensuing centuries, even after the demise of slavery and other forms of coerced labor, opportunities for saving, innovation, and investment were monopolized by the well-to-do. Literacy remained low, and land holding highly concentrated. As the source of wealth shifted from natural resource extraction of manufacturing and services, these highly unequal economies stagnated while the far more inclusive economies of the United States and Canada grew rapidly. The ways their less exclusive institutions contributed to the success of these North American economies remains somewhat unclear, but a plausible hypothesis is that broader access to land, entrepreneurial opportunities, and human capital stimulated growth. The source of the institutional divergence among the colonies of the New World appears to be their initial factor endowments, more than the distinct cultures or colonial policies of the European states that conquered them. British Belize and Guyana went the way of Spanish Honduras and Colombia; Barbados and Jamaica went the way of Cuba and Haiti. The Puritans who settled Providence Island off the coast of Nicaragua forsook their political ideals and became slave owners. Slaves on the island outnumbered the Puritans when it was overrun by the Spanish in 1641. According to its leading historian, “[T]he puritan settlement . . . with its economy fueled by privateering and slavery looked much like any other West Indian colony” (Kupperman 1993, p. 2). At the time of its demise, Providence Island was attracting migrants from the more famous Puritan colony far to the north; two boatloads of hapless Pilgrims arrived from Massachusetts just after the Spanish takeover. A ﬁnal example is provided by the precipitous collapse of Communist Party rule in the Soviet Union and its Eastern European allies around 1990 and the transition of the new states to market-based economies. Figure P.1, presenting the levels of gross domestic product (GDP) per capita relative to the year 1990 for fourteen of these nations, reveals dramatic differences in their trajectories. After a decade of transition, 5 See also Engerman, Sokoloff, and Mariscal (2002) and Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002).\n\nPrologue •\n\n5\n\n1.6\n\nPoland\n\n1.4\n\nOECD 1.2\n\nHungary\n\nRatio\n\n1.0\n\n0.8\n\nRussia 0.6\n\n0.4\n\nMoldova\n\n0.2\n\n0 1990\n\n1991\n\n1992\n\n1993\n\n1994\n\n1995\n\n1996\n\n1997\n\n1998\n\n1999\n\n2000\n\nYears Bulgaria\n\nPoland\n\nCzech Republic\n\nRomania\n\nEstonia\n\nRussian Federation\n\nHungary\n\nSlovak Republic\n\nKazakhstan\n\nSlovenia\n\nLithuania\n\nCroatia\n\nKyrgyz Republic\n\nOECD average\n\nMoldova\n\nFigure P.1 Divergence of ex-Communist economies’ real GDP per capita (relative to 1990).

Over the same period China’s per capita income more than doubled (not shown). Among these fourteen economies, only Poland out-performed the (unweighted) average of the OECD economies. While the success of China’s gradual reforms has been the subject of extensive study, the differences among the countries undertaking a rapid transition are poorly understood. A possible explanation is that, starting from quite similar institutions, small differences in the content or timing of reform packages or chance events resulted in large and cumulative differences in performance, because some countries (e.g., Hungary and Poland) were able to capture the synergistic effects of institutional complementarities while others were not (Hoff and Stiglitz 2002). Other explanations stress the substantial institutional differences among the countries or their differing levels of trust or other social norms. What is not controversial is that divergences in performance of this magnitude, emerging in less than a decade, suggest both the importance of economic institutions and the pervasive inﬂuence of positive feedback effects, whereby both success and failure are cumulative. I have deliberately chosen cases that dramatize the central role of institutions. Other comparisons would suggest different, or at least less clear-cut conclusions. Over the period 1950–1990, for example, countries with democratic and authoritarian regimes appear to have differed surprisingly little in their overall economic performance (controlling for other inﬂuences) with major differences appearing only in their demographic record, with slower population growth in democracies (Przeworski, Alvarez, Cheibub, and Limongi 2000). Nonetheless, the examples above—the divergence of living standards in Europe from many parts of the world, the reversal in New World fortunes, and the heterogeneous consequences of economic liberalization in the once-Communist nations—are of immense importance in their own right and, as subsequent examples show, are hardly atypical. What can modern economics say about the wealth and poverty of nations and people? No less important, what can it do? Contrary to its conservative reputation, economics has always been about changing the way the world works. The earliest economists—the Mercantilists and the Physiocrats—were advisors to the absolute rulers of early modern Europe; today’s macroeconomic managers, economic development advisors, and architects of the transition from Communism to market-based societies, continue this tradition of real world engagement. Economists have never been strangers to policy making\n\nPrologue •\n\n7\n\nand constitution building. The hope that economics might assist in alleviating poverty and securing the conditions under which free people might ﬂourish is at once its most inspiring calling and its greatest challenge. Like many, I was drawn to economics by this hope. Having been a schoolboy in India and a secondary school teacher in Nigeria before turning to economics, I naturally came to the ﬁeld expecting that it would address the enduring problem of global poverty and inequality. At age eleven I had noticed how very average I was among my classmates at the Delhi Public School—in sports, in school work, in just about everything. A question has haunted me since: how does it come about that Indians are so much poorer than Americans given that as people we are so similar in our capacities? And so I entered graduate school hoping that economics might explain, for example, why workers in the United States produce almost as much in a month as those in India produce in a year, and why the Indian population is correspondingly poor (Hall and Jones 1999). We now know that the conventional economic explanations fail: by any reasonable accounting, the differences in the capital-labor ratio and in the level of schooling of the U.S. and Indian workforces explain much less than half of the difference in productivity. It seems likely that much of the gap results from causes more difﬁcult to measure and, until recently, less studied by economists: differences in historical experience, institutions, and conventional behaviors. These are the subject matter of this book. Alfred Marshall’s (1842–1924) Principles was the ﬁrst great text in neoclassical economics. It opens with these lines: Now at last we are setting ourselves seriously to inquire whether it is necessary that there should be any so called “lower classes” at all: that is whether there need be large numbers of people doomed from their birth to hard work in order to provide for others the requisites of a reﬁned and cultured life, while they themselves are prevented by their poverty and toil from having any share or part in that life. . . . [T]he answer depends in a great measure upon facts and inferences, which are within the province of economics; and this is it which gives to economic studies their chief and their highest interest. (Marshall 1930:3–4)\n\nMarshall wrote this in 1890. I suspect he would be disappointed by the progress economics made towards these lofty aims in the century that followed. The neoclassical paradigm that Marshall helped found was ill-suited to the task he set. Its deﬁning assumptions precluded analysis of many key aspects of economic progress and stagnation, among them the exer-\n\n8\n\n•\n\nPrologue\n\ncise of power, the inﬂuence of experience and economic conditions on people’s preferences and beliefs, out-of-equilibrium dynamics, and the process of institutional persistence and change. Drawing on the contributions of many—economists and others—this book presents a theory of how individual behaviors and economic institutions interact to produce aggregate outcomes, and how both individuals and institutions change over time. It is based on assumptions that are quite different from those that deﬁne the neoclassical paradigm. In what follows, I use the term Walrasian paradigm (for Leon Walras [1834– 1910], another of the founders of neoclassical economics) in preference to the more open-ended term “neoclassical.” By Walrasian I mean that approach to economics that assumes that individuals choose actions based on the far-sighted evaluation of their consequences based on preferences that are self-regarding and exogenously determined, that social interactions take the exclusive form of contractual exchanges, and that increasing returns to scale can be ignored in most applications. With some reﬁnement, these assumptions account for the distinctive analytical successes and normative orientation of the Walrasian approach. The term paradigm refers to the core subject matter taught to students. The approach developed here retains many of the fundamental tenets of the Walrasian paradigm and of the classical school that it superceded. Among these are a familiar triplet of ideas: that when individuals act they are trying to accomplish something; that intentional action is constrained by the effects of competition; and that the aggregate outcomes of large numbers of individuals interacting in this manner are typically unintended. These tenets have provided the foundation for the development of economics since its inception, and account for its many analytical insights. Other aspects of the Walrasian paradigm, however, are replaced. The Walrasian approach represents economic behavior as the solution to a constrained optimization problem faced by a fully informed individual in a virtually institution-free environment. Robbins’ celebrated deﬁnition of the subject (in the epigraph) reﬂects this equation of economics with constrained optimization. The passage of time is represented simply by a discount rate; people do not learn or acquire new preferences over time; institutions do not evolve. The actions of others are represented by nothing more complicated than a given vector of market-clearing prices, while proximity is captured by a cost of transportation. Property rights and other economic institutions are represented simply by a budget constraint. An economic actor in this model is roughly Robinson Crusoe, with prices standing in for nature. The economist’s Crusoes inhabit a world in which goods are scarce, but whatever institutions are necessary to coordinate their activities in an\n\nPrologue •\n\n9\n\noptimal manner are freely available. The “supply” of optimal institutions can thus be ignored for the same reason that Adam Smith used to explain why economists need not theorize about the value of water: they are free goods. This description of the Walrasian paradigm is a caricature, of course, but a recognizable one, of the economics taught in leading doctoral programs as recently as the early 1980s. Since then a combination of new analytical tools—especially game theory and information economics—and the increasingly evident empirical inadequacies of the Walrasian model have combined to alter the way economics is taught and practiced. Economic agents no longer interact simply with nature or some other parametric environment, but also with each other, and strategically. Their interactions are no longer fully described by the prices of the goods they exchange because some aspects of their transactions are not expressed in enforceable contracts. Nonetheless, in practice, even as some of the standard Walrasian assumptions are dropped, common tenets of the older paradigm are evident in many of the new approaches. Robert Solow expressed these as “equilibrium, greed, and rationality,” meaning that when economists “explain” something—say, unemployment—they mean that it can be represented as a unique stationary outcome in a model of interactions among self-interested individuals with advanced cognitive capacities and predispositions. Other ways of “explaining” unemployment may be entertained, but this is the default option. Solow’s concern about the adequacy of the trinity of core tenets is increasingly supported by both empirical and conceptual advances. The approach I present here is based on the more modest, but perhaps more enduring, classical tenets of intentional action, competition, and unintended consequences. Just as the Walrasian paradigm assumes a particular kind of social interaction as the standard case—caricatured as Robinson Crusoe above—the approach here is designed to illuminate a generic situation based on the three empirically observed characteristics of structures of social interaction, individual behaviors, and technologies, introduced below. Here I simply outline the salient facts of these generic interactions and point to some important implications. I take up the task of modeling these interactions (and providing some relevant empirical evidence) in the subsequent chapters. Non-contractual social interactions. When individuals interact, it is the exception, not the rule, that everything passing between them is regulated by a complete and readily enforced contract. Instead, noncontractual social interactions are ubiquitous in neighborhoods, ﬁrms, families, environmental commons, political projects, and markets. While many of these noncontractual social interactions take place in non-\n\n10 •\n\nPrologue\n\nmarket settings, they are also important in determining economic outcomes in highly competitive markets. Thus, in the pages that follow, I treat the grocery market with complete contracting—a staple of introductory economics textbooks—as a special case. The generic case is illustrated by labor markets and credit markets, where the promise to work hard or to repay the loan is unenforceable, or local environmental commons problems, where individual resource exploitation imposes noncontractible spillovers on others. A characteristic of markets with incomplete contracts is that one or both participants in a simple dyadic transaction typically receive rents, that is, payments above their next best alternative. In labor and credit markets, some workers and borrowers are unable to transact the quantities they prefer at the going terms of exchange; that is, they are quantity constrained, and the resulting markets do not clear in equilibrium, exhibiting excess supply (e.g., of labor) or excess demand (for loans). If many aspects of economic interactions are not governed solely by contracts, how are they governed? The answer is that noncontractual aspects of interactions are governed by a combination of norms and power. An employment contract does not specify any particular level of effort, but the employee’s work ethic or fear of job termination or peer pressure from workmates may accomplish what contractual enforcement cannot. The idea that power is exercised in competitive market transactions will strike some readers as a commonplace; but to others it will appear a contradiction in terms. To neoclassical economists (like Abba Lerner, in the epigraph), “[A] transaction is a solved political problem.” It is “solved” by the device of complete contracts, so that everything of interest to all parties to a transaction can be enforced by the courts. With all the terms of a transaction contractually speciﬁed, nothing is left for the exercise of power to be about. For the same reason, norms are redundant: if the employee’s contract were to specify a given amount of work for a given amount of pay and if work effort were readily veriﬁable, then the employer would care little about the work ethic of the employees. Relaxing the complete contracting assumption thus not only explains why many markets do not clear, it also reveals an important economic role for both power and norms, bringing the theory closer to the way observers and participants view real world exchanges. Adaptive and other-regarding behaviors. Recent behavioral experiments by economists (conﬁrming and extending earlier work by other social scientists) as well as observation in natural settings suggests a reconsideration of both the “rationality” and “greed” tenets in Solow’s trinity. Individuals intentionally pursue their objectives, but they do this more often by drawing on a limited repertoire of behavioral responses\n\nPrologue •\n\n11\n\nacquired by past experience than by engaging in the cognitively demanding forward-looking optimizing processes assumed alike by the Walrasian approach and by much of classical game theory. In many situations, emotions such as shame, disgust, or envy combine to produce a behavioral response. Moreover, while self-interest is a powerful motive, other-regarding motives are also important. In experiments and in real life, people frequently are willing to reduce their own material well-being not only to improve that of others but also to penalize others who have harmed them or others, or violated an ethical norm. These so-called social preferences help explain why people often cooperate toward common ends even when defection would yield higher material rewards, why incentive schemes based on self-interest sometimes backﬁre, and why ﬁrms do not sell jobs. Thus models whose dramatis personae are simply identical individuals conforming to the self interest axioms of Homo economicus are often unilluminating. For many questions, adequate models must take account of the fact, conﬁrmed in experiments and in natural settings, that people are both heterogeneous—some more self-interested, others more civic minded, for example—and versatile—actions adapting to situations rather than reﬂecting a single, all-purpose behavioral predisposition. As a result of both behavioral heterogeneity and versatility, small differences in institutions can make large differences in outcomes, some situations inducing selﬁsh individuals to act cooperatively and others inducing selﬁsh behaviors by those predisposed to cooperate. Economists have commonly regarded behaviors that violate the stringent canons of formal rationality as idiosyncratic, unstable, or irrational, in short, not exhibiting the regularities that would allow scientiﬁc analysis. But the fact that experimental subjects consistently exhibit such “irrationalities” as intransitivity, loss aversion, inconsistency in temporal discounting, and the overvaluation of low probability events, suggests these behaviors are not only common but also susceptible to analysis. People acquire their behavioral responses in part by copying the behaviors of those who, in similar situations, they perceive as successful by some standard or by acting to maximize one’s gains given one’s beliefs about how others will act. But other inﬂuences are also at work, including conformism and other types of frequency-dependent learning unrelated to the payoffs associated with behaviors. As a result, predictions of behavior based on forward-looking maximization of payoffs may be quite misleading. Moreover, behavioral responses acquired by individuals in one environment are unlikely to be acquired by the same individuals were they to be functioning in an entirely different environment. In this sense, not only individual beliefs (about the consequences\n\n12 •\n\nPrologue\n\nof their actions) but also individual preferences (their evaluations of the outcomes) are endogenous. The “given ends” invoked by Robbins is a useful simpliﬁcation in many analytical tasks but is an arbitrary and misleading restriction in others. Generalized increasing returns. Economic and other social interactions often lead to patterns of what Gunnar Myrdal (1956) termed “cumulative causation,” or what are now called “positive feedbacks.” Positive feedbacks include economies of scale in production, but the term refers more broadly to any situation in which the payoff to taking an action is increasing in the number of people taking the same action. More generic illustrations include, for instance, the fact that the payoff to learning a particular language depends on the number of speakers or that the payoff to engaging in a collective action depends on the number of participants. To distinguish this large class of positive feedback cases from the subset based on increasing returns to scale in production, I will use the term generalized increasing returns rather than increasing returns to scale. Institutional synergies may generate generalized increasing returns. For example, private ownership of property, competitive markets, and the rule of law often implement highly efﬁcient solutions to allocational problems, but only if all three components are present and almost all members of the society adhere to these principles. Generalized increasing returns due to these institutional complementarities appears to be a source of divergence in the growth trajectories of the New World and ex-Communist economies mentioned above. Generalizing increasing returns may help to account for the increase in inequality among the peoples of the world over the past century and a half, despite the catching up of Japan, China, and other East Asian nations.6 These positive feedbacks create economic environments in which small chance events have durable consequences over very long time frames, and in which initial conditions may have persistent so-called “lock-in” effects. The “poverty traps” faced by peoples and nations as well as the “virtuous circles” of afﬂuence enjoyed by others exhibit the effects of these inﬂuences. In the presence of generalized increasing returns, typically there exist more than one stationary outcome with the property that small deviations from that outcome are self-correcting. These multiple stable equilibria may be displaced by what appear in our models as exogenous shocks, mutations, or idiosyncratic play, but that in the real world take the form of wars, climatic changes, strikes, or other events not included in the model under examination. A result may be infrequent but dramatic periods of change in institutions, behaviors, technologies, and the like as a population moves from 6\n\nSee Bourguignon and Morrison (2002) and the works cited there.\n\nPrologue •\n\n13\n\nthe neighborhood of one equilibrium to another, often followed by long periods of stability. Biologists use the term punctuated equilibria to refer to this alternating pattern of stasis and rapid change (Eldredge and Gould 1972). The collapse of Communism is an example. Another is the demise of foot binding of young women in China. This painful and disabling practice endured for a millennium, resisting attempts to end it over the centuries, yet it disappeared in the course of just a decade and a half in the early part the last century (Mackie 1996). The existence of multiple equilibria may also explain why seemingly similar populations may come to have quite different norms, tastes, and customs, often resulting in the widely observed pattern of local homogeneity and global heterogeneity, distinctive national cuisines and food tastes providing an example. There is no reason and little evidence to suggest that the institutions and behaviors that result from processes in which generalized increasing returns are at work are in any sense optimal. Following the fall of Communism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, for example, many economists conﬁdently predicted that once state property was abolished, a workable conﬁguration of capitalist institutions would spontaneously emerge. But in Russia and many of the other transitional economies, a decade of lawlessness and kleptocracy implemented a massive concentration of wealth under institutions providing few incentives for enhanced productivity or investment. The disappointing economic results of the end of Communist rule in these countries underlines the fallacy of the conventional view that good institutions are free in a world of material scarcity. In the pages that follow, institutions, like goods, are taken to be scarce. The three basic assumptions outlined above—the noncontractual nature of social interactions, adaptive and other-regarding behaviors, and generalized increasing returns—deﬁne the generic case, my default option. The three are related. Relaxing the complete contracting assumption without modifying the behavioral assumptions of Walrasian economics is untenable, for the importance of other-regarding preferences, as we will see, is considerably enhanced when contractual incompleteness is taken into account. Similarly, the process by which preferences evolve exhibits strong generalized increasing returns. The reason is that norms generally take the form of conventions, adherence to which is in one’s interest only as long as most others do the same. So relaxing the conventional behavioral assumptions raises doubts about nonincreasing returns. Finally, if generalized increasing returns are common, many different outcomes may be equilibria. Of these, the states most likely to be observed will depend critically on institutions governing the relevant dynamics, including such things as the exercise of power, collective action, and other forms of noncontractual social inter-\n\n14 •\n\nPrologue\n\naction. What is called equilibrium selection operates almost entirely through processes absent in the Walrasian model. While most of what follows is the result of recent research, virtually all of the models and ideas presented there were anticipated by writers half a century ago or more, sometimes much more. The importance of adaptive agents (with realistic cognitive capacities and predispositions) whose behaviors were based on local information was central to the work of Friedrich Hayek (1945) and Herbert Simon (1955). Simon’s pioneering work on the incomplete nature of the employment contract (Simon 1951) and the role of authority in the functioning of ﬁrms formalizes the earlier work of Ronald Coase (1937) and long before Coase, Marx (1967). The basic concepts of game theory, bargaining, and other nonmarket social interactions were introduced in the early writings of John Nash (1950a), John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern (1944), Thomas Schelling (1960), and Duncan Luce and Howard Raiffa (1957). Nash even suggested the basic ideas of evolutionary game theory in his doctoral dissertation (Nash 1950b). Nash’s famous solution to the bargaining problem was ﬁrst proposed much earlier by F. Zeuthen (1930), in a work introduced glowingly by Joseph Schumpeter. Endogenous preferences were central to the work of James Duesenberry (1949) and Harvey Leibenstein (1950), both drawing on the much earlier work of Thorsten Veblen (1934 [1899]) and developing themes initially raised by Smith (1937) and Marx. The famous paradox of Maurice Allais (1953) pointed to problems with the expected utility hypothesis that have only recently attracted serious attention. The way that positive feedbacks support multiple equilibria was the key idea in Gunnar Myrdal’s 1955 Cairo lectures (mentioned above). The application of biological reasoning to economics, now prominent in evolutionary game theory, was introduced a half-century ago by Armen Alchian (1950) and Gary Becker (1962). The fact that most of the key ideas presented in the pages that follow were anticipated during the 1950s or before but ignored in subsequent decades poses an intriguing question. Why did the Walrasian paradigm become virtually synonymous with economics in the third quarter of the twentieth century only to be displaced at the century’s end by a set of ideas most of which had been articulated by well-placed academics just prior to the rise to prominence of the Walrasian paradigm? Herbert Gintis and I (Bowles and Gintis 2000) have attempted to answer the question, but to address it here would be a diversion. Relaxing the canonical Walrasian assumptions to take account of noncontractual social interactions, adaptive other-regarding behaviors, and\n\nPrologue •\n\n15\n\ngeneralized increasing returns will require a method more empirically grounded and less deductive than the usual Walrasian approach. Making little reference to the speciﬁcs of time, or place, or indeed any empirical facts, the Walrasian paradigm deduced a few rather strong predictions concerning the outcomes likely to be observed in the economy. The expansion of the domain of economics to include the family, the organization of production, and political activity such as the voluntary provision of public goods, lobbying, and voting, produced valuable insights unattainable using the conventional methods of sociology and political science. But research in these areas, as well as the return to prominence of the classical economists’ concern with long-term economic growth and distribution, have cast doubt on the generality of the standard assumptions. Responding to the malaise now felt among economists, the American Economic Association’s Journal of Economic Perspectives devotes a regular column to “anomalies,” which they deﬁne as follows: Economics can be distinguished from other social sciences by the belief that most (all?) behavior can be explained by assuming that rational agents with stable well deﬁned preferences interact in markets that (eventually) clear. An empirical result qualiﬁes as an anomaly if it is difﬁcult to “rationalize” or if implausible assumptions are necessary to explain it within the paradigm. (Thaler 2001)\n\nReaders responded avidly to the invitation to write in with their favorite examples. In place of deduction from a few (once) uncontroversial behavioral and institutional axioms, economics has increasingly (if unknowingly for the most part) moved toward an approach that combines the mathematical advances of the last century with three of the methods of the classical economists. From Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx (and excepting David Ricardo), the classical economists were nondisciplinary (the disciplines had not been invented), concerned about the empirical details of the social problems of their day, and modest about the degree of generality to which their theories aspired. First, the study of the economy must draw upon the insights of all of the behavioral sciences, including ecology and biology. The Walrasian assumptions provided a rationale for a rigid division of labor among the disciplines. Its deﬁning assumptions allowed Walrasian economists to disavow an interest in other-regarding behaviors, norms, the exercise of power, or history as some other discipline’s concern and in any case not pertinent to the workings of the (Walrasian) economy. While the trafﬁc across the disciplinary boundaries has in the last half-century consisted primarily in the export of economic methods to the other behavioral\n\n16 •\n\nPrologue\n\nsciences, there is much to be imported if the role of power, norms, emotions, and adaptive behaviors in the economy are to be understood. Core economic phenomena such as the workings of competition, incentives, and contracts cannot be understood without the insights of the other behavioral sciences. Second, relaxation of the Walrasian assumptions confronts us with an embarrassment of riches. In the absence of some empirical restrictions or theoretical reﬁnements, the price of generality will be vacuousness. This was the conclusion of Hugo Sonnenschein (1973b:405) concerning Walrasian theory of market demand: “The moral . . . is simply this: if you put very little in, you get very little out.” But the same applies to any post-Walrasian paradigm. Few empirical predictions will be forthcoming if individuals may be self-interested or not depending on the person and the situation, if some interactions are governed by contracts, others by handshakes, and others by brute force, and if there exist multiple stable equilibria. The need for empirical grounding of assumptions is nowhere clearer than in the analysis of individual behavior, where the process of enriching the conventional assumptions about cognition and preferences can easily descend into ad hoc explanation unless disciplined by reference to facts about what real people do. It is not enough to know that selfinterest is not the only motive; we need to know which other motives are important under what conditions. These restrictions are most likely to come from one of the sources that undermined the Walrasian paradigm, namely, the great advances in empirical social science stemming from new techniques in econometrics, the improvement in computational capabilities and data availability, experimental techniques, and continuing progress in quantitative history. Theory, too, can provide useful restrictions on the set of plausible assumptions and outcomes. The modeling of genetic and cultural evolution, for example, can help restrict the range of plausible behavioral assumptions by distinguishing between those emotions, cognitive capacities, and other inﬂuences on behaviors whose emergence and diffusion can plausibly be accounted for over the relevant periods of human history, and those that cannot. Similarly, while generalized increasing returns may support a large number of equilibria, some of these equilibria are extremely inaccessible under any plausible dynamic process. By contrast, other equilibria may be both accessible and robust. In this case, speciﬁcation of an explicit dynamic process—for example, an account of how individuals adapt their behaviors in light of their recent experiences and the experiences of those whom they observe—may allow the elimination of what may be termed evolutionarily irrelevant equilibria. Making explicit the dynamics governing a system gives us an account of its out-of-equilibrium behavior and\n\nPrologue • 17\n\nthus not only helps in the process of equilibrium selection but also in studying the response to shocks and other problems for which the standard comparative static method is ill-suited. Third, the quest for ever more general theories will continue to engage students of the economy, and there is still much to be learned by studying such topics as markets in general. But for the foreseeable future it seems likely that insights will come from models that take account of the speciﬁc institutional and other aspects of particular types of economic interaction. For the classical economists it was evident that labor markets differ in fundamental ways from credit markets, which in turn differ from shirt markets or foreign exchange markets, and so on. Models may be more speciﬁc with respect to time and place, as a way of capturing the importance of time-varying institutions or different cultures. If the exciting novelties of the Walrasian era were highly abstract theorems of surprising generality, the excitement in the coming years may come from compelling answers to such questions as are raised by the empirical puzzles concerning the wealth of nations and people, with which I began. It would be salutary for economists to focus more on answering such questions and less on demonstrating the use of our increasingly sophisticated tools. But it seems that a more problem-driven and less tooldriven approach will require yet more sophisticated tools. The mathematical demands of the theoretical framework I am proposing will be greater, not less, than that of the Walrasian paradigm. The reason is that models that represent noncontractual social exchanges among individuals who are both heterogeneous and versatile in their behaviors and who interact in the presence of generalized increasing returns do not allow the standard simpliﬁcations such as price-taking behavior and convex production sets that made Walrasian models tractable. As has long been recognized in physics and biology, many important problems do not yield simple closed form solutions, or indeed any solutions at all that are susceptible to simple interpretation. In these cases—some of which you will encounter in chapters 11 through 13—computer simulations of the relevant social interactions will prove insightful as a complement (not a substitute) for more traditional analytical methods. Simulations have been extensively used in developing the ideas on which this book draws. Simulations do not yield theorems or propositions that are generally true; rather, like experiments, they yield a wealth of data that may point to unambiguous conclusions but often do not. Though motivated by an interest in the impact of economic institutions on human well-being, I have adopted an evolutionary rather than a social engineering approach. Like the idea of “selﬁsh genes” seeking\n\n18 •\n\nPrologue\n\nto maximize their replication or an auctioneer presiding over a general equilibrium exchange process, the omniscient and omnipotent social engineer seeking to maximize social welfare is a ﬁction whose usefulness depends on keeping in mind its ﬁctive character. Social outcomes—even those involving states and other powerful bodies—are the combined result of actions taken by large numbers of people acting singly. Such devices as ﬁctive auctioneers, social engineers, or anthropomorphic genes cannot substitute for an understanding of how real individuals behave and the ways that distinct institutions generate population-level dynamics that aggregate these behaviors to produce social outcomes. The evolutionary character of the analysis will become evident in the way that individual behaviors are modeled, the kinds of populationlevel dynamics studied, the ways that behaviors and institutions coevolve, and the absence of any grand blueprints for human betterment. The evolutionary approach is modest about what interventions can accomplish, but it does not restrict the economist to purely contemplative pursuits. I take up questions of good governance and policy in the concluding chapter. The ﬁrst part of the book introduces a variety of models applied to what I have just called the generic social interaction, namely, noncontractual social interactions among adaptive agents in the presence of generalized increasing returns. I begin with two chapters on institutions and the evolution of structures of social interactions before turning to preferences and beliefs. The unconventional ordering of these topics— most microeconomics texts start with preferences—reﬂects the importance of institutions as inﬂuences on the norms, tastes, and understandings that individuals bring to the situations in which they act. I then investigate allocational inefﬁciencies that occur in noncontractual interactions, and the problem of dividing the gains to cooperation that arises when these inefﬁciencies can be overcome. The middle part of the book concerns the institutions of capitalism, and especially markets, lending institutions, and ﬁrms. I give particular attention to the way that the incomplete nature of most contracts gives rise both to a well-deﬁned political structure of the economy and to an important role for social preferences. The last part concerns the process of cultural and institutional change; I emphasize the role of technical change, collective action, and intergroup conﬂict as constituent parts of the process by which the rules governing social interactions and individual behaviors coevolve. Here I address the evolution of familiar institutions such as private property and customary rules of division, as well as the puzzling evolutionary success of other-regarding individual behaviors. The concluding chapter compares three structures governing economic interactions—markets, states, and communities—and explores ways that they\n\nPrologue •\n\n19\n\nmight serve as complementary approaches to handling problems of allocation and distribution. In 1848, John Stuart Mill (1965) published Principles of Political Economy, the ﬁrst great textbook in microeconomics; it was the staple of instruction in the English-speaking world until displaced by Marshall’s Principles a half-century later. Mill’s readers may have been reassured to read, “Happily, there is nothing in the laws of Value which remains for the present writer or any future writer to clear up; the theory of the subject is complete” (p. 420). When I studied economics in the 1960s during the heyday of the Walrasian paradigm, a similar complacency reigned. This book conveys no such reassurance. Our understanding of microeconomics is fundamentally in ﬂux. Little is settled. Nothing is complete.\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nPA RT I\n\nCoordination and Conﬂict: Generic Social Interactions\n\nThis page intentionally left blank\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nSocial Interactions and Institutional Design Two neighbors may agree to drain a meadow, which they possess in common; because ’tis easy for them to know each others mind; and each must perceive, that the immediate consequence of his failing in his part, is the abandoning of the whole project. But ’tis very difﬁcult and indeed impossible, that a thousand persons shou’d agree in any such action; it being difﬁcult for them to concert so complicated a design, and still more difﬁcult for them to execute it; while each seeks a pretext to free himself of the trouble and expense, and wou’d lay the whole burden on others. —David Hume, A Treatise of Human Nature, Volume II (1739) This is how men could imperceptibly acquire some crude idea of mutual commitments and the advantages to be had in fulﬁlling them. . . . Were it a matter of catching a deer, everyone was quite aware that he must faithfully keep to his post in order to achieve this purpose; but if a hare happened to pass within reach of one of them, no doubt he would have pursued it without giving it a second thought, and that, having obtained his prey he cared very little about causing his companions to miss theirs. —Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Discourse on the Origin and Foundations of Inequality among Men (1755)\n\nGetting the Rules Right Like the overnight train that left me in an empty ﬁeld some distance from the settlement, the process of economic development has for the most part bypassed the two hundred or so families that make up the village of Palanpur. They have remained poor, even by Indian standards: less than a third of the adults are literate, and most have endured the loss of a child to malnutrition or to illnesses that are long forgotten in other parts of the world. But for the occasional wristwatch, bicycle, or irrigation pump, Palanpur appears to be a timeless backwater, untouched by India’s cutting edge software industry and booming agricultural regions. Seeking to understand why, I approached a sharecropper and his three The ﬁrst epigraph is from Hume (1964:304), and the second from Rousseau (1987:62).\n\n24 •\n\nChapter 1\n\ndaughters weeding a small plot.1 The conversation eventually turned to the fact that Palanpur farmers sow their winter crops several weeks after the date at which yields would be maximized. The farmers do not doubt that earlier planting would give them larger harvests, but no one, the farmer explained, is willing to be the ﬁrst to plant, as the seeds on any lone plot would be quickly eaten by birds. I asked if a large group of farmers, perhaps relatives, had ever agreed to sow earlier, all planting on the same day to minimize the losses. “If we knew how to do that,” he said, looking up from his hoe at me, “we would not be poor.” Planting on the right day, like successfully draining the meadow in Hume’s example or preventing the unraveling of Rousseau’s stag hunt, is a solution to a problem called a social dilemma or coordination problem. Thomas Hobbes and the other founders of European political philosophy, as well as the great classical economists from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill, sought to discover the institutions that by addressing problems like these would be most conducive to human well-being. For them an over-arching question was: how can social interactions be structured so that people are free to choose their own actions while avoiding outcomes that none would have chosen? I call this the classical constitutional conundrum. We now would say: they were interested in getting the rules right. A contemporary restatement of the conundrum would deﬁne “outcomes” as equilibria of a game speciﬁed by the structure of social interactions along with an account of how, given this institutional environment, individuals might come to act in such away that a particular outcome (perhaps one of many stable equilibria) might occur and persist over long periods. “Avoiding outcomes that none would have chosen” would be reﬁned as the pursuit of a Pareto-efﬁcient outcome, namely one for which no other feasible outcome would be preferred by at least one, and not less preferred by any. I will make extensive use of the notion of Pareto efﬁciency, so a comment on its shortcomings is in order. As a basis for choice among allocations, the Pareto standard is at once too weak and too strong. It is too strong because in any practical application, large numbers of people will be involved, and it is almost always the case that a change in policy or institutions inﬂicts costs on some participants, even in the long run. This being the case, the Pareto standard has a strong status quo bias. The Pareto standard is too weak because it abstracts from other desiderata of an allocation. The most important of these is the principle that the distribution of beneﬁts entailed by an allocation should be fair. 1 Lanjouw and Stern (1998) provide a detailed account of the economy and social structure of Palanpur.\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n25\n\nThus, the idea that good rules support Pareto-efﬁcient equilibria hardly exhausts constitutional desiderata, but, subject to these two caveats, it is certainly among them. Unfortunately, including Pareto efﬁciency as a desideratum does not provide much guidance in making policy choices. There may be many reasons to prefer a Pareto-inefﬁcient outcome over a Pareto-efﬁcient one; all that is precluded is a preference for a particular outcome when some other feasible outcome is Pareto superior to that outcome. But few practical choices take this form: most policy alternatives cannot be Pareto ranked in this way. The constitutional conundrum has broad contemporary relevance, including environmental protection on a global scale, the determination of work effort among members of a production team, the production and distribution of information, and the formation of the neighborhoods in which people live. The fact that since the emergence of capitalism, the aggregate effect of millions of individuals, each acting independently in pursuit of their own objectives, has been a long-term improvement in the material living conditions of most of those participating suggests that tolerably good solutions can be found to problems much more challenging than the Palanpur farmers’ planting date, Hume’s meadow, and Rousseau’s stag hunt. How it comes about that large numbers of strangers with little or no concern for one another’s well-being routinely act in mutually beneﬁcial ways is one of the great puzzles of human society, and one that I will try to illuminate. But there is also unmistakable evidence of failures to solve modern day coordination problems: systematic overuse of some resources (the natural environment) and underutilization of others (human productive capacities), for example, and the enduring poverty of the people of Palanpur and villages like it around the world. The reason why uncoordinated activities of individuals pursuing their own ends often produce outcomes that all would seek to avoid is that each person’s actions affect the well-being of others and these effects are often not included in whatever optimizing process or rule of thumb results in the decisions made by self-interested actors. These unaccounted-for effects on others are sometimes called externalities or spillovers. Economists once treated these external effects as exceptional, the standard example being the one farmer’s bees transporting pollen among a neighboring farmer’s apple trees. But as the above examples suggest, they are ubiquitous in a modern economy. The classical constitutional conundrum may be posed in this manner: what rules governing interactions among people would simultaneously facilitate the pursuit of their own ends, while inducing each to take adequate account of the effects of their actions on others? The ﬁrst clause (“pursuit of their own ends”) simply recognizes that any solution to coordination problems will be substantially decentralized, and none\n\n26 •\n\nChapter 1\n\nthat seek to simply override individual intentions is either workable or desirable. The key challenge is in the second clause: where a person’s actions unavoidably affect the well-being of others, how can these effects be made sufﬁciently salient to inﬂuence the actor’s behavior in appropriate ways? If the “others” are our kin, or our neighbors, or friends, our concern for their well-being or our desire to avoid social sanction might induce us to take account of the effects of our actions on them. Reﬂecting this fact, an important response to the constitutional conundrum—one that long predates the classical economists—is that concern for the well-being of others should extend to all of those with whom one interacts, thus internalizing the effects of one’s actions on others. With the increasing scope of markets over the last half-millennium, however, individuals have come to interact not with a few dozen, but with hundreds and indirectly with millions of strangers. And so, with the maturation of capitalism and growing inﬂuence of economic reasoning, the burden of good governance shifted from the task of cultivating civic virtue to the challenge of designing institutions that work tolerably well in its absence. Modern day implementation theory, the theory of mechanism design, and optimal contract theory embody this tradition, asking what forms of contracts, property rights, or other social rules might achieve some desired aggregate social objective when that objective is shared by none of the participants. A prominent example is the Fundamental Theorem of Welfare Economics, which identiﬁes the conditions under which welldeﬁned property rights and competitive markets support Pareto-efﬁcient competitive equilibria. The theorem thus provides a formalization of Adam Smith’s argument that under the right institutional conditions, individuals pursuing their self-interest will be “led by an invisible hand” to implement socially desirable outcomes. The problem of draining Hume’s meadow or preventing Rousseau’s stag hunt from unraveling are interesting precisely because—like almost all social interactions—they are situations for which the rather stringent axioms of the Fundamental Theorem do not apply. How difﬁcult it might be to sustain the cooperation necessary for a socially beneﬁcial outcome in these cases depends on the underlying structure of the interaction, namely, the beliefs and preferences of the individuals, the causeand-effect relationships governing the translation of actions into outcomes, whether the interaction is episodic or ongoing, the number of people involved, and so on. The difﬁculty of solving the problem also depends on the information structure of the interaction—who knows what, when, and whether the information can be used to enforce contracts or governmental regulations. All of these inﬂuences on the likely success or failure of the drainage,\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n27\n\nthe hunt, or any other common project depend on the particular institutions governing the interactions among the participants. Markets, families, governments, communities, and other institutions relevant to an interaction inﬂuence the constraints and incentives as well as the information, norms, and other evaluative concerns of the participants in the interaction. An adequate analysis of coordination problems and their possible attenuation must illuminate how these institutions work. For this task the minimal representation of institutions in the Walrasian paradigm is substantially inferior to the more elaborate modeling of institutions made possible by game theory. My main objective in this chapter is both to introduce some basic ideas of game theory and to use these ideas to provide a taxonomy of social interactions and their outcomes. I postpone until chapter 3 an indepth consideration of individuals and their preferences. Of course, most institutions are not designed—or at least they do not function according to any blueprint—but I will delay treatment of institutions as evolved rather than designed until chapter 2. Questions of the stability of equilibria (or why we should be concerned with equilibria at all) will also be skirted in this chapter, as they are best handled once we have an explicit model of how things change in out-of-equilibrium situations, introduced in chapter 2. I begin with an example that illustrates the formal structure of the challenges raised by Hume and Rousseau.\n\nCoordination and Conflict: An Example Garrett Hardin (1968) famously described a group of herders overgrazing a pasture and driving it to ruin, coining the term tragedy of the commons and giving social science one of the most evocative metaphors since Smith’s invisible hand. Indeed, Hardin called his tragedy a “rebuttal to the invisible hand.” These two metaphors are powerful because they capture two essential but sharply contrasting social situations. When guided by an invisible hand, social interactions reconcile individual choice and socially desirable outcomes. By contrast, the dramatis personae of the commons tragedy pursue their private objectives to disastrous consequences for themselves and others. Hardin chose the bucolic setting for his tragedy for concreteness only; the underlying problem applies to a wide class of situations in which individuals typically cannot or do not take account of the effects of their actions on the well-being of others. These include trafﬁc congestion, payment of taxes and other contributions to common projects, the preservation of group reputations, team work, and many more.\n\n28 •\n\nChapter 1\n\nAn example will illuminate the structure of the problem, raising a large number of issues to be addressed in greater analytical detail in subsequent chapters. Consider two ﬁshers, Jay and Eye, who share access to a lake and catch ﬁsh there which they consume. Fish are plentiful enough so that additional ﬁshing always yields more ﬁsh to each of the two, but the more ﬁsh one catches, the fewer the other catches in an hour of ﬁshing. Each of them decides how much time to spend ﬁshing, selecting the amount that maximizes their own well-being. Suppose that this optimization process, when carried out separately and without any binding agreement between the two, leads each to ﬁsh eight hours a day and that the net beneﬁts (no pun intended) of this activity are just sufﬁcient to match the next best alternative for each (perhaps working for wages in the nearby town). Deﬁne the beneﬁts ﬂowing from this socalled fallback option (or reservation position) as u ⬎ 0 for both ﬁshers. They each know that if they both ﬁshed less, they could each be better off, their smaller catch being more than offset by their greater leisure. Assume that they study the matter and determine how they would fare if they both limited their hours to six (we’ll assume that this is the only alternative to eight hours), or if one ﬁshed eight and the other six. They normalize their payoffs so that they assign a number 1 to the outcome of both ﬁshing less, and zero to the one who ﬁshes less while the other continues ﬁshing more. Table 1.1 shows the relevant payoffs (according to convention, the row player’s payoffs are listed ﬁrst). The tragedy of the ﬁshers is a prisoners’ dilemma. This is a situation in which for each individual there is an action that, if taken, yields higher payoffs than any of the other available actions independently of what the other does (the other actions are said to be dominated). But when all individuals act to maximize their payoffs by taking this action the outcome is worse for both than some other outcome they could have achieved by acting differently. Thus ﬁshing for six hours is dominated because ␣ ⬎ 0 and u ⬎ 0, and it is Pareto superior to eight hours because u ⬍ 1. It might seem a simple matter to determine that they should just agree that each will ﬁsh six instead of eight hours, but this is far from the Table 1.1 Tragedy of the Fishers: A Prisoners’ Dilemma Eye Jay\n\nFish 6 hours\n\nFish 8 hours\n\nFish 6 hours Fish 8 hours\n\n1, 1 1 ␣, 0\n\n0, 1 ␣ u, u\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n29\n\ncase, for two reasons. The ﬁrst is that they may have no way of enforcing an agreement, or even knowing if the agreement has been violated. While each may know how many hours the other has ﬁshed on a clear day, on a foggy day it may be impossible to know, and in any case each one’s knowledge of how much the other ﬁshed may be insufﬁcient to enforce an agreement judicially. This is the problem of asymmetric or unveriﬁable information, the former describing a situation in which what someone knows another does not, and the latter that in which what someone knows cannot be used in court. The second problem arises because the six-hours-a-day arrangement is an agreement both to ﬁsh less and implicitly to divide the beneﬁts of ﬁshing less in a particular way, namely, equally. But the ﬁshers of course realize that they need not agree on six hours each. They could instead agree that Eye will ﬁsh eight hours and Jay four hours, or vice versa. The ﬁshers have two problems, not one. The ﬁrst, concerning allocation, is to determine how much ﬁshing to do in total, namely, how to restrict the total hours of ﬁshing, and the second, concerning distribution, is how to divide the beneﬁts to ﬁshing less, should they agree to do so. Figure 1.1 illustrates the ﬁshers’ opportunities and predicament. In ﬁgure 1.1, as before, six and eight hours of ﬁshing are the only alternative actions on a given day, but now Eye and Jay may adopt strategies whereby they ﬁsh eight hours one day and six the next, as well as other combinations over a period of time. Further, I assume that any allocation must be agreed to by both ﬁshers. The payoffs 兵1, 1其 are feasible and implementable by the six hour rule, but more complex agreements can implement any point within the set abcd. For example, point d can be implemented simply by Eye agreeing to ﬁsh six hours every day, and Jay’s ﬁshing eight. While Eye would surely not agree to this (Eye does worse under this arrangement than if each ﬁshes 8 hours), Jay might offer to ﬁsh six hours a fraction of the time equal to u ε (ε is a small positive number) and eight the rest, while requiring Eye to ﬁsh six hours all the time, threatening to ﬁsh eight hours all the time if Eye refused. Eye might well accept, for Eye would then expect a net gain of one during (u ε) of the time and u the rest, the alternative being to get u all of the time, which would occur if Jay carried out the threat. Jay would then gain net beneﬁts of one when they jointly ﬁshed six hours, which would happen (u ε) of the time, and (1 ␣) the rest of the time when Jay ﬁshed eight hours and Eye only six. Jay’s proposed contract is indicated by point f in ﬁgure 1.1. All the points along cfd can be achieved by a contract of the form above: Jay works six hours for a fraction of the time, ␤ and eight hours the rest, while Eye works six hours all the time, giving the utilities ui ␤ and uj ␤ (1 ␤)(1 ␣). Of course Eye would reject contracts along fd. If Jay is able to precommit to such an offer, Jay is the ﬁrst mover and\n\n30 •\n\nChapter 1\n\nEye’s Utility 1+α b\n\ng\n\n1\n\nc\n\na\n\n0\n\nf\n\n1\n\nd 1+α Jay’s Utility\n\nFigure 1.1 The tragedy of the ﬁshers. Note at c both the ﬁshers ﬁsh 6 hours while at a they both ﬁsh 8 hours.\n\nhas the ﬁrst mover advantage. Of course, Eye might have made the identical offer to Jay. In this case the order of play (including who gets to be the ﬁrst mover) makes a difference. A moment’s reﬂection will conﬁrm that there is not just one but rather an inﬁnite number of agreements that are at once mutually beneﬁcial (compared to the eight-hour rule) and efﬁcient. An efﬁcient agreement is one for which there exists no alternative that beneﬁts at least one of the ﬁshers without making the other worse off. These so called Pareto-improving (over the dominant strategy equilibrium outcome) and Pareto-efﬁcient agreements are all the points along fcg in the ﬁgure (called the Pareto frontier.) The ﬁshers might have quickly agreed on the joint limitation to six hours if that were the only alternative to both ﬁshing eight hours. But they might fail to agree once the range of possible agreements is enlarged; they may ﬁnd that more options may be worse than fewer. This is because the indeterminate nature of the division of the beneﬁts of ﬁshing less raises the question of fairness and thus brings to bear considerations not captured in the game as described thus far. Eye, for example, might reject the disadvantageous “take-it-or-leave it” offer by Jay. But the same outcome might have been acceptable had it been arrived at in an impartial manner (by ﬂipping a coin, for example), or had\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n31\n\nthe beneﬁts to ﬁshing less been donated to a good cause rather than captured by Jay. If Eye and Jay cannot agree on a division, it may be that no agreement to restrict ﬁshing is possible. But a third party, the government, might impose a seven hour limit on both ﬁshers and then let them bargain to some more reﬁned agreement if they are able. Or the ﬁshers might come to adhere to an environmental norm inducing each independently to restrict his catch. The norm would imply a new payoff matrix in which the concern about environmental damage or the imposition of costs on the other ﬁsher were taken into account. It is just this type of indeterminacy that economic and other institutions address, answering such questions as who is positioned to make a take-it-or-leave-it offer, what other actions are available to the relevant parties, what information asymmetries or lack of veriﬁability bear on the problem (and, as a result, what agreements are enforceable by third parties), and what norms may affect the outcome of the conﬂict. Real ﬁshers, of course, are not acting out a tragic script, as Hardin supposed; nor are they prisoners of the dilemma they face. They are often resourceful in seeking solutions to the problem of overﬁshing. Turkish ﬁshermen, for example, allocate ﬁshing spots by lot and then rotate them. Information sharing among ﬁshers discourages cheating, while governmental regulations supplement local social-network-based enforcement (Ostrom 1990).The extant rules regulating access to ﬁshing are a small selection—from a much larger set of rules once tried—that have succeeded at least well enough to allow the communities using them to persist and not abandon their rules in favor of some other. As we will see, the persistence of rules does not require that they be efﬁcient, only that they be reproduced over time. Nonetheless, we might expect a community of ﬁshers who have hit on the ways of sustaining joint limitation to six hours to do better in competition with groups that overﬁsh, and to be copied by other groups. We will return to the example of the ﬁshers in chapter four to explore the analytics of how taxes, asymmetric power relations among actors, social norms, and other aspects of social interactions affect outcomes. How might game theory illuminate the tragedy of the ﬁshers and similar problems?\n\nGames Games are a way of modeling strategic interactions, that is, situations in which the consequences of individuals’ actions depend on the actions taken by others, and this mutual interdependence is recognized by those involved. A game is a complete identiﬁcation of the players, a list for\n\n32 •\n\nChapter 1\n\neach player of every course of action available to him (including actions contingent on the actions taken by others, or on chance events)— known as the strategy set—the payoffs associated with each strategy proﬁle (combination of strategies), as well the order of play and who knows what, when. Players may be individuals or organizations such as ﬁrms, trade unions, political parties, or national states. In biological applications, subindividual entities such as cells or genes are also players. Even this brief introduction reveals two great virtues of game theory as a contribution to the study of economic institutions and behavior (I will consider the drawbacks presently). First, few social interactions can be reduced to the interaction of an agent with a given environment (as is accomplished by the price-taking axiom and the other unrealistic assumptions of the Walrasian model). Most interactions have a strategic component, and game theory is designed to analyze the manner in which individual action is inﬂuenced by the fact that this interdependence is commonly recognized by one or more parties to an interaction. Second, the complete speciﬁcation of a game requires detailed attention to the institutional environment in which the interaction takes place; outcomes often hinge on these details (for example, who takes the ﬁrst move) in ways that would not be revealed in frameworks that suppress rather than highlight institutional detail. Game theory does not provide substantive insights any more than mathematics or any other language does. But it often provides a clear way of expressing insights originating elsewhere and for understanding the role of particular assumptions in a line of reasoning. The “tragedy of the ﬁshers” example above is a game, presented in what is called its normal (or strategic) form. This means that the time sequence of the actions taken by each player is not explicitly represented, the assumption being made that each player moves without knowing the move of the others. The extensive form of a game makes explicit the order of moves, and who knows what at each stage in the game. Moves made earlier in time need not be known by those making later moves, of course. An example of a game in extensive form is the representation of the experimental ultimatum game as a game tree in chapter 3. The extensive form conveys more information about the interaction in the sense that many extensive-form games may be represented by the same normal form game. When, as is common, the normal-form representation is used, this is because the additional information in the extensive form is thought to be irrelevant to how the game will be played.2 As you will see in chapter 3, experimental subjects’ 2\n\nWho moves ﬁrst may affect behavior even if the second mover does not know what\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n33\n\nbehaviors appear to be quite sensitive to details that at ﬁrst glance would not seem to affect the structure of the game (the name given to the game, for example, or the labeling of the players). Thus it is not a good idea to reduce an extensive form game to its normal form unless there is good reason to think that the temporal order of play will have no effect on the behaviors of the players. The outcome of a game is a set of actions taken by the players (and the associated payoffs). Game outcomes cannot be deduced from game structures alone but require, in addition, a plausible solution concept, that is, a speciﬁcation of how those involved might play. The relationship between games and their outcomes is far from settled, with sharply contrasting approaches. Classical game theory stresses sometimes quite demanding forward-looking cognitive evaluations by the players. By contrast, evolutionary game theory stresses rule-of-thumb behaviors that are updated by a backward-looking learning process, that is, in light of one’s own or others’ recent experience. Two solution concepts are widely used in classical game theory: dominance and Nash equilibrium. Dominance purports to say what will not happen (and in some cases, by a process of elimination, is illuminating about what will happen). Dominance gives strong predictions of outcomes in such games as the prisoners’ dilemma in which every player will choose some particular strategy irrespective of what the others do. (Games solvable by dominance are degenerate strategic interactions in that the action taken by each does not depend on the actions taken by others.) The idea behind the Nash equilibrium is that there may be one or more outcomes that no individual has any incentive to alter his strategy given the strategies adopted by all the others. Both dominance and the Nash equilibrium are based on the notion of a best response strategy. A strategy may be an unconditional action (such as drive on the right), but it may also be a prescription for acting contingent on the prior actions of others or chance. “Fish six hours a day no matter what” is a strategy, as is “Fish today as many hours as the other ﬁshed yesterday” (called tit for tat). A ﬁrm’s wage offer and promotion ladder contingent on worker performance is a strategy, as is an employee’s choice of an effort level; a bank’s interest rate, system of monitoring its clients, and method of handling their defaults is also a strategy; and so on. Thus a strategy is a description of an action or actions to take under every situation that may be encountered in the game. In addition to the pure strategies that make up the strategy set, an individual may adopt a mixed strategy, namely, a probability distrithe ﬁrst mover did. Examples are provided in Camerer and Weber (2003) and Rapoport (1997).\n\n34 •\n\nChapter 1\n\nbution over some or all of the pure strategies in the set. For example, one could let a coin ﬂip determine if one ﬁshed six or eight hours.3 Let there be n players indexed by i 1 . . . n, and a strategy set for each is called Si. Suppose the jth player selects a particular strategy s ∈ Sj. Let sj represent the strategies adopted by all other players (chosen from their strategy sets Sj) and ␲j(s, sj) the payoff to j under the strategy proﬁle (s, sj). The payoff is j’s evaluation of the outcome produced by the strategy proﬁle (s, sj). Strategy s is j’s best response to the strategies adopted by the others if no strategy available to j would result in higher payoffs for j. That is, ␲j(s, sj) ⱖ ␲j(s, sj) ∀ s ∈ Sj, s ≠ s which may be read: j’s payoff to playing s against the given strategy proﬁle of all others (sj) is not less than the payoff to playing any other strategy s in j’s strategy set against sj. A strict best response is a strategy for which the strict inequality holds for all s, while a weak best response is one for which the above expression holds as an inequality for at least one alternative strategy s. A weakly dominant strategy is one for which no strategy yields a higher payoff regardless of the strategy choice of the others and that for some strategy proﬁle yields higher payoffs. So s is weakly dominant if ␲j(s, sj) ⱖ ␲j(s, sj) ∀ s ∈ Sj and ∀ sj ∈ Sj with the strict inequality holding for at least one strategy proﬁle. A strategy is strictly dominant if no strategy weakly dominates it, that is, when the above inequality is strict in all cases. I reserve the terms “best response” and “dominance” (without the weak or strict modiﬁer) for the stronger concept. If there exists a dominant strategy for each player, then the strategy proﬁle in which all players adopts their dominant strategy is termed a dominant strategy equilibrium. Overﬁshing in the tragedy of the ﬁshers is an example. Surprisingly, it may not always make sense to play a dominant strategy, but to see why, I will need to introduce another important solution concept—risk dominance—which I will do presently. A Nash equilibrium is a strategy proﬁle in which all players’ strategies are best responses to the other strategies in the proﬁle; if all of the best responses making up this strategy proﬁle are unique (they include no weak best responses), then the Nash equilibrium is said to be strict. Because players have no reason to change their behaviors (the equilib3 While mixed strategies sometimes provide a handy modeling device (e.g., the monitoring and working example in chapter 8), for technical reasons they have been given much more attention by game theorists than is justiﬁed by any resulting illumination of human behavior.\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n35\n\nrium is a mutual best response), it is said to be stationary, it is this characteristic that justiﬁes calling it an equilibrium. This interpretation is based on the assumption that individuals will not jointly agree to alter their strategies. Responding to John Von Neumann’s objection that people are not really all that uncooperative, John Nash (to whom we owe this and other contributions to game theory) once called it “the American way.” Finally, iterated dominance is a procedure by which a player may eliminate from consideration any of the other players’ strategies that are strictly dominated (i.e., would not be advantageous to adopt in any strategy proﬁle). Truncating the other players’ strategy sets in this manner changes the structure of the game such that the game truncated by iterated dominance may have a Nash or dominant strategy equilibrium even though the complete game did not.\n\nThe Structure of Social Interactions People interact in an endless variety of ways, but there are generic classes of interaction. Some game theoretic terminology will provide an insightful classiﬁcation. The ﬁrst distinction—between cooperative and noncooperative games—refers to the institutional structure governing the interaction. The second—between common interest and conﬂict games—refers to the extent to which the game’s payoffs exhibit conﬂict or common interest among the players. Cooperative and noncooperative games. Imagine an interaction for which it is the case that everything that both is affected by the actions of the players and is of concern to any of the players is subject to binding (meaning costlessly enforceable) agreement. This is termed a cooperative interaction (or a cooperative game; I use the terms game and interaction interchangeably, when appropriate). The term does not refer to the feelings of the parties about each other but simply to the institutional arrangements governing their interactions. As we will see, cooperative games may be highly conﬂictual: for example, the purchase of a house generally pits the interests of the buyer against the seller, but if a deal is struck, it is generally enforceable and its terms cover all of the aspects of the transfer that are of interest to the parties. More commonly, however, something about the interaction is not subject to binding agreement. Such situations are modeled as noncooperative games. In some cases, part of an interaction may be addressed cooperatively, as when an employer and an employee bargain over a wage and working hours. Other aspects of the same interaction may be noncooperative because of the impossibility of writing or enforcing the\n\n36 •\n\nChapter 1\n\nrelevant contracts. Examples include how hard the worker works or whether the employer will invest the resulting proﬁts in this plant or elsewhere. As is the case with cooperative interactions, the parties to noncooperative interactions may have sharply conﬂicting interests, or share broadly common objectives; the term “noncooperative” refers simply to the fact that their interaction is not fully covered by a binding agreement. By the same token, many aspects of loving relationships among friends and family are noncooperative interactions, for example, the promise to do one’s best to get a friend a job may be completely sincere, but it is not a binding agreement. Common interest and conﬂict. Some interactions have the character of trafﬁc patterns: trafﬁc jams are a generally poor outcome, and managing to avoid them would beneﬁt everyone. In other interactions, like settling on a price of a good to be exchanged or the division of a pie, more for one means less for the other. Many of the differences among scholars and policy makers grappling with questions of institutional design can be traced to whether they believe that the ills of society are the result of common interest problems like trafﬁc jams or of conﬂicting interest problems like the division of a ﬁxed pie. In one case, institutions may be represented as problem solvers and in the second as claim enforcers. But most institutions do both. Thus, it may be impossible to analyze the problem-solving and distributional aspects of institutions in isolation. It will be useful to have some language to differentiate between these classes of problems; to do this I will refer to the common interest and conﬂict aspects of an interaction, starting with pure cases. A game in which the payoffs to only one of the strategy proﬁles is Pareto optimal and the payoffs associated with all strategy proﬁles can be Pareto ranked can be described as a pure common interest game.4 What this means is that one outcome is better than all other outcomes for a least one participant and not worse for any participant, and there is a second best outcome that, while Pareto inferior to the ﬁrst best outcome, is Pareto superior to all the rest, and so on. Thus, there is no outcome that any player would strictly prefer over an outcome preferred by any other player. As a result, conﬂict among the players is entirely absent. Here is an example. A ﬁrm consists of an employer and an employee: 4 The term “common interest game” has been used to refer to a payoff structure such that all players prefer a given outcome to any other (for example Aumann and Sorin 1989 and Vega-Redondo 1996); the deﬁnition here is stronger (hence the “pure”) as it requires not only that a mutually preferred outcome exist but that all outcomes be Pareto rankable. Outcomes can be Pareto-ranked if the preference orderings of the outcomes—most to least preferred—of all the participants are such that if an individual prefers outcome A to outcome B, no individual prefers B to A.\n\nSocial Interaction and Institutional Design\n\n•\n\n37\n\nTable 1.2 Pure Common Interest Payoffs: The Firm Survival Game\n\nWork Do not\n\nInvest\n\nDo not\n\n1, 1 p1, p1\n\np2, p2 0, 0\n\nNote: the employer is the column player the worker is the row player: and 1 ⬎ p1 ⬎ p2 ⬎ 0.\n\nIf the ﬁrm succeeds, both get 1; if it fails, both get 0.
