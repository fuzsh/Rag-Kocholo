Recognizing the interdependence of markets and applying tools developed to represent and analyze that interdependence is an essential weapon in the applied economist’s arsenal. At the same time, the complexity of these tools requires that we understand clearly their limits. This course provides an overview of equilibrium analysis for competitive markets. We begin with an overview of the general problem of general equilibrium modeling. Then we review the basic results of pure theory that underlie our applied work: existence and finiteness of equilibria, and the existence of comparative statics. From there we move on to applied general equilibrium modeling. That is, we develop simple, tractable models that allow us to analyze specific policy questions. We will consider both standard perfectly competitive models as well as models characterized by unemployment, imperfect competition, and firm heterogeneity. We conclude with an overview of welfare analysis. That is, we consider the nature, and limits, of normative conclusions that can be based on the sorts of model developed in the first part of the course.\n\nEvaluation: Your performance in this course will be evaluated on the basis of two examinations (worth 100 points each); and a number of problem sets (worth a total of 100 points). All students are expected to do (minimally) all the required reading, complete all problem sets, and actively participate in all classes.\n\nReadings and exercises for the course will be drawn from the following core texts:\n\nAndreu Mas-Colell, Michael Whinston, and Jerry Green (1995).

The percent of total available homework credit will be taken as your homework score. For example, if you answer 90% of the homework questions correctly, your homework score is 90.\n\nPolicy on examinations. The midterm exam will be given between topics II and III. Unless you have a standard university accepted excuse for missing the exam (e.g. health with standard university form), you must take the exam at the scheduled time. The final examination will only be given on the scheduled date: Monday 6 May, 4 – 7 pm (there will be no exceptions so do not make travel plans that conflict with this). Exams must be written in blue books, which you must supply.\n\nHonor code: All students are responsible for knowing and adhering to Tulane University’s Code of academic conduct, available at https://college.tulane.edu/code-of-academic-conduct.\n\nSACS-Related Material\n\nI am aware that PhD students at Tulane are able to read a standard university syllabus and determine the content of the course and its relation to the major and the individual student’s course of study. However, the administration of Tulane University, along with the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS–which “accredits” primary and secondary schools as well as all varieties of 2 and 4 year undergraduate programs [with very little in the way of adjustment in rubrics, metrics, etc.]), has determined that you require additional information. I collect this material in a separate section so that you can refer to it, or discard it, as you consider appropriate.\n\nRelevant Program Outcomes Addressed in this Course:\n\nI. Understand and apply the tools of general equilibrium modeling.\n\nII. Understand the limits of equilibrium analysis in terms of existence and finiteness of equilibrium.\n\nIII. Understand and apply applied general equilibrium models under perfect and imperfect competition.\n\nIV. Understand mainstream welfare economics.\n\nLearning Objectives–Upon completion of this course you should have developed a practical knowledge of:\n\nPure general equilibrium theory;\n\nApplied general equilibrium theory; and\n\nWelfare economics.\n\nECON 7520 SYLLABUS\n\nTopic I.
