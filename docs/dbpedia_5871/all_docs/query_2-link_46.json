        "text": "3.7.4 Quantity Adjustments versus Price Adjustments\n\nNeoclassical economics assumes that price flexibility is at the core of a market economy and that, without it, adjustments to demand changes would be next to impossible. It is often argued that a complex market economy only avoids chaos thanks to these flexible price adjustments, and this would justify the use of the neo-Walrasian model as a rigorous benchmark model. By contrast, the whole chapter has suggested that firm generally wish to avoid price competition, so as to avoid destructive price wars. Leading firms try to stick to their costing margins while peripheral firms match the prices of the price leader, so that competition occurs through lower unit costs, investment and innovation. With the exception of raw materials, prices hardly react to demand changes and only react to changes in their unit costs. One may thus wonder whether a world which consists of such firms relying on cost-plus pricing, and with limited information as argued in Chapter 2, can truly constitute an adequate representation of a reality made of a highly complex and diversified set of interdependent firms and sectors where chaos is avoided. Herbert Simon certainly thought so.\n\nPrice provides only one of the mechanisms for coordination of behavior, either between organizations and within them. Coordination by adjustment of quantities is probably a far more important mechanism from day-to-day standpoint, and in many circumstances will do a better job of allocation than coordination by prices. … Quantities of goods sold and inventories, not prices, provide the information for coordinating these systems … Many observers of business scheduling and pricing practices have claimed that (with possible exception of agricultural and mining sectors) models that use quantities as signals approximate first-world national economies more closely than do models in which prices are the principal mechanism for coordination. (Simon, 1991, p.40)\n\nThe question has recently been tackled in a book by Shiozawa , Morioka, and Taniguchi (2019). They contend that capitalism is by nature a ‘sellers’ market–a demand constrained economy–as opposed to the supply-constrained socialist economy described by Janos Kornai (1980). They link this claim to Sraffa’s 1926 statement that the expansion of firms is not limited by rising unit costs but rather by the dificulty of attracting more customers. The separation of price and quantity adjustment is a fundamental principle. Quantities reflect changes in demand. Prices provide the criterion to judge if a new production technique is better than previously existing ones. Prices are regulated by production costs, that is, the minimum cost for a given markup structure. What we have here is a Sraffian theory of prices, slightly reinterpreted. The reinterpretation is based on three features: there is no uniform profit rate; the normal price, based on the normal unit cost, is the actual price, that is, cost-of-production prices are not prices achieved only in the long run; fixed capital is not associated with joint production, on the grounds that such joint production accounting is not practiced in actual accounting, thus setting the unit depreciation cost on the basis of the normal volume.\n\nShiozawa et al. (2019) construct multi-sectoral models, each sector with several different firms, each firm of a sector disposing of a finite set of fixed-coefficient production techniques. Prices are set by firms on the basis of normal-cost pricing, where prices only change when unit costs change and not when demand or the proportion of demand attributed to each product changes. Production takes time–there is a time sequence, forecast and orders, then production, and finally delivery and sales–so production cannot immediately respond to changes in demand, and hence there must be a buffer, which are the stocks of inventories, for both intermediate inputs and produced outputs. Finally, as argued in section 3.5.3, firms have excess capacity.\n\nShiozawa et al. (2019) show that supply adjusts to demand in a converging process, despite the complete lack of reaction of prices to the evolution of sales and inventories, under minimal conditions: production must be equal or higher than the break-even point given by the markup, so that firms do not go bankrupt; banks provide credit on demand; inventory buffers must be large enough, and there must be sufficient smoothing in forecasting demand. These forecasts are based on data that are easily obtainable, and the computations that are assumed to be made by firms require little capability.\n\nThe message being conveyed by their book should by now be clear: the results achieved by Shiozawa et al. (2019) constitute a great breakthrough-an achievement of paramount importance as the authors say -for the analysis of the modern industrial economy (the financial sector requires a completely different story). The authors claim that their results are comparable to those of Arrow-Debreu, but obtained within the completely realistic framework of a production economy where agents dispose only of local information and frugal capabilities. Prices are not scarcity indices: changes in prices are not signalling changes in demand relative to supply. They are a tool to assess the best production method, as improvements or new combinations will be reflected by a decrease in unit costs. The information conveying changes in demand is transmitted and assessed through quantity signals–sales and changes in inventories–but not through prices. A key achievement of the authors is the demonstration that a multi-sectoral economy, where production takes time and with produced inputs, can adjust to changes in demand through the realistic decisions of managers to change quantities without any change in prices–something that previously was not thought to be possible. The only drawback of Shiozawa et al.’s book is the lack of aggregate demand feedback, which will be the main subject of the remaining chapters. (Lavoie 2022 pp.190-191)"
