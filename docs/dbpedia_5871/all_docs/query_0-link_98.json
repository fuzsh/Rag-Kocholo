Maria Dimitrova Available here: Table of Contents, Acknowledgements, Preface, Abstract, Introduction, Methodology, theoretical framework and structure The whole thext would be available upon request. Preface Even a cursory reading of Hegel’s works is sufficient to convince one that the categories of quality and quantity, the concepts of space, time, place are basic to the system. In contrast with Aristotle and Kant, Hegel’s speculative logic exhibits a presuppositionless derivation of the categories. Hegel regards his categories, concepts and notions not as completed and frozen. For him, the categories must be derived, not from presupposed forms of judgement, or from our presuppositions, but from what he calls the sheer ‘simplicity of thinking’, from the indeterminate being of thought and from the indeterminate thought of being. Hegel’s categories of quality and quantity, in particular ‘qualitative quantity’ in relation with his concepts of space, time, place are subject to which much attention has not been paid by Hegel’s expositors and commentators and yet the importance of it cannot be denied. (Haldar,1932). Topological reading of ‘qualitative quantity’ within Hegel’s fourfold (manifold) of multiplicity is subject that lack attention at all from Hegel’s commentators. This conceptual gap, ontological, epistemological, phenomenological is widening within the ‘linguistic turn’, ‘spatial turn’ or ‘topological turn’ and emerging topological approaches to various fields of social science and their need for deep conceptualization based on the philosophical categories, notions and concepts. As Richard Ek establishes in Theorizing the Earth (2010), “The spatial turn is actually a ‘philosophical turn’ repackaged and promoted as a fundamental concern with question of space, place and polity in the social sciences and humanities.” (Ek, Richard, Mekonnen, T. 2010:49-66) John WP Phillips, who critically examines the recent arguments asserting a ‘topological turn’ in culture, the range of topologically informed interventions in social and cultural theory, remarkes in his paper On Topology (2013) , that such contemporary fashionable notions of ‘topological approaches’ and ‘becoming topological of culture’ “demands a greater critical reflection than the notion of a ‘topological turn’ suggests.” I believe that such demand of critical reflection shall be based on Hegel’s categories of logic, notions and concept, and following my assertion that ‘topological’ in intuitively presented by Hegel in his logic, dialectic and method, with the present thesis I argue how Hegel’s categories of qualitative and quantitative, the concept of space, time and place can provide contemporary researcher with the power and methodology of such a greater critical reflection, and ability to readdress in the new and enhanced mode the variety of these toplogical approaches. The methodology of an applied philosophical topology shall be based on the topological re-reading of Hegel and topological hermeneutics. The main objective of the present thesis is to demonstrate how Hegel’s categories, concepts, language, syntax and semantics, his use of rethorical power exibit topological notions and thus the reading of topological (in) Hegel is open for conceptualization. Perhaps it would not be an exaggeration to say that there is no system of thought more intimately bound up with one fundamental principle than is the system of Hegel. My assertion with the present thesis is that topological reading of Hegel reviels true topological system, thus there are reasonable grounds for us to see the doctrine of Hegel, in particular his Science of Logic and Philosophy of Nature as Hegel’s Analysis Situs. A correct interpretation of Hegel’s system depends upon a thorough comprehension of the categories of quality and quantity, the concepts of space, time, and place. If these categories and concepts are neglected, the system must remain a sealed book. The aim of the present thesis is to unseal the topological character of Hegel’s though, that influenced the formation and presence of topological thinking within the tradition of later continental philosophy and directs toward the horizon of new philosophical topology. The concern of the present thesis is to set forth topological reading and interpretation of such categories as quality and quantiny, in particular the qualitative quantity within Hegel’s forfold of multiplicity and such concepts as space, time, place, to emphasize on the importance of topological (in) Hegel for a theory of knowledge, and, in the light of it, and to give some insight toward the current philosophical topology. The aim of the thesis is to critically examine whether it is methodologically possible to combine mathematical rigor – topology with a systematic dialectical methodology in Hegel, and if so, to provide as result of my interpretation the outline of Hegel’s Analysis Situs, also with the proposed models (build on the topological manifold, cobordism, topological data analysis, persistent homology, simplicial complexes and graph theory, to provide an indication of how the merger of Hegel’s dialectical logic and topology may be instrumental to a systematic logician and of how a systematic dialectical logic perspective may help mathematical model builders.\n\nIn “Quality of quantity” /1989/, I have established the relevance of Hegel’s category “qualitative quantity” arguing that there is wide underestimation of this fruitful “side effect of dialectics” due to the static patterns of dialectics and the lack of ontological commitment to the concept of qualitative quantity. Based on the exploration of D'Arcy W. Thompson’s “Growth and Form”, /1917/ findings and examples from Hermann Haken , illustrating the qualitative quantity notion in structural stability, in “Quality of quantity”, I have argued that topology is the field of qualitative quantity and topological homeomorphism To my knowledge, in contemporary dialectics and philosophy research the significant notion of Hegel’s category “qualitative quantity” remained inapparent. Reason for that is probably Hegel’s own warning about “the intellectual difficulty” /§ 777 of the “The Science of Logic”, The Greater Logic/ , accusing “the attempt to explain coming-to-be or ceasing-to-be on the basis of gradualness of the alteration” as “tedious like any tautology”. Since the “qualitative quantity” in Hegel is closely related with his “qualitative concept of quantity” /the good quantitative infinity/ and the so called “bad infinity”, after re-calling the Hegel’s account on “qualitative quantity”, I will discuss in the second chapter of the study, Alain Badiou’s Mediation Fifteen on Hegel . Alain Badiou recognizes the “qualitative quantity” as the core of the domain of “quantitative infinity”, claiming that “Quantitative infinity is quantity qu a quantity, the prliferator of proliferation, which is to say, quite simply, the quality of quantity, the quantitative such as discerned qualitatively from any other determination.” The subject of my discussion will be Badiou’s dissagriment with Hegel and Badiou’s claim that “Hegel fails to intervene on number.” According to Badiou “He /Hegel/ fails because the nominal equivalence he proposes between the pure presence of passing – beyond in the void / the good qualitative infinity/ and the qualitative concept of quantity /the good quantitative infinity/ is a trich, an illusory scena of the speculative theatre. There is no symetry between the same and the other, between proliferation and identification. However heroic the effort, it is interrupted de facto by the exteriority itself of the pure multiple. Mathematics occurs here as discontinuity whitin the dialectics. It is this lesson that Hegel wishes to mask by suturing under the same term – infinity - two disjoint – discursive others.” In opposite to Badiou’s claim that “the good quantitative infinity is a properly Hegelian hallucination”, I will argue that “the fragile verbal footbridge” /according Badiou/, build by Hegel is the topology of qualitative quantity. According to Badiou, the name “infinity” suits only the qualitative infinity /in Hegel – “the bad infinity”/ and he argue that Hegel cannot properly ground “the bad quantitative infinity”. My thesis is that what Baduio calls the “Hegelian hallucination” is Hegel’s topology of the fold enveloped in the fourfold of infinities - /1/. the bad qualitative infinity; /2/. the good qualitative infinity; /3/. the bad quantitative infinity; /4/. the good quantitative infinity. In the third chapter of my study, I will discusse two “fragile” issues in Hegel with critical importance for the attempt to reveil the nature of “qualitative quantity” and to establishe the relevance of the topological notion of qualitative quantity. First is the “inapparent” nature of “qualitative quantity” and its notion, second - the “tautology” related /according to Hegel/ with “the attempt to explain coming-to-be or ceasing-to-be on the basis of gradualness of the alteration”. These two issues are the reason to see logically the “verbal footbridge” of Hegel’s “qualitative quantity” as “fragile” and so reason Hegel’s category “qualitative quantity” to remain inapparent. In the fourth chapter of this study I will discusse the topology of this “Hegelian hallucination” – the topology of qualitative quantity as re-solution of the paradox, tautology and ambiguity. The last three chapters of the study will focus on the “Hegel’s topology”, “The philosophical topologies of …” and “The Relevance of D'Arcy W. Thompson’s in the new science as background of the “topology of meaning” and transition from typological thinking to topological thinking”.\n\nTopology Topology is a major area of mathematics concerned with properties that are preserved under continuous deformations of objects, such as deformations that involve stretching, but no tearing or gluing. In topology, any continuous change which can be continuously undone is allowed. So a circle is the same as a triangle or a square, because one can just`pull on' parts of the circle to make corners and then straighten the sides, to change a circle into a square. Then one can just`smooth it out' to turn it back into a circle. These two processes are continuous. During each of these two actions, nearby points at the start are still nearby at the end. In topology we can transform a spatial body such as a sheet of rubber in various ways which do not involve cutting or tearing. We can invert it, stretch or compress it, move it, bend it, twist it, or otherwise knead it out of shape. Certain properties of the body, the properties of the 'qualitative quantity' (Dimitrov B., 1989-2014), will in general be invariant under such transformations, which is to say under transformations which are neutral as to shape, size, motion and orientation. The 'qualitative quantity transformations' can be defined as being those which do not affect the possibility of our connecting two points on the surface or in the interior of the body by means of a continuous line. Topology (Analysis Situs) is the analysis of situating and forms of location of specific objects in specific spaces. Incompletely and imprecisely speaking, length of line segment, size of angle or area of the plane play an important role in geometry. In general topology, however, those characteristics are not substantial. From a topological point of view, the triangle is identical to square, straight line to line segment without ends, and plane to sphere without one point. Thanks to its generality, topology can study abstract spaces, exceeding highly Euclidean/non-Euclidean paradigm, used often in philosophical argumentation. (Skowron, 2014)"
