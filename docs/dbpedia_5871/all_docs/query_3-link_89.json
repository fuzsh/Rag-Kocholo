        "text": "ISSUE 139 | NOVEMBER 26, 2012 | WEB | PDF\n\nWe've recently sent out an email about the situation regarding the economics program at the University of Western Sydney. We believe many of you have already addressed your concern individually or collectively. Included in the Letters section are four letters sent to the administration at UWS (also a petition to support the UWS economics is included in the Call for Support section). We don't know at the moment whether the UWS administration will change their mind or not. It is, however, unlikely that they will ignore international/public support for the UWS economic program. In the recent past, we lost the heterodox economics program at the University of Notre Dame. ''It'' can happen again at your school and anywhere in the world. Therefore, we urge you to act and speak up now if you don't want to lose another heterodox economics program.\n\nWe recently received an interesting request from Tim Thorton (at La Trobe University in Melbourne) regarding Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), specifically asking if any heterodox economists are working on building an open heterodox economics courses for the masses. I (Ted) typically teach an online principles of macro course during the summer, which has made me aware of the development of MOOCs in many other disciplines. The most well-known MOOC was created by Sebastian Thrun (Stanford) who created a course on artificial intelligence with 160,000 enrolled students. I know that some academic-related blogs have developed tutorials on various topics (for example, UMKC’s New Economic Perspectives blog has developed tutorials on MMT), and many tutorials were developed for and by Occupy Wall Street participants, but I am not aware of any attempts to develop a specific MOOC on heterodox economics. It’s an interesting idea. If anyone is aware of an attempt, or has some ideas on how to go forward, please send us the info and we’ll share it in the next newsletter.\n\nLastly, we'd like to remind you that the new edition of the Heterodox Economics Directory will be published in early January (hopefully before the ASSA meetings). We are also in the process of creating a new web site for the Directory. Go here for a sneak peek: http://heterodoxnews.com/hed. On this web site, you can find a cover page and the (yet-to-be-complete) table of contents for the print edition. The Directory is not only for providing heterodox economists with useful information, but also for showing others that heterodox economics is emerging and growing. If you want to add your graduate/undergraduate heterodox program, website, and the like to the new Directory, please let us know at your earliest convenience.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nTae-Hee Jo and Ted P.

AFIT is one of many scholarly organizations that supports and encourages academics and professionals alike to consider some of the most important questions facing us today from alternative and pluralistic perspectives.\n\nI know that, at least in the United States, many of our colleges and universities are facing the pressures of an anemic economy, changing demographics, and increasing costs of education. Many institutions are facing declining enrollments overall. Typically, the declines in enrollments are felt unevenly across programs. Tough decisions often need to be made by weighing the costs and benefits of different programs and whether they should continued to be supported. Before making the decision to close the economics program, I ask you to consider the following:\n\nEconomics at UWS is internationally recognized for its pluralist economics program. Pluralist and heterodox economists are at a unique position to provide insights, understanding, and solutions to the current economic slump or economic crisis faced by many countries.Pluralist and heterodox economic organizations continue to grow in number and visibility and make significant scholarly and policy contributions. This, in turn, is attracting more and more scholars and teachers to include heterodox and pluralistic approaches into their own programs and courses.We would also note, and we are sure that you understand this, enrollments in programs wax and wane. At a time when pluralist economic thinking is experiencing a surge of recognition on both national and international stages, one might also expect a surge in students interested in the program in coming years.Before shutting the program down, can there be consultation with faculty to ask them to think and propose more creative ways that department could be generating more revenue for UWS. It seems that when higher education is faced with tough budgetary conditions, the inclination is to narrow the choices available to students. This may not be the approach that builds the strong and vibrant community of the future where people can have informed discussions from different perspectives. This may not be the approach the builds strong and vibrant scholarly inquiry that will help to shape and create future economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, AFIT asks that you consider how to grow the economics program at UWS rather than shut it down.\n\nExecutive Board: Association for Institutional Thought\n\nPresident: Dr. Barbara Wiens-Tuers, Penn State Altoona\n\nVice President: Dr. John Hall, Portland State University\n\nSecretary/Treasurer: Dr. Mary Wrenn, Weber State University\n\nBoard Members\n\nDr. Reynold Nesiba, Augustana College\n\nDr. Frederic Lee, Past President, UM, Kansas City\n\nDr. Chris Brown, Past President, Arkansas State University\n\nDr. Tae-Hee Jo, SUNY, Buffalo State College\n\nDr. Yan Liang, Willamette University\n\nDr. Tonia Warnecke, Rollins College\n\nHEN Letter to UWS\n\nNovember 11, 2012\n\nDear Clive Smallman, Janice Reid, and Rhonda Hawkins:\n\nWe, the Editors of the Heterodox Economics Newsletter, are deeply concerned about your proposal to close down the Economics Program at the University of Western Sydney. Not only is such an action short-sighted, but also it would remove intellectual assets and reputations that colleagues at the Economics Program have established for many years. We, like many other heterodox economists around the world, are well aware that our colleagues at UWS, such as Steve Keen, Brian Pinkstone, John Lodweijks, Neil Hart, Bill Lucarelli, and Ingrid Schraner, just to name a few, have made great contributions to the discipline of economics as well as, more specifically, heterodox economics.\n\nRemoving such a valuable economics program run by internationally renowned economists would downgrade the quality of pluralistic education at the University of Western Sydney. More importantly, theoretical and practical contributions made by colleagues at the Economics and Finance Program have provided alternative and (we believe) better solutions to the ongoing fiscal problems at the local or national levels around the world.\n\nIn this age of information, students are challenging the orthodox approaches that failed to predict, let alone see, a crisis as severe as the 1930s. A growing awareness of alternative approaches to economics, along with, ironically, the lack of choice within most economics programs, has led to student protests at Harvard University, the international post-autistic economics movement, creation of the inclusive World Economics Association, and a pluralistic movement toward developing a new economic paradigm through the Institute for New Economic Thinking (INET), all culminating in an increasing interest by students in heterodox economics programs.\n\nIn short, we urge you to reconsider your proposal and to take actions to strengthen the Economics Program rather than to shut it down.\n\nSincerely yours,\n\nTae-Hee Jo and Ted P. Schmidt, Editors\n\nHeterodox Economics Newsletter\n\nWolfram Elsner’s Letter to UWS\n\nNovember 9, 2012\n\nDean of School of Business, Clive Smallman\n\nVice-Chancellor, Janice Reid\n\nDeputy Vice-Chancellor, Rhonda Hawkins,\n\nI am writing to you as I just have become aware of the plans to restructure the Business Studies and Economics programmes at the UWS.\n\nTo make it very short: Internationally, this would have to be considered an ideological cleansing of something that has an excellent international reputation. For instance, the work (and textbook) of my colleague, Professor Steve Keen (whom I do not know personally), is widely visible, acknowledged, and his textbook widely used as one of the best non-simplistic textbooks worldwide.\n\nWhile we in Bremen have just received a national excellence status as one out of eleven German universities (out of more than 100 German universities in total), this was with the contribution of a \"heterodox\" economics programme and research agenda. we are able now to expand professoral positions based on \"heterodox\" evolutionary, institutional and complexity economics.\n\nSo you may see that this is something that you could develop as a considerable asset rather than shutting it down.\n\nMy best wishes,\n\nWolfram Elsner\n\nDean of the Curriculum\n\nProfessor of Economics\n\nUniversity of Bremen\n\nFrederic Lee’s Letter to UWS\n\nNovember 19, 2012\n\nProfessor Clive Smallman\n\nDean of School of Business\n\nUniversity of Western Sydney\n\nLocked Bag 1797\n\nPenrith, New South Wales 2751\n\nAustralia\n\nDear Professor Smallman,\n\nI am writing to you concerning the proposal to close the economics program at the University of Western Sydney. Your economics program has gained an international reputation for its pluralist nature and its contributions to the development of heterodox economics. It is perhaps the only other economics department in Australia outside of the Department of Political Economy at the University of Sydney that has a large enough cadre of heterodox economists to provide students with a systematic alternative to mainstream economics while those same students also learn mainstream economics. In all other economics departments in Australia students get taught just mainstream economics—and it is taught to them as absolute truth and without any critical reflection. The same can be said about most economics departments in the United States and the United Kingdom. In an economic crisis of the past few years which has confounded mainstream theory, it is important for at least some universities to sustain and support alternative economic viewpoints. And this can be done without necessarily incurring financial losses.\n\nWhen I came to the University of Missouri-Kansas City in 2000, it had no reputation at all and its undergraduate and graduate programs were quite small. However, over the past decade my department has developed an international reputation for its work in heterodox economics and at the same time its MA and Ph.D. programs have grown by 300%. With this growth in international reputation and student numbers, we have transformed the department from a loss leader to one that actually provides a surplus for the University. Because of the rapidly increasing interest in heterodox economics and the desire by students to have a more pluralistic engagement with economics, the success of UMKC can also be experienced by the economics program at UWS if it had the support of the administration. So it would quite foolhardy and entrepreneurially shortsighted to eliminate a program that has a very great potential to become a growing profit center for UWS.\n\nSincerely,\n\nProfessor Frederic S. Lee\n\nEditor, American Journal of Economics and Sociology\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nUniversity of Missouri-Kansas City\n\nCall for Papers\n\nAssociation for Institutional Thought (AFIT) Annual Conference 2013\n\nApril 10-13, 2013 | Denver, CO\n\nFinal Call for Paper\n\nThe 34th annual meeting of the Association for Institutional Thought (AFIT) is scheduled to be held from April 10th through the 13th, 2013, at the Grand Hyatt Denver, 1750 Welton Street, in downtown Denver, Colorado, USA. AFIT’s 34th annual meeting is held in conjunction with the 55th Annual Conference of the Western Social Science Association (WSSA).\n\nPlease consider submitting a paper topic, or even organizing a whole panel of approximately four papers that includes a moderator and discussants. Our overarching theme for the Denver 2013 Conference:\n\n“Advancing our Heterodox Tradition: Promoting Evolutionary and Institutional Thinking”\n\nEvolutionary and institutional thinking can be rooted in seminal advances of Thorstein Veblen, especially his efforts to recast economics. Veblen’s project sought to extend efforts of Charles Darwin in the natural sciences: to offer a better understanding of our own human prospects through expanding the social sciences to consider evolutionary and institutional thinking. Carrying on Veblen’s project, contributive thinkers such as John R. Commons, Wesley Mitchell, Clarence Ayres, as well as more recent thinkers, such as John Fagg Foster, Marc Tool, Anne Mayhew, Paul Dale Bush, and William Dugger -- offer us inspiration as we seek to further advance and enrich our long-standing, heterodox tradition.\n\nAllen Gruchy dubs our heterodox tradition as an “open system” of thought, allowing us to entertain researchers motivated to explore a wide range of interests in specific topics. Advancing evolutionary and institutional thinking tends to be inclusive. The conference organizer seeks paper proposals, and even whole sessions that consider theoretical topics that engage both institutional as well as other approaches in economics. This could include exploring topics in History of Economic Thought, especially from a heterodox perspective, that, for example, considers ideas of Thorstein Veblen and other major contributors to our thought tradition. A broad set of topics could also include: advancing heterodox microeconomics; promoting the importance of “meso;” combining institutional with post Keynesian inquiry, and research into Feminist Economics. Comparative Economic Systems, Economic Development, and Globalization Studies could be relied upon for practical inquires into countries and some of their challenges, especially related to the ongoing crisis. In addition, proposals dealing with philosophy and also biography, as well a topics not considered herein, certainly interest this conference organizer. AFIT likewise takes a special interest panels that consider pluralism and economic education.\n\nProposals for completed sessions are encouraged – see the submission format below. If proposing a completed session, please arrange discussants of papers and a moderator for the session.\n\nAFIT encourages proposals from graduate students, and it is anticipated that at least one and possibly more panels of graduate student papers will be included in the program. In addition AFIT sponsors prizes and awards for outstanding student papers. A formal announcement of this year’s competition can be found at the AFIT web site.\n\nProposed Format for a “Paper”:\n\nTitle of Paper; Name of Author; Affiliation; Telephone Number; E-mail Address. Other Authors.\n\nAbstract of approximately 200 words, and cast in “New Times Roman” 12.\n\nProposed Format for a “Panel”:\n\nTitle of the Session\n\nTitle of each Paper (appx. 4)\n\nModerator with Affiliation; Mailing Address; Telephone Number, E-mail Address.\n\nDiscussant (s) with Affiliation, Mailing Address; Telephone Number; E-mail Address.\n\nPresenters with Affiliations; Mailing Addresses; Telephone Number; E-mail Address.\n\nAbstract for each paper approximately 200 words, “New Times Roman” 12.\n\nThose interested in attending this AFIT Conference or in finding out more about our organization should visit the AFIT website noted above. Conference registration information can be found at the WSSA website. WSSA offers opportunities for registering in advance.\n\nCurrent membership in AFIT is required for presenting a paper at this Denver conference – no exceptions. A current membership in WSSA is required for participation in the AFIT program. AFIT’s annual membership dues are $25.00, and $15.00 for full-time students. Queries regarding membership can be addressed to Mary Wrenn, AFIT’s Secretary-Treasurer. MW561@cam.ac.uk For consideration, proposals need to be sent to the conference organizer by December 1, 2012. Ideally, send proposals by e-mail, and to afit.denver.program@gmail.com.\n\nCollegially yours,\n\nJohn Hall, AFIT vice-president (2012-13)\n\nDepartment of Economics\n\nPortland State University\n\nOregon, USA.\n\nCritical Governance Conference\n\n10-12 December, 2012 | University of Warwick\n\nFrom Critique to Transformation? Critical Governance Studies in and Beyond Crisis\n\nConference Organiser: Dr. Penelope Tuck, University of Warwick\n\nThe second Critical Governance Conference will be held at the University of Warwick, Monday 10th – Wednesday 12th December 2012. Individual abstract submissions of up to 500 words are welcome from now until 30th November. Please detail your name, institution, paper title, panel (if any) and proposal, and email it to critical.governanceconf@wbs.ac.uk.\n\nProposals for panels and streams are also welcome. Panel proposals should explain the rationale and the abstract for each contributing paper. Stream proposals should explain the overarching rationale, key themes, how many panels there might be and how they will be organized. We have had three proposals for streams so far, but welcome further suggestions and volunteers to coordinate them. If you wish to participate in one of these streams, please mark this clearly on your abstract:\n\nGovernance futures in and beyond capitalism In and against the state' once more? Towards critical governance practices The governance of science and sustainability\n\nConference registration is open here. The price is £250 for three days. Bed and Breakfast will be available at a rate of either £50 or £77 per night (depending on your venue preference) and dinners can be booked for £27 per night. If you have any queries, please email Dr Penny Tuck at critical.governanceconf@wbs.ac.uk.\n\nHistory of Economics Society Annual Meeting\n\nJune 20-22nd, 2013 | University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada\n\nThe organizer of the program and of local arrangements is Professor Margaret Schabas, mschabas@mail.ubc.ca. The deadline to submit an abstract or organized session (3 to 4 papers) is March 1, 2013. Your abstract should be about fifty words. Organized sessions on a specific theme are much preferred. All that is required is a working title for the session and the abstracts by prospective speakers.\n\nFor graduate students or early career scholars (up to two years past your PhD), there are partial funds available from the endowment in honour of Warren and Sylvia Samuels. As a recipient, you would receive $500 toward your travel, plus free registration and one year's membership in HES. Your application is also due on March 1st, 2013. In addition to your abstract, please include documentation of your status as a student or of the completion of your Ph.D.\n\nAll abstracts, session proposals, and applications for the Samuels funds are to be sent to Tyler DesRoches at t.desroches@alumni.ubc.ca\n\nPlease note that the meetings will only run for two and a half days. We will commence on a Thursday afternoon (June 20) at 15:00, and finish on the Saturday evening (June 22) with the customary Presidential address, banquet and awards ceremony. There are no sessions on the Sunday since many east bound flights leave in the morning.\n\nOur opening reception on June 20, following the keynote by Professor Daniel M. Hausman, will be held at the renowned Museum of Anthropology. The museum houses one of the finest collections of First Nations artifacts, and has stunning views of the ocean and city.\n\nFor those wishing to spend more time in Vancouver, on-campus accommodation (hotel suites and dormitory rooms) at reduced rates will also be available for a couple of days both preceding and following the meetings. If you plan to stay for a week, consider accommodation at St. John's College on campus.\n\nAs a major tourist destination, Vancouver is well served by most of the major airlines of North America, Asia, and Europe. There are non-stop flights from New York, Chicago, Detroit, Houston, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Sydney and many major Asian cities. For those on a budget, there are also a number of lesser-known airlines that service Vancouver in the summer months, with direct flights from Paris, Rome, Zurich, etc. Americans might also consider flights to Bellingham WA (forty minutes by car), or Seattle (two hours by car or three-hours by bus).\n\nThe campus is approximately twelve kilometres from the city centre, but is well served by public transit. There is also an excellent monorail service from the airport to the downtown, as well as to a midtown station that connects to an express bus to the campus.\n\nMidwest Labor and Working-Class History (MLWCH) Colloquium\n\nFebruary 15 & 16, 2013 | University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee\n\nThe occupation of the Wisconsin State Capitol in 2011 has become a memory and other occupy movements are either faltering or mustering strength as they celebrate their one year anniversaries. If 2011 was a break-through year for American protest movements, then 2012 is a call for people everywhere to ask “What comes next?” Recent events have challenged us to reconsider solidarity and to try to understand the fragmentation that has characterized 2012.\n\nOrganizers of the 2012 Midwest Labor and Working-Class History Colloquium (MLWCH) are soliciting papers of approximately 10 to 25 pages, from any discipline, broadly related to the themes of building solidarity and understanding the fragmentation of worker’s protest movements.\n\nWe invite papers related to the study of work and working people, labor history, rank-and-file workers, direct action, nonviolence, grassroots organizing, alternative and industrial unionism, labor law, social justice, radicalism, anti-racism, liberation theology and the prison industrial complex. We are interested in work that critiques or suggests new directions for various sub-disciplines related to working-class history, labor scholarship, or historiographies of peoples’ struggles; papers that draw upon historical or contemporary movements that have challenged anti-labor policies and practices; those that examine transnational workers’ or peoples’ struggles; those that draw upon culturally specific or gendered and racialized interactions with capital; and those that analyze working-class artistic expression (visual art, music, etc.).\n\nWe welcome papers that explore innovative approaches to the practice of working-class history, if you are not sure if your paper will fit, go ahead and submit it! All events, including a keynote panel, will be open to the public, and we encourage attendance from a wide array of scholars, activists, teachers, citizens, and students.\n\nPlease direct paper proposals, CVs, and questions regarding the conference, travel, and lodging accommodations to: mlwch2013@gmail.com.\n\nPaper/Panel Proposals due Dec. 1, 2012, Completed Papers due Jan. 13, 2013\n\nInternational Conference of the Middle East Economic Association 2013\n\nMarch 18-20, 2013 | Speyer, Germany\n\nThe Arab Spring and MENA Economies: Quo Vadis?\n\nThe Middle East Economic Association (MEEA) is pleased to announce that it is now accepting abstracts for papers to be presented at the 12th International Conference of MEEA, hold jointly with the German Research Institute for Public Administration, in Speyer, Germany, March 18th to 20th, 2013.\n\nThe main topics will focus on several fields of economic research related to the ongoing transition process in the Middle East and North Africa, the influences on the MENA economies and their relations with the economies of the European Union.

Almost half a decade into the global economic crisis, social scientists concerned with urban issues look at the crisis as a structural condition with which contemporary cities and regions have to deal rather than merely an episodic conjuncture.\n\nAt the city level, the crisis has an ambivalent function. On the one hand, it acts as a disciplining force, accelerating the evolutionary process within local economies as well as rationalizing the ways in which cities are being governed. On the other hand, the crisis reinvigorates the capitalist rationality intrinsic to the urban process, by pushing politico-economic elites to valorize cities as spaces of economic experimentation through a variety of governance and accumulation strategies. Cities are therefore both epicentres and victims of the global crisis as well as places that appear to have the potential to offer solutions to the structural problems affecting capitalist economies. We suggest that these processes are best studied from a renewed political economy perspective on urban re/development and governance. Yet, the urban political economy lens not only offers a perspective from which to study cities, it also offers a rich empirical context from which to study contemporary capitalism.\n\nThis mini-conference looks for contributions addressing the following thematic strands:\n\nCities and late neoliberalism: we understand ‘late neoliberalism’ as a form of neoliberalism permeated by a multidimensional condition of crisis: crises of legitimation (discursive-moral), accumulation (economic-capitalist), governance (political-administrative). How is coping with these multiple crises reshaping the urban experience across the globe? How does this help us rethink the way in which neoliberalism is commonly understood?Cities and the austerity-growth dialectic: in times of crisis, municipal governments are requested to implement austerity measures, but are also expected to devise strategies of economic regeneration. How do urban politico-economic elites deal with this antinomy? What are the adaptation mechanisms, governance structures and institutional capacities being deployed in this context?Cities and financialization: the financialization of home, infrastructure and urban re/development more widely speaking were distinctive features of the expansionary era of neoliberalism. Foreclosures, repossessions and ghost residential spaces as well as overleveraged local governments have then characterized the landscapes of cities after the credit crunch. How are local governments, urban residents and the housing sector responding to the disastrous failures of financialization?Cities and alternative models: cities can be spaces of despair, but also spaces of hope in which grassroots experiments may mature and eventually transcend the local context. If it is true that challenges to hegemonic models rise from alternative models at the local scale, what role can and do specific cities and communities play in such alternative models? How do city residents and local governments try to work outside the box of late neoliberalism?\n\nPlease visit the SASE website for practical instructions.\n\nDeadline for submissions is January 14, 2013.\n\nWorkshop on Corporeal Capitalism: Body Matters in IPE\n\nWednesday 17 April 2013 | University of Birmingham, UK\n\n‘The body’ has emerged as a central concern across the social sciences and humanities, spawning a substantial and multifaceted literature in a range of disciplines such as sociology, law, cultural studies, philosophy, psychology, criminology, geography and history. Yet in the field of International Political Economy the body remains, on the whole, conspicuous by its absence. Indeed, as Charlotte Hooper remarked more than a decade ago, it is ‘supremely ironic’ that a discipline so concerned with the material needs of physical bodies should have been built around abstractions from, not explorations of, embodied social contexts (2000: 31). Feminist scholarship – albeit by no means exclusively – has been at the forefront of attempts to take issues of embodiment seriously within IPE. In particular, it has highlighted how globalisation and capitalism are not ‘out there’ phenomena that are materially or analytically separable from actually-existing human lives but, quite the contrary, ‘impact directly and often violently on the bodies of actual people’ (Pettman, 2000: 52). This special issue takes up calls by feminist scholars to regard the body as central to – indeed, a critical starting point for – the theory and practice of the international political economy. In short, we believe the study of IPE 'as if bodies mattered' can add new and hugely significant theoretical, conceptual and empirical insights to the field.\n\nThis workshop will consider both how and why bodies 'matter' in the international political economy and also how bodies might be positioned more centrally within IPE as a discipline. It has three inter-related aims: first, to interrogate how political and economic processes are inscribed, imprinted and circulated on bodies (Penttinen, 2008); second, to examine how bodies represent ‘sites of contestation' with respect to both power and resistance in the international political economy (Harcourt 2009: 22); and, third, to consider what (the erasure and inclusion of) bodies can tell us about the disciplinary terrain of International Political Economy itself.\n\nThe organisers are looking for submissions that address these conceptual, methodological, empirical and normative issues from a from a diversity of disciplinary perspectives and which take an original, critical approach to the study of body politics within the context of broader debates surrounding globalisation, capitalism and neo-liberalism.\n\nPossible topics include (but are by no means restricted too):\n\n* Capitalism and feminist theory\n\n* Queering and/or transgendering IPE\n\n* The political economy of reproduction and reproductive technologies\n\n* The political economy of eating, hunger and food\n\n* The political economy of beauty, ageing, dis/ability\n\n* Virtual economies and the body in cyberspace\n\n* Neo-liberalism and embodied subjectivities\n\n* Globalisation and bio-ethics\n\n* The commodification of bodies and body parts\n\n* International sex tourism, migration and human trafficking\n\n*White privilege and the economics of racism\n\n* Grey sexual economies\n\n* Medicalisation and capitalism\n\n* Bio-power and the welfare state\n\n* Neo-liberalism and abortion politics\n\n* Economic crisis and social reproduction\n\nPlease send a title, abstract of around 350 words and a brief biography to Nicola Smith (n.j.smith.1@bham.ac.uk) or Donna Lee (d.lee.3@bham.ac.uk) by 21 December 2012. Successful abstract submissions will be notified by January 30, 2013.\n\nWe are planning to co-edit a special issue of a leading IPE journal based on this theme – if you are unable to attend the workshop but would still like your paper to be considered for inclusion in the special issue, please contact Nicola or Donna.\n\nPlease note: We have some (very limited!) funds to support this workshop, so there will be no fee to attend and we can provide accommodation for all paper-givers plus make a contribution towards your travel expenses of up to £50 (for those travelling from within the UK) and £100 (for those travelling from outside the UK).\n\nCall for Participants\n\n4th Latin American Advanced Programme on Rethinking Macro and Development Economics\n\n7 January – 11 January, 2013 | São Paulo School of Economics FGV/SP, Brazil | website\n\nThe programme is mainly intended for young academics.

Home ownership policies usually involve public regulation of extensive mortgage markets, while publicly funded pension schemes rely on returns on financial investment. The impact of financialization on welfare state institutions can be expected to be particularly strong in sectors where large sums of private capital are invested in both domestic and international markets. Most analyses of crisis responses neglect the long-term effects of the politics of austerity on demographic trends and household behaviour, including birth rates. Housing, pensions and family formation form an indivisible policy triangle: the financialization of housing purchases influences the nature of the pension system; the long term stability of the pension system depends on the fertility level; the overall level of fertility depends on the age at which couples form independent households and enter the housing market.\n\nInvited speakers are: Herman Schwartz (University of Virginia), Brigitte Young (University of Münster), Paul Langely (Durham University), Deborah Mabbett (University of London), Manuel Aalbers (University of Leuven), Lindsay Flynn (University of Virginia), Jonathan Hopkin (London School of Economics), Karen Anderson (Radboud University Nijmegen), Ewald Engelen(University of Amsterdam), Eleni Tsingou (Copenhagen Business School) and Waltraud Schelkle(London School of Economics).\n\nFor more information, visit the symposium website.\n\nLeeds University Business School Seminar Series\n\nSummary of Updated Program:\n\n28th November: Wendy Carlin (UCL): Soviet Power plus Electrification: What is the long-run Legacy of Communism? 5th December: Charles Goodhart (LSE): The Euro: Past, Present and Future? 12th December: Peter Skott (UMASS): An Empirical Evaluation of Three Post Keynesian Models\n\nFor information, contact:\n\nAnnina Kaltenbrunner: A.Kaltenbrunner@leeds.ac.uk\n\nLecturer in the Economics of Globalisation & The International Economy\n\nLeeds University Business School\n\nSeminar on Political Economy: Karl Polanyi in perspective\n\nMonday, December 3, 2012, from 15h to 17h30 | House of Economics, Room 17 (ATTENTION NEW LOCATION), 106-112 boulevard de l'Hôpital 75013 Paris, Metro Campo Formio, bus 57, 67, 27, 83 or 47 (Texts map: https://sites.google.com/site/seminairedeconomiepolitique)\n\nJerome Maucourant (Université Jean Monnet Saint Etienne) and Bernard Chavance (Université Paris 7-Denis Diderot): Karl Polanyi in perspective\n\nThe debate will be introduced by: Pierre Alary (Université Lille 1)\n\nFor more information, download a flyer.\n\nCall for Panelists\n\nHeterodox Microeconomics Session at the AHE 2013 Conference\n\n4-6 July 2013 | Centre for Socio-Economic Research (Cf SER), London Metropolitan University\n\nI would like to organize one or two sessions on heterodox microeconomics.

ISBN : 978-2-912107-64-0 | website\n\nCe petit livre clair et concis est devenu un classique pour se familiariser avec Le Capital, l'œuvre majeure de Marx. Depuis près de trente ans, il a été réédité sans cesse en anglais et traduit dans de nombreuses langues. Le voici enfin disponible en français. Cette traduction de la cinquième édition de Marx's Capital vient donc combler un manque pour ceux qui n'ont jamais vraiment lu Marx. Simple sans simplisme, elle constitue une introduction idéale à l'un des textes les plus importants de l'économie politique. Les auteurs présentent ici les concepts et les mécanismes clés que propose Marx pour comprendre le fonctionnement d'une économie capitaliste. Plus largement, ils s'intéressent à l'impact que Marx a pu avoir sur la science économique, la philosophie et l'ensemble des sciences sociales. En même temps, ce texte très accessible fait apparaître l'actualité de l'analyse de Marx et sa pertinence pour déchiffrer la crise profonde du capitalisme aujourd'hui.\n\nDollars & Sense Books\n\nCurrent Economic Issues (16th ed.) is completely updated, with the latest news and analysis on U.S. and global issues, including the ongoing economic crisis, deficits and debt, labor and unions, inequality, the environment, and much more.\n\nReal World Globalization (12th ed.) is an essential guide to rapidly changing trends in the global economy.

Hodgson\n\nNovember 2012. University of Chicago Press. ISBN-13: 978-0-226-92271-3 | website\n\nIn line with recent research from the evolutionary and behavioural sciences, I argue that humans are generally morally motivated as well as self-interested. Morality is much more than convenience or convention. Given the nature of morality, moral motivation is essentially incompatible with utilitarianism, preference functions and much of mainstream economics. And my suggestion is more than simply adding a 'moral dimension' because we have to understand the evolutionary origins and foundations of moral sentiments. There are heavy doses of both Charles Darwin and Adam Smith in my arguments. I also believe that we cannot understand institutions properly unless we appreciate moral motivation.\n\nIn an attempt to operationalise this approach in policy terms, I link in with work on basic needs, where needs (the desirable) are distinguished from wants (the desired). Perceptions of need are often spurs for motivation, as illustrated by workers in the health service, for example. Problems such as climate change cannot be resolved by focusing on self-interest without an appeal to moral values. I conclude by sketching a general evolutionary approach to policy.\n\nInterventions: 17 Interviews with Unconventional Economists (2004-2012)\n\nEdited by Stefan Ederer, Eckhard Hein, Torsten Niechoj, Sabine Reiner, Achim Truger, Till van Treeck\n\nMetropolis Verlag, 2012. ISBN 3895189383, 9783895189388 | website\n\nThe interviews with unconventional economists published in this book are reprints from a bi-annual Germany-/Austria-based journal which started as INTERVENTION. Zeitschrift für Ökonomie / Journal of Economics in 2004 and which was re-launched with Metropolis Publisher in 2008 as INTERVENTION. European Journal of Economics and Economic Policies. The unconventional economists interviewed for the journal from 2004 to 2012 are leading and well-known experts in their fields of research and they have contributed to the development of non-neoclassical economics to a significant degree. Especially for the younger generation of critical economists their work is of particular interest and a point of reference.\n\nThe Making of Global Capitalism: The Political Economy of American Empire\n\nBy Sam Gindin and Leo Panitch\n\nOctober 2012. Verso Books. ISBN: 9781844677429 | website\n\nIn this groundbreaking work, Leo Panitch and Sam Gindin demonstrate the intimate relationship between modern capitalism and the American state, including its role as an “informal empire” promoting free trade and capital movements. Through a powerful historical survey, they show how the US has superintended the restructuring of other states in favor of competitive markets and coordinated the management of increasingly frequent financial crises.\n\nMeme Wars: The Creative Destruction of Neoclassical Economics\n\nBy Kalle Lasn and Adbusters\n\nNovember 2012. Penguin Press (UK). ISBN: 9781846146985 | website\n\nOver the last twenty years, Adbusters magazine has challenged consumerism, championed the environment and provided a platform for some of our greatest thinkers. In 2011, they instigated Occupy Wall Street, sparking a huge international movement.\n\nNow Kalle Lasn, editor and founder of Adbusters, brings us this thought provoking book, which provides the building blocks, in texts and visuals, for a new way of looking at and changing our world. Illustrated in the distinctive style of the magazine and drawing on a brilliant cast of contributers, Meme Wars debunks many of the assumptions about how we run our societies today. Placing fresh emphasis on the environmental and human factors that are often left out in discussions of economics and examining alternative economies, Meme Wars is designed to be 'a textbook for the future' - one that brings to light inspiring ideas for positive change.\n\nMeme Wars will be launched November 13 by Seven Stories Press in the US, Random House in Canada, Penguin in the UK, and Reimann in Germany. As global civilization tips ever closer toward ecocide, industrial burnout, and nightfall, Meme Wars offers a blueprint out of the maze. It calls for a shift in the theoretical foundations of economic science.\n\nCheck out the Guardian review here, and view ten images here.\n\nIf you’d like to take a look at the digital version, contact andrea bennett at andrea@adbusters.org.\n\nInternational Economics: A Heterodox Approach, 2nd ed.\n\nBy Hendrik Van den Berg\n\nM.E.

Palgrave Macmillan. ISBN: 9780230303584 | website\n\nSince the thermo-industrial revolution the human imprint on the Biosphere has become so important that some scientists speak of a new geological era, the 'Anthropocene.' The current financial, social and energy crises need to be understood in this irreversible context, and require a new kind of economic thinking. Conventional theory and practice has failed to take account of the scale and significance of this unparalleled historical situation.\n\nThis book examines the rich intellectual traditions of heterodox economics - particularly ecological and critical institutional economics - toprovide guidelines for an alternative paradigm for this new age. The authors develop key integrative concepts such as social metabolism, value pluralism, evolution and community, gathering together some of the world's foremost heterodox economists.\n\nTowards a Sustainable and Equitable Society: Insights from Heterodox Economics and Psychoanalysis\n\nBy Arturo Hermann\n\nNovember 2012. Aracne editrice. ISBN: 978-88-548-5194-8 | website\n\nIn recent years, after the collapse of the central planned economies and the failure of the neo-liberalist policies of today, it has emerged a growing awareness of the need to find a \"third way to economic and social progress\"�. In our work, we focus attention on how a systematic collaboration between heterodox economics and psychoanalysis can help to achieve this objective. We explore the potential of this interdisciplinary perspective for (i) attaining a deeper insight into the causes of economic and social imbalances of our days; and, on this basis, (ii) for realizing a roadmap of policy action targeted at the solutions of the most urgent economic and social problems. In this way, the transition from the \"mixed capitalism\"� of today, heavily influenced by powerful interest groups, to more sustainable and equitable social systems would no longer be considered as a kind of socialist utopia but as a feasible objective to be pursued with a new course of policy action.\n\nPh.D Dissertations in Heterodox Economics\n\nEmployment Generation Programs and Long-term Development- the Case of India’s National Rural Employment Generation Act\n\nBy Poulomi Dasgupta (pdxr5@mail.umkc.edu)\n\nDepartment of Economics, University of Missouri, Kansas City, USA.\n\nAdvisor: Dr. Mathew Forstater\n\nThe impact of neo-liberal policies on labor and employment opportunities in developing countries like India has been less than satisfactory due to deteriorating labor market conditions and slow growth of employment opportunities and hence employment generation programs need to be at the center of any policy debate. The purpose of this dissertation is to study the role of government in employment generation and the impact of employment generation on long-term development. In order to do so, the case of India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee Act has been taken as a case study. The study argues that employment generation programs by the government is not only important to create much needed jobs, but is also necessary for long term development of the country. The study concludes that the impact of an employment generation program is not limited to a narrowly understood concept of economic growth. Instead, by using an alternate understanding of development; namely the capability approach to development; it can be concluded that employment generation has long lasting impact on the development of rural communities. Fieldwork in two states of India have been used as evidence to support this argument. To make the case for employment generation, various approaches have been used including Marxian, post colonial and heterodox approaches that include Keynesian and Kaleckian framework.\n\nHeterodox Economics in the Media\n\nA Post-Keynesian Pioneer Meets the University of Chicago\n\nA nice piece on Paul Davidson visiting and lecturing at the University of Chicago, here.\n\nQueries from Heterodox Economists\n\nHeterodox Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC)\n\nDear Ted and Tae-Hee\n\nCould you ask members of Heterodox News if any of them are developing any Massive Open Online Courses? I know that the Santa Fe Institute is doing one for complexity economics but it would be good to know if there are similar courses for Post Keynesian, Institutionalist, Marxian, Feminist economics etc. I know there are some orthodox MOOC’s that have tens of thousands of students, so it may be something that some heterodox economists might have to turn their mind (if only to keep up with the competition). On the upside, MOOC’s could work well for heterodoxy. As soon as I get a chance I will apply myself to trying to create a MOOC, but I am sure others could run with this idea sooner, bigger and better than myself, so it seems timely to put this idea up for everyone to think about.\n\nThanks for all your great work and hello to all my fellow ‘hexy’s’ out there!\n\nTim Thornton\n\nSchool of Economics\n\nLa Trobe University\n\nMelbourne\n\nt.thornton@latrobe.edu.au\n\nCall For Support\n\nPetition to support Economics Program at University of Western Sydney\n\nYou can sign the petition to support the program here.\n\nFor Your Information\n\nAFEE 2013 Awards\n\nThe recipient of the Veblen-Commons Award for 2013 is Malcom Rutherford.
