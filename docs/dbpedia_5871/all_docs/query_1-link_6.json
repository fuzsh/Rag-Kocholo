        "text": "Gérard Debreu became famous as a French economist and mathematician. Born on July 4, 1921, in Calais, France, Debreu had an early interest in mathematics and earned a degree in mathematics from the University of Paris in 1941. During World War II, he was recruited by the French government to work in the resistance.\n\nAfter the war, Debreu continued his studies in mathematics at the University of Paris and received his doctorate in mathematical economics in 1953. His pioneering work in the field of mathematical economics earned him international recognition and he became a professor in economics at Yale University in 1955.\n\nDebreu is best known for his formulation of the general model of economic equilibrium, known as the “Debreu model”. This model has provided insight into the principles of economics and has been widely used in economic research. For his contributions to economics, Debreu received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1983. Gérard Debreu died on December 31, 2004 in Paris, leaving behind a lasting legacy in the field of mathematical economics.\n\nGérard Debreu, born in 1921 and died in 2004, was a French economist widely recognized as one of the great thinkers of the 20th century in his field. He is best known for his major contributions to general equilibrium theory and game theory. Debreu was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1983 for his groundbreaking work on general equilibrium theory, which established the solid mathematical foundations of the discipline. His work has played a crucial role in improving the understanding of economic interactions, prices and exchanges in markets.\n\nHis research was characterized by a rigor and mathematical precision that elevated economics to a higher level of formalization and rigor. Debreu was also known for his analytical mind and his ability to simplify complex problems, which allowed him to develop powerful and influential economic models. In addition to his theoretical work, Debreu also contributed to practical problem solving, notably when he worked for the U.S. government during World War II.\n\nHe was also a dedicated teacher and mentor to many economists who followed in his footsteps. In summary, Gérard Debreu was a world-renowned economist whose work had a profound influence on modern economic theory. His analytical mind, his mathematical rigor and his ability to simplify complex problems made him one of the most important economists of his time.\n\nGérard Debreu, famous French economist, was born on July 4, 1921 in Calais, into a family of Corsican origin. His family’s origins date back to Corsica, where several generations lived before his grandfather, Pierre Debreu, who emigrated to the continent in the 19th century. His father, Christine Debreu, was a grain trader and had extensive knowledge of the agricultural market.\n\nHis mother, Pauline Debreu, was a housewife devoted to the education of Gérard and his siblings. Gérard Debreu showed great aptitude in mathematics from a young age, and thanks to the encouragement of his parents, he was able to continue his higher education. He obtained a degree in mathematics at the University of Paris and then entered the École Normale Supérieure.\n\nDuring World War II, Debreu was drafted and served in the French army. After the war, he joined the faculty of the University of Paris, where he completed a doctoral program in economics. Gérard Debreu became a professor of economics at the University of Paris in 1955, and in 1960 he was invited to join the University of California at Berkeley as a research professor of mathematical economics.\n\nHe spent most of his career in the United States, where he contributed significantly to the development of economic theory and mathematical methods that have shaped the field of modern economics. He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1983 for his work on general equilibrium. Gérard Debreu died on December 31, 2004 in Paris, leaving behind an important intellectual legacy and a worldwide reputation in the field of economics."
