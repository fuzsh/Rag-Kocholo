Artorias // Hardcore // Quad Cities, IA

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re planning on recording at least one demo this year, probably 3 or 4 songs, hopefully within the next month.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re routing/booking a tour down to Austin, Texas in March to do some showcases around SXSW. Later this month, we’re actually playing with Full of Hell in Des Moines, Iowa, which is really tight because that band has had so much influence on us. As far as fests, we’ve been asked about a few happening around the summer, but they haven’t been announced yet.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

We really want to tour the west coast and get something out on vinyl. None of us have ever pressed anything on vinyl, so I think that’s something we’re all really eager to do.

Anything else to add?

Thank you so much for interviewing us, and a special shout-out to the Taco Bell Dollar Menu and BABYMETAL, for without them we would surely perish. [CS]

Backpacks // Emo/Pop Punk // Mount Pleasant, MI

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We have two new songs featured on a compilation that is being released by Save Your Generation in the very near future. The compilation also includes songs from some of our best friends, and I believe there are talks of it getting pressed to vinyl. At the beginning of the year, we also finished recording a brand new EP with our pal Nick Diener at Oneder Studios in Saginaw, Michigan. We had a blast putting our brains (and our pedal boards) together and are very proud of the end product.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have a brief east coast tour this spring that we’ll be announcing soon, and a few random things around the Midwest. It’s still early in the year, but the plan is to see more of the country and make more friends! I don’t know that we’re cool enough for festivals quite yet, but who knows? We’ll see what happens, I suppose.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Besides the obvious goals of putting out new music and touring, I think it’s really important (especially in the current state of things) to really take advantage of this small platform we’ve built over the last couple years. 2017 is going to be the year that we start giving back to our scene and to our community because without it, nothing that we’ve done or will do would be possible. While I don’t know that our actions could ever accurately express our gratitude, we might as well try.

Anything else to add?

We just want to extend a massive thank you to anyone and everyone that has been a part of our journey thus far. Despite how terrifying the world is right now, please know that your voice is important and you CAN make a difference. [CS]

Barricades // Melodic Hardcore // Muncie, IN // interview with Austin Glidden, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We just finished tracking a 4-song EP we’re releasing in February. All of the music on the EP was music from Inheritors, the old band name prior to me coming in. I changed the lyrics out of respect to the former vocalist and most of those songs are 2-4 years old. We’re currently writing and fine-tuning three new tracks that really show where we’re trying to go. These new songs will be on a split later this year, probably, maybe early 2018. We can’t say who we’re doing a split with yet, but we’re talking with an awesome band right now that we’re super pumped to work with! We’ve been writing like machines lately, so I’m sure there will be more updates about new music as we move through 2017.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have an EP release show set for February 24th at the Hoosier Dome in Indianapolis. It’s going to be so fun! Current lineup: Cold Shoulder (Toronto), Grave Friends (Cincinnati), and some TBA local support. If anyone has any festivals we can hop on, I’m sure we’d do it!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

To grow and keep having fun! We play between Muncie and Indianapolis all the time, which is great! But we’re ready to move around a bit, too. Fort Wayne, Kokomo, more Cincinnati shows, Louisville, Detroit, Chicago even. We play because we love it, and any chance we get to share what we’ve created with more people is part of what makes this all so fun!

Anything else to add?

Follow us on Facebook (.com/Barricadestheband), Twitter (@BarricadesIN), Instagram (Barricades_IN), and Youtube to keep up with all things Barricades. We will be posting updates on all of this and more. We’d love to hang, so come out to a show and have some fun with us! [CS]

BITE // Hardcore // Bloomington, IL // interview with Chris Biggs, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We have a 2-track promo that we recorded with our good friend Derick Goodson of No Victory and that’s set to be released very soon. We hope to put it out on tape through some friends or ourselves.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have a lot of badass shows coming up in the next few months. playing with some of our favorite Midwest bands and out of state homies like JOY, Revenge Season, Detriment, Incited and we have some shows coming up with Kharma and Bruise. We don’t have any plans for long tours right now but I’m sure we’ll do some short runs and weekenders around the Midwest.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

We as a band really just want to get out there. We’re still new and we feel like we have to keep grinding and pushing to get our name out. We have tons of support from our friends and other bands and we just want to travel and play cool shows with them. Being a new band from the Midwest, we really have to step our game up. Our scene is flooded with so many badass bands, SHOUT OUT TO: Kharma, Bruise, Capitol Offense, Backbone, No victory, The Truth, Great Minds, Purgatory, and we have to pay our dues.

Anything else to add?

There’s so much love that we have for all the homies and we just wanna play solid shows with all of our friends, travel to different states and meet new people. 2017 for BITE is a year of growth and that’s all we’re gonna keep doing. Be on the lookout for the promo and more news about shows we have coming up. This is our year and we’re excited to show everyone what’s in store. [KA]

Broadcast City // Metalcore // Indiana // interview with Ryan McJury, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

2017 is going to be a big year for Broadcast City. We’ve underwent several major changes since our last show since we went into the studio to start tracking Here After even, and we couldn’t be more stoked. Over the course of the last two years, we’ve written and re-written our set, fine tuning it along the way. Here After has allowed us to show the more edgy side of our music and going forward, we are taking a slightly different approach. We’ve been working on a lot of new material that follows the same general feel that we went with previously, but it is now allowing us to open up more musically. We’ve decided to make the change from a 5-piece (or 6-piece originally) to a 4-piece band. Ryan McJury will be doing most of the vocals which will allow the music to be much catchier and give it a slightly different vibe overall. Ryan Benedict will be doing all the ‘tougher’ parts, so no worries! We will still have our same tough side we have now, the music will just have much more singing than it used to. A lot of the feedback that we received was that everyone seemed to really dig the singing parts and it left them wanting more—we’ve got you! Additionally, Ryan Moore will be doing a lot of the harmonies and additional singing parts as well. We’ve grown tremendously over the last two years and we couldn’t be more stoked about the future.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We are looking to play as many shows as possible this year and are interested in tours as they become available. We want to get back out and support our local scene and all of our close friends. At this point, with undergoing changes and writing/recording Here After, we are long overdue to start playing shows again. Look for announcements on that very soon!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

For 2017, we really just want to play as much as possible and focus on the music as a whole. We are incredibly excited for people to hear the product of what we’ve worked so long and hard on. We want to make a name for ourselves and make our mark on the scene.

Anything else to add?

We will be releasing physical copies of Here After very soon along with additional merch as well. I can’t give too many details on this yet, but be on the lookout!

As a side note, we would just like thank you all for taking the time and supporting us throughout the last couple years and we hope to keep your continued support going further! [CS]

Bruise // Hardcore/Metal // Indiana // interview with Trae Roberts, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

I suppose what better time to go ahead and say it publicly than now: In the spring of 2017 we will be releasing a 4-song split with Capitol Offense from Illinois. Keep an eye out for a release date on that very soon. The songs are basically a whole new outlook on Bruise in comparison to Wrongful Death, and we are absolutely ecstatic to share them with everyone. After that, keep an eye out for a small release in the fall as well as a BIG release at the very beginning of 2018.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

I can’t say too much right now as far as details, but let’s just say we have tours booked and/or in the works for every month besides Febraury up until July. Currently, those will be with bands from Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, and California. That’s all I’ll say. [Since this interview, Bruise have announced an east coast spring break tour with The Language.]

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

One main goal we have for ourselves is pretty simple: By the end of 2017, we want to have played 48 states in the U.S. (obviously excluding Hawaii and Alaska) and dip our toes into Canada a little as well. [LVH]

Capitol Offense // Hardcore // Decatur, IL // interview with Tyler Brown, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

So far for 2017, we have a music video/single that will be out at the start of February, a split with our good friends in Bruise titled “Moral Dissension” this spring, and a new EP toward the end of this year. This music is some of the best stuff I’ve ever been involved in making, and we can’t wait to get it out and share it with everyone.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

There isn’t a lot of details I can really let out as far as touring goes just yet, but we have some big plans for this year, and will be hitting a lot of new regions with some of our best friends.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

We plan on maturing in our sound, and releasing our best music possible, while touring to as many new cities and regions as we can manage.

Anything else to add?

Support The JïG, Bruise, War Prayer, Frustrated XXX (CA), Backroom Printshop, Short Leash, No Victory, New Heart Crew, Backbone, Kharma, Swing Low, Seeing Red, Artorias, Young Love (CA), Fortune’s Fool, Love Spell, Burdened, Wicked World, Lowered AD, By A Thread Print Co., X’d Up Hands, The Arkham Agency, JJ’s Bar And Grill, and if I forgot any of our friends bands, I’m sorry. Go to any show you can, and give as much support as possible to whatever local scene you find yourself a part of. [KA]

Chipped Teeth // Hardcore // Indianapolis, IN

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

New music is something we’ve talked about, but we’re just letting it happen naturally. We just put out a new record that we worked really hard on a few months ago. As far as new stuff, only time will tell.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

Touring is kind of out of the cards for us. We took a long break to figure some things out personally, and from here on we’re really looking at this as something fun to do because we all enjoy music. No endgame in mind. Nothing huge booked as of right now.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Overall for 2017: Have fun. Write something we’re proud of. Play shows we enjoy. All we want to do is have a good time. Other than that, we’re just gonna let everything fall into place as it’s supposed to. [LVH]

Concealer // Rock // Louisville, KY // interview with Alex Reyes, vocalist/guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

For early 2017 we have a split release coming out with some good friends from Louisville and have high hopes of releasing our second EP in the fall.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have a 10-day Midwest tour we’ll be announcing very soon for February and are currently working out some details on two more for late spring and early summer. We haven’t been asked to play any festivals but with everything else, we’re certainly hoping to have a pretty busy year.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

As working musicians, our goal is to continue playing shows in different cities as much as possible. We hope to be invited to play more venues around the country. We ultimately wish to make a home of everywhere we go.

Anything else to add?

We’re extremely grateful for the support we’ve received in this first year alone. Thank you for making us feel like a band. [CS]

Continue The Story // Post-Rock/Alternative // Fort Wayne, IN // interview Christian Baer, vocalist/drummer

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We were very excited to release our sophomore EP, Contingency, back in fall of 2016. We spent the whole summer recording and perfecting it and we’re very pleased with how it turned out. As a follow up effort, we are releasing our first 4-song split with our friends in Tuesday Atlas (Fort Wayne Grunge). The release date for this split will be February 24 of this year, which we are anxiously awaiting. Past that, we have confirmed to do an additional 4-song split with We Love You! They are some of our closest friends, so the opportunity to collaborate with them is going to be incredible! That should be released sometime this May.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We followed the release of Contingency with a 6-date tour last fall. This was our second time touring. As much as we love getting on the road for a week at a time, 2017 will focus mainly on weekend runs, going out and playing regional shows for a long weekend. This will allow us to branch out to new cities and fans, while minimizing expenses and booking time. We believe this will allow us to play for more people than doing a single, annual tour. We do anticipate playing the Leilapalooza, not Lollapalooza [Laughs], festival in Battle Creek, Michigan this July. This would be our third time playing the festival, it’s just good vibes. The music is varied and any local and regional acts are encouraged to apply!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

The goal for 2017 is to write our best music yet. The addition of Noah Mitchell on bass guitar last spring really propelled our writing into high gear. The material developed since has been our best to date. 2017 is the year of continuing that process. Other than that, we would like to expand our audience via weekend tours. Overall, have fun playing our music and lots of camping while on the road!

Anything else to add?

We aren’t afraid to travel to play shows, in fact, we enjoy it. We would love to make new connections with other artists, especially outside our immediate area. Bands coming through Fort Wayne should look us up, as we are happy to do show swaps. Other than that, follow Ian Skeans on Instagram, because his cats are really cute! [CS]

Counter Theory // Alternative // Valparaiso, IN // interview with T.J. Richmond, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re working on new music and will hopefully be able to start playing some new songs live soon. We’re hoping to record an acoustic EP before our next full band release, and we have a good amount of cover ideas in the works.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’ve been getting a good amount of show opportunities this year already! Most of the shows are at places we’ve never played too, so that’s a plus! We’re also working on planning some type of tours. And, we have a pretty cool show we can’t announce yet!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal is to continue to meet more musicians and fans of music, and make friends with them. Also, we want to share our music with more and more people. We just want people to give local musicians a chance. [KA]

Cut The Tongue // Hardcore // Des Moines, IA // interview with Ryan Hadley, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We will be releasing our second EP entitled Harsh Times at the end of January. Some of the darkest and heaviest stuff we’ve written so far as a band. We’re very excited for everyone to hear it. We also hope to release a split EP sometime this year as well.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We plan on doing a small trek run sometime in the spring to early summer, playing places we haven’t been to yet, so it’ll be a lot of fun to reach out to a lot of people in different hardcore scenes and just going from there! We’re in the planning processes as we speak.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Release more new music and play a lot of places we haven’t been to before. I hope we accomplish a lot with the music we’ll be putting out. We hope a lot of people enjoy the music we’ll put out for them to jam.

Anything else to add?

Thanks for anyone who’s listened to us already. We’ll see you on the road soon! Listen to: Bruise, Capitol Offense, War Prayer, Short Leash, Backbone, Kharma, Wits End, Chain Of Command, More Weight, Love Spell, Artorias, and Submerged. [CS]

Decline // Straight Edge Hardcore // Chicago, IL // interview with Chad Rapper, drummer

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We just got done recording five new songs that we’re really stoked about. The plan right now is to find a label in the US that will put it out. We have a couple we’re talking to, so we’ll see what happens. A label from Europe called Ride & Hun re-packaged our demo and sold a lot of them out there and they already asked to put out the new material as a 7″ out there so once it’s fully mixed and mastered, they’ll be doing that.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

Right now, in terms of shows, we’re playing a bunch around Chicago but are also focusing on neighboring states too. One show we’re super stoked on will be at the beginning of April when we’ll be playing with the legendary Slapshot! That show is on April 2, and we’re also working on shows in Michigan on March 31, Grand Rapids on April 1, Chicago with Slapshot on April 2 and then Milwaukee on April 3. Also, later in the summer we plan to hit California for a week so we’re looking forward to that.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal is to get out there and play as many shows as we can and just continue trying to spread a positive message and continue loving this crazy thing we call hardcore. Lastly, lots of people get into straight edge and hardcore when they’re young, and with three of us in the band being married and a couple of us with kids, we want to also show people that being straight edge or being into hardcore doesn’t have to fade just because you’ve gotten older and started “adulting.” [CS]

Drained // Post-Hardcore // Peoria, IL // interview with Koby Ward, vocalist/guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We are releasing a 3-song demo in January that’s being recorded by Guthrie Moore, and we are in the middle of writing an EP that we plan to release some time in 2017.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

So far, we only have one weekend tour planned in March with our friends in Mended but we plan to add more tours under our belt this year. We have a couple shows we are really excited to play, Ghost Key’s record release in March in our hometown and Planes Mistaken For Stars in January, and we are playing AudioFeed music festival again in July and we really excited about that.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal for 2017 is to play as many out-of-state shows as possible. As far as accomplishments go, we just want to keep progressing as a band and keep making music we love.

Anything else to add?

We would also like to add that we wouldn’t make any progress if wasn’t for all the support we get at home and from our friends across the Midwest. [CS]

El Famous // Metal // Chicago, IL // interview with Kevin Singleton, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We are releasing a new album in the spring titled The Eulogy. The album touches on the topic of loss and how we have to learn how to cope and live again after traumatic loss.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

No tours or festivals yet. Our singer is expecting a baby boy in May and we will be taking this summer off so he can focus on being a father.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Just release this new album and play as many shows as we can given the situations our personal lives have happening.

Anything else to add?

Thank you for this, we look forward to releasing the album. Maybe you’d like to do a review? [KA]

Empty // Metal // Auburn, IN

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’ve been writing some new tunes to follow up our 2016 release, Of Calamity and Sorrow. We’ve begun experimenting with 7-string guitars, incorporating even more influences into our electric sound. We’re excited to continue the stories we wrote on Calamity. The characters we introduced still have a lot of stories to tell.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’ve just started booking shows again after taking a couple months off. Nothing we can announce yet, but there’s some very cool shows lined up we’re excited about!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our goal from day one has been to as creative as possible and to have as much fun as possible. We have several other musical projects we’re trying to get off the ground, and our guitarist has a baby boy due in June. So, Empty is just purely for fun. Always has been, always will be.

Anything else to add?

Check us out on Bandcamp: Emptyindiana.bandcamp.com. Thanks to all our friends and family who’ve supported us through the ups and downs. We love you all so much. Keep an eye out for us this year! [CS]

Gape // Glitter Grunge // Marion, IN // interview with Rudy Valdez, vocalist/guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

In 2017, we will be working on performing some of the newer songs that have pushed from beyond the depths and hopefully recording along the way too. After coming forward with our first EP Seduce me, I’m Nothing, we have decided to push forward with our brand of “glitter grunge” into the realm of the occult and dive into darker waters. We will be adding our doomy, and quite frankly, BDSM influenced undertones to the realities of evil and designing a handful of songs to hopefully bring the audience a little closer to us. It’s a strange but hopefully reward process that I think will appeal to the right amounts of listeners. Human nature, the taboo, and evil have become our muses.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’ve been stumbling into the new year hoping for more open spots to present ourselves and meet as many people as we can. Our current dates will be February 4 in Marion, Indiana at The Green Room and February 25 at Be Here Now in Muncie, Indiana. We will be supporting our dear friends from Brooklyn (Scarboro), and March 12 at the Melody Inn in Indianapolis, Indiana with one of the most highly rated live bands from New York (Studeyed). We are definitely open to book throughout the year! As far as touring, we have not started any plans for it yet but are hopeful to find enough target audience and support to begin plans! Most of the bandmates (besides Rudy) have played festivals with their other bands but would we would most certainly be interested if ever presented the opportunity.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal this year is to be as present in the music community as any other band and truly connect with the vibrant musical communities all around us. It has been freeing to just share intimate moments with so many amazing new friends and looking forward to new friends to come. We hope to stay relevant all while keeping our emotions and music as accessible as possible for our supporters. We are always trying our best to support our fellow musicians as well!

Anything else to add?

This will be our second year as a full band together and we are so excited to experience more with you all. Planned Parenthood Forever! Stay informed and thank you Broken Record Press for reaching out to us. [CS]

Ghost Key // Hardcore // Peoria, IL // interview with Chris Bayless, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

In just under a month from now, we release our debut full-length album If I Don’t Make It. In our opinion, we’ve improved our craft and really are putting out something we can be proud of. If you liked our first single “Indecision,” then be ready for more to come in the same vain.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re still planning out moves for the rest of the year but we’re currently gearing up for a full US tour with our friends in Silent Planet, Hail the Sun, and Dayseeker. We’re hitting almost every state in the country so if you’re reading this we’re probably ripping a gig near you!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

This year, we just want to tour hard and hit new places we haven’t been as well as return to places we haven’t been in years. Overall just trying to share our music with new people and share our message for those that want to listen.

Anything else to add?

Our full-length If I Don’t Make It drops on February 17 via InVogue Records! Preorder at https://store.invoguerecords.com/collections/ghost-key and come see us on tour! [CS]

Gold Route // Detroit, MI // Pop Punk

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

2017 will be an important year for us. We finished our first full-length Prosper back in November and plan on releasing it along with a music video sometime around May. It’s been difficult to be patient and sit on these songs, but we’re proud and confident with everything that ended up on this record. We know the waiting will be worth it.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We just bought our first van yesterday and plan on playing in as many new places as possible. In May, we’ll be doing an east coast run with our friends in Tranquility and a run down South with Silver Age in June. Other than that, we try to play all over Michigan when possible—our home scene will always be important to us. On February 11, we’ll be playing the Crofoot Ballroom in Pontiac, Michigan with Stories Untold, Narco Debut and some other friends.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

The overall goal is just to get our music to as many new ears as possible, and in turn get people out to shows. The energy of great shows are what keep us going.

Anything else to add?

Stoked to put out new music in 2017 and hope to see some new faces! [CS]

Great Minds // Hardcore // Nashville, TN

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We just put out our latest EP No Rules. Just Hell. on January 4, 2017. As for the rest of the year, we plan on releasing a full-length either late 2017 or early 2018. We just definitely want to take our time and invest all we have into this. It’s going to be mean and it’s going to be groovy.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We plan on heading back out on a tour in spring and we’re doing a little run in the summer. But until then, we have some single shows coming up. One of them is with our buds in Mara at Swayze’s in Marietta, Georgia with Wicked World. Both are sick bands so we’re definitely excited for that. We have a fest in mind up in Michigan in mid-November called Take Hold Fest so hopefully that goes through!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal in 2017 is to put out our full-length, grow as individuals as well as bandmates, and tour as much as we can.

Anything else to add?

We just want to say thank you to everybody who listens to our music. Thank you to the people that have made hardcore the community that it is. Without hardcore and the genuine people we’ve met through it, we wouldn’t be the band we are, and we definitely wouldn’t be the people we are. So thank you to everybody that’s involved that has made this a place where we can be free. Also shout out to Nashville Hardcore for being our home and having such an awesome and welcoming scene. [CS]

Hanging Moon // Hardcore // Nashville, TN

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We are writing music for a split that will be out this spring with a band that we can’t say yet.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

Earlier this month, we went on tour with The Language. We have started to book more things for after this but they’re all in the works, so we can’t say exactly what they are yet.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

I guess our goals for 2017 would be to just tour and play a lot of places we haven’t before and try to have progressed and be at a much better spot by the end of the year than we are now.

Her Eyes Glazed Over // Deathcore // Gary, IN // interview with Aaron Nelson, bassist

Hopefully to have a completely new merch line out with new tee shirts, goodies, stickers and of course a new CD to boot.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re still talking about doing a run with The Cambion in March but who knows, stuff always comes up with us [Laughs]. As far as festivals, we’ve got nothing booked as of yet, but that’d be tight!

We’re currently writing for a full-length to come at some point in 2017. Very excited with how this stuff is coming together.

We already have one tour planned that should be announced soon and are planning on setting more up. We’re on the pre-show for Midwest Blood Fest so we’re excited about that one.

Overall our goal for 2017 is to reach new people and keep grinding.

Lenore // Punk/Sludge // Northern Indiana // interview with Sven O’Donnell, drummer

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re just under two weeks from releasing our new EP, Cognitive Behavior. We were yet again able to work with Bone at Threshold Studios out of Indianapolis, Indiana on it. It came out sounding pretty swell.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re trying to tour this year, whether it’s self-booked or with an agent. We’ve been in talks with a couple people. I guess you’ll have to wait and see.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Goals for 2017 are to keep playing out and travel of course. Basically like every other band. Getting picked up would be nice, but nobody is holding their breath. We’re always writing and doing something regardless.

Anything else to add?

Our new EP Cognitive Behavior comes out the January 27, 2017. The release show is at Smiths in Mishawaka, Indiana. It’s 21+ if you were wondering. Big thanks to yourself for taking this sweet interview on. Also big thanks to everyone helping us out with this release. Oh, and I cannot stress this enough: we will not be providing sour cream at the release show. I don’t know why it’s such a big deal! [KA]

LOWCOUNTRY // Northwest Indiana // Metal/Hardcore // interview with Bryan Vargas, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re currently working on a full-length album with the intention of releasing it this year. However, we will definitely have a new single released in the near future.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

Given that we’re writing the new album, we don’t have many shows booked. However, we’re playing Exotic Animal Petting Zoo’s reunion show February 17 at Big Shots in Valparaiso, Indiana. A couple of us toured with them in the past. They’re really good dudes and even better musicians.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our main focus for 2017 is to grow as a band. Recording and releasing our first full-length album is our top priority. Releasing that first single as soon as possible is a step in that direction. Also, we hope to branch out to our surrounding regions such as central Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin.

Anything else to add?

We have both of our previous releases on Spotify, iTunes, YouTube—really anywhere you can stream or download music. Download it, stream it, share it, and follow us! Be on the lookout for new music and new merch as well! [KA]

Lume // Post-Grunge/Shoegaze // Chicago, IL // interview with Dylan Hulett, bassist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

The best way to talk about 2017 is to first discuss how we got here. The end of 2016 was rough for us, we lost three close friends while also having a bunch of personal life changes happen during the writing of these new songs. We will be heading to VuDu Studios in Long Island to team up with Mike Watts and bring the culmination of these experiences for our new record. We also just released a new Far Out session with Audiotree that features an unreleased song. Feel free to check that out if you get a chance.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have a west coast tour lined up in March. We plan on stopping in Austin, TX to do some SXSW showcases along the way. We have money and connections saved up for a Europe tour in the fall (depending on how and when this record gets released). We have also submitted for some festivals that are happening later in the year, which we’re waiting to hear back on. We have been bunkered down writing this record for the past few months, so we plan on getting out and touring as much as possible this year.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

We hope to take this music project to the next level. We’ve been working super hard around the clock on writing these songs, self-booking and managing this band. A huge goal of ours is to share the new music with as many people as possible. We do not plan on giving up anytime soon, so this is just one more step towards us being able to create art full-time.

Anything else to add?

Thank you for being interested in what we do. There are some other friends of ours working hard to reach the same goal. Everyone should look into them if they have the time: Atsuko Chiba, Big Jesus, No Sun, Miserable, Au Revoir, Slow Mass, and many others that I cannot think of right now. Take care of yourself and the others around you, because you never know what could happen. [CS]

Miracle Drug // Punk/Hardcore // Louisville, KY // interview with Matt Wieder, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We recently recorded six new songs with Will Allard from Xerxes at his studio, DotComplex. Look for an announcement soon about a release.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

It’s still pretty early in 2017, so we don’t have a lot of concrete information on upcoming shows, but we’re planning on playing doing a short east coast run and a whole bunch of regional shows. We played a This is Hardcore aftershow last year and I think the plan is to do that again and hopefully play the main festival as well.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

The overall goal for 2017 is to get these new songs out and play as much as we can. 2016 was an amazing year for us and we want to keep that momentum going.

Anything else to add?

Thank you for doing this interview and thanks to anyone and everyone that’s taken an interest in our band. We feel really lucky to be able to do this and we’re extremely grateful for every opportunity we have. [CS]

Monterrey // Post-Whatever // Northwest Indiana // interview with Erik Cruikshank, drummer

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We will be recording and EP in April at Southtown Studio with a great audio engineer and good friend Kyle Noonan. Our sophomore EP will be more realistic with bringing forward taboo subjects like mental health, suicide awareness and more struggles that we all deal with in our everyday lives as well. It will be an emotional experience that will hopefully resonate.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We will be going on an east coast tour in spring with a really awesome band from Alabama called West Means Home. In May, we’re planning on heading South. And as far as festivals go for this year, we will be playing MSMFest in Morristown, Indiana in June.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our goal for 2017 is just to tour and meet as many people as possible. We want to make an impact on as many people as we can. Even its it’s just one person that leaves that night after our set feeling that they aren’t alone, we will feel like we’ve done something right.

Anything else to add?

To anyone dealing with mental illness, anxiety or suicidal thoughts or attempts, just know you are not alone. Don’t hesitate to reach out for a helping hand or a listening ear. Something simple can make all the difference. Much love, Monterrey. [KA]

New Heart // Straight Edge Hardcore // Indianapolis, IN // interview with Matthew Green, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’ll have a new full-length record released this year. We’re a few tracks away from finishing the writing process. I’m very excited to share this new music. Easily the best, most lyrically potent music we’ve released.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re not yet allowed to share most details, but this will be a busy year for us. I can tell you that we’re playing Midwest Blood Fest in February, an east coast run in spring and a west coast run in summer.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Same as every year: share truth, play shows, make music and spend time with our friends and loved ones. [CS]

Nine Eyes // Hardcore/Metalcore // Louisville, KY

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’ve just released our third EP, Forever Isn’t Long Enough. It’s five tracks that we’re really proud of. We plan to enjoy playing it out and see what happens as far as our next release.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

The biggest part of our year is Midwest Blood Fest. We’re playing on Friday and looking forward to an insane time with our closest friends. With Isaac Hale playing in Knocked Loose, we have to play some things by ear, but we’re very excited for 2017.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our biggest goal for 2017 is complete, we released a record we are all very proud of. Moving forward, we’d love to play great shows with great bands and meet new people.

Anything else to add?

We’re super thankful for all the support we’ve received. We owe so much to our Midwest Blood family. 2017 sees the end of Expire, a band that has meant so much to us individually. We’ve very happy to get to see them again in our hometown on this last run. [CS]

No Dice // Pop Punk // Westerville, OH // interview with Travis Mollohan, vocalist/guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We are releasing a single in January and currently writing our sophomore EP. Not sure when the EP will be released, but hopefully sometime this year.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re trying to get out and stay out more consistently this year. Our first run is in early February with Heavy Things (InVogue Records’ new signee and great friends of ours). We have other tours in the works but nothing we can announce yet.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our goal for 2017 is to write the best record we can and try and gain some new fans and friends. We want to push as much new content as possible throughout the year and just stay as busy as we can.

Anything else to add?

Stay tuned for new music, and if we’re coming through your city this year come hang out! [CS]

No Victory // Hardcore // Gary, IN // interview with Patrick Goodson, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

Both bands [Bitter Thoughts & No Victory] are in the process of writing new material currently. No Victory has big plans for 2017 as well as Bitter Thoughts. We also have some new projects in the works. All I can say is the projects will be more intense than our past releases.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have some cool stuff coming up. On January 12, No Victory will be playing with Regulate (Long Island), Krust (NJ) and Kharma (Chicago) in Gary, Indiana at our most recent venue and my personal favorite, The D. In February, Stone (WI), Detain (MI) and Death Rate (MI) will also be playing the same venue along with No Victory, The Truth (IN) and Kharma. We’re also really excited for Midwest Blood Fest in Louisville, Kentucky. No Victory will also be doing a 10-day west coast leg of Expire’s final tour with Homewrecker and Bent Life, so I’m super excited for that.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

I hope to accomplish anything musically that all of us our satisfied with whether it be a split, demo, EP or full-length from any of my bands. 2017 will be the year of Northwest Indiana Hardcore and it’s already apparent.

Anything else to add?

I wanna give a shout out to any band that wants to travel to Northwest Indiana to play a show here. I also wanna give a shout out to the real Region Rats Emilio Rodriguez and my brother Derick Goodson for putting in a lot of hard work and doing so much for Indiana. Their hard work should never go unnoticed. Shout out to my brothers in SILVERHAMMER, LIFE AFTER DEATH, PENITENTIARY, STFU, COLD REIGN, KHARMA, BRUISE, INFERNO, MAL INTENT, BLACKWATER and everyone who comes out to Indiana Hardcore shows. Also, shout out to anyone who comes and takes pictures. A lot goes into that shit so try not to kick cameras out of people’s hands. [KA]

“2017 will be the year of Northwest Indiana Hardcore and it’s already apparent.” — Patrick Goodson, No Victory

Problem Of Pain // Hardcore // Michigan // interview with Jake Beaver, drummer/vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’ve been writing a new record that we are very proud of. We’re pushing the boundaries of our previous record and changing our sound a little bit. It is going to be something new for us and very refreshing for people to listen to. Expect a new sound and more progressive sound from us. Hopefully it will be out by the fall.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have a few tours in the works right now although we can’t say what they are yet because they are still being wrapped up and unannounced. We are going out with some really cool bands. Also planning to hit all of the US this year, which was a goal we wanted to accomplish last year but it didn’t happen. We don’t really know for sure a lot of festivals we will be hitting but most likely we will be playing AudioFeed, a very awesome festival in Illinois that we have been apart of in the past and are excited to keep being apart of.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

I would say our goal for 2017 is that we want to express ourselves in ways that are more in line with our own personal taste in things. Instead of doing what most bands do and follow the trends that come and go, we want to progress in our own way that separates us from most bands. We want to use music as an art form, but even more so than how we have been so far.

Anything else to add?

It’s early in the year and things are coming together, but keep your eyes on us because we will be making some cool announcements regarding the band, tours, and new music. We are very excited for what is to come. And I personally have been very excited for what we are going to become with our new album. Thanks for the interview! [CS]

“Instead of doing what most bands do and follow the trends that come and go, we want to progress in our own way that separates us from most bands.” — Jake Beaver, Problem of Pain

Rebuild & Rebound // Pop Punk // Northwest Indiana // interview with Christian Danner, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We released two music videos late last year and plan to shoot a final one very soon that we plan to put together as a 3-song concept EP named The Afterparty at the moment. Currently, we have about 7-9 songs that are almost written but not recorded that we are kind of sitting on at the second waiting for a more appropriate release.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We are embarking on a small tour on January 15 with our friends in Skylines, also from the Chicagoland area out to the east coast and back. As for other shows, we have some ideas and tours in mind but nothing serious at the moment.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

As generic as it sounds, we hope to really put in the work this year, hitting the road as much as possible, branching out our social media reach and overall fan interaction. The ultimate goal is to get the genuine attention and interest of a label and partner up to help us do what we already do, but just on a bigger scale. [KA]

Riot Shield // Punk ‘n’ Roll // Terre Haute, IN // interview with Jacob Osborn, drummer

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re planning on releasing a new EP later in the year. We have a few songs written already, but right now our main focus is playing more.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We just finished up booking a tour for February. We’re making a big circle from Indiana to Michigan, then Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, then back home again in Indiana. Really excited for all of those dates, especially the final show in Indianapolis. We’re also playing MSMFest this year.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal is to play a lot more and to new people. We want to make a lot more new friends and see places we haven’t seen.

Anything else to add?

Fuck Donald Trump. [CS]

Short Leash // Hardcore/Punk // Michigan // interview with Joe Plonkey, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

Nothing is majorly set in stone on when we are going to release new music, or necessarily how we are going to release it, but we should have new music sooner than later. We’re shooting for 4-6 songs. It’s all in the beginning stages and we want to make sure our next release shows our full potential. However, we have been writing and are extremely excited to show everyone! So it should be mid-year you’ll be hearing more from us!

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We have big plans for 2017 especially earlier on. We’re touring with some old friends and some new friends we have recently met. I can’t give exact details on locations next but so far we are looking at revisiting some Canadian spots as well as venturing into southern US. And of course, the MWB. As far as festivals, nothing has been confirmed but we love the festival environment and hope to visit some along the way of traveling!

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Our overall goal for 2017 is simply giving it our all. I’ve never been so happy with the line up we have currently, and our only intentions are to work out asses off and make some friends while seeing the world. That’s not only our goal for 2017, that is the goal for the entire existence of this band, we don’t take the relationships of people that go out of their way to support some dorks from Michigan lightly.

Anything else to add?

Just to keep supporting your hometown. It’s very hard to explain without sounding corny, but even simple feedback goes a long way. Don’t be afraid to branch out and invite someone that has never experienced a hardcore show before. It could change their world. [CS]

Don’t be afraid to branch out and invite someone that has never experienced a hardcore show before. It could change their world. — Joe Plonkey, Short Leash

Stoleaway // Melodic Hardcore/Metalcore // Crown Point, IN // interview with Mike Klein, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

2017 is an exciting year for Stoleaway as far as new music goes. We started our band in 2013 and have since released one demo and three EPs and are now planning to release our first full-length. It is definitely a challenge as we are releasing it ourselves but we are really happy to be putting out a longer release. The songs we are working on are the first batch that we have a full band contributing ideas for instead of just Mike writing the music and Steve doing the vocals. The songs are a blend of old and new influences and sounds, as we are trying to make music that we want to play and listen to, while setting ourselves aside from some of the other clichés that this genre is associated with.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We are going to play everywhere and anywhere we can. We are hoping to expand to new audiences and playing in front of anyone who is willing to give us their time and attention.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

In 2017, we hope to put out the best record we possibly can while playing as many shows as possible. We want to spread our music out to anyone who has never heard us before. While we have been putting music out for a few years, we are still a newer band and not many people have heard our music. We are really proud of our songs and we love playing shows, writing and recording music. Our overall goal is to keep doing what we love and sharing it with more people than before.

Anything else to add?

We want to add that for those who don’t know, Stoleaway began in 2013 just Steve and Mil writing and recording songs with our friend Andrew. We struggled to find band members until 2016 when Mike and Quade from R&R as well as our friend Jake Anderson were interested in playing with us. We are so happy to be playing shows and recording more music. We could’ve have done it without them or CJ Rayson, who has recorded all of our EPs. We are into a lot of different kinds of music so instead of just playing what is popular or trending in heavy music, we try to bring all of our influences to the table to make songs that we want to hear but no one is putting out at this time. Hardcore isn’t a sound or an image to us, but a way of doing things and we work really hard and are very passionate about our band. We love what we do and are so grateful for all the positive feedback and support we have been given thus far. [KA]

Stop.drop.rewind // Progressive/Powerpop // Valparaiso, IN // interview with Kris Lohn, vocalist/bassist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’re currently writing music for a full-length album we intend to release some time this year. There’s not much more I can say specifically about it since we’re still in the middle of the songwriting process, but what we have so far is very exciting. We’re pushing our musical boundaries a bit more than we have in the past, really trying to grow as players while simultaneously writing music that is meaningful, catchy, and fun to listen to. Check back in a few months when we’ve finished writing and I’ll be able to tell you much more about it.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

We’re always trying to spend as much time on the road as possible, but don’t have anything official on the books at this time. However, we just booked a show that we’re all personally very excited about. We’ve just confirmed that on March 5, we’ll be opening for Secondhand Serenade, Hawthorne Heights (acoustic), and The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus (acoustic) at Big Shots in Portage, Indiana. We’re a bunch of old emo guys, so you can imagine how much fun this is going to be for us.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?Specifically, we want to release a full-length in 2017 that represents each of us individually and showcases our unique musical voices, but remains cohesive and stays true to the sound that we’ve cultivated over the past however-many years. We’ll also be shoring up our live show, which comes with writing new music since we’ll have to find a place for it in our set. Mostly though, in 2017 we’ll be focusing on reaching the biggest audience possible, whether that means touring extensively or rebranding our social media presence or partnering with promoters and publicists to maximize our efforts, we’ll be doing whatever it takes to get our new music into as many ears as we can. [KA]

Street Sense // Pop Punk/Emo // Louisville, KY // interview with David Bowles, guitarist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

We’ve started to take a very different approach to songwriting. Our process is slowly becoming more meticulous and thorough, instead of playing the normal 4-chord intro/verse/chorus type thing. We’ve tried to expand on more off the wall ideas and work on blending and ambience while still maintaining that alt-rock sorta feel—it’s been interesting. We’ve also added a new vocalist, Kyle Goffinet, he’s really brought a lot more to the table then we bargained for in the way of expanding the spectrum of music we can write. Expect something very different, very organic, something every member of the band has put their two cents into.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

2017 is starting off slow for us, solely so we can finish up this EP we’ve been compiling. We have a show coming up with Brigades, Silver Lining, The Weekend Classic and a bunch of other sick bands on February 21, but as of right now that’s about it. We have to put our focus on rebuilding what we started. But I guarantee come summer/fall 2017 you’ll hear a lot more from us. I just can’t say anything too soon.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Like I said before, we have plans for the end of the year. A lot of things are being talked about. A lot of things have a really, really high probability of happening. A lot of things are up in the air. What I can say is the new stuff we’ll be releasing will be a different side of us, and it’ll be interesting to see where we end up by the end of it. My main goal is to find what works. As an unknown act, from a national standpoint, you know you’re going to face some trial and error. So who knows?

Anything else to add?

Pineapple doesn’t go on pizza. Have a good day. [CS]

Surrenderson // Emo // Illinois // interview with Justin Pankiewicz, guitarist/vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

The new music we’ve been working on has been sat on since the end of 2015, some of it a little newer though. Our new members have also changed around some original ideas and created their own new parts for the old tracks, molding them into what we hope to share with everybody very soon.

What upcoming tours or exciting shows do you have planned? Playing any festivals this year?

As of right now, there are no concrete details we can share unfortunately, but if you’re in the Midwest, you can probably be on the lookout for us in both March and the summer sometime.

What is your overall goal for 2017? What do you hope to accomplish this year?

Number one priority for 2017 is to rock and roll, and we want people to do the same. Also, we hope to get back on track as a full band as well as to start touring our way a little farther out west.

Anything else to add?

Be good people, do good things. [CS]

Through N Through // Hardcore // Chicago, IL // interview with Ruben Garza, vocalist

What details can you share about new music in 2017?

Our new EP, Give Me Hate is going to be released in the middle of February and a song will be released at the end of January. This EP is a lot heavier and darker than anything we have released so far. We listen to all styles of hardcore, punk and metal and feel we were influenced by the more heavier stuff this time and wrote our own style of hardcore.
