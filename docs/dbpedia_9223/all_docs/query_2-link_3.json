        "text": "They describe themselves as a two-piece lyrical acoustic band from Olympia, Washington. Just punks playing sad love songs.\n\nMonths of Indecision are a duo of Ely and Sox. They write and record warm acoustic tunes that I started liking at first listen. They are mysterious but I got this bio from their Facebook page:\n\nMonths of Indecision formed in Olympia, WA in 2011 as the brainchild of an old friendship. The duo has since brought their string-driven folk music to audiences across the United States, Europe and the Middle East. Combining elements of americana, country, and soul, Months of Indecision deliver a contemporary sound, yet maintain the candor and clarity of great folk musicians. While performing, Months of Indecision bare themselves with a rare and forthright innocence; it is a treat to be invited into the lives of these talented strangers.\n\nI think it is the cello, accordion and other acoustic instruments that got to me. The simplicity is something you need especially when you are recovering from an illness (like in my case and that is why I got time to write this entry). One of the songs that is becoming a favourite is Home Stuck because it reminds me of an Irish hymn.\n\nEverything about Months of Indecision is enjoyable. The female voice reminds me of k.d. lang. I just love what they do! Check out that amazing video from Balcony TV. You can tell they are amazing.\n\nListen to their 2015 album This is the Past and enjoy the music: http://monthsofindecision.hotglue.me/?music"
