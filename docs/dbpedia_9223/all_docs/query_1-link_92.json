        "text": "I’ve always associated the United Kingdom with punk rock more than hardcore. The Sex Pistols, The Clash, Discharge, The Subhumans, GBH – those are all punk bands from England, and great ones at that. However, over the past few years, I’ve noticed more and more English bands leaving their leather jackets in the closest and thrashing out hardcore riffs in the vein of YDI, SSD, and Victim in Pain era Agnostic Front. Nowadays, bands from across the Atlantic like The Flex, Violent Reaction, and Arms Race sound more like they’re from Boston, New York, or D.C. rather than the UK. I don’t know if this is a passing trend or an evolution of British punk, but either way this New Wave of British Hardcore will have you charged up and ready to run through a freakin’ wall after a few minutes. Recently, I had the privilege of talking to Nick Sarnella, vocalist of Arms Race, about this exact topic – The New Wave of British Hardcore and more.\n\nArms Race first 7″ Gotta Get Out is a basher. The instruments sound rough and they compliment the brute sound of your vocals perfectly. How would you describe the EP to someone who’s never heard it before?\n\nFirst of all, cheers. That’s nice of you to say. Fuck me, I don’t really know, someone described us as GBH with mosh parts once, I like that. Short and sweet.\n\nMy favorite part of Gotta Get Out are your lyrics. Where does the inspiration for your lyrics come from?\n\nAs for the record on the whole, it’s just life and it’s many ups and downs. Normal boring shit really, haha. I ain’t a poet and I don’t know it.\n\nThe song “Gotta Get Out” is my favorite on the EP. What is it that gotta get out from, and why do you say, “I’ll never get out” from it?\n\nMate, I wrote that song while I was stuck working this shitty retail job in a posh department store. The worst was the last 4 months there when I got stuck on the top floor of this building in the furniture department. The deadest department in the entire store. I was on minimum wage making no commission because it was impossible to meet quota. I’d be lucky if I got to interact with 3 people a day and when I did they’d be rich, ungrateful pieces of shit nine times out of ten. Situations like that can get you feeling pretty sorry for yourself but then you realise you’ve got a fucking job and you live in one of the richest and most developed countries in the world. Could be a lot worst. If you don’t laugh you cry.\n\nThe best part of that job was working alongside this older Indian lady who chewed Tobacco all day long and tried to steal my sales. She kept me on my toes and was always sweet to me.\n\nMost of us have had shit jobs like that before, I’ll probably have another again at some point, hopefully I won’t get stuck in one forever.\n\nEach band writes songs differently and draws inspiration from different places. Could you describe the writing process on Gotta Get Out?\n\nYeah, me and Ola and pat wrote the majority of the music for that as our drummer at the time was pretty busy in life. Ola would come in with a riff I’d hum what I thought the next part should be, then I’d get frustrated and wave my arms about. Pat would stay chill and if we were lucky at the end of it we would have a song.\n\nGotta Get Out was released in England by Quality Control HQ and in the United States by Painkiller Records. Was it difficult having two separate labels release the record?\n\nNah, CC and Cooch at PKR are wonderful, socially adept and bright sparkly personalities. Ola our guitarist does Qchq. Everyone is mates. It was all gravy.\n\nArms Race latest release on their bandcamp page is called New Nonsense 2015. Those four songs are just as awesome as any of the tracks on Gotta Get Out. Are their any plans to release them on a physical format?\n\nThose songs were actually released on a tape for our US tour in April as a teaser for a new LP coming later this year.\n\nOh, gotcha. Thanks for explaining that. Totally missed that part of the release. I see “nwobchc” all over your bandcamp page and you even have a song on New Nonsense 2015 entitled “nwobhc”. What does NWOBHC stand for and represent?\n\nNew Wave of British Hardcore. A good friend and elder statesmen in the Uk hardcore scene coined the term a few years back. It stuck. People get up in arms and misinterpret it as some kind of elitist thing. I dunno. It’s just what we call our mate’s bands.\n\nThing is 3-4 years ago, for me anyway, uk hardcore was a depressing thing. The late 2000s up until about 2012 were not a bright period for hardcore in this country. Don’t get me wrong there were exceptions, and props to all the good bands from that period. On the whole things have been much better the last 3 or so years. NWOBHC is a celebration of that. I don’t think our bands sound like others, I mean yeah we rip of the same riffs as everyone else but I like to think you can tell our shit apart, it’s British hardcore. It stinks different.\n\nThere’s a handful of hardcore bands (Violent Reaction, The Flex) making waves in the States right now including Arms Race. How does the London scene compare to the scene in the United States?\n\nVR is actually half from Leeds and The Flex are all from there. Hard to compare one city with the entirety of your vast country. Both have great bands. Hardcore is much bigger in the USA and your country boasts many more bands than our tiny little island. Both rock.\n\nI’ve been to London before, but I wasn’t able to get to a show while I was there. How would you describe a show in the United Kingdom?\n\nLondon shows have been a little stale for a while in my opinion. The city thrives when it comes to post punk, but as far as rough and tumble hardcore it ain’t really popping off. Leeds is where it’s at as far as that goes. Real tight knit, good pits, nice atmosphere. I like to think it’s pretty welcoming, others would argue differently. I love it.\n\nIn the United States, England is known more for punk rock and oi than hardcore. Even in Arms Race music, I can hear a more traditional punk and oi influence. How close is the hardcore scene in the UK to the punk and oi scenes?\n\nPunk and hardcore bands play together all the time in the uk, it ain’t a thing, but as far as oi goes It’s completely separate from the DIY hardcore scene. I can’t stress that enough. Myself and maybe three others are the only people actively involved in both scenes. That’s not hyperbole or an overstatement on my part, it’s just a different kettle of fish.\n\nThe hardcore scene in America is one that I would say is definitely growing. There’s a lot more festivals today than there ever have been, and more bands are touring than I can remember. How do you think the scene in England has changed in recent years?\n\nDefinitely more fests, way better bands, a lot more people at shows. I’m not a fan of fests per se. They serve a purpose, but I’d much rather a bunch of 3-4 band local shows on the regular. I see a lot of kids that only come out to fests. That sucks. Go to both. Also there’s been a disturbing trend on the harder side of the hardcore scene where fests are way too reliant on US bands. They pay them out the arse for one off shows and none of that money goes back into uk hardcore. Fuck that. Mosh to Shrapnel.\n\nDoes Arms Race have any tours/shows coming up?\n\nWere playing with Rixe from France in a few weeks and another sick show with the Flex, Obstruct and Insist in August. No plans to tour as such at the moment. Maybe a UK weekender with Violent Reaction in October.\n\nI’d love to see you guys live. Any chance Arms Race will make the journey across the pond to tour the United States?\n\nLike Arnie said “I’ll be back”\n\nWhat else does the future hold for Arms Race?\n\nLp late 2015/early 2016. Hopefully more shows too. There’s talk of some trips across Atlantic oceans for some one offs here and there but that’s all very hush hush and not confirmed yet so I don’t want to speak out of turn. We will see.\n\nIs there anything else you would like to add?\n\nThank you for taking the time to do this interview and thanks again for the kind words. Listen to uk hardcore, support uk hardcore. NWOBHC and Mongrel 4eva. You’re a gent for taking the time out of your day to listen to our band."
