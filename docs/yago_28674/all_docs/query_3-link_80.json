        "text": "To mark the release of STUDIOCANAL’s Vintage Classics’ 4k restorations of three comedies directed by Muriel Box available in the UK from 14 August, we have Blu-Ray box sets to give away to 2 lucky winners.\n\nSTUDIOCANAL are pleased to announce their Vintage Classics release of brand new 4k restorations of three comedies directed by Muriel Box, one of Britain’s earliest trailblazing female directors who remains to date the most prolific UK female director in history. Muriel Box’s THE PASSIONATE STRANGER, THE TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN and RATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN will be available in the UK on DVD and, for the first time in the UK, on Blu-ray and Digital from 14 August.\n\nTHE PASSIONATE STRANGER (1957) centres around happily married house-wife Judith Wynter (Margaret Leighton) who keeps the fact she is a best-selling author of steamy romance novels, a closely guarded secret. As her husband Roger (Ralph Richardson), recovers from a serious illness, the couple’s new driver Carlo (Carlo Justini) discovers the manuscript of Judith’s latest novel and jumps to a rather unfortunate conclusion, making life in the Wynter household very complicated indeed! Boldly experimental in form and an entertaining riposte to the romance novel, the BFI declares, ‘The Passionate Stranger surely has no serious rival as the most dazzlingly ambitious commercial British film of the 1950s in terms of form and, in its fluent manipulation of meta-fictional levels, now looks several decades ahead of its time.’\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN (1957), which Muriel called her most personal film, reveals the complex lives of women and the assertion that women can and should be ‘an equal partner in the business of life’. A witty and touching comedy with a great cast including Laurence Harvey, Julie Harris, Eva Gabor, Mai Zetterling and Diane Cilento, the film features striking cinematography from Otto Heller and sumptuous costume design by Cecil Beaton.\n\nRATTLE OF A SIMPLE MAN (1964) follows Percy Winthram (Harry H Corbett), a shy, naïve 39-year-old who is in London with his friends for the Cup Final. When he meets beautiful hostess Cyrenne (Diane Cilento) in a Soho strip club and accepts a bet, a night of lust seems to be on the cards, but back at her apartment Percy’s innocence and vulnerability become all too evident. A bittersweet study of two characters from very different walks of life, the film is imbued with endearing and heartwarming humour and some stark home truths.\n\nPlease note: This competition is open to UK residents only\n\na Rafflecopter giveaway\n\nThe Small Print\n\nOpen to UK residents only\n\nThe competition will close 28th August 2023 at 23.59 GMT\n\nThe winner will be picked at random from entries received\n\nNo cash alternative is available\n\nActual prize may vary from the image and description in exceptional circumstances\n\nTo coincide with GDPR regulations, competition entry information will not be stored once the competition has ended and the winners have been chosen and prizes sent out."
