And Harvey's performance as the upstart Lothario from the other side of the tracks in it was the standard bearer for all the working class rebels with a cause played by Alan Bates, Albert Finney, Tom Courtney, and Richard Harris who followed in Harvey's footsteps.\n\nHarvey repeated the role of Joe Lampton in an equally frank sequel, Life at the Top. The film was less successful than its forbear, however, because it covered no new ground; it just confirmed the details of the empty life in store for Harvey's character at the end of the first film.\n\nLife at the Top was released in 1965, by which time Harvey was already a fixture of many high-profile films made on both sides of the Atlantic such as Butterfield 8, Summer and Smoke (from a Tennessee Williams play), Walk On the Wild Side, The Outrage (Kurosawa's Rashomon remade as a western), and Darling, director John Schlesinger and writer Frederic Raphael's acid portrait of the London scene in the \"swinging Sixties.\" In each, Harvey played variations on his destructive but appealing heel persona—a persona that made him an unsuitable choice, however, for Of Human Bondage. Harvey was clearly miscast in the part of Somerset Maugham's vulnerable hero Philip Carey, just as he had been early on in his career (and for the same reasons) as Romeo in Castellani's Romeo and Juliet (1954). On the flip side, Harvey's upper class air of almost posturing snobbishness made him an ideal Colonel William Travis, the effete defender of American freedom he played in John Wayne's interminable epic The Alamo, a film where most of the fun (aside from the spectacular final battle) derived from watching Harvey and co-star Richard Widmark go head to head chewing the scenery.\n\nHarvey had his two best roles (apart from Room At the Top) and gave his two best performances in Val Guest's underrated satire Expresso Bongo, where he played a hilariously smarmy music promoter who maneuvers singer Cliff Richards into the big leagues, and John Frankenheimer's classic The Manchurian Candidate. It is the latter film for which Harvey is today best remembered. He is perfectly cast as the cold fish Raymond Shaw, a Korean War POW brainwashed by the communist Chinese into being a remote-controlled assassin. In many ways, Shaw is the definitive Harvey hero—a character we never actually like but whom we do come to feel for. Ironically, Harvey almost didn't get the part. Producer-star Frank Sinatra's first choice for Shaw was Tony Curtis, but director Frankenheimer insisted on Harvey and fortunately got his way.\n\nShortly before his premature death of cancer, Harvey may have had another good part as a killer, in this case a psychopathic one, in Dead Reckoning (The Deep), a thriller based on Charles William's 1965 novel Dead Calm filmed by Orson Welles in the early 1970s as Harvey's star power was waning. Regrettably, we'll probably never know as the film is reportedly locked up in a vault somewhere, its ownership and its rights tied up in litigation like so many other of Welles's works that remained either unfinished or unreleased at the time of Welles's death in 1985.\n\n—John McCarty"
