        "text": "The young man appeared in Physique Pictorial magazine. He also began to earn money as an extra in movies. In 1961, he was seen a young man attending a dance in The Comancheros. Married in 1960 and father to a boy the following year, it was time to make it for real.\n\nCole swung from Squad right into a new prime-time series called Bracken's World, all about the inner turmoils of a fictional Hollywood studio. Seen with him here is Linda Harrison (known best as Nova from Planet of the Apes, 1968.) Note the way her dress echoes the pattern of the tree bark next to her!\n\nHandsome Cole played not an actor on the show, but a stuntman. The series underwent creative tweaks (and the departure of its star Eleanor Parker) causing its cancellation after a season and a half. It remains, however, a sought-after collectors' item due to the people involved in it and the fashionable era in which it was made.\n\nIn it, he played a composer living with a buddy named Angel. When neighbors hear him referring to his roommate as \"Angel\" they mistake the pair for homosexuals. This causes a stir in the apartment complex, but also leads to Cole seducing several nearby wives! His bare chest looming over some snug trousers couldn't help the piece play beyond a handful of performances.\n\nCole appeared as a guest on many 1980s series such as Fantasy Island, The Fall Guy, Trapper John, M.D., The A-Team and Simon & Simon. He also took starring parts in straight-to-video action flicks which did nothing to raise his position in Tinseltown. But he was soon to be dealt an even more horrible blow from which there was little chance of fully recovering.\n\nIn 1991, Cole's only son Joe, who was a sometime actor and a roadie with the band Hole, was living with his close pal Henry Rollins. One night, the two were held up and as Rollins attempted an escape, Joe Cole was fatally shot at close range in the face. It was a crushing experience for Rollins, but a near-crippling one for Cole.\n\nHe landed the James Garner role in the national tour of Victor/Victoria, which starred Toni Tennille, but received little to no promotion or publicity for it. In an unfortunate turn of events, he sustained an injury during the tour which took years from which to recover and called for several surgeries. I was in the second row of this show when it came to Cincinnati and it was interesting to see him (and her), but he had by then receded from the screen and his acting career was nearing its halt.\n\nHe married for a third time in 2004 and was working in Florida real estate, generally outside the world of show business, but unfortunately had slid into a period of heavy drinking. A DUI arrest in 2007 put his name in the headlines for a brief while again and this last marriage dissolved in 2008. In 2009, Mr. Cole died of liver failure at only age 69.\n\nThe fresh-faced youth who'd made a splash in L.A. had faded from the limelight. But he remains an object of interest for many lovers of classic TV. Part of the reason is his early physique pictorials, but there was also a memorable 1977 spread in the magazine Ultra.\n\n...but a little dark tint over the pic makes things even more obvious. I recently saw Mr. Cole in a season two episode of Medical Center and he was just plain striking to behold... all golden skin, pale hair and while teeth. Time (and gravity) are rarely kind to hunks of that type, and he surely dealt with some significant disappointments and tragedy along the way. Hopefully he also knew of the pleasure he provided to many fans as well.\n\nAs the film begins, we meet (left to right) Laurence Harvey, Richard Basehart, Stanley Baker and John Ireland. Parked in a car on a damp evening, they are about to embark on some sort of criminal activity. Before they do, we step back in time to examine what brought them to this point.\n\nHis boss, far more invested in the ticker-tape than in Basehart, refuses to allow his recently returned employee some time off he has requested. It seems Basehart is fretful about his wife, who is over in England seeing to her sick mother; a story he's beginning to doubt after her stay has been extended a couple of times.\n\nNot only is she not cheating on him - as he had fretted - but she's carrying his child. This would be good news but for the fact that he has now quit his job!\n\nNext we take a look at boxer Baker, who's about to take part in a match that could spell not only some decent money, but an opportunity for even bigger bouts in the future.\n\nMost of his associates hold out little hope of him winning, even though their own position would improve if he did. Note the \"No Smoking\" sign, which doesn't seem to be affecting anyone in the room...!\n\nBaker's wife Rene Ray wants him to stop fighting altogether. She can't even bring herself to watch her husband in the ring. She dreams of a house and children and a far more normal existence for the two of them.\n\nThe fight is really vigorously shot, with intense close-ups of Baker and his opponent and some eye-catching camerawork and action, especially considering the time (and budget!) In real life, the hirsute Baker was compelled to wax his chest for these scenes.\n\nHarvey (who is usually a polarizing force for moviegoers - they either love him or hate him) affects a highly fey, posh demeanor, sporting a variety of pithy, carefree comments as he tries to milk 1,000 pounds out of his nearly exasperated spouse. We're expected to believe (and maybe it was so... how am I to know?!) that Harvey is such a staggering lover in bed that Leighton finally gives in one last time and agrees to hand him the money.\n\nBaker, who's still recovering from his latest fight, vows to find work. Since a promising job is opening up right away, he puts off seeing to his injured hand until the day after so that he won't miss out on the opportunity for employment.\n\nWith any work now hard to come by, Baker does what all too many such men have felt the need to do, which is pass his time in a pub. Here, he meets Basehart, who's been grappling with his own troubles.\n\nHarvey is able to offer up a contact name for use in starting up a business for Baker with the prize money he took home. Baker is relieved to know that he has enough to launch a tobacco shop with an apartment upstairs for him and his wife Ray.\n\nThings just aren't great for any of them, though. Collins' mother is so horrible that it's beginning to affect her own health and well-being! Basehart needs to get them back to the U.S. and away from the gorgon, but he's run through all the money he had.\n\nEven worse for Baker, his elation over seeing a way towards a future for him and his wife swiftly erodes when he finds out that the money he had saved is all gone!\n\nHarvey has finally hornswaggled Leighton into covering his 1,000 debt. But... in return, she wants him to come with her to Kenya! He is highly reluctant to commit to this and turn away from his freewheeling London lifestyle for life on a coffee plantation.\n\nSo he has hatched a plot. One of his squeezes works at a post office and has alerted him to a shipment of funds in the amount of 90,000 pounds! He talks his three pals into planning a heist which will solve all their money woes.\n\nIt's a misty, dreary night which promises to get drearier for some. Remember, the title is The Good Die Young, so it stands to reason that not everyone is going to emerge with a happy ending. But I won't go any further into the story line than this.\n\nThis was the first time Patterson was credited on a movie screen for his acting work. The Canadian performer had only been in the business one year at this stage. He waffled between movie parts and British television until moving to Hollywood in 1960. There, he became one of the stars of Surfside 6. Many roles on prime-time and daytime TV (he was key character Joe Reilly on One Life to Live) followed until his retirement in 1996. The never-married Patterson died in 2007 of lung & heart ailments at age 77.\n\nJust the year before she had starred in Roadhouse Girl opposite Maxwell Reed, who was Joan Collins' husband from 1952-1956. As the 1970s dawned, Dorne worked less and less until 1987, passing away in 1992 at age 68. I mention these two performers first because they were not granted the same type of on-screen credit as the remainder of the principle cast received. The closing credits feature my favorite type of cast depiction!\n\nMs. Jackson was a prolific and notable stage actress who worked in the occasional movie. She was once described as being \"too ferocious\" for supporting roles. She had a memorable stage role as a ruthless boarding house matron which she repeated in Britain's first film to achieve an \"X\" rating (not XXX!) Twilight Women (1952) also featured Harvey and Ray as young lovers. After playing a witch in Clash of the Titans (1981), she retired, passing away in 1990 at age 82.\n\nThe portly Morley was a highly familiar face to moviegoers in everything from Marie Antoinette (1938) to The African Queen (1951) to Topkapi (1964) and many others. His wife of more than 50 years was the daughter of Gladys Cooper. Working until 1989, he passed of a stroke in 1992 at age 84.\n\nThe captivating Leighton possessed a fascinating face with a riveting gaze. She worked for Alfred Hitchcock in Under Capricorn (1949) and proceeded to a variety of movie roles. She also won two Tonys for her excellent work on the Broadway stage. In 1957, she married her costar here, Laurence Harvey, though the union was over by 1961. A few years later, she wed Michael Wilding, to whom she was married at the time of her premature death from multiple sclerosis in 1976. She was 53.\n\nEvery time I see Welsh actor Baker I'm more impressed than the last time and this is no exception. Not only do I find his severely angled features attractive, but the variety and passion he injected into his parts comes through beautifully. Having played tough and/or working class characters from the 1940s on, he proceeded to supporting parts in big-scale epics like Helen of Troy (1956) and The Guns of Navarone (1961.) His hands down triumph came with 1964's Zulu. Cut down by lung cancer at age 48 in 1976, he died before his knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II could be bestowed and also received a posthumous Emmy nomination for his work in the miniseries How Green Was My Valley. (Christopher Plummer won for The Moneychangers.)\n\nI had never encountered Ray before this. The very pretty young lady distinguished herself on stage and was an accomplished singer as well. She also starred in the aforementioned Twilight Women (1952.) She segued out of screen acting in the mid-'50s and turned more to writing and painting as creative outlets. In 1975, she married her longtime love, the 2nd Earl of Midleton, thus becoming a Countess. She died in 1993 at the age of 81.\n\nThis film was aimed at an international audience, thus American stars were blended in with the British ones and that's how Ireland became part of it. After a start on the Broadway stage, he became a busy supporting actor in films with an Oscar nomination coming for All the Kings Men (1949), which went to Dean Jagger in Twelve O' Clock High. Always busy, he balanced supporting parts in films like Red River (1948) and Spartacus (1960) with leads in B films. Leukemia claimed him in 1992 at age 78.\n\nOnly 20 at the time of filming, this was already Collins' tenth movie. Her next project was the immense international project Land of the Pharaohs (1955) which led to a contract at 20th Century Fox and a raft of colorful, if ultimately disappointing, movies. Ever a master at reinvention (all the while maintaining that distinctive air of elegant glamour), she took the world by storm on Dynasty in 1981, becoming a household name in the process. In what has become an all-too-common occurrence by now, she is the sole principle cast member of The Good Die Young remaining alive today.\n\nOhio-born Basehart spent many years performing in movies such as Fourteen Hours (1951), Titanic (1953), Moby Dick (1956) and Portrait in Black (1960), but, like his on-screen wife Collins, his biggest legacy probably stems from a TV role. In 1964 he took the lead role on Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea, which ran for four years and was rerun many times thereafter. One of his lesser known credits was as the narrator on Knight Rider! Busy up until his death in 1984 of multiple strokes, he was 70.\n\nGrahame was an inimitable screen persona with her pouty upper lip and highly distinctive voice. She found herself at home in a wide variety of projects, though her wheelhouse tended to be sultry dames who may or may not spell good news for her mates. Oscar-nominated for Crossfire (1957), losing to Celeste Holm in Gentleman's Agreement, and winning for her brief turn in The Bad and the Beautiful (1952), she also made quite a mark in Oklahoma! (1955), though her career began to slip some afterwards. TV roles and low-budget films dotted her later career. Plagued by a couple of breast cancer diagnoses, she eventually relocated to England where she died in 1981 at age 57.\n\nHarvey was of Lithuanian descent, but came to the U.K. buy way of South Africa where he'd been raised. Quickly establishing himself in the British cinema of the late-1940s, he'd already worked with this film's director Lewis Gilbert twice: Scarlet Thread and There is Another Sun (both 1951.) If you tend to like him, this is one of his most vivid roles. If you don't, you can't wait for him to slink off the screen. He's photographed to decent advantage throughout nonetheless. Though he remained busy and in demand, he met an early demise like a few other folks in this movie. Stomach cancer claimed him in 1973 at only age 45."
