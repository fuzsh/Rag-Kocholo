        "text": "Studiocanal has announced the Vintage Classics release of brand new 4K restorations of three comedies directed by Muriel Box, one of Britain's earliest trailblazing female directors who remains to date the most prolific UK female director in history. Muriel Box's The Passionate Stranger, TheTruth About Women and Rattle of a Simple Man will be available in the UK on DVD and, for the first time in the UK, on Blu-ray and Digital from 29 May 2023. This release coincides with the BFI's first ever Muriel Box: A Woman's Take season, opening at BFI Southbank on 2 May.\n\nMuriel BoxÂ was born in 1905 in Surrey and started reading scripts for British Instructional Pictures at Welwyn Garden City, before moving to BIP at Elstree into the Continuity department. She met and married Sydney Box, and introducing him to the film industry, they formed a documentary production company, Verity Films, that produced propaganda films during the War. In 1945 Muriel and Sydney wroteÂ The Seventh Veil,Â which appears at no 10 in the BFI's list of the biggest UK cinema hits of all time based on audience figures (more people saw it at the cinema thanÂ Harry Potter).Â The film won them the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay â Muriel becoming the first ever woman to win the award.Â\n\nEventually they both ended up at Gainsborough Studios, with Muriel heading up the script department, and then Rank. In 1950 she finally directed her first feature,Â The Happy FamilyÂ (1952),Â although at the time they had to pretend that Sydney was co-directing, to keep the distributors happy.Â After her directing career ended in 1964,Â she left the film industry to co-found Britain's first feminist publishing house, Femina, and later became a campaigner for women's rights, working with her friend, Edith Summerskill, the Labour politician, to reform Britain's divorce laws. Muriel died in 1991.\n\nWithÂ 12 features to her name, made during the 1950s and 1960s, Muriel Box was a pioneering filmmaker who explored the role of women in society through her films.Â Asserting her talent in an industry difficult for women to break in to, Muriel Box made a major contribution to cinema.\n\nTHE PASSIONATE STRANGERÂ (1957)\n\nThis film centres around happily married house-wife Judith Wynter (Margaret Leighton), who keeps the fact she is a best-selling author of steamy romance novels a closely guarded secret.Â As her husband, Roger (Ralph Richardson), recovers from a serious illness, the couple's new driver Carlo (Carlo Justini) discovers the manuscript of Judith's latest novel and jumps to a rather unfortunate conclusion, making life in the Wynter household very complicated indeed!Â\n\nBoldly experimental in form and an entertaining riposte to the romance novel, the BFI declares, 'The Passionate StrangerÂ surely has no serious rival as the most dazzlingly ambitious commercial British film of the 1950s in terms of form and, in its fluent manipulation of meta-fictional levels, now looks several decades ahead of itsÂ time.'\n\nBLU-RAY AND DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nNewÂ An Out and Out Feminist: Muriel Box and The Passionate Stranger, featuring interviews with Film Historian Dr. Josephine Botting, author ofÂ Her Brilliant Career: Ten Extraordinary Women of the FiftiesÂ Rachel Cooke, film director Carol Morley\n\nThe Woman Behind the Picture: Archive interview with Muriel Box Part 1Â\n\nBehind the Scenes Stills Gallery\n\nOriginal TrailerÂ\n\nTHE TRUTH ABOUT WOMEN (1957)\n\nRegarded by Muriel as her most personal film, The Truth About Women reveals the complex lives of women and the assertion that women can and should be 'an equal partner in the business of life'.Â A witty and touching comedy with a great cast including Laurence Harvey, Julie Harris, Eva Gabor, Mai Zetterling and Diane Cilento, the film features striking cinematography from Otto Heller and sumptuous costume design by Cecil Beaton.\n\nBLU-RAY AND DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:\n\nNewÂ An Equal Partner in the Business of Life: Muriel Box & The Truth About Women, featuring interviews with Film Historian Dr. Josephine Botting, author ofÂ Her Brilliant Career: Ten Extraordinary Women of the FiftiesÂ Rachel Cooke, film director Carol Morley\n\nThe Woman Behind the Picture: Archive interview with Muriel Box Part 2\n\nBehind the Scenes Stills Gallery\n\nOriginal Trailer\n\nRATTLE OF A SIMPLE MANÂ (1964)\n\nfollows Percy Winthram (Harry H Corbett), a shy, naÃ¯ve 39-year-old who is in London with his friends for the Cup Final.Â When he meets beautiful hostess Cyrenne (Diane Cilento) in a Soho strip club and accepts a bet, a night of lust seems to be on the cards, but back at her apartment Percy's innocence and vulnerability become all too evident.Â A bittersweet study of two characters from very different walks of life, the film is imbued with endearing and heartwarming humour and some stark home truths.Â\n\nBLU-RAY AND DVD SPECIAL FEATURES:"
