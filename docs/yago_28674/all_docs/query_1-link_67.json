        "text": "The Good Die Young (1954) DVD B&W 93 min. (Playable in North America - The US, Canada, Mexico, etc.)\n\nStarring: Joan Collins, John Ireland, Stanley Baker, Robert Morley, Laurence Harvey, Richard Basehart, Freda Jackson, Gloria Grahame, Margaret Leighton, Rene Ray Written by Vernon Harris and Lewis Gilbert, Based on ”The Good Die Young” (novel) by Richard Macauley Produced by John Woolf and Jack Clayton Directed by Lewis Gilbert\n\nPowerful British film noir in which an amoral, psychotic playboy incites three men who are down on their luck to commit a mail van robbery, which goes badly wrong.\n\nThe film opens with four men in a car, apparently about to commit a serious crime. How each of the previously law-abiding men came to be in this position is then explored.\n\nMike (Stanley Baker) is an ageing boxer, in love with his wife (Rene Ray) but injured and unable to find a job. Joe (Richard Basehart) is an out-of-work clerk who needs to fly to the United States with his young wife (Joan Collins) to escape her clinging and unstable mother (Freda Jackson). Eddie (John Ireland) is an AWOL American airman with an unfaithful actress wife (Gloria Grahame). The last man, 'Rave' Ravenscourt (Laurence Harvey), is a 'gentleman' sponger and a scoundrel with gambling debts and the unscrupulous leader who lures the other three.\n\nThe film reaches a bloody climax at Heathrow Airport!"
