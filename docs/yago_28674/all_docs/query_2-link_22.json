        "text": "The popular screen and stage star Laurence Harvey (1928-1973) is best remembered for his stellar performance in the film The Manchurian Candidate—a 20th century classic. Of his 50 films, Room At the Top not only brought sexual permissiveness to American and British screens and an Oscar nomination, but it also branded him a heartthrob sensation.\n\nFor all his fame and fortune, Harvey's short life was riddled with controversy, demonized by critics, and fraught with tragedy. In this revealing biography by Harvey's sister-in-law, readers are provided a close-up view of his career, his three marriages and his longtime sexual affair with one of his male producers. It also details his battle with cancer and his failure to acknowledge its seriousness.\n\nPacked with personal anecdotes, more than twenty black and white photographs, and a filmography, Reach for the Top: The Turbulent Life of Laurence Harvey will fascinate film students, scholars, and fans of the actor.\n\nChapter 1 Acknowledgments\n\nChapter 2 1 A Lithuanian Childhood\n\nChapter 3 2 Growing Up White in South Africa\n\nChapter 4 3 The Youngest South African Soldier\n\nChapter 5 4 The Scorned Alien Learns His Craft in England\n\nChapter 6 5 Becoming Laurence Harvey: The First Films\n\nChapter 7 6 A Biting Tongue, Adoring Fans, and Trips to Paris\n\nChapter 8 7 Averting a Potential Scandal\n\nChapter 9 8 Enter Hermione Baddeley, \"A Rather Splendid Old Girl\"\n\nChapter 10 9 Enter James Woolf, and Fame, Fortune, and Friendship\n\nChapter 11 10 Shakespeare and Margaret Leighton\n\nChapter 12 11 Romeo and Juliet\n\nChapter 13 12 Coming Home to Mother—Briefly\n\nChapter 14 13 Marriage, but Not Togtherness\n\nChapter 15 14 Room at the Top Brings International Stardom\n\nChapter 16 15 The Alamo and Butterfield 8\n\nChapter 17 16 Scandal and Divorce\n\nChapter 18 17 The Manchurian Candidate\n\nChapter 19 18 \"The Hottest Star in Town\"\n\nChapter 20 19 The Death of James Woolf—Enter Paulene Stone\n\nChapter 21 20 Marriage to Joan\n\nChapter 22 21 Promises to Paulene, Married to Joan\n\nChapter 23 22 Aftermath\n\nChapter 24 Laurence Harvey's Films\n\nChapter 25 Bibliography\n\nChapter 26 Index\n\nChapter 27 About the Author"
