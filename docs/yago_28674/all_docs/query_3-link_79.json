        "text": "‘This is Part 3 in a series. See also Part 1 and Part 2.\n\n💥SPOILERS!\n\n*The Star Juror Betty Field s1e24 aired March 15, 1963\n\nBetty Field bio:\n\nBetty Field and John Wayne in Shepard of the Hills 1941.\n\nBetty’s fascination with the theatre was ignited in her early teenage years and led her to enroll at the American Academy of Dramatic Art by 1932. She marked her professional debut in 1933, performing in a summer stock production of “The First Mrs. Fraser,” and went on to secure stage roles in various locations. Her passion for theatre took her all the way to London, where she landed a job in a theatre production of “She Loves Me” at the beginning of 1934.\n\nHer Broadway premiere, in November 1934, was as an understudy for the comedy “Page Miss Glory,” directed by George Abbott, in which she also played a minor role. Despite her rather unassuming appearance and distinct, monotone voice, Betty began to regularly perform in comedic plays, often under Abbott’s direction. She received high acclaim for her roles in plays such as “Three Men on a Horse” (1935), “Boy Meets Girl” (1936), “Room Service” (1937), and “The Primrose Path” (1939).\n\nParamount executives were impressed with Betty’s portrayal of Barbara, Henry Aldrich’s girlfriend, in the stage production of “What a Life” (1938), and they subsequently signed her to a seven-year contract after the play was adapted into a film in 1939. Throughout the 1940s, Betty played a variety of leading ingénue and supporting roles. One of her early career highlights was her performance as Mae, a farm girl, in the film adaptation of John Steinbeck’s classic novel “Of Mice and Men” (1939), which starred Burgess Meredith and Lon Chaney. However, despite her talent, Betty didn’t quite achieve stardom, partly due to her reserved demeanor and tendency to avoid the Hollywood scene.\n\nBetty had the privilege of acting alongside some of Hollywood’s most esteemed leading men, such as Fredric March in “Victory” (1940) and “Tomorrow, the World!” (1944), John Wayne in “The Shepherd of the Hills” (1941), Robert Cummings in “Flesh and Fantasy” (1943), and Joel McCrea in “The Great Moment” (1944).” However, her most remarkable performance was in the heart-wrenching role of the tormented daughter mistreated by her father, played by Claude Rains, in the classic drama “Kings Row” (1942).\n\nFlesh and Fantasy was an eerie and whimsical part for her, she stars in one of the vignettes as Henrietta a dowdy woman who comes upon a mysterious mask during Mardis Gras and then goes to a party festooned with regalia, turbulence, and a romantic game of cat-and-mouse with the handsome Michael (Robert Cummings) A beautifully tragic tale of loneliness and the essence of what beauty is. The use of masks creates a nightmarish landscape of human disconnection.\n\nFrom The Vault: Flesh & Fantasy (1943)\n\nAfter delivering a powerful performance as Nona Tucker in the extraordinary depiction of Americana hardship lensed by impressionist director Jean Renoir (one of my favorite auteurs) – “The Southerner” (1945), Betty made the decision not to renew her contract with Paramount.\n\nZachary Scott and Betty Field in The Southerner 1945.\n\nInstead, she took a hiatus from appearing in pictures and returned to her first love – the stage and Broadway. There, she appeared in distinguished plays like “The Voice of the Turtle” and “Dream Girl,” which was directed by her husband John Abbott, and won the New York Drama Critics Circle award in 1946. Her portrayal of Hedvig in Ibsen’s “The Wild Duck” also received critical acclaim.\n\nBetty came back to work at Paramount cast as Daisy Buchanan in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s The Great Gatsby co-starring Alan Ladd. It wound up being a misadventure for the actress when the picture flopped with some critics claiming she was miscast and not glamorous enough and Ladd too was accused of being lackluster. However, Betty remained beloved on Broadway, showing off her versatility in plays such as Twelfth Night, The Rat Race, Ladies of the Corridor, and The Fourposter playing opposite Burgess Meredith, both taking over for Jessica Tandy and husband Hume Cronyn.\n\nBetty’s expressive features had become tougher, more weathered, and bleak by the time she greeted Hollywood hello again in the mid-1950s. Still, she thrived as a character actress, portraying a number of mundane, wearisome, and unstylish roles yet with the same Betty Field authenticity. She brought credibility to a range of flawed provincial mothers and wives in films such as the highly-regarded Picnic (1955) with Kim Novak, Bus Stop starring Marilyn Monroe, and Lana Turner in the melodrama soaper Peyton Place 1957.\n\nEven her stage roles reflected the changing face of her acting parts with productions of The Seagull, Waltz of the Toreadors, Touch of the Poet, and Separate Tables. And in the 1950s and 1960s, she began to work steadily in television.\n\nDuring the 1950s and 1960s, Betty also worked steadily on television, taking on a variety of prominent roles. She continued to act at a consistent pace, although she preferred to avoid the limelight.\n\nBetty’s final film appearance was a small but notable role as a streetwalker in Clint Eastwood’s Coogan’s Bluff (1968). Continuing to work on stage she was fearless as the imperishable Amanda in Eugene O’Neil’s The Glass Menagerie and the fragile Aunt Birdie in The Little Foxes, and in 1971 she turned in her last performance on stage as the mother Beatrice in The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man in the Moon Marigolds, a part that in 1972, Joanne Woodward tackled in Alvin Sargent’s film adaption.\n\nBetty passed away at age 57 from a fatal cerebral hemorrhage in 1973, just before filming was set to begin for The Day of the Locust (1975), in which she had been cast as the flamboyant evangelist ‘Big Sister.’ The role was later taken over by Geraldine Page. Betty Field is an often criminally overlooked Hollywood actress who truly contributed some of the finest performances on stage, film, and television.\n\nDIALOGUE\n\n“You act like you’d like to see me electrocuted.”- George\n\n“A couple of shock treatments wouldn’t do you no harm.”– Betty Field\n\nSlamming the fridge door and shuffling her feet. Jenny confronts George’s peculiar behavior on the jury.\n\nJenny – “Would the star juror care to give me some justification for his behavior George- “What behavior? What behavior! The behavior that has brought down ridicule and scandal over our heads!”\n\nGeorge-“What you talkin’ bout Jenny?”\n\nJenny- “Have you gone deaf and blind?… Unplug your ears… open your eyes! George Davies the most respected highly thought-of citizen in this town protecting this infidel, this murderer… No wonder you get indigestion.”\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nIn this darkly humorous episode, Dean Jagger stars as George a mild-mannered Pharmacist who is overcome with murderous lust one afternoon after putting the moves on Lola the town squeeze. When she spurns his advances he chokes her to death to keep her quiet.\n\nBetty Field is shrill and unnerving, playing his fish wife, who annoys all of us with her whining, shrewish voice, her needling and berating George in a way that gets under the skin. Though I can see the tendency to want to needle and berate George.\n\nLola’s hot-tempered boyfriend J.J. is later arrested for the crime and put on trial. Knowing the boy is innocent, and not able to prove it without his confessing his own guilt, George sees a way out of his dilemma when he is appointed to the jury.\n\nThrough his efforts, J.J. is found innocent after he poses so many doubts to the rest of the jurors that he goes free.\n\nThe townsfolk boycott George’s store for helping the kid go free. And they treat him like an outcast. His wife treats him like he’s disgraced the family, saying that he’s embarrassing her and that her mother was right all along, there was insanity in his family.\n\nBut the townsfolk still believe he did it and persecute him and his mother. This irritates the vengeful townspeople so much that they force him to want to commit suicide and he gets shot by George when he struggles to get the gun away from him. He can’t do anything right.\n\nGeorge can’t deal with his guilty conscience and being hounded by the town and finally cracks up trying to convince them he murdered Lola and shot J.J.\n\nBut they just dismiss him as a meek, passionless man not capable of murder and just in need of rest. Having suffered a nervous breakdown from the pressures of the trial…\n\nIt begins… the story takes place somewhere in the South. It opens with the mild-mannered storekeeper George Davies and his wife Jenny dozing off on their picnic blanket near the rest of the townsfolk who are spending a lazy day.\n\nGeorge wanders off leaving Jenny sleeping under newspapers used as a blanket. He stumbles onto the town’s young stunner Lola Penderwaller,(Cathy Merchant plays Lola and had a brief screen career from 1961 to 1965 that included roles in four episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and a part in Roger Corman’s The Haunted Palace 1963) who is a spirited flirt boasting her beautiful body in a scant swimsuit. Director Herschel Daugherty subtly emphasizes the contrast between Lola and his dowdy wife Jenny who is back on the blanket, snoring like a truck exhaust and oblivious. Lola teases George, leading him on only to a certain, harmless point, offering him a beer. When George gets sexually aroused, he tries to grab a kiss, and Lola rebuffs his advances. The normally gutless George violently slaps her and proceeds to choke the life out of her.\n\nIn a tense moment, Will Hutchins who plays Lola’s boyfriend, the uncultivated and untamed J.J. Fenton floats by in his rowboat, the cowardly George camouflages himself behind a bush then sneaks back to the picnic blanket, taking his place next to the clueless Jenny.\n\n“George here’s that nice fat neck you were eyeing before church… you want it now?”\n\nRegular television character actor Crahan Denton seen on several of Boris Karloff’s anthology series Thriller plays Sheriff Walter Watson who comes to the picnic with his sons to fish at the lake. He greets George and Jenny who offers them her fried chicken and ironically wisecracks that George loves the necks. It’s an inside joke that George finds secretly comical, but it shows on his face.\n\nJenny asks the same question every time she sees Sheriff Watson. Are there any criminals in jail this month? He remarks ”the only criminal in our town is time.” “Well, he’s a criminal everywhere I wish you could lock Old Man Time up.” Sheriff -” That would be alright. If we could just send Old Man Time to the electric chair.”\n\nThat reference hits George a little too close.\n\nLola’s lifeless body is found in the woods by the Sheriff’s son and George goes back home. There is one instance of black humor when George references ‘necks’ telling Jenny that the sheriff is “up to his neck in trouble.” George decides to go to his local bar to grab a beer, and on walking through the door the crowd accuses him of being the murderer. They all begin to laugh and tell him that they’ve been saying that to everyone who comes into the bar.\n\nJenny’s beau J. J. ( a role that I could easily have seen James Best take on, being adept at playing young handsome unruly types). J.J. breaks into a frenzy inside his jail cell, violently tearing apart his mattress. The sheriff sends George to his pharmacy to bring back a sedative. He keeps insisting, “You know I didn’t kill her.” Of course, George knows the truth.\n\nGeorge makes an anonymous phone call to the sheriff, disguising his voice, he confesses to the murder but hangs up before revealing his identity. J.J. is released on bail by his mother and begins dating Alice. Back at home with his mother and Alice, his mother is working as a laundrywoman to make ends meet. J.J. is certain he’s going to fry. Alice stands out from J.J.’s humble mother (Katherine Squire) in the downbeat atmosphere of their broken-down house, with the racy way she carries herself.\n\nGeorge calls J.J. to give him an anonymous warning. He also sends the judge a letter and winds up serving on the jury.\n\nThe trial begins and George consumed with guilt over J.J. being wrongly accused, insinuates himself and disrupts the courtroom proceedings. He becomes ‘the star juror’, asking a slew of questions that point to reasonable doubt.\n\nThat night, he finds a doll in a chair and a sign that says ‘electric chair’s tacked onto his back door. The jury comes back with a not-guilty verdict and J.J. is set free. When George leaves the courthouse, everyone in town now spurns him. Some of the older boys in town go to J.J.’s house and throw mud on his mother’s clean wash that drifts on the clothesline. The townsfolk even boycott George’s pharmacy, bewildered he cries to Jenny, “Well, what have I done, Jenny? Have I committed a crime? You act like you’d like to see me electrocuted.”\n\nJ.J. and his new girlfriend Alice (Jennifer West) show up at the pharmacy, looking like a true bad boy, with a black leather jacket, cowboy hat, and black boots, after all, he is the town’s murderous outcast and exile. He already started out from the wrong side of daylight, poor white trash, his mother taking in wash. Like Lola, he chooses to pal around with girls who don’t have any class. Lola was known as the town slut, who lived in a motel and Alice was a girl from up in the hills.\n\n“He’s already got himself a new one, Alice from up in the mountains.”\n\nJenny gets hysterical, “George Davies if you had wanted to kill me, you couldn’t have done a better job if you had used a knife, you couldn’t have caused more pain. You not only had to smear my name and the name of your child with scandal and ridicule, you had to dishonor us too. By going MAD!!!!\n\n‘Ridicule and scandal over our heads!”\n\n”You’re not getting out of this house George!”\n\nIt doesn’t matter that George had managed to persuade the jury that there wasn’t enough evidence to convict J.J. and he is found not guilty. The town goes crazy.\n\nAfter he loses his job, J.J. is offered the job of strangling chickens, the suggestion once again of George’s mode of killing Lola.\n\nGeorge tries to confess to the Sheriff. “I panicked and choked her and ran. Taking with me the weapons of the act. My and.”\n\nJ.J. gets angry with George and doesn’t think he did him any favors helping out.”’You couldn’t hurt a fly. I don’t want your lies to save me. I don’t want your burnt offering.”\n\nGeorge goes to the crime scene and hears haunting voices in his head accusing him of being a “killer.” Desperate for absolution, he confesses to the sheriff, but his admission falls on deaf ears. Meanwhile, a group of young men vandalize J.J.’s home and brutally beat him until Alice intervenes with a gun. George rushes to J.J.’s side and prevents him from taking his own life, but in the struggle, the gun goes off and J.J. is fatally shot.\n\nThe episode draws to a close with the sheriff telling George to go home to rest. George bursts into laughter as he realizes by the end of the ordeal, he’ll never be taken seriously. The irony and fatalistic tone of the episode has been flipped on its head, Lola’s murder will never find closure and we are left with a touch of macabre humor from the situation.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nThe episode is directed by Herschel Daugherty who directed 16 episodes, some of the best of Boris Karloff Thriller including The Grim Reaper starring William Shatner, Henry Daniels, Elizabeth Allen, and Natalie Schafer as mystery writer Beatrice Graves, and also Prisoner in the Mirror.

She is one of the most engaging actors who showed a resolute luster, and independence to take on Hollywood with the same veracity she pursued wicked Uncle Charlie in Shadow of a Doubt.\n\nTeresa Wright was not only endearing but there was a lack of ceremony and authenticity to her acting and her personal life She was discovered by Samuel Goldwyn and gained early recognition for her exceptional performances in her first three films, becoming the only actor to receive Oscar nominations for each of them. Wright earned an Oscar nomination for best supporting actress and one for Mrs. Miniver.\n\nIt stands to reason that Times drama editor Edwin Schallert described Wright’s burgeoning career as “one of the most remarkably brilliant for a young player in Hollywood.”\n\nDespite being a Hollywood star, she remained true to herself and rejected the pretentiousness that came along with being a star. She achieved Hollywood stardom on her own terms, without selling out for the sake of glamour.\n\nTeresa Wright was resolute in her refusal to pose for photographs while wearing bathing suits, as well as to subject herself to superficial interviews in gossipy fan magazines. And at first, Goldwyn told her he was not of “the bathing suit school of Hollywood producers.”\n\nBorn Muriel Teresa Wright in Harlem, New York City. While attending the exclusive Rosehaven School in Tenafly, New Jersey she discovered a passion for acting after watching Helen Hayes in “Victoria Regina.”\n\nWhile attending high school in Maplewood, N.J., Wright participated in theatrical productions. Although one teacher advised her to pursue typing instead, a public-speaking teacher mentored her and provided her with plays to read. He also arranged for her to spend two summers at the Wharf Theater in Provincetown.\n\nIn the two summers preceding her graduation, after receiving a scholarship, she began apprenticing at the Wharf Theatre in Massachusetts appearing in such plays as The Vinegar Tree and Susan and God.\n\nShe performed in school plays and graduated from Columbia High School in Maplewood, New Jersey graduating in 1938, then made the decision to pursue acting professionally and then moved to New York.\n\nWright had to drop her first name when she found out that another actress named Muriel Wright was already registered with Actors Equity.\n\nIn 1938, in her first play, she landed an understudy role in Thornton Wilder’s “Our Town” on Broadway and then toured in the play.\n\nIt was a minor role, but also served as a chance to understudy the lead ingénue character of Emily, actress Dorothy Maguire however when Maguire failed to return, Teresa continued in the same role under Martha Scott. Wright would eventually replace Martha Scott when the actress adapted the role of Emily in the film version.\n\nFollowing her successful stage performances, Wright made her remarkable Broadway debut as Mary in Life With Father in 1939. This caught the attention of playwright Lillian Hellman, who recommended her to Goldwyn for the screen version of Hellman’s The Little Foxes.\n\nIt was during her one-year run performance in Life with Father when a talent scout from Goldwyn saw her and Teresa Wright landed her breakout role as Alexandra in (READ MY FEATURE HERE:) The Little Foxes in 1941.\n\nHerbert Marshall Teresa Wright and Bette Davis in The Little Foxes 1941.\n\nShe gained recognition for her work alongside Bette Davis (who played the cold calculating mother Regina) and Patricia Collinge who reprised her unparalleled Broadway role as the mercurial Aunt Birdie) in the film.\n\nAt that time she had signed a contract with MGM but refused to do publicity stunts or cheese-cake shots that would turn her into a centerfold:\n\n“The aforementioned Teresa Wright shall not be required to pose for photographs in a bathing suit unless she is in the water. Neither may she be photographed running on the beach with her hair flying in the wind. Nor may she pose in any of the following situations: In shorts, playing with a cocker spaniel; digging in a garden; whipping up a meal; attired in firecrackers and holding skyrockets for the Fourth of July; looking insinuatingly at a turkey for Thanksgiving; wearing a bunny cap with long ears for Easter; twinkling on prop snow in a skiing outfit while a fan blows her scarf; assuming an athletic stance while pretending to hit something with a bow and arrow.”\n\nThough she became the unwilling pin-up girl, Teresa Wright became Goldwyn’s biggest overall star during the 1940s.\n\nTeresa received Oscar nominations for her roles in “Mrs. Miniver” (1942) the only movie she made for her studio MGM and “The Pride of the Yankees” (1942), winning the Best Supporting Actress trophy for Mrs. Miniver.\n\nIn both roles, Teresa Wright gave heartwarming performances as the granddaughter in the sentimental war-era Mrs. Miniver and as baseball icon Lou Gehrig’s kindhearted wife in Pride of the Yankees starring opposite Gary Cooper. Wright now one of the most appealing newcomers in Hollywood had garnered two Best Supporting Actress and Best Actress nods in the same year.\n\nShe holds the record for receiving back-to-back Academy Award nominations in her first three film roles, which still stands today.\n\nTeresa Wright received top billing for Shadow of a Doubt a film that was her personal favorite and which earned every bit of that limelight in Alfred Hitchcock’s psychological thriller placing Wright at the center of the story as serial killer Joseph Cotten’s unsuspecting niece Charlie.\n\nUnsuspecting at first…\n\nWhen Young Charlie (Wright) is over the moon about her favorite Uncle Charlie coming to her sleeping California town for a visit, the whole family celebrates his arrival. Her mother Emma, Charlie’s older sister (Patricia Collinge who appeared with Wright in The Little Foxes and Casanova Brown) can’t wait to dote on her baby brother. But soon, it comes to light that Charlie might have left strangled wealthy women in his wake, and in fact, may be The Merry Widow killer the police have been furiously chasing down up and down the coast. Now young Charlie who once dreamt of leaving her boring existence behind has stumbled onto a terrifying secret that threatens her life.\n\nTeresa Wright manages to give a nuanced performance as Charlie Newton who daringly holds her own in a game of cat and mouse with Joseph Cotten, all tangled up in danger as she carefully draws out his murderous impulses.\n\nWright never falters or is self-conscious in the role and her chemistry with Cotten is electric. She brings a complex emotional depth to young Charlie that elevates the film beyond its thriller trappings. Overall, Wright’s performance in Shadow of a Doubt is a testament to her skill as an actress and her ability to imbue even the most seemingly ordinary moments with profound emotional gravity.\n\nYoung Charlie is in alignment with killer Charlie’s acumen for subterfuge. In the house, all cracks on as simple as one of Emmie’s cakes if you don’t crack the eggs. But in the shadows beyond the edges, the family is unaware of, the two characters diverge – one set on self-preservation with a malignant disgust for fat lazy wives who live off their husbands and the other who seeks out the truth and bends toward humanity. Their same names are where it begins and ends. And Wright is a glowing jewel in the blackness of Hitchcock’s nightmare.\n\nUncle Charlie: The cities are full of women, middle-aged widows, husbands dead, husbands who’ve spent their lives making fortunes, working and working. And then they die and leave their money to their wives, their silly wives. And what do the wives do, these useless women? You see them in the hotels, the best hotels, every day by the thousands, drinking their money, eating their money, losing the money at the bridge, playing all day and all night, smelling of money, proud of their jewelry but of nothing else, horrible, faded, fat, greedy women.”\n\nYoung Charlie: ”But they’re alive. They’re human beings.”\n\nUncle Charlie: ”Are they? Are they, Charlie? Are they human or are they fat, wheezing animals, hmm? And what happens to animals when they get too fat and too old?”\n\nAfter marrying screenwriter Niven Busch in 1942, and appearing in the disappointing Casanova Brown 1944, Teresa Wright returned to form as Peggy Stephenson in William Wyler’s The Best Years of Our Lives, featuring the ensemble cast of the Academy Award-winning film in 1946. Wright played the caring daughter of Fredric March and Myrna Loy who develops a romantic connection with the troubled veteran played by Dana Andrews.\n\nTeresa Wright told friends that in William Wyler’s post-war drama, she was relieved to play an aspiring home wrecker.\n\n“I’m going to break that marriage up! I can’t stand it seeing Fred tied to a woman he doesn’t love and who doesn’t love him. Oh, it’s horrible for him. It’s humiliating and it’s killing his spirit. Somebody’s got to help him. “\n\nAt last, she could finally shed her wholesome persona trying to save the man she loved from a no-good tramp (Virginia Mayo as Marie) who barely knew Fred (Dana Andrews), but director Wyler couldn’t even give her credit- calling her “the best cryer in the business.” And Goldwyn continued to cast her as the unworldly, vulnerable lasses.\n\n1946 with Dana Andrews in The Best Years of Our Lives.\n\nIn 1946 she would star in Lewis Allen’s romantic drama The Imperfect Lady with leading man Ray Milland.\n\nNext, Wright played Thor Callum in her husband’s screenplay for Raoul Walsh’s Pursued 1947 – a western starring Robert Mitchum and Judith Anderson about a young boy plagued by nightmares of his family’s brutal murder who is taken in by a neighboring family. He falls for his kind-hearted adoptive sister, but he faces trouble from his hateful adoptive brother and enigmatic uncle who want him dead.\n\nSo In 1948 she was once again cast as an innocent waif Lark Ingoldsby in the romantic drama Enchantment.\n\nAnd while she was unhappy with the picture, the critics sang its praises-Newsweek said she “glows as the Cinderella who captivated three men,” and The New York Times said of her performance that she “plays with that breathless, bright-eyed rapture which she so remarkably commands.”\n\nBut Wright had enough of playing Cinderellas and after refusing to go on a long publicity tour promoting the film, Goldwyn canceled her $ 5,000-a-week contract and publicly criticize her as “uncooperative.”\n\n“I will gladly work for less if by doing so I can retain the common decency without which the most acclaimed job becomes intolerable,” she told The Times during the wildly public brouhaha more than half a century ago.\n\nTeresa Wright would wind up starring in three films for studios other than Samuel Goldwyn Productions, and in the end, Enchantment opposite David Niven and Farley Granger would turn out to be her last picture with Goldwyn after she refused to star in the studio’s next film.\n\nIn December 1948, after rebelling against the studio system that brought her fame, Teresa Wright had a public falling out with Samuel Goldwyn, which resulted in the cancellation of Wright’s contract with his studio. In a statement published in The New York Times, Goldwyn cited as reasons her refusal to publicize the film Enchantment, and her being “uncooperative” and refusing to “follow reasonable instructions”.\n\nIn her written response, Wright denied Goldwyn’s charges and expressed no regret over losing her $5,000 per week contract.\n\n“I would like to say that I never refused to perform the services required of me; I was unable to perform them because of ill health. I accept Mr. Goldwyn’s termination of my contract without protest—in fact, with relief. The types of contracts standardized in the motion picture industry between players and producers are archaic in form and absurd in concept. I am determined never to set my name to another one … I have worked for Mr. Goldwyn for seven years because I consider him a great producer, and he has paid me well, but in the future, I shall gladly work for less if by doing so I can retain my hold upon the common decencies without which the most glorified job becomes intolerable.” –Teresa Wright\n\nEven though her removal resulted in Wright losing a salary of $125,000, it did not diminish her capability to secure distinguished parts. Despite working on her subsequent film for a significantly lower budget of $20,000, it turned out to be another timeless classic – a post-war era drama that was released in 1950. Teresa gave a marvelous performance in Fred Zimmerman’s The Men starring newcomer Marlon Brando.\n\nWorking freelance with other studios she appeared in several inconsequential pictures that were never critical successes, though she did star in screenwriter husband’s western thriller Pursued in 1947 starring alongside Robert Mitchum, and another of his, The Capture in 1950 another crime western starring with Lew Ayers.\n\nShe starred in Something to Live For in 1952 directed by George Stevens, starring Ray Milland and Joan Fontaine.\n\nShe appeared in California Conquest in 1952, Count the Hours! 1953 a film noir directed by Don Siegel and starring Shadow of a Doubt co-star Macdonald Carey. And after that, she appeared in Track of the Cat in 1954 and Escapade in Japan in 1957.\n\nIn 1952 Teresa Wright made her foray into television with an episode of Robert Montgomery Presents. The show was called And Never Come Back and 2 episodes of Betty Crocker Star Matinee.\n\nAlso in 1952, she starred with Joseph Cotton in Andrew L. Stone’s The Steel Trap an obscure film noir about a Los Angeles bank manager (Cotten) who comes up with a plan to steal money from the bank’s vault and flee to Brazil with unsuspecting wife Laurie. (Wright) Andrew L. Stone made quite a few off-the-beaten-path noirs like A Blueprint for Murder in 1953, The Night Holds Terror in 1955, and Cry Terror! In 1958.\n\nIn 1953 she was cast in The Actress, although she was only in her early 30s, Teresa Wright began taking on character roles, even playing Jean Simmons’ mother.\n\nThe Actress directed by George Cukor and written by Ruth Gordon it is an account of the actress/playwright Ruth Gordon’s life. Teresa Wright plays Annie Jones, with Jean Simmons as Ruth Gordon Jones. The film also stars Spencer Tracy, Ian Wolfe, Anthony Perkins, Kay Williams, and Mary Wickes.\n\nDuring a period in which Teresa Wright struggled to find dramatic roles, though immersed in her distinguished career in the theater she started to do considerable work for television starting with live dramatic anthology series.\n\nThe Golden Age of TV provided another lifeline to active work. She remained the strong actor that she was in productions including a TV adaptation of the beloved holiday classic, The Miracle on 34th Street (1955), in which she played the role Maureen O’Hara brought to life.\n\nWright was keeping very busy on television. She would appear as Mary Todd Lincoln in Love is Eternal installment of General Electric Theater and that same year in 1955 she appear on The Elgin Hour, Your Play Time, The Loretta Young Show, 3 episodes o Lux Video Theatre, The Alcoa Hour and a TV movie called The Devil’s Disciple. In 1956 she appeared on Screen Directors Playhouse and 2 episodes of Four Star Playhouse, 3 episodes of Climax!, Star Stage, The Star and the Story, Celebrity Playhouse, Studio 57, and 2 episodes of The 20th Century-Fox Hour.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1957 she appeared on several episodes of Schlitz Playhouse and The Ford Television Theatre, also in 1957 with an episode of The Web and Playhouse 90. Between 1954-1962 she made 5 appearances on The United States Steel Hour.\n\nShe also began shifting her focus to the stage, where she found the dependability her acting craved. She appeared in productions of Salt of the Earth in 1952, Bell, Book and Candle, and The Country Girl in 1953. In 1954 she starred in Henry James’ The Heiress and in The Rainmaker in 1955. In 1957 she co-starred with Pat Hingle in The Dark at the Top of the Stairs returning to Broadway.\n\nThroughout her television career, she received three Emmy nominations. The first nomination was for her portrayal of Annie Sullivan in the 1957 CBS adaptation of “The Miracle Worker.” Her second nomination was for her role as the renowned photographer in “The Margaret Bourke-White Story” on NBC in 1960. Lastly, she was nominated for a guest appearance on the short-lived CBS series “Dolphin Cove” in 1989.\n\nShe starred as Ruth Simmons in the captivating, low-budget The Search for Bridey Murphy (1956) which tells the story of an American housewife who believed she lived before. And in 1958 she appeared in the film noir crime drama The Restless Years with John Saxon and Sandra Dee.\n\nAnd In 1959, she married playwright Robert Anderson, continuing to focus on the stage and working in television.

She also toured across the United States in stage productions of Mary, Mary (1962), Tchin-Tchin (1963) as Pamela Pew-Picket, and The Locksmith (1965) as Katherine Butler Hathaway.\n\nTeresa made numerous television appearances throughout the decade, including on CBS’s The Alfred Hitchcock Hour (1964), NBC’s Bonanza (1964), CBS’s The Defenders (1964, 1965), and CBS Playhouse (1969). She would also appear in numerous made-for-TV movies.\n\nIn 1975, Teresa Wright appeared as Linda Loman opposite George C. Scott in the Broadway revival of Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman.

During her appearance in Los Angeles for a performance in Mornings at Seven at the Ahmanson Theater, she shared a bit of her wisdom with aspiring actors in a USC class in 1982. “I wouldn’t pursue film, and I didn’t back then. I’d use every angle to try to get into a repertory company.”\n\nIn 1989, she earned her third Emmy Award nomination for her performance in the CBS drama series Dolphin Cove.

Glamour girls are born, not made. And the real ones can be glamorous even if they don’t wear magnificent clothes. I’ll bet Lana Turner would look glamorous in anything.”\n\nTeresa Wright was a masterful actor, luminous, unflinchingly genuine, and too – she is unforgettably resilient, and undeniably beautiful.\n\nTRIVIA:\n\nAccording to A. Scott Berg’s book, “Goldwyn: A Biography”, it is stated that Samuel Goldwyn “offered her a contract that night” (pg. 358). However, in a 1959 interview with Reel Classics, Teresa expressed her interest in playing the part of Alexandra in “The Little Foxes” but was hesitant about committing to a long-term studio contract. Despite this, after the film wrapped and her attempts to return to the stage were unsuccessful, she ultimately signed with Goldwyn and remained in Hollywood. (The interview is archived in the Columbia University Oral History Research Office.)\n\nHer nickname was “Mooch”.\n\nMarried two famous Playwrights: Niven Busch and Robert Anderson, both also native New Yorkers.\n\nWas the first female star signed under contract to Samuel Goldwyn Productions.\n\nWas supposed to star in The Bishop’s Wife opposite David Niven and Cary Grant, which is a vehicle that Goldwyn had bought especially for her.\n\nIn honor of her heartfelt performance in The Pride of the Yankees (1942), when Teresa Wright died in 2005, when the roll call of former Yankees who had passed on was announced, her name was read out among all the ballplayers.\n\nAlong with Fay Bainter, Barry Fitzgerald, Jessica Lange, Sigourney Weaver, Al Pacino, Holly Hunter, Emma Thompson, Julianne Moore, Jamie Foxx, Cate Blanchett, and Scarlett Johansson, she is one of only twelve actors to receive Academy Award nominations in two acting categories in the same year. She was nominated for Best Actress for The Pride of the Yankees (1942) and Best Supporting Actress for Mrs. Miniver (1942) at the 15th Academy Awards in 1943, winning the latter award.\n\nHer husband, Niven Busch, originally penned Duel in the Sun (1946) for her to play the lead, as a departure from her girl-next-door roles. But pregnancy forced her to drop out, and Jennifer Jones got the lead.\n\nShe was originally set to star in producer David O. Selznick’s Duel in the Sun (1946), which was written by her then-husband, Niven Busch. However, shortly before filming was to begin she got pregnant, and Busch had to go to Selznick’s office to inform him that she would have to bow out of the film. Selznick, known for his single-mindedness, tried to talk Busch into letting her play the part, which called for a lot of physical action, and Busch absolutely refused. As he turned to leave the office, Selznick blurted out, “Dammit, Busch, she isn’t the only one you screwed!”\n\nShe was nominated for the 2015 New Jersey Hall of Fame for his services in the Performance Arts.\n\nTeresa Wright’s cheeky stroke of genius in this episode is filled with macabre and black humor delivering a diabolically composed and humorous resolve as she works her way through each of Dan Duryea’s other wives, as casually as a housewife doing chores. A serial murderer housewife that is.\n\nIt is perhaps one of my favorite performances of Wright because of the comical dark side she invokes, quite the departure as Wright greatly envisioned from the ‘best little cryer’ that had been hitched to her in the 1940s and 50s.\n\nHer chemistry with Duryea is fabulous as they play off each other and slowly the revelation comes to his character that she’s been shadowing him on each of his routine rendezvous’ with the other Mrs. Browns at his 3 other homes. It’s a brilliant setup. As he realizes she’s a killer and he’s out three wives.\n\nAnd now… THREE WIVES TOO MANY!\n\nDialogue:\n\nMarion Brown tells her husband (Duryea)- “You have been a bigamist 4 times. Now you can stay alive with me or be dead away from me!”\n\nSYNOPSIS:\n\nDan Duryea is a gambler and a proud bigamist name Raymond Brown. Ray has a passion for fine cuisine and is a professional gambler who uses his wealthy wive’s money to finance his bets.\n\nEach of his wives believes he is a salesman, so he uses his trips away from home to visit his bookie when spending a few days with each wife in three different cities.\n\nHe truly loves his wife… I mean all four of them. But something is going quite wrong. One by one his wealthy meal tickets are all turning up dead.\n\nThough Marion is Ray’s third and they’ve been married for three years. She is the most central wife and has been the long-time dutiful wife who discovers that Ray is a bigamist. Marion has been patiently waiting to finally have her philandering husband all to herself.\n\nCould she be the one who is bumping off all of Ray’s wives? Wright takes a much different approach from the gentle farm wife Stella in The Alfred Hitchcock Hour’s Lonely Place and shows herself off to be quite resourceful when holding onto her cheating husband.\n\nMarion who is the wealthiest and oldest of the bunch is driven to murder by jealousy and the survival instinct to keep Ray all to herself. She visits each of the other wives and quietly dispenses with them by lacing their cocktails with poison.\n\nEach town Ray arrives at home to see one of his wives, the police are there while she is being carried out on a stretcher. At first, the police just chalk up each death to suicide and he convinces the cops that he has an alibi. Raymond starts to suspect that Marion is behind the deaths, but he doesn’t have any proof.\n\nBecause each murder has happened in 3 different cities, the police never connect the women’s deaths. Marion is able to move easily from murder to murder because she is a refined, beautiful, and charming woman who can easily seduce unsuspecting women into dropping their guard.\n\nAnd she has learned to be a fantastic bartender who brings her own strychnine.\n\nRay has managed to stick to an unchallenging subterfuge with his four wives, in order to prevent them from knowing about each other.\n\nDirected by Joseph M. Newman, who directed 10 episodes of The Alfred Hitchcock Hour, Three Wives Too Many is a powerfully satirical parody with sharpened edges pulled off masterfully by Teresa Wright who is the strong protagonist Marion Brown, in a predominantly woman-centered thriller. Leaving Duryea on the periphery looking in on the wake of his misadventures and marital anarchy. The episode explores greedy love, betrayal, and delicious revenge.\n\nAs Brown comes to the realization that all of his wives are now dead, the television adaptation abandons suspense, instead going for the cynical observations about post-war American gender roles of husbands and wive in the 1960s.\n\nThe episode is a masterful bit of dark humor as the two paths converge, the take-offs and landings of Ray and Marion both traveling on the same path but for different reasons, and only Marion is aware of both.\n\nThe show begins in Newark, N.J. where a taxi pulls up to an apartment complex. A woman, elegantly attired and with a little grey in her hair, steps out of the cab. There’s a close-up of her finger pressing the doorbell of an apartment. The card on top of the button bears the inscription “Mr. & Mrs. R. Brown.”\n\nNow inside the apartment, a younger woman in pants gets up from an upscale modern sofa (a contrast to the traditional interior design and furnishings of her home in Baltimore) to answer the door. Marion, tells Bernice that she flew in from Baltimore just to see her. After dancing around with niceties, she lays it out that she’s a relative by marriage…\n\nBernice –“Forgive this place I’m a terrible housekeeper when my husband isn’t around -well even when he is.”\n\nMarion “It’s difficult to care when your husband’s gone so much.”\n\nBernice “Oh well won’t you sit down I didn’t even ask your name.”\n\nMarion “Mrs. Brown.”\n\nBernice “Mrs. Brown?”\n\nMarion “Mrs. Raymond Brown we’re kind of related.”\n\nBernice “Well that’s kind of reassuring, knowing I belong to such a large family.”\n\nMarion “Haha tremendous. I’m just astonished at how many relatives keep showing up in Baltimore.”\n\nBernice “Are you here on a pleasure trip Mrs. Brown- Oh that sounds like I’m talking to myself.”\n\nMarion “My name is Marion. Sort of on business for all of us but your husband said that for any big investment, both of you have to agree.”\n\nBernice “Oh no not always.”\n\nMarion “I mean since the money is really yours.”\n\nBernice “He told you that?”\n\nMarion “Well it’s true isn’t it?”\n\nBernice “Well in a way. When we were first married he needed some extra money and I had some. But then husbands and wives share don’t they?”\n\nMarion “Oh yes always, everything.”\n\nBernice “You say that so pointedly.”\n\nMarion “My dear the Browns are famous for getting to the point.”\n\nBernice “You’re not related are you There’s something in back of this Mrs. Brown what is it? You’re not remotely related to my husband.”\n\nMarion “That’s right.”\n\nShe maintains that sardonic southern charm that stings like a snake bite.\n\nMarion “It’s more than remotely.” her eyes flicker as she looks at Bernice\n\nBernice “I don’t understand.”\n\nMarion “I’m related directly to your husband.”\n\nBernice “How?”\n\nMarion “By a previous marriage.”\n\nBernice “You’re his ex-wife?”\n\nMarion “His present wife. He’s my husband too.”\n\nBernice “How could he! how could he!”\n\nMarion “By being selfish.”\n\nBernice “He was kind.”\n\nMarion “He married both of us. there may be others.”\n\nBernice “He loved me.”\n\nMarion “I know it hurts but you must realize what he is.”\n\nBernice “How can you be so unemotional about it?”\n\nMarion “I’ve had my tears…”\n\nAs the scene unfolds, Marion reveals Ray’s bigamy to Bernice (Jean Hale) and to us. Shaken, Bernice is consoled by Marion, who suggests they should both retaliate against their husband.\n\nMarion tells her, “’ You are a beautiful woman, Bernice, you’ll have no trouble at all finding a new husband. But a woman my age, now I would have a problem.'”\n\nHowever, Marion’s own sinister plan comes to light as she prepares cocktails for the two of them, but secretly laces Bernice’s drink with poison.\n\nHaving premeditated the murder, Marion takes great care to wipe her fingerprints from the bottle and glass. Bernice unwittingly ingests the lethal drink and promptly collapses onto the floor and Marion goes home to Baltimore.\n\nBrown is seen trimming a flower outside his house before he heads inside to give it to Marion. On the surface, it seems the perfect image of a happy couple. However, their easy banter carries an ominous undertone, evident to both Marion and us who have already seen Bernice lifeless on the floor after a lethal dose of Marion’s payback to Ray.\n\nRay thinks he’s been successful at hiding his secret life, but what Ray doesn’t realize is that Marion is onto him. Now both he and Marion share a blueprint of duplicitous and now sinister transgressions.\n\nShe’s happy he’s finally home. He tells her that he plans on taking her to Europe, where women in their 40s come into their own.\n\nAt some point, the scene turns ominous as Ray and Marion go down to the cellar to inspect the hole and the oil tank that will eventually be installed there. We’re aware that Ray feels something lurking as he slips and falls into the hole like a grave. He gazes up at the tank that is suspended over his head held only by a chain.\n\nMarion reaches for a crank handle that could potentially trigger the tank to release abruptly. Brown cautions her to handle it carefully, oblivious to the fact that she is privy to his marital treachery.\n\nShe tells him ”It just wants you here all the time.” and when she goes to hug him, he falls into the hole. He yells at her to take her hand off the handle. But she lingers a bit… one slip and the tank could fall and crush him.\n\nAs the camera follows Marion up the stairs it pauses and something in her eyes says that she knew exactly what she was doing when her hand lingered on the handle.\n\nOnce Ray goes back upstairs Marion strokes the handle following his footsteps flirting with the idea of killing him. She seems to be holding it like an old friend. Or maybe a new one?\n\nTeresa Wright is an absolute natural beauty. She’s glowing and totally empowered.\n\nAnother plane lands, prompting Brown to drive to a nearby public park where he rendezvouses with Bleeker, who outwardly appears like a businessman but is, in reality, a bookie. Brown places a significant bet and Bleeker who is already on his third marriage and confesses that he’s constantly arguing with his wife. Brown offers some discreet and telling advice, that you can choose to marry “for love AND money…\n\n“I’m a creature of habit.”\n\nRay gets home to see Bernice and finds the police swarming all over the apartment, investigating what they say is an apparent suicide. The scene is played as an absurd comedy as he seems utterly flustered by the commotion, all the while hiding the fact that this is only one of his many wives. He insists that she wouldn’t kill herself. She just bought a new cookbook, because she knew he liked fine cooking. Everything she did was to please him. She was happy. “She was beautiful and strong. I loved her.”\n\n”I envy you…”\n\nFollowing the funeral, Brown is confronted by Bernice’s sister and brother-in-law at the empty apartment he lived with Bernice. Her catty sister confronts Ray about Bernice having cried every day from loneliness, and his being on the road all the time. This paints a very different picture of their seemingly ideal marriage. She blames him for her death However, as they leave, the sister’s timid husband tells Ray that “I envy you”, a hint that he wishes his overbearing wife would meet a similar fate.\n\nRay is now in Hartford he goes to call his other wife Lucille. But by now she has answered the door and once again Marion is waiting for her and doesn’t waste any time putting her cards on the table.\n\n“Why did you do it? Why did you marry my husband?”\n\nShe asks, “‘Why did you marry my husband?'” As she points a small pistol at Lucille. This other beautiful wife tells Marion that they’ve been married for five years, which means she’s been married the longest to Ray.\n\nMarion toys with Lucille and tells her that she has not yet decided whether to kill her or not.\n\nThe two women begin to talk about him and Marion shares her insight with Lucille, ‘A man is what he does, not what he says.’\n\nQuote shockingly, Lucille defends Ray ‘I admire any man who can get along with so many women.”\n\nAs part of Marion’s method of choice, she goes into the kitchen to prepare the drinks and slips the poison into the bottle. One more to go…\n\nLucille (Linda Lawson) played the role of the enigmatic mermaid in Curtis Harrington’s surreal NIGHT TIDE.\n\nTHE BEACH PARTY BLOGATHON- CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON (1954) & Night Tide (1961) : Gills-A LOVE STORY!!!\n\n“He seemed happy.”\n\n“Well, he pretended so much how could you tell? A man is what he does not what he says. Why should we spare his feelings we’re not his only wives.”\n\n”Mix it with something.” Marion laughs, “what did you say?” I said mix it with something.” “Delighted!” She pours the poisonous cocktail.\n\nOnce again Ray arrives as Lucille’s lifeless body is being taken out of their apartment. And once again he is greeted by another policeman who says she must have killed herself. Ray is absolutely aghast at this point, “She loved life too much!'” And in this odd twist on the husband always being suspected, he is not suspected of foul play.\n\nRay phones Marion that he’s leaving for Boston and for the first time she asks to go with him and he says yes. In their hotel room, she is beaming after having had a ‘wonderful day.’\n\nHe tells her that he has a late-night business appointment, but she informs him that she’s going home that night. Revealing in a cryptic comment –\n\n‘I know I’m becoming more important in your life every day,’ she says, and he responds, “‘More than you realize …'” Wright is so comically effective with all her dialogue using a cheeky sardonic purr that tickles you with each delivery. This particular line highlights its best example.\n\nRay suspects Marion but still isn’t quite sure, those his facial expression conveys it with mocking distress, as she pulls the strings. He meets Bleeker one more time and tells him that he’ll need more financial backers before he can proceed with any more wagers. Though he loves each one of his wives, essentially they have been business ventures after all.\n\nThe last wife is carried out by the police.\n\nHe enters his house in Baltimore and finds Marion lying on the couch, and he fears the worst.\n\nWhen she wakes up and seems perfectly fine, Brown feels relieved. Marion suggests they have a cocktail informing him that she’s become very good at mixing drinks.\n\nAnd as they talk, he notices a pamphlet titled The Widow’s Guide on the coffee table and grows visibly worried.\n\nHe runs downstairs to check the basement and discovers that the hole is still there and will remain as a reminder that it can always turn into a grave. But the tank suspended above it is now gone.\n\n“Marion!!!!!”\n\n“Why did you yell at me like that?” “You were so still. So motionless.”\n\nMarion insists on mixing Ray a cocktail. “Where’s the harm? A drink here and there never harmed anybody. At least not me… I turned over a whole new leaf”\n\n“It sounds like you turned over a whole new tree.” “You are delicious!”\n\n“She tells him to stop acting like a fugitive from justice .”Why’d you say that?”\n\n“As if the police had you linked with some terrible crime.”\n\n“Out with it! Say it and get it over with.”\n\nMarion uses his traveling sales job as a metaphor.\n\nThat the company has asked too much of him. That he should concentrate on this area. ‘Our Area.” Meaning their marriage.\n\n“What if I don’t like it?”\n\n“You don’t have to like it. You just have to accept it.”\n\n“Then it’s true You did it… all of them.”\n\nShe drinks from both glasses. “See a marital bond.”\n\nWhen he goes to call the police, she warns him, “I will see you executed for murder if you leave me.”\n\nWhatever the police find out they’ll only discover that you had a motive. ”The police accepted my explanations.” “Explanation singular. One explanation yes, two…maybe… three.” (she shakes her head)\n\n“I will see you executed for murder if you leave me.”\n\n“Now you can be happy with me or be dead away from me.”\n\n“I was a happy man.” “A very unhappy man.” “Ecstatically happy.”\n\nShe gives him the choice. If not the police… there’s always the hole in the cellar.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nThree Wives Too Many was adapted for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour and broadcast on CBS on Friday, January 3, 1964.

Her career was temporarily disrupted by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950s.\n\nIn her earliest days on screen, she was usually cast as wide-eyed ingénues or faithful wives. As an actress her career became visible with her Academy Award-winning performance as Stella in director Elia Kazan’s adaption of Tennessee William’s play A Streetcar Named Desire in 1951.\n\nIn 1947, renowned film producer David O. Selznick, who had played a pivotal role in discovering Kim Hunter, suggested her to his former wife, Irene Selznick, who was producing the Broadway adaptation of Tennessee Williams’s play. This opportunity turned out to be the defining role of Hunter’s career, making it the most recognizable and memorable character she ever portrayed.\n\nShe gained recognition for her portrayal of Stella Kowalski in the original production of Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire, which she reprised in the 1951 film adaptation and won both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nKim Hunter was honored with the Donaldson and New York Drama Critics Awards. Repeating the role of Stella in the 1951 film version, her first major Silver Screen project, she won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress, the Look Magazine Award, and the Hollywood Foreign Correspondents Award. She also won the 1952 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Motion Picture for the same film.\n\nDuring her rise to fame in A Streetcar Named Desire, she was asked if she had any ambitions of becoming a Hollywood superstar. Hunter said\n\n“In the back of my mind, I think I felt that if that kind of stardom had occurred, I wouldn’t have fought it. But such stardom often happens through extraordinary luck or an extraordinary personal quality or an extraordinary drive in a human being. One can always hope for luck, but I don’t have that kind of annihilating drive as a human being. You know, ‘Out of my way, here I come.’ I’m not that kind of a person. And the other thing is, it’s just not my way of performing, I don’t go into a role saying ‘I’m going to take what is me and make that the most important thing in the part I’m playing.’ I do work from myself and use all of myself but I don’t take any personal quality and try to find the character to portray it. It’s an image thing, I just want to do the best I can with the given, in life or in work.” – Kim Hunter\n\nEven after her various roles in film, she began a prolific career in television and back to theater after having been temporarily blacklisted.\n\nKim Hunter’s film debut was the role of Mary Gibson in Val Lewton’s low-budget suspense art piece for RKO – based on Dewitt Bodeen’s The Seventh Victim in 1943.\n\nIt’s a story of a modern-day arcane society of murderous Epicureans.

The narrative creates a disparity between what the characters know and what they desire to know. Mark Robson maintains focused on a thematic and structural discovery of the common human experience of limitation.\n\nA Symphony of Dark Patches- The Val Lewton Legacy 1943\n\n(1942) Stage: Appeared in “Arsenic and Old Lace”, Pasadena Playhouse, Pasadena, CA\n\nIn Kim Hunter’s second film, she was cast as Doris Dumbrowski in Edward Dmytryk’s Tender Comrade 1943 released by RKO.

The film stars Robert Mitchum and Dean Jagger as Paul Baxter.\n\nIn 1945 she appeared as Frances Hotchkiss in John Farrow’s romantic comedy-drama You Came Along.\n\nShe then co-starred with David Niven in Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger’s much-heralded British romantic fantasy, ”Stairway to Heaven (1946).\n\nIn her first leading role, she was cast as June in the much-heralded British romantic fantasy Stairway to Heaven known as A Matter of Life and Death in 1946 directed by British duo Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. She co-starred with David Niven.\n\nAn RAF pilot Peter Carter (played by David Niven) miraculously survives a jump from his burning plane and meets the American radio operator (Kim Hunter) to whom he just conveyed his last wishes.

And like Lee Grant and too many who suffered at the hands of HUAC during the witch hunts of the McCarthy era during the 1950s, Kim Hunter was blacklisted and unable to return to television and film for a time.\n\n“Kim Hunter and I were both members of the Actors Studio, very celebrated, very young. Both were in our early twenties when I acted in Detective Story and Kim acted in A Streetcar Named Desire. We both originated roles on Broadway, appeared in films, and were nominated for the Best Supporting Actress Oscar in 1952. Kim won for her moving Stella in Streetcar. I won the Cannes International Film Festival award for Best Actress of 1952 for Detective Story. We were golden girls with great lives and careers ahead of us.” Lee Grant\n\nKim Hunter was talked into telling her story in front of the committee. She testified that Vincent Hartnett considered an expert on the topic of alleged communist infiltration, and founder of the publication of Red Channels, asked for and received $200 from her to clear her name.\n\nAnd demanded her show of support, but when she refused, “he demanded she sends in a telegram in support of AWARE, Inc. She agreed. She was blackmailed for work, pure and simple.” – Lee Grant I Said Yes to Everything.\n\nAlthough blacklisted, Hunter was not a member of the Communist Party, simply a campaigner for civil rights and a sponsor of a 1949 World Peace Conference in New York.\n\nKim Hunter returned to Broadway giving 186 performances as Luba opposite Claude Rains and Jack Palance in Darkness at Noon in 1951.\n\nAs early as 1949 Hunter began appearing in dramatic teleplays and anthology shows on TV. The Silver Theatre, The Philco Television Playhouse, The Ford Theatre Hour, and Actor’s Studio. In 1952 she appeared in episodes of Robert Montgomery Presents, and Celanese Theatre.\n\nThen came the role that would not only immortalize the use of the name “STELLA!”\n\nMarlon Brando’s ‘simian mating call’ inspire a gestalt reaction in our collective consciousness, but it would also ensure Kim Hunter’s ascension as a serious actor.\n\n“Stanley plants himself on the street outside his apartment and screams, ” Stella!’’ In the censored version, she stands up inside, pauses, starts down the stairs, looks at him, continues down the stairs, and they embrace. In the uncut version, only a couple of shots are different – but what a difference they make! Stella’s whole demeanor seems different, seems charged with lust. In the apartment, she responds more visibly to his voice. On the stairs, there are closeups as she descends, showing her face almost blank with desire. And the closing embrace, which looks in the cut version as if she is consoling him, looks in the uncut version as if she has abandoned herself to him.” – Roger Ebert\n\nElisa Kazan’s Southern Gothic drama adapted from Tennessee William’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play, shined the spotlight on 4 incredible actors Vivien Leigh, and Marlon Brando in only his second film, Karl Malden, and of course Kim Hunter.\n\nA Streetcar Named Desire is considered to be one of the fifteen films that changed American cinema.\n\nSouthern Belle Blanche DuBois who dances and suffers with shadows from her past and present anguish, takes refuge at her sister Stella’s New Orleans tenement apartment where she lives with her brutish husband Stanley Kowalski.\n\nBlanche DuBois is a middle-aged high school English teacher who arrives in New Orleans and boards a streetcar called “Desire” to reach the French Quarter.\n\nBlanche informs them that she is on leave from her teaching job due to her nerves and requests to stay with them. In truth, she lost her job for having sexual relations with one of her students.\n\nWhile Blanche exudes a demure and refined demeanor, Stanley’s behavior is crude and vulgar, which creates a stark contrast between them and fuels mutual wariness and hostility. Stella is in the middle.\n\n“No performance had more influence on modern film acting styles than Brando’s work as Stanley Kowalski, Tennessee Williams’ rough, smelly, sexually charged hero… Brando, as Kowalski, stalks through his little apartment in the French Quarter. He is, the dialogue often reminds us, an animal. He wears a torn T-shirt that reveals muscles and sweat. He smokes and drinks in a greedy way.”– Roger Ebert\n\nWhile Kim Hunter as Stella welcomes Blanche as a guest, she is masterful as the torn young sister and wife of Stanley – who is often condescending and critical of Blanche.\n\nBlanche urges Stella to leave him, calling him a sub-human animal. Stella disagrees and stays. Blanche discloses that the family’s estate, Belle Reve, has been seized by creditors, leaving her penniless and with no place to go.\n\nShe also reveals that she was widowed at a young age after her husband’s suicide. In the film version, her husband’s homosexuality was censored. Stanley becomes suspicious that Blanche may be concealing an inheritance\n\nKim Hunter’s more nuanced performance as Stella is undeniably more complex throughout the combustible environment created by Blanche’s alcoholism and her spiral into madness which is more tangible in the un-cut director’s version restored in 1993.\n\nOne night, while Stella is in labor, Blanche waxes poetic about old admirers and future plans but Stanley mercilessly destroys her illusions.\n\nIn their physical struggle, It is conveyed that Stanley rapes her. He also ruins any chances of happiness for her with Mitch (Karl Malden) by disclosing the dark secrets about her past.\n\nIn the unsterilized version, Kim Hunter’s portrayal of Stella offers a clearer understanding of her attraction to Stanley, making her character less mysterious. Vivien Leigh’s Blanche, on the other hand, is depicted as a sexually charged woman who disguises herself as a fragile and fading flower, revealing her hidden desires more explicitly than in the previous rendition. As for Karl Malden’s hapless gentleman caller -Mitch, Blanche’s unsuspecting suitor, appears more vulnerable and naive.\n\nStella refuses to believe Blanche about Stanley assaulting her and Mitch rejects her once Stanley poisons his mind, Blanche descends further into a fantasy world and must be restrained and taken away, as the doctor speaks Kindly to her it leads to the famous line, “I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.”\n\nOnce Stella realizes that Blanche was telling the truth, she takes the baby upstairs to the Hubbell’s apartment having decided that she is leaving Stanley.\n\nWhen “A Streetcar Named Desire” was first released, it created a firestorm of controversy. It was immoral, decadent, vulgar, and sinful, its critics cried. And that was after substantial cuts had already been made in the picture, at the insistence of Warner Bros., driven on by the industry’s own censors.” – Ebert\n\nThe subsequent film and TV adaptations opted for a bleaker ending, having Stella remain with Stanley for various reasons. This twist was added to conform to the Production Code so the film industry in their need to punish Stanley for the rape added the alternate ending.\n\nStreetcar Trivia:\n\nAnother scene lost crucial dialogue. Stella tells her sister, “Stanley’s always smashed things. Why, on our wedding night, as soon as we came in here, he snatched off one of my slippers and rushed about the place smashing the light bulbs with it.” After Blanche is suitably shocked, Stella, leaning back with a funny smile, says “I was sort of thrilled by it.” All that dialogue was trimmed, perhaps because it provided a glimpse into psychic realms the censors were not prepared to acknowledge. (Ebert)\n\nAs the film progresses, the set of the Kowalski apartment actually gets smaller to heighten the suggestion of Blanche’s increasing claustrophobia.\n\nComposer Alex North wrote and recorded the first ever jazz-orientated film score for a dramatic picture. The score served to color the sound of the film’s steamy New Orleans setting. It has become a well-deserved landmark in the history of film music and paved the way for numerous movie jazz scores.\n\nThe Catholic Legion of Decency threatened to sink the box office prospects for the film with a Condemned rating. Elia Kazan made a last-ditch effort to get his un-cut version seen by the public. He asked Warner Bros. to try releasing the film in both his director’s version and the edited version, with each clearly marked so audience members could choose for themselves. Warners said no, and Kazan then campaigned for his director’s cut to be screened at the Venice Film Festival. Again, Warners refused, since the Legion mandated that only their approved version could be released, and the studio didn’t want to risk earning a Condemned rating which would hurt the film at the box office. As a result, Kazan’s version would not be seen until Warners restored the film in 1993.\n\nthe Catholic Legion of Decency led to even further cuts, most of them having to do with references to homosexuality and rape. In his memoirs, Tennessee Williams wrote that he liked the film but felt it was “slightly marred by the Hollywood ending.”\n\nBrando hadn’t yet become a sensation Robert Mitchum was offered the role of Stanley Kowalski, but RKO refused to let him do it. Olivia de Havilland was offered the part of Blanche but turned it down.\n\nAfter the Streetcar, Hunter co-starred with Humphrey Bogart and Ethel Barrymore in Richard Brook’s film noir classic Deadline USA in 1952. It is the story of a crusading newspaper editor who exposes a gangster’s crimes while also trying to keep the paper from going out of business. Also\n\nin 1952, she starred in Anything Can Happen, an episode of The Gulf Playhouse in 1953, and played Joan of Arc in the segment The Trial of St. Joan for the Omnibus Tv series in 1955. Followed that same year with Screen Directors Playhouse and Lux Video Theatre. The dramatic teleplays suited Kim Hunter’s acting background perfectly.\n\nDuring the early 1950s, theatre called once again for The Chase, The Children’s Hour, Write Me A Murder, and many other plays, including the role of Sylvia Crewes in The Tender Trap in 1954.\n\nNext in 1956, she would appear alongside Bette Davis in Storm Center as Martha Lockridge. It is a drama that hits close to home during the turbulent climate of the Red Scare, with Davis playing a librarian in the 1950s who is shunned by the town when she refuses to remove a book on Communism from her library.\n\nAlicia (Davis) finds herself in a challenging transition as she prepares to leave a job she has dedicated her entire life to. Library assistant Martha Lockridge her successor says: “Whatever was the issue? A stubborn woman was fired. Your council blew itself up with civic virtue. The city got something to buzz about.”\n\nIn 1956, with the HUAC’s influence subsiding, she starred in Rod Serling’s Peabody Award-winning teleplay on Playhouse 90, “Requiem for a Heavyweight” co-starring Jack Palance. The telecast won multiple Emmy Awards including Best Single Program of the Year.\n\nIn 1957, Hunter starred alongside Mickey Rooney in the live CBS-TV production of The Comedian, a dramatic work penned by Rod Serling and directed by John Frankenheimer.\n\nShe also appeared in The Young Stranger in 1957 also directed by John Frankenheimer.\n\nIn 1958, television continued to give Hunter visibility in shows like Studio One, Climax!, and Alcoa Theatre and she portrayed Amelia Spaulding in the 1959 episode “Incident of the Misplaced Indians” on Rawhide, and appeared in another television western on NBC TV series Bonanza and played Sister Angela in an episode of The Lineup. She appeared in two episodes of General Electric Theater in 1956 and one in 1960 titled Early to Die.\n\nThe early 1960s on TV included Sunday Showcase, Playhouse 90, a TV movie called Special for Women ‘The Cold Woman’ and appeared as Edna Dagger in Face of the Enemy an episode of Naked City in 1962, followed by The DIck Powell Theatre, The United States Steel Hour and an episode of The Eleventh Hour in a very touching dramatic piece called Of Roses and Nightingales and Other Lovely Things that same year.\n\nIn 1963, she appeared in The Doctors and the Nurses, in an episode directed by Alex March. The show, an extraordinary dramatic series is practically non-existent and features some of the finest bits of acting, directing, and camerawork. Kim Hunter appears in They Are As Lions. 1963 offered Hunter roles on Breaking Point and Arrest and Trial.\n\nThis leads us to The Alfred Hitchcock Hour’s episode which features Hunter’s performance as the black-hearted Adelaide Winters.\n\nIn 1964, she played Dr. Bea Brice who works in a progressive sanitarium for the mentally ill. There she meets Jean Seberg. “Somehow insanity seems a lot less sinister to watch in a man than a woman.” – Dr. Brice\n\n4 Outstanding Actresses: It’s 1964 and there’s cognitive commotion!\n\nKim Hunter followed up with appearances on The Defenders and Dr. Kildare in 1965. She gave a forgotten performance (overshadowed by Planet of the Apes having preceded it), as that of Kim Hunter’s Betty Graham in director Frank Perry and Sydney Pollock’s The Swimmer starring Burt Lancaster. A film where Lancaster’s often scenery-chewing performances are completely eclipsed by Janice Rule’s profoundly stunning performance as his ex-lover Shirley Abbott.\n\nThen in 1968, her second significant cultural identity would emerge with Planet of the Apes directed by Franklin J. Schaffner with teleplays written by Rod Serling and Michael Wilson based on the novel by science fiction author Pierre Boulle. Hunter’s character held a significant role in the movie, appearing alongside British actors Roddy McDowall and Maurice Evans.\n\nHunter auditioned for the part in 1967., She had known Producer Arthur P. Jacobs for many years: “he had been my press agent before he went into making films. So he was an old friend, very much so.” – (An Afternoon with Kim Hunter – ‘Apesfan’ Special Edition 1999)\n\nKim Hunter in addition to her iconic role as Stella, will always be beloved for her recurring role as scientist Dr. Zira who possessed a strong intellectual curiosity about the species called man. Her portrayal of the chimpanzee scientist brought a lot of endearing charm amidst the raging violence to Planet of the Apes in 1968 and its sequels Beneath the Planet of the Apes 1970 and Escape from the Planet of the Apes in 1971.\n\nIn the first of the three Apes movies, Hunter is married to Galen played by Roddy McDowall whose own performance is memorable—both sympathetic characters who are the beating heart of the story. Hunter even spend hours at the Los Angeles Zoom in order to prepare for the role which would prove to be challenging to make it seem realistic. Hunter felt that the first Planet of the Apes had a “special, experimental nature that was exciting.”\n\nShe said of the scene where the coquettish Zira kisses Roddy McDowall -“They kiss somewhat as we do, but not exactly. With apes, it’s more a biting of the lips, and a caressing, rather than the solid contact humans prefer to make. Anyhow, it’s really very dear.”\n\n“It’s all very antiseptic and mechanical, and we had to work hard to get a romantic effect. We had no actual physical contact with each other, you see. You might say that it was something like modern dancing.” – Kim Hunter\n\n“She portrayed a highly intelligent and articulate chimpanzee anthropologist whose abiding interest is the study of an inarticulate sub‐species known as man… It is quite impossible to recognize” Miss Hunter in her role as Dr. Zira, a chimpanzee scientist. Like all the leading “anthropoids” in these films, she wears heavy makeup that takes more than three hours a day to apply and completely disguises her features. Only her voice is recognizable.” Ira Peck New York Times\n\n“As he seemed to find comfort and freedom with the external protections,” she said, “so do I. It’s like putting on somebody else’s cloak in a sort of total way. From a performing point of view, playing Dr. Zira was really quite freeing. In every other way, it was a trap — like being boxed in.”\n\nKim Hunter was put through the rigors during the grueling makeup process by Rick Baker and Kazuhiro Tsuji.\n\nAccording to Hunter: “I had to take a tranquilizer every morning when I sat down in that make-up chair – it was so completely claustrophobic. After a few weeks, I said, well, now you’re used to the whole thing, you shouldn’t need this crutch anymore. One morning I didn’t take it, and my make-up artist, Leo Lotito, said to me after that session, ‘If you don’t take one of those tranquilizers every morning from now on, you’d better get another make-up artist. I won’t touch you again.’ He practically had to hold me in the chair that morning!”\n\n“On the other hand, a kind of marvelous thing happened during that three and a half hours. It served to give us a period of adjustment, going from human to ape. By the end of the make-up time, you believed, you really did, that you were an ape. You’d look in the mirror and say ‘By golly, that’s me.'”\n\nIn a 1995 interview, she recalled: “It was pretty claustrophobic, and painful to a certain extent. The only thing of me that came through were my eyeballs.”\n\nOf the many films to Kim Hunter’s credits she loved Stella more than anything else, but to her she loved ZIra and the “crazy, imaginative freedom of Planet of the Apes” (Cinefantastique Planet of the Apes issue 1972)\n\n1970 came around and she made appearances in The Young Lawyers, Bracken’s World, Mannix, and The Bold Ones: The New Doctors, In 1971 she appeared in an episode of Cannon and Gunsmoke.\n\nShe acted in Paul Zindel’s play, “And Miss Reardon Drinks a Little,” at the Hanna Theatre in Cleveland, Ohio with Julie Harris (November 8, 1971).\n\nKim Hunter with Don Ameche in Columbo: Suitable for Framing 1971.\n\nAnd In the same year, she starred in one of Columbo’s best episodes – Suitable for Framing” Directed by Hy Averback, Hunter plays the scatterbrained yet winsome aunt Edna Matthews, whose nephew Dale Kingston ( perhaps one of Columbo’s most vile murderers deliciously acted by Ross Martin at his smarmiest) murders her ex-husband in order to get his hands on his priceless art collection. Hunter is delightfully eccentric and just a bit off-center as she wanders through the episode as Dale tries to frame her for two murders.\n\nIn 1972 she starred in the cheeky episode The Late Mr. Peddington where she buys a funeral service for the husband she hasn’t pushed out the window yet! A few other television appearances include Owen Marshall, Counselor at Law, Mission: Impossible, Love, American Style, The Magician, Marcus Welby, M.D., and Police Story. Included are 2 episodes of the rare horror anthology series The Evil Touch and in 1974 she appeared on Raymond Burr’s Ironside.\n\nKim Hunter really made the round of popular television in the 1970s. And in (1973) she appeared in the Broadway revival of “The Women” with Hunter, Myrna Loy, Alexis Smith, Rhonda Fleming, and Dorothy Loudon.\n\nAnd also in 1974, the TV movie Born Innocent sent a bit of a shock wave through television sets. Linda Blair plays Chris Parker, a young girl who in her attempt to run away from her abusive home life finds herself thrown into a juvenile detention center, only to be brutalized by her sadistic peers. The show was very controversial for its depiction of Chris Parker’s brutal assault. Hunter made the bold decision to portray Blair’s mother in the film.\n\nAnother TV movie that has quite a cult following amongst us fans of 70s made-for-TV movies, is her appearance at the beginning of Buzz Kulik’s Bad Ronald, where she plays Scott Jacoby’s mother Elaine Wilby, who protects Ronald after he accidentally kills a neighborhood girl. She hides him in the house while the police search for him. But when she dies suddenly she leaves her strange son to fend for himself. A new family moves into his house, and he remains living in the walls and watches the daughters and sneaks around til he’s found out.\n\nIn (1975) she wrote an Authored autobiographical cookbook, “Loose in the Kitchen.” A whimsical cookbook with some of her favorite recipes.\n\nKim Hunter also starred in several episodes of the CBS Radio Mystery Theater during the mid-1970s.\n\nIn 1979, she appeared as First Lady Ellen Axson Wilson in the mini-series Backstairs at the White House. She made an appearance on The Rockford Files in the episode Never Send a Boy King to Do a Man’s Job. And plays the Sister Superior in the TV movie The Golden Gate Murders.\n\nHunter appeared in the (1981) Broadway play “To Grandmother’s House We Go” with Eva LeGallienne\n\nIn recognition of her experience with Planet of the Apes, Kim Hunter presented the Oscar for best makeup to Rick Baker in 1982.\n\nHunter received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series in 1980 for her work in ABC’s The Edge of Night which aired on television from April 2, 1956, to November 28, 1984.\n\nShe appeared in the awful horror/sci-fi film The Kindred in 1987 and sorry to say was in The Black Cat segment of Dario Argento and George Romero’s Two Evil Eyes in 1990.\n\nTelevision in the 1990s found her in Murder, She Wrote, Mad About You, the TV movie Bloodlines: Murder in the Family, L.A. Law, and 3 episodes of the soap As the World Turns.\n\nHunter’s last major motion picture was in Clint Eastwood’s 1997 film Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil. In it, Hunter portrayed Betty Harty, a legal secretary for real-life Savannah lawyer Sonny Seller.\n\nIn 2000, she starred as Muriel an aging mother struggling with dementia co-starring with Timothy Bottoms. Her last appearance was in the tv series The Education of Max Bickford in 2001.\n\nKim Hunter has left a full legacy of performances and memorable characters. She is very dear to my heart.\n\nDIALOGUE:\n\nRobert (Gene Lyons)- “I taught you everything there is to know about this racket..” Adelaide “Profession Robert.” Robert – “That’s what you’d like to pretend, but it is a racket, a swindle a con game as any I ever did.” Adelaide-“ I only obtain the more crude aspects of the profession from you.” Robert-“Everything and I want you to stop pushing me around.” Adelaide-“You taught me a series of Halloween tricks. Carnival mumbo jumbo… I made it pay.” Robert –“They’re still carny tricks.” Adelaide-“Science!” Robert- ‘And you took them from me…”\n\nSYNOPSIS\n\nThe Evil of Adelaide Winters was directed by Laszlo Benedek with a story and teleplay by Arthur A. Ross who first wrote it as a radio play and then later revised it as the teleplay for The Alfred Hitchcock Hour.\n\nKim Hunter is stunning and austere as the malicious mastermind, who holds little regard for men, mocks and ridicules Robert, who was initially the one who groomed her in the art of the con game. Adelaide is a skilled gaslighter, and even Robert is a casualty within her brutal sphere of influence. Hunter is flawless as the ruthless Adelaide who bares no conscience and borders on the sociopathic.\n\nGene Lyons plays Adelaide’s companion in the art of bunk, as Robert, helps set up the stage for the unsuspecting targets.\n\nThe emergence of the Occult and Spiritualist phenomena throughout Europe and America at the time and following World War I found a heightened interest in the loss, separations, and deaths caused by the war.\n\nThe extensive destruction and significant loss of life resulting from the horrors of war influenced the mournful, anguished families to seek out and try to bridge the gap between this world and the life after. Finding a ripe market, there was a surge in phony mediums and psychics who would seek to profit from the suffering of these desperate people.\n\nAt the end of WWII, Adelaide exploits the grief and loss of surviving members of families and acts as a spiritual medium, finding the names of families impacted by the war listed in newspapers and then calling on them offering her help to contact them in that ethereal plane between worlds.\n\nWe begin…\n\nAdelaide places a helmet, a gun, and a bayonet on the table, “These have become the objects of man’s faith.”\n\nMrs.Thompson urges her to try and contact her son. But Adelaide explains that contacting the departed is not easy and can’t be rushed nor is it guaranteed. Hunter is inflexible and shivery in the way she explores a woman without a twinge of conscience.\n\nWith ease and in earnest, she wears well, the disguise of a medium who seeks to aid the grieving parents. What works is her style of discipline rather than the audacity in her tone.\n\n“Only the willingness to try. I need your willingness to trust me.”\n\n“We do, we wouldn’t be here if we didn’t”- Mr. Thompson the father of a Private Harry Thompson killed in the war, seems to lack the faith that his wife so readily has.\n\n“Do I still sense some hostility in you?” As she reigns in her stringent tone –“I cannot help anyone who doesn’t want to be helped.”\n\nUsing the symbols of war she has placed on the table she explains\n\n‘These are the objects of invocation. The presence of things common to the last moments of the deceased helps in contacting the departed spirit. We shall fill this room with the kind of things that surrounded your son’s last living moments.”\n\nAdelaide in her cruelty, even with Mrs.Thompson’s unguarded protestations to see the horrible portrait of war, her cries are met with Adelaide’s callous insistence that it must be done.\n\nShe inflicts the projected slides displaying photographic images of the violent scenes from the battlefield on the Thompsons – Adelaide scoring the ritual with a record composed of the sounds of battle. “There is no deception, no magic, no fraudulent means.” As Adelaide narrates the ceremony, the room is barraged with the sounds of artillery, the screaming whistle of bombs falling to the earth, and the wind blast of explosions. She puts the Thompsons through an ordeal as she seeks to ask how he died. It is beyond sadistic.\n\nAdelaide maneuvers around Mr. Thompson (Bartlett Robinson who made notable television appearances including -The Twilight Zone, Thriller, and The Outer Limits. Additionally, and 11 episodes of the Hitchcock show, including the episode Bad Actor) skepticism and succeeds to make him a believer and by the end of her cinematic performance he asks when they can meet again.\n\nAdelaide seems pleased with herself and the art which she has mastered for making a fast buck off people like the Thompson’s pain. As they leave the house, her smug glance follows them out with a cold-hearted spirit.\n\nAdelaide –“Look at that man, he comes in despising me, and goes out like a clod. I can’t stand weak people. I can’t stand them.”\n\nRobert –“These people are different from the ones we used to work with. They have the worst unhappiness.” But Adelaide is unmoved. “Did you get all the newspapers?”\n\nUsing the lists of casualties announced by the War Department, and the potential names of new targets she tells Robert, “Only those missing in action.” She finds her next victim. Edward Porter.\n\nEnter the wealthy widower Edward Porter (John Larkin) whose son has been reported missing in the war.\n\nAdelaide tells Robert what to do. He calls Edward presenting himself as the war department he informs him that his son is dead. Bernard Herrmann’s sweeping strings help orchestrate Edward going to pieces. This has cleared the way for Adelaide to move in for the confidence game.\n\nThe scene opens with Edward reflecting on a photo album of his son on a sailboat that speaks of better times in the past. A place where Edward now dwells.\n\nAdelaide comes to see him, he at first keeps her detained, telling her he had a business meeting. She comes back with her routine declaration of her mission being as vital if not more so.\n\n“I have more than business to attend to Mr. Porter I have other people’s feelings.” Like a wounded child – “I said I’m sorry. Please sit down.”\n\nAdelaide “When I first called you I thought you said you’d want to talk and then make your decision about going ahead.” Edward “I wanted to.” Adelaide “Well, this is my third visit to discuss it. My third trip to help you decide if you wish to contact your son.”Edward “It takes time.” Adelaide “Time to admit that what I do is legitimate and worth a try. Time to admit you need my help.” Edward “To trust what you do Miss Winters would take faith. I need time to have that.”\n\n“There’s no reason to have faith until it’s proven itself… this one last hope to know the sound of him, the reality of him, you toss aside. Let me try to help you.”\n\nIn order to prolong the subterfuge in hopes of getting more money out of him, she exploits Edward’s longing for his son to materialize. So she pretends that the first attempts fail. “Will you try again.” “Whenever you wish.” “I want you to. Just one more time.” “But at my home. This is a place of the past. Distant past. Doesn’t let in the present.”\n\nEdward Porter who has been a realist all his life, begins to trust that Adelaide is sincere. Her finely honed powers of perception and influence manage to convince Edward to let her try and reach his son.\n\nHe agrees to continue with the invocation at her home. Using her phony technique that parallels a séance, she lays out the same props as before, photographs, and the sound effects that create the atmosphere of battle.\n\nEach time, he longs to get closer to his son. “Not if I can’t break through” she reels him in. “You must try, again and again.” “And if I fail?” “Then again! Until you succeed.”\n\nDesperate to reach his son he waits, convinced that she is a genuine clairvoyant. Finally, after Adelaide pleads with John to prove his love for his father, Edward hears his son’s soft zephyr-like incorporeal voice. in a phantasmal whisper “Do not lose me, father. Do not lose me.” Adelaide collapses.\n\nThe bait has been cast into the waters, and now Edward is hooked. He begins to arrive earlier and earlier to their meetings, and he starts to show warmth and devotion to Adelaide.\n\nPeering through the curtain, Robert reports to Adelaide –“He’s out there again. For a half hour or so. He wasn’t out there I let our last client in.”Adelaide “His appointment is next.” Robert“No, it isn’t he’s a couple of hours early. I don’t like it.” She puffs on her cigarette, dismissing it. Adelaide “Well, he has nothing else to do.” Robert “Yeah, but this has been going on for over a week.”Adelaide says mockingly “Only because this is where he’s found a greater happiness.”\n\nHe interrogates her – does she have personal feelings for him? She insists Robert answers the door, he is furious. Edward enters and she switches it on, “I’m flattered that you’ve come so early.” “Well to see you as well”, he says with affection in his voice. She grabs his arm “We’ve been having wonderful success haven’t we? I’m always delighted when the gift I have is successful. It’s a good feeling.”\n\nEdward tells her “You’re a fine person.” “I try to be. Sometimes I’m not. Sometimes I fail myself. That’s when astral communication is impossible. When I concentrate only on myself.” “You’re a rare human being.” “Why thank you.” “I recognized it” “How?” “They’re truly aware of other people’s needs.” “ I’ve tried to be a help to everyone.” “Maybe too many.” “Why too many? How could I possibly help too many?… You’re acting unusual today Mr. Porter. Is something wrong?”\n\nEdward insists on beginning with the communication but she tells him she offers her services but does not give anyone license to tell her what to do. Not even from him. “ I can’t stand you spending so much time with others.” “But it’s my work.”\n\nHe offers to give her a lot of money. But there are only so many hours in a day and it exhausts her. With desperation in his voice, he tells her that he wants all her time. At first, she tells him it’s impossible, the expense alone, and she’s never worked that way before. He is finally at the mercy of Adelaide’s control and mesmerism, he must be with his son. He must.\n\nVery shrewdly she plants the seed that they would be interrupted by other people who seek their own comfort from her. So, she must come and stay at his home. She pretends to be flustered by the idea. Well played. “But Bain my assistant.” “Well, why do you want him?” “Because he’s always been with me.” “Bring him. Both of you. Come… live in my home. It’s a huge house. Since my wife died years ago. Since she died and now my son… I need your help. You can bring my son to me. You can. Please, Please I need you.” And of course, she agrees.\n\nAdelaide arrives at Edward’s magnificent house and moves into a suite that Edward has prepared for her.\n\nAs Robert unpacks in his meager room above the garage the two argue. She tells him to hang in there, so they can get what they want. “So you can get what you want.” “Alright, if you choose.” “Well it’s true isn’t it.” “I don’t owe you anything.” “We stopped being more than business associates a long time ago.” “You did. I didn’t.” “ I still like you. You know that.” “Yeah, but not enough huh.” She caresses him, he grabs her and they kiss, Adelaide giving him just enough to ask him, “Help me get what I want. And you’ll see we’ll be comfortable for the rest of our lives.” “Together?” “Maybe.” “For good?” “For a while. At least for a while.”\n\nRobert joins her moving into a room above the garage which will be the cont"
