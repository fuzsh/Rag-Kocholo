        "text": "Saul W. Issroff\n\n1976 Sidney James, actor (Lavander Hill Mob, Carry On), dies at 65.Sid James\n\n(May 8, 1913 - June 26, 1976) b. Newcastle, Natal, South Africa, ) was a\n\nfilm and television actor.\n\nSid James (born Sidney Joel Cohen) grew up in Doornfontein , Johannesburg\n\nin a very eastern European Lithuanian origin Jewish community. He managed a\n\nvery good Cockney accent as an actor in later years. see\n\nhttp://www.carryonline.com/carry/sid.html\n\nSid James was a South African-born Jew whose parents worked in the music\n\nhall business. James had joined a South African regiment of the British Army\n\nin 1939 and soon became a producer in its entertainment unit. As such he was\n\ntypical of a generation of British performers and writers who learned their\n\ntrade while in the Armed Forces. After the service, James arrived in London\n\non Christmas Day 1946 looking to make a start in acting. His grizzled face\n\nmeant that he became typecast as minor gangsters in his early film\n\nappearances. His career success came when he transformed himself into a\n\nquintessential Londoner, an ordinary bloke, who drew sympathy >from his\n\naudience despite playing a rascal\n\nin many of his roles.\n\nHe is buried in Golders Green Crematorium, where other humourists of Jewish\n\norigin, who died of coronary thromboses, e.g. Peter Sellers, also have\n\ntheir ashes scattered as fertiliser!\n\nAnother Jewish origin actor, Laurence Harvey was born October 1, 1928 in\n\nJoniskis, Lithuania. His real name was Laruschka Mischa Skikne, which he\n\nchanged when his parents emigrated to South Africa to escape persecution for\n\ntheir Jewish faith. At 15, he debuted on stage with the Johannesburg\n\nRepertory Theater, but later he joined the army and served until the end of\n\nWWII. He went to England after the war and enrolled at the Royal Academy of\n\nDramatic Art, staying there three months before joining a Manchester\n\nrepertory company where he soon began to play leads. He was married three\n\ntimes first to Margaret Leighton in 1957, then to Joan Cohn in 1968 and then\n\nto Pauline Stone in 1972. They had one daughter named Domino. After his\n\nbreakthrough film Room at the Top in 1959, he worked steadily until his\n\ndeath >from stomach cancer at his home in Hampstead, London, in 1973.\n\nhttp://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&GRid=6304843&pt=Laurence%20Harvey\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy as he appears to be buried in Santa\n\nBarabara!\n\nfor cremations and burials see\n\nhttp://www.findagrave.com\n\nSaul Issroff\n\nLondon"
