        "text": "Post by teleadm on\n\nAs a young girl she had an urge or flair for acting, Becoming a star at early age at Birmingham (England) theatres, since she quit school, at age 15. Whatever she learned at that early age she, would later become a star at Old Vic under the guidance of Sir Ralph Richardson, and later earn her two Tony Awards on Broadway, Separate Tables 1958 and The Night of the Iguana 1962, and a Emmy Award in a televised version of Hamlet 1970.\n\nNot bad for a little girl from Barnt Green, Worcestershire, England who was taken from us too soon because of multiple sclerosis, that was born 100 years ago.\n\nMargaret Leighton (1922–1976)\n\nHer movie and later televised career might not always be reflecting her real talent\n\nMovie debut as Cedric Hardwicke's hardnoses daughter falling for Robert Donat in The Winslow Boy 1948\n\nIn Nöel Coward's The Astonished Heart 1950\n\nHelping Bulldog Drummond (Walter Pidgeon) in Calling Bulldog Drummond 1951\n\nWith Celia Johnson in British Christmas classic The Holly and The Ivy 1952\n\nWith Laurence Harvey (whom she later married) in The Good Die Young 1954\n\nAmerican movie debut in The Sound and the Fury 1959.\n\nAs Peter Sellers wife in Waltz of the Toreadors 1962\n\nOn Broadway in Tennessee William's Night of the Iguana in the role played by Deborah Kerr in the movie version, also far right it's Bette Davis as Maxine, played by Ava Gardner in the movie version.\n\nAs wife of Presidental candidate (Henry Fonda) in The Best Man 1964\n\nIn John Ford's last movie 7 Women 1966\n\nShe didn't shy away from appearing on television, including Ben Casey, The Girl from U.N.C.L.E and Dr Kildare that even gave her an Emmy Award.\n\nIn 1971, she was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but didn't let it slow her down for quite some time but ended in sit-down roles.\n\nThe Manipulative Mrs. Maudsley in The Go-Between 1971 earned her only Oscar nomination.\n\nAs Madame Orloff in Amicus From Beyond the Grave 1974\n\nA sit-down role as Miss Havisham in Great Expectations 1974 television version.\n\nSpace 1999, a popular TV space series, a British.Italian co-production, was her acting farewell. 1975.\n\nOur old site mentions another two apparances, that was probably made at earlier dates.\n\nBesides being married to Laurence Harvey, she was also married to publisher Max Reinhardt and actor Michael Wilding, before and after Harvey.\n\nOne of the oddest pairings ever, Margaret Leighton and Milton Berle as a married couple in The Loved One 1965\n\nThe above is not a complete bio of her movies, films and theatre work, just a teaser.\n\nThanks for watching!\n\nOpinions of all kinds are as always welcome!\n\nPost by timshelboy on\n\nAn elegant patrician beauty, she brought more class than most of her movies deserved. She did not achieve the star status on film she did on stage, commanding top billing only twice in minor films(THE TECKMAN MYSTERY and THE PASSIONATE STRANGER - the latter merited a \"RING UP AND COMPLAIN\" rating from the Sunday Times who commented that her \"idea of acting here seems to be twiddling with her specs\" )\n\nI have seen around two dozen of her movies\n\nI'd \"recommend\" half a dozen.\n\nTHE GOOD DIE YOUNG\n\nTHE SOUND AND THE FURY (a great prformance in a role declined by Deborah Kerr)\n\nWith Yul Brynner\n\nTHE BEST MAN\n\nTHE LOVED ONE\n\nTHE GO BETWEEN (her best movie)\n\nwith Julie Christie and Dominic Guard\n\nFRANKENSTEIN THE TRUE STORY"
