        "text": "(2 of 4)\n\nRobert Goldman and Glenn Paxton, who four seasons ago adapted Pride and Prejudice into First Impressions, have completed an original musical, Hurrah, Boys, Hurrah! Austro-Hungarian soldiers, oddly enough, took part in the American Civil War, and the show centers around a Union soldier and the daughter of a Hungarian officer, garrisoned in St. Louis in 1861 (spring). Another original musical is A Girl to Remember, starring Carol Burnett as a Hollywood script girl in the '30s, book and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green (May 26).\n\nRugantino is something that Producer Alexander H. Cohen found in Romean Italian musical smash about a Roman ne'er-do-well of the early 19th century who is unjustly accused of murder. Untranslated, the production will feature subtitles under the stage (Feb. 8). Another bit of musical miscellany is the long-postponed Broadway debut of Rick Besoyan, who wrote Little Mary Sunshine, the Oklahoma! of off Broadway. Another spoof of the operettas of the '20s, this one is called The Student Gypsy, or The Prince of Liederkranz, starring Eileen Brennan, who was Little Mary (Sept. 30).\n\n∙COMEDIES: British humor sometimes fails to function cisatlantically, but five British comedies are having a go at Broadway this season. Semi-Detached (Oct. 7) is a mad knitting of woolly middle-class values in English suburbia. Enid Bagnold's The Chinese Prime Minister, not yet produced in London, is about an old actress facing assorted personal problems, including a husband who turns up after a 29-year absence, and stars Margaret Leighton (January). Greatly popular on the West End last year were The Private Ear and The Public Eyetwo thematically related one-acters by Peter Shaffer, author of Five Finger Exercise (Oct. 9). Eric Portman stars in a British sex comedy called All in Good Time (Nov. 23). And Claudette Colbert and Cyril Ritchard open Sept. 18 in The Irregular Verb to Love, about a sweet London lady who keeps blowing up furrier shops because she loves animals.\n\nJean Kerr's Poor Richard opens after Christmas, soon after the arrival of her sixth child. It is set in New York and concerns a British poet and an American girl. The Time of the Barracudas stars Elaine Stritch and Laurence Harvey as a pair of murderers who are married and are trying to bump each other off (November). Eddie Mayehoff and Dody Goodman are a union leader and a lady manufacturer in Howard Teichmann's A Rainy Day in Newark (Oct. 22). Dore Schary will direct Larry Parks in Love and Kisses, about teenage marriage (Dec. 16). And Mike Nichols will stage Barefoot in the Park, Neil (Come Blow Your Horn) Simon's new comedy about a young couple in Greenwich Village (Oct. 23)."
