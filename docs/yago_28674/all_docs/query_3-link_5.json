        "text": "Film actor Laurence Harvey was married three times, but he was actually a gay man who was trying to get the public off the scent of his true nature.\n\nSo let's discuss him\n\nFrank Sinatra was particularly vicious in his opinion of Harvey. Sinatra was aware of Harvey's sexuality but did not mind, passing it off as a joke: “He has the handicaps of being a homo, a Jew, and a Polock*, so people should go easy on him.”\n\nHarevy did not get along with many of his female co-stars. Jane Fonda, Lee Remick, Shirley MacLaine, Kim Novak, Capucine, all have singled him out as the one co-star they did not like working with.\n\nAn 18-year old Joan Collins begged boyfriend Laurence Harvey to deflower her, but he turned her down, saying \"No, you mustn't do this—you're not ready.\" He took her to a party and introduced her to Hermione Baddeley, who sneered, \"If this is the new Jean Simmons, as Larry's told me, Jean has nothing to worry about—you haven't got her looks or her talent.\" When Joan discovered that he lived with this \"old bag\" she ran for the hills. She had lost any interest in him after that.\n\nR11 I like Hermione Baddeley, but she had to be one of Hollywood's ugliest fag hags at the time. Harvey was looking for a mother figure, but I guess no one ever told him you didn't have to fuck her or live with her to have that.\n\nMany consider The Caterpillar to be the best Night Gallery episode of all time. Rod Serling did an interesting role reversal in his teleplay. In the original story, the married man wanted to use \"The Caterpillar\" not the Harvey character. To be honest, it might have been Harvey's best performance. He added a film quality to the episode that was added by the all British cast.\n\nThis piece was too good to pass up. Liz drove Harvey crazy:\n\nWith her famous sapphire-blue eyes glistening with tears, and her beautiful face a picture of concern, Elizabeth Taylor swept into the home of actor Laurence Harvey and prepared to say her final goodbyes to him as he lay dying of stomach cancer at the age of just 45.\n\nFlying from Hollywood to London to see her friend was a touching gesture, but Harvey was apprehensive about Taylor's visit on that autumn day in 1973. In the 13 years since they starred together in the film Butterfield 8, she had so drained him with her long and dramatic telephone calls concerning her rocky relationships and many physical agonies that he felt he couldn't handle her in his weakened state.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate is one of my favorite movies. I especially love Frank and Janet Leigh in it. They both were going through real pain in private and it shows on the screen. Certainly one Frank's best acting roles. Didnt he suppress this one for years after the JFK assassination? Maybe that's why I didn't see it until I was an adult. Or was that Suddenly?\n\nR32, yes, Frank and Janet were great, but I can't believe you mention The Manchurian Candidate's cast without noting Angela Lansbury's brilliant performance.\n\nBTW, R32 (or anyone who knows), am I crazy or is there a VERY odd scene on a train in which Frank and Janet meet at the end of a train car and share a cigarette or something and Janet says something really bizarre about having worked on the railroad (as though she were actually an undercover Korean spy who had tricked Sinatra into thinking she was a beautiful blonde American woman). It always struck me as truly bizarre because the comment was never picked up on again throughout the film. Am I completely misremembering? Anyone know what the hell I'm talking about?\n\nSinatra was po'd at Harvey because his then wife Mia Farrow was making a movie with him in London. The director of the film died while filming and Mia refused to fly back to Frank and finish the picture. For some reason Sinatra blamed Harvey. Movie mags at the time hinted at Larry's gayness by saying he was one man Frank had no worries about stealing Mia.\n\nThis was posted on the Lana Wood thread, but I thought it was most appropriate here too:\n\nWagner is one of the hottest men I've ever seen up close in my life and it appears that he's keeping himself in great shape. I would have hit that hard in the day. An old timer in Palm Springs claims he caught Wager and Laurence Harvey fucking in the men's area of the Aqua Caliente Spa back in the day. No idea if its true but he swears by it and the imagery is pretty hot."
