        "text": "Opens with four men in a car, about to pull off a heist, before retracing the steps that lead each man to this point. We don't realize it in that opening scene, but one of these men is much worse than others. While Mike, Joe and Eddie are all portrayed as fundamentally good men down on their luck, Miles 'Rave' Ravenscourt is an utter cad - to use the parlance of the times. A rakish, unprincipled toyboy to a rich heiress, Rave hatches a plan to knock off a post office out of sheer japery, roping in his accomplices knowing they'll be easy marks, each being so desperate for cash.\n\nDelving into the back stories of the four men takes…\n\nThere’s something of the mid-80s James Spader to young Laurence Harvey: he’s louche, remorseless, and unrelentingly seductive of anyone in his path. And, here, there’s at least the suggestion that his spoiled rich kid living off of his wife is gay. The way he watches boxing is framed erotically, and there seems to be more about him than his general worthlessness as a human being that embarrasses his posh father.\n\nElsewhere, Gloria Grahame is perfectly cast as a barely relevant actress who thinks of herself as a huge star. Her breathiness and strange manner have never been more suited to a role, and poor John Ireland as her husband has all he can handle just to stand next to her and survive.…\n\nA soapy crime-don't-pay melodrama dressed up as a crime thriller. Note that the thrills are a long time in coming; the first part of this Lewis Gilbert film is spent on exposition about what brings four strangers, none of them criminals, to the point of taking part in a heist in London. One of the worst-planned heists I've ever seen, by the way.\n\nThat exposition explains the dire straits each of the men are in, and frankly that could have been done in half the time and we wouldn't have been any poorer for it. The first hour is basically a soap.\n\nPartial redemption comes in the last half-hour as events ratchet up. The heist and its aftermath are dramatic…\n\nGlancing through Lewis Gilbert's filmography before watching The Good Die Young, I realised that he could actually have become one of my favourite directors without me realising it.\n\nThen I actually watched The Good Die Young and realised I may have been a wee bit hasty.\n\nThis should really work a lot better than it does but Gilbert has different plans for it than the obvious. He spends over an hour on the various relationships of the four blokes who end up carrying out an impromptu heist to solve a variety of money troubles. And none of those relationships are anywhere near interesting enough to require more than lip service.\n\nThere's an 80 minute, fast-paced crime B-pic fighting to get…\n\nSomething about the Korean War lurks in the shadows of this film. Shooting started about 2 months after the fighting ended on 27 July 1953 when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed. Three of the principal characters were involved and the forth served in the ring.\n\nThey all seemed a bit shell shocked (or as the euphemism of the time termed it combat fatigue or battle fatigue for PTSD). There was also a bit of discussion how those who stayed home from the war benefited and took all they could get. In any case, quite an interesting film with great acting, cinematography, and music - especially at the opening credits - by French composer Georges Auric, protégé of Erik Satie.…\n\nFour men, all desperately in need of cash, decide to rob a mail van carrying £100,000.\n\nAnd the four men are Richard Basehart, a former GI, whose pregnant wife is being emotionally blackmailed by her mother to remain in England, John Ireland, an American airman, whose actress wife is having an affair with her co-star, resulting in him going AWOL, Stanley Baker, a washed-up boxer with no money and a recently amputated hand and finally Laurence Harvey, a philandering playboy whose wife and father have both cut him off.\n\nAnd if that cast isn't good enough for you, there's Joan Collins as Basehart's wife, the wonderful Gloria Grahame as Ireland's missus and Robert Morley as Harvey's father.\n\nBasically it's a…"
