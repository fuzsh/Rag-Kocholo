        "text": "Eric Portman\n\nBiography\n\nEric Portman – the popular film star and theatre actor – was born Eric Harold Portman at 71 Chester Road, Akroydon, Halifax, the son of Matthew Portman.\n\nThere is some confusion amongst filmographers about his exact birthdate: most record it as 13th July 1903, but this is incorrect.\n\nThe documents show that\n\nEric was born on 13th July 1901\n\nHis name was Eric Harold Portman\n\nHe was baptised at All Souls' Church, Haley Hill [18th November 1903] along with his younger brother Frank Leslie\n\nHis death certificate gives his name as Eric Harrison Portman – Harrison was his mother's maiden name\n\nThe council erected a Blue Plaque in his memory at 20 Chester Road, Akroydon which shows the incorrect date of birth, 1903. This may be a consequence of house renumbering as he was born at 71 Chester Road.\n\nHe was best known for his portrayal of strong, sensitive men – often with a psychotic tendency – and his firm, commanding voice made him ideal for his rôles in war movies. He was rarely the ladies' man or the lover.\n\nAfter leaving Rishworth School, Eric went to work for a short time in the Halifax shop of his father – Matthew Portman.\n\nIn 1922, he started work as a salesman in the menswear department at Marshall & Snelgrove's department store in Leeds\n\nHe was a member of the Halifax Opera Society and the King Cross Amateur Dramatic Society\n\nEric was a friend of Wilfred Pickles and Wilfred's brother, Arthur.\n\nIn 192?, the actor-manager Henry Baynton came to play at the Theatre Royal in Halifax. Eric joined the company.\n\nIn 1923, he joined Robert Courtneidge's Shakespeare Company while it was playing at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. In 1924, he made his professional stage debut when played his first speaking part with the company at the Victoria Theatre, Sunderland.\n\nIn 1924, he made his first appearance on the London stage at the Savoy Theatre as Antipholus of Syracuse in The Comedy of Errors.\n\nHe was engaged by Lilian Baylis for the Old Vic Company, and made a reputation as a noted Shakespearian actor, appearing as Romeo, Charles Surface, Edmund in King Lear, Arcite in The Two Noble Kinsmen and Strength in Everyman\n\nOn 14th February, 1928, he played Romeo at the reopening of the Old Vic in London.\n\nIn July 1932, he played John Worthing in The Importance of Being Earnest. The cast included Donald Finlay and Sybil Holroyd. This was the last production at the Theatre Royal, Halifax.\n\nHe had great success in the theatre in London & New York, and from 1935, he appeared in many films. His only Hollywood appearance was a minor rôle in The Prince and the Pauper.\n\nIn 1936, he signed a contract with Warner Brothers in the US – though nothing came of it.\n\nHe claimed to have met Ribbentrop in 1937. This meeting was the basis of the play Dinner with Ribbentrop.\n\nFrom the 1940s, he lived in a cottage which he had bought in Cornwall, with partner & fellow actor Knox Laing.\n\nIn 1942, he was voted one of the top 10 money-making stars in the British film industry.\n\nIn 1945, he won the Ellen Terry Award for Best Actor.\n\nIn 1948, he was voted one of the top 10 money-making stars in the British cinema.\n\nOn 5th November 1953, he came to Halifax to open Mollett's store in Silver Street.\n\nOn Sunday 11th March 1956, he brought a London production of Separate Tables – which Terence Rattigan had written specially for Eric – to raise funds to save the Grand Theatre, Halifax. Along with Eric, the cast included Margaret Leighton, Phyllis Neilson-Terry, Beryl Mason, and Basil Henson. Members of the audience included Robert Morley, Margaret Rutherford, and Laurence Harvey.\n\nIn 1957, he was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actor (Dramatic) for his Broadway performance in Separate Tables.\n\nExcept for short visits, he never returned to Halifax. In response to a question during an interview for the BBC Talkabout series in 1965, he said\n\nWhat is there to go back to Halifax for?\n\nHe was a quiet, retiring man – possibly because of his homosexuality, in an era which was much less open than today and when this was a criminal offence.\n\nIt has been said that one of his lovers was killed by the Mau Mau whilst in Kenya.\n\nIn 1968, ill-health – a heart condition – forced him to retire while appearing in a production of John Galsworthy's Justice.\n\nIn 1969, Terrence Ladlow made a number of 16 mm educational films for schools. One of these was The Brontë Sisters, and Ladlow, seeking a Yorkshire voice, asked Portman to record the commentary on the film. Portman agreed and recorded the commentary at studios in Soho Square, just three days before he died.\n\nA life-long bachelor, Eric died at his cottage Penpoll in St Veep, Cornwall on 7th December 1969\n\n© Malcolm Bull 2021\n\nRevised 11:48 / 16th June 2021 / 9000\n\nPage Ref: P112_2"
