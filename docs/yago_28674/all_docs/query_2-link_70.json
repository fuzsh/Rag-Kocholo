        "text": "Gibraltar is well known as a popular destination for weddings. Hollywood stars Lawrence Harvey and Margaret Leighton were one of the first high profile couples to say I do in Gibraltar. More recently famous people married on the Rock include John Lennon and Yoko Ono, and James Bond star Sir Sean Connery has even done it twice !\n\nGetting married in Gibraltar is easy and visitors can choose from a variety of locations.\n\nAs Gibraltar is so popular a place for getting married, it is wise to plan well in advance and book an appointment with the registrar to ensure everything goes well for you.\n\nLocal marriage law does not contain any residential requirements, and so, it is a simple procedure. A Gibraltar marriage is recognised worldwide.\n\nRecent legislation permits the marriage registrar to marry couples outside the registry office, if requested, although the registry is an attractive location with a garden for photos.\n\nToday literally thousands of couples per year select to come to marry on The Rock. Only about a third are from the UK, with the remainder coming from the United States and multiple other countries all over the world.\n\nEntry Requirements - Passport Validity\n\nYou must hold a valid passport to enter Gibraltar. Your passport must be valid for the proposed duration of your stay. No additional period of validity beyond this is required. However, it is always sensible to have a short period of extra validity on your passport in case of any unforeseen delays to your departure. You do not have to wait until your old passport expires to apply to renew it. Any time left on your old passport when you apply will be added to your new passport, up to a maximum of nine months. For passport applications in the UK, you should apply to the Identity and Passport Service.\n\nIf you or your partner do not hold a EU passport and requre a visa to enter the UK be aware that it does not cover entry to Gibraltar and you must apply to the Gibraltar authorities for permission to enter.\n\nTel: + (350) 200 51725 or 59832 Fax: + (350) 200 43053\n\nEmail: immigration.csro@gibraltar.gov.gi\n\nFull details of the official Gibraltar Registry Office requirements, operating times, costs and a listing of Gibraltars hotels, airlines, UK tour operators and wedding services are available through the Gibraltar Tourist Board www.gibraltar.gov.uk or by calling 020 7836 0777.\n\nThe documents on this site contain information about the requirements and contact details of sites etc however please contact the official Gibraltar Government offices as things can change and we accept no responsibility for errors.\n\nAlthough there is a Hindu Temple in Gibraltar it is not registered as a place of worship under the Marriage Act."
