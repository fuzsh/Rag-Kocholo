Spouses Lewis Casson and Sybil Thorndyke played the Macbeths, Henry V and Chorus/Katherine, Katherine and Petruchio, and Henry VIII and Catherine or Aragon--and wouldn't those have been interesting evenings at Chez Casson/Thorndyke--in and around London in the 1920's and 30's. They also appeared as Waffles and Marina in Olivier's UNCLE VANYA in the early 1960's at Chichester and the National Theatre. Paul Scofield and Joy Parker played Oliver and Celia at Stratford in 1946 or 47, and Michael Redgrave and Rachael Kempson played Lear and Regan at Stratford in 1953. I think they also played Navarre and the Princess of France at the Old Vic somewhere around 1936. Descending for a moment into gossip and innuendo, Redgrave was said to be having an affair with Edith Evans when they played Rosalind and Orlando in the late 30's and Lawrence Harvey and Margaret Leighton were similarly linked in the same roles at Stratford in 1952. Although if we get into couples who were involved with each other while playing Shakespearean pairs, we could well be here till next Christmas. Finally, if I remember correctly that Charles Laughton was married to Elsa Lanchester, the two of them played Prospero and Ariel at the Old Vic in 1934. Laughton also played Macbeth and Angelo that year, but I believe Flora Robson was his Lady M. and Isabella. In the US and Canada, Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy played Titania and Bottom for the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario in the late 60's or early 70's, and George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst played Antony and Cleopatra for Joe Papp at the NY Shakespeare Festival. There are also several husband/wife teams active in regional and festival Shakespeare all over the US.

So, what's the point? _______________________________________________________________ S H A K S P E R: The Global Shakespeare Discussion List Hardy M.
