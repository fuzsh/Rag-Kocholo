        "text": "Born 100 years ago today, the divine English actress Margaret Leighton (1922-76).\n\nLeighton was only 53 when she died and suffered from MS in the years prior to that. Her early demise, and the fact that she generally played character parts rather than leads in films, go toward explaining why she isn’t better remembered as one of the leading actresses of her generation (as she might be) in spite of distinguished stage and screen careers in both the U.S. and U.K. One of her better known American roles, the wife of a Presidential candidate in Gore Vidal’s The Best Man (1964) sheds light on her status as a character player. Though beautiful, glamorous, and cultured, she possessed a highly-strung nature often described as “neurotic”, “odd” and “eccentric”, even more so that Vivien Leigh. This quality and perhaps her illness seems to have aged her early; she would have been about 40 in The Best Man, but seemed much older. Part of that is acting, no doubt, but she was also cast in the role of Henry Fonda’s wife for a reason. He was some 17 years her senior, but they seemed age appropriate for one another.\n\nLeighton had been a professional actress since the late ’30s, joining the Birmingham Repertory Company when she was only 15. Considered a prodigy, she was soon acting in great classical roles, useful experience when she joined the Old Vic under Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson in 1944, where she continued to play in Shakespeare, Sheridan, Chekov, and the like. She was also associated with contemporary playwrights. Her screen debut had been in an adaptation of Terrence Rattigan’s The Winslow Boy (1948); she later went on to win a Tony for her performance in the Broadway premiere of that playwright’s Separate Tables (1956). She won a second Tony in the original production of Tennessee Williams’ Night of the Iguana (1962), and was in the original production of his evening of two one acts Slapstick Tragedy four years later. Leighton was also in the original West End production of T.S. Eliot’s The Cocktail Party in 1950."
