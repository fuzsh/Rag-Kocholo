        "text": "Gypsy. In this stripsnorter of a show adapted from the Broadway musical abstracted from Gypsy Rose Lee’s autobiography, Rosalind Russell is marvelous as a stage mother whose daughter can’t act, but is pretty good at takeoffs.\n\nPeriod of Adjustment. Jim Hutton and Jane Fonda are fun in this sappy screen version of Tennessee Williams’ “serious comedy” of postmarital relations.\n\nII Grido. A mournful little movie, made in 1957, in which Italy’s Michelangelo Antonioni first fumbles with the material he later handled so powerfully in L’Avventura.\n\nBilly Budd. Herman Melville’s didactic tale has been transformed into a vivid, frightening, deeply affecting film, and for this the credit belongs principally to Britain’s Peter Ustinov, who directed the picture, helped write the script, and plays one of the leading roles.\n\nThe Manchurian Candidate. In this self-consciously “different” movie about a posthypnotic political assassination, Laurence Harvey’s brains are washed, tumble-dried and dyed Red in a Chinese P.W. camp, and he ends up stalking a U.S. presidential candidate with murderous intent.\n\nPhaedra. Melina Mercouri purrs, snarls and shrieks in this modern-day version of an old Greek myth. Raf Vallone, as her ship-tycoon husband, is healthily Hellenic in a role with obvious overtones of Onas sisism. Only Tony Perkins seems somewhat less than believable as Vallone’s stepson.\n\nLong Day’s Journey into Night. Director Sidney Lumet and a generally effective cast (Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards Jr., Dean Stockwell) have translated the truest and the greatest of Eugene O’Neill’s plays into one of the year’s finest films.\n\nDivorce—Italian Style. This wickedly hilarious lesson in how to break up a marriage in divorceless Italy stars Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian smoothie who sheds his unwanted wife in the only way the law seems to allow: he provides her with a lover, catches them together, shoots her dead. But then . . .\n\nTELEVISION\n\nWed., Nov. 21\n\nN.Y. Philharmonic Young People’s Concert (CBS, 7:30-8:30 p.m.).* “The Sound of a Hall,” conducted and narrated by Leonard Bernstein, explores the general relationship of acoustics to music and the particular sound of Lincoln Center’s new Philharmonic Hall.\n\nThurs., Nov. 22\n\nThanksgiving Parade (CBS and NBC, 10 a.m.-noon).

Smith narrates “India: The Troubled Giant,” a documentary examination of the current border war and its effects on the country’s politics and people.\n\nTHEATER On Broadway\n\nBeyond the Fringe. Four high-IQ British imps skewer cliches and milk sacred cows for irreverent merriment. The chief scholar-clown, Dr. Jonathan Miller, is a droll, gravity-defying pixy for whom a new vocabulary of humor will have to be invented.\n\nTchin-Tchin is a strange and oddly affecting play in which an Italo-American contractor and a proper Englishwoman are thrown into each other’s company because their respective spouses are having an affair. Margaret Leighton and Anthony Quinn touch the playgoer’s nerve ends, crazybones, and heart strings with deceptive ease and authority.\n\nMr. President, with Robert Ryan in the title role and Nanette Fabray as First Lady, is a taste-exempt musical that is bulging with more than $2,600,000 in advance-ticket-sale swag. The patrons of its 385 theater parties (largely benefit affairs) may redefine playgoing for charity as “painful giving.”\n\nWho’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, by Edward Albee, is an annihilating war of love-hatred fought between a middle-aged history professor and his wife, in which a younger guest couple are also savaged.\n\nArthur Hill, as the professor, raises acting to the level of genius, and Uta Hagen, as his wife, is a virtuoso Medusa.\n\nThe Affair makes a sleepy British university common room crackle with the charges and countercharges of a courtroom trial. Adapted from the novel by C. P. Snow, this drama is concerned with justice for a man whose personality is revolting, and whose politics are scarcely less so.\n\nBOOKS\n\nBest Reading\n\nTale for the Mirror, by Hortense Cal-isher.
