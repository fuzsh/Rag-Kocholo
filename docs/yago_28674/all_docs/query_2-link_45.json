It's hard to imagine Sinatra tolerating a fellow performer who was, shall we say, difficult.\n\nI checked my Sinai biog of Harvey and my Kaplan on Frank.\n\nNot much detail but seems they were friendly from MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (62)days,Sinatra believing Harvey to be talented and Harvey \"venerating\" Sinatra (one of Harvey's most treasured possessions was a gift from Frank of a photo of Sinatra with Mia Farrow).\n\nIt looks like there was a falling out circa Harvey and Farrow appearing in A DANDY IN ASPIC released in 1968, where Harvey exploited his love/sex scenes with Farrow in publicity junkets to promote the movie. And spent a lot of time being papped grooving away off set in trendy nightclubs with Farrow. Sinatra was jealous when he saw photos of these nights out in the celeb pages....even though privately he thought Harvey was gay (and had nicknamed him \"Ladyboy\"). And was there a delay (Director Anthony Mann died and Harvey took over I think?)....... which meant Farrow couldn't appear in THE DETECTIVE opposite hubby? (Jacqueline Bisset replaced Farrow and Sinatra consoled himself with screen wife Lee Remick according to Kaplan). And Mia was then at liberty to do some horror movie....\n\nFor balance I think we should note that the Newmans liked him."
