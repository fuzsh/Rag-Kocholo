        "text": "CELEBRITIES BORN ON THIS DAY: Fred Savage, 48; Jack White, 49; Tom Hanks, 68; Jimmy Smits, 69.\n\nHappy Birthday: Staying calm is the ticket to positive change. Refuse to let the drama happening around you take over. You owe it to yourself and the ones you love to be a take-charge person who stands up for what’s right. Be original, humble and thrifty; everything else will fall into place. Put logic and reason first; be a leader, not a follower, and you’ll make progress. Your numbers are 4, 10, 21, 29, 33, 38, 42.\n\nARIES (March 21-April 19): Physical activity will jump-start your day by easing stress and encouraging you to turn whatever task you take on into a memorable encounter. Be original when faced with challenges, and you’ll find a way to overcome any obstacle. Have fun and explore the possibilities. 5 stars\n\nTAURUS (April 20-May 20): Avoid conversations with negative people or bullies. Focus on what you want to achieve. Do things your way and take responsibility. A personal change will turn out better than anticipated. If you’re going to get ahead, talk less and do more. 2 stars\n\nGEMINI (May 21-June 20): Expand your interests and participate in events that offer hope. Pay attention to how you present yourself, and you’ll get the opportunity to take on a leadership position. However, take on only what you can handle. Leave yourself ample time to complete domestic responsibilities. 4 stars\n\nCANCER (June 21-July 22): You may crave change, but set a budget before you begin. Don’t let anyone talk you into something you don’t need or can’t do yourself. Use your skills and choose your path wisely. When uncertainty plays a role, take a break and rethink your strategy. 3 stars\n\nLEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Think big but start small. Putting a long-term plan in place will give you the wiggle room to reach your target while maintaining your budget. Give yourself a break to regenerate and grow. Let your intuition take over. 3 stars\n\nVIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Consider your next move. Spontaneity will meet with opposition; review information, do more research and regroup. Emotions will surface if you engage in a heated conversation with someone who doesn’t share your beliefs. 3 stars\n\nLIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Pay attention and put your energy into something mentally and emotionally enriching. Refuse to let physical or professional setbacks drag you down. Turn things around with a positive attitude and a desire to learn something new, and proceed in a direction that excites you. 3 stars\n\nSCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Proceed with caution. You may crave change, but consider the cost before participating in a venture. Financial or legal partnerships require more thought, patience and intuition to avoid loss or disappointment. Focus on personal gain and growth. 4 stars\n\nSAGITTARIUS (Nov. 22-Dec. 21): Keep an open mind, closed wallet and tabs on what’s possible. Use intelligence to sort through matters, and do your best to approach each situation with a positive attitude. Arguing will set you back. Protect your reputation and cash by keeping your thoughts and intentions to yourself. 2 stars\n\nCAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Change what’s necessary. Additional expenses will lead to emotional stress and uncertainty. Pay attention to where your money goes and to worthwhile investments. A partnership can save you time and money and stabilize your life if you compromise. Romance is on the rise. 5 stars\n\nAQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Share your feelings and intentions. Don’t let anger set in when patience is necessary to resolve issues between you and what you want to pursue. Adjust your surroundings to accommodate your plans, and you’ll find the road to happiness you seek. 3 stars\n\nPISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Consider what’s necessary and let go of what isn’t. Balance, integrity and fair play will help you avoid the pitfalls of overindulgence and making promises you cannot keep. Look inward and offer your best to those you love by taking better care of yourself. 3 stars\n\nBirthday Baby: You are energetic, trendsetting and persuasive. You are persistent and open-minded.\n\n1 star: Avoid conflicts; work behind the scenes. 2 stars: You can accomplish, but don’t rely on others. 3 stars: Focus and you’ll reach your goals. 4 stars: Aim high; start new projects. 5 stars: Nothing can stop you; go for gold.\n\nVisit Eugenialast.com, or join Eugenia on Twitter/Facebook/LinkedIn."
