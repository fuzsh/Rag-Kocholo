        "text": "Tom Hanks is a legendary actor and filmmaker known for roles in films such as the iconic 1994 film Forrest Gump, 2013’s Captain Phillips, and 1993’s Sleepless in Seattle with Meg Ryan.\n\nSome of Hanks’ other notable performances include 1984’s Splash, 1988’s Big, 1992’s A League of their Own, 1995’s Apollo 13, 2013’s Saving Mr. Banks, 2016’s Sully, and 2019's A Beautiful Day In The Neighborhood. Hanks is also known for voicing the character of Sheriff Woody in the popular Disney-Pixar Toy Story children’s movies.\n\nIn 2014, Hanks received a Kennedy Center Honor and in 2016, he received a Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Barack Obama. Hanks has also received the prestigious French Legion of Honor. Hanks even has an asteroid, 12818 Tomhanks, named after him.\n\nHanks attended Chabot College and studied theater, and then transferred to California State University, Sacramento after two years. Although he did not end up graduating, Hanks took advantage of his college years by attending many plays, familiarizing himself with the work of great playwrights including Bertolt Brecht, Tennessee Williams and Henrik Ibsen. During that time, Hanks met Vincent Dowling, head of the Great Lakes Theater Festival in Cleveland, Ohio, where he became an intern, learning about lighting, set design and stage management over the course of three years there.\n\nHanks has stated that he previously wanted to be an astronaut, and he is a supporter of NASA’s manned space program. He is also a member of the National Space Society.\n\nHanks is an outspoken Democrat, and he supports same-sex marriage, the development of alternative fuels, and other environmental causes. He has donated to many Democratic politicians in the past, and he supported Obama’s presidential bid in 2008 and Hillary Clinton’s presidential run in 2016. Hanks first revealed his type 2 diabetes diagnosis during an interview on \"The Late Show With David Letterman\" back in 2013, and has talked openly about it since."
