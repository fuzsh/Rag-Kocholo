        "text": "Thomas Jeffrey Hanks was born on July 9th, 1956 in Concord, California, USA, actor, commonly known as “Tom Hanks”. Hanks was raised by his father, “Amos Meford Hanks”, an English chef, and nurse “Janet Marilyn”. He was raised with Catholic and Mormon religion. While attending Skyline High School in Oakland, He took acting lessons from his best friend. Hanks demonstrated his acting talent as a teenager and won the “Academy Award” for “Best Actor in a Drama”. He then attended “Chabot College” in Hayward, California, and exchange to “California State University, Sacramento” two years later.\n\nAfter playing a small role in “Armand Mastroianni's” horror film named: \"He Knows you only\" (1980), he took slapstick work roles in many comedy films. His charming personality and intelligence made him more popular. His passion in the eighties, when he was rated as the “King of Comedy”, cannot be believed. His performance with Big (1988) was outstanding, earning him a “Los Angeles Critics Award” and “An Oscar nomination”. Although he had some setbacks since then, he coached the women's team in \"A League of Their Own\" (1992) and regained strength as an incredible figure, a former baseball player.\n\nTom felt it necessary to take a break from the drama and change direction and move towards other stories. Therefore, he tries to find strong points to demonstrate its effectiveness. He tried to take his first step away from acting in “Bonfire of the Vanities” (1989) directed by “Brian De Palma”, but it didn't turn out as he expected. His career, however, rebounded with a difficult and intense role as an AIDS lawyer in “Jonathan Demme's Philadelphia” (1992). He won an Oscar for his efforts. He returned to commercial success with “Nora Ephron's Sleepless” in Seattle (1993), starring “Meg Ryan”, and “Electronic Love Letters” (1998).\n\nRead More at:"
