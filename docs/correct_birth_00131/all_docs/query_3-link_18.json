        "text": "(born 1956). American actor Tom Hanks often played an ordinary, decent man caught up in extraordinary circumstances. He became famous for his comedic roles in the 1980s and later began starring in dramas. In the latter category, Hanks received two Academy Awards for best actor for his work in the movies Philadelphia (1993) and Forrest Gump (1994).\n\nThomas J. Hanks was born on July 9, 1956, in Concord, California. After studying drama at California State University, he performed in summer stock in Cleveland, Ohio. His film debut came in 1980 with a small role in a horror film. Hanks got his break in the television series Bosom Buddies, which ran from 1980 to 1982. He followed his first hit film, the romantic comedy Splash (1984), with roles in several comedies, including The Money Pit (1986), Nothing in Common (1986), Big (1988), A League of Their Own (1992), and Sleepless in Seattle (1993). He was nominated for an Academy Award for best actor for Big, in which he portrayed a 12-year-old boy transformed into an adult.\n\nIn 1994 Hanks won the Academy Award for best actor for his role in the drama Philadelphia, in which he played a homosexual attorney fired from a law firm because he had AIDS. He followed that performance with the critically acclaimed box-office blockbuster Forrest Gump. Hanks won the best actor Academy Award for his work in the title role, becoming the first person in more than 50 years to win back-to-back Academy Awards for best actor. He was also nominated for Oscars in Saving Private Ryan (1998), which was directed by Steven Spielberg, and Cast Away (2000). Additional dramatic roles came in Apollo 13 (1995), The Green Mile (1999), and Road to Perdition (2002). In the blockbuster Toy Story series (1995, 1999, 2010, and 2019), Hanks provided the voice of the animated cowboy Woody.\n\nHanks subsequently starred in Spielberg’s Catch Me If You Can (2002) and in the film adaptations of Dan Brown’s popular books The Da Vinci Code (2006; book 2003), Angels & Demons (2009; book 2000), and Inferno (2016; book 2013). In Charlie Wilson’s War (2007) Hanks appeared as real-life U.S. congressman Charlie Wilson, who assisted the Afghan resistance to the Soviets in the 1980s. Hanks portrayed a father killed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in the drama Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011). For the mystical epic Cloud Atlas (2012), he took on six roles, ranging from a 19th-century surgeon to a postapocalyptic tribesman. In 2013 Hanks made his Broadway debut in Lucky Guy, a play based on the life of journalist Mike McAlary. Hanks captured a Tony Award nomination for his performance as the hard-nosed newsman.\n\nHanks starred in two films in 2013, the drama Captain Phillips and the comedy Saving Mr. Banks. He then portrayed a lawyer defending a Soviet spy in Spielberg’s Cold War drama Bridge of Spies (2015). In 2016 Hanks starred in A Hologram for the King, portraying a salesman who journeys to Saudi Arabia in an attempt to revive his fortunes. That same year he appeared as the title character in Sully, Clint Eastwood’s drama based on the true story of a commercial airline pilot who made an emergency landing in the Hudson River. Hanks reunited with Spielberg for The Post (2017), about the publication of the Pentagon Papers, a government study about the Vietnam War. In the drama Hanks portrayed Ben Bradlee, executive editor of The Washington Post. In 2019 Hanks played another real person, Fred Rogers, in the biopic A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. For his performance, Hanks received his sixth Oscar nomination, for best supporting actor.\n\nIn addition to his acting, Hanks wrote and directed the comedy That Thing You Do! (1996), about a fictional 1960s rock band. He later cowrote, directed, and starred opposite Julia Roberts in the romance Larry Crowne (2011), playing an unemployed man who enrolls in community college. Hanks also produced a number of films and such television miniseries as From the Earth to the Moon (1998), which documents the Apollo space program, and the World War II dramas Band of Brothers (2001) and The Pacific (2010). In 2009 he narrated Beyond All Boundaries, a documentary about World War II that used animation, archival film footage, and sensory effects, including shaking seats. The 35-minute film was produced for the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana. Hanks also wrote the short-story collection Uncommon Type (2017)."
