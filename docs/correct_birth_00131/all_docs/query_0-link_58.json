        "text": "From humble beginnings to an aspiring thespian to acting as some of the world’s most iconic and notable characters.\n\nHe has picked up a reputation as ‘America’s Nice Guy’, ’The Everyman’ and a nomad of the arts.\n\nBut we all know him… as Tom Hanks.\n\nThe passion for art, can take an actor to places they never thought possible. The world has seen the rise of many talented artists, many of whom taking the world by storm, donning a plethora of roles.\n\nThere is one gentle soul that most will know. one, who’s acting range has exceeded global expectations, time and time again.\n\nFrom award winning performances... to personal achievements. The man that wanders... all around the world.\n\nHe goes by many names. Americas Father. Hollywood's nice guy, the everyman... But we all know him... As Tom Hanks.\n\nThomas Jeﬀrey Hanks, Born 9th July in Concord California. His mother, Janet Marylyn Frager was from a Portuguese family, whilst his father, Amos Meﬀord Hanks had English heritage.\n\nThe climate of his upbringing was not gentle. Though Tom’s parents were never cruel, His father, Amos, displayed a hardened demeanour throughout his years. As a child, Amos had witnessed the murder of his own father, Ernest Buel Hanks on his family farm. Such a horriﬁc incident would take a toll on his life, clouding his judgement of the world, and unfortunately resulted in a reserved, cold outlook. One without optimism, or appreciation of the arts, and subsequently, a lack of attention to his oﬀspring."
