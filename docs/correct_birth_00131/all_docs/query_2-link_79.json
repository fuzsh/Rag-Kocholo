He also produced the films \"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\" (2002), \"Charlie Wilson's War\" (2007), and \"Mamma Mia!\" (2008), among others.\n\nSalary Highlights\n\nBetween 1988 and 2010 alone, Tom earned around $300 million in movie salaries. That's the same as $450 million after adjusting for inflation. He then earned at least another $100 million in the next decade. In total, Tom has earned a minimum of $400 million in movie salaries during his career without adjusting for inflation. That does not count producing and directing payments or residuals.\n\nOne of Tom's first big paychecks came with the 1984 movie \"Splash,\" for which he earned $70,000. That's the same as around $172,000 after adjusting for inflation. Four years later, in 1988, Tom earned $1.75 million to star in \"Big.\" That's the same as around $4 million today. Also in 1998, he earned $5 million for \"Punchline\". That's the same as $11 million today. From the late 80s onward, Tom's salary stayed in the stratosphere.\n\nTom earned $40 million for \"Saving Private Ryan\" and then $20 million for each of \"You've Got Mail,\" \"Cast Away\" and \"The Green Mile.\" It's been reported that Hanks earned $8 million for playing Elvis' manager, Colonel Tom Parker, in 2022's \"Elvis.\"\n\nDa Vinci Code Salaries\n\nTom earned $18 million to star in 2006's \"The Da Vinci Code.\" He then earned $25 million to star in its 2009 sequel, \"Angel's & Demons,\" and another $25 million to star in the 2016 final in the trilogy, \"Inferno.\" In total, Tom Hanks earned $68 million for his work as Robert Langdon.\n\nForrest Gump Payday\n\nIn 1993, Tom was originally supposed to earn $7 million to star in \"Forrest Gump.\" At some point during production the movie had gone significantly over budget. Instead of seeing the movie derailed, Tom offered to give up his salary in exchange for \"first dollar\" backend points. In that situation, he received a share of the box office receipts owed to Paramount after the theater owners took their cut before the studio started subtracting expenses like marketing and printing costs.\n\nAs you now know, Forrest Gump went on to be an enormous box office hit, earning $700 million at the box office and another $100-200 million over time from licensing deals, VHS and DVD sales.\n\nThanks to his first-dollar deal, Tom made out extremely well. In the first year alone, his backend points translated to around $70 million, which is the same as around $120 million today. It is still by far his biggest acting paycheck and one of the largest acting paychecks in Hollywood history.\n\nReal Estate Assets\n\nIn total, The Hanks/Wilson real estate asset portfolio is worth at least $150 million. In April of 1991, Tom and Rita bought a large oceanfront mansion in the uber-exclusive Malibu Colony for $2.95 million. The seller was director John Frankenheimer. Today, this house is likely worth $20 million, if not more. In January 2010, Tom and Rita spent $26 million to acquire what would become their primary residence in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles.\n\nIn May 2017, Tom and Rita sold two side-by-side homes in the Palisades for $18 million. The buyer, who has hidden their identification through a San Francisco-based lawyer and LLC, proceeded to demolish the two homes to make way for a very large single mansion. Tom and Rita own at least five other homes in the Pacific Palisades.\n\nOutside of Los Angeles, Tom and Rita own a ski house in Sun Valley, Idaho.\n\nTom Hanks Net Worth Milestones\n\nTom was first added to Celebrity Net Worth in October 2009. At the time we pegged his fortune at $150 million. As of this writing, Tom Hanks' net worth is $400 million.\n\nQuotes\n\n\"There isn't any great mystery about me. What I do is glamorous and has an awful lot of white-hot attention placed on it. But the actual work requires the same discipline and passion as any job you love doing, be it as a very good pipe fitter or a highly creative artist.\"\n\n\"If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great.\"\n\nPersonal Life\n\nTom Hanks was married to Samantha Lewes from 1978 to 1987. He married actress Rita Wilson in 1988.
