        "text": "Actor Born Thomas Jeffery Hanks on July 9, 1956 in Concord, Calif.\n\nFour years after he was born, Tom Hanksâ father moved him and his siblings to start a new life in Reno, Nev., and divorced Hanksâ mother. After a second marriage hit the rocks, his father moved the Hanks children to Oakland, Calif. Hanks found solace from his personal turmoil in acting in high school.\n\nHe went to a junior college and then became a theater major at California State University in Sacramento. After interning at the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland under the direction of Vincent Dowling, Hanks quit college to spend the next two summers at the festival. In 1978, he moved to New York City.\n\nHanks managed to get a role in the 1980 horror film âHe Knows You're Alone.â That same year, he was teamed with Peter Scolari in the ABC sitcom âBosom Buddies,â as two young men who lose their New York apartment and disguise themselves as women to get cheap rooms in a female-only hotel.\n\nMovie stardom hit in 1984 with Ron Howardâs romantic comedy âSplash,â in which Hanksâ boy-next-door persona endeared him to audiences as a young New Yorker who falls for a mermaid (Daryl Hannah). He got saddled, though, in a lot of featherweight comedies. In one of them, the 1985 comedy âVolunteers,â he met his second wife, actress Rita Wilson. His fortunes turned in 1988, when he landed âBig,â directed by Penny Marshall. Hanks earned his first best actor Oscar nomination for an endearing turn as a 12-year-old boy in a 35-year-old manâs body.\n\nBut he made more missteps after 1988, most notably in the disastrous 1990 version of the bestseller âBonfire of the Vanities.â He took on a character part as a down-on-his-luck and deep-in-his-cups former baseball player who coaches a womenâs baseball team in Marshallâs 1992 hit, âA League of Their Own.â\n\nThe next year he went dramatic, earning his first Oscar as a young gay attorney dying of AIDS in âPhiladelphia.â Hanks became the first actor since Spencer Tracy nearly 60 years earlier to receive back-to-back best actor Oscars, winning as the whimsical man-child whose mother told him âlife is like a box of chocolatesâ in the Academy Award-winning best film âForrest Gump.â\n\nHanks found the perfect romantic comedy partner in Meg Ryan. Though their first pairing in 1990âs âJoe Versus the Volcanoâ flopped at the box office, they hit gold the summer of 1993 in âSleepless in Seattleâ and in 1998's âYouâve Got Mail.â Both romances were directed by Nora Ephron.\n\nIn 1995, he reunited with Howard for the blockbuster âApollo 13â and was the voice of the cowboy toy Woody in the Disney/Pixar animated hit, âToy Story.â He was Woody's voice in 1999âs âToy Story 2â and 2010's âToy Story 3.â\n\nIn 1996, he made his directorial debut with the nostalgic âThat Thing You Do!â In 1998, he was a producer/director on the 12-part HBO miniseries âFrom the Earth to the Moon.â\n\nHanks and good friend Steven Spielberg collaborated for the first time on the big screen in the gripping, violent 1998 World War II drama âSaving Private Ryan,â for which he was Oscar-nominated. Hanks received another Oscar nomination for 2000âs âCast Away,â in which he played a plane-crash victim.\n\nHanks and Spielberg teamed up once again for the acclaimed HBO World War II miniseries, âBand of Brothersâ in 2001. In the spring of 2010, HBO aired their latest miniseries, âThe Pacific,â exploring World War II from the eyes of three soldiers.\n\nHanks, who is considered one of the nice guys in Hollywood, continues to grow as an actor, playing a hit man in 2002âs âThe Road to Perdition,â a FBI agent in Spielbergâs 2002 comedy âCatch Me if You Can,â an immigrant coming to the U.S. in Spielbergâs 2004 âThe Terminalâ and a womanizing, drug-loving congressman in 2007âs âCharlie Wilsonâs War.â Hanks has also reteamed with Howard to play professor Robert Langdon in the 2006 âThe Da Vinci Codeâ and 2009âs âAngels and Demons.â\n\nIn 2008, he appeared opposite son Colin Hanks in the indie feature, âThe Great Buck Howard.â Hanks is currently starring in, directing and producing âLarry Crowne,â which also stars his âCharlie Wilsonâ leading lady, Julia Roberts."
