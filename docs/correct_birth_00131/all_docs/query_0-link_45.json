        "text": "We are excited to highlight the creative journey of Kori and Sammy Barton, a dynamic duo with deep roots in Concord. Kori, a proud alumna who earned both a B.S. and an M.S. in hospitality, recreation, and tourism from Cal State East Bay, teamed up with her husband Sammy to create \"C is for Concord: An A to Z Journey through Concord, California.\" This beautifully illustrated ABC book captures the treasures and history of their beloved city, making it a perfect read for families.\n\nKori, raised in Concord, brought her passion for art and design to life with vibrant illustrations, while Sammy’s love for poetry shaped the narrative. This labor of love not only highlights well-known spots like Mt. Diablo and Buchanan Airport but also uncovers hidden gems like the local elk herd.\n\nTheir journey began as a personal project for their children but quickly grew into a community treasure. A memorable highlight was receiving approval from the actor Tom Hanks to include him as the letter \"T,\" recognizing his birthplace in Concord.\n\nTheir series, Hometown Highlights Alphabet Series, continues to grow with \"W is for Walnut Creek\" already published and \"C is for Clayton\" in the works.\n\nCurious about their creative process and inspirations? Read more in our exclusive Q&A with Kori and Sammy Barton.\n\nQ: What inspired you both to create “C is for Concord: An A-Z Journey through Concord, California”?\n\nA: I (Kori) love books and art, so when the idea to create a children's book highlighting our hometown came to me while I was doing yard work one Saturday morning (shout out to inspirational house chores!), I thought it would be a great combo. Our initial plan was simply to create a book as a gift for our kids, but it grew into a gift for our community at large.\n\nQ: Can you share more about the process of writing and illustrating the book together? What were some memorable moments during this project?\n\nA: It is absolutely delightful to have a creative side project to work on as a married couple. From brainstorming, to research, to design, and writing poetry together (often during long road trips and airplane flights), it is a happy, productive hobby for us and a labor of love for our communities! We always enjoy walking around cities for each of our books (both published and still to come) and considering which local gems we should highlight. One particularly neat moment during our writing of the Concord book was receiving approval from Tom Hanks to include him as letter \"T\" since he was born in Concord. We were surprised and thankful for the kindness from him and his team to even take the time to respond, much less give us the go ahead!\n\nQ: Kori, how did your background in art and design influence the illustrations in the book?\n\nA: I grew up with an affinity for all things arts and crafts, and I had a teacher in a college art history class that helped me develop a deeper appreciation for paintings in particular. From years of trial and error experience, I've developed a fondness for painting, and I view each of my paintings as practice for the next one. I aim to do my best (which definitely means occasionally tossing a painting and starting over) to help kids see the beauty of their hometown and to learn to appreciate art, just like my teacher did for me many years ago!\n\nQ: Sammy, how did your experience as a pastor and your love for poetry shape the narrative of the book?\n\nA: As a pastor, I spend a lot of time with words: studying words, understanding the nuances of words, and figuring out how to use words in a clear and compelling way. My love of words that I harness every day as a pastor apparently translates to children's poetry as well!\n\nQ: What message do you hope readers, especially families in Concord, take away from your book?\n\nA: We hope that our books make kids smile as they recognize locations close to home and learn that their city is a wonderful place to explore! How thrilled we would be if our books can encourage families to be thankful for their town, and to develop a deeper appreciation and understanding of the things they see on a daily basis...then embark on hometown adventures of their own!\n\nQ: How has the community responded to your book so far, and what has been the most rewarding feedback you’ve received?\n\nA: At the start, we had no plans to write more books after \"C is for Concord,\" but with the overwhelming positive response from families in the community, and requests for new city books, we were beyond thrilled to continue and create a series (Hometown Highlights Alphabet Series). \"W is for Walnut Creek\" was also a blast to create, and right now we have \"C is for Clayton\" in the works, which will be released later this year. Our very favorite thing was - and continues to be - connecting with many folks in our community and hearing their stories about why they love their town. We treasure these chats!\n\nQ: Could you share a favorite excerpt or illustration from the book and tell us why it is special to you?\n\nA: Each letter's poem has been hopelessly etched into our minds and daily family conversation... and we love it! When we pass locations around town that are highlighted in our books, we often break out into playful orations of our poems. One of Sammy's favorite poems is letter \"O\" about the bell on the old Concord firehouse, which ends, \"It would toll during curfew and alert of a fire, and it's still there in Concord for you to admire.\" He gets a kick out of frequently quoting that last part while conversing with us about anything, related or not. Perhaps our favorite illustration is \"F\" for Farmers' Market because of the fresh, colorful produce, and the sweet connection between the little kids watching Farmer Antonio Diaz who carefully helped grow the fruits that they get to enjoy.\n\nQ: Do you have any advice for aspiring authors and illustrators in our CSU East Bay community?\n\nA: Be unafraid to begin! If you've got a book concept in mind, and you're willing to work hard and research well, there are opportunities for you now more than ever. The first book is the most challenging, but it will teach you many valuable lessons along the way and prepare you better for next time. Just remember how a book is written: One word at a time."
