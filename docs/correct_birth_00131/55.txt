Family Overview

Tom Hanks came from a blue-collar family who worked hard and provided a stable home for him and his siblings. They married once and lived in the same area where they grew up.

His siblings all pursued something similar to Tom, with the exception of his sister, who works in education. They each seem to be down-to-earth folks despite their success.

His first marriage ended in divorce, but the couple remained friends afterward. He met his second wife originally on a set of a television show, and they reconnected later.

He had two children with each of his wives, and each of his children pursued a career in entertainment.

He was the narrator in Killing Lincoln, and since he is an ancestor of Abraham Lincoln he was the perfect fit.
