Love Actually is one of the most iconic films ever made, with its interwoven storylines and incredible acting from a stellar cast. But the 2003 Christmas movie wasn't always easy to film for one actor.

Alan Rickman,

known for his portrayal of Snape in Harry Potter, plays Harry, husband to Emma Thompson's character Karen in Love Actually. He starts to become interested in his secretary, the sexy if horrible Mia, and decides to buy her some jewellery as a present.

In the movie, there's an incredible scene where Harry is trying to buy an expensive necklace for Mia while out shopping with his wife and has mere moments to secure the present and hide it without Karen noticing. But the shop assistant, played by Rowan Atkinson, adds flourish after flourish, adding tension, stress and hilarity to the situation.

But it wasn't just Alan's character Harry that was starting to sweat from nerves and frustration - Alan himself was driven insane by Rowan's antics. In an interview with American journalist Diane Sawyer, director Richard Curtis shared a behind-the-scenes secret about that scene, revealing how much Alan hated it.

According to Richard, during filming, Alan was just as annoyed at the scene much like his character. He said: “Rowan was just taking his time,” Curtis told Sawyer in the special. “So he would do 11-minute takes.”

“[Rowan would say], ‘Let’s go back and do that. Let’s start again.’ And poor Alan was there all the time going, ‘Grr, ugh.’”

The beloved Professor Snape actor tragically passed away in January 2016 after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. At the time, it was said that he had died “surrounded by family and friends”.
