The Christmas rom-com boasts a stacked ensemble filled with more than a few famous faces.

“To me, you are perfect.” That’s what many fans say to the rom-com Love Actually each holiday season. First released in November 2003, the film — which is now streaming on Netflix — has since developed a devoted following, with many believing it to be required viewing each year.

One of the best things about the seasonal flick is its robust cast: With interconnected love stories told over two hours, there are a wealth of featured players, many of them notable actors. Whether you can sing every word of “Christmas Is All Around” or you’ve only watched the modern classic once, you’ll definitely recognize many of its stars. Read on to see what the Love Actually cast has been up to in the two decades since the film came out.

Hugh Grant

as David, the Prime Minister

About the Character

David has recently been elected prime minister when he develops feelings for his staffer Natalie. He mistakenly believes she has feelings for the US president when he walks in on an awkward moment, but learns the truth when she leaves him a Christmas card.

Previously In

No stranger to rom-coms, Grant followed up Love Actually by reprising his role as Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason and starring alongside Drew Barrymore in Music and Lyrics. He stepped outside the genre for Florence Foster Jenkins and to play the villain in Paddington 2. He most recently starred in HBO’s The Undoing and Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, along with a memorable cameo in Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.

Billy Bob Thornton

as The US president

About the Character

The president is visiting England for a meeting with the prime minister. During his stay, he does not do America proud: He makes inappropriate comments about the PM’s staffer Natalie.

Previously In

The same year that Love Actually came out, Thornton starred in Bad Santa. He received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame the next year. His credits since then have included the films School for Scoundrels and Mr. Woodcock, as well as the TV series Fargo.

Emma Thompson

as Karen

About the Character

David’s sister Karen is a stay-at-home mom to two kids with her husband, Harry. She has arguably the worst holiday in the whole film as she finds out that her husband has feelings for his secretary. She stumbles upon an expensive necklace in his coat pocket — thinking it’s for her — only to discover on Christmas Day that he bought her a CD.

Previously In

Thompson has had no shortage of acting credits since Love Actually in 2003. She’s gone on to star in the Harry Potter film series, Nanny McPhee and its sequel (both of which she also wrote), Men in Black 3, Saving Mr. Banks, the 2017 version of Beauty and the Beast, Cruella, and Matilda the Musical.

Alan Rickman

as Harry

About the Character

For a married man, Harry pays a little too much attention to his secretary, Mia. She’s extremely flirtatious toward him, which he rewards by purchasing her an expensive Christmas gift, and slow-dances a little too closely with her at their company holiday party.

Previously In

Like Thompson, Rickman starred in the Harry Potter series. Severus Snape would become one of his most memorable roles, but he continued to star in films —​​ including Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street and Alice in Wonderland — and on stage until his death in 2016.

Heike Makatsch

as Mia

About the Character

Mia isn’t someone the audience can easily root for: She’s over-the-top flirty with her boss, Harry — one time even in front of his wife. We don’t know much else about Mia except that she’s Natalie’s next-door neighbor.

Previously In

Makatsch appeared in the 2013 war drama The Book Thief, as well as a number of German films.

Keira Knightley

as Juliet

About the Character

Juliet thinks her new husband’s best friend, Mark, doesn’t like her. He’s cold to her and even refuses to show her the video he shot at her and Peter’s wedding. But when she finally sees the footage and realizes Peter isn’t in it, Mark admits he’s distant because he does like her.

Previously In

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, in which Knightley starred as Elizabeth Swann, came out the same year as Love Actually. Knightley portrayed the character in the two sequels as well. She continued to see success in the films King Arthur, Price & Prejudice, Atonement, and The Imitation Game. She has received Oscar, Golden Globe, and BAFTA nominations.

Andrew Lincoln

as Mark

About the Character

After finally admitting he has feelings for his best friend’s new wife, Mark shows up at their apartment pretending to be a holiday caroler. When Juliet answers the door, he plays music on a boombox and, in one of the film’s most famous scenes, declares his love in a series of large cue cards.

Previously In

After this card-wielding character, Lincoln is likely best known for his portrayal of Rick Grimes in The Walking Dead, in which he starred from 2010–2018.

Colin Firth

as Jamie

About the Character

Peter and Juliet’s wedding also isn’t a happy time for Jamie, who goes without his girlfriend because she’s sick. He comes home early to find her having sex with his brother. Heartbroken, Jamie escapes to a French cottage to work on his next book. There he meets his housekeeper, Aurélia, who speaks only Portuguese, while he speaks only English.

Previously In

Following Love Actually, Firth starred in What a Girl Wants, Girl with a Pearl Earring, and alongside Thompson in Nanny McPhee. He then got into musicals with a lead role in Mamma Mia! and appeared in critically acclaimed films The King’s Speech (which won him an Oscar) and Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

Olson continued working with Brodie-Sangster through animation: The two voiced characters in Phineas and Ferb from 2008–2015 (Olson voiced Vanessa, who Ferb — voiced by Brodie-Sangster — had a crush on).

Bill Nighy

About the Character

Billy Mack was once a rock legend, but he’s attempting to stage a comeback with a Christmas version of the ’60s song “Love Is All Around.” He hates the song, and is perpetually grumpy about it, but he wants to have another No. 1 hit, which is what happens.

Previously In

His Love Actually character may have been staging a comeback, but Nighy never needed one. He’s appeared in countless films, including Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1, The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, and Emma. His 2022 drama Living also earned him an Oscar nomination.
