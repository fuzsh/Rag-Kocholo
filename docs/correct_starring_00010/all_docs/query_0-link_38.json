        "text": "One Love Actually star is now totally unrecognisable, 20 years on from the iconic Christmas movie’s release.\n\nHeike Makatsch famously played Mia in the 2003 flick, aka Alan Rickman’s office mistress for whom he bought a necklace that left Dame Emma Thompson heartbroken and sobbing into her Joni Mitchell CD.\n\nMia sported a trademark black bob and was often seen strutting into Harry’s office in knee-high boots and a mini skirt.\n\nShe, of course, gave us one of the film’s most memorable lines when she said to boss Harry: ‘I don’t want something I need. I want something I want – something pretty’, before he splashed out on the gold locket.\n\nThe actress behind the seductress looks remarkably different today, though, to the point where you’d have to do a double take to recognise her as a member of the 2000s ensemble cast.\n\nAged 52, the German movie star now rocks long, blonde locks.\n\nUnlike many of her co-stars, Heike has remained largely out of the limelight since the success of Love Actually.\n\nAs we know, the rom com propelled the likes of Thomas Brodie-Sangster and Martine McCutcheon to fame, while also starring movie veterans Hugh Grant, Colin Firth, and Liam Neeson.\n\nHeike, on the other hand, has chosen to keep a low profile.\n\nThe actress – who also played Lisa Addison in Resident Evil (2002) – went on to earn an International Emmy Award for best actress in 2006 for her role in Margarete Steiff – A Story of Courage.\n\nShe also played Liesel’s mother in The Book Thief (2013).\n\nThen, in 2012, she became a face of French cosmetics company L’Oréal.\n\nHeike also served on the jury of the Goldene Kamera awards in 2017.\n\nAs for her personal life, Heike in a seven-year relationship with James Bond actor Daniel Craig, but they split in 2004.\n\nShe now has three daughters, born in 2007, 2009, and 2015.\n\nTwo of her daughters are shared with German indie musician Max Martin, while the other is fathered by actor Trystan Pütter, with whom Heike has been in a relationship since 2017.\n\nAs of 2022, the actress lives in Berlin and shares glimpses into her life on social media, such as glamorous holiday snaps and photoshoots.\n\nHeike has also garnered a reputation for her activism, having recently used her platform to advocate for a ceasefire amid the Israel war.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Janey Godley shuts down abhorrent troll who said she ‘wouldn’t see Christmas’"
