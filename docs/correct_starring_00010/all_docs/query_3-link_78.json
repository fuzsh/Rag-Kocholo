        "text": "I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and Christmas movies alike, but I have to admit I missed out on Love Actually. So when I heard that the famous rom-com was coming back to theaters in a fully restored version on Tuesday, December 5 (twenty years after its first theatrical release), I hurried to finally check out the Christmas classic.\n\nThe film opens with a kiss, Richard Curtis's camera captures those precious moments when people reunite with their loved ones in an airport terminal (a familiar meeting place in romantic comedies). \"Whenever I get gloomy with the state of the world, I think about the arrivals gate at Heathrow Airport,\" confides an endearing male narrator. According to him, there is no better place to observe shows of emotion. \"You'll see that love, in the end, is everywhere. It's not always dignified or glorious, but it's always there.\" If love is introduced as the keyword so early on in Love Actually, will it make a good film? I was about to find out!\n\nChristmas in London looks magical\n\nAfter a preview of a cast worth mentioning, Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, Keira Knightley, and Claudia Schiffer, to name but a few, in the opening credits, we head east, away from the airport, towards the center of London. By setting his film in the cold, snowy London of December, Richard Curtis certainly wins brownie points. With Christmas just a few weeks away, the city is splendid. Garlands of fairy lights illuminate the sumptuously decorated streets, and a huge Christmas tree fills the department store galleries, all to the soundtrack's delightful melody. The film captures only the best of England, the charm of London and especially of its chic neighborhoods in the run-up to the festive season. As Hugh Grant himself points out when his character, the British Prime Minister, gives a speech to the press, his country is above all that of \"The country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that.\" Admittedly, this sense of wonder is somewhat utopian, even exclusive, but it is also one of the elements that we expect to see in a traditional romantic comedy. When properly tied to the narrative, it works perfectly (so much so that I find myself dreaming of spending and enchanting Christmas in London).\n\nDaniel and Sam's relationship is adorable\n\nA series of scenes follow, introducing us to each character (of which there are many). Right from the start, I fall under the spell of the little boy named Sam (played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster) who finds himself living with his stepfather, Daniel (Liam Neeson), when his mother dies. Although he has experienced so much heartache and has been carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders since the funeral, something else seems to be troubling him. As a parent in the making who is attentive to Sam's emotions and needs, Daniel asks him about the source of his worries. The child replies that he's in love, with none other than the coolest girl in school, he says. The problem is that he doesn't know how to approach her. The two men develop a bond as they talk about love, and I appreciate the seriousness with which the adult engages in these conversations. As soon as he realizes the importance of the situation to the young Sam, he adapts his speech with benevolence. And even when he doesn't have the right words to respond to Sam's romantic torments, he proves himself to be imaginative. In the end, he's the ideal father, who is not afraid to talk about his feelings, or even about love in general, the one who'd rather watch Titanic while crying than deny his sorrow. The scene that truly melted my heart was the final one, which sees Daniel take Sam to the airport so that he can declare his love for Joanna, before she leaves the country for America.\n\nHarry's character is loathsome\n\nOn the other hand, I can't say that I can sing as many praises for Harry. While I was delighted to see actor Alan Rickman on screen (my imagination still links him to Harry Potter's Professor Severus Snape), the character Richard Curtis wrote for him in Love Actually is simply unbearable. We first discover him as a toxic employer when he brings one of his employees into his office to \"advise\" her on her love life. Not only does he meddle in a strictly personal matter, but he also abuses his power to encourage her to do something she might not have wanted to do (or at least not in this way). He suggests that she ask out the colleague she's infatuated with. According to Harry, everyone in the company knows about her feelings and it would be embarrassing to continue to do nothing. After following his advice, the employee in question finds herself forced and humiliated to the core.\n\nThis is followed by an even more inappropriate scene, which sees Harry talk to his secretary, Mia. Although Mia makes no secret of her intention to seduce him, Harry (who, in addition to being her superior, happens to be considerably older than she is) takes pleasure in letting her imagine that an affair between the two of them might be possible. He never misses an opportunity to display inappropriate behavior or words, from longing glances to comments about the way she dresses. He's got nothing going for him. Especially not the present he decides to give her for Christmas. While his wife bears the mental burden of finding gifts for the whole family, including her husband, he has no better idea than to spend his spare time buying a necklace for his potential mistress. It's a situation that makes me laugh because it's so true about how clumsy men can be (not to mention how little effort they put into the annual task of Christmas gift-giving). So, on the morning of December 25, Karen (Emma Thompson), receives her traditional scarf under the tree, just as she has done in previous years. As despicable and unoriginal as he may be, Harry's character is nonetheless believable. Let's face it, if the pathetic, flirtatious boss who cheats on his wife with his secretary is a hard-boiled cliché, it's because he maintains a certain closeness to reality.\n\nMark's declaration of love to Juliet is truly bizarre\n\nAt the heart of the great sentimental puzzle that is Love Actually lies the relationship between Mark (Andrew Lincoln) and Juliet (Keira Knightley). She has just married Peter, and he is her husband's best friend. Apart from this tie, nothing else seems to bring them together. They have little in common and conversation hardly flows between them. Yet Richard Curtis wants us to believe that Mark is crazy about her. First, at her wedding, he films only her through his camera. But the most absurd of all is the famous sign scene. I say famous because, even though I'm watching the film for the first time, this scene inevitably floods social media every year in the run-up to the holidays. It's impossible not to have it in mind when people talk to me about Love Actually. So here's what I think of it (after watching it). Ringing your best friend's doorbell, being greeted by his wife, asking her to lie about you being there and instead that say that it's carol singers at the door, and then taking the opportunity to declare your love for her is all just as problematic as it is unbelievable. I'm willing to listen to the sentiment behind the staging of the signs, but it nevertheless strikes me as highly questionable to do so with the wife of one's best friend (who happens to be in the very next room during this encounter). The final blow comes when Juliet decides, out of the blue, to kiss Mark.\n\nSeeing Hugh Grant dancing like nobody is watching is enough to make it worth the watch\n\nAnother iconic scene, and one that didn't disappoint me this time, is Hugh Grant's dance when his character believes that he is alone in his room at 10 Downing Street. The actor sways to the soundtrack of the Pointer Sisters' “Jump,” descending the stairs as if making a grand entrance to a nightclub, then continues into the living room, where he bumps into his secretary. He turns around and returns to his apartments, leaving me wanting to pause and watch this unforgettable scene all over again before continuing with the film.\n\nThere is body shaming throughout\n\nHowever, Hugh Grant is not a blameless Prime Minister. Funny and endearing as he is in many ways, he also contributes to the film's fat-shaming, which is especially apparent with the character of Natalie (Martine McCutcheon). Like most of the women in Love Actually, her main purpose is to allow men's desires to exist, in this case that of the Prime Minister, who has a huge crush on her. And while women's bodies are the subject of conversation among the men, Natalie's looks are particularly subjected to shame and belittlement. She is repeatedly told that she does not fit into the standards of beauty (at least those of twenty years ago). Her thighs are too big, her breasts too visible. Natalie is nothing but an object to men (her ex-boyfriend even left her because \"nobody wants a girlfriend with thighs the size of tree trunks,\" and her father calls her “plumpy.\" While Grant's character avoids making inappropriate comments for most of the film, he does not publicly defend the woman he claims to love.\n\nThere are some subplots we could have done without\n\nOf Love Actually's many love storylines, I have to admit that I don't see the point in some. Whether it's the absurd meeting between two actors on what appears to be the set of a pornographic film. I find myself more disappointed by the lack of attention paid to the actress - who learns at the last minute that she has to strip naked and have her breasts fondled by her acting partner - than I am interested in the budding romance between the two characters. As for the adventures of Billy Mack or and Colin Frissell, it might have been preferable to concentrate on the stories that are essential to the comedy, even if it meant developing them further.\n\nLove Actually is not a total failure. However, in my opinion, it contains too many faux pas to make it genuinely pleasant to watch without our critical thinking getting carried away. I look for peace of mind in my Christmas romcoms. Here, I can't help but cringe at the accumulation of sexist comments (but also camera shots) that serve the male gaze. And this burdens both the female and male characters. On the one hand, men have to embody absolute virtue in all circumstances (Karen takes the liberty of suggesting to her friend Daniel that he should get over his wife's death as quickly as possible and \"get a grip\" as “people hate Sissies.” As for the women, they do not exist for anything other than their discretion. Can we talk about the fact that the writer, played by Colin Firth, falls in love with his female cleaner without even having a chance to have a conversation with her? These details have not aged well. If they could have been omitted, the film would probably have been better off."
