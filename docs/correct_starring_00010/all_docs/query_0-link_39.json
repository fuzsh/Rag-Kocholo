        "text": "An actress from one of our favorite Christmas movie classics made a recent and rare public appearance, looking drastically different from her ‚Äúdevil‚Äù self.\n\nHeike Makatsch, who portrayed Alan Rickman‚Äôs mistress, Mia, in the popular 2003 Love Actually movie has been spotted some 20 years later, sporting a more angelic appearance than what she had initially been recognized for.\n\nIn the film, the seductress had a short, choppy black bob, often wore red, and notably wore two devil horns in a scene where she openly flirted with Harry (Alan) in front of his wife, Karen, played by Emma Thompson, at a Christmas office party.\n\nHeike Makatsch, who portrayed Alan Rickman‚Äôs mistress, Mia, in the popular 2003 Love Actually, looks completely different now\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: vidapress\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: Gerald Matzka/Getty Images\n\nIn another memorable scene, Harry gives Mia a locket before she replies to him: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want something I need. I want something I want ‚Äì something pretty.‚Äù\n\nSubsequently, a very crushed Karen, who realizes later on that her husband had bought a gift for another woman, goes on to confront Harry and he admits what he‚Äôd been doing.\n\nIn the film, Mia had a short, choppy black bob, often wore red, and notably wore two devil horns\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: www.netflix.com\n\nThis ultimately led to Mia being one of the most, if not, the most disliked characters in the movie.\n\nBut now, the 52-year-old actress looks nothing like the ‚Äúmean‚Äù looking mistress she once played, and rather rocks longer, blonde locks.\n\nHeike has managed to keep a low profile despite starring in a range of hit movies since ‚ÄúLove Actually,‚Äù including 2013‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Book Thief‚Äù the New York Post reported.\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: netflix\n\nDespite being a season classic, a recently revealed fact from the Richard Curtis film has been rather controversial, as it implicates the questionable age gap between the Love Actually actors.\n\nIn case you have forgotten Love Actually‚Äôs plot, the movie follows the lives of eight very different couples in dealing with their love lives in various loosely interrelated tales all set during a frantic month before Christmas in London, England, IMDb states.\n\nIn a scene, Mia openly flirted with Harry (Alan Rickman) in front of his wife, Karen, played by Emma Thompson, at a Christmas office party\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: netflix\n\nOne of these couples includes Juliet, played by Keira Knightley, caught in a peculiar love triangle with her on-screen husband Peter, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Peter‚Äôs best friend Mark, played by Andrew Lincoln.\n\nNevertheless, more and more fans of the rom-com have expressed their disbelief upon learning there was only a five-year age gap in real life between Keira and Thomas Brodie-Sangster, who played school pupil Sam, Liam Neeson‚Äôs character‚Äôs son.\n\nShare icon\n\nImage credits: netflix\n\nAt the time of shooting Love Actually in 2003, Keira was 18, and Thomas 13, while Chiwetel was 26 and Andrew was 30.\n\nIndeed, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star was closer in age to the movie‚Äôs lovesick teen boy than her on-screen love interest.\n\n‚ÄúShe is well-known and respected in Germany,‚Äù a viewer highlighted"
