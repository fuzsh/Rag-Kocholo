Rickman played Professor Snape in the Harry Potter series, but is also an accomplished stage and TV actor and has appeared in films like Dogma, Galaxy Quest, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Sense & Sensibility, Love Actually, Alice in Wonderland as the Blue Caterpillar, Bottle Shock, Lee Daniels' The Butler and CBGB. He stars in this short titled Dust, from co-writers/directors Ben Ockrent & Jake Russell, that will freak you out at first. Once you get it, and once you figure out what's going on, you'll either be smiling or going nuts. I believe it's a odd kind of dark comedy, so laugh it up. Or report the authorities. Either way, enjoy this short.\n\nSynopsis from IMDb: \"Dust, starring Alan Rickman and Jodie Whittaker, is the short story of a man who follows a young girl and her mum home from school one day. He waits outside their house until nightfall before breaking in. Once inside, events take an unexpected turn...\" Dust is written/directed by Ben Ockrent & Jake Russell, produced by Catherine Bailey. The cast features actors Alan Rickman, Jodie Whittaker (from Venus, Perrier's Bounty, Attack the Block, One Day) along with Lola Albert. The short was \"long-listed\" for BAFTA and played at numerous film festivals all over the world, including Palm Springs, Aspen ShortFest, and Encounters in the UK.
