        "text": "And while many members of the ensemble cast have gone on to have Hollywood careers, including Keira Knightley, some stars are rarely seen in public.\n\nHeike Makatsch, who portrayed Alan Rickman’s mistress Mia, now looks remarkably different than she did in the hit flick. In the film, the seductress sports a short, choppy black bob.\n\nThese days, the now 52-year-old rocks a longer, blonde hairdo, meaning many don’t even recognise her as a Love Actually star.\n\nOne memorable scene features Makatsch’s Mia and Rickman’s character Henry at a Christmas party where she wears a skimpy dress and devil horns in a bid to seduce him.\n\nHenry gives Mia a locket before she replies to him: “I don’t want something I need. I want something I want – something pretty.”\n\nHeike - who is German - has managed to keep a low profile despite starring in a range of hit movies since Love Actually, including 2013’s The Book Thief, the New York Post reports.\n\nShe is also a singer who has released hit tracks such as Stand by Your Man and This Girl Was Made for Loving.\n\nSince 2012 she has also been a spokesmodel for cosmetics company L’Oréal.\n\nHeike dated Daniel Craig from 1996 until 2004. The Berlin-based beauty is currently dating Trystan Pütte and she has three daughters from past relationships.\n\nLove Actually stars Emma Thompson and Grant reunited last month to discuss the legacy of the British film in the event, The Laughter & Secrets of Love Actually: 20 Years Later – A Diane Sawyer Special.\n\nThompson, 63, revealed what Grant, 62, said to her while on shooting the movie.\n\n“Hugh came up behind me as we were walking out and said, ‘Is that the most psychotic thing we’ve ever been in?’” she humorously recalled.\n\n“Did I say that?” the “Four Weddings and a Funeral” actor joked.\n\n“[It’s about] love and all its messiness and its unexpectedness in that you’ll find love in the weirdest places,” Thompson explained of the beloved flick."
