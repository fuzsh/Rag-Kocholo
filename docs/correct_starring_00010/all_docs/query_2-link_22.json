        "text": "His ability to portray a man who flirts and then sleeps with his female employee, dances with her in front of his wife, then buys his mistress expensive jewellery and his spouse a goddamn CD for Christmas is impressive.\n\nBut he offered more to this role than just the standard adulterer we see in movies all the time. His real skill was in doing all the above while seeming cold, unaffectionate, and unfeeling towards his wife â€“ the same wife who had clearly devoted herself to him and her family. It is this, combined with his skill at delivering body-shaming comments and displaying a total lack of interest in her and their family, that elevated their scenes beyond rom-com territory. And it was this portrayal of real life that made their storyline so relatable."
