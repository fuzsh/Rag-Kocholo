        "text": "CHRISTMAS is absolutely built for re-runs of Richard Curtis' rom-com classic Love Actually.\n\nIf you haven’t already sneaked in a cheeky out-of-season viewing, you will be guaranteed to catch it on the small screen at least half a dozen times in December.\n\nBut if we’re not complaining.\n\nWe love nothing more than watching Colin Firth attempt to woo his love in a foreign tongue, Hugh Grant dance around 10 Downing Street and Bill Nighy perform his Christmas number one in the nude.\n\nAvid fans will no doubt know the classic back to front, but there are a few things you may not be aware of.\n\nHere are 11 Love Actually film secrets...\n\n1. Alan Rickman’s character Harry DID have a full-on affair with secretary Mia behind Emma Thompson’s back\n\nWe all remember the heart-breaking moment after the school play when Emma Thompson's character confronts her unfaithful husband.\n\nThe words still ring in our ears: “Would you wait around to find out if it's just a necklace, or if it's sex and a necklace, or if, worst of all, it's a necklace and... Would you stay, knowing life would always be a little bit worse?”\n\nLast year, during a screening of the film, script writer and Richard Curtis’ wife Emma Freud answered the question we have all been asking: was it just a necklace?\n\nUnfortunately not. When asked if the affair had actually happened, she said: “DEFINITELY had an affair. i begged richard just to make it a flirtation, but no. the whole way. [sic]”\n\n2. The original version of the film had 14 love stories\n\nFour of the original stories were cut - two of them before filming, and another two ended up on the editing room floor.\n\nThe first was about an African couple who supported each other through famine, and the second was about a strict headmistress who nursed her lesbian partner through cancer.\n\n3. Writer Richard Curtis had specific people in mind for the main roles\n\nRichard Curtis always destined Hugh Grant for the role of PM and Emma Thompson to play his sister.\n\nHe also wrote Martine McCutcheon’s role for her after spotting her years before on Eastenders.\n\nThe part she plays was originally called 'Martine' but was changed to Natalie before she auditioned so she wouldn’t know she'd definitely get the job.\n\nClaudia Schiffer was also never supposed to have a part, Richard actually just wanted someone who looked like her.\n\nBut, unable to track down an appropriate doppelganger, he offered her the role instead.\n\nHe also snuck his own daughter in as one of the lobsters in the nativity play.\n\n4. Love struck schoolboy Sam was played by Hugh Grant’s second cousin\n\nActor Thomas Brodie-Sangster was cast to play the character Sam and he is actually second cousins with Hugh Grant who played David, The Prime Minister.\n\nThomas said: “He’d call me cousin and ruffle my hair.”\n\nThomas went on to star in the hugely popular Game of Thrones.\n\n5. The US version didn’t include the Sugababes song Too Lost in You\n\nIn the UK version the Sugababes single played over the Christmas party scene in the art gallery.\n\nBut for the American audience it was replaced with Kelly Clarkson’s The Trouble With Love Is.\n\n6. Tony Blair made reference to Hugh Grant’s momentous speech\n\nBack in 2005 Tony Blair obviously felt the pressure of being compared to Hugh Grant as PM.\n\nHe said: “I know there’s a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off.\n\n“But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life there’s the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause.”\n\n7. The lake that Colin Firth dived into to save his manuscript was just 18 inches deep\n\nThe lake that Colin Firth and his Portuguese love interest dive into to save his precious manuscript was only 18 inches deep.\n\nIn order to make their swimming convincing the pair had to kneel down and bob about in the water.\n\n8. Kris Marshall offered to work for free\n\nMy Family funny guy Kris Marshall reportedly attempted to hand back his pay cheque after filming.\n\nApparently he enjoyed the scene where he was undressed by three American beauties – January Jones, Elisha Cuthbert and Ivana Miličević – so much that he didn’t feel he could take payment.\n\n9. Love Actually was NEVER meant to be a Christmas film\n\nRichard Curtis revealed he was \"surprised\" Love Actually became so synonymous with Christmas as it wasn't originally meant to be a festive flick.\n\nHe said: \"When I first started the movie it wasn’t set at Christmas then I love Christmas movies so I thought I’ll make a Christmas movie, but it didn’t occur to me that it might be one of those Christmas movies where people actually watch it again and again and it’s a delightful surprise to me.\"\n\n10. Hugh Grant hated dancing around Downing Street to Girls Aloud\n\nOne of the best scenes from the film is when Hugh Grant dances around Number 10 to Girls Aloud's Jump.\n\nBut Richard Curtis said the actor was \"hugely grumpy\" about the scene because he wanted his character to be serious.\n\nHe said: \"He kept on putting it off, and he didn’t like the song—it was originally a Jackson 5 song, but we couldn’t get it—so he was hugely unhappy about it.\"\n\n11. Emma Thompson wore a fat suit\n\nIn order to look more frumpy Emma Thompson donned a fat suit for her role.\n\nShe also did the crying to Jon Mitchell scene a staggering 12 times in a row."
