        "text": "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nIt's interesting to note that, of the three Harry Potter novels thus far filmed, the longest on the written page has turned into the shortest on screen. This is a good thing, because it means that the filmmakers are becoming less literal and more ...\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone\n\nThe Harry Potter phenomenon - and make no mistake, it is a phenomenon - is unlike anything we have seen in recent history. Rather than being the result of clever marketing and hucksterism, Harry Potter's popularity began at the grass roots level. ...\n\nHitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The\n\nFor those who are fans of Douglas Adams' Hitchhiker's five-book \"trilogy,\" I have two words of advice: Don't Panic!

Among other things, it features gorgeously composed scenes of maggots, animal entrails, and human corpses. And, in direct contrast to Marie Antoinette, it portrays 18th century France...\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nIt's a curious thing that the best 1995 adaptation of a Jane Austen book happens to be of her worst novel. Sense and Sensibility was the author's first published work and, as is often the case with early writing efforts, displays an undeniable shal...\n\nSweeney Todd\n\nEvery December, one of the major studios brings us a musical - something to lighten the spirits and brighten the holidays.
