        "text": "Amersham (previously Agmondesham) is a market town 27 miles north west of London, in the Chiltern Hills, England. It is part of the London commuter belt.\n\nAmersham↑ is widely known because of a multinational pharmaceutical company, Amersham plc (previously known as Amersham International and originally known as The Radiochemical Centre, and acquired in 2004 by the American company General Electric), that took its name from the town.\n\nAmersham is split into two distinct areas: Amersham on the Hill, which is close to the railway station, and Old Amersham, which contains St. Mary's, a 13th century church, and several old inns.\n\nHistory[]\n\nRecords of Amersham date back to pre-Saxon times, when it was known as Agmondesham, and by the time that the Domesday book was written at around 1086 it became known as Elmodesham. The Domesday entry is as follows:\n\nGeoffrey de Mandeville holds Amersham. It answers for 7½ hides. Land for 16 ploughs; in lordship 2 hides; 3 ploughs there. 14 villagers with 4 smallholders have 9 ploughs; a further 4 possible. 7 slaves; meadow for 16 ploughs; woodland 400 pigs. The total value is and was £9; before 1066 £16. Queen Edith held this manor.\n\nQueen Edith was the wife of Edward the Confessor and sister of king Harold, and after her death in 1075 the land passed to William the Conqueror who granted it to Geoffrey de Mandeville. Amersham is linked to London by the Metropolitan Line of London Underground and is the last station on its branch of this line. Much of this line is shared with the mainline railway service, which runs from Marylebone to Aylesbury.\n\nAmersham sent two MPs to the Wikipedia:unreformed House of Commons from 1625, and was considered a rotten borough until the Reform Act 1832 stripped it of its representation. See Amersham (UK Parliament constituency) for more details.\n\nEducation[]\n\nPrimary Schools in the town include Chestnut Lane Primary, Elangeni School, Chesham Bois Church of England School, St. Mary's Church of England School, St. George's Church of England School and Woodside Junior School.\n\nSecondary schools in the town include Dr Challoner's Grammar School (a grammar school, as the name suggests) and the Amersham School.\n\nAmersham & Wycombe College is the only Further Education establishment in Amersham.\n\nSport[]\n\nAmersham has a King George's Field in memorial to King George V.\n\nSee also[]\n\nAmersham↑\n\nAmersham Museum, in the High Street\n\nRiver Misbourne, which passes through the town\n\nShardeloes, a local 18th century↑ country house\n\nRoger Moore, attended Dr Challoner's Grammar School\n\nTim Rice, born in Amersham\n\n[]\n\nAmersham News, Views & Information\n\nAmersham Town Council\n\nThe Best of Amersham ...
