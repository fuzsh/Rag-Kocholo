A home in this great area with all it offers, automatically makes you the envy of many. Now in order to make your transition as smooth and hassle free as possible Hamptons have put together this great guide which will help you choose the best schools, learn a little about planning and building control, read tips on where to shop, eat and lot’s more, all packed into one little guide with clickable links. Perhaps most importantly we have researched some of the leading local professionals and experts who can help you add value and personalise your soon to be new home. A big WELCOME and enjoy.\n\nA little bit of history\n\nThe historic market town of Amersham has records dating from pre-AngloSaxon times and appeared in the Domesday Book of 1086. The town is split into two distinct areas; picturesque Old Amersham with its period buildings sprang up in the 17th and 18th centuries when the town prospered as part of the coaching trade, while Amersham-on-the-Hill developed around the railway station which arrived in 1892.\n\nAmersham is made up in large part of turn of the century homes, luxury contemporary apartments and townhouses, although the Old Town offers period charm with much of its original 17th and 18th century architecture surviving to this day and over 150 listed buildings.\n\nWhy move to Amersham?\n\nIt holds enduring appeal for those looking to escape the hectic pace of London life, providing a balance between rural and city living. Although there is a wealth of scenic countryside on the doorstep, the endless shopping, dining and entertainment opportunities of London are still only a short train journey away.\n\nWith a fantastic range of properties, Amersham is a great choice for those looking to buy or rent in Buckinghamshire. It is well positioned for exploring all that the county has to offer, from the nearby towns of Aylesbury and High Wycombe to the scenic landscapes of the Chilterns.\n\nThere is a bustling open-air market in the town centre each Tuesday and the historic Market Hall in the Old Town also hosts a smaller market on Saturdays. The town centre offers quality clothing brands Hobbs, Jaeger and Joules alongside high street staples Waterstones and Robert Dyas. The Hatchery Farm Shop a few miles south of the centre is a popular family-run business offering the best in sustainable organic produce.\n\nNestling in the heart of the Chiltern Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Amersham is an ideal base from which to explore the countryside with a network of footpaths and cycling routes. In the winter, see the sculptural shapes of beech, oak and ash; in the spring walk through bluebell woods and later enjoy the bright green of new leaf, in the summer walk or cycle in the shade cast by woodland and in autumn kick up piles of red and orange leaves; and at any time emerge from the woods and marvel at the rolling hills and fields stretching out below.\n\nAttractions include the Memorial Gardens which, each year form a vibrant centrepiece in Amersham Town’s Britain in Bloom entry which has been awarded Gold five years in succession. Just outside the Memorial Gardens a large illustrated town map explains historical features of the town.This can be downloaded at www.amershamsociety.org. The recently expanded Amersham Museum is a real gem with many hands-on experiences for children throughout. St Mary’s Church has a free guide explaining features in the 11-14th century building including a rich collection of monuments in the Drake Chapel which is open every Sunday from11.30-12.30 and at other times by arrangement with the parish administrator.\n\nEstablished where a roman road crossed the river Misbourne, Amersham is listed in Domesday Book (1086). King John sold the right to hold a market in 1200 and the width of the High Street set out at this time allowed for cattle and sheep pens on market days. Amersham was sufficiently important in the Middle Ages that it sent two burgesses to the early Parliaments around 1300. This right lapsed soon afterwards but was re-asserted in 1624. As a result until 1832, while Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds had no MPs, Amersham had two! The Drake family bought all the houses where residents had the vote so they could oblige their tenants to vote for them. As a result there were no contested elections; it was a ‘pocket borough’ controlled by the Drake family.\n\nwww.visitbuckinghamshire.org\n\nFAMOUS RESIDENTS\n\nAmersham and the surrounding area has been a home to rockstars, celebrities, athletes, academics, artists and common or garden members of the upper-crust for generations. Here are a few notable names you may or may not know..\n\nKaty Brand, Actress/Writer Bill Pertwee, Actor\n\nSimon Church, Wales international Footballer, born in Amersham and attended Amersham School\n\nPaul Foot, Comedian, born and raised in Amersham\n\nCindy Gallop, advertising chief turned adult industry entrepreneur, born in Amersham\n\nEddie Howe, Newcastle United manager, born in Amersham\n\nDamien Lovelock, Australian musician, lead singer of The Celibate Rifles"
