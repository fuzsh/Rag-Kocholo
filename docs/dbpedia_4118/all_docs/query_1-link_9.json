        "text": "Reopened in summer 2017 after a major refurbishment & expansion. Its medieval hall house is now more clearly visible for visitors to see and enjoy.\n\nBased largely in a medieval hall house, Amersham Museum explores life in the town in 1580, 1775, 1892, 1939 and 1964. Sit at the Tudor dinner table, relax in the 1930s living room, or listen to stories in Ron Haddockâ€™s 1960s record shop. Visit our changing exhibition programme, join a guided walk, take part in an activity session, or wander through our medicinal herb garden. Amersham is an independent museum and registered charity, run almost entirely by volunteers.\n\nPostcode\n\n49 High Street, Amersham, Bucks HP7 0DP\n\nFacilities & accessibility\n\nGroup visits by arrangement. Guided walks around the town Sundays, from Easter to the end of October.\n\nMore info\n\nhttps://amershammuseum.org/"
