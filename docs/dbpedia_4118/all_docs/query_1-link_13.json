Each year surplus income is distributed to a number of mainly local charities and good causes. To date some £16 million at today’s prices has been donated.\n\nPlease note: Only assistance dogs are allowed in the village. Bekonscot is a no-smoking / no-vaping site.\n\nWe only accept card payments. If you cannot pay by card please contact us to discuss alternatives."
