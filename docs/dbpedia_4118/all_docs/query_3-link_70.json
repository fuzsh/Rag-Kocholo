        "text": "This charming old town in the Misbourne Valley (Buckinghamshire), has a spacious High Street, lined with elegant Georgian houses, timbered framed inns and old thatched cottages. This road forms part of the main route running East to West through the old town, which was once an important staging post on the route from Aylesbury to London, during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. Many of the old coaching inns still remain, including the Crown Hotel (shown on the left below), which featured in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral.\n\nAmersham Market Hall © TAB\n\nAt the end of the High Street stands the lovely 17th-c brick and stone Market Hall, built by Sir William Drake, Lord of the Manor. A small market is still held under its fine arches on certain days of the week. Between the Market Hall and The Broadway is the town's main Market Square.\n\nOther buildings of importance included the old grammar school (still in use) and a group of Drake's almshouses with a cobbled courtyard, which are still used today to provide affordable housing for those Amersham residents in greatest need.\n\nAmersham Parish Church and Garden of Remembrance © TAB\n\nThe 12th-c parish church of St. Mary's was restored in 19th-c and has many fine brasses and monuments. Adjacent to the church is the beautifully laid out Garden of Remembrance. A lovely place to sit and enjoy the town's peacefully surroundings.\n\nAmersham is set in the heart of the Chiltern countryside and is an ideal base for local walks, especially along the banks of the Misbourne.\n\nJust to east of the town lies the picturesque village of Chenies, home of the 15th-c Chenies Manor, the ancestral home of the Earls of Bedford, before they relocated to Woburn.\n\nFor further details of the town and its facilities see the Visit Amersham website. The website provides information about events, activities, dining, shopping, and more.\n\nMap of Amersham"
