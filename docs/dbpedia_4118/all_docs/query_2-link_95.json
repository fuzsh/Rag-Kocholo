        "text": "Women from Chesham who have made a difference locally\n\nChesham Museum decided to look back and tell you about just a few of the local women whom they think have made a significant contribution locally, nationally and even internationally, and who have also made a difference to the standing of women.\n\nMargaret Mee (nee Brown)\n\nBy 1960 exhibitions in Sao Paulo, Rio and London had established her as a brilliant new botanical artist. She and Greville developed a deep concern for the Amerindian peoples, the Amazon Forest and its wildlife. She lived among the tribal peoples of the forest and endured tremendous hardships. She was awarded Brazil’s Order of The Southern Cross.\n\nIn November 1988, Mee’s Amazon Exhibition premiered at Kew and a collection of her diaries was published. She returned to England and was killed in a car accident in Leicester in 1989.\n\nCaroline Franklin\n\nCaroline was co-opted onto this committee along with Lady Verney, and she served on it until her death in 1935. She became a member of the school management committee of Chesham and a governor of Amersham Grammar School. She took a special interest in domestic training in schools for girls and was Chairman for many years of the Bucks Association of Girl Guides.\n\nHer special care and concern was for the wellbeing of the children of Chesham and for all the residents of Chartridge. Thanks to the Franklin’s generosity, Chartridge came to possess a reading room and village library; it ran sports teams and flower shows. Chartridge formed a Nursing Association in partnership with The Lee and Caroline encouraged the setting up of the Women’s Institute.\n\nCaroline worked quietly to give an equal chance to women in education and social life although she took no part in the women’s suffrage movement. During her last years she gave a home to a number of Jewish refugees from Germany. Caroline Franklin died in 1935.\n\nMildred Wheeler, B.E.M.\n\nIn 1969 she was awarded the British Empire Medal “for service to the community, particularly with regard to the St. John Ambulance Brigade in Chesham”. Mildred ran the Medical Comforts Depot until 1971 and died in 1986.\n\nBessie Bangay\n\nLady Susan Trueman, O.B.E. (nee Byng)\n\nLady Susan campaigned to get women into the police force and was Chairman of the Bucks Nursing Federation. She was awarded the OBE in 1920 and in May 1921 became the first woman JP in Buckinghamshire.\n\nReverend Margaret Hall (nee Phillips)\n\nBy 1992 Margaret was Deacon of St. John the Evangelist in Ashley Green. The Church of England voted to allow women to be fully ordained as ministers in 1992 and Margaret was finally ordained in April 1994 at All Saints, High Wycombe. She retired at 60 and joined St. Michael’s Church, Amersham-on-the-Hill. She died in February 2008.\n\nAvis Joan Parsons (nee Hearn), M.M.\n\nAround 2pm the air raid sirens sounded and the staff were told to take cover. Hearn refused and carried on passing information from the plotters onto the control room. For the next 20 minutes Poling was bombed by Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive-bombers. Hearn remained at her post even though the telephone lines were cut.\n\nThe officer commanding Poling, Flight Lieutenant Bayley recommended Hearn for the immediate award of the Military Medal. The recommendation was endorsed by Air Chief Marshal Dowding (AOC-in-Chief Fighter Command) and Hearn was invested with her medal by King George VI at Buckingham Palace in March 1941. Avis died on March 27th 2008.\n\nThis article is a modified form of an article published in the Bucks Free Press, Amersham and Chesham edition."
