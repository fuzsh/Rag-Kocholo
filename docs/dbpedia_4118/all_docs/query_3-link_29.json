        "text": "Chiltern Open Air Museum in Chalfont St. Giles, Buckinghamshire was founded by volunteers in 1976, and opened to the public in 1981. The Museum is a charity that rescues threatened historic buildings, which would otherwise be demolished, and rebuilds and preserves them in a traditional Chilterns landscape. Just 7 minutes drive from junction 17 of the M25, the Museum is a rural haven within easy reach of London and the home counties. Our Museum is suitable for all ages.\n\nThis building is a prefabricated church - referred to as the ‘little tin church’, although it is made from wood and clad in iron. The building was located in the small hamlet of Henton in the parish of Chinnor, Oxfordshire.\n\nChiltern Open Air Museum offers a multitude of experiences and activities for the kids as well as the rest of the family.\n\nOur site is 45 acres and includes a working historic farm with sheep, goats, cows, chickens and ducks. We have a number of traditional gardens, a ‘Dig for Victory’ allotment and woodlands - so there is plenty of places to discover and explore. We also have an adventure playground where children can let off some steam.\n\nWe have 37 historic buildings for you to explore. Our buildings are filled with real objects, so you can find out how people lived and worked in the past.\n\nThere are plenty of opportunities to dress up, play with historic toys and games, build models of our barns and lots of space to run around and discover. Have a go at trying on WW1 uniforms, hats and pinnies, Victorian hats, accessories and more. Remember to share your selfies with us on Instagram using #chilternoam\n\nOur wide-ranging learning programme is enhanced by our unique setting and features workshops in prehistory, history, English, and science.\n\nWe hold the prestigious Sandford Award and Learning Outside the Classroom Quality Badge.\n\nAt certain times of year, our workshops and theme days are heavily oversubscribed so we recommend contacting us well before your preferred date to secure a booking.\n\nWe have an extensive events programme full of exciting re-enactments, heritage craft demonstrations and family activities.\n\nWe offer a wide range of workshops and experience days for those looking to learn more about traditional crafts and/or improve their wellbeing.\n\nOur sessions are led by our seasoned team of experts, each experience is designed to provide a memorable and educational encounter.\n\nDonations, regardless of their size, play a crucial role in supporting our mission, enabling us to uphold our conservation efforts and maintain our role as a vital community asset. Your support ensures the continuity of our work and helps us remain an integral part of the community.\n\nAs an independent charity, our Museum relies on the generosity of individuals like you. Our buildings need continually looking after and all funds raised are invested back into the Museum. Your contribution, whether big or small, ensures the continuous enjoyment of this unique space for everyone. If you're a UK taxpayer, please choose to Gift Aid at the checkout, this will amplify your admission, membership or donation by an additional 25% and will give us us a vital bit of additional income at no extra cost to you.\n\nThank you for being a vital part of our mission to maintain the Museum's special place in history and community."
