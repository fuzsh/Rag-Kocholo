There is a working historic farm with Old English goats, chickens, cows and Oxford Down sheep.\n\nAs well as a collection of historical buildings the Museum boasts a number of small traditional gardens that complement the buildings and suit their time periods. These include a formal Arts and Crafts garden, a pretty cottage garden, and a ‘dig for victory’ allotment next to the 1940s prefab. The cherry and apple orchards are full of heritage varieties, and the woods are carpeted with bluebells in spring.\n\nThe variety of historic buildings and close proximity of the museum to Pinewood Studios and London makes the Museum a popular filming venue. The site has been used for filming Downton Abbey, Horrible Histories, Grantchester, The Suspicions of Mr Whicher, Midsomer Murders, Call the Midwife and many more.\n\nThe Museum has an award winning education program and holds popular educational, themed craft and activity days for families every Tuesday within Bucks school holidays.
