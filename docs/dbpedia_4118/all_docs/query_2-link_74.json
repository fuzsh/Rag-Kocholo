I regularly attend courses and spent a year as a student at the Newlyn School of Art.\n\nA Selected member of Bucks Art Society.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nExhibiting regularly with local art groups and galleries as well as in London, including the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition 2019, Dulwich Picture Gallery, Highgate Literary and Scientific Institute , Green&Stone, Chelsea. &The Collective Gallery, St Albans.\n\n​\n\nInstagram- kartinm125"
