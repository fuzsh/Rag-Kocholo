For families, book an afternoon of river dipping or gardening or give archery a go.\n\nThe summer holidays are jam-packed with games and experiences in Bucks, Berks and Oxfordshire. Give new (and old) sports a go at places like Cliveden, Hughenden, Waddesdon and Basildon Park. The Little People, BIG DREAMSÂ® exhibition and trail at Stowe Gardens encourages kids to be bold, be brave and dream big. Or travel back in time to explore history and heraldry amongst the medieval ruins at Greys Court.\n\nBasildon Park has a long association with TV and film as one of the National Trust's most popular filming locations. See the mansion and garden on Season Three of Bridgerton, streaming now, and glimpse behind the scenes on location at Basildon Park in Visions Unreel. The exhibition takes you on a journey from Netherfield Park in Pride and Prejudice 20 years ago, to more recent showcases in The Crown and The Gentlemen. The exhibitions is on now.\n\nVictorian Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli was a master at curating his own image. He used myths to craft his public persona and navigate the complex worlds of belonging, identity and relationships. Hughenden was stage and backdrop to his performance. Find out how in a new exhibition in the manor."
