        "text": "Barn Meadow Recreation Ground is in Amersham, Buckinghamshire. It’s located behind the High Street, on school lane. I swear I remember drinking and messing about in this park during my teens. It was a slightly different experience taking a toddler along! We’d actually been to do a review of Amersham Museum which is just around the corner (click here for the review), but I wanted to make a bit more of a day of it so we popped into Barn Maadow Recreation Ground for a little play. There are separate sections that are suitable for younger and older kids.\n\nThe younger kids’ playground\n\nThis section has two main bits of equipment; a wooden train / slide combo and a metal play frame. There’s also a little house, swings and a weird up and down roundabout type thing. When we visited it was really muddy and some of the equipment was just on grass rather than rubber flooring. Also all of the space between equipment is grass. All together that means, in winter, it’s a bit of a mud factory. The train in particular was really bad as there was a massive puddle at the foot of the steps. Not that Smallest Child let that bother her.\n\nThe metal play frame is designed for children slightly older than her (she was 2 1/2 when we visited) so she needed some help getting up. Once she was up she was mostly ok except for a guiding hand across the rope bridge. The roundabout is very odd. There are four seats as as you spin around you also go up and down slightly. She enjoyed it but even just pushing it around made me feel slightly giddy!\n\nThe older kids’ playground\n\nThis park really is very good for older kids. Probably aged 6+ but right up to teenagers. In fact there were a couple of tweenagers (maybe older, I can never tell) playing when we arrived.\n\nThere is an activity trail with a bridge, stepping stones and obstacles etc. Then there’s the main, massive play frame. It’s got loads of raised platforms with monkey bars, nets and rope bridges between them. There are scramble nets to get onto the platform and two slides at the end. I didn’t let Smallest Child go on it because I’d never be able to get her down again. The boys would absolutely love it and I’d take them back in the summer to try it out. There’s also a see saw, swings and a broken zip line.\n\nThere’s also the Barn Meadow Recreation Ground as a whole to play in. It’s a nice space for playing football etc.\n\nOur Barn Meadow Recreation Ground Review\n\nWhen it’s not muddy I think this has the potential to be a really good park for a variety of ages. There are bits which are a bit shabby and could do with some TLC but the kids never notice that! Not convinced by the roundabout thingy though!\n\nAdmission Cost\n\nFree\n\nParking / How to Get There\n\nOn-street parking. There was a little car park at the back of the park but I’m not sure if the public can park there.\n\nAddress – Pondwicks, Amersham, Buckinghamshire HP7 0ER\n\nToilets\n\nNone of site as far as I could see\n\nFood\n\nNothing on site but you could bring a picnic"
