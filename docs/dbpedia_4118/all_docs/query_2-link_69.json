        "text": "Open-air museums exhibit rescued historic buildings, providing them with valuable sanctuary whilst offering the visitor a chance to learn more about architecture and (usually) the local area. Many of these museums also take the opportunity to illustrate the sort of garden that would have accompanied the building in its original location: this post looks at some of these gardens.\n\nThe Weald & Downland Living Museum\n\nThe pinnacle of garden creation and display in a museum of buildings is almost certainly the Weald & Downland Living Museum, in Sussex. With over fifty relocated buildings, it also hosts seven gardens showing the evolution of gardens from the fifteenth to nineteenth centuries, and the associated move from purely functional planting to increasing amounts of decorative plants. Until 18th August 2024, the Museum also hosts an exhibition on the history and creation of the gardens.\n\nThe first period gardens were introduced in 1983. A historian advised on historically appropriate plans – and plants – for the gardens, and they were created by the Museum’s newly-appointed Head Gardener. As advised here:\n\nEach garden represents the period and social status of the house to which it is attached, with each garden containing the herbs, vegetables and plants that would have met the needs of the rural household.\n\nThe gardens are explored here in broadly chronological order, starting with Bayleaf Farmhouse. Most have new garden-specific interpretation boards onsite.\n\nBayleaf Farmhouse\n\nBayleaf Farmhouse is an example of a ‘Wealden’ house, dating from the early fifteenth century (with later fifteenth century alterations). A timber-framed hall-house, it was dismantled in 1968 and reconstructed at the Museum in 1972. The garden was installed in 1987, and recreates a late-mediaeval garden, with blocks of beds. An interpretation board onsite advises that the dimensions of the plot are measured in perches, as the unit a yeoman farmer would have been familiar with, and that the herbs, fruit and vegetables planted are drawn from two mediaeval sources, and used for eating, strewing, and flavouring ale. Three small woodland areas nearby have been planted with trees and shrubs found in the ‘shaws’ of the house’s original location.\n\nHouse from Walderton\n\nThe house from Walderton has at its core a fifteenth-century timber-framed building with an open hall, and a flint and brick exterior (including chimney) dating from its rebuilding in the seventeenth century, though the mediaeval roof was retained. It is thought that the house was divided into two dwellings in the eighteenth century, when a second chimney was added; one of these dwellings was derelict from about 1930. The house was dismantled in 1980 and re-erected at the Museum in 1982.\n\nAs noted onsite, the garden is intended to reflect an early seventeenth-century garden, with a focus on ‘vegetables, fruit, herbs and livestock’, but also ‘plants grown for their aesthetic qualities’; the wider range of vegetables available meant that ‘the older practice of cultivating edible weeds declined’.\n\nPendean Farmhouse\n\nPendean Farmhouse is a ‘timber-framed house of the three-cell lobby entry type, with an internal axial chimney stack and back to back fireplaces’, a successor to the earlier open hall houses. Built in 1609, at a point of transition between mediaeval and modern architecture, it retains some mediaeval features, such as unglazed windows. Split into two cottages in the late eighteenth/early nineteenth century, it was later returned to a single farmhouse. It was dismantled in 1968 and reconstructed in 1976.\n\nThe garden re-creates that of a yeoman farmer’s family in this period, including herbs, vegetables, and, again, plants grown for their aesthetic qualities. The herbs were for medicinal purposes, for culinary and ‘gruiting’ (flavouring ale), and strewing. The vegetables were different to those grown on the adjoining farm, and included salad crops and onions.\n\nPoplar Cottage\n\nDating from the mid-seventeenth century, Poplar Cottage is a ‘wasteland cottage’, namely ‘a landless, or near-landless, cottage built either on a wayside verge or as an encroachment on common land’. Its fireplace is in a smoke bay, ‘an intermediate stage of development between the open hall, in buildings such as Bayleaf and full chimneys in houses like Pendean’. The house was dismantled in 1982 and reconstructed in 1999.\n\nWhilst the original occupant would have survived through use of the adjoining common, by 1839 the cottage had 26 perches of land, and this is the size of garden which has been recreated at the museum. The garden’s primary focus would have been food production and medicinal or strewing herbs. As noted onsite, ‘few, if any, plants would have been grown purely for their aesthetic value’, though the overall effect today is certainly delightful.\n\nTindalls Cottage\n\nBuilt in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, Tindalls Cottage was dismantled in 1974 due to the construction of the Bewl Bridge Reservoir; it then remained in store until it was re-erected in 2012. The house is named after one of the early families to live in it, who farmed 26 acres. Today, the garden is somewhat overgrown.\n\nThe Toll House\n\nThe Toll House was the first historic garden created at the Museum. The house itself was built in 1807 at the same time as a new road, to allow the collection of tolls. It was dismantled in 1968, and re-erected in 1970, the year the Museum was founded. The related garden contains fruit, vegetables, herbs and flowers\n\nWhittaker’s Cottages\n\nWhittaker’s Cottages are a pair of cottages built in the 1860s. They were dismantled in 1987 and re-erected in 1997. The Victorian garden includes a small cottage garden immediately in front of the house, with primarily decorative plants, and a larger vegetable patch to the side, planned on a three-year rotation. To the rear is a compost heap.\n\nThe Chiltern Open Air Museum\n\nThe Chiltern Open Air Museum, in Buckinghamshire, opened in 1981. It rescues historic buildings, and ‘rebuilds and preserves them in a traditional Chilterns landscape’. It too has ‘a selection of traditional gardens, meticulously designed to complement the specific periods of the buildings’. Since my last visit in 2020, an Iron Age herb garden has been installed, which must surely be the earliest garden type in an open-air museum. Other properties on the site with gardens are not of quite the same vintage, but, again, are addressed here in ascending order of ‘age’.\n\nAstleham Manor Cottage\n\nAstleham Manor Cottage is a timber-framed hall house relocated from Middlesex. Built in the sixteenth century, it was later modified, before being relocated in 1913 in response to the construction of the Queen Mary Reservoir. In the 1990s, it was moved again – to its current site – due to proposed gravel extraction. Its garden is the largest of the Museum’s cottage gardens, and was inspired by Gertrude Jekyll’s designs:\n\nThe garden features a meticulously planned geometric layout using pergolas, rose arches, and paving, embodying a structured yet less formal planting style. To evoke Jekyll’s aesthetic, numerous heritage plant varieties grace the garden….\n\nLeagrave Cottages\n\nLeagrave Cottages started out as an eighteenth-century barn in Bedfordshire, being transformed into two cottages in the 1770s. Listed, the cottages were nevertheless granted consent for demolition in 1982, having been deemed unfit for human habitation. Happily, they were however re-erected at the Museum in the 1990s, and a cottage garden developed, with an apple tree to reflect the garden’s original description as ‘apple tree yard’.\n\nHigh Wycombe Toll House\n\nBuilt in 1826, though no longer in use for its original purpose by 1867, the High Wycombe Toll House was damaged by a lorry in 1974, and dismantled in 1977-78. Finally restored in 1990, it is now flanked by another of the Museum’s cottage gardens.\n\nHaddenham Cottage\n\nHaddenham Cottage is constructed from witchert, a blend of limestone, straw and water. Originally built in the 1830s, its reconstruction was completed in 2015, and required significant learning and development, as a witchert house ‘had not been built since around 1939’. The garden was added in 2020, with flowers and shrubs on one side, and a vegetable and herb garden on the other; a fernery was incorporated in 2023.\n\nAmersham Prefab\n\nThe Amersham Prefab (Universal House Mark 3 design) was originally erected in 1947. The estate on which it was sited was being redeveloped for more permanent housing, and it was taken to the Museum, officially opening in 1994. It now has its own 1940s-style garden, with lawn, roses, and vegetable-growing area, and a Dig for Victory allotment nearby, growing traditional vegetable varieties.\n\nOther Open-Air Museums with Gardens\n\nOther open-air museums do not perhaps have quite as many gardens, but there is usually at least one to be found. The Black Country Living Museum, in Dudley, was established in 1975, and has a particular focus on the area’s industrial heritage. The Toll House (operational from the 1840s to the 1870s) has a functional but still charming garden, as does ‘Jerushah’, or the Tilted Cottage, where the garden plot reflects the original occupants’ vegetable growing and pig-keeping. The cottage was constructed around 1840, tilting thereafter due to mining-related subsidence. It was reconstructed at the Museum in 1987.\n\nAvoncroft Museum, in Worcestershire, opened in 1967, and is England’s first open-air museum. Various buildings (the Town House, Tollhouse, 1940s Prefab and Nailer’s Cottage) ‘have domestic gardens planted and maintained in the appropriate fashion of their times’). Avoncroft also has a garden building, in the form of the Tong Castle ice house.\n\nHaving opened in 1891, Skansen, in Stockholm, is the world’s oldest open-air museum, ‘showcasing the whole of Sweden with houses, animals and traditions from every part of the country’ – and of course some gardens. The Herb Garden was created in 1892, and altered a few times since. The Skåne Farmstead garden recreates a rural garden of the 1920s, and includes some of the plants from the original site. The Skogaholm Manor garden has a formal component, with stone terraces and parterres, and a particularly charming kitchen garden, comprising two sections lined with fruit trees and berry bushes, and a summerhouse. Skansen also hosts allotments, a rose garden, and a number of smaller gardens associated with buildings on the site.\n\nBack in England, the Museum of the Home takes a chronological rather than geographical or building-specific approach to its gardens. Based in early eighteenth-century alms-houses, the site was acquired by London County in 1911, primarily to enable its gardens to be preserved as available open space. The alms-houses opened as a museum in 1914, with an original focus on furniture, and later a chronological display of living rooms. The herb garden and a range of period gardens were established in the 1990s, the latter showing ‘how city gardens have developed over the centuries’. They include a sixteenth-century knot garden, with a design inspired by that on an oak cupboard in the collection, and a seventeenth-century ‘functional and practical garden’, allowing both the growing of vegetables and herbs, and the undertaking of household tasks such as laundry. An eighteenth-century ‘leisurely and neat garden’ is more of a focus for recreation and entertainment, whilst a nineteenth-century ‘bold and colourful garden’ reflects the growth of interest in gardening. The informal ‘cottage style garden’ reflects the early twentieth-century interest in the Arts and Crafts movement, whilst the twenty-first century roof garden reflects a growing desire for access to gardens in urban environments.\n\nConclusion\n\nGardens in open-air museums are not exactly historic: they are new, reflect the wider scholarship available, and the knowledge and resources onsite. Given that they also mostly relate to small, vernacular properties, they can be quite similar across the periods being illustrated, and even the most rigorous are not always best placed to fully illustrate evolving garden styles. Nevertheless, they add significantly to the understanding and ambience of the properties in question, offer a chance to see a range of heritage plant varieties up close and personal, and are generally very attractive in their own right: they are certainly a most welcome addition."
