        "text": "Silverstone, now best known for its racing circuit, lies at the heart of the ancient forest of Whittlewood on the Northamptonshire-Buckinghamshire border. There is an academic explanation why forest communities took up craft manufactures like lace, but we’ll not go into that here. Certainly Silverstone was a lace village until the late nineteenth century.\n\nJohn Edward Linnell (1842-1919) grew up in Silverstone, or ‘Silson’ in the local parlance. Years later, when serving as vicar of Pavenham near Bedford (another lace village), he wrote an account of his childhood. Linnell came to holy orders by a round-about route and his memoirs are more robust than one might expect from a Victorian clergyman. While many of his peers repressed the rough games that characterised rural popular culture, Linnell commemorated them. He was also interested in more aesthetic pursuits such as ballad singing. One of the singers he mentions was a lacemaker, Sall, who kept house with her brother Simon, the sexton. We quote this section in full, including a verse of one of Sall’s songs. The pair\n\nlived in a large, lone, thatched cottage that stood on the edge of an orchard. They always had a wood fire on the hearth of their living-room, and half-way up the top of the wide, open chimney hung flitches of bacon and hams, which had been sent by their wealthier neighbours to be smoked and dried. Around a window that opened from the chimney-corner into the garden there were built into the wall a number of old Dutch tiles said to have once belonged to a mansion that had vanished from Silson centuries back, possibly the royal residence I have already mentioned. The shelves were loaded with the choicest of old china, while here and there hung a time-stained print depicting a battle-scene. When I was a boy, it was one of my greatest delights of my life to drop in on them of a winter’s night, when the wind was howling among the trees outside and the sparks were flying up the chimney to lose themselves in the darkness above, and hear them tell their stories of bygone days. It was a picture many an artist would have loved to paint. Simon used to sit on a low, flag-bottomed chair, his body bent forward over the hearth so that he could better replenish the fire. Sall, with her lace pillow before her, would jangle her bobbins and place her pins with her long, bony fingers in the light of a tallow candle whose rays passed through a tall water-bottle and fell softly on her parchment. The two knew all the legends and traditions of the countryside, and it’s from them I gleaned many of the incidents I now relate sixty years after.\n\nSir Walter Scott once declared that nothing was more dramatically effective than an old murder ballad. With anyone like Sall to recite it, I can well believe him. The murderer, the victim, the grave, and the hanging were brought before our eyes as the verses fell from her lips. To the ordinary reader the following lines would seem mere jingle: —\n\n‘One lonely night, as I sat high,\n\nInstead of one there two pass’d by.\n\nThe boughs did bend, my soul did quake,\n\nTo see the hole that Fox did make.’\n\nTo her they presented part of a tragedy more real than Macbeth’s to lovers of Shakespeare, though the heroine was only a humble serving-maid. She, it seemed, had arranged to meet her lover by moonlight in a spinney near her master’s house. First at the trysting place, she climbed a fir-tree to give the laggard a fright when he should appear. After a long wait she heard footsteps and voices and, looking down, saw her lover enter the glade accompanied by a man carrying a spade. Not daring to speak, she watched them while they dug a deep hole just beneath her. Then the truth dawned on her; she was to be murdered, and it was her grave they were digging. At last their task was finished, and the villains impatiently awaited her arrival. But they were to be disappointed, for, though trembling in every limb with terror, she did not reveal her presence. Eventually they departed, and she descended the tree, fled back to her master’s house, and told what she had seen. An alarm was raised, her lover, Fox, whose name seemed well suited to his character, was arrested, confessed to his evil intentions, and was hanged. ‘An’ sarve him right!’ Simon would grunt, when Sall had left him swinging ‘from the gallows tree so high.’[1]\n\nWhen Linnell’s memoirs appeared posthumously in 1932, this particular verse had already been recorded from lacemakers on several occasions, and now it has its own entry in the Roud Folksong Index as RN17769. It was frequently identified as a ‘lace tell’. A report in The Leighton Buzzard Observer for 4 April 1893 explained that\n\none of the most curious features in connection with this trade was the songs of the lacemakers, known locally as lace tells, or lace tellings. These consisted of doggrel [sic] verses which remind one very forcibly of the nursery ditties that delight the juvenile mind. The proficiency of the worker was estimated by the number of pins stuck in a given time, and the singing of these tells assisted the counting and kept them together. These songs possess no merit as literary productions, if such they may be called, but they form a remarkable and interesting survival of a condition of things which has practically passed away. We give a few of the more striking.\n\n‘Nineteen miles as I sat high,\n\nLooking for one as he passed by;\n\nThe boughs did bend, the leaves did shake,\n\nSee what a hole the fox did make!\n\nThe fox did look, the fox did see,\n\nDigging a hole to bury me;\n\nI saw one that ne’er saw me,\n\nI saw a dark lantern tied to a tree.’\n\nThe allusion here is to an intended murder. A young man wishing to rid himself of his sweetheart had determined to take her life; and, with the intention of hiding all traces of the crime, he busied himself with digging her grave near the spot where they were to meet. He was turned from his wicked purpose by observing some person either up a tree or standing behind him.[2]\n\nThis lace tell was also noted by Thomas Wright, among others.[3] It is one of the few tells for which we possess a tune because the folksong collector Fred Hamer (the husband of the lace teacher Margaret Hamer) recorded a version from a Mrs White of Cranfield in Bedfordshire.[4]\n\nLace Tells were often cut down and mashed up versions of longer ballads, and the implication of Linnell’s account is that the entire narrative was sung. However, no full version of the story in ballad form has been discovered in tradition.[5] So it is more likely that this verse was meant as a sung element in a longer prose narrative, what is known as a ‘cante-fable’.\n\nThe whole story, including the verse, has also been recorded on a number of occasions, the first in James Orchard Halliwell’s Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales in 1849. This book has a complicated publishing history: it was the sequel to the author’s Nursery Rhymes of England which first appeared in 1842, although the verse about ‘the hole the fox did make’ only appeared in the 1846 edition of that title.[6] Both verse and story were said by Halliwell to have been obtained in Oxfordshire.\n\nMany years ago there lived at the University of Oxford a young student, who, having seduced the daughter of a tradesman, sought to conceal his crime by committing the more heinous one of murder. With this view, he made an appointment to meet her one evening in a secluded field. She was at the rendezvous considerably before the time agreed upon for their meeting, and hid herself in a tree. The student arrived on the spot shortly afterwards, but what was the astonishment of the girl to observe that he commenced digging a grave. Her fears and suspicions were aroused, and she did not leave her place of concealment till the student, despairing of her arrival, returned to his college. The next day, when she was at the door of her father’s house, he passed and saluted her as usual. She returned his greeting by repeating the following lines:\n\nOne moonshiny night, as I sat high,\n\nWaiting for one to come by,\n\nThe boughs did bend; my heart did ache\n\nTo see what hole the fox did make.\n\nAstounded by her unexpected knowledge of his base design, in a moment of fury he stabbed her to the heart. This murder occasioned a violent conflict between the tradespeople and the students, the latter taking part with the murderer, and so fierce was the skirmish, that Brewer’s Lane, it is said, ran down with blood. The place of appointment was adjoining the Divinity Walk, which was in time past far more secluded than at the present day, and she is said to have been buried in the grave made for her by her paramour.[7]\n\nEven in the versions given so far one can see that the verse was more stable than the story that explains it. In the one Sall told to Linnell the would-be assassin ended on the gallows, in the Olney version he was discovered and fled, while in the Oxford version he murders the girl but not at the place and time he had planned. In another version, sent in to Notes and Queries in 1887 by Thomas Ratcliff of Worksop, the servant girl lured by her false lover to the woods is so frightened by the grave she sees him digging that she falls in a faint from the tree, and this in turn frightens off the would-be murderers.[8]\n\nWe’ll give this agglomeration of stories the general title ‘One Moonshiny Night’, as used in Notes and Queries, to distinguish this group from a variety of other traditional tales that feature a young woman who accidentally learns that her suitor plans to murder her and later confronts him with this knowledge. In folklore studies the generic title for this plot type is ‘The Robber Bridegroom’, tale type number ATU 955. It is an enormously popular narrative, with variants found in many cultures.[9] It is has also inspired many writers, including Eudora Welty’s 1942 novella The Robber Bridegroom and, more relevant to lacemakers, Henri Pourrat’s four volume novel Gaspard des Montagnes (1922-1931). (Pourrat’s literary output drew heavily on his career as a folklorist around Ambert: his most forthcoming narrators were lacemakers.)[10] The best known English version is ‘Mister Fox’, which John Brickdale Blakeway (1765-1821) wrote from memory, having been told it in his youth by a great-aunt, and sent by him to the Shakespearean scholar Edmond Malone (1741-1812). Malone then included it in his notes to the play Much Ado About Nothing. Why? Because it elucidates the line Benedick says to Claudio Act 1 Scene 1: ‘Like the old tale, my lord: it is not so, nor ‘twas not so; but, indeed, God forbid it should be so’, the very words the murderer Mister Fox says to his would-be victim, Lady Mary, when she challenges him with her knowledge of his plans.[11] However, while the name ‘Mister Fox’ would imply some connection to ‘One Moonshiny Night’, the verse itself does not occur in Blakeway’s version… and any further pursuit of the relationship between these narratives will take us too far from our lacemakers’ tell.\n\nThe popularity of the verse must owe something to its diffusion in printed form. The first one that we have found appears in The Trial of Wit or, A New Riddle Book, published in Glasgow in 1782 and reprinted there in 1789 and 1795. Here the verse is presented as a riddle:\n\nAs I went out in a moonlight night,\n\nTo keep from harm I took the height,\n\nI set my back against the moon,\n\nI look’d for one and saw two come.\n\nThe boughs did bend the leaves did shake,\n\nI saw the hole the Fox did make.\n\nIt was a maid had a sweetheart whose name was Fox: she saw him and another come to make her grave, while she sat on a tree.[12]\n\nThe same riddle appeared in Tom Thumb’s Royal Riddle Book for the Trial of Dull Wits, printed at Falkirk in 1788, and then again in Stirling in 1801.[13] It is not implausible that there were many other editions of these riddle books, in England, Ireland and North America as well, but it is also possible that copies were carried to these regions from Scotland by ‘flying stationers’. Such small books were printed to be sold by pedlars; they were ephemeral and few have survived. It is unlikely that the story or the verse originated in these pamphlets because the effect of the riddle depends entirely on some pre-existing knowledge of the narrative. Nonetheless, the existence of print versions may have had a mnemonic effect.\n\nThe verse is in the first person, spoken by the intended victim. In most full versions of the story she uses this elliptical account of her experience to inform her would-be murderer that she has discovered his plan. Only the assassin would understand the meaning of her words. Choosing this riddle form to confront him is not necessary to the plot, but such circumlocutions are a common feature of oral cultures. In face-to-face communities people, especially the relatively weak like servant maids, had to be careful how they spoke. They therefore developed the art of delivering their message in forms that were opaque to those who were not involved, and inoffensive to those who were. Texts were meaningful to those in the know, but apparent nonsense to outsiders. Their incomprehensibility, ‘a mere jingle’ to quote Linnell, was intentional.\n\nThe riddle is a typical example of such genres that create a bond of shared understanding between insiders while remaining obscure to outsiders. Lace tells are another. As Gerald Porter explains, in performance as a lace tell the frame story that makes sense of the verse disappears: the identity of the speaker and the diggers, and the relationship between them is unclear. Yet the whole narrative remained implicit, completed in the minds of listeners who likely already knew it. This process creates an ‘insider group’ – in this case the lacemakers – bonded by their shared knowledge, their shared ability to interpret the riddle.[14] By speaking the riddle in the first person the lacemakers identify with the would-be victim, and here we encounter another common element to be found in the work culture of lacemakers in other countries too: men were a threat, especially strangers, and so young women had to be on their guard. Narrative and song were means to inculcate important life lessons.\n\n[1] John Edward Linnell, Old Oak: The Story of a Forest Village, ed.

His ballad version was then included in English Peasant Songs (1929). The verse also occurs in a version of ‘The Cottage in the Wood’, sung by Martin Carthy, but this was his own addition to a much better known song (Roud Number 608) about a pedlar calling at an isolated house, but which usually ends happily in a marriage: see https://mainlynorfolk.info/martin.carthy/songs/thecottageinthewood.html\n\n[6] James Orchard Halliwell, The Nursery Rhymes of England, Collected Chiefly from Oral Tradition 4th edition (London, 1846), p. 3.\n\n[7] James Orchard Halliwell, Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales (London, 1849), pp. 47-50.\n\n[8] Thomas Ratcliff, ‘One Moonshiny Night’, Notes and Queries 7th series 3, 19 March 1887, pp. 229-30.

Am I right in believing that the free maids, noticed by Shakespeare in the above passage, were lacemakers? Any information on this subject will oblige\n\nOver the next few months we intend to do our best to belatedly satisfy his interest, but we’ll start with the articles in Notes and Queries which prompted and responded to Beisly’s letter. In its nineteenth-century heyday, Notes and Queries was a meeting point for antiquarians, literacy scholars and budding folklorists. In fact the term folk-lore was coined in 1846 by the journal’s founding editor, William Thoms. In 1868, folksong collecting was not an established field of endeavour in England, unlike Scotland. The first English folk-song revival would have to wait for the turn of the century. But there were a few Victorian enthusiasts connected by journals like Notes & Queries, and of course the Shakespearean reference helped, for it provided folk-songs with their letter of literary nobility. Who could dismiss what the bard himself had deigned to notice?\n\nThere are two elements of Shakespeare’s depiction that are borne out by these nineteenth-century correspondents. Firstly, lacemakers had an established taste for old songs, even at the beginning of the seventeenth century when the trade was relatively new in England. Secondly, they had a penchant for the tragic and ghoulish, for the song the Feste sings in response to Duke Orsino’s injunction, starts:\n\nCome away, come away, death,\n\nAnd in sad cypress let me be laid….\n\nWe would hazard that the clown’s song may be part of a longer narrative ballad, but if so we have not been able to discover which one. However, it was just such ballads — narrative in structure, presumed old in date, heart-rending in content — that excited the interest of nineteenth-century song collectors.\n\nMost of the information on lacemakers’ songs in Notes and Queries precedes Beisly’s intervention. In the edition of 4 July 1868 ‘J.L.C’ of Hanley Staffordshire inserted the following note (We have not been able to identify J.L.C., presumably he was not the genealogist Joseph Lemanuel Chester, a regular contributor under these initials, as he grew up in America):\n\nA LACEMAKER’S SONG. — When I was a child, rising six years, my Northamptonshire nurse used to sing the following ditty to me as she rattled her bobbins over her lace-pillow:\n\n“It rains, it rains in merry Scotland;\n\nIt rains both great and small,\n\nAnd all the schoolboys in merry Scotland\n\nMust needs to play at ball.\n\nThey tost their balls so high, so high,\n\nThey tost their balls so high,\n\nThe tost them over the Jews’ castel,\n\nThe Jews they lay so low.\n\nThe Jews came up to Storling Green:\n\n‘Come hither, come hither, you young sireen,\n\nAnd fetch your ball again.’\n\n‘I will not come, and I dare not come\n\nWithout my schoolfellows all,\n\nFor fear I should meet my mother by the way,\n\nAnd cause my blood to fall.’\n\nShe showed him an apple as green as grass,\n\nShe gave him a sugar-plum sweet;\n\nShe laid him on the dresser board,\n\nAnd stuck him like a sheep.\n\n‘A Bible at my head, my mother,\n\nA Testament at my feet;\n\nAnd every corner you get at\n\nMy spirit you shall meet.’”\n\nThis is a version of the Ballad of ‘Sir Hugh’, or ‘The Jew’s Daughter’ (Child 155, Roud 73, for the folk-song aficionados), an example of the anti-Semitic accusation of ritual murder which, it appears, originated in medieval England before spreading to Europe and beyond with horrific consequences, unfortunately not altogether relegated to the past. But for the moment we will concern ourselves only with the ballad, which tends to emphasise the murder rather than the ritual part of the story, at least as it was sung by lacemakers.\n\nLacemakers plural, because J.L.C.’s was not the first version of ‘The Ballad of Sir Hugh’ to appear in Notes and Queries. In the edition of 15 October 1853, C. Clifton Barry had asked “Why does not some one write a Minstrelsy of the Midland Counties”, before observing that the material was just as rich, and oddly akin to the ballads of Scotland (which were far better known even south of the border, thanks to the publishing endeavours of Walter Scott, James Hogg, William Motherwell, David Herd, Peter Buchan and many others). This Scottish tincture he had noticed in Gloucestershire and Warwickshire in versions of the drunken cuckold song ‘Our Goodman’ (Child 274, Roud 144) and the infanticide ballad ‘The Cruel Mother’ (Child 20, Roud 9). In response ‘B.H.C.’ (almost certainly Benjamin Harris Cowper, a biblical scholar, born in Wellingborough in 1822) wrote in on 24 December 1853 with the following:\n\nTHE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH, ETC.\n\nThe fact mentioned by your correspondent C. CLIFTON BARRY, at p. 357., as to the affinity of Midland songs and ballads to those of Scotland, I have often observed, and among the striking instances of it which could be adduced, the following may be named, as well known in Northamptonshire:\n\n“It rains, it rains, in merry Scotland;\n\nIt rains both great and small;\n\nAnd all the schoolfellows in merry Scotland\n\nMust needs go and play at ball.\n\n“They tossed the ball so high, so high,\n\nAnd yet it came down so low;\n\nThey tossed it over the old Jew’s gates,\n\nAnd broke the old Jew’s window.\n\n“The old Jew’s daughter she came out;\n\nWas clothed all in green;\n\n‘Come hither, come hither, thou young Sir Hugh,\n\nAnd fetch your ball again.’\n\n“‘I dare not come, I dare not come,\n\nUnless my schoolfellows come all;\n\nAnd I shall be flogged when I get home,\n\nFor losing of my ball.’\n\n“She ‘ticed him with an apple so red,\n\nAnd likewise with a fig:\n\nShe laid him on the dresser board,\n\nAnd sticked him like a pig.\n\n“The thickest of blood did first come out,\n\nThe second came out so thin;\n\nThe third that came was his dear heart’s blood,\n\nWhere all his life lay in.”\n\nI write this from memory: it is but a fragment of the whole, which I think is printed, with variations, in Percy’s Reliques. It is also worthy of remark, that there is a resemblance also between the words which occur in provincialisms in the same district, and some of those which are used in Scotland; e.g. whemble or whommel (sometimes not aspirated, and pronounced wemble), to turn upside down, as a dish. This word is Scotch, although they do not pronounce the b any more than in Campbell, which sounds very much like Camel.\n\nCowper does not say that the singer was a lacemaker, but we can probably infer this from his later contributions to Notes and Queries. For example, on 22 December 1855, he returned to this ballad:\n\nTHE BALLAD OF SIR HUGH.\n\nIn Vol. viii., p. 614., six verses of this ballad will be found contributed by myself. In replay to inquiries since made, I have received six verses and a half additional. I copy these from the original MS. of “an old lacemaker, who obliged me with these lines,” as my informant says. I have corrected errors of orthography and arrangement. For the sake of the variations I copy the whole.\n\n“It rains, it rains, in merry Scotland,\n\nBoth little, great and small;\n\nAnd all the schoolfellows in merry Scotland\n\nMust needs go and play at ball.\n\n“They tossed the ball so high, so high,\n\nWith that it came down so low;\n\nThey tossed it over the old Jew’s gates,\n\nAnd broke the old Jew’s window.\n\n“The old Jew’s daughter she came out;\n\nWas clothed all in green.\n\n‘Come hither, come hither, you young Sir Hugh,\n\nAnd fetch your ball again.’\n\n“‘I dare not come, nor will I come,\n\nWithout my schoolfellows come all;\n\nAnd I shall be beaten when I go home,\n\nFor losing of my ball.’\n\n“She ‘ticed him with an apple so red,\n\nAnd likewise with a fig:\n\nShe threw him over the dresser board,\n\nAnd sticked him like a pig.\n\n“The first came out the thickest of blood,\n\nThe second came out so thin;\n\nThe third that came the child’s heart-blood,\n\nWhere’er his life lay in.\n\n“‘O spare my life! O spare my life!\n\nO spare my life!’ said he:\n\n‘If ever I live to be a young man,\n\nI’ll do as good chare for thee.\n\n“‘I’ll do as good chare for thy true love\n\nAs ever I did for the King;\n\nI will scour a basin as bright as silver,\n\nTo let your heart-blood run in.’\n\n“When eleven o’clock was past and gone,\n\nAnd all the schoolfellows came home,\n\nEvery mother had her own child,\n\nBut young Sir Hugh’s mother had none.\n\n“She went up Lincoln and down Lincoln,\n\nAnd all about Lincoln street,\n\nWith her small wand in her right hand,\n\nThinking of her child to meet.\n\n“She went till she came to the old Jew’s gate,\n\nShe knocked with the ring;\n\nWho should be so ready as th’ old Jew herself\n\nTo rise and let her in.\n\n“‘What news, fair maid? what news, fair maid?\n\nWhat news have you brought me?’\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n. . . . . . .\n\n“‘Have you seen any of my child to-day,\n\nOr any of the rest of my kin?’\n\n‘No, I’ve seen none of your child to-day,\n\nNor none of the rest of your kin.’”\n\nI am very anxious to complete this ballad from Northamptonshire; and I again renew my request that some of your correspondents will endeavour to supply what is deficient. The “old lacemaker” would have given more, but she could not. The pure Saxon of this ballad is beautiful.\n\nCowper got no answer to his request until J.L.C.’s entry in 1868 jogged the memory of Edward Peacock (1831-1915) of Bottesford Manor, near Lincoln. He supplied a full version of the ballad from a Mr W.C. Atkinson of Brigg, Lincolnshire (who had previously published it in The Athenaeum of 19 January 1867, though whether he heard it or discovered a manuscript or print version is not clear). This fills in some of the elements of the narrative: the mother calls her son and his body miraculously speaks, enabling her to find it hidden in a “deep draw-well.” In other versions bells ring and books read themselves as the body is transported. Peacock explained in his article that the ballad bears some relation to events that occurred in 1255 in Lincoln, when the Jews of that city were accused of the ritual murder of a Christian boy, Hugh son of Beatrice, the future ‘Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln’. Nineteen members of the Jewish community would be executed in consequence. The story occurs in three contemporary chronicles, as well as in an Anglo-Norman ballad, and would be referred to in Chaucer’s ‘The Prioress’s Tale’. It is only one of several medieval child saint legends of a related kind (William of Norwich, Robert of Bury St Edmunds, Harold of Gloucester…). Yet while the story was old, there is no record of this particular ballad text until Thomas Percy printed a copy, supposedly from a Scottish manuscript, in his Reliques of Ancient English Poetry: Consisting of Old Heroic Ballads, Songs, and Other Pieces of our Earlier Poets (1765). Thereafter, the ballad has been recorded frequently, in Scotland, England, Ireland and the United States; it has 295 entries in the Roud Folksong Index, the source of the Roud numbers given in this article (and available online at the Vaughan Williams Memorial Library a mine of information on everything related to folk music). The modern ballad differs considerably from the medieval saints’ legends, not least in the primary role played by a woman as siren and murderer.\n\nLacemakers continued to sing this song while making lace well into the later nineteenth century, for Thomas Wright (1859-1936) of Olney, in The Romance of the Lace Pillow (1919) recorded versions from Weston-under-Wood and Haddenham, both in Buckinghamshire, which were used as lace tells in the lace schools. This is the text of one he gave in full.\n\nTHE JEWESS MAIDEN.\n\nThere was a Jewess maiden, or so my story states,\n\nWho beckoned to a little boy who peeped between her gates.\n\nAn apple so red, a plum so sweet, she gave him from her tree;\n\nShe dazzled his eyes with a garry gold ring that was so fair to see.\n\nAnd when she got him in the gates she laughed, he knew not why,\n\nAnd uttered many wicked words and told him he must die.\n\nShe laid him on the dresser board, no mercy then she showed,\n\nBut stabbed him with a knife and stabbed until the life-blood flowed.\n\nWright emphasised that lacemakers’ songs and tells, particularly those from Buckinghamshire, “abound in allusions to coffins, shrouds, corpses, bones, lightning flashes, sardonic laughter, hyena-like cries, and other lurid, gruesome, clammy or grizzly terrors”. The next lacemakers’ song to appear in Notes and Queries makes his point very aptly.\n\nJ.L.C.’s reference to the ballad of ‘Sir Hugh’ prompted Cowper to return to the theme of lacemakers’ songs in Notes and Queries of 19 September 1868.\n\nLACEMAKERS’ SONGS: “LONG LANKIN.”\n\nForty years ago, when in Northamptonshire, I used to hear the lacemakers sing the now well-known ballad of “Hugh of Lincoln” (“It rains, it rains,” etc.) Another, which I have never seen in print, but which I happen to have in MS., is “Long Lankin,” of which I send a copy. Like the damsels whom Shakespeare represents as “chanting” the song which the Clown proceeds to sing (in Twelfth Night, Act II., c. 4), the equally “free maids” of my childhood’s days often chanted, rather than sung, as they sat in rows “in the sun” or in the “lace-school,” an institution which is perhaps effete. But Shakespeare’s lacemakers made “bone lace,” and not “bobbin lace,” with which only I am acquainted. I could perhaps remember some few other ditties which the lacemakers used to sing, though my impression is that they were often mere childish nursery rhymes like “Sing a song of sixpence.” Such probably was one which began in this way:\n\n“I had a little nutting-tree,\n\nAnd nothing would it bear\n\nBut little silver nutmegs\n\nFor Galligolden fair”\n\nof which I recollect no more, but that, as a little boy, I used to tell them to say “nutmeg-tree,” which they obstinately refused to do. By-the-way, there was a long piece about “Death and the Lady,” which the “free maids” used to chant. This exhausts my present reminiscences so I shall proceed to give you “Long Lankin”: —\n\n“Said my lord to his lady as he got on his horse.\n\n‘Take care of Long Lankin, who lives in the moss.’\n\nSaid my lord to his lady as he rode away,\n\n‘Take care of Long Lankin who lives in the clay.\n\nThe doors are all bolted, and the windows are pinned,\n\nThere is not a hole where a mouse can creep in.’\n\nThen he kissed his fair lady as he rode away;\n\nFor he must be in London before break of day.\n\nThe doors were all bolted, the windows all pinned,\n\nBut one little window where Lankin crept in.\n\n‘Where’s the lord of this house?’ said Long Lankin.\n\n‘He is gone to fair London,’ said the false nurse to him.\n\n‘Where’s the lady of this house?’ said Long Lankin.\n\n‘She’s in her high chamber,’ said the false nurse to him.\n\n‘Where’s the young heir of this house?’ said Long Lankin.\n\n‘He’s asleep in his cradle,’ said the false nurse to him.\n\n‘We’ll prick him, we’ll prick him all over with a pin,\n\nAnd that will make your lady come down to him.’\n\nThey pricked him, they pricked him all over with a pin,\n\nAnd the false nurse held a basin for the blood to drop in.\n\n‘O nurse! How you sleep, and O nurse how you snore!\n\nYou leave my son Johnson to cry and to roar!’\n\n‘I’ve tried him with suck, and I’ve tried him with pap;\n\nCome down, my fair lady, and nurse him in your lap:\n\nI’ve tried him with apple, and I’ve tried him with pear;\n\nCome down, my fair lady and nurse him in your chair.’\n\n‘How can I come down, it’s so late in the night,\n\nAnd there’s no fire burning, or lamp to give light?’\n\n‘You have three silver mantles as bright as the sun;\n\nCome down, my fair lady, all by the light of one.’\n\n‘Oh! spare me, Long Lankin, spare me till twelve o’clock!\n\nYou shall have as much money as you can carry on your back.\n\nOh! spare me, Long Lankin, spare me one hour!\n\nYou shall have my daughter Nancy, she is a sweet flower.’\n\n‘Where is your daughter Nancy? she may do some good;\n\nShe can hold the golden basin to catch your heart’s blood.’\n\nLady Nancy was sitting in her window so high,\n\nAnd she saw her father as he was riding by:\n\n‘O father! O father! don’t lay the blame on me;\n\nIt was the false nurse and Lankin who killed your lady.’\n\nThen Lankin was hung on a gallows so high,\n\nAnd the false nurse was burnt in a fire close by.”\n\nTo the best of my recollection this copy is not quite complete, and it was sung with occasional ad libitum variations, as “Sally” or “Betsy” for Nancy. It is probable that inquiry in the lace-making districts would produce copies of other old ballads.\n\nReaders will probably be familiar with ‘I had a little nut tree, nothing would it bear’ (Roud 3749). ‘Death and the Lady’ (Roud 1031) was a commonly encountered ballad — or rather ballads, for there are a number of different texts that share a very similar theme. It had often appeared on broadsides from the seventeenth century onwards, and was framed as a dialogue between a fine lady and Death, in which the certainty of the grave, and the judgement beyond, is gradually forced on the former. The final verse in the version supplied by Lucy Broadwood’s English Traditional Songs and Carols (1908) returns us to subtitle of this website:\n\nThe grave’s the market place where all must meet\n\nBoth rich and poor, as well as small and great;\n\nIf life were merchandise, that gold could buy,\n\nThe rich would live — only the poor would die.\n\n‘Long Lankin’ (Child 93, Roud 6) had also previously appeared in Notes and Queries for 25 October 1856, when M.H.R. asked for information about the ballad ‘Long Lankyn’ “which is derived by tradition from the nurse of an ancestor of mine who heard it sung nearly a century ago in Northumberland”. Lankin (or Lamkin, or Lammikin, or Beaulampkins, or Lambert Linkin, or Bold Rankin… he goes by many names) is a particularly ghoulish ballad, frequently recorded in the English (and Scots) speaking world. In longer versions of the ballad the eponymous villain is a mason who builds a castle for a nobleman, who subsequently forgets to pay his bills. Perhaps because of its brutality, commentators have often speculated on a medieval origin, but in fact the earliest recorded version, ‘Long Longkin’ was noted from one of his female parishioners by the Reverend Parsons of Wye, near Ashford in Kent, and sent to Thomas Percy of Reliques fame in 1775. Another version appeared the following year in the second edition of David Herd’s Ancient Scottish Songs, Heroic Ballads etc.\n\nNeither ‘Sir Hugh’ nor ‘Long Lankin’ were only, or even primarily, sung by lacemakers. There were part of the common ballad culture of the English and Scots speaking world in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, if not before. It may be worth mentioning that Thomas Percy, who wrote Reliques of Ancient English Poetry while vicar of Easton Maudit in Northamptonshire, close to local centres of lace-making, nonetheless never mentions the penchant of lacemakers for old songs. However, there are some good reasons why the contributors to Notes and Queries should associate these type of songs specifically with lacemakers. The practice of singing while lacemaking was noted by several commentators after Shakespeare. For instance, Thomas Sternberg (probably Vincent Thomas, 1831-1880, who grew up in Northampton and was later librarian of Leeds Library), in his The Dialect and Folk-Lore of Northamptonshire (1851) wrote under the entry ‘Lace-Songs’ that “Lace making is almost always accompanied with singing”.\n\nOne might imagine that before machines drowned out the human voice and commercial recorded music became ubiquitous that practically all work, and many other human activities, were accompanied by song. However, from the evidence available, this was not the case. Some occupations in England were frequently associated with singing — they include carters and shoemakers, as well as Shakespeare’s trio of spinners, knitters and lacemakers — but no such association was made with carpenters, blacksmiths or dressmakers. This is not to say that there were not melodious blacksmiths or lyrical carpenters, but that singing was not commonly thought to be an inherent part of their work. A blacksmith’s repertoire would be individual, whereas lacemakers’ was an expression of their collective identity. Hence Sternberg use of the term of “lace-songs”: he associated a particular repertoire with this manufacture. Lacemaking was not so arduous that it prevented the simultaneous use of the lungs, and as pillows were portable it was often done in company, so that singers had both an audience and an accompaniment. And in lace schools, songs or “tells” were used as part of the training process, a topic we’ll return to in a later post. This occupational tradition explains why it was logical for Cowper to suggest that “inquiry in the lace-making districts would produce copies of other old ballads”.\n\nBut why these blood-soaked songs in particular? Both ‘Sir Hugh’ and ‘Long Lankin’ are about the murder of a child, specifically the long drawn out death by blood letting. And although the perpetrators might be punished, in lacemakers’ versions the emphasis is very much on the butchering of Hugh and Johnson rather than the retribution that might follow. It is particularly striking that in three cases the contributors to Notes and Queries cited children’s nurses as their original source, especially so in the case of ‘Long Lankin’ where a treacherous nurse is the murderer’s accomplice. Perhaps, like lullabies (think of ‘Rock-a-bye Baby’), these songs were a cathartic release of the repressed resentment felt by servants against the object of their attentions — weak but demanding, dependant but socially superior. Mothers too could feel that children were burdens, a topic we’ll return to in a future post about lacemakers and infanticide. Is it possible that resentment also underlay lacemakers’ performances of ‘Sir Hugh’? Lacemakers were frequently working ten-hour days, if not more, by the age of six: perhaps they were not that sympathetic towards schoolboys playing football. Again it is worth noting that it is a male child who is killed, while in the case of ‘Long Lankin’ the female child survives. We last see Nancy, or Sally, or Betsy, sitting at her window, exactly where, in contemporary descriptions, we find lacemakers working. Perhaps the substitute names allowed different girls to express their own frustrations against their mothers, the person who had set them to lacemaking, and their siblings, and especially brothers whose situation, even if not petted and spoiled, was probably less restricted than lacemakers.\n\nGerald Porter argues that in lace tells “the theme of child death is implicit, and this relates it [the tell] to a large group of songs in which labor and early death are linked.” Lacemakers sang about child death, while their own autonomy and even their health was being sapped by the very process in which they were engaged. Singing at work is very much part of “the romance of the lace pillow”: the “free maids” sitting in the sun outside a cottage door; but the actual content of lacemakers’ repertoire of songs undercuts this idyll. No doubt singing was a moment of freedom, of “fancy” (as some recent scholars of work-song express it), when imagination was allowed to wander in very different circumstances to those of lacemaker. But in a culture where even looking up from the pillow might be punished, songs might also express a rage that could find no other outlet.\n\nFurther Reading: from Notes and Queries.\n\nClifton Barry, ‘Notes on Midland County Minstrelsy’, Notes and Queries, 1st series VIII (October 1853), pp. 357-8.\n\nB.H.C., ‘The Ballad of Sir Hugh, Etc.’, Notes and Queries, 1st series VIII (December 1853), p. 614.\n\nB.H.C., ‘The Ballad of Sir Hugh.’, Notes and Queries, 1st series XII (December 1855), pp. 496-7.\n\nJ.L.C., ‘A Lacemakers’ Song’, Notes and Queries, 4th series II (July 1868), p. 8.\n\nEdward Peacock, ‘A Lacemaker’s Song’, Notes and Queries, 4th series II (July, 1868), pp. 59-60.\n\nSidney Beisly, ‘Lacemakers’ Songs’, Notes and Queries, 4th series II (August 1868), p. 178\n\nB.H.

Her father, Rudolph Lehmann, had been editor of Punch and, briefly, liberal MP for Harborough. The Lehmanns, originally from Germany, were an artistic dynasty: two of Rosamond’s great-uncles were painters, an aunt was a composer, one sister became an actress and her brother was editor of the influential periodical New Writing. The Curtis family, protagonists of her third novel Invitation to the Waltz (1932), are of a rather different background, a settled rural manufacturing dynasty whose fortune derives from paper mills. Nonetheless, Lehmann modelled this fictional household on her own. The lead character, Olivia Curtis, is a portrait of the novelist as a young woman, indicated by her frequent flights of imagination. The novel is set in 1920, and opens on Olivia’s seventeenth birthday; it relates her anticipation of, and then participation in, the dance held by the local gentry family, the Spencers.\n\nThe Curtises know the Spencers but are not intimate with them. They are separated by fine but significant class distinctions: for instance Olivia and her older sister Kate do not ride, they cannot be ‘county’. Attracted and intimidated by the manners of the upper classes, Olivia experiences trepidation, embarrassment but also an occasional intimacy in her contacts with her social superiors. She is also sensitive to the barriers that separate her from the labouring population of the village. The first part of the novel consists of various encounters in which class distinctions are performed – with the dressmaker Miss Robinson, with the impertinent children of the sweep, and with the household servants. Olivia cannot readily assume the character of superiority that she knows is expected of her. Her awkwardness can develop into fear, even hatred. A tacit element in this antagonism is potential rivalry for the attentions of men, given the decimation caused by the War. These tensions underlie her interview with the lace girl.\n\nFashion and dress play a large part in the novel. They are the means by which Olivia and Kate establish their independent identities (though in the case of Olivia, her vision for herself is only partially fulfilled). But when it comes to lace, Olivia is forced to renounce her individuality, symbolized by her own plans for her ten bob birthday present, and assume a social role. Lehmann paints a plausible portrait of lace-selling at the tail-end of the handmade lace industry, when even the philanthropic lace associations were becoming moribund. However, her lace girl has imbibed many of those associations’ ideas about the values implicit in lace. She is careful to distinguish her products as ‘real lace’, as opposed to the machine-made alternative one might buy at Evans for a tenth of the price. She appeals to Olivia’s connoisseurship, or rather the connoisseurship that a real lady should possess, but Olivia does not. She attempts to establish a personal relationship with the Curtises, who as local notables and employers really ought to patronize the lace industry. She invokes the family values of domestic manufacture through her ability to support and comfort her invalid mother. Yet all the time one is aware that the lace-girl is relying on the philanthropy of the well-to-do. Almost in passing she mentions her hardships, her misfortunes: Olivia is obliged to part with her ten shillings, and she bitterly resents it. However, middle class status has its compensations as well as its responsibilities. The scene ends with Olivia expecting a (servant cooked and laid) meal: the matchstick legs of the lace-girl suggest she may not be getting any lunch.\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nRosamond Lehmann, Invitation to the Waltz.

She has just returned home after visiting the dressmaker in Little Compton, when she encounters the maidservant Violet in the hall.]\n\n‘Please, Miss Livia, there’s a young person to see you.’\n\n‘To see me?’\n\n‘Well, she wanted the one or the other of you. Madam’s out and I couldn’t find Miss Kate. So she said she’d wait.’\n\n‘Is it one of the Miss Martins?’\n\n‘Oh no, it’s a young person. Carries a case. I don’t know what she’s come after. I showed her into the servants’ ‘all. Will you see her?’\n\n‘Yes, I suppose so.’ How queer.\n\nViolet disappeared, returned, said coldly: Come this way please; and grudgingly made way for a short slight girl of about twenty, dressed neatly and shabbily in a fawn hat and coat, and carrying a suit-case.\n\n‘Good morning’, she said. Her voice and smile anticipated antagonism.\n\nShe was a rather pretty anaemically pink-and-white girl with small regular features, blue circles round her eyes, and an appealing air of goodness.\n\nOlivia said nervously:\n\n‘Do sit down.’\n\nShe sat on the edge of a chair, laid her case down, and spoke in a modest and genteel voice.\n\n‘I’ve brought a few things to show you – some of my work – thinking you might be interested. Are you interested in lace? – handmade?’ She smiled brightly.\n\n‘I’m afraid I’m… I don’t know anything about it.’ Olivia’s heart sank. She blushed deeply.\n\n‘Well, if I might just unpack my case. Real lace is so nice, I think, don’t you? It looks nice on anything. And of course it’s quite a rarity these days.’\n\nShe knelt on the floor, opened her case, and began to rustle about swiftly, with tiny narrow hands, among sheets of tissue-paper.\n\nNow was the moment to say it was no good, that one didn’t want any lace, had no money with which to buy it. Oh, cruel fate! Any other day that would have been true. To-day Uncle Oswald’s ten-shilling note seemed to crackle audibly in her pocket, refusing for its late master’s sake to be denied.\n\nNow was the moment to enquire searchingly into her credentials. She feebly ventured:\n\n‘Did you make it yourself?’\n\n‘Oh yes all myself,’ said the girl softly, lightly. Clearly she was gaining confidence. Not often could she have had such an auspicious start. ‘You see, I have my mother to keep. She’s a total invalid, of course – paralysed; so not being able to go out to work I took up lace-making. This is my biggest piece – a bedspread.’ She unfolded it, held it up in both arms. ‘It took me six months, this did.’\n\n‘Did it really?’\n\nAnd instead of coldly glancing before handing it back, one found oneself examining it, murmuring sympathetically:\n\n‘Doesn’t it tire your eyes?’\n\n‘Oh yes, they get ever so strained. That’s the worst of it. My eyes aren’t strong, and if they were to give out, well, I don’t know where we’d be.’ She gave another bright smile. ‘Of course I have my regular customers, but his time of year I go round and try to earn a bit extra, just to get Mother some little comforts for Christmas. It’s for her I do it. It isn’t very nice really to have to go round – you know what I mean. You feel you come at an awkward time and – it’s ever such a drag and –‘\n\n‘Yes, it must be.’ Picture of door after door being shut in her face by haughty parlour-maids. ‘How awful for your mother.’\n\n‘Yes, and she’s ever so patient – never a grumble. This is a little tea-cloth. You can’t have too many tea-cloths, can you? A table set – centre-piece and six mats. These little mats are all the rage now, aren’t they? — so much daintier than a tablecloth. A nightdress case. Some little traycloths – they’re nice. A set of doylies…’\n\n‘They’re beautiful… But I’m rather afraid they wouldn’t be quite what I… not very much use…’\n\n‘Not for Christmas presents? She was gently surprised.\n\n‘Well, yes, of course. Only, as a matter of fact I haven’t really started to think about Christmas yet.’\n\n‘Hadn’t you? I always think with Christmas shopping it’s best to get it done in good time, don’t you? Then it’s off your mind.’\n\nThe case was nearly empty now. Olivia said suddenly, with a show of firmness:\n\n‘I believe it would be best if you could call again later – after lunch, perhaps – when my mother’ll be in. I’ll tell her. I’m sure she’d like to… She’d know better than me.’\n\n‘I’m afraid I couldn’t do that.’ Her voice was gentle but decided. ‘I’ve a long way to go.’\n\n‘Yes, I suppose you have.’\n\nShe saw through that all right.\n\n‘Oh, this insertion will interest you. For trimming underwear. In different widths. Ladies always like my insertion. It’s strong, yet dainty.’\n\n‘I don’t wear lace on my underclothes, I’m afraid.’\n\n‘No – really?’ She raised her eyebrows, politely shocked, incredulous.\n\n‘No, I don’t like it.’\n\nFirmer and firmer. Silence fell.\n\n‘A little collar.’ She took the last package from the case and placed it upon a chair; with hesitation, with a sudden collapse of assurance.\n\nSilence again. She knelt on the floor among a litter of white paper, lace and linen, her hands loosely folded in her lap, her head drooping. Then slowly she started to fold up the bedspread, then the teacloth, the centre-piece, to smooth out the tissue-paper, to put everything back in the old suit-case; with meek gestures, with silent disappointment folding up, laying away her unwanted handiwork.\n\nIt was too much. Olivia picked up the collar.\n\n‘This is very pretty.’\n\nThe girl glanced up.\n\n‘Yes, it’s a nice little collar. It’s so uncommon.’ She went on packing.\n\n‘I think I’d like… It would be so useful. How much is it?’\n\nShe paused, then said:\n\n‘It’s fifteen and six, that one.’\n\n‘Fifteen and six! Oh, I’m afraid I can’t then – I’ve only got ten shillings – at the moment.’\n\nAnd quickly, for fear of being suspected again, she drew her purse from her pocket, opened it under the girl’s nose, and extracted its sole contents – the ten-shilling note.\n\n‘There’s a lot of work in this collar. You can see for yourself.’\n\n‘I know.’ Hope sprang up again. The miserable offer was to be rejected. ‘I’m so sorry. I can’t…’\n\nThe girl continued reflectively:\n\n‘Still – I might make you a special price – as you’re a new customer. I’ll let it go for ten shillings.’\n\n‘Oh, will you? Well thank you very much. That’s splendid.’\n\nThe girl took the note, put it in a large black handbag, thanked her politely, without warmth, and went on packing. Suddenly she said with decision:\n\n‘I’d have liked you to have had the tea-cloth. You’d pay double the price for it in any shop.’\n\n‘No, thank you, I couldn’t. I’m afraid I must go now.’\n\nToo late, she felt all the necessary resolution.\n\nThe girl closed and strapped the suit-case, got up, lifted it with a slight effort.\n\n‘I hope it’s not too heavy for you.’\n\n‘It is a bit heavy.’\n\nAnd perhaps no lighter by the end of the day… Dragging herself home late at night… A weak voice from the pillow, whispering anxiously: ‘Well?… Brokenly answering: Only one collar…\n\n‘Come out this way.’\n\nShe opened the front door. They smiled faintly at one another. The girl said with restraint:\n\n‘Thank you very much.’\n\n‘I do hope you’ll be able to get plenty of – of comforts for your mother.’\n\n‘Yes. Thank you.’\n\nWhatever they were, surely ten shillings would buy a certain amount of them.\n\n‘Good-bye.’\n\n‘Good morning.’\n\nShe went down the steps and along the drive, hobbling on irritating matchstick legs, one puny shoulder pulled down by the weight of the suit-case.’\n\n[… A little while later Olivia shows her purchase to her older sister Kate.]\n\n‘Like to see what I’ve bought with my ten bob?’ cried Olivia; and she flung down the collar upon the table.\n\n‘Good Lord, what’s that?’ Kate held it up by one corner.\n\n‘Isn’t it pretty?’\n\n‘Where on earth —?’\n\nThere was nothing for it but to tell the whole story.\n\n‘Lumme!’ said Kate. ‘So that’s what that foul Violet came flouncing up here for. I hid.’\n\nShe spread the collar out upon the table and was silent, examining it.\n\n‘Don’t you think it’s rather nice?’\n\nIt was looking its worst somehow: exactly as if it ought to be thrown on the fire.\n\n‘How much did she rook you?’\n\n‘Ten bob.’\n\n‘The whole lot?’\n\n‘Yes. She reduced it for me.’\n\nAfter a pause, Kate said:\n\n‘What’ll you do with it?’\n\n‘Oh, put it on some frock, I suppose. It’s bound to come in somehow. Real lace always does.’\n\nFaintly Kate’s nostrils dilated, but she said nothing. This was more bad luck than downright folly, and she could sympathize. Yet Olivia felt her pretences snatched away, Kate’s finger pointing the way inexorably to surrender, to truth. She said suddenly:\n\n‘Don’t tell Mother.’\n\n‘Of course not.’\n\n‘Bang goes my whole income.’\n\nKate nodded, murmured:\n\n‘Sickening.’\n\n‘I’ll give it to Nannie for Christmas. She’ll love it.’ She giggled, blinked back a tear. ‘Little will she guess what I’ve spent on her. She’ll think it came from Evans, one and eleven three.’\n\n‘Perhaps it does,’ said Kate, busy with paper and pins.\n\n‘Don’t be absurd. It’s handmade. You can see it is… Can’t you?’\n\n‘I don’t know.’\n\n‘Well, how does one tell?…’\n\nAll supports cracked together. She threw up her hands, fell.\n\n‘Do you think –’ Kate spoke with unwonted hesitation – ‘she can have been – could it have been a swizz?’\n\n‘Of course not. She was awfully sort of superior. And all that about her mother. She couldn’t have made that up.’\n\n‘I suppose not,’ agreed Kate, starting to cut out.\n\nOlivia sat down and meditated upon the transaction. I never disliked any one so much, she thought. The worst was the lack of gratitude. Ten shillings snatched by compulsion, stuffed into her black bag, sitting there quiet and avid as a spider, then asking for more… asking for more. No, she was not pathetic. She was sinister.\n\nShe picked up the collar and threw it into the corner.\n\n‘It’s not as bad as that,’ said Kate.\n\nOlivia yawned.\n\n‘Lord, I’m hungry! It’s been a full morning.’\n\nLacemakers do not often appear in archives. They had no guild, no trade union, no history of labour militancy, and so did not generate the kinds of paper trails that allow for historical research. The British Newspaper Archive (www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk), an online word-searchable library of 477 regional and national newspapers dating from the eighteenth to the mid-twentieth century, is therefore a great boon. In its pages we can find accounts of lacemakers going about their business. Of course, newspapers tend to concentrate on the grim side of life, and the most frequent mention of lacemakers is either as victims or as perpetrators of crimes.\n\nEllen Barratt, a seventeen-year-old lacemaker from Aspley Guise in Bedfordshire, died of starvation on 30th March 1856. She and her two sisters had been beaten and otherwise abused by their mother and an older sister, while forced to make lace for fourteen hours a day. The case caused a furore, and its details were covered not just by the local papers but also across the country and even abroad. The horror expressed by all those involved – the coroner, the doctor, the judge – all indicate that the treatment visited on the Barratt sisters was exceptional. Nonetheless one can learn something about conditions in the trade more generally from this rare opportunity to visit the interior of a lacemaking household. For example, although the quantities of food given to the Barratt sisters were abnormally small, the types (gruel, hasty pudding, bread and dripping, scalded toast…) were probably common elements in the diet of lacemakers. We also learn that the sisters were expected to produce 1 yard and 2 feet of narrow lace a day, and that, although they themselves received none of the rewards, their mother got 6d a yard for narrow lace, and 8d for wider bands. Thus we can calculate that, if the girls finished their work, they could earn 5 shillings a week (on the basis of 84 hours labour). No wonder one contemporary writer talked about sacrificing children to ‘the Moloch of lace’.\n\nBelow are three reports from The Bedford Mercury in 1856, taken from the British Newspaper Archive, covering the coroner’s inquest on Ellen Barratt which recorded a verdict of manslaughter and indicted her parents, the committal proceedings against her elder sister Elizabeth, and the trial of all three.\n\n“SATURDAY, APRIL 5, 1856. ASPLEY GUISE. HORRIBLE CASE OF STARVING TO DEATH”\n\nAn Inquest was held at the Steamer beershop at Aspley on the 1st of April, before W. Wiseman Esq., deputy coroner for the Honor of Ampthill, on the body of Ellen Barratt, about 12 years old, who was found dead in bed on the 30th ult. The evidence went to prove that all the parents’ elder children were in good condition yet the younger ones were in a frightfully emaciated condition, and it appeared that this must have resulted from the parents having kept them morning, noon, and night fixed to the “lace pillow” and feeding them with gruel for breakfast, gruel for dinner, gruel for supper with an occasional modicum of bread, but no air, no exercise, no amusement, no relaxation; nothing but work, work, work, until the bodies of the poor things were wasted literally to skeletons. The Jury returned a verdict of manslaughter against the unnatural parents, and they were committed to Bedford Gaol for trial at the next assizes.\n\n“SATURDAY, MAY 24, 1856. HORRIBLE INHUMANITY AND MANSLAUGHTER OF A CHILD BY ITS RELATIVES“\n\nIt will be in the recollection of our readers, that about five weeks since, we reported an inquest held at Aspley Guise on the body of Ellen Barratt a child 12 years old, who died from starvation and neglect, and the committal of the unnatural parents for trial at the next assizes for the crime of manslaughter by the coroner’s jury. Since that event the tongue of rumour has been very busy with the case which caused further investigation, and which resulted in Superintendent Young apprehending Elizabeth Barratt, aged 29, the eldest sister, charged with being an accessory to the death.\n\nThe following evidence was adduced against her, the witnesses being her own sisters: –\n\nCharlotte Barratt, the first witness, apparently 6 or 7 years old, stated that she was 14 years of age. Her sister Ellen died on a Sunday morning about 5 o’clock, March 30; she had been kept at work constantly, even up to 5 o’clock on the Saturday night, notwithstanding her complaints, and was then driven to bed without any supper, having had nothing all day, her mother beating her with her stays up the stairs because she asked for something to eat; she kept awake nearly all night, and about one o’clock in the morning made a noise; her mother came into the room and hit her, and told her to lie still; after that she moaned, but soon she attempted to sing a hymn and afterwards prayed – “Lord Jesus, let me do my work next week;” these were the last words she spoke and she died soon after. Me and my sisters were kept at work lacemaking 14 hours a day, with a quarter of an hour for breakfast and 20 minutes for dinner; that was all the stoppage or rest we had; and if we had finished our work at night we had some gruel or bread and dripping for supper; we had garden stuff or gruel for dinner, when we had any, and sometimes pudding; if our task of work was not done at night we were sent to bed without supper, and had to get up next morning and stand naked in the cold till we had finished our task, without breakfast. Mother and sister often boiled up the coffee grounds for our breakfast, and gave us a piece of bread so big (about 2 inches square); we never had as much as we could eat, nor enough; prisoner has often held us while mother beat us; she has stuffed rags into our mouths to prevent us from crying; two of my teeth have been knocked out in this way. My sister (the prisoner) has held us while my mother has put sheep-dung, cow-dung, and rabbit-dung into our mouths and even the filth from her snuffy pocket-handkerchief she has made us eat; and my sister has held us the while. We were often made to sit with our sore flesh upon nettles and thistles which were put in our chair; we never had any fire in our work room, but there was a fire in mother’s room, where she and my sister were, but if we went there we were turned out directly. I have been often beaten with nettles; we have been made to eat pig’s victuals; poor Ellen has been kept two or three days together without food, because she could not do her work; my sister always helped my mother against us.\n\nJulia Barratt, apparently about six or seven years of age, but who stated her age to be twelve, confirmed all that the last witness had said, and added that even when her mother had given her a little bit of bread, the prisoner had snatched it away from her. She had frequently been kept without food when she could not do her work, and made to stand naked in a cold room without breakfast till she had done it. She had been beaten with nettles and thistles and made to sit on them bare, and prisoner has pulled up our clothes to sit us on them, when we have had cow and other dung put into our mouths Sister has stuffed our mouths with rags if we cried out. A few days before Ellen died she had three fits and fell down. My sister picked her up and set her to work again directly. On the Friday night before she died she was sent to bed without supper, and on Saturday she had a little gruel for dinner. On Saturday night she was sent to bed without supper, and beat. She died in the night.\n\nSusannah Barratt, apparently about 14, stated her age to be 22. She had heard what her sisters had said, and it was true. She had been served in the same manner.\n\nDr Williams proved that he had made a post mortem examination of the body of Ellen Barrat. The body was remarkably small, the face small and idiotic, shrivelled and monkey like. There was no appearance of disease, but the lungs appeared as if they had not been much used. There was very little blood in the system at all. The heart was quite empty. There [sic] small quantity of blood there was, was of a watery character. The stomach contained a little gruel – not one ounce – and nothing else. I could hardly distinguish the stomach from the small intestines. It was no bigger than that of a child five years old. In my opinion overwork and insufficient nourishment, with the treatment I have heard today, would be sufficient to cause death.\n\nThis concluded the case.\n\nThe prisoner, on being asked if she had anything to say, denied the whole of the charges.\n\nThe prisoner was committed for trial.\n\nThe case on behalf of the prosecution was conducted by C.R. Day, Esq, of Woburn.\n\n“SATURDAY, JULY 19, 1856. TRIAL OF PRISONERS. Starvation to Death at Aspley Guise“\n\nSamuel Barratt, 65, labourer, Susannah Barratt, 64, his wife, and Elizabeth Barratt, 28, lacemaker, the daughter, were charged on the Coroner’s warrant with having caused the death of Ellen Barratt, at Aspley Guise, on the 30th of March.\n\nThere were other indictments for assault against the two female prisoners.\n\nMr Power presented; the prisoners were undefended.\n\nAs this case has excited a great amount of horror and indignation throughout the country, we give the trial as fully as possible. The male prisoner appeared a hard working, but sullen and close man; the wife was the very ideal of misery and griping avarice, but certainly appeared to have starved herself almost as much as her hapless children. The daughter was, to the eye, selfishness personified, and seemed to have thriven wonderfully in the midst of such unheard of privations inflicted on the younger sisters.\n\nCharlotte Barratt: I am in my 16th year; I had an elder sister named Ellen; up to the 30th of March I lived at Aspley Guise with my father and mother and five sisters, of whom Elizabeth is the eldest, and also a little brother, Thomas. I remember Ellen dying [illegible] two or three days before her hands were bent so, that she could not stick a in; mother said it was all her falseness. Ellen continued trying to make the lace. Ellen had no supper on the Friday night before she died because she had not done her work (that was the reason mother gave). She had no supper on the Saturday night. When she went upstairs she said, “Mother, I am so hungry.” Mother told her to go to bed as she had not done her work, and beat her upstairs with her stays which were rolled up in mother’s hand. Ellen was undressed, Elizabeth, I, Julia, Ellen and Thomas all slept in the same room. Ellen could not sleep that night, and she made a noise as if she was in pain. Mother slept in the next room; she came in on hearing the noise and “gone her a cut,” and told her to lie still. After that Ellen sung a hymn and made a prayer, “Lord Jesus, let me do my work next week.” That was the last I heard her say. I remember my little brother getting up about 20 minutes after five; some time after that, sister Elizabeth got up and went down stairs: afterwards she came back into our room; I asked her if my sister Ellen was not fast asleep; Elizabeth went to where Ellen lay and touched her, and then she told mother that Ellen was dead! Ellen used to make lace; she worked 14 hours a day; she sometimes went out on a Sunday to school; there weren’t time in the week for going out. She had some barley meal done up into hasty pudding for her food, chiefly, for 15 or 16 weeks before we came to the workhouse; we all had alike for breakfast, and we had the same for dinner some days. Mother expected five feet of narrow laces, rather less of wide ones, every day. If unable to do it, she was sent to bed without her supper. If she did her work, she had hasty pudding, or bread and dripping; a small slice for each child. We had coffee twice in the sixteen weeks I speak of, we had it after the rest had done, instead of barley meal; they put some water in the coffee-pot for me. My sister was sometimes beaten with stinging nettles, and had to sit on stinging nettles and thistles; also had her clothes on, but they were put under her clothes; mother used to do it; Elizabeth used to tell mother to go and get the nettles. She has had cow dung and sheep dung thrust into her mouth. She had often been beaten, with a cane and lately with a stick. Mother used to beat her, and Betsy held her while mother beat her; she used to hold her hands over Ellen’s mouth. We did the lace in the front room; we had a fire only two days last winter, and when Ellen went to get warmed in the back room, Betty would sometimes push her back into the cold room. I know that mother got never less than 6d a yard for lace and for wider lace 8d a yard. I know there was money in the house for mother used to pay for what she got always as she got it. Elizabeth kept the money in the tea chest, and has had as much as three or four sovereigns together.\n\nBy the Judge [from other sources, Sir J.T. Coleridge]: I was examined before the coroner. I took an oath; I knew what I was doing, and that is my evidence and my mark (produced).\n\nThe learned Judge then read the deposition before the coroner very carefully, almost the whole of which was contradictory of her present statements, and asked her “Is it true,” to which she replied, “No, it is not true. I said it because mother told me, as we were going down street, that she would beat me if I did not say so.”\n\nWitness continued to reply to the learned judge. “We had pork about twice a week just before Ellen died. Father and mother had it every day, and sometimes twice – at tea.”\n\nThe Judge: Do you mean to say that when they had pork you had none?\n\nWitness: Yes.\n\nJudge: Sure of that; sure of that?\n\nWitness: Yes, yes, yes.\n\nJudge. Why did you say before the coroner that you were eleven years old?\n\nWitness: I did not know how old I was. I know now, they told me at the workhouse.\n\nJulia Barratt: I am in my 15th year. [When this witness called it was deemed necessary by the court to prove the baptismal register, for which purpose John Smith, baker, Aspley Guise had been summoned; but as the Rev J. Vaux Moore, rector of the parish of Aspley, was on the bench, his lordship directed him to be sworn. Mr Moore then deposed to the certificates of baptism produced from which it appeared that Ellen Barratt, deceased, was baptised Sept 9th, 1838. Charlotte Barratt, the first witness, June 14, 1840. Julia the present witness, in 1842.] The witness was then examined and said: I used to work 14 hours a day. Sometimes I went to school on Sunday morning, and in the afternoon I went to bed. Never went out to play at any time. For food I had sometimes oatmeal gruel, sometimes barley meal – that was for breakfast; I had not enough. I had the same for dinner; we had 50 minutes allowed for dinner. We could do a yard and two feet of narrow lace in a day. If we did not do that we went to bed without supper, and next morning we had to get up and stand naked (in our shifts) in the back place, with our bare feet on the cold stones. I have seen Ellen suffer that punishment, and also with nettles put under her clothes, and beaten with a cane or a stick; mother used to beat her and Betsy used to hold her. I have seen rabbit dung, and sheep dung, and cow dung put in her mouth. I remember the night of her death. In the course of the week she had three fainting fits. She, and the lace pillow, and chair all fell down together. Betsy picked them all up, and when Ellen got over the fainting fit she had to go to work again. She had no supper the night she died. She said “Mother, give me some supper, I am so hungry.” Mother belted her all the way up stairs with her stays.\n\nBy the Judge: Mother gave her no supper; she had no supper the night before that. Generally she had thin oatmeal gruel for breakfast, and for dinner she had a piece of bread scalded as big as my hand. We had potatoes once a week and meat once a week. We never had crumbs in our gruel. [This was in reply to a question put by the prisoner Elizabeth Barratt.] James Williamson, Esq., M.D., of Woburn, swears: On the 31st of March I made a post mortem examination of the body of Ellen Barratt. It certainly was not the body of a person 17 years old; it was not developed enough; it appeared about 11 or 12 years of age, not more. I found no appearance of natural disease, nor any marks of external violence. The stomach was extremely small, [illegible word] it was difficult to find it at all, it lay so deep under the large intestine which was distended with air. Only a very small quantity of gruel was found – less than an ounce undigested, scarcely changed. The intestines were almost empty.\n\nBy the Court: If any quantity of food (I mean any considerable quantity) had been taken the previous day, in my opinion, it would have been found. The stomach appeared to be that of a child five or six years of age. I attribute the smallness of the stomach to habitual disuse, its proper functions not being exercised. I should expect to find just such a stomach, if all the life [illegible] the child had been suffering from an insufficiency of food. In my judgement, the cause of the child’s death, judging from the appearance of the different organs, was a combination of insufficient food, insufficiency of exercise, overwork and cruelty – such cruelty as I have heard described by the last witnesses.\n\nThe Judge: Would you illustrate the unnatural want of development in the stomach by the case of rowers or boxers whose muscles through constant exercise are extremely large?\n\nWitness: I mean that if the stomach had been properly used the blood vessels would have been large. The stomach was in an atrophoid condition (technically described). The brain showed an excited condition as if the child had been worried. That is what I mean by attributing death in part to cruel treatment. The brain was more developed than any other part of the body in proportion. The head was disproportioned to the rest of the body, but was in accordance with the real age of the child. The muscles of the cheek were small and shrunken, making the countenance unnaturally small, and arising from want of proper use. I have attended the father. The house is a very neat, well-furnished, and particularly clean house, and there was no sign of poverty, very much otherwise.\n\nJulia Barratt recalled: Betsy used to make lace two or three years ago, but lately only swept up and cleaned about.\n\nPrisoner: Did not I take in sewing?\n\nWitness: She used to take in sewing, sometimes from Miss Jane Parker [Carter in another newspaper report], but not lately. She used to go out when she liked. I have two married sisters. They sometimes came to see father and mother. We girls had to keep on at work, or get a beating when they were gone.\n\nGeorge Kemp sworn: I reside at Woburn, and am a publican. I was employed by Elizabeth Barratt on 30th April to remove furniture. I went to the house at Aspley and removed furniture to Crawley High-fields [from other sources it would appear this was the house of an older child]. There were a great many boxes and drawers all very full and heavy; in the drawers was a great deal of linen. There was one piece of dried bacon weighing, I suppose, 10 or 12 lbs. It hung in the back room. When we had loaded the second time and were starting, Elizabeth Barratt unlocked a box about a foot square and paid me 5s in two half-crowns; whether on purpose or not I don’t know, but I will swear I saw in her hand a great many sovereigns and half-sovereigns, and I should say certainly not less than twenty pieces of gold. She gave me two half-crowns and the man who helped me 3s, and her brother Thomas passing by also saw the gold, and spoke of it as we went along.\n\n[The prisoner, Elizabeth said she had borrowed half a sovereign from her brother, and that was all the gold she had.] Mrs Mary Heath sworn: I am next door neighbour to the prisoners. I remember these children and the deceased. I very seldom saw them out on the week day. I have heard noises like cruel usage such as beating. I have heard it as early as four in the morning and as late as ten at night. I have not been in the house lately; I did go in a little when they first came. The mother never came to my house; Betsy has been once or twice; I did not meet Betsy out neither. I go to church. Of late prisoners have gone to chapel, which is not above a quarter of a mile off.\n\nBy Prisoner: Never had words with the prisoner.\n\nBy the Court: They did not behave very well to me some two or perhaps three years ago; we did not exactly quarrel, because I would not speak to them.\n\nWilliam Henry Davies sworn: I am master of the Union-house at Woburn. I received the two children (Charlotte and Julia) on the 2nd of April. I weighted them on the 3rd; Charlotte weighed 46½ lbs, Julia 39 lbs. They had only the ordinary union-house diet, and 28 days after their admission, viz on the 1st of May, I weighed them again, and found as follows, Charlotte 61½ lbs, Julia 54. A month later I weighed them again and found no difference in Charlotte, and only two pounds in Julia.\n\nThe prisoners were then called upon for their defence. Susannah Barratt said, “I did my part with my family as far as lay in my power. I went without bread many a day, and only last winter, I went without anything at all for two days that they might not want. What they call barley meal was good oatmeal, course oatmeal when we could get it, and the [illegible] when we could not. It was such as is given to dogs. The two children together did not earn more than £1 in six weeks.”\n\nElizabeth Barratt muttered something which it was difficult to catch, but harped chiefly on the charge that the children used to cheat in their work.\n\nThe father said: I and my little boy used to go out early of a morning, and take our food with me, and go a long way and come home very late, and sometimes not at all for days together. I am a shepherd, and my work took me as far as nine miles at a time away from home. I am a hardworking man; I earned 9s 6d a week, and at times my boy earned as much as 1s 3d a week. All was given to my wife, and so far as I know we don’t owe anybody anything, and yet 3s 6d went of 10s 9d a week for rent and firing, so that we could not have very much to lay out in food for the children (only 7s for seven of us. I always took my money home. I never had a farthing from the children, and had nothing to do with their work or with beating them.\n\nThe Jury, after a short consultation, found all the prisoners Guilty, but recommended the father to mercy.\n\nHis Lordship, in passing sentence, expressed his perfect concurrence in the verdict and also in the distinction which the Jury had made and which he presumed to be based on the fact that the father could not have had opportunities of knowing the condition and ill-treatment of his children fully, but still must have known these things in part. With regard to the others – one could not but think with the deepest indignation of such conduct from a mother to her child, from an elder sister to her younger sisters; though only one had actually died it was entirely owing to God’s mercy that they were not also in their graves for they came to the workhouse, literally, shocking spectacles. So we were told, and it might be credited from the fact that after a short period of ordinary workhouse food they altered so much for the better, and this fact showed satisfactorily that their emaciated condition was not from something in their constitution which refused to be nourished, but through sheer starvation. Now if this lack of food had arisen from poverty on the part of the father there would have come the question, why did he not apply to the parish, which certainly would have granted some relief to so large a family; and if had been replied that the family were too proud – were struggling (with a bold spirit and not wisely), although we could not have approved of such pride, still the indignation would have been less severe. But what was the fact? From the evidence of two witnesses it appeared that they were rather above than below their position in life in point of comforts and the apparent means of livelihood, so that the cruelty must have proceeded from hardness of heart or the wicked love of hoarding up money. In the case of the poor Ellen that cruelty had resulted in untimely death, and for that death they were now to answer. But he was not empowered to adjudge them to anything like an adequate punishment, yet he should think that wherever they might hereafter go, they would be objects of dislike if not of scorn (and he hoped not) for their cruel deeds to these (and one especially) who ought to have been so dear to them. You, Susannah (continued his lordship) have already passed a large portion of your life, and you Elizabeth, are no longer young, and I do trust that both of you, so long as you shall live, will pass some portion of every day in sincere regret and penitence for the deed you have done, the cruelty of which you have been guilty. The sentence of the court is that Samuel Barratt be imprisoned, with hard labour, for twelve months, and on the others, Susannah and Elizabeth, penal servitude for four years.\n\nThe following, taken from the website Victorian Crime and Punishment (http://vcp.e2bn.org/), are the descriptions of the convicted prisoners when they entered Bedford prison in 1856.\n\nSusannah Barratt, aged 64.\n\nBirth town: Warrington [we think this is a mistranscription for Headington, near Oxford].\n\nTrade or occupation: labourer.\n\nMarriage status: married.\n\nNumber of children: eleven.\n\nEducation: can neither read nor write.\n\nHeight 5ft 5½ inches.\n\nHair colour: grey.\n\nEye colour: hazel.\n\nVisage: oval.\n\nComplexion: fresh\n\nSamuel Barratt, aged 65.\n\nBirth town: North Crawley.\n\nTrade or occupation: labourer.\n\nMarriage status: married.\n\nNumber of children: eleven.\n\nEducation: can neither read nor write.\n\nHeight 5ft 7 inches.\n\nHair colour: grey.\n\nEye colour: grey.\n\nVisage: long.\n\nComplexion: fresh.\n\nIdentifying marks: Cut mark under left eyebrow and under chin, hair thin on top of head, scars on right knee and leg.\n\nElizabeth Barratt, aged 28.\n\nBirth town: Aspley Guise.\n\nResidence: Husborne Crawley.\n\nTrade or occupation: lacemaker.\n\nMarriage status: single.\n\nEducation: able to read.\n\nHeight 5ft ¼ inch.\n\nHair colour: brown.\n\nEye colour: grey.\n\nVisage: oval.\n\nComplexion: Fresh.\n\n."
