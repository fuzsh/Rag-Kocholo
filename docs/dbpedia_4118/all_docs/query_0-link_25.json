        "text": "Phylogenetic analyses\n\nSequences and statistics: Final alignment of the 12S rRNA–16S rRNA fragment contained 2 481 aligned characters, with 701 conserved sites and 761 variable sites, of which 599 were parsimony-informative. The transition-transversion bias (R) was estimated at 2.52 (all data given for ingroup only). Nucleotide frequencies were 31.64% (A), 22.82% (T), 24.37% (C), and 21.17% (G).\n\nmtDNA genealogy: Both BI and ML analyses resulted in similar topologies, which differed only in several poorly supported nodes ( ). The obtained topology is generally consistent with the results of Matsui et al. (2011), Peloso et al. (2016), and Nguyen et al. (2019). Analyses achieved high phylogenetic resolution at species complexes and species-level groups, with most nodes showing strong support (PP≥0.95; BS>90%). However, several major nodes showing phylogenetic relationships among outgroup taxa and major lineages of Microhyla presented low or insignificant levels of support.\n\nThe BI genealogy ( ) inferred the following set of phylogenetic relationships:\n\n1) Monophyly of Microhyla is rejected (in agreement with Matsui et al., 2011), suggesting that the genus is monophyletic with respect to Glyphoglossus. Microhyla sensu lato is thus divided into two major groups, the first corresponding to the M. annectens species group (Microhyla–I, see ) and the second encompassing all remaining species (Microhyla–II, see ).\n\n2) Within the M. annectens species group, species are clustered into two reciprocally monophyletic clades: one joining M. annectens Boulenger, 1900 and M. marmorata Bain & Nguyen, 2004 from mainland Indochina and peninsular Malaysia (1.0/93; hereafter nodal support values given for PP/BS, respectively), and another joining Bornean species M. petrigena Inger & Frogner, 1979 and M. perparva Inger & Frogner, 1979 (1.0/100).\n\n3) Within the second species group of Microhyla, M. palmipes Boulenger, 1897 is reconstructed as a sister species to all remaining taxa, although with low node support (0.87/53). All remaining species are grouped in six well-supported clades 1–6.\n\n4) Clade 1 (1.0/91) joins M. superciliaris Parker, 1928 from the Malayan Peninsula with two species from southern India: M. sholigari Dutta & Ray, 2000 and M. laterite Seshadri, Singal, Priti, Pavikanth, Vidisha, Saurabh, Pratik & Gururaja 2016, the latter two species are closely related and form a monophyly (1.0/100).\n\n5) Clade 2 (1.0/100) joins M. butleri with a closely related species M. aurantiventris Nguyen, Poyarkov, Nguyen, Nguyen, Tran, Gorin, Murphy & Nguyen, 2019 from the Central Plateau of Vietnam. Two specimens of Microhyla sp. (ZMMU NAP-08282 and NAP-08283; G) from Ingyin Taung Mt., Kachin State, unambiguously fall into the radiation of M. butleri.\n\n6) Clade 3 (1.0/100) corresponds to the M. ornata species group and joins a number of taxa from the Indian subcontinent and is divided in two subclades. The first subclade joins two species with stout body habitus and large outer metatarsal tubercle used for burrowing, from arid areas of southern and eastern India (M. rubra) and Sri Lanka (M. mihintalei Wijayathilaka, Garg, Senevirathne, Karunarathna, Biju & Meegaskumbura, 2016). The second subclade includes smaller species from India, Nepal, and Bangladesh: M. ornata, M. taraiensis Khatiwada, Shu, Wang, Thapa, Wang & Jiang, 2017, and M. nilphamariensis Howlader, Nair, Gopalan & Merilä, 2015.\n\n7) Clade 4 (1.0/100) joins two large-bodied species, M. berdmorei (widely distributed across Indochina and Sundaland and also occurring in Myanmar) and M. picta Schenkel, 1901; the latter species has a stout body habitus and enlarged shovel-like outer metatarsal tubercle.\n\n8) Clade 5 (1.0/100) corresponds to the M. fissipes species group and consists of two subclades. The first subclade joins three species of Microhyla occurring in East Asia: M. mixtura Liu & Hu, 1966 in Hu et al. (1966) and M. beilunensis Zhang, Fei, Ye, Wang, Wang & Jiang, 2018 from China, and M. okinavensis Stejneger, 1901 from the Ryukyu Archipelago in Japan. The second subclade joins taxa from the southern part of China and Indochina, including M. fissipes from southern China, Taiwan, and northern Vietnam, M. mymensinghensis Hasan, Islam, Kuramoto, Kurabayashi et Sumida, 2014 from Bangladesh, and M. mukhlesuri from Indochina. Two specimens of Microhyla sp. from Pakkoku, Magway (ZMMU NAP-08252; D) and from Ingyin Taung Mt., Kachin State (ZMMU NAP-08311; E) were assigned to M. mukhlesuri and grouped with other Myanmar specimens of this species (USNM 587110, 587159, 587166). Microhyla mukhlesuri and M. mymensinghensis form a moderately supported clade (0.93/83).\n\n9) Clade 6 shows moderate support (0.93/56) and joins members of the M. achatina species group and related taxa. The stout-bodied Microhyla sp. (ZMMU A5960–A5961; C) from Kan Pauk, Magway Division, are grouped and appear to be conspecific with M. “rubra” of Peloso et al. (2016) (CAS 215851) with high support (1.0/100); this species has an unresolved position within Clade 6 and is not closely related to M. rubra sensu stricto from India.\n\n10) The position of M. heymonsi within Clade 6 is also unresolved; a specimen of Microhyla sp. from Ingyin Taung Mt., Kachin State (ZMMU NAP-08277; F), is placed within the radiation of M. heymonsi, which is subdivided into two moderately divergent major lineages. Other specimens of M. heymonsi from Myanmar belong to two different lineages of M. heymonsi (USNM 587130 and USNM 587138).\n\n11) A number of species from Sundaland form a subclade (1.0/87) within Clade 6: M. mantheyi Das, Yaakob & Sukumaran, 2007 (Malayan Peninsula) and M. borneensis Parker, 1928, M. malang Matsui, 2011, M. orientalis Matsui, Hamidy et Eto, 2013, and Microhyla sp. 1 (Borneo).\n\n12) Sundaland species M. achatina Tschudi, 1838 (from Java) and M. gadjahmadai Atmaja, Hamidy, Arisuryanti, Matsui & Smith, 2019 (from Sumatra) form a sister lineage (0.98/80) with respect to M. kodial Vineeth, Radhakrishna, Godwin, Anwesha, Rajashekhar & Aravind, 2018, from southern India and two Microhyla sp. lineages from central Myanmar. Small-bodied slender Microhyla sp. specimens from the Magway Division (ZMMU A5966–A5967; A5975–A5976; A, B) and Microhyla sp. 2 from the Sagaing Division (USNM 523975, 537450) form two distinct reciprocally monophyletic groups (1.0/100). Microhyla kodial is strongly suggested as a sister lineage to Myanmar taxa (1.0/99) (see ).\n\nSequence divergence: For uncorrected P-distances for the 16S rRNA gene fragment among and within the examined Microhyla species see . Intraspecific distances ranged from P=0% in a number of examined species to P=4.5% in M. petrigena (the latter may be explained by incomplete taxonomy of Bornean Microhyla). The interspecific distances within Microhyla varied from P=2.7% (between M. rubra and M. mihintalei) to P=13.1% (between M. laterite and stout-bodied Microhyla sp. from Kan Pauk, Magway) ( ). Genetic divergence within M. mukhlesuri was P=1.3%, within M. butleri was P=1.7%, and within M. heymonsi was P=2.3%. No genetic variation was observed between haplotypes within stout-bodied and slender-bodied species of Microhyla sp. from Magway (P=0.0%) ( ). Divergence between these taxa and their closest relatives was P=2.0% for small slender-bodied species of Microhyla sp. from the Magway Division if compared to Microhyla sp.2 from Sagaing Division, and P=5.3% if compared with M. kodial; and was P=8.8% for stout-bodied Microhyla sp. from Magway Division with M. berdmorei ( ).\n\nTable 2\n\nSpecies 12345678910111213141516171819202122232425262728293031323334351.

The paratypes are subadult specimens and are notably smaller in body size than the holotype (SVL 12.6–17.9 mm; mean 15.2±1.38 mm; n=5). Paratype coloration does not significantly differ from that described for the holotype, with the exception of the throat, which is off-white and lacks blackish mottling. All type specimens have large black inguinal spots; location and shape of black markings on posterior surfaces of thighs and cloacal area, as well as shape of “teddy-bear”-shaped brown dorsal marking, may vary insignificantly. Adult male CAS 215851 (see Referred materials) from the type locality is larger than the holotype (SVL 29.1 mm) but agrees well with the holotype description in general morphology and coloration, although it has more dark spots in the axilla area compared to the holotype. CAS 215851 has a very large and shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle, notably protruding in dorsal view. Chromatic differences include coloration of the throat, which is uniform black-gray in male CAS 215851; coloration gets darker towards lower jaw edges.\n\nNatural history: Pakokku District is located in the heart of the dry zone of central Myanmar, which is characterized by low precipitation and high temperatures, with a hot semi-arid tropical savanna-like climate (Peel et al., 2007). On average, Pakokku receives around 560 mm of precipitation annually. April is the warmest month, with an average temperature of 31.5 °C, whereas January is the coldest month, with an average temperature of 21.5 °C. The highest rainfall is observed in August and September, with 113 and 130 mm of precipitation, respectively (data fromhttps: //en.climate-data.org).\n\nAll specimens of Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. were collected at night from 1900 to 2100 h on the banks of a large, permanent, likely artificial pond near a small Buddhist pagoda in the center of Kan Pauk village, located in a dry and open habitat with rare vegetation in the vicinity of Shinma Taung Mountain – the only hill in the area with an elevation of 514 m a.s.l. ( A). The pond is used by local people as a watering area for livestock. Subadult specimens were recorded on the banks of the pond hiding in cracks, whereas the adult male holotype was collected from the stone fence of the pagoda, hiding in a crevice. Thus, the new species appears to be a good burrower. During the survey, the weather remained hot and dry and the Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. specimens were inactive and hid in shelters; no calling was recorded. We also examined several paddy-fields and other large waterbodies within a 2 km radius around Kan Pauk village; however, Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. was not recorded in any other locality. Diet, larval stages, and eggs of the new species are unknown.\n\nOther microhylids recorded in sympatry with Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. included new congeneric species Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. (see below) and Kaloula pulchra Gray, 1831, which appear to share the same breeding site during the reproductive season. Other anurans such as Fejervarya sp., Hoplobatrachus cf. tigerinus (Daudin, 1802), Sphaerotheca sp., and Duttaphrynus melanostictus (Schneider, 1799) also occurred in sympatry.\n\nDistribution: Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. is currently known only from the type locality in Kan Pauk, Yesagyo Township, Magway Division, Myanmar ( ). The species was recorded at an elevation of 230 m a.s.l. The actual distribution of the new species is unknown, but it is likely to be found in other arid areas of the Irrawaddy River Valley in the region of the Irrawaddy and Chindwin interfluve; discovery of new localities in Magway, Sagaing, and Mandalay divisions is anticipated. The record of “Microhyla rubra” from “Moulmein, Burma” (now Mawlamyine) by Parker (1934) based on W. Theobald’s collection comes from Mon State in southern Myanmar—a region with a much milder tropical monsoon climate—might refer to a different species. The taxonomic status of this record requires clarification by further studies.\n\nConservation status: At present, the new species is known from several specimens from a single locality in Yesagyo Township, Magway Division; however, a wider distribution in other arid areas of central Myanmar is anticipated. As the actual range and population trend of the new species are currently unknown, we suggest Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. be considered as a Data Deficient species following IUCN’s Red List categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2017).\n\nEtymology: The specific name “fodiens” is a Latin adjective in the nominative singular derived from “fodio” — Latin verb meaning “to dig” or “to burrow” referring to the distinctive enlarged shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle of the new species, suggesting that it is a good burrower, which may serve as an adaptation to the dry climate of the Irrawaddy River Valley in central Myanmar. The recommended common name in English is “Burrowing narrow-mouth frog”. The recommended common name in Burmese is “Twin Aoung Thaephar”.\n\nComparisons: Only a few species of Microhyla have a stout body habitus with an enlarged spade- or shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle as an adaptation for digging, including, M. rubra from southern India, M. mihintalei from Sri Lanka, M. taraiensis from eastern Nepal, and M. picta from southern Vietnam. Comparisons of Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. with the abovementioned species appear to be the most pertinent; from all remaining species of the genus, the new species can be easily distinguished by its stout body habitus and enlarged shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle (vs. slender to stout body habitus and small or no outer metatarsal tubercle in other species of Microhyla).\n\nMicrohyla rubra was originally described by Jerdon (1854) from “Carnatic near rivers” and “also Ceylon”; the holotype is considered to be lost. Recently, Wijayathilaka et al. (2016) restricted the distribution of M. rubra to southern India and Garg et al. (2018b) designated a neotype for this species. Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. can be distinguished from M. rubra from southern and eastern India by the following characteristics: first finger notably shorter than half of second finger (vs. equal), thigh shorter than foot length, TL=8.6±1.5 mm, FOL=11.8±2.0 mm, n=6 (vs. thigh longer than foot length, male, TL 13.8±0.5 mm, FOL 12.4±0.4 mm, n=8; data from Wijayathilaka et al., 2016), comparatively shorter hindlimbs with tibiotarsal articulation not reaching eye level (vs. reaching over eye level but shorter than snout tip), comparatively better developed webbing between toes, toe webbing formula: I 1–2 II 1¾–3 III 2¾–3¾ IV 4–2¾ V (vs. I 1½–2 II 1½–3 III 2½–3 IV 4–2½ V), and dorsal pattern with brown “teddy-bear”-shaped marking, thin brownish lines on lateral sides of dorsum forming three nested reverse V-shaped figures (vs. almost uniform reddish-brown dorsum).\n\nMicrohyla fodiens sp. nov. can be distinguished from M. mihintalei from Sri Lanka by the following characteristics: granular skin on dorsum (vs. shagreened or sparsely granular skin on dorsum), thigh shorter than foot length, TL=8.6±1.5 mm, FOL=11.8±2.0 mm, n=6 (vs. thigh equal to foot length, male, TL 11.6±0.6 mm, FOL 11.6±0.6 mm, n=14; data from Wijayathilaka et al., 2016), comparatively better developed foot webbing (vs. toe webbing reduced), dorsal pattern with brown “teddy-bear”-shaped marking, thin brownish lines on lateral sides of dorsum forming three nested reverse V-shaped figures (vs. almost uniform orange-brown or reddish-brown dorsum), and three wide black transverse cross-bands on dorsal and posterior surfaces of thighs forming tiger-like pattern, cloacal region with large black blotch (vs. tiger-like pattern and dark cloacal blotch absent).\n\nThe new species can be readily diagnosed from M. taraiensis from eastern Nepal by the following characteristics: red spots and tubercles on dorsum absent (vs. light red dots dispersed over dorsal surfaces), large shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle (vs. rounded outer metatarsal tubercle), second finger longer than fourth finger (vs. shorter), comparatively shorter hindlimbs with tibiotarsal articulation not reaching eye level (vs. reaching nostril level), inner palmar tubercle ca. 1.5 times smaller than outer palmar tubercle (vs. inner palmar tubercle two times greater than outer palmar tubercle), single subarticular tubercle on second finger and two subarticular tubercles on third finger (vs. two tubercles on second finger and three tubercles on third finger), and single subarticular tubercle on second toe and two subarticular tubercles on third toe (vs. two tubercles on second toe and three tubercles on third toe).\n\nFinally, Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. can be distinguished from M. picta from southern Vietnam by the following characteristics: generally smaller body size, adult SVL 20.8–29.1 mm (vs. adult SVL 25.2–33.4 mm), better developed webbing on feet, toe webbing formula: I 1–2 II 1¾–3 III 2¾–3¾ IV 4–2¾ V (vs. I 2–2¾ II 1¾–2¾ III 2¾–3¾ IV 4–2½ V), dorsal pattern with brown “teddy-bear”-shaped marking, thin brownish lines on lateral sides of dorsum forming three nested reverse V-shaped figures (vs. brown dorsal markings in shape of irregular blotches or reverse V-shaped figures but always edged with white or light beige), pronounced dorsolateral fold as row of enlarged tubercles (vs. no dorsolateral fold), bright-yellow coloration in groin area absent (vs. present), and black iris with dense golden reticulations (vs. dark iris with bronze to reddish-bronze color of reticulations).\n\nMicrohyla irrawaddy sp. nov.\n\n;

In general, all paratypes agree well with the description of the holotype. Specimens vary significantly in body size, coloration of dorsal surface, form of dark “teddy-bear”-shaped brown markings on dorsum, extent of spotting on dorsum and flanks, and coloration of ventral surfaces. Males have generally much smaller body size than females: SVL in males 12.3–17.1 mm (mean 14.9±1.8 mm; n=7) and SVL in females 16.7–20.9 mm (mean 18.1±1.5 mm; n=6). Females have generally lighter coloration, with less contrast in light-brown dorsal marking and fewer bright reddish tubercles on dorsum ( B) than males (Figures 2A, 10A). In female ZMMU NAP-08274, the dorsal “teddy-bear”-like marking on the dorsum is interrupted and represented by a number of large grayish-brown irregular blotches ( B). Females have a more gray-olive tint in dorsal coloration than males ( A, B). Males have a grayish-black subgular vocal sac, whereas females have lighter grayish-white throats. Gravid females contained unpigmented eggs, visible through the semi-translucent belly skin near the groin area. Background dorsal coloration of breeding males may vary from light-gray (paratype ZMMU A5966, see B) to beige (holotype ZMMU A5965, see A) and light yellowish-brown (paratype ZMMU A5967, see C).\n\nAdvertisement call: The Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. male advertisement call represents a characteristic rattling sound, resembling the sound of a ratchet to the human ear, similar to “krrrrr… kkrrrrr… kkrrrrr…”. Advertisement signal calls were of 0.184±0.07 s duration (0.004–0.277 s, n=50), consisting of 1–5 pulses (4±2, n=50) ( ). The pulse duration was 4±0.1 ms (2–5 ms, n=194) and the interval between successive pulses within a call varied from 5 to 99 ms (59±2.11 ms, n=144). Thus, the pulse period was 63±2.12 ms (9–103 ms, n=144) and pulse rate varied from 11.89 to 57.14 pulses/s (17.3±1.05 pulses/s, n=49). The maximum amplitude frequency of pulses varied within a call from pulse to pulse and the mean value of this parameter was 3 700±570 Hz, n=194 (1 870–4 120 Hz). The maximum amplitude frequency of the call varied from 2 810 to 4 120 Hz (3 780±350 Hz, n=50).\n\nNatural history: Same as Microhyla fodiens sp. nov., the new species inhabits the dry zone of central Myanmar with a hot semi-arid savanna-like climate (see above). The new species was recorded in two habitats within the Pakokku District of Magway Division, but was always observed in close proximity to comparatively large waterbodies, including temporary and permanent pools in the Irrawaddy River Valley ( B) in suburbs of Pakokku city, or paddy fields and water reservoirs in the vicinity of Kan Pauk village.\n\nSpecimens of Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. were collected at night from 1830 h to 2100 h. Males did not normally sit in the open and were recorded calling from small cracks and holes in the banks of the waterbody, often hiding in footprints of buffalo hooves ( B, C). Males called from 1900 h to approximately 0200 h. Females were recorded while hiding in grass in close proximity to water-filled pools. Clutch size is unknown; one female (ZMMU A5972) laid ca. 30 eggs in a plastic bag after capture. Eggs of the new species are 0.8–0.9 mm in diameter and yellowish-white in color with a brownish animation pole. Larval stages of Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. are unknown. Diet of the new species is unknown.\n\nAt the type locality, Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. was found in sympatry with congeneric species M. mukhlesuri ( D), and also with Fejervarya sp.; these species shared the same breeding site with the new species. In the vicinity of Kan Pauk village, the new species was recorded in sympatry with Microhyla fodiens sp. nov., Kaloula pulchra, Fejervarya sp., Hoplobatrachus cf. tigerinus, Sphaerotheca sp., and Duttaphrynus melanostictus.\n\nDistribution: Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. is at present known from two closely located areas in Pakokku District of Magway Division, central Myanmar: i.e., suburbs of Pakokku city on the bank of the Irrawaddy River (the type locality) and in the vicinity of Kan Pauk village, Yesagyo Township (ca. 30 km north of type locality) ( ). The species was recorded from elevations of 60 to 220 m a.s.l.. A genealogically closely related population of Microhyla (herein indicated as Microhyla sp. 2, see ) was recorded from the vicinity of Chatthin in Sagaing Division of northern Myanmar by Mulcahy et al. (2018). Considering the notable genetic divergence between Sagaing and Magway populations (P=2.0%), further research is needed to clarify whether Microhyla sp. 2 is conspecific with Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. The actual distribution of the new species is unknown and discoveries of new localities within the middle part of the Irrawaddy River Valley are anticipated.\n\nConservation status: Currently, the actual distribution range and population trends of Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. remain unknown and require further study. Given the information available, we suggest Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. be considered as a Data Deficient species following IUCN’s Red List categories (IUCN Standards and Petitions Subcommittee, 2017).\n\nEtymology: The new species name “irrawaddy” is given as a noun in apposition in reference to the Irrawaddy (or, officially, Ayeyarwady) River – the greatest water basin in Myanmar and western Indochina, and the cradle of Burmese civilization. The new species is known to occur in dry areas of the central part of the Irrawaddy Valley in the Magway Division, but likely has a wider distribution in the dry zone of central Myanmar. The recommended common name in English is “Irrawaddy narrow-mouth frog”. The recommended common name in Burmese is “Myanmar Thaephar”.\n\nMorphological comparisons: In having toes with almost completely reduced webbing (webbing I 2–3 II 2–3 III 3–4½ IV 4½–2¾ V), Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. can be easily distinguished from those members of the genus that have fully developed webbing reaching to disks at most toes (usually with the exception of toe IV), including: M. annamensis Smith, 1923, M. annectens, M. berdmorei (including M. fowleri Taylor, 1934, which is considered a synonym of M. berdmorei by Matsui et al., 2011), M. darevskii Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Orlov, Galoyan, Tran, Le, Kretova & Geissler, 2014, M. malang, M. mantheyi, M. marmorata, M. nanapollexa Bain & Nguyen, 2004, M. perparva, M. petrigena, M. pulchella Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Orlov, Galoyan, Tran, Le, Kretova & Geissler, 2014, M. pulverata Bain & Nguyen, 2004, and M. superciliaris (detailed by Poyarkov et al., 2014).\n\nA number of Microhyla species have toe webbing that reaches the level of the penultimate (distal) subarticular tubercles on at least some toes and, thus, can be easily diagnosed from Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov., where toe webbing is completely reduced. These species include M. arboricola Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Orlov, Galoyan, Tran, Le, Kretova & Geissler, 2014, M. darreli Garg, Suyesh, Das, Jiang, Wijayathilaka, Amarasinghe, Alhadi, Vineeth, Aravind, Senevirathne, Meegaskumbura & Biju, 2018 “2019”, M. karunaratnei Fernando & Siriwardhane, 1996, M. palmipes, M. pulchra (Hallowell, 1861), M. sholigari, and M. zeylanica Parker & Osman-Hill, 1948. In M. butleri and M. aurantiventris toe webbing is better developed than in Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. reaching the level between the two distal tubercles on the third toe.\n\nThe new species has a very slender body habitus and can be easily distinguished from those species of Microhyla that have a stout body habitus and enlarged spade- or shovel-shaped outer metatarsal tubercle as an adaptation for digging, including: M. rubra, M. mihintalei, M. taraiensis, M. picta, and Microhyla fodiens sp. nov. (see above). The presence of scattered red spots or dots over the dorsum was previously reported only for M. taraiensis; thus, with the exception of the presence of red or reddish dorsal tubercles, the new species can be distinguished from all remaining species of Microhyla.\n\nThe following species of Microhyla have notable longitudinal grooves on the dorsal surface of fingers and toes (also known as dorso-terminal grooves) and, thus, can be readily distinguished from the new species, which lacks such grooves: M. achatina, M. annamensis, M. annectens, M. arboricola, M. aurantiventris, M. beilunensis (on toes only), M. borneensis, M. darreli, M. gadjahmadai, M. heymonsi (usually present), M. karunaratnei, M. kodial, M. malang, M. mantheyi, M. marmorata, M. minuta Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Orlov, Galoyan, Tran, Le, Kretova & Geissler, 2014, M. nanapollexa, M. orientalis, M. perparva (on toes only), M. petrigena, M. pineticola Poyarkov, Vassilieva, Orlov, Galoyan, Tran, Le, Kretova & Geissler, 2014, M. pulchella, M. pulverata, M. sholigari, and M. superciliaris (two latter species have grooves on toes only).\n\nMicrohyla irrawaddy sp. nov. has a notably granular skin on dorsum, which readily distinguishes it from those species of Microhyla that have smooth or shagreened dorsal skin without prominent granular projections, including: M. achatina, M. annectens, M. chakrapanii Pillai, 1977, M. darreli, M. fusca Andersson, 1942, M. gadjahmadai, M. heymonsi, M. karunaratnei, M. laterite, M. malang, M. marmorata, M. mukhlesuri, M. mymensinghensis, M. nanapollexa, M. perparva, M. pineticola, M. pulchella, M. pulverata, M. sholigari, and M. superciliaris.\n\nThe new species has a well-developed first finger, longer than one half of the second finger length, whereas in a number of its congeners the first finger is reduced or is shorter than one half of the second finger length, including: M. achatina, M. annamensis, M. annectens, M. arboricola, M. beilunensis, M. berdmorei, M. borneensis (reduced to a nub), M. darreli, M. fissipes, M. fusca, M. gadjahmadai, M. heymonsi (smaller or equal to one half of second finger length), M. malang, M. mantheyi, M. marmorata, M. mihintalei, M. minuta (smaller or equal to one half of second finger length), M. mixtura, M. nanapollexa (reduced to a nub), M. orientalis, M. palmipes (reduced to a nub), M. perparva (reduced to a nub), M. petrigena (reduced to a nub), M. picta, M. pineticola, M. pulchella, M. pulchra, M. pulverata, and M. superciliaris.\n\nMicrohyla irrawaddy sp. nov. can be distinguished from M. maculifera Inger, 1989 from Borneo by the following characteristics: generally larger body size, adult males SVL 12.3–17.1 mm, adult females SVL 16.7–20.9 mm (vs. adult males SVL 12.0–13.3 mm, adult females 11.8 mm), two metatarsal tubercles on feet (vs. single metatarsal tubercle), dorsum irregularly covered with tubercles of various sizes (vs. two lateral rows of tubercles), and weak disks on fingers II–IV (vs. no disks on fingers). The new species can be distinguished from M. nilphamariensis from the lowlands of Nepal and northern India by the following characteristics: notably granular skin (vs. smooth or shagreened), first finger longer than one half of second finger length (vs. equal), and reduced webbing on toes, toe webbing formula: I 2–3 II 2–3 III 3–4½ IV 4½–2¾ V (vs. comparatively better developed foot webbing, toe webbing formula: I 2–2¾ II 2–3½ III 3–4 IV 4¼–2¾ V). The new species can also be distinguished from M. okinavensis by the following characteristics: smaller body size, adult males SVL 12.3–17.1 mm, adult females SVL 16.7–20.9 mm (vs. adult males SVL 22.5–28.2 mm, adult females SVL 26.5–30.8 mm), notably granular skin (vs. smooth or shagreened), presence of weak disks on fingers and toes (vs. absent), comparatively shorter hindlimbs with tibiotarsal articulation of adpressed hindlimb reaching eye level (vs. reaching snout tip), and reduced webbing on feet, toe webbing formula: I 2–3 II 2–3 III 3–4½ IV 4½–2¾ V (vs. comparatively better developed foot webbing, toe webbing formula: I 1½–2 II 1½–3¼ III 2¾–4 IV 4–2½ V).\n\nMicrohyla irrawaddy sp. nov., can be further distinguished from its sister species M. kodial from southern India by the following characteristics: larger and more prominent tubercles (vs. comparatively less granular skin with small flat tubercles), no olive dorsal markings, red or orange dorsal tubercles and brown “teddy-bear”-shaped marking present dorsally (vs. olive-green markings on dorsum and lacking red-colored tubercles and brown “teddy-bear”-shaped marking on dorsum), dorsolateral line of tubercles and dark stripe present (vs. dorsolateral row of tubercles and dorsolateral dark stripe absent), and dorsal notches absent on digits (vs. short dorsal notches on finger- and toe-tips).\n\nAcoustic comparisons: Comparison of advertisement call parameters is based on data from the current study and from Dehling (2010), Garcia-Rutledge & Narins (2001), Heyer (1971), Kanamadi et al. (1994), Khatiwada et al. (2017a), Kuramoto & Joshy (2006), Kurniati (2013), Le et al. (2016a, b), Matsui (2011), Nguyen et al. (2019), Vineeth et al. (2018), and Wijayathilaka & Meegaskumbura (2016).

According to most acoustic parameters, Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. is similar to M. kodial from southern India: i.e., frequency of maximum amplitude (3 780±350 Hz vs. 3 752.16±233.06 Hz), number of pulses per call (4±2 vs. 6±2), and pulse rate (17.3±1.05 pulses/s vs. 14.97±1.38 pulses/s). However, the advertisement signal of Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. significantly differs from M. kodial by call duration (0.18±0.07 s vs. 0.33±0.07 s).\n\nCall duration in Microhyla irrawaddy sp. nov. (0.18±0.07 s) is similar to that of M. malang (0.17±0.04 s), M. rubra (0.17±0.03 s), and M. mihintalei (0.19±0.02 s); however, other call parameters among these species are different: for example, number of pulses per call (4±2 vs. NA, 18±0.2, and 13±2.5, respectively), pulse rate (17.3±1.05 pulses/s vs. 30.3±1.4, NA, and 58.6±2.8 pulses/s, respectively), and frequency of maximum amplitude (3 780±350 Hz vs. 2 404±94, 2 268±43, and 2 100±400 Hz, respectively).\n\nMicrohyla irrawaddy sp. nov. has a similar frequency of maximum amplitude (3 780±350 Hz) to M. sholigari (3 673.55±159.54 Hz) and M. laterite (3 670.96±97.10 Hz), but differs from these two species by values of temporal parameters, such as call duration (0.18±0.07 s vs. 0.73±0.04 and 0.70±0.05 s, respectively), number of pulses per call (4±2 vs. 63±4 and 90±6.75, respectively), and pulse rate (17.3±1.05 pulses/s vs. 86±3.84 and 128.24±3.98 pulses/s, respectively)."
