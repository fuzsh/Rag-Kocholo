Yashu & Rav's wedding day was a long day of ceremonies, their family's being from Northern and Southern India, respectively, there was a lot to incorporate into their big day. Although Yashu is from Texas & Rav is from London, UK, they met while teaching English in Japan and eventually moved back to London to make it their home. It was a festive day full of good food, good dancing, & good fun. Shout out to 36th street events for always making things run so smoothly.
