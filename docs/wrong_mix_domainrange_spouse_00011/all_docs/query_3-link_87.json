        "text": "This is a first-time presentation of the initial section of the Toledot Yeshu (TY) narrative describing the birth and early life of Jesus in Judeo-Arabic, a text with important implications for current research on TY. First, the origin of the birth narrative has been debated in recent scholarship on the Hebrew versions of TY. The existence of this lengthy Judeo-Arabic birth narrative, preserved in two manuscripts belonging to the Russian National Library, as well as the identification of other, earlier Judeo-Arabic manuscript fragments that include the TY birth narrative, demonstrates that the birth narrative formed part of TY significantly earlier than has been previously suggested. Second, the narrative preserved in the Russian manuscripts also demonstrates the relevance of the Judeo-Arabic versions of TY for the understanding of the development of this protean work. Examination of their textual tradition reveals interesting connections with particular Hebrew versions of TY from Europe and can shed light on the question of how the work moved between East and West. Finally, this Judeo-Arabic version of TY is significant in its demonstration of a clever adaptation to its linguistic and cultural surroundings. It incorporates a lengthy introduction—the only one currently known in all of the TY literature—which is a literary tour de force employing contemporaneous Arabic style together with a well-known rabbinic dictum, thereby situating Toledot Yeshu simultaneously in its Islamicate milieu and in Jewish textual and even ritual tradition. The discussion concludes with a transcription and translation of the birth narrative as preserved in these two Russian manuscripts.\n\n1 The conclusion that the language of TY is a Babylonian Aramaic dialect is presented in Michael Sokoloff, “The Date and Provenance of the Aramaic Toledot Yeshu on the Basis of Aramaic Dialectology,” in Toledot Yeshu (“The Life Story of Jesus”) Revisited: A Princeton Conference (ed. Peter Schäfer, Yaacov Deutsch, and Michael Meerson; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2011) 13–26. An alternate view is proposed by Willem Smelik, who posits that the composition was originally created in the Land of Israel, and that it was revised and developed in Babylonia; see “The Aramaic Dialect(s) of the Toldot Yeshu Fragments,” AS 7 (2009) 39–73. On Sokoloff’s conclusion, it is important to keep in mind that a Babylonian Aramaic dialect would have been found in the Mesopotamian area known as the Jazīra, between the Tigris and Euphrates. This was an important area of Jewish-Christian interchange and is, in my opinion, a likely possibility for the area in which TY was initially created and circulated.\n\n9 See the discussion of dated Hebrew manuscripts in Meerson and Schäfer, “Toledot Yeshu”: The Life Story of Jesus, 2:1. Debate continues regarding the undated manuscripts. One salient example is the TY manuscript originally thought to be one of the earliest Hebrew Helene versions, and which is included in a collection known as the “Strasbourg manuscript,” MS Strasbourg BNU 3974. This undated manuscript was later dated to the eighteenth century in William Horbury, “The Strasbourg Text of the Toledot,” in “Toledot Yeshu” Revisited (ed. Schäfer, Deutsch, and Meerson) 49–60. Daniel Stökl Ben Ezra has recently suggested a return to the earlier dating; see “On Some Early Traditions in Toledot Yeshu and the Antiquity of the Helena Recension,” in “Toledot Yeshu” in Context: The Jewish “Life of Jesus” in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern History (ed. Daniel Barbu and Yaacov Deutsch; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, forthcoming). I am grateful to Dr. Stökl Ben Ezra for sharing this article with me prior to its publication.\n\n18 In this way, the Judeo-Arabic evidence corroborates Gager and Ahuvia’s suggestion that the introduction of the element of the “son of the menstruant” to the TY literature followed soon upon the composition of tractate Kallah in Babylonia. This Judeo-Arabic evidence suggests favoring the earlier end of the period they cite (9th–12th centuries). See John G. Gager and Mika Ahuvia, “Some Notes on Jesus and His Parents: From the New Testament Gospels to the ‘Toledot Yeshu,’” in Envisioning Judaism: Studies in Honor of Peter Schäfer on the Occasion of His Seventieth Birthday (ed. Ra‘anan Boustan et al.; 2 vols.; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2013) 2:997–1019, at 1010 n. 53.\n\n28 The appearance of this legend in Hebrew versions of TY is noted in Witold Witakowski, “Ethiopic and Hebrew Versions of the Legend of the Finding of the Holy Cross,” StPatr 35 (2001) 527–35. Witakowski provides a brief discussion of the narrative sequence in TY, on the basis of the texts published by S. Krauss (see n. 21). A recent discussion of this account with respect to TY can be found in Alexandra Cuffel, “Between Epic Entertainment and Polemical Exegesis: Jesus as Antihero in Toledot Yeshu,” in Medieval Exegesis and Religious Difference: Commentary, Conflict, and Community in the Premodern Mediterranean (ed. Ryan Szpiech; New York: Fordham University Press, 2015) 155–70.\n\n52 Apparently, the intent is the Arabic ىغط or نايغط, “exceeding proper bounds” or even “oppression.” The word is written with a tav, but interchange between ט and ת is well attested in later Judeo-Arabic texts. This lexical item is a fraught and negative theological term in Arabic. For example, it is used to describe the actions of the arch-idolator “Pharaoh” in Qur’ān 20:43, in a chapter largely devoted to the description of Pharaoh’s idolatrous behavior. The use of the verb may even relate to the mention of “the Pharaohs” a line or two earlier in this Judeo-Arabic text."
