        "text": "For the first time ever, I kept a running list throughout the year as I read, putting books on it (tentatively) whenever they did that thing of thoroughly rearranging your heart and brain, meaning once you’ve closed the covers you have to sit there staring into space for a bit. Almost all the books I read this year were very, very good, but only a few can ever be gold dust. In 2023 I’ve read 176 books with the possibility of one or two more before New Year’s Day [edit: final total 179]—a little below par for me, though not bad for someone who’s working part-time and studying for a doctorate part-time. Out of sheer determination, I have managed to keep this list down to twelve: one outstanding book per month, more or less. Here they are.\n\nA Childhood: the Biography of a Place, by Harry Crews (1978): Crews was a cult novelist of what’s sometimes called “grit lit”, emerging out of the Southern gothic tradition, and this memoir of his first six years of life in Bacon County, Georgia, contains all the grotesquerie, all the dry wit, and all the arrestingly profound and gorgeous writing you would expect from Flannery O’Connor or William Faulkner. A perfect balance between comedy and tragedy, self-awareness and innocence, description of place and evocation of character, psychology and action—I can’t praise it more highly.\n\nThe Right to Sex, by Amia Srinivasan (2021): A brilliant collection of essays by an All Souls fellow, tackling phenomena like Internet pornography, the incel movement, legalising sex work, and the shortcomings of a model of good sex that operates solely on the binary basis of consent = good, non-consent = bad. Srinivasan’s thinking reminds me of Jia Tolentino’s—that same commitment to thinking through absolutely every angle, following every thread to its conclusion, and resisting not only easy answers, but often any answers at all. The Right to Sex acted as a whetstone, sharpening up my thinking.\n\nSuper-Infinite: the Transformations of John Donne, by Katherine Rundell (2022): What Super-Infinite does so very well is walk a thrilling line between assuming too much familiarity and over-explaining. If you are fairly familiar with Donne’s poetry and prose, you will find yourself excited to read him again. If you have never read Donne before, Rundell’s unabashed partisanship and impassioned advocacy will make you unquenchably curious to see what it’s all about. She chooses her quotations intelligently, showing off the range of his talents: the sexiness, the wit, the harshness, the sheer weirdness.\n\nIn Ascension, by Martin MacInnes (2023): MacInnes’s astonishing and gorgeous third novel has a strong flavour of Jeff VanderMeer’s bureaucratic bio-weird, crossed with the megalithic creepiness of 2001: a Space Odyssey, but it doesn’t feel derivative; instead, MacInnes seems to understand sci fi tropes so well that he can turn them to his own ends. There are giant space objects emitting mysterious signals, and possibly time travel, and inexplicable geological phenomena, but also budgets and training and research supervisors and ageing parents. I absolutely loved it. The ending is amazing. I wish fervently that it had made it to shortlist stage for the Booker Prize; it’s a far more interesting novel than any that did advance.\n\nThe Baron in the Trees, by Italo Calvino (1957): Young Baron Cosimo climbs a tree one day in the mid-1700s and vows never to touch the ground again. Despite his arboreal existence, he lives as exciting and episodic a life as any Crusoe or Tom Jones, encountering pirates, smugglers, revolutionaries, brigands, and political exiles, corresponding with famous scientists and philosophers, and maintaining many, many love affairs. There are so many brilliant touches: the armchair and bookcases that Cosimo lashes to a branch, the dachshund whom he adopts and names Ottimo Massimo, the Candide-like tone, the opposition of the physical limitations of the world to the wide-open horizons of the mind and emotions. Also, it’s funny.\n\nGrass, by Sheri S. Tepper (1989): An incredibly rich novel encompassing ecology, feminism, theology, sex and power, class prejudice, practical ethics, and—incongruously—horseback riding. A seemingly incurable plague is sweeping the inhabited planets of the galaxy, except for one. Marjorie Yrarier, her husband Roderigo, and their two children are sent as ambassadors by the religious monolith Sanctity (clearly adapted from Mormonism) to find out what they can about this odd immunity. So far Tepper’s work has been spot on for me, with tenderness and brutality interwoven and fascinating, complex female protagonists.\n\nAsh: a Secret History, by Mary Gentle (2000): It begins as a playful postmodern take on academic historiography, focusing on the life of a teenaged female mercenary captain in 15th-century Burgundy. Its shifts of genre—from historical fiction to historical fantasy, to academic thriller, to science fiction—are in part what account for its incredibly compelling quality. The other reason for that is Gentle’s total immersion in her world; she completed a Masters in War Studies to write this, and is a historical reenactor in her spare time, so her knowledge of the era is deep and convincing. When you finally start to work out what is going on, it’s mind-blowingly satisfying, and somehow, all 1000 pages seem genuinely necessary to the plot, which is not something I think I have ever said before. Entirely unlike anything else I’ve read, it left a huge void in my life once I was finished with it.\n\nBournville, by Jonathan Coe (2022): The first Brexit/covid novel I have read that seems to actually answer the brief, to be attempting to engage with the political, national and international situation of Britain today without too much cuteness, overt allegory, or partisanship. Perhaps that’s because it doesn’t start with Brexit and covid; it ends with them. Most of Bournville is an attempt to work out how we got here, and Coe is too honest and historically savvy not to recognise that a) the roots lie deep in the past, and b) there was no lost Golden Age. A repeated line sums it up: “Everything changes, and everything stays the same.” Beautiful, funny, and sad, a brilliant example of how individual human lives are woven into the collective life of a nation.\n\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs, by Sarah Orne Jewett (1896): Powerfully evocative and emotionally engaging, taking place over the course of a single summer on the shore country and islands of eastern Maine. Our narrator-protagonist is a woman writer, apparently past her first youth, who comes to the Maine coast to complete some work in rural solitude. The book is structured around the stories told to the narrator by the inhabitants of Dunnet Landing, and her adventures following up the threads of local history. The characters are beautifully drawn, with their interests, capacities and vulnerabilities all presented: it’s rare to see rural communities portrayed with such even-handed attentiveness. Fans of Willa Cather’s writing will find plenty to love here, as will devotees of Tove Jansson’s The Summer Book.\n\nNotes on an Execution, by Danya Kukafka (2022): This book made me cry. Beautifully conceived, built with care and attentiveness, it tells the story of a man, Ansel Packer, who kills three teenage girls in 1990. But it doesn’t tell “his” story; we look through the eyes of Lavender, the mother who gave birth to him when she was seventeen and abandoned him when she was twenty-one; Hazel, the twin sister of his ex-wife Jenny; and Saffy, who spends a few years in foster care with Ansel and later becomes a homicide detective, whose life’s work brings her into his orbit again decades later. It’s a novel about fucking up and mediocrity and trying to be good. It’s about the torment of being unable to explain or fix yourself. You could talk about it for days.\n\nLondon Belongs to Me, by Norman Collins (1945): Set between 1938 and 1940, this is a love letter to the city of London, an ensemble-cast study of working-class city-dwellers, and a downright delight. They live in a world of unspoken longings and loathings, the imperative of “ladylike” or “respectable” behaviour pressing firmest on those whose class status is shaky. But most of all, it’s full of rich period detail—Lyons Corner Houses! Trams all over the Embankment! The question “Fish-paste or sandwich-spread?”!—and marvelous sweep. Less interested in making a point than Dickens is, but in the way it feels, this novel is a Dickensian heir all over.\n\nCahokia Jazz, by Francis Spufford (2023): A speculative crime novel set in a 1922 where the American continent continues to support a thriving Native American population, thanks to white colonisers having introduced a less virulent disease strain than they did in our history, Cahokia Jazz is both a deeply evocative portrait of a city and a world that never was, and a compelling study of corruption, politically motivated crime, and the compromises of power. Big, not-so-dumb orphan Joe Barrow, plodding mixed-race detective and jazz pianist manqué, grows so much over the course of the week that the novel covers, and he grows in the reader’s heart too—an unforgettable character.\n\nA few stats, for the stat-lovers:\n\nGender balance: Six by women, six by men. Not bad at all, there.\n\nPublication dates: Seven from the 21st century, four from the 20th, one from the 19th. That seems quite fair, actually. Two of those seven are 2023 releases.\n\nGenre balance: The first three are all nonfiction (memoir, journalism, biography)—everything else is fiction. (I’m not doing any further breakdown here, because the concept of genre is essentially a marketing tool, and fairly useless for people who are dedicated readers.)\n\nRacial balance: Only one author of colour made this list. I read lots more by authors of colour this year, but it’s interesting (and says something about my positionality, as academics like to call it). If you’re interested, some (though not all) of the great books I read by authors of colour this year, which I would recommend highly but simply didn’t get onto this list, are: Black Sun by Rebecca Roanhorse; Transcendent Kingdom by Yaa Gyasi; She Who Became the Sun by Shelley Parker-Chan; Dawn, Adulthood Rites, and Imago by Octavia E. Butler; Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl by Harriet Jacobs; The Jewels of Aptor by Samuel R. Delany; Didn’t Nobody Give a Shit What Happened to Carlotta by James Hannaham; and, as rereads, Salvage the Bones by Jesmyn Ward and Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie.\n\nI’ll post this early because I want to post my Best Books of 2023 in the final week of the year. Short reviews for everything I read from now til the end of the year will go on my Goodreads. December on the blog (thus far) has seen the end to my American Classics project with Willa Cather’s final novel, a wrap-up post reflecting on the project as a whole, and December’s Love Your Library. Here’s what I thought about the rest!\n\nbest reread: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, by J.K. Rowling (1998). This was the one that scared me the most as a child, to the point where I stopped using our upstairs bathroom to brush my teeth and took to fearfully checking the landing outside the bathroom for menacing graffiti daubed in blood. (The problem was solved by my mother’s ingenuity. Realising that “basilisks aren’t real” would have no effect at all, she applied logic in a different way by reminding me that the “second-floor bathroom” in a Scottish building would be a “third-floor bathroom” in an American house, and we didn’t have a third floor. This was instantly effective.)\n\nThe standard complaint about Chamber of Secrets is that it doesn’t move the series plot forward. I actually disagree: the most significant plot point is the destruction of the diary, which is of course the first Horcrux to be removed from the equation, though we don’t get to find out that it was metaphysically important for another four books. What I do find interesting is the way Chamber of Secrets simultaneously introduces us to the racist/magic-supremacist motive of Voldemort supporters like the Malfoys—through the slur “Mudblood” and the basilisk’s intended use as a tool of racial purification—and to Harry’s meaningfulness for oppressed non-human magical communities, like the house-elves, who see him as a symbol of hope that cruelty and tyranny can be defied. It takes the series a few more books to really foreground this stuff, but it starts showing up here, laying groundwork. (The reality of the wizarding world as a political sphere is here too: Lucius Malfoy’s proximate motive in giving Ginny the diary is to damage the chances of a Muggle-friendly bill sponsored by Arthur Weasley.) Overall, much better than its reputation as one of the duffers of the series would suggest.\n\n(Final note: when the gang are making the Polyjuice Potion, they’re caught emerging from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom by Percy Weasley, who is HORRIFIED and DISTRESSED to see his BROTHER coming out of a GIRLS’ TOILET and who refers to this incident REPEATEDLY as the book goes on. Percy Weasley is also clearly meant to be perceived by readers throughout the series as a self-important, tiny-minded jobsworth whose smuggery curdles, in later volumes, into actual quisling behaviour. The jokes, they write themselves.)\n\nqueerest reimagining: Him, by Geoff Ryman (2023). A retelling of the story of Jesus, with the Christ figure assigned female at birth and initially known as Avigaiyl. A friend’s death in childhood triggers something in Avigaiyl, who takes his name—Yeheshua, or Yeshu—and identifies as a boy from then on. The focus of the book is mostly, though, on Yeshu’s mother Maryam (Mary, in the Christian tradition). Ryman, brilliantly, sees her as an intellectual and theological radical whose marriage to the scholarly, asexual Yosef is entirely suited to her needs and wants. Maryam expects her divinely-conceived firstborn to change the world by being a woman who preaches; Yeshu’s gender nonconformity troubles her for much of the book, until she visits his community of followers and realises that he is espousing thoroughly radical theology anyway. Him is at its strongest—most chilling and breathtaking—when Yeshu talks about what it’s like to provide a God that has never felt anything before with its first experiences of embodiment and emotion. “It needs to know”, he keeps saying; “it needs to know what it feels like.” These moments are fewer and further between than I would have liked, though, and the rest of the characterisation and world-evocation feels unhelpfully distancing. I wanted to like this a lot more than I did; Ryman’s earlier novel Air is excellent.\n\nbest rug-pull: The Gate to Women’s Country, by Sheri S. Tepper (1988). This novel of a postapocalyptic matriarchal league of fortified cities on the US West Coast did for me what very few books have done for me a long time. For the first 250-odd pages, I was invested and enjoying it, but also thinking, “Why is everyone running this society making such daft decisions?” And then I got to the final 50-odd pages and was like Oh! Oh. Ohhhh my God. It’s not exactly a “twist” or “reveal”, more an arrival at understanding of a reality that’s been hiding in plain sight all along. The novel’s politics are wildly flawed—the shrugged-at homophobic eugenics are egregious—but it is utterly fascinating, and I bet in 1988 it freaked people out. (Even now, it does; my mum’s book club read this last year and apparently most of the men hated it. To which I say, quelle fucking surprise!)\n\nmost satisfyingly immersive: Cahokia Jazz, by Francis Spufford (2023). It takes about thirty pages to settle into the terminology and the hard-boiled noir style, but after that, I absolutely adored this. A speculative crime novel set in a 1922 where the American continent continues to support a thriving Native American population, thanks to white colonisers having introduced a less virulent disease strain than they did in our history, Cahokia Jazz is both a deeply evocative portrait of a city and a world that never was, and a compelling study of corruption, politically motivated crime, and the compromises of power. It’s a smidge too long for its plot, but I don’t care. Big, not-so-dumb orphan Joe Barrow, plodding mixed-race detective and jazz pianist manqué, grows so much over the course of the week that the novel covers, and he grows in the reader’s heart too—an unforgettable character. And I’ve figured Spufford out: he is, at heart, a science fiction writer. Not that he writes “science fiction” per se, but the animating force of all his novels is that spirit of enquiry and immersion and richness and what-if-ness taken to its logical extremes. He is excellent.\n\nmost disturbing: The Mountain Lion, by Jean Stafford (1947). Whoooeee. As I said somewhere on the Internet earlier this week, The Mountain Lion won’t make my best-of-year list because it’s so emotionally repelling that I can’t love it—my own weakness, entirely. But you can be repelled by something and still acknowledge its power. This is a horrifying coming-of-age story about Ralph and Molly Fawcett, siblings united in loathing for their prim mother and older sisters, but finding themselves increasingly drawn apart by the deep social forces that pushed adolescent boys and girls away from each other in the ’30s. The ending is shocking, everyone is right about that, but what made me gasp and say “oh my God” out loud is the scene in the barn with the sulfuric acid. That singleness of purpose, rage, jealousy, self-destructive impulse—it’s so well conveyed, and it’s so recognisable (is there a single clever, lonely girl in the world who has no idea what it feels like?) and it’s so scary. An absolutely haunting novel.\n\nFrankly, after The Mountain Lion I was quite relieved to give myself permission to leap into Christmas reading with wholehearted abandon. Some of this, so far, has been seasonal in a literal sense—I’ve loved Terry Pratchett’s brilliant Hogfather, been touched by William Horwood’s return to Kenneth Grahame’s River Bank in The Willows at Christmas, and felt an urgent, guilty responsibility towards my childhood dolls and toys after finishing Rumer Godden’s The Story of Holly and Ivy. Some, on the other hand, is seasonal in an indulgent, hot-cocoa-for-the-brain sort of way, such as my just-finished read, Scarlett Gale’s His Secret Illuminations, which deals with the growing love between a gigantic, dyslexic mercenary woman named Glory (professional name: the She-Wolf) and a tiny, timid, orphan monk named Lucían as they try to track down a shipment of stolen magical books. Tolstoy it ain’t, but lovely it is.\n\nBack after Christmas for my Books of 2023! I hope you all have very relaxing holidays, however that shows up for you, with lots of good reading.\n\nRun, as always, by Rebecca of Bookish Beck, this meme usually posts on the last Monday of each month, but that’s Christmas Day this year! So here it is early. Enjoy. You can join in yourself on your own blog or social media platform of choice with #loveyourlibrary.\n\nFuneral Games, by Mary Renault (1981): The third in Renault’s Alexander trilogy, of which I read the first, Fire From Heaven, in November. Funeral Games is a much harder book, both in terms of content—either know the history already, or get comfortable opening Wikipedia tabs—and structure: there’s no clear protagonist, and each chapter jumps ahead in time. Alexander died young, when both of his wives were pregnant with their first-borns; the resulting power scuffle amongst his officers is like watching a slow-motion video of a building collapsing. The only one who really does well is Ptolemy, who is quite content to rule a single province (Egypt), and whose intelligent grasp of his own limitations actually leads him to an enduring spot in history as the founder of the dynasty which produced the famous Cleopatra VII. Meanwhile, child bride Eurydike—married off to Alexander’s developmentally-disabled brother Arridaios at the age of fifteen and determined to become Queen in her own right—is the most fascinating character: cunning, observant, kindly to her husband, deeply ambitious, but ultimately just too young and inexperienced (and female) to stage a coup singlehandedly. Funeral Games is definitely worth reading, but doesn’t stand on its own, so if you’re interested, try FFH first.\n\nThe Commodification of Identity in Victorian Narrative, by Sean Grass (2019): PhD reading. Incredibly useful to me, probably not of interest to anyone else. Grass’s period of focus is after mine, but his introductory chapter argues that the steep rise in autobiographical publishing at the start of the 1800s paved the way for a more general literary understanding of subjectivity as something that can be commodified, produced and packaged for consumption—leading to the great Victorian novels of first-person experience, like David Copperfield. I’m working on two memoirs by courtesans in precisely that early-century time period, and Grass discusses one of my authors (Harriette Wilson) explicitly.\n\nHogfather, by Terry Pratchett (1996): Pratchett’s genius, when he was on top form, was unmatched and unmatchable. (We shan’t talk about some of the less fortunate late books, which tended to get didactic and dull.) But Hogfather is excellent and the perfect read to ring in the festive season. Set on Hogswatch Night—when the Hogfather comes to give presents to good boys and girls in his sleigh drawn by four vast pigs, for whom a pork pie and a clutch of turnips are left by the chimney—in Pratchett’s Discworld, this one features Death, who is always one of my favourite characters, and his granddaughter Susan, whose career as a governess is aided by her capacity to both see and brutally beat up the monsters under her tiny charges’ beds. Few authors make me laugh out loud as regularly as Pratchett does. Still fewer can pivot on a dime from the ridiculous (the real Death posing as a fake Hogfather for a department store holiday grotto) to the sublime (the real Hogfather being hunted across the snow in boar shape in a ritual act of sacrifice; Death’s speech about why humans need fantastical stories). Perfect.\n\nAnd not yet read, but on deck for the next fortnight from the library, are:\n\nThe Willows at Christmas, by William Horwood (1999): Horwood was the author of Duncton Wood and wrote several sequels to Kenneth Grahame’s classic The Wind in the Willows, all of which are very nearly as good as the original. This one features an appalling house guest at Toad Hall. I can’t wait.\n\nLetters from Father Christmas, by J.R.R. Tolkien (1976): Tolkien’s children didn’t just write to Father Christmas, they got letters back too. I’m familiar with some of the characters—dopey North Polar Bear, prissy managerial elf Ilbereth, the ever-more-inventive antagonist goblins—but have never read the collection all through.\n\nThe Story of Holly and Ivy, by Rumer Godden (1958): Only about 60 pages, this is a children’s book from the ’50s about an unwanted doll, an unloved little girl, and a childless couple who all find each other at Christmas. I had this as a kid and loved it but remember very little about it, so I look forward to rediscovering it.\n\nI hope your library has served you well this year! If you aren’t a regular library user yet, here are a few of my favourite truths about libraries to encourage you.\n\nAuthors receive royalties from library borrows. Sometimes—depending on a whole host of factors—they receive more per borrow than they do per actual sale. You are materially supporting authors when you borrow from a library.\n\nPublic libraries are free to join. No one will ever ask you to pay money for your membership. You might have to prove you live in the area, with an addressed utility bill or similar. For that, you can rent—within reason—whatever they’ve got in the way of books, ebooks, audiobooks, DVDs, sheet music, etc., and renew it almost indefinitely. Not to mention being able to use whatever supplementary services they have: some host small reading groups, some allow businesses to book meeting rooms, some have regular sales of unwanted stock, virtually all of them now have a bank of PCs and printers you can use.\n\nIf your public library doesn’t have a book you want, you can usually request that they purchase it. My local library system has an email address specifically for stock requests. They don’t make it obvious—I had to ask staff at the issue desk—but it exists, and most people don’t know about it.\n\nPublic library funding is one of the first things to be cut in an environment of austerity, and that has serious effects on the entire community. They’re available to absolutely everyone: the elderly, parents with small children, graduate students whose houses are too cold to work in (ahem), the unhoused, construction workers nipping in on a lunch break to grab a copy of their favourite sci-fi novel. Borrowing and usage data is their first line of defense against funding cuts. That is to say, every time you enter a library, borrow a book, return a book, use any other service, do anything that goes on their electronic records, you are actively helping to construct a case for the library’s importance in the community. You are actively defending it just by using it. (You don’t even have to read most of the books! I check out more than I ever read. It doesn’t matter. Their borrowing numbers remain the same.)\n\nFor real, get a library card. It’s one of the best things I’ve done for my wallet, and my community, since moving here two years ago. You will never regret having one.\n\nTime limit: This was a project that lasted all year, with the intention of reading one book that counted as an “American classic” per calendar month. I didn’t pre-select the list, although I had a few ideas about what I wanted to include—some of which changed, some of which didn’t.\n\nHow did I do?: I did it! The complete list of books I read for this project is below (all links to my reviews):\n\nA Childhood: an Autobiography of a Place, by Harry Crews (1978)—January\n\nThe Collected Stories of Eudora Welty (1980)—February\n\nThe Age of Innocence, by Edith Wharton (1920)—March\n\nNative Son, by Richard Wright (1940)—April\n\nIncidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, by Harriet Jacobs (1861)—May\n\nAdventures of Huckleberry Finn, by Mark Twain (1885)—June\n\nBabbitt, by Sinclair Lewis (1922)—July\n\nIn Cold Blood, by Truman Capote (1966)—August\n\nThe Country of the Pointed Firs, by Sarah Orne Jewett (1896)—September\n\nThe House of the Seven Gables, by Nathaniel Hawthorne (1851)—October\n\nThe Last of the Mohicans, by James Fenimore Cooper (1826)—November\n\nSapphira and the Slave Girl, by Willa Cather (1940)—December\n\nSome statistical break-down here:\n\n5 out of 12 authors on this list are women (Welty, Wharton, Jacobs, Jewett, Cather)\n\n2 out of 12 authors on this list are Black (Wright and Jacobs); 0 are Latinx, Asian-American or Indigenous American. If I’d read into the late 20th and early 21st century this might have been different but it’s still not good—there are plenty of authors I could have read, like Charles W. Chesnutt, James Welch, Zitkála-Šá, Carlos Bulosan, H. T. Tsiang, and Eileen Chang\n\n3 out of 12 authors on this list are now acknowledged to have been LGBTQ+ (Capote was gay, Jewett and Cather almost certainly lesbians)\n\n7 out of 12 books on this list were published in the 20th century; the remaining 5 were all published in the 19th century\n\n3 out of 12 books on this list are works of nonfiction, either memoir or journalism; the remaining 9 are all fiction, either short stories or novels (or a novella in vignettes, in Jewett’s case)\n\n5 of these books are set in the South or Deep South (Crews, Welty, Jacobs, Twain, Cather); 4 are set in New England (Wharton, Jewett, Hawthorne, Cooper); 3 are set in the Midwest (Wright, Lewis, Capote). None are set primarily in the Western states or on the West Coast.\n\nAny favourites?: I absolutely adored Harry Crews’s A Childhood; it was a terrific, vivid, evocative, gorgeously written book to open the project. Sarah Orne Jewett’s The Country of the Pointed Firs was also a real stand-out for its truthfulness to life, and the curiosity and respect shown to its subjects, the inhabitants of a remote Maine fishing village. Both earned spots on my Best Books of 2023 list against tough competition.\n\nAny disappointments?: I hated The House of the Seven Gables. Other than that, I didn’t deeply dislike any of these, although Native Son was rather hard going. It’s certainly important, but it’s not much fun to read a book that long about a character so fundamentally angry and fucked-up.\n\nAny surprises?: The Last of the Mohicans surprised me a good deal. That tension between racism and wanting to write a good story creates several fascinating characters who we’re not really meant to care about as much as we do, something Cooper achieves almost unwillingly.\n\nResolutions and discoveries: Discoveries first. It is capital-I Impossible to write anything approaching Great American Novel status without engaging with racism. Eight of these novels do so explicitly. (I include Babbitt, which doesn’t have any Black characters but which does pay glancing attention to anti-Semitism. And, let’s be honest, George Babbitt is exactly the kind of man who joined the Klan in the midwest in the 1920s: a married, white, Protestant small business owner with a deep revulsion for nonconformity who just wants to be popular with the guys.) Those that do not—Wharton, Capote, Jewett and Hawthorne—often engage with it metaphorically or subtextually, as in The House of the Seven Gables‘s themes of generational fraud and disinheritance. Landscape, and the connection to land, were also recurrent touchstones: Harry Crews, Eudora Welty, Mark Twain, and Sarah Orne Jewett (plus Cooper and Cather, to an extent) are the most obviously land-tethered. Crews’s memoir, in particular, derives its power from its origin in such a precise place: not just the South, but Georgia; not just Georgia, but Bacon County.\n\nAs for resolutions, no more Hawthorne, at least not for a long time. Probably no more Wright. Yes more Crews (I said I’d seek out the rest of his reprints at the start of the year, and I haven’t yet; shame on me). I’ve now read all of Cather’s major works and am into her lesser-known novels, which is handy for reasons I’ll explain shortly. This list should also have contained more authors of colour—it’s partly a problem with the canon, partly a problem with my own framing of the project. Of those authors I could have read and didn’t, Charles W. Chesnutt in particular has really captured my attention and interest; several of his novels are available free through Project Gutenberg, so I might try him in the New Year.\n\nNext?: After an arduous democratic process played out in the comments section of an earlier post, I have tallied votes and consulted my own wishes, and concluded that next year’s reading project is….\n\nThis will mean finding lesser-known books by authors whose major works I’ve already read, and I absolutely can’t wait. I’ve already started drawing up a list of ideas, although, like American Classics, B-Sides won’t consist of a pre-determined TBR, and will be subject to my own whims and needs every month. Wish me luck!\n\nSapphira and the Slave Girl, by Willa Cather (1940).\n\nI’ve been putting off writing about this, for some reason. It’s not at all like most of Cather’s other work: not set in the US West, not much landscape description, considerably shorter (from what I can tell, given that my editions of her other works are from a different publisher), and a novel set in a further historical period than even her other historical novels, like Death Comes For the Archbishop. It was the last novel she wrote before she died, and has distinct autobiographical elements. Set in Back Creek Valley, southwestern Virginia, where Cather was born and lived til the age of nine, it also has characters with names that were, she explains, familiar to her from her parents’ talk about the old place, and features a child character in its final chapter who is clearly a Cather-analogue.\n\nBut the two primary characters are the ones in the title: Sapphira Dodderidge Colbert, a white woman from more respectable parts of Virginia who married a mill owner considerably below her in social station, and Nancy, her enslaved maid and the daughter of her enslaved housekeeper. Sapphira, middle-aged, has become severely physically disabled, suffering from dropsy (oedema) that makes her feet and legs swell painfully. Nancy, nineteen, is a light-skinned beauty, and also has a gentleness and sensitivity about her that has made her the favourite of her mistress—until now. Sapphira’s jealousy is aroused by rumours about Nancy’s paternity and about her husband’s obvious fondness for the girl, and as the novel opens, she has “taken against” her for several months. The book’s overarching plot is to do with Sapphira’s increasingly horrifying complicity in Nancy’s persecution by her rakish nephew Martin, and the rescue that is achieved by the Colberts’ adult daughter, Rachel, with her father’s knowledge and passive assistance.\n\nRachel is a reader extension, in a way; she recognises the things about the way her family lives that the other characters cannot. She is an abolitionist at heart and secretly receives radical newspapers from the like-minded postmistress, which she burns after reading. Her position in the novel is technically a white saviour one: Nancy’s escape is entirely down to Rachel’s activity. And yet she also sees the nasty complexity of the social situation, the way most of her mother’s enslaved servants accept the system just as her mother does. (The Colberts are unusual for being slaveowners; southwestern Virginia has long been, and still is, a poor, remote and mountainous area, where white people tended to have enough difficulty farming smallholdings, lacking the resources or the status-seeking desire to purchase or keep enslaved people.) The oldest of the enslaved people on the Colbert property, Old Jezebel, remembers her capture in Africa (initially as a prisoner of internecine wars), and the Middle Passage, and her difficulties in learning to speak English, but she dies partway through the book: the physical brutalities of the trade are mentioned but not dwelt upon. Rachel disapproves of her mother’s slaveholding, and rescues Nancy because she knows it’s the right thing to do, but she never openly challenges the status quo.\n\nAnd yet, within the moral universe of the novel, the warping effect of slaveholding is made very clear. Sapphira, without ever acknowledging to herself or anyone else what she is doing, attempts to orchestrate the rape of a teenager whom she owns. More than once, she puts Nancy, alone, in Martin Colbert’s path, sometimes in a geographically isolated location such as the woods, knowing that he has a history of “dishonouring” young women. All of the little kindnesses we have seen her show to dying Jezebel, her affection for the old houseman Washington and her beloved housekeeper, Nancy’s mother, Till, evaporate when the reader is faced with that understanding. It reminded me strongly of Valerie Martin’s Property, a much later exploration (by a white woman) of the corruption of a white woman’s soul by the institution of slavery. Nancy herself is not deeply characterised and lacks agency—she is young, sweet, thoughtful, profoundly un-flirtatious, a “good girl”—but when she returns at the novel’s end, post-emancipation, dressed in silks and furs and with a well-paying job as a housekeeper in Montreal, she has a dignity and authority that implies greater complexity. In 1940 and from a white author, Sapphira and the Slave Girl is probably as explicit an acknowledgment of the material and moral devastation of race-based slavery as we were ever going to get.\n\nThis is my final American Classics book—I’ve done it, I’ve read one a month for a whole year! Stay tuned for a roundup and reflections post later this month."
