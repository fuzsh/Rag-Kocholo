        "text": "Lecky Professor Of History\n\nshe/her\n\nI am a scholar of medieval women, gender and sexuality. My books have dealt with slavery, prostitution, masculinity, and quasi-marital unions. My current research focuses on King David as a figure of masculinity in medieval Christian and Jewish culture, drawing on a variety of sources from across Europe. I have been active in the profession internationally both in the field of women's and gender history and the field of medieval studies.\n\nI am interested in the intersection of social and cultural history; legal history; the history of women, gender, and sexuality. I have worked with a wide variety of sources, including court records, hagiography, and Icelandic sagas, to name a few. I have particular interests in medieval masculinities, and in the way particular stories are retold and reinterpreted across time and geographies.\n\nBefore coming to Trinity I taught in the United States at the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University, and the University of Minnesota, where I was named Distinguished Teaching Professor for my work in teaching postgraduates. In 2018-19 I have responsibility for the modules HI1221, \"Religion and Society c. 1095-c. 1517\" (Michaelmas term), HI4370, \"Christians and Jews in the Middle Ages\" (Hilary term), and HI4389, \"Medieval Marriage\" (both terms). I also participate in the teaching of HI7170, \"Medieval Sources.\"\n\nI welcome dissertation and thesis students working on the cultural and social history of Europe in the central to later Middle Ages, including the history of women, gender, and sexuality.\n\nPublications\n\nBooks\n\nSexuality in Medieval Europe: Doing Unto Others, third edition (Routledge 2017). 1st edition (2005) translated as Sexualität im Mittelalter, trans.
