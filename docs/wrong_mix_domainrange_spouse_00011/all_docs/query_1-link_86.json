One of these, the Babylonian language, was in use hundreds of years before the Hebrew race was founded by Abraham. That language designated the seventh day of the week as \"sa-ba-tu\", meaning rest day -- another indisputable proof that the Bible \"Sabbath\" was not, and is not, exclusively Jewish.\n\nVery few realize that the word \"Sabbath\" and the concept of resting from work on the seventh day of the week (Saturday) is common to most of the ancient and modern languages of the world. This is evidence totally independent of the Scriptures that confirms the biblical teaching that God's seventh-day Sabbath predates Judaism. The concept of a Saturday holy day of rest was understood, accepted, and practiced by virtually every culture from Babylon through modern times.\n\nIn the study of the many languages of mankind, you will find two important facts:\n\nIn the majority of the principal languages the last, or seventh, day of the week is designated as \"Sabbath.\"\n\nThere is not even one language that designates another day as the \"day of rest.\"\n\nFrom these facts we may conclude that not only those people who called the last day of the week \"Sabbath,\" but all other peoples and races, as far as they recognized any day of the week as \"Sabbath,\" rested on the seventh day. In fact, it was recorded by the great historian Sozomen that in his time the whole known world, with the exception of Rome and Alexandria, observed the seventh day of the week.\n\n\"The people of Constantinople, and almost everywhere, assemble together on the Sabbath, as well as on the first day of the week, which custom is never observed at Rome or at Alexandria\" (Socrates, \"Ecclesiastical History,\" Book 7, chap.19).\n\nAnother interesting fact is that the words in the original languages that are used to designate the seventh day of the week as the \"Sabbath\" have continued to be very similar while the other words have been so changed over time that they are unintelligible to people of other language groups. This is another proof that the Sabbath and the words used to designate the seventh day of the week as the \"Sabbath day\" originated at Creation in complete harmony with the biblical record found in Genesis 2:1â€“3."
