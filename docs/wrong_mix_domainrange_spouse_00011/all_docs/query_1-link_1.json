        "text": "Concerned Reader permalink\n\nEven if this s an April fools Joke, it’s very pognient. Just ask yourself a question our dearest (Christian readers.) Based on all of the “worship” Jesus receives (including prayers, declarations of love in songs, dance, weddings, gatherings, bible studies, general culture etc. from Mormons, Jehovah’s witnesses, Pentacostals, Eastern Orthodox, Baptists, Catholics, etc. why is he not pleased with you? Why is his kingdom of mercy, love, and peace not clearly manifest among you?\n\nConsider, Jesus’ teachings on his needed atoning death and impending resurrection were only ever clear to his inner circle, (and that was only after he explained it to them at length.) This fact is clear to any people who read the NT. Not even Peter was prepared when Jesus said he had to die.\n\nEveryone else among the populace that Jesus taught only heard his message in obscure parables and though there were albeit more clear ethical teachings, the death and resurrection weren’t clear to people at large until pentacost. Even now, Christians still must cover vast ground to spread the gospel.\n\nDo any of you truly realize that the New Testament makes it clear that only a few people ever heard (and actually understood) that Jesus’ deity and dying was important while he lived?\n\nAll past and present historic Christian sects have some sort of Christology as a result of this. Even Arian Christians (who do not accept Christ’s deity directly) still sing praises to Jesus as the unique son of G-d. Systematic Theology is covered in every single seminary course, (and even in secular religious studies courses.) Most people as a result have some idea of this formerly obscure parabolic teaching on the atoning death and divinity of the Christ. Modern Christians know today what the ancients barely understood, although It took nearly 300 years before the deity of Christ was fully codified.\n\nYet despite the cries of Maranatha (a plea for the lord to come, as well as a declaration of his 1st visitation, see Wikipedia) the Christian description of the kingdom is not yet Made manifest. Where are the greater things that Jesus’ students were to accomplish according to Jesus’ word? Could it be that Jesus’ intention was for godly action and not creed and a personal declaration of adoration?\n\nCould it be that he wants you to serve his father as he himself did? You all focus on him a ton. Where is the sentiment of Jesus’ that says the lord is G-d and him only shalt thou serve? Where is the sentiment of Christ that the Shema is the most important commandment? Where are the exhortations to care for the poor, the widows, and orphans? The gospel says Christ will hand the kingdom to the father, yet Christians reject the efforts of those who (like Jesus) already serve as sons of the commandments. You engage in reverse Judaizing (systematic de judaization.) The Judaizers from James said the gentiles had to become Jews, and were castigated by Paul, but now you my brethren rebuild the same wall of enmity by telling the world, “you must be Christians.”\n\nIt’s time to stop focusing on your theology and be a son of G-d’s commandments the way your master and teacher Jesus was. Your apostle tells you in 2 Thessalonians that the false Christ claims deity, does miracles, and requires submission to his mark. How do you know what the real Jesus was like? The true Jesus observed G-d’s commandments and told us to follow them like he did. He never wanted your prayers or songs of love, your devotion, etc. he said he wants life expressed in the commandments.\n\nJulian, the christian assertion that Israel cannot atone for sin without “jesus blood”/”jesus death” couldn’t be farther from the truth…Nowhere in the Tanach does it even hint that “jesus blood” is needed for Israel to receive forgiveness of sin from Hashem.\n\nLeviticus 17:11 states that blood animal sacrifice is one way to atone for sin. However, it does not state that blood sacrifice is the only way to atone for sin…(also, note that “jesus blood” is also not mentioned here…Only animal blood!)\n\nThe prophet Daniel stood righteous before Hashem without a Temple. He didn’t need “jesus blood” or jesus in any fashion on order to stand righteous before Hashem.\n\nEzekiel 14:14 even if these three men–Noah, Daniel and Job–were in it, they could save only themselves by their righteousness, declares the Sovereign LORD.\n\nYou see, Daniel received forgiveness for his sins INDEPENDENT of jesus during the first exile. He did this by praying and sincerely repenting before Hashem. Daniel 6:11 states that he even did this in the face of death! Clearly, Daniel knew that his sincere repentance to Hashem brought him back to righteousness.\n\nHe was simply following the words of Jeremiah!\n\nThe context of Jeremiah 29 concerns what G-d expects of us during the exile in order to merit the rebuilding of the Holy Temple. Consider what is said in Jeremiah 29:12-14\n\nJeremiah 29:12. And you shall call Me and go and pray to Me, and I will hearken to you.\n\nJeremiah 29:13. And you will seek Me and find [Me] for you will seek Me with all your heart.\n\nJeremiah 29:14. And I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will return your captivity and gather you from all the nations and from all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and I will return you to the place whence I exiled you.\n\nG-d expected that the Israelites would pray to Him while in Babylon. The result of their prayers and repentance allowed them to return to the land and rebuild the Holy Temple.\n\nThis is precisely what Daniel did…\n\nAnd this is precisely what Orthodox Jews do today! Hosea gives us a similar message:\n\nHosea 3:4. For the children of Israel shall remain for many days, having neither king, nor prince, nor sacrifice, nor pillar, nor ephod nor seraphim.\n\nHosea 3:5. Afterwards shall the children of Israel RETURN, and seek the Lord their God and David their king, and they shall come trembling to the Lord and to His goodness at the end of days.\n\nHow do we return to Hashem if we do not have any sacrifices? Hosea tells us in Hosea 14:2-3!\n\nHosea 14:2. RETURN, O Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have STUMBLED IN YOUR INIQUITY.\n\nClearly, the subject of the next verse explains HOW Israel is supposed to RETURN to Hashem so that OUR INIQUITIES WILL BE FORGIVEN. Of course, the next verse explains just that!\n\nHosea 14:3 Take WORDS with yourselves and RETURN TO THE LORD. Say, “YOU SHALL FORGIVE ALL INIQUITY and teach us [the] good [way], and let us render [for] bulls [the offering of] our lips.\n\nEven though we have stumbled in our iniquity and have been put into exile, we still have a means of returning to Hashem though our sincere PRAYERS. We take our words and return to Hashem by saying; “FORGIVE ALL INIQUITY.” Nothing in Hosea 14:2-3 indicates that we need the blood of animals in order to atone for our sins during the exile. And most importantly, NOTHING in Hosea 14:2-3 says we need the blood of jesus!\n\nThis is why Daniel was able to stand righteous before Hashem, praying three times a day, despite the fact that he knew he would be thrown into a pit of lions if he continued to do so. Yet he continued to do so in the face of death! (Daniel 6:11)\n\nIf the Jewish people did not need “jesus blood” to merit the rebuilding of the Holy Temple during the first exile, then why would we need it now?!\n\nHebrews 9:22 is a false statement. It erroneously claims that “without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin.”\n\nLets take a look at II Chronicles 30:16-20 where it is HEZEKIAH’S PRAYER and NOT BLOOD which ATONES for the sins of the people…\n\nII Chronicles 30:16. And they stood in their station as was their custom, according to the Torah of Moses, the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood from the hand of the Levites.\n\nII Chronicles 30:17. For there were many among the congregation who had not consecrated themselves, and the Levites were in charge of the slaughter of the Passover sacrifices for everyone who was unclean, to make it holy for the Lord.\n\nII Chronicles 30:18. For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, for they ate the Passover sacrifice not as it is written, for Hezekiah had PRAYED**for them, saying, *”MAY THE GOOD LORD ATONE FOR*\n\nII Chronicles 30:19. anyone who has set his whole heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his forefathers, though [he be] not [cleaned] according to the purity that pertains the holy things.”\n\nII Chronicles 30:20. And THE LORD HEARKENED TO HEZEKIAH and HEALED the people.\n\nThe Hebrew word יְכַפֵּר is used in verse 18. It means ATONE! Here we see that in the case of Hezekiah’s passover, many of his Israelite guests DID NOT cleanse themselves with BLOOD according to the Law of Moses. In order to ATONE for the sins of his people, King Hezekiah PRAYED TO HASHEM that he should grant ATONEMENT for all those in his Kingdom who truly turned their hearts to Hashem. Now, to further expand on this…In verse 16, it clearly states that the Levites were in charge of sprinkling BLOOD to purify Israel as it is stated in the Torah of Moses…Now, verses 17 and 18 say that there were many in Israel WHO DID NOT PURIFY THEMSELVES WITH THE BLOOD AS IT IS WRITTEN IN THE TORAH! When someone disobeys a Law in the Torah, what do we call that? We call it a SIN! Here, there were individuals who SINNED by NOT being purified by the LEVITICAL PRIESTS OF THE HOLY TEMPLE with BLOOD! Now, according to Hebrews 9:22, the only way to ATONE FOR SIN is through BLOOD! But here, the sin that was committed was that they DIDN’T use blood for atonement…So how is this sin atoned for?\n\nAccording to Hebrew 9:22, it has to be blood! But is that how this sin was atoned for? NO! Their sins were atoned for in this manner:\n\nII Chronicles 30:18 Hezekiah had PRAYED**for them, saying, *”MAY THE GOOD LORD ATONE FOR*\n\nII Chronicles 30:19. anyone who has set his whole heart to seek God, the Lord, the God of his forefathers, though [he be] not [cleaned] according to the purity that pertains the holy things.”\n\nII Chronicles 30:20. And THE LORD HEARKENED TO HEZEKIAH and HEALED the people.\n\nThe sin of those not purified with the blood was atoned for through PRAYER! Thus, Hebrews 9:22 is an inaccurate statement…\n\nAnd if you are still skeptical about atonement without blood, The Hebrew word יִּרְפָּא is used in verse 20 for the word “healed.” The root of this word is רְפָּא which means heal. Amazingly, this same root is used in Isaiah 53:5\n\nIsaiah 53:5. But he was pained because of our transgressions, crushed because of our iniquities; the chastisement of our welfare was upon him, and with his wound we were HEALED.\n\nThe Hebrew word נִרְפָּא is used in verse Isaiah 53:5 for the word “healed.” This shares the SAME ROOT with יִּרְפָּא as shown above. In both cases, (Isaiah 53:5 and II Chronicles 30:20) a form of the word רְפָּא is used for the word “healed.”\n\nClearly, there are circumstances in which atonement can be made through PRAYER, particularly when blood sacrifice is not immediately available…\n\nII Chronicles 33:9-13 demonstrates this same principle:\n\nII Chronicles 33:9-13: “And Manasseh led Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem astray to do what was evil, more than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed from before the Children of Israel. And the Lord spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they did not listen. And the Lord brought upon them the generals of the king of Assyria, and they seized Manasseh with hooks and bound him with copper chains and brought him to Babylon. And when he was distressed, he entreated the Lord his God, and he humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers. And he PRAYED to Him, and He accepted his prayer, and He heard his supplication and He restored him to Jerusalem to his kingdom, and Manasseh knew that the Lord was God.”\n\nHere we see that Manasseh used PRAYER to receive forgiveness of his sins as well. We see that when blood sacrifice is not available, prayer is a valid method of atonement for sin. Also keep in mind that under Manasseh’s rule, the kingdom of Judah was more idolatrous than it had ever been in the past! Clearly, Manasseh’s prayer served as a means of forgiveness/atonement without blood sacrifice and most importantly, without jesus!\n\nHere we have a cause and effect: King Manasseh says a prayer asking for forgiveness and G-d accepts his prayer and restores him as King of Judah. No blood sacrifice was used to atone for King Manasseh as there is nothing in the text that would indicate such.\n\nThis proves that Hebrews 9:22 is a false statement. Blood sacrifice is not the only way to atone for sin. Your jesus has nothing to with our atonement.\n\nMay Israel merit the rebuilding of the Holy Temple and the reinstatement of the Levitical sacrificial system through our sincere prayer and repentance, speedily in our days!\n\nShalom\n\nConcerning Isaiah 53, in order to determine who the servant is, we need to look at the context. Isaiah 49:3-6 is a good place to start.\n\nIsaiah 49:3. And He said to me, “You are My servant, Israel, about whom I will boast.”\n\nIsaiah 49:4. And I said, “I toiled in vain, I consumed my strength for nought and vanity.” Yet surely my right is with the Lord, and my deed is with my God.\n\nIsaiah 49:5. And now, the Lord, Who formed me from the womb as a servant to Him, said to bring Jacob back to Him, and Israel shall be gathered to Him, and I will be honored in the eyes of the Lord, and my God was my strength.\n\nIsaiah 49:6. And He said, “It is too light for you to be My servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the besieged of Israel, but I will make you a light of nations, so that My salvation shall be until the end of the earth.”\n\nSo how is this reconciled? How can Israel bring back Israel? The answer is simple! Isaiah\n\n49:3 refers to a specific part of Israel, namely the righteous remnant. (G-d promised a righteous remnant of Israel throughout all generations.) Verse 5 refers to the remnant bringing back the rest of Israel back to righteousness. And finally, verse 6 refers to the newly restored Israel being “light to the nations” through the revelation of truth through Hashem.\n\nIn other words, this is a two step process:\n\n1. The righteous remnant of Israel will bring back the rest of Israel to righteousness. (Isaiah 49:3-5)\n\n2. The newly restored nation of Israel will serve to be a “light to the nations.” (Isaiah 49:6)\n\nSo ultimately, the nation of Israel is the servant who will be “a light unto the nations.”\n\nHowever, in order to get to that point, the righteous remnant of Israel will first gather back the rest of Israel back to Torah. It’s a two step process.\n\nThe servant is the righteous remnant of ISRAEL.\n\nIsaiah 51:7. Hearken to Me, you who know righteousness, a people that has My Torah in their heart, fear not reproach of man, and from their revilings be not dismayed.\n\nThis is yet another verse which highlights the suffering of G-d righteous servant, Israel. Isaiah 54 even refers to the “SERVANTS of the Lord”!\n\nIsaiah 54:17. Any weapon whetted against you shall not succeed, and any tongue that contends with you in judgment, you shall condemn; this is the heritage of the SERVANTS OF THE LORD and their due reward from Me, says the Lord.\n\nIsaiah 52:15 describes the gentiles kings who will shut their mouths because of their astonishment of Israel’s vindication by Hashem:\n\nIsaiah 52:15 So shall he cast down many nations; kings shall shut their mouths because of\n\nhim, for, what had not been told them they saw, and [at] what they had not heard they gazed.\n\nMicah 7:16-17 echoes this sentiment:\n\nMicah 7:16. Nations shall see and be ashamed of all their might-they shall place a hand upon their mouth; their ears shall become deaf.\n\nMicah 7:17. They shall lick the dust as a snake, as those who crawl on the earth. They shall quake from their imprisonment; they shall fear the Lord, our God, and they shall fear you.\n\nAlso, Isaiah 60:14 speaks of the future Israel who was previously despised by the nations as being vindicated at the end of days, also echoing in line with the suffering/despised servant of Isaiah 53:\n\nIsaiah 60:14 And the children of your oppressors shall go to you bent over, and **THOSE WHO DESPISED YOU** shall prostrate themselves at the soles of your feet, and they shall call you ‘the city of the Lord, Zion of the Holy One of Israel.\n\nSo there you have it. The suffering servant of Isaiah 53 ultimately is the nation of Israel.\n\n**Please note that the Messiah is a part of Israel**\n\nShalom"
