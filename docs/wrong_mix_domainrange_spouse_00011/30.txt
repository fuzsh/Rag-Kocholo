Yashu and Chaitra Mittal first met seven years ago while working together at the same company in India.

“My office was in Delhi and hers was in Bangalore which are two different cities in India, and I went to the Bangalore office for some time which is where I met her,” Yashu said.

The couple knew they were the perfect match after messaging for some time on Facebook. Their connection was instant, sparking their marriage only a year later.

“We started messaging on Facebook and we said ‘yeah, this is going to work,’ so we continued [messaging] for a while and then we decided to take it further and get married,” Chaitra said.

The two families met each other in India to iron out some details before getting married during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

“It just clicked, basically,” Yashu said.

The couple lived together in Boston for about two years before moving to New Hampshire.

“I came to Boston a few years back in 2018, and she came when we got married in 2020,” Yashu said. “So we were in Boston for two years or so and then we moved to another state.”

Yashu and Chaitra enjoyed their time in Boston, but said their favorite activity to do together is traveling and visiting new spots in different countries around the world.

“Both of us love hiking and exploring lots of places whenever we get free time,” Yashu said.
