        "text": "The study was conducted to analyze and compare the role of the World Bank (WB) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to the world economy. IMF and WB As one of the major international financial institutions, policies and structural adjustment programs are considered as a \"cure\" or a \"manual\" for financial and monetary crises. . More and more developing countries want the IMF and the World Bank to help cope with the decline compared to the overall growth of the global economy. However, the policies and support programs of the IMF and WB when implemented in each country, the reaction and results are different. Therefore, the review of monetary and financial policies, the handling of disagreements in policy making as well as the way to coordinate the implementation of the policies and the role of the IMF and the World Bank with governments is extremely important."
