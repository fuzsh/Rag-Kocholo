        "text": "What is this contract?\n\nThis contract is for your Credit Card account (Account) and is between Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and each Account holder.\n\nThe contract includes the following information:\n\nCredit Card Agreement (Agreement)\n\nImportant Terms of Your Credit Card Account\n\nFuture amendments to this contract\n\nBy using or confirming your Account, you and any joint Account holder accept this Agreement's terms. Please carefully read this Agreement and keep it for your records.\n\nback to the top\n\nHow can you use this Account?\n\nYou agree to use your Account only for lawful personal, family, or household purposes that include:\n\nTransaction Type\n\nDetails\n\nBalance Transfers\n\nWhen you transfer a credit balance from another financial institution’s credit card to your Account, including using a check that accesses your Account. Your Account may not be eligible for Balance Transfers.\n\nCash Advances\n\nWhen you use your Credit Card to get cash. These transactions include:\n\nCredit Card use at:\n\nATM\n\nBank teller\n\nWells Fargo Online (Wellsfargo.com) or through the Wells Fargo mobile app\n\nCash-like transactions, such as:\n\nCasino chips\n\nForeign currency\n\nLottery tickets\n\nMoney orders\n\nOff-track wagers\n\nOther wagers\n\nTraveler checks\n\nWire transfers\n\nVouchers you can redeem for cash or similar items\n\nOverdraft protection advances\n\nPurchases\n\n\"Purchases\" means when you use your Credit Card to buy or lease goods or services. Tax payments and associated fees are Purchases. Cash Advances and Balance Transfers are not Purchases.\n\nOther\n\nAny other transactions that we allow.\n\nWe are not responsible for anyone who refuses to accept your Credit Card or any other Credit Access Device. Credit Access Device means a device other than your Credit Card that we allow you to use for accessing your Account to obtain credit, like SUPERCHECKS™ and mobile devices.\n\nKnowing Your Responsibility to Pay\n\nWhen you use your Account or let someone else use it, you promise to pay the total amount of the Purchases, Cash Advances, and Balance Transfers. You also promise to pay all interest, fees, and other amounts that you may owe us.\n\nback to the top\n\nCan you add an authorized Credit Card user to your Account?\n\nYes. To add an authorized user, contact us with the name of the person for whom you want us to issue a Credit Card. You can contact us any time at the number listed on the back of your Credit Card. We will then issue you a new Credit Card in their name.\n\nYou are responsible for paying all charges that the authorized user makes and that you owe us, including any Purchases, Balance Transfers, or Cash Advances. This amount includes all related interest and fees.\n\nProviding Personal Information about Authorized Users\n\nYou agree to give us certain personal information about each authorized user. They must give you permission to give us this information. The details you provide us may include:\n\nName\n\nAddress\n\nSocial security number\n\nIndividual Taxpayer Identification Number\n\nDate of birth\n\nCitizenship details\n\nManaging Credit Card Responsibilities with Authorized Users\n\nYou are not required to have an authorized user on this Account. By adding one, this person is not liable for any Outstanding Balance or any other charges that you or any other authorized user makes. \"Outstanding Balance\" means the total of all unpaid amounts, including:\n\nPurchases\n\nCash Advances\n\nBalance Transfers\n\nInterest\n\nFees\n\nAny other amounts that you may owe us\n\nShould all liable cardholders die, all authorized users’ privileges automatically end. After that, any person who uses the Credit Card agrees to pay us all amounts they owe us. We can choose to pursue the person to pay any Outstanding Balance or other charges they allow.\n\nYou agree to inform each authorized user that all applicable sections of this Agreement also apply to them.\n\nback to the top\n\nCan you use your Credit Card in a mobile app?\n\nYes. We may allow you to load your Credit Card into an app on an electronic device, such as a mobile wallet. You can then use this app to make Purchases and transactions without presenting your Credit Card. Examples of electronic devices include smart phones, tablets, and other devices. Separate terms governing your use of your Credit Card through a mobile device and this Agreement cover those transactions. When you use your Credit Card with your mobile device for transactions, third parties (such as merchants and digital wallet operators) may use and receive information related to your mobile device and the Credit Card transactions.\n\nThird-Party Fees\n\nThird parties may charge you fees for your transaction, such as mobile-carrier data or messaging charges.\n\nRestrictions\n\nAt any time, we may partially or fully restrict your ability to make credit transactions through a third party/mobile device.\n\nAccount Removal\n\nYou agree to promptly notify us by calling the number on the back of your Credit Card if you remove or want to remove your Account information from any app on an electronic device.\n\nPlease note: We have no control over those devices and cannot guarantee how well they work. You also should protect the device’s security the same as you would protect your Credit Card or other valuable information.\n\nback to the top\n\nHow does an international transaction in foreign currency convert to U.S. dollars?\n\nWhen you use your Visa Credit Card to make a transaction in a currency other than U.S. dollars, Visa International (Visa) converts the charge into a U.S. dollar amount. Visa uses one of the following steps to determine the exchange rate between the transaction currency and the billing currency:\n\nSelect a rate from the range available in wholesale currency markets for the applicable central processing date. This rate may vary from the rate Visa receives. Or,\n\nUse the government-mandated rate in effect for the applicable central processing date.\n\nThe processing date’s currency conversion rate may differ from the rate in effect on the transaction date or the date when the transaction posts to your Account.\n\nUsing Merchant Conversions\n\nSome merchants outside of the U.S. can give you an option for how to convert the Credit Card transaction into U.S. dollars. They can have you choose whether you want Visa or the merchant to make the conversion. If you choose for the merchant to do it, then they determine the conversion rate, not Visa. We then do not charge you a foreign currency conversion/foreign transaction fee.\n\nback to the top\n\nWhat interest charges will you owe us?\n\nThe following details describe the interest you may owe each Billing Cycle. You can find details on the APRs that apply to different balances in the document, Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account.\n\nIntroductory and Promotional Rates\n\nIntroductory Rates\n\nYour Account may be eligible for introductory rates. The document, Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account, describes whether you qualify.\n\nPromotional Rates\n\nIf we offer you a promotional rate after you open your Credit Card, then you will receive the terms at that time.\n\nWhen any introductory and promotional rates expire, your remaining balances receive the applicable regular APR terms. You can find these details in the document, Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account.\n\nStandard Variable APR\n\nA variable APR is an interest rate that varies with the market based on the U.S. Prime Rate. To calculate your variable APR for each Billing Cycle, we use the U.S. Prime Rate and add a margin. See the document Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account for the margin on Purchases, Balance Transfers, Cash Advances, and overdraft protection advances on your Account. You can also find details in that document about your Account’s daily periodic rates.\n\nHow We Determine the U.S. Prime Rate\n\nEach Billing Cycle, we use the U.S. Prime Rate that the Wall Street Journal publishes in its Money Rates section three business days before your billing statement’s closing date. When more than one U.S Prime Rates exist, we use an average. If the U.S. Prime Rate is not published or available (temporarily or permanently), we use a substitute index that we believe is similar to the U.S. Prime Rate. We do so at our sole discretion.\n\nA change in the APR may increase or decrease the total amount of interest you pay and your Minimum Payment. If the U.S. Prime Rate changes and affects your APR, the new APR will apply to both existing and future balances on the first day of your Billing Cycle. The APR will continue to vary even if you or we close your Account.\n\nFixed APRs\n\n\"Fixed APRs\" means APRs that do not change with the market based on the U.S. Prime Rate. However, if one or more Fixed APRs apply to your Account, we may change the Fixed APR from time to time. We do so by following the terms that we describe in \"Part 6 – Section 1: Can we change this Agreement?\" of this document. You can find the APRs that apply to your Account in the document, Important Terms of Your Credit Card Account.\n\nback to the top\n\nYour Billing Rights\n\nKeep This Notice For Future Use. This notice tells you about your rights and our responsibilities under the Fair Credit Billing Act.\n\nWhat To Do If You Find a Mistake on Your Statement. If you think there is an error on your statement, write to us at:\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n\nP.O. Box 522\n\nDes Moines, IA 50306-0522\n\nIn your letter, give us the following information:\n\nYour name and Account number;\n\nThe date and dollar amount of the suspected error.\n\nIf you think there is an error on your bill, describe what you believe is wrong and why you believe it is a mistake.\n\nYou can also contact us at the phone number that lists on the back of your card.\n\nYou must contact us:\n\nWithin 60 days after the error appeared on your statement.\n\nAt least 3 business days before an automated payment is scheduled, if you want to stop payment on the amount you think is wrong.\n\nYou must notify us of any potential errors in writing at the address above. You may notify using other ways (including calling us at the telephone number listed on the front of your statement), but if you do we are not required to investigate any potential errors and you may have to pay the amount in question.\n\nWhat Will Happen After We Receive Your Letter.\n\nWhen we receive your letter, we must do two things:\n\nWithin 30 days of receiving your letter, we must tell you that we received your letter. We will also tell you if we have already corrected the error.\n\nWithin 90 days of receiving your letter, we must either correct the error or explain to you why we believe the bill is correct.\n\nWhile we investigate whether or not there has been an error:\n\nWe cannot try to collect the amount in question or report you as delinquent on that amount.\n\nThe charge in question may remain on your statement, and we may continue to charge you interest on that amount.\n\nWhile you do not have to pay the amount in question, you are responsible for the remainder of your balance.\n\nWe can apply any unpaid amount against your Credit Limit.\n\nAfter we finish our investigation, one of two things will happen:\n\nIf we made a mistake: You will not have to pay the amount in question or any interest or other fees related to that amount.\n\nIf we do not believe there was a mistake: You will have to pay the amount in question, along with applicable interest and fees. We will send you a statement of the amount you owe and the date payment is due. We may then report you as delinquent if you do not pay the amount we think you owe.\n\nIf you receive our explanation but still believe your bill is wrong, you must write to us within 10 days telling us that you still refuse to pay. If you do so, we cannot report you as delinquent without also reporting that you are questioning your bill. We must tell you the name of anyone to whom we reported you as delinquent, and we must let those organizations know when the matter has been settled between us. If we do not follow all of the rules above, you do not have to pay the amount you question even if your bill is correct.\n\nYour Rights If You Are Dissatisfied With Your Credit Card Purchases. If you are dissatisfied with the goods or services that you have purchased with your credit card and you have tried in good faith to correct the problem with the merchant, you may have the right not to pay the remaining amount due on the Purchase.\n\nTo use this right, all of the following must be true:\n\nThe Purchase must have been made in your home state or within 100 miles of your current mailing address, and the Purchase price must have been more than $50. (Note: Neither of these are necessary if your Purchase was based on an advertisement we mailed to you, or if we own the company that sold you the goods or services.)\n\nYou must have used your credit card for the Purchase. Purchases made with Cash Advances from an ATM or with a check that accesses your credit card Account do not qualify.\n\nYou must not yet have fully paid for the Purchase.\n\nIf all of the criteria above are met and you are still dissatisfied with the Purchase, contact us in writing at:\n\nWells Fargo Bank, N.A.\n\nP.O. Box 522\n\nDes Moines, IA 50306-0522\n\nWhile we investigate, the same rules apply to the disputed amount as discussed above. After we finish our investigation, we will tell you our decision. At that point, if we think you owe an amount and you do not pay, we may report you as delinquent.\n\nback to the top\n\nActive Duty Military Servicemembers and Their Dependents\n\nThe Military Lending Act Notice: Federal Law provides important protections to members of the Armed Forces and their dependents relating to extensions of consumer credit. In general, the costs of consumer credit to a member of the Armed Forces and his or her dependent may not exceed an annual percentage rate of 36 percent. This rate must include, as applicable to the credit transaction or account: the cost associated with credit insurance premiums, fees for ancillary products sold in connection with the credit transaction, any application fee charged (other than certain application fees for specified credit transactions or accounts), and any participation fee charged (other than certain participation fees for a credit card account).\n\nYou may contact us at 1-844-309-0044 for information about the Military Annual Percentage Rate and a description of your payment obligation.\n\nThe Arbitration Agreement does not apply to you if you are covered by the Military Lending Act nor do any provisions that waive any right to legal recourse under any state or federal law to the extent required by the Military Lending Act.\n\nback to the top"
