        "text": "The toy industry is booming, driven by e-commerce and high demand from both children and adults, especially in Southeast Asia. Especially, sustainable toys are rising stars as the EU’s requirements and commitment to safe materials. Germany, with its rich history in toy manufacturing, plays a pivotal role in this market. And Nuremberg, renowned for its wooden toys, hosts Spielwarenmesse, the world's largest toy fair. This event is crucial for industry decision-makers, showcasing diverse brands and innovative start-ups. It serves as a prime platform for establishing connections, exploring opportunities, and expanding business through interactions with major chain buyers, independent retailers, and media representatives.\n\nIn this podcast episode, we will navigate the current toy industry, including insight into the entry to the EU market, emerging trends, the importance of the EU consumer base, and numerous tips for exporters and retailers in the sector.

Spearheaded by the OECD, this agreement imposes a minimum effective tax rate of 15% on corporate profits, aiming to put an end to the practice of sheltering massive profits in tax havens. Additionally, it aims to eliminate the allure of countries serving as tax havens for corporate giants.\n\nWhile neighboring Southeast Asian economies like Singapore and Thailand have opted to postpone the implementation of the OECD global minimum tax initiative until 2025, Vietnam has set its sights on adopting the tax this year.\n\nIn a significant move, the Vietnam National Assembly passed a Resolution on November 29, 2023, paving the way for the implementation of additional corporate income tax aligned with the Global Anti-Base Erosion Rules (global minimum tax), effective from January 1, 2024.\n\nIn this episode, we're joined by distinguished guests:\n\nThang Vu, Tax Advisor at Luther Law Vietnam\n\nKoen Soenens, General Sales and Marketing Director at DEEP C Industrial Zones\n\nTogether with our host, Trang Dao, Head of Business Development Services at AHK Vietnam, we explore the potential ramifications of this resolution on foreign investors operating in Vietnam.\n\n*****\n\nAHK Vietnam is dedicated to supporting German and international businesses in navigating the complexities of the Vietnamese market.

These climate conditions provide a year-round growing season for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables.\n\n2023 can be considered a fruitful year for Vietnam's fruit and vegetable export market. Statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development showed that the export turnover was estimated at $3.45 billion in the first eight months of this year, an increase of 57.5 percent over the same period last year.\n\nThe export of vegetables and fruits from Vietnam to Europe has shown significant growth compared to the same period last year. The potential for exporting vegetables and fruits to Europe remains substantial. On the other side, the Vietnamese vegetable and fruit industry faces fierce competition with both the EU internal market and export markets with large fruit and vegetable processing industries, such as Peru, Morocco, South Africa, Mexico, China, and India. However, we have successfully leveraged the opportunities brought about by the EVFTA, initially exploring, and succeeding in markets with large import volumes such as France and Germany. These are highly encouraging successes.\n\nLet's join our guests in this podcast episode to explore the potential of this market, its challenges, and opportunities, as well as solutions to enhance trade between the two countries in the fresh fruit and vegetable sector, a highly promising industry:\n\nMr. Dang Phuc Nguyen, General Secretary of Vietnam Fruit and Vegetable Association (VINAFRUIT)\n\nMs. Helly Nguyen, Head of International Sales Department, ANTFARM - Vietnamese exporters to the European market\n\nMr. Marko Walde, Chief Representative of AHK in Vietnam, Myanmar, Cambodia, and Laos\n\nModerator: Ms. Mai Le, AHK Vietnam\n\n***\n\nAHK Vietnam is the Representative in Vietnam for Messe Berlin, where the leading trade show for fresh produce – Fruit Logistica 2024 – will take place from 7-9 February 2024.

Nowadays, Vietnam constantly attracts significant amounts of FDI not only from small and medium-sized enterprises but also from large corporates, especially for German companies which are now diversifying their interest in Asia. One of the key factors driving this growth is the young and willing-to-learn population, and that’s why we want to explore how remarkably suitable education and training affect the quality of the labor force in Vietnam.\n\nDr. Tomas Benz, President of the Vietnamese German University (VGU), and Marko Walde, Chief Representative of AHK Vietnam were bringing to the table insightful contributions from the perspective of an “educator” and a “consultor”. Join us to understand how a German strong education and training system plays a significant role in the country’s economic success and how German dual vocational education and training in Vietnam contribute to the FDI landscape in Vietnam.\n\nTo meet the high demand from numerous foreign companies in Vietnam for finding skilled workers, it is crucial to improve the education and training system. This improvement must happen not only in universities, colleges, or institutions but also in terms of vocational training programs since it is highly valued by German investors. While technological development has made a progress and amazed the world with various applications of AI, young people must put more effort into developing skills and expertise to remain competitive and keep up with global trends. All of these aspects would be raised and enlightened in this talk show guided by the host – Ms. Trang Dao, Head of Business Development Services of AHK Vietnam. So, sit back, relax, and join us for this informative and engaging episode.\n\n***\n\nThe talk show is part of AHK Vietnam’s campaign to celebrate 10 years of our Vocational Education and Training (VET) project in Vietnam since 2013.

Germany has a strong background being a leader in the transition toward a low-carbon-energy system since 2000 with German Energiewende, then German Renewable Energy Law and German Supply Chain Due Diligence Act this year. That’s why they have oriented their production and business activities towards green and sustainable development.\n\nTo be ahead of the trend as well as catch up with this concern from German investors, Vietnam is gradually shifting to a more sustainable economic development model, including the development of industrial parks and construction partners as well. Besides, 52,1% of German investment projects in Vietnam focus on manufacturing and processing industries.

Although Vietnam’s per capita GDP remains relatively low compared to other countries in the region, its economy is expanding faster than any other market. The annual growth hits 8.0% in 2022 and is expected to hit 6.7% in 2023 according to the World Bank’s prognose. Driving the country’s economy are the large and young population, who are willing to evaluate and adopt new technology consumer services, supportive government policies, and a surge in overseas funding.\n\nIn this episode, we would give you a better look at the dynamic environment in Vietnam and how the very new German names are thriving in their business here.\n\nJoining us this time we have Mr. Elmar Dutt – COO of the Deutsches Haus Ho Chi Minh City and Mr. Sang Nguyen – Project Manager of the German Business Incubator Vietnam.\n\nDeutsches Haus is well-known as the symbol of the strategic partnership and friendship between Vietnam and Germany.

A recent World Bank study showed that the implementation of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) will help Vietnam’s GDP increase by up to 3.2 per cent in the next decade. Thanks to the EU-Vietnam agreement, German companies can enjoy protection of investments with trade facilitations when investing in Vietnam.\n\nBased on the improved condition and favourable benefits of EVFTA, we expect to see many FDI flows of high-valued projects of Germany into Vietnam and this country will take advantages of German well-known technology in management & training, more value-added production and less waste of resources.\n\nIn this episode, we are proudly to introduce our valued guests, Ms. Phuong Anh Nguyen, Customer Relationship Manager of Vietinbank Germany Branch, Mr. Jörg-Michael Scheil, Managing Partner Asian of SNB Law, Mr. Michael Chan – Director Sales North from BW Industrial Development JSC and Mr. Tran Van Ngan - Deputy General Director of DINCO Da Nang.

Conversely, The EU is among the Vietnam’s top 4 largest trading partners and Germany is the most important partner country in the EU. In term of FDI, the largest sector of investment by the European companies is industrial processing and manufacturing.\n\nThe EVFTA - EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement officially entered into force in August 2020 and cover tariff as well as non-tariff barriers to trade and other trade related aspects including public procurement, regulatory issues, competition, services, intellectual property rights and sustainable development. For Vietnam, the tariff elimination will benefit key export industries. On the other hand, European companies will also have better access to Vietnam’s emerging and potential market with a population of nearly 100 million.\n\nHowever, the Vietnamese market is now a level playing field and its partners are from very high-developed countries, which requires Vietnam to play to a higher standard. To that end, there are many changes Vietnam is expected to make, and to improve its intellectual property rights (IPR) system is a key part. IPR protection is indeed very important to EU companies and they all have a high demand for IPR protection and would expect Vietnam’s IPR law and practice to help enforce their rights effectively.\n\n>>Therefore, we have Mr. Benoît Tardy, IP Business Advisor and Ms. Nora Bihari, the Project Manager of South-East Asia IP SME HELPDESK and Dr. Torsten Seeger of the Consult to see, as our guests today, sharing their experiences and best practices in Vietnam, in order to inform you the overview of Vietnam’s IP and to help you well prepared in doing business in Vietnam.\n\nFurther information on\n\nSouth-East Asia IP SME Helpdesk:\n\nhttps://intellectual-property-helpdesk.ec.europa.eu/regional-helpdesks/south-east-asia-ip-sme-helpdesk_en\n\nConsult to see\n\nhttp://consultosee.com/en/\n\nTune in (English)\n\nBundesliga - Germany's top flight football league will increase its efforts to become the most popular European league in Vietnam.

Vietnam is the world’s second largest producer and exporter of coffee and the biggest coffee exporter to Germany.\n\nVietnam is a country located in Southeast Asia with tropical and subtropical climate. There is a large area of red soil basalt suitable for coffee growing which was brought by the French in 1857. By the early 2000s, Vietnam became the second largest producer and exporter of coffee beans in the world.\n\nAt the moment, Vietnam's coffee industry is facing severe challenges such as climate change; competition from other crops; need to replace ageing coffee trees; production costs are increasing higher while world coffee prices are at very low levels. Due to intense competition, Vietnam's policy of coffee production has shifted to a new era with two objectives: firstly, to maintain its position as the world’s second largest producer and exporter of coffee green beans; secondly, to double the added value in coffee production by increasing productivity, quality and value addition. It meant FAIR TRADE COFFEE PRODUCTION. Having a system of fair-trade certification for coffee would boost exports to Europe and Germany currently.\n\nVietnam ‘s coffee exports to the EU saw an increase during the first seven months of 2020. The EU represents the second largest market for Vietnamese coffee and accounts for over 42% of the country’s coffee exports. The new EU-Vietnam free trade agreement (EVFTA), which came into effect on August 1, opens up opportunities to further boost Vietnam’s coffee exports to the European Union, which is the world largest coffee market.\n\nWe will talk in this episode on the fair trade coffee in Vietnam and how the fine Robusta from Vietnam could enter the European and German markets effectively and sustainably.
