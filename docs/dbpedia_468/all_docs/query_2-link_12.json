As you may know, the Austin Public Health Department presently classifies the city’s COVID status as Stage 5. Therefore, for the safety of the public and our volunteers, we think it is wise to postpone our special event until later in the Spring. We sincerely hope, pending how the next few months go, to simply reschedule Tet for March or April. Of course, postponing does not diminish our enthusiasm for this event, the event’s ability to be successful, or how much we value your continued support.\n\nSome may wonder if holding Tet a few months later would still hold the same value. While it is atypical to postpone Tet, we are also living in atypical times, given COVID. And, much like our resilient Vietnamese history attests in both Vietnam and the United States, we have always found creative ways to preserve and promote our cultural traditions.\n\nPlease stay tuned for a forthcoming update from VACAT by the end of February or March, as it is still possible we might be able to hold this special event. We thank you for your continued support.\n\nVACAT Thanks our 2022 Sponsors for their generosity. Our next upcoming event is our In-Person Tet Festival on February 5th, 2022.\n\nThank you to Loan Factory, Lien Phat Pages, Amerigroup, Community Care, Austin Elite Realty, Full Tax Services, Pho Please, Emerson, Charles Maund Toyota, Pho Phong Lu’u, and the City of Austin Cultural Arts Division.\n\nWe will be hosting Tet this year on Saturday February 5th at The Holy Family Catholic School Pavilion. We will have cultural programing, celebrations, dragon dance, an ao dai fashion show, a live band, trivia and Vietnamese and carnival games, li -xi, raffles for a 60 inch TV, food vendors and so much more! We can’t wait to see you there!\n\n21st Annual Vietnamese Community Health Fair\n\nThe 21st Vietnamese Community Health Fair was a success thanks to all the wonderful volunteers,VACAT board, AVAMP (Austin Vietnamese American Medical Professional Society) officers, Austin Public Health med students of UT, and future med students among the volunteers.\n\nThe community health fair serviced over 300+ people with language translators in Vietnamese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Burmease.

Thank you everyone for coming out and creating new memories and traditions with us.\n\nAfter canceling all of our cultural events last year due to COVID-19, we were so happy to have come back and celebrated with a socially distanced outdoor event. This was opened to everyone in the greater Austin area to come celebrate and learn about Vietnamese culture. We celebrated Tet Trung Thu with live music and performances, vendors, fundraisers, and free balloons, light up lanterns and glowsticks. We appreciate everyone for coming out and staying masked.
