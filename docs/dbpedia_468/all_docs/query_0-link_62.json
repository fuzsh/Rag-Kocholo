It is not possible to register for both types of submissions at the same time.\n\nIt is important that applicants carefully state and check the correctness of data entered during registration (including spaces and typos), as the application will not be accepted if there are any discrepancies.​​​​​​​\n\nThe appointment of a visit to verify the signature or superlegalization of official documents of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam can be only booked online.\n\nThe service is available in two-month intervals in advance.\n\nIn the upcoming period, on 5th September, 2024, from 9:00 AM local time, the appointments reservation for the months of October and November 2024 will be opened.\n\nBooking will be possible until the appointments are fully booked."
