        "text": "A few months ago, I've been in Japan for the first time. I liked it as soon as I arrived there, but it was hard to identify the reason. It took me a while before I understood that the most attractive side of Nippon for me is how much effort people invest into what they do. Don't get me wrong, many local things look ridiculous: brochures, ads, local websites, etc. Meanwhile, many more things are made with extreme attention and effort. Street tiles are made and placed with microscopic precision, hotel rooms utilize every cubic millimeter of spacer in the most efficient and cozy way, with perfect night lighting, and much more. I saw examples of highly polished products wherever I was looking. I guess such duality is caused by the perception of what is important and what isn't. Important things must be perfect, not important thighs not worth bothering. Interestingly, importance levels there are always extreme. \"Average\" isn't about Japan. I hope I could visit it again soon. Meanwhile, for me, the perfect metaphor to describe the country for now is this: Japan is the only pixel-perfect country in the world\n\n🏔️🌟 Unlocking New Heights: Embracing Adventure and Opportunity 🌟🏔️ Have you ever felt the rush of standing atop a mountain summit, gazing out at a world that stretches endlessly before you?

Let’s make this journey together. 🌍🎌 #AdventureAwaits #DiscoverJapan #GateToSeason #EmbraceTheUnknown\n\n4 years ago, I made a trip around the world. And I learned an important lesson in Japan. 🇯🇵 In Japan, most streets have no names. Streets are just the empty space in-between blocks of buildings. These blocks have numbers. The rest of the world uses street names. But Japan shows that the opposite can work too. The internet is full of advice. Do this. Become that. But you have a unique mix of skills, experiences, and perspectives. So think critically. Don't blindly follow advice. Instead, do experiments to find what works for you. But don't take my word for it 😉 #personaldevelopment #data\n\nIs Japan an Affordable Place to Live? Japan, renowned for its rich culture, technological innovation, and stunning landscapes, captivates the imagination of people from around the world. However, amidst the allure of Japan's vibrant cities and serene countryside, one question looms large: Is Japan an affordable place to live? In this in-depth exploration, we'll dissect the various aspects of the cost of living in Japan, uncovering the nuances that define the affordability of life in the Land of the Rising Sun. https://lnkd.in/gmKSSChR\n\nKOREA- THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HIGH OF ASIA. What?? I spend a lot of time on Korean related projects and am struck by the similarity of geography and passion for the outdoors between Korea and Colorado. After living in Tokyo for 15 years (which was extraordinary), we wanted a place where we could hike, bike and I wouldn’t have to wear a suit and tie, so we relocated to Colorado. Most Koreans have no idea about Colorado except, from time to time, one of them will sing me snippets of John Denver’s Rocky Mountain High. Come on. You know that song is playing in your head right now….Koreans take singing karaoke (noraebang) really serious so they all sound like John Denver or Wayne Newton... -Mountains cover 70% of the Korean peninsula. Colorado, about 40%. -1 in 3 Koreans goes hiking more than once a month, and hiking is considered a part of Korea’s national identity. 92% of Coloradans participate in outdoor activities and has 39,000 miles of hiking trails. To my Korean clients, do not bring business attire. Bring t-shirts and shorts. P.S. Beer seems to be another similarity, but I will leave that story for another post.

Immersing myself in Japanese culture through food, books, YT videos, and documentaries has only fueled my fascination. From Godzilla💓 to Pikachu💓💓, my love for Japan runs deep, and I always strive to be well-prepared for my future adventures. The history of Japan is as chequered as it is fascinating. The country's remarkable post-World War II resurgence is truly miraculous. Despite its rapid modernisation, Japan still cherishes its traditions, preserving them in everyday life. Have any of you had the opportunity to travel, work, grow up, or currently reside in Japan? I am eager to hear your experiences and insights on this beautiful country. Whether it's sharing observations or revealing little-known facts about Japan, I look forward to learning more from your perspectives. Please comment below. Arigatō! 🌸🗾 #Japan #JapaneseCulture #TravelGoals #projectmanagement ##projectsupport\n\nIn 2005, I came to Japan for the first time, expecting a technological wonderland. Tokyo's Shiodome district met these expectations with its futuristic elevated train systems and cyberpunk ambiance. However, I soon discovered that the true allure of Japan wasn't technology. My current visit to Fukuoka reinforces why I love Japan. Here, amidst vibrant contrasts and cultural richness, I find a deeper connection to life's simpler pleasures. Contrary to popular belief, Japan's charm doesn't lie in ubiquitous tech. The true magic lies in simpler, authentic experiences—dining at family-owned restaurants, the handwritten menus, paying in cash, and engaging in meaningful human connections. But life in Japan is changing, creating a sense of urgency. In the past, there was a similar urgency during and after the rapid economic growth in the sixties and seventies, driven by technological developments. Some people thought Japan's future would be hyper-technological and resemble a dark, cyberpunkish world, a concept now known as techno-orientalism, where humans and machines would merge, and machines would enhance human senses. Today, the urgency lies in the challenge of overtourism. and social media-driven tourists disrupting local life. It's an SOS message to the world. I hope we soon rediscover what truly matters—a simpler, authentic and more connected world. https://lnkd.in/eYmg_zfx #life #society #travel #technology #future #artificialintelligence #TechnoOrientalism #Cyberpunk #NeoPunk #Change #SimplerLiving #Japan #Fukuoka #CulturalHeritage #Overtourism #HumanConnections"
