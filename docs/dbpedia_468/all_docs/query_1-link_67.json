        "text": "By the end of December 2016, the country had 1,149 people's credit funds and cooperative banks, with more than 2 million members being households participating in the loan. With the goal of association, mutual assistance members, people's credit funds have created a favorable financial mechanism, friendly; promote the spirit of mutual affection in the social community.\n\nParticularly, in the context of new agricultural construction being actively implemented in many localities, the capital from the People's Credit Fund is very important to help people reduce hunger and reduce poverty, build local...\n\nSome policies on the operation of People's Credit Funds\n\nThe effectiveness of the People's Credit Fund (PCF) model has been recognized in many localities throughout the country. Where PCFs are available, members and households are able to reduce poverty and support their livelihoods. Extreme local economic development region, take advantage of idle capital in the community, help farmers solve their difficulties.\n\nThis has resulted from the fact that in the past years, the Party and State have had many policies to renovate and create conditions for the People's Credit Fund to develop and people have easy access to loans.\n\nThe Resolution of the XIth National Party Congress affirmed: \"Building new rural areas: planning for rural development and urban development, promoting the construction of rural infrastructure, creating a favorable environment to exploit all possibilities. Investment in agriculture and rural areas \"is the task of developing our country.\n\nContinuing the Party Congress XII, continued to affirm: \"Effectively implement three strategic breakthroughs, overall restructuring and economic synchronization associated with innovation model growth; To accelerate the industrialization and modernization of the country, attach importance to the industrialization and modernization of agriculture and rural areas in association with the building of new rural areas. \"\n\nOn the basis of orientation, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) has implemented programs on \"credit policy for agricultural and rural development\".\n\nAccordingly, the State Bank of Vietnam issued Circular No. 04/2015/ TT-NHNN regulating the PND to replace Circular No. 08/2005 /TT-NHNN dated 30 December 2005, which guides a number of articles of Decree No. 48/2001 / ND-CP dated 13 August 2001 on the organization and operation of the People's Credit Fund and Decree No. 69/2005/ND-CP dated 26 May 2005 amending and supplementing a number of articles of Decree No. 48/2001/ ND -CP dated 13 August 2001 on the organization and operation of the PCF; Circular 06/2007/TT-NHNN dated 06/11/2007 amending and supplementing Circular 08/2005 / TT-NHNN dated 30 December 2005 guiding the implementation of some articles of Decree 48/2001. Decree No. 69/2005 / ND-CP dated 13/8/2001 on organization and operation of the People's Fund and Decree No. 69/2005 / ND-CP dated 26/8/2005 on amending and supplementing some articles of Decree 48/2001 / ND-CP dated 13/8/2001 on the organization and operation of business loans.\n\nThe promulgation of a series of policies has created an unity in the legal system on the organization and operation of the FUND, aimed at ensuring the safety in operation, raising the efficiency of the operation quality. The foundation of the PCF, meeting the needs of new agricultural and rural development in Vietnam...\n\nSome suggestions and recommendations\n\nIn order to bring into full play the strengths and achievements in the development of the PCF, in addition to continuing to overcome shortcomings, completing the policy, the following solutions should be implemented synchronously:\n\nAbout lending activities\n\nAccording to Article 37 of the Circular No. 04/2015 / TT-NHNN on lending subjects, lending to households for the purpose of building new rural areas is not paid enough attention. In order to ensure an effective policy for rural development, it is necessary to coordinate with the PCF system in developing internal regulations to guide implementation, including:\n\n- Develop a specific loan plan in each period. Accordingly, the Fund should have a clear strategy in the course of operation. That is, it is necessary to have a specific activity plan in each stage, to define the objectives for each stage, to analyze the environmental factors objectively and to see opportunities and challenges for the fund's objectives and The common development of agriculture and rural areas.\n\n- Currently, most FMFs do not have a complete broadcasting program outside the local radio station or through meetings of local authorities and socio-political organizations. locality.\n\nMany households in need of loans for production but not members of the fund, do not know about the existence of the fund, or households with difficult circumstances but not on the list of poor households issued by the People's Committee District approval. Therefore, it is necessary to promote and propagandize the policy of building new rural areas effectively.\n\nOn the management of lending activities\n\nAccording to Circular No. 04/2015 / TT-NHNN, the PND should issue an internal regulation on lending and management of loans to ensure the proper use of loans, including the following: Particularly, lending to non-member individuals, households, legal entities, and non-member households includes: (i) Procedures for assessing, assessing the need and purpose of borrowing capital. rim; (Ii) Loan approval procedure and approval, decision on debt restructuring; (Iii) Loan approval process for poor non-members; (Iv) appropriate disbursement procedures; (V) procedures for control, management and supervision to ensure the proper use of the loan; (Vi) Regulations on security assets in accordance with law (if any), methods of determining the value of security assets and the disposal of security assets to recover loans in accordance with law; (Vii) Interest rates, loans ...\n\nHowever, during the implementation of the provisions of the law on loan security, there are still some problems that make the People's Credit Fund system embarrassing to promulgate internal regulations on loan security.\n\nAuthorities responsible for developing legal documents should consider the inadequacies of the system of legal documents related to security assets. Specifically:\n\n- The completion of the provisions of the law on loan security by property mortgage must be in accordance with the principle: Mortgage is the right of ownership does not appear the transfer of ownership of property, not only the owner of the property. But even non-proprietors who have the right to dispose of property may also enter into a mortgage relationship.\n\n- Complete the provisions of the subject are the household as the following: Household is determined by the land allocation documents or household registration book issued by police? Identify the specific household as the subject of civil relations in general and of the mortgage relationship in particular. What are the bases and criteria of the members of the household? In which case, the household head was involved in the mortgage relationship in the name of the household?\n\n- To amend and supplement the system of land legislation relating to mortgaging, guaranteeing land use rights and real estate in the direction of: Permitting land-using plots to be granted by land users Certificate of land use right for mortgage. To amend the regulations on administrative procedures on land allocation and land lease in the direction of simplicity, clarity, transparency and convenience.\n\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) study; taxation has an impact on foreign investment, mainly direct investment; At the same time significant impact on the allocation of financial resources. In order to attract investment capital, the competitiveness of taxes and tax policies is very important for each country and Vietnam is not out of context.\n\nUnderstandably, tax competition is a comparative advantage for a country that has a comparative advantage in order to attract resources, labor and other economic factors from abroad into (or at the same time) Transfer of domestic resources abroad. There are many forms of tax competition such as tax rate cuts, tax incentives, long-term losses, simplification and shortening of tax administration.\n\nCriteria for assessing international tax competitiveness\n\nCurrently, the World Bank uses quantitative criteria to assess the tax competitiveness of countries as follows:\n\n- Criterion 1: Time the business performs the average state tax procedure in a year. It is time to prepare, fill out and pay tax. Preparation time includes the time needed to collect tax information to calculate the tax payable. Timeframes include time to complete forms and calculations. Tax payment time includes tax payment time online or at tax office, wait time. The less time is, the better the business and it also demonstrates simple administrative procedures, convenience.\n\n- Criterion 2: Average number of times an enterprise has to pay tax for one year. The number of tax payments reflects the number of tax payments paid, method of payment, frequency of payment. The number of payments recorded both electronic payments. These indicator small branches are better for businesses.\n\n- Criterion 3: Total tax rate: This is the percentage between the total tax and other obligations the enterprise has to make to the state on the total business profits.\n\nThese three criteria are ranked individually for each country in order from low to high, and then aggregated into the index of competitiveness of taxes among countries by the average. The lower the order, the higher the competitiveness of taxes and vice versa. The World Bank through its KPMG auditing firm investigates and collects data from medium-sized companies in 189 economies around the world.\n\nCompetitiveness of Vietnam's taxation\n\nThe World Bank assesses the competitiveness of taxes in countries around the world in general and in Vietnam in particular through its annual reports (PwC). Accordingly, Vietnam is considered to have dramatically changed in recent years in terms of tax competitiveness. Particularly, as Vietnam increasingly integrates into the international economy, it fulfills its tax commitments when it comes to signing free trade agreements and enhancing business environment reform. This has been highly appreciated by many international organizations and domestic and foreign business community.\n\nHowever, compared with some countries in the Asia Pacific region, the criteria for assessing Vietnam's tax competitiveness are higher, especially the criteria of average tax compliance time. A company is still high compared to the requirements of enterprises. Administrative procedures related to tax and customs have been drastically reduced by the Ministry of Finance, but the requirements of enterprises should continue to simplify further. In response to this request, the Government and the Ministry of Finance have made a number of moves to further reduce and simplify administrative procedures related to taxation in the coming time to improve their competitiveness and the business environment.\n\nIn particular, with the determination to improve the business environment, continuously from 2014 to now, the Government has issued Resolutions 19 to improve the business environment in Vietnam. The World Bank's 2017 Business Suitability Annual Report shows that Vietnam ranks 82nd out of 190 economies, an increase of 9 degrees from 2016. Compared to the folding table Last year, Vietnam was promoted to 9th rank (in 2016, Vietnam ranked 91st with 61.11 / 100). The important contribution to this promotion is the dramatic reform of administrative procedures in the field of taxation as well as innovations in tax policy following the trend of integration.\n\nSome issues need further attention\n\nContinuously from 2014 to 2017, the Prime Minister has issued Resolutions 19 on improving the business environment, enhancing national competitiveness, which outlines the urgent orientations for improvement competitiveness of the tax. In implementing Resolution 19 of the Government, the Ministry of Finance has come up with the spirit of determination and has brought many positive results, contributing significantly to improving the business environment in Vietnam. However, prior to the integration requirements, the completion of appropriate policy tools and tax administration should continue. Accordingly, in order to improve Vietnam's tax competitiveness, improve the business environment and attract foreign capital flows, it is necessary to continue to pay attention to the following issues:\n\nFirstly, continue implementing the reform of administrative procedures. Review and simplify tax administrative procedures; Forms, simple profile components; Specifying the responsibilities of each department and tax administration staff in receiving and handling; Amend and amend the tax regulations in line with changes in administrative procedures and reduce the frequency of tax declaration to reduce the compliance burden for taxpayers.\n\nSecond, to strengthen taxpayer support, it is necessary to further strengthen the training of new tax policy for taxpayers; Enhanced contact, dialogue, counseling via hotline or voicemail; Encourage the development of tax agents.\n\nThird, the tax policy changes in line with common international practices such as unifying a value added tax rate; Beside the implementation of the CIT reduction schedule, special tax incentives should be formulated for start-up projects such as low tax rates and CIT exemption for the first years from the profitable year; Uniformity of a method of calculating personal income tax on income from transfer of real estate, transfer of securities ...\n\nFourthly, to perfect tax administration modernization, focus on building a modern and highly confidential communication infrastructure for tax collection; Soon complete the system of electronic tax services to deploy in enterprises; Collaborate and exchange information with international organizations.\n\nAnnual non-life insurance premium is 40%; abolishing the regulations on prerequisites for prized video game machines; supplementing the regulations on guiding the practice of tax agents; revising regulations on the use of customs declaration... are some new financial policies, effective in July 2017.\n\nShip owners must pay repatriation expenses to crew members\n\nThe Ministry of Finance has just issued Circular No. 38/2017 / TT-BTC guiding the payment of repatriation expenses for crew members. This Circular applies to crewmen working onboard Vietnamese seagoing vessels operating on international routes; Owners of Vietnamese seagoing vessels whose ships operate on international routes; State management agencies, organizations and individuals involved in the\n\nThe cost of repatriation of the crew will be paid by the shipowner, including: the cost of going to the place of repatriation specified in the contract; Expenses for meals and accommodation of crew members calculated from the time of departure from the seagoing vessel until the time of arrival at the repatriation destination; salaries and allowances for crew members traveling from the time they leave the ship until the time of arrival at the repatriation destination; maximum 30 kilograms (kg) of personal luggage and essential medical care costs.\n\nThe shipowner is responsible for financial security to cover repatriation expenses. In cases where the ship owners fail to ensure adequate financial sources for repatriation of repatriated crew members, the credit institutions and foreign bank branches shall provide guarantee for the ship owners to pay expenses.\n\nThis Circular takes effect on 01 July 2017.\n\nProvide financial support to public higher education institutions\n\nEffective from 1 July 2017 and applied since the tax year 2016, Circular 47/2017 / TT-BTC of the Ministry of Finance issued on 15 May 2017 guided support funds from the state budget for tertiary education establishments and public professional education establishments shall be experimentally renewed according to the Government's Resolution No. 77 / NQ-CP of 24 October 2014 of the Government.\n\nAccordingly, Circular 47/2017 / TT-BTC apply to tertiary education institutions and public professional education establishments approved by the Prime Minister to experimentally renovate the mechanism of operation.
