By this schedule, construction would break ground in December 2014, with completion of the first unit in late 2017 and the second in early 2018.[4][5]\n\nIn April 2015, after long delays, Petrovietnam signed on Vietnamese company Lilama Corporation as the plant's engineering, procurement, & construction (EPC) contractor. According to the contract, Unit 1 would be completed in Q2 2019 and Unit 2 in Q4 2019.[6] Construction began in May 2015.[7] As of May 2017, construction was on track for 2019 completion.[8]\n\nIn early 2017, there were a number of news articles suggesting that the bidding process for various components of the plant (especially the flue-gas desulphurization system) were flawed, resulting in cheap and potentially faulty components being used.[9][10]\n\nIn November 2018, the plant's high and intermediate pressure turbines were installed and construction was expected to be complete by 2020.[11] As of January 2019, construction was 70% complete.[12]\n\nIn June 2019, the completion date for Sông Hậu-1 was delayed to 2021 in the Ministry Of Industry And Trade's report on the implementation of the revised seventh Power Development Plan (PDP7).[13] In August 2019, construction was 77% complete and the project was running two years behind schedule.[14] The project has been delayed by a funding shortfall that has left contractors unpaid and by delays in building the 120 km-long Hau River-Duc Hoa 500 kV transmission line, which would carry power from the plant.[14]\n\nIn November 2020 Unit 1 was connected to the national grid and was on schedule to be commissioned in Q1 2021.[15] Unit 2 was connected to the grid in January 2021.[16] In May 2021, construction was 96.8% complete, and both units were expected to begin commercial operation by the end of 2021.[17] Construction of Unit 1 was completed in November 2021 but the plant was not yet commissioned. Construction of Unit 2 was scheduled to be completed in February 2022.[18] Unit 1 was commissioned on Nov. 27, 2021.[19]\n\nOn July 4, 2022, the Ministry of Industry and Trade appeared to provide an update on the draft PDP. The document’s list of major power projects planned for 2021-2030 (PDF pages 18-20) states that construction of Unit 2 had finished and test runs had begun. The plant was slated for operation in the second half of 2022.[20]\n\nIn July 2022, an inauguration ceremony for Song Hau 1 took place. According to reports, the power station's Unit 2 came online for commercial operation earlier in the year.[21]\n\nIn August 2023, Viet Phat Import-Export Trade Investment Joint Stock Company signed a VND 6,023.7 billion agreement to supply coal for Sông Hậu-1 in 2023-2024.[22]\n\nSông Hậu-2\n\nIn April 2011, Toyo Ink Group Berhad, the Malaysian branch of Japan's Toyo Ink Group, announced that it would be pursuing the development of the two-unit, $3.5 billion, 2,000-MW Sông Hậu-2 plant, after provincial authorities approved the company's proposal.[23] In January 2012, Toyo Ink signed a consultancy agreement with Vietnam's Power Engineering and Consulting Joint Stock Company 2 for the construction of the plant.[24]\n\nIn August 2013, Toyo Ink signed a memorandum of understanding with the Ministry of Industry & Trade for construction of the plant. The plan calls for the first unit to come online in 2021, and the second in 2022. The Ministry stated that it would sign a build, operate, & transfer (BOT) agreement with Toyo Ink as soon as the latter lined up coal suppliers and electricity sales agreements; Toyo Ink stated that it expected the BOT agreement to be finalized in 2014. Coal would be imported from Indonesia or Australia. Industry experts apparently believed that negotiating the power price with Electricity of Vietnam would take time, and would potentially lengthen this time frame.[25]\n\nAs of mid-2015, the BOT agreement had apparently not yet been finalized. In July 2015, Toyo Ink sought shareholders' permission to spend an additional $35 million on consultancy costs for Sông Hậu-2.[26] In October 2016, provincial officials noted that site clearance was behind schedule, and called on district officials to strengthen the procedures for resettling people living on the site.[27]\n\nIn January 2017, Toyo Ink signed a land lease agreement with the Vietnamese authorities for the plot on which the power plant will be located. The project had an estimated project cost of US$3.45 billion, and Toyo Ink said it was looking at jointly developing the project via a special purpose vehicle (SPV) with a partner, but will retain a 40% equity interest to remain the single largest shareholder of the project. The SPV will fund about 25% of the total cost, while the remaining 75% will be financed via bank borrowings.[28]\n\nIn February 2017, Vietnam’s Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment approved Toyo Ink’s environmental impact assessment for the Song Hau 2 coal plant.[29]\n\nIn a visit to the area in March 2017, Vietnam's Deputy Prime Minister called for accelerated price negotiations to help speed up the project.[30]\n\nAs of late November 2017, the BOT contract had not yet been signed, and the EIA was being revised.[31]\n\nIn September 2018, Toyo Ink estimated that the plant would be commissioned by 2025.[32] In June 2019 the completion date for Sông Hậu-2 was listed as 2024 in the Ministry Of Industry And Trade's report on the implementation of the revised seventh Power Development Plan (PDP7).[33] In February 2020 the National Steering Committee stated that Unit 1 was scheduled to be commissioned in Q1 2025 and Unit 2 in Q2 2025.[34]\n\nAs of early March 2020, there were no indications that financing for the Sông Hậu-2 plant had been secured.\n\nIn December 2020, it was announced that Toyo Ink had signed the BOT contract with Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade for the Song Hau 2 project, with a government guarantee from the Vietnamese government also attached to the deal. The government guarantee includes protection for the company against default on all Vietnam project counterparties, changes in law and government event risks. Further guaranteed is at least 30% of the conversion from Vietnamese Dong to US dollars for the project’s tariff revenue that is received under the power purchase agreement after deducting all operational expenditures. The Vietnamese government has also granted the project tax incentives, including favourable corporate income tax rates and exemption from import duties. Toyo said that the estimated US$3.23 billion project costs \"will be financed via a mix of debt and equity financing. The board is still in the midst of reviewing various investments and funding options, including identifying strategic investors and other suitable parties to co-invest in the project.\"[35]\n\nIn January 2021, Toyo Ink announced that it was partnering with China Energy Engineering Corporation, a Chinese state-owned enterprise, to develop Song Hau 2. The two companies had entered into an investment and development agreement, through which China Energy would acquire an equity stake in the project.[36]\n\nIn May 2021, the People's Committee of Hau Giang province was working on plans to resettle 714 households to clear the construction site of Sông Hậu-2.[37]\n\nAn October 2021 report by GreenID lists the Sông Hậu-2 power station as one of 18 coal-fired power stations in Vietnam that was struggling to secure financing. Given that China, Japan, and South Korea have all committed to stop financing new coal-fired power stations, it will be extremely difficult for any of these projects to secure funding in the future.[38] In March 2022, Report No. 1562 by the Office of the Government of Vietnam stated that the plant was financially troubled.[39]\n\nIn January 2023, IJ Global wrote that Toyo Ink targets to arrange $2.4billion syndicated financing facilities with a debt/equity ratio of around 75.25. Export-Import Bank of Malaysia was signed up in November 2022 as the MLA, bookrunner and arranger for the project's debt financing.[40]\n\nIn February 2023, Toyo Ink was continuing to pursue the project. They claimed to have (Google translate): \"a solution to solve the problem of funding for compensation and resettlement remaining\". The investors and developers stated that they were awaiting approval by the Ministry of Industry and Trade.[41] 742 households impacted by Sông Hậu-2 were to be resettled in the Mai Dam Resettlement Area.[42]\n\nIn March 2023, Toyo Ventures stated that a US$86 million operation and maintenance contract for Sông Hậu-2 had been awarded to Power Engineering Consulting Joint Stock 2 (TV2). This was in addition to a US$2.42 billion construction contract awarded one week prior. Toyo Ventures also stated that the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia had offered to be the \"mandated lead arranger and bookrunner and coordinating arranger for the syndicated financing facilities of up to US$2.42 billion for the construction of the power plant\". The project was expected to be operational within four and a half years of construction start.[43]\n\nIn May 2023, Vietnam officially approved the updated power development plan (PDP8). Under this plan, the country will domestically generate 20% of its electricity needs with coal by 2030 and fully phase out coal-fired power stations by 2050. The plan involved increasing energy generation using coal to a peak of 30 GW and replacing all other outstanding coal projects with LNG or renewables. PDP8 listed Song Hau II among the projects that were \"behind schedule, facing difficulties in changing shareholders, arranging capital\". The proposal was not officially cancelled, but it was required to either move forward by June 2024 or be terminated.[44]\n\nAs of December 2023, construction of Sông Hậu-2 was expected to begin in 2024.[45]\n\nIn January 2024, the Southern Power Project Management Board announced that they were moving forward with a 133 km, 500kV transmission line to connect Song Hau 1 and Song Hau 2 to the national grid system. It was referred to as the Song Hau-Duc Hoa line project.[46]\n\nAs of February 2024, Sông Hậu-2 was described as being in a \"worrying situation\" (Google translate), as the project had not yet been allocated capital and was at risk of being terminated by Ministry of Industry and Trade at the end of June 2024 in accordance with PDP8.[47]\n\nOn April 1, 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade issued Sông Hậu-2 a 90 day warning about the project's possible suspension. The \"Thông báo Ý định chấm dứt\" (Notice of Intent to Terminate) reaffirmed the June 30, 2024 deadline to achieve financial close. After the announcement, share prices of TV2 reportedly dropped 7%.[48] At the end of April 2024, funding was reportedly still pending.[49]\n\nIn June 2024, three weeks before the June 30, 2024 deadline, Toyo Ink officially secured the project's investment from the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia.[50] Sông Hậu-2's development would put Vietnam at risk of breaching JETP commitments.[51][52] The power station was expected to enter construction as soon as July 2024.[53]\n\nHowever, in July 2024, the Ministry of Industry and Trade terminated the BOT contract for Song Hau II.[54]\n\nSông Hậu-3\n\nThe proposed 2,000-MW Sông Hậu-3 apparently does not yet have a developer. In October 2013, Samsung expressed interest in the project, among others in Vietnam.[55] In 2014, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) expressed interest in the project, and began studying its feasibility in May.[56][57] The project was announced as cancelled in the 2016 PDP7 (see below).\n\nFinancing\n\nSông Hậu-1\n\nAt the end of 2016, it was reported in the financial press that overall funding of US$1.2 billion had been secured. Korea Trade Insurance Corporation (K-Sure) and Korea Export-Import Bank (Kexim) will jointly provide financing of US$987 million alongside a consortium of nine international commercial banks who will provide a further US$213 million 10-year syndicated loan.[58] These nine banks include Citibank, Cathay United Bank, DBS Bank, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, DZ Bank, Credit Agricole, Mizuho Bank and OCBC Bank.[59][59][59][58]\n\nSông Hậu-2\n\nIn January 2023, IJ Global wrote that Toyo Ink targets to arrange $2.4billion syndicated financing facilities with a debt/equity ratio of around 75.25. Export-Import Bank of Malaysia was signed up in November 2022 as the MLA, bookrunner and arranger for the project's debt financing.[40][43]\n\nIn May 2023, Song Hau 2 Power Company Limited (a subsidiary of Toyo Ink) reportedly received Indicative Principal Terms and Conditions for the syndicated loan.[60]\n\nIn August 2023, financial close was expected by September or October.[61] As of September 7, financial close was pending, according to one media report.[62]\n\nIn November 2023, Toyo Ink reportedly received a letter of authorization from Export-Import Bank of Malaysia, lead arranger for the 2.42 billion USD syndicated loan.[63] In the same month, Toyo Ventures announced that it had received a letter from Vietnam’s Ministry of Industry and Trade granting an extension period until June 30, 2024 to make financial arrangements for this thermal power project.[64]\n\nIn June 2024, Toyo Ink achieved financial close on the $980 million loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of Malaysia.[50] However, the facility was voided following the termination of the BOT contract just a few weeks later.[65]\n\nSông Hậu 2 Industrial Park\n\nIn November 2023, Kinh Bac Urban Development Corporation approved the development of a 5,570 billion VND \"Song Hau Industrial Park 2 Technical Infrastructure Investment and Construction Project\" (Google translate). The 380 hectare area would be constructed to be subleased for various industrial uses and would reportedly employ 20,000 people. Investment planning would be ongoing through December 2023, and construction was slated to take place between July 2025 and December 2026. The industrial park would be adjacent to Sông Hậu-2 Thermal Power Plant.[66]\n\nRevised Power Development Plan VII\n\nAccording to PDP7, released in 2016, Phase I is in construction with completion scheduled for 2019, Phase II is scheduled for completion in 2021 and 2022, and Phase III is cancelled.[67]\n\nJust Energy Transition Partnership\n\nIn December 2022, Vietnam and a coalition of countries led by the European Union and the UK concluded a Just Energy Transition Partnership agreement with US$15.5 billion to fund the development and implementation of a plan to cap and then phase out unabated coal generation. The agreement proposed reducing Vietnam’s coal fleet capacity from 37 GW to 30.2 GW by 2030 and a path to “phasing out unabated coal-fired power generation after those dates.” As of January 2023, the Global Coal Plant Tracker estimated Vietnam had 24.7 GW in coal capacity, with a further 6.1 GW under construction. The deal noted a detailed plan would be finalized by November 2023 to guide the long-term transition plan.[68][69][70]\n\nArticles and Resources\n\nReferences\n\nAdditional data"
