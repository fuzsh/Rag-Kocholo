We monitor all traffic to and from our web servers for indications of spamming. Customers suspected to be using our products and services for the purpose of sending spam are fully investigated. If we determine there is a problem with spam, we will take the appropriate action to resolve the situation.\n\nWe define spam as the sending of Unsolicited Commercial Email (UCE), Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE) or Unsolicited Facsimiles (Fax), which is email or facsimile sent to recipients as an advertisement or otherwise, without first obtaining prior confirmed consent to receive these communications.

In order to use our products and services, you must not only abide by all applicable laws and regulations but you must also abide by this no spam policy. Commercial advertising and/or bulk emails or faxes may only be sent to recipients who have âopted-inâ to receive messages. They must include a legitimate return address and reply-to address, the sender's physical address, and an opt-out method in the footer of the email or fax. Upon request by us, conclusive proof of opt-in may be required for an email address or fax number.\n\nIf we determine the services in question are being used in association with spam, we will re-direct, suspend, or cancel any web site hosting, domain registration, email boxes or other applicable services until customer responds. The registrant or customer will be required to respond by email to us stating that they will cease to send spam and/or have spam sent on their behalf. In the event we determine the abuse has not stopped after services have been restored the first time, we may terminate the hosting and email boxes associated with the domain name in question.\n\nWe encourage all customers and recipients of email generated from our products and services to report suspected spam. Suspected abuse can be reported by email abuse@hostinger.com.\n\nLiquidated Damages. You agree that we may immediately terminate any Account which we believe, in our sole and absolute discretion, is transmitting or is otherwise connected with any spam or other unsolicited bulk email.\n\n11.

If you have purchased or obtained Services for a period of months or years, changes or modifications in prices and fees shall be effective when the Services in question come up for renewal as further described below. Except as prohibited in any product-specific agreement, you may pay for Services by utilizing any of the following âPayment Methodsâ: (i) by providing a valid credit card, (ii) by using PayPal (as defined below), or (iii) via in-store credit balances, if applicable (and as defined below), each a âPayment Methodâ. For Services that offer âExpress Checkoutâ, clicking the Express Checkout button will automatically place an order for that Service and charge the primary Payment Method on file for your Account. Confirmation of that order will be sent to the email address on file for your Account. Your Payment Method on file must be kept valid if you have any active Services in your Account. You acknowledge and agree that where refunds are issued to your Payment Method, Hostinger's issuance of a refund receipt is only confirmation that Hostinger has submitted your refund to the Payment Method charged at the time of the original sale, and that Hostinger has absolutely no control over when the refund will be applied towards your Payment Methodâs available balance. You further acknowledge and agree that the payment provider and/or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method establish and regulate the time frames for posting your refund, and that such refund posting time frames may range from five (5) business days to a full billing cycle, or longer. In the event a refund is issued to your Payment Method and the payment provider, payment processor or individual issuing bank associated with your Payment Method imposes any limitations on refunds, including but not limited to, limitations as to the timing of the refund or the number of refunds allowed, then Hostinger, in its sole and absolute discretion, reserves the right to issue the refund in the form of an in-store credit. Hostinger also has the right, but not the obligation, to offer an in-store credit for customers seeking refunds, even if there are no limitations on refunds imposed by the Payment Method. For the avoidance of doubt, any and all refunds processed via the issuance of in-store creditsare solely within Hostingerâs discretion and are not available at customer request. In order to ensure that you do not experience an interruption or loss of Services, most Services offer an automatic renewal option. The automatic renewal option automatically renews the applicable Service for a renewal period equal in time to the most recent service period, except for domain names which will renew for the original service period. For example, for products other than domains, if your last service period is for one year, your renewal period will be for one year. We have the right, but not an obligation, to inform you via email about the upcoming automatic renewal date (e.g. we will not send notifications for clients having 1 month plans). While the details of the automatic renewal option vary from Service to Service, the Services that offer an automatic renewal option treat it as the default setting. Therefore, unless you disable the automatic renewal option, Hostinger will automatically renew the applicable Service when it comes up for renewal and will take payment from the Payment Method you have on file with Hostinger at Hostingerâs then current rates, which you acknowledge and agree may be higher or lower than the rates for the original service period. In order to see the renewal settings applicable to you and your Services, simply log into your members area and find the respective account. You may enable or disable the automatic renewal option at any time. However, should you elect to disable the automatic renewal option and fail to manually renew your Services before they expire, you may experience an interruption or loss of Services, and Hostinger shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. In addition, Hostinger may participate in ârecurring billing programsâ or âaccount updater servicesâ supported by your credit card provider (and ultimately dependent on your bankâs participation). If you are enrolled in an automatic renewal option and we are unable to successfully charge your existing Payment Method, your credit card provider (or your bank) may notify us of updates to your credit card number and/or expiration date, or they may automatically charge your new credit card on our behalf without notification to us. In accordance with recurring billing program requirements, in the event that we are notified of an update to your credit card number and/or expiration date, Hostinger will automatically update your payment profile on your behalf. Hostinger makes no guarantees that we will request or receive updated credit card information. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to modify and maintain your Account settings, including but not limited to (i) setting your renewal options and (ii) ensuring your associated Payment Method(s) are current and valid. Further, you acknowledge and agree that your failure to do so, may result in the interruption or loss of Services, and Hostinger shall not be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for any reason Hostinger is unable to charge your Payment Method for the full amount owed for the Services provided, or if Hostinger receives notification of a chargeback, reversal, payment dispute, or is charged a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, you agree that Hostinger may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment, including but not limited to, immediate cancellation, without notice to you, of any domain names or Services registered or renewed on your behalf. Hostinger also reserves the right to charge you reasonable âadministrative feesâ or âprocessing feesâ for (i) tasks Hostinger may perform outside the normal scope of its Services, (ii) additional time and/or costs Hostinger may incur in providing its Services, and/or (iii) your noncompliance with this Agreement (as determined by Hostinger in its sole and absolute discretion). Typical administrative or processing fee scenarios include, but are not limited to (i) customer service issues that require additional personal time or attention; (ii) UDRP actions(s) in connection with your domain name(s) and/or disputes that require accounting or legal services, whether performed by Hostinger staff or by outside firms retained by Hostinger; (iii) recouping any and all costs and fees, including the cost of Services, incurred by Hostinger as the results of chargebacks or other payment disputes brought by you, your bank or Payment Method processor. These administrative fees or processing fees will be billed to the Payment Method you have on file with Hostinger. Hostinger may offer product-level pricing in various currencies; however, transaction processing is supported only in U.S. dollars and a select number of the currency options displayed on this Site (\"Supported Currency\" or âSupported Currenciesâ). If the currency selected is a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in the Supported Currency and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be the actual amount processed and submitted to your bank for payment. If the currency selected is not a Supported Currency, then the transaction will be processed in U.S. dollars and the pricing displayed during the checkout process will be an estimated conversion price at the time of purchase. In either case (whether the currency selected is a Supported Currency or not), if the transaction is processed in a currency that differs from the currency of your bank account, you may be charged exchange rate conversion fees by your bank. In addition, due to time differences between (i) the time you complete the checkout process, (ii) the time the transaction is processed, and (iii) the time the transaction posts to your bank statement, the conversion rates may fluctuate, and Hostinger makes no representations or warranties that (a) the amount submitted to your bank for payment will be the same as the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a Supported Currency) or (b) the estimated conversion price will be the same as either the amount processed or the amount posted to your bank statement (in the case of a non-Supported Currency), and you agree to waive any and all claims based upon such discrepancies (including any and all claims for a refund based on the foregoing). In addition, regardless of the selected currency, you acknowledge and agree that you may be charged Value Added Tax (\"VAT\"), Goods and Services Tax (\"GST\"), or other localized fees and/or taxes, based on your bank and/or the country indicated in your billing address section.\n\nRefund Policy: Products and Services available for refunds are described here (âRefund Policyâ). For products and services eligible for a refund, you may request a full refund within thirty (30) days of purchase (âRefund Periodâ). In the event you purchase a product that includes a free domain name, if you cancel the product, the list price for the domain name will be deducted from the refund amount. The list price is the price of the domain name listed on Hostingerâs website and is not subject to any promotion, discount, or other reduction in price.\n\nIn no event will you be eligible for more than one refund of the same product.\n\n(B) PAY BY PAYPAL\n\nBy using Hostingerâs pay by PayPal payment option (âPayPalâ), you can purchase Services using PayPal. In connection therewith, you agree to allow PayPal to debit the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal account (âPayPal Accountâ) or from credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your PayPal Account (âPayPal Funding Sourceâ).\n\nIt is your responsibility to keep your PayPal Account and PayPal Funding Source current and funded, and your PayPal Account backed by a valid credit card. You acknowledge and agree that (i) PayPal reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither PayPal nor Hostinger shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. If for any reason PayPal is unable to withdraw the full amount owed for your purchase, you agree that PayPal and Hostinger may pursue all available lawful remedies in order to obtain payment. You agree that if the transaction is returned unpaid, you will pay a service charge of $25.00 or the maximum amount allowed by law, which may be debited from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.\n\nBy clicking the box labeled âI agreeâ to the terms of the PayPal payment option, you authorize a debit of the full amount of your purchase from your PayPal Account or PayPal Funding Source.\n\n(C) INTERNATIONAL PAYMENT OPTIONS\n\nHostinger offers a variety of alternative international payment options through a variety of International Payment Providers (âIPPâ). In the event you select an IPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the IPPâs applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at Hostinger. You also agree to allow the IPP to debit the full amount of your purchase from the selected bank account, e-wallet account (including credit card(s), bank account(s), or other allowed payment method(s) linked to your e-wallet account) or any other type of account associated with the selected IPP (including but not limited to, prepaid cards and mobile payments), collectively âFunding Sourcesâ. In addition, you agree to allow the selected IPP to debit, if applicable, an âExchange Rate Conversion Feeâ, as well as any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the IPP (collectively, the âIPP Feesâ), from your Funding Sources. You understand and agree that IPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the IPP without notice to you by Hostinger.\n\nIt is your responsibility to keep your Funding Sources current and funded. You acknowledge and agree that (i) the IPP reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through as a result of your Funding Sources no longer existing or not holding available/sufficient funds) and (ii) in such event, neither the IPP nor Hostinger shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You acknowledge that Hostinger will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until Hostinger receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the IPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor. If Hostinger does not receive confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again. In the event that you would like to cancel payment for a pending transaction, you may cancel the order through your Hostinger account. Payments received on previously cancelled orders will be automatically refunded to the original Payment Method when possible.\n\nIf, at the time Hostinger receives confirmation of payment from the IPP (through its associated payment processor), either (i) the Services (including domain names) are no longer available for purchase; or (ii) a pending order has been cancelled in our systems; or (iii) the confirmation of payment does not match the dollar amount of the pending order, and as a result your purchase is either over-funded or under-funded, Hostinger may automatically issue a partial refund (in the case of over-funding) or a full refund (in the case of under-funding) to your Funding Source. If the IPP (or its associated payment processor) imposes refund limitations of any kind, Hostinger reserves the right to issue refunds to an in-store credit balance. If you receive a full refund, you will need to begin the purchase process again. You acknowledge and agree that the IPP reserves the right not to refund IPP Fees associated with a refunded transaction. Accordingly, any refunds issued by Hostinger will be net of the IPP Fees unless otherwise specified.\n\n(D) IN-STORE CREDIT BALANCES\n\nIn the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you may apply any available credit balance to any future purchase in your Account. In the event that your Account contains an in-store credit balance, you hereby authorize Hostinger to apply any available credit balance to any outstanding administrative fees, chargebacks or other fees related to your Account. In the event that your default Payment Method fails for an automated billing in connection with the processing of any Service renewals, Hostinger may utilize any available in-store credit balance if there are enough funds to cover the entire transaction. Regardless of the amount of in-store credit available in your account, Hostinger is not responsible for the loss of products resulting from an inability to collect funds from your default Payment Methods or the in-store credit. In-store credits will be applied based on the currency selected in the shopping cart at the time of purchase (or renewal). If you have more than one in-store credit, then the credits will be processed according to the age of the credit, with the oldest in-store credit being applied first. If additional funds are required to complete the purchase or renewal, credits held in a non-selected currency will be converted using Hostingerâs daily exchange rate based on the age of the credit (oldest to newest) until (i) enough funds are allocated to complete the transaction, or (ii) there is no available balance left in your account. You understand and agree that at the time of conversion, Hostinger may also impose an additional administrative fee to compensate for the risks and costs associated with providing currency conversion services.\n\nYou can verify your available in-store credit balance at any time by logging into âManage Your Accountâ or through the shopping cart on the Hostinger website. You acknowledge that in-store credit balances are non-transferrable, may only be used in the Account in which they were acquired and may expire. Complimentary in-store credits will expire two years after issuance. In the event that Hostinger terminates your Account, you acknowledge and agree that any remaining available in-store credit balance will be forfeited.\n\nYou also acknowledge that funds available in your in-store credit balance will be held by Hostinger and will not accrue or pay interest for your behalf. To the extent any interest may accrue, you understand and agree that Hostinger shall be entitled to receive and keep any such amounts to cover costs associated with supporting the in-store credit balance functionality.\n\n(E) Cryptocurrencies, tokens and digital assets\n\nUnless stated otherwise, following words refer to blockchain-based software ledger data entries: \"digital asset\", \"asset\", \"coin\", \"cryptocurrency\", \"ledger entry\", \"altcoin\" and \"token\".\n\nHostinger offers a variety of cryptocurrencies, tokens and digital assets payment options through a Cryptocurrency Payment Provider (âCPPâ). In the event you select a CPP, you represent that you have already agreed to any and all of the CPPâs applicable customer service agreements in advance of completing your transaction at Hostinger. If applicable, an âExchange Rate Conversion Feeâ, as well as \"Transaction Fee\" and any other fees or charges applicable to your agreement with the CPP (collectively, the âCPP Feesâ), from your Funding Sources. You understand and agree that CPP Fees are subject to change at any time by the CPP without notice to you by Hostinger.\n\nYou acknowledge and agree that (i) the CPP reserves the right to decline a transaction for any reason (including, but not limited to, payments that fail to go through. In such event, neither the CPP nor Hostinger shall be liable to you or any third party regarding the same. You acknowledge that Hostinger will not attempt to fulfill the Services purchased by you until Hostinger receives confirmation of payment from the IPP through its associated payment processor. You acknowledge there may be a gap of several hours or days between the time you place an order and the time the CPP confirms payment through its associated payment processor. If Hostinger does not receive confirmation of payment from the CPP through its associated payment processor within thirty (30) days from when the order is placed, your order may be cancelled, at which time you will need to commence the purchase process again.\n\n19.
