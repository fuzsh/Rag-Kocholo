        "text": "HCM City supports 100% of health insurance cost for close-poverty people\n\nThe residual fund balance of state-owned HCMC Social Insurance will be used to support the poor and those in close to poverty line, said the insurance company during a meeting on how to use the abundant fund of the insurance company for the poor.\n\nThe meeting was presided over by Deputy Chairwoman of Ho Chi Minh City People’s Committee Nguyen Thi Thu and representatives from departments of Labor, Invalids and Social Affair, Health, Finance after Sai Gon Giai Phong Newspaper published an article entitled: “Insurance fund balance is residual while poor people have no insurance card”.\n\nDirector of the Ho Chi Minh City Social Insurance Agency Cao Van Sang said the surplus in insurance fund in 2015 was VND1,141 billion (US$51 million). As per the regulation of allocation and using the fund, the city is allowed to use 20 percent of the fund balance of the insurance company or VND228 billion (US$10,225,128).\n\nThe Department of Labor, Invalids and Social Affairs said that until now, there are 80,000 poor and close to poverty line households without insurance cards which is worth VND653,400 /card per year. Those people just pay 30 percent or VND196,000 and the Governmental support 70 percent on buying health insurance.\n\nIf the city People's Committee decides to pay 30 percent of health insurance cost that the poor must pay it needs VND3.9 billion (US$174,903) in next three months and more than VND 30 billion in next year.\n\nMs. Nguyen Thi Thu gave the green light to buy health insurance for all poor people and the city will use the residdual fund balance of the state-owned insurance company and the healthcare fund for the poor managed by the Department of Health to support the poor in next years.\n\nLam Dong Province reports first death from dengue\n\nDirector of the Department of Preventive Medicine in the Highlands province of Lam Dong Dr. Nguyen Huu Phuc yesterday confirmed the first death from dengue fever.\n\n9 month old toddler in Loc Son Commune in Bao Loc Town suffered the high fever, hence, he was taken to a private clinic of a local doctor. He was diagnosed to have fever due to virus and injected a drug.\n\nThen the doctor told his parents to take him home and keep an eye on his condition. However, he still had fever after five days; hence, he was rushed to the province’s General Hospital yet he could not survive.\n\nThe province’s Department of Preventive Medicine said that the province has reported 1,286 cases of dengue infection from the beginning of September, a rise of nearly 400 cases compared to last month. Districts with high figure of infection cases include Bao Loc Town, districts Di Linh, Bao Lam, Duc Trong, and Lam Ha.\n\nMekong Delta to face more serious drought, salination\n\nExperts have claimed the Mekong Delta will suffer from fiercer drought and saline intrusion this year, as water levels of the region’s rivers are now much lower than normal, due to the late flooding season.\n\nAccording to Dr. Luong Quang Xo, deputy head of the Southern Irrigation Planning Institute, August is usually the flooding season when the rivers are provided with more water, however this year people are still waiting. The water often helps prevent saltwater intrusion, supply alluvial soil and helps clean the land. People can also go fishing for additional money.\n\nHydropower plant construction has reduced up to 60% of upstream alluvial soil, which has resulted in the smaller floods, leading to more serious drought and saline intrusion.\n\nSo far this year, drought and increased salinity have affected the entire Mekong Delta region, damaging around 160,000 ha of rice with a total estimated productivity of 800,000 tonnes.\n\nDr. Xo said that to help deal with the problem, localities in the region need to increase links in using water resources to control saline intrusion. In reality, currently, there has no a planning management board to connect the Tien and Hau rivers for water regulation.\n\nMany experts suggested that re-zoning farming areas, ensuring water supply for crops and cattle, researching and developing crops with high salt tolerance, and other methods should be used for the Mekong Delta region to cope with the harsh climate.\n\nRussian Literature Corner opens at Hanoi Library\n\nA reading corner for Russian literature lovers was inaugurated at the Hanoi Library on September 6 as part of the ongoing “Russian Literature Days in Hanoi” programme.\n\nThe corner introduces the Vietnamese editions of over 50 Russian children’s stories and novels, many of them popular with Vietnamese of all ages.\n\nProminent among the literary works include The Adventures of Dunno and His Friends by Nikolai Nosov, Gena the Crocodile and His Friends by Eduard Uspensky, Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy, The Gambler by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, and The Master and Margarita by Mikhail Bulgakov.\n\nThe books were published as part of a project on translating literature from Russian into Vietnamese and vice versa, which has been jointly carried out since 2012 by the Vietnam–Russia Literature Fund, Vietnam’s The Gioi (World) Publishers, the Literature Publishing House of Vietnam and Russia’s Lokid Premium Publishing House.\n\nThe opening of the reading space aims to promote Russian literature among Vietnamese readers while creating a venue for Vietnamese to share their love for the Russian language and Russian literature.\n\nThe “Russian Literature Days in Hanoi” programme is jointly held by the Russian Centre of Science and Culture, the Hanoi Library, Kim Dong and Nha Nam Publishing Houses, Nha Nam Culture and Communications Company and Alpha Book Company.\n\nThe two-day event attracted a large number of students from high schools in Hanoi, which has a Russian language faculty. The students had the opportunity to hold talks with Russian translators and learn more about famous Russian literary works.\n\nDeputy PM urges stricter enforcement of traffic regulations\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Trưong Hòa Bình has asked localities and agencies to strictly enforce traffic regulations, particularly government Decree 46, to cut down on traffic accidents.\n\nBình made the request at a meeting to review traffic safety in the first eight months of this year, held by the National Traffic Safety Committee (NTSC) yesterday.\n\nViệt Nam recorded 13,612 traffic accidents, 5,728 deaths and 11,781 injuries in the first eight months of this year, according to Khuất Việt Hùng, deputy chief of NTSC.\n\nCompared to 2015, the figures have fallen by 6.9 per cent, 1.6 per cent and 18.5 per cent, respectively.\n\nDrinking while driving was the main cause of traffic accidents and authorised agencies failed to check whether the drivers were under the influence of alcohol, the NTSC said\n\nIn August, 1,760 traffic accidents occurred nationwide, leaving 705 dead and 1,495 injured, a year-on-year increase of 7.8 per cent in the number of deaths.\n\nParticipants at the meeting blamed the rise in traffic accidents in August on loose management of transport services, transport infrastructure and mainland and waterway transport.\n\nThey also pointed to a lack of responsibility from officials and staff in transport management, calling it a major reason the situation had worsened.\n\nTrần Kỳ Hình, head of the Việt Nam Register, said alcohol was the main reason for about 40 per cent of traffic accidents.\n\nUnder Decree 46/2016/NĐ-CP, which took effect from August, penalties for more than 100 traffic violations were stiffened.\n\nDrivers with alcohol levels exceeding 80mg per 100ml of blood or 0.4 mg per liter of breath will be fined VND16-18 million (US$720-810), instead of VND10-15 million as before. Drivers who run yellow traffic lights will receive a fine similar to the fine for running red lights.\n\nStatistics from the NTSC showed traffic police dealt with 137,100 traffic violations, withdrew more than 8,000 driving licences and seized nearly 15,7000 vehicles in the first month since the implementation of Decree 46. Total fines were estimated at VNĐ76 billion (US$3.4 million).\n\nWhile recognising efforts made by ministries and departments to reduce traffic accidents, the deputy PM said the traffic situation in Việt Nam is still “complicated” and many violations such as modifying trucks to increase their capacity or overloading vehicles were still not penalized.\n\nBình ordered agencies and local authorities to strictly implement Decree 46 and continue its dissemination to raise people’s awareness of traffic regulations.\n\nBình asked the Ministry of Transport to set forth traffic safety projects and revise related legal documents.\n\nThe ministry was urged to tighten the management of transport services and vehicle capacity.\n\nHe emphasised the need to connect waterway transport and railway transport to reduce the burden on roads.\n\nHe also ordered the Ministry of Public Security to instruct local units to intensify dissemination to raise road safety awareness and strictly deal with violations like speeding, overloading and drink driving.\n\nAlcohol – major cause of traffic accidents\n\nAs many as 10,000 cases violating alcohol concentration regulations while driving were handled nationwide in August this year, mostly in Hanoi, Da Nang, Can Tho and Ho Chi Minh City, according to a senior police officer.\n\nAlthough there were only 17 traffic accidents involving drunk drivers, alcohol is a major reason behind serious accidents, said Major General Tran Son Ha, head of the Traffic Police Department, during a meeting of the National Traffic Safety Committee in Hanoi on September 7.\n\nTran Ky Hinh, head of the Vietnam Department of Register of Shipping, alcohol was the cause of 40 percent of traffic accidents, but in fact, the rate is higher as alcohol leads to many violations of traffic safety rules.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Chairman of the National Traffic Safety Committee Khuat Viet Hung reported that 1,760 traffic accidents happened across the country in August this year, killing 705 people and injuring nearly 1,500 others. Compared to the same time in 2015, the cases dropped 2.8 percent, but the deaths increased 7.8 percent.\n\nIn the eight-month period, traffic accidents nationwide saw a year-on-year decline in the numbers of cases, deaths and injured, with 13,612 accidents, claiming 5,728 lives and wounding 11,781 others.\n\nLast month, traffic police handled 137,100 violations, fining nearly 76 billion VND, withdrawing over 8,000 driving licences and seizing nearly 700 automobiles and 15,000 motor bikes.\n\nAddressing the meeting, Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh, who is head of the National Traffic Safety Committee, said that despite a year-on-year drop in the numbers of accidents, deaths and injured in the first eight months of this year, traffic safety situation remains complicated. Many overload vehicles have yet been detected, while corruption has still been seen in handling violations, he noted.\n\nHe asked ministries, sectors and localities to strengthen law enforcement, while strictly implementing Decree 46/ND-CP on administrative punishments for road and railway traffic violations.\n\nHe highlighted the need to develop aviation infrastructure and ensure flight safety amidst the increase of airplanes.\n\nThe Deputy PM directed the Ministry of Transport to continue speeding up the building of legal documents, closely managing the transportation business, and seeking ways to ease road overloads.\n\nTraffic police in localities should increase breath-testing on drivers to detect violations, he added.-\n\nHospital Management Asia conference held in HCM City\n\nThe 15th Hospital Management Asia (HMA) conference was opened in Ho Chi Minh City on September 7 with the participation of some 1,000 delegates from 400 hospitals and organisations in 35 countries.\n\nDuring the two-day event, 104 speakers from 22 countries will share experience at 75 sessions.\n\nThey focus on hospitals’ social responsibility, human resources development, improving service quality for internal customers, marketing and public relations, patient safety, improving clinical service quality, customer services, technical infrastructure and medical equipment improvement, hospital governance reforms, and IT application in health care.\n\nFifty-three collective awards will be presented to the best among 322 quality improvement initiatives. Meanwhile, Vi Nguyet Ho, who founded the Vietnam Nurses Association, will be honoured with the devotion award for her life-long contributions to the nursing in the country.\n\nSpeaking at the conference, Minister of Health Nguyen Thi Kim Tien said the Vietnamese Government prioritises social welfare programmes and considers promoting health care a prerequisite for the country’s socio-economic development.\n\nHer ministry has strived to ensure fair, effective and quality health care over the past years. There are 1,300 hospitals with 250,000 patient beds in Vietnam at present. They serve over 150 million outpatients and 15 million inpatients while conducting 3 million surgeries every year.\n\nTien admitted challenges facing the local health care sector and expressed the willingness to learn from other countries’ experience.\n\nThe HMA conference is held by the Asian Hospital Federation with a view to sharing experience in hospital management and service improvement among regional and global nations.\n\nVietnam hosted the HMA conference in HCM City in 2009 and Hanoi in 2012.\n\nHydrocephalus, a brain condition that can cause loss of mental and physical ability if left untreated, has not prevented a 10-year-old boy from playing football at a field in HCM City’s Bình Thạnh District.\n\nThe boy’s persistence can be attributed to the enthusiastic care and treatment from social workers who work at the shelter where the boy has lived since he was a baby.\n\nHe is one of more than 51,100 disadvantaged children benefiting from the city’s project on social work development for the 2011-2015 period.\n\nSpeaking at a conference this week reviewing the project, Lê Chu Giang, head of the Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs’ social welfare division, said social work services were offered at shelters, social welfare centres, hospitals and schools.\n\nThe city is designated as a “special urban area” by the government, with a large number of people receiving social welfare.\n\nAt least 453,990 people aged 60 and over receive welfare, along with 49,690 people with disabilities and 51,152 disadvantaged children.\n\nSocial workers and social welfare centres in the city play an important role in providing assistance to ensure that recipients receive their welfare benefits.\n\nThey are also responsible for giving advice in several areas, such as poverty reduction, compulsory high school education, vocational training for rural labour, child care and protection, and assistance for people who leave rehabilitation centres and re-enter society.\n\nThe city has nearly 5,000 social workers, but many of them have not been trained professionally.\n\nDespite the high number, there are still not enough to meet demand. At least 90 public and private social welfare establishments and rehabilitation centres operate in the city.\n\nTo improve services, the city People’s Committee has approved allocation of VNĐ28.4 billion (US$12.6 million) to improve social work training and services from now to 2020, according to the city’s Department of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs.\n\nDuring this period, the city will continue to offer professional training to social workers employed in wards, communes and towns.\n\nIt also plans to open a centre for social welfare services in each district, according to Lê Chu Giang, head of the department’s Social Welfare Division. The first centre will be built in District 12 this year.\n\nThe city has set the goal of having at least one or two freelancers working as social workers in each ward, commune or town under the Ministry of Labour, Invalids, and Social Affairs’ regulation.\n\nSocial work activities at hospitals and schools will also be given more attention.\n\nHospital, school-based social work\n\nBy 2020, each hospital in the city is expected to have a division or team in charge of social work.\n\nLast year, 16 hospitals had such a centre. Social workers work with health officials to provide psychological and social assistance to patients. More than 34,950 patients received assistance last year.\n\nThese divisions were able to raise patient satisfaction from 90 per cent in 2010 to 98 per cent last year.\n\nSocial workers also work with enterprises, individuals and organisations to provide free meals and funds for treatment and other services.\n\nHCM City is a leader in the school-counselling field, but a shortage of staff specialists and facilities is preventing schools from offering professional career and psychological counselling to students.\n\nSpeaking at a recent conference on school counselling in HCM City, Dr Nguyễn Thị Hoài Hương of the HCM City Institute for Development Studies said only 120 staff work as specialists in school counselling.\n\nHowever, the Department of Education and Training requires one staff specialist at each school. The specialist must be a university graduate in psychology.\n\nThe figure is higher than the 29 staff counsellors employed at schools in 2011.\n\nOf 938 schools in the city, 891 offer counselling services, but most of the services are provided by teachers and staff in charge of the Communist Youth Union, or general supervisors.\n\nHương said that school leaders should work with oragnisations to open training courses for staff who have not been trained in counselling or psychology.\n\nOnly 71 of the schools in the city have a room dedicated to counselling services.\n\nHương said that counselling services primarily focused on preventing violence and reducing stress, or on sex education and advice about occupational orientation.\n\nTrần Anh Tuấn, deputy director for the Centre for Human Resource Forecasting and Labour Information, said that occupational orientation advice had helped “students reduce psychological pressure to study at university after high school”.\n\nStudents have been advised to pursue colleges or vocational schools if they do not want to pursue a university education.\n\nThanks to counselling about jobs, many students have chosen a career needed by society and not one preferred by their parents.\n\nNguyễn Thị Thanh Hường, who is in charge of counselling services at Bình Hưng Hòa High School in Bình Tân District, said that teachers and managers should be more aware of the importance of counselling services and ask for their help when needed.\n\nVũ Thị Ngọc Bích of Thủ Dầu Một University in Bình Dương Province said that staff specialists providing career and psychology services were vital for educational development.\n\nThe conference was held by the HCM City Institute for Development Studies in co-operation with the Department of Education and Training and University of Social Sciences and Humanities.\n\nVietnam strives to protect plant breeders’ rights\n\nMore than 300 plant variety protection certificates have been granted to plant breeders in Vietnam during the ten-year implementation of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV) Convention, heard a workshop in Hanoi on September 7.\n\nAccording to Deputy Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Le Quoc Doanh, many good plant varieties created by Vietnamese have been cultivated, contributing to turning Vietnam into one of the world’s big agro-forestry-fishery exporters.\n\nA plant variety protection system was set up in Vietnam in 2000, he said, adding that the country joined in the UPOV Convention six years later in an effort to protect plant varieties more effectively through cooperation with UPOV member countries.\n\nThe Deputy Minister noted that the Vietnamese Government has decided to adjust plant variety protection-related contents of the Law on Intellectual Property to make them suitable with the new situation.\n\nTran Dinh Long, Chairman of the Vietnam Variety Plant Association, said that variety copyright remains a challenge in plant variety development in Vietnam.\n\nThe copyright will encourage scientists to create better varieties of plants and help Vietnam build its own brand name, he said.\n\nUPOV Deputy Secretary General Peter Button said apart from guidance and legal assistance provided by the UPOV, it is necessary to garner experience of UPOV member countries to facilitate the effectuation of relevant laws.\n\nThe two-day seminar was jointly held by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, the UPOV, the US Patent and Trademark Office, and the Ministry of Agriculture , Forestry and Fisheries of Japan.\n\nInt’l conference discusses power loss mitigation\n\nAn international conference seeking to mitigate power loss in transmission and distribution systems is taking place in Hanoi on September 7-8, attracting speakers from Japan, India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.\n\nDeputy Director General of the Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) Ngo Son Hai informed the conference that power loss dropped from 10.15 percent in 2010 to 7.94 percent in 2015 when 160 billion kWh of electricity was produced.\n\nBy 2020, EVN strives to reduce power loss to 6.5 percent.\n\nTran Dinh Long, Vice Chairman of the Vietnam Electrical Engineering Association, said EVN has come up with plans to strengthen its power grid, use energy-saving conductor wires and transformers, among others, in order to mitigate power loss in the coming years.\n\nA representative from the Provincial Electricity Authority of Thailand said PEA reconfigures electrical system, regularly checks electricity meters, especially in households showing abnormal consumption, for the effort.\n\nMeanwhile, the Japanese Electrical Wire and Cable Makers’ Association shared its experience that Japan has used appropriate cable cross-sections that help reduce Co2 emission and save energy.\n\nThe conference was co-hosted by the EVN and the Vietnam Energy Association.-\n\nRoK helps Can Tho mechanise agriculture\n\nThe Republic of Korea (RoK) will provide a non-refundable aid of 99.5 billion VND (4.5 million USD) for a project to help the Mekong Delta city of Can Tho mechanise its agriculture.\n\nVice Chairman of the municipal People’s Committee Truong Quang Hoa Nam on September 7 hosted a meeting to discuss plans to speed up the project, which has a total estimated investment of more than 115 billion VND (5.2 million USD).\n\nThe project aims to boost the farming mechanisation in Can Tho and the Mekong Delta region in general, thus increasing productivity and incomes, and reducing losses.\n\nIt is expected to begin in 2017 with the RoK side providing agricultural machines and maintenance services, transferring technologies of developing agricultural tools and training agricultural mechanics.\n\nVice Chairman Nam assigned the city’s management board of ODA projects to work with relevant departments and sectors to complete necessary procedures for the project to be approved and implemented on schedule.\n\nThe Mekong Delta boasts the highest rate of agricultural mechanisation in the country, with land preparation reaching 90 percent and harvesting 80 percent. However, the rate is still low in sowing seeds, planting seedlings, removing weeds and spraying pesticides.\n\nAccording to estimates from experts from the National Agricultural Promotion Centre, mechnisation can cut production costs by up to 2.5 million VND (112 USD) per hectare per crop.\n\nHà Nội moon cakes violate food regulations\n\nHà Nội Market Watch yesterday found a moon cake shop violating food labeling regulations.\n\nAnh Hòa Moon Cake Shop on Hà Nội’s 87 Láng Hạ Street used note stickers with the manufacturing and expiry dates on its cake products handwritten, making it easy to replace.\n\nMoreover, the dates written on the note stickers were unclear. A handwritten September 6 date on the cakes could cause misunderstanding for the customers as it did not specify whether it was the manufacturing or expiry date.\n\nThe inspectors have seized 118 moon cakes from the shop and ordered the shop owner to recall the products sold at the market.\n\nThe shop will be under strict inspection until it follows the required labeling regulations.\n\nNguyễn Thanh Phong, head of the Ministry of Health’s Food Safety and Hygiene, said moon cakes sold at the market should be inspected for quality and must possess licensed food safety certificates. Products without certificates would be recalled and enterprises would be fined.\n\nHe added that homemade moon cakes, the favourite of many customers in recent years, were not under mandatory inspection, and therefore, might pose risks for customers.\n\nHanoi welcomes over 207,000 visitors during National Day holiday\n\nHanoi’s tourism sector welcomed over 207,000 visitors during the National Day holiday from September 2-6, a year-on-year rise of 22%, according to the Hanoi Department of Tourism.\n\nThe city received more than 22,000 foreign holiday-makers, a rise of 11% against 2015, and 185,000 domestic vacationers, up 23%. Total tourism revenues were estimated at over VND526 billion.\n\nIn order to further develop its tourism industry, Hanoi has recently begun focussing on promoting its more popular sites and improving the quality of tourism products and events in the city.\n\nTo mark the holiday this year, Hanoi has launched pedestrian streets around Hoan Kiem Lake.\n\nSome streets, such as Dinh Tien Hoang and Hang Khay, will be completely closed to motor vehicles, while on some others, such as Trang Tien and Hang Bai, only the sections adjacent to Hoan Kiem Lake will be shut down.\n\nPolice officers were deployed to direct traffic from afar while the transport department will also open new spaces to park vehicles near the pedestrian area.\n\nThe new regulation is effective from 7pm on Fridays to midnight Sundays.\n\nIn another move to boost tourism, the capital city will provide free Wi-Fi access to the Hoan Kiem Lake area, where tourists will be able to enjoy the service for up to 30 minutes after entering their phone numbers. Wi-Fi broadcasting stations will be installed at 21 sites around the lake.\n\nAutumn book fair to highlight digital books\n\nOnline books will be the highlight of the Autumn Book Fair scheduled to take place at Thong Nhat Park from September 9-13.\n\nThe online book area will introduce the most recent online book editions and an online trading forum of publishing houses and distribution units.
