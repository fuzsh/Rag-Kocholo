        "text": "One of the most eclectic artists of the mid-twentieth century, Nina Simone blended soul, jazz, and pop with romance and biting social commentary. Presented by rock and soul historian and author Richie Unterberger, this event will feature rare film clips from her 1960’s prime with a selection of performances of her greatest songs, including “Four Women,” “Mississippi Goddamn,” “I Put a Spell on You,” and “Don’t Let Me Be Misunderstood.”\n\nAuthor and rock historian Richie Unterberger is the author of numerous rock history books, including volumes on the Beatles, the Who, the Velvet Underground, Bob Marley, and 1960s folk-rock. He teaches courses on rock and soul music history at several Bay Area colleges. His latest book, San Francisco: Portrait of a City, was published by Taschen in 2022."
