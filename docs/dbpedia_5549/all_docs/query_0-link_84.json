        "text": "Phrases like the ‘king of rock ‘n’ roll’ and ‘prince of pop’ have been bandied around by music hacks for decades now but when we introduce revered DJ, producer and musician Osunlade as ‘deep house priest’ we really mean it.\n\nOf course, there’s a lot more to Osunlade than simply deep house. Osunlade’s ordination as priest of shamanic African religion Ifa at the tail-end of the 1990s quickly inspired a broad spectrum of spiritual club and urban sounds – covering everything from soul and R&B to hip-hop and deep polyrhythmic dance.\n\nOsunlade had been working in LA at the heart of a furiously money-driven, totally ruthless mainstream music business. The experience was wearing him down but, ultimately, lead him to Ifa, where he would find in his own words, spiritual strength and creative freedom. In 1999 Osunlade, now in New York, founded Yoruba Records and got his musical career firmly on track.\n\nThe Yoruba label is named after the West African people, and culture, that, so the history books tell us, gave rise to a system of traditional spiritual and healing practises and, in turn, the Ifa cult. “My religion has more to do with ancestry than just religion. It’s like going back to the roots. It’s connecting with the tradition and ancestors to seek guidance” Osunlade, who often incorporates Yoruba texts and vocals in his work, previously commented. “To me, if I sing in the indigenous tones of my ancestors, there is a voice and spirit in those things. They will hear, giving me strength, guidance and light.”\n\nOsunlade’s clarity of thought and clear studio talent has combined well throughout recent years, driving much of his internationally acclaimed output and ensuring its consistency. Besides Yoruba, Osunlade has released and remixed through institutional clubland imprints such as MAW, Versatile, King Street and Strictly Rhythm. Ardent supporters include everyone from Louie Vega to Ricardo Villalobos.\n\nOsunlade’s first artist album Paradigm arrived in 2001 on Soul Jazz Records, a glorious melting pot of afro and ancestral house sounds which earned both dancefloor fame and critical acclaim. Prior to that, however, there was the beautifully understated collection of afro-dance tracks, El Primer Ano, released on a limited basis by Yoruba in 2000; and before that, a dizzying sweep of musical assignments, collaborations and activities.\n\nOsunlade was born in St Louis in 1969, taking piano lessons as a youngster, as well as regularly attending church choir. At the age of 17 he, perhaps surprisingly given current form, joined popular kids show Sesame Street as a presenter; before moving on to produce the show’s musical content. From the late 80s onwards, Osunlade dedicated himself to working long hours as producer and session hand for everyone from Patti LaBelle and Freddie Jackson to Eric Benet and India.Arie. And then came the Yoruba revelations and, well, huge clubland satisfaction…..\n\nOsunlade’s big follow-up to Paradigm was 2006 opus Aquarian Moon. Released through BBE, the album marked a return to some of his soundtrack-scoring origins and well reflected the mellow ambience of his new studio base – the Greek island of Santorini, where he remains to this day. Aquarian Moon skilfully overlaid infectious house drums and broken jazz-beats with lush string, horn and orchestral arrangements, and further emphasised its author’s wide-ranging tastes and abilities.\n\nA number of albums have followed that - the refreshing, captivating trend for diversity ever present. 2007 saw in album Elements Beyond, a predominantly electronic, non-commercial work hinging on deep dance beats and stirring Middle Eastern influences – Elements represented Strictly Rhythm’s first artist album in over a decade.\n\nThis year, Osunlade gave us Rebirth; another wonderful showcase of his eclectic visions beyond the house dancefloor. Rebirth mixed mellow club-orientated ideas such as Break It Down and The Dating Game with meaningful songs steeped in the finest traditions of jazz, soul and world music – all, impressively, recorded with a funky nine-piece orchestra. Elsewhere, Osunlade has further solidified his reputation with mix compilations for Soul Heaven, King Street (Mix The Vibe: King Street Goes Yoruba,) Strictly Rhythm (this year’s majestic double-disc Strictly Ibiza mix) and Yoruba (also this year, Osunlade mixing classic, ethno-deep house staples from his label for package Yoruba Gold.)\n\nIn the next few weeks, our man will present a comprehensive compilation retrospective of everything pivotal he has done to date, as the next artist in the acclaimed House Masters series. Bearing in mind his illustrious track record, it promises to be something rather special. Further ahead, is the prospect of Osunlade’s new, long-awaited house album Romantique – it promises to be his last house collection, though he insists the one-off productions and remixes will carry on.\n\n“The digital music age is definitely the way now. It’s kind of a sad thing that you have so many labels popping up, it’s like they have new artists, new producers that are not really musicians, producers,” Osunlade told Defected earlier this year. “No one’s really taking the role of quality assurance; anyone can put a record out, or have a label, there’s no overhead, there’s no promotion outside of the digital site. I’ve made a conscious decision to not make another house artist album. It’s time to let the new guys take over.”\n\nBut then here is a highly focussed talent whose music has never totally been one thing or another. Whatever genre he finds himself in, Osunlade entertains. And whatever the state of the music business, Osunlade will always make himself heard - Osunlade’s unique and unblemished approach to music-making will take care of that. Rest assured clubland’s high priest has plenty of sonic sermons still to deliver. Praise be!"
