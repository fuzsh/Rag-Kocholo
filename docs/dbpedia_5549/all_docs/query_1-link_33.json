        "text": "High Priestess of Soul is a 1967 studio album by jazz singer, pianist and songwriter Nina Simone. The songs are accompanied by a large band directed and arranged by Hal Mooney. The album contains pop songs (such as \"Don't You Pay Them No Mind\") and African American gospel and folk related songs written by Simone herself (such as \"Take Me to the Water\" and \"Come Ye\").\n\nAfter this album title –an attempt to broaden her appeal by management execs– Nina Simone was sometimes titled “the high priestess of soul”, although she completely rejected the title herself because it placed a label on her as an artist. However, according to her daughter, Lisa, she never hated that moniker."
