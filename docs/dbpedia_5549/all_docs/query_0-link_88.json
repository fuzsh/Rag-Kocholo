        "text": "Nina Simone\n\nAllmusic Biography : Nina Simone was one of the most gifted vocalists of her generation, and also one of the most eclectic. Simone was a singer, pianist, and songwriter who bent genres to her will rather than allowing herself to be confined by their boundaries; her work swung back and forth between jazz, blues, soul, classical, R&B;, pop, gospel, and world music, with passion, emotional honesty, and a strong grasp of technique as the constants of her musical career.\n\nNina Simone was born Eunice Kathleen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina on February 21, 1933. Her mother, Mary Kate Waymon, was a Methodist minister, and her father, John Divine Waymon, was a handyman who moonlighted as a preacher. Eunice displayed a precocious musical talent at the age of three when she started picking out tunes on the familys piano, and a few years later she was playing piano at her mothers Sunday church services. Mary Kate worked part time as a housemaid, and when her employers heard Eunice play, they arranged for her to study with pianist Muriel Mazzanovich, who tutored Eunice in the classics, focusing on Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, Chopin, and Schubert. After graduating at the top of her high school class, Eunice received a grant to study at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City, and applied for enrollment at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. However, Eunice was denied admission at the Curtis Institute under mysterious circumstances, despite what was said to be a stellar audition performance; she would insist that her race was the key reason she was rejected.\n\nDetermined to support herself as a musician, Eunice applied for a job playing piano at the Midtown Bar & Grill in Atlantic City, New Jersey in 1954. Eunice was told she would have to sing as well as play jazz standards and hits of the day. While she had no experience as a vocalist, Eunice faked it well enough to get the job, and she adopted the stage name Nina Simone -- Nina from a pet name her boyfriend used, and Simone from the French film star Simone Signoret. The newly christened Nina Simone was a quick study as a singer, and her unique mixture of jazz, blues, and the classics soon earned her a loyal audience. Within a few years, Simone was a headliner at nightclubs all along the East Coast, and in 1957 she came to the attention of Syd Nathan, the mercurial owner of the influential blues and country label King Records. Nathan offered Simone a contract with his jazz subsidiary, Bethlehem Records, and the two were soon butting heads as the strong-willed Simone insisted on choosing her own material. Simone won out, and in 1958, she enjoyed a major hit with her interpretation of \"I Loves You Porgy\" from Porgy and Bess. The single rose to the Top 20 of the pop charts, but like many of Nathans signings, Simone did not see eye to eye with him about business details (particularly after she discovered shed signed away her right to royalties upon receiving her advance), and by 1959 she had signed a new deal with Colpix Records.\n\nSimones reputation as a powerful live performer had only grown by this time, and her second album for Colpix was the first of many live recordings she would release, Nina Simone at Town Hall. Simones live performances gave her more room to show off her classical piano influences, and her albums for Colpix reflected an intelligent taste in standards, pop songs, and supper club blues, and while she didnt enjoy another American hit on the level of \"I Loves You Porgy,\" her recordings of \"Trouble in Mind\" and \"Nobody Knows You When Youre Down and Out\" both entered the pop charts as singles. (Simones 7\" releases for Colpix were later compiled into a collection from Rhino Records, 2018s The Colpix Singles.)\n\nIn 1964, Simone left Colpix to sign a new deal with Philips, and the move coincided with a shift in the themes of her music. While always conscious of the ongoing struggle for civil rights, Simone often avoided explicit political messages in her material; as she later wrote, \"How can you take the memory of a man like Medgar Evers and reduce all that he was to three-and-a-half minutes and a simple tune?\" But as the fight for racial equality became a more pressing issue in America, Simone began addressing issues of social justice in her music, penning songs such as \"Mississippi Goddam,\" \"Four Women,\" and \"Young, Gifted and Black,\" the latter inspired by the work of her friend and mentor Lorraine Hansberry. Simone also enjoyed a British hit single in 1964 with \"Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" and while the record didnt fare as well in the United States, a year later the Animals would take the song to the pop charts on both sides of the Atlantic. Simone would next hit the British charts with her cover of Screamin Jay Hawkins \"I Put a Spell on You,\" which also rose to the Top 30 in the States.\n\nIn 1967, after recording seven albums for Philips, Simone struck a new deal with RCA Records, and while her first album for her new label, Nina Simone Sings the Blues, was a straightforward collection of blues standards, her subsequent work for RCA found Simone focusing on contemporary pop, rock, and soul material, much of which dealt with topical themes and progressive philosophies (1969s To Love Somebody featured no fewer than three Bob Dylan tunes). Simones 1968 cover of \"Aint Got No/I Got Life\" (from the musical Hair) was a major chart hit in the U.K., and Simone would focus her energies on her European career when she left the United States in 1970, initially settling in Barbados and divorcing her husband and manager. Simones exile was prompted by her increasing disillusionment with American politics, as well as her refusal to pay income taxes as a protest against U.S. involvement in Vietnam, though recording sessions and concert dates would occasionally bring her back to the United States. In 1974, Simone released her last album for RCA, It Is Finished, and spent the next several years traveling the world and playing occasional concerts; she would not return to the recording studio until 1978, when she recorded the album Baltimore at a studio in Belgium for Creed Taylors CTI label. (That same year, Simone was arrested and charged for her non-payment of taxes from 1971 to 1973.) It would be another four years until Simone would record again, cutting Fodder on My Wings for a Swiss label in 1982.\n\nAfter several more years of travel, Simone released a live album through the American VPI label, 1985s Live & Kickin, and another concert set, Let It Be Me, was issued by Verve in 1987, a year that saw Simone enjoying a major career resurgence in Europe; her 1959 recording of \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" was used in a British television commercial for Chanel No. 5 perfume, and the song subsequently became a hit, rising to the Top Ten of the U.K. pop charts. In 1989, Simone was invited by Pete Townshend to sing the song \"Fast Food\" on his concept album The Iron Man, which also featured John Lee Hooker. Simones autobiography I Put a Spell on You was published in 1990, and after a well-received United States concert tour, she was signed by Elektra Records, which released the album A Single Woman in 1993.\n\nIn 1995, Simone found herself in the news after she fired a gun at one of her neighbors during an argument; she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which was said to be the cause of several episodes of erratic behavior in her later years. Simone continued to perform live in Europe and the United States up until the summer of 2002, when it was discovered she had breast cancer. Simones battle with the disease came to an end on April 21, 2003 in Carry-le-Rouet, France. Only a few days earlier, Simone had received an honorary degree from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, the same school that had rejected her in 1953.

Backed by bassist Jimmy Bond and Albert \"Tootie\" Heath, it showcases her ballad voice as one of mystery and sensuality and showcases her uptempo jazz style with authority and an enigmatic down-home feel that is nonetheless elegant. The album also introduced a fine jazz pianist. Simone was a solid improviser who never strayed far from the blues. Check the opener, her reading of Duke Ellingtons \"Mood Indigo,\" which finger-pops and swings while keeping the phrasing deep-blue. It is contrasted immediately with one of the -- if not the -- definitive reads of Willard Robisons steamy leave-your-lover ballad \"Dont Smoke in Bed.\" The title track, written by Rodgers & Hart, features \"Good King Wenceslas\" as a classical prelude to one of the most beautiful pop ballads ever written. It is followed immediately by the funky swing in \"Love Me or Leave Me\" with a smoking little piano solo in the bridge where Bach meets Horace Silver and Bobby Timmons. Its also interesting to note that while this was her first recording, the records grooves evidence an artist who arrives fully formed; many of the traits Simone displayed throughout her career as not only a vocalist and pianist but as an arranger are put on first notice here. \"My Baby Just Cares for Me\" has a stride shuffle that is extrapolated on in the piano break. Her instrumental and improvising skills are put to good use on Tadd Damerons \"Good Bait,\" which is transformed into something classical from its original bebop intent. \"Youll Never Walk Alone\" feels more like some regal gospel song than the Rodgers & Hammerstein show tune it was. Of course, one of Simones signature tunes was her version of \"I Loves You, Porgy,\" which appears here for the first time and was released as a single. Her own \"Central Park Blues\" is one of the finest jazz tunes here, and it is followed with yet another side of Simones diversity in her beautiful take on the folk-gospel tune \"Hes Got the Whole World in His Hands,\" with quiet and determined dignity and drama. Another of her instrumentals compositions, \"African Mailman,\" struts proud with deep Afro-Caribbean roots and rhythms. Album: 2 of 37\n\nTitle: The Amazing Nina Simone\n\nReleased: 1959\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 34:41\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify TrackSamples Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Blue Prelude (03:22)\n\n2 Children Go Where I Send You (02:52)\n\n3 Tomorrow (We Will Meet Once More) (03:02)\n\n4 Stompinâ at the Savoy (02:11)\n\n5 It Might as Well Be Spring (03:57)\n\n6 Youâve Been Gone Too Long (02:11)\n\n7 Thatâs Him Over There (02:32)\n\n8 Chilly Winds Donât Blow (02:46)\n\n9 Theme From \"Middle of the Night\" (02:30)\n\n10 Canât Get Out of This Mood (02:33)\n\n11 Willow Weep for Me (03:14)\n\n12 Solitaire (03:28)\n\nThe Amazing Nina Simone : Allmusic album Review : There is a remarkable amount of variety on this disc, Nina Simones second recording. Her repertoire ranges from a swinging \"Stompin at the Savoy\" and an emotional \"It Might as Well Be Spring\" to an English folk ballad (\"Tomorrow\"), spirituals, an R&B song (\"Youve Been Gone Too Long\") and the theme song from the movie Middle of the Night. Somehow Simone brings credibility to each of these very different songs. She does not play much piano (just cameos on two songs) and is backed by a subtle orchestra arranged by Bob Mersey that is effective accompanying her vocals. This session finds Nina Simones voice in top form and with a few exceptions is generally jazz-oriented.

(02:05)\n\n12 The Last Rose of Summer (03:07)\n\n13 A Monster (02:42)\n\nBroadway Blues Ballads : Allmusic album Review : Theres a lot more Broadway and a lot more ballads than blues on this, which ranks as one of Simones weaker mid-60s albums. Almost half the record features Broadway tunes on the order of Cole Porter and Rodgers & Hammerstein; most of the rest was composed by Bennie Benjamin, author of her first-rate \"Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" which the Animals covered for a hit shortly afterwards (and which leads off this record). The other Benjamin tunes are modified uptown soul with string arrangements and backup vocals in the vein of \"Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" but arent in the same league, although \"How Can I?\" is an engaging cha-cha. Besides \"Dont Let Me Be Misunderstood,\" the album is most notable for the great \"SeeLine Woman,\" a percolating call-and-response number that ranks as one of her best tracks. Album: 6 of 37\n\nTitle: I Put a Spell on You\n\nReleased: 1965\n\nTracks: 12\n\nDuration: 34:16\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 I Put a Spell on You (02:36)\n\n2 Tomorrow Is My Turn (02:52)\n\n3 Ne me quitte pas (If You Go Away) (03:38)\n\n4 Marriage Is for Old Folks (03:33)\n\n5 July Tree (02:44)\n\n6 Gimme Some (03:02)\n\n7 Feeling Good (02:54)\n\n8 One September Day (02:51)\n\n9 Blues on Purpose (03:20)\n\n10 Beautiful Land (01:57)\n\n11 Youâve Got to Learn (02:44)\n\n12 Take Care of Business (02:05)\n\nI Put a Spell on You : Allmusic album Review : One of her most pop-oriented albums, but also one of her best and most consistent. Most of the songs feature dramatic, swinging large-band orchestration, with the accent on the brass and strings. Simone didnt write any of the material, turning to popular European songsmiths Charles Aznavour, Jacques Brel, and Anthony Newley, as well as her husband, Andy Stroud, and her guitarist, Rudy Stevenson, for bluesier fare. There are really fine tunes and interpretations, on which Simone gives an edge to the potentially fey pop songs, taking a sudden (but not uncharacteristic) break for a straight jazz instrumental with \"Blues on Purpose.\" The title track, a jazzy string ballad version of the Screamin Jay Hawkins classic, gave the Beatles the inspiration for the phrasing on the bridge of \"Michelle.\" Album: 7 of 37\n\nTitle: Pastel Blues\n\nReleased: 1965\n\nTracks: 9\n\nDuration: 35:53\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Be My Husband (03:23)\n\n2 Nobody Knows You When Youâre Down and Out (02:41)\n\n3 End of the Line (02:57)\n\n4 Trouble in Mind (02:43)\n\n5 Tell Me More, and More and Then Some (03:10)\n\n6 Chilly Winds Donât Blow (04:03)\n\n7 Ainât No Use (03:03)\n\n8 Strange Fruit (03:31)\n\n9 Sinnerman (10:20)\n\nPastel Blues : Allmusic album Review : If this is blues, its blues in the Billie Holiday sense, not the Muddy Waters one. This is one of Nina Simones more subdued mid-60s LPs, putting the emphasis on her piano rather than band arrangements. Its rather slanted toward torch-blues ballads like \"Strange Fruit,\" \"Trouble in Mind,\" Billie Holidays own composition \"Tell Me More and More and Then Some,\" and \"Nobody Knows You When Youre Down and Out.\" Simones then-husband, Andy Stroud, wrote \"Be My Husband,\" an effective adaptation of a traditional blues chant. By far the most impressive track is her frantic ten-minute rendition of the traditional \"Sinnerman,\" an explosive tour de force that dwarfs everything else on the album. Album: 8 of 37\n\nTitle: Wild Is the Wind\n\nReleased: 1966\n\nTracks: 11\n\nDuration: 39:19\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Wikipedia Allmusic AlbumCover 1 I Love Your Lovinâ Ways (02:40)\n\n2 Four Women (04:26)\n\n3 What More Can I Say (02:52)\n\n4 Lilac Wine (04:17)\n\n5 Thatâs All I Ask (02:32)\n\n6 Break Down and Let It All Out (02:40)\n\n7 Why Keep on Breaking My Heart (02:38)\n\n8 Wild Is the Wind (06:59)\n\n9 Black Is the Color of My True Loveâs Hair (03:29)\n\n10 If I Should Lose You (03:59)\n\n11 Either Way I Lose (02:45)\n\nWild Is the Wind : Allmusic album Review : This album was apparently a bit of a pastiche of leftovers from sessions for Nina Simones four previous albums on Philips. But youd never guess from listening; the material is certainly as strong and consistent as it is on her other mid-60s LPs. As is the case with most of her albums of the time, the selections are almost unnervingly diverse, ranging from jazz ballads to traditional folk tunes (\"Black Is the Color of My True Loves Hair\") to the near calypso of \"Why Keep on Breaking My Heart\" to the somber, almost chilling title track. Highlights are two outstanding pop-soul numbers written by the pre-disco Van McCoy (\"Either Way I Lose,\" \"Break Down and Let It All Out\") and \"Four Women,\" a string of searing vignettes about the hardships of four African-American women that ranks as one of Simones finest compositions. Album: 9 of 37\n\nTitle: Let It All Out\n\nReleased: 1966\n\nTracks: 11\n\nDuration: 37:01\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nSpotify Allmusic AlbumCover 1 Mood Indigo (02:28)\n\n2 The Other Woman (03:05)\n\n3 Love Me or Leave Me (04:06)\n\n4 Donât Explain (04:22)\n\n5 Little Girl Blue (02:36)\n\n6 Chauffeur (02:51)\n\n7 For Myself (02:08)\n\n8 The Ballad of Hollis Brown (04:58)\n\n9 This Yearâs Kisses (03:00)\n\n10 Images (02:53)\n\n11 Nearer Blessed Lord (04:32)\n\nLet It All Out : Allmusic album Review : Let It All Out is one of Nina Simones more adult pop-oriented mid-60s albums, with renditions of tunes by Duke Ellington (\"Mood Indigo\"), Billie Holiday (\"Dont Explain\"), Irving Berlin (\"This Years Kisses\"), and Rodgers & Hart (\"Little Girl Blue\"). As ever, Simone ranges wide in her selection: Bob Dylans \"The Ballad of Hollis Brown,\" a swaggering adaptation of \"Chauffeur Blues\" (credited to her husband of the time, Andy Stroud), the gospel hymn \"Nearer Blessed Lord,\" and Van McCoys \"For Myself.\" \"Images\" is an a cappella adaptation of a poem about the beauty of blackness by Waring Cuney. All of Simones Philips albums are solid, and this is no exception, although it isnt the best of them.

Indeed, her final album for that label, High Priestess of Soul, featured the singer, pianist, and songwriter fronting a virtual orchestra. Here, Simone is backed by a pair of guitarists (Eric Gale and Rudy Stevenson), bassist (Bob Bushnell), drummer (Bernard \"Pretty\" Purdie), organist (Ernie Hayes), and harmonica player who doubled on saxophone (Buddy Lucas). Simone handled the piano chores. The song selection is key here. Because for all intents and purposes this is perhaps the rawest record Simone ever cut. It opens with the sultry, nocturnal, slow-burning original \"Do I Move You,\" which doesnt beg the question but demands an answer: \"Do I move you?/Are you willin?/Do I groove you?/Is it thrillin?/Do I soothe you?/Tell the truth now?/Do I move you?/Are you loose now?/The answer better be yeah...It pleases me....\" As the guitarists slip and slide around her husky vocal, a harmonica wails in the space between, and Simones piano is the authority, hard and purposely slow. The other tune in that vein, \"In the Dark,\" is equally tense and unnerving; the band sounds as if its literally sitting around as she plays and sings. There are a number of Simone signature tunes on this set, including \"I Want a Little Sugar in My Bowl,\" \"Backlash Blues,\" and her singular, hallmark, definitive reading of \"My Mans Gone Now\" from Porgy and Bess. Other notable tracks are the raucous, sexual roadhouse blues of \"Buck,\" written by Simones then husband Andy Stroud, and the woolly gospel blues of \"Real Real,\" with the Hammond B-3 soaring around her vocal. The cover of Buddy Johnsons \"Since I Fell for You\" literally drips with ache and want. Simone also reprised her earlier performance of \"House of the Rising Sun\" (released on a 1962 Colpix live platter called At the Village Gate). It has more authority in this setting as a barrelhouse blues; its fast, loud, proud, and wailing with harmonica and B-3 leading the charge. The original set closes with the slow yet sassy \"Blues for Mama,\" ending with the same sexy strut the album began with, giving it the feel of a MÃ¶bius strip. Nina Simone Sings the Blues is a hallmark recording that endures; it deserves to be called a classic.

Hal Mooney directs some large band arrangements for the material on this LP without submerging Simones essential strengths. The more serious and introspective material is more memorable than the good-natured pop selections here. The highlights are her energetic vocal rendition of the Oscar Brown/Nat Adderley composition \"Work Song\" and her spiritual composition \"Come Ye,\" on which Simones inspirational vocals are backed by nothing other than minimal percussion.

Opening with a beautiful, introspective version of Leonard Cohens \"Suzanne,\" Simone shows an obvious affinity for social statements with the Byrds \"Turn! Turn! Turn! (To Everything There Is a Season)\" and a trio of Dylan standards: \"I Shall Be Released,\" \"Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues,\" plus a dramatic, meditative \"The Times They Are A-Changin.\" The title track, originally a 1967 hit for the Bee Gees and one year later for the Sweet Inspirations, suffers slightly from a weak, commercial-slanted arrangement, but her lone original, the two-part \"Revolution,\" is a great blend of blues-rock and soul testifying. Among a rut of jazz vocalists making the worst of a bad situation during the late 60s, To Love Somebody is a rare success.

With strident vocals and a thoughtful piano backing, Simone makes her own a pair of radically different (though similarly fatalistic) compositions, Blind Willie Johnsons \"Nobodys Fault But Mine\" and Randy Newmans \"I Think Its Going to Rain Today.\" Her version of \"Everyones Gone to the Moon\" leans dangerously close to avant-garde overkill, but she returns with good performances on \"Compensation\" and \"Who Am I?\" A great moment comes when a tambourine finally joins her midway through \"Another Spring,\" and the lone jazz standard (\"I Get Along Without You Very Well\") is given a touching performance. In an era when Simone often veered from crossover to experimental, Nina Simone and Piano! is undeniably difficult, but frequently rewarding.

Though the title track isnt very embarrassing -- her voice betrays a few technical faults -- there are few successes with the rest of the material. Simones versions of \"O-o-h Child,\" \"Mr. Bojangles,\" \"Just Like a Woman,\" and \"My Way\" are historical curiosities and sound terribly dated (the furious bongos and sweeping strings on the last is a dÃ©nouement). Much of the problem lies with the arrangements, though several times these passable rock songs get the best from Simones interpretive skills.

While it bears some of the musical stylings of the period -- light reggae inflections that hint of Steely Dans \"Haitian Divorce\" -- the vocals are unmistakably Simones. Like many of her albums, the content is wildly uneven; Simone simply covers too much ground and theres too little attention paid to how songs flow together. As a result, a robust torch piano ballad like \"Music for Lovers\" is followed immediately by one of Simones more awkward moments, an attempt to keep up with a jaunty rhythm track on a cover of Hall & Oates \"Rich Girl.\" Still, one must give her credit for always being provocative in her cover song choices, as she clearly scores on the Randy Newman-penned title track and a dramatic reading of Judy Collins \"My Father.\" Her voice throughout is in fine form, even when she phones it in on the album-closing traditional gospel tunes, but arranger David Matthews is a mismatch for her: He blows the arrangements with excessive string overlays and needlessly blaring background vocals. Simone herself all but disavowed the album shortly after its release, testament to her eternally contrarian, iconic nature. Despite her misgivings, though, Baltimore is an occasionally spellbinding if erratic album, a challenging and worthwhile listen for people ready to dip into the lesser-known entries in Nina Simones vast catalog.

Expanding the grammar of jazz by introducing elements of folk, soul, and pop, at Philips Simone redefined both her music and her place in music, making forever obsolete the stereotypes that long straitjacketed the role of women in American popular art. For the most part, My Baby Just Cares for Me eschews Simones most fiery political statements in favor of more intimate and idiosyncratic work -- listeners seeking a truly comprehensive portrait are recommended the excellent Four Women: The Complete Nina Simone Philips Recordings, but this single-disc overview hits many of the high points, including \"Old Jim Crow,\" \"Work Song,\" and \"Feeling Good.\" Album: 26 of 37\n\nTitle: Fodder on My Wings\n\nReleased: 1982\n\nTracks: 13\n\nDuration: 44:47\n\nScroll: Up Down Top Bottom 25% 50% 75%\n\nTrackSamples Allmusic Wikipedia AlbumCover 1 I Sing Just to Know That Iâm Alive (02:24)\n\n2 Fodder in Her Wings (05:35)\n\n3 Vous Ãªtes seuls, mais je dÃ©sire Ãªtre avec vous (04:30)\n\n4 Il y a un baume Ã Gilead (02:22)\n\n5 Liberian Calypso (02:59)\n\n6 Alone Again (Naturally) (06:27)\n\n7 I Was Just a Stupid Dog to Them (02:26)\n\n8 Color Is a Beautiful Thing (01:04)\n\n9 Le Peuple en Suisse (There Is No Returning) (04:58)\n\n10 Heaven Belongs to You (03:39)\n\n11 Thandewye (05:31)\n\n12 Stop (02:20)\n\n13 They Took My Hand (00:32)\n\nFodder on My Wings : Allmusic album Review : In the 1980s, Nina Simones recordings, particularly those cut in the studio, tended to be a bit erratic. Fodder on My Wings, which was recorded in Paris, is certainly all over the place, although mostly rewarding. Simone is joined by a rhythm section and occasionally a pair of unidentified horns (trumpet and tenor), an organ, and background singers. The repertoire includes the quiet ballad \"Il Y a un Baume a Gilhead,\" the rollicking \"Liberian Calypso,\" a unique unaccompanied and mostly out-of-tempo interpretation of \"Alone Together Naturally,\" and a brief satirical \"Color Is a Beautiful Thing.\" There are also singalongs, brief throwaways, and aching ballads. Far from flawless, there are enough strong moments to make this set of interest to Nina Simone fans.

While the backdrops were lush and occasionally corny, Simones deep, penetrating voice, careful pacing and dramatic delivery kept the songs from becoming sappy. While shes always been a great protest and political singer, Simone is also a superb romantic/love song stylist.

Though it was taken from the same performance as 1963s Nina Simone at Carnegie Hall, Folksy Nina duplicates little of the material found on that prior album. It isnt just unworthy leftovers, but a strong set in its own right, concentrating on material that could be seen as traditional or folk in orientation. Its not exactly strictly folk music, in repertoire or arrangement. However, there was an uptempo piano blues (Leadbellys \"Silver City Bound\") and covers of the Israeli \"Erets Zavat Chalav\" and \"Vanetihu\" which served as further proof that Simones eclecticism knew no bounds. There are also the kind of stark, moody, spiritually shaded ballads at which she excelled, like \"When I Was a Young Girl,\" \"Hush Little Baby,\" and \"Lass of the Low Country,\" the last of which is as exquisitely sad-yet-beautiful as it gets. Simone had long since departed the Colpix label by the time of the 1966 release of Nina with Strings. That accounts for its pasted-together contents, which combined some previously unreleased material with tracks with strings. This is not the Nina Simone record to start with, but if you like Simone enough to seek out a lot of her albums, theres some worthwhile music here, even if the programming isnt so smooth. Although Simone sings well on every take, the standards are outshone by the earthier tunes, like \"Chain Gang (The Work Song).\" Certainly the best number is \"Blackbird,\" with its creepy bass and percussive slaps the only accompaniment for Simones magnificent spiritual vocal, although those apt to be considering buying this in the first place are likely to already have it on Rhinos Anthology: The Colpix Years.

Its not a thorough examination of her career by any stretch, but it does feature what many consider to be ideal performances of two of her most well-known songs: \"I Loves You, Porgy\" and \"Black Is the Color of My True Loves Hair.\" Fans of Simones work will already have many of these recordings courtesy of other records, but casual listeners wanting to hear the softer side of this revolutionary jazz chanteuse will find this an excellent place to start, and will want to dig deeper into her rich back catalog.
