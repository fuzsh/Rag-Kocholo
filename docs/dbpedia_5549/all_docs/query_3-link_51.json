        "text": "Eunice Kathleen Waymon was born on February 21, 1939 in Tyron North Carolina. At the extraordinary young age of four Eunice both learned to play the piano and was a devout member of her church’s choir. Eunice came from large family, she was the sixth of seven children. She lived a very humble life due to her family’s financial instability. Eunice’s music teacher saw the potential that she possessed and started a special fund that was meant to assist Eunice in continuing her education after high school. Eunice won a scholarship to study classical music at Julliard, a prestigious performing arts university, located in New York City. In order to stay in school Eunice had to work. She gave piano lessons and was the accompanist for the other performers that attended Julliard. Despite her efforts she eventually ran out of money and could no longer fund her education. Eunice then moved to Philadelphia to live with her family while she saved money to reapply to a more affordable music school. Eunice applied to the curtis Institute of Music min Philadelphia, but was rejected. And it was apparent that her rejection was solely based upon her race. After her rejection from the Curtis Institute of Music she left her classical music aspirations behind. She began to play American standards, jazz and blues in clubs during the 1950’s. At the request of a club owner Eunice began singing along with her music. She then took the stage name ‘Nina Simone,’ Nina meaning “little one” and Simone after the actress Simone Signoret. Nina Simone won over many audiences, but she especially caught the attentions of the writers involved in The Harlem Renaissance, such as, Langston Hughes, Lorraine Hansberry and James Baldwin. Nina Simone signed to the Bethlehem label. She recorded and released her first album in 1958. It was said that Simone’s music defied standard definitions. Her music style drew from many sources, like, gospel, pop and folk. Simone was referred to as the “High Priestess of Soul,” but she never fully accepted this title. By the mid 1960’s Simone became known as the voice of the Civil Rights Movement. The songs she wrote and sang were politically charged, and she was clear about the message she wanted to bring across: equality. One example of this message is her song “Mississippi Goddam,” which was written after Medgar Evars assassination and the Birmingham Church Bombing, which killed 4 young African American girls in 1963. Another example is her song “Why (the king of love is dead) which was written after the assassination of yet another prominent civil rights leader, Dr. Martin Luther King jr, in 1968. Nina Simone sang her truth with great emotion and power."
