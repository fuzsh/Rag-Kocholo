        "text": "If you’re anything like us, most often when you’re dancing, you’re also drinking. So hey, it’s no surprise that a large number of tunes out there are about doing just that – booze!\n\nAnd we’ve rounded up the best of the boozy best, right here, from Rihanna to Chumbawumba (you know the one we mean). So fill up that cup and wack on this playlist: it’s time to dance. Here are the best songs about drinking to wet the whistle.\n\nRECOMMENDED:\n\n🎉 The best party songs 🎤 The best karaoke songs\n\n🕺 The best pop songs of all time\n\n😃 The best happy songs\n\n🍆 The best sexy songs\n\nWritten by Michael Chen, Brent DiCrescenzo, Sophie Harris, Oliver Keens, Andy Kryza, Hank Shteamer, Kate Wertheimer, Zach Long, Matthew Singer, Leonie Cooper and Camille Bavera.\n\n1. ‘Gin & Juice’ by Snoop Dogg\n\nThis was the first rap song to provide high-school parties with a cocktail recipe right in the title. Well, juice can be expensive. But ‘Gin & Gatorade’ just doesn’t have the same mellifluousness. On a side note, when’s the last time you heard someone refer to weed as ‘indo’? 1994?\n\n2. ‘Make It Another Old-Fashioned, Please’, Julie London\n\nWith a voice as smooth as the whiskey she's singing about, vintage torch singer Julie London makes an Old Fashioned the only cocktail worth ordering with her silky take on this Cole Porter classic. ‘Make it for one who's due to join the disillusion crew/Make it for one of love's new refugees,’ she croons – though she doesn’t sound too upset about her lovelorn situation. That’s the power of a stiff drink, I suppose.\n\nLeonie Cooper\n\nFood and Drink Editor, Time Out London\n\nAdvertising\n\n3. ‘Streams of Whiskey’ by The Pogues\n\nIn one of the folk-punk outfits peppiest (or at least whistle-iest) hits, Pogues frontman Shane MacGowan spins a yarn about a dream he had (presumably not while sober) of walking hand in hand with Irish poet Brendan Behan and learning of an afterlife where the brown stuff flows in rivers. (There’s also talk of a 15-beer bender, because The Pouges are gonna Pogues). Forced to choose one Pogues song — this list could have been nothing but Pogues songs — it’s ‘Streams of Whiskey’ by a drinker’s nose.\n\n4. ‘Doses and Mimosas’ by Cherub\n\n‘Doses and Mimosas’ is one of those silly, catchy tunes that sort of sounds like it should be in a car advert, but you love it anyway. In true 2013 fashion, the ‘Cherub’ duo uploaded this track to YouTube only to become a viral sensation in just one week, garnering one and a half million views and a deal with Columbia records. May it forever live on as a reminder of, well, drinking mostly.\n\nCamille Bavera\n\nContributor, Time Out London\n\nAdvertising\n\n5. ‘Lilac Wine’ by Nina Simone\n\nOriginally penned in 1950 for a theater revue, ‘Lilac Wine’ has been covered by such greats as Eartha Kitt, Jeff Buckley and, er, Miley Cyrus. But only the High Priestess of Soul is able to give this moody ode to infatuation the drama and chill its lyrics and melody beg for. In her 1966 interpretation, her voice prowls around the song’s deliciously dark lyrics like a cat, and for the listener, intoxication is inevitable.\n\n6. ‘Brass Monkey’ by Beastie Boys\n\nIt’s an obvious observation, but this song came out before the Internet. Which means that I – like tens of thousands of 12-year-olds in 1986, I would imagine – was unable to immediately figure out what the hell the B Boys were whine-shouting about. I’ll admit it: I thought the rap was about a monkey. Then, in high school, I learned from friends that a Brass Monkey was a sort of gutter mimosa – malt liquor and O.J. Gross. Then, in college, thanks to the World Wide Web, I discovered the source of that funk-skronk horn: Wild Sugar’s deep-disco cut, ‘Bring It Here.’ Rad. And they say friends are better than the Internet.\n\nAdvertising\n\n7. ‘Whiskey River’ by Willie Nelson\n\nSome consideration was given to ‘I Gotta Get Drunk,’ a 1970 Willie tune covered wonderfully by Phosphorescent in 2009. But that was the short-haired, clean-shaven Willie. On principle, we went with this classic off of Shotgun Willie, from the dawn of his stoner-cowboy era. Even though it was written by Johnny Bush, the song belongs to Willie, as essential to him as long braids and a bandanna.\n\n8. ‘Too Drunk to Fuck’ by Dead Kennedys\n\nHey, it’s happened to the best of us. This 1981 surf-rock-heavy single was the fourth from the California punkers, who paint an exaggerated party picture mostly to offend music-industry prudes. Although the song reached No. 36 on the U.K. singles chart, it was often banned or censored, leading the Kennedys to supply a sticker for record shops reading ‘Caution: You are the victim of yet another stodgy retailer afraid to warp your mind by revealing the title of this record, so peel slowly and see…’ Nice touch, Biafra.\n\nAdvertising\n\n9. ‘Sippin’ on Some Syrup’ by Three 6 Mafia\n\nCough medicine plus Sprite, plus Jolly Ranchers. Holy shit, people drink that? Sprite? Look, when you’re broke, you have to get creative with your addictions. Anything can become a habit. As Pimp C proclaimed in this song in 2000: ‘We eat so many shrimp, I’ve got iodine poisoning.’ So how did this Memphis hip-hop troupe go on to win an Oscar in 2006, for ‘It's Hard Out Here for a Pimp’? Even pharmacists would have a hard time finding rhymes for promethazine and hydrocodone.\n\n10. ‘Alabama Song (Whisky Bar)’ by the Doors\n\nPenned by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill for the incendiary 1930 opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, this song was originally performed by a chorus of prostitutes. This more famous cover was recorded by the Doors in 1966 with a carnivalesque sound that perfectly illustrates what it's like to be smashed and along for the ride (which Jim Morrison very likely was).\n\n11. ‘Friends in Low Places’ by Garth Brooks\n\nYou can’t help but sing along with the common people at the local watering hole when the jukebox starts playing Garth Brooks’s 1990 ode to drinking the blues away. You’ll suddenly find yourself line dancing with folks you’ve never met and seeing if your vocal register can go to those low places in the song’s signature chorus. And, of course, there will be plenty of whiskey and beer flowing. Fun fact: In the perfect marriage of song to hapless sports team, the Kansas City Royals (two winning seasons in the last 19 years) adopted ‘Friends in Low Places’ as their sixth-inning sing-along anthem. It serves as a constant reminder to beleaguered fans that misery loves company…and booze.\n\nMichael Chen\n\n12. ‘Tubthumping’ by Chumbawumba\n\nAnyone who knew of the British anarcho-punk band in their indie days must’ve been completely baffled when the group signed to a major in the mid-’90s and hit it big with this exuberant ode to getting drunk, getting knocked down and getting back up again. It persists as a source of inspiration for suburban normies, but that’s sort of the point - the band has described the song as being about ‘the resilience of ordinary people’. It also catalogs their curious drinking habits. A whiskey drink, a vodka drink, a lager drink and a cider drink? Maybe stop mixing your alcohol and you won’t fall down so much.\n\nMatthew Singer\n\nFilm writer and editor\n\nAdvertising\n\n13. ‘Here Comes a Regular’ and ‘Beer for Breakfast’ (tie) by the Replacements\n\nFrom what I’ve heard and seen on YouTube of their early concerts, the Mats made all their songs drinking songs. The gloriously shambolic punk stuff raged like an adolescent who's seen a specter of his older self just ahead, slumped at a local bar and stamped with a gas-station name tag. Conversely, young Paul Westerberg’s ballads carried the sadness of a middle-aged nobody yearning for his salad days. Somehow, the Minnesotans shifted between these two gears without blowing the clutch, as heard in these respective cuts from 1985 and ’87.\n\n14. ‘There’s a Tear in My Beer’ by Hank Williams Sr.\n\nThough only one carried the title outright, all of Williams’s songs were ‘Long Gone Lonesome Blues’ at heart. The Alabama-born legend was tough as an old strip of donkey jerky, yet many of his songs revolved around crying. It made him more of a man – a man with a leather liver. ‘These last nine beers,’ he sings in that high hillbilly whine on this Nashville session, have only convinced him: ‘I’m gonna keep drinkin’ until I'm petrified.’ A couple years later, in 1953, they pulled his body out of a Caddy littered with beer cans and lyric sheets.\n\nAdvertising\n\n15. ‘Drunken Lullabies’ by Flogging Molly\n\nWhen you’re a few drinks in, there’s something about driving rhythms and violin melodies that makes you want to sing along at the top of your lungs. Celtic punks Flogging Molly understand this phenomenon well, so it stands to reason that the title track of their 2002 record is a song about the songs you belt out after a few shots of whiskey.\n\n16. ‘Why Don’t We Get Drunk’ by Jimmy Buffet\n\nSeems old Jimmy stopped looking for that shaker of salt, shrugged and switched his focus to hooking up with another drunkard at the bar. On a water bed, no less. Because of course Jimmy Buffet – in his pre-Margaritaville country phase of the early ‘70s – does gross things on a water bed.\n\nAdvertising\n\n17. ‘Shots’ by LMFAO featuring Lil Jon\n\nWe hate this song as much as you do. Of course we do. But the entire belly-shot community would beg to differ. And answer us this: Has any piece of music better simulated the jackhammering headache of a Russian-grade hangover?\n\n18. ‘Cheap Beer’ by FIDLAR\n\n‘Beer’s always better with a bag around it,’ the skater punks of FIDLAR (an acronym for Fuck It, Dawg, Life’s a Risk – really) proclaim over polluted waves of crust-surf guitar in this 2013 burner. ‘I! Drink! Cheap! Beer! So! What! Fuck! You!’ shouts the chorus. Gotta respect a band whose entire raison d’être is to score shitty brews via tour riders. Would you really rather listen to Animal Collective, hippie?\n\nAdvertising\n\n19. ‘Sunday Mornin’ Comin’ Down’ by Kris Kristofferson\n\nMost of the songs on this list celebrate nights of debauchery, but only Kris Kristofferson thought to pour one out for the blurry morning after. The country troubadour’s ode to morning beers, sleepy city sidewalks, fried-chicken envy and pounding headaches is one of the loveliest country tunes ever written (Johnny Cash does a stellar take): Far from a Hangover-style (or Katy Perry’s ‘Last Friday Night’) recap of a rowdy night, Kristofferson’s song is a quiet, reflective number that pops with descriptive poetry and introspection. Now somebody makes this man’s wish come true and get him stoned.\n\n20. ‘Pass the Courvoisier, Part II’ by Busta Rhymes\n\nLikely in constant rotation on Ladies Man Leon Phelps’ playlist, this megahit for Busta came at the height of hip hop’s obsession with luxury items, but don’t worry, it’s just as smooth if you’re drinking Black Velvet while listening. Rhymes’s signature rat-a-tat growl pairs nicely with the slick Neptunes beat, with Diddy and Pharrell even showing up to affirm that yes, they too would enjoy a glass of Courvasier.\n\n41. ‘Cheers (Drink to That)’ by Rihanna\n\nA toast to our interns, who chided us for overlooking this my-first-reggaetón chillaxer from 2010. ‘Don't let the bastards get you down,’ RiRi sings in her patois. Basic Rihanna rule: The more Caribbean she sounds, the better. Jameson Irish whiskey gets plugged heavily over a sample of Avril Lavigne, which reeks of product placement (there's a shout-out to Ray-Bans, too, official hangover concealer of Rihanna), but at least it's not Malibu.\n\n42. ‘Warm Beer and Cold Women’ by Tom Waits\n\n…makes the rankings on title alone. But this creaky weeper from 1975's Nighthawks at the Diner manages to rhyme vermouth with Naugahyde booth, too. Admit it: Young-barfly Tom Waits totally destroys old-man-in-a-rusty-shed-with-a-mule Tom Waits.\n\nAdvertising\n\n43. ‘Drunk Girls’ by LCD Soundsystem\n\nIs ‘Drunk Girls’ LCD Soundsystem’s finest hour? No, of course not. But does it feel like a night of reckless boozing in New York City? Absolutely. James Murphy himself has described the 2010 single as ‘dumb.’ But, he added, ‘I like dumb, short stuff.’ More reasons to dig ‘Drunk Girls’? The wince-inducing video, codirected by Spike Jonze, shows Murphy and the LCD crew being manhandled by malevolent pandas. Dumb ‘n’ short 4 evah.\n\n44. ‘One Mint Julep’ by Louis Prima\n\nFleeting happiness in the haze of a drunken hour: Many songs have trod this path, but in the words of this jazz-pop standard, ‘One mint julep / Was the start of it all.’ Originally a hit for ’50s doo-wop group the Clovers on Atlantic Records, the tune tells of stealing an intoxicated kiss from a woman after one sweet, minty cocktail, only to get hitched (at her father's demand) and end up confused, hungover and the father of six kids. Quite the tipple. Though Ray Charles's 1961 instrumental cover made it a hit, Louis Prima's unmistakably comic tone gives his version the edge.\n\nAdvertising\n\n45. ‘Shot For Me’ by Drake\n\nIf this booze-soaked R&B ode to former flames sounds like something that the Weeknd should be singing, that's just because Abel Tesfaye actually wrote it. Released back when Drake was extremely in his feelings and fancied himself a singer (as well as a rapper), ‘Shot For Me’ finds the Canadian star spitefully reminding his exes to remember just how great he was when they knock back a glass of Canadian Club, or whatever folks shoot in Toronto.\n\n46. ‘Drunk in Love’ by Beyoncé\n\nYes, ostensibly it’s a love song, but c’mon, Beyoncé was likely deep in her cups last year when she blurted the non sequitur hashtag ‘Surfbordt!’ Ditto for Jay-Z, who could not have been sober when he wrote, ‘Your breastesses is my breakfast.’ I think he stole that from Bukowski?\n\nAdvertising\n\n47. ‘Cigarettes, Whuskey, and Wild, Wild Women’ by Sons of Pioneers\n\nA sing-songy ode to the insanity-inducing allure of tobacco, brown liquor and the fairer sex, this old-timey barn-burner has been covered a billion or so times, with Buck Owens, Jim Croce and Ron Wood all offering up solid versions. The best, though? It’s the version performed by Peter Sellers and a cadre of felt hillbillies in covered-wagon times during his hosting stint on The Muppet Show. And no, we didn’t just make that up because we’ve been drinking ‘whuskey’ while writing.\n\n48. ‘Whiskey Girl’ by Gillian Welch\n\nThere are drinking songs to carouse to, and there are drinking songs to listen to at 4am while you pour out another whiskey and your mind turns over what could’ve been, or where you could get cigarettes at this hour. Taken from Gillian Welch’s exquisite, bleak 1998 album, Hell Among the Yearlings, ‘Whiskey Girl’ falls into the latter category – and how.\n\nAdvertising\n\n49. ‘Bubbles in my Beer’ by Bob Wills\n\nEventually covered by the likes of Willie Nelson and George Jones, this 1947 Western swing standard may well have started the sub-genre of woeful country songs about drinking away your sorrows. It’s bit antiquated and a little depressing, but it’s one of the jauntiest tunes about self-absorbed contemplation you’ll ever hear.\n\n50. ‘You and Me and the Bottle Make Three’ by Big Bad Voodoo Daddy\n\nBack in the ‘90s, the universe declared that what America needed was a big-band swing revival, and BBVD led the charge with this boozy anthem that ensured a whole subculture would suffer concussions due to ill-advised swing dancing after several drinks. (Whether it also resulted in a spike in dancefloor-based concussions is unknown.) The song got huge via the film Swingers... then disappeared from the collective consciousness along with the Cherry ’ Daddies. But when it resurfaces, it's a stealth hit for anyone who ever used ‘that's so money’ in casual conversation."
