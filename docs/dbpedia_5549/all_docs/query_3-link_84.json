        "text": "Nina Simone ( NEE-nə sim-OHN;[1] born Eunice Kathleen Waymon; February 21, 1933 – April 21, 2003) was an American singer, songwriter, pianist, composer, arranger, and civil rights activist. Her music spanned styles including classical, folk, gospel, blues, jazz, R&B, and pop. Her piano playing was strongly influenced by baroque and classical music, especially Johann Sebastian Bach,[2] and accompanied expressive, jazz-like singing in her contralto voice.[3][4]\n\nQuick Facts Background information, Birth name ...\n\nClose\n\nThe sixth of eight children born into a poor family in North Carolina, Simone initially aspired to be a concert pianist.[5] With the help of a few supporters in her hometown, she enrolled in the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.[6] She then applied for a scholarship to study at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where, despite a well received audition, she was denied admission,[7] which she attributed to racism. In 2003, just days before her death, the institute awarded her an honorary degree.[8]\n\nEarly in her career, to make a living, Simone played piano at a nightclub in Atlantic City. She changed her name to \"Nina Simone\" to disguise herself from family members, having chosen to play \"the devil's music\" or so-called \"cocktail piano\".[7] She was told in the nightclub that she would have to sing to her own accompaniment, which effectively launched her career as a jazz vocalist.[9] She went on to record more than 40 albums between 1958 and 1974, making her debut with Little Girl Blue. She released her first and biggest hit single in the United States in 1959 with \"I Loves You, Porgy\" which peaked inside the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[5] Simone also became known for her work in the civil rights movement during the 1950s and 1960s,[10] and she later fled the United States and settled in France following the assassination of her friend Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968.[11] She lived and performed in Europe, Africa, and the Caribbean throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.[12] In 1991, Simone published her autobiography, I Put a Spell on You (taking the title from her famous 1965 album), and she continued to perform and attract audiences until her death.[13]"
