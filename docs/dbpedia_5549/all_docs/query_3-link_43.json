        "text": "In 1999, my girlfriend Julie and I decided to settle back East after spending five years in Seattle and San Francisco. We flew out to North Carolina together and signed a lease on a house-- though, she moved a few months before I did because I'd had to fly back to finish a writing project. I quit my paralegal job just after getting back, ending a three-year stint with a large law firm downtown. At my farewell party, the people I worked for pitched in and gave me a $100 gift certificate to the Wherehouse Music chain.\n\nI used to go to the Wherehouse near my office on my lunch break all the time. The stock was predictably awful, but that didn't worry me when it came to this generous gift. I enjoyed the challenge of being forced to spend that kind of money in a crappy record store. I remember wandering the aisles with a list of CDs in my hand, knowing that with all those racks of music, there must be something I actually wanted. In a pinch, I knew I could burn $18.99 of the credit for a Beatles album I'd lost five years ago and hadn't missed; but if possible, I wanted to take chances. I only remember two purchases from that particular gift certificate: one was a budget-priced Edith Piaf compilation; the other was a Nina Simone two-fer containing Wild Is the Wind and High Priestess of Soul, albums from what is generally considered her prime period-- 1966 and 1967, respectively. I knew Nina Simone was an artist with a cult following (I thought of her as a jazz singer at the time), but that was about it. I'd never heard her music.\n\nBack home with my new records, the first thing that struck me was the voice. Though I'd heard her compared to Billie Holliday and later discovered that she recorded many of the songs that Lady Day made famous, Simone couldn't have sounded more different. She was like Holiday's mirror image. Where Holiday sang with delicacy, Simone's voice was low, husky, and sometimes downright masculine. More incredibly, it seemed to change with every song, adapting itself to the needs of the material. She would whisper in my ear one moment and scream in it, slightly out of tune, the next. With her impossibly expressive voice, Simone quickly pulled me into her orbit.\n\nOne track on my new CD stood far above the rest. Indie rock fans are probably familiar with Jeff Buckley's version of the old song \"Lilac Wine\" (he was a Simone admirer), which appeared on both Grace and his Mystery White Boy live album, but I'd never I'd never heard it before buying Wild Is the Wind. Those last few months living alone in San Francisco, nothing captured the ache that came from my separation from Julie better than \"Lilac Wine.\" I can honestly say Simone makes it the saddest song I know.\n\nSimone sings \"Lilac Wine\" as a woman defeated and hopeless. Unable to face reality after being separated from her lover, she drinks a magic wine brewed from lilac flowers and slips into a fantasy world where the blurred image of her lover may or may not appear. But the potion is doubly cruel, because it promises a taste of all she's missed and then snatches it back again. Not only is her vision an illusion, it's also cruelly fleeting, and madness overtakes her. The spare arrangement highlights Simone's piano, and gentle gospel chords impart a sense of the sacred, making the doomed intoxication seem like a necessary ritual. A word of warning to the curious: putting Simone's version of \"Lilac Wine\" on the stereo when you're lonely and missing your lover is a dangerous game.\n\nI quickly discovered that Wild Is the Wind and High Priestess of Soul had a few other gems. \"That's All I Ask\" is a moving display of Simone's interpretive power. She takes a simple line like, \"Nobody knows how deep my love for you really goes,\" and transforms it into a complex portrait of a tortured heart. She achieves this by repeating the word \"nobody\" six times at the beginning of the line and gradually modulating her intonation with each repetition, starting out in strong voice and degenerating into a fragile, off-key falsetto by the end. A declaration of love transforms into a confession of loneliness using one single word.\n\nLike many artists from the era, Simone never shied away from incorporating politics into her music. Wild Is the Wind contains the Simone original \"Four Women,\" a tense portrait of four women divided by the spectrum of their skin color, and the roles they wind up playing in a white society. The deep roots of racism and oppression in the United States was a consistent theme through all of Simone's work, and she ultimately left this country in the mid-70s, like many African-American artists before her. With its tight structure and detailed observation, \"Four Women\" makes a case for Simone as a top-flight lyricist, even though she typically wrote only a couple of songs per album.\n\nMore overtly political is an album I picked up much later, Simone's bizarre 1973 live record Emergency Ward. Half of it was recorded at Fort Dix, and the outer sleeve is pasted with up-to-the-minute newspaper clippings about the Vietnam War, but the music comes at conflict from another angle. The first side of Emergency Ward consists of an 18-minute version of George Harrison's \"My Sweet Lord\" (she recorded many Harrison songs over the years, including the definitive version of \"Here Comes the Sun\"), performed live with a gospel band and given the rhythmic punch of The Capitols' \"Cool Jerk.\" This medley alternates between a spirited and funky reading of the Harrison tune and slow, downcast piano interludes that have Simone setting a poem called \"Today Is a Killer\" to music. This amazing piece of work effortlessly navigates emotional extremes, and the weird juxtaposition of song, mood and texture, and the track's extreme length, could only come from a mind that heard music very differently. In any case, \"My Sweet Lord/Today Is a Killer\" is the rare 18-minute song that seems too short, despite the drain of the emotional oscillation.\n\nSimone is not well known in the U.S. at the moment, despite her prolific recording career. Some of Simone's relative anonymity is due to her inconsistency. She released a lot of music in her prime, and a sizable chunk of it was substandard. And more than any artist I can name, Simone's music was all over the place in terms of genre or style. She jumped from jazz to folk to showtunes to blues to the latest pop hit by Bob Dylan or Barry Gibb, typically on the same album. Simone's moved so rapidly from one genre to the next that the canon-makers of each tended to throw up their hands and overlook her entirely. She received a featured compilation as part of Verve's Jazz Masters series, for example, but doesn't merit a mention in the third edition of the Penguin Guide; elsewhere, she's completely overlooked by pop historians.\n\n\"Lilac Wine\" was my doorway to Simone's world, and I continue to explore her music with wonder. She's a complete original, totally beyond category. Though I've still only bought three albums and two compilations, I can say with confidence that Nina Simone was one of the most brilliant and expressive artists working in music the 60s and 70s, with a staggering body of original and interpretive work. Her cult is still going strong and she's loved abroad, but I'm amazed at how little I hear about Simone in her home country. She's not on the cultural radar in America, and that's wrong. It's time for reissues, wholesale critical reappraisal and deeper understanding. Nina Simone is that good."
