        "text": "In an interview repurposed in the buoyant concert documentary Summer of Soul (…Or, When the Revolution Could Not Be Televised), the legendary singer Nina Simone declares: \"An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times.\"\n\nBut what happens when the powers that be are only interested in reflecting a certain, partial view of history?\n\nA joint archival and oral history project, Summer of Soul restores the nearly lost record of the 1969 Harlem Cultural Festival: a free, civic-minded concert series that, over six weekends, drew close to 300,000 people with a pinch-yourself roll call of musicians at peak powers, such as Simone, Stevie Wonder, BB King, the Staples Singers and Gladys Knight and the Pips.\n\nWhen The Roots drummer and joint frontman Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson first heard talk about the festival, it seemed like \"a rumour\", he said, an impossible dream.\n\nBut evidence did exist – recorded by the late TV veteran Hal Tulchin on a shoestring budget, with five portable video cameras amassing 40 hours of 2-inch analogue tape.\n\nThe footage played as a couple of TV specials and then – as Summer of Soul's opening titles explain – languished in Tulchin's basement for 50 years, with the occasional bootleg clip surfacing in documentaries or on YouTube.\n\nTulchin had shopped it around, even renaming it The Black Woodstock to try and gain interest. \"It didn't help,\" he says. \"Nobody was interested in a Black show.\"\n\nHalf a century later, it's thankfully a different story; the project was revived and Thompson brought in, channelling his storytelling skills as a musician, teacher, author and musical director (notably, of this year's Oscars) to transform a mountain of raw footage into his feature directorial debut.\n\nThe footage is riveting on its own, from a 19-year-old Stevie Wonder jauntily taking to a drum kit, to the 5th Dimension's whirligig performance of their crossover hit Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In, embellished with James Brown-style preacher growls for the Harlem crowd.\n\nBut instead of just cutting it down to a highlights reel of, say, 15 tracks, each blistering performance comes swaddled in news clip montages and contemporary talking-heads interviews from festival-goers, intellectuals and the artists themselves, which show the music scholar's ever-curious, dot-connecting brain at work.\n\nThompson's most significant authorial intervention is to expand the focus far beyond just the six consecutive Sunday afternoon concerts over which the festival took place.\n\n\"1969 was a change of era in the Black community,\" says an off-screen Harlem resident over a montage of establishing shots: images show hand-painted 'Black is Beautiful' signs, a sea of Black Panther berets, and crowd footage bursting with exuberant fashions and natural Afros; \"We were creating a new world.\"\n\nBy the point that Simone, in full 'High Priestess of Soul' mode, performs the rousing tribute To Be Young, Gifted and Black, the film has devoted generous space to situating viewers in the summer of 69 in order to better appreciate the full power of her words landing at that particular moment.\n\nIt had been a year since Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination and the protests that shook Harlem, capping a decade marked by great advances and tragic losses in the Black Power and Civil Rights movements.\n\nThis unique historical juncture is also evoked by scenes from the concert. Performing their dreamy hit My Girl, The Temptations' David Ruffin raises a hand to the sky while crooning the line \"I've got a sweeter song than the birds in the trees\", acknowledging the Panthers members perched above the crowd on branches, providing security for the event after the NYPD initially refused.\n\nWith a DJ's fine pacing and ability to manipulate audience emotions like putty, Thompson positions a gospel duet – Mahalia Jackson and Mavis Staples singing Precious Lord, Take My Hand, King's favourite, introduced by Reverend Jesse Jackson's moving eulogy – as the film's transcendent centrepiece.\n\nBy the time the two commanding women are sending the crowd into raptures, passing a microphone back and forth while drawing out a syllable to its glorious breaking point, the emotional pitch of the film has dramatically jumped. Staples' commentary returns to describe the \"unreality\" of singing alongside Jackson, her idol.\n\nIf Mahalia represents the majesty of the older generation, then Sly and the Family Stone were \"a whole new thing\", and they knock the crowd flat all over again.\n\nCommentary from those who were there on the day highlights the impact of first seeing the band's outrageous, casual attire – with Sly's big sunglasses and loose black and purple silks a wild contrast to the peppy polished professionalism, embodied by the tux-wearing Motown groups, that most Black performers felt obliged to uphold in public in the 60s.\n\nAnd then there's the sheer discombobulating energy of the set, with their rendition of Everyday People, an all-in anthem for equality, bolstered by the then-radical presence of female band members and a white drummer, together on the one stage.\n\nThe film builds on this revolutionary mood throughout, foregrounding the joy and spirituality of performances – whether the musician's background was religious or otherwise – while illustrating how the festival was pivotal in exploding homogenous notions of 'Black music' for all who bore witness that summer.\n\nThompson knows the silver screen holds the power to consecrate pop culture myths: the Monterey Pop festival, immortalised by D.A. Pennebaker's film, announced the Summer of Love; the Rolling Stones' 69 US tour documentary, Gimme Shelter, emitted end-of-an-era chills; and Michael Wadleigh's concert film of Woodstock – which took place the same summer as the Harlem Music Festival – secured the event's place in the history books, inspiring the millions who saw it in theatres (including an 11-year-old Prince).\n\nThompson's film avows that the name of the Harlem Music Festival should resonate as weightily as those predominantly white counter-cultural festivals, and that it deserves to be recognised as one of the most monumental cultural events of that year.\n\nAs the film explores, many festival-goers considered it to be a much bigger deal – and better use of funds – than the Apollo 11 moon landing, which also overlapped dates.\n\nAmbitiously intertwining all these narrative threads, Thompson's approach is expansive and welcoming – though whether you think this scaffolding enriches or detracts from the material will likely be a matter of personal taste.\n\nWhere the intensely sustained focus of the recently released Aretha Franklin concert film Amazing Grace captured Franklin ascending, the constant cutaways and commentary running throughout Summer of Soul risk sapping power from the performances themselves.\n\nSome insights are undeniably moving – like Marilyn McCoo choking up while talking about how the 5th Dimension were often mistaken for white performers because their sound was considered \"not Black enough\" – and recast the material in fresh light.\n\nBut it can be grating to sit through truisms like \"It was the right time, the right place\" (festival-goer Dorinda Drake) or \"The power of music is to tell our own stories\" (Hamilton's Lin-Manuel Miranda) when you're aware of how much phenomenal footage was left on the cutting room floor.\n\nI, for one, am hanging out for an extended cut with Sly's set in full."
