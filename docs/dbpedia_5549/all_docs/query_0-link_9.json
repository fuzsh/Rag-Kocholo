        "text": "Nina Simone—born Eunice Kathlen Waymon in Tryon, North Carolina—abhorred being categorized as a jazz artist. Never one to be put in a box, she felt the moniker limiting. This is understandable seeing that Nina not only regularly sang and played jazz, but blues, folk, and classical music as well. Indeed, few musicians are talented enough to cross entries genres and do it as proficiently and as elegantly as she did. The sixth child of seven from a poor family, Nina was a musical prodigy who started playing the piano at three years old. Because she was so talented, her music teacher set up the Eunice Waymond Fund to enable her to continue her general and musical education. Yet even at a young age, Nina was the voice of protest.\n\nAt 10, her music teacher arranged a piano recital in the town hall. However, being in the Jim Crow South, two white patrons who wished to be seated closer to the stage made Nina’s parents give up their seats right before Nina was set to perform. Nina cried and screamed and refused to play until her parents got their seats back. Originally, Nina wanted to go to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia to continue her musical education. Although she admirably passed the battery of tests she had to take for entry, she was not granted admission. Nina later found out the reason she was denied was because she was black. Instead, she studied at the Julliard School of Music in New York instead where she trained as a classical pianist. In order to make ends meet and to send money back home, in 1954 she took a job playing piano in an Irish bar in Atlantic City. This is where her life would change forever.\n\nTo Nina’s bewilderment, the owner advised her she would have to sing as well as play the piano. She later started using Nina Simone as he stage name so that her mother—a staunch Methodist minister—would not know she was playing the devil’s music. From the Spanish word that means little girl, she took Nina; she adopted Simone from the French actress Simone Signoret. Nina started gaining a name for herself, but didn’t hit her stride until 1959 when she did a remake of George Gershwin’s I Love You Porgy, from the play Porgy and Bess. Eventually, she signed a contract with Colpix Records and did both studio and live albums. At this point, she was still singing popular music. This all would change with the coming Civil Rights storm of protests in the 1960’s. Perhaps because of being born and raised in the racially intolerant South, or because she had been turned down at the Curtis Institute because she was black, Nina fully embraced the Civil Right Movement."
