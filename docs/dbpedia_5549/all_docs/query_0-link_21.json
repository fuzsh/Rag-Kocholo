Her prodigious talent emerged early, with her learning to play the piano by ear at the age of three. Her mother, a Methodist minister, often had Simone play at church services, blending her musical talent with spiritual influences.\n\nSimone's formal music education began at a local piano school. At 12, she gave a recital where she faced racial segregation head-on when her parents were forced to move to the back of the hall. This experience marked her growing awareness of racial injustice.\n\nHer dedication to classical music led her to the Juilliard School in New York City. Scholarships and financial support from her hometown community helped fund her studies. Despite her classical ambitions, racial barriers thwarted her plans of attending the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia.\n\nFirst Musical Engagements\n\nUnable to pursue classical music due to racial discrimination, Simone began performing popular music in Atlantic City. To avoid her mother's disapproval, she adopted the stage name \"Nina Simone.\" During this time, she developed her signature blend of classical, jazz, and blues.\n\nHer first major break came in 1958 with a recording of \"I Loves You, Porgy,\" which became a hit.
