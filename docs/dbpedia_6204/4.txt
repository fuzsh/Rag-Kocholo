Ned L. Pines (1905–1990) was a New York publisher. He died in Paris, and lived in Paris, Manhattan and East Hampton NY. He was married to the former Maxine Firestone, has two daughters, two stepsons, and one granddaughter.

He was president and owner of Pines Publications, which he established in 1928 and remained as president until 1961. Pines published pulp magazines and others under a variety of company names (Better, Standard, Thrilling) from 1936-55. Most collectors refer to the pulp magazines as Thrilling Publications. From 1939 to 56, the company published comic books under a variety of names — most collectors refer to them as Nedor Comics. With the cover dates of May 1949, the comics used the emblem "Standard Comics", switching with the cover date of March 1956 to "Pines Comics," which lasted until 1959.

Pines established paperback book publisher Popular Library in 1942, which used a pine tree as a logo. After the demise of the pulps and comics, this was his main focus. Popular Library existed until the 1970s, when it merged with Fawcett.
