        "text": "Reforestation cost-share funds are limited in many ways—some programs only pay for a limited number of acres, some only apply for certain situations, and sometimes the funding is simply insufficient for the number of applicants. Landowners who face this problem need to be aware that the federal and state tax systems provide a way to recover reforestation costs for commercial timber species. A reforestation deduction, amortization, and even a Mississippi tax credit are available to most taxpayers.\n\nTaxpayers in the higher tax brackets may find that these tax incentives reduce costs better than cost-share. Plus, there is no waiting in line to qualify.\n\nFederal Income Tax\n\nCongress has recognized that private landowners need to recover reforestation expenses quickly. The current tax remedy is to allow the landowner to expense (deduct) up to $10,000 each year for the expenses incurred in reforestation. This limit is applied to each qualified timber property (QTP), not to each taxpayer. Any amount over $10,000 is amortized, or deducted over 84 months, using a specific formula.\n\nThese special provisions relate only to landowners growing commercial timber species. Landscaping trees or trees planted for personal use are not deductible under the federal provisions.\n\nLands that are in a trust follow a different rule. These landowners are not allowed to expense the first $10,000. They may amortize the entire amount, however, over the standard 84 months.\n\nAllowable expenses include a wide variety of practices—whatever is reasonable and necessary to create a commercial forest with seedlings that are free to grow. These practices might include clearing land, raking, piling, burning, subsoiling, applying herbicides, bush-hogging, fertilizing, disking, and planting seedlings. Practices should be reasonable, ordinary, and necessary—generally what the forestry industry is willing to invest to establish a forest of commercially valuable species.\n\nLet’s look at an example:\n\nNed and Nellie Rowan wanted to reduce their farming acreage and decided to plant 200 acres of cropland with loblolly pine trees. They applied for cost-share from the Natural Resource Conservation Service and the Mississippi Forestry Commission, but funds were not available. Instead of waiting 1 to 2 years for possible cost-share assistance, the Rowans decided to invest their own money into reforestation and recover costs with federal and state tax incentives.\n\nIn 2017, the Rowans hired a consulting forester to develop a reforestation plan, hire vendors, purchase seedlings, and ensure a quality job. The forester charged 5 percent above actual costs for this service. No site preparation was recommended because the land was still clean following an earlier crop harvest. A vendor agreed to plant 600 trees per acre for a fee of $45 per acre, or $9,000 for 200 acres. The Rowans chose to plant second-generation improved loblolly pine trees at a cost of $63.10 per thousand. To achieve a planting density of 600 per acre, they purchased 120,000 seedlings for $7,572. The total cost in 2017 to the Rowans was $17,400 ($16,572 plus 5 percent for the forester).\n\nThe Rowans considered this 200 acres as one qualified timber property. Therefore, the deduction limit was $10,000 on their federal income tax return. The remainder of $7,400 will be amortized over 84 months, or eight tax returns. The rules state that the first year’s amortization will be treated as if it occurred on July 1—in essence, a half-year’s deduction. A year’s deduction will be taken for the next 6 years. The final half-year’s deduction will be taken in year 8 (Table 1).\n\nTable 1. Using federal tax incentives to recover costs totaling $17,400.\n\nTax incentives\n\nAmortization amount\n\nTax deduction\n\nDeduction in 2017\n\n10,000\n\nAmortization basis\n\n7,400\n\n2017\n\n1/14\n\n529\n\n2018\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2019\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2020\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2021\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2022\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2023\n\n1/7\n\n1,057\n\n2024\n\n1/14\n\n529\n\nEnding basis in account\n\n0\n\nBecause the Rowans are farmers, they will be able to claim reforestation expenses as part of their farming operation on Schedule F, Profit or Loss from Farming. In 2017, the initial deduction of $10,000 and $529 of amortization were reported as “other expenses” (Figure 1). Reforestation expenses are identified as “RFST” on tax forms.\n\nAmortization deductions are first recorded on Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization, Part VI (Figure 2). The reference to Section 194 of the Internal Revenue Code guides the IRS agent handling the return to look up the provision. The amortized amount reported on Form 4562 is then transferred to Schedule F (Figure 1).\n\nAn election or notice is required for the first of these amortization deductions. The Rowans made their election in 2017 on a plain piece of paper, but they could have used Form T: Forest Activities Schedule, Part 4, Reforestation and Timber Stand Activities.\n\nThis election states how much was spent, the date they spent it, practices involved, species of timber planted, and the purpose of growing timber, as follows:\n\nUnder Section 194, we elect to amortize $7,400 of reforestation expenses in Any County, Mississippi. Payment was made on January 27, 2017. The 84-month amortization period begins July 1, 2017. The expenses were for planting improved loblolly pine seedlings for commercial timber production on the tract known as Granny B’s Farm.\n\nFor their 2018 tax return, the amortization deduction will increase to $1,057 as shown in Figure 3. They also will transfer the amortization deduction onto Schedule F (as shown in Figure 1). The Rowans will continue to file the appropriate amortization deduction until they have deducted all their reforestation costs.\n\nOnly farmers should use Schedule F. If the forest is not part of a farming operation, it may be considered either a business or an investment. Business owners would use Schedule C or other appropriate business forms instead of Schedule F. Investors would file their initial deduction and amortization deduction on the front of the 1040 as shown in Figure 4.\n\nInvestors should write in the reforestation deduction on the front of IRS Form 1040 (Figure 4). Write in “RFST” and the deduction on the next-to-last line of the Adjusted Gross Income section on IRS Form 1040.\n\nMississippi Income Tax\n\nMississippi offers a tax credit for new forest establishment. The requirements are somewhat different than those for the federal tax incentives. Only Mississippi taxpayers reforesting Mississippi land they own may claim a credit on Form 80-315. The tax credit allows Mississippi taxpayers to recover up to 50 percent of the cost of qualified expenses.\n\nSince the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit is applied to taxes owed, the taxpayer reduces his or her tax burden by the amount of the tax credit. This credit is much better than a deduction, where the reduction in taxes paid equals the amount of the deduction times the marginal tax rate. For example, a $100 tax credit reduces taxes by $100, but a $100 deduction for a taxpayer in the 25 percent tax bracket reduces taxes by $25.\n\nUsing the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit requires the services of a registered or graduate forester. The forester prepares a simple prescription of reforestation practices, including a map of the area and legal description of the property. This person also signs the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit form to certify that the plan was made and the work was carried out.\n\nConsulting foresters routinely help landowners claim reforestation credit. Their services may be included as part of their duties following a timber sale. Otherwise, services are negotiated for a fee. Other sources of help are foresters who are also vendors who plant seedlings and/or prepare sites for planting. The Mississippi Forestry Commission office also can prepare a plan. The cost is a contract rate, based on the actual cost of providing the service.\n\nThere are other limitations on the use of the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit. Generally, tax credit and cost-share cannot be claimed for the same practice on the same acreage the same year. Both may be used at the same time only when a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income is below the federal income credit level. In 2017, this amount was $50,597 for a married couple filing jointly with two children.\n\nFor land owned by a pass-through entity such as a partnership or an s-corporation, the limits to using the tax credit apply to the pass-through entity level as well as to the investor. Married couples can each have a $10,000 credit if they own land individually and pay for practices on their individually owned properties. If their land is owned jointly, their total limit is $20,000 for the couple. Under the new law, the lifetime limit will be $75,000 per taxpayer.\n\nLet’s see how the Rowans use the MSRTC:\n\nThe Rowans are Mississippi taxpayers planting trees on their property in Mississippi. Therefore, they are eligible to use the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit. Their consulting forester wrote the required plan for the Rowans as part of the total tree planting cost and oversaw the planting of trees.\n\nThe Rowans filled out the cost worksheet for the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit (Form 80-315) as shown in Figure 5. Their consultant signed the form and mailed a copy of the worksheet to the Mississippi Forestry Commission as required.\n\nThe Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit limits the per-acre cost of each practice. These limits are based on cost-share rates and are changed yearly. As a result, the amount eligible for the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit may be less than the actual amount spent. The lesser value is used to compute the 50 percent tax credit. In our example, the Rowans actually spent $17,400, and the allowable upper limit is $19,000 as determined by filling out the worksheet (Figure 5). The Rowans then transferred the lower value to the front of Form 80-315 and took a tax credit of 50 percent of $17,400, or $8,700. This reduced their Mississippi taxes by $8,700. If they are unable to use all the credit now, they will carry it forward until it is totally used.\n\nAfter subtracting the tax credit, the remainder may be claimed as a reforestation deduction or amortization using federal guidelines. The Mississippi State Tax Commission has not rewritten the MSRTC regulations following the changes in federal reforestation tax due to the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act. We have used our best estimate of the way to handle these expenses. Check with your tax advisor for advice based on your particular facts and circumstances.\n\nNet Investment\n\nUsing the federal tax incentives and Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit enables landowners to recover a good portion of their reforestation costs. Each landowner’s actual recovery percentage will vary according to the marginal tax rate of the individual and the amount actually spent. If a landowner has taxable Mississippi income, it may be much more advantageous to use the Mississippi Tax Credit than to obtain cost-share funding for the forest establishment costs.\n\nReturning to our example again:\n\nThe Rowans are in the 25 percent federal marginal tax bracket and the 5 percent Mississippi tax rate. Their total expenses for reforestation were $17,400. Their cash recovery was $13,485 as shown in Table 2.\n\nThe Rowans recovered $11,767, or 67 percent of their investment, in the first year, largely due to the Mississippi Reforestation Tax Credit. At the end of the eighth year, they had recovered $13,485, or just over 77 percent of their investment. Of course, this does not take into account the time value of money, but it still shows a significant reduction in the cost of investing in a new forest.\n\nTable 2. Estimated recovery of reforestation costs by the Rowans using federal and Mississippi tax incentives. A federal marginal tax rate of 25 percent and a 5 percent Mississippi rate are assumed.\n\nYear\n\nFederal tax deduction\n\nValue of deduction (deduction × .25 federal marginal tax rate)\n\nMississippi tax credit\n\nMississippi tax deduction\n\nValue of deduction (deduction × .05 state marginal tax rate)\n\nTotal savings in taxes\n\n2017\n\n10,529\n\n2,632\n\n8,700\n\n8,700\n\n435\n\n11,767\n\n2018\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2019\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2020\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2021\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2022\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2023\n\n1,057\n\n264\n\n264\n\n2024\n\n529\n\n132\n\n132\n\nSavings in taxes\n\n4,350\n\n8,700\n\n435\n\n13,483\n\nSummary\n\nWe encourage landowners to compare tax incentives to cost-share. Your individual facts and circumstances will determine which is best. Tax incentives are very attractive, especially when landowners are placed on waiting lists for cost-share funds. Reforesting now with tax incentives will usually beat waiting 2 or 3 years for cost-share. Waiting for cost-share can increase site preparation costs by allowing weeds and brush to become well-established on the planting or seeding site. It also increases the wait for harvest returns from the new forest, thus reducing overall net returns. Many taxpayers who reforest their property may be pleased to find that their tax incentives could exceed cost-share payments in terms of cost recovery.\n\nInformation Sources\n\nThis publication provides some guidance to landowners who are ready to invest in a new forest without using cost-share. Your individual situation may not be exactly the same as the example used for illustration. In particular, lands held in trusts are not eligible for some of these provisions, and hobby owners are ineligible.
