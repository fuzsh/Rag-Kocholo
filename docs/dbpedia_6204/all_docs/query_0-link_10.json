        "meta_description": "Standard Comics was a comic book imprint of American publisher Ned Pines, who also published pulp magazines under a variety of company names that he also used for the comics. Standard[1] in turn was the parent company of two comic-book lines: Better Publications[2] and Nedor Publishing[3] Collectors and historians sometimes refer to them collectively as &quot;Standard/Better/Nedor&quot;.[4][5]\n\nIn business from 1939 to 1956, Standard was a prolific publisher during the Golden Age of comic books. Its best-known character, initially published under the Better imprint, is the Black Terror. In June 1949, the Better and Nedor imprints were consolidated as the Standard Comics line, with a &quot;Standard Comics&quot; flag-like cover logo. The titles previously had no publisher logo. In 1956, Standard ended and only two titles continued, published by Pines Comics.",
