        "text": "Click images to enlarge.\n\nThe history of Nedor is a long and winding tale, beginning with Thrilling Publications in 1929 by publisher Ned Pines and Pines Publications. By 1943, Thrilling Publications was rebranded as Standard Magazines, and Nedor and Better were each an imprint of Standard, producing books such as Exciting Comics, Wonder Comics and Startling Comics. In 1949, Nedor and Better were combined to form Standard Comics. That line of publishing continued until 1956, when the remaining two Standard titles were combined with the defunct St. John Publications to create Pine Comics. The new line lasted only three years, and its remaining titles were moved to other publishers in 1959.\n\nOver the decades, “Standard/Better/Nedor” characters (as they are commonly referred to) have appeared in comics by AC Comics, America’s Best Comics and Dynamite Entertainment. Some of the names and titles of classic Standard/Better/Nedor properties were later repurposed by Marvel Comics for all-new characters and titles.\n\nAdditional CGC-graded Standard/Better/Nedor highlights in this auction include:"
