The mostly human, but with the big usually black nose? Sometimes dog ears, sometimes human.\n\nAre they Disney exclusive, or has anything like them appeared anywhere else?\n\nPost by Scrooge MacDuck on\n\nThey're not Disney-exclusive, you'll find them in other funny-animals books of the same era, I've observed. Though I think Disney started it. I believe the usual word is that Barks started the trend of the *really* human ones — the ones who have a human skull shape with little to no snout — though I don't know if that's true (certainly the Phantom Blot predates him; but Gottfredson's early dognoses are slightly different, with vertical black noses instead of the more rounded ones Barks normalized).\n\nPost by That Duckfan on\n\nThey're not Disney-exclusive, you'll find them in other funny-animals books of the same era, I've observed.

I believe the usual word is that Barks started the trend of the *really* human ones — the ones who have a human skull shape with little to no snout — though I don't know if that's true (certainly the Phantom Blot predates him; but Gottfredson's early doghouses are slightly different, with vertical black noses instead of the more rounded ones Barks normalized).\n\nTaliaferro is the missing link here, he created dogfaces for the Donald newspaper strip that were anatomically similar to Barks', but kept the Gottfredson Mickey-like faces. The earliest Barks stories also have these dogfaces. Barks begins to experiment with faces that don't have the black contours around face in the stories for OS #29, The Mummy's Ring, and The Hard Loser, but the first *true* dogface would appear in WDC #38 -- Neighbor Jones.\n\nPost by Ramapith on\n\nHere are some dogface characters from Porky Pig Four Color [series II] 16 (1942), drawn by eventual Disney comics artist/editor Carl Buettner. More doglike than Barks' early 1950s characters, but already evolving away from the 1930s bloodhound look—arguably at a similar speed to Disney dogfaces.\n\nHere's a link to Tex Avery's THUGS WITH DIRTY MUGS (1939), a Merrie Melodies cartoon where the entire cast of comedy cops and robbers are dogfaces for no obvious reason—other than that funny animals were generally popular; one looks a little like Detective Casey, and some look more like humans than others.\n\nChoosing dogs as the \"generic\" animal species was clearly a trend at the time, and Warner seems to be as responsible as Disney. Here are BUDDY THE GEE MAN and Avery's THE BLOW-OUT (both 1935) a few years earlier; at this point, Schlesinger was moving into the Porky series from the earlier \"Buddy\" series, whose star was a human; both cartoons include a mixture of humans and animals, but while the animals include cats, cows, frogs, pigs, and hippos, dogs are overwhelmingly the most common.\n\nPost by djnyr on\n\nI think the dognose default setting also has something to do with the fact that it was comparatively easy for artists to draw a human character, then turn him into a \"dog\" by adding a token nose or pair of floppy ears, as opposed to figuring out how to effectively humanize horses or lions or alligators or other more distinctive animals. Most cartoonists, Barks included, had more experience drawing humans than they did drawing anthropomorphic animals, and it must have been a welcome shortcut for them to only have to worry about transposing human expressions onto the \"star\" animal characters instead of spending time on anthropomorphizing each incidental character's appearance and expressions. I admit that, as a kid, I was always a little disappointed with the fact that most of the characters in Duckburg, other than the Ducks themselves, were just thinly disguised humans, and always perked up when an actual animal character appeared--like the bull and bear billionaires that Barks drew into \"The Christmas Cha Cha\" or the owl judge in many Barks stories.\n\nPost by Matilda on\n\nI think the dognose default setting also has something to do with the fact that it was comparatively easy for artists to draw a human character, then turn him into a \"dog\" by adding a token nose or pair of floppy ears, as opposed to figuring out how to effectively humanize horses or lions or alligators or other more distinctive animals.

But I agree, the characters who weren’t just dognose humans stood out. Mr. Birdmind, Lah Deedah, Miss Minemore, the Phantom of Notre Duck: most of my favorite one-shot characters have beaks. In fact, the only Barksian one-shot dognose characters I can think of that I’m deeply fond of are Miss Penny Wise and the guy who blows the alpenhorn in “Donald’s Raucous Role”—and he has such a distinctive design, he doesn’t quite seem like a regular (dognose) human."
