        "text": "The Phantom Detective #132 Audiobook\n\nDeath to a Diplomat\n\nby Robert Wallace\n\nRead by Milton Bagby\n\nForged in war, The Phantom Detective wages a one-man battle on crime! Solving impossible mysteries and delivering his own justice, he is the underworld’s masked nightmare!\n\nThe Phantom Detective steps into a dark maze of mystery to ferret out the evil perpetrators of a grim scheme of death and blackmail when a legate’s murder stirs a roiling brew! Follow the exciting exploits of Richard Curtis Van Loan as he delves into a crime case that baffles a nation!\n\nNed Pines was the man behind a publishing company that went under many names during its existence. Known at different times as Better, Standard, and Thrilling Publications, and also as Nedor during its comic book phase, it’s the company’s tenure as Thrilling that saw the birth of one of Pulp’s greatest heroes, The Phantom Detective! Taking a cue from the success of Street & Smith’s The Shadow magazine, the first such magazine to feature a hero as its title and lead feature, Pines imagined that following suit might prove lucrative for his own endeavor. Putting this intent into action, Thrilling Publications released the first issue of The Phantom Detective magazine in February 1933, just a scant thirty or so days before Street & Smith delivered another soon to be legend, Doc Savage, in his own magazine. Keeping up with both his predecessor and the hero that followed him by a month, The Phantom Detective ran in his own magazine for 170 issues, just behind the other two characters’ achievements. This is due, in part according to some fans and experts, to the plethora of authors Pines possibly intentionally made sure contributed to The Phantom Detective’s stories. Pines’ masked sleuth also set a record the other two did not, his magazine being published, thanks to some scheduling issues along the way, for a total of twenty years!\n\nDeath to a Diplomat was originally published in the October 1945 issue of The Phantom Detective Magazine and is read with pulse pounding intensity by award winning voice actor Milton Bagby.\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nChapter 1: Murder Grants an Interview\n\nChapter 2: Phantom’s Case\n\nChapter 3: No Clues\n\nChapter 4: Birds of a Feather\n\nChapter 5: Framed in Blood\n\nChapter 6: Dinner Party\n\nChapter 7: Turkish Bath\n\nChapter 8: Open Target\n\nChapter 9: Why A Dime A Share?\n\nChapter 10: Snatch\n\nChapter 11: Stranger In Town\n\nChapter 12: Developments\n\nChapter 13: Partners Confer\n\nChapter 14: Talk Or Die!\n\nChapter 15: Iron Ring\n\nChapter 16: The Word\n\nChapter 17: Rendezvous\n\nChapter 18: The Chips Are Down\n\nChapter 19: The Secret Of The Rosita\n\nMilton Bagby is a veteran radio announcer and voiceover specialist who first turned to audiobooks in 2010. Since then, Milton has worked on several hundred audiobook projects and is a 2017 Audie Awards winner, the audiobook industry's highest award. Drawing upon years of stage acting and the occasional bit part in films, Milton uses his experience to create characters that stand out in the ear of the listener.\n\n“I am very much aware that a perfect stranger is going to invest many hours listening to me tell a story. I do my best to give the listener an experience in which the characters in that story come alive and sound real.”\n\nWhen not behind a microphone, Milton is a writer. In addition to the well-received Rick Burkhart crime novels, Milton writes a line of 1950s style pulp stories, and is the author of dozens of magazine articles and two non-fiction books. Milton and his wife live in Nashville."
