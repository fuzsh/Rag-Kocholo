        "text": "Standard Comics was a comic book imprint of American publisher Ned Pines, who also published pulp magazines under a variety of company names that he also used for the comics. Standard[1] in turn was the parent company of two comic-book lines: Better Publications[2] and Nedor Publishing[3] Collectors and historians sometimes refer to them collectively as \"Standard/Better/Nedor\".[4][5]\n\nIn business from 1939 to 1956, Standard was a prolific publisher during the Golden Age of comic books. Its best-known character, initially published under the Better imprint, is the Black Terror. In June 1949, the Better and Nedor imprints were consolidated as the Standard Comics line, with a \"Standard Comics\" flag-like cover logo. The titles previously had no publisher logo. In 1956, Standard ended and only two titles continued, published by Pines Comics.\n\nBeginning in the 1980s, Standard/Better/Nedor characters have been revived by other publishers. Publisher Bill Black used many of them in his 1980s imprint Americomics (later shortened to AC Comics). Many of the female heroes are members of the AC Comics superhero team Femforce.[6] In the 2000s, Standard/Better/Nedor characters have appeared in writer Alan Moore's comic book Tom Strong and its spin-off Terra Obscura. Marvel Comics used the names American Eagle, Grim Reaper, and Wonder Man for its own, different characters.\n\nThe eight-issue comic book miniseries Project Superpowers #0-7 (Jan.-Oct. 2008), published by Dynamite Entertainment,[7] resurrected a number of Golden Age superheroes, including those originally published by Fox Comics and Crestwood Publications, as well as Standard/Better/Nedor, many of which are assumed to be in the public domain but may not be.[8]\n\nTitles[]\n\nMain article: List of Standard Comics publications\n\nSuperheroes[]\n\nAmerican Crusader\n\nAmerican Eagle\n\nBlack Bat\n\nBlack Terror\n\nCaptain Future (not to be confused with the pulp hero)\n\nCavalier\n\nDoc Strange (Tom Strange)\n\nFighting Yank\n\nFour Comrades\n\nThe Ghost (also known as Green Ghost)\n\nGrim Reaper\n\nJudy of the Jungle\n\nKara, the Jungle Princess\n\nLance Lewis, Space Detective\n\nLiberator\n\nLone Eagle\n\nThe Magnet\n\nMajor Mars\n\nMask\n\nMasked Rider\n\nMasked Rider (II)\n\nMechano\n\nMiss Masque\n\nMystico\n\nThe Oracle\n\nPhantom Detective (also not to be confused with the pulp hero)\n\nPhantom Soldier\n\nPrincess Pantha\n\nPyroman\n\nRed Mask\n\nRick Howard, Mystery Rider\n\nScarab\n\nSilver Knight\n\nSpectro\n\nThesson\n\nThe Woman in Red\n\nWonder Man\n\nPines Comics[]\n\nA successor of Nedor Comics, Pines Comics was a short-lived comic book publisher that existed from 1956-59.\n\nTwo titles were continued from Standard Comics, other were picked up from St. John Publications.
