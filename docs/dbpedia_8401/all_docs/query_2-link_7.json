        "text": "Event 1850 The Estonian Age of Awakening begins. The abolition of serfdom and the availability of education to the native Estonian-speaking population leads to the development of an Estonian nationalist movement. Initially, it is a cultural renaissance that bosters Estonian language, literature, theatre, and professional music, which ultimately form an Estonian national identity. 1862 Kalevipoeg (Kalev's Son) is published. The poem by Friedrich Reinhold Kreutzwald is based on Estonian folklore of a giant that appears in folk songs and the nation’s oral history. 1869 The first national song festival is organized. 1890 The Russian Empire imposes a Russification policy. Estonian nationalism intensifies as a result. 1891\n\nPostimees (The Postman) becomes Estonia’s first daily newspaper and quickly gains a wide readership among the country’s intellectuals.\n\n1908 The first cinema opens in Estonia. 1918 The Estonian Declaration of Independence is proclaimed by the elders of the Estonian Provincial Assembly. 1918–1920 The Estonian War of Independence results in a victory for Estonian forces who fight alongside allies from Latvia and the United Kingdom. Estonia proclaims independence from Russia, and a new constitution is drafted for the independent state. 1921 Estonia and the Soviet Union sign the Tartu Peace Treaty. The independent state becomes a parliamentary democracy and a member of the League of Nations. 1934 Parliament is disbanded, following unrest due to the global financial crisis. 1934–1937 Konstantin Päts, who had earlier served as a elected prime minister, organzises a coup d'état with support from the army. He brings stability to the new state that eventually results in a new constitution. 1938 Under the new constitution, Konstantin Päts becomes the first president of Estonia. 1940 Estonia declares neutrality during World War II but is occupied by Russian forces. 1941–1944 German forces take Estonia from the Russians and conscript Estonians into the Nazi German Army. Many Estonians flee overseas to Finland. Some travel as far as the United Kingdom and join the Royal Air Force in their attempts to liberate occupied Estonia. Estonia suffers some of the highest casualties of any nation during the conflict, reducing the population by 25 percent. 1944 As German forces retreat, Russian forces retake Estonia. Estonia is incorporated into the Soviet Union (USSR) as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR). Around 80,000 Estonians flee to Finland to avoid life under the Soviets. Gustav Ernesaks, later considered to be the father of modern Estonian choral music, founds the State Academic Male Chorus (RAM). He directs the chorus for the next 30 years. 1946 The city of Narva is rebuilt as a giant Soviet industrial park. Many thousands of immigrants arrive to work in the region's metal factories and nuclear power plant. 1949 A guerrilla war is fought between the occupying forces and Estonians known as the Forest Brothers, who operate from bases in the vast Estonian coniferous forests. The war is ended by the mass deportation of over 20,000 Estonians to inhospitable areas of the Soviet Union. 1960s Some of the deported Estonians are allowed to return to the country. 1975 To mark the death of Estonian opera singer Georg Ots, the Tallin Music School is named after him. During his career, Ots performs at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow and also delivers Estonian folk songs to Russian audiences. 1980 The sailing regatta for the Moscow Olympic Games is held in Tallin. 1982 Composer and conductor Eduard Tubin dies in Stockholm. Originally an Estonian, he flees the country after the 1944 Soviet occupation. He is credited with introducing Estonian folk music to an international audience. A museum of his work is later opened in Alatskivi Castle, near his Estonian birthplace. 1987 The first open protests against Soviet rule occur on the streets of Estonian cities. 1987–1991\n\nThe Singing Revolution—mass demonstrations that include the spontaneous singing of banned hymns and national songs—takes place simultaneously in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. In one action, called the Baltic Way, more than 2 million people form a 600-kilometer-long (373-mile-long) human chain that stretches through all three countries.\n\n1991 Estonians vote to become independent of the USSR. Independence is granted later in the year. 1992 Mart Laar becomes the first prime minister of the newly independent state. A new currency, the Kroon, is introduced. 1994\n\nThe last units of the Russian army leave the country. Estonia joins NATO.\n\nSeptember. The cruise ship MS Estonia sinks in the Baltic Sea. More than 850 passengers die, making it one of the worst maritime disasters of the 20th century. The tragedy leads to international changes in safety regulations and life raft design.\n\n1998\n\nChanges are made to citizenship laws to encourage the Russian-speaking minority to become Estonian. More than 6,500 Russian children born in Estonia since its 1991 independence become citizens.\n\n21st Century\n\nEvent 2000\n\nVeljo Tormis retires from producing compositions. At the time, he is regarded as one of the greatest living choral composers. During his career, he produces more than 500 choral songs, largely based on Estonian folklore.\n\n2001 Tanel Padar and Dave Benton, together with hip-hop band 2XL, win the Eurovision Song Contest. Estonia becomes the first of the previously occupied Soviet Union countries to win the contest. 2002 Following the previous year’s success, Estonia earns the right to host the Eurovision Song Contest. The event in Tallin is won by Latvia. 2003\n\nAugust. The popular internet-based video chat service called Skype was founded by Estonian developers Zahti Heinla, Priit Kasesalu and Jaan Tallinn, Danish developer Janus Friis, and Sweden's Niklas Zennstrom.\n\n2004\n\nEstonia is admitted into the European Union. In order to reverse a trend of declining population, a law is passed to pay women up to US$1,560 per month—more than double the average monthly wage of US$650—for 15 months to have children.\n\n2005 Estonia and Russia sign a treaty to finalise the border between the two countries. Later in the year, Estonia becomes the first country in the world to use internet voting in a national election. 2007\n\nThe Estonian government passes a law prohibiting the display of monuments glorifying Soviet rule. A Red Army war memorial in Tallinn is removed, despite protests from ethnic Russians living in the country. Ethnic Russians are accused of leading riots in response to the relocation of other Soviet-era war memorials.\n\nSeptember. A cyber attack is launched against the websites of key Estonian institutions, including the parliament, banks, ministries, and the media. International observers regard the event as the most sophisticated cyber attack ever launched against a sovereign state. Estonians blame the Russian government, but it proves impossible to determine the exact source of the attack. The scale of the event causes military organizations around the world to reconsider the importance of network security in modern warfare.\n\n2011\n\nThe euro is adopted as the country's official currency.\n\n2012\n\nThe European Agency for the operational management of large-scale information technology systems in the area of freedom, security, and justice is based is Tallin.\n\n2013\n\nApril. Trade declines over last year, with a 2 percent drop in exports and 3 percent drop in imports, influenced by a decrease in mineral fuels trading.\n\n2014 February.

Other troops are deployed to surrounding Baltic nations as part of a major NATO mission. 2018 A new government is sworn in, led by a party supported by the country's ethnic Russian minority. The coalition reaffirms NATO and EU commitments. 2019\n\nFragments of about 100 Viking swords are discovered in northern Estonia, dating from the middle of the 10th century and the largest find of Viking swords in the country to date.\n\n2020\n\nFebruary 27.
