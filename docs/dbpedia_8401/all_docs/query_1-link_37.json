        "text": "The Estland Labor Commune (the Commune of the Working People of Estonia) — the Soviet Republic in Estonia was proclaimed on November 29 1918 in Narva.\n\nThe Soviet power in Estonia, established on October 26 (November 8) 1917, remained until February 18 1918, when the country was occupied by the German army. On February 24 1918 leaders of the Estonian intelligentsia K. Päts, J. Wilms and K. Konik published a manifesto “On Independence of Estonia”. During the German occupation Soviet order was abolished, while previously expropriated lands were returned to the landowners.\n\nIn the middle November 1918 Germany passed the control over Estonia to the Provisional government headed by Päts. In the end of the month the Red Army was sent to Baltic states aiming to restore the Soviet power.\n\nOn November 22 1918 units of 7th army for the first time attacked Narva, however the assault was repulsed by German troops, which still remained in the city. A week later, on November 28, the Soviet troops managed to capture the city. On November 29 at noon on the Narva Town Hall was raised a red flag and Estonia was proclaimed a sovereign Soviet Socialist Republic called the Estland Labor Commune. It was announced on establishment of the Council of People’s Commissars, whose members were: Anvelt — the Chairman of Commissars and the Military Commissar, Pöögelmann — Commissar for Economic Affairs, Mägi — Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Vallner — Commissar for Public Education, Käspert — Head of the Council’s Affairs. The membership of the organized Council was immediately reported to the Petrograd Council.\n\nOn December 7 1918 the Council of People’s Commissars of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) recognized independence of the Estland Labor Commune.\n\nAt the same time on the whole territory of Estonia with support of the Entente countries (USA and Great Britain) was launched an armed struggle against units of the Red Army. On June 5 1919 the government of the Estland Labor Commune ceased to exist. After a 13-month war against the Soviet Russia (November 28 1918 — January 3 1920) on February 2 1920 the RSFSR and Estonia signed the Peace Treaty of Tartu, which stipulated that the Soviet Russia refused from any claims on Estonia and recognized the Estonian Republic de jure.\n\nLit.: История отечественного государства и права / Под ред.
