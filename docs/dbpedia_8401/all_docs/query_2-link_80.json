        "text": "On March 8, 1920, Russian feminist Aleksandra Kollontai praised International Women's Day demonstrations as “an excellent method of agitation,” a day to draw women into the political sphere and raise their consciousness. For Kollontai, March 8, 1917 was a day never to forget. On that day “Russian women raised the torch of proletarian revolution and set the world on fire. The February revolution marks its beginning from this day.”Footnote 1\n\nMarch 8 would go on to be celebrated in different ways over the next 100 years, but it would not be celebrated as the start of the February Revolution. Of course, one might argue, since March 8, 1917 in Russia was February 23 in Europe (because of the 13-day difference between the two calendars), one might have expected February 23 to be celebrated as the start of the February Revolution. Yet that too was not the case. Instead, during the period of the Russian Civil War, February 23 became Red Army Day. March 8 remained International Women's Day. And March 12, the equivalent of February 27 (Old Style), was decreed as the “Day of the Overthrow of the Autocracy.”\n\nThe leading historians of the February Revolution agree that the start of the strike wave that culminated in the overthrow of the tsar broke out on February 23 with the beginning of the women's strike for peace, bread, and suffrage (for the latter, see Rochelle Ruthchild's article in this issue of Slavic Review).Footnote 2 How then did February 23/March 8 end up not being celebrated as the beginning of the February Revolution?\n\nThe simple answer is that in the summer of 1917 the Provisional Government chose February 27 as “The Day of the Great Russian Revolution,” marking the anniversary of the formation of the Temporary Committee of the State Duma, which evolved into the Provisional Government. On October 29, 1917 the new Bolshevik government included that holiday in its decree “On the Eight-Hour Day,” renaming it “The Day of the Overthrow of the Autocracy.”Footnote 3 On December 10, 1918, they moved it to March 12 since the calendar had been changed by then.Footnote 4\n\nYet March 12 seems to have barely been celebrated. It was listed as an official non-working holiday until 1930 when Stalin cut back all the holidays to just January 1, May 1, and November 7, but there do not seem to have been large-scale celebrations.Footnote 5 On one level this is understandable. The post-1917 rulers of Soviet Russia cast February as a “bourgeois” revolution, the first stage in the Marxist revolution that would install a bourgeois government (the Provisional Government) as a stepping stone to creating a full-fledged socialist revolution. February thus served as merely a prologue to October, the Great Socialist Revolution. By the time of the tenth anniversary on March 12, 1927, Izvestiia’s leading headline read “February—A Step Toward October,” while Pravda on the same day noted “How the Path from February to October was marked.”Footnote 6\n\nIt would also appear, however, that over the course of the early 1920s, the connection between the women's demonstrations on February 23/March 8 and the February Revolution was actively undermined. Women's activism on that day was consistently demoted as “backward,” “unskilled,” and “spontaneous”; after all, the Bolshevik V. N. Kaiurov had tried to persuade them not to take to the streets. Yet this cannot be the whole story since Tsuyoshi Hasegawa has given evidence that women textile workers were the only ones able to sustain an entire month-long strike in January–February 1917.Footnote 7 The bigger picture is one of gender politics and gender relations. As Choi Chatterjee has argued, the two main parts of the revolutionary year 1917, the February and October Revolutions were, from early in Soviet history, themselves cast as “feminine” and “masculine” respectively, with the second valorized at the expense of the first.Footnote 8\n\nOver time the new Soviet authorities gradually came to celebrate two different holidays at the same time as the February Revolution: the holidays of February 23 (Red Army Day) and March 8 (International Women's Day). The celebration of these two holidays in turn fostered an understanding of binary spheres of activism. Red Army Day celebrated soldiers, ostensibly male and female, but over time became increasingly recognized as “men's day.” International Women's Day (or The Day of Women Workers, Den΄ rabotnits) celebrated, at least initially, women's emancipation and their entry into full Soviet citizenship. Ostensibly men and women were equal. By the 1970s the holidays had evolved so that on February 23 women gave presents to men, especially those in the military and their fathers, while on March 8 men gave flowers and chocolates to women, especially teachers and mothers. On the one hand, this would appear to mark a nice symmetry of two rather anodyne holidays.\n\nIn fact, however, I would argue that this bifurcation of two holidays reinforced a prerevolutionary gender binary that was antithetical to the stated goals of gender equality. The creators of these two holidays were sending a gender message of supposed parity–two holidays for two sexes—that actually served to reify gender differences and naturalize them rather than eliminating or undermining them. Because of the conversion of the calendar (which Russians still recognize today in celebrating New Year's Day on both January 1 and January 14), these two holidays would have been widely recognized in the early decades as de facto the same day. Thus on two equivalent days, one holiday evolved to recognize men's (and theoretically women's) participation in the military and another to recognize women's participation in the home.\n\nIn general, holidays provide a key window on social values, both the official ones being promulgated by the authorities (both central and local), and also the ones that are actually accepted and promoted by the general population. Holidays provide an ordering of the year and they create a sense of community and common emotions.Footnote 9 They demonstrate who holds the authority to create the holidays in the first place, and who does not. They highlight what is to be remembered and what is to be forgotten or glossed over.Footnote 10\n\nIn the case of the holidays of February 23 and March 8, it seems significant that both of them emerged as holidays that gave gifts. In Thank You, Comrade Stalin, Jeffrey Brooks has argued that much of Soviet propaganda was organized around what he calls the “economy of the gift,” in which the authorities (especially Stalin, but the state as well) were seen to give gifts (both material and structural, even metaphysical, such as the possibility of happiness), while the population was expected to (and did) make a show of gratitude.Footnote 11 Much of this evolved in the 1930s, but as we shall see, the holiday of February 23 first emerged as “the Day of the Red Present” in 1918, so more research needs to be done on this.\n\nHolidays also reinforce gender norms. Who gives presents to whom; who is celebrated; where does the celebration take place—these are all questions of social construction. Gender is then imbibed by the population not just by the official ideology (in the Soviet case an ideology of emancipation and mobilization into the public sphere) but also by practice: the practice of giving women flowers and giving boys and men tanks and vodka."
