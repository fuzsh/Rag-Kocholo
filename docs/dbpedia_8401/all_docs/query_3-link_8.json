        "text": "The Danes and Germans were not the only ones. The Swedes also wanted a piece of the cake, and mainly settled in coastal areas (there are still some small places where street signs are both in Estonian and in Swedish!). It was the Swedes who, after the Reformation, spread Lutheranism in Estonia and Livonia (and if you meet religious Estonians today, they are most likely Lutherans).\n\nTo make everything even more complicated, part of Livonia belonged to Poland. In the Livonian War (1558-1583), Russian czar Ivan IV tried to conquer Livonia, but lost it to Sweden and Poland. From 1629 to 1917, the division Livonia (Northern Latvia and Southern Estonia, under Polish rule) and Estonia (Northern Estonia, first under Swedish rule), remained.\n\nThe Swedish era is sometimes referred to as “Golden era”, as the Swedes promoted autonomy and education of the Estonian peasants. It was Swedish King Gustav II Adolphus who established the University of Tartu in 1632. The Germans, or rather, Baltic Germans, managed to keep their powerful positions throughout the centuries: while Estonians were mainly peasants and servants, the Baltic Germans lived in mansions, made a lot of money, and kept German as official language of the Tallinn government until 1889.\n\nAfter the Swedes came the Russians, who won Estonia and Livonia in the Great Northern war (1700-1721). Estonia was part of the Russian Empire from 1710, but still, the Baltic Germans remained the upper class. Estonians were enslaved until 1816 (Estonian part) and 1819 (Livonian part). Starting in the 1850s, and this was even supported by some of the Baltic Germans (the Estophiles), a “cultural awakening” took place, and the Estonian language became more than the language of the uneducated peasants – now, there was Estonian literature, Estonian poetry, Estonian newspapers. The Russian revolution (1905) was a hit to Russian czarist power, an Estonian congress was built, and in 1917, Estonia became a nation. A provisional parliament (Maapäeav) was organized, and Estonia and Livonia were unified to resemble Estonia as we know it today. The Estonian Declaration of Independence was issued on February 23, 1918. Estonia was a free republic. Finally. The day after that is what we nowadays celebrate as Independence Day. A War of Independence followed, but on February 2, 1920, The Tartu Peace Treaty was signed, and Russia had to officially recognize Estonia as a sovereign state. Another day to celebrate.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPhoto credit: Andrus Reinmann\n\n​\n\nThe first period of independence lasted only 22 years, but is so full of chaos that I can’t really get into it now. Establishing a government after centuries of foreign rule is not easy. Konstantin Päts, who had been the Prime Minister of the Maapäev (and is thus known as Estonia’s first prime minister) became head of state in 1934 and started an authoritarian rule known as the Era of Silence (1934-1940). Then, in the Second World War, Soviets and Germans gained power of Estonia multiple times, thousands of Estonians were deported to concentration camps by the German Nazis and to Siberia by the Soviets. In July 1949, Estonia became a Soviet Socialist Republic and became part of the Soviet Union. Estonians were executed and deported by the Soviet Regime, a reign of terror started. Two big waves of deportations to Siberia, in June 1941 (about 10,000 Estonians were removed from their homes and families), after which the Germans took control again for three years, deporting Estonian Jews; and, after the Soviets got their power back, in March 1949, where over 20.000 Estonians were deported to Siberia.\n\nThe Baltic Germans finally left, as did the remaining Swedes, and a significant number of Russians were relocated to Estonia. During the Soviet times, there were things people could not decide freely, some where just told where to move and many were afraid of getting deported. Russian became the official language; Estonian culture, celebrations, and songs were prohibited. The panel building blocks of five or nine storeys that even now, the majority of the Estonian population lives in, were built in the Soviet times. But in the 1980s, the Estonians started to regain power. Political parties were founded, protests took place, and in 1988, the so-called Singing Revolution (yes, songs in Estonian language were sung in public again!) lead to the Declaration of Sovereignty. On August 23, 1989, the Baltic citizens built a human chain from Tallinn via Riga to Vilnius. After some more turmoil, Estonia declared its Independence on August 20, 1991 – which is now celebrated as the Day of Restoration of Independence. A new government was established (Riigikogu), and a new currency was introduced: the Eesti kroon (Estonian crone). It took until 1994 that the last Russian forces left Estonia. Now, the Estonians could show their true power and resilience: emerging from an economic crisis and a long history of occupations, the young nation became known as the Baltic Tiger, the European Silicon Valley, became a member of the EU in 2004 and joined the Eurozone in 2011.\n\nThe relationship with Russia and with the Russians living in Estonia remains complicated, tense. Other former Soviet countries are viewed as brothers and sisters.\n\nThe Estonian people are used to being oppressed by foreign forces, they are used to helping each other out, and they highly value their culture, their folk songs and flag that were forbidden for so long. What to do with a person who was born in the Soviet Union and suddenly found themselves in Estonia, being regarded as Russian, but not knowing any other home than the city of Narva? How to handle the Soviet heritage?\n\nThere are many questions I cannot answer. But this Independence Day, it is clear that Estonia will condemn Russia for the war, the war crimes. Estonia stands with Ukraine. And Estonia proudly raises the Estonian flag.\n\nAnd we, as international students, should keep in mind this turbulent history of Estonia that explains why Estonians sometimes like to stick to themselves, and take some time before trusting others. And if we have a chance to stand among Estonians when they sing songs like “Ta lendab mesipuu poole” (“He is flying to the beehive”), or “Koit” (“Dawn”), or “Mu isamaa on minu arm” (“My fatherland is my love”) and cry tears of all the emotions, we should raise our Estonian flag, too, and be carried with those emotions."
