        "text": "For Estonia the First World War ended with the War of Independence (1918–20) and the Tartu Peace Treaty of 2 February 1920, under which Russia recognized Estonian independence. Like many other European states, Estonia inherited a ruined economy, disrupted social relations and political uncertainty from the war. Before the war Estonia had been one of the most developed regions of Imperial Russia. It had a solid industrial base which included machine-building, cellulose, paper and textile industries. Metal-working had also developed in the prewar industrial period of growth. The production capacity of these industries widely exceeded the needs of the local market. Tallinn was a Russian naval fortress and in 1912–15 three shipyards and shipyard plants had been built there. This industrial growth created a demand for extra labour which was met by immigration from Russia. This changed the ethnic composition of the Tallinn population, and would have an influence on events during the revolutionary year 1917."
