        "text": "98%of companies are established online\n\nAccording to the Commercial Code, there are five forms of business entities in Estonia:\n\nprivate limited company (OÜ)\n\npublic limited company (AS)\n\ngeneral partnership (TÜ)\n\nlimited partnership (UÜ)\n\ncommercial association (ühistu)\n\nIn addition to the possibility of establishing a business entity, any natural person can conduct business as a sole proprietor (FIE) who must be entered into the Central Commercial Register before commencing with permanent business activity.\n\nForeign companies can also offer their goods or services by establishing a branch. The branch must be registered in the Estonian Commercial Registry by submitting an application and other required documentation. It should be considered that a branch is not a business entity and the foreign enterprise is liable for obligations arising from the activities of the branch.\n\nA non-profit organization (NPO) is a voluntary association of persons founded for the fulfilment of purposes established in its articles of association. A non-profit association is governed collectively, its management bodies are the general meeting of members, and the management board is elected at a general meeting. The activity of a non-profit association is regulated by the Non-profit Associations Act.\n\nEstonia’s most common forms of business entities are a private limited company (OÜ) and a public limited company (AS). Detailed information about other company types is available in the Commercial Code.\n\n15 minto start a company*\n\nHolders of an Estonian ID card or e-Residency card and a growing number of holders of EU member states’ ID cards can establish a private limited company fully online. If an ID or e-Residency card is not available, a visit to a notary in Estonia is needed to verify the foundation documents.\n\nEstablishing a private limited company is as easy as ABC:\n\nChoose a name for your business and check that it is available. To check the availability, use the free tool on the website of the e-Business Register.\n\nIf you do not have an Estonian address, contact a business service provider to obtain a legal address.\n\nRegister the company online at the company registration portal. You can pay the state fee (265 €) and share capital through the state portal when you submit your application, or choose to defer the share capital payment.\n\nReceive confirmation. Your submitted application will be reviewed in up to one working day and any notifications will be sent by e-mail.\n\nIf / when your company has employees, register the employees in the employment register on the website of the Tax and Customs Board.\n\nIf the area of activity is subject to special requirements, a license has to be acquired. Information on the areas of activity and electronic registration can be founded on the website of the Register of Economic Activities.\n\nIf needed, the company should be registered as a VAT payer on the website of the Tax and Customs Board.\n\nYou will have to register the company through a notary if:\n\nthe contribution of the company’s share capital is not monetary but rather a monetarily appreciable thing or proprietary right to be transferred to the private limited company (such as equipment, software, etc.);\n\nthe founders of the company cannot digitally sign documents.\n\nRemote authentication and facial recognition\n\nRemote authentication enables the conduct of notarial acts via a video bridge created between the notary and the customer. Such authentication is equivalent to authentication at a notary’s office. Remote authentication is an opportunity, not an obligation.\n\nIn order to conduct an act by using remote authentication and be given the relevant advice, you should first contact a notary’s office. You can also carry out the required act via the self-service portal of the Chamber of Notaries at iseteenindus.notar.ee (EE). A Republic of Estonia ID card, digital ID, mobile ID, or e-Residency card can be used to log in to the portal and to sign documents to be authenticated.\n\nAt the same time, it is possible to establish a company in Estonia by authorizing a representative abroad who can come to a notary in Estonia, or if the representative has a digital identity card issued by the Republic of Estonia, he or she can establish the company via remote authentication.\n\nThough the process is fairly simple, there are also several private companies that can help you through all the steps. A list of companies offering company registration services is available here. If using e-Residency, you can also turn to a more specific step-by-step guide aimed at e-Residency users.\n\n* the actual registration times may vary. When registering with the help of a notary, a delay of up to 3 days is expected and a notary fee has to be paid.\n\n98%of tax declarations are filed online\n\nAt the end of each financial year, an accounting entity is required to prepare an annual report that consists of the annual accounts and the management report. The auditor’s report (if compulsory) and the profit distribution proposal for the financial year should be annexed to the annual report. The financial statements have to be audited for all public limited companies and foundations. All 350+ certified auditors are members of the Board of Auditors.\n\nAnnual report should be filed at the Commercial Register within six months after the end of the financial year.\n\nAlmost all Estonian companies can choose whether to prepare their consolidated and annual accounts in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards or in accordance with the Estonian accounting standards.\n\ne-Financials is a simple web-based accounting software that assists companies to manage their book-keeping themselves. The software is located in the Company Registration Portal and both entrepreneurs and authorized persons (e.g. accountants) can use it.\n\nYou can read more about tax requirements here."
