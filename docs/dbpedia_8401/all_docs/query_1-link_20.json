        "text": "Repair Train No. 3\n\nRailways had a key role in the Estonian War of Independence 1918 – 1920, their effective management gave Estonian forces a decisive advantage over their Russian Bolshevik and German enemies. At the outset of the War of Independence, the newly organized Republic of Estonia railways was put under the operational control of the Estonian General Staff, but it remained under civil administration and was operated by civilians. The Estonians were fortunate to have a good number of experienced railway men in leadership positions and a force of skilled employees. Karl Ipsberg, a civil engineer by education, served as the Director of Railways at the time. In December 1918, as Estonian forces fell back initial stage of the war, the matter for concern was finding housing in Tallinn for railway employees fled with the forces falling back and whose homes were in territories occupied by the Bolsheviks. As this was being organized, Julius Trubock of the railway administration provided great service in organizing technical services for the Estonian army’s armored trains. Working in cooperation of Captain Johan Pitka of the Defence League Ipsberg and Trubock oversaw the improvisation and innovation armored trains in the Tallinn's workshops.\n\nArmored Train\n\nIn January 1919, Estonian forces on the offensive and railways were restored as troops moved forward. This restoration accomplished quickly in spite of difficult circumstances. Estonian troops liberated Tartu on 14 January, only four days later, on 18 January 1919; the first passenger train arrived from Tallinn to Tartu again. On 19 January Estonian forces liberated Narva and beginning on 24 January the Tallinn – Narva railway line was again moving passengers. On the southern front, the Estonian army’s offensive 1 - 4 February, liberated Valga, Võru, and Petseri. On the Tallinn-Valga-Petseri lines, the railway administration restored civil railway movements on 12 February. During the duration of the War of Independence the Estonia railways were continuously extensively engaged in military movements – personnel, troops, and supplies, however, was still able to maintain a provisional civil passenger schedule and other non – military movements to keep civil society functioning and the economic support to the war effort continuing without interruption. The Railway Administration also built for the Estonian Red Cross several of hospital cars and an entire sauna train for disinfection and bathing for troops at the front. The Red Cross organized hospitals in Tartu, Narva, Jõhvi and Rakvere receiving wounded from specially equipped hospital trains.\n\nPhoto: Sauna Train - Heating Car\n\nPhoto: Hospital Train\n\nIn February 1919 as the red forces were driven out of Estonia and the frontlines moved into Latvia and Russia a railway organization plan based on modern practices was firmly taking root and an inventory of equipment was completed on 1 March 1919. The results showed that the Estonian broad-gauge lines had 90 locomotives and 3,015 pieces of rolling stock in operational condition. Under repair were less than broad gauge 30 locomotives and roughly 1,400 cars. Directly committed to Ministry of War were 13 locomotives and 500 cars. The narrow-gauge system in west and southwest of Estonian had operational approximately 64 locomotives and 1,500 cars and had 17 locomotives and 650 cars under repair.\n\nBy the February 1919, the cumbersome organizational model inherited from the Russian Imperial Railways was replaced by one used in western countries, notably in North America, pioneered by Daniel Craig McCallum, a self-taught architect and civil engineer, who and became the general superintendent of the Erie Railroad in 1854. While many aspects of decision making were decentralized, lines of authority were sharped and information flow in the organization was increased both in volume and velocity. With the outbreak of the American Civil War, McCallum was appointed director of the United States Military Railroads (USMRR) on February 4, 1862, and eventually given the rank of brigadier general. Subordinate to USMRR was Construction Corps which was in charge of bridge and railway construction. Railways were new to military logistics and their effective management under McCallum provided a decisive advantage to northern forces.\n\nAs with the north in the American Civil War, effective management of railways provided Estonian forces a decisive advantage over their adversaries, who often outnumbered. The Estonian could quickly shift forces and mass firepower where needed. Well-equipped hospital trains and the sauna train strengthened the morale and resiliency of the Estonian forces. With the railways operating effectively the civilian economy could be most fully harnessed to support the war effort and the ability of ready movement of goods and people and the open flow of information maintained civilian morale as well.\n\nPhoto: Rail operations in 1919\n\nWith successful conclusion of the war with the Treaty of Tartu on 2 February 1920, “at peace after nearly six years of warfare, the Estonians began the work of reconstruction” as British publication notes in 1935, “the development of Estonian railways has proceeded methodically and without interruption since the formation of the Republic. After years of warfare the Estonians were faced with the grim necessity of evolving a modern railway system from the ruins of the old…Estonian railways, and speed, judged by West European standards, is not high, railway travel is comfortable as well as inexpensive.”[1] Although operated by the state, as according to British and American observers in the mid-1930s, the state railway generated revenue for the national treasury and served as an engine of national development moving oil shale and distilled oil and petroleum, timber, flax, beer and vodka, fish, livestock, pulp, plywood, fertilizers, machinery, and peat.[2]\n\nPhoto: Timber moves by Rail 1935 - Estonian State Archives\n\nPhoto: Refrigerator Cars at the Saku Brewery\n\nEffective management was key to the utility of the railways, as a British observer in 1935, noted of the Estonian State Railways, as well as the state railways of Latvia and Lithuania, “the railways of these Baltic countries are not spectacular in the matter of speed and ultra-modernity of equipment; but such things are in the nature of luxuries enjoyed by the larger and more powerful industrialized countries such as Great Britain, France, and Germany. ln their limited sphere the Baltic railways do their work well and efficiently. Instead, therefore, of making invidious comparisons between them and the big systems of Western Europe, we should rather applaud, and indeed wonder at, the magnificent way in which their respective administrations have evolved complete order out of the chaos caused by the Russian retreat, the pre-war Russian methods, and the sad disintegration caused by war conditions. To evolve complete national railway systems out of the cast-off strategic railways of Tsarist Russia was a task difficult of accomplishment.”[3] Effective railway management not only was critical in winning independence but helped to bring national prosperity in the years following the independence war.\n\nPhoto: Soomusrong nr 7 Wabadus - Armored Train Nr. 7 \"Freedom\" - touring Estonia in 2019 for 100 Year commemoration of Independence War battles\n\n[1] “Estonia and Lithuania,” Railway Wonders of the World No. 22 (1935): 42\n\n[2] John S. Steele, “The Land Where Everyone Works,” Chicago Daily Tribune (August 2, 1936) – According to Steele, in 1936, the railways brought 12,000,000 kroons in profit to the Estonian state – while customs brought 18,000,000 kroons, the state spirits (vodka) monopoly with 13,000,000 and postal telegraph and telephone service 5,000,000 kroons Only 3,000,000 kroons was raised by income tax, which began at 5 per cent and rose to about 9 per cent on the largest incomes. The Estonian government operated with a balanced budget. In 1936 approximately 3.5 Eesti Kroon = 1 US Dollar\n\n[3] “Estonia and Lithuania,” 42"
