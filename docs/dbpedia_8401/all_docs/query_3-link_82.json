        "text": "CHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nWinters in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, can be long and cold. But it's hardly a place frozen in time. In fact, in less than 30 years, Estonia has gone from being an impoverished member of the Soviet Union to one of the most technically advanced countries in the world. It's the first country to declare the internet a social right. The government claims high-speed broadband covers 88% percent of the country and 99% of its services are easily accessible online.\n\nANNA PIPERAL:\n\nA country where you can do your taxes in three minutes. Where you can vote online from anywhere in the world and it's still secure and safe.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nThe key to it all? One card. It's a digital ID with encrypted files used together with a pin code. 94% of Estonians have a digital ID like this one.\n\nANNA PIPERAL:\n\nFirst of all I have to plug in my ID card in order to log into the state portal which will be a one stop shop for different services.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nTaxes too are done online. The government fills in all the forms with information as reported to it. Taxpayers just need to review and approve. Two clicks, and within three minutes in most cases, taxes are done!\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nEverything is confirmed instantly using your ID card and pin code to create what amounts to a \"digital\" signature. It's a series of numbers with a timestamp. Estonia is serious about cyber security. A main way it protects digital information is with technology called Blockchain. It's a way of decentralizing and authenticating data to prevent hacking. It's most famously used by the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin. Estonia is the first country to use it on a national level.\n\nANNA PIPERAL:\n\nPotentially it could but when the data is correct and you only have correct data in one place and everyone is responsible for keeping their data correct then it's much easier.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nAt Lift 99, where entrepreneurs can rent office space and network, we met American Yuriy Mikitchenko. He moved from Oregon to Estonia for love, his fiance is Estonian, but he's also quite smitten with how the government encourages business.\n\nYURIY MIKITCHENKO:\n\nTechnology, for sure makes it's easier to do business here. I can send an invoice digitally and get a bank transfer immediately. No signing checks. No cutting actual checks. People here laugh at the idea of checks.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nTo appreciate how far Estonia has come, it's important to look back to when Estonia was part of the Soviet Union. We got a chance to do just that visiting the repository of Estonia's Museum of Occupations with director Merilin Piipuu.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nEstonia was part of the communist USSR from 1944 to 1991. By the time it gained its freedom about 20 percent of Americans were already using personal computers, but here in Estonia there were virtually no computers.\n\nMERILIN PIIPUU:\n\nTypewriters were the last thing. We didn't have the first computers. And when we talk about connections and you know, mobile phones we didn't know anything about. We still had the basic landlines and even the landlines were always overheard. People were always like, surveillance was the thing.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nWhen the country broke away from the USSR, Estonians had to build their new country from scratch. That meant they could take advantage of something that was brand new then, the Internet. Within a few years Estonians jumped from typewriters to the latest web-connected computers.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nDr Robert Krimmer is a Professor in the School of Business and Governance at the Tallinn University of Technology and an expert on what has come to be know as e-government. He says necessity was the mother of invention in this tiny country.\n\nDR. ROBERT KRIMMER:\n\nThere is not enough humans that can do all the jobs and there is just not enough money to pay for all the services if you have to do it the traditional way on paper so Estonia didn't have a choice, right? It decided information technology is the one thing that helps the country organize itself.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nHearing how much people trust their online government services, one might get the impression that the entire shift to becoming an e-society was a breeze. It wasn't. In fact, Estonia faced a major crisis in 2007 when it became the first country to experience a massive cyber attack which took down Estonia's email, bank, and newspaper servers.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nBut who was behind it? It's widely believed to be connected to this Soviet-era statue. In April, 2007 the Estonian government moved it from the center of Tallinn to this military cemetery in the outskirts. Pro-Russian Estonians saw this as an insult. They took part in violent protests at the exact same time the cyber attack overwhelmed the country's servers. Many here thought that was no coincidence.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nWhile Piperal acknowledges it has never been confirmed that the Russians were behind the attack, she suspects they were aiming to undermine Estonians' trust in their government. Instead the country came together. The government went public describing the attack and the steps it was taking to thwart it. The next year the Cooperative Cyber Defense Centre of Excellence, a multi-nationally funded think tank, opened in Tallinn. Here they train military and civilian experts from 21 countries how to protect against cyber-attacks on government systems, banks, and utilities. Merle Maigre, its director, says the crisis actually increased people's trust in the government.\n\nANNA PIPERAL:\n\nWe can't stop the cyber-attacks. It's like, the number is increasing, but what we can is detect them as soon as possible, meaning the next second, so we can prevent the bigger damage.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nAs yet another line of defense against cyber-attack, the country is creating a backup system, what they call \"digital embassies\" in which Estonia stores a backup copy of all its digital assets in another country. The first one was established in Luxembourg last June.\n\nANNA PIPERAL:\n\nWe would like a bigger kind of network of digital embassies where we can put our data and, of course, using blockchain with it for integrity purposes so if anything happens to Estonia, if anyone attacks Estonia the government will not lose any data or control over data, and they could service people even if we are not in the country.\n\nCHRISTOPHER LIVESAY:\n\nAnd the next step for this small country is to expand beyond its borders by offering what it calls E-residency to everyone in the world. It's a program meant to attract entrepreneurs. Pay a fee of about 120 dollars, pass a background check, and Estonia issues you a digital ID which you can use to establish a company in Estonia making it easier to access the EU market.\n\nARNAUD CASTAIGNET:\n\nYou can create a legitimate European business without actually coming to Estonia nor coming to the EU within a few hours and you have access to all the e-services from Estonia."
