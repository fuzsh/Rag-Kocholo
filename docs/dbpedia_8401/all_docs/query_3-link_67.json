        "text": "Brazil recognized Estonia's independence in 1921, having voted in favor of its admission to the League of Nations even before formal recognition. With the dissolution of the USSR, the Estonian Parliament passed, in August 1991, a resolution whereby Estonia regained its de facto independence and reiterated the continuity of the state since 1918. Brazil recognized the effects of this declaration in September 1991, reestablishing full diplomatic relations in December of the same year.\n\nThe Brazilian Embassy in Tallinn was opened in 2011. Brazil and Estonia maintain a fluid political dialogue, which translates into visits and reciprocal support for candidacies in multilateral forums.\n\nIn 2019 trade between the two countries amounted to $ 38.8 million. Brazilian exports totaled $ 18.4 million and imports, $ 20.4 million. Almost half of Brazilian exports consisted of iron ore, while 42% of imports were electric machinery.\n\nCooperation in information and communication technologies (ICT) is a promising aspect of the bilateral relationship, as Estonia is a highly computerized country and a pioneer in the use of e-government. In 2019, a significant number of public and private Brazilian delegations visited Estonia to learn about the experiences of the digital society in e-government, systems integration, defense and cyber security, as well as in the education sector.\n\nIt is estimated that around 200 Brazilians live in the country. In 2016, the Council of Brazilian Citizens in Estonia was founded. In 2018, the Honorary Consulate of Brazil was established in Keila-Joa, on the outskirts of Tallinn.\n\nChronology of bilateral relations\n\n2014 – Opening of the Embassy of Estonia in Brasília, on the occasion of the visit of the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Urmas Paet\n\n2011 – Opening of the Embassy of Brazil in Talin\n\n2008 – The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Estonia, Urmas Paet, visits Brasilia\n\n2006 – The Agreements on Tourism Cooperation and on Educational Cooperation come into force\n\n1991 – Brazil and Estonia establish full diplomatic relations\n\n1940 – Incorporation of Estonia into the USSR"
