The pilots were knighted for this achievement.\n\nBack to the top ↑\n\nWomen’s Suffrage\n\nOn 18th August 1920, the 19th Amendment to the US Constitution allowed American women the right to vote, after nearly 100 years of protest. To find out more about women’s suffrage in other countries, take a look at our women’s suffrage timeline.\n\nUntil 1848, the movement for women’s suffrage wasn’t organised at national level. In July of 1848, Elizabeth Stanton and Lucretia Mott organised the first women’s rights convention in New York, and more than 300 men and women attended.\n\nDue to the outbreak of the Civil War, the movement lost momentum as women had to assist the efforts related to the conflict that was happening. After many years of protesting, the outcome looked bleak after many states voted to not amend the 19th Amendment. Southern states were the states that were mainly opposed to the amendment, and seven had already voted to reject it before Tennessee’s vote on 18th August 1920. Tennessee held the vote to tip the scale for women’s suffrage. The state’s decision came down to Harry T. Burn, a 23 year old Republican from McMinn County. Burn opposed the amendment, however his mother convinced him to vote for the cause by writing a letter to him, including “Don’t forget to be a good boy.” On 26th August 1920, the 19th Amendment was approved by US Secretary of State, Bainbridge Colby. On 2nd November, more than 8 million women across the United States voted in elections for the very first time. The last state to ratify the 19th Amendment was Mississippi, approving it on 22nd March 1984.\n\nBack to the top ↑"
