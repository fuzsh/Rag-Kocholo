        "text": "The Treaty of Tartu is written in Estonian and Russian, registered with the League of Nations and published with a French and English translation in Volume XI of the League of Nations Treaty Series in 1922.\n\nThe treaty comprises 20 articles and in addition to ending the state of war it also includs articles on the recognition of the Estonian state, covering border, security, economic, social and traffic policies.\n\nAs a result of the negotiations, hostilities actually ceased before the treaty was signed. Guns fell silent on 3 January at 10.30, when the truce between Estonia and the Soviet Union, signed on 31 December 1919, took effect. To demonstrate the importance of this day and to honour those who fought for Estonia’s freedom, a day of remembrance was introduced on 3 January to commemorate those who fought in the War of Independence.\n\nAccording to the treaty, Russia recognised Estonian independence de jure, renouncing voluntarily “for ever all rights of sovereignty formerly held by Russia over the Esthonian people and territory”. The Treaty of Tartu was also the first international act recognising the Soviet government. Diplomatic relations were established between the two states.\n\nEstonia was freed from all obligations towards Russia, while Russia was obligated to return the property that had been evacuated from Estonia; Estonia was also granted 15 million gold roubles from the Russian gold fund.\n\nAccording to the treaty, every Estonian living in Russia had the right to move to Estonia. Based on the treaty, 38000 Estonians opted for Estonian nationality (at the end of the War of Independence, there were about 320 Estonian settlements or centres and around 190 000 Estonians in Russia).\n\nOn the Estonian side, the treaty was signed by members of the Constituent Assembly Jaan Poska, Ants Piip, Julius Seljamaa, Mait Püüman and Major-General Jaan Soots. The signatories on the Russian side were Adolph Joffe, member of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet of Workmen, Peasants, Soldiers of the Red Army and Cossacks, and Isidore Gukovsky, member of the College of the Popular Commissariat of State Control.\n\nEstonia’s peace treaty with Russia was the first international act that mentioned the right of peoples to decide their own destiny. Therefore, both the Treaty of Tartu as well as other treaties between Russia and its western neighbours that were modelled on it constituted an important step towards enshrining the nations’ right to self-determination in international law.\n\nAlthough we had de facto diplomatic relations with many countries before the Tartu Peace Treaty, it was only after it was concluded that Estonia could assume its position in the international community. The signing of the Tartu Peace Treaty on 2 February 1920 and the end of the War of Independence opened the way for the international recognition of Estonia as an independent state."
