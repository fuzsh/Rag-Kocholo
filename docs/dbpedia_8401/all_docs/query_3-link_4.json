In the 11th and 12th centuries, the Danes and the Swedes tried to Christianize the Estonians, without success.

His successor, Berthold of Hanover, appointed bishop of Livonia, decided that the sword had to be used against the recalcitrant pagans. He was killed in 1198 in battle. Albert of Buxhoevden, who succeeded him as bishop, proved himself a shrewd colonizer, pacifying the “treacherous Livs” and forcing them to build the fortress of Riga. To popularize recruitment for his army, Albert dedicated Livonia to the Virgin Mary. In 1202 he established the Order of the Brothers of the Sword.\n\nRecent News\n\nAug. 16, 2024, 10:07 AM ET (Janes)\n\nUK deploys Watchkeeper to Estonia for training\n\nAug. 14, 2024, 4:06 AM ET (Newsweek)\n\nChina Admits Container Ship Damaged Baltic Sea Gas Pipeline\n\nAug. 12, 2024, 9:41 AM ET (South China Morning Post)\n\nBeijing admits Chinese ship destroyed key Baltic gas pipeline ‘by accident’\n\nAug. 2, 2024, 5:57 AM ET (The Guardian)\n\nUkraine war briefing: Turkey launches new Ukrainian warship\n\nJuly 23, 2024, 5:28 AM ET (Washington Post)\n\nEstonia's new government is formally appointed. Its first priority is to improve state finances\n\nBy 1208 the knights were firmly established on both banks of the Western Dvina (Daugava) River, and Albert felt strong enough to proceed northward to the conquest of Estonia. In the following years, the Estonians decreased steadily in manpower, while the knights replenished theirs with new Crusaders from Germany. The Russian princes of Novgorod and Pskov also raided Estonia on many occasions, penetrating especially deep in 1212 and 1216. Finally, in a major battle in 1217, the knights defeated the Estonians and killed their commander, Lembitu. Northern Estonia and the islands, however, remained free for another 10 years. To complete the conquest, Albert concluded an alliance with King Valdemar II of Denmark, who in 1219 landed with a strong army on the northern coast, on the site of Tallinn.\n\nIn 1237 the Order of the Brothers of the Sword suffered a crushing defeat and was absorbed by the Teutonic Order, which assumed control of Livonia. Northern Estonia and the islands were under Danish rule; Livonia (i.e., southern Estonia and Latvia) was shared between the Teutonic Order and the bishops. The terms under which the Estonian localities submitted were not severe, but the conquerors violated them as their position became stronger, provoking a series of revolts. After major risings in 1343–45, the Danish crown sold its sovereignty over northern Estonia to the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order in 1346. The Germans became the masters in the “Land of the Virgin” and, with minor exceptions, dominated its government, its commerce, and the church for the next five centuries. The Estonians, the Latvians, and the Livs became the serfs of their conquerors, with little to sustain national feeling save their folklore and traditional crafts.\n\nSwedish period\n\nBy the end of the 15th century, two major powers were emerging around Livonia: Poland-Lithuania, already united in the south, and Muscovy, which had conquered Novgorod, in the east. More by diplomacy than by victory in battle, Lithuania gained Livonia on the dissolution of the Teutonic Order in 1561. Three years before, northern Estonia had capitulated to the king of Sweden. The Muscovite tsar Ivan IV (the Terrible) had captured Narva in 1558 and penetrated deep into Estonia, bringing devastation with him, and it was not until 1581 that the Russians were expelled by the Swedes. In 1559 the bishop of Saaremaa had sold the Estonian islands to Denmark, but in 1645 they became part of the Swedish province. By the Truce of Altmark (1629), which ended the first Polish-Swedish war, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth surrendered to Sweden the major part of Livonia, so that all Estonian lands then came under Swedish rule.\n\nProlonged wars left the country devastated, and many farms were unoccupied. The vacancies were partly filled by foreign settlers who were soon assimilated. This also gave the German nobility the opportunity to enlarge its estates, increase taxes, and exact more unpaid labour. The Swedish kings attempted to curb the power of the nobility and improve the lot of the peasants. Soon after Charles XI of Sweden came of age (1672), the nobles of Livonia were forced to show their title deeds, and those who failed to do so became tenants of the crown.\n\nRussian conquest\n\nThe “good old Swedish days” for Estonia were more a legend than reality, and they ended with the Second Northern War (Great Northern War). The Russian tsar, Peter I (the Great), was finally able to achieve the dream of his predecessors and conquer the Baltic provinces. After the defeat of Charles XII of Sweden at the Battle of Poltava (1709), Russian armies seized Livonia. The barons did not resist, angered as they were at the Swedish crown for its policy of reversion of estates. By the Peace of Nystad in 1721, Sweden ceded to Russia all its Baltic provinces.\n\nThe peasants’ lot became the worst ever. In 1804, however, under Tsar Alexander I, the peasants of Livonia were given the right of private property and inheritance; a bill abolishing serfdom was passed in Estonia in 1816 and in 1819. Other agrarian laws followed—in particular that of 1863 establishing the peasants’ right of free movement, that of 1866 abolishing the landowners’ right of jurisdiction on their estates, including the right to flog, and that of 1868 abolishing the corvée.\n\nEstonian national awakening\n\nThe Estonian peasants benefited from these reforms, and, at the end of the 19th century, they possessed two-fifths of the privately owned land of the country. With the growth of urban prosperity as a result of industrialization, the population increased. Improvement in education was such that by 1886 only about 2 percent of the Estonian army recruits were unable to read. National consciousness also increased.\n\nThe accession of Alexander III marked the beginning of a period of more rigid Russification. The Russian municipal constitution was introduced in 1882. Russian criminal and civil codes replaced the old Baltic ones. In 1887 Russian was made the language of instruction, instead of German and Estonian. In 1893 the University of Dorpat (now Tartu), which was then an important centre of German learning, was Russified. The first reaction of the Estonians was that poetic justice was being administered to their age-old oppressors, but they also feared reactionary Pan-Slavism. In 1901 in Tallinn (Revel), Konstantin Päts founded the moderately radical newspaper Teataja. In 1904, thanks to Päts, the Estonians won a clear victory on the Tallinn town council.\n\nIn January 1905 the revolution that started in Russia spread immediately to Estonia. Jaan Tönisson founded a National Liberal Party and organized its first congress in Tallinn on November 27. The 800 delegates soon split into a Liberal and a Radical wing, but both voted for resolutions demanding political autonomy for Estonia. In December Päts summoned a peasant congress in Tallinn. The Russian government responded by declaring martial law; this prompted parties of workers to scatter into the countryside, where they looted and burned manor houses. In the repression that followed, 328 Estonians were shot or hanged, and Päts and the Radical leader Jaan Teemant fled abroad, both having been sentenced—in contumacy—to death. (Päts returned in 1910.) At the elections to the first and the second Russian Duma, Estonian voters returned five deputies to the council.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe Russian Revolution of 1917 during World War I brought autonomy to Estonia. An Estonian National Council, which came to be known as the Maapäev, met on July 14 and on October 12 appointed a provisional government with Päts as premier.\n\nThe November coup d’état that brought the Bolsheviks into power in Petrograd (St. Petersburg) made itself felt in Estonia. On November 28, 1917, the Estonian Diet decided to break away from the Russian state, but on December 8 the Russian Council of People’s Commissars appointed a puppet communist government headed by Jaan Anvelt, who seized power in Tallinn but never obtained control of the whole country. In February 1918, German forces entered Estonia. The communists fled, and on February 24 the Maapäev declared Estonia independent. The following day German troops entered Tallinn. Päts was briefly arrested, and other Estonian leaders went abroad or underground. On March 3 the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed; sovereignty over the Baltic countries was transferred from Russia to Germany.\n\nGerman rule lasted until Germany’s capitulation to the Allies on November 11, 1918. The Estonian provisional government, again headed by Päts, immediately proclaimed independence, but the Soviet government declared the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk null and void, and on November 28 the Red Army took Narva and entered Estonia. Col. (later Gen.) Johan Laidoner opened a counteroffensive in January 1919, supported by weapons and war matériel from the Allies, a British naval squadron, and a Finnish voluntary force of 2,700 men. By the end of February, all Estonian territory had been freed, and the Estonian army penetrated into Soviet and Latvian territory.\n\nOn June 15, 1920, the constituent assembly (elected in April 1919), with August Rei as president, adopted a new constitution providing for a single-chamber Parliament (Riigikogu) of 100 members elected for three years, a system of proportional representation, and a chief of state (riigivanem), who was also the premier. Because no party had an absolute majority, government by coalition became the rule, and, from May 1919, when the first constitutional cabinet was formed, to May 1933, Estonia had 20 coalitions headed by 10 statesmen.\n\nOn December 1, 1924, 300 conspirators, mostly Russians working on the transit base at Tallinn or smuggled in, tried to seize communications and call in Soviet troops but failed ignominiously. The Communist Party was outlawed, and the movement became virtually extinct. The Great Depression of the early 1930s resulted in unemployment and falling agricultural prices. The strong government action necessary to cope with the situation was precluded under the 1920 constitution. A new constitution in 1933 gave sweeping powers to the president. Päts became acting president and was expected to prepare the ground for the first presidential election. Instead, he proclaimed a state of emergency on March 12, 1934. Opposition leaders were arrested; the political activities of all parties were forbidden; and Päts assumed dictatorial powers. In December 1936, a new constituent assembly was elected. It prepared a third constitution calling for the creation of a chamber of 80 deputies elected by the majority system and a national council of 40 members. A legislative election was held in February 1938. In April Päts was elected president for a term of six years."
