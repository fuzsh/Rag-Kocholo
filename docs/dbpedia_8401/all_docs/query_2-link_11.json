        "text": "The rapid advance of the Red Army in Northern Estonia continued in December 1918. One after the other, Jõhvi, Kunda, Rakvere, Tapa and Aegviidu fell into the hands of the Bolsheviks. In January 1919, the Red Army was only 40 km away from Tallinn. In Southern Estonia, the Red Army began its advance on 2 December 1918 in three columns (approx. 5000 men in total) from Pskov and moved towards the west. The first column moved towards Tartu, the second moved in the Võru-Valga-Valmiera direction and the third was active in Latvia in the Põtalovo (Abrene)-Gulbene-Plaviņa direction. On 8 December 1918, the Red Army occupied Võru and on 18 December, Valga. On 22 December, Tartu fell, despite the numerical superiority of the Estonian forces and the Northern Corps of the Russian White Army.\n\nBy the turn of the new year, the Red Army in Estonia was exhausted and the frontline stabilised. During the first week of January, the Red Army’s advance was stopped and a counter-attack was organised. At the same time, behind the frontlines, the Estonian Army was formed. Compulsory mobilisation was carried out, new units were sent to the front.\n\nA squadron of the British Royal Navy arriving in Tallinn as well as Finnish volunteers were of great help to Estonia. The knowledge that we were not alone in fighting Soviet Russia significantly raised the morale of the troops and the population\n\nBy 5 January 1919, 14,000 men were mobilised and Estonian forces launched a counter-attack. On 19 January 1919, Narva was liberated and by 22 January, Estonian forces controlled Narva River along its entire length from Narva-Jõesuu to Vasknarva.\n\nOn 11 January 1919, armoured trains began advancing along the Rakke-Tartu railway towards Tartu, liberating the city with the help of the Kuperjanov Partisan Battalion on 14 January. After liberating the city, armoured tanks, along with the 2nd Division of the Estonian Army, launched an attack, reaching the Estonian border by the end of January. On 1 February, Estonian forces liberated Valga and Võru. On 4 February, Estonian forces occupied Petseri on the southern front. On 24 February 1919, General Laidoner reported to the Estonian Provincial Assembly that the enemy had been chased out of Estonian land.\n\nThe Battle of Paju is fought between the Tartu-Valga unit of the Estonian People's Forces and the Red Army Latvian Riflemen. The battle for Paju Manor resulted in the Estonian forces capturing the town of Valga and an important railway node. Julius Kuperjanov, who was leading the Estonian offensive, was fatally injured in battle. This was one of the bloodiest battles in the War of Independence. The Estonian side lost 34 men in the battle, while a further 12 later died of their injuries, two were missing in action and 92 were injured. Counting those who were killed in action, died of wounds and went missing (likely killed near the end of the battle), the Red Army lost close to 30 men. At least 40 were wounded.\n\n1919, most of the fighting took place in Southern Estonia. In Northern Estonia, the front remained at Narva River until the end of the war. In late February, the Red Army began a new attack in the direction of Võru and Valga, occasionally reaching just a few kilometres away from the cities.\n\nThe 3rd Division was formed in March 1919, led by General Major Ernst Põdder. Armoured tanks and armoured vehicles with infantry battalions (Kuperjanov Partisan Battalion and Kalev Battalion) were joined to form the Armoured Tank Division, led by Captain Anton Irv, and by Captain Karl Parts after Irv’s death in April.\n\nApril was the most critical period of the War. Estonian forces managed to repel the attack of the Red Army that lasted for two months.\n\nHoping to establish policies more favourable to Germany, the Pfeffer Battalion and Landeswehr attack battalions overthrew the Latvian temporary government with the support of von der Goltz. They established a pro-German government run by Oskars Borkovskis, who was replaced by Andrievs Niedra on May 10. The temporary government led by Kārlis Ulmanis took refuge on the ship “Saratov” in the Liepāja port. Warships from the Entente guarded it. Niedra's government lasted until the end of June when, after a loss at a battle at Cēsis, it turned over its authority to the Entente. The Ulmanis government returned to Liepāja on June 27, and on July 8, the “Saratov” brought it back to Riga. This period of time is known in Latvian history as the \"period of three governments.\"\n\nThe Northern Division of the Russian White Army started preparing their assault on Petrograd. The plan of the Estonian military command was to assist the Northern Division in order to create a buffer zone between Estonia and the Red Army.\n\nThe Northern Division began their assault on 13 May and by early June they occupied the majority of the Saint Petersburg Governorate. The Northern Division’s advance also helped the situation on the southern front, and Estonian forces were able to launch their assault. On 25 May, they occupied Pskov, which was transferred to Russian whites the next day.\n\nTroops from the 3rd Division of the Estonian Armed Forces began their advance towards Valmiera on 17 May 1919, albeit unsuccessfully at first. Latvian units, Baltic Landeswehr and Iron Division liberated Riga on 22 May, helping the advance of the 3rd Division. As a result of the new assault, the Red Army was forced to retreat and Valmiera was liberated on 26 May. On 29 May, troops reached the Limbaži-Smiltene line. To raise the morale of the population and the 2nd Võnnu Division, the troops marched through Võnnu on 30 May and through Rauna village on 31 May.\n\nOn 27 May, all other units of the Estonian 2nd Division, including the 1st Volmari Regiment of Latvia and a group of Danish volunteers, launched an attack towards Latvia from Southeastern Estonia. The main attacking force was the 1st Cavalry Regiment. The attack proved to be extremely successful; occupying Alūksne on 30 May achieved a large-scale breakthrough of the enemy’s lines and pushed the defence lines deep into the rear of the enemy. Gulbene railway junction was occupied on 31 May; by 5 June the troops had reached Daugava (Väina) River and occupied Krustpils and Jēkabpils in Southern Latvia.\n\nBy 5 June, Estonian forces liberated most of Northern Latvia from the Red Army and civil authority was transferred to Karlis Ulmanis’ government.\n\nWhen Riga was liberated from the Bolsheviks, Iron Division and Landeswehr units continued to move toward the north-east. In early June, they encountered the Estonian army and the Northern Latvian Brigade units. This conflict concluded with the Estonian forces defeating Major General Rüdiger von der Goltz and his army, which comprised German troops and Baltic German nobility from both Estonian and Latvian territories. By defeating the Landeswehr, Estonia secured a friendly neighbour on its southern border in the form of the Republic of Latvia when Kārlis Ulmanis and his cabinet came to power. As Eastern Latvia was yet to be liberated from the Red Army and Latvian forces needed time to reorganise, the Estonian High Command decided to support them by defending the Latvian front until December 1919.\n\nAfter the clashes in early June and a 10-day ceasefire, no agreement was reached on the right of both sides to be in the region, which led to an intensified conflict between Latvian, Estonian and German units. Temporary units of the Latvian government and the Estonian army took part in the fight near Cēsis, and they defeated the German Landeswehr and the Iron Division. The defeated units retreated to Riga, and after the armistice concluded on July 3 at Strazdumuiža, they retreated to Zemgale. The Landesver was formed by the Baltic Germans and was reorganized into a Latvian military unit, which was sent to the front lines in Latgale. The last date of the battle, June 23, will be is celebrated in Estonia as Victory Day.\n\nIn September 1919, the Northwestern army started planning a new attack on Petrograd, as the Estonian government was looking for an opportunity to make peace with Soviet Russia and this would endanger the Northwestern Army’s existence in Estonia and Northwestern Russia. The attack that began on 28 September 1919 was successful. By 21 October, they reached Petrograd. British and Estonian fleets helped the attack from the sea. The Estonian high command sent a regiment of approximately 2000 men that would occupy the sea fortress around Krasnaja Gorka to help the Northwestern Army. On the southern front, Estonian units launched an attack towards Ostrov and Porhov to make the Northwestern Army’s advance on Petrograd easier, but due to harsh weather conditions and terrain the attacks were unsuccessful. Estonian soldiers did not want to go deep into Russian territory – war weariness had begun to take its toll. By the end of October, the Northwestern Army ran out of energy and the army, including many war refugees from Northwestern Russia, fled to Estonia.\n\nOn 11 November 1919, the Estonian Provisional Government decided to disband the Northwestern Army. However, units ready for battle remained on the frontline until the end of the Independence War.\n\nTo assist the Latvian Army in their fight with Bermon-Avalov’s Western Army, two armoured trains from the Armed Train Division were sent to Riga on 11 October 1919, a total of 11 cannons, 60 machine guns and approx. 400 men. Trains left when the Latvian Army took initiative and led a counter-attack."
