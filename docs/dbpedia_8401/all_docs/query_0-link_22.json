        "text": "On 1 January 1920, Estonian War of Independence came to end with an armistice ending the fighting and then formal peace treaty with the Soviet Russia, the Treaty of Tartu which signed on 2 February 1920. The war of independence started on 28 November 1918 when Bolshevik Russia invaded Estonia and lasted 402 days cost the Estonians 3,588 dead and 13,775 wounded. Estonia had successfully driven back Bolshevik and German invaders and secured its national territorial integrity. However, in first months of 1920, Estonia was faced with a new invader, typhus or typhus fever, which was caused unhygienic conditions was spread largely by body lice. The invader, again, came from the east for Estonians largely stemming from masses of Russian under arms without adequate health maintenance and medical care and the breakdown of civil society in Russia. Given contemporary events, it bears examination of how the Estonians and supporting friendly powers successfully dealt with existential threat for the Estonian Republic.\n\nPetrograd, the former capital of the Russian Empire, was the base of operations for Bolshevik Russia in their invasion attempt and war with Estonia. It was also the center of the typhus epidemic that affected the Baltic region. From autumn 1917 the situation in Petrograd under the Bolsheviks went from bad to worse with typhus spreading in the city, food and fuel almost unable. Starting on 17 January 1919, as Bolshevik forces made a “general hurried retreat eastward from Estonia” after their defeat at Narva, an uprising took place in the city against the Bolshevik government.[1] The rebellion was ruthlessly suppressed with reprisals against the civilian population. By March 1919, typhus was widespread, most of the population, except for government officials and military officers was under fed and an estimated 5% were starving to death.[2] By winter 1919 – 1920, food and fuel were almost unavailable, small wood houses and river barges were broken down for firewood. The dismantling of the barges further paralyzed transportation preventing food and fuel from reaching the city. Drinking water was in shortage supply, water pipes froze and burst flooding houses. Sewers stopped up, both the water system and sewers stopped functioning altogether. Trash was no longer collected; feces and trash were simply thrown into the street or down stairwells in apartment buildings. The gas and electricity went off and candles were not available. Dr. Hermann F. Zeidler who had been head of the Russian Red Cross Committee in Petrograd but escaped to Viiburi (Vyborg) Finland where he was directing Red Cross efforts to assist Russian refugees described the situation of hospitals in Petrograd in winter 1919-1920, “People steal linen, nightgowns and blankets. The belongings of the patients are stolen from the lockers. Nurses steal wood and take it home. Both the patients and the lower personnel are engaged in wholesale stealing. Medical supplies are very scarce, and there is a complete absence of some most common and indispensable remedies. Bicarbonate of soda is not allowed; nether are castor oil, phenacetin, etc…operations are performed under the most difficult conditions. The temperature in the operating room varies from 3 to 6 degrees. The patient freezes and the surgeon freeze, too. Almost all operations result in complications, such as pneumonia and ulcers. Water pipes burst and the fixtures in toilets are out of order. Toilets are in a filthy state.”[3] In the first half of January 1920, an average of 3000 people a day were dying, coffins were not available for all the dead and bodies were simply dropped in holes in the ice in the Neva River. On 1 January 1920 all disinfection stations in the city were closed because no disinfectants, soap, or medicines were available.[4] Petrograd was not only racked with the typhus, but also dysentery, Spanish influenza, smallpox, cholera, pulmonary diseases and what was described as hunger exhaustion. Morality of doctors treating masses of patients in Petrograd hospitals was at 40% to 50% in early 1920[5]\n\nPhoto: Dead Horse Divided up by the Hungry in Petrograd in 1919 (Hoover Institution)\n\nMuch worst than the civilian hospitals were conditions for Bolshevik Army sick and casualties. As Petrograd hospitals were horribly overcrowded approximately 10,000 sick and wounded soldiers were kept in railroad cars near Petrograd. As according to Dr. Zeidler, “The sanitary conditions of the sick in railroad cars in the vicinity of Petrograd is beyond description. Even if a train had medical personnel, all of the member of the medical staff fell sick. There was nobody to hand them water or moisten their dry tongues which cracked and bled . People froze their hands and legs and froze to death due to the severe cold and in addition to the main disease, they always contracted pneumonia. Both the diseased from the front and those from the Petrograd garrison were taken to the hospitals hungry, dirty, all covered with lice and having skin diseases.”[6]\n\nConditions were somewhat better in White Russian armies, but not much. The Northwest Army under General Nikolai Yudenitch with support of the allied powers launched an offensive to capture Petrograd on 10 October 1919. The offensive was initially highly successful with the Northwest Army reaching the outskirts of Petrograd, although failing to cut the railway line to Moscow. In late October the Bolsheviks reinforced their troops at Petrograd and went on the counteroffensive. The Northwest Army was unable to make an effective stand and retreated towards Jamburg. The army then collapsed; some 12,000 men of Northwest Army crossed Estonian lines into the Narva region. The Estonian government decided to disarm these troops as they crossed into Estonia as armed force of uncertain loyalty was a danger to internal stability. The Estonians successfully disarmed Yudentich’s forces, with the exception of 2,500 men, who volunteered to serve with Estonian forces.[7]\n\nThe failure of General Yudenitch's offensive was ascribed to a great part due to his inadequate planning for logistics. His forces advanced quickly against numerically superior forces but failed to sustain their offensive action or hold in defense. According to a New York Times war correspondent in Estonia in November 1919, the offensive was a “brilliant instance of military mismanagement.”[8] Despite the British supply of arms and ammunition, necessities of all kinds to sustain troops were lacking. Planning for medical services was inadequate before the campaign resulting in dreadful conditions for the sick and wounded. The Northwest Army staff did not plan adequately to provide billeting to shelter their personnel from the intense cold that was setting in. The troops could no longer sleep in open air as they did in previous months. Disarming the Northwest Army proved trouble free for the Estonians as the hungry and weary soldiers were more than happy to give up their weapons.[9] Many of these soldiers were suffering from typhus which readily spread at the front lines. They were also accompanied by some 21,000 hunger-stricken civilian refugees. Yudenitch ended this military service, he and his staff departed Estonia in automobiles flying the British flag bound for the Latvian port of Liepaja where they boarded a steamer for France.[10]\n\nPhoto: The Kalev Mill - housing former Northwest Army soldiers - field kitchens are preparing food (Estonian National Archives)\n\nRemnants of Yudenitch’s army were left in the Narva region where availability of water-power from the fast flowing Narva River had led to the development of textile mills in the 19th Century. The Estonians used the great complex of the Kreemsholm Mill as well as the smaller Kalev Mill to temporarily house the Russian soldiers and refugees. Some of the more seriously sick and wounded Northwest Army soldier were move to a hospital in the Kopli district of the Estonian capital Tallinn. Conditions were crowded and unhygienic – food, disinfectant and medical supplies were in short supply. The Estonian Minister of Interior Aleksander Hellat visited Jõhvi just west of Narva and stated that the situation \"could become dangerous for Estonians if measures are not taken in time.\"[11]\n\nPhotos: Crowded conditions for former Northwest Army Soldiers in February 1920 (Estonian National Archives)\n\nBy 20 February there were 13,500 cases of typhus among former Northwest Army personnel and refugees from Russia. The epidemic was quickly spreading to the Estonian population. A catastrophic public health situation loomed for the young Estonian republic. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the Estonians called on assistance from the American Red Cross Mission in Estonia. While Great Britain provided Estonia military assistance during its independence war in the form of arms and supplies as well as the supporting operations of the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, the United States principally provided humanitarian assistance through two organizations – the American Relief Administration under Herbert Hoover which provided food assistance and the American Red Cross. The Estonia had its own Red Cross Society which formed much through the efforts of Colonel Dr. Hans Leesment, head of the Estonian Army Medical Service on 24 February 1919. The Estonian Red Cross operated hospital trains and ambulances to evacuate the wounded, hospitals, and a sauna train for disinfection and bathing for troops at the front.[12]\n\nPhoto: Heating Car for the Sauna Train - Soldiers bathe and clothing are steamed (Estonian National Archives)\n\nPhoto: Sauna Train in 1919 (Estonian National Archives)\n\nIts efforts were quite success as the Estonian armed forces benefited from good medical care and until January 1920 infectious diseases were kept under control. Although, although red cross societies were formed from the inspiration of the experiences of Swiss businessman Henri Dunant in organizing care for the wounded after the horrible Battle of Solferino in 1859, the Red Cross societies of the era had Japanese Red Cross as an organizational model. The Japanese Red Cross had its organization in 1887, however Count Sano Tsunetami had formed a forerunner relief organization for the wounded in the Satsuma Rebellion of 1877. In 1904, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese Red Cross Society numbered about one million members making it the largest in the world. This mass social mobilization was due to the direct involvement of the Japanese Imperial Family who sponsored the Red Cross. The imperial family’s support of the Red Cross changed Japanese social attitudes towards women serving as nurses. It had been considered improper for respectable women to care for wounded soldiers, but now refined women were expected to carry out nursing tasks to aid the nation. The Japanese Red Cross organized on a pseudo-military model in organization and structure and it was very much comprehensive organization which drew support widely from Japanese society. It made a strong impression on foreign observers for its effective medical care for the wounded both Japanese and Russian prisoners. American observer of its wartime efforts, Dr. Anita McGee, commented that the Japanese Red Cross Society was \"characteristic of the nation\" and was probably the \"finest organization of its kind in the world.\"[13] US military observers after witnessing the situation in Japan, recommended that the American Red Cross, which was formed in 1881, be reorganized as soon as possible on Japanese model. In 1905, US President Theodore Roosevelt signed a bill into law that empowered the government to reorganize and revitalize the American Red Cross Society. The King of England Edward VII sent his chief surgeon to Japan so that the British Red Cross Society could adopt its model.[14] Estonia followed the social mobilization model of Japan, as according to Colonel Dr. Leesment, “I came to the conviction that there needed to be an organization which devoted their full energy to provide primary assistance to the sick and wounded. I talked to some of the most active members of Estonian society who agreed with this.”[15]\n\nPhoto: Colonel Dr. Hans Leesment (Estonian National Archive)\n\nOther countries adopted pseudo –military organizational model of the Japanese Red Cross Society as well. By 1918, the American Red Cross had become an important organization with strong ties to the US armed forces. While the assistance of the American Red Cross was particularly important, Estonian also received assistance from the red cross societies of Great Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Finland.\n\nThe American Red Cross mission in Estonia, under Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Edward W. Ryan consisting of forty men worked with the Estonian Army Medical Service and the Estonian Red Cross to contain the outbreak. As the Americans had experience with previous typhus outbreaks, the American Red Cross Mission took the lead in situation with the support of Estonian government. Central the effort was Lieutenant Colonel Ryan, who was Scranton Pennsylvania had his medical degree from Fordham University in New York, he had experience in Mexico during the bloody civil war that raged there and in Serbia, notably, in dealing with the typhus epidemic in Belgrade in March 1916. First steps taken were to seal the eastern borders and strictly quarantine the hospital at Kopli and the entire Narva region. After that the entire country was essentially quarantined as well, in description of some American newspaper correspondents - a Red Cross dictatorship formed. According to the New York Times on 18 March 1920 “Two Government are holding power in Esthonia. One is the regularly constituted executive body of the country and the other is the American Red Cross Commission, under command of Lieut, Colonel Edward Ryan of Scranton Pa. This commission has been vested with authority to take any measures, political or economic, to stamp out the typhus plague raging here. The Esthonian Government, realizing its inability to cope with the danger of an epidemic has given the Red Cross authority to put the country under the strictest quarantine rules. Travel from one point to an another by all persons not provided with a Red Cross permit is forbidden, and no Esthonian living in infected region can broad a train or leave the limits of his home district without permission of American authorities. These measures have resulted in the Red Cross gaining control of the situation.\"[16]\n\nPhoto: Lt.Colonel Dr. Edward W. Ryan\n\nUnder coordination of Lt. Col. Ryan, the Estonian Army Medical Service, Estonian Red Cross and America Red Cross, the Kaitseliit (Defence League), Estonian police inaugurated a comprehensive anti – typhus campaign. They were also assisted by twenty-four doctors of the French Health Service. In the Narva region which was strictly quarantined, the Estonian Army Medical Service with help of the American Red Cross hospitals were stood up hospitals for thousands former Northwest army soldiers now hospital patients. patients in hospitals were bathed, shaven, deloused and moved into clean rooms which had been completely deloused. Many of the former Northwest Army soldiers had not bathed in months and had not seen soap in weeks. Soap was in short supply and thus the American Red Cross rushed a shipment of it to Estonia for distribution. Estonian women served as nurses and the convalescents themselves carried out the duties of orderlies. The Estonians with help of the American Red Cross provided some 40,000 items of new clothing to the former soldiers and the civilian refugees. The situation quickly started to improve. Mortality rates fell to an average of five people a day in the second half of March, compared with an average of 50 people a day at the beginning of the month. The Estonian Red Cross and the Estonian Railway Administration put eight new sauna trains into service and these trains moved to points around the country where they were needed. The anti-typhus organization essentially disinfected the entire country. The Estonians mobilized thousands of volunteers who disinfected schools, churches and private homes to rid them of plague-spreading insects. A series of sanitary stations were established on the Russian border to inspect and delouse refugees coming in from Russia. Within twenty days of beginning of the campaign the backbone of the epidemic had been broken and the emergency passed.[17] As the Medical Record reported in September 1920, “After months of hard work, the spread of typhus was checked.”[18] Movement bans were removed and Estonia could continue on the road of development as a prosperous independent nation.\n\nThe typhus epidemic stuck Estonia unexpectedly – as the Northwest Army had been receiving support from the Danish Red Cross, France, and Great Britain, no one considered sanitary situation to be as bad as it was. To be sure, the epidemic was spread from refugees who were escaping the vicinity of Petrograd from under the Bolsheviks where the situation was out of control. Prisoners of War were usually infected with typhus as well. The epidemic hit the former Northwest Army hard resulting in thousands of deaths, but it was controlled in the Estonian armed forces and prevented from spreading to the Estonian population. Some 346 Estonians did die from the epidemic, but it could have been well worse. Speed of organization and action was critical as well as close cooperation with allied nations and allied organizations such as the American Red Cross. In effectively stemming the spread, a comprehensive and all of society approach was critical as well, this was especially true for a small nation with limited resources which was emerging from a prolonged war.\n\nPhoto: \"Donate to the Estonian Red Cross!\" Former British Mark V Tank provided to the Northwest Army now used for some humanitarian advertising in Narva in 1920 (Estonian National Archives)\n\n[1] New Rebellion Breaks Out in Russ Capital,” San Francisco Chronicle (18 January 1919): 2\n\n[2] “Penetrates Lair of Russian Bolsheviki,” Chicago Daily Tribune (26 March 1919): 1\n\n[3] Boris Brasol, “Russia filthy, diseased,” New York Times.
