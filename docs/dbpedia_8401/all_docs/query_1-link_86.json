On 24 February 1918, the Maapaev, a six-member Provisional National Council, elected a three-person Salvation Committee, the PÃ¤Ã¤stekomitee. This Salvation Committee drafter a declaration of independence, later approved by the Provisional Council and publicly declared. Following the declaration, Estonia was then forced to fight for its independence against Soviet Russia and German forces, a war which was eventually won and commemorated as Victory Day.\n\nIndependence Day in Estonia is celebrated annually on 24 February. While under Soviet occupation, the holiday was suspended but then was later restored on the Day of Restoration of Independence in 1991.\n\nTop facts about Estonian Independence Day\n\nOn 8 April 1917, Estonian organizations and military personnel of around 40 000 people held a demonstration in St. Petersburg in support of Estonian self-government.\n\nOn 12 April 1917, the Russian Provisional Government signed the Law on Estonian Autonomy. The law united the Livonian counties of Tartu, VÃµru, Viljandi, PÃ¤rnu and Saaremaa with Estonia.\n\nEstonia secured its borders and signed the Tartu Peace Treaty with Soviet Russia on 2 February 1920. It would remain independent from Soviet rule until the 40s.\n\nOn 24 February 1989, the red flag of Soviet Estonia was replaced by the blue, black and white Estonian flag on Toompea, Estonia's Town Hall. Since that time Independence Day has been celebrated as a public holiday once again in Estonia.\n\nIn the late 1980s, Estonia started regaining its liberty through the Singing Revolution â a series of mass sing-alongs that were an integral part of the peaceful protests against the Soviet rule.\n\nTop things to do\n\nPlace a wreath or flowers on the graves of Estonian state figures. The wreaths are often placed at the grave of President K. Pats. Wreaths are then placed at the base of the Monument of the War of Independence at Parnu Alevi Cemetery. There is also another monument to the War of Independence on Vabaduse Square by the Guard Battalion.\n\nAttend the large Defence Force Parade on Parnu Central Square.\n\nJoin in on the Independence Day concert and reception by the President. The concert takes place in the evening at the Parnu Concert Hall.\n\nSpread awareness on social media for the day by using hashtags such as #IndependenceEstonia and #EstoniaFreedom.\n\nExplore Estonian cuisine in local restaurants or try to cook some traditional Estonian dishes at home. You can find recipes online for dishes like pirukad (pastry filled with meat or vegetables), rye bread, hÃµÃµgvein (mulled wine), and kama (traditional Estonian porridge).\n\n‹\n\n›"
