        "text": "A trip to Estonia\n\nLast fall, my editors sent me to Brexit-Land. Now they've asked me to continue to explore Europe’s state of the union.\n\nI see myself as someone who cares deeply about ‘‘European politics.’’\n\nIn reality, this means I’m glued to my Twitter feed during a spectacle like Brexit, gobbling down snarky think-pieces on some meaningless twist du jour.\n\nEmbarrassingly, a majority of the E.U. remains a foreign place to me. There are 27 member states, and I know the people, places and history of only a handful of them.\n\nI looked at a map of Europe and picked the area I knew the least about:\n\nThe Baltic States!\n\nI was especially curious about Estonia —\n\na former Soviet republic that, from afar, looks as though Silicon Valley and Scandinavia had a baby. It seemed like the hip cousin I didn’t know I had …\n\nas opposed to Britain,\n\nthe drunk uncle I used to admire.\n\nBased on a mix of journalistic masochism and genuine geographic curiosity, I decided to take a 27-hour bus trip from Berlin.\n\nI had a lot of time to consider what I knew about the Baltics.\n\nI realized I couldn’t name a single Baltic dish, building, invention or artist.\n\nCome on! This couldn’t be.\n\nI stared out the window.\n\nThen I finally came up with a name:\n\nArvydas Sabonis. An N.B.A. player from Lithuania who played for the Portland Trail Blazers in the ’90s.\n\nNot much, but I started digging.\n\nSabonis was one of four starters from Kaunas, Lithuania, who beat the Americans as part of the 1988 Soviet Olympic team.\n\nOf course, nobody knew they were Lithuanian — they were Russians for all anyone in the West cared.\n\nBy 1992, Lithuania was free and wanted to send its own dream team to the Games in Barcelona.\n\nSabonis and a fellow teammate went looking for sponsors for their independent Olympic bid. They found a surprising donor:\n\nthe Grateful Dead.\n\nThe band supported the Lithuanian team financially and even designed a shirt for them. They won bronze!\n\nIn the early morning, as I rode through Lithuania, I was happily searching for backyard basketball hoops — proud to be on the same European team.\n\nMore than a day after boarding the bus, I finally arrived in Tallinn, Estonia’s capital.\n\nThe next morning, I got up early to explore the city.\n\nI started my tour at the waterfront, where I discovered remnants of the 1980 Olympic Games.\n\nCool logo!\n\nBut for Estonians, Communist relics like this are a reminder of the nation’s most traumatic era,\n\nwhen they lost their sovereignty and became part of the Soviet Union. During one week in 1949, Stalin deported nearly 3 percent of the population to Siberian gulags.\n\nIn September 1988, a staggering 300,000 people (that’s more than 20 percent of the entire population) gathered at the Tallinn Song Festival grounds and sang patriotic hymns, as a way to voice political dissent against the Soviet regime. They called it the Singing Revolution.\n\nFinally, in 1991, Boris Yeltsin agreed to grant Estonia independence, though it took until 1994 for the last Russian troops to leave — and it happened only after President Lennart Meri forced the issue over a long, vodka-fueled lunch with Yeltsin. (Meri reportedly disposed of his drinks in a potted plant.)\n\nWithin 10 years of that lunch, Estonia had established a robust democracy and a thriving economy.\n\nI asked a friend in Tallinn how his tiny nation managed to pull that off. He said Estonians are very pragmatic.\n\nHow can a country be pragmatic, you ask? Consider this quote from Meri in 1992:\n\nThe transformation from the Soviet to the E.U. era was visible as I walked through the city.\n\nThe outskirts still fit my stereotypical idea of drab Communist architecture.\n\nThe old city center, however, has been almost completely renovated. Everything is so quaint — the buildings might have been imported from a Swiss resort.\n\nThe same goes for the prices in the restaurants there, which puts them well out of reach for most Estonians.\n\nOne afternoon, I visited St. Nicholas’ Church, where I learned the story of the Flemish aristocrat Charles Eugène de Croy.\n\nIn 1702, de Croy died in Tallinn without repaying his considerable local debts.\n\nThe Estonians hoped to recoup some of the money from his relatives, but they refused, so the authorities denied him a proper funeral.\n\nThe corpse was kept in the church for years, where it eventually mummified, at which point they put it on public display for a fee.\n\nDe Croy’s body remained on view until the late 19th century, which offset at least some of what he owed the city.\n\nThis hard-core approach to debt has survived into the modern era. To achieve the financial benchmarks required to adopt the euro, which they did in 2011, Estonians put themselves through a tough cost-cutting regimen.\n\nThey drastically lowered government salaries and public spending and raised the age for pensions. Today, Estonia has by far the lowest government debt in the E.U. And Estonians are proud of their approach — they have passionate and public arguments with critics of austerity like Paul Krugman.\n\nSaving money alone was not enough to create a viable economy. With limited natural resources and few established industries, Estonia saw its niche in becoming the most digitally advanced nation on earth.\n\nThe entire administration is digital. Almost everything can be done remotely, with automated systems that were designed and built in-house by the government itself. These innovations save the state an estimated 2 percent of G.D.P. annually.\n\nThe motivation seems to go beyond the financial payoff. The country’s leaders want to create a lean and effective form of government for the benefit of their citizens.\n\nImagine: no more waiting at the D.M.V. Ever.\n\nEstonia defies my political stereotypes. As in most E.U. countries, there has been a troubling surge in right-wing populism, but the people remain steadfastly enthusiastic about the E.U.\n\nWith its aversion to regulation and deficit spending, Estonia can seem like a utopia for neoliberals, but then the government pursues an ambitious progressive agenda, including some of the most generous terms for paid maternal leave in the world.\n\nAs I started packing for my return home, I thought about how — for thousands of years — countries have defined success and glory by crushing enemies and creating empires.\n\nHaving been on the receiving end of such ambitions until very recently, Estonia seems to have developed a different idea of success.\n\nI left Tallinn by ferry to head to Finland. A generation ago, this would have been like traveling to an enemy kingdom, with long lines and hostile border guards. Not today.\n\nAs I had breakfast aboard the ferry, I thought of what Meri said when he stepped down as president in 2001: ‘‘I hand over a normal, boring country.’’\n\nIn early 2020, I think there is no sexier vision than that of a ‘‘normal and boring’’ life: reliable institutions, social equality, a sound economy, and freedom from climate armageddon.\n\nFighting for such things is exactly what the E.U. is supposed to do. What an audacious goal.\n\nPostscript: I went on this trip late last year. The past few weeks have (temporarily, I hope) changed everything: Borders are closed, discussions about austerity are paused and we are all dreaming of normal and boring days that start with dropping off our kids at school and end with meeting a few friends at a restaurant. Rebuilding our economies and our political institutions will be daunting. For now, in Europe, this struggle is taking place on a national level. We will find out soon if the E.U. can play the important role it was created for.\n\nI will continue my investigation.\n\n&nbsp\n\nAcknowledgements: Thank you to Scott Diel, Johannes Thimm and Marko Mäetamm for their insight into Estonian people and culture.\n\nStory & art by Christoph Niemann\n\nAdditional design & development by Jacky Myint\n\nCorrection:\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated two dates.
