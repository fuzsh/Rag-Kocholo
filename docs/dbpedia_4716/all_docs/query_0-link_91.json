        "text": "Forms of Theatre\n\nAGITPROP\n\nThe original sense of agitprop was \"agitation and propaganda on behalf of Communism\", or \"a government agency or department responsible for agitation and propaganda\". The main current sense of the word is simply \"propaganda, especially socially or politically motivated propaganda appearing in literary works, films, etc.\"; though the word often refers to political propaganda, it is not restricted to communist doctrine.\n\nThe word agitprop is first found in English sources in the mid 1930s.\n\nFrom the Random House Word of the Day website.\n\nBALLAD OPERA\n\nA theatrical entertainment popular in early 18th-century England, taking the form of a satirical play interspersed with traditional or operatic songs. The best-known example is John Gay's The Beggar's Opera (1728).\n\n[Definition from Oxford Languages, via Google]\n\nBOURGEOIS TRAGEDY\n\nBourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form of tragedy that developed in 18th-century Europe. It is a fruit of the enlightenment and the emergence of the bourgeois class and its ideals. It is characterized by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nBRECHT / BRECHTIAN*\n\nTO BE DEFINED\n\nBURLESQUE\n\nAdult-orientated entertainment, consisting of dancing, minimal costumes, songs and comic sketches. Popular from the 1840s in Europe and the USA.\n\nCOMEDY\n\nAn entertaining performance designed to make an audience laugh.\n\nIn Greek and Roman theatre, any play with a happy ending was called a comedy, regardless of whether it was funny.\n\nSketch Comedy - a series of short unconnected scenes, with comedic and/or stylised performances, containing jokes, which may be topical and/or satirical.\n\nHigh Comedy (also known as pure or highbrow comedy) is a type of comedy characterized by witty dialogue, satire, biting humor, or criticism of life.\n\nLow Comedy (also known as lowbrow humour) is more physical comedy, using slapstick or farce, with no purpose other than to cause the audience to laugh.\n\nSee also SATIRE.\n\nDINNER THEATRE\n\nA theatre performance that includes a meal, either at the same venue or at an adjacent restaurant.\n\nAlthough it was popular in the 1950s in the USA (as Dinner Theater), there are still many venues worldwide where a live performance is accompanied by a meal, usually in a tourist-focussed themed attraction. Examples run daily in Las Vegas or Orlando, Florida, and include murder-mystery themes, medieval themes, or magic shows with dinner served.\n\nDOCUMENTARY THEATRE\n\nDocumentary theatre, or theatre of fact, is theatre that wholly or in part uses pre-existing documentary material (such as newspapers, government reports, interviews, etc.) as source material for the script, ideally without altering its wording.\n\nWhere it's featured solely on the words of others, usually members of the public in a particular situation, it's known as VERBATIM THEATRE.\n\nDUMBSHOW\n\nA piece of mimed action. Used in Shakespeare's Hamlet to summarise and comment on the main plot.\n\nEND ON\n\nTraditional audience seating layout where the audience is looking at the stage from the same direction.

Epic theatre emphasizes the audience's perspective and reaction to the piece through a variety of techniques that deliberately cause them to individually engage in a different way The purpose of epic theatre is not to encourage an audience to suspend their disbelief, but rather to force them to see their world as it is. (from Wikipedia)\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nEXPRESSIONISM\n\nTheatre design and performance style which places greater value on emotion than realism. The trademark Expressionist effects were often achieved through distortion.\n\nFARCE\n\nForm of comedy play originated in France, using fast-paced physical action and visual comedy more than humour based on language.\n\nIn London's West End, following the Second World War, there were farces at the Aldwych Theatre (the Aldwych Farces, particularly those by Ben Travers) and at the Whitehall Theatre (the Whitehall Farces).\n\nFORUM THEATRE\n\nForum theatre is a type of theatre created by the influential practitioner Augusto Boal as part of what he calls his \"Theatre of the Oppressed.\" While practicing earlier in his career, Boal would apply simultaneous dramaturgy. In this process the actors or audience members could stop a performance, often a short scene in which a character was being oppressed in some way. The audience would suggest different actions for the actors to carry out on-stage in an attempt to change the outcome of what they were seeing. This was an attempt to undo the traditional actor/audience divide and to bring audience members into the performance, to have an input into the dramatic action they were watching.\n\nFUTURISM\n\nAn artistic and social movement that started in Italy in the early 20th century. In art, it celebrated technologies of the time - air travel, machinery, industrialisation. Futurist ideas helped to form Art Deco, Vorticism, Constructivism, Surrealism, Dada, and much later Neo-Futurism. In theatre, it fought against classical forms of theatre and celebrated the youthful, spontaneous, and satirical, encouraging vaudeville and music hall forms.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nGRAND GUIGNOL\n\nShock theatre form originally from Le Grand Guignol theatre in Montmartre, Paris (opened in 1897). Specialised in portraying the macabre & gruesome to the delight and horror of the audience.\n\nIMMERSIVE THEATRE\n\n1) A piece of linear performance where the venue has been adapted / altered to make it part of the narrative of the story. Secret Cinema events are immersive in this sense.\n\n2) A piece of non-linear performance where a non-theatre venue has been completely transformed into a highly detailed world within which the audience is free to roam and see various parts of the story performed in appropriate locations. The UK company Punchdrunk created the concept of audience members wearing masks which allow them to wander around the space anonymously.\n\nPunchdrunk Theatre\n\nIN THE ROUND\n\nTheatre in the Round is a form of audience seating layout where the acting area is surrounded on all sides by seating. There are often a number of entrances through the seating. Special consideration needs to be given to onstage furniture and scenery as audience sightlines can easily be blocked.\n\nStage managers and directors often use the idea of a clock face to describe actor positions on stage (e.g. the aisle nearest the technical point is described as the 12 O'clock position, with other aisles described as 3, 6 and 9 O'clock.)\n\nSee also ARENA, THRUST, END ON, TRAVERSE.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\n1) An electrical system in a particular building (e.g. \"the stage lighting installation was tested last year\")\n\n2) A piece of art designed to transform a particular room or building into something other than a room in an art gallery. Installations often use complex audio-visual equipment and can be intensely immersive experiences. (e.g. \"In the studio space this week we have an installation by John Doe entitled 'Space'\")\n\nLEGITIMATE THEATRE\n\nThe term was originally derived from the UK Licencing Act of 1737, which sought to censor and control what theatrical performances were able to say about the government.\n\nIn 1660, after the Restoration of Charles II, the previous ban on public entertainments was lifted, and letters patent were granted to Thomas Killigrew and William Davenant to form two theatre companies to perform 'serious drama'.\n\nOther theatres were not permitted to perform such serious work, but could put on comedy, pantomime or melodrama.\n\nAll performances were licenced by the Examiner of Plays.\n\nThe 1843 Theatres Act permitted all theatres to perform 'serious' drama, but censorship and licencing were in place until 1968, when a new Theatres Act was created.\n\nLegitimate theater now refers to theatres that produce 'serious', high-quality professional work rather than variety or burlesque.\n\nMELODRAMA\n\nA Melodrama is a dramatic work that exaggerates plot and/or characters in order to appeal to the emotions. It is usually based around having the same character traits, (for example, a hero, who is fearless and who the audience is rooting for, the heroine, who is usually in peril of some kind, which the hero rescues her from; the villain (usually likes the heroine too) and villain's sidekick (typically gets in the way of or annoys the villain).\n\nThe term is also used in scholarly and historical musical contexts to refer to dramas of the 18th and 19th centuries in which orchestral music or song was used to accompany the action.\n\nMETATHEATRE\n\nThis term, coined by Lionel Abel, has entered into common critical usage; however, there is still much uncertainty over its proper definition and what dramatic techniques might be included in its scope. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nMIME\n\nForm of performance with no spoken words. Plot, character etc. are conveyed to the audience by movement and gesture. From the Greek Mimos.\n\nSee also Physical Theatre.\n\nMarcel Marceau Foundation for the Advancement of the Art of Mime\n\nMummenschanz\n\nMINIMALISM\n\nArtistic movement starting in the 1960s which aspired to simple form and design. A minimalist theatrical stage design might involve only the essential compoents of the scene (e.g. a single chair and a suspended window frame, and no other set or furniture).\n\nThe ruling mantra is 'Less is More'. It is often best to take away things when the stage picture is not right, rather than adding more - this applies to stage lighting as well as scenic design.\n\nMORALITY PLAY\n\nAn allegorical performance in whcih the protagonist is met by personifications of various moral attributes who try to prompt him to choose a godly life over one of evil. Popular in Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nMUMMERS PLAY\n\nA traditional folk play, performed on a makeshift stage in villages aross Britain, performed by amateur actors.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nMUSIC HALL\n\nA type of British theatrical entertainment popular between 1850 and 1960. It involved a mixture of popular song, comedy, speciality acts and variety entertainment. The term is derived from a type of theatre or venue in which such entertainment took place. British music hall was similar to American vaudeville, featuring rousing songs and comic acts, while in the United Kingdom the term vaudeville referred to more working-class types of entertainment that would have been termed burlesque in America.\n\nMUSICAL THEATRE\n\n(From Wikipedia) Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical – humor, pathos, love, anger – are communicated through words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements.\n\nConcept Musical: a work of musical theatre whose book and score are structured around conveying a theme or message, rather than emphasizing a narrative plot. Examples include Cabaret and Company.\n\nJukebox Musical: A stage musical show that has been constructed from pre-released existing songs, usually from one artist or genre.Examples include Bat Out Of Hell, We Will Rock You and Mamma Mia!\n\nMegamusical: Similar to a movie Blockbuster, the Megamusical is spectacular and costly, and is designed to reap financial rewards for its' producers.

Traditional since medieval times, the Mystery Play is a re-enactment of bliblical scenes, usually performed outdoors in a small town or village, by the community.\n\nA Passion Play is a cycle of plays that portray the Easter story, specifically. One of the most famous is the Oberammergau Passion Play, performed in the German town in years ending in a zero.\n\nWhat is a Miracle Play\n\nOberammergau Passion Play\n\nNATURALISM\n\n1) Lighting Design: A naturalistic approach to lighting design requires lanterns to be placed in ways that duplicate where the light would come from in nature. For example, a sunny day outdoor scene would be lit primarily from above the acting area, with fill lighting in from the sides as if from the cloud. A dark room would be lit by moonlight through a window, and the light level would increase when a door is opened from a lit corridor or when a light fitting is turned on.\n\n2) Performance: A naturalistic performance (following the techniques of Stanislavski) requires that the actor completely understands and inhabits every aspect of the characters' life, as well as the motivation and lines that are to be spoken.\n\n3) Scenic Design: The set designer aims to reproduce reality as closely as possible.\n\nHeightened Naturalism involves exaggerating the natural elements of the scene for dramatic (or comedic) purposes.\n\nNOH THEATRE\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nONE PERSON SHOW\n\nAn entire performance for a single performer.

The performance may be either scripted or unscripted, random or carefully orchestrated; spontaneous or otherwise carefully planned with or without audience participation.

Performance art can happen anywhere, in any venue or setting and for any length of time. The actions of an individual or a group at a particular place and in a particular time constitute the work.\n\nPHYSICAL THEATRE\n\nPhysical theatre is a genre of performance which makes use of the body (as opposed to the spoken word) as the primary means of performance and communication with an audience. In using the body, the performer or actor will concentrate on:\n\nThe use of body shape and position\n\nFacial expressions\n\nRhythmical movement, pace and the energy of the body\n\nGesture\n\nPosture\n\nGait\n\nPhysical theatre can be distinquished from dance in that it tends to focus more on narrative, character and action.

Originally a member of the surrealist movement, Artaud eventually began to develop his own theatrical theories. The Theatre of Cruelty can be seen as a break from traditional Western theatre and a means by which artists assault the senses of the audience, and allow them to feel the unexpressed emotions of the subconscious. While Artaud was only able to produce one play in his lifetime that reflected the tenets of the Theatre of Cruelty, the works of many theatre artists reflect his theories. These artists include Jean Genet, Jerzy Grotowski, and Peter Brook. (from Wikipedia)\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nTHEATRE OF THE ABSURD\n\nThe Theatre of the Absurd is a post–World War II designation for particular plays of absurdist fiction written by a number of primarily European playwrights in the late 1950s. It is also a term for the style of theatre the plays represent. The plays focus largely on ideas of existentialism and express what happens when human existence lacks meaning or purpose and communication breaks down. The structure of the plays is typically a round shape, with the finishing point the same as the starting point. Logical construction and argument give way to irrational and illogical speech and to the ultimate conclusion—silence.\n\nExamples of absurdist plays include Beckett's Waiting for Godot, Jean Genet's The Maids and Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.\n\nWikipedia entry\n\nTRAGI-COMEDY / TRAGICOMEDY\n\nTragicomedy is a literary genre that blends aspects of both tragic and comic forms.
