        "meta_description": "In the past two decades, Scotland’s military identity has been the subject of several historical analyses, placing it in relation to the decline of Britain as an imperial power and as a nation. Few studies, however, have offered an overview of the treatment of the Highlander soldier in parliamentary debates since the eighteenth century. This article draws on Cobbett’s Parliamentary History of England, official transcripts of parliamentary debates provided by British History Online and Hansard, as well as on press articles, in order to demonstrate that the Highlander soldier, whose uniform is instantly recognisable, was seen either as a threat to, or as a symbol of, British power and that he fitted in wider discussions on defence and Scottish identity.",

        "text": "The Highlands’ Military Identity in British Political Debates in the Long 18th Century\n\n15 A Collection Of The Parliamentary Debates In England From The Year M,DC,LXVIII. To the Present Tim (...)\n\nWe think it applies severe remedies, where, as far as we perceive, there is no disease; and this at a time when the Highlanders not being accused of any enormities for which, in our opinions, the legislature ought in justice to punish them, or in prudence to fear them; we think it would become us, as good patriots, to endeavour rather to keep them quiet, than make them so.\n\n4thly, Because the Dress prohibited is extremely well suited to the Circumstances of the Mountainous Country in which it is now wore; serving for a covering by Night, whilst, at the same Time, it is very light and easily carried by Day.\n\n18 House of Lords, Journal, Volume 24, May 1732, 21-31, in Journal of the House of Lords Vol. 24, 1732 (...)\n\n5thly, Because, whilst the Bill itself, by disarming the Highlanders, distinguishes them from others His Majesty’s Subjects, it does not seem proper to give them any Disgust, by depriving them of that Dress, which, in their Circumstances, appears highly convenient, if not absolutely necessary for them.\n\n5Altogether, these measures had little to no effect and, in the 1740s, Andrew Fletcher, the Lord Justice Clerk, wrote to the Marquess of Tweeddale, by then Secretary of State for Scotland, about how few Highlanders, especially those attracted to Jacobitism, conformed to the law:\n\n19 British National Archives, Disarming Act, <https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/ (...)\n\nBy an Act of the 1st of the late King, entitled an act for the more effectual security of the peace of the Highlands, the whole Highlanders without distinction are disarmed forever and forbid to use or bear arms under penaltys (sic). This act has been found by Experience to work the quite contrary effect from what was intended by it, and in reality proves a mean for more effectually disturbing, the peace of the Highlands, and of the rest of the Kingdom, & his Majestys (sic) Government by and through those highlands, and the cause of this operation is now plainly visible. For all the disaffected clans retain their arms, and either concealed them at the fact of disarming, or have provided themselves since, at the same time that the dutyfull (sic) and well affected clans have truely (sic) submitted to this measure of the Government and Act of the Legislature and are still disarmed or have no quantity of Fire arms amongst them.\n\n22 Cobbett’s Parliamentary History of England from the Norman Conquest in 1066, to the Year 1803, Lon (...)\n\nThese highlanders, it is true, were made to appear terrible before they were known, but after we got a little more into their acquaintance, they appeared to be men, and after they were disarmed, (…) there is certainly no farther occasion for the six Highland companies, which are kept up only for preserving the peace of that country; these six companies amount to above 500 men, and the maintaining of them costs the public much above 5,000 £ (sic) yearly.\n\nThe Myth of the Highlander Soldier\n\n11In January 1783, another Highlander mutiny, that of the 77th regiment, was commented upon in Parliament by Lord Auckland, Chief Secretary for Ireland who had witnessed the behaviour of that unit during his stay in the island:\n\n30 Scots Magazine and Edinburgh Literary Miscellany, volume 45, May 1783. “Parliament: on the mutiny (...)\n\nHe had happened to have the 77th regiment immediately under his observation during sixteen months of their garrison duty in Dublin, and though it was not the most agreeable duty in the service, he must say that their conduct was most exemplary. Their officers were not only men of gentlemanly character, but peculiarly attentive to regimental discipline. He having once, upon the sudden alarm of invasion, sent an order for the immediate march of this regiment to Cork, they showed their alacrity by marching at an hour’s notice, and completed their march with a despatch beyond any instance in modern times, and this too without leaving a single soldier behind.\n\n34 The Parliamentary History of England, Volume 24 debate in the Lords on the forfeited Estates Bill, (...)\n\nHe reminded their lordships that the families in question had been deprived of their estates for near forty years; and he accounted for the conduct of the highlanders in the rebellion, by shewing that they were solely guided by their clannish attachment to their chieftains. Equally strangers to the language and customs of the English, it was no wonder that they felt not in common with us. The intercourse opened with Scotland after the rebellion and the, and the familiarizing the highlanders to English customs, soon removed their prejudices, and at the end of twelve years so completely were they attached to national government, that we had whole armies poured out of that country to fight the battles of Great Britain.\n\n42 The Globe, 16 April 1850, 4.\n\n(…) several persons in the United Kingdom, complain[ed] on the part of the Highland soldiers, and the inhabitants of the districts in which they were located, of the indecency of their dress and the shortness of their petticoats. The petitioners complain that it was exceedingly unseemly to see robust men with their nether ends exposed, and no protection afforded to those parts which ought, in common decency, to be preserved from public observation. The petition was received amidst loud and ironical cheers from all sides of the house.\n\n18In 1881, the Cardwell reforms of the British army meant that recruiting depots established in the British Isles would from then on reinforce the regional aspects of each regiment. By then, all Scottish regiments, including Lowlanders, were expected to wear either kilts or at least Highlander paraphernalia to inspire terror among potential enemies and attract recruits. For instance, the 1st regiment of Foot, the Royal Scots, adopted tartan trews, i.e. trousers, while the Seaforth Highlanders, originally raised in the late eighteenth century, recovered their full Highland dress. By the end of the nineteenth century, the Highlander had become a perennial figure of imperial loyalty, yet it is possible to find some elements proving that his silhouette could still be perceived as alien and slightly dangerous. In 1893, during the debate about the second Home Rule Bill, which caused frictions in the British Parliament not just because of its implications for self-government in Ireland but for the future of the entire United Kingdom, the Highlander was clearly mentioned as a threat to Britain itself. Henry James, MP for Bury in Lancashire, attacked the Chancellor of the Duchy, the Liberal James Bryce from Aberdeen, for having foreign interests at heart, mentioning both his Scottish roots and his interest for American politics:\n\n44 Hansard, Sir Henry James (attorney general), Home Rule Bill, Second Reading. [Adjourned Debate.] H (...)\n\n[…] if ever the Chancellor of the Duchy [an honorary title] should think it necessary to take the field on behalf of his native country, he will probably do so in the uniform of a Scottish regiment; he would wear the kilt and the sporran; and if he chose any martial music with which to inspire his action it would be the national air of America rather than that of these Kingdoms.\n\n50 Hansard, Mr George Wyndham, (Conservative MP for Dover), Army Estimates, 1900–1901. House of Commo (...)\n\nIt is not a question of mere fashion. […] In one capacity the common-sense critic says, “Why not adopt a plain, sensible head-gear?” but in his other capacity as a proud parent of a young son in a crack corps he asks, “Why destroy the head-dress of that corps which was perhaps worn at Fontenoy or in other battles more than one hundred years ago?” We cannot afford to ignore that altogether. It is part of the capital on which we run our army.\n\nThe Highlander Regiments in British Parliamentary Debates (20th-21st Centuries)\n\n52 House of Lords, Hansard, 08 January 1915, vol. 18, col. 411-412.\n\nThe other point is that the new garment is not a kilt and can under no circumstances be called a kilt. I do not wish to occupy your Lordships’ time by describing the difference between a kilt as it ought to be made and the kilt as it is made in this new garment, but I believe the effect is that instead of looking like a kilt it looks much more like an abbreviated lady’s hobble-skirt.\n\n23As the Cold War was quickly settling in, the use of kilts in the army seemed less relevant as nuclear deterrence emerged. Bearing in mind the cost of maintaining such troops as well as preserving their characteristic uniforms, James Carmichael, a Labour MP for Glasgow Bridgeton, offered a rather sobering view during a debate about the place of Scotland in the UK’s military organisation in 1947:\n\n56 Hansard, James Carmichael (Scottish Labour MP for Glasgow Bridgeton), CLAUSE 1. — (Liability to be (...)\n\nWhat are our military obligations today? Almost half the people of Scotland live in the crowded Southern belt, and in modern warfare Scotland, in the economical and in the physical sense, could be wiped out in less than 24 hours. We are quite incapable of producing an Army that could be of service in any foreign field. [Honourable members: “Nonsense.”] (…) We cannot produce an Army in Scotland that can be of any real service in modern warfare. Let there be no nonsense about that. Indeed, the argument applies to the entire country.\n\n24In response, Commander Galbraith, a Scottish Unionist MP also representing a Glaswegian constituency, insisted on the military tradition of Scotland:\n\n57 Hansard, Commander Thomas Galbraith (Unionist MP for Glasgow Pollok), CLAUSE 1. — (Liability to be (...)\n\nThe hon. Gentleman spoke of our Army not being of any real service. I wonder what the men who fought in the recent war would think of a statement of that kind? I wonder what the men who have fought in wars time and again and who came from Scotland will think of a remark like that? […] Today war comes very quickly, and men have to be trained and have to be prepared and capable to fit into the machine at a moment’s notice. The Amendment simply means that no Scotsman would be prepared to do so, and it suggests that, at the outbreak of war, they would come forward, as they undoubtedly always have done and as I hope they always will, quite unprepared to play their part in the defence of their own country. It means that, for many months after the outbreak of war, the defence of Scotland would be entrusted to men from South of the Border. What an indignity to put upon our people.\n\n62 House of Commons, Hansard, Lieutenant-colonel Sir Thomas Moore, Defence, debate 31 July 1957, vol. (...)\n\n[…] the Highland Light Infantry is a City of Glasgow and a Highland regiment and wears the kilt. The Royal Scots Fusiliers is a Lowland regiment and wears trews. Perhaps my hon. and gallant Friend will come to Scotland some time and we will then explain it to him.\n\n28The question was asked in Parliament on whether the absence of kilts in such a new unit had an effect on the recruiting figures. Emrys Hughes, a Labour MP, answered:\n\n63 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr Emrys Hughes (Labour MP for South Ayrshire), Army Act (Continuation), (...)\n\nThe honourable Member has a point there, but he will find that the number of recruits into those regiments which are allowed to wear the kilt was even fewer. I do not think that the wearing of the kilt makes the slightest difference. My hon. Friend may think that putting the whole of the British Army in kilts will bring recruits, but I do not believe that the Secretary of State for War can solve his problem in that way.\n\n30Ironically, by 1958, Scottish regiments had actually regained Scottish recruits. But four years later, one of the most decorated and well-known general officers in the British army, Marshal Montgomery of Alamein, openly criticised the traditions of the Highlander regiments as detrimental to the very organisation of the Army while it was fighting the Cold War. Hansard recorded his scathing words in the House of Lords regarding kilted men:\n\n[…] the War Office has to get out of the strait jacket which is imposed by the tight regimental system. There must be freedom to expand or contract the infantry as may be necessary; and this without giving rise to all the bitterness and turbulence that is caused by amalgamations or disbandments of old established regiments or of cutting across regimental customs. There was a case recently when a Scottish Regiment was asked to send a company of men to another Scottish regiment. They declined to do so, because, they said, the other regiment did not wear the same clothing. It is impossible to go on like that; that sort of thing must cease.\n\n31Montgomery’s solution was not just about abandoning clothing traditions, but about ending a certain type of mindset existing in Scottish units:\n\n66 House of Lords, Hansard, Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, The Statement on Defence, debate 21 March (...)\n\n(…) Turning the present brigades into big regiments of, say, six battalions, and doing away with the tight regimental system, will cause an outcry. There will be resistance, and that resistance will come mostly from what I call the “tribal areas”. Your Lordships might ask: where do these tribes live? They live mostly in Scotland, with quite a few in Northern Ireland. These tribes must be heard, of course, and then silenced, as happens in all tribal warfare. You must do that.\n\n73 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr. Gerry Fitt (MP Social Democratic Labour Party), and Mr Paul Rose (Br (...)\n\nIt may be said that the Catholic minority in Northern Ireland should not react as they do, that they should not be provoked by these Scottish bands, but this is only human nature. In the minds of many Catholics in Northern Ireland it is accepted that the Scottish people who come there on the 12th [of July], the Scottish members of the Royal Scots Regiment, are in alliance with some of the more extreme unionists.\n\n34Meanwhile, the 1970s were marked in Scotland by debates over the question of Devolution. During the same decade, the Scottish National Party, initially created in the mid-1930s, started to gather momentum after its first major electoral victory and openly campaigned in favour of independence. In response, Veterans of Scottish regiments turned politicians like William Whitelaw showed some anger when Scotland was portrayed as a separate entity. Remembering his warring days, the Conservative MP from Penrith and The Border declared in 1976:\n\n74 House of Commons, Hansard, Devolution (Scotland and Wales), debate 19 January 1976, vol. 903, col. (...)\n\nI do not believe it ever occurred to any of us for one moment that we were fighting only for Scotland. We were part of the British Army, and we were going to give of our best to preserve the freedom of Britain, our country.\n\n35In response, MPs from the SNP also tried to associate themselves to the glories of the Scottish military past:\n\n75 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr. Iain MacCormick (SNP MP for Argyll), The Army, debate 06 May 1976, v (...)\n\nDoes the hon. Member for West Lothian (Mr. Dalyell) appreciate the immense pride with which the Scottish National Party regards the contribution made by Scotsmen to the British Armed Forces during the past centuries? If we are going to be independent, clearly it will be Scotland’s duty to make some kind of contribution to the defence of the Western world, just as we have made a contribution in the past to the defence of the United Kingdom.\n\n78 House of Commons, Hansard, Ms. Diane Abbott (Labour MP for Hackney, North and Stoke Newington) Blac (...)\n\nThroughout the 1960s, there were some regiments that would not accept any black recruits. That was revealed in a War Office memorandum that was published in newspapers during that decade. The regiments that would officially accept no black recruits include the Household Cavalry, the foot guards, the Highland regiments, the Lowland regiments, the Royal Military police, the intelligence corps and the physical training corps.\n\n38In parallel, the 1980s and 1990s were marked by budget cuts and new amalgamations. In 1984, barracks at the Bridge of Don, north of Aberdeen, were closed, forcing Scottish recruits to be trained in England, ending a 200-year military tradition which had been started to create national and regional loyalties. The tradition was deemed important enough to be protected:\n\n79 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr Malcolm Bruce (Liberal Democrat MP for Gordon, Aberdeenshire), Bridge (...)\n\nThe traditions of the Scottish infantryman, the tartan, the trews or the kilt, the pipes and the drums, are an essential component of the pride of Scotland and of the backbone of the British Army. It is a worthy tradition, over 200 years old, and is not to be lightly discarded. I believe that it has been a major factor in the high level of recruitment from within Scotland. The fact that the training takes place in Scotland is also important. The lads and their parents identify with training in Aberdeen, the third city of Scotland. They know where they are. They know that they are “our boys” and not, as they will be in Newcastle, the “Jocks” who are being trained outside their own environment, and not really sustaining the full strength of the Scottish tradition, which should be carried on within Scotland, where it is the core of the infantry regiments.\n\n83 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr Menzies Campbell (Liberal Democrat MP for North East Fife), Internati (...)\n\nTo make a personal plea, one of the regiments thought to be under threat is the Black Watch, a distinguished Scottish regiment that happens to recruit in my constituency and nearby. From the point of view of recruitment in Scotland, if any such famous regiments were to be further amalgamated or disbanded, the Army might find it difficult to draw from Scotland the sort of quality and numbers that it has been able to call on in the past.\n\n85 House of Lords, Hansard, Lord Bach, Army Restructuring, debate 16 December 2004, vol. 667, col. 144 (...)\n\nAgainst this background, I have decided, as recommended by the Army, that the first three battalions should be reduced as follows. One battalion will be taken from the Scottish Division. The Royal Scots and the King’s Own Scottish Borderers will merge. This and the other four battalions –including the Black Watch– will become part of a new large regiment, to be called the Royal Regiment of Scotland.\n\n42Such a situation also evoked responses from the SNP, and one of their MPs directly addressed Tony Blair during PMQs in 2004, at a time when the Scottish party positioned itself as a serious rival to the traditional left:\n\n86 House of Commons, Hansard, Mr Pete Wishart (SNP MP North Tayside), Engagements, debate 21 July 2004 (...)\n\nYesterday the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary quite rightly paid tribute to our armed forces in prosecuting the Prime Minister’s illegal and unpopular war in Iraq. The rewards for their efforts are seemingly cuts and amalgamations, so what would the right hon. Gentleman say to my constituents serving in the Black Watch or some other historic Scottish regiment who have been put in the firing line abroad only to be stabbed in the back at home?\n\n89 Kirsty Scott, ‘SNP sees dislike of Blair as key to success’, The Guardian, 13 April 2005, https://w (...)\n\nStewart Hosie, the SNP candidate, said Labour had badly underestimated the strength of feeling over the merging of Scotland’s historic army regiments, including the Black Watch, which recruits in Tayside. “People are angry about that and it’s not dissipating,” he said. “It’s a local issue but it’s big.”"
