        "text": "THEY'RE too late to be considered for the Oscars and too early for summer vacation. If there is one dominant theme in the films scheduled to be released between the holiday and summer movie seasons this year, it's the quest. Leonardo DiCaprio is looking for the ultimate travel experience. Bette Midler is seeking fame (as are young dancers, athletes and would-be beauty queens). There are more than the usual number of road movies, romantic comedies (with characters looking for love in all the wrong places) and dramas about people trying to make a new start (several are men just out of prison). Here are some of the coming films, with opening dates that are, as always, subject to change.\n\nAGNES BROWNE Anjelica Huston directed and stars in this drama about a widowed mother of seven struggling in Dublin in 1967. March 3 (nationwide). A related article is on page 3.\n\nAMERICAN PIMP The Hughes brothers (Albert and Allen), who gave us ''Menace II Society,'' do a documentary. Men like Rosebudd, C-Note and Fillmore Slim, who manage the practitioners of the world's oldest profession, talk about their careers (''a misdemeanor crime'' offering ''felony money,'' as one says). April.\n\nAMERICAN PSYCHO Bret Easton Ellis's graphically violent novel comes to the screen as 1980's satire. Christian Bale is the amoral, label-conscious serial killer of Wall Street. Mary Harron (''I Shot Andy Warhol'') directed. April 7."
