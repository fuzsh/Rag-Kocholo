        "text": "Lillian Diana Gish was born on October 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. Her father, James Lee Gish, was an alcoholic who caroused, was rarely at home, and left the family to, more or less, fend for themselves. To help make ends meet, Lillian, her sister Dorothy Gish, and their mother, Mary Gish, a.k.a. Mary Robinson McConnell, tried their hand at acting in local productions. Lillian was six years old when she first appeared in front of an audience. For the next 13 years, she and Dorothy appeared before stage audiences with great success. Had she not made her way into films, Lillian quite possibly could have been one of the great stage actresses of all time; however, she found her way onto the big screen when, in 1912, she met famed director D.W. Griffith. Impressed with what he saw, he immediately cast her in her first film, An Unseen Enemy (1912), followed by The One She Loved (1912) and My Baby (1912). She would make 12 films for Griffith in 1912. With 25 films in the next two years, Lillian's exposure to the public was so great that she fast became one of the top stars in the industry, right alongside Mary Pickford, \"America's Sweetheart\".\n\nIn 1915, Lillian starred as Elsie Stoneman in Griffith's most ambitious project to date, Die Geburt einer Nation (1915). She was not making the large number of films that she had been in the beginning because she was successful and popular enough to be able to pick and choose the right films to appear in. The following year, she appeared in another Griffith classic, Intoleranz (1916). By the early 1920s, her career was on its way down. As with anything else, be it sports or politics, new faces appeared on the scene to replace the \"old\", and Lillian was no different. In fact, she did not appear at all on the screen in 1922, 1925 or 1929. However, 1926 was her busiest year of the decade with roles in Mimi (1926) and The Scarlet Letter (1926). As the decade wound to a close, \"talkies\" were replacing silent films. However, Lillian was not idle during her time away from the screen. She appeared in stage productions, to the acclaim of the public and critics alike. In 1933, she filmed His Double Life (1933), but did not make another film for nine years.\n\nWhen she returned in 1943, she appeared in two big-budget pictures, Commandos Strike at Dawn (1942) and Top Man (1943). Although these roles did not bring her the attention she had had in her early career, Lillian still proved she could hold her own with the best of them. She earned an Oscar nomination as Best Supporting Actress for her role of Laura Belle McCanles in Duell in der Sonne (1946), but lost to Anne Baxter in Auf Messers Schneide (1946).\n\nOne of the most critically acclaimed roles of her career came in the thriller Die Nacht des JÃ¤gers (1955), also notable as the only film directed by actor Charles Laughton. In 1969, she published her autobiography, \"The Movies, Mr. Griffith, and Me\". In 1987, she made what was to be her last motion picture, Wale im August (1987), a box-office success that exposed her to a new generation of fans. Her 75-year career is almost unbeatable in any field, let alone the film industry. On February 27, 1993, at age 99, Lillian Gish died peacefully in her sleep at her Manhattan apartment in New York City. She never married.\n\nThe man responsible for awarding the coveted Holiday Magazine Restaurant awards has been a wine writer for more than 65 years. He has also been a retailer, an artist, an actor, a restaurateur and even a flight instructor, during World War II. He is also a Buddhist monk.\n\nRobert Lawrence Balzer has always been surrounded by Hollywood celebrities and in 1978 he teamed with producer Duke Goldstone and director - writer Dennis F. Stevens to produce a number of wine programs and commercials featuring the leading wineries of France and California.\n\nAs of this writing he has a daily radio program on K-Mozart (105.1 FM in Los Angeles) and is still leading wine programs on cruise ships.\n\nRobert Lawrence Balzer was also the first serious writer-journalist in America. His love affair with wine began with Repeal, about the time he graduated Stanford and joined Balzer's, the family gourmet market on Larchmont Boulevard, just south of Paramount Studios, not far from the heart of Hollywood and mere miles from Beverly Hills. Customers included Cecil DeMille, Alfred Hitchcock, Ingrid Bergman, and Marlon Brando.\n\nIn 1936, at the age of 24, Robert Lawrence was put in charge of the market's wine department. At the time, he knew nothing about wine, but soon learned. California wines were beginning to find their way onto retail shelves, after Prohibition's 13-year dry spell.\n\nBalzer put out a customer newsletter praising the wines stocked on the shelves of the Larchmont store; Almaden, Inglenook, and Paul Mason. Will Rogers Jr., a classmate at Stanford, was intrigued by Balzer's writing and in 1937 asked him to write a wine column for his newspaper, the Beverly Hills Citizen.\n\nAfter writing the first of his 11 books on wine, Robert Lawrence began branching out. He started writing for Travel Holiday magazine, which published his articles for more than two decades and until recently Balzer was the person responsible for granting the coveted Holiday Magazine Restaurant awards. In 1964, he began writing a weekly column for the Los Angles Times Magazine. A few years later, he launched Robert Lawrence Balzer's Private Guide to Food and Wine, quite likely the first wine newsletter in America.\n\nRobert Lawrence also has a spiritual side. Since the early `50s he has studied Buddhism, at one time at a temple in Cambodia where he was ordained a teaching monk. Indeed, teaching may be his greatest passion. Over the years winemakers have made regular pilgrimages to speak to Balzer's classes, which have developed an almost cult like following among students.\n\nAt his annual birthday parties, those lucky enough to be invited mingle with owners of the world's greatest wineries, who fly to Southern California, and the City of Tustin, for the event.\n\nA British filmmaker who, over the years, worked as assistant director, cinematographer, producer, writer and ultimately director, Ronald Neame was born on April 23, 1911. His father, Elwin Neame, was a film director and his mother, Ivy Close, was a film star. During the 1920s, he started working at famous Elstree Studios. One of his first jobs was assistant cameraman for Alfred Hitchcock on Erpressung (1929), the first talking picture made in England.\n\nNeame became a cinematographer during the 1930s. In 1942, he and sound designer C.C. Stevens received a special effect Oscar nomination for One of Our Aircraft Is Missing (1942), a film by the Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger team. In 1944, after working together on In Which We Serve (1942), Neame, David Lean and producer Anthony Havelock-Allan formed a production company, Cineguild. The screenplays for its films Begegnung (1945) and Die groÃen Erwartungen (1946) received best writing Oscar nominations.\n\nAfter a fall-out with Lean and the demise of Cineguild in 1947, Neame turned to directing with Das rettende Lied (1947). As a director, he would be quite versatile, touching genres like comedy (Der Unwiderstehliche (1952), Agentenpoker (1980)), psychological studies (Das Haus im Kreidegarten (1964)), musical (Scrooge (1970)), thriller (Die Akte Odessa (1974)) and even disaster movies (Die HÃ¶llenfahrt der Poseidon (1972), the one that started the trend, produced by Irwin Allen). Under Neame's guidance, Alec Guinness won the best actor trophee at the 1958 Venice festival for Des Pudels Kern (1958), a comedy based on a book adapted by Guinness himself. Two years later, John Mills received the same award for Einst ein Held (1960), also directed by Neame. In 1969, Maggie Smith got her first Oscar for Die besten Jahre der Miss Jean Brodie (1969) under Neame's direction, and in 1970, Albert Finney got his first Golden Globe for his role in Neame's \"Scrooge\".\n\nIn 1996, Neane was awarded Commander of the Order of the British Empire in recognition for his contributions to the film industry. In 2003, he published his autobiography, \"Straight from the Horse's Mouth\". Keeping up the family tradition, his son Christopher Neame is a movie producer and his grandson, Gareth Neame, works for the BBC. Ronald Neame died at age 99 of complications from a fall on June 16, 2010 in Los Angeles, California.\n\nFrench actress RenÃ©e Saint-Cyr became synonymous with chic comedy and costumed drama, enjoying major success for nearly seven decades before her death after an attack of bronchitis at age 99. Over the years she equipped herself well opposite the established talents of Raymond Rouleau, Jules Berry, Raimu, NoÃ«l-NoÃ«l, Harry Baur, Pierre Brasseur and Paul Meurisse.\n\nBorn Marie Louise EugÃ©nie Vittore on November 16, 1904, and the daughter of a hotel owner and opera singer, RenÃ©e was a one-time model who married Charles Leopold Lautner (1894-1938), a wealthy man, at age 21 before entering the acting leagues. After studies at a drama school in Marseilles, she made her film bow starring as one of Les deux orphelines (1933) co-starring Rosine DerÃ©an, based on the Gish sisters' silent classic Zwei Waisen im Sturm (1921). She took on Lillian's role and would adopt the moniker of Saint-Cyr, supposedly taken from a beloved canine.\n\nSaint-Cyr's alluring beauty, patrician demeanor, and comedic skills gave her great momentum co-starring in such chic 1930's film comedies as Toto (1933), D'amour et d'eau fraÃ®che (1933), Une fois dans la vie (1934) (Once in a Lifetime), Der letzte MilliardÃ¤r (1934), Paris (1937), L'Ã©cole des cocottes (1935), Donogoo (1936), Paris (1937) and Die Perlen der Krone (1937), as well as the dramas 27 rue de la Paix (1936) and Prisons de femmes (1938).\n\nRenÃ©e also graced the stage during this time in a production of \"The Threepenny Opera,\" among others. She nixed an offer to sign with 20th Century-Fox, but did star in England's Strange Boarders (1938) and Italy's Dunkelrote Rosen (1940) (Red Roses) co-starring Vittorio De Sica. Into the 1940s war years, she starred in such popular film vehicles as the Hector Berlioz biopic Phantastische Symphonie (1942) (The Fantastic Symphony), the title dramatic roles in Marie-Martine (1943) and PamÃ©la (1945), plus Pierre et Jean (1943), Patricia (1946) and ...und sowas nennt sich Detektiv (1946).\n\nSaint-Cyr left films after shooting Le chevalier de la nuit (1953), Il cavaliere di Maison Rouge (1954) (The Glorious Avenger) (as Marie Antoinette) and Si Paris nous Ã©tait contÃ© (1956) (as Empress EugÃ©nie}, but returned into the next decade with Coctail party (1960) and Der junge General (1962). By this time, her only child, Georges Lautner, had become an influential film writer and director and had begun churning out a series of standard genre movies that occasionally featured Renee in the cast. Such films included Monocle blickt voll durch (1964), Das Millionen-Duell (1967), Quelques messieurs trop tranquilles (1973), Ein Tolpatsch auf Abwegen (1976), Ils sont fous ces sorciers (1978), Attention une femme peut en cacher une autre! (1983), Room Service (1992).\n\nChances are, if you saw a movie with one of the stars of the 1930s or 1940s, her hair was done by Carmen Dirigo, who passed away on July 25 in Van Nuys at the age of 99.\n\nDirigo, born Daisy Obradowits, was a prominent hair and wig stylist in Hollywood's Golden Age, working at the various studios and later in television. Among her stable of stars were Joan Bennett, Yvonne De Carlo, Joan Fontaine and her sister, Olivia de Havilland, Ann Blyth, Elena Verdugo, and many others.\n\nShe was born in New York on December 30, 1907 and moved with her mother Lilley to Southern California in the 1920s. Soon after, Lilley started a beauty shop on Cahuenga in Hollywood while Carmen went to school. But the younger Dirigo had show business dreams. From an early age, she worked as a dancer at the Egyptian, Chinese, and Pantages theaters doing prologue shows before feature films ran.\n\nAt Carmen's urging, Lilley finally attempted to get into the movie business during the last years of the silents. \"I kept after her, but she was very shy,\" Carmen recalled in 1999. \"One day, she went and made an appointment at Universal with Carl Laemmle and she sold him on the idea of having a hairstylist established on the lot. She told him that she once saw a picture where the actress is out in the rain, and when she comes in, her hair is all dry. She told him that he could have someone established on each picture to read the script and follow the story and do it accordingly. He thought that was brilliant, and that's how it all started.\"\n\nBy 1933, after taking a state test to get her cosmetology license, Carmen followed her mother and entered the hairstyling field, first working at United Artists. After four years, she moved to Paramount where she first worked with stars like Fontaine and Fredric March. Eight years later, she came to Universal as head of hairstyling, where her mother had broken ground working with legendary makeup artist Jack Pierce, famous for Universal's slate of classic monster films.\n\nOf the rapid pace of the classic studio days, Carmen remembered the structured approach to the work. \"They didn't have time to talk about stuff then,\" she said. \"We would get there early, and have to rush to get people out on time. If I had wigs to do, I'd have to be there at 6:30AM and take the wigs off the block. Max Factor's on Highland and three wigmakers out of Universal would ventilate the wigs. Then, I would style them the night before.\"\n\nOne of her biggest challenges at Universal was the 1948 film, Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid which featured underwater photography of star Ann Blyth. \"The producer wanted her hair to look as beautiful underwater as out of the water.,\" she recalled. \"I had to get together with a chemist to figure out what we could use that would be pliable in the water. For days, before the picture started, I would be in my department with a fishbowl, and I'd have a hunk of hair which I waved first and sprayed with this chemical. I'd plunk it in the water and swish it around and see if it held the curl. When it did, I knew that it was okay.\"\n\nWhile at Universal, Dirigo served as president of the Cinema Hairstylists, an elite association, and was the first hairstylist in the business to get screen credit. In 1951, the nascent television medium beckoned, and she moved to TV on shows including Fireside Theater, which ran until 1955. Around that time,, she did several episodes a CBS show called You Are There, which recreated significant moments from history. For an episode which aired in April, 1955, using wigs and makeup, she and Jack Pierce transformed actor Jeff Morrow into Abraham Lincoln for a staged recreation of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nDirigo's last job in the business was as hairstyling department head for TV's Petticoat Junction, where she worked until 1970. She retired to her house on Coldwater Canyon Boulevard in Van Nuys where she lived the rest of her life. Until a severe fall at home in 2000 left her partially immobilized, Dirigo was an avid equestrian and enjoyed watching her Academy screeners on VHS tapes. She leaves behind no living heirs.\n\nHer legacy, along with her mother's, was creating firm aesthetics for women's hairstyles in films that remains to this day. One Universal press release from 1946 stated: \"She is a firm believer in frequent hair style changes and in the choice of simple styles for business and sportswear. Elaborate hairstyles should be created only for evening and formal occasions, she recommends.\""
