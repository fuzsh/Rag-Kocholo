        "text": "ALPHA CANIS LUPUS\n\nunread,\n\nto The Unreleased Recordings\n\nhttp://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Hank-Williams-Biography/C81BE43BE06698BA4825697B003352BD\n\nposts from other forums | Reviewer: blair mays | 1/1/2008\n\nTo set the case right the 55th anniversary of Hank Williams\n\ndeath is Dec 31, 1952.....not the Jan. 1 1953 date that his 1rst\n\ndriver Andy Carr has been using all the years to cover his tracks.\n\nWhat Carr did on the last day of 1952 borders on negligent homicide.\n\nHe has been profiting shamelessly.\n\nAlong with Jimmy Rodgers before him he is perhaps the most important\n\nwhite figure to bring the black American tradition of blues to a white\n\naudience. On the last day of 1952 the most popular tunes of the day\n\nwere world war II vintage big bands--and then there was Hank whose\n\npopularity was only beginning to snowball. After his death his\n\npopularity became an seismic event. All modern American popular\n\nmusic forms date to this last day of 1952. His last popular band\n\ntunes are right there on the edge of rock and roll if you listen\n\nclosely. In fact his guitarist was recording with Elvis less than\n\na year later. Bob Dylan has recently bought up some of his un-\n\nfinshed stuff and in the tradition of Robert Johnson he may chart\n\na half a century after his death.\n\nHere is an eyewitness account of his death. His death was closer to\n\nthat of Elvis than you might have imagined.\n\nHank's first driver has become a principal with the Hank Williams\n\nmuseum when, actually he may have commited the crime of negligent\n\nhomicide\n\non that last day of 1952. I am an eyewitness\n\nand will no longer have peace until the truth about Carr is known.\n\nHere are the facts . The date of death was Dec.31, 1952 not Jan. 1,\n\n1953\n\nDriver Carr and Hank evidently left Khoxville on Dec 30--not Dec31\n\n1952 as I remember them arriving in Bluefield at the King Tut Drive-\n\nIn at about 10 am on Dec 31, 1952.\n\nThere is an arrest record in Tennessee for which Carr was cited for\n\nspeeding which should settle that. There is a story that Hank\n\nobtained morphine (or whatever) from a Dr. Horton in Bluefield--\n\nthis doctor was repeatedly busted for dispensing drugs without a\n\nprescription or perfunctorally, thru-out the 50's. I have no\n\nway of verifying that but can testify to the following.\n\nI was in and out of the Tut all day as was my usual itinerary those\n\ndays, and observed Hank with one and maybe no more than 2 beers--\n\nof which he drank little or none. I did observe Hank injecting\n\nsomething into his arm in while sitting in the back seat of the\n\nCadillac less than hour before his death (about 4 pm Dec 31, 1952).\n\nIn fact Driver Carr sent me inside the Tut to get Tut owner Sox\n\nWhite ; Sox tried to get Hank to withdraw the needle, but the\n\ndamage was already done. Less than an hour later Carr sent me\n\nin to get Sox again. Sox came out and checked Hank's pulse and\n\nthen went back inside and got a mirror which he placed under\n\nHank's nose. (Sox's wife was nurse at he hospital in town). He\n\ntold Carr \"this man is dead and get him the hell off premises as\n\nhe didn't want an trouble here\". Carr left and only came back\n\nto the Tut after he reported Hank's death about 12 hours later\n\nand 50 miles up the road at Oak Hill WV. Hank's cadillac and\n\ntwo or three police cars were at the Tut from about 5-9 pm the\n\nnext day Jan 1, 1953. Sox and waitress Hazel Schultz paid 2\n\nvisits to the car business next door that belonged to my dad and\n\nforcefully insisted that I shut up and stay out of the Tut while\n\nthe cops were there.\n\nThe reason why Carr and Hank spent the day at the Tut was that\n\nthey were waiting for Bluefield taxi driver Danny Surface to get\n\noff taxi duty. Snow was flying and the weather was turning bad.\n\nPre-Interstate WV roads were extremely treacherous in those days\n\nand Carr had driven over 2 mountains, each of which took about\n\nan hour at 15 mph in good weather--the second mountain\n\nimmediately before Bluefield.\n\nThe connection of the second driver was made at the Tut--Danny\n\nSurface was waitress Hazel Schultz's boyfriend. Hank and\n\noriginal driver Carr went uptown at about 12pm Dec 31 to the\n\nDough Boy Diner where taxi drivers hung out between rides-- to\n\narrange for Surface to take over driving duties (to Charleston\n\nWV). Carr and Hank returned to the Tut before 1 pm.\n\nAs the name indicates the Doughboy was your typical WWI joint\n\nand was quite derelic by then. The Tut was your stereotypical\n\nWWII WV beer joint. It was built with a surplus quonset hut in\n\n1945 but was paneled in real hardwood inside and was quite a\n\nplace with a wrap-around bar. Sox had a stainless steel kitchen\n\nand had the best short orders in town.\n\nAbout 20 -30 people saw Hank there that day--but no one paid too\n\nmuch attention to Hank except Hazel Schultz--who swooned and\n\nacted much like and rock and roll groupie from the 60's. Hazel\n\nhad left at about 3pm to work a shift at the already mentioned\n\nDoughboy. (ie she double shifted all the way through the 50's\n\nand became owner of the Tut after Sox died in the 70's). The\n\njuke box was extremely dull in 52 except for left-over WWII swing\n\ntunes and 2 or 3 of Hank's tunes. After Hank died several\n\nmore of his tunes became hits. A Hank tune was playing on the\n\nart deco Juke when he first came in that morning and through-out\n\nthe day.\n\nHank was extremely sick the whole day and spent most of time\n\nleaning on the counter. He was ejected by Sox after Hazel left\n\nat about 3pm for fighting. Driver Car was outside in the\n\nCadillac running the heater while it happened. A bar regular\n\nwas dancing on the dance floor with his girl friend to a Hank\n\ntune and drunkenly started beating her up on the floor. Hank\n\njumped up from the bar stool and got between them. The drunk\n\nwho was about 280lbs hit Hank hard with an uppercut to the nuts.\n\nSox always responded to these things with a butcher knife waving\n\nover his head and EJECTED HANK INSTEAD OF THE DRUNK-- afterall\n\nthe drunk was a REGULAR. Most of those barflies who saw Hank\n\nthat day didn't believe it was actually him. Some like Sox\n\ndidn't care or condidered as just a \"washed up radio singer\" who\n\nhad just been ejected from the Opry. Superstar Hank didn't\n\nemerge until agter his death.\n\nIt was common knowledge around Bluefield that Hank was at the\n\nTut and at the Doughboy the day of his death during the 50's\n\non up into the 60's. The local newspaper was right beside the\n\nDoughboy in those days and never printed anything about his death\n\n, but merely reprinted an article from Oak Hill. Maybe the drug\n\nconnection was too much, but there is no way they couldn't have\n\nknown. In about 59-60 Patsy Cline and Hank's first wife paid the\n\nTut a short visit. Hazel and Sox paid my dad a visit and told me\n\nto keep my mouth shut. Patsy Cline had gone to beautician's\n\nschool in Bluefield right before her Career took off less than a\n\nmile from the Tut. By the late 60's the common knowledge based\n\non first hand experience was waining with death of the Tut patrons\n\nof the early 50's.\n\nIt is pretty certain that taxi driver Danny Surface didn't know\n\nthat Hank was already dead when he took over as driver from Carr.\n\nIt is unknown what they did with the dead Hank in the back seat\n\nfrom about 5 or 6 pm Dec 31 until the death was reported about 12\n\nhours later. Evidently there was an arrangement with Hank's\n\nproperty in the trunk as Surface admitted selling 2 handguns\n\nbelonging to Hank on several occasions when he stopped by my\n\ndad's carlot during the 50's and 60's. He was very slight of\n\nbuild and oftentimes wore one of Hank's white handmade cowboy\n\njackets until his death. This jacket is the same one as that\n\nwhich appeared on a record jacket cover.\n\nIf you examine the 50's version of the death you will see Danny\n\nSurface mentioned in all the accounts including that of the\n\nundertaker. He is listed as the driver at the time of the death.\n\nLater accounts by Carr delete him altogether or alternately list\n\nhim as being picked up in Tennessee--where he never lived in his\n\nlife--he was a life-long resident of Bluefield. Early accounts\n\nby Carr mention \"a stop\" at the Doughboy (which was off the main\n\nroad unlike the Tut) . Later accounts after Surface died eliminate\n\nany mention of stopping in Bluefield at all.\n\nI am willing to take a lie detector test to verify these facts.\n\nI would like to see Carr do the same thing and own up to negligent\n\nhomicide for not taking Hank to the hospital after Sox ejected them\n\nfrom the Tut. He has been living on Hank's legend since Dec 31,\n\n1952.\n\nBlair Mays\n\nafterword;\n\nAndy Carr sold posters for Hank's Dec 31, 1952 concert at Charleston\n\nWV and Jan 1, 1953 concert at Canton Ohio (out of the trunk of\n\nHank's Cadillac) for years afterwards. The single most celebrated\n\nperson (aside from the Cadillac last ride at these anniversary bashes\n\nat the Hank Williams Museum in Alabama is none other than Andy Carr.\n\nAfter Hank was ejected from the Tut he got Carr to open\n\nthe trunk of the Caddy.... Andrew Carr sent me inside to get\n\nowner sox White and both stopped Hank from going back inside.\n\nBluefield driver Danny Surface made it known that he had 2\n\nof Hank's pistols. He said he sold them to a to-remain-\n\nanonymous Nashville \"personality\" in the late 50's. He wore\n\nHank's white jacket oftentimes until (Surface's) death in the 70's.\n\nWithin about 15-20 minutes he self-administered the fatal dose\n\nand Carr sent me back in to get Sox.\n\nYou can trace Carr's ever-changing version of the truth with a\n\nlittle research yourself--even on the internet. If I had gone\n\nto the police I would have been unwelcome in the Tut from then\n\non. Even my mother warned me not to get involved. What set me off\n\nwas the 50th anniversary story and Carr's profiting on what\n\nis really negligent homicide and more.\n\nLot's of people around Bluefield knew at least one aspect of\n\nHank's last day in Bluefield up into the late 60's-70's. I'm\n\npretty sure Patsy Cline was among them. For me I'm perfectly\n\nwilling to take a lie detector test of any kind on the issue\n\nof Hank's last day in Bluefield WV--something which I am sure\n\nCarr will never do. Better move expeditiously if interested as\n\nI have a cancerous tumor .......B Mays\n\nAfter owner Sox White couldn't find any pulse, he ordered\n\nfirst driver Carr off premises. Carr didn't take Hank\n\nto the hospital but left in the direction of downtown\n\nBluefield..... Carr called the promoter of the Carleston\n\nWV gig (scheduled for that night 8 or 9 pm [Dec 31, 1952]\n\nand informed the promoter that Hank would not be able to\n\nmake it.\n\nIf Hank was dead at 4-5pm (it was still daylight) the call\n\nwas made at about 6pm. Carr never mentioned that Hank was\n\npresumably dead. There is on-line proof of this call in\n\na WV state magazine publication ie Goldenseal which can be\n\ngoogled. The call was made from Bluefield.\n\nHank spent his last day (Dec 31, 1952)very sick the entire\n\nday. He had a sandwich or two before him and some open\n\nbeers--of which he partook little, if any of either. I made\n\nit my business to know such things in those days as I was\n\nwas running errands for change (soft drinks, hamburgers,beer\n\netc)for the business next door(a car lot). When Hank ordered,\n\nI hit him up for a soda. He had no change at all as Carr had\n\nall his money. He gave me a guitar pick instead.\n\nDonny Surface was the name everyone knew him by around Bluefield.\n\nHe was a life-long resident of Bluefield and never lived in Tennessee.\n\nHe was a life-long boyfriend of Hazel Schultz and taxi driver in town.\n\nHe was an extremely thin guy like Hank and in fact wore Hank's jacket\n\naround Bluefield for years until his death in the 70's. He was Hazel\n\nSchultz's boyfriend all those years even though she was married and\n\ndivorced a couple of times. Donny Surface made it known that he had\n\n2 of Hank's pistols (for sale) for years and said he did sale them to\n\n\"a Nashville personality\" (ie to remain anonymous) in the late 50's.\n\nHe visited my father's car lot many time until his death.\n\nIf memory serves me Hank and Carr left Knoxville about midnight Dec\n\n30. Today the drive to Bluefield is about 4 1/2 hours. Route 11\n\neven in those days was relatively straight and even had a few 4-laned\n\nstretches, but at Wytheville route 52 to Bluefield was extremely slow-\n\nespecially in the winter. Two mountains, Big Walker and East River\n\ncould\n\nhave taken an hour each pre-interstate.\n\nIt could have taken as much as 8 hours in 1952. In fact they arrived\n\nright at opening time at King Tut in Bluefield at about 10 am\n\nDec 31. Carr may have been familiar with the Tennessee to\n\nRoanoke route (where he lived for years) but the mountains were\n\nsnow covered and must have scared him to death. He asked Hazel\n\nfor he could fine an experienced driver--she recommended Donny.\n\nLater at noon she left for the Dough Boy where she double-shifted.\n\nHank and Carr spent the day at the Tut except for a trip up town\n\nto meet Surface. Surface agreed to drive but didn't get off until\n\n5 or 6. Owner Sox ordered Carr off premises when he couldn't find\n\na pulse between 4-5 pm. Obviously Carr didn't take Hank to the\n\nhospital.\n\nBut he did manage to call the Charleston WV promoter\n\nto tell him that Hank couldn't make the 8 or 9 pm gig there. He\n\ndidn't mention that Hank was dead......\n\nAfter 4-5 pm Dec 31 I have no further knowledge. However Carr was\n\nback at the Tut with the Cadilac about 5pm the next night..Jan 1,\n\n1953.\n\nHank's truck was full of items that were later sold by Carr and\n\nSurface.\n\nWhen Sox put a mirror under Hank's nose and could detect no breath and\n\nchecked Hank's pulse and found nothing( his wife was an RN at a\n\nBluefield hospital).... and then ordered Carr off premises.....Carr\n\ndidn't take Hank to the hospital ...but waited to pickup Surface who\n\nwas coming off a taxi shift....\n\nAn Abingdon Va. man offered to give me a Hank poster for a museum\n\nwhich is still available... he bought this poster in the 50's from\n\nCarr.\n\nWhat Carr did would still be considered negligent homicide in many\n\nplaces. Since he is a principal at the museum where the car is--\n\nhonor him for his truthfullness if you wish.\n\nThe day Carr and Hank came in Dec 31 Carr never introduced himself\n\nand told me to leave Hank alone when I was talking to him. When\n\nhe wanted me to run several errands to Sox he referred to me as\n\n\"kid\" , never bothering to learn my name. I became aware of his name\n\nonly later.... Over the years he has used \"Andrew\" and Charles.\n\nThe old man with poster called him \"Andy\". His story has changed\n\nover the years drastically . On the internet you can check it if you\n\nplease. Most of the time he has lived around Roanoke Va before\n\nmoving back to Alabama.\n\nThe fact remains he left Knoxville around midnight(ie Dec 30) and he\n\nmade a call to the Charleston WV promoter cancelling that Dec 31 gig\n\nat about 6 pm Dec 31....without ever mentioning that Hank was dead;\n\nthis article is on-line in the WV state magazine Goldenseal\n\nDON HOLLAND20313 NETTLETON STREETORLANDO, FL 32833"
