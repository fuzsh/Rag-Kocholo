        "text": "Hank Williams was born in Georgiana, Alabama in 1923. At just age fourteen, Hank stood up and sang on the courthouse steps in Montgomery, Alabama.\n\nTall, lean and good looking, he quickly became the uncontested star of country music. He joined the 'Grand Ole Opry' in 1949, and for the next three years, he enjoyed unparalleled commercial success and triumph, but tragedy in the form of drugs; alcohol; and marital distress also followed this country singer/songwriter.\n\nHits from the Hank Williams catalog include “Your Cheatin’ Heart”, “Move it On Over”, “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry”, “Ramblin’ Man”, “My Heart Would Know”, “Kaw-Liga”, “Cold, Cold Heart”, “Lovesick Blues”, “Honky Tock Blues”, “There’ll Be No Teardrops Tonight”, “Mind Your Own Business”, “Jambalaya (On the Baou)”, “Wedding Bells”, “Hey, Good Lookin’”, “Window Shopping”, “Settin’ the Woods on Fire”, “I Can’t Help It (If I’m Still In Love With You)”, “Half As Much”, “Why Don’t You Love Me”, “You Win Again”, “May You Never Be Alone”, “Baby, We’re Really in Love” and “Take These Chains From My Heart.”\n\nJust as Country music was reaching a post WW1 peak with songs crossing over into the Pop area, Hank Williams died of a Heart Attack on January 1, 1953 in Oak Hill, West Virginia. In 1961, Hank was elected a member of the Country Music Hall of Fame, the Rock N' Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters' Hall of Fame."
