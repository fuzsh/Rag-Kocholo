        "text": "OAK HILL, W.Va. — A crowd honored the memory of Hank Williams on Thursday in Oak Hill during a presentation ceremony of a memorial plaque. Williams was declared dead in the West Virginia town, after being discovered unresponsive in the back seat of his Cadillac while being driven to a gig on New Year’s Day in 1953. He was 29.\n\nOn Thursday, the final leg of a tour that began in Williams’ hometown of Montgomery, Alabama, concluded in Oak Hill. The tour was running in conjunction with the new movie “I Saw the Light,” which opens today in select theaters and chronicles Williams’ rise to fame and its tragic effect on his health and personal life."
