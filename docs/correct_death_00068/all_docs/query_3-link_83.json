        "text": "PRINCETON, W.Va. — Princeton was dominant in all phases en route to a 37-7 win over Oak Hill in a Class AAA first round matchup at Hunnicut Stadium. The No. 5 Tigers (10-1), who have posted their third 10-win season in school history, will host No. 13 Parkersburg in next weekend’s quarterfinal round.\n\n“We had a goal. We came out and we did what we needed to do,” said Princeton head coach Keith Taylor. “I am just so happy. It is not about me, it is about these kids and this community. Look behind me — they are dancing. That’s what it is about.”\n\nPrinceton scored the final 30 points in the game, breaking a 7-7 tie late in the first quarter when Chance Barker connected with Bradley Mossor on the first of their two touchdown tosses [65 and 62 yards]. Barker passed for 223 yards and three scores.\n\n“He knows the offense as well as our offensive coordinator. Chris Belcher does an incredible job. I would put him up there with some of the best offensive coordinators in the state. He and Barker have a great relationship. Barker understands what we are doing and he makes great decisions.”\n\nSenior Dom Collins reeled in his 21st touchdown catch of the season in the third quarter.\n\n“That’s Dom Collins. He wins games by just being out on the edge. Even if he doesn’t touch the football, it changes the complexion of whatever they do defensively.”\n\nPrinceton defeated Oak Hill, 42-28 on September 8. The Tigers adjusted their defensive front for this matchup.\n\n“Kudos to Eric McClanahan, our first-year defensive coordinator. He made a switch and put four men down. You saw that we were playing gap contain football. That’s what helped us secure the win. We didn’t do that the first time.”\n\nThe Tigers hosted their first playoff game since 2002, which was the last time the Tigers advanced to the state quarterfinal round.\n\n“Everybody is buying in and it is a community thing. I think the Lord is moving into our community and I think that, at the end of the day, is what is causing this success to happen.”\n\nOak Hill’s touchdown came courtesy of a 9-yard Malachi Lewis-to-Armonyi Hicks touchdown toss in the first quarter. The eight wins for the Red Devils (8-3) are the most for the program since 2013."
