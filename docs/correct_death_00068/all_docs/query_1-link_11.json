        "text": "BLAINE, Tenn. — The teenager in the driver’s seat looked tired and nervous. The man in the back seat looked dead.\n\nThe state trooper shined his flashlight around the Cadillac through the falling snow, reached to open the car door. No, begged the driver, don’t wake him up. He’s sick. Don’t you know who he is? That’s Hank Williams.\n\nThe trooper shrugged. All right. You’re still getting a ticket. Happy New Year.\n\nSeven hours and 240 miles later, an emergency room intern in Oak Hill, West Virginia, declared the country music icon dead at age 29. Hiram King “Hank” Williams, who made more than a million dollars over his five-year recording career, died with a few dollars in his pocket and left behind a legacy as the most venerated country singer-songwriter of all time.\n\nHe also left a trail of questions and contradictory stories that weave a shroud of mystery around the entertainer’s final hours, stretching from downtown Knoxville’s Andrew Johnson Hotel to the Oak Hill emergency room. Six decades and change later, only scattered details from that midnight ride through a New Year’s Eve 1952 snowstorm remain beyond dispute. Ken Burns’ recent documentary on country music didn’t even touch the controversy.\n\nEXPLORE OUR COUNTRY MILE SERIES\n\nTracing the lost highway\n\nAttempts to trace the path of Williams’ last ride bump up against one dead end after another of legends and half-truths. The Cadillac stopped here — and here, and there. The great man ate his last meal here, drank his last beer there, spoke his last words (maybe) near this spot. He died in Knoxville — or in Blaine, Bristol, Bluefield or somewhere else along the way. Each place claims the credit.\n\nCharlie Carr, the 17-year-old college student hired to drive Williams that night, told his version of the story hundreds of times over the decades — never consistently. He died in 2013, still insisting only he knew what really happened. Swan Kitts, the Tennessee Highway Patrol corporal who stopped the Cadillac on Rutledge Pike that night, wrote the only official investigative report on Williams’ death — a report that didn't surface until decades later.\n\n“There are more than a dozen stories about that night, no two of which can be true,” said Jack Neely, director of the nonprofit Knoxville History Project. “And I don’t know of any story in Knoxville’s history that has so many different versions. But in a way, if it were cut-and-dried, maybe people would have already stopped talking about it.”\n\nA canceled flight\n\nHe might have made it if not for the blizzard.\n\nHeavy snow north of Knoxville forced the plane out of McGhee Tyson Airport to turn back from its flight to Charleston, West Virginia, where Williams was scheduled to play a New Year’s Eve show.\n\nThe plane landed in Knoxville again just before 6 p.m. Carr helped Williams load his luggage back into the blue ragtop Cadillac they’d driven up from Montgomery, Alabama, the day before, then headed into town.\n\nThe pair checked into the Andrew Johnson Hotel on Gay Street in downtown Knoxville just after 7 p.m. Dan McCrary, the night manager, described Carr as “nervous” already and Williams as so drunk two porters had to carry him to the room.\n\nWhatever hopes Carr had for what started as the road trip of a lifetime were sinking. Williams, a friend of his father, had hired him as chauffeur for the drive from Montgomery to Charleston and on to Canton, Ohio, where they still hoped to make a New Year’s Day show. The money for the driving job would cover his college tuition.\n\nWilliams by December 1952 was fighting his way back up from the bottom. He’d snagged the No. 1 spot on the Billboard charts earlier that year with his mega-hit “Jambalaya (On the Bayou)\" and held it for 14 weeks. That hadn’t kept the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville from firing him for chronic no-shows.\n\nHis marriage to Audrey Williams had ended and left him so broke he sold tickets to his second wedding and staged it twice. And even though he’d just checked out of a sanitarium, Williams, who began drinking as early as age 10, couldn’t kick his addiction to alcohol, morphine and chloral hydrate, a notoriously dangerous sedative.\n\nThe man who’d penned and performed such classics as “Your Cheatin’ Heart” and “Hey Good-Lookin’” weighed barely 130 pounds as he climbed delicately into the blue ragtop Cadillac on Dec. 30, 1952. He sat bent for most of the ride, in constant pain from failed back surgery to remedy the malformed spine that had plagued him from birth. Now he was going to miss the Charleston show and stood to pay a penalty if he failed to make the Canton gig.\n\nAn early checkout\n\nCarr ordered two steaks from room service. Williams’ went untouched.\n\nCarr would later insist Williams wasn’t drunk — just sick, tired and hit with a sudden convulsion of hiccups.\n\n\"I had never seen such a severe case,” Carr told Knoxville News Sentinel writer Wayne Bledsoe in 2002, just before the 50th anniversary of Williams’ last ride.\n\nWhen the hiccups wouldn’t stop, Carr called for the house doctor, Paul H. Cardwell, who gave Williams two shots of morphine mixed with B-12. Carr helped him to bed. At some point Williams rolled out of bed and banged his head on the floor.\n\nAround 10:30 p.m., the phone rang. The promoter for the Canton concert told Carr the snow was getting worse; hit the road now or forget about making the New Year’s Day show. He’d already sold more than 4,000 tickets and Williams had better be there.\n\nCarr tried to rouse Williams, with no success. He finally called the porters to help him dress the insensible star and lug him to the car in a wheelchair.\n\nBy all accounts, Williams “was lifeless as they put the clothes on him,” Kitts, the state trooper, later wrote. “Williams never moved at all. He seemed to make a coughing-like sound (only twice) as they carried him, but was lifeless and didn’t move.”\n\nCarr checked out of the Andrew Johnson at 10:45 p.m. and headed north on Gay Street toward Magnolia Avenue. Darkness and sometimes blinding snow would make for poor visibility. He recalled almost no other cars on the road.\n\nHe had 600 miles to go with the king of country music either dead or dying under a blanket in the back seat.\n\nAn unscheduled stop\n\nOutside the city limits, Carr followed Magnolia to Rutledge Pike. The four-lane highway of today barely resembles the two-lane route Carr followed north and east through the snow that night, the pavement growing ruttier with each mile.\n\nNeely says he heard years ago from a woman who claimed the Cadillac stopped that night at an East Knox County beer joint run by her husband. According to the story, two men stopped for beer — a teenager (Carr) and a hitchhiker in Army uniform. Williams never left the back seat.\n\n“I was never able to verify it,” Neely said. “I’ve heard a lot of those kinds of stories, and I haven’t heard any one story that sounded more plausible than the other.”\n\nAround 11:45 p.m., the Cadillac crossed the Grainger County line into Blaine, about 20 miles above Knoxville. Carr tried to pass a truck and nearly slammed head-on into a Tennessee Highway Patrol cruiser in the process.\n\nThe trooper, Kitts, pulled the Cadillac over and immediately noticed the man lying motionless in the back seat. The stammering, anxious teenager behind the wheel made him more suspicious.\n\n“Carr said he was driving Hank Williams,” Kitts wrote. “I asked Carr if he could be dead, as he was pale and blue-looking. But he said Williams had drunk six bottles of beer and a doctor had given him two injections to help him sleep.\n\n“He asked me not to wake him up as he was very sick and looked that way. &mldr; Carr had a soldier with him at the time.”\n\nKitts wrote Carr a citation for reckless driving and ordered Carr to follow him to Rutledge, the county seat, about 15 miles up the road. The justice of the peace on duty, O.H. Marshall, found Carr guilty and fined him $25 and court costs, all with Williams lying still as a stone in the back of the Cadillac.\n\nBy some accounts, Carr walked out to the car to fish the payment out of Williams’ wallet; Carr insisted he paid the fine from his own pocket. The sheriff, J.N. Antrican, and Kitts murmured to each other about the situation but didn’t interfere.\n\n“He paid the fine, thanked us and left at about 1 a.m.,” Kitts wrote.\n\nBurgers in Bristol\n\nCarr always claimed he made the drive from Knoxville to Bristol alone with Williams in the back seat. No authorities ever tracked down the soldier, unidentified in official records.\n\n“Maybe I had a Greyhound bus in the back seat of that Cadillac for all the people who were supposed to be with me that night,” Carr said later. “There wasn't anybody else there but me, so how would anybody know what happened but me?”\n\nIf Carr’s recollection was right, he spent the next couple of hours driving through the dark in silence along U.S. Highway 11W as the road wound through Bean Station — later the scene of the infamous “Bloody 11W” Greyhound bus crash — into Hawkins County, through Rogersville and across the Sullivan County line through Kingsport to Bristol on the Tennessee-Virginia border.\n\nAs the Cadillac rolled down State Street around 2:30 or 3 a.m., Carr, who hadn’t slept in nearly 24 hours, would have seen the neon sign for the Burger Bar, an all-night diner on Piedmont Avenue across from a taxi company. He later swore he asked Williams if the singer was hungry.\n\n“He just thought he was gonna get some sleep,” Carr said in 2002.\n\nCarr claimed in some interviews Williams even got up to walk around, which hardly matches the condition described by Kitts just hours earlier. No witnesses in Bristol claimed to have seen Williams there. Carr went looking for a relief driver and found one — Don Surface — but couldn’t remember later whether he picked up Surface in Bristol or at the Dough Boy diner in Bluefield, 90 miles up the road across the West Virginia line.\n\n“It’s not too surprising that his memory failed, to be 17 years old and going through that kind of experience,” Neely said. “That would scramble anybody’s brain.”\n\nBill Archer, a retired reporter and editor for the Bluefield Daily Telegraph, recalls hearing the story of Williams' visit from Hazel Schultz, a waitress at the Dough Boy, and a few of the diner's regulars. Schultz spent the rest of her life telling the story of how she waited on Hank Williams that morning, even though he never set foot inside.\n\n\"It was Charlie Carr she waited on, but he was wearing a cowboy hat and she believed to her dying day he was Hank Williams,\" Archer said.\n\nOne of the customers, now dead, told Archer he walked out to the Cadillac to offer Williams a cup of coffee.\n\n\"He said, 'No thanks.' It was not a grunt,\" Archer said. \"He was definitely alive.\"\n\nThe Cadillac made at least one more stop in Princeton, West Virginia, where Carr said he let Surface out, even though witnesses reported seeing the cabbie with him later. Outside Oak Hill, Carr reached a gas station and noticed the blanket had slid off Williams.\n\nHe reached back and brushed against an arm that had gone cold and stiff.\n\nA trail gone cold\n\nAn autopsy at the Oak Hill hospital listed the cause of Williams’ death as heart failure. Tests on blood samples from that same autopsy found no drugs and only traces of alcohol in the troubadour’s system. Rigor mortis suggested Williams died long before the Cadillac reached Oak Hill.\n\nA knot on the dead man’s skull and bruises on his groin led to an inquest by a coroner’s jury, which ruled the death due to natural causes.\n\nKitts, the state trooper, later questioned the doctor, the night manager and the porters at the Andrew Johnson and wrote up a report reconstructing the hours before the traffic stop in Blaine. That report surfaced in the 1980s, apparently recovered from loose files in the Union County courthouse in Maynardville, where Kitts later served as sheriff.\n\nHis verdict? Williams drew his last breath before he left the Andrew Johnson.\n\n“I think that Williams was dead when he was dressed and carried out of the hotel,” Kitts wrote. “Since he was drinking and was given the injections and could have taken some capsules earlier, with all this he couldn’t have lasted over an hour and a half or (at most) two hours. &mldr; Taking all this into consideration, he must have died in Knoxville at the hotel.”\n\nBiographers of Williams like Colin Escott and Chet Flippo have generally agreed with the trooper’s conclusion, but Carr denied it to the end.\n\n\"If he was dead, it was a dead man walking around in Bluefield or Bristol when we stopped later,\" he said in the 2002 interview.\n\nA plaque on the wall of the Andrew Johnson, now converted into offices, commemorates Williams’ stay there but doesn’t delve into the details of where he died. No sign marks the spot on Rutledge Pike where Kitts stopped the Cadillac and peered at what might have been a corpse.\n\nThe Burger Bar in Bristol, no longer a 24-hour operation, still serves up burgers and shakes, each named for a Hank Williams hit, and celebrates its claim as the place where the singer spoke his last words. In Bluefield, the Dough Boy’s gone, long ago torn down.\n\nBus tours loaded with sightseers sometimes make the pilgrimage along U.S. Highway 11 through Knoxville, Bristol and beyond to follow in Williams’ steps.\n\n“Being the place where someone died is not normally something to be proud of,” Neely said. “It’s hard to tell which story is true.”\n\nIf Carr held back any details about that last ride, he took them to the grave.\n\n“I have continually told the truth, and still people write what they want,” he told Bledsoe in 2002. “People can write what they want to write. People can believe what they want to believe, and I just can't do anything about that.”"
