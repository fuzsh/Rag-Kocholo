        "text": "Singer Born Sept. 17, 1923 in Georgiana, Ala.\n\nHank Williams is considered one of the most influential country music artists of the 20th century. The popular country singer and composer in the 1940s and early 1950s earned the label \"King of Hillbillies\" from his followers.\n\nWilliams sang mountain ballads in a nasal voice, accompanying himself on guitar, which he learned to play at age 6. The lanky singer shot to fame with the song \"Lovesick Blues.\" Recorded in 1948, the song reached number one on Billboardâs top country singles and sold more than 1 million copies.\n\nHis other most popular songs included \"Cold, Cold Heart,\" \"Wedding Bells,\" \"Mansion on the Hill,\" and \"Move on Over.\"\n\nHe died suddenly at the age of 29, while traveling to a New Year's Day concert in Ohio. A coroner's jury ruled that the death was a result of hemorrhaging and a heart condition, but alcohol was found in Williams' system."
