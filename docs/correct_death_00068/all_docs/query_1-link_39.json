        "text": "It’s in Montgomery where Hank Williams started serenading America with his songs on love, anguish, passion and tangled despair.\n\nWhile Williams’ boyhood home is in Georgiana, just down the highway, his career took off as a teenager in the state capital. He touched nearly every downtown street corner. It’s practically impossible to find a block where a Williams’ tale can’t be told.\n\nHere are a places known and some not-so-well known with ties to Williams as his birthdate Sept. 17, 1923, is celebrated.\n\nElite Café, 121 Montgomery St.\n\nThe Elite (pronounced E-light) opened in 1911 and was run by the Xides family. It was the place to eat for decades in Montgomery (it even had its own postcards), and it was once hard to imagine downtown without it until it closed in 1990. Here, Williams sang publicly for the last time on Dec. 28, 1952, while attending an American Federation of Musicians holiday party.\n\nAfter he was asked to sing, he belted out “Jambalaya,” “Cold, Cold Heart,” “You Win Again,” and “Lovesick Blues.” About 150 were in attendance, according to a Montgomery Advertiser account two days later.\n\n“We listened attentively as if attending a concert by Benny Goodman or hearing the cultivated voice of some operatic star,” Tom Hewlett, president of the federation, wrote in a letter to the Advertiser editor published Jan. 11, 1953.\n\nMunicipal auditorium, 103 N. Perry St.\n\nWhere the City Council meets now is where thousands paid their final respects Sunday, Jan. 4, 1953, to Williams. They were inside and outside what was then called Municipal Auditorium.\n\nCity Hall, when it was a performance facility, sat about 3,000. Williams’ family rented the facility to give his adorning fans an opportunity to see him.\n\nEvery seat was filled for Williams’ funeral, and another 20,000 were estimated to be outside trying to get their way in. Four women fainted, according to a newspaper account, and renowned musicians Ray Price, June Carter and Bill Monroe were among the attendees.\n\nThe Rev. Henry Lyons, who was pastor of the Highland Avenue Baptist Church, said during his sermon that when Williams played his guitar, he “played on the heartstrings of millions of Americans.”\n\nJefferson Davis Hotel, WSFA radio, 344 Montgomery St.\n\nWilliams’ mother ran a boarding house just down the block on Catoma Street from the hotel where WSFA radio had studios and Williams performed as the \"Singing Kid.\"\n\nHis weekly pay for appearing on WSFA radio when he was 14 was $15 for twice weekly performances, according to the Montgomery Advertiser archives.\n\nMore: Hank Williams: An Alabama legend rooted in Montgomery\n\nBy 1946 when his popularity was skyrocketing, Williams’ radio appearances drew crowds in the hotel lobby, disturbing the guests, according to “I Saw the Light: The Story of Hank Williams,” by Colin Escott.\n\nWilliams also wasn’t known for being dependable. “WSFA &mldr; tolerated him as a necessary evil,” Escott wrote. The station’s leaders couldn’t understand his draw, but “they simply knew they couldn’t afford to lose him,” according to the book.\n\nHank Williams statue, 216 Commerce St.\n\nThe statue honoring Williams was moved in October 2016 from Lister Park across from City Hall to where it stands now at the intersection with Tallapoosa Street.\n\nIt took more than 1,800 hours for Texas-based sculptors Doug and Sandra McDonald to create the 6 foot, 2 inch high piece. The bronze sculpture was erected on Sept. 17, 1991, and Williams’ son, Hank Jr., came to the dedication.\n\nWhen the statue was unveiled, the Hank Williams Museum was just in discussion and the only local public tributes to Williams were his grave and a small exhibit at the state archives, according to the Advertiser archives.\n\nHank Williams Museum, 118 Commerce St.\n\nWilliams died on New Year’s Day 1953 in the back seat of his 1952 Cadillac. He was headed from Tennessee to a scheduled concert in Canton, Ohio.\n\nThe driver, Charles Carr, pulled into a gas station in Oak Hill, West Virginia, and found Williams unresponsive in the back seat.\n\nWilliams’ blue Cadillac is one of the items you can see during a tour of the popular downtown museum.\n\nGrave, 1304 Upper Wetumpka Road\n\nTwo days after Williams' funeral in 1953, a Montgomery Advertiser article noted that 50 to 300 people per hour were coming to his grave in Oakwood Cemetery Annex to pay tribute to him. Some ripped flowers from the wreaths as souvenirs.\n\nAnnually, fans still gather on his birthday and the anniversary of his death to remember the singer who was known as the “Hillbilly Hammerstein” and the “Hillbilly Shakespeare” because he wrote so honestly about the human experience.\n\nSidney Lanier High School, 1756 S. Court St.\n\nIt’s apropos that Williams, who wrote romantically about hard living, tormented thought and languishing love, would briefly attend a school with the Poets as a mascot.\n\nWilliams dropped out of Lanier in October 1939 after just a brief enrollment, opting to focus on his blossoming music career with the Drifting Cowboys.\n\nHe was 16 at the time and sleeping through class after playing honky-tonks all night, according to a column that Allen Rankin wrote for the Montgomery Advertiser on the day of Williams’ 1953 funeral.\n\n“Luckily your sleep was sound in English class,” Rankin wrote. “A bit of language polish might have ruined the wonderful, natural speech of your singing.”\n\nEmpire Theater, 234 Montgomery St.\n\nThe Empire Theater is gone, and the Rosa Park Library and Museum sits where the theater once stood.\n\nIn December 1937, Williams’ family and friends persuaded him to take a shot at a $15 prize during an amateur contest.\n\nThe teen played “WPA Blues,” an original. He won. His career soon took off, playing local radio stations WCOV and WSFA.\n\nChris’ Hot Dogs, 138 Dexter Ave.\n\nWilliams, like many in the past 100 years since it opened, had a love affair with the food at Chris’. He also liked the booze they sold.\n\nWilliams was known to frequent the joint often late at night after gigs to sober up in a back booth, owner Gus Katechis tells customers.\n\nThere is another story too of him at age 13, sitting by the jukebox, playing guitar and entertaining more people inside while a parade was going by outside. More people were interested in the singing kid. Not much has changed."
