        "meta_description": "1 review and 3 photos of HANK WILLIAMS DEATH MONUMENT \"Hank Williams was a singer, songwriter and musician. He is regarded as one of the 20th century's most important and influential American singers and songwriters. Williams produced 12 singles that peaked at No. 1, three of which were released after his passing. He also produced 55 singles that made it into the top 10 of the Billboard Country & Western Best Sellers chart, five of which were released posthumously.\n\nHere are three of his greats, \"Hey Good Lookin'\" https://youtu.be/bjCoKslQOEs and \"I'm so lonesome I could cry\" https://youtu.be/4WXYjm74WFI. Here's Ray Charles covering \"\"You Win Again\" https://youtu.be/OPxxG31JOCg.\n\nHe was found dead in the back seat of his baby blue Cadillac after his driver stopped for gas and food while he was traveling between performances. In front of the town library, close to the location of the gas station, this monument was built to commemorate this tragic event.\n\n[Review 19614 overall - 88 in West Virginia - 585 of 2023.]\"",
