        "text": "Just before sunrise on New Year's Day 50 years ago, a sleek baby-blue Cadillac roared up to the rural Oak Hill, W.Va., hospital in the cold Appalachian darkness. The driver was 17, exhausted and scared. The passenger was barely 29 and dead.\n\nAt the wheel was Charles Carr, a college freshman on Christmas break from Auburn University. The man in the back seat was singer-songwriter Hank Williams Sr.\n\n\"I ran in and explained my situation to the two interns who were in the hospital,\" said Carr, now a 67-year-old Montgomery businessman. \"They came out and looked at Hank and said, \"He's dead.' \"\n\nLong before there was Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Kurt Cobain or even James Dean _ self-destructive stars who flamed out at their zenith _ there was Hiram \"Hank\" Williams, a hard-drinking, rough-around-the-edges Alabama country boy who wrote simple, heart-tugging songs about loneliness and then, still young, died alone in the back seat of a car.\n\nThe last hours of his troubled life long ago passed from reality to myth. Biographers have breathlessly speculated about what really happened. Officials have issued sketchy reports that only increased the mystery. Songwriters and playwrights still rhapsodize about it. An off-Broadway play, Hank Williams: Lost Highway is running in New York. A Web site dedicated to Williams estimates that more than 700 songs have been written about the singer, whose recording career lasted five years.\n\nCarr, who until recently pretty much kept quiet about that day, thinks Williams died somewhere between Bristol, Tenn., and Oak Hill on the way to a New Year's Day 1953 show in Canton, Ohio. The official cause of death was heart failure.\n\n\"I'm certainly not an authority on Hank Williams,\" Carr said. \"But I'm the only authority on Hank Williams' death.\"\n\nBy the time Carr got behind the wheel of Williams' ragtop Cadillac on Dec. 30, 1952, the troubadour's life was in a full-tilt meltdown. He was divorced from his first wife, Audrey. Though remarried, he was staying at his mother's downtown Montgomery boardinghouse, having been demoted from the Grand Ole Opry to the Louisiana Hayride, the farm team of country music. He was taking morphine shots for constant back pain after major surgery the year before (he suffered from spina bifida), ingesting a dangerous sedative, chloral hydrate, to sleep and playing the same backwater clubs he'd escaped just a few years earlier.\n\nWilliams knew Carr's father, who ran a Montgomery taxi service, and the teenager was asked to drive an obviously ailing Williams to gigs in Charleston, W.Va., and Canton, major concert dates that Williams hoped would be the start of a comeback.\n\nCarr recalls that the 6-foot-2-inch Williams was sick and frail at the time, weighing perhaps 130 pounds, but disputes reports that the singer, long a heavy drinker, was guzzling booze most of the trip.\n\n\"He had a very low tolerance for alcohol at that point,\" Carr said.\n\nCarr remembers Williams being in good spirits as the trip began. They told jokes, sang songs and traded tales as they navigated the two-lane highways of the pre-interstate South.\n\nThey spent the night at a hotel in Birmingham and got an early start on New Year's Eve as the weather worsened.\n\nWilliams decided to try to catch a flight from Knoxville to make the Charleston show on time, but it was turned back because of the bad weather.\n\nCarr got them a hotel room, and they checked in about 7 p.m. to wait out the storm.\n\n\"We talked awhile and ordered dinner up in the room,\" Carr said. \"As I remember, Hank didn't eat much of anything. He had the hiccups real bad.\"\n\nCarr called a doctor, who gave Williams two injections, later determined to be morphine mixed with vitamin B-12.\n\n\"He calmed down after that, but looking back, maybe the hiccups or the indigestion could have been the beginning of a coronary,\" Carr said.\n\nAbout 10:30 p.m., Carr got a call from the concert promoter telling him they had to leave right away and drive through the night to make the Canton show.\n\nAfter midnight, the teenager stopped in a small town to gas up and get a bite to eat. Carr said it could have been Bristol, Tenn., about 120 miles northeast of Knoxville, or it could have been Bluefield, W.Va. It was dark, and he was bone-tired in unfamiliar territory.\n\n\"I remember Hank got out to stretch his legs, and I asked him if he wanted a sandwich or something,\" Carr said. \"And he said, \"No, I just want to get some sleep.'\n\n\"I don't know if that's the last thing he said. But it's the last thing I remember him telling me.\"\n\nCarr drove on but became increasingly concerned about the eerie silence in the back seat. He pulled off the road to check on Williams.\n\n\"He had his blue overcoat on and had a blanket over him that had fallen off,\" Carr said. \"I reached back to put the blanket back over him, and I felt a little unnatural resistance from his arm.\"\n\nCarr pulled into the next service station he saw and told the owner he needed to get to a hospital fast. The man pointed the way, and Carr remembers seeing a road sign for Oak Hill, 6 miles away.\n\nCarr will attend a New Year's Day memorial service for Williams at his much-visited grave in Montgomery's Oakwood Cemetery Annex. A few surviving members of Williams' Drifting Cowboys band will be there as well. They are old men now, some in their 80s.\n\nA visitor observes that Carr has survived the years about as well as the old Cadillac, which has been immaculately restored. Carr laughs at the suggestion.\n\n\"No, no,\" he said. \"I'm an old man. But Hank Williams never had to worry about that. He'll always be young to me.\""
