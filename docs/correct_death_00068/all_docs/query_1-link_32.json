        "text": "\".while still\n\n\"He lies, as if in dewy sleep he lay;\n\n\"Awake him not! surely he takes his fill\n\n\"Of deep and liquid rest, forgetful of all ill .\"\n\n-- Percy Bysshe Shelley, \"Adonais\"\n\nOn Dec. 30, 1952, Hank Williams began preparing for what was to be his last trip.\n\nHe downed a few drinks with some building contractors at a Montgomery hotel. Then he dropped by a friendly doctor's office for a shot of morphine.\n\nHe'd remembered beforehand to pack along the tablets of prescription chloral hydrate from Walgreens. And of course, there was a bottle of booze in the car.\n\nHe wouldn't be feeling his back pain, at least not for a while.\n\nHank was heading to a New Year's Eve gig in Charleston, W. Va., and a New Year's Day performance in Canton, Ohio. It was a long way to ride, but he'd hired an Auburn freshman, 18-year-old Charles Carr, to do the driving. And Hank was probably happy to get out of Montgomery.\n\nHis mama, Lillie, wasn't getting along with his new wife, Billie Jean. That was putting it mildly; they'd been close to tearing each other's eyes out at Lillie's boarding house.\n\nTo tell the truth, Hank and Billie Jean weren't getting along all that well, either. They fought like cats and dogs.\n\nPart of the problem was a woman named Bobbie Jett who Lillie had holed up at another of her boarding houses. Jett was pregnant with Hank's child.\n\nThat gave Lillie a little leverage. She was demanding money from Hank to expand her boarding house network. But Billie Jean said no way.\n\nLillie hated Hank's former wife Audrey too, bless her cheatin' heart. So did Billie Jean. Ol' Hank was just glad to be on the road again.\n\nCarr, the son of a Montgomery taxi company owner, had chauffeured him before. Williams had some reservations about using him for a trip this long; Carr drove a little too bit adventurously, even for Hank.\n\nBut right now, Williams was feeling no pain.\n\nLeaving Montgomery in the afternoon, they motored in Hank's flashy, baby blue Cadillac convertible up U.S. 31 and hit Birmingham that evening, according to author Colin Escott, whose book \"Hank Williams\" was the genesis for a sterling documentary last year.\n\nHank intended to spend the night at the Tutwiler, Birmingham's finest hotel. Carr, however, did an illegal U-turn and a cop pulled him over.\n\nThe policeman wasn't impressed that Hank Williams was a passenger. He told Carr he'd better move on.\n\nCarr wound up driving Williams a few blocks further to another hotel, The Redmont. It was no Tutwiler; like Williams, it had a reputation.\n\nThirty minutes after Hank checked in, three women were in his room, offering companionship to the famous singer.\n\n\"Honey,\" he asked one of them, \"where are you from?\"\n\n\"Heaven,\" she purred.\n\nHank laughed. \"Well in that case, you're the very reason I'm going to hell.\"\n\nMaybe that was prophetic. Within the next 36 hours, Hank Williams' body, blue and lifeless, would land on the doorstep of an unsuspecting small-town funeral home operator, Joe Tyree, in Oak Hill, W. Va.\n\nTyree turns 79 next month. But in his mind, the events of Jan. 1, 1953, remain as vivid as the imagery of some Williams' best songs.\n\nNot that Tyree cared much for country music. He says he didn't give it a second thought when the hospital called him to come pick up Hank Williams' body.\n\n\"We got a lot of Williamses that live in our area, so I mean -- they just simply said they had the body of Hank Williams,\" he says. \"They didn't elaborate on the address or anything about it. I don't even know that they knew who he was at the time.\"\n\nTyree has been telling his story for more than a half-century to anyone who asks. He's always careful to note that Hank didn't actually die in Oak Hill.\n\n\"He was pronounced dead here, he didn't die here,\" says Tyree. \"They are two different things. He died en route, probably somewhere between Bluefield, W. Va., and Oak Hill, W. Va., is my figuring.\"\n\nThe distinction is important to many in Oak Hill, where the town's signal historical event -- bigger than the arrival of the post office in 1859 or even the 1905 municipal incorporation -- remains a source of controversy. More than a few residents don't want their beloved hometown to be forevermore known to the world as the place where Hank Williams died.\n\nAnd Tyree, whose grandfather started the family mortuary business in a barn at Maynor, W.Va., is right. Hank died on the road. But exactly where and how may be debated until the cows come home.\n\nWilliams and Carr got up early on the morning of Dec. 31 and left Birmingham, driving north. The weather was going bad. When they made Chattanooga, it was snowing.\n\nBy late morning, when Carr pulled into Knoxville, Hank knew he couldn't make the gig at Charleston on time in his Cadillac. He told Carr to head for the airport, where they bought tickets for a 3:30 p.m. flight to the West Virginia capital.\n\nBut the weather was worsening. The airplane had to turn back in midflight and by 6 p.m., he and Carr were back on the ground in Knoxville.\n\nThe New Year's Eve gig was blown. Too blue to fly. Hank hit the bottle as Carr drove to the Andrew Jackson Hotel.\n\nBy the time they arrived, Williams wasn't able to walk up the steps. Escott writes that two hotel porters hefted Hank up like a carpet and hauled him off to his room. They dumped him on a bed, where he lay, fully clothed, until he rolled off and hit the floor.\n\nHe ate a little bit. Then he started hiccupping something awful.\n\nClearly, it was time for a doctor's intervention. One was summoned and Hank received two fresh injections of morphine, mixed with some vitamin B-12.\n\nCarr, meanwhile, called the concert promoter to tell him the bad news: Hank couldn't make Charleston in time for the show. OK, the promoter answered, but he'd better damn well make Canton. More than 4,000 advance tickets had been sold.\n\nTime was running short. It wouldn't do, obviously, to spend the night in Knoxville.\n\nThe hotel porters were called; they carried Hank, virtually comatose, back down to the Cadillac, and Carr hit the road again.\n\nIt was around 10:45 p.m.\n\nAbout an hour later, right outside of Blaine, Tenn., Carr had another run-in with the law. A Tennessee highway patrolman said the Auburn student pulled out to pass on the two-lane highway and almost ran headlong into him. He turned on his light and pulled Carr over.\n\nHe noticed there was another guy, slumped in the seat, who didn't look so good. Later on, the patrolman said it reminded him of some of the corpses he'd seen in his line of work.\n\nBut Carr explained that his passenger, the famous Hank Williams, had passed out after a beer and some sedatives. It wouldn't do to wake him.\n\nThe patrolman clicked off his flashlight and told Carr to follow him to a justice of the peace kangaroo court down the road.\n\nCharged with speeding and dangerous driving, Carr was quickly tried, found guilty and sentenced to pay $25 in fines plus court costs. He forked over the money and got back in the Cadillac with Hank. It was now around 1 a.m., New Year's Day.\n\nCarr stopped in Bristol, on the state line, where he hired a temporary relief driver at a local taxi stand. They headed north again.\n\nA few hours later, the Cadillac pulled into a restaurant in the village of Hilltop, a few miles south of Oak Hill. Carr says he looked in the back seat and noticed that Hank's blanket had slipped off. When he reached to put it back on, he said, he noticed Williams had turned cold and blue. He tried to take his hand, but Williams' arm sprang back -- a telling sign of rigor mortis.\n\nAlarmed, Carr went inside the cinderblock caf√© for help. An older man came out, took a good look at Hank, and turned to Carr.\n\n\"I think you've got a problem,\" he said.\n\nCarr gunned the Cadillac for Oak Hill, where he had been told there was a hospital. He stopped off at the Pure Oil station on the outskirts of town to get directions. He says he also told the manager to call law enforcement authorities. Then, he says, he drove straight to the hospital.\n\nHowever, an Oak Hill police officer says that he was summoned to the Pure station, where he saw a lifeless Hank in the Cadillac. To confuse matters further, the relief driver claims that he accompanied Carr to the station and that it was he, not the manager, who called the police.\n\nWhatever the case, Hank wound up at the Oak Hill Hospital emergency room, where an intern pronounced him dead at 7 a.m. The intern said from the looks of the body, Williams might have been dead for as long as six hours.\n\nThat's when Joe Tyree, the local mortician, got the call.\n\n\"At that time, the state of West Virginia did not have a medical examiner system,\" he says. \"So what we had to do was call the prosecuting attorney. He, in turn, got a hold of the justice of the peace and impaneled a jury after we received the body from the hospital.\n\n\"They convened and looked at it and decided they needed to have an autopsy done.\"\n\nThere was cause for concern. Hank had a big welt on his head, for one thing -- probably the result of his fall from his bed in Knoxville. Later on, the funeral home employees noticed the needle marks in his arms.\n\nA pathologist came from nearby Beckley to do the autopsy, Tyree says.\n\n\"Then after that,\" he says, fast-forwarding through the story, \"the panel came back the next day and looked at his findings and saw no problem and no foul play was involved and released the body.\"\n\nTyree says he put Carr up with some of his ambulance drivers and the young man spent New Year's Day watching football on TV. Meanwhile, Hank's family and associates were descending on Oak Hill.\n\nHank's mother, Lillie, and Carr's father got there first. They flew from Montgomery to Roanoke, Va., where they hired a taxi to drive them to Oak Hill, arriving late in the morning Jan. 2.\n\nBillie Jean, in Shreveport with her parents, arrived with her father a few hours later. By then, Lillie already had plucked all the valuables off Hank's body, including his wedding ring.\n\nAnd she wasn't the only one snatching and grabbing.\n\nLocal lore says a guy at the Pure Oil station pilfered Hank's cowboy hat. The thief went bald soon afterward. Doctors attributed the loss of hair to a jungle infection he'd gotten in World War II but it established the myth that the hat would similarly curse all who wore it.\n\nSomeone else apparently lifted Hank's pearl-handled revolver. Neither item has ever surfaced again.\n\nTo add to the indignities, a quack physician who supplied Hank with drugs showed up from Canton with a bill for more than $700, Escott says. Neither Lillie nor Billie Jean would pay him off.\n\nLillie told Tyree to dress Hank in his white stage outfit after the body was embalmed. She also arranged with Tyree to drive Hank's remains back to Montgomery in a hearse. Then she and the Carrs headed for home in Hank's Cadillac.\n\n\"At that time, in 1953, you didn't have the availability of flying human remains by plane,\" Tyree says. \"So it was either take it by train or take it by car.\n\n\"We left here probably 4 or 5 o'clock in the evening and got there [to Montgomery] around 7 the next morning.\"\n\nIt rained all the way, cold lonesome teardrops from the sky. News about Hank's death already had blanketed the South.\n\n\"When we got down into Alabama and stopped for gas, they would see the West Virginia plates and want to know if we were carrying Hank back home,\" Tyree says.\n\nHome was still the same old battlefield.\n\nBillie Jean would have liked to have died when she found Hank's former wife Audrey and Lillie ransacking the boarding house for original lyrics and manuscripts. According to Hank's sister, she got on the telephone with a Shreveport attorney.\n\n\"Get up here,\" Billie Jean hollered into the receiver, \"this old gray-haired bitch is trying to steal all of Hank's stuff from me!\"\n\nHank's sister wrote, \"Mother told me that if I did not get her out of the house, she would kill her.\"\n\nIn fact, according to Escott, Lillie and Billie Jean got into a wrestling match in the bathroom. Billie Jean said she climbed up on a toilet to take a better swing at Lillie.\n\nTyree, like Hank, was happy to leave the women to fight it out. After depositing the body in Montgomery, he went straight home.\n\nBut Hank's legacy won't leave him alone.\n\n\"Yessir,\" he says, \"we get calls all the time. For 52 years, I still get calls from people stopping by. I had a feller here two weeks ago, stopped in Lynchburg, Va., came up with his wife and he brought his 80-something-year-old father just to see the place where Hank was -- taken from.\"\n\nNot died.\n\n\"I don't get tired\" of talking about it, Tyree adds. \"I mean, after all these years, it still doesn't bother me.\"\n\nDoes he consider himself a Hank Williams fan? Tyree responds with an uncomfortable moment of silence.\n\n\"Well, what do you mean by that?\" he asks.\n\nFor instance, does he like Hank's music?\n\n\"I wasn't into country-western music,\" Tyree replies thoughtfully. \"Still am not. I am not into that type of thing. But I do listen to him when he's on TV now or on a record or whatever .\"\n\nHe's outlived Hank by a good 50 years. Bright and nimble, he still goes to work every day.\n\n\"I don't smoke, drink or chew,\" Tyree explains. \"I never have did that. I try to eat three square meals a day. I try to keep a check on everything.\"\n\nIn short, he didn't have much in common with the man who history deposited on his doorstep.\n\n\"Nope, I just handled the arrangements and -- I guess as the old saying goes, we were at the right place at the right time,\" he chuckles.\n\nWayne Flynt, Auburn professor and author of the recently published book \"Alabama in the Twentieth Century,\" will speak Monday at the University of Alabama's Gorgas Library on the music of Hank Williams. His 3:30 p.m. address on the second floor of the library is open to the public.\n\nReach Editorial Editor Ben Windham at 722-0193 or by e-mail at ben.windham@tuscaloosanews.com."
