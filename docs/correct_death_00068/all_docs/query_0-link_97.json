        "text": "In the pantheon of spectacular drunks, Hank Williams surely ranks superlative. By all accounts, his was the sort of drunkenness (injurious, shambolic) that a responsible person would be reluctant to equate with any kind of generative impulse—to link, even tenuously, to the construction of transcendent art. Yet it’s hard to spend any time with Williams’s discography, which consists of thirty-one country-and-Western singles released over a six-year period (augmented, posthumously, by unissued material), and not be felled by the resignation and longing that animate his voice. Obliteration begins to feel like a justifiable, necessary corrective to the sort of suffering his songs express. It’s hard not to eventually catch yourself thinking, “A whiskey might be nice!”\n\nIn his short life, Williams was often a repository for other people’s anguish, beckoning it without effort. His fans recognized something broken in his work (four of those thirty-one singles have the word “lonesome” in the title) and equated that recognition with knowing. “I reckon they think I’m some sort of Red Cross,” is how the actor Tom Hiddleston puts it while playing Williams in “I Saw the Light,” a recent bio-pic of the singer. Anger, misery, sorrow, shame: that’s what Hiddleston’s Williams thinks his listeners feel in his work, and what they believe he can soothe.\n\nCountry music has long been the terrain of the lonely and the broken-down. That rubbery twang, the baying: it communicates something about the travails of the heart, the way it lurches and somersaults. The animating flash for that pain is often religious—born of friction between what the body wants (whiskey, sex, vengeance) and what the mind has vowed to forsake (whiskey, sex, vengeance). We can circumvent the path toward sin, divert the energy somehow, but it’s extraordinarily difficult to rewire the circuit entirely—to stop wanting. From the gap between what’s desired and what’s indulged, whole songbooks are made.\n\nThere’s maybe no better symbolic embodiment of those tensions than Williams, who was born in Alabama, in 1923, and died on New Year’s Day, 1953, in Oak Hill, West Virginia, following a cardiac event in the back seat of his Cadillac. He’d been carried to the car by his driver, coughing and hiccupping, delirious on some combination of beer, morphine, and chloral hydrate, a prescription sedative. In his brief tenure as a performer, Williams sold eleven million records, saw seven lovelorn singles reach No. 1 on Billboard’s country-and-Western chart, and played hundreds of shows. He is still regarded as a pinnacle within the genre, a high-water mark for sad-sack troubadours. What he wanted and what he needed never quite added up.\n\n“I Saw the Light” opens with Hiddleston performing an a-capella version of “Cold, Cold Heart,” a song Williams wrote (or, more accurately, adapted; the melody is lifted from Buddy Starcher and T. Texas Tyler’s version of “You’ll Still Be in My Heart”) in 1950. According to “Hank Williams: The Biography”—the book, by Colin Escott with George Merritt and William MacEwen, that “I See the Light” uses as its source material—Williams’s first wife, Audrey, discovered she was pregnant with their second child while Williams was travelling the country on a Grand Ole Opry-sponsored tour. Apparently, there was some uncertainty as to whether Audrey’s baby was also her husband’s; she scheduled an at-home abortion, but became ill after the procedure. When Williams visited her in the hospital, she was livid, hurt: “You sorry son of a bitch. It was you who caused me to suffer this,” Escott reports her saying. The actress Elizabeth Olsen, who plays Audrey in the film, delivers the lines with incalculable vitriol. Williams drove back to their home and announced to his children’s governess, Miss Ragland, that Audrey possessed “a cold, cold heart.”\n\nThe story might be apocryphal; it doesn’t much matter. The phrase itself—the certainty and the cruelty of it—is what got Williams to open his notebook. The first verse introduces a brutal quagmire:\n\nI tried so hard, my dear, to show that you’re my every dream\n\nYet you’re afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme\n\nA memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart\n\nWhy can’t I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart?\n\nWilliams is at his best when he taps into a struggle that might have otherwise gone unspoken—in “Cold, Cold Heart” it’s the challenge of fighting off some unseen and inscrutable enemy, of vanquishing whatever spooked and damaged his lover—and then makes it seem common, a shared predicament. Not being enough to convince a person—that’s a hard thing to hold in mind. “Cold, Cold Heart” identifies the paradox (“The more I care for you, the more we drift apart”), and then gently recounts the impossibility of trying to conquer that kind of rival.\n\nTony Bennett covered “Cold, Cold Heart” in 1951, which delighted Williams. He’d play Bennett’s version—lifted up by maudlin strings, and sung at a crooner’s clip—on restaurant jukeboxes, grin crazily, and yell, “Hot damn!” Bennett’s version is lovely, but also deliberately mawkish, contained. There’s remarkable anguish in the way Williams holds onto the word “apart” for a beat too long, like he’s failing to let go of someone after a hug. Williams’s hot and nasally tone was often at odds with his studio band (usually a crew of unflappable Nashville session players, the purest pickers in the world), and his records are pocked with idiosyncrasies, moments of true dissonance. He was, in his way, untamable.\n\n“I See the Light” is explicit about certain details—like Williams’s tendency to garnish every meal with a cannonball of tomato ketchup—but coy about others. The film sometimes struggles to make clear how strange and electrifying Williams’s work was, the way it reached all kinds of people, despite his dubious pedigree (“Too much trouble and too hillbilly by half,” is how Escott describes him). He suffered through a long-undiagnosed case of spina bifida occulta, a disorder of the spinal column; his condition was aggravated by a hunting accident, which is heard but not seen in the film. His death doesn’t occur onscreen, either—it’s made evident via funeral footage, but the circumstances are ultimately left for the audience to extrapolate. I suspect, in this case, the precise moment of corporeal undoing was something nobody wanted to get too close to or linger on. Then, we’d have to reckon with exactly what it meant: that one man’s sadness could subsume him, while buoying the rest of us."
