        "text": "The year was 1952. Carr, a seventeen-year-old college boy from Alabama, had been hired to drive an ailing Hank Williams, 29, to concerts in Charleston, West Virginia, and Canton, Ohio. Having departed from Montgomery in Williams' baby blue Cadillac on December 30, the pair spent the first night of their trek in Birmingham. The following day, they left for Charleston, but began encountering wintry weather conditions by the time they reached Chattanooga. Upon arriving in Knoxville, the two decided to catch a plane to Charleston, but bad weather forced the flight to return. With the New Year's Eve show in Charleston now out of the question, they secured a room at Knoxville's Andrew Johnson Hotel, and hoped to make it to Canton by the following evening. Carr indicated that Williams was ill and very weak, and would hardly eat. A physician was called in, and the singer was given two injections. Some time over in the evening, they received a telephone call from the promoter of the Canton concert who reminded them of a clause in the contract that would penalize Williams if he didn't make the show. So, Carr and Williams left Knoxville before midnight, and it was somewhere between Bristol, Virginia, and Oak Hill, West Virginia, just hours later, that Hank Williams died of heart failure in the back seat.\n\nIn the film, The Last Ride (2011), a combination of facts and fiction portray Hank Williams' last three days. Williams' chauffeur, played by Jesse James, is known as Silas (instead of Charlie Carr, his real-life counterpart), and upon arriving in Knoxville the pair check into the fictitious Belmont Hotel instead of the Andrew Johnson."
