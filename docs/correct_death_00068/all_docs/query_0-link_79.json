        "text": "A recent article on the MoneyInc website named a small town in West Virginia the number one most peaceful place to live in the entire nation. Can you guess which town that is? Of course you can! We’ve known the answer for years, and you probably have, too: Green Bank. As the home of the world’s largest fully steerable radio telescope and located in the heart of the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, it’s no wonder that it’s the quietest, most peaceful place in, well, pretty much the entire world! But here’s a newsflash: Green Bank isn’t the only peaceful or safe place to live we’ve got up our sleeve here in Almost Heaven, West Virginia, folks. Not by a long shot.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course, just because Oak Hill in West Virginia is such a safe, peaceful place to live doesn’t mean its never seen any excitement: in 1953, for example, Hank Williams was discovered dead in the back seat of his car in this tiny West Virginia town. In fact, you can actually eat a hot dog in that very same parking lot when you visit Oak Hill if you wish. Learn more about Oak Hill on the city’s Facebook page.\n\nWant more West Virginia in your inbox?\n\nGet the latest on things to see, do, and eat around West Virginia!\n\nspinner\n\nThank you!
