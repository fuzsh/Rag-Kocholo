        "text": "Every autumn since 1993, George Tennant has traveled from England to Montgomery to absorb its Hank Williams history.\n\n“I fell in love with Hank’s music when I was 16. I had to come (to Montgomery). This is where Hank was, and this is what I wanted to see,” 80-year-old Tennant said as he sat in City Hall for the private screening of “I Saw the Light” – a Sony Pictures biopic about Williams.\n\nThe movie, which opens nationwide Friday, kicks off an Alabama Tourism Department road trip that traces Williams’ travels the days before he died.\n\nIt starts Tuesday in Birmingham, where Williams spent his last night at the Redmont Hotel. Throughout the next two days, the tour will stop at a barber shop in Fort Payne – the location of Williams’ last shave and trim; a hotel in Knoxville, Tenn. – where Williams briefly stayed shortly before he died; and ends in Oak Hill, W. Va., – where Williams was discovered dead.\n\nOnce they reach Oak Hill, the Tourism Department will dedicate an historic marker that bears the Alabama emblem and tells of Williams’ impact on the state.\n\n“(Oak Hill) doesn’t really have a marker there at the moment, so our thought was for the Hank Williams legacy it would be good to have a real marker that looked good,” said Rick Harmon, regional director of the Alabama Tourism Department. “The second part of that is this is like a perpetual ad for the state of Alabama’s tourism and for Hank Williams.”\n\nAlong with the marker, the Tourism Department is also towing a 1953 Cadillac nearly identical to the one Williams drove from Montgomery to West Virginia on their journey.\n\nJett Williams, Hank’s daughter, will also make the trek from Montgomery to Oak Hill.\n\n“It’s a little eerie,” Jett Williams said of going back to Oak Hill. “Especially when you get off the interstate, and you get on the back roads that you know he traveled on. To see the ups and the downs and the blind curves, you can imagine what a night it was that night.”\n\nWilliams said she was honored when the state reached out to her about going on the trip.\n\n“I was born in Montgomery and I grew up in Alabama,” Williams said. “To be able to take something from our state to West Virginia and share it – especially with the movie coming out, and (Hank Williams’) music and memory still being alive after 63 years – is an honor.”"
