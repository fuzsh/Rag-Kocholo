It's the first stop on a three-day trip, commemorating the final ride taken by her famous father, Hank Williams, top right. Jett's journey, organized by the Alabama Tourism Department, also celebrates a new movie about Hank Sr., \"I Saw The Light,\" top left. She'll be accompanied by a baby blue 1953 Cadillac, similar to the one her father died in. The actual car, bottom right, can be seen at the Hank Williams Museum in Montgomery. (AL.com file photos)\n\nTo celebrate a new movie about Hank Williams, the singer's daughter, Jett Williams, will travel on the route her father took on his final, fateful ride.\n\nThe trip, which begins in Birmingham this morning, was organized by the Alabama Tourism Department in conjunction with \"I Saw the Light,\" a bio-pic about the legendary country artist.\n\nTom Hiddleston stars as Williams in the film, which had its premiere in Montgomery on March 21. \"I Saw the Light\" opens nationwide on April 1, after early openings on March 25 in Nashville, Los Angeles and New York.\n\nTo acknowledge the film and commemorate her father's death -- which happened on a car trip from Montgomery to Birmingham to Oak Hill, W. Va., sometime between Dec. 31, 1952, and Jan. 1, 1953 -- Jett Williams will re-trace part of his route with tourism officials.\n\nJett, 63, is the half-sister of Hank Williams Jr. Her mother was Bobbie Jett, Hank Sr.'s paramour.\n\nShe'll appear in Birmingham at 10:30 a.m. today at the Redmont Hotel, 2101 Fifth Ave. North. Because Hank Williams spent his last night there in 1952, the hotel has become a pilgrimage spot for fans.\n\nJett Williams will make a short speech at a press conference outside the Redmont, according to Rick Harmon of the tourism department. She'll also have a powder blue 1953 Cadillac in tow. Her father died in a car that closely resembles the vehicle, en route to a New Year's Day concert date in Canton, Ohio.\n\nHank Williams never made it to the show, but he did make several stops between Birmingham and West Virginia, where his death was discovered by chauffeur Charles Carr.\n\nJett will appear at four of them, moving on to Fort Payne after launching the trek in Birmingham. Her agenda includes a press conference at 3:30 p.m. today at Beason's Barber Shop, 1719 Gault Ave. North in Fort Payne. Hank Williams stopped there for a shave and haircut on the morning of Dec. 31, tourism officials said, noting that the barber chair he used remains on site.\n\nOn Wednesday at 10:30 a.m., the tour stops in Knoxville, Tenn., at the site of the former Andrew Johnson Hotel. Hank Williams stayed at the hotel for a few hours on the evening of Dec. 31, waiting for a winter storm to ease. The building at 912 S. Gay St. now houses the Knox County Schools Board of Education.\n\nOn Thursday at 10:30 a.m., Jett Williams and tourism officials will end the trip and install a historic marker on Main Street in Oak Hill, W. Va., near the Lively Family Amphitheater.\n\nUpon arriving in Oak Hill in the early hours of Jan. 1, 1953, Hank Williams' driver apparently discovered the singer had died in the back seat. Williams' body was taken to the Tyree Funeral Home in Oak Hill. Joe Tyree, who owned and managed the funeral home at the time, will be among the guests at the marker dedication, tourism officials said."
