        "text": "Hank Williams: The Complete Website\n\nThe Death Of Hank Williams\n\nCharles Carr remember Hank in good spirits along the way, talking and singing as they drove north to Birmingham, about an hour and a half north of Montgomery. The two would spend the night of December 30th 1952 at the Redmont in Birmingham. The snow storm made further travel that evening difficult if not impossible. Within thirty minutes of checking into the hotel, several women found their way into Hank's room. Hank reportedly asked the girls where they were from to which one replied \"Heaven\". Hank then told her that she was the reason he was going to hell. The women eventually left and Hank had Charles order them meals from room service.\n\nThe two checked out of the hotel and continued their journey north early that next morning. It was during this time somewhere along the way that Hank bought some type of alcohol. By the time they made it to Chattanooga, it was snowing. By the time they made it to Knoxville, around 10:30am it was obvious Hank was not going to make it to Charleston by showtime unless he was able to fly. They proceeded to the airport and found there was a flight leaving out at 3:30pm. Hank had Charles Carr book the flight and also had him make a phone call to Cas Walker at WNOX and tell him he would make an appearance on the \"Mid-Day Merry Go 'Round\", but he never showed up.\n\nAn hour after leaving Knoxville, Carr was stopped near Blaine, TN by patrolman Swan Kitts. Charles Carr had tried to pass somone and almost hit Kitts cruiser as he entered the oncoming lane. Carr explained to Kitts that he was driving Hank Williams to an engagement in Ohio and could not afford to be late. Kitts noticed something did not seem right about Hank and asked Carr about his condition. Carr told him he had been drinking and was given a sedative. Kitts decided not to disturb Hank but had Carr follow him into Rutledge, TN. There he was arraigned and charged $25.00 for wreckless driving. At 1:00am Charles Carr left Rutledge continuing on to Canton.\n\nHaving drove now for almost 24 hours non-stop Carr was growing tired. He stopped in Bristol, TN and picked up a relief driver named Donald Surface. Surface drove for a while and Charles Carr claims he dropped him off and paid him somewhere in West Virginia. Perhaps Bluefield or Princeton where he had stopped for coffee. At some point early that new years morning, Charles reached back to pull Hanks coat back over his body, when he did he noticed Hanks hands were cold to the touch and when he tried to move them they snapped back across his chest to the position the porters had put him in at the hotel. Around 5:30am Charles Carr pulled into Burdette's Pure Oil Station telling the men working at the time there was a problem. They tried to wake Hank but to no avail, they told Carr the hospital was only six miles from the station.\n\nCharles Carr drove the cadillac to the emergency room entrance where two orderlies picked Hank up by the armpits and feet and carried him into Oak Hill Hospital Emergency Room. Hank was pronounced deat at 7:00am January 1, 1953 by Dr. Diego Nunnari. The doctor concluded Hank had probably died some six hours earlier, but he could not determine the time of death with any certainty. Hanks body was then taken across the street to the Tyree Funeral Home where an autopsy was performed. Dr. Iven Malinin who performed the autopsy was a Russian intern who spoke almost no english. His report noted needle marks in Williams' arms, bruises on various parts of the body, a welt on his forehead and hemorrhages in the heart and neck. The official cause of death was attributed to acute right ventricular dialation, an unusual conclusion, meaning that his heart just stopped beating. Traces of alcohol but no drugs were found in his blood, probably because they hadnt looked for them."
