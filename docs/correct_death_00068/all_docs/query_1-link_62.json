        "text": "From Road & Track\n\nEditor's note: Sometime early on New Year's morning in 1953, Country music star Hank Williams died in the back seat of his 1952 Cadillac convertible near Oak Hill, West Virginia. He and his chauffeur were on a long drive across the South, headed from Hank's home in Montgomery, Alabama, to a gig in Canton, Ohio. Part one of Peter Egan's story retracing the singer's last journey appeared in the April 2008 issue of Road & Track.\n\nMy parents didn't listen to Country & Western music when I was a kid growing up in small-town Wisconsin, but you couldn't miss hearing Hank Williams' songs on the radio. You heard them everywhere; at the gas station, floating out of someone's pickup truck at the drive-in, or at the barbershop. Especially the barbershop.\n\nYou'd sit high in that barber chair, enduring the child's humiliation of having to sit on a board across both armrests while your Roy Rogers cowboy boots poked out from under the white cape. Nine or 10 local men, merchants or farmers, would sit waiting, reading old copies of Field & Stream with leaping wildlife on the cover. Usually a trout or buck, half crazy with panic.\n\nMeanwhile, you sat in that tall chair, looking in the mirror at the reflected bottles of Jerris Hair Tonic and Rose's Butch Wax on a shelf next to a brown Philco radio. And out of the radio would come Hank's voice, high and lonesome, with those slightly flattened hillbilly notes, sometimes yodeling and happy, sometimes heartbroken.\n\n\"Say, hey, good-lookin', whatcha got cookin'…\"\n\n\"Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold, cold heart?\"\n\n\"My hair is still curly and my eyes are still blue, so why don't you love me like you used to do?\"\n\n\"Jambalaya and a crawfish pie and a filé gumbo…\"\n\nEven then, the songs sounded timeless and old-fashioned, like something beamed from another planet through dusty dim radio tubes, and they continued to be played on the radio long after Hank Williams died in 1953.\n\nBut I'd nearly forgotten those songs until adulthood, when I finally shed my teenage disdain for culture that was more than a week old and developed an interest in the roots of American music. I suddenly found a new appreciation for Hank Williams. Bought all his records. Read enough biographies to fill a small library. I became a fan then, and still am.\n\nNone of this enthusiasm or reading is worth a nickel, of course, unless it produces a good road trip.\n\nSo a few years ago I decided to find an appropriate car and follow the route of Hank's final drive across the South. This is a fairly well-documented trail that runs about 800 miles from his home in Montgomery, Alabama, to Oak Hill, West Virginia. All the old two-lane state highways are still there, meandering through the small towns. And a few big ones.\n\nThe car for this trip had to be an old Cadillac, of course. But what Cadillac?\n\nHank's car was a powder-blue 1952 convertible, but these cars have gotten a little rich for my blood, up in the $40,000–$80,000 range. And I'm a person who likes the $4000–$8000 range better. So I began my search for an affordable Caddy in the general style of Hank's old car, from the 1950–1953 family of Harley Earl design.\n\nAll were good-looking cars with only subtle styling differences, but there was much to be said for a '53. First year of 12 volts; first year for GM air conditioning; a nice horsepower boost in the 331- cu.-in. V8, from 190 to 210 bhp.\n\nThe search took about two years. I looked at a lot of bad cars, just missed out on a few good ones, then finally found myself on eBay, bidding on a light green 1953 60 Special Fleetwood from Texas. I \"won\" the car for $7000. It looked sad and sun-baked in the photos, but the owner said the engine ran well and it had no rust.\n\nThe Caddy arrived by transport truck on a cold autumn evening, started right up, drove once around the block and straight into my palatial workshop for assessment. The engine (original and untouched) indeed ran well and the body was absolutely rust-free and straight. Also, it had a cool chromed dealer logo, from Alderson Cadillac, in Lubbock, Texas. Buddy Holly's hometown.\n\nBeyond that, it needed...everything. I put my head down and went to work. For another two years. Transmission rebuild, new U-joints, shocks, springs, water pump, radiator, hoses, oil filter lines, carpeting, hydraulic window lifts, vent cables, trunk lining, new wide whitewall radials, diff bearing and seal, belts, plugs, wires, etc., etc., etc. I removed about 200 lb. of mud wasp nests from beneath the dash, seats and air-conditioning ducts.\n\nRechroming all the emblems and Fleetwood chevrons cost $5000. When I paid this bill, my wife Barbara went into deep shock. She reminded me that my daily driver was an $1800 Buick Park Avenue-with perfect chrome.\n\nMy friends at Foreign Car Specialists helped with much of the heavy mechanical work, electrical genius buddy Eric Lewis spent two days under the dash trying to straighten out the ancient wiring, and Marklein Auto Body in Dodgeville, Wisconsin, took the car down to bare metal and did a stunning repaint with a perfect original color match.\n\nMy last act was to reinstall the original Wonderbar radio, which I'd had rebuilt by a company in Minnesota. I turned it on and waited for the tubes to warm up. The Wonderbar automatically scanned the dial for the strongest stations and stopped on....The World Series.\n\nThe crack of a bat, the roar of the crowd...\"And he's on second!\"\n\nA Twilight Zone moment. The sound of radio baseball hasn't changed since this car rolled off the assembly line.\n\nLate that fall the car was finally ready to go-the day our first blizzard hit.\n\nSo I planned the trip for early May, on a week when my co- driver, Richie Mayer, would be able to join me. (Barb, who works for the school system, sadly couldn't get away.)\n\nRichie is a musician, home designer and songwriter from Chicago who now lives in Sedona, Arizona. He's an old friend as well as guitar/car/motorcycle addict, vintage racer, Blues buff and Hank Williams fan, so of course he'd wanted to go on this trip since the first moment I mentioned it.\n\nRichie flew in on a Monday in May and we left the next morning, properly cowboyed-up with boots, hats and, of course, guitars. We took my 2003 Martin HD-28 and a 1964 Gibson SJN Country-Western model. Similar to Hank's two favorite guitars, but-like the Fleetwood-not exact. This would be the Near Miss Tour of Historical Authenticity.\n\nA last-minute stop at our local antique mall produced an early 1950s' suitcase and a genuine leather doctor's bag for my shaving kit and camera. That latter accessory seemed appropriate.\n\nHank Williams was born with spina bifida and suffered back pain all through his career. He had a string of genuine and quack doctors all across the South who injected him with morphine and a now-disused painkiller called chloral hydrate to keep him on the road. He probably died from long-term use of those drugs and alcohol, mixed in with a big dose of road fatigue.\n\nInto the voluminous trunk of our Caddy, along with those vintage suitcases, went a toolbox and an old wooden crate marked Vital Fluids. STP, Instead-O-Lead and Marvel Mystery Oil. I have a superstitious belief that this holy trinity of additives will sustain a 54-year-old engine on the road. Old engines can tell if you care.\n\nI also added a bottle of Jim Beam to the Vital Fluids box. This was not a Pat Boone memorial tour.\n\nOne thing we didn't have was seatbelts. My leaving them out was a philosophical decision. Richie was of the philosophical opinion that I was nuts.\n\n\"We both survived childhood without them,\" I pointed out. \"And, besides, Hank didn't have them.\"\n\nThis was probably not a good example of responsible risk management.\n\nNevertheless, on a warm spring morning we said goodbye to Barb, hit the road and headed straight south. Driving and listening nervously.\n\nWhy nervously?\n\nWell, Daryl, the harmonica player in our garage band had offered the following malediction right before our trip: \"Montgomery, Alabama? You can't possibly make it from Wisconsin to Alabama in that car. It's 1000 miles from here, and the car's too old. You won't even get to Illinois, much less the starting point of your trip.\"\n\nMaybe he was right. My longest shake-down drive had been 60 miles home from the body shop. We were heading into the unknown. But onward we drove, down the back lanes of Wisconsin, past farms and myriad shades of spring green, and then straight south through the endless prairies of Illinois. After several hours of smooth, uneventful cruising, we finally began to relax.\n\n\"Seems to be running fine,\" Richie noted. \"So far, so good, as the skydiver said.\" The old Fleetwood, with its long wheelbase, has a wonderfully smooth ride, and it motored effortlessly at 70–80 mph, but we decided to hold it down to a respectful 65. We listened to the muted burble of the twin exhaust pipes and Richie said, \"This thing goes down the road like a Chris-Craft. If Chris-Crafts could go down the road.\"\n\nNice day. Good car. We were missing just one thing. Music.\n\nAM radio on our Wonderbar was mostly talk; sports talk, news talk, religious talk, and the political rants of the professionally indignant.\n\n\"Words, instead of musical notes, come out of car speakers now,\" Richie said. \"Maybe that's why they call it the Wonderbar- you hit the bar and wonder why there's no music.\"\n\nSo we swerved into a Wal-Mart and bought a $26 battery-operated boombox made in China. I'd packed my doctor bag with many Country CDs, anticipating such a purchase.\n\nOur silver boombox looked like a lunar landing module, but it sounded good. Richie named it \"The Droid.\" Soon it was perched on our back seat, radiating Hank, Kitty Wells, Buck Owens, Patsy Cline, George Jones and Hank Jr.\n\nWe put our elbows on the doorsills, cranked the quarter-windows open for serene wind flow and crossed the Ohio River into Kentucky. Yes, our hats were in place, sunglasses on, Cadillac humming a deep, honey-flavored hum.\n\n\"I heard that lo-oh-oh-ohn-some whistle blow...\"\n\nWe drove until dusk, then pulled into a clean, big-box motel near the Interstate. It had some name like \"Versailles Pointe Executive Residence Towers.\"\n\nPersonally, I like to look for funky mom & pop \"motor courts\" on car trips like this, but Richie-who spent many years on the road as a real working musician-recoils at the very whiff of mildew-and irrationally insists on sanitary new lodgings without swamp coolers or silverfish in the sink.\n\nThematically speaking, this may be the correct approach. Hank probably didn't stay in any dives, either. Nor did he drive a clapped-out Rambler. So we stayed in the Cadillac of local motels, sipped on a little Jim Beam and played guitars until midnight. A little whiskey and music can really humanize a place-and summon up old gods almost dead, as Robert Graves would say.\n\nThe next morning we filled up and checked the oil. The car was averaging 13.7 mpg (premium unleaded plus lead substitute), and had gone 500 miles on less than one pint of oil. I'd added two pints of Marvel Mystery Oil to the fuel as a top lube to appease the old valve guides and rings.\n\nWe cruised uneventfully down through Memphis past the gates of Graceland, and stopped for lunch in Aberdeen, Mississippi. \"There's some famous Bluesman from this town,\" I told Richie, \"but I can't remember who.\"\n\nRichie suggested I cross \"tour guide\" off my list of retirement career options.\n\nWe motored past a bullet-riddled sign that said, \"Welcome to Alabama,\" then drove through Reform, Gordo and Elrod (great name for a law firm) on Highway 82. The scenery changed from Delta cotton country to the hilly, piney-woods South of sawmills, turpentine factories and logging trains.\n\nHank's largely absent dad, who'd suffered a head injury in World War I and spent much of his life in VA hospitals, drove a logging train, and the family lived for a while in boxcars converted to cabins.\n\nThe afternoon was getting hot, so we turned on the air. Within minutes, the car was comfortably cool-if not frigid. This first-year GM system uses a huge compressor under the hood (picture the dynamo in Fritz Lang's Metropolis), with a Frigidaire cooler unit in the trunk. Dual fans blow the cool air up through clear plastic ducts in the back window ledge into channels in the headliner. Chromed vents blow cool air down on you, and the system is fed by snorkel-like scoops on the rear flanks.\n\nIf this system had just one more step, it would involve a tray of Mint Juleps. As we drove along, cool and collected, I realized Hank didn't live long enough to have air conditioning in a Cadillac.\n\nNight found us at a largely mold-free motel just outside Montgomery. As we got out of the car, Richie said, \"This is the most comfortable car I've ever traveled in. Period. Cool, quiet, roomy, great seats.\" He also confessed he was beginning to enjoy the freedom of movement that comes without seatbelts, noting you could jump in or out of the car, lean on the door or reach into the back seat to program your Droid without restriction. Another luxury lost to safety and our quest for virtual immortality.\n\nThe next morning we cruised downtown and found the Hank Williams Museum, a storefront at 118 Commerce St. This is a superbly organized museum, founded by a Williams buff named Cecil Jackson, who once worked at a Montgomery gas station and actually balanced the tires on Hank's blue 1952 Caddy. The museum is now run by Cecil's daughter, Beth Birtley, who greeted us at the door.\n\nThe place is filled with Hank memorabilia-guitars, stage costumes, letters, sheet music, records and so on-but the centerpiece is the eggshell-blue Cadillac.\n\nDocuments on the car are fascinating to look at. Seems Hank actually bought the car used, from a car lot in Nashville. He got it on July 17, 1952, for $5202 (more than new!), plus insurance and finance costs. He got a bank loan for $3818.18 and agreed to pay $212.12 per month for 18 months. The title wasn't actually mailed to Hank until January 22, 1953, three weeks after he died.\n\nAlabama must be really inefficient. In Wisconsin they mail our titles just two weeks after we die.\n\nThe original owner of the car was one Homer L. Cooper, a serviceman from Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He bought the car in April of 1952 for a total cash price of $5083.95, with optional oil filter, heater, signal-seeking radio (an extra $119.40 for the Wonderbar!), power steering and premium-grade whitewalls. The car also had twin 4-barrel carburetors and a continental kit, dealer- installed options that Hank may have added. They aren't listed on the window sticker.\n\nSo...this was not an Elvis-style cash impulse buy. Hank had to take out a loan, just like the rest of us. On a used car.\n\nNice used car, though. Very nice. It stayed in the family for years, and Hank Williams Jr. actually drove it to high school for three years in Nashville. He still owns the Caddy, but has loaned it to the museum. It was restored in 1985 and has 78,000 miles on it.\n\nCoincidentally, our Fleetwood turned 78,000 miles on the way to Montgomery. Not to spook you or anything. Or me and Richie, either.\n\nLeaving the museum, we had a hot dog at Hank's favorite lunch spot, Chris's Hot Dogs-still thriving after all these years-then drove out to the nearby Oakwood Cemetery.\n\nHere Hank is buried next to his ex-wife, Audrey, the iron-willed woman who (along with Hank's iron-willed mother, Lillian) simultaneously pushed his career forward and inspired so many of his songs, both lighthearted and heartbreaking. All are buried in a beautiful spot in this vast cemetery, on a hill above the city.\n\nWhile we were there, nine or 10 other cars showed up. Young people, older couples in campers, vacationing families. Visitors stood quietly, or took pictures. When Hank died, 20,000 people showed up for his funeral in downtown Montgomery. The rest of us are still straggling in."
