        "text": "Released at nationwide movie theaters Friday, the Sony Pictures’ feature, I Saw the Light, was viewed during a special early screening Monday night by Hank Williams’ daughter and fans in Montgomery, where the country music singer-songwriter lived, and is buried.\n\nRather than a movie theatre with Dolby sound and IMAX screens, event organizers couldn’t think of a better venue than the Montgomery City Hall Auditorium as the scene for the local premiere depicting the life, legend and legacy of the man who called the Capital City “home” from 1937 to 1948. It had been selected because it was the site for Hank Williams’ funeral on Jan. 4, 1953, when 20,000 fans gathered outside on Perry Street, and where some 2750 mourners crowded inside for the services 63 years ago.\n\nInside the restore City Auditorium Monday evening, Jett Williams, welcomed guests to “the hallowed and sacred spot” where her father was eulogized two days before she was born in the city. An old photographic still-image of the crowded funeral street scene was projected on a large screen behind her, as she spoke at the event hosted in a partnership between the Alabama Tourism Department and the Montgomery Area Chamber of Commerce’s Convention and Visitor Bureau. The image, fittingly, was the last seen in the biopic movie of her father’s music career, and as his song, I Saw the Light, played in-memoriam.\n\nThe song is one of about 225 in Williams’ musical legacy portfolio that included 36 hits, prompting sales of over 11 million vinyl records in his hey-day. His road to music stardom began at the age of 14, where he sang over the airwaves of the old WSFA radio station. The call letters stood for the “South’s Finest Airport”, where the station began, and whose nighttime beacon inspired Williams to write the lyrics and music for “I Saw the Light”, when he was returning to the Capital City from an out-of-town “gig” one night.\n\nThe song and many of Hank’s hits were also played at the beginning of the evening, while Lee Sentell, the Director of the Alabama Tourism Department, welcomed guests outside and across the street from the life-size statue of Williams, which is in close proximity to the museum maintained in his memory; to Nobles (the old Elite Café’), where Williams last sang in public 4 days before he died; to the location of the now-demolished Rooming House on McDonough Street, where the singer’s body was laid in state before the funeral; and a mile from the Oakwood Cemetery Annex, where he is buried.\n\nA Vintage Last Ride\n\nThe Perry Street block in front of City Hall had been blocked off for the event, and Tourism’s Regional Director and Hank Williams’ Superfan Rick Harmon, helped welcome arrivals where a red carpet played second fiddle to a vintage convertible powder blue Cadillac. Bearing state license plate “RD TRIP”, the 1953 model auto is used frequently by Tourism in its “Road Trip” ads, and was the perfect attraction for the Alabama premiere. Parked in the middle of the street, it was reminiscent of the 1952 model with its push-button car radio, that the singer-songwriter died on the back seat of in the early morning hours of Jan. 1, 1953 “on the road” to a New Year’s Day concert performance in Canton, Ohio.\n\nMontgomery Mayor Todd Strange was among those also greeting arriving fans and special guests to “the event you couldn’t buy a ticket for”. With car photo-opps the craze outside, Hank’s voice singing “Hey Good Lookin’ “ was heard inside, as the Mayor was joined by Dawn Hathcock, Vice President of Convention and Visitor Development; and Lee Sentell to welcome all to an exclusive VIP reception, followed by the movie’s screening.\n\nThose guests included Tamara Trexler of Nashville, an actress and prominent film and TV producer; television, live performance, and feature documentary producers Barbara and Greg Hall, also of Nashville; and author and playwright Johnny Williams of La Grange, GA.\n\nJett’s special guests attending were Kelly Zumwait of Nashville; Helen and Joe Skipper of Jackson, MS; Rheta Grimsley-Johnson of Iuka, MS; and Jimmy Johnson of Auburn, a comic strip cartoonist who writes and draws the nationally syndicated, Arlo & Janis. Johnson was there with his wife, Mona Cox; Nancy and Richard Shinbaum; and Johnny Cash’s brother, Tommy Cash, who includes a melody of the Hank Williams’ hits in his own performances. Wearing a sparkling, pin-striped suit and a guitar-piano themed tie, Cash came from Hendersonville, TN, outside of Nashville, for the special event with his wife, Marcy. They all mingled with others on the street by the Cadillac, and later, inside during the reception.\n\nHot-Dog!\n\nFamily-owned since 1917, Chris’ Hot Dogs on Dexter Avenue was Hank Williams’ favorite place to eat while living in Montgomery from 1937 to 1948. Chris Katechis owned the establishment then, and served frequently served the entertainer his hot dog and “coke-cola”. The downtown eatery was run in later years by his son, Theo Katechis, and followed by “Mr. Chris”’ grandson, Gus.\n\nGus was at City Hall to provide Hank’s favorite food to guests during Monday’s reception, along with Golden Flake chip varieties, bags of popcorn, and Coca-Cola in original small bottles that were opened with “Capital Cool” logo’d bottle openers.\n\nAmong those seen enjoying the casual reception were Montgomery City Council member Tracy Larkin, District 3; Donald Mims, Administrator of the Montgomery County Commission; Lori Moneyham; Judy and Perry Hooper, Jr.; KayMarie and Michael Briddell, who were excited about what the movie will do for the City; Brenda and Ed Kirby, head of the Hank Williams International Society and Fan Club; Sally and Bob O’Donnell of Gulf Shores, MS; and Carol McWhorter.\n\nPilgrimage to “the Gump”\n\nAlso there, and recognized by the Mayor, was George Tennant of Liverpool, England, who grew up listening to Hank Williams on the radio overseas. A big fan, Tennant makes an annual autumn visit to Montgomery, but quite by happenstance, opted to come before the onset of spring this year. During his recent 28-day stay, he has eaten lunch at Chris’ Hot Dogs every day in Hank’s memory. With fortunate timing, he was in town to attend the Montgomery film premiere, and wore a Hank Williams’ tie, one of a series handmade for him as Christmas presents by his grandson.\n\nArriving from Georgiana to represent the Hank Williams Boyhood Home & Museum there were Margaret Gaston, Becky Manning, Judy and Buddy Manning, June and Skipper Whittle, Jim Rumbley, and Dot and Lynn Watson.\n\nThe largest collection of Hank Williams’ clothing, records, paintings and personal items is housed in the Hank Williams Museum on Commerce Street in Montgomery. During the evening, the local museum was represented by Becky Bozeman, Peggy and Jimmy Johns, and Robert McKenzie. Several fans wore Hank Williams sweatshirts, including Karen Strickland, who enjoys participating in the karaoke celebrations at the museum on New Year’s Day. Karen and her husband, Gene Strickland, came from Slocum, AL to attend the premiere.\n\nAs reception perks, guests grabbed premiere gifts that included lapel pins, beverage koozies, and Hank Williams’ Trail t-shirts. The shirts emphasize the cities along the trail of Williams’ life that goes from Mt. Olive, Georgiana, Greenville, Andalusia, Montgomery, Lake Martin/Kowaliga, Birmingham and Fort Payne, AL; to Nashville, TN; Knoxville, TN, Shreveport, LA; and Oak Hill, West Virginia.\n\nNotes to Hold On To\n\nThe national premiere of the film of his life and death took place in October in Nashville, where Jett Williams resides. Though its wide-release was delayed until March, it runs a little over 2 hours, as a biopic of the singer-songwriter who rose to fame in the 1940’s. While his struggle with alcohol abuse and infidelity took a toll on his career and marriage, he was always heralded as “an artist and a man who could make people forget their troubles” through his songs.\n\nWhile British actor Tom Hiddleston captured the title role as Hank, and wears the trademark country-western hats throughout most of the movie; the cast is filled with Hollywood notables including Elizabeth Olsen as his wife, Audrey Mae Williams; and\n\nBradley Whitford, known from the popular TV series, The West Wing. Whitford portrayed songwriter and music publisher-producer Fred Rose, who was inducted in the inaugural class of the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1961 along with Hank Williams.\n\nActress and Tennessee native Cherry Jones portrayed Hank’s mother, “Lillie” Skipper Williams. Jones is known for her roles in the movie, The Perfect Storm, the Fox TV series hit 24, and as the Tony Award-winning Best Actress for The Heiress. Wrenn Schmidt portrays Bobbie Jett, Jett Williams’ mother; and Maddie Hasson captures Hank’s heart as his last wife and widow, Billie Jean.\n\nWhile Hank’s story is the highlight, his music is in the spotlight. From honky-tonks to the Grand Ole Opry and television studios, “Your Cheatin’ Heart”, “Lovesick Blues”, “Move It on Over”, “I’m Walking the Floor Over You”, “Cold, Cold Heart” and many others remind us of the hometown talent who said, “when I find a note I like, I like to hold onto it”.\n\nMore Online\n\nFor more photos from the I Saw the Light Premiere, go to www.montgomeryadvertiser.com\n\nPlanning An Event?"
