She was born a few days after Williams died and she said commemorating her father is a great honor.\n\nThe ceremony was the final leg of a tour that began in Williams’ hometown of Montgomery, Alabama, and concluded in Oak Hill. The tour ran in conjunction with the movie “I Saw the Light,” which chronicles Williams’ life."
