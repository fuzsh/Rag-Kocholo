        "text": "Hank Williams, orig. Hiram King Williams, (born Sept. 17, 1923, Mount Olive, Ala., U.S.—found dead Jan. 1, 1953, Oak Hill, W.Va.), U.S. singer and guitarist. Williams was born into poverty. He began playing guitar at age 8, made his radio debut at 13, and formed his first band, Hank Williams and his Drifting Cowboys, at 14. With the help of Fred Rose, his “Lovesick Blues” became a smash hit in 1949, and he joined the Grand Ole Opry that year after an extraordinary debut appearance. Among his best-selling recordings were “I’m So Lonesome I Could Cry,” “Jambalaya,” “Your Cheatin’ Heart,” and “Hey, Good Lookin’.” He wrote almost all the songs he recorded. His death from heart failure at 29 may have resulted from drug and alcohol abuse. He remains perhaps the most revered figure in the history of country music. His son, Hank Williams, Jr., has had an exceptional recording career."
