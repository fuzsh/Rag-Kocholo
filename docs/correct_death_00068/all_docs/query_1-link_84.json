        "text": "MONTGOMERY, AL (WSFA) - Country music's first superstar and Alabama's own Hank Williams is the main character in a new movie opening this weekend. Montgomery is hosting a special premier of the film and kicking off a \"road tour\" in Williams' honor.\n\nThe new movie is called \"I Saw the Light,\" and stars Tom Hiddleston as Williams.\n\n\"Tom did a superb job,\" says Williams' daughter, Jett. \"I really believe that he did my dad and his memory, justice.\"\n\nThe premier is a private showing at Montgomery City Hall, the old Montgomery City Auditorium where Hank Williams' funeral was held Jan 4, 1953.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Alabama Tourism Department, along with Jett Williams, will make the \"Last Ride,\" a three-day road trip retracing Hank Williams' final journey.\n\nThe tour will include a powder blue 1953 Cadillac, similar to the one Hank drove, and will make stops in Birmingham, Fort Payne, Knoxville, Tennessee and Oak Hill, West Virginia. His driver found that the singer had died in the back seat of his Cadillac when he pulled over at a gas station in Oak Hill on New Year's Day, 1953.\n\n\"The point of it is we're putting up a historic marker in West Virginia,\" the Alabama Tourism Department's Rick Harmon says. \"It has the state seal of Alabama on it, which is basically a perpetual ad saying 'if you want to know about Hank Williams, come to Alabama.'\"\n\nHank Williams started his career at WSFA when it was a radio station. He hosted a radio show that launched him to the Grand Ol' Opry. So Montgomery is an important part of Williams' life and legacy.\n\n\"We have over 20,000 people come here annually to visit the museum and the memorial,\" says Meg Lewis with the Montgomery CVB. \"30 percent of those are from outside the U.S.\""
