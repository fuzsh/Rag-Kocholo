The city of Oak Hill, West Virginia, has unveiled a memorial plaque honoring country singer Hank Williams.

Media outlets report the city held a presentation ceremony of the marker on Main Street Thursday.

Williams was declared dead in Oak Hill, after being discovered unresponsive in the back seat of a car.

Williams' daughter, Jett Williams, traveled to Oak Hill to attend the ceremony. She was born a few days after Williams died and she said commemorating her father is a great honor.

The ceremony was the final leg of a tour that began in Williams' hometown of Montgomery, Alabama, and concluded in Oak Hill. The tour ran in conjunction with the movie "I Saw the Light," which chronicles Williams' life.
