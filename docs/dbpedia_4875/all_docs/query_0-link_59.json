NACI has been providing guidance on the use of vaccines currently or newly approved for use in Canada to the Government of Canada since 1964. The Committee reports to the Vice-President of the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Branch, and works with staff of the Centre for Immunization and Respiratory Infectious Diseases of the Public Health Agency of Canada to provide ongoing and timely medical, scientific and public health advice.\n\nNACI makes recommendations for the use of vaccines currently or newly approved for use in humans in Canada, including the identification of groups at risk for vaccine-preventable diseases for whom vaccination should be targeted. NACI knowledge syntheses, analyses and recommendations on vaccine use in Canada are included in published literature reviews, statements and updates. NACI recommendations are also published in the Canadian Immunization Guide. Email updates are available through our mailing list.\n\nMembership\n\nChair\n\nDr. Robyn Harrison\n\nAlberta Health Services\n\nGrey Nuns and University of Alberta Hospitals\n\nDr. Robyn Harrison is an Infectious Disease Specialist who works in Edmonton, Alberta.

Dr. Decaluwe graduated from the Faculty of Medicine at McGill University and completed her residency in pediatrics at the CHU Sainte-Justine (University of Montreal). She then completed her training in pediatric clinical immunology at the Necker Enfants-Malades Hospital (Paris, France) with Professor Alain Fischer. Her research training includes a Master and a PhD degree in immunology at Pierre and Marie Curie University (Paris 6) carried out in the laboratories of Professor Jean-Laurent Casanova and Professor James Di Santo respectively. Clinical researcher supported by the Fonds de Recherche du Québec en Santé (FRQS), she has dedicated her career to resolving the mechanisms of T cell differentiation in health, infection and primary immune deficiencies. The primary focus of her research is to better understand the role of cytokines in the differentiation of T cells in health and disease, and to develop novel immunotherapeutic approaches that target cytokine-dependent pathways and inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells, to cure chronic viral infections and cancer. Supported by both national (Canadian Institutes of Health Research, National Institute of Health) and private (Canadian Cancer Society/Cole Foundation, Charles Bruneau Foundation, Leukemia and Lymphoma Society of Canada) funding agencies, her laboratory has established a solid expertise in the field of T cell exhaustion, a differentiation pathway that limits optimal T effector cell functions and precludes memory T cell development. She is particularly involved in identifying the cytokine-dependent signaling pathways and transcription factors regulating T cell exhaustion during disease. She further aims to develop novel combined immunotherapeutic approaches that target inhibitory receptors and/or cytokine-dependent signaling pathways, to improve cure rates in cancer refractory patients and patients with primary immunodeficiencies. Hélène Decaluwe in also in recognized expert in the immune reconstitution of severe combined immunodeficiency patients treated by stem cell transplantation and aims to inform on the best therapeutic approaches to transplant these patients. Since the beginning of the current COVID-19 pandemic, her laboratory has been investigating T-cell immune correlates of protection to SARS-Cov-2, induced by natural infection and vaccination, through research initiatives supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the COVID-19 Immunity Task Force.\n\nDisclosure of Affiliations and Interests from the last 3 years\n\n1.
