        "text": "Prior to joining Dentons, Lynn led the insolvency aspects of the representation as conflicts counsel of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and its affiliates, in one of the largest and most complex Chapter 11 cases ever filed. Other highlights of Lynn’s practice include his key role in the international representation of the Italian Extraordinary Administrator of Parmalat S.p.A., a multinational dairy and food corporation, and its affiliates, in restructuring some of the company’s subsidiaries in the United States and Latin America. Lynn also counselled the foreign representatives of Gruppo Covarra S.A. de C.V., the first successful ancillary proceeding initiated by a “sindico” (a Mexican liquidator) in the United States since the enactment of Mexico’s insolvency law, the Ley de Concurso Mercantiles.\n\nIn addition to his practice, Lynn is a frequent lecturer and prolific writer on international and domestic insolvency issues. He was recently invited to participate in the Second Circuit Judicial Conference, where he served on a panel among U.S. bankruptcy judges addressing “Failures Without Borders: Adjudicating Global Insolvencies.”\n\nLynn was selected to attend the UNCITRAL Working Group V (Insolvency Law) at the United Nations as co-representative of the Inter-Pacific Bar Association (IPBA), an international association of business and commercial lawyers who live in, or otherwise have a strong interest in, the Asia-Pacific Region. The UNCITRAL Working Group V is the organization that was instrumental in drafting the model law that was precursor to chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code governing cross-border insolvencies in the United States.\n\nLynn has spoken throughout the United States, Europe, Latin America, the Far East and Africa. He has also been a featured commentator for Forbes Magazine in the United States and Phoenix TV InfoNews Channel in China.\n\nSelected Landmark Transactions"
