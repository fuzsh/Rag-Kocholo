        "text": "This is Dominic Longo, research historian at the HIstoric Village of Allaire.\n\nOn November 2 we celebrated the Election of 1836 with our own Allaire Election and Women’s Suffrage demonstration, but the actual election of 1836 was a month long. Without the ability to quickly tabulate and report votes, elections stretched out over the course of weeks.\n\nOn December 7, 1836 Martin Van Buren, Jacksonian Democrat, was announced the winner of the presidency over future president William Henry Harrison and three other Whig Candidates, Hugh White, Daniel Webster, and William Person Mangum.\n\nVan Buren, the vice president under Andrew Jackson, was chosen by “Old Hickory” as a hand picked successor to his presidency. Although unpopular with Southern Democrats for his northern New York roots, Van Buren was voted unanimously as the Democratic Candidate for the presidency during the 1835 Democratic National Convention. Martin Van Buren won the 8 electoral votes from the state of New Jersey by a margin of only 545 votes.\n\nLocally in New Jersey, there were no Senate seats up for bid and there was no election for Governor, but the election for the House of Representatives saw wholesale change. All six incumbent members of the House of Representatives lost their reelection bids. The Democrats were ousted by six Whig representatives. All representatives from the state of New Jersey were “at large” candidates, meaning that there were no Congressional districts in the state of New Jersey like today. The most local candidate to the Howell Iron Works was Joseph Fitz Randolph, who was from Freehold and worked as a prosecuting attorney for Monmouth County. Joseph Fitz Randolph would serve three terms as a New Jersey Representative and later become a member of the New Jersey Supreme Court.\n\nAround the nation, the state legislature of New Hampshire appointed future president Franklin Pierce as Senator. (More than 75 years would pass before the 17th amendment was ratified which allowed the people to directly elect Senators as opposed to state appointment.) Millard Fillmore was also elected as a Congressional representative for the 32nd district in New York for the second time. Fillmore would become the Vice President under Zachary Taylor and became president upon the death of President Taylor. Also elected to the House of Representatives was John Wesley Crockett, son of David Crockett, who represented Tennessee’s 11th district.\n\nLast Saturday’s Election Day event re-created the Election of 1836 in which Martin Van Buren (Democrat) ran against William Henry Harrison (Whig). During the event, our dedicated campaigners engaged the public and persuaded them to vote for the best candidate. Several women villagers picketed during the day as they did not yet have the right to vote (and wouldn’t until the 1920’s).\n\nWe recorded the results of the first counting of the ballots…Check out the video here!\n\nAfter the re-count it was determined that William Henry Harrison won the election by 1 vote! While, in reality, William Henry Harrison did win the state of New Jersey, it was Martin Van Buren who became the country’s new president.\n\nThanks to all visitors, villagers, and voters for stopping by!\n\n-Hannah\n\nPS- If you’re looking for something to do this weekend, Allaire Village and the Traveling Literary Theater proudly present ‘The Words & Music of WWII’. The program takes place on Saturday, November 12th at 7:30pm in the Allaire Chapel. Tickets are $15 and can be purchased by calling 732-919-3500. Please call or visit our website for more information.\n\nTomorrow, (Sunday, November 6th) step back in time to the Presidential Elections of 1836 and join the Historic Village at Allaire as they cast their votes! Members of the public are invited to do their patriotic duty and join the residents of James P. Allaire’s Howell Iron Works in deciding the fate of our young nation. Vote wisely however, for things were not as “organized” as they are now; and you may find yourself tugged in different directions by the candidates’ argumentative “representatives”!\n\nWhat were the “current events” of the 1830’s? Our foundling country was on the brink of turmoil in 1836. Andrew Jackson, the current president, had vetoed the charter for the Bank of the United States two years earlier and the country was on the verge of a depression (known as the Panic of 1837). Abolitionists were gaining a strong foothold in the National Political scene. Immigrants were pouring into the country while “native-born” Americans feared losing their employment. Other hot topics included the War with Mexico, National Currency, Texas’ wish to annex, the Fall of the Alamo, women’s right to vote, and more! The Villagers will be debating these issues and will be more than happy to discuss (and argue!) them with visitors!\n\nWho were the candidates? Democrat Martin Van Buren offered himself as the heir to Andrew Jackson, candidate of the people, primising a continuation of the Jacksonian policies. Many of the nation’s voters who loved “Old Hickory” were quite content to vote for Van Buren. Van Buren also had the benefit of a well-organized and disciplined Democratic Party inw hich he himself had helped to build. The oppositional Whig Party, however, was still in its infancy and lacked the maturity, ideology, and organization of the Democrats.\n\nWithout the unity to hold a national convention, or even to settle on a single candidate, the Whigs ran three regional contenders: Daniel Webster of Massachusetts int he East, Hugh White, the senator from Tennessee in the South, and the party forefrunner, William Henry Harrison of Ohio in the West. Despite its shortcomings, however, the Whigs did offer stiff competition to the Democratic Van Buren. A party of the elite, the Whigs regarded their opposition as little more than a party stooge and warned that his election would only continue the flawed policies of, what they deemed, the monarchical Jackson.\n\nThe polls will open at 1:00pm under the tent at the Carpenter’s Shop and will close at 3:30pm. After the polls are closed the votes will be counted, and the results will be announced soon after!\n\nIn addition to the voting, our women visitors will be rallying for their own right to vote. Visitors are encouraged to join them in their cause! There will also be a special eulogy for former President James Madison, who had passed away in June of 1836 at 1:00 & 2:30pm.\n\nProgram researched & written by Ralph Cretella, Intern; and Derek Cardinale, Volunteer Coordinator\n\nHope to see you out there!\n\n-Hannah"
