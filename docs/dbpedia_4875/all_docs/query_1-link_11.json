        "text": "Introduction\n\n(1833–1901). Nearly half a million people stood in the rain to watch the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison in 1889. This was the nation’s centennial inauguration. Just 100 years earlier George Washington had become the first president of the United States.\n\nSome old people in the crowd remembered the inauguration of Benjamin Harrison’s grandfather, William Henry Harrison. “Grandfather’s hat fits Ben” was a Republican campaign song. Cartoonists, however, liked to picture the new president in a “grandfather’s hat” much too large for him. He was a little man, barely five feet six inches tall.\n\nPresident Harrison’s single term fell between the two terms of Grover Cleveland, a Democrat. Cleveland was popular with the people but unpopular with political leaders. Harrison was popular with neither. There was indeed something of a mystery in his being elected at all. He was serious and dignified, not a hand-shaking politician and not a leader of men.\n\nBenjamin Harrison was born August 20, 1833, in his grandfather’s beautiful home at North Bend, Ohio. He was the second son of John Scott Harrison and Elizabeth Irwin Harrison. He was named Benjamin after his great-grandfather, who signed the Declaration of Independence as “Benj. Harrison.”\n\nWilliam Henry Harrison had a large estate. He gave 600 acres to John Scott, and soon after Ben’s birth the family moved into their own home. Their farm lay between the Ohio and the Miami rivers and was called The Point because it tapered to a point where the two rivers join. The house stood on a bluff facing the Ohio. From the porch Ben could watch flatboats floating downstream carrying pioneer families with their household goods and farm animals.\n\nBen’s father had nine children of his own and adopted two. He hired a governess to teach the young children and a tutor for the older children. Ben cut wood and carried water for the black cook so that the cook would have time to go with him to fish or hunt. In his later years, however, he never cared for sports.\n\nHe Goes to College\n\nWhen Ben was 14 he went to Farmers’ College, near Cincinnati. One of his professors, Dr. John W. Scott, had an attractive young daughter, Caroline (Carrie) Lavinia. When Dr. Scott moved to Oxford, Ohio, Ben decided that Miami College, at Oxford, would be a fine place to continue his education.\n\nAt Miami Ben showed skill in debating. Words came easily to him, and his shrill voice and earnest manner commanded attention. He entered Miami as a junior and was graduated the next year (1852), ranking fourth in a class of 16. Before leaving he became secretly engaged to Carrie. Then he went to Cincinnati to read law in the office of a well-known attorney.\n\nHe Marries and Becomes a Lawyer\n\nBen married Carrie when he was 20. The next year they moved to Indianapolis, Ind. Clients were few for a lawyer who looked like a boy, and Ben earned his first money as a court crier at $2.50 a day. The young couple lived in a boardinghouse until their first child, Russell, was born, in 1854. Then they moved to a three-room cottage. Their second child, Mary, was born in 1858.\n\nAt this time the struggle over slavery was dividing the nation. Harrison joined the new Republican party. In 1860 he was elected reporter of the Indiana Supreme Court. When the Civil War broke out, he was working day and night to pay for a new house.\n\nHe Answers the Call to Arms\n\nOn July 1, 1862, Lincoln called for more troops. Harrison went to the governor, who asked him to recruit a regiment. On his way back to his office, he bought a military cap and hired a fifer and a drummer. Then he put a flag out of his office window and began recruiting. When the regiment was complete, the governor commissioned him a colonel, and Harrison set off with his troops. By day he drilled his men; at night he studied tactics. Always he looked after his soldiers’ needs. They called him Little Ben.\n\nIn the summer of 1864 Harrison was marching into Georgia with General William Tecumseh Sherman. He fought gallantly in many battles and took part in the siege of Atlanta. Before he was discharged he was breveted a brigadier general of volunteers. Thereafter he was called General Harrison.\n\nBack to Law and Politics\n\nGeneral Harrison went back to his work at the Supreme Court and his law practice. He also took over again his large Bible class in the Presbyterian church, where his wife taught Sunday school.\n\nIn 1876 Harrison ran for governor of Indiana. The Democrats called him “cold as an iceberg” and nicknamed him Kid-Glove Harrison. (Harrison thought it was necessary to wear gloves to guard against infection.) The Democratic candidate, nicknamed Blue Jeans, won the election.\n\nFour years later the Indiana legislature elected Harrison to the United States Senate. He served from 1881 to 1887 and won the good will of veterans by supporting the many private pension bills that came to him.\n\nHe Is Elected President\n\nGreat was the confusion in the Republican nominating convention of 1888. Senator James G. Blaine, the leader of the party, had been defeated by Cleveland in 1884 and refused to run against him again. The field was therefore open. Harrison was finally nominated with Blaine’s support. Levi P. Morton, a New York banker, was named for vice-president.\n\nManufacturers gave money to the Republican campaign because they feared Cleveland, who demanded a lower tariff. Cleveland polled about 90,000 more votes than Harrison but lost the election because the electoral college gave him 168 votes to Harrison’s 233. Harrison appointed Blaine his secretary of state.\n\nThe Harrisons in the White House\n\nMrs. Harrison, beautiful and gracious, did what she could to make friends for her husband, but congressmen preferred to visit the Blaines. The White House was crowded, however, with the Harrisons’ own family—Mrs. Harrison’s aged father; her niece, Mrs. Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, a young widow; and the Harrisons’ daughter Mary (Mrs. McKee), with her husband and two young children. The Harrisons’ son Russell made frequent visits.\n\nCongress appropriated $35,000 to have the White House renovated, and Mrs. Harrison spent the money carefully. When the White House was wired for electricity, the Harrisons asked one of the electricians to stay on because they were afraid to turn the lights on and off. The man they selected was Ike Hoover, who remained on the White House staff for 42 years.\n\nThe Billion-Dollar Congress\n\nHarrison kept aloof from Congress and left lawmaking to its leaders. Thomas B. Reed, speaker of the house, won the title of Czar Reed because he pushed through new parliamentary rules to speed up lawmaking. First on his list was the Dependent Pension Act. This provided money for Civil War veterans who had a disability, no matter where or when they got it. Extravagant appropriations were made also for the Navy and for rivers and harbors. The 51st Congress was the first to spend a billion dollars in peacetime. It easily disposed of the large treasury surplus that had troubled earlier administrations.\n\nSix states were admitted to the Union. Four were Western mining states. Congressmen from these Western states wanted more silver dollars coined to raise the price of silver. Congressmen from the East wanted higher tariffs. The two groups agreed to support each other. The McKinley Tariff Act raised duties on almost every article that competed with American products, thus making permanent the duties enacted during the Civil War. The Sherman Silver Purchase Act forced the treasury to buy 41/2 million ounces of silver each month.\n\nThe 51st Congress also passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act to curb monopolies. No serious attempt was made to enforce this law until the administration of Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nHarrison Loses to Cleveland\n\nThe Republicans renominated Harrison in 1892. The Democrats nominated Cleveland again. The new People’s party, or Populists, put up James B. Weaver of Iowa, who had run and lost as the Greenback party candidate in 1880. The Populists represented farmers in the West. The farmers were suffering from low prices and “tight” money. They wanted cheap money—silver or greenbacks—to raise the prices of their products.\n\nAlready there were warnings of the approaching Panic of 1893. Because of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act the government was buying all the silver produced in the United States. Still, the price of silver did not rise because of the large world production. Precious gold was being drained away from the treasury, and cheap silver piled up. People and banks began to hoard gold coins. Foreign investors sent their American bonds back to be sold for gold while the precious metal was still to be had.\n\nCleveland was elected by a large majority. Harrison’s wife died on October 25, near the end of the campaign. After Cleveland’s inauguration Harrison returned to his Indianapolis home to resume his law practice and to write. His excellent book on federal government, This Country of Ours (1897), was widely read.\n\nIn 1896 Harrison married Mary Scott Lord Dimmick, who had nursed Carrie through her last illness. By her he had a child, Elizabeth. Harrison died on March 31, 1901, and was buried in Indianapolis, beside the wife of his youth."
