        "text": "New York's 40th Senate District includes the towns of Carmel, Kent, Patterson and Southeast, and the village of Brewster in Putnam County; the town of Stony Point in Rockland County; and the city of Peekskill, the towns of Bedford, Cortlandt, Lewisboro, New Castle, North Salem, Somers and Yorktown, the towns/villages of Mount Kisco and Ossining, and the villages of Briarcliff Manor, Buchanan and Croton-on-Hudson in Westchester County.\n\nNEW YORK STATE SENATORS\n\nWHO HAVE REPRESENTED THE MODERN 40TH SENATE DISTRICT\n\n1913-present\n\nCompiled by: James Booth\n\nBACKGROUND; The 40th Senate District has existed in some shape or form under various redistricting plans for at least 100 years. It originally included at one time all of Westchester County. However, it has generally regressed northward as Westchester has grown, and new districts were added to the county. It did not permanently begin to include Dutchess and Putnam Counties until the 1980’s and 1990’s. The district has elected a Republican in every election since the 1914 election, until electing a Democrat, Peter B. Harckham in 2018. The last Democrat to hold the seat was John F. Healey, who served briefly from 1913-1914. The previous Senator was a Republican. Since the district has not always been the 40th and has not always included the same territory, this list is compiled in redistricting order. Some senators may be listed more then once. That is because those senators represented multiple incarnations of the district.\n\n40th Senate District-2013-2022 Redistricting\n\nDutchess County: Towns of Beekman and Pawling\n\nPutnam County: Towns of Carmel, Patterson, Southeast\n\nWestchester County: City of Peekskill.
