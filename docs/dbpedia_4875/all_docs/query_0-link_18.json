Allison, Wharton Barker, James Gillespie Blaine, Andrew Carnegie, Schuyler Colfax, Stephen B. Elkins, James A. Garfield, Marcus Alonzo Hanna, Rutherford B. Hayes, William McKinley, Louis T. Michener, William H. H. Miller, John W. Noble, Redfield Proctor, Matthew Stanley Quay, Whitelaw Reid, Clement Studebaker, Benjamin F. Tracy, Lew Wallace, and John Wanamaker.\n\nThe Index to the Benjamin Harrison Papers, created by the Manuscript Division in 1964 after the bulk of the collection was microfilmed, provides a full list of the correspondents and notes the series number and dates of the items indexed. This information is helpful in finding individual letters or documents in the online version. Additional letters received by the Library after 1964 are not listed in this index.\n\nA current finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the Benjamin Harrison Papers is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nBrief History of the Benjamin Harrison Papers\n\nThe story of the Benjamin Harrison Papers is largely that of Mrs. Mary Lord Dimmick Harrison’s search for a biographer of her husband. Inquiry about the papers on behalf of the Library of Congress was first made in 1903. After negotiations with several prospective biographers fell through, the first group of Harrison papers was deposited in the Library on March 1, 1915, under the restriction that the collection was not to be consulted without Mrs. Harrison’s permission. The deposit was converted to a gift on June 2, 1933, at which time the William Henry Harrison Papers were established as a distinct group.\n\nMrs. Harrison and the Library continued to cooperate in efforts to organize the collection for a biographer, as well as to locate a writer suitable to the undertaking. Through the efforts of Professor Albert T. Volwiler to provide materials for the long-planned biography, other significant additions were made to the collection over the two decades of his intensive and exclusive use of the papers. In 1928, at Volwiler’s suggestion, the Library engaged E. Frank Tibbott, Harrison’s stenographer and private secretary for twelve years, to transcribe over 7,000 letters from his own shorthand notebooks. These transcripts filled many important gaps in the collection for the years of Harrison’s presidency and after, and are indicated in the Index to the Benjamin Harrison Papers by the abbreviation “TT.”\n\nOn April 24, 1945, Mrs. Harrison requested that the Harrison Papers be opened to the public. After other Harrison descendants converted Harrison’s letters to his first wife Caroline during the Civil War to an unrestricted gift, restrictions relative to use of the combined collections were removed on July 14, 1947.\n\nThe long wait for a Harrison biographer ended in 1948 when the Reverend Harry J. Sievers, S.J., began his work with the Harrison Papers, ultimately producing a three-volume biography, Benjamin Harrison. Father Sievers has told the story of both the collection and the search for a biographer in the preface to the second edition External of his first volume.\n\nA fuller history of the provenance of the collection was prepared for the Index to the Benjamin Harrison Papers, pp. v-vii, and was subsequently reproduced in the finding aid (PDF and HTML). A version appears on this website as the essay Provenance of the Benjamin Harrison Papers.\n\nDescription of Series\n\nThe Benjamin Harrison Papers are arranged in twenty-two series. A finding aid (PDF and HTML) to the collection is available online with links to the digital content on this site.\n\nSeries 1: General Correspondence and Related Material, 1787-1912 (Reels 1-43)\n\nConsists primarily of correspondence, some of which is in transcript and photostat form. The material is arranged chronologically. Within each day, outgoing letters are arranged by the name of the addressee, whereas letters received by Harrison are arranged by the name of the sender. Where two transcripts are typed on one page, alphabetical arrangement is by the recipient of the first letter. Some related material, including essays and speeches, is included in the general chronological sequence with letters sent.\n\nSeries 2: Additional Correspondence and Related Items, 1853-1909 (Reels 43-97)\n\nContains correspondence omitted from Series 1 and some enclosures to letters in that series. Included is important correspondence for the 1888-1889 period, some Tibbott transcripts (identified as “TT” in the Index to the Benjamin Harrison Papers), invitations, and some legal correspondence. The arrangement is the same as that of Series 1.\n\nSeries 3: Letter Press Copy Book, 1880-1892 (Reels 97-98)\n\nComprises letters sent by Harrison from December 16, 1880, to May 28, 1888, which are generally followed by transcripts.

The volume contains an index.\n\nSeries 4: Telegrams, 1888-1889 (Reels 98-99)\n\nConsists primarily of telegrams received by Harrison related to four important political events: the Republican National Convention at which Harrison was nominated for president, June 22-30, 1888; the election, November 2-12, 1888; cabinet formation, February 6-March 6, 1889; and the inauguration on March 4, 1889. The telegrams are arranged chronologically and within each day alphabetically by correspondent.

Letters of Alice Sanger and other notes of legal cases, speeches, etc., are not transcribed.\n\nSeries 7: Record of Letters Received at the White House, 1889-1893 (Reels 116-117)\n\nEntries in each bound volume include the name of writer, a notation on the subject of the letter, the date it was received, and the department or agency to which the letter was referred. The entries are listed alphabetically by first initial of surname and therein by the date of receipt.\n\nSeries 8: Speeches, 1878-1901 (Reels 117-121)\n\nIncludes Harrison’s notes, drafts, reading copies, and printed copies of campaign speeches, special messages to Congress, and post presidential lectures and speeches.

Following the Ladies Home Journal articles is the revised and supplemented text that formed Harrison’s book, This Country of Ours (1897). Galley and page proofs with annotations of the book follow the manuscript.\n\nSeries 10: Legal Instruments, 1852-1898 (Reels 122-123)\n\nEncompasses deeds, petitions, agreements, and other legal documents, which are arranged chronologically.\n\nSeries 11: Legal Cases and Firm Letter Press Copy Books, circa 1855-1900 (Reels 123-135)\n\nThe cases in this series are arranged alphabetically by the first party named.
