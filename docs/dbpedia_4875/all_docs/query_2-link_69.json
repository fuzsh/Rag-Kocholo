Harrison in 165 just before his death and from data written on the fly leaf of an old Prayer Book known as the \"HARRISON - POWELL PRAYER BOOK\" and for many years in the possession of Misses Anne Maria and Elizabeth C. Harrison of Leesburg, Virginia, and further from family letters and traditions and also notes made by many of its members from time to time.\n\nThe coat of arms of the Harrison family is an azure shield upon which are three demi lions rampant. The crest, a demi lion rampant or holding a laurel branch or semi wreath. The motton Vincit Qui, Patitur. This description is taken from the Harrison - Powell Prayer book and checked by research in the Congressional Lirbary and is further vouched for by family history transmitted down by word of mouth from generation to generation and also by written family notes. According to documentary evidence, it was granted in 1593 to Sir Thomas Harrison, knight, Lord Mayor of the City and Ainsty of York, England, from whom Cuthbert Harrison, I, was directly descended.\n\nThe First Harrisons to come to Viringia, according to the best information obtainable, were Cuthbert Harrison, Esq., of Ancaster, Caxtn and Flaxby, Yorkshire, England, and his son, Burr, II, who according to the reisterof Dettingen Parish, Prince William County, Virginia, was baptised in the Parish of St. Margaretts, Westminster, England, on the twenth-eight of December, 1637, and on this register he is spoken of as \"Burr Harrison of Chappawmsic\". . . son of Cuthbert Harrison.\" when Cuthbert Harrison, Ind his son, Burr, II, first came to Virginia is unknown.\n\nCuthbert Harrison I, with his son, Burr II, settled in then Stafford County, Virginia, on the northern side of the Chappawamsic Creek near Dumfries and there today lies the old estate called \"Cahappawamsic,\" ith its quaint old grave yad, where once lived and now rest, so far as known, the first Harrisons of our line who came to America.

Some original documents establishing dates, signed by Colonel Levin Powell, Burr Powell, Cuthbert Harrison V and Mathew Harrison VI, commencing with the year 1777 and ending with the year 1815.\n\nFrom letter and documentary evidence in my possession and from court, church, army and navy records, it is most conclusively shown and proven that from the date of the arrival of the first Harrisons of the Cuthbert Harrison line in Virginia up to the present time this family has been a family of power and strength in every community in which they resided.\n\nThey have been large land owners, as shown by grants and deeds. They have filled many high positions in the army, navy and militia, as shown by records of these departments and original letters.\n\nThey have preached the gospel to their fellowmen, as shown by parish registers and parish records. They have practised law and dispensed justice. they have convened in council with others of their day and hour and aided in the formation and adoption of many of the laws they have obeyed and enforced.\n\nThey have gathered at their country's call in her hours of need and her hours of pleasure. They have as men been respected and honored and as women loved and cherished, and to them, one and all, living and dead this little book is affectionately dedicated.\n\nEnd of book\n\nI hope you all enjoyed this and maybe found information helpful to you!\n\nSubmitted by Cary Schooling Campbell Yakima, WA.\n\nThe Harrison Genealogy Repository http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~harrisonrep\n\nLast Updated: 18 May 1999"
