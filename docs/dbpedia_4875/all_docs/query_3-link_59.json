        "text": "Trump reacts to securing enough delegates to win GOP nomination: \"This was a great day of victory\"\n\nFormer President Donald Trump celebrated earning enough delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination, calling Tuesday a “great day of victory.”\n\nTrump reached the 1,215 delegates necessary with an allocation of delegates from Washington state.\n\n“We’re not going to take time to celebrate. We’ll celebrate in eight months when the election is over. November 5, I believe, will go down as the most important day in the history of our country,” Trump continued in a video posted by his campaign on X.\n\nTrump will be officially nominated at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this July.\n\nTrump also touched on some of his usual campaign issues including immigration and energy production.\n\nCNN Projection: Trump will win Washington's primary and secure enough delegates for GOP nomination\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has earned enough delegates to secure the Republican presidential nomination, according to a projection from the CNN Decision Desk.\n\nTrump reached the 1,215 delegates necessary with an allocation of delegates from Washington state.\n\nTrump will be officially nominated at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee this July.\n\nHarris previews 2024 election talking points as she celebrates Biden clinching the nomination\n\nVice President Kamala Harris celebrated Joe Biden securing the delegates needed to clinch his party’s nomination on Tuesday and forecasted how the president’s campaign will look to take the fight to Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nHarris hit Trump over his role in overturning of Roe v. Wade, his signaling Monday to CNBC that Social Security and Medicare could be cut and his past praise for autocrats.\n\n“Now, the general election truly begins, and the contrast could not be clearer. Donald Trump is a threat to our democracy and our fundamental freedoms,” she added.\n\nEarlier this evening, Biden said he is honored to become his party’s presumptive nominee and warned of another Trump presidency.\n\n\"Could there be two worse options?\": Some Georgia voters consider not going to the polls in November\n\nA group of undecided voters in Atlanta, Georgia, said they are not enthusiastic about voting for either President Joe Biden or former President Trump in the November general election, the presumptive nominees for each of their parties.\n\nIn the important swing state, some voters said their disillusion with both candidates could keep them from voting at all.\n\nHe said he feels like too much is at stake not to vote and he is considering casting his ballot for a third-party candidate.\n\nAnother independent voter who has voted for both Democrats and Republicans in the past said that while she is “not a Trump fan,” she also thinks Biden is too old to be president.\n\n“I also think both candidates are so polarizing that it’s hard for our country to get behind anyone,” she said.\n\nOne Democrat said she liked Haley, but now that she is out of the race, she might not vote in November. That was echoed by another voter who said Haley “had all the elements of what I look for in a president.” Now he said he will most likely vote for Trump.\n\nHow delegates select nominees at conventions\n\nThe Republican National Convention is scheduled to be held July 15-18 in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Democratic National Convention will be held August 19-22 in Chicago. Delegates at both these conventions will formally select their parties’ nominees, who will then face off in November’s presidential election.\n\nHere’s how the delegates work:\n\nWhat is a delegate: Performing well in primaries and caucuses equals delegates, and the larger goal is amassing the magic number of delegates to secure a nomination before delegate voting at the party convention. It takes 1,215 of 2,429 delegates to win the Republican nomination and it takes 1,968 of 3,934 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nHow are delegates allotted: During most of the early primaries and caucuses, states award delegates proportionally. That means that each candidate gets a number of delegates roughly equivalent to the percentage of the vote he or she has won. Delegates can be awarded based on results either statewide or in individual congressional districts. This process continues to play out even if the outcome is assured — as is currently the case for both President Joe Biden and Donald Trump.\n\nThere are different types of delegates:\n\n“Pledged” or “bound” delegates: A delegate who pledges (on the Democratic side) or is bound (on the Republican side) to support a certain presidential candidate at the national convention. The amount of freedom these delegates have to support other candidates varies by state, by party, and by circumstances.\n\n“Superdelegates,” “unpledged” or “unbound” delegates: Republicans have 142 “unbound” delegates who are not technically required to support the candidate who won their state at the outset of the convention and are free to support the candidate of their choice. In the Democratic Party, there are “unpledged” or “automatic” delegates — also known as “superdelegates.” All members of Congress, Democratic governors and other key party leaders are automatically superdelegates. They can no longer vote on the first ballot for president if they can mathematically affect the outcome.\n\nRead more about delegates and how the primaries work.\n\nCNN Projection: Biden will win Georgia’s primary and secure enough delegates for Democratic nomination\n\nPresident Joe Biden has earned enough delegates to secure the Democratic presidential nomination, according to a projection from the CNN Decision Desk.\n\nBiden reached the 1,968 delegates necessary with an allocation of delegates from Georgia.\n\nBiden will officially be nominated at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this August.\n\nThere are headwinds for Trump in Georgia – many of his own making\n\nAfter former President Donald Trump became the first GOP presidential candidate to lose Georgia in 24 years, he lashed out at statewide Republican officeholders, baselessly accusing them of concealing widespread voter fraud. In a phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger two months after the 2020 election, Trump pressed Georgia election officials to “find” the votes needed to overturn the election result.\n\nShortly after his defeat, the state’s two Republican senators – David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler – lost their respective runoff contests against Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, handing Democrats a slim Senate majority at the beginning of Biden’s presidency. Many in the party blamed Trump’s election denialism and criticism of mail-in ballots for lower party turnout in those runoff contests.\n\nTrump attributed his 2020 loss to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger, both of whom refused to aid him in overturning the election in the state. Trump personally recruited primary challengers to both men in 2022, though Kemp and Raffensperger prevailed and won reelection. Trump has since been indicted for his alleged efforts to interfere in the 2020 election in the state – making Georgia home to one of several legal battles he faces while running for president.\n\nOne Republican strategist in the state said Trump’s antics there have hardened many swing voters against the former president. In 2022, that resulted in a sizable number of conservative-leaning independents and moderates splitting their tickets, voting for Kemp for governor but Warnock for Senate. Notably, Trump and Kemp have not reconciled, though Kemp last year said he would vote for the former president over Biden. Kemp was not invited to Trump’s rally in the state.\n\nEven Republicans rooting for Trump to succeed are unconvinced whether he can make the necessary adjustments to win Georgia. “It depends on Trump. I want to see a gracious winner,” said Jule Windham, the local Republican Party chairman of Macon County in Middle Georgia.\n\nOne senior adviser told CNN that Trump’s team expects to build out its campaign operations in Georgia in the coming weeks. His messaging, though, has already shifted to the general election, particularly seizing on national angst over the flow of migrants crossing the US-Mexico border.\n\nRead more about Trump’s campaign efforts in the state.\n\nFederal judge approves Trump's bond in civil defamation case with E. Jean Carroll\n\nA federal judge approved Donald Trump’s $91.63 million bond on Tuesday in his civil defamation case with E. Jean Carroll.\n\nTrump posted the bond secured by the insurance company Chubb last week and Carroll’s legal team did not object. The bond covers 110% of the judgment amount, which is a common requirement by the district court.\n\nA federal jury awarded Carroll $83.3 million in damages last month over Trump’s defamatory public statements attacking Carroll and denying her rape allegations against him.\n\nEnforcement of that judgment is now paused while Trump’s appeal plays out.\n\nGeorgia's Kemp says he will support GOP nominee in November because Trump is \"better than Joe Biden\"\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp said Tuesday that he would back the Republican Party’s nominee in November, although he did not specify whether he voted for former President Donald Trump in the state’s GOP primary.\n\nTrump and Kemp have had a strained relationship, and the governor refrained from endorsing the former president in the primary.\n\nWhen the governor’s office was asked to clarify his primary vote, press secretary Garrison Douglas responded, “In today’s gaggle with reporters, the Governor stated that he voted in the Republican Primary for president and will support the GOP nominee in November.”\n\nKemp resisted pressure from Trump to overturn the 2020 election results, a decision that put him and the former president at odds and led Trump to call on Kemp to resign and recruit and endorse Kemp’s GOP challenger in the 2022 election\n\nAsked Tuesday why he’d back Trump given their history, Kemp said, “Well, I think he’d be better than Joe Biden, it’s as simple as that.”\n\nHe did not say whether he would campaign with Trump, instead saying his “main goal” will be to maintain Republicans’ majority in Georgia’s legislature.\n\nClarification: The headline and story have been updated to clarify how Kemp characterized whom he voted for in Georgia’s GOP primary.\n\nBiden and Teamsters talk Social Security and Medicare as president courts endorsement\n\nJoe Biden discussed his records with labor unions as well as protecting Social Security and Medicare in his meeting with the Teamsters on Tuesday as the president competes with Donald Trump for the crucial union vote ahead of November.\n\nBiden “appreciated the opportunity to discuss his historic, pro-union record with the Teamsters today,” his campaign said in a statement after the president’s meeting with the group, pointing to a slew of endorsements from labor unions the campaign has already accrued and noting that “we hope to earn the support of the Teamsters as well.”\n\nAccording to the campaign, Biden and the group “agreed on the importance of protecting Social Security and Medicare, so that workers who have paid into them their entire career can retire with dignity.”\n\nThe Biden campaign has criticized GOP front-runner Trump for comments he made during an interview with CNBC on Monday in which the former president suggested Social Security and Medicare could be cut.\n\nThe Biden campaign said the president and members of the Teamsters “celebrated what has been a historic year for unions,” touting a number of milestones, including Biden’s move to walk the United Auto Workers picket line in September, while trumpeting endorsements from the AFL-CIO, AFSCME, AFT, UAW and other unions."
