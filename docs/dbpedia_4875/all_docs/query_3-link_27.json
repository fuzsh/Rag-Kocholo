Discussions of his presidency frequently focus on the ephemeral, such as the fatal illness he contracted while delivering his inaugural address – the longest ever – in the bitter cold. The address itself, one of the most extraordinary and bizarre state papers in U. S. history, has largely escaped the serious notice of historians, political scientists, and legal scholars. Harrison proposed nothing short of a constitutional revolution that would have reduced the chief executive to a mere figurehead. This paper explores the many peculiarities of Harrison’s address, including the Whig theory of the presidency, a radical and overlooked innovation that aimed to fundamentally alter the role of the chief executive in the constitutional order. A close reading of Harrison’s inaugural and brief tenure as president also reveals a number of factual errors and interpretative missteps made by leading scholars of the period.\n\n“Sir, I wish you to understand the true principles of government. I wish them carried out. I ask nothing more.” These were the last words spoken by William Henry Harrison shortly before he died on April 4, 1841, a month after his inauguration as the first Whig president. That Harrison’s injunction was addressed to his physician instead of his successor, Vice-President John Tyler, made little difference in the end. Tyler, a Virginian who had been placed on the ticket to attract Southern voters and disaffected Democrats, was a WINO (Whig-in-name-only) whose frequent vetoes of Whig measures led to the mass resignation of his cabinet and his ejection from the party. As a result, Harrison’s presidency is remembered for little more than its short duration. His profile in presidential listings is correspondingly thin and he is typically omitted from presidential rankings altogether. The most frequently chronicled event of his brief tenure in office is his inaugural address, the longest ever. Running to some 9,000 words, the nearly two hour address was delivered in the bitter cold by the sixty-eight-year-old Harrison who declined to wear a hat, gloves, or an overcoat. The pneumonia he later contracted and which claimed his life is often attributed to his exposure to the elements on that blustery day.\n\nA Most Peculiar Address\n\nThe address itself has received little sustained attention. And yet it is one of the most remarkable state papers in American history. Besides its inordinate length, Harrison’s inaugural is notable on a number of counts. First, its composition and final form involved two of the era’s leading statesmen, Daniel Webster and Henry Clay. While accounts vary, it seems that Harrison wrote it, Webster edited it, and Clay tried to edit it further, but was prevented by Harrison. What is truly remarkable, however, is the style and content. The style – high-toned and stately – was in stark contrast to Harrison’s popular image as a rough-hewn frontiersman who had been born in a log cabin. He was, in fact, the son of a wealthy Virginia planter, a delegate to the Continental Congress, and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. William Henry had attended Hampton-Sydney College, where he developed a love for history and the classics. Yet few outside of his immediate circle knew of his pretensions to learning: for most Americans “Old Tip” was simply a frontier military hero.\n\nThose who expected to hear a plain speech by a plain man on that frigid March day were either pleasantly surprised or sorely disappointed. What they heard instead was an address studded with classical allusions and punctuated with historical analogies, including references to such figures as Julius Caesar, Oliver Cromwell, and Simon Bolívar. More remarkable still was the use to which Harrison deployed these conceits, for the address is in large part a jeremiad on the temptations of power and the corruption and overthrow of free governments. The theme of tyranny lurking in the shadows was as old as ancient Rome, but for Americans, who (in the words of Edmund Burke) “snuff the approach of tyranny in every tainted breeze,” it was a perennial trope of political discourse. Yet never has a sitting president – in an inaugural or any other address – forecast the approach of “despotism” in America, much less attributed its advance to the love of power, defects in the Constitution, and a former president. Nor has a president ever propounded a vision of executive power that if realized would have reduced the president to a mere figurehead. William Henry Harrison, strangely enough, did both.\n\n“King Andrew” and the Rise of the Whigs\n\nMuch of the inaugural’s grave tone and florid language can be attributed to the rabid partisanship and overheated rhetoric of the times, but Harrison’s inaugural remains a unique statement in the annals of presidential lore. It is also a landmark in constitutional history, for never before or since has a sitting president proposed such fundamental changes in the structure and workings of the executive branch. According to Harrison and the Whigs, executive power had become the engine of a looming “despotism” under the presidencies of Andrew Jackson (1829-37) and his successor Martin Van Buren (1837-41). The Whig party itself was formed in opposition to Jackson’s alleged abuses, particularly his misuse of the veto and removal powers. Critics of Jackson, such as Clay and Webster, repeatedly charged him with “executive usurpation” and maintained that his repeated abuse of presidential power amounted to a “revolution” in the constitutional order. Not only did Jackson misuse his powers, the Whigs argued, but he had the audacity to pose as the direct representative of all the people and claim to possess a mandate to thwart the will of Congress. The assertion that the president sits as the “the people’s tribune” was viewed by Whigs as a dangerous innovation, indeed, a lethal “corruption” in the theory and practice of republican government.\n\nFor many of his critics, Jackson’s unilateral removal of public monies from federal banks (after replacing two treasury secretaries who refused to do his bidding) was the last straw. In response to this attempt to “unite the purse with the sword,” the Senate censured Jackson for his precipitous action, the first and only time either house of Congress has censured a president. The election of Van Buren, Jackson’s hand-picked successor, only reinforced the Whig contention that the nation was drifting toward an “elective monarchy.” It was at this time that opponents of Jackson-Van Buren began to organize themselves and place an official stamp on what had previously been a loose coalition of disaffected groups. Thus was born the second two-party system of Whigs and Democrats that lasted until the sectional crisis of the mid-1850s.\n\nThe financial panic and depression that followed Van Buren’s inauguration set the stage for the Whig triumph in the election of 1840. The party nominated Harrison for president as a kind of anti-Jackson, a frontier military hero who would restore executive power to its limited constitutional role. As envisioned, power would shift back to Congress where the framers of the Constitution had wisely placed it, and where party leaders such as Henry Clay would direct administration policy. Harrison would be the vehicle for this “counter-revolution” and his inaugural address would set out the proper role of the executive in the constitutional order. This downsized role would come to be known as the “Whig theory of the presidency.”\n\nAs might be expected, the Whig theory of executive power did not spring like Athena from the head of Zeus, but began as a series of ad hoc responses to the perceived abuses of a sitting president and only gradually developed into a coherent if obtuse vision. In this sense, the “theory” was almost entirely negative in origins. On the other hand, there was historical precedent for the idea of a largely passive chief executive in the administrations between Jefferson and Jackson (1809-29), when presidential power reached its nadir and Congress (especially the House of Representatives) emerged as the dominant branch of government. The Whigs took this two-decade period as the norm of executive-legislative relations, and believed Jackson’s bold measures had tipped the constitutional scales to the point of disfiguring the republican character of the American regime. It is within this context that Harrison’s address must be read in order to be fully understood.\n\nOccasion and Reception\n\nThe principal interest here is not simply historical, but also rhetorical, for it is not merely the Whig theory of the presidency that strikes an odd chord in the modern ear, but the entire address is highly idiosyncratic in its mode of expression, use of allusions, and choice of words. It is also extraordinary for its political alarmism and criticism of the Constitution. Finally, Harrison’s address is noteworthy for the broader context in which specific observations are placed and related. That context is the history of republics, ancient and modern. Harrison draws on this history to illustrate by way of analogy the perils and promise of popular government in America. In the process he develops something like a theory of republican government, particularly in terms of its foundations, subversion, and renewal. While wholly derivative in character, the presence of an archaic political sermon in an inaugural address further adds to the novelty of what is arguably the most curious, even bizarre state paper ever to issue from a sitting president. The remainder of this article will explore these novel aspects of Harrison’s address and attempt to assess their significance in American political development.\n\nIt is unknown if Harrison consulted previous inaugural addresses when he composed his own, but he was certainly aware of the what was, by the time of his own investiture, a fifty-year tradition. It was a tradition he chose to challenge, not only by the length of his address, but by its style and content as well. And yet in terms of the generic qualities associated with inaugural addresses (as identified by modern scholars), it met all the requirements.\n\nPresidential inaugurals are a subspecies of the kind of discourse that Aristotle called epideictic, a form of rhetoric that praises or blames on ceremonial occasions, invites the audience to evaluate the speaker’s performance, recalls the past and speculates about the future while focusing on the present, employs a noble, dignified literary style, and amplifies or rehearses admitted facts.\n\nIt should be added that this “subspecies” of political rhetoric (the ceremonial) was judged “an inferior art form” by Aristotle. As such, presidential inaugurals are “rarely an occasion for original thought or stimulating reflection. The platitude quotient tends to be high, the rhetoric stately and self-serving, the ritual obsessive, and the surprises few.” Again, Harrison’s address fits the mold, with the possible exception of containing a few surprises. However, the novelty of “the president-elect’s mouldy paean to ancient Rome” cannot be determined by its conformity with generic criteria and classical forms. Indeed, beyond its length, the matter of distinctiveness turns in part upon the angle from which it is viewed, whether looking backward or forward for example. Only an examination of its specific features – particularly against the backdrop of the national politics of the 1830s – will provide the basis for an assessment of Harrison’s address.\n\nDid anyone at the time consider Harrison’s inaugural in any way distinct, odd, or novel? Daniel Webster, who was shown an advance copy of the address, found the frequent references to ancient statesmen peculiar and disturbing. After spending an entire day editing Harrison’s draft, his dinner hostess noted his weariness. Webster replied that he had good reason to look fatigued, for he had just “killed seventeen Roman proconsuls as dead as smelts, every one of them.” Beyond needless repetition and excessive length, Webster found Harrison’s use of classical analogies embarrassingly anachronistic – it had “no more to do with the affairs of the American government than a chapter in the Koran.” Apparently Henry Clay was no more impressed than Webster, for when shown the revised draft he suggested further changes. By this time, however, Harrison was determined to defend his sturdy Romans to a man; the “remaining allusions had become sacrosanct.”\n\nApparently the press and the public were not as fastidious as Webster and Clay, for there are few contemporary references to the classical allusions or historical parallels in Harrison’s address. A clerk with the British consul did refer to the speech as “pedantic and ridiculous,” but on the whole (writes a Harrison biographer) “the inaugural was [besides its length] considered a good one …” Washington newspapers were more disposed to describe the pomp and identify dignitaries than comment on the content of the address. Two days after the inauguration, the pro-Whig National Register provided such ephemeral details, but deferred discussion of “the character of the paper … to a more leisurely moment.” The moment never arrived.\n\nThe Classical Turn\n\nIf the learned found Harrison’s allusions trite and tedious, less educated Americans were more likely to find them arcane and innocuous. Both audiences, however, knew that popular government originated in ancient Greece and that Rome was the seat of the greatest republic. Indeed, comparisons between the classical world and the American republic were ubiquitous during the Founding era and beyond. Since the history of Greece and Rome ended in the loss of liberty, such references usually took the form of a cautionary tale. (The treatment of the failed Hellenic confederacies in The Federalist is a notable example.) The influence of the classical republican tradition was also apparent in the symbols and slogans adopted by the American government, from the Roman eagle to Latinate inscriptions. By the time the Constitution was adopted, the American regime and its people were officially and emphatically republican; and republicanism was not just one creed among many – it was the holy grail of political salvation.\n\nWhy then should Harrison’s references to a “virtuous and indignant Roman” (106) or a “proud democrat of Athens” (107) be dismissed as tiresome and silly? As one scholar has noted, “the frequency of his classical allusions [was in part] an effort to place American government in a broader context than its own brief history and to use the ancient republics to provide cautionary warnings.” Another has characterized Harrison as “a striking example of the classical revival fostered by the supposed affinity of the new American republic with those of Greece and Rome.” Ironically, the truth of these statements helps explain the annoyance of Clay and Webster. By 1840, as America entered the Railroad Age, whatever loose parallel might be drawn between the ancient republics and the United States had become highly tenuous. Yet even in the mouths of Jefferson or Madison, Harrison’s reference to “Octavius” and “Antony” would have sounded odd, particularly when followed by “the days of Camullis and the Scipios.” And even if Harrison’s audience was familiar with these famous Romans, could they be expected to know the “Curtii” and the “Decii” as well? (122).\n\nHad Harrison been delivering a scholarly paper, such antique name-dropping may have been appropriate, but in an inaugural address, a species of rhetoric that (among other things) seeks to unify the audience, it was embarrassingly out of place. Similarly, the attempt to place the American republic in a larger context was ill-conceived insofar as the ancient world was just that, ancient, and too foreign to provide a meaningful template for the United States. Even in the Founding era, the best-informed writers recognized that the unique and modern nature of the American frames of government made “reasoning from the one case to the other” of limited usefulness (Federalist No. 63). A half century later, such reasoning in the form of Harrison’s classicisms would strike men like Clay and Webster as hopelessly antiquarian. As such, Webster may be credited for thinning the ranks of Harrison’s Roman legions, but as a recent observer has noted, “[h]e should have killed more,” for even in its edited form the address was “a martyr to misplaced erudition …”\n\nA few examples will serve to show that Harrison’s “Roman holiday” was not only unseasonable, but somewhat less than erudite. While warning against the dangers of presidential control of the public revenues, he refers to the “first Roman Emperor” who “seize[d] the sacred treasure, [and] silenced the opposition of the officer to whose charge it had been committed by a significant allusion to his sword” (114). He then compares the president’s removal power to Caesar’s more ominous threat. (This was a thinly veiled reference to Jackson’s removal of the bank deposits and the dismissal of two treasury secretaries who stood in his way.) The story is found in at least three ancient sources, but the version closest to Harrison’s appears in Appian’s Roman History (c. 150 AD). Here it is related that Julius Caesar, upon entering Rome after crossing the Rubicon, raided a hitherto untouched and sacred body of wealth, and threatened to kill the tribune who blocked the doors. Cassius Dio, writing somewhat later, does not place Caesar at the scene, but states that the money was taken to pay his soldiers. Finally, the incident is dramatized in Lucan’s poem “Pharsalia” (c. 65 AD), which presents an indignant tribune, Lucius Metellus, barring the sanctuary of Saturn’s temple from Caesar’s troops. After he is forced to yield, the soldiers enter and seize upon the riches. “Thus was robbed the shrine, / And Caesar first brought poverty to Rome.”\n\nGiven the obscurity of the event it is unlikely that many in Harrison’s audience had ever heard of it. Some may even have thought he was referring to Caesar Augustus, who was typically identified as the first Roman emperor. Moreover, at the time he seized the treasure, Julius Caesar was a general: only after defeating his Roman enemies was he named dictator in perpetuity. As the head of the government, he actually augmented the public treasury and left much of his personal fortune to the people of Rome. These details, however, were overshadowed by the obvious parallels between Jackson and Caesar: both were generals, both were demagogues, and both cast themselves as the protector of the people. Under Caesar the Senate shrank into insignificance, power was centralized, and the Roman republic was transformed into a dictatorship. Under Jackson the Congress was eclipsed, executive power mushroomed, and the American republic verged on an “elective monarchy.” This, at least, was the parallel Harrison sought to draw, however obliquely and without mentioning Jackson by name.\n\nAn even less felicitous analogy is Harrison’s comparison between the agitation of American abolition societies and the imperial policy of ancient Athens. Without identifying these societies, Harrison likens their petitions to “the recommendations of Athens to her allies, supported by an armed and powerful fleet,” and attributes the “destruction of that celebrated Confederacy” (the Delian League) to misguided attempts by “the leading States of Greece to control the domestic concerns of the others” (118). The reader of Thucydides might recall how Athens’ dominance of the League and high-handed policy led to the break-up of the alliance and the onset of the fratricidal Peloponnesian War. Insofar as the abolition movement contributed to the onset of the American Civil War, the parallel is not entirely without prescience, yet it is problematic on a number of levels. First, an abolition society is not a city-state and certainly not a hegemonic one such as Athens, which could dictate policy to the lesser members of a league. Second, Athens did not typically seek to control the domestic institutions of its allies, least of all slavery, but simply attempted to insure their loyalty and compel their support.\n\nWorse still is Harrison’s citation of the “Helvetic Confederacy” as a counter-example to the Delian League. Unlike the meddlesome Greek states, the several Swiss cantons are praised for embodying a spirit of tolerance in the face of strong religious and political differences (118-19). Harrison implies Americans should emulate this spirit in regard to their own strong disagreements, viz., over slavery and the tariff. In truth, the Swiss were considerably less tolerant than Harrison suggests, and his contention that the cantons had for centuries enjoyed “harmony in their intercourse and permanency in their alliances” does not bear historical scrutiny. Switzerland was hardly immune from the convulsions of the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, but was often a battleground in both periods. Popular revolts against the rich and powerful were endemic throughout the eighteenth-century, and the French Revolution brought war, conquest, and foreign occupation. Only with the Restoration (1815) did Switzerland regain its independence, but sectarian strife continued to mar cantonal relations for years to come. Ironically, at the very time Harrison was praising the Swiss, “these sagacious people” were moving towards civil war. Peace, stability, and working federalism in Switzerland, date from the adoption of the Constitution of 1848, years after Harrison was in the grave.\n\nDemagogues and the Democracy\n\nHarrison was on firmer ground in his allusions to Caesar, Cromwell, and Bolívar as examples of popular leaders who in the name of “democracy” stirred up the multitude “against the wealth and the danger of aristocracy,” and then “usurp[ed] the government of their country.” This passage punctuates a section on the perennial threats to republics, viz., the love of power and demagoguery: “the unwillingness of the people to believe in its existence or … the influence of designing men diverting their attention from the quarter whence it approaches to the source from which it can never come” (120). The subtext, of course, is the dangers of popular politics in Jacksonian America. As powdered hair and culottes gave way to trousers and top hats, political life in the age of Jackson underwent an equally dramatic makeover. The addition of several states in the West and the elimination of voting qualifications in others transformed national politics from the pastime of gentlemen into a boisterous, rollicking free-for-all. The political culture so memorably captured in Tocqueville’s Democracy in America (1832-35) was not the patrician world of Washington, Jefferson, and Adams, but the shirt-sleeve republic of Jackson, Calhoun, and Clay. Tocqueville lamented the decline in the quality of political parties and leadership, but acknowledged that the forces unleashed by Jacksonian democracy were irreversible.\n\nUnder such changed conditions, the accusation that one was an “Aristocrat” or even a “Federalist” was often politically lethal. From the ashes of the first-party system arose “the Democracy,” and all who aspired to public office had to court its rough-handed, hard-drinking denizens. This often placed the Whigs, who were said to “know each other by the instincts of gentlemen” at a distinct disadvantage. In opposing Jackson, they opposed “the Democracy,” and were often vilified for their alleged contempt for the common man and denounced as defenders of wealth and privilege. The Whigs’ poor showing in 1836 led them to adopt the organizational methods and electoral strategies of the Democrats, culminating in the hoopla-filled “Log Cabin and Hard Cider” campaign of 1840. To onlookers the Whigs appeared to have taken a leaf out of the Democracy’s handbook. As one rueful Democrat observed in the wake of the Whig landslide, “We have taught them how to conquer us!”\n\nIn warning of demagogues who would distract the people with the hobgoblin of aristocracy, Harrison was again referencing Jackson and the Democrats, who often portrayed Whigs as elitists and snobs. The real danger to liberty in republics was not from aristocracy, but from democratic Caesarism, for “[t]here is … no instance on record of an extensive and well-established republic changed into an aristocracy” (120). (Here Harrison was technically correct, if only because there had been no republic worthy of the name since ancient times.) “[M]onarchy,” rather, is the tendency “of all such governments in their decline,” wherein the “spirit of faction” masquerades as the “genuine spirit of freedom,” and beguiles the people of their liberty (120-21). Again, the reference to “monarchy” was but another swipe at Jackson, who was often portrayed as “King Andrew” in the opposition press. The attack on the “imperial presidency” did not commence with the New Deal or Watergate, but in the Age of Jackson.\n\nThe Religious Turn\n\nThe notion that a well-disposed, liberty loving people might be duped by the wiles of a crafty demagogue is another perennial trope of republicanism. In developing this theme, Harrison follows up his historical examples with a striking religious allusion that is without parallel in the history of inaugural addresses. For Harrison, bewitching demagogues are “like the false Christs whose coming was foretold by the Savior” (121). The reference to “false Christs” appears in Matthew 24:24, where Jesus elliptically adumbrates the “time of tribulations” preceding the Apocalypse. What makes this reference so remarkable is not its religious nature, but its specifically Christian quality. It was common enough for presidents to invoke the Deity and even cite Scripture in their addresses, but the former convention typically expressed itself in references to the “Creator” or the “Almighty,” while citations from Scripture tended to draw on the wisdom of Psalms or Proverbs as opposed to the evangel of the New Testament. This remains the case in our own day. No other president, however, has used the word “Christ” (albeit in its plural, inverted form) or referred to “the Savior” in an inaugural address.\n\nEarlier in the address, Harrison makes three further religious references, each quite conventional, but not without significance. First he declares his intention to place his “chief confidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power” in order to resist the “dangerous temptations” of high office (107, 106). The context is a parable on the tendency of power to corrupt and the “violated confidence” of the people. Harrison’s recurrence to this theme throughout the address borders on the obsessive, as the “love of power” – like the “love of gold” – winds itself into an inexorable law of public betrayal ending in the loss of freedom (110). The declaration that a reliance on God would be his principal source of restraint may have been intended as an expression of humility, but if taken literally its implications appear more peculiar than pious.\n\nInsofar as the Whig party had originated in opposition to the specter of “executive usurpation” and was identified with the theory of a “weak” president, Harrison’s appeal to an “Almighty Power” was like the deus ex machina of ancient drama, adventitious and incongruent. Was not the Constitution itself, which Harrison and the Whigs pledged to restore to its original health, a sufficient curb on the love of power? As governor of Indiana Territory (1801-13), Harrison possessed even greater relative power than the president, with an absolute veto over legislation and unfettered power to appoint all territorial officials. Yet for his probity and success in this and other “important but still greatly inferior trusts,” Harrison credits the same “Almighty Power” that “protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable issue” the people’s business (107). In the mind of the new president, it was a business in which God had been a silent but apparently enthusiastic partner.\n\nThe Deity appears again in a long paragraph on the popular foundations and limited scope of government under the Constitution. Having distinguished a democracy, with sovereign power residing in the will of the majority, from a proper constitutional system in which only those powers delegated may be exercised, Harrison further distinguishes the latter from “government by divine right” (107). In England, rule by divine right had gone out with the Stuarts, a full century before the United States became a nation. Its mere mention in a presidential address of 1841 was not only anachronistic, but slightly absurd. It did, however, give Harrison the opportunity to invoke the “Beneficent Creator,” who, like Jefferson’s Deity, created all men equal and made the people the fount of public authority. It also provided Harrison the chance to illustrate the difference between a democracy and a limited government with yet another reference to his beloved pagans. Whereas the popular governments of Greece and Rome could deprive citizens of property and liberty by a majority vote, citizens of the United States possessed certain unalienable rights and its government was limited to specified powers. Religious freedom was among those spheres upon which government was not entitled to intrude. “It can interfere with no one’s faith, [nor] prescribe forms of worship for no one’s observance” (108). These and other basic liberties enjoyed by the American people reposed in the nature of man, as shaped by the “Almighty hand” of the Creator.\n\nWith the exception of “false Christs” and “the Savior” – a mere four words in an address of nearly 9,000 – Harrison’s religious references are few and fairly conventional for the times. That is, until one reaches the end of the address, where the religious theme takes a novel turn. After citing Jefferson (no little irony) he begins the penultimate paragraph with an expression of “a profound reverence for the Christian religion” followed by the profession of “a thorough conviction that sound morals, religious liberty, and a just sense of religious responsibility are essentially connected with all true and lasting happiness” (128). Ever since Washington identified religion and morality as necessary props of liberty and self-government, presidents have periodically invoked the Deity in public statements, but the specific mention (and personal endorsement) of the “Christian religion” in an inaugural address had but one antecedent (and this craftily qualified) and no real successors.\n\nIronically, the only prior mention of Christianity was by John Adams, a Unitarian who rejected the Trinity and the divinity of Christ. Adams’s reference occurs in the context of listing his qualifications for the presidency by way of a series of “if/then” propositions. “[I]f the veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians, and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service” (18), than he (Adams) merited the confidence of the people. This is hardly a ringing endorsement for Christianity per se, but it goes further in that direction than any other president prior to Harrison. After Harrison, “Christian” or “Christianity” would appear but twice more. James Buchanan, who preceded Lincoln in office, called for “a spirit of Christian benevolence towards our fellow man” (162), while Lincoln himself invoked “Christianity” – along with “[i]ntelligence [and] patriotism” – as guides that rendered Americans “still competent to adjust in the best way all our present difficulty” (174). Virtually every president before and after Lincoln has made some reference, however fleeting, to the Deity in the closing of his inaugural address. Many simply invoked “God” or “the Almighty,” while others sought the guidance of the “Supreme Being” or the favor of “Divine Providence.” One, William McKinley, even spoke with solicitude of the “Lord Most High.” None, however, has specified a religion by name coupled with a clear endorsement in the manner of Harrison.\n\nWhy did Harrison do this? Was he a particularly religious man? Accounts of Harrison’s religious beliefs and practices vary, but he is typically identified as an Episcopalian who periodically attended services. It is unclear, however, if he was ever a full communicant. Late in life he claimed to have read the Bible daily for the last twenty years, “[a]t first [as] … a matter of duty … it has now become a pleasure.” The day after his inauguration he purchased a Bible for the White House in which he inscribed “The President of the United States from the People of the United States.” This same Bible was placed on a covered table beside Harrison’s casket at his funeral. John Quincy Adams, who attended the funeral, attributed the following remarks to Reverend Hawley, the rector of St. John’s Episcopal Church.\n\n“He has since been in the habit of daily reading it [the purchased Bible]. He was accustomed not only to attend church, but to join audibly in the services, and to kneel humbly before his maker.” Dr. Hawley [Adams continued] stated that had the president lived, and been in health, he intended on the next Sabbath to become a communicant at the Lord’s table.\n\nThis entry in Adams’s diary has led one student of the religious beliefs of the presidents to conclude that “Harrison did not own a Bible, and had not thought religion worthy of his attention” until elected president. This is simply untrue. Harrison had helped establish Christ Episcopal Church in Cincinnati and served as a vestryman, though he apparently never became a member. His intention to take communion (and thereby join the church) suggests that religion had become more important to him late in life; hardly an odd occurrence. This in part explains the explicit references to Christianity in his inaugural address. The inference is reinforced by a letter he received after his election from an Episcopal bishop in Ohio. “Probably no President-elect,” writes a Harrison biographer, “ever received a more amazing letter.” In words that would prove prophetic, Reverend Charles P. McIlvaine expressed his fear for Harrison’s spiritual welfare in light of the rigors of office and his advanced age. “I feel for you deeply when I think of the vortex in which you are going, & how near, at your age, is Eternity.”\n\nThe crush of office-seekers, a bitter confrontation with Clay, and fiery clashes with his cabinet would prove a “vortex” that Harrison’s health (already weakened) could not withstand. Perhaps the bishop’s gloomy forecast moved the president-elect to greater reflection on mortality and judgment. Harrison may also have been moved by McIlvaine’s advice “to put the sign of the cross upon your Messages,” for this is precisely what he did in his inaugural address.\n\nExecutive Makeover (I): Tyranny and Term Limits\n\nThe idiosyncratic use of classical allusions, historical analogy, and religious expression gives Harrison’s address a novel quality, but its greater significance resides with his substantive remarks on the Constitution and strictures on the fate of republican government. We have seen that Harrison believed the government was drifting towards monarchy and attributed this “tendency” to the expansion of executive power under the guise of “democracy.” In his address, the image of a latent “despotism” emerges out of a critique of the Constitution as framed and interpreted. The power granted the government under the Constitution had admirably achieved its objects, but “disputes have arisen” over the proper limits of that power. Harrison assigns these to “the defect of language and the necessarily sententious manner in which the Constitution was written,” as well as the “intrinsic difficulty in many instances of ascertaining the intentions of the framers” (108). In the past these disputes had centered on the extent of legislative power, and particularly the meaning of the “necessary and proper” clause. The present danger, however, was not an overreaching legislature, but an encroaching executive, “the accumulation in one department of that which was assigned to the others.”\n\nIt is in this context that Harrison first uses the word “despotism” as the bête noir of popular government. The prospect was enhanced by the relative apathy of citizens towards “encroachments of one department upon another [rather] than upon their own reserved rights” (109). The Antifederalists, who opposed adoption of the Constitution, had warned against vesting too much power in the hands of a single executive and predicted “at no very remote period the Government would terminate in virtual monarchy.” Whether “the fears of these patriots have already been realized,” Harrison declined to say, but he did “sincerely believe that the tendency of measures and of men’s opinions for some years past have been in that direction …” Again, the reference is to Jackson (“measures”) and the Democracy (“opinions”), the avatars of popular monarchy in America.\n\nFrom what Harrison says elsewhere in the address, it seems clear that he believed the tendency toward monarchy was well-advanced, if not irreversible. And yet his pledge to “arrest [its] progress” will depend on “if it really exists”! (109, emphasis added). Was Harrison admitting that he and the Whigs might be wrong? Indeed, had not the election of an anti-Jackson president and an anti-Democracy Congress proven them wrong, and reduced their cries of “despotism” and “monarchy” to ridiculous hyperbole? In part, Harrison and the Whigs were trapped by their own rhetoric: a decade of fear-mongering could not be dispensed with overnight. Moreover, the Whig attack on executive power was not simply an assault on a person, but a critique of a particular view of the presidency (what scholars call the Jackson-Polk theory). It was also a critique of the office as originally designed by the framers of the Constitution. Accordingly, the elevation of Harrison and the Whigs did not resolve the underlying problem inherent in the office itself. It was to this problem that Harrison dedicated the largest part of his address.\n\nHarrison divides the “sources of the evils” in the government between those attributable to “defects in the Constitution” and those stemming from “a misconstruction of some of its provisions” (109). Among the former, the leading defect was the failure of the framers to limit the president to a single term in office. Given man’s love of power, this failure was a grave “error” that had been responsible for many “evils,” and may be expected to bring forth additional “bitter fruits … if it continues to disfigure our system.” In lieu of an amendment to the Constitution limiting the president’s term, safety must reside in “public opinion” and the voluntary renunciation of executive power. To this end, Harrison renewed his campaign pledge not to serve a second term.\n\nThe argument for a single term for the president by a president can be traced back to Thomas Jefferson and has been periodically repeated as recently as Jimmy Carter. (Jackson himself had called for a single term in his first annual address.) Harrison cites Jefferson’s recognition of this “error of the sages who framed the Constitution” (109), but completely overlooks the two-term tradition set by Washington and followed by all his successors. Had Washington been limited to one term the infant republic may not have survived the rancorous partisan struggles of the 1790s. The same may be said of Lincoln and the fate of the Union in the 1860s. On the other hand, Madison and Monroe served two terms at a time when presidential power reached its lowest ebb. Indeed, before Jackson’s presidency, the greatest abuse of executive power was arguably Jefferson’s attempt to enforce the Embargo Act, the only occasion the military has been used to routinely execute civilian law. The presidency of Franklin Roosevelt would appear to argue both for and against term limits. In any event, the Twenty-Second Amendment, which limits the president to two terms or ten years, owes nothing to Harrison and everything to F.D.R.\n\nExecutive Makeover (II): The Passive President\n\nIt may have made sense for sixty-eight year-old Harrison to serve a single term, yet the pledge to do so as an article of republican faith was misguided in the extreme. If not an act of political suicide, the vow to serve one term at the outset of his presidency was an unnecessary act of abnegation that could only weaken the office, particularly with respect to Congress. This, however, is precisely what Harrison had in mind. Turning to the “danger to public liberty” arising from the “misconstruction” of presidential power, he identifies executive influence in law-making as the foremost evil (110). The president’s duty to recommend legislation should not be construed as a power to influence the legislative process. Harrison’s strict reading of the vesting clause in Article I of the Constitution (“All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in the Congress”) not only proscribes executive influence in legislation, but reduces the president to a mere petitioner: the right to recommend “is a privilege which he holds in common with every other citizen.” In short, while it is his “duty” to suggest needed measures, the president’s recommendations should never set the agenda for legislation. For Harrison, law-making was the exclusive prerogative of Congress, and the Constitution limited the executive to a passive and perfunctory role.\n\nThe error of this view was not as apparent to Harrison’s audience as it is today, but many an informed observer surely balked at this caricature of executive power. Several important measures adopted by Congress prior to Jackson’s administration (e.g., the Bank, the Navy, the Louisiana Purchase) had originated with the president or his cabinet, and congressional support for executive initiatives was not seen as a violation of separation of powers. Jackson merely revived a practice that had been dormant for twenty years, while the power to introduce and pass legislation remained with Congress. It might be “preposterous” to assume that the president “could better understand the wants and wishes of the people than their own immediate representatives” (111), but this hardly warranted a conception of the executive that was unworkable.\n\nHarrison’s hedge against an activist president in law-making had its corollary in his opposition to the frequent use of the veto. Prior to Jackson, the negative had been used only nine times and almost exclusively on constitutional grounds. Jackson used the veto more often than all his predecessors combined, a practice he justified both on constitutional and policy grounds. The frequency and rationale of Jackson’s vetoes had yet to gain wide acceptance and were met with dismay and outrage by his opponents. His veto of the bill to re-charter the Bank of the United States (1832) was denounced as an abuse of power that set “the will of the people” at defiance and usurped legislative authority. In his defense, Jackson maintained that the president had a duty to exercise his independent judgment as to the wisdom and constitutionally of legislation. This rationale only further alienated those who believed the president was undermining the Constitution and establishing a kind of popular monarchy. As Daniel Webster wrote:\n\nAccording to the doctrines put forth by the President, although Congress may have passed a law, and although the Supreme Court may have pronounced it Constitutional, yet it is, nevertheless no law at all, if he, in his good pleasure, sees fit to deny its effect; in other words, to repeal or annul it.\n\nWebster’s choice of the words “repeal” and “annul” is telling, for they imply (unlike “veto” or “negative”) an extra-legal and illegitimate exercise of power. This is how Harrison and the Whigs viewed Jackson’s use of the veto, as a usurpation of legislative authority. In his inaugural, Harrison devoted more space to the veto than any other subject. He begins by drawing a distinction between judicial review and executive veto. The president may block legislation on both constitutional and policy grounds, but his veto can be overridden by a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. The judiciary can overturn existing laws only for constitutional reasons, but its decision is final. Because the veto appears to violate the separation of powers it “seems to be an incongruity in our system,” just as its non-conformity with majority rule makes it “so apparently repugnant to [this] leading democratic principle” (111). Why then did the framers of the Constitution adopt it? Because if properly used it “may be productive of great good and be found one of the best safeguards of the Union.” And what did the framers mean by proper use? The veto should not be exercised in the “ordinary course of legislation.”\n\nA Dubious Past and an Ambivalent Future\n\nDiscerning the intentions of the framers has always been a precarious business, but Harrison’s attempt is flimsy and false. If he had truly wanted to learn what the framers had said about the veto, he could have procured a copy of James Madison’s notes of the proceedings of the Federal Convention, which were published in 1840 and “immediately became gospel.” From The Federalist Harrison would have discovered that his understanding of the separation of powers was just as flawed as his conception of the veto. The framers recognized that a rigid and absolute separation of powers was simply impossible, and each branch would necessarily have some agency in the operation of the others. While the proper exercise of legislative, executive, and judicial power was to be kept strictly separate, the composition of each branch and mutual interaction would partake of a “mixed” or “blended” character. The veto is an example of such a blend.\n\nUpon this faulty foundation Harrison attempted to raise an edifice that was at stark variance with the facts. After praising the veto power as in principle “highly expedient,” he observes that “the principle [did] not appear to have enjoyed much favor in the [first] State governments,” for only two of the thirteen state constitutions provided for the veto (111). This was hardly an argument for the restrained use of the negative, for the state legislatures soon proved as dangerous to liberty and property as the royal governors had. By the time the Constitution was operative, many of the states had modified their charters, strengthening executive power and providing governors with the veto. Harrison not only omits this crucial fact in probing the framers’ intentions, but literally turns history on its head by claiming that the delegates who gathered in Philadelphia had complete confidence in the people and held the state legislatures in the highest esteem: “They knew too well the high degree of intelligence which existed among the people and the enlightened character of the State legislatures …”\n\nHarrison was either wholly ignorant of events that were widely known and occurred within his own lifetime, or engaged in a deliberate act of historical obfuscation. The movement that culminated in the Constitution grew out of a crisis of faith in the political capacities of the people and in reaction to the unbridled and reckless state governments. When James Madison wrote on the “Vices of the United States” prior to the Federal Convention, he chronicled the vices of the states, and particularly the legislatures. Far from finding the veto and other non-majoritarian features of the system “repugnant,” Madison and others fully embraced such “inventions of prudence” as indispensable supports of constitutional government. Whatever confidence the framers had in the ability of Congress to legislate without the aid or influence of the executive had little to do with their considered opinions of the people’s wisdom or the integrity of the state legislatures. On that score Harrison could not have been more wrong.\n\nOnly by vacating the field of history and returning to theory did Harrison find his way back to terra firma. If the veto was not intended to “assist or control Congress … in its ordinary legislation” (111), what was its intended use? In addition to blocking unconstitutional measures, Harrison provides two other instances when the use of the veto is proper and justified. When a measure is technically constitutional, but violates the “rights and interests of the minority,” it is the duty of the president to prevent it from becoming law (112). (Harrison’s treatment of this species of legislation reads like a gloss on Madison’s discussion of majority tyranny in Federalist No. 10.) In such a case the president should act as an “umpire” and protect the minority from “the injustice and oppression of the rest.” Ironically, this is precisely what Jackson believed he was doing, except in reverse – protecting the majority from the minority. The only other instance when a veto is appropriate is to protect “the people from the effects of hasty legislation where their will has been probably disregarded or not well understood …” Actually, this provides three additional grounds for the negative: 1) “hasty” legislation, 2) legislation not based on the people’s “will,” and 3) legislation wherein this will is “not well understood.” Besides its nebulous formation, it is difficult to see how such a subjective standard could guide a judicious use of the negative. Jackson himself could hardly have devised a more fitting formula to activate his veto pen.\n\nHarrison muddies the water even further by linking this formula to “the right and privilege of the people to decide disputed points of the Constitution arising from” the exercise of implied powers under the necessary and proper clause (112). But how were “the people” to make this decision? Whigs had castigated Jackson for blocking measures such as the bank bills that had been repeatedly passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court. Jackson claimed a power to interpret the Constitution independently of the co-ordinate branches and pointed to his re-election after the bank veto as popular vindication. But which view represented the “will of the people”? Harrison adopted the position Madison had taken when he signed the Bank Bill in 1816. While Madison had doubts about the constitutionality of chartering a national bank (a power not expressly granted to Congress by the Constitution), precedents set by the various branches of government, combined with indications of popular approval, had effectively settled the matter. By directly quoting Madison’s well-known phrase – one the Jacksonians hated – Harrison was throwing down the gauntlet with an able assist from the “Father of the Constitution.” If a new bank bill crossed his desk (as Clay assured him it would) he would not veto it.\n\nHarrison’s shoddy use of history and flabby reasoning did little credit to his argument for a passive president, but the argument itself was not as idiosyncratic as it appears today. Nor did it die with Harrison. While it is hard to picture Henry Clay or Daniel Webster ever wearing a presidential straight-jacket, Clay and others labored to reduce the powers of the office, and the only other Whig presidents, Zachary Taylor (1849-50) and Millard Fillmore (1850-53), never exercised the veto. Even the Democratic presidents of the antebellum era, with the notable exception of James K. Polk (1845-49), were more Whiggish and less Jacksonian as chief executives. After Polk, presidential power steadily declined until it was virtually abdicated near the end of James Buchanan’s term (1857-61). Jackson and Polk had shown that circumstances and personality had more to do with the scope of presidential power than anything intrinsic to the office. The alternation of “strong” and “weak” presidents from Lincoln to F.D.R. extended this pattern into the modern era. That only two presidents between 1865 and 1933 were “strong” in the manner of Jackson (Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson) suggests that the Whig concept of an administrator-in-chief not only outlived the Whigs, but survived well into the twentieth century.\n\nStill, the Whig theory of the presidency as formulated by Harrison must be understood in terms of what preceded it rather than its subsequent history. At the broadest level, Harrison and the Whigs reflected the deep ambivalence towards executive power that had existed since the advent of American independence. As Harvey Mansfield has observed, this ambivalence arose from the “paradox” of a strong executive in a republican regime. The formidable executive created by the framers was (as Harrison notes) a frequent target of the Antifederalists, and it fell to the Constitution’s defenders, (particularly the authors’ of The Federalist) “to show that an energetic executive could be republicanized.” The Whig reaction to Jackson suggests that “Publius” had not been entirely persuasive. Indeed, as early as Washington’s second term, cries of incipient “tyranny” and charges of “monarchical ambitions” echoed across the political landscape. By Jackson’s second term these reverberations had multiplied into a swelling chorus of political Cassandras. For some, including leading public figures, the fated moment warned of by the Antifederalists had arrived – America was under a de facto despotism.\n\nRemoval! Indians, Office Holders, and Deposits\n\nTo the extent that Jackson’s presidency constituted a sharp break with the past and clashed with established views of executive power, the Whig reaction was a predicable if exaggerated response. Jackson not only revived the more activist elements that had marked Jefferson’s presidency, but pushed executive power into hitherto uncharted regions. As noted above, his use of the veto, removal of cabinet officials, and claim to embody the popular will were all innovations that sharply expanded executive power. He also introduced the “spoils system” in the civil service whereby loyal supporters were rewarded with jobs in the federal bureaucracy, and in turn were expected to contribute time and money to the president’s party. Before Jackson, presidents had made few removals in the largely non-partisan and professional civil service. After Jackson, removals and appointments for purely partisan reasons became the norm and patronage would fuel the engine of national politics.\n\nDetractors of Jackson also objected to his Indian removal policy, including his “defiance” of a Supreme Court decision in favor of the Cherokees. His reliance on informal advisors, the “Kitchen Cabinet,” and his practice of appointing members of Congress to his administration were also condemned as dangerous innovations: the one undermining executive accountability, the other eroding the separation of powers. Jackson’s “War on the Bank” would prove the crest in a growing wave of criticism that had been building since his first year in office. His decision to “kill” the Bank – not only vetoing its re-charter, but removing government deposits over the objections of two treasurers – was the coup de grâce that gave birth to the Whig party.\n\nIf Harrison’s caesarian portrayal of Jackson’s removal of public funds was imprecise and overdrawn, it did underscore a genuine constitutional dilemma that was as old as the Constitution itself. Jackson and the Democracy demanded a divorce between the federal government and the Bank, yet acknowledged that the government needed a method to hold, receive, and disperse its funds. The transfer of federal monies to “pet” banks – chartered by the states and loyal to the Democracy – was denounced by Whigs as proof that Jackson intended to “unite the purse with the sword.” In his address, Harrison did not condemn the “divorce … of the Treasury and the banking institutions” per se, but rather “the unhallowed union of the Treasury with the executive department” (114). This unholy alliance was not merely the result of Jackson’s nefarious policies, but was facilitated by “a great error in the framers of the Constitution,” viz., the failure to make the treasury secretary “entirely independent” of the executive branch. Short of this, the framers should have placed the power to remove the secretary with the House of Representatives. For his part, Harrison pledged never to remove a treasurer without first communicating the causes to Congress.\n\nSince its creation in 1789 the treasury department had occupied an anomalous position in the constitutional framework. In the enabling legislation, Congress departed from the concept of a unitary executive by making the secretary accountable to both itself and the president. The matter of removal of deposits was complicated by apparent discrepancies between the enabling legislation and the Bank’s charter, the former giving discretion to the secretary, the latter requiring the approval of Congress. Prior to Jackson, Congress had often treated the secretary as its agent and delegated responsibility for the safe-keeping of government funds. Jackson abruptly reversed this modus operandi. He not only removed two secretaries who opposed removal, but ignored reports from both houses of Congress that the existing bank deposits were safe. This was too much for the Senate, which passed a censure resolution sponsored by Clay.\n\nIn his inaugural, Harrison made it clear that the president should not initiate legislation, particularly in the area of public finance: “he should never be looked to for schemes of finance” (115). Yet the role he did assign the president significantly blurred the line between the power to “recommend” and the ability to initiate. Harrison concedes that a president has a “duty” to suggest fiscal measures, and may return (veto) revenue bills to the lower house with his objections. He may even propose revisions to existing revenue laws … but “the delicate duty of devising schemes of revenue should be left where the Constitution has placed it,” the House of Representatives (116). Control of the treasury should also be in the hands of the “the immediate representatives of the people,” while the executive should have as little control as possible. Such an arrangement, Harrison adds, is “in accordance with republican principle.”\n\nThe Whig effort to divorce the treasury from the executive was not only highly strained, but quixotic. The Whigs, and especially Clay, favored a national bank and Harrison indicated he would not oppose the (re)establishment of one. They simply believed the “power of the purse” should reside exclusively with Congress and the president’s role in public finance be circumscribed within the narrowest bounds. Yet Harrison could no more reconcile the president’s “duty” to report to Congress with an injunction against executive influence in legislation than square his equivocal views of the veto with a call for its restricted use. His assertion that the president should act as if the treasury department was outside the executive branch was just as misguided. As Jackson maintained in his protest to the censure resolution, the president could not take care that the laws be faithfully executed if he could not control the actions of those who execute them. Just as Article I of the Constitution vests all legislative power in the Congress, Article II vests all executive power in the president. The Whigs had a point in protesting Jackson’s high-handed actions, and particularly his method of removing public funds, but the proposed cure was worse than the disease – a weak, fragmented, and unaccountable executive.\n\nSon of an Antifederalist\n\nAnother of Jackson’s innovations that drew a sharp response from Harrison and the Whigs was his unprecedented use of political patronage. Jackson’s predecessors had shown considerable restraint in replacing officeholders for partisan reasons and even retained cabinet members from the prior administration. This would all change with the election of Jackson, who rejected the idea of a professional, career civil service as inconsistent with the spirit of democracy, and embraced “rotation in office” as the principle best-suited to popular government. In practice, this meant removing untold numbers of officeholders and filling vacancies with loyal supporters regardless of qualifications or competence. Those rewarded with a government position were expected to support the Democracy, even to the point of electioneering on behalf of the party. Not surprisingly, the “spoils system” thoroughly politicized the federal bureaucracy and turned patronage into the driving force of politics.\n\nFor Whigs the “corruption” of the civil service was further evidence of the malignant tendency of Jacksonian democracy. As diagnosed by Harrison, the advent of patronage politics created a dangerous “undercurrent” that threatened to compromise the independence of the state governments and “essentially and radically” alter the nature of the central government. Just as the Antifederalists had warned of an “elective monarchy,” they prophesied the creation of a “consolidated power” that would absorb the residual authorities of the states and extinguish the liberties of the people. “Without denying” that this fear “is in the way of being realized,” Harrison notes that the particular “mode of its accomplishment” was not foreseen. Contrary to the expectations of the Antifederalists, the general government had not directly encroached upon the reserved powers of the states, but the executive branch (under Jackson-Van Buren) had extended its influence through the manipulation of the franchise. By “encouraging” political appointees to “vote right” in both state and federal elections, the Jacksonians were undermining the very basis of free government. Harrison lays part of the blame on “the never-failing tendency of political power to increase itself” (113). The problem was also “inherent in the Constitution,” which made “the President the sole distributor of all the patronage of the Government …” Harrison’s solution was to imitate Jefferson, who had issued an order prohibiting federal workers from electioneering.\n\nHarrison’s assault on the “spoils system” was the only bright spot in an otherwise awkward performance. What is curious, however, is his recurrence to the Antifederalists as a quasi-oracular foil to the slightly-myopic framers. In contrast to the “confident hopes of [the Constitution’s] advocates” (113), who ignored or dismissed such gloomy forecasts, the Antifederalists warned that the extensive powers of the central government would in time pose a threat to the states and the people. These “antifederal patriots” may not have identified the precise mode of “executive usurpation” or “consolidation,” Harrison observes, but they did foresee the real prospect of both in the “defects” of the Constitution. Far from being (in Cecelia Kenyon’s famous phrase) “men of little faith,” the “patriots who opposed its adoption” were almost prophet-like in projecting the establishment of an “elective monarchy” and the creation of a “consolidated” government. Indeed, if not immediately checked, the Antifederalists’ “worst apprehensions … will be realized.” (113)\n\nGiven his diagnosis of the “evils” that had crept into the republic and the measures he advanced to restore it to “pristine health and beauty,” it was natural for Harrison to enlist the Antifederalists. On one hand, it allowed him to criticize the framers without appearing disrespectful or disloyal. The Antifederalists were, after all, the original “loyal opposition” that had peacefully acquiesced in the adoption of the Constitution. They were also largely responsible for the Bill of Rights that was added after its ratification. Moreover, many of the heroes of the Revolution had opposed the Constitution, including Patrick Henry, James Monroe, and Henry Lee. These Virginians were joined by Harrison’s father, Benjamin, who similarly served as an Antifederalist delegate in the Old Dominion’s ratifying convention. Like the Antifederalists, Harrison fils feared power in general and executive power in particular. All were highly sensitive to the tendency of power to corrupt and all dreaded unscrupulous politicians “who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray” the public. (106) Conversely, Harrison’s emphasis on “vigilance,” “public virtue” (122), and the “manly” scrutiny of government (115) echoed the classical republican ethos of the Antifederalists. Finally, his sermon on the foundations of republicanism and his call for civic renewal drew upon this same ethos, which demanded a periodic “recurrence to first principles” in order to restore to health an ailing republic.\n\nConjuring these “sternest republicans” (109) from the political graveyard may have suited Harrison’s purpose, but it created an odd disjunction that is unparalleled in presidential history. Never before or since has a president found such fault with the Constitution or its framers, whether in an inaugural address or any other official state paper. True, the Constitution had yet to acquire the worshipful status it would acquire after the Civil War, but even in 1841 it was remarkable for a president to publicly highlight its “defects” and underscore the “errors” of its authors. On the other hand, no other president has explicitly drawn on the Antifederalist tradition as a corrective to the framers and an anodyne for contemporary political ills. Invoking the Antifederalists in defense of republicanism was necessarily a double-edged sword, but for a president to do so fifty years after the adoption of the Constitution was a curious anomaly.\n\nThe Theory in Practice\n\nAmong scholars who have considered the Whig theory of the presidency there is general agreement that it could hardly have worked in practice. Even if Harrison had agreed to turn his administration over to Clay, who remained in the Senate, the very separation of powers he insisted upon in his address made such an arrangement unworkable. As it was, Clay’s efforts to influence appointments, set the agenda, and make policy led an annoyed Harrison to rebuff the presumptuous senator. “You are too impetuous,” he told Clay, who objected to Harrison’s decision not to immediately call a special session of Congress. Later, when Clay badgered him over an appointment, he shot back: “Mr. Clay, you forget that I am President!” Harrison did call the special session requested by Clay, but rejected the speech Clay had prepared for him, informing the senator that any further communication between the two should be limited to written correspondence. Like Prince Hal in Shakespeare’s Henry IV, Clay (who was often called “Prince Hal” in the press) reached for the crown prematurely and received the stern rebuke of its still-breathing possessor.\n\nThe new president appeared no more inclined to adhere to the Whig theory of cabinet government than to receive dictation from the leaders of Congress. In contrast to Jackson, whose frequent cabinet shuffles and use of informal advisors smacked of monarchy, the Whigs believed the president was merely primus inter pares and should be guided by his cabinet. More specifically, the official cabinet should deliberate over policy and submit decisions to a majority vote, with the president having but one. The experiment under Harrison was short-lived. When Daniel Webster, whom Harrison had appointed secretary of state, informed the president that the cabinet had selected James Wilson as governor of Iowa Territory, Harrison scribbled some words on a slip of paper and asked Webster to read it. “William Henry Harrison, President of the United States, tells you gentleman that by God, John Chambers shall be Governor of Iowa.” Despite his advanced age and professed views, Harrison was a man accustomed to lead, and when he felt manipulated he naturally bristled and asserted his primacy.\n\nAt bottom the Whig theory of the presidency was doomed to failure because it was at odds with the very nature of executive power under the Constitution. More specifically, “it was utterly inconsistent with the concentration of executive power contained in Article II.” For the same reason, “[a]ny effort to implant the cabinet system into our constitutional system was bound to be stillborn, for it lost sight of the reality of power as it is distributed under the basic document.” When Harrison died, John Tyler not only assumed the full powers of the office (rejecting the suggestion that he was merely an “acting” president), but dispensed with the cabinet system altogether. Tyler may have become a Whig in response to Jackson’s “despotism,” but his independence as president proved that he would not conform to a figurehead any more than Harrison had. Clay and Congress would fulminate against Tyler’s “abuse” of the veto, propose constitutional amendments, and even talk of impeachment, but they proved impotent in the face of the determined president. As a constitutional scholar has shrewdly observed, “even during [Harrison and Tyler’s] short-lived tenures, there were signs that no president after Jackson could be reduced to the position of a Merovingian monarch.”\n\nIn their excessive reaction to Jackson, the Whigs painted themselves into a corner from which they never fully emerged. Even if Harrison had survived the pneumonia that claimed his life, he would likely have fallen victim to his own unsustainable theory. Harrison had been nominated over Clay for his electability (and pliability), but was not respected by party leaders, who intended to use him to further their own ambitions. As John Quincy Adams observed, “His popularity is all artificial. There is little confidence in his talents or firmness.” Another congressman looked on his early death as a blessing, for had the aging Harrison lived he would have been “devoured by the divided pack of his own dogs.”\n\nPostmortem\n\nNear the opening of his address, Harrison informed his audience that “the lapse of a few months” would be sufficient to determine if he had kept faith with the electorate or violated its confidence. His death a month later preempted any public pronouncement on his administration. The ascension of Tyler and dissension among the Whigs scuttled the entire program of positive legislation Clay had prepared and Harrison pledged to passively support. A national bank, a protective tariff, and internal improvements – the heart of Clay’s “American System” – would not be realized until Clay and the Whigs had followed Harrison to the grave. The president who signed these measures into law, Abraham Lincoln, was a former Whig who idolized Clay and had supported Harrison in 1840. Lincoln’s view of the presidency could hardly have been more remote from his Whig predecessor’s, but his administration showed that the Whig doctrine of the positive state was fully compatible with a strong executive. This is but one of the many ironies surrounding Harrison and the Whig theory of the presidency.\n\nSince the Whig agenda died with Harrison, the ninth president was left without a legacy. Standard accounts of his presidency tend to focus on the trivial. He was the first to die in office, the last to have been born a British subject, served the shortest term, and gave the longest inaugural address. It is the inaugural, however, that has supplied the scène à faire for generations of writers, who invariably link the inclement conditions in which it was delivered to Harrison’s demise. Little, however, has been written about the address itself, which is surprising in light of its outré quality and unique status in American political history. The two leading students of the Whig party, Michael Holt and Daniel Howe, give it short shrift, while most surveys of constitutional history fail to mention it altogether.\n\nPerhaps as a result of this neglect, scholars who do cite the address often repeat old errors or invent new ones. In his “intellectual history” of the presidency, Forrest McDonald credits Webster with writing the address and claims that Harrison “capitulated entirely to Whig congressional leaders and their opposition to an energetic presidency.” This is wrong on both counts. Webster edited the address and Harrison shared the Whigs’ ideas on the presidency. Robert Remini, a leading authority on the Age of Jackson, suggests that Clay and Webster “were horrified” by Harrison’s pledge not to serve a second term, “realizing that the President had just thrown away his main tool for implementing the party’s program.” This reaction was hardly likely given that both men had read the address in advance and conferred with Harrison before his inauguration. The assertion that the Whig statesmen’s “horror” gave way to “joy” when Harrison “announced that he would use his veto sparingly” is subject to the same objection. Elsewhere Remini blames the collapse of the Whig program on Harrison, “a vain and egotistical incompetent …” The assertion that Harrison was responsible for the Whig debacle is simply untrue. The “opportunity to legislate their dynamic program into law and demonstrate to the American people the value and importance of their policies and philosophy” was not lost due to Harrison’s presence, but by his absence. He showed every intention of deferring to the Whig Congress and called a special session that would have likely resulted in the establishment of a national bank.\n\nA recent survey of presidential power does assign Harrison a separate, albeit short chapter, but the authors’ account is incomplete and misleading. On little more than the “anecdote” of Harrison overriding his cabinet in appointing the governor of Iowa, they conclude that his presidency “saw the same aggressive defense of executive power that is often associated with the Jacksonian Democrats.” The comparison with Jackson on such tenuous grounds is overwrought and unfounded. Harrison never formally committed to cabinet government: it was the one component of the Whig theory of the presidency absent from his inaugural. Moreover, the comparison ignores what Harrison did commit to: a single term, non-intervention in legislation, no removals without cause, and restricted use of the veto. Jackson made no such commitments.\n\nThis blind spot leads the authors to further distortions. The suggestion that “Harrison clung steadfastly to a belief in the assertive use of the executive power” despite the best efforts of Clay and Webster is simply incorrect. Harrison offered to appoint Clay secretary of state, and when Clay expressed his intention to remain in the Senate, Harrison offered the position to Webster. Both Webster and Clay had a hand in the appointment process even if they did not always get their way. Harrison simply resisted the efforts of Clay to force his hand, and Webster did precious little to influence a president who had frankly renounced the assertive use of executive power. The fact that Harrison personally visited administrative bureaus, called for reports, and issued a directive forbidding officeholders from electioneering hardly proves that the new president was “an active chief executive.” In spite of his pledge to make no partisan-based removals, Harrison succumbed to the pressures of office-seekers and replaced numerous officials with Whig loyalists. Harrison possessed an independent spirit, but there was nothing activist about his vision of the presidency or brief administration.\n\nThere is something perversely ironic in the errors and confusion surrounding Harrison’s address and short month in office, for Harrison himself was in error and confused about history and the nature of the constitutional order. In this he was hardly alone – Clay, Webster, and the Whig party also adopted a theory of the executive that was inconsistent with the basic structure of the Constitution and unworkable in practice. Yet Harrison was the only president to officially endorse this theory in an inaugural. His address is also unique for its classical allusions, religious sentiments, criticism of the Constitution, and appeal to its Antifederalist opponents. Like his one month administration, Harrison’s “excruciatingly long, gangly, repetitious, and platitudinous” address stands alone in the annals of presidential history.\n\nAs momentum for Harrison’s election was building, Daniel Webster reflected on the significance of a Whig victory and paused to pinch himself. “We are either on the high road to the accomplishment of the greatest revolution ever yet achieved in this country, or else we are in enchanted ground, surrounded by fairies, fancies, phantoms, & wild dreams.” Harrison’s bizarre address and his untimely death placed Webster and the Whigs squarely in a land of enchantment.\n\nNotes\n\nHarrison’s inaugural address appears most recently in Fellow Citizens: The Penguin Book of U. S. Presidential Inaugural Addresses, ed., Robert V. Remini and Terry Golway (New York: Penguin, 2008), 106-123. All references to his inaugural and others are from this edition.\n\nThe image of Harrison as a homespun hero, so assiduously cultivated by the Whig party press, was given the lie by his “high-brow” address. “Nothing could have exposed more clearly to the discerning eye the character of the recent contest than this address. The man who been pictured as the common log-cabin, hard-cider candidate stepped forward with an elaborate production, filled with erudite allusion, addressed to the fundamentals.” Rexford G. Tugwell, How They Became President: Thirty-Five Ways to the White House (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1964), 114.\n\nThe term “figurehead” is frequently used to characterize the Whig conception of the presidency, but is rarely discussed in any detail, particularly as embodied in Harrison’s address. For most observers, “[t]he specifics of the program to dismantle the presidency are less important than the deep commitment to the attack.” William M. Goldsmith, The Growth of Presidential Power: A Documented History, vol. 1 (New York: Chelsea House, 1974), 588.\n\n“We are the midst of a revolution,” stormed Clay, “but rapidly tending toward a total change of the pure republican character of the government, and to the concentration of all power in the hands of one man. The powers of Congress are paralyzed, except when exerted in conformity with his will, by frequent and extraordinary exercise of the executive veto, not anticipated by the founders of our Constitution, and not practiced by any predecessors of the present chief magistrate.” Webster was hardly less emphatic. “The President carries on the government; all the rest are but sub-contractors. Sir, whatever name we give him we have but one executive officer. A Biareus sits in the center of our system, and with his hundred hands, touches everything, moves everything, controls everything. I ask, Sir, is this republicanism? Is this legal responsibility?” Quoted in Goldsmith, Presidential Power, vol. 2, 613.\n\nFor the most recent and comprehensive discussion of the origins of the Whig party see Michael F. Holt. The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999), 1-122. While an embarrass de richesse in terms of party history, Holt’s massive study all but ignores Harrison’s inaugural address and brief administration. See also Glyndon G. Van Deusen, “The Whig Party,” in History of U.S. Political Parties, 1789-1860, ed., Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. (New York: Chelsea House, 1973), 333-363; and Thomas Brown, Politics and Statesmanship: Essays on the American Whig Party (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985). Dated but still of value is E. Malcolm Carroll, The Origins of the Whig Party (Durham: Duke University Press, 1925).\n\nArthur Schlesinger, Jr. refers to the Whig’s electoral triumph of 1840 as a “counter-reformation,” but this implies that (1) Jackson was a reformer and (2) the Whigs were reactionaries. The Age of Jackson (Boston: Little, Brown & Co., 1945), 267. This is not how the Whigs viewed the situation. Clay and Webster applied the term “revolution” to the Whig victory, but in the generic and retrograde sense. In modern parlance, the Whig project was one of restoration, not reaction or revolution, and is more accurately characterized as a “counter-revolution.” See Robert V. Remini, Daniel Webster, the Man and His Time (New York: W. W. Norton, 1997), 506-7, 510.\n\n“By the time of Jackson’s first inaugural in 1829, the tide of presidential power and authority had reached a low ebb. It had been receding since the embargo fiasco of Jefferson’s last days in office…. Madison, Monroe, and John Quincy Adams, whatever their other virtues, were among the most ineffectual presidents in all of American history.” Marc Landy and Sidney M. Milkis, Presidential Greatness (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 2000), 81, 82.\n\nKarlyn K. Campbell and Kathleen H.

John C. Calhoun wryly called Caesar’s plundering of the treasury an “act of virtue” compared to Jackson’s conduct, while a fellow senator discerned in the demagoguery of Jackson the same force that “crushed the Senate and the liberties of Rome, and placed the blood-stained Caesar upon the throne.” Robert V. Remini, “The Constitution and the Presidencies: The Jackson Era,” in The Constitution and the American Presidency, ed., Martin L. Fausold and Alan Shank (Albany: SUNY Press, 1991), 34; David P. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: Democrats and Whigs, 1829-1861 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2005), 70.\n\nIn a further twist of irony, the 1848 Swiss Constitution borrowed heavily from the United States, but steered clear of a strong American-style presidency for fear of dictatorship.\n\nFor Harrison, placing Bolívar alongside Caesar and Cromwell was more than a rhetorical flourish. As minister plenipotentiary to Colombia (1828-29), he had met Bolívar and later lectured the would-be dictator in a public letter on the virtues of freedom and democracy. When Jackson took office in March, 1829, Harrison was recalled.\n\nTocqueville was unimpressed with President Jackson (whom he met in early 1832) and considered the political parties of the time far inferior to those headed by Jefferson and Hamilton. “America has had great parties; now they no longer exist.” Democracy in America, ed., J. P. Meyer (New York: Harper Collins, 1969), I:175.\n\nFor this reason, “Harrison sought to establish his republican credentials to refute the charge of Federalism by continually invoking the names of Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, and a panoply of other Democratic-Republican and Antifederalist heroes.” Harry Watson, Liberty and Power: The Politics of Jacksonian America (New York: Hill and Wang, 1990), 220\n\nAs one frustrated Whig observed, “To be popular with the majority in America, to be a favorite with the people, you must divest yourself of all freedom of opinion, you must throw off all dignity, you must shake hands and drink with every man you meet; you must be, in fact, slovenly and dirty, in your appearance, or you will be put down as an aristocrat.” Quoted in Carroll, Origins of the Whig Party, 217. See also Daniel W. Howe, The Political Culture of the American Whigs (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984).\n\nSee Robert G. Grunderson, The Log-Cabin Campaign (Lexington: University of Kentucky Press, 1957).\n\nIn the King James Bible the full sentence runs as follows. “For there shall arise false Christs, and false prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders; so that, if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect.” Many among Harrison’s audience would have known this passage and understood the political analog.\n\nA Harrison biographer asserts that Daniel Webster wrote this paragraph, but provides no evidence to support the claim. Cleeves, Old Tippecanoe, 336. In light of Harrison’s new-found religiosity, he hardly needed prompting from the “god-like Daniel.”\n\nWhatever his true religious sentiments, Harrison and his Whig handlers aggressively courted evangelical voters in the North. In sharp contrast to the spirituous frivolities associated with the “log cabin and hard cider” campaign, the Whig outreach directed at evangelicals portrayed Harrison as a sober and pious friend of Protestant Christianity and the Whigs as the “Christian party.” See Richard Carwardine, “Evangelicals, Whigs and the Election of William Henry Harrison,” American Studies, 17 (1983), 47-75.\n\nQuoted in Cleeves, Old Tippecanoe, 332.\n\nGreen, Harrison, 396.\n\nQuoted in Franklin Steiner, The Religious Beliefs of Our Presidents: Washington to F.D.R. (New York: Prometheus Books, 1936), 68.\n\nSteiner, Religious Beliefs, 68.\n\nQuoted in Green, Harrison, 379, 380. It is perhaps not coincidental that the Whigs adopted the “publicity methods of evangelical preachers” and that Harrison “specifically courted evangelical voters with assurances of his sabbatarian, Anti-masonic, and temperance principles.” Daniel W. Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 579.\n\nFor details of Harrison’s month in office and fatal illness see, Norma Lois Peterson, The Presidencies of William Henry Harrison and John Tyler (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1989), 31-43.\n\nUntil a few decades ago this was the prevailing view of Whig rhetoric. Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. described it as a façade used by conservatives to conceal their greed for money and office. Age of Jackson, 279. Brown, Howe, and Holt have done much to correct this biased and simplistic view. In truth, the charge of “executive usurpation” was at once a sincere response to perceived threats to the constitutional order and a shibboleth of electoral politics. “To some extent [Whig] fears were genuine and reflected legitimate issues of constitutional structure and practice, but to an ever-increasing extent they seem to have represented a cynical effort to discredit Democratic candidates by appealing to popular fantasies about power encroaching on liberty.” Rush Welter, The Mind of America, 1820-1860 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1975 ), 192.\n\nThe Jackson-Polk theory of the presidency embodied four key elements: 1) direct representation of the people, 2) an expanded use of the veto power, 3) an unrestrained power of removal, and 4) the leadership of his political party. The Whigs, led by Clay, rejected each of these on prudential, legal, and constitutional grounds and labored for nearly a decade to shape opinion, change laws, and even amend the Constitution to check these “heresies.” See Leonard D. White, The Jacksonians: A Study in Administrative History (New York: Macmilllan, 1954), 20-49.\n\nSee Thomas Cronin, “Presidential Term, Tenure, and Re-eligibility,” in Inventing the American Presidency, ed. Thomas Cronin (Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, 1989), 61-88.\n\nSee Gerard N. Magliocca, “‘Veto!’ The Jacksonian Revolution in Constitutional Law,” Nebraska Law Review, 78 (1999), 205-209.\n\nQuoted in Remini, “The Constitution and the Presidencies: The Jackson Era,” 33.\n\nWhether “usurpation” or not, Jackson’s novel use of the veto “meant he was assuming legislative powers. And everybody knew it. Jackson’s position essentially altered the relationship between the legislative and executive branches of the government. The president was becoming the head of the government, the first among equals, not simply an equal with the other two branches.” Remini, “Constitution and the Presidencies,” 33.\n\nCurrie, Constitution in Congress, xiii.\n\nIf Harrison can be excused on grounds of ignorance, this can hardly be said of the Dartmouth-educated Daniel Webster, who as a strong nationalist must have cringed at Harrison’s “revisionist” history and frequent obeisance to the Antifederalists.\n\n“Constitutionally speaking, what was at stake were two theories of the presidency which have competed with each other throughout American history.” Bernard Schwartz, From Confederation to Nation: The American Constitution, 1835-1877 (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1973), 38-39.\n\nHarvey C. Mansfield, Jr., Taming the Prince: The Ambivalence of Modern Executive Power (New York: The Free Press, 1989), 250.\n\nEven the two leading jurists of the age, Joseph Story and James Kent, believed Jackson had established himself as an elective monarch. See Schwarz, Confederation to Nation, 41.\n\n“Exaggerated as this view of recent presidential history was, it suggests something of the impact that Jackson’s actions had on the development of the executive branch.” Alfred H. Kelly, et al., The American Constitution: Its History and Development, 7th ed., vol. 1 (New York: W. W. Norton, 1990), 214-215. In his landmark study of presidential leadership, Stephen Skowronek suggests the Whigs were basically correct in their assessment of Jackson’s profound impact, not just on the executive branch, but on the political system as a whole. “Jackson’s vindication signaled a wholesale reconstruction of American politics – one that permanently redefined the position of the presidency in its relations with Congress, the Court, the cabinet, the states, the party, and the electorate. The executive office gained foundations categorically more independent than it had enjoyed before.” The Politics Presidents Make: Leadership from John Adams to Bill Clinton (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1997), 153.\n\n“Before 1829 few federal officeholders had been required to discharge any obligation to the party or faction in power ... After 1829 they were progressively brought under the dominion of the local party machine and subjected to various party requirements as a condition of constituting their employment. Among these were obligations to pay party assessments, to do party work at election time, and to ‘vote right’.” White, Jacksonians, 332.\n\nThe Indian Removal Act (1830), which authorized the president to relocate the Southeastern tribes on federal lands, was pushed through Congress by Jackson’s supporters. Jackson’s “defiance” of the decision in Worcester v. Georgia (1832) was simply a refusal to intervene on behalf of the Cherokee. In order to contrast his Indian policies (as governor of Indiana Territory) with those of Jackson, Harrison’s Discourse on the Aborigines, originally delivered as a lecture in 1838,was published in 1840 as a campaign pamphlet. Carwardine, “Evangelicals, Whigs, and the Election of William Henry Harrison,” 60.\n\nJackson’s written justification for removal was no less radical and far-reaching than the act itself. “Jackson’s removal statement constituted a revolutionary change in the conceptualization of the basis of presidential power. The presidency and indeed the party system were never quite the same again.” Richard J. Ellis and Stephen Kirk, “Jefferson, Jackson, and the Origins of the Presidential Mandate,” in Speaking to the People: The Rhetorical Presidency in Historical Perspective (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1998), 56.\n\nThe censure resolution adopted by the Senate on March 28, 1834 read as follows: “Resolved, That the President, in the late Executive Proceedings in relation to the public revenue, has assumed upon himself authority and power not conferred by the constitution and laws, but in derogation of both.” When Jackson responded with a written “Protest” it was rejected out of hand as a violation of the Senate’s independence. After the election of Van Buren, Jackson’s supporters in the Senate had the resolution expunged from the official journal. See Robert V. Remini, Henry Clay, Statesman for the Union (New York: W. W. Norton, 1991).\n\nAs Currie notes, “President Harrison went out of his way to dump on his predecessors for going so far as to draft possible legislation for Congress to consider, especially in the field of finance.” Constitution in Congress, 163.\n\nStated positively, “[t]here was something to this argument, but Jackson was on solid ground in insisting on executive unity and responsibility.” Kelly et al., American Constitution, 215.\n\nSee White, Jacksonians, 325-346.\n\nSee Herbert Storing, What the Antifederalists were For (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1981).\n\nSee Saul Cornell, The Other Founders: Antifederalism and the Dissenting Tradition in America, 1788-1828 (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1999).\n\nIn a campaign speech in Versailles, Indiana, Harrison indicated that he would gladly turn his administration over to Clay and retire to his farm if the Constitution allowed it.

However much the world may have improved in many respects in the lapse of upward of two thousand years since the remark was made by the virtuous and indignant Roman, I fear that a strict examination of the annals of some of the modern elective governments would develop similar instances of violated confidence.\n\nAlthough the fiat of the people has gone forth proclaiming me the Chief Magistrate of this glorious Union, nothing upon their part remaining to be done, it may be thought that a motive may exist to keep up the delusion under which they may be supposed to have acted in relation to my principles and opinions; and perhaps there may be some in this assembly who have come here either prepared to condemn those I shall now deliver, or, approving them, to doubt the sincerity with which they are now uttered. But the lapse of a few months will confirm or dispel their fears. The outline of principles to govern and measures to be adopted by an Administration not yet begun will soon be exchanged for immutable history, and I shall stand either exonerated by my countrymen or classed with the mass of those who promised that they might deceive and flattered with the intention to betray. However strong may be my present purpose to realize the expectations of a magnanimous and confiding people, I too well understand the dangerous temptations to which I shall be exposed from the magnitude of the power which it has been the pleasure of the people to commit to my hands not to place my chief confidence upon the aid of that Almighty Power which has hitherto protected me and enabled me to bring to favorable i"
