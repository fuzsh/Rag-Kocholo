        "text": "Harrison A. Williams Jr., the Democratic senator from New Jersey who used his considerable power to further the interests of labor and education before being convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal, died on Saturday. He was 81 and lived in Bedminster.\n\nDr. Bruce Mintz, his physician, said he died of heart disease at St. Clare's Hospital in Denville, N.J.\n\nOnce known as ''senator for life,'' and the only New Jersey Democrat to be elected to four Senate terms, Senator Williams was convicted on May 1, 1981, on nine counts of bribery and conspiracy for promising to use his office to further a business venture in which he had a hidden interest. He was fined $50,000 and sentenced to three years in prison, which he served at a minimum-security federal prison in Allenwood, Pa.\n\nOn March 11, 1982, he resigned in the face of overwhelming indications that more than two-thirds of the Senate, where he had served for 23 years, were about to expel him. He said he had been illegally entrapped by federal agents posing as Arab sheiks and businessmen. Six congressmen were also convicted in the Abscam scandal.\n\nHe always said he was convicted of what he termed a ''dishonest crime.'' In a 1986 interview with WNET-TV, he defined this as ''when somebody else creates the situation for which you are convicted.''\n\nIn his resignation speech, he denied breaking any laws and said, ''I did not want the Senate to bring dishonor to itself by expelling me.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
