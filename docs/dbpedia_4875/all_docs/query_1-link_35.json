        "text": "Am I registered to Vote?\n\nTo see if you are registered to vote, visit the Secretary of State Voter Information Center.\n\nWho can register to vote?\n\nTo register you must:\n\n1. be a U.S. Citizen and a Kentucky resident for at least 28 days\n\n2. be at least 18 years old by the date of the next general election (if you will be 18 by the November general election, you are eligible to vote in the prior May primary election)\n\n3. not be a convicted felon or, if convicted of a felony offense, you must have had your civil rights restored. Contact your local parole office to obtain an application for restoration of civil rights\n\n4. not have been judged \"mentally imcompetent\" in a court of law and have voting rights removed\n\n5. not claim the right to vote anywhere outside Kentucky\n\nWhere do I register to vote?\n\n• County clerk's office\n\n• Driver's license office (Circuit Clerk) if you are applying for or renewing your driver's license\n\n• K-Tap\n\n• Food Stamp\n\n• Medicaid\n\n• WIC, and state-funded offices serving those with disabilities, if you are a client\n\n• Armed forces recruitment offices, if you are a prospective member of the armed forces\n\n• High schools, if you are a student or staff member\n\n• Kentucky mail-in Voter Registration Card\n\nMust I choose a party when I register?\n\nKentucky has closed party primary elections. That means you must register as a Democrat or Republican to vote in that party's May primary election. If you choose a different party registration other than Republican or Democrat, you cannot vote in their respective primaries, but may vote in the nonpartisan city and judicial primaries. All eligible voters may vote in the November general election or any special election.\n\nMay I change my political party affiliation?\n\nYou may change your political party affiliation at any time on or before December 31st to remain eligible to vote in the following primary election. You simply need to fill out a new voter registration card and return it to your county clerk by the December 31st deadline.\n\nAm I eligible to vote in an election if I move? I am already a registered voter.\n\nTo be eligible to vote, refer to the appropriate situation below:\n\n• You move within the county.\n\nNotify the county clerk of your new address or update your driver's license. The county clerk will tell you the location of your new voting precinct. If you do not do this before election day, you must go to the voting precinct for your new address to vote and update your voter registration address;\n\n• You move outside the county more than 28 days before election day.\n\nUpdate your voter registration address with the new county clerk or renew your driver's license in the new county at least 29 days before the election. If you do not notify the county clerk in either your old or new county of residence 29 days prior to an election, you are not eligible to vote in either county;\n\n• You move outside the county less that 29 days before the election.\n\nYou may vote in your previous county of residence for this election, but must immediately register to vote in your new county of residence;\n\n• You temporarily reside outside Kentucky, but are eligible to vote in Kentucky.\n\nYou may vote by absentee ballot."
