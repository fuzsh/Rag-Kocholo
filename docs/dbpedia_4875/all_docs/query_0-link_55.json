        "text": "Former United National Party (UNP) MP P.Harrison has pointed out that major election violations may take place by allowing voters to wear face masks to vote in accordance with the strict health guidelines set.\n\n“While wearings masks to vote, it is likely that Sumanawathi may convert to Karunavathi, and Ranbanda could easily be passed off as Muthubanda,” he said.\n\nAccording to Harrison, officials will face serious issues in identifying the voters due to the face coverings.\n\nHe also said the country will possibly see its most corrupt elections yet due to the health regulations imposed such as wearing masks, maintaining a one-meter distance, disinfecting the ballot boxes, and the regulations put in place at counting centers.\n\nHarrison noted that talking about election violations post elections is futile and therefore a proper procedure addressing these issues must be put in place. He said the Samagi Jana Balawegaya under which he has handed over nominations for the upcoming elections has brought these issues to the notice of the Elections Commission."
