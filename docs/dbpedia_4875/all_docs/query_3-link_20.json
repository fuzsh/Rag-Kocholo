        "text": "Our Party\n\nSince 1848, the Democratic National Committee has been the home of the Democratic Party, the oldest continuing party in the United States.\n\nToday, we are millions of supporters strong, leading with our values, fighting for progress, and helping elect Democrats in every state, city, and ZIP code — from local office to the Oval Office.\n\nOur party is strong because it’s built on advancing our Democratic platform and forging positive solutions that include everyone. As Democrats, we believe that every person in this nation should be treated with dignity and respect. We believe that health care is a right for all and that we should be rewarding the hard work of middle class families. We believe that our schools and streets should be free from gun violence and that a woman’s decisions about her own body are hers to make.\n\nAs the DNC, we are working together to build a bright future for everyone. We are fighting for the soul of our country, for the heart of our democracy, and for America’s place as the land of opportunity for all.\n\nP: 202-863-8000\n\nE: democraticparty@democrats.org\n\n430 S Capitol St SE\n\nWashington, DC 20003\n\nAbout the Committees\n\nDemocratic National Committee\n\nThe Democratic National Committee, or DNC, was created during the Democratic National Convention of 1848, and is governed by its Charter and Bylaws.
