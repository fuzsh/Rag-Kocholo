​SHAQUILLE O’NEAL

by name Shaq (born March 6, 1972, Newark, New Jersey, U.S.)

As a high-school senior in San Antonio, Texas, O’Neal attracted the attention of college recruiters when his team won the state championship.

In 2004—after years of on-and-off feuding with Bryant, which had become a major distraction within the Lakers organization—O’Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. There he teamed with the talented young guard Dwyane Wade to lead Miami to an NBA championship in 2006. Injuries limited O’Neal’s production over the following seasons, and he was traded to the Phoenix Suns in February 2008. O’Neal’s playing style did not mix well with the Suns’ up-tempo game, and—despite having had a very solid 2008–09 season—he was dealt to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009 as Phoenix began a rebuilding process. O’Neal retired after the 2010–11 season. His career totals include 28,596 points (the seventh highest total in NBA history at the time of his retirement) and 15 All-Star Game selections. O’Neal was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016
