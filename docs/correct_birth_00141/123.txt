New Jersey native and former NBA star Shaquille Oâ€™Neal announced today that he is backing Democrat Phil Murphy in this year's governor's race.

O'Neal backed Republican Gov. Chris Christie in his 2013 re-election bid, calling the governor a "great man" and even appearing in an ad for him. Christie cannot seek re-election because of term limits.

Why is Shaq, who lives in Florida, weighing in on Jersey politics? It's abundantly clear that for him, all roads lead back to New Jersey.

Here are 5 Jersey connections for the 7-foot-one ex-NBA star.
