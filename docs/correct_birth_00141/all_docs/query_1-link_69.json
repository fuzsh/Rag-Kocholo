        "text": "A College Phenom\n\nShaquille “Shaq” O’Neal, one of the most prominent players in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA), was born on March 6, 1972 in Newark, New Jersey. O’Neal went to college at Louisiana State University and began playing the center position for the school’s basketball team. At 7’1” and over 300 pounds, O’Neal was a dominant and intimidating force on the hardwood. While on Louisiana State’s basketball team, he was named college player of the year in 1991. In 1992, Shaq dropped out of college following his junior year in order to pursue a career with the NBA.\n\nAn Incredible Rookie Season\n\nOnce signed, Shaq played his first rookie season with the Orlando Magic. That season, he finished in the top 10 for scoring, rebounding, blocks, and shooting percentage, despite struggling mightily from the free-throw line. Shaq became the first player in NBA history to be named Player of the Week during his very first week in the league.\n\nMoving On\n\nIn 1996, Shaq signed the biggest contract in NBA history when he signed with the Los Angeles Lakers—receiving a sum of money of 120 million dollars. During that same year, he played with the US Dream Team that won Olympic Gold in Atlanta, Georgia. Shaq was named NBA’s Most Valuable Player in 2000, continuing the forward motion of his career.\n\nPost-Lakers\n\nShaq was traded to the Miami Heat team following disagreements about the Lakers’ team management, and led the team to an NBA championship win in 2006 – the fourth one of his career. He went on to score his 25,000th point during the 2006-2007 basketball season and played for the Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. In June 2011, Shaq announced his intent to retire from the NBA after an illustrious career.\n\nRetirement\n\nFollowing his retirement, Shaq was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2016. He didn’t fully exit the basketball world, however, as he then became an NBA analyst for TNT’s program “Inside the NBA.” Shaq has also appeared in several films and had a side career as a rapper. He has a Masters of Business Administration and has also spent some time in the law enforcement division. A man of many hats, the seven-foot-one-inch tall basketball player has certainly made his mark on the sports industry and beyond."
