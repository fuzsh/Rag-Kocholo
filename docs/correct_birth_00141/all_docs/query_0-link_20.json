        "text": "New Jersey native and former NBA star Shaquille O’Neal announced today that he is backing Democrat Phil Murphy in this year's governor's race.\n\nO'Neal backed Republican Gov. Chris Christie in his 2013 re-election bid, calling the governor a \"great man\" and even appearing in an ad for him. Christie cannot seek re-election because of term limits.\n\nWhy is Shaq, who lives in Florida, weighing in on Jersey politics? It's abundantly clear that for him, all roads lead back to New Jersey.\n\nHere are 5 Jersey connections for the 7-foot-one ex-NBA star.\n\nNotable Native\n\nShaquille Rashaun O'Neal was born March 6, 1972 in Newark.\n\nHall of Fame, Class of 2009\n\nShaq was inducted into the New Jersey Hall of Fame in 2009. Governor Jon Corzine announced the class which included Paul Robeson, Walt Whitman, Guglielmo Marconi, Carl Sagan, Bud Abbott & Lou Costello, Jon Bon Jovi, Jerry Lewis, Althea Gibson, Phil Rizzuto, F. Scott Fitzgerald and William Carlos Williams.\n\nEndorsement:Shaq to back Democrat after GOP Christie endorsement in '13\n\nThe Godfather\n\nDuring his time at Louisiana State University, Shaq played football with Odell Beckham Sr. The two bonded over their love for football and time playing in Texas.\n\nWhen Heather Van Norman and Odell Sr. had their first child, Shaquille became godfather to their son: Odell Beckham Jr. Odell quickly grew to love the game of football, like his father and godfather. Shaq used to be a Cowboys fan. He quickly converted to a Giants fan when Odell was drafted in 2014.\n\nVolunteer Work\n\nShaq loved his time playing basketball at the Boys & Girls Club of America in Newark, so much so that he pledged $1 million in 1998 and has been a national spokesperson for more than a decade.\n\nBig Devils Fan\n\nShaq has been seen at a handful of games over the years, dropped the first puck and even drove the zamboni at the Prudential Center. He even shows his love for the Devils' on the road."
