        "text": "It’s not easy to be inconspicuous when you’re a 7-foot-1 NBA legend.\n\nAnd Shaquille O’Neal, a North Texas resident, hasn’t been shy about his presence. Since buying a home in Carrollton, the gregarious retired star basketball player has been a man about town — and social media has been documenting his outings.\n\nIt started in late May when Dallas real estate agent Zac Gideo posted a photo of him and O’Neal on Instagram, letting followers know he was behind the transaction that brought O’Neal to North Texas.\n\nRealtor.com later described the home, which was listed for $1,224,900 in April, as located in a secluded gated community in Collin County.\n\nOther social media posts have shown O’Neal being generous to those who appear in need.\n\nLast weekend, O’Neal and an on-camera NBA analyst were in a Best Buy in Dallas when O’Neal struck up a conversation with a young family looking for a washing machine, the New York Post’s Page Six reported. He bought the washer and also threw in a 70-inch television.\n\n“I just want to make people happy,” O’Neal told Page Six.\n\nOn July 6, a video was posted on Instagram showing O’Neal across the street from Babe’s Chicken Dinner House in Carrollton. O’Neal approached a woman who appeared to be in need and handed her a Babe’s carryout bag.\n\n“Could you use some money, too?” O’Neal asked before handing her some cash.\n\nBabe’s, which will soon compete with O’Neal’s Big Chicken restaurant chain, shared the video on its Facebook page.\n\nOn Friday, Carrollton Police posted an image of O’Neal and one of its officers on its Twitter account. Police requested another try at the selfie because a glare marred the photo.\n\nAlso Friday, O’Neal stopped in at a basketball camp at Tidwell Middle School in Roanoke, and Northwest ISD posted the appearance on social media. In a tweeted video, O’Neal is shown talking to campers, even mentioning the Babe’s original location in downtown Roanoke.\n\nHis wealth has been estimated at $600 million gained from years as a player and later an NBA analyst with numerous endorsement deals. Are we surprised at O’Neal’s generosity?\n\nOne clue: His Twitter description describes him as “VERY QUOTATIOUS, I PERFORM RANDOM ACTS OF SHAQNESS.”"
