Meanwhile, Evan and his âfriendsâ help Eddie buy The Hot Dooger, a hot dog-shaped water slide.\n\nEye of the Tiger\n\nJordan tries out for the basketball team, but the coach decides he is better suited for gymnastics -- as a ribbon dancer.\n\nA Short Story and a Tall Tale\n\nCleveland and Donna celebrate Valentineâs Day with a trip to Los Angeles after scoring courtside seats to the all-star basketball game. Caught up in the excitement, Cleveland gets rowdy and talks smack to the players from the sideline throughout the game. The basketball champs, feeling hurt, seek revenge by paying a surprise visit to Stoolbend and putting Cleveland in his place.\n\nHi, My Name Is...\n\nEvan is thrilled to open his first bank account, but is unsure if he should use his American name or his Chinese name on the account. This leads to Louis and Jessica revealing how each of them acquired their American names and reminiscing about the first time they met"
