        "text": "Basketball legend and NBA star Shaquille O’Neal retired from the game after 19 seasons, but his name is still greatly revered in the world of basketball. The 7′ 1″ New Jersey native attributes his success on and off the court to the support and values instilled in him while he was young. Recently, he returned to his hometown of Newark to give back to the Boys and Girls Club on Avon Avenue where his story started. NJTV’s Michael Hill caught up with Shaq at the Boys and Girls Club and asked him what it meant to him to have a place to go to when he was a kid and how he’s giving back."
