        "text": "There is a fundamental contradiction or opposition at the core of Shaquille O’Neal’s personality, but it does not shatter his integrity. However, it causes his inner world to be complex, divided, or even torn, without ever being totally dissociated, because every thought and action is a source of unification. As a result, intellectually Shaquille O’Neal is a talented syncretist. He is able to see the link between heterogeneous and diverse elements which do not appear to be related in the least. He can bring about surprising reconciliation, create unexpected bonds, combine beliefs which seem mutually incompatible.\n\nShaquille O’Neal’s imaginative powers also flow from the division in his psyche and are evidenced by inspirations, visions, and abilities which exceed the context of logic and reasoning. He allows himself to be guided by irrational phenomena like foreshadowing or premonitions, which well up from the depths of his being. He is more of a medium than an intuitive, because intuition requires a clear consciousness of reality. He is borne along by currents and tides of knowledge and lives in symbiosis with forces which overwhelm him. In fact, it is because of this relative passivity that he is more or less a medium, because he wishes merely to perceive what surrounds him; he has no wish to impose his will. Although this attitude endows him with great potential for productivity, it may also become dangerous, if he finds himself overpowered by forces he can never totally control. He tends to perceive things as undifferentiated; he does not always see the world as an organized, structured, hierarchical entity. Instead, he is sensitive to energy flows, to invisible forces which he perceives and tries to interpret. His consciousness knows no bounds, and he does not feel confined by either space or time. But the image of the infinite imprinted on his imagination has a tendency to manifest itself with a lack of definition, in most of his thoughts and acts.\n\nIn relation to other people, Shaquille O’Neal usually demonstrates warmth and humanism. He is a fairly pleasant companion, although his sensitivity can be annoying at times. He tends to identify with his friends to a great degree, instead of remaining apart and empathetic. In fact, he is capable of losing himself in another person at times. He should take time to reflect upon the quality of what he bestows on others and on whom he bestows it. He would doubtless come to the conclusion that his devotion is motivated by guilt feelings; his giving is a way of escaping from himself, and his broad tolerance sometimes merely hides a weak character. His basic aptitude for compassion could inspire him to relieve human misery, either privately or professionally. Hospital or prison work would not frighten him, because he understands them as closed environments which are open in terms of the inner adventures and journeys they house. Inner adventures are one thing Shaquille O’Neal understands.\n\nIn his ideal, Shaquille O’Neal feels capable of easing the worst suffering, but sometimes as he helps others overcome their problems, he is also trying to face up to his collective unconscious – that is, the final product of all his failures to assert himself, from childhood right up to adulthood. Because of his hypersensitivity, Shaquille O’Neal is a fairly delicate person. He tends to go through sorrowful or depressive phases, long psychic tunnels where his anguishes lurk. He would be wise to withstand them instead of trying to escape. If he could detect what triggered his lack of confidence in his unconscious, he might be healed.\n\nDue to the influence of Libra rising, Shaquille O’Neal treasures harmony and will actively, if not passionately, strive to achieve it, both in his social life (in his relationships with others) and in his private life (in terms of art, grace, and physical beauty). As a result, his intimate ties (to a partner, for example) will be of primordial interest to him, and he would feel unfulfilled if this aspect of his life were not successful. Still, he’ll do well to choose his partners carefully, and avoid rushing into marriage just to placate someone else’s anxiety. His sense of grace and beauty must also find an outlet, such as dance, if he is not to feel frustrated. Social and sociable, he commits himself entirely to his relationships and may take great pains to restore peace in his surroundings or mend bruised feelings in those around him. He is a born diplomat, and his passionate sense of justice, truth, and grace give him great gifts for promoting mutual understanding and harmony.\n\nShaquille O’Neal is dynamic. He needs to attract admiration and release his excess energy.\n\nThe ego which is available to others is no longer completely self-possessed. Shaquille O’Neal invests all his energy in his relationships and partnerships.\n\nAt the time of Shaquille O’Neal’s birth, his rising sign was located in Libra (the Scales), while the sun was passing through the sign of Pisces (the Fish). A summary of the various clues mentioned above provide Shaquille O’Neal’s personality profile. The following key words capture the essence of Shaquille O’Neal’s character and indicate certain contradictions which may be sources of tension:\n\nSociability – Emotionalism – Adaptability – Pliancy – Emotion – Humility and reserve – Tolerance – Idealism – Peaceful disposition – Sense of harmony – Intuition – Worldliness – Premonition.\n\nShaquille O’Neal is torn by a deep inner conflict between his intellectual, rational, methodical side and a more romantic, emotional, sensitive tendency. Shaquille O’Neal’s spontaneous urges and feelings are often restrained by his fussy, perfectionist reasoning; his idealistic ambitions and fantasies are stopped short by the moral and social considerations imposed by his intellect.\n\nConversely, Shaquille O’Neal’s analytical skills and critical judgments might be at odds with his emotionalism and impressionability. Shaquille O’Neal must work to make these two influences mutually comprehensible, to achieve, upon maturity, a well-balanced personality enriched by opposing elements. The most promising way to resolve the conflict is by moderating Shaquille O’Neal’s sensitivity, developing Shaquille O’Neal’s decision-making capacities, and channeling Shaquille O’Neal’s energy. Without stifling Shaquille O’Neal’s intuition and imagination, Shaquille O’Neal must be wary of his tendency to escape into a dream world.\n\nBorn between three and one-half and seven days after the rising of the full moon, Shaquille O’Neal is said to be a “shining moon” type. This soli-lunar configuration gives him a shining personality which is apt to communicate and transmit ideas.\n\nThroughout his life, he will be attracted to the idea of acting as a spokesperson for a cause, idea, or person whose message seems essential to him. He will have to develop his powers of discernment, to determine which subjects or people are really worth his personal commitment."
