        "text": ">> IN THE WORLD OF BASKETBALL,\n\nFEW PLAYERS MORE CELEBRATED OR\n\nMORE EXCITING TO WATCH THAN\n\nSHAQUILLE O'NEAL, ATTRIBUTING\n\nHIS SUCCESS BOTH ON AND OFF THE\n\nCOURT TO THE VALUES INSTILLED IN\n\nHIM AT THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB.\n\nAND HE WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR\n\nTO THE CLUB'S DENTAL CARE.\n\nOPPORTUNITY IN AMERICA, AND\n\nMICHAEL HILL HAD A CHANCE TO\n\nSPEAK WITH SHAQ.\n\nWHAT IT MEANT TO HAVE A PLACE\n\nLIKE THE BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB\n\nGROWING UP.\n\n>> THIS IS THE PLACE WHERE IT\n\nALL STARTED.\n\nBOTH PARENTS HAD JOBS.\n\nCOULDN'T AFFORD BABY-SITTERS.\n\nLIVED ACROSS THE STREET.\n\nI WAS INSTRUCTED TO COME HERE\n\nAFTER SCHOOL AND WAIT UNTIL ONE\n\nOF US CAME TO GET YOU.\n\nMISS BANKS, SHE IS STILL HERE\n\nSHE MADE SURE THAT ALL THE KIDS\n\nWENT IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.\n\nLET ME SEE YOUR HOMEWORK FOR.\n\nSO EDUCATION WAS IMPORTANT.\n\nAFTER WE SHOWED HER THE\n\nHOMEWORK, WE WERE ABLE TO PLAY.\n\nTHIS IS A SAFE HAVEN BUT ALSO A\n\nPLACE TO CULTIVATE MY DREAMS.\n\n>> YOU LEARNED A LOT.\n\n>> FIRST THING I LEARNED IS HOW\n\nTO TURN CRITICISM INTO\n\nMOTIVATION.\n\nWHEN YOU ARE BIGGER THAN\n\nEVERYBODY, EVERYBODY EXPECTS YOU\n\nTO BE MICHAEL JORDAN ALREADY.\n\nCOULDN'T PLAY, COULDN'T DUNK,\n\nBUT HAD THE DRIVE AND\n\nDETERMINATION.\n\n>> IF YOU WERE NOT HERE, AND\n\nTHIS CLUB WERE NOT HERE, WHERE\n\nWOULD SHAQUILLE O'NEAL HAVE\n\nBEEN?\n\n>> I THINK ABOUT THAT A LOT.\n\nI OWE THIS PLACE.\n\nTHAT IS WHY I KEEP COMING BACK.\n\nIF IT WASN'T FOR THIS PLACE,\n\nTHERE WOULDN'T BE SHAQUILLE\n\nO'NEILL.\n\nOR THE BRAND.\n\n>> THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY OF THIS\n\nWHEN I WAS A KID.\n\nI HELPED BUILD ALL THE STUFF IN\n\nTHERE NOW, AND IT IS AWESOME.\n\n>> KIDS NEVER GET A CHANCE TO GO\n\nTO THE DENTIST OR EYES EXAMINED,\n\nIN THIS CASE, ISSUES LATER ON IN\n\nLIFE ARE ADDRESSED.\n\n>> IT IS A BIG ORDEAL, KIDS ARE\n\nSHY BY NATURE, SO IF YOU CAN'T\n\nSEE, YOU WON'T READ.\n\nI CAN'T SEE, I WON'T READ.\n\nYEARS AFTER, THAT JUST ADDS TO\n\nILLITERACY.\n\nSO WE GET THEM IN THERE, AND GET\n\nTHEM TESTED AND TELL THEM DON'T\n\nWORRY ABOUT IT, PICK OUT A PAIR.\n\nAND IN HERE, WE ASSOCIATE\n\nREADING WITH COMIC BOOKS AND\n\nOTHER LITTLE BOOKS AND FUN BOOKS\n\nMANY START TO BRING UP THEIR\n\nCOMPREHENSION AND THAT IS WHAT\n\nWE WANT FOR THE YOUNGSTERS.\n\nWHEN I GOT TOGETHER WITH THE\n\nDOCTOR AND FRIENDS AND WE SAID\n\nWE GOTTA MAKE IT FREE.\n\nAND IT IS WONDERFUL.\n\nPEOPLE CALL IT GIVING BACK, AND\n\nTHIS IS WHAT I AM SUPPOSED TO\n\nDO.\n\nSUPPOSED TO DO IT BECAUSE MY\n\nMOTHER TOLD ME TO DO IT.\n\nYOU NEED TO GO BACK AND FIX THAT\n\nPLACE UP.\n\nFAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE A\n\nHOUSE, HANDLE THAT.\n\nSOME MAY CALL IT GIVING BACK,\n\nBUT I AM TAKING ORDERS FROM THE\n\nPERSON WHO RAISED ME.\n\n>> YOU VOWED TO KEEP THAT\n\nPROBLEM.\n\n>> ANY MAN THAT DON'T KEEP A\n\nPROMISE TO HIS MOTHER IS NOT A\n\nREAL MAN OR ANY MAN WHO DOESN'T\n\nHONOR HIS MOTHER, IS NOT A REAL\n\nMAN OR ANY WOMAN.\n\nMY MOM WORKED HARD FOR ME.\n\nTHE REASON WHY I WORK HARD FOR\n\nHER IS I APPRECIATE THAT.\n\nTHE FUNNY THING ABOUT OUR\n\nRELATIONSHIP, IS HER MOTHER TOLD\n\nHER WHEN I WAS BORN, THIS ONE IS\n\nSPECIAL.\n\nWATCH OUT FOR THIS ONE.\n\nTHIS ONE IS GOING TO BE WORLD\n\nKNOWN.\n\n1 YEARS OLD.\n\nI AM DOING WHAT I AM TOLD.\n\n>> I LISTEN TO YOU TELL YOUR\n\nSTORY ABOUT THIS CLUB AND WHAT\n\nYOU LEARNED HERE, YOU KNEW THEN\n\nWHEN YOU WERE A KID, DESPITE THE\n\nMINOR JUVENILE DELINQUENCY, AND\n\nOTHER STRUGGLES, YOU MAY HAVE\n\nHAD, YOU KNEW YOU WERE SPECIAL.\n\n>> I KNEW I WAS SPECIAL, BUT I\n\nDIDN'T KNOW I WAS GOING TO MAKE\n\nIT.\n\n50% OF PEOPLE TELLING YOU YOU\n\nARE GOING TO BE THAT.\n\nAND THE OTHER 50% YOU ARE NOT\n\nGOING TO DO THAT.\n\nAND YOU LEAN, MAYBE, I AM NOT\n\nGOING TO GO PRO OR GET A\n\nSCHOLARSHIP.\n\nBUT MY MOTHER AND FATHER TOLD ME\n\nNEVER GIVE UP.\n\nAND MISS BANKS WOULDN'T GIVE ME\n\nTHE ANSWER, DON'T GIVE UP.\n\nDO IT AGAIN.\n\nGO AHEAD, USE YOUR FINGERS.\n\nSIX TIMES FIVE IS 30.\n\nTHAT'S RIGHT, BABY.\n\nGROWING UP, YOU CAN'T GIVE UP.\n\n>> IN MAKING THE CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nYOU HAVE MADE HERE, THESE KIDS\n\nKNOW, SOMEBODY CARED ABOUT THEM.\n\n>> I THINK THEY KNOW THAT I\n\nCARE.\n\nBUT BASICALLY, I AM TELLING\n\nTHEM, I AM IN THE SAME SITUATION\n\nYOU ARE FROM.\n\nI KNOW YOU LOOK AT ME NOW, AND\n\nLOOK AT ALL THE TOYS.\n\nBUT THE WAY TO GET TO THE TOYS,\n\nYOU HAVE GOT TO START FROM\n\nSOMEWHERE.\n\nI USED TO EAT ONCE A DAY ALSO.\n\nAND I USED TO GO CHRISTMASES\n\nWITHOUT GETTING ANY PRESENTS.\n\nSO I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE\n\nGOING THROUGH.\n\nHOWEVER, THIS IS THE BLUE PRINT.\n\nI KNOW IT, BECAUSE I WROTE IT.\n\nI AM A DOCTOR.\n\nAND YOU STUDY THIS.\n\nTHERE IS A HELL OF A CHANCE THAT\n\nYOU CAN BE SUCCESSFUL OR MORE\n\nSUCCESSFUL THAN ME.\n\nBE A LEADER, NOT A FOLLOWER.\n\nNEVER GIVE UP.\n\nFOLLOW YOUR DREAMS.\n\nDON'T BE TALKING BACK TO THAT\n\nMAN LIKE THAT, YOU GO AND SAY\n\nYES, SIR, NO, SIR.\n\nTHAT IS ALL I HAD.\n\nI WASN'T A WHIZ KID, A GREAT\n\nATHLETES.\n\nTHOSE PRINCIPLES MADE ME WHO I\n\nAM TODAY.\n\nYOU FOLLOW THESE, BAM, YOU CAN\n\nGET OUT.\n\n>> YOU HAVE HAD AN IMPORTANT\n\nMENTOR IN YOUR LIFE.\n\n>> YEAH, DALE BROWN.\n\n13-YEARS OLD, 6'9\" COULDN'T\n\nDUNK, COULDN'T PLAY.\n\nIN GERMANY, WE WERE IN WEST\n\nGERMANY AT THE TIME.\n\nMY FATHER SAID LET'S GO LISTEN\n\nTO THIS GUY COACH, MAYBE YOU CAN\n\nGET A SCHOLARSHIP.\n\nSO I TALKED TO HIM, COACH, 6'9\",\n\nCAN'T PLAY, CAN'T DUNK.\n\nCAN YOU HELP ME WITH MY LOWER\n\nEXTREMITIES, I LEARNED THAT WORD\n\nTHE DAY BEFORE IN THE DICTIONARY\n\nBECAUSE I WAS ON PUNISHMENT.\n\nHE SAID HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN\n\nIN THE ARMY.\n\nI SAID I AM NOT IN THE ARMY, I\n\nAM 13.\n\nWHAT?\n\n13?\n\nSO WE KEPT IN TOUCH.\n\nHE SENT ME QUOTES, PAMPHLETS.\n\nAND I HAD TO WRITE HIM A PAINFUL\n\nLETTER, ALL THE STUFF YOU SENT\n\nME, DIDN'T WORK.\n\nTHANKS FOR THE WORK.\n\nI APPRECIATE YOU.\n\nI AM GOING TO QUIT AND JOIN THE\n\nARMY LIKE MY DAD.\n\nLOVE YOU.\n\nNEXT LETTER, I DON'T WANT YOU TO\n\nQUIT.\n\nFORGET BASKETBALL.\n\nDO YOUR STUDIES.\n\nGET BACK TO THE STATES AND CALL\n\nME.\n\nHE SAYS I WILL GIVE YOU A\n\nSCHOLARSHIP.\n\nFINANCIAL AID, DONE, WE'LL TAKE\n\nCARE OF IT.\n\nTHAT'S WHY I CHOSE TO GO TO LSU.\n\nHE SAW SOMETHING IN ME THAT I\n\nDON'T SEE IN MYSELF.\n\nBY THE TIME I GOT TO SAN\n\nANTONIO, I WAS THE NUMBER ONE\n\nPLAYER.\n\nHE HELPED ME THROUGH THE WAY.\n\n>> AND ONCE YOU WENT TO LSU?\n\n>> HE TOOK CARE OF ME, AND HAD\n\nTHE SAME PRINCIPLES MY PARENTS\n\nHAVE.\n\nLIKE, HEARD YOU WERE OUT WITH\n\nSOME GUYS DRINKING THE DAY, YOU\n\nKNOW BETTER THAN THAT.\n\nYOU KNOW TO BE A LEADER NOT A\n\nFOLLOWER.\n\nYES, SIR.\n\nI DON'T WANT YOU AROUND THAT\n\nCROWD.\n\nYES, SIR.\n\nDIDN'T GO TO CLASS, YOU HAD TO\n\nRUN 15 LAPS IN THE MORNING.\n\nVERY TOUGH.\n\nTOUGH LOVE PROPELLED ME TO\n\nGREATNESS.\n\n>> YOU ARE IN RETIREMENT NOW,\n\nYOU DON'T MISS THE GAME, DO YOU?\n\n>> NEVER.\n\nNOT AT ALL.\n\n>> TELL ME WHY.\n\n>> WHEN IT IS YOUR TURN, IT IS\n\nYOUR TURN.\n\nWHEN IT IS NOT YOUR TURN, IT'S\n\nNOT YOUR TURN.\n\nLUCKILY, I CAME IN WITH ALL OF\n\nTHE OLD STARS GOING OUT AND IT\n\nWAS MY TURN FOR A WHILE.\n\nAND YOU KNOW, GOT TEAMED UP WITH\n\nKOBE, AND IT WAS OUR TURN FOR A\n\nWHILE.\n\nAND SPLIT UP AND IT WAS STILL MY\n\nTURN.\n\nAND FOR ME RIGHT HERE, AND THE\n\nOTHER GUYS GROWING UP.\n\nI PLAYED 19 YEARS BUT I HAD A\n\nSTRONG 15 YEARS, WHERE IT WAS\n\nSHAQ, SHAQ.\n\nAND I KNEW THAT ONE DAY FATHER\n\nTIME WAS GOING TO SAY, TIME FOR\n\nYOU TO SIT DOWN AND RELAX.\n\n>> SURELY YOU EXPECTED THAT\n\nGIVEN A CAREER YOU HAD IN THE\n\nNBA, THAT IT WILL BE A CINCH\n\nTHAT YOU WOULD BE INDUCTED IN\n\nTHE HALL OF FAME.\n\n>> I EXPECTED IT NOT BECAUSE I\n\nWAS A GREAT PLAYER.\n\nI EXPECTED IT BECAUSE EVERYTHING\n\nMY MOTHER AND FATHER HAVE TAUGHT\n\nME HAS COME TRUE.\n\nYOU DON'T NEED TO FOLLOW HIM, HE\n\nIS GETTING THAT LITTLE $100.\n\nYOU GO TO SCHOOL AND YOU GET A\n\nEDUCATION AND YOU HAVE 100,000.\n\nEVERYTHING THEY TOLD ME HAS COME\n\nTRUE.\n\nI WISH MY FATHER WAS STILL HERE\n\nTO SHARE MY MOMENT WITH HIM.\n\nTHERE WERE SOMETIMES I DIDN'T\n\nBELIEVE IT MYSELF.\n\nI'M GOOD, BUT I'M NOT THAT GOOD.\n\nTHAT MICHAEL JORDAN, OH, I WOULD\n\nNEVER GET TO THAT LEVEL.\n\nTHEN MY TURN.\n\nAND EVERY TIME I STUCK TO MY, I\n\nDON'T WANT TO USE THE WORD GUNS,\n\nBUT EVERY TIME I STUCK TO MY\n\nPRINCIPLES, I WAS NEVER LET\n\nDOWN.\n\nPEOPLE COME AND THEY SEE CERTAIN\n\nNEIGHBORHOODS AND THEY SEE RISK\n\nAND WON'T MAKE THE INVESTMENTS,\n\nWON'T GIVE IT THE TIME OF DAY.\n\nWHAT DO YOU SEE THAT THEY DON'T\n\nSEE?\n\n>> I SEE BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE.\n\nI SEE RELATIVES.\n\nI SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO MAKE IT.\n\nI SEE PEOPLE TRYING TO SAVE T\n\nTHE LITTLE RIFFRAFF THAT ARE\n\nDOING WHAT THEY ARE DOING CAN BE\n\nCONTROLLED.\n\nBUT, YOU KNOW, IT WAS OUR JOBS\n\nTO KEEP IT BEAUTIFUL.\n\nAND I AM INVESTING A LOT AND\n\nURGE EVERYONE TO COME AND BUILD\n\nIN IT.\n\nIT IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.\n\n>> YOU CAN CARE ABOUT ANY PLACE\n\nIN THE WORLD.\n\n>> IF I WANT TO KEEP MY\n\nSHARPNESS, I HAVE GOT TO COME\n\nBACK HOME AND GET MY PARTS\n\nREPLACED, PERIOD.\n\nTHAT'S WHY.\n\nTHEY DON'T BUILD THIS SECTION\n\nANYWHERE ELSE.\n\n>> YOU DID SAY SEXINESS, RIGHT?\n\n>> SEXINESS."
