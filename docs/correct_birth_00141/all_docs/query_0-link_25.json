        "text": "Who is Shaquille O'Neal?\n\nBefore breaking rims and shattering backboards became rather routine, the NBA rarely saw a phenomenon quite like Shaquille O'Neal. During his 19-year-long career, O'Neal built a reputation around his physical dominance on the court. Standing at 7'1\" tall and weighing over 300 pounds during his prime, he was notoriously unguardable.\n\nWith 4 NBA championships, an MVP award, 15 All-Star selections, and over 28,000 career points, he is noted to be one of basketball's most influential big men ever. He ventured into music, entrepreneurship, and entertainment after basketball, which only furthered his worldwide fame.\n\nShaquille O'Neal's early life\n\nShaquille O'Neal was born in Newark, New Jersey, to Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney. He did not know of his biological father, Joe Toney, who was imprisoned for drug possession when Shaq was very young. Lucille, his mother, then married a military drill sergeant - Phillip A. Harrison, who played a big role in Shaq's childhood. Shaq has three siblings, Ayesha, Jamal, and Lateefah O'Neal. Ayesha battled with cancer and passed away in 2019.\n\nWhile O'Neal became a national sensation because of his dominance on the court, his larger-than-life personality and humor made him a popular figure around the world. When he first entered the league, Shaq was not confident with the media. However, he understood its importance and worked on his skills, which helped in ways not many could have imagined.\n\nShaq studied business at Louisiana State University and played college basketball for the Tigers. His parents were adamant he should complete his college education before testing the league. Be that as it may, as coach Dale Brown was concerned O'Neal could end up with a career-ending injury due to the hard fouls he had been enduring in college games, he suggested O'Neal should declare for the NBA draft.\n\nAfter three years of college, Shaq declared for the NBA draft and the Orlando Magic drafted him as the #1 pick in 1992. He got the go-ahead for this as he promised his mother that he would return to finish his degree. Shaq then kept his promise by completing his bachelor's degree in 2000 while still playing in the NBA.\n\nAs O'Neal felt disrespected when he was ignored during business meetings by his associates, he obtained an MBA degree from the University of Phoenix in 2005 to prove he has what it takes to be a successful entrepreneur. His mother came to him with tears of joy after his MBA and motivated him to go further. Then, in 2012, Shaq earned his doctoral degree in organizational learning and leadership, specializing in human resource development from Barry University.\n\nShaquille O Neal's wife and children\n\nShaquille O'Neal has six children. In 1996, he and his ex-girlfriend Arnetta Yardbourgh welcomed their first child, Taahirah O'Neal. He then married Shaunie Henderson in 2002. Shaunie is a reality TV star and one of the executive producers of the Basketball Wives TV series.\n\nShe had a son, Myles, from a previous relationship. O'Neal and Shaunie then had four children: Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me'arah. Shaquille O'Neal and Shaunie separated in 2011 after nine years of marriage. She then tied the knot with Pastor Keion Henderson in 2022.\n\nShaq has not re-married since his divorce. Among his children, Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me'arah are following in their father's footsteps in pursuing basketball. At 17, Me'arah is already growing at a rapid pace and has all the markings of a great player. She recently committed to play college basketball for the Florida Gators, snubbing her father's alma mater, LSU. The four-star prospect is ranked No. 33 for the Class of 2024.\n\nShaquille O'Neal's net worth 2024\n\nShaquille O'Neal signed a 7-year $120 million contract when he joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996. It was one of the biggest deals at the time. Throughout his storied career, he went on to earn nearly $290 million in NBA salary and over $200 million in endorsements.\n\nWith a knack for business, the 4x NBA champion has also built an empire. He owns a total of 50 brands in different industries. As of January 2024, Shaq has amassed a net worth of $400 million.\n\nShaquille O'Neal's NBA career timeline\n\nShaquille O'Neal played in the NBA for six teams throughout his 19-year career. He took the league by storm as a rookie. In his fourth NBA season, O'Neal led the Orlando Magic to the 1995 NBA Finals. Shaq then joined the Los Angeles Lakers in 1996, the same year the Lakers acquired a young Kobe Bryant on draft day.\n\nShaq and the Lakers struggled initially. However, the addition of head coach Phil Jackson changed everything. He then led the Lakers to a three-peat (2000-2002). Shaq won the Finals MVP award on all three occasions and also won the 2000 NBA MVP.\n\nIn 2004, O'Neal took his talents to South Beach and helped the Miami Heat win the NBA Championship in 2006. However, Shaq was no longer at his prime and suffered multiple nagging injuries. From 2007 to 11, he played for three teams and announced his retirement while playing for the Boston Celtics in 2011, when he was 39.\n\nDuring his career, basketball rims and backboards were not safe. Shaq has broken a whopping 19 rims with his powerful slams. In 2017, O'Neal posted a picture of a sculpture made of all 19 rims he had broken and called it 'Broken Rim Tree.'\n\nShaquille O'Neal's contracts\n\nHere's a breakdown of Shaquille O'Neal's contracts and earnings throughout his NBA career:\n\nYearTeamSalaryCareer Earnings1992-93Orlando Magic$3,000,000$3,000,0001993-94Orlando Magic$3,900,000$3,900,0001994-95Orlando Magic$4,800,000$4,800,0001995-96Orlando Magic$5,700,000$5,700,0001996-97Los Angeles Lakers$10,714,000$10,714,0001997-98Los Angeles Lakers$12,857,143$12,857,1431998-99Los Angeles Lakers$9,146,341$9,146,3411999-00Los Angeles Lakers$17,142,858$17,142,8582000-01Los Angeles Lakers$19,285,715$19,285,7152001-02Los Angeles Lakers$21,428,572$21,428,5722002-03Los Angeles Lakers$23,571,429$23,571,4292003-04Los Angeles Lakers$24,749,999$24,749,9992004-05Los Angeles Lakers$27,696,430$27,696,4302005-06Miami Heat$20,000,000$20,000,0002006-07Miami Heat$20,000,000$20,000,0002007-08Phoenix Suns$20,000,000$20,000,0002008-09Phoenix Suns$21,000,000$21,000,0002009-10Cleveland Cavaliers$20,000,000$20,000,0002010-11Boston Celtics$1,352,181$1,352,181Approximate Earnings$286,344,668$286,344,668\n\nShaquille O'Neal's endorsements and investments\n\nShaquille O'Neal is one of the most successful former athletes turned businessman. Big Diesel owns a total of 50 brands in different industries, with over 172 restaurants and 150 car washes. Even though he has been retired for over a decade now, Shaq still endorses 30 companies.\n\nO'Neal was a part owner of a whopping 155 Five Guys Burgers restaurants. He is the proud owner of franchises such as Krispy Kreme, Papa John's Pizza, Auntie Anne's Pretzel, Car Wash, and 24-Hour Fitness. Additionally, he owns 9 Papa John's Pizza restaurants. Shaq also invested in companies like Apple, PepsiCo, Google, and General Electric. His investment in Google helped him massively increase his net worth.\n\nO'Neal is also a shareholder of the Authentic Brands Group which owns JCPenney and Forever 21. The group has the right to royalty of legends like Elvis Presley, Muhammad Ali, and Marilyn Monroe. Being the second-highest shareholder, Shaq too owns a percentage of the legends' royalties.\n\nEven though Shaq has made some very smart investments that helped him build his business empire, he has also missed out on some huge opportunities, including investing in Starbucks. He opted not to invest in the chain of coffeehouses because of an interesting reason.\n\nAround the court, Shaq was once a minority owner of the Sacramento Kings, but he recently sold his shares. However, he is still open to being an owner in the NBA and expressed his desire to buy stakes at his former team the Orlando Magic.\n\nShaquille O’Neal's NBA career stats\n\nRegular season games played - 1207\n\nRegular season points per game - 23.7\n\nRegular season rebounds per game - 10.9\n\nRegular season assists per game - 2.5\n\nPlayoff games played - 216\n\nPostseason points per game - 24.3\n\nPostseason rebounds per game - 11.6\n\nPostseason assists per game - 2.7\n\nShaquille O'Neal: Awards and achievements\n\n4x NBA champion (2000, 2002, 2006)\n\n3xNBA Finals MVP (2000, 2002)\n\nNBA Most Valuable Player (2000)\n\n15x NBA All-Star (1993, 1998, 2000, 2007, 2009)\n\n3x NBA All-Star Game MVP (2000, 2004, 2009)\n\n8x All-NBA First Team (1998, 2000, 2006)\n\n2x NBA scoring champion (1995, 2000)\n\n2x All-NBA Second Team (1995, 1999)\n\n3x NBA All-Defensive Second Team (2000, 2001, 2003)\n\n4x All-NBA Third Team (1994, 1996, 1997, 2009)\n\nNBA Rookie of the Year (1993)\n\nNBA All-Rookie First Team (1993)\n\nShaquille O'Neal: Records\n\nShaquille O'Neal finished his NBA career with 23.7 points, 10.9 rebounds, and 2.3 blocks per game in the regular season.

The partnership, however, dates back to Shaq's early days in the NBA. Dating back to the mid-90s, Shaq helped launch Reebok to the grand stage in the world of basketball, attracting players like Allen Iverson, who has joined O'Neal as the Vice President of Reebok Basketball.\n\nShaq re-calls one incident that particularly moved him in his history with Reebok. While leaving the arena one day, O'Neal was approached by a parent, who accused Shaq of overpricing his sneakers. Having been challenged by the woman to make more affordable shoes, Shaq declined his $40 million five-year contract with Reebok. He went on to collaborate with Walmart, releasing a shoe priced under $30.\n\nShaquille O’Neal’s house\n\nShaquille O'Neal's massive houses are fit for a giant of his size. The Lakers icon's 35,000-square-foot lakefront estate sits on 3 acres of land in a gated community outside Orlando. It has 12 bedrooms and 11 full bathrooms. The foyer features a sweeping double staircase and 35-foot ceilings. The property boasts a 6,000-square-foot indoor basketball court, a 17-plus car showroom-style garage, a home theater, and a giant Superman-themed bed. The mansion, after 26 years of ownership by the big man, was put up for sale in 2019 for a whopping $21.9 million. He had bought this estate in 1993 for a comparatively paltry $4million.\n\nOn top of this, Shaq also has mansions in Dallas and Atlanta. His house in Atlanta rests on a massive 14.3-acre property, which he bought back in 2016 for $1.15 million. Shaq's other French-style home in Dallas, purchased in 2022, was listed at $1,225,000 at the time of purchase.\n\nShaquille O’Neal’s rings\n\nShaquille O'Neal is one of the most decorated players in NBA history, winning 4 championship rings over his career. He laid hands on his first title in 2000 as a member of the Los Angeles Lakers, defeating the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Finals. He would go on to win two more consecutive championships in 2001 and 2002, forming a dominant duo with Kobe Bryant at the Lakers. Shaq, however, earned his 4th and final ring with the Miami Heat in 2006, defeating the Dallas Mavericks 4-2 in the NBA Finals.\n\nShaquille O’Neal’s car and bike collection\n\nShaq is a huge car enthusiast and owns over 30 vehicles, including many luxury and sports cars.
