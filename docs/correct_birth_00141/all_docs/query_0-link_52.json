        "text": "Shaquille O’Neal, never shy to re-brand himself in the moment, didn’t hesitate to think of a new nickname to dub himself if the former perennial NBA All-Star can accomplish the latest goal he has in mind.\n\n“The black Ray Chambers,” he said.\n\nChambers, a billionaire philanthropist, co-owner of the Devils and a former Nets owner, helped move the Devils to Newark. O’Neal, a native of the city, wants to deliver a professional team as well.\n\nHe said he is working to bring an NBA team to the Prudential Center, where he appeared today as an honoree of the Boys & Girls Clubs of Newark. O’Neal first dropped hints of that goal last year, and the pursuit is still on. With the Nets set to migrate to Brooklyn next season, the arena will be short an NBA tenant.\n\n“Yes, still working on it, still having conversations and still doing certain things to help beautify this city,” O’Neal said. “When the time is right, we’ll have a party. I don’t want to say things that are out of pretext or context. There’s things going on, we’re working on it, trust me. We’re working on it every day.”\n\nThe desire is apparent. Always one for big proclamations, he said if a team arrives “we’ll have the biggest party Newark has ever seen.” But O’Neal also took to filibustering when asked how the plan would come together, corking the details rather than divulging them under prodding.\n\nHis role in the process still seems unsettled. He wouldn’t say if it was a new franchise in the works, giving the league an odd number of teams unless paired with another, or if a current organization would be dropping in.\n\n“It would be as an owner, possible general manager, possibly introducing some people to some people,” O’Neal said. “A couple of years ago I tried to help the marriage of the Nets to the Newark arena when I just made the statement, ‘How come the Nets are not playing in this arena?’ It was too late. But if I had been in those conversations earlier, hopefully the Nets would still be playing (in Newark).”\n\nWith specifics scant, the realistic chances of O’Neal bringing a team to the city are dubious to some. Former Nets owner Lewis Katz, also at the event, offered a dismissive wave.\n\nChambers, co-owner with Katz before they sold the team in 2005, was more optimistic about O’Neal’s ability to bring a team to Newark.\n\n“I do,” Chambers said. “I think he’s the most important basketball figure in the world.”\n\nO’Neal, dressed in a gray suit and pink checkered shirt, was on hand to receive the Brightest Star award from the club he has been a part of since he was 8 years old. Under direct orders from his parents, he would spend his afternoons there, rather than at his home at Clinton and Avon avenues, to avoid the pitfalls he said had him on track to become a “high-level juvenile delinquent.”\n\nWith an arena now standing a little more than a mile away from where he grew up, O’Neal spoke in glossy — if not cloak and dagger — terms of finding a way to fill it with a new basketball team.\n\n“It would be very huge,” he said with his usually booming voice kept to a hushed tone. “It’s always been a dream of mine but, of course, everything has to be put in place, and right now me and my team are working very diligently to get that done. Again, I don’t want to speak about it too much as long as the basis of this story is ‘Shaq is trying,’ and I really am trying to bring a team.”"
