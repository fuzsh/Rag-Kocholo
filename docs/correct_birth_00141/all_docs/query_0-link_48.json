        "text": "For Shaquille O’Neal, the Boys & Girls Club was a safe, supportive place to play basketball in his hometown of Newark, N.J. Encouraged by the staff, he became interested in Club programs and activities, especially those involving technology.\n\nIn 1998, Shaq pledged $1 million to Boys & Girl Clubs of America to help build technology centers in Clubs. He also collaborated with BGCA and Microsoft to create an online safety program for kids.\n\nDuring the last decade, Shaq’s legacy has grown to include some 2,000 tech centers in Clubs and thousands of tech-savvy young people. Shaq continues to support Boys & Girls Clubs, never forgetting how critical it is to give kids hope and opportunity."
