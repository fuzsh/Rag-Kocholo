        "text": "On this day in Boston Celtics history, veteran Celtics guard Marcus Osmond Smart was born in Flower Mound, Texas in 1994.\n\nThe future Celtic defensive specialist would play his college ball with the Oklahoma State University Cowboys. There, he won Big 12 Player of the Year and NCAA Second Team All-American honors in 2013 and was named a National Association of Basketball Coaches Third Team All-American the following year. He would of course be taken sixth overall in the 2014 NBA draft and has played solely with the Celtics ever since, garnering All-Rookie Second Team honors in 2015, and All-Defensive First Team honors in 2019 and 2020.\n\nHappy birthday, Marcus!"
