With young guard Dwyane “Flash” Wade, O’Neal led the Heat to a national championship in 2006.\n\nAfter an injury-plagued and rocky 2007, O’Neal recovered and was traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2008. After a disappointing season for the Suns he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009, to play alongside LeBron James.\n\nHe changed teams again in August of 2010, signing with the Boston Celtics."
