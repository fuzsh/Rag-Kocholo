        "text": "Attention Carrollton residents: Shaquille O’Neal is your new neighbor.\n\nThe National Basketball Association legend recently bought a home on a 0.228-acre lot in the Denton County portion of Carrollton.\n\nAttention Shaq: Recycling collection goes out every other week in your neighborhood and the HOA bill comes semi-annually.\n\nShaq’s new home has soaring ceilings, a huge primary bedroom with a spa-like bathroom, a kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances, and a backyard with a pool and waterfall, according to brokerage Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate.\n\n“I found him the perfect home and most of the process was done virtually — Facetime calls, videos of the property, etc.,” agent Zac Gideo said in a statement. Cindy O’Gorman at Ebby Halliday represented the seller.\n\nDirt.com describes the home:\n\n“Sitting cheek-to-jowl with similarly sized homes on a quarter-acre plot, the stately stone-quoined. European-inspired manor house spans 5,300 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms, plus a pair of powder rooms.\n\n“Four fluted stone columns flank the front door, and two more flamboyant Corinthian columns stand between the foyer and the formal dining room. A library/office is handsomely wrapped in polished wood paneling, and lustrous beige marble floors run throughout the sprawling great room, which features a contemporary linear fireplace and walls of windows that overlook the backyard.”\n\nThe home is in a secluded gated community. But to limit gawkers, this is all the description you’ll get from CandysDirt.com.\n\nWe also did learn that the house cost Shaq — or whoever manages his $400 million estimated wealth — $1.55 million, which was more than the $1.22 million listing price. Shaq, or his people, bought the home in April, records show.\n\nNow, at age 50, is it possible that Shaq is downsizing?\n\nIn October, Shaq finally unloaded his Windemere, Florida, mansion, selling it for $11 million, well under the asking price of $28 million. According to Dirt.com, Shaq has holdings in a modest home in the Ladera Heights area of Los Angeles and a 14.3-acre, two-residence compound about 30 miles southeast of Atlanta.\n\nIt doesn’t match mansions by other former NBA stars such as Dirk Nowitzki or Jermaine O’Neal (not related to Shaq). Shaq’s house pales in comparison to Nowitzki’s $5.75 million Preston Hollow mansion. The sale of Jermaine O’Neal’s $9.825 million Southlake mansion is pending.\n\nLikely, Shaq will use his new pad as a presence in North Texas where his new Big Chicken restaurant chain or to chill if he’s doing business in the Dallas area.\n\nIn Shaq’s new shack, the kitchen is a modest size. At 7-foot-1, Shaq will have to stoop to use the appliances and make use of the kitchen island. The backyard pool is also a modest size, just big enough for Shaq to try a cannonball.\n\nShaq, a native of San Antonio, loves him some Texas.\n\nIn an interview with Real Money, Shaq revealed that he’s a fan of Buc-ee’s. Wouldn’t you know it? If he’s got a hankering for Beaver Nuggets, he can hop on the expressway and find a Buc-ee’s in Denton, Melissa, or Fort Worth.\n\nShaq hit the jackpot in becoming a Carrollton resident."
