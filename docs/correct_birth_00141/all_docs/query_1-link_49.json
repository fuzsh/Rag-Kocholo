        "text": "What Is Shaquille O'Neal's Net Worth?\n\nShaquille O'Neal is a retired American basketball player, entrepreneur, television host, and product endorser who has a net worth of $500 million. Shaquille O'Neal is one of the most dominant and iconic centers in the history of the NBA. Over his 19-year career, Shaq earned numerous accolades and achievements, including four NBA Championships, three NBA Finals MVP awards, and 15 All-Star selections. In addition to his prowess on the court, Shaq has also made a significant impact off the court, becoming a successful entrepreneur, television personality, and philanthropist.\n\nShaq's NBA journey began in 1992 when the Orlando Magic selected him as the first overall pick in the NBA Draft. He quickly made a name for himself, winning the NBA Rookie of the Year award and leading the Magic to the NBA Finals in just his third season. However, it was his tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers from 1996 to 2004 that cemented his legacy. Alongside Kobe Bryant, Shaq won three consecutive NBA Championships from 2000 to 2002 and was named the Finals MVP each time. Later in his career, Shaq secured his fourth championship ring with the Miami Heat in 2006.\n\nOff the court, Shaquille O'Neal has been a marketing powerhouse, endorsing a wide range of products and brands throughout his career. His estimated career earnings from salary and endorsements exceed $800 million, making him one of the highest-paid athletes of all time. Some of his most notable endorsement deals include Reebok, Pepsi, Icy Hot, and Buick. During his NBA career, Shaq earned $292 million in salary alone. He earned well over $200 million from endorsements during that same time period. Even though he has been retired for many years, Shaq still earns around $60 million per year from endorsements and various business endeavors to this day.\n\nShaq's charisma and larger-than-life personality have also made him a beloved figure in the entertainment industry. He has appeared in numerous films and television shows, released rap albums, and currently serves as an analyst on the popular basketball show \"Inside the NBA.\" Moreover, Shaq has built a successful investment portfolio, which includes ownership stakes in companies like Google, Papa John's, and a variety of franchise businesses.\n\nEarly Life\n\nShaquille O'Neal was born Shaquille Rashaun O'Neal on March 6th, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey. He is the son of Lucille O'Neal and Joe Toney. His father was addicted to drugs and went to prison for drug possession when O'Neal was just a baby. His parents never married, and his father left soon after Shaq was born upon his release from prison. O'Neal was estranged from his father for decades. At the age of two, his mother married Phillip Harrison, who was a sergeant in the U.S. Army. O'Neal was a part of the Boys and Girls Club of America while growing up and he credits the organization for helping to keep him off the streets. The family moved from Newark to military bases in Germany and Texas. While still in high school, Shaq started to gain attention for his basketball talent. In his senior year at Robert G. Cole High School in San Antonio, he led the basketball team to the state championship. O'Neal went on to Louisiana State University, where he became a two-time SEC player of the year and a two-time All-American. He also received the Adolph Rupp's Trophy for the NCAA men's basketball player of the year in 1991.\n\nNBA Superstar\n\nIn 1992, O'Neal became the first overall pick for the Orlando Magic. A year later, he was named the Rookie of the Year and voted an All-Star starter, which had not been accomplished since Michael Jordan. In his second season, Shaq helped the Magic make their way to their first playoff series. The next year, they made it to the finals but lost to the Houston Rockets.\n\nO'Neal was plagued by injury for a good deal of the 1995-96 season, though the Orlando Magic still finished the regular season with a winning record. In the playoffs that year, O'Neal and the Magic won the first two rounds but were ultimately defeated by Michael Jordan's Chicago Bulls.\n\nIn 1996, O'Neal was part of the men's Olympic basketball team in Atlanta. That team went on to win the Olympic gold medal. It was during the Olympics that O'Neal announced his plans to join the Los Angeles Lakers as tensions rose amongst his coach, teammates, and local Orlando Media. The Lakers offered him a seven-year, $121 million deal.\n\nThis move paired Shaq with a teenaged Kobe Bryant, bringing two of the game's biggest names together on one team. However, while his first few years with the Lakers were promising, they failed to clinch a championship. O'Neal battled against injury and personnel changes until a change in leadership turned things around.\n\nThe arrival of former Chicago Bulls coach Phil Jackson in the 1999-00 season set the Lakers on a path that would make them a dominant force for years to come. Jackson challenged O'Neal and led him to step up his defensive game. Shaquille and the Lakers won the NBA championship that year and would go on to win the title the next two years in a row.\n\nO'Neal was traded to the Miami Heat in 2004. The following year, Shaq signed a 5-year contract with the team for $100 million. While he likely could have demanded more money, he stated that it was another championship that he was after. The team got their chance the very next year, as the Heat beat the Dallas Mavericks to clinch the team's first-ever title and O'Neal's fourth.\n\nBeginning in 2008, O'Neal's days of long-term contracts with teams had come to an end. That year, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns, where, for the first time since his rookie season, he failed to make the playoffs. At the end of his first season with the team, he was traded to free up the budget. More one-year stints would follow, including with the Cleveland Cavaliers (alongside Lebron James) and his final season with the Boston Celtics.\n\nPlayer Profile\n\nShaq stands at an astonishing 7 ft. 1 in., and his shoe size is a remarkable 23. He became famous largely due to his physical stature, which gave him a distinct advantage over his opponents. On two occasions in his early NBA career, Shaq's overwhelmingly powerful dunks broke the steel backboard supports of the net. This prompted the league to increase the strength and stability of the backboards from then on. O'Neal is famous for his \"drop step\" move, which he nicknamed the Black Tornado.\n\nShaquille O'Neal Salary\n\nWhat was Shaquille O'Neal's peak salary? $27 million\n\nSalary by year and team:\n\n1992-93 Orlando Magic $3,000,000\n\n1993-94 Orlando Magic $3,900,000\n\n1994-95 Orlando Magic $4,800,000\n\n1995-96 Orlando Magic $5,700,000\n\n1996-97 Los Angeles Lakers $10,714,000\n\n1997-98 Los Angeles Lakers $12,857,143\n\n1998-99 Los Angeles Lakers $15,000,000\n\n1999-00 Los Angeles Lakers $17,142,858\n\n2000-01 Los Angeles Lakers $19,285,715\n\n2001-02 Los Angeles Lakers $21,428,572\n\n2002-03 Los Angeles Lakers $23,571,429\n\n2003-04 Los Angeles Lakers $24,749,999\n\n2004-05 Miami Heat $27,696,430\n\n2005-06 Miami Heat $20,000,000\n\n2006-07 Miami Heat $20,000,000\n\n2007-08 Phoenix Suns $20,000,000\n\n2008-09 Phoenix Suns $21,000,000\n\n2009-10 Cleveland Cavaliers $20,000,000\n\n2010-11 Boston Celtics $1,352,181\n\nTotal career NBA earnings = $292,198,327\n\nOther Media and Business Ventures\n\nIn the early nineties, Shaq was quickly becoming a huge star, exploring careers in the rap and film industry, appearing in films such as \"Blue Chips\" and \"Kazaam\". He has also been featured in guest roles in a number of other films and television shows, including \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"The Parkers.\" His first rap album, \"Shaq Diesel\" was released in 1993 and went on to become certified Platinum. He continues to DJ and produce music under the name DIESEL. Shaq has also been featured in several video games throughout his career. In 2023, he released his first single from his debut album as DJ Diesel, \"Bang Your Head.\"\n\nFurthermore, O'Neal has starred in multiple reality series and hosts his own podcast. Other media roles include being a frequent commentator on NBA games and even a stint in professional wrestling.\n\nO'Neal has been active in the stock market and real estate since the 1990s. He has shown an interest in the business world as well. On March 22, 2019, it was announced that he would join the Board of Directors of Papa John's. With the job, Shaq will earn $8.25 million in salary and stock over three years. He is also investing $840,000 of his own money to buy 30% of a 9-unit Papa John's franchise in Atlanta.\n\nOther restaurant franchises Shaq has been involved with include Krispy Kreme, Five Guys, and Auntie Anne's.\n\nIn 2013, Shaq paid $5 million for a 1% stake in the NBA's Sacramento Kings. In August 2021, he sold his stake in the team so he could become the primary endorser of an online gambling company called WynnBET. He sold his stake in the Kings for $11 million.\n\nIn 2021, O'Neal became a paid spokesperson for the cryptocurrency exchange company FTX. In November 2022, FTX filed for bankruptcy, wiping out billions of dollars, including Shaq's personal stake in the company.\n\nEndorsements\n\nFew athletes have embraced endorsements as fully as Shaquille O'Neal. As an instantly recognizable celebrity, a variety of companies have sought him out as a spokesperson. Some of his higher-profile endorsements include Pepsi, Carnival Cruise Line, and Reebok. A full list of Shaq's endorsement deals and commercial appearances would be too long to list.\n\nAcademic Achievements\n\nOne of Shaquille O'Neal's other great accomplishments is that of gaining a doctoral degree in education. After receiving his master's degree from the University of Phoenix, O'Neal embarked on the course through the private Catholic institution Barry University. The course was primarily completed online over a number of years and reflected O'Neal's passion for education and his interest in continuing to challenge himself.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nShaq married Shaunie Nelson in December 2002. They have four children together: Shareef, Amirah, Shaqir, and Me'arah. Shaq also has a daughter, Taahirah, from a previous relationship with Arnetta Yardbourgh. O'Neal filed for divorce from Shaunie in September 2007. They changed their mind and withdrew their divorce, but in November 2009, Shaunie filed an intent to divorce. She cited irreconcilable differences. O'Neal dated reality star Nicole Alexander from 2010 to 2012. In 2014, Shaq started dating model Laticia Rolle. The couple split in March 2018.\n\nShaq's son, Shareef O'Neal, is a professional basketball player and recently signed a six-figure deal to play for NBA G League team Ignite.\n\nWhen Hall of Fame center George Mikan died in June 2005, O'Neal paid for all of his funeral expenses.\n\nReal Estate\n\nFor many recent years, Shaq's primary residence was an enormous 12-bedroom mansion in Orlando. The main home is 35,000 square feet and features a 6,000-square-foot indoor basketball court, a 17-car garage, and a 10-foot privacy wall. Shaq purchased the land for his home back in 1993 for $4 million and proceeded to custom-build his dream mansion.\n\nHe listed the home for sale for the first time in May 2018 for $28 million. He lowered the price in January 2019 to $22 million. It is located within a gated community called Isleworth Golf & Country Club.\n\nIn September 2020, Shaq lowered the asking price of the property to $19.5 million. He finally accepted $16.5 million in January 2021. Check out the video tour:\n\nOutside of Florida, Shaq owns a 15-acre in suburban Atlanta, which he bought in 2017 for $1.15 million.\n\nIn 2018, he paid $1.8 million for a home within a gated community in an LA suburb called Bell Canyon. He listed this home for sale at the end of 2019 for $2.5 million.\n\nIn 2021, O'Neal purchased a home north of Henderson in Las Vegas for $1.95 million after his son, Shareef, signed with the Henderson-based NBA G League team Ignite. The home was listed for sale for $3 million before being abruptly taken off the market in 2022.\n\nIn May 2022, Shaq paid $1.5 million for a 5,200-square-foot home in Carrollton, Texas."
