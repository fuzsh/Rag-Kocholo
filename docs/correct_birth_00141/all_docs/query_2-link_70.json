        "text": "He grew up in Texas, and now he’s back.\n\nShaquille O’Neal, a former National Basketball Association all-star, worked with real estate agent Zac Gideo to buy a home on a 0.228-acre lot in Collin County, according to brokerage Rogers Healy and Associates Real Estate.\n\nIn a release, Gideo did not share the sale price or the exact location. The home has “soaring” ceilings — exactly what a 7-foot-1 guy needs, a huge primary bedroom with a spa-like bathroom, a kitchen with top-of-the-line appliances, and a backyard with a large pool and waterfall, according to the firm.\n\n“I found him the perfect home, and most of the process was done virtually—facetime calls, videos of the property, etc.,” Gideo said in a statement.\n\nIn selling his Orlando mansion, O’Neal, 50, worked with five different agents to try and sell his $11 million mansion he bought for $28 million, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nIn the statement, Gideo said he worked with O’Neal in May. Rogers Healy and Associates also said it has lent its “expertise to a handful of other high-profile clientele.”\n\nThe firm also provided real estate services to Pat Mahomes, a Texas native who plays quarterback for the Kansas City Chiefs; Derrick Henry, a fullback for the Tennessee Titans; and Sean Lowe from ABC’s The Bachelor.\n\nIn a way, O’Neal is returning to his Texas roots. He graduated from Cole High School in San Antonio. He retired in 2011 after playing for six teams and winning four league titles during his 19-year NBA career.\n\nA guy whose net worth is estimated to be around $400 million is known to be generous. On Sunday, he paid a $25,000 tab for an entire restaurant full of customers in Chelsea, N.Y. So, if you see him walk into a Whataburger, hold off on handing the cashier that credit card.\n\nWill we be seeing Shaq pushing a cart at the local H-E-B?\n\nProbably not. O’Neal is still involved in basketball, as an analyst on Inside the NBA on TNT.\n\nGideo told The Dallas Morning News that O’Neal did not share a specific reason for buying in the area but said that the expansion of his Big Chicken restaurant chain to Texas was a factor.\n\n“It has a lot to do with that, and basic travel—he travels here quite a bit for different things,” Gideo said."
