He will serve as a great partner ensuring everyone knows all about our one-of-a-kind brand of fun,\" said Duffy. \"We're confident that his embodiment of our brand values will inspire America to Choose Fun and discover the authentic, participatory and social atmosphere that Carnival offers.\"\n\n\"In today's world, it's more important than ever to choose fun, especially when everyone is busy with work, family, and life in general,\" says O'Neal. \"So, I'm honored to be appointed the Chief Fun Officer at Carnival – a company that lives and breathes fun.\"\n\nCarnival Cruise Line is the largest brand in the Carnival Corporation portfolio with a fleet of 25 ships designed to deliver fun and memorable vacation experiences at a great value.
