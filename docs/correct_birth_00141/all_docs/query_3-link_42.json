        "text": "His Journey in Basketball Career\n\nShaquille was named the NBA Rookie of the Year in 1992–93. He played for the Orlando Magic and led them to a 41–41 record, which was 20 wins better than the previous season. Two years later, he won the scoring title and took Orlando to the finals against the Houston Rockets. However, the Rockets swept the Magic, and he gained a reputation for losing big games.\n\nShaquille was known for his immense size and strength, standing at 7 feet 1 inch tall and weighing 315 pounds. This made him nearly unstoppable on offense. However, he struggled as a free-throw shooter, and opponents would intentionally foul him, a strategy known as “Hack-a-Shaq,” because they knew he was more likely to miss free throws than score a field goal.\n\nIn 1996, O’Neal won a gold medal as a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team. That same year, he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, where he played alongside Kobe Bryant, who was becoming a superstar. Although he continued to dominate on offense, his teams often underperformed in the playoffs.\n\nEverything changed in 1999–2000 when Phil Jackson became the Lakers’ coach. Under Jackson’s guidance, Shaquille became more of a team player, focusing on defense, rebounding, and free-throw shooting. This shift in approach led the Lakers to championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003, with him being named the finals MVP each year.\n\nIn 2004, due to ongoing feuds with Kobe Bryant that were causing distractions within the Lakers organization, O’Neal was traded to the Miami Heat. There, he teamed up with the talented young guard Dwyane Wade and led Miami to an NBA championship in 2006. Unfortunately, injuries limited Shaq’s performance in the following seasons, and he was subsequently traded to the Phoenix Suns in 2008.\n\nHis playing style didn’t mesh well with the Suns’ up-tempo game, and despite a solid 2008–09 season, he was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2009 as the Suns embarked on a rebuilding process. He also had a brief stint with the Boston Celtics in 2010, but an Achilles tendon injury hampered his play. He retired after the 2010–11 season."
