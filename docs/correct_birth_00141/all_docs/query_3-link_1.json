        "text": "NBA\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nGreat Moments in Sports Quiz\n\nNamed NBA Rookie of the Year in 1992–93, O’Neal led the Magic to a 41–41 record, 20 wins better than the previous season. Two years later he won the scoring title and led Orlando to the finals against the Houston Rockets. After Houston’s sweep of the Magic, O’Neal developed a reputation for losing big games. O’Neal’s great size and strength—he stood 7 feet 1 inch (2.16 meters) tall and weighed 315 pounds (143 kg)—made him virtually impossible to stop on the offensive end of the court. He was, however, a poor free-throw shooter, and opponents adopted a strategy (known as “Hack-a-Shaq”) of intentionally fouling him, knowing that he was less likely to make free throws than to score a field goal.\n\nO’Neal was a member of the U.S. Olympic basketball team that won the gold medal in 1996, the same year he joined the Los Angeles Lakers, where he teamed with blossoming superstar Kobe Bryant. Although O’Neal continued to dominate on offense, his teams continued to disappoint in the play-offs. That changed in 1999–2000, when, under new Lakers coach Phil Jackson, he became the league’s Most Valuable Player (MVP). At Jackson’s urging, O’Neal became more of a team player, paying special attention to his defense, rebounding, and free-throw shooting. As a result, he led the Lakers to championships in 2001, 2002, and 2003, capturing the finals MVP award each year."
