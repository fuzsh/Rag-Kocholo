        "text": "I truly believe this person is a hero. My hero is a basketball player named Shaquille O'Neal. The reason why is he's a very strong and tall basketball player. He also played for many teams in the NBA. The last reason why is because he is a fantastic Center in basketball.\n\nFirst, my hero was born 1972 March 6th in Newark, New Jersey. He has five kids he had his first daughter in 1996 July 18th and named her Taahirah. Then had his first son in Jan. 11 2000. Then the last three were Amirah O'Neal born 2002, Shaquir O'Neal born April 19 2003 and last had a girl named Me'Argh born May 1 2006. Shaquille was married to a woman named Va'Shaundya Shaunie Nelson. The first life event was that he went to Robert G. Cole High School and then went to LSU. Second, he started his NBA career in 1992 and ended in 2011. The last event was he first started to play in the Orlando Magics. Second, he had some hardships. One of the hardships he faced was that he filed a divorce from Shaunie for half a month, but they fixed things and the got back together again. Then later on Shaunie filed an intent to divorce in 2010.\n\nNext, some of Shaquille O'Neal's incredible accomplishments were. Before the season began the Magic traded him to the Lakers. He was so powerful at dunks; he was traded again and went to the Miami Heat. The Phoenix Suns saw how determined he played, so they traded someone for him in the year 2008. The Cavaliers were amazed of his three-point shots that they traded one of the players for O'Neal. Then the last time he was traded again to Boston Celtics in 2010 and retired in 2011. He got so many awards; he got 1 MVP award, 3 All Star MVP awards, 3 Finals MVP awards and last he got an NBA MVP award.\n\nFinally, why I admire him is because I love basketball. His accomplishments encourage me to play. Lastly he is the best Center in the LA Lakers. What I learned from him is if I practice enough I'll become as good as him. I admire my hero Shaquille O'Neal."
