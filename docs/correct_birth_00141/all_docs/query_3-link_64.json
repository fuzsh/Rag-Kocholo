        "text": "LockerRoom Team\n\nHave you ever wondered how tall Shaq is or what the height of Shaq is? Well, the man himself has revealed it once.\n\nThere is a misconception that Shaquille O’Neal is more than 7 feet tall. However, during one of his past interviews, Shaq himself revealed that Shaq is 6’11’’ tall.\n\nHere is what Shaq said: “First of all, I’m not 7’1″. I’m 6’11”. I just played like I was 7’1″. And 7 foot 1 just sounded, you know, just so, you know,” he said.\n\nWho is Shaquille O’Neal?\n\nShaquille O'Neal, commonly known as Shaq, is a legendary figure in the world of basketball.\n\nBorn on March 6, 1972, in Newark, New Jersey, he quickly rose to fame and became one of the most recognizable athletes in the world.\n\nShaq's impact on the game extended far beyond his sheer physical presence. With his combination of size, strength, and agility, he revolutionized the center position. His ability to overpower opponents in the paint and score with thunderous dunks earned him the reputation as one of the most unstoppable forces in basketball history.\n\nThroughout his 19-year NBA career, Shaq played for several teams, including the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. He won four NBA championships, three with the Lakers and one with the Heat, and was named the Finals MVP three times.\n\nOff the court, Shaq's larger-than-life personality made him a beloved figure in popular culture. He showcased his charisma through various ventures, including music, acting, and even law enforcement. Shaq's sense of humor and infectious smile endeared him to fans worldwide, making him an icon beyond the realm of sports.\n\nShaq with UFC and MMA\n\nIn 2000, Shaquille O'Neal embarked on a journey into the world of mixed martial arts (MMA). Seeking to broaden his combat skills, he trained under the guidance of Jonathan Burke at Gracie Gym, where he honed his abilities in boxing, jiu-jitsu, Muay Thai, and wrestling. During this time, he adopted the moniker \"Diesel\" while training at the gym.\n\nDisplaying his interest in MMA, O'Neal publicly issued a challenge to Choi Hong-man, a prominent kickboxer and mixed martial artist. The challenge came in the form of a YouTube video posted on June 17, 2009, where O'Neal expressed his desire for a bout under mixed martial arts rules. Intrigued by the proposition, Choi responded positively, stating that he would be open to the fight if given the opportunity. When asked about O'Neal's chances of winning, Choi curtly replied with a resolute \"No.\"\n\nKeeping his aspirations alive, O'Neal reaffirmed his determination to face Choi during an interview at UFC 118 in Boston on August 28, 2010. His enthusiasm for stepping into the MMA arena remained unwavering, showcasing his eagerness to test his skills against formidable opponents like Choi Hong-man.\n\nALSO READ | Khabib Nurmagomedov reacts to the retirement of Zlatan Ibrahimovic\n\nWhat do you think of Shaq and his height?
