        "text": "So far for my essay research I have looked at different film posters from the 1920’s to the 2000’s to look at the development and whether or not the posters were designed better back in the 1920’s or whether they are designed better now.\n\nAll of this research and images are from :\n\nhttp://www.creativeoverflow.net/the-90-year-evolution-of-movie-posters/\n\nThese two posters are from the 1920’sand movies from that date were known to use ‘traditional type for the time and hand-drawn illustrations over stills that depicted scenes from the movie’\n\nThese film posters are from the 1930’s and in this time designers moved towards bolder typographic designs and designing the illustrations to be focusing on main characters of the film, mainly their faces over images of scenes.\n\nI think that by looking at the 1920 posters and these posters from the 1930’s you can see that the designers are starting to use the bigger and bolder type more than the images.\n\nComing into the 1940’s the designers very rarely used scene depictions on the posters and moved more towards the character illustrations that we started to see in the 1930’s.\n\n‘In the 1950’s we start to see poster designers trying conceptual posters in their work’.\n\nIn my opinion looking at these film posters above they start to use typography a lot more than an image.\n\nThese two posters are from the 1960’s and they do still use some illustrations in the designs but the type starts to play a more important role in the layouts. ‘The illustrations move to a more peripheral role, adorning the type’.\n\nIn these 1970’s poster designs photographs start to play a big role for the first time, often taking up much of the poster with type added below.\n\nIn my opinion this is when the posters start to become more like they are today with all of the type at the bottom with a photograph taking up most of the space as this is what describes the film most. People will also look more at the image than the text as this is what catches their eye as they walk past it or see it in the distance.\n\nThe 80’s is where we start to see the film posters start to look like what they do today. They started to use large photographic backgrounds but the type and imagery was still balanced out, more than what we have ever see in previous years.\n\nI think that the 80’s was when everything started to balance out and make sense, using both imagery and type.\n\nThese two posters are from the 1990’s and are two very well known films. They are very formulaic by using the photographic backgrounds, slogans at the top and the names of the headline actors sitting quietly above the name of the film usually near the bottom of the poster.\n\nI think that here in the 1990’s they have decided for definite that using photographs is a lot better than illustrations and they have also decided on a definite form for the film poster.\n\nThese two posters are from the 2000’s and ‘through the 80’s and 90’s we see evolution of movie posters slow down as designers hit on a series of winning layouts’.\n\nThe 2000’s wasn’t really about the designing, I think that it is now more about keeping up with trends in typography and photography while the layout will mainly always keep to the same.\n\nOverall I think that as the technology has developed so has film and everything that is included within that area of graphic design."
