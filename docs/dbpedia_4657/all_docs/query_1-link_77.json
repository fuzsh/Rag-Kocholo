        "text": "Praise be to Allah.\n\nIt is well-known that Allah, may He be glorified, is the only One Who is able to give life to the dead. He, may He be exalted, says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n“Or have they taken (for worship) Awliya’ (guardians, supporters, helpers, protectors, etc.) besides Him? But Allah, He Alone is the Walee (Protector, etc.). And it is He Who gives life to the dead, and He is Able to do all things”\n\n[ash-Shoora 42:9]\n\n“and then Allah will bring forth (resurrect) the creation of the Hereafter (i.e. resurrection after death). Verily, Allah is Able to do all things”\n\n[al-‘Ankaboot 29:20]\n\n“And he puts forth for Us a parable, and forgets his own creation. He says: ‘Who will give life to these bones when they have rotted away and became dust?’\n\nSay: (O Muhammad (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)) ‘He will give life to them Who created them for the first time! And He is the All-Knower of every creation!’”\n\n[Yaa-Seen 36:78, 79]\n\n“And that upon Him (Allah) is another bringing forth (Resurrection).”\n\n[an-Najm 53:47].\n\nSo whoever claims that anyone other than Allah, may He be exalted, is able to give life to the dead has associated someone else with Allah and has disbelieved in Him.\n\nIt is not permissible to play these games that contain such false beliefs, and playing them is undoubtedly haraam. We have previously explained that whatever contains haraam actions, it is haraam to watch it.\n\nSee fatwa no. 192671.\n\nBut if a person is free of belief in whatever it contains of shirk, and his heart is at ease with belief in the Oneness of Allah and that He is the only One Who could do that, then he is not a mushrik; rather he is committing a haraam deed.\n\nWe have previously explained that the fact that a game contains elements of shirk does not necessarily mean that the one who plays the game is a disbeliever, so long as he does not believe in these false beliefs, even though that means that it is haraam to play or watch the game.\n\nSee fatwa no. 201005.\n\nAnd Allah knows best."
