The project was paused to film and produce Enter the Dragon. For The Game of Death, over 120 minutes of footage was shot,[2] which was later misplaced in the Golden Harvest archives.[citation needed] The remaining footage has since been released with Lee's original Cantonese and English dialogue, with John Little dubbing Lee's Hai Tien character as part of the documentary titled Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey. Much of the footage that was shot is from what was to be the climax of the film.\n\nDuring filming, Lee received an offer to star in Enter the Dragon, the first kung fu film to be produced by a Hollywood studio (Warner Bros.), and with a budget unprecedented for the genre ($850,000). Lee died of cerebral edema before the film's release. At the time of his death, he had made plans to resume the filming of The Game of Death. After Lee's death, Enter the Dragon director Robert Clouse was enlisted to finish the film using two stand-ins; it was released in 1978 as Game of Death, five years after Lee's death, by Golden Harvest.\n\nThe story of Lee's original 1972 film involves Lee's character, in order to save his younger sister and brother, joining a group of martial artists who are hired to retrieve a stolen Chinese national treasure[need quotation to verify] from the top floor of a five-story pagoda in South Korea, with each floor guarded by martial artists who must be defeated while ascending the tower.[3][additional citation(s) needed] The 1978 film's plot was altered to a revenge story, where the mafia attempts to kill Lee's character, who fakes his death and seeks vengeance against those who tried to kill him. The final part of the film uses some of Lee's original film footage, but with the pagoda setting changed to a restaurant building, where he fights martial artists hired by the mafia in an attempt to rescue his fiancée Ann Morris (played by Colleen Camp). This revised version received a mixed critical reception but was commercially successful, grossing an estimated US$50,000,000 (equivalent to $230,000,000 in 2023) worldwide.\n\nIt was an influential film that had a significant cultural impact. The original version's concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous action films and video games. The film is also known for Lee's iconic yellow-and-black jumpsuit as well as his fight scene with NBA player and student Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, both of which have been referenced in numerous media.\n\nOriginal film\n\n[edit]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original plot involves Lee playing the role of Hai Tien (海天), a retired champion martial artist who is confronted by Korean underworld gangs. They tell him the story of a pagoda where guns are prohibited. The pagoda is under heavy guard by highly skilled martial artists; they are protecting a stolen Chinese national treasure (which is not identified at all in any surviving material) held on its top level.\n\nThe gang boss wants Hai to be a part of a group of martial artists he assembled, to help retrieve said item by fighting the guardians. This is the boss's second team he's sending; the first team he sent was nearly wiped out. They force the reluctant Hai to participate by abducting his two younger siblings. Along with four other martial artists (two played by James Tien and Chieh Yuan), Hai battles his way up a five-level pagoda. The team encounters a different, and stronger, challenge on each floor.\n\nAs originally scripted by Lee, Hai and company enter the temple grounds, where at the pagoda's base, they fight 10 Karate black belts. Inside the pagoda, Hai's team encounters a different opponent on each floor, each one more formidable than the last. The other fighters assisting Hai are handily defeated by the pagoda guardians, as they're not as skilled as Hai; the guardian in turn must be defeated by Hai.\n\nAt the pagoda raid, Hai's group was to fight 25 floor guardians:\n\nBolo Yeung (sensei), Lam Ching-ying, Yuen Wah, Unicorn Chan, Bee Chan, Wu Ngan, and 14 others as The Twenty Black-Belt Karate Fighters – Ground Floor Guardians (has never been filmed)\n\nHwang In-shik as Korean Hapkido Master #1 – 1st Floor Guardian, (only Ground Floor footage)\n\nTaky Kimura as Praying Mantis-style Shih-fu – 2nd Floor Guardian\" (also has never been filmed)\n\nDan Inosanto as Eskrima Filipina – 3rd Floor Guardian\n\nJi Han-jae as Korean Hapkido Master #2 – 4th Floor Guardian\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar as Mantis – 5th Floor Guardian\n\nHai would defeat all 25 formidable masters after his follow raiders were taken down by each master of the floor, the last one being James Tien's character. He's beaten by the final guardian (Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), a giant fighter who fights with a free and fluid fighting style similar to Hai's Jeet Kune Do. Because of the guardian's great size and strength, in addition to his potent martial artistry, he can only be defeated when Hai recognizes and exploits his greatest weakness: an unusually high sensitivity to light.[4]\n\nImmediately after defeating the giant guardian, Hai turns around and descends the staircase...heading out of the pagoda. Despite all the talk of something awaiting up top of the (now unguarded) flight of stairs, there is no mention of anyone going up to retrieve it. No surviving material explains how this affects Hai or his captive siblings.[5]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nAlthough the pagoda was supposed to have five floors, complete scenes were only shot for three of the floors: the \"Temple of the Tiger\", where Lee faced Inosanto; the \"Temple of the Dragon\", where he fought Ji Han-jae; and the final floor, known as the \"Temple of the Unknown\", where he fought Abdul-Jabbar. Hapkido master Hwang In-shik was slated to play the guardian of the first floor, a master of a kick-oriented style, while Bruce's long-time student and good friend Taky Kimura was asked to play the guardian of the second floor, a stylist of praying mantis kung fu.[4]\n\nThe goal of the film's plot was to showcase Lee's beliefs regarding the principles of martial arts. As each martial artist is defeated (including Lee's allies), the flaws in their fighting style are revealed. Some, like Dan Inosanto's character, rely too much on fixed patterns of offensive and defensive techniques, while others lack economy of motion. Lee defeats his opponents by having a fighting style that involves fluid movement, unpredictability, and an eclectic blend of techniques. His dialogue often includes comments on their weaknesses.[5][4]\n\nBruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey\n\n[edit]\n\nSeveral years later, Bruce Lee historian John Little released Bruce Lee: A Warrior's Journey, a documentary revealing the original footage and storyline of The Game of Death. The documentary also includes a fairly in-depth biography of Lee and leads into the filming of The Game of Death. Originally meant to be a documentary in its own right, it can now be found on the second disc of the 2004 Special Edition DVD release of Enter the Dragon, along with the documentary Bruce Lee: The Curse of the Dragon.\n\nBruce Lee in G.O.D: Shibōteki Yūgi\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2000, the Japanese film Bruce Lee in G.O.D 死亡的遊戯 was released on DVD. This film shows Lee's original vision of the film through the existing footage that was shot for the film before he died, interviews, and historical re-enactments of what went on behind the scenes. A \"special edition\" DVD was released in 2003.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nFilmed cast\n\n[edit]\n\nBruce Lee as \"Hai Tien\" (also called \"the Yellow-Faced Tiger\")\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar as \"Mantis, the 5th Floor Guardian\"\n\nJames Tien as \"Tien Da, the Second Fighter\"\n\nChieh Yuan as \"Chieh, the Third Fighter\" (doubled by Hwang In-shik)\n\nDan Inosanto as \"Eskrima Filipina, the 3rd Floor Guardian\"\n\nJi Han-jae as \"Hapkido Master, the 4th Floor Guardian\"\n\nHwang In-shik as \"1st Floor Guardian\" (only Ground Floor footage)\n\nLee Kwan as \"Mr. Kuan the Locksmith\" (voice is heard at film's end)\n\nUnfilmed cast\n\n[edit]\n\nTaky Kimura as \"2nd Floor Guardian\"\n\nRobert Wall as \"Mr. Wall, the American Fighter and Hai Tien's ally\"\n\nGeorge Lazenby as \"Hai Tien's master\"\n\nNora Miao as \"Hai Tien's sister\"\n\nUncast Child Actor as \"Hai Tien's brother\"\n\nCarter Wong as \"Mr. Wong\"\n\nShih Kien as \"Crime Lord\"\n\nTony Liu as \"Huang\"\n\nWan Kam-leung as \"Lee Guo-hao, the Fifth Fighter\"\n\nBetty Ting Pei as \"Hai Tien's wife\"\n\nBolo Yeung as \"Black Belt Karate Leader – Ground Floor\"\n\nLam Ching-ying, Yuen Wah, Unicorn Chan, Bee Chan, Wu Ngan, and 14 others as \"Black Belt Karate Fighters – Ground Floor\"\n\nHan Ying-chieh as \"Thug 1\"\n\nYuen Biao as \"Thug 2\"\n\nAlan Chui Chung-San as \"Thug 3\"\n\nCorey Yuen as \"Thug 4\"\n\nJackie Chan as \"Fan who asks for Hai Tien's autograph\"\n\nIntended cast\n\n[edit]\n\nWong Shun-leung was originally approached to play the role of the Wing Chun-oriented 2nd Floor Guardian, but he declined, and was replaced by Taky Kimura.\n\nRobert Baker, student of Lee's, was considered for the role eventually given to Robert Wall.[6][7]\n\nSammo Hung had been cast as the Third Fighter, but by the time Lee was ready to film with him, Hung had moved on to another project; Chieh Yuan took the part in his stead.\n\nGame of Death (1978 film)\n\n[edit]\n\n1978 Hong Kong film\n\nGame of DeathChinese nameTraditional Chinese死亡遊戲Simplified Chinese死亡游戏\n\nTranscriptionsStandard MandarinHanyu PinyinSǐwáng YóuxìIPA[sɹ̩̀wǎŋ jǒʊɕî]Yue: CantoneseJyutpingSei5 Mong4 Jau4 Hei3IPACantonese pronunciation: [se̬imɔ̏ːŋ jɐ̏uhēi]\n\nDirected byRobert Clouse\n\nBruce Lee (G.O.D. footage)\n\n(action)\n\nSammo Hung (action)Written byJan Spears (Clouse/Chow)\n\nBruce Lee (HK Version Opening Credit)Produced byRaymond ChowStarringBruce Lee\n\nGig Young\n\nDean Jagger\n\nColleen Camp\n\nKim Tai-jong\n\nYuen Biao\n\nRobert Wall\n\nHugh O'Brian\n\nDan Inosanto\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar\n\nMel Novak\n\nSammo Hung\n\nJi Han-jae\n\nCasanova WongCinematographyHo Lan-shan\n\nGodfrey A.

The film stars Bruce Lee, with Kim Tai-jong and Yuen Biao as his stunt doubles, along with Gig Young, Dean Jagger, Colleen Camp, Robert Wall, Hugh O'Brian, Dan Inosanto, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Mel Novak, Sammo Hung, Ji Han-jae and Casanova Wong.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe 1978 version uses portions of the original footage married to an entirely new plot involving a new character, Billy Lo (盧比利), struggling against a racketeering \"syndicate\" after gaining international success as a martial arts movie star. When Billy refuses to be intimidated by syndicate henchman Steiner and his gangs of thugs, syndicate owner Dr. Land orders his assassination to serve as an example to others.\n\nDisguised as a stuntman, Land's assassin, Stick (Mel Novak), sneaks onto the set of Billy's new film, and shoots Billy during filming. A fragment of the bullet passes through Billy's face, leaving him alive but in need of plastic surgery which alters his facial features. Billy takes the opportunity to fake his death and disguise himself, exacting revenge against those who wronged him one at a time. When the syndicate threatens and kidnaps his fiancée, Ann Morris (Colleen Camp), Billy is forced to come out of hiding to save her.\n\nIn the revised but chopped footage, Bruce Lee's fight scenes inside the pagoda are assumed to take place in the upper floors of the Red Pepper restaurant:\n\nDan Inosanto as Pasqual – Middle Floor Guardian\n\nJi Han-jae as Restaurant Fighter – Quarter Floor Guardian\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar as Hakim – Top Floor Guardian\n\nHugh O'Brian as Steiner – Lead Guardian\n\nDr. Land (Dean Jagger) and his thugs have laid an ambush, but in the end, Billy survives the ambush, rescues Ann, and destroys each of the main mobsters one-by-one.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nBruce Lee as \"Billy Lo\" (archive footage from incomplete first version)\n\nKim Tai-jong as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee)\n\nYuen Biao as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee in acrobatics)[a]\n\nAlbert Sham as \"Billy Lo\" (doubling for Bruce Lee)\n\nChris Kent as the English voice of \"Billy Lo\" (dubbing for Bruce Lee)\n\nBruce Lee's actual battle cries are used in the Cantonese, Mandarin and Japanese versions instead of Chris Kent's battle cry voice.\n\nGig Young as \"Jim Marshall\"\n\nDean Jagger as \"Dr. Land\"\n\nColleen Camp as \"Ann Morris\"\n\nHugh O'Brian as \"Steiner\"\n\nRobert Wall as \"Carl Miller\"\n\nDan Inosanto as \"Pasqual\"\n\nJi Han-jae as \"Restaurant Fighter\"\n\nKareem Abdul-Jabbar as \"Hakim\"\n\nMel Novak as \"Stick\"\n\nSammo Hung as \"Lo Chen\"\n\nJames Tien as \"Charlie Wang\" (US version) / \"Fong Chun\" (HK version)\n\nRoy Chiao as \"(Uncle) Henry Lo\" (US version only)\n\nCasanova Wong as \"Lau Yea-chun\" (HK version only)\n\nChuck Norris as \"Fighter in Film\" (archive footage)\n\nChui Chung-san (Assistant stunt double, also One of Dr. Land's Guard)\n\nTony Leung\n\nBilly McGill\n\nJim James\n\nRussell Cawthorne\n\nLam Ching-ying\n\nJohn Ladalski\n\nDavid Hu\n\nDon Barry\n\nJess Hardie\n\nEddie Dye\n\nPeter Nelson\n\nPeter Gee\n\nPeter Chan\n\nMars as one of Dr. Land's guards (extra)\n\nLau Kar-wing\n\nFung Hak-On as Thug Wearing The Yellow Suit Fighting in Henry Lo's Opera Place (US version only)\n\nTai San\n\nJason Williams\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe revised version of the film uses only 12 minutes and 41 seconds of the footage from the original The Game of Death, and for the vast majority of the film, the role of Billy Lo was shared by Korean taekwondo master Kim Tai-jong and Hong Kong martial arts actor Yuen Biao, and was voiced by Chris Kent. The plot of the film allowed Kim and Yuen to spend much of the film in disguises, usually involving false beards and large, dark sunglasses that obscured the fact that they bore little resemblance to Lee. Many scenes, including fight scenes, also included brief close-up bits of stock footage of the real Bruce Lee from his pre-Enter the Dragon films, often only lasting a second or two. These clips are easily recognisable due to the difference in film quality between the old and new footage. At one point in the movie, real footage of Lee's corpse in his open-topped casket is used to show the character Billy Lo faking his death. There is even a scene, taken place in Billy's dressing room, where a cut-out of Lee's face was taped to a mirror, covering the stand-in's own face.\n\nSeveral actors associated with previous Lee movies were included in the re-shoot for the final 1978 film. For example, Robert Wall, a villain in both Way of the Dragon and Enter the Dragon, plays a kickboxer named Carl Miller who must battle with Billy Lo. Sammo Hung, who appeared in Enter the Dragon, served as the fight coordinator for the film, and also appears in the scene as ring opponent Lo Chen for Miller. To maintain continuity with the fight footage taken from the original film, Dan Inosanto (renamed Pasqual) and Ji Han-jae (whose character was unnamed and was not shown until near the end of the film) were given small parts as additional enforcers for the syndicate. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar refused to participate in the re-shoot, with another tall African-American stand-in (renamed Hakim) included instead. Although Chuck Norris is credited as starring in the film, his role is limited to clips from Way of the Dragon inserted into the film.[citation needed]\n\nThe film quality of the Clouse-directed footage is noticeably higher than that of Lee's earlier Hong Kong films, and John Barry provided an original soundtrack. The film also featured performances by experienced actors as well as up-and-coming stars, including two recipients of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor (Dean Jagger and Gig Young) and several who have been honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, including Bruce Lee himself, Jagger, Young (in his final film), Chuck Norris, and Hugh O'Brian.[citation needed]\n\nFor Chinese-speaking audiences, the film was dubbed into Cantonese and Mandarin, and had significant changes, such as the inclusion of a fight in a greenhouse with Casanova Wong and a different opening and closing credits sequence, featuring a new theme song, plus a couple of minor scenes. Unlike the English version, these versions use Lee's actual battle sounds. Several scenes were removed as well, including the fight in the opera house dressing room.[citation needed]\n\nIn the original Hong Kong version, the fight with Ji Han-jae is included (although it occurs in the middle of the film), while the ending does not show Billy Lo being arrested. Instead, both he and Ann share their good-byes to Jim as they appear to depart Hong Kong on a boat. The Singaporean version ends with Billy's arrest, and it does not feature the Ji Han-jae fight. This is the version commonly found in Chinese.[citation needed]\n\nThe Mandarin-dubbed version of the film features a different theme song from that of the Cantonese version. The theme song sounds similar to the main theme of Way of the Dragon. This version also includes the scene where Billy and Ann share their good-byes to Jim. The Cantonese-dubbed version shows the commonly found scene where Billy is arrested by the police.[citation needed]\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nThe American score was composed by John Barry. The vocal theme song \"Will This Be The Song I'll Be Singing Tomorrow?\" was sung by Colleen Camp.[8]\n\nTheme song\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Game of Death\" (死亡遊戲)\n\nLyrics: James Wong\n\nComposition and Arrangement: Joseph Koo\n\nPerformance: Roman Tam\n\nRelease\n\n[edit]\n\nGame of Death was released in Hong Kong on 23 March 1978. In the United States, the film was released by Columbia Pictures on 9 June 1979. The film was released in the Philippines by Asia Films on 15 December 1988.[9]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nThe film was successful at the box office in Hong Kong (23 March 1978 release), grossing HK$3,436,169.[10] Within three weeks of its release (by 13 April 1978), the film grossed nearly US$8 million in the Far East.[11] In Japan (14 April 1978 release), it became the eighth highest-grossing film of 1978 with distributor rental earnings of ¥1.45 billion,[12] equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately ¥3.52 billion[13] (US$16.7 million).[14] In South Korea (May 1978 release), it sold 281,591 tickets in the capital city of Seoul,[15] equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately ₩337,909,200[16] (US$698,160).[17]\n\nIn the United States (1979 release), the film earned millions of United States dollars in its first few weeks,[18] and went on to earn about US$5 million in theatrical rentals,[19] equivalent to estimated box office gross receipts of approximately US$13 million.[20] In France, it was the 14th highest-grossing film of 1978 with 2,256,892 ticket sales,[21] equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately €6,093,608[22] (US$8,264,929).[23] In Germany, the film sold 750,513 tickets (575,000 tickets in 1978[24] and 175,513 tickets in 1981),[25] equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately €1,876,283[22] (US$2,544,854).[26] In Spain, the film sold 1,112,793 tickets,[27] equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately €1,446,631[22] (US$1,962,106).[28]\n\nCombined, the film grossed a total estimated worldwide box office revenue of approximately US$50,320,736 (equivalent to $240,000,000 in 2023)\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThis version of the film received a mixed critical reception, holding a 46% Rotten Tomatoes score.[29] Criticism of the revised version included the inclusion of scenes that could be considered in bad taste, such as the incorporation of footage of Lee's actual funeral. Another scene, often pointed out by critics of the film, involved a shot of Kim looking at himself in the mirror, with an obvious cardboard cut-out of Lee's face pasted onto the mirror's surface.[30]\n\nUpon its North American release, Cecilia Blanchfield in The Calgary Herald rated it three stars, praising the climactic fight scenes as \"Bruce Lee at his best\" while criticizing the \"abysmal\" writing and \"clumsily executed\" production up until then, calling the film a \"poor tribute to a remarkably talented man.\"[31]\n\nBey Logan points out a few logic issues with the 1978 film. In order for the henchmen to remain low key, they should be wearing more casual clothes instead of the multicolored tracksuits seen at various parts of the film. But as a rationale, this explains why Lee wears the yellow tracksuit. Also, during the fight between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the scene near the vase in Logan's opinion appears to look choppy, along with the short fight with Hugh O'Brian. In the first half of the English version, during the fight sequences, Lee is seen to be beaten down instead of making short work of the henchmen.\n\nGame of Death could be considered more accessible to Western audiences than Lee's previous films. Compared to other Bruce Lee films like The Big Boss, Fist of Fury and Way of the Dragon, Game of Death has more Western characters and the story structure is more straightforward and less culturally specific to Asia.[32][33]\n\nGame of Death Redux (2019)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 19 July 2019, timed with the 46th death anniversary of Bruce Lee, producer Alan Canvan premiered a newly edited version of Lee's Game of Death at the Asian American/Asian Research Institute in New York City, with biographer Matthew Polly joining Canvan in discussing the film and answering audience questions.[34] The Redux edit only uses footage shot during the original production, while combining the score composed by John Barry for the 1978 version.[34] It also restores dialogues that were missing in the 1978 version of Game of Death.[35]\n\nThe film was released as a special feature (standard definition) in The Criterion Collection's Blu-ray box set of Bruce Lee films on 14 July 2020.[36]\n\nThe Final Game of Death (2023)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 July 2023, Arrow Films released a 4K UHD/Blu-ray box set covering Bruce Lee's films at Golden Harvest.[37] Included in the set is a 223-minute documentary on the production of Game of Death.[38] The documentary includes all two hours of footage shot for the project by Lee before his death, restored from an interpositive.[39] The documentary also includes an assembly of the footage, alongside a newly filmed introduction to cover the plot elements that were never shot.[40]\n\nLegacy\n\n[edit]\n\nOther Game of Death films\n\n[edit]\n\nAfter the death of Bruce Lee, several studios exploited the situation by making their own versions of Game of Death based on what they had learned of the story from production stills and magazine articles. Some of these films pre-dated Robert Clouse's official Game of Death (1978).\n\nThe Game of Death! (1974)\n\nGoodbye Bruce Lee: His Last Game of Death (1975)\n\nEnter the Game of Death (1978)\n\nThe True Game of Death (1979)\n\nGame of Death II (Tower of Death) (1981)\n\nClouse's film had a sequel in 1981, Game of Death II, a kung fu action mystery film directed by Ng See-yuen which used cut footage from Lee's Enter the Dragon to have him make an appearance in the beginning of the film, only to be killed off midway, allowing his on-screen brother to take on the role of protagonist. Aside from the international English dub giving the \"Bruce Lee\" character the name Billy Lo, this movie appears to have no connection with Clouse's film.\n\nWong Jing's film City Hunter has a similar premise for a scene. Jackie Chan as Ryu Saeba takes on two tall black men, and the film uses clips of Lee's fight scene against Kareem Abdul-Jabbar to get the better of the two.\n\nInfluence\n\n[edit]\n\nThe original film's concept of ascending a tower while defeating enemies on each level was highly influential, inspiring numerous action films and video games.[3]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nItalian film scholars Simone Bedetti and Lorenzo De Luca identified Game of Death as an early example of what they call the \"arcade movie\" genre of action films. These \"arcade movies\" have three characteristic elements: the achievement of a goal, passing a series of levels, and ascending through a path (whether physical or symbolic). This is presented in Game of Death as Lee going up higher floors while facing increasingly dangerous opponents as he ascends the tower. Later examples of action films which Bedetti and De Luca identify as \"arcade movies\" include Bruce Lee's own Enter the Dragon, the Bruce Willis movie Die Hard (1988), Steven Spielberg's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), Paul W. S. Anderson's Mortal Kombat (1995), and the Jean-Claude Van Damme movie Sudden Death (1995).[41]\n\nThe Raid, a 2011 Indonesian film, was influenced by Game of Death. It has a similar plot structure, set in a single main location, a grungy high-rise building, with grunts at the bottom and the big boss at the top.[42][43] This Game of Death formula was also used in the film Dredd (2012) and appeared in an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants.[44]\n\nSeveral films pay homage to the fight scene between Bruce Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The scene is parodied in two Jackie Chan films, City Hunter (1993) where Chan fights two tall black men,[45] and Rush Hour 3 (2007) which reverses it by having a shorter African-American man Chris Tucker fight a taller Chinese basketballer Sun Mingming.[46] The Keanu Reeves film John Wick: Chapter 3 – Parabellum (2019) pays homage in a scene featuring NBA basketball player Boban Marjanović.[47] The French film La Tour Montparnasse Infernale (2001) parodies the scene when Ramzy Bedia fights with Bô Gaultier de Kermoal, wearing the same costumes as Lee and Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nWilliam Zabka referenced Game of Death during his audition for the role of Johnny Lawrence in The Karate Kid (1984), when the director John Avildsen asked him \"how old are you? You're a little bigger than our karate kid.\" Zabka responded, \"Bruce Lee was smaller than Kareem Abdul Jabbar, but he beat him\" in reference to Game of Death, to which Avlidsen responded \"Yeah, that's true.\" That convinced Avlidsen to cast Zabka for the role.[48]\n\nVideo games\n\n[edit]\n\nThe plot structure of Game of Death, where a series of martial arts opponents each have a weakness that must be discovered and exploited, established the \"end-of-level boss\" structure used by beat 'em up games for decades.[49][50] This structure first crossed over into video games with the 1984 arcade game Kung-Fu Master, which established the beat 'em up genre.[51][49] Kung Fu Master was initially released as Spartan X in Japan, as a tie-in for the 1984 Jackie Chan film Wheels on Meals (titled Spartan X in Japan), before an international release as Kung-Fu Master (sans Spartan X license).[51] Its boss battle gameplay also became the basis for fighting games such as Street Fighter (1987).[50] Kung-Fu Master also inspired Super Mario Bros. (1985),[52] the Red Ribbon Army saga (1985–1986) in the manga and anime series Dragon Ball,[53] and the French film Kung Fu Master (1988).[54]\n\nComics\n\n[edit]\n\nThe superhero Shang-Chi was created as a result of the kung-fu craze started by Bruce Lee in 1973, with artist Paul Gulacy using Lee as a visual inspiration for Shang-Chi. The \"Game of Rings\" storyline from the comic series Shang-Chi and the Ten Rings was inspired by Game of Death.\n\nYellow-and-black jumpsuit\n\n[edit]\n\nThe yellow-and-black jumpsuit which Lee wore in the film has come to be seen as something of a trademark for the actor, and is paid homage to in numerous other media. In the Clouse-directed remake, the filmmakers rationalised its presence by including a scene where Billy Lo disguises himself as one of Dr. Land's motorcycle-riding thugs, who all wear striped jumpsuits.\n\nIn the warehouse scene, Billy Lo wears a pair of yellow Adidas shoes with black stripes and white shelltoes. Towards the end of the film, Billy wears a pair of yellow Onitsuka Tiger shoes, with black stripes. This is because the real Bruce Lee wore the latter when he was filming, and the double wore the former in the 1978 version to resemble his shoes.\n\nIn the Lee-directed unfinished version, the jumpsuit should portray personal freedom in the art of combat, without being bounded to a certain fighting style. The cinematic explanation for its presence was the nickname of Hai Tien, Yellow-Faced Tiger, because his fighting outfit and shoes resemble the colours of a Tiger. Over the years, there were many speculations about the colour of the jumpsuit and its meaning. According to Andre Morgan from Golden Harvest, they had a yellow suit with black bars and a black suit with yellow bars. Lee first chose the black suit, but changed it to the yellow because Abdul-Jabbar's footprints were better visible on it.\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nUma Thurman wears a similar suit in Kill Bill: Volume 1 when she travels to Japan to take on an underworld boss and assassin played by Lucy Liu. In homage to both the film and the remake, Thurman wears a two-piece suit and the Onitsuka Tiger sneakers as part of her motorcycle-riding gear, and keeps the suit on during her battle with Liu and her gang, the Crazy 88.\n\nIn Shaolin Soccer, a similar suit is worn by the goalie \"Empty Hand\" (Danny Chan Kwok-kwan), who resembles Lee.\n\nIn the Jet Li film High Risk, Jacky Cheung plays an action film star who is losing his fighting ability due to his cowardice and drunkenness. When he regains his courage at the end of the film, he wears a copy of the yellow tracksuit. The role is generally felt to be a parody of Jackie Chan, but the references to Bruce Lee are also obvious.\n\nThe 1985 film The Last Dragon, produced by Motown founder Berry Gordy, centred around a Bruce Lee fan, portrayed by Taimak, in search of reaching martial arts enlightenment who instructed his students wearing the same tracksuit.\n\nIn Revenge of the Nerds, Brian Tochi's character, Toshiro Takashi, wears the yellow jumpsuit while riding a tricycle during the inter-Greek competitions.\n\nIn the live-action City Hunter film (directed by Wong Jing), the scene in which Jackie Chan dispatches his own taller opponents references Lee's fight with Abdul-Jabbar.\n\nIn Police Story 4: First Strike, Jackie Chan wears a similar suit that he gets from a wardrobe of an hotel room, claiming that he is a dry cleaner to the owner, with the same colors and the left and right black line.\n\nIn Finishing the Game, Breeze Loo, played by Roger Fan, wears a yellow and black striped jumpsuit.\n\nIn the 2011 British comedy film On the Ropes, writer and director Mark Noyce added a scene in homage to his idol Bruce Lee which featured Mick Western (played by Ben Shockley) wearing a yellow tracksuit.\n\nMusic\n\n[edit]\n\nA short promotional video for the virtual band Gorillaz showed the fictional animated guitarist Noodle taking on a pack of thugs while dressed in the tracksuit and imitating Lee's fighting style. Noodle also wore the suit in the Game of Death short clip from Phase One: Celebrity Take Down.\n\nThe band Sugar Ray, in their video for the single \"When It's Over\", included a segment in which one of its band members (Rodney Sheppard, Guitarist) fantasizes about having a kung fu battle similar to the fight scene between Lee and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The band member wears Lee's tracksuit, his opponent wears a beard, clothes and sunglasses similar to Abdul-Jabbar's, and the video duplicates the scene in which a seated Kareem kicks Lee in the chest, knocking him down and leaving a huge footprint on his chest.\n\nTopper Headon of The Clash was known to wear a similar jumpsuit at live shows; he is seen wearing in it the 1980 film Rude Boy.[citation needed]\n\nAvant-garde guitarist Buckethead released a cover of \"Game of Death\" in 2006.[55] He also wore a yellow tracksuit while playing live and performed with nunchakus on stage.\n\nAmerican band Far East Movement's song \"Satisfaction\"[56] featured the yellow jumpsuits in the song's music video; said song was the soundtrack to the 2007 mockumentary Finishing the Game.\n\nCanadian hard rock duo Indian Handcrafts' song \"Bruce Lee\" uses the film as lyrical inspiration, while the music video features the two band members performing an over-the-top fight scene, with guitarist Daniel Brandon Allen wearing the signature yellow jumpsuit.\n\nIn the music video for the Iggy Azalea song \"Black Widow\" (featuring Rita Ora), based on Kill Bill, Azalea wears a white & black tracksuit and Ora wears a black & red tracksuit.

Both Ataru's yellow tracksuit and the Mendou sister's nunchakus are a homage to Bruce Lee.[57][58]\n\nIn the anime/manga Tenjho Tenge, there is a short appearance of a character named \"Inosato Dan\" who is the leader of the \"Jun Fan Gung Fu club\" (Jun Fan is Bruce Lee's Chinese name). He resembles Bruce Lee very much, and wears the jumpsuit. However, in the anime the colors of the jumpsuit are switched to a black suit with yellow stripes.\n\nDuel No. 25 of the Yu-Gi-Oh! manga features some references to Bruce Lee.

The subsequent \"Death-T\" arc then follows a similar structure to the movie with Yugi fighting his way up to the top stage where he has a one on one bout with Seto Kaiba.\n\nThe second episode of the anime series Cowboy Bebop, \"Stray Dog Strut\", further pays homage with the episode's main antagonist being named Abdul Hakim (after Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's character) and bearing a strikingly similar appearance.\n\nThe character Mr. Tanaka from Sonic X wears the suit in an episode.\n\nThe character Sasshi from the anime Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi also gets a uniform called the Game of Death suit, later imitating Lee in both appearance and mannerisms.\n\nAnother reference is found in Great Teacher Onizuka in which the main character, Onizuka Eikichi, wears the same suits when performing feats of strength like breaking a baseball bat with a kick in front of his class.\n\nIn episode 18 of the anime Gintama, Kagura wears a suit similar to Bruce's suit in this movie.\n\nThe cover for the third volume of the American DVD release of the anime PaniPoni Dash! features the main character Rebecca Miyamoto wearing a track suit similar to Bruce Lee's.
