        "text": "It can be easy to take movie posters for granted. Often indistinguishable from other great works of printed art, it can be hard to remember they are ultimately pieces of advertising, designed to capture and sell to an audience. Perhaps no other form of advertising is more adored than key art; it sparks our imaginations as cinema-goers, adorns our walls, and distills the legacy of some of the greatest films into a single image.\n\nRecognizing this, in 1971 the Hollywood Reporter launched the Key Art Awards, an award show with the singular mission of recognizing the best key art of the year. Today, the same show is now the Clio Entertainment Awards, and its reach has expanded considerably beyond key art. Still, the mission is the same—to honor and celebrate the incredible entertainment marketing industry.\n\nTo help celebrate the 50th anniversary of the program, Clio Entertainment and Muse asked five luminaries in the industry—all of whom have won numerous Clio Entertainment statues—to craft a list of 50 movie posters that changed entertainment marketing. For months, the committee worked to curate a list spanning cinematic history, eventually selecting 50 pieces that they felt helped move the craft forward and inspired them in their own legendary careers.\n\nThe group emphasizes that this is by no means a comprehensive list; there are hundreds of other posters that could have made this list. But we are grateful for their selections and their thoughts, and we hope this list inspires more great work from the industry in future.\n\nBelow, meet the list’s curators. Or you can jump straight to the list itself.\n\nThe Committee\n\nMeet the curators of the list and learn how they approached this project:\n\nMolly Albright\n\nHead of Creative Marketing, Movies\n\nAmazon Studios\n\nAbout Molly: I started my career at a boutique creative agency (Michel/Russo) and got my chops working on both print and A/V campaigns for indie films. It’s where I truly fell in love with our business as well as the incredible pool of creative talent who streamed in and out of the office as freelancers. I was a sponge, took in everything there was to learn and I pinched myself daily to be so lucky. In 2000, I moved over to the “client” side and led the creative at places like IFC Films, Newmarket and Picturehouse, as well as having my own business consulting for various distributors while my children were younger. I joined Amazon Studios’ movies marketing org in 2015 and I’ve been there ever since, building a team of creative directors and leading the creative for 360 global campaigns for all movies on the slate. I have had the pleasure of working with some of the most inspirational creative folks in town, both on the filmmaking and the vendor side, and still continue to pinch myself daily.\n\nThoughts on the list: I am in awe of the incredible vision, craftsmanship and sheer brilliance of the creative geniuses behind the work in these pieces. I am inspired by how exciting and indelible the inspirational work in film marketing can be, almost museum-worthy but created for a business purpose, which taps into a cultural conversation and connects people with their emotions. Distilling a two-hour story into a static artistic image is no small feat, and when it becomes iconic, when it stands the test of time, then the film and the poster become one. I salute this incredible body of work, which is by no means an exhaustive list, and encourage everyone working in our industry today to never stop trying and never stop believing.\n\nSome posters from Molly’s career: Y Tu Mama Tambien, Pan’s Labyrinth, Borat Subsequent Movie Film.\n\nDawn Baillie\n\nCo-Founder and Creative Director\n\nBLT Communications\n\nAbout Dawn: When I was a kid, I loved and collected the covers of TV Guide. I loved to analyze every colored pencil stroke made by the likes of Richard Amsel. I looked at the direction of the strokes, how he blended his colors, how he broke his compositions into designs that ended in twirled strands of hair. With laser-beam focus, I set out to be part of this movie poster world. However, I had no idea how to get there. It is with absolute luck that Tony Seiniger let me in the building.\n\nThoughts on the list: This was a fun opportunity to think back on all the posters I pored over as a young designer/artist. I find an iconic conceptual poster to be such a gift to the world. It’s fascinating to think of the moments of epiphany when such great ideas come to mind, and how joyful I feel when those miracles happen for me. I tried to focus on iconic posters, and particularly on illustrated posters, in the hope of keeping the tradition alive for the new crop of designers. It is impossible to choose a favorite or to rank our collaborated list, as on any given day, my mind is delighted by yet another poster. I am so grateful to have had a career where I’ve been able to contribute to the culture. Thank you for including me in this project.\n\nSome posters from Dawn’s career: Dirty Dancing, The Silence of the Lambs, The Royal Tenenbaums, Zoolander.\n\nKenny Gravillis\n\nCo-Founder and Chief Creative Officer\n\nGravillis Inc.\n\nAbout Kenny: I loved two things growing up, music and movies, and I had no idea there was a career path that could have me involved in any of them. I started at Def Jam records in 1989, a bright-eyed bushy-tailed 21-year-old from East London, not having a clue what rap music was, but rubbing shoulders with the likes of Public Enemy and LL Cool J. That propelled me to MCA Records, which had me working with the likes of the Roots, Mary J. Blige and Common. After 10 years of working at a record label, I decided to try to broaden the horizons and got to work with more amazing artists independently. Then around 2004, when the music industry was struggling, I decided to pivot toward my other love, the movies. It was not an easy transition, but I do feel my love of movies always kept me excited, even when the opportunities weren’t coming. Fifteen years later, I’m fortunate to say I get to work on such a wide range of amazing films. I’m still in awe of it all, and seeing a billboard on the streets of L.A. or New York that we worked on never gets old.\n\nThoughts on the list: I think the first thing I can acknowledge is how incredibly fortunate I feel to be in a career that looks to me for my creative expression to represent the art of filmmaking, which has had a global impact on culture for as long as anyone probably reading this can remember. I try to remind myself of that often with the usually rewarding but quite challenging process of coming up with a poster that survives the gauntlet of approvals, politics, opinions and whims that come with making, and seeing through to the end, any poster for any film, big budget or small. When something does make it through that makes you feel, makes you remember or has any long-lasting impression, it becomes very special indeed. To me, that’s what this list represents. There are so many great pieces not on this list, but for me, in a respectful way, this list represents posters that took risks and resonated with a generation. I’m honored to be involved!\n\nSome posters from Kenny’s career: I Am Not Your Negro, Logan, Alvin and the Chipmunks: The Squeakquel.\n\nMassey Rafani\n\nEVP Creative Advertising\n\nWarner Bros.\n\nAbout Massey: I grew up a first-generation American, and a doctor’s son with a passion for art; and received little understanding of that from those around me. Against all odds, I ultimately went to art school to pursue a career route that would make me happiest. I studied illustration, design, photography and film—and by some lucky choices I ended up in Los Angeles and landed one of my very first jobs as an assistant art director at Warner Bros. in-house agency. I couldn’t believe I’d landed in a job that blended my greatest creative passions. Movie posters and trailers hold a profound place in my memories, and I always hoped to somehow create works and campaigns that stood the test of time. I’ve been blessed to spend 30 years devoted to a field of advertising and design that affects so many people’s life memories the way it’s indelibly affected mine.\n\nThoughts on the list: I’ve had a passionate love affair with the poster since my earliest years of art education, and the fact I’ve been able to actually build a career while being able to create movie posters and advertising is insanely and wonderfully surreal. Having to categorize or rank posters isn’t really my thing, though, because I don’t really have “a favorite” of anything; I simply have things I really love, and that gets me excited when I imagine the process that got it out to the world as a finished poster. The design challenges, the timing, the politics, and the subjectivity of it all are a constant gauntlet for great posters to run; and the ones on this list are only the tip of the iceberg of inspiring work that somehow got finished through a process that tries to dilute the bold and the daring. In the end, never mind the “How many?” and “Which ones?” and “What’s best?”—I’ll just smile whenever I see the bold and the daring thriving out there.\n\nSome posters from Massey’s career: Batman Forever, Ocean’s Eleven, Troy, Inception, The Dark Knight Trilogy, Suicide Squad.\n\nAdam Waldman\n\nFounding Partner and Creative Director\n\nThe Refinery\n\nAbout Adam: I love movie posters. Their blend of art and commerce, beauty and function, and commercial constraints and artistic freedom all add up to the perfect art form. My path has been shepherded by some of the best, and I’m grateful for all the support I’ve received every step of the way. It was BLT that gave me my education in great design, Concept Arts that gave me my confidence and my voice as an art director, Trailer Park that showed me how to build a team, and The Refinery that lets me share what I’ve learned with the best team I could ever have hoped for. I’m lucky to have found this incredible community of some of the best talents doing the most fun job in the world.\n\nThoughts on the list: This was a very challenging, triggering assignment for me: I truly, deeply love the art of key art; and I believe our work improves as a community, year after year. Many of the works on this list were The First; one could legitimately argue there have been “better” versions of them designed since. But the work that’s being done today stands on the shoulders of these beautiful and impactful pieces.\n\nSome posters from Adam’s career: The Matrix, 42, Inferno (teaser).\n\n50 Movie Posters That Changed Entertainment Marketing\n\nBelow is the list, in alphabetical order.
