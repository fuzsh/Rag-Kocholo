        "text": "Main Image:\n\nThe main image of this film poster is a combination of many pictures edited together. it shows the two main characters, the main prop, the castle in the background and the main character at one point in the film, surrounded by other supporting characters. The description of this makes the main image sound very busy, however, the images link and are well edited together. The main character is placed in front of the beast, and is presented in brighter colours.\n\nFilm Title:\n\nThe film title is the same as the original, as this is an adapted, modern version of the original. The font used is a classic cursive style, which supports the time period the story is set in. The more important words in thew title are bigger than the rest of the title, drawing the viewers eyes towards them. It is positioned conventionally, in the centre of the poster, in relation to the main image. The Disney logo is placed above the title, showing viewers that this is a branded, mainstream film.\n\nTagline:\n\nThe was no tagline in this film poster, due to the fact that it is an adaptation of the original, made in 1991, taglines became more popular, and common after.\n\nActors:\n\nThere are a lot of actor’s names presented at the top of the film poster, including the supporting characters, which is unconventional as film posters usually just include the main actors’ names. However, this mainstream film includes a lot of very well known actors, which is why they are all included. The font is the same as the main title, and the last names of the actors’ are in a bigger size font, as this is usually how they are referred as. For the actors such as Emma Thompson, who are well known in the industry, they are emphasised as they are included as ‘with’, and ‘and’, to shown that they are accomplished actors.\n\nColour Palette:\n\nThe colour palette of this film is a lot more colourful than my previous examples, to highlight the main points of the poster. It uses bright colours to emphasise the main character who is wearing a bright yellow dress and holding the main prop of the film. The muted colours used in the background blend well together, and contrast with the colours used in the main character. The beast, who is still a main character, but less than belle, is shown in darker colours which link with the background colours, emphasising that belle is the main character.\n\nLayout:\n\nThe layout of this film poster is fairly conventional as the title and other features of film posters are positioned to work around the main image, which is also laid out well to fit in with the title. All parts of this film poster are laid out conventionally, due to the fact that this is a very mainstream film, made my a very mainstream company: Disney.\n\nBilling Block:\n\nThe billbox of this film poster is conventional, as shown in a simplistic, small font with certain key words shown in a slightly larger font. This is placed at the bottom of the screen, as it would normally be. It also fits well around the main image, as it does not distract from this.\n\nRelease date:\n\nThis is shown under the billbox, which is where it is usually placed. It is in the same font as the main title and the actors’ names but in a different font to the billbox, helping to distinguish between them, and make it stand out.\n\nInfluence on my ideas of my Film Poster:\n\nThis has made me consider making the main character and the main prop of my short film to be the focus of my film poster. Since I am still yet to decide who I am aiming my short film to, it has also given more ideas for a short film aimed more at children, as my other film poster examples were a lot more dark."
