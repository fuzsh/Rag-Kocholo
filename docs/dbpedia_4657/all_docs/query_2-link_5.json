        "text": "“How to design a movie poster?” is a loaded question that calls for a deep understanding of graphic design and the movie industry.\n\nBut, we’ll do this question one better: How to design an effective movie poster? Now, that’s a real puzzle, which, unfortunately, doesn’t have any clear-cut solutions. What we can give you though are the breadcrumbs: marketing and movie poster design tips, tricks, and examples that will help you create a poster that does your movie justice.\n\nWhat makes an effective indie movie poster design?\n\nUnderstanding is a foundation of an effective movie poster design.\n\nLet’s explain.\n\nA movie poster is a hook the goal of which is to seduce a viewer into clicking the right link, saving the poster into their folder “watch later”, or researching more about your indie flick. It means you need to understand who your viewer is and how you can interest them.\n\nYes, great art can be created on impulse, in blind fervor without understanding why and for whom you’re creating it. We can’t say the same about a movie poster design because it’s, first of all, a marketing tool.\n\nMovie poster created by Getcovers\n\nWe don’t want to suck all the fun and life out of movie poster creation. On the contrary, there’s a lot of fun to experience creating the posters. But you need to incorporate research and planning to design a movie poster that works (which can also be a lot of fun).\n\nSo, we propose three questions the answers to which will help you to design a fine poster — the 3 W:\n\nWho is your movie for? (In other words, what is your niche?)\n\nWhy does your movie appeal to them? (Is it a relatable character, an interesting visual style, or a setting?)\n\nWhat makes your movie stand out from the competition? (Your unique selling point: Is it director, cast, an interesting mish-mash of genres, glowing reviews?)\n\nOf course, indie movie marketing research is much more complex than that. But in case of tight budgets, deadlines, and resources, this framework gives you a nice foundation for an effective movie poster design.\n\nNow that you have this vital understanding, you can move on to the second most important aspect of how to design a movie poster — actual design.\n\nHow to design a movie poster: top movie poster design tips\n\nTo design a movie poster is to build a complex mechanism with a lot of moving parts that need to be well-oiled and precise to work well together. So, here are movie poster design tips that will help you keep everything up to the standards.\n\nMovie poster concept tips\n\nTo know how to design a movie poster, you need to know how to approach the poster concept first.\n\nIdeally, a movie poster concept should reflect the answers to the aforementioned 3 W:\n\nYour film’s niche;\n\nYour film’s appeal;\n\nYour film’s USP.\n\nIt’s motivating: With such an approach, you have clear directions.\n\nSo, at this point, you should have ideas of what you want to depict on your poster.\n\nShould the poster be more character-focused or setting-focused?\n\nShould the poster be minimalist or overflowing with details?\n\nShould it include scenes from the film, clear visual storytelling, or paint a more abstract picture?\n\nYou know the preferences of your viewers and the strengths of your film, so play to them.\n\nAnd next, regardless of whether you work alone or with a professional movie poster designer, we suggest finding references. They will help give definite shape to your ideas and provide a designer with visual guidelines.\n\nWhen looking for references, don’t limit yourself to movie posters alone. You can also check book cover design, album art, illustrations, and whichever visual you find relevant and useful.\n\nMovie poster visual storytelling tips\n\nWith a poster concept at hand, you can get to crafting visuals.\n\nIt’d be great if a viewer could discern at least one of the following when looking at your indie movie poster design:\n\nMovie’s genre;\n\nMovie’s theme;\n\nMovie’s setting;\n\nMovie’s conflict;\n\nMovie’s premise;\n\nMovie’s message.\n\nA great example of the poster that masterfully tells a viewer a lot of the aforementioned with little is Midsommar — a horror movie directed by Ari Aster.\n\nThe ethnic elements on the poster show the setting — a North European community that is close to its roots.\n\nThe distressed/terrified/devastated face of the character strongly hints at the uncanny elements of the movie.\n\nThe seemingly upbeat tagline — “Let the festivities begin” — is in harmony with the bright imagery and in the tense contrast with the woman’s emotions. Folk festivities sure sound like a lot of fun, but in this particular case, we’d rather pass.\n\nThe poster also doesn’t look like your typical horror movie poster because A24 and Ary Aster aren’t known for making typical horror movies. Their fans are used to a more avant-garde style of the studio’s pictures, and the poster reflects it.\n\nIf you want a unique horror movie that doesn’t shy away from unfamiliar aesthetics and approaches, you’ll definitely notice Midsommar’s poster.\n\nMovie poster design elements\n\nNext, you want to choose which movie poster design elements you want to include. Overall, a movie poster can have the following elements:\n\nTitle;\n\nTagline — a motto/slogan of the movie;\n\nLogotypes — a symbol of a movie or studio;\n\nName of a director;\n\nNames of actors and actresses;\n\nStudio name;\n\nTheatrical release date;\n\nNominations and awards movie received;\n\nProminent quotes from reviews;\n\nAge restriction;\n\nRelated movies — other films by the same director or studio and movies starring the same actors;\n\nContacts — film website, address,\n\nYou don’t want to overload your movie poster design elements, so pick the most beneficial ones. Most often, indie filmmakers include title, tagline, director’s name, awards, cast, and studio.\n\nUsually, the title is the most prominent element, followed by tagline or important awards. The names of director, studios, or cast are next in line, taking enough space to be readable but not fighting for viewer’s attention. The rest of additional info, if any, is barely legible.\n\nMovie poster created by Getcovers\n\nAlso, it’s better to plan movie poster design elements inclusion around artwork and not vice versa.\n\nWith two exceptions though:\n\nTitle and Tagline.\n\nThis duo is particularly important as title and tagline are an intrinsic part of the design: They can change a viewer’s perception of the movie poster’s visual storytelling. (And vice versa like we demonstrated with the Midsommar poster.)\n\nSo\n\nRemember to account for how the title and tagline interact with the movie poster graphic design.\n\nIndie Movie Poster Typography Tips\n\nTypography can make or break the artwork. So, understanding typography is essential to understanding how to design a movie poster\n\nGreat typography should feel like an integral part of your movie poster graphic design. It means that the font, text’s color, texture, positioning, and customization should fit the rest of the visuals like a glove.\n\nWe can’t give you any clear-cut rules for successful movie poster typography as they don’t exist. Each case calls for something new. But a few general typography customization tips can help:\n\nMixed case letters are the most readable;\n\nLetters in bold show power;\n\nSlanted letters convey a sense of movement;\n\nStraight letters refer to stability;\n\nFonts with fewer embellishments feel comforting and chic. Use them for the impression of elegance, strict confidence, or authority;\n\nFonts with more ornaments speak creativity. Use them if your want the text to seem loud, expressive;\n\nUse broad or narrow letter spacing to communicate airiness or the anxiety of confined space.\n\nKeep in mind that the typography choice depends on the movie genre, for example:\n\nLarge and bold fonts, like Arial, Helvetica, Gotham and Futura, are suitable for comedy titles.\n\nHorror movies tend to have serif fonts or combination of serif and non-serif one.\n\nGlowy typography is a perfect match for science fiction.\n\nRomance movies most likely contain elegant fonts with a lot of curls.\n\nMovie poster design also gives a possibility to place text unconventionally. Depending on the features of the composition, you can place the title not only horizontally, but also vertically or diagonally.\n\nOften, picking typography for the movie poster graphic design comes down to experimenting and seeing what sticks the best. Ideally, you want a professional movie poster designer to help you out.\n\nIndie Movie Poster Color Tips\n\nWhen deciding on the color scheme for your movie poster graphic design, your gut instinct might be to follow the color trends of the industry\n\nIt seems safe and easy, but that’s a precarious road for an indie film\n\nTrends are created and reinforced by big players that try their damnedest to cater to the widest audience possible.

And it definitely sounds like a fun watch, but we doubt it was an intended association.\n\nOn the other hand, your indie movie caters to a very specific niche. So, your colorwork should reflect your movie’s appeal. In other words, you have more creative freedom as you shouldn’t walk the precarious tightrope of mass appeal.\n\nYour primary task is to ensure that colors suit the tone of your movie. The poster shouldn’t have a similar color grading per se, but the hues should send a similar emotional message.\n\nIn other words, the colors should reflect the promise of your movie, whether it’s: you’d be scared, sad, enthusiastic, retrospective, enraged…\n\nDesign by Getcovers\n\nINDIE MOVIE POSTER EXAMPLES\n\nLet’s see how all these tips work in practice looking at book cover examples designed by the Getcover team.\n\nHow to create an adventure movie poster?\n\nThe main character stands in the center with his back welcoming readers to join his adventure.
