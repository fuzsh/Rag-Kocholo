You can add multiple Min The minimum amount of this item that will appear after this object is destroyed. Max The maximum amount of items that will appear after this object is destroyed.\n\nSet resource storage[]\n\nConfiguring a resource storage for an object will create a meter on the object in-game. This opens up a lot of possibilities. It can be as simple as a water dispenser where you only take water out, or it can be something more complicated, like putting gasoline in and then let it drain to create electric power. You can define multiple resource types.\n\nProperty Description Charging type ID The ID of a charging type. Default storage The amount of this resource it spawns with Max storage The maximum amount of this resource that can be stored in this object Delta per hour The amount of this resource that will increase or decrease per hour. A positive number will increase the amount of resource stored and a negative amount will drain this resource per hour. Can import manually Whether or not you can manually input this resource type. If disabled, you can give the player the option of importing the resource trough the 'Set interaction' options (see above) Can export manually Whether or not you can manually export this resource type. If disabled, you can give the player the option of exporting the resource trough the 'Set interaction' options (see above)\n\nSet activating effect[]\n\nThis allows you to set a variety of effects when interacting with this object. For example:\n\nTurn it off when it runs out of resources\n\nDeal damage/give health when it is destroyed\n\nTurn it into something else, like when you would unfold a folded object into an unfolded object.\n\nThe image below shows an effect that is triggered manually by the player, or automatically when it runs out of gas. The effect is configured in the 'portable_gas_generator_on' and will transform itself into the 'portable_gas_generator' when triggered.\n\nProperty Description Call ID The ID of the function that is called in this effect.

Trigger charging type ID The ID of a charging type that will be used to trigger the effect. Trigger type The type of trigger for this effect. The options are 'Lack_of_charging_type', 'Full_of_charging_type' and 'None'. Object effect The effect of this object that will occur after the trigger has occurred Sound effect The sound effect that will play when this effect is triggered Add new activating Adds a new activating option to this object. When adding a new effect, the options are 'Transform', 'Transform automatic', 'Transform with function', 'Disassemble' and 'Destruction'\n\nSet rendering[]\n\nProperty Description Rendering type Options are 'Baseground' (for crops and traps), 'General' (for most objects, like furniture and doors) and 'End' (not sure what this is for) is passable Whether or not you pass trough this object. Useful for 'Baseground' objects since you walk over them. Enabling this will negate the effect of set collider. pass light Whether or not light passes trough this object pass bullets Whether or not bullets pass trough this object has light If enabled, this object will light up the area Light intensity How intense the light is. The solar lamp post has an intensity of 2, for reference Light range The range of the light in pixels. The solar lamp post has a range of 600, for reference Light color The color of the light that is emitted.\n\nSet sprite[]\n\nProperty Description Durability ratio This basically lets you set damage 'levels' for your object. This is used to visualize damage. For every level you configure here you will be able to select a sprite of what your object will look like with that amount of health left. In the example above, there are three levels. 100%, 80% and 40%. Notice how these numbers also appear above the sprites. Adding more then one durability ratio is not required but it adds to the immersion. Capacity ratio Allows you to set levels of capacity for this object. This is used to visualize how much stuff is inside this object. For every level you configure, you will be able to select a sprite of what your object will look like with that amount of stuff in it, as a percentage of it's capacity. In the example above it will show one sprite when it is 60-100% full and a different sprite when it is 2-60% full. It is not required to add more then one capacity level. North/south/west/east sprite You are able to select a sprite for each of the directions your object may face. A round object like a barrel may use one sprite for each of the directions but a chair may have one for each direction. Copy from Helps you to copy the settings from another direction to this direction. This is used for convenience. Base/durability/capacity sprites The base sprite is always present. For the base and each of the durability/capacity ratio's you can select a sprite by dragging a sprite from the assets onto the sprite name Has animation See below\n\nHas animation\n\nProperty Description Has animation If enabled, allows you to configure a number of frames that will be cycled trough to create an animation. Sprite A preview and the name of a sprite for this frame. Drag a sprite from the assets to the sprite name to change it. The base sprite will always be visible, and each frame sprite will be drawn on top of it so be sure your sprites have transparent backgrounds. Time The amount of seconds this sprite will be visible before changing to the next sprite. This helps to time the animation in-game. Since animation is typically 24 frames a second, 0,05 will work most of the time. Has light Whether or not this frame should emit light when it is visible. By enabling it for some but not for other frames, you could create a flicker effect Light color Lets you pick the color of the light Intensity The intensity of the light. For reference, the solar lamp pole has 2 Range The range of the light. For reference, the solar lamp pole has 600\n\nSet collider[]\n\nThis lets you set the area on which characters will collide with this object (if passable is checked off under set rendering). It will always be as big as the size. The size is measured in tiles. In the example below, the size of the object is 3 by 1, so in the horizontal orientation it is 3 tiles wide and 1 tile high. In the vertical orientation it is 3 tiles high and 1 tile wide.\n\nSet local position[]\n\nThis is used for instances where the player can position themselves on the object, like a bed."
