Robert Clouse directed the martial arts action thriller. Bob Gleason is the artist for the poster.\n\nThe poster measures 27\" x 41\" and is in very good condition with minimal surface wear near the bottom cross-fold. It was folded at the time of printing and has a pinhole separation at the bottom cross-fold. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters.\n\nPlease look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.\n\nThis very rare and collectible poster, printed in 1979 to promote the U.S. theatrical release of Game of Death, is not a reproduction or a reprint.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF AUTHENTICITY (COA) INCLUDED"
