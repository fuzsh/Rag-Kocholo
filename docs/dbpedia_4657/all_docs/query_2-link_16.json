        "text": "There are many ways to design a movie poster, but putting together a piece that captures the essence of the film while attracting the audience and mainstream media is what matters the most. When we look at some posters we immediately think they are unique, but when we zoom in, we’ll start to notice interesting styles and patterns that are worth analyzing.\n\nTherefore, if we are looking for our design to stand from the crowd, we must pay close attention to the aforementioned styles and patterns, their characteristics and their relationship with the movie genere. Now without further ado, let’s start with the analysis of the 5 most common types of movie posters!\n\nThis is one of the most common types of poster, and as the title points out, the main element here is an image of the leading character or hero, showcasing their attributes, abilities, their relationship with the movie, their personality, and so on. This type of design works really well when this character is well known, famous, no matter if it’s fictional, historic or interpreted by a seasoned actress/actor.\n\nWe can use this type of design to highlight an unique and colorful hero as well. A leading character power-couple can fit into this category too.\n\nA glorious moustache and a fierce jaw line. Neon lights of purple and pink: Showbusiness and rock & roll. Need we say more? Bohemian Rhapsody, the life and struggle of one of the most iconic rock singers of all time, Freddy Mercury.\n\nThe elements mentioned above are hard to miss, and they’re making a statement: Rockstar! That’s the movie you’re about to watch.\n\nWe haven’t watched this movie yet, but we can talk about the clever and beautiful composition, including this couple of protagonists and the melancholic brownish yellow streets of Beale Street, like if those streets lived inside of them.\n\nIf those streets could talk! We’d bet they would tell a heart-touching and relatable love story. Not to mention the detail some could miss, the light grey gradient. There is some sadness there too.\n\nAn ominous machine in front of a city or kingdom, plus a shady but colorful protagonist. She’s about to fight and never look back! The grey tones of the background and her red mask/scarf shows us we are about to dive into a fantasy, chaotic and post-apocalyptic story. A perfect depiction of the title: Mortal Engines.\n\nThis is very similar to the previous one, but this time we will find the two parts that are clashing in the film, the hero and the villain, the protagonist and the antagonist. This style is very useful when the plot indicates a strong struggle between two forces.\n\nThis is another example of a couple of friends, the girl and Bumblebee, versus the military man that’s about to hunt them down. We see a bond between alien and human, struggle and preoccupation from the girl. Nice touch giving us a hint on one of the locations where this film is going to unfold: San Francisco.\n\nAn extension from “the hero” and “the antagonists”, which includes almost if not all the cast of the film, main protagonists and antagonists. This type of design is very attractive and shows the central idea of the movie in a creative way. The epic plots and big productions often benefit from this style or pattern.\n\nThis 2019 film, Once Upon A Time In Hollywood, took advantage of two styles: the cast collage and a retro vibe since the movie is set in the late sixties. The result is a “sketched-like” photography collage with most of the cast, and depicting situations that we might see happening while watching the movie. Nice poster.\n\nThe Force and the Dark Side confront again in “Star Wars, The Rise Of Skywalker”. The main characters get to use a given space, in order of importance, we dare to say. If we keep analyzing, we can see two predominant colors: blue, representing The Force, and red for the Dark Side. A foreshadowing fight scene is represented at the bottom, almost unseen.\n\nAs you can already imagine, we are talking about a poster design that doesn’t include specific characters, but a beautiful landscape, a futuristic vision or maybe a post apocalyptic panorama instead. It can be a montage or allusive image aligned with the film’s main plot, decorated with logos, symbols or typography. We could be talking about “minimalist trends” to be included into this category as well. This design type can cover a wide range of topics, as long as it keeps “playing” with the psychological aspect of the film in question.\n\nWe haven’t seen The Endless, but this film is promising science fiction, multi-dimensions and mystery. Again, just a very nice design without characters or faces, but an interesting use of dark colors on the outside, and “spacey”, “heavenly” tones on a tornado of worlds.\n\nIn the poster of Vice, we get a big face, but we cannot distinguish who is he. It’s minimalist approach with white, black and yellow gives us nothing on the movie, just an “stoic” silhouette of a man. Maybe the movie is serious? We have to watch it.\n\nWe have done a little countdown of the styles or patterns that commonly emerge at the time of designing a movie poster and it’s worth mention that creatives have been using some of them since the beginning of advertising related to film making. As graphic design professionals we always look for the most suitable artistic vision for our client’s projects, and we make sure it encloses the essence of the film genere that is assigned to us. If you are struggling with the decision of which way to go artistically, need assistance or better, to turn your poster into a piece of art, please do not hesitate to contact us. We will be glad to help you."
