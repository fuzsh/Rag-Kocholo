        "text": "What do all these games have in common? Nothing! Nothing I had in mind anyway, except I'm going to write about them in this blog.\n\nRed Dead Redemption\n\nI may be a year late, but I was thinking about Red Dead Redemption and I have 2 designs to do today for my daily design blog. Looking at vintage movie posters (mainly mean streets and the birds) I wanted to make a movie poster for the game. Initially I thought of doing it in the style of a western poster but that has already been done, so I didn't go with the obvious choice.\n\nPersonally? I had a lot of great ideas about the smoke forming mexico, the wedding ring being on the gun.... but I didn't combine them efectively enough. There's too much text and too much dead weight around in the composition.\n\nHere it is. Leave comments and feedback, I love to read them.\n\nView High Res\n\nLove the game.\n\nPortal 2\n\nPortal 2 finally arrived. I went through it in one 8 hour sitting and enjoyed every minute of it. I could go on for an eternity about how enjoyable I found the story, characters, overall writing and gameplay but I won't. I got stuck a few times because I hadn't seen a surface I could shoot a portal on, but generally the game was easy enough. Like Jeff said on the bombcast, games are thrill rides. I want my thrill ride. Portal 2 makes you feel smart enough without challenging you too much.\n\nReally enjoyed the section with the old test chambers and most of all, Cave Johnson.\n\nI made a portal 2 poster during the wait which you can check out here.\n\nI also just made this. A poster in the style of the safety posters during the 50s section of Portal 2.\n\nView High Res\n\nTales of Monkey Island\n\nI have had these forever after buying all 5 chapters in a Steam sale. I have wanted to get in to Telltale Game's adventure games for quite a while but they aren;t the most exciting or engaging games. Apart from being stumped on a puzzle or 2 I have had a very pleasant experience. Love the characters and world they have set up. The graphics are nice but the style of animation is so disjointed it bugs me sometimes.\n\nI might do an illustration of Morgan soon. She has an impossibly thin waist."
