        "text": "The dark colours on the poster connote some sort of evil as black and dark colours are generally referred back to the concept of death and evil and also shadows which are shifty which you don’t always see so that mystery aswell. The house behind the boy is looming over him which may suggest that the boy is affiliated with the house some how. Furthermore the boy’s eyes are white and scratched out almost this can be referred back to the idea of the eyes being the window to your soul because his eyes cannot be seen he could be soul less or possibly he may be possessed by another soul which is evil because you can't see into his window to his soul.\n\n'Insidious' however is written in white, white is a pure colour it connotes innocence for example doves and the act of wearing a white wedding dress suggests the concept of purity, this could then be related back to the little boy on the poster and although he is possessed he is actually innocent and it isn't his fault. Also the fact that at the top of the film poster it says 'from the makers of SAW and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY' this foreshadows that the film is going to be scary because the two mentioned franchises are scary and have thrilled their audiences. Furthermore the fact that the poster says 'so scary I was wimpering in terror' signifies that the film is scary because people only wimper when they're put in pressured situations or about to cry because they're afraid or sad.\n\nThe mist in the background also within the trees connotes some mystery because you can't see through the mist and when you are left in the unknown you're left wondering, left wanting to know more also the flowers in the grass are dead this could connote some bad luck and the idea of omens. Flowers are usually given as a gift of happiness and celebration so the fact that they are dead conveys gloom and dark days.\n\nOn another note the boy in the picture is central and the main focus of the poster this suggests that he is the main focus of the movie also the caption below him which says 'it's not the house that's haunted' this connotes that it is the boy in the poster who is haunted and not the house\n\n(Serena Antoine-Donatein)\n\nThe character in the play is wearing a red cape, a cape could connote a sense of protection as it is used to protect a person and act like shelter however the fact that it is in red could suggest a sense of danger is upon that person as red is a symbollic colour for danger. The colour red has literally been used in nearly every single word on the poster, this strongy prefigures that something bad/ bloody is going to undergo throughout the movie. The title of the film Red Riding Hood is also writting in red with blood slattered on it this signifies danger it could also connote a lost of someones life within the movie. The movie also says From The Directors Of Twilight , Twilight is a great movie that is known for it thriller like style, the fact that it is written in red could also relate back to the fact that twilight is a vampire movie. It then goes on to say Comes A Breathtaking Vision Of A 700 Year Old Legend , the use of the word breathtaking connotes a lose of a life or someones last words, implicating to s the lose of somone within the movie.\n\nThe image also has tree however unlike normal trees these trees have thorns poking out, this could signify a sense of danger as when a person touches a thorn they end up hurt connoting a sense of sadness or even lose. The background of the poster seems to be full of mist, mist forgrounds a sense of uncertanity or something being unclear. The fact that you cannot see anything behind or around her, except for the thorns and the trees portrays that everywhere she goes she is like to be in danger or to be harmed in some way.\n\nFuthermore it is visable that there is snow on the floor, this suggest the season of winter, winter is a season where it is very dark and cold at night this could mirror theme and setting of the movie. The fact that the snow is dropping down in the scene suggests that her imprints in the snow are being covered as to say no one had been there forshadowing what may occur within the movie.\n\nThe camera shot is a meduim long shot with a canted angle, this gives the effect that the character is about to fall, signifiing a sense of helplessness and dispair. Due to the fact that the focus on the thorn have been blured out and the focus is on the camera it shows that the trees are closing in on the character, reflecting a sign of trapped and danger at each end. It could also be said that the camera shot could be reflecting the characters point of view as she looks as if she's running and the experesions on her face show that she is in need of help, connoting that she is loosing her breath and blacking out which links back to one of the titles A Breathtaking Version.\n\n(Rochelle Eshun)\n\n\"Atmospheric, Powerful And Sizzling With Sexiness\": the poster uses a range of buzz words, buzz words are genreally used to entice an audience.\n\nThe words used are very strong and powerful it gives a quick and powerful summary (synopsis) of what the film may be about. The word 'sizzling' connotes a burning, hot and fire like situation that may occur within the film; this tells the audience that there may be some sort of 'action' in a sense of thriller.\n\n\"Forever Young. Forever Cursed.\" This fraze could be associated with the demonic world, the connotations given off are, demonic, cursed, wild and free, enchanted and almost unreal.\n\nThe picture of Dorian is central and very focused this could suggest that he is the main character and he will be the centre of attention, his posture aswell as his potion in the poster could demonstarte a sense of dominance and power within the character but also within his neighbourhood as he is above he male and female behind him (they are made to seem small and isolated within the positiong of the poster) also displaying dominance within sex, the fact that he is looking down within the poster may connote that he feels himself as being above everyone else portraying superiority and maybe even power.\n\nWithin the picture Dorian is seen to be split in half this could connote a split personality, loss off yourself or soul. Gradually decaying and rotting away as maybe his superiority becomes minimal or taken over. This may also be or be seen as a forshadow of what is later to happen within the actual film.\n\nThe fact that Dorian is burning may suggest the idea that he has sold his soul or may have a strong sort of relation with the devil because if you are evil in life then in death you spend eternity burning in hell and in this poster Dorian is burning internally which could connote that his soul has already been sold. This could also connote a cold heart/soul dying out as consequences of any cold actions that may have been released and affected others at any point (karma).\n\nDorian is wearing a red shirt and black suit; the rd may connote death, bood, fire and burning, these connotations can be used as a foreshadow as well as an omen within the film. Aswell as Dorian the lady behind him also wears red again this could suggest she has somethig to do with this evil plan or maybe the reason to why Dorian is slowly burning away.\n\nThe black that Dorian is wearing could connote death, being blind ('hypnotised'), displaying a bad omen again foreshadowing an aspect in the film that may occur being bad or unfortunate.\n\nThe mist that is displayed withing the background may connote uncertainty, things being un clear, unpredictability and maybe something even being enchanted and cold hearted.\n\n(Tia Cooper-Joseph)\n\nThis Image compliments the title of the film as it is called ‘The game’ and his face is made up of a jigsaw. Although a jigsaw is not a game, therefore it signifies that there is no fun and enjoyment within him and in turn shows that he uses intellect to construct his life. However, the puzzle is falling away from his face, which suggests that pieces of him may be missing.\n\nThe medium close up shot emphasises his facial expressions, such as the direction of his eyes. As they are looking away from the falling pieces, it shows he wants to avoid and not face the fact that he is falling apart. Also, the black background creates an eerie sense and also signifies that the lost pieces from his brain have fallen into nothing and dispersed forever.\n\nThe text in the cover ‘Players Wanted’ suggests that this main character may not be able to cope by himself. Also, it may show that ‘the game’ requires intellect.\n\nThe white colour of ‘The Game’ in contrast to the black background may infer that ‘The Game’ is a way out and an opportunity to escape the darkness.\n\n(Robert O'Reilly)\n\n​The reason behind the film poster analysis was to analyse the conventions of a thriller as well as what connotes a thriller this would be able to help us spark various new ideas to improve the concept behind our own thriller opening and give us more understanding and insight into what makes a thriller."
