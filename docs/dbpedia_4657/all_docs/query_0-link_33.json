As the diabolical guest tries to get her claws on the child, Belinda must draw the line somewhere…\n\nCenters on a family who takes a dream holiday to an idyllic country house, only to have the vacation turn into a psychological nightmare.\n\nIn the new action-comedy THE KILLER’S GAME, when top hitman Joe Flood (Dave Bautista) is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he decides to take matters into his own hands – by taking a hit out on himself. But when the very hitmen he hired also target his ex-girlfriend (Sofia Boutella), he must fend off an army of assassin colleagues and win back the love of his life before it’s too late."
