        "text": "Command /help Text Description Examples /warp Usage /warp warpAction. Warps player to a world and/or position. Valid warp action formats include: OwnShip, OrbitedWorld, CelestialWorld:celestialcoordinates, InstanceWorld:worldid:<uuid>:<level>, ClientShipWorld:playeruuid, Player:playeruuid, Nowhere (current world). Most warp actions can have =xcoordinate.ycoordinate added to specify a position within that world. Teleports the user to a location on a planet or within an instanced area such as a Mission or the Outpost. Arguments contained within <>s are optional. /warp Nowhere=0.1100,\n\n/warp OrbitedWorld,\n\n/warp InstanceWorld:outpost /timewarp Usage /timewarp time. Warp universe time ahead by the specified number of seconds. Modifies the server time by the specified number of seconds, causing day-night cycles on planets and Outpost merchants to update accordingly. Both positive and negative values are accepted. /timewarp 30 /settileprotection Usage /settileprotection dungeonId isProtected. Set protection for blocks with the specified dungeonId to be true (unbreakable) or false (breakable). Sets the isProtected property of the instanced area specified by dungeonId to the specified value. IsProtected is a boolean property and thus can be either true or false. You can see the dungeon ID in /debug mode. /settileprotection floranmission1 false /setspawnpoint Usage /setspawnpoint. Sets the default spawn point on the current world to your character's position. Same as /help Text. The default spawn point is where people who beam down to a given world will appear. /setspawnpoint /spawnitem Usage /spawnitem itemName [count] [parameters]. Spawn the specified item at the mouse cursor. If the item does not exist it will spawn a perfectly generic item. Count should be an integer and defaults to 1. Parameters should be specified as a JSON object enclosed by single quotes. Same as /help Text. Arguments in brackets are usually optional; however, if you are filling in parameters, you must also fill in count in order for the command to work correctly.\n\nTo find an item's spawn name you can look here, or at the bottom of its wiki page, or unpack the assets.\n\nTo spawn a codex type itemName-codex, e.g., esthersjournal (itemName) becomes /spawnitem esthersjournal-codex.\n\nWhen using the color index or JSON parameters below, the count is required. When not using them, you can leave off the count and get 1 item.\n\nItems can be spawned in different colors using the color index like so: /spawnitem florantier6mhead 1 '{\"colorIndex\":4}'\n\n1. Black 2. Grey 3. White 4. Red 5. Orange 6. Yellow 7. Green 8. Blue 9. Purple 10. Pink 11. Brown\n\nYou can spawn in custom colors by using JSON parameters to replace the hex color values in the item's asset file like this:\n\n/spawnitem bonusarmorchest 1 '{\"directives\":\"?replace;6f2919=151515;a85636=383838;e0975c=555555;ffca8a=838383\"}'\n\n/spawnitem money 5 /spawntreasure Usage /spawntreasure poolName [level]. Spawns all items in a single random generation of the specified treasure pool at the mouse cursor. Level defaults to 1. Same as /help Text. If you are using treasure pools with a chance for nothing to drop, you may have to use the command multiple times before you get an item to appear. The level argument corresponds to Tier and is important mostly for generic treasure pools such as commonGun and uniqueWeapon. /spawntreasure uniqueWeapon 6 /spawnmonster Usage /spawnmonster type [level] [parameters]. Spawn a monster of the specified type at the mouse cursor. Level defaults to 1. Parameters should be specified as a JSON object enclosed by single quotes.

Spawn an NPC of the specified species and type at the mouse cursor. Level defaults to 1. Overrides should be specified as a JSON object enclosed by single quotes. Spawns an NPC of the specified species and type at the mouse cursor. For full details see: Spawn NPC Command /spawnnpc novakid merchant /spawnvehicle Usage /spawnvehicle type [parameters]. Spawn a vehicle of the specified type at the mouse cursor. Parameters should be specified as a JSON object enclosed by single quotes. Same as /help Text. Hoverbikes and boats spawned this way are not connected to controllers, so they cannot be desummoned or repaired normally. /spawnvehicle hoverbikered /spawnstagehand Usage /spawnstagehand type [parameters]. Spawn a Stagehand of the specified type. Parameters should be specified as a JSON object enclosed by single quotes. Spawns a stagehand, a helper object which is mainly used for Quests and within instanced areas such as Missions. Valid stagehand types include coordinator, mailbox, messenger, objecttracker, questlocation, questmanager, radiomessage, waypoint, bossmusic, cultistbeamposition, cultistflyingslashposition, cultistidleslashposition, cultistlowerdashposition, cultistsphereposition, cultistupperdashposition, bossdooropener, bossplanner, npccombat, apexmissionbattleeffect, apexmissioncallscriptsensor, glitchmissionmanager, glitchmissionspawnpoint, and protectoratemanager /spawnstagehand bossmusic /clearstagehand Usage /clearstagehand.

Despawns any stagehands with broadcast areas containing or positions close to the current cursor position. /clearstagehand /spawnliquid Usage /spawnliquid liquidName [quantity]. Spawn a quantity of the specified liquid at the mouse cursor. Quantity defaults to 1. Same as /help Text. If you want to spawn liquid as an item that you loot, use /spawnitem instead. For full details see: Spawn Liquid Command /spawnliquid corelava 20 /kick Usage /kick playerSpecifier [reason]. Kick the specified player and send the reason to the player. If no reason is specified then the player's server nickname is used as the reason.\", Same as /help Text. For all admin commands with a playerSpecifier field, client ID, server nickname or player UUID can be used to specify the targeted player. /kick Player Swearing /ban Usage /ban playerSpecifier [reason] [kind] [timeInSeconds]. Kick and ban the specified player and send the reason to the player. If no reason is specified then the player's server nickname is used as the reason. Kind is specified as \"uuid\" or \"ip\" or \"both\" and defaults to \"both\". timeInSeconds defaults to forever. Bans that have a specified duration are not persistent. If you shut down the server or reload configuration, all of your temporarily banned users will be unbanned immediately.\", Same as /help Text. For all admin commands with a playerSpecifier field, client ID, server nickname or player UUID can be used to specify the targeted player. A UUID ban only prevents a particular character from joining, regardless of IP address, while an IP ban prevents all users at a particular IP address from joining, regardless of their chosen character. /ban Player Griefing both /list Usage /list. List all clients logged into the server. Format is $clientId : serverNickname : $$playerUuid. If the serverNickname contains unprintable characters the unicode escape sequence for those characters will be displayed instead. Same as /help Text. This command is useful for helping you use commands requiring a playerSpecifier field. /list /whereis Usage /whereis playerSpecifier. Display the celestial coordinate of the specified player's current location. Same as /help Text. For all admin commands with a playerSpecifier field, client ID, server nickname or player UUID can be used to specify the targeted player. /whereis Player /serverreload Usage /serverreload. Reloads the remote, server side assets. Will cause lag as they are reparsed. Same as /help Text. /serverreload /enablespawning Usage /enablespawning. Enable automatic monster spawning on the current world. Same as /help Text. If the current world is unloaded, spawning will reset to its default setting when it is reloaded. /enablespawning /disablespawning Usage /disablespawning. Disable automatic monster spawning on the current world. Same as /help Text. If the current world is unloaded, spawning will reset to its default setting when it is reloaded. /disablespawning /placedungeon Usage /placedungeon dungeonname [position]. Place the given dungeon into the world anchored at the specified position or the player's cursor position. Positions should be specified as x,y. Ignores anchoring rules. Though the command doesn't specify it, a JSON parameter enclosed in single quotes can be added to modify the properties of the dungeon to be placed.\n\nUnlike the Lua function of the same name, the command does not allow the user to set the dungeon ID; all placed dungeons are assigned dungeon ID 1. Furthermore, the command does not alter world parameters within the dungeon, such as breathability or gravity; those must be set using additional commands.\n\nBe careful when using this command, as placing dungeons correctly by hand is difficult and often produces \"ugly\" results.\n\n/placedungeon evilfortress /setuniverseflag Usage /setuniverseflag flagName. Sets the current universe flag, triggering any associated world changes. Universe Flags allow the game to know what progressive state the Universe is in (which missions have been completed). This command can be used administratively to mark missions as completed. Acceptable arguments: outpost_mission*, outpost_beakeasy (outpost_mission could be any of 1-6, they seem to need to be done in order though meaning you can't just run a single /setuniverseflag outpost_mission6 without having done the rest of them first), outpost_techscientist# (# is either 1 or 2), outpost_ursaminer, final_gate_key, vaultsopen /setuniverseflag outpost_mission1 /resetuniverseflags Usage /resetuniverseflags. Clears all universe flags, but doesn't directly revert any effects triggered by those flags. Deletes all universe flags associated with a given universe. Useful for resetting the Outpost to its initial state, though the changes won't take effect until the first time that the Outpost is loaded after using this command. /resetuniverseflags /addbiomeregion N/A Usage /addbiomeregion biome width. Adds a biome region of the specified type at the position of the cursor, with the width in some unknown metric. Fails on non-terrestrial worlds. /addbiomeregion forest 1 /expandbiomeregion N/A Usage /expandbiomeregion width. Expands the biome region at the position of the cursor, with the width in some unknown metric. Fails on non-terrestrial worlds. /expandbiomeregion 10 /updateplanettype N/A Usage /updateplanettype CelestialCoordinate type weatherBiome. Changes the planet type and weather pools of the specified celestial object. May need to leave the world and return for changes to be visible. Invalid planet types will break the navigation console upon attempting to view world, but is otherwise safe. \"barren barren\" is a valid combination. /updateplanettype -973348486:557584042:-167133627:11 forest desert /setenvironmentbiome N/A Usage /setenvironmentbiome ? ? ?. Does something with the background parallax of the current layer, possibly setting it to a generic value. Fails horribly on non-terrestrial worlds. Use at your own risk. /setenvironmentbiome /setdungeonid N/A Usage /setdungeonid dungeonId. Sets the dungeonId of the (single) tile at the cursor's position. /setdungeonid 0 /warprandom N/A Usage /warprandom planetType. Warps to a random planet of the specified planetType. /warprandom forest /unbanip Usage /unbanip address. Removes entries with the specified address from temporary and permanent ban lists.

This enables or disables all of the commands below. /gravity Usage /gravity. Display the gravity at the player's position. Same as /help Text. /boxes Usage /boxes. Toggle the display of collision debugging polygons if debug mode is enabled. Draws all collision boxes. All red boxes represent solid, whereas green represent background. Note this may cause servere lag. /clearboxes Usage /clearboxes. Toggle whether or not to clear boxes displayed with /boxes every frame. Useful for determining routes that enemies take, can get messy looking though. Doesn't seem to be working. Server returns 'No such command'. /fullbright Usage /fullbright. Disable the lighting engine and show everything. When enabled, everything displays as if it were fully lit. /fixedcamera Usage /fixedcamera. Toggle locking the camera's position; camera will not scroll. Sectors may not load or behave correctly when the camera is distant from the player's position. Same as /help Text. /setgravity Usage /setgravity level. Sets your local gravity to the level specified. Negative values will make you fall up but you can't jump from your head. This change is local only, and looks pretty heinous on a server, because it screws very heavily with delta prediction. Same as /help Text. /resetgravity Usage /resetgravity. Undoes /setgravity. Begin using server gravity again. Same as /help Text. /eval Usage /eval <lua>. Evaluates given lua in script processor context. Only usable locally. Runs given lua function or script. /entityeval Usage /entityeval <lua>. Evaluates given lua in the context of the closest scripted entity to the cursor. Only usable locally.

Force completion of a currently active quest with the given quest ID (usually the quest template ID). Same as /help Text. /failquest Usage /failquest questId. Force failure of a currently active quest with the given quest ID (usually the quest template ID). Same as /help Text. /previewnewquest Usage /previewnewquest questTemplateId positionInSequence questGiverSpecies.

May break if the quest doesn't have example data configured. Same as /help Text. /clearscannedobjects Usage /clearscannedobjects. Resets the player's record of previously scanned objects. Will not reset quest progress for object scanning quests. Same as /help Text. /statistic Usage /statistic statName. Displays the value of the specified achievement statistic.
