        "text": "In the first scene with Will, Dennis is playing Stargate Worlds. It was a video game that was never released.\n\nThe launch code that would have launched a nuclear missile on Washington, D.C. is the same as the launch code used for the original \"War Games\" Movie, cpe1704tks.\n\nWhile going through the list of games before settling on Dead Code you can see Global Thermonuclear War.\n\nJohn Wood was sick when this movie was filmed so he was unable to reprise his role as Dr. Stephen Falken. That honor went to Gary Reineke instead and the voice of the \"WarGames\" computer, \"Joshua\", which also appears in this film (John Wood voiced it in \"WarGames\"), is now voiced by Colm Feore who also plays T. Kenneth Hassert in this film."
