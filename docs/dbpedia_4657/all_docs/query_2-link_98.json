Selected for their masterful design, these mass-produced hallmarks of the film business represent comedies, musicals, Westerns, sci-fi thrillers, dramas, and other cinematic works that date from the turn of the 20th century to the early 2000s. Posters of iconic features, such as Casablanca and The Godfather, stand alongside foreign films and memorable cult classics including Le Samouraï and Barbarella.\n\nBuy the Book"
