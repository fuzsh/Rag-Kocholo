        "text": "\"Dead reyt\", \"faff\" and \"keep gu'in\" are words you donât often see in video games.\n\nBut two pals from Yorkshire have changed all that.\n\nGod's Own Country, as the locals call it, is the inspiration for Thank Goodness You're Here!, a new game created by James Carbutt and Will Todd, from Barnsley.\n\nThe pair - aka development team Coal Supper - are the minds behind the fictional northern town of Barnsworth.\n\nPlayers pilot a tiny, silent character through a series of surreal odd-jobs given to them by local residents.\n\nIt's a deliberately weird experience, but it's also been hailed as hilariously funny and \"reyt proper Yorkshire\".\n\nOne of the first buildings players enter - the local pub, of course - has a blackboard outside advertising today's special.\n\n\"Drinks.\"\n\nIt's little touches like this, along with a script full of regional slang delivered in Yorkshire accents, that have led people to call Thank Goodness \"the most northern game ever\".\n\nBut how did it get made?\n\nWill and James, who provide voices for many characters in the game, say the distinctive script came naturally as they developed it.\n\n\"The more we worked on it, the more we started drawing out characters that just sounded more and more like us, because we're doing it in our voices,\" says Will.\n\nThe video games industry has been criticised for becoming more risk-averse and leaning into sequels and remakes as the cost of making blockbuster titles has increased.\n\nJames and Will admit that a lot of publishers were \"sceptical\" when they pitched their unique project to them.\n\n\"I think part of that was we were obviously trying to shirk traditional game design,\" says Will.\n\n\"Tropes and genres and stuff. And it wasn't necessarily super-clear what the game was going to be.\"\n\nThey say the Yorkshire setting was a bit of a hurdle too.\n\nSome of the bigger indie game publishers are US-based and Will says there are \"assumptions about what Britishness is when you're pitching for funding\".\n\n\"Colin Firth and the rain British,\" says James.\n\n\"This is more like flat caps and whippets,\" adds Will.\n\nThey eventually signed a deal with Panic! - the publisher behind mega-hit Untitled Goose Game, which cast players as a wildfowl on a mission to cause havoc in a small village.\n\nThe publisher helped them to get IT Crowd and What We Do in the Shadows actor Matt Berry - known for his deadpan baritone - on board for a bit of star power.\n\nAnd they have made some allowances for an international audience.\n\n\"There's subtitles for people from Yorkshire and subtitles for proper English - translation options for Southerners,\" says James.\n\n\"If we wrote the script in the dialect and then recorded everything, we had to go through and then put the proper English in,\" says Will.\n\nThank Goodness isn't the only high-profile game released this year to feature strong UK accents.\n\nHorror game Still Wakes the Deep, set on a North Sea oil rig in 1975, employs a mostly Scottish voice cast.\n\nCreative lead John McCormack says developers The Chinese Room agreed early on that they wanted the story of the ill-fated Beira D rig to feel \"like it actually happened\".\n\nAnd that meant no compromise on the way it sounded.\n\n\"To be authentic to the setting and the period there was only one way to do it,\" he says.\n\n\"And that was to hire the right voices for the story.\"\n\nJohn admits it will be \"hard to understand\" in places for some, but the performances help to convey the mood of a scene even when the audience doesn't understand every word.\n\n\"When you bring in realistic accents to double down on that authenticity, it just sort of solidifies the kind of sense of place,\" says John.\n\n\"So when the horror kicks in, it feels more real.\"\n\nSo far Thank Goodness You're Here! has had a positive response since its release on Thursday.\n\nBut Yorkshire lads Will and James are humble about their aspirations for it.\n\n\"It's something that we always dreamed about as kids,\" says Will.\n\n\"And I think other than massive financial success, I hope it finds an audience.\n\n\"It really is a love letter to the north and specifically our hometown.\n\n\"And we will be reaching as many of those people as possible.\n\n\"And then also an audience of 100,000 Americans.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Ãine OâDonnell."
