        "text": "ADS: Aim down sights. This occurs when you press the Aim button; doing this narrows the spread of the weapon’s fire for more accurate shots.\n\nAssist: A stat awarded to a player who deals damage to an enemy player but does not deal the finishing blow.\n\nAttachment: An item that attaches to a weapon that gives it a passive benefit and changes its appearance. An example of an attachment is a Suppressor. Weapon Platform–specific attachments are useable within a specific Weapon Platform, while Universal Attachments can be used across all Weapon Platforms. This is found within the Gunsmith menu.\n\nBoots: Normally affecting your Operators feet, Boots are a Loadout element that you can equip onto your Multiplayer Loadout.\n\nCamo/Camouflage: A “skin” that only changes the cosmetic appearance of a weapon.\n\nChannel: A place for text and voice communications. All matches have their own Channels. Private ones can be set up as well via Social features.\n\nCombatants: AI-controlled characters who either work alongside Operators or on their own; a non-faction group.\n\nDolphin Dive: Activate by proning during a sprint or Tactical Sprint, throwing your Operator forward in a dive to the prone position.\n\nDouble Weapon XP: When this state is active, you will earn weapon experience points at double the rate.\n\nDouble XP: When this state is active, you will earn experience points at double the rate for Player Level.\n\nFaction: This is the group your Operator belongs to in Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III. There are multiple factions in addition to SpecGru and KorTac. However, in Multiplayer, these are the typically teams in team-based game modes, so whichever Operator you choose within each of the primary factions is the one you will play as.\n\nField Upgrade: A piece of equipment that gives you a tactical advantage during a Multiplayer match, such as a Trophy System or Munitions Box. Field Upgrades charge during a fight.\n\nFinishing Move: A powerful melee attack that eliminates your foe, performed by holding the Melee button behind an unsuspecting enemy.\n\nGear: A Loadout element that can affect multiple things and grant your Operator miscellaneous Perks. This element is equipped onto your Multiplayer Loadout.\n\nGloves: Normally affecting your Operators hands, Gloves is a Loadout element that you can equip onto your Multiplayer Loadout.\n\nGunsmith: Within the Multiplayer Loadout menu, this is where you can customize a weapon’s attachments and cosmetic properties.\n\nHip Fire: The opposite of ADS. This is when you fire a weapon without aiming, which is faster than aiming down sights but may be less accurate.\n\nHitmarker: An onscreen visual and audio indication that your shot has made contact with an enemy Operator.\n\nKillstreak: A reward for earning a certain number of kills in one life during a Multiplayer match. Accessible in-match, this reward can be something that offers an offensive advantage (e.g., a Cluster Strike) or in-game intelligence (e.g., a UAV). An Operator can equip up to three Killstreaks. The number of kills to earn said reward is detailed within the Killstreak menu.\n\nLedge Hang: When your Operator grabs the side of an edge and holds on to it. Sometimes an Operator can mantle up from a Ledge Hang. You retain access to a pistol sidearm and can peek over the edge with ADS.\n\nLethal Equipment: Limited-per-life items that harm enemies, usually in explosive fashion. Think Claymores, Frag Grenades, C4, and more.\n\nLoadout: What an Operator brings into battle. The Loadout consists of two weapons (a primary and a secondary), two pieces of Equipment (Lethal and Tactical), and a selection of Perks.\n\nMantle: The act of going up and over a ledge or object, usually done with the same command to Jump.\n\nMinimap: An onscreen map showing your current position in the environment as well as nearby teammates and certain enemies. Crucial when planning your movement through the map.\n\nMount: Mounting fixes your weapon to a wall or ledge, allowing for more accurate fire via reduced recoil at the cost of mobility.\n\nOperator: Your character in the game. See all the Operators in MWII here.\n\nOptic: A device that offers a precise sight picture while aiming with a weapon. Some optics also offer a zoom level or even a magnification toggle, allowing you to switch between multiple zoom levels. Optics are equipped via the Gunsmith part of the Multiplayer Loadout menu.\n\nPerk (given via Vests, Gloves, Boots, and Gear): A passive ability or benefit given to your Operator within a Loadout. One example Perk is Scavenger, which you get from Scavenger Gloves. This perk allows your Operator to pick up ammo and throwing knives from dead Operators.\n\nPing: Mark an enemy or object in the environment with a distance marker that is displayed on your squad’s Tac Map and minimap.\n\nPlayer Level: A number that denotes your overall experience level.\n\nQuick Draw: The ability to gain instant access to your pistol sidearm while keeping your Primary Weapon on the ready.\n\nReload: When your Operator replaces the magazine, clip, or other ammunition in a weapon back to its full amount with replacement ammunition in reserve. The bottom right of the in-game HUD shows the current number of ammunition of the weapon (on the left side of the forward slash / ) and the total number of ammunition in reserve (on the right side of the forward slash / ), shown at the bottom right of the HUD. Your Operator will automatically reload a weapon if there is available reserve ammunition while the weapon is empty.\n\nRevive: The act of picking up a fellow Operator after they are downed, but not eliminated. Only available on certain modes.\n\nScorestreak: An alternative to Killstreaks, Scorestreaks are earned not just through eliminations but also through earning Score via playing the objective, earning assists, using Field Upgrades effectively, and performing other actions in-match.\n\nSeason: A period of time when new content, such as weapons, Multiplayer maps, and Community Events, is available to play. This is also where you will progress through Officer Ranks.\n\nShowcase (Profile): A place to show off your achievements in the form of your current Rank, as well as your Calling Cards and Emblems.\n\nTac Map: The full view of the current map, accessible in the match. Check it fast, then get back to the action.\n\nTactical Equipment: Limited-per-life and reusable items that range from intel-gathering sensors, instant healing, and disorientation devices.\n\nTactical Sprint: The fastest movement option on feet, exchanging combat readiness for all-out sprinting.\n\nThird-Person: An available Playlist variation that puts the camera behind your Operator’s shoulder. Read more about it here.\n\nVest: The Vest that you can equip within your Multiplayer Loadout. Vests grant you Perks and dictate which weapons, Gloves, Boots, and Gear you can equip.\n\nWeapon Level: A progression system separate to Player Level. Increase your Weapon Level by dealing damage and earning eliminations with that weapon to unlock attachments.\n\nWeapon Vault: The ultimate Weapon Blueprint: a variant of a weapon that keeps its cosmetic properties on all attachments native to its base platform.\n\nModes of Play\n\n1v1: A duel. Often thrown down as a challenge, especially on maps with plenty of Rust.\n\n100-Point Club: Describes when one team wins a Hardpoint match via the score limit (250) while keeping the opposition under 100 points. The losing team is then deemed a member of the “100-Point Club.”\n\nBeam: The act of hitting an accurate shot for an elimination despite the target being far away and/or mostly behind cover.\n\nChalked: When a situation is insurmountable and is nearing a finite end (e.g., “chalk one up”). However, we believe it’s never chalked.\n\nClutch: When a player or players win an engagement despite having a disadvantage in the number of active players on their side.\n\nCollateral: When a single bullet eliminates more than one enemy.\n\nCross-Map: Describing a shot or equipment throw that goes the full length (or at least 85% of) the map.\n\nDrop Shot: Rapidly changing your Operator’s stance from standing to prone while firing in order to throw off your enemy’s aim.\n\nEgo Challenge: The act of a player entering a disadvantageous situation believing they can win.\n\nFirst Blood: An accolade awarded to the Operator who lands the first elimination in a match.\n\nFlank: When you take a side path (either left or right) to confront the enemy.\n\nFlinch: The force an Operator feels when damaged, affecting their aim.\n\nFrying/Cracked: Two common terms for when a player is doing extremely well in-game.\n\nHardpoint: The “hill” or “zone” where points are scored.\n\nK/D Ratio: The number of kills earned divided by the number of deaths. This ratio is often also attached to the number of assists, but not calculated into the ratio itself.\n\nKill Trade: An instance whereby one player eliminates an enemy and then is eliminated by the enemy’s squadmate, thereby “trading” eliminations.\n\nLane: A main way through the entirety of a Multiplayer map. Most often, maps have a “mid” path, with other ones surrounding this central route.\n\nLobby: The pre-match area in a Playlist before entering a game.\n\nNinja Defuse: Disarming the bomb in Search & Destroy as the last defending player while the attacking team is alive.\n\nOne-Shot: A designation in common communications given to someone who is supposedly one hit away from an elimination (usually this is never the case).\n\nPre-Aim: Aiming down sights as you round a corner, so as to be ready for any immediate engagements when entering the new area.\n\nPress F: The proper way to pay respects.\n\nRotation/Rotating: What players use to describe the change of Hardpoint locations, or the act of getting to the next objective before the current one expires. Alternatively used to describe a set of Hardpoints.\n\nScrap Time: The final 5–10 seconds of an active Hardpoint.\n\nSend/Push: Moving toward a point. For example, “Send it toward X,” “Full Sending,” “Push them” means rushing toward that point despite any danger present or perceived.\n\nSpawn Location: Where your Operator loads into the map, either in the beginning of a round or after a death.\n\nSquad Spawn: The process of respawning on the position of a fellow squadmate rather than on an objective or at a base. Available in Ground War mode.\n\nM.G.B.: Earn 30 eliminations without dying to earn a match-ending win via the Tactical Nuke. Warning: Eliminations earned via streaks do not count toward the required 30 eliminations.\n\nTriple Cap: The state where one team has captured all three flags in the Domination game mode.\n\nUse this short glossary, as well as our Call of Duty®: Modern Warfare® III Getting Started guide for the basic training you need to excel in Modern Warfare® III."
