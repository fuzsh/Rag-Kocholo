        "text": "There’s a brand new Alien movie on the way from Evil Dead and Don’t Breathe director Fede Alvarez this year, and, per Deadline, it’s officially been given the title Alien: Romulus.\n\nAlien: Romulus is currently set to launch into theaters on August 16, 2024.\n\nAccording to star Cailee Spaeny (The Craft: Legacy, Pacific Rim Uprising) in a recent chat with Variety, the Alien: Romulus movie takes place in between the first two films.\n\n“It’s supposed to slot in between the first movie and the second movie,” Spaeny tells the outlet. “They brought the same team from Aliens, the James Cameron film. The same people who built those xenomorphs actually came on and built ours.\n\n“So getting to see the original design with the original people who have been working on these films for 45-plus years and has been so much of their life has been really incredible.”\n\nThe project has been described as “an original standalone feature,” one that “will focus on a group of young people on a distant world.” Spaeny leads the cast alongside Isabela Merced, David Jonsson, Archie Renaux, Spike Fearn and Aileen Wu.\n\nFede Alvarez co-wrote the script with Rodo Sayagues (Evil Dead). Ridley Scott is on board as producer for the film, the first movie in the franchise to be released by Disney.\n\nIt turns out that Ridley Scott is a fan of the upcoming installment.\n\nAlvarez explained during a conversation with Guillermo del Toro at the recent DGA Latino Summit 2023 that he was nervous about Ridley Scott watching the film for the first time.\n\nAlvarez tells del Toro, “And then he walks into the room and [he said], ‘Fede, what can I say? It’s fucking great.’”\n\n“My family knows it was one of the best moments of my life to have a master like him, who I admired so much, to even watch a movie I made but particularly something like this… and talk to me for an hour about what he liked about it,” Alvarez adds. “One of the best compliments he said was, ‘The dialogue is great. Are you the writer?’ Yes!“\n\nThe exciting news sounds like the Alien marketing tour is about to commence, which means that more details on Alvarez’s vision should arrive soon."
