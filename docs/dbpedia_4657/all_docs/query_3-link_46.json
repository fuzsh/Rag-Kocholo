To turn off your move cheat, just type bb.moveobjects again and it will go back to normal. To turn off all cheats type testingcheats false in the bar.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nI FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT. Ctrl+9 wasn’t working for me, nor just 9. But I finally figured out why.\n\nI had resized the item using the brackets [ ]\n\nand apparently you have to put the item down after doing that, before you are able to use ctrl+9 to move it up."
