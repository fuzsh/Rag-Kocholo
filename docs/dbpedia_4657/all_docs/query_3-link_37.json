        "text": "in the GUI~Editor, the 'object counter' refers to this stuff below:\n\nin the GUI~Editor, you can choose these scripts:\n\nrun as script -> add a script -> variables -> 'increase~decrease object counter' Script\n\nwhich will ONLY increase or decrease (addition~subtraction only) by 1\n\nin code, it looks like this:\n\nObject_name.Attribute_name = Object_name.Attribute_name + 1 ~OR~ Object_name.Attribute_name = Object_name.Attribute_name - 1\n\nexample:\n\nplayer.strength = player.strength + 1 ~OR~ player.strength = player.strength - 1\n\nif you want to increase~decrease by more than 1 and~or want to use multiplication~division, then you got to choose this script in the GUI~Editor:\n\n(I don't know the GUI~Editor's drop down choices very well, so I just use the [expression] and type in the code directly, lol. So this is the way I'm going to show you to do it, if you don't want to use the [expression] drop down choice to type in the code directly, than you got to figure out what drop down choices you use, as I'm just not familiar with them, sorry)\n\nrun as script -> add a script -> variables -> 'set a variable or attribute' Script -> (see below, an example) Multiplication Operator: * Division Operator: / Modulus (same as division, but it returns the remainder instead) Operator: % set variable player.strength = [expression] player.strength * 7 ~OR~ set variable player.strength = [expression] player.strength / 3 ~OR~ set variable game.minutes = [expression] game.turns % 60\n\nin code:\n\nplayer.strength = player.strength * 7 ~OR~ player.strength = player.strength / 3 ~OR~ game.minutes = game.turns % 60\n\nhow math computational expressions work CONCEPTUALLY ONLY:\n\n(this is not actual code syntax!)\n\n(using addition as the example)"
