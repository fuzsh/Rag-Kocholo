However, this fell way short. I felt like I was being tossed around from scene to scene ... It just had absolutely NO flow. The text disappeared so fast, I was barely able to read it. Objects were sometimes impossible to place. I knew they belonged where they were going, but I couldn't get them in. At one point it took me 5 minutes to get the object where I wanted. I found a lot of the puzzles \"glitchy\" and irritating. I paid for the game, so I forced myself to finish. But I have to say, I found myself wanting this game to end not even a quarter of the way through. Recently any game I have purchased from EIPIX has been a huge disappointment for me."
