        "text": "Iconic posters from cinema history\n\nFrom the first French posters at the end of the 19th century to the movie posters of today, the history of posters is intertwined with that of cinema in particular and the visual arts in general. Until the Second World War, posters were one of the main methods for advertising films and played a decisive role in their success. Over the years, many of these posters have become collector’s items.\n\nThe origins of the movie poster\n\nThe first film posters appeared in France around the end of the 19th century when cinema was in its infancy. Jules Chéret and Marcellin Auzolle began advertising the Lumière brothers’ invention using lithographs with an Art Nouveau style that featured vibrant colours and characters illustrated down to the finest details.\n\nThe so-called “painters of cinema” were tasked with representing the film through an attractive illustration that would catch the eye of passers-by. Detailed depictions of audiences and scenes from the film told the public the type of genre it belonged to (comedy, adventure etc.) and whether the release was suitable for all the family.\n\nIn this period, a stock poster was often used, to which was then added information about a particular film. Below is a famous stock poster by Adrien Barrère.\n\nMovie poster distribution in the USA\n\nWith the rise of Hollywood after the First World War and the first full-length films, posters started featuring the cast (or the star), the director’s name, the film’s title and a plot summary. They continued to be printed using colour lithography, the only technique capable of producing high-quality illustrations at the time, albeit expensively. Posters often carried portraits of the cast, but for stars like Charlie Chaplin, Marlene Dietrich, Marylin Monroe or Audrey Hepburn, the entire poster was given over to their picture, giving rise to the star system.\n\nIconic posters from cinema history\n\nIn fifties America, directors like Otto Preminger, Billy Wilder and Alfred Hitchcock started making and promoting their films independently with the help of Saul Bass. This American designer began creating the entire visual identity for their films, from opening and closing credits to posters. In doing so, he introduced a completely new style of minimalist and highly suggestive design. For the first time in film poster history, Bass managed to capture the meaning of films through a symbolic language of bold primary colours and geometric shapes.\n\nOne of his most famous pieces of work is the title sequence for Otto Preminger’s 1959 film “Anatomy of a Murder”. Set to the rhythm of a jazz score, parts of a body outline slide on and off the screen, highlighting the credits as they go. Bass used the same graphic design concept for the film’s poster.\n\nEven more famous are the title sequences and posters he produced for the Hitchcock films “Vertigo”, “North by Northwest” and “Psycho”. Bass’s striking graphic design undoubtedly contributed to this success of these directors.\n\nForties and fifties’ Italy saw the birth of the neorealist movement: directors like Luchino Visconti, Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini portrayed the lives of ordinary Italians in the aftermath of the Second World War. For these films, Italian poster designers opted for watercolour illustrations that showed scenes from the film, or a loose representation of the plot. Anselmo Ballester and Ercole Brini designed some of the era’s most recognisable posters. In the poster for “Bicycle Thieves”, Brini deliberately chose a “tender” image with soft colours to offset the harsh reality shown in the movie.\n\nIn the sixties, competition from television pushed Hollywood directors be more ambitious and devote ever bigger budgets to films in an attempt to fill cinemas. It was during this decade that British artist Philip Castle introduced a completely new technique to the world of poster design: airbrush. This tool allowed artists to create very sharp and detailed images, perfect for the raw realism of films like Stanley Kubrick’s “A Clockwork Orange” and “Full Metal Jacket”, two of the most iconic movie posters of all time – and both designed by Castle.\n\nIn the following decade, American illustrator Bob Peak also used an airbrush to design posters for some of the most famous films of the seventies, from “Apocalypse Now” to “Star Trek”.\n\nThe photographic poster"
