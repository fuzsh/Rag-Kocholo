        "text": "In a career that spans nearly four decades at three design agencies, Dawn Baillie has worked on some of the most iconic and beloved posters in modern cinematic history. Few designers can claim something as recognizable as Dirty Dancing as their first professional project. Fewer still have the litany of award-winning masterpieces in their portfolios that have been a running thread throughout her career. From Silence of the Lambs to Little Miss Sunshine, Dawn Baillie has designed and art directed posters that stand out for their remarkable simplicity and unconventional execution, a reserved and intellectual blend that leaves the viewer curious and eager to see a film.\n\nAs a founding partner of BLT Communications, Dawn and her team continue to be hired by various movie studio creative executives and filmmakers to collaborate on images that serve as branding for a film through movie posters and advertising campaigns. This exhibition chronicles not only her impressive career from junior designer to creative director, but also serves to showcase the evolution of the production of movie posters of the past 35 years, from paste-ups to the introduction of computer technology."
