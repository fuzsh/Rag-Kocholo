This is most commonly found in dodge or sidestep moves, but can also be found in more generalized animations for opening doors or operating switches.\n\nIntegrated I/O - A computer hardware design approach in which the data storage solution (such as an SSD) is integrated directly into the main processing board, allowing for rapid transfer of data storage into RAM.\n\nInvasion - A style of multiplayer in which players can invade the otherwise single-player game worlds of one another to engage in combat.\n\nInvisible walls - Often found at the far edges of levels or maps, 'invisible walls' are impassable boundaries at the edge of the playspace which stop the player venturing further, even when there is nothing to stop them.

Difficulty will normally be increased, or new elements potentially added as part of NG+.\n\nOP - A shorthand for 'overpowered', 'OP' refers to particular in-game abilities, weapons or playstyles which are considerably more effective than others.

Sometimes referred to as 'RT', it is most often used to render shadows, reflections, ambient shading and 'bounce lighting' in real-time. Ray-tracing is very computationally expensive and is typically reserved for more powerful hardware.\n\nResolution - Refers to the effective density of pixelsin a digital image: the higher the resolution, the more dense, detailed and clear the image. See also: 'Frame-buffer'\n\nRP - An acronym for 'role-playing', RP refers to the act of playing an in-game character within the strict bounds of a personality or back-story you've assigned to them.
