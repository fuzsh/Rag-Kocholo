        "text": "79 Iconic Harry Potter Quotes About Life, Love, and Loss\n\nWe solemnly swear the nostalgia is REAL.\n\nLooking for the best Harry Potter quotes that capture the magic of the series? The motley crew of wizards and witches at Hogwarts taught us about life, love, acceptance, friendship, death, and bravery from our book shelves and on the big screen, leaving us dozens of quotes and moments that still hold up to this day. If you couldn’t keep from smiling when you saw Harry, Hermione, and Ron reunite in the Gryffindor Common Room IRL and still get emotional when you think about the Battle of Hogwarts, you’re definitely not alone.\n\nWhether this is your first or thousandth time reading these lines, they’re sure to speak to something inside you — something that challenges you to be courageous in the face of adversity, but also confirms that love and friendship are the most precious things in this world, and the most magical. Read on to discover the 79 most iconic Harry Potter quotes of all time.\n\nIn this story:\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Quotes\n\nHarry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\nBeing our first introduction to the wizarding world and its beloved cast of characters, it’s no surprise that some of the most memorable Harry Potter sayings come from Sorcerer’s Stone. While it has an inviting, almost storybook-like vibe, the first installment of Harry’s magical journey imparts some deep lessons — the importance of friendship, the value of humility (even if you’re The Boy Who Lived), the dangers of excessive desire, and sometimes, that it’s necessary to break the rules.\n\n\"Yer a wizard Harry.\" ― Rubeus Hagrid\n\n\"I hope you're pleased with yourselves. We could all have been killed — or worse, expelled. Now if you don't mind, I'm going to bed.\" ― Hermione Granger\n\n\"It does not do well to dwell on dreams and forget to live.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"To the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"You're a little scary sometimes, you know that? Brilliant... but scary.\" — Ron Weasley\n\n\"There will be no foolish wand-waving or silly incantations in this class. As such, I don't expect many of you to appreciate the subtle science and exact art that is potion-making. However, for those select few who possess the predisposition, I can teach you how to bewitch the mind and ensnare the senses. I can tell you how to bottle fame, brew glory, and even put a stopper in death. Then again, maybe some of you have come to Hogwarts in possession of abilities so formidable that you feel confident enough to not pay attention!\" — Severus Snape\n\n\"It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no visible sign… to have been loved so deeply, even though the person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is in your very own skin.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"As much money and life as you could want! The two things most human beings would choose above all – the trouble is, humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"There are some things you can’t share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.\"\n\n\"Ah, music. A magic beyond all we do here!\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\nHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\n\nOur heroes’ second year at Hogwarts is certainly no less action packed than their first, and finds them navigating new challenges within a more hostile school environment. Chamber of Secrets is the first time the series tackles prejudice in a major way, as the mysterious “heir of Slytherin” threatens to wipe out any students it deems “mudbloods,” or people from muggle-born backgrounds. Not only does the book teach the importance of tolerance of people who are different — it also stresses the importance of community and reliable friendships, as virtually no task in the book is accomplished by a single person alone.\n\n\"Fear of a name only increases fear of the thing itself.\" — Hermione Granger\n\n\"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Dobby is free.\" — Dobby\n\n\"Training for the ballet, Potter?\" — Draco Malfoy\n\n\"I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not there.\" — Harry Potter\n\n\"Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in the wizarding world.\" — Ron Weasley\n\n\"When in doubt, go to the library.\" — Ron Weasley\n\n\"Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Phoenixes burst into flame when it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Fame is a fickle friend, Harry. Celebrity is as celebrity does. Remember that.\" — Gilderoy Lockhart\n\n\"Honestly, if you were any slower, you’d be going backward.\" — Draco Malfoy\n\nHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\n\nThe third book in the series marks a significant vibe shift from the first two — it’s much darker, with a more ominous tone overall. As Harry, Ron, and Hermione start their respective coming-of-age arcs, Prisoner of Azkaban covers some equally mature life lessons that ring true to our own world. The wrongful imprisonment of Sirius Black illustrates how unjust our legal systems are, and Professor Lupin’s struggles as a werewolf symbolizes the duality of man. In a world where nothing is ever initially what it seems, it’s important to look twice to discover the truth.\n\n\"I solemnly swear I am up to no good.\" ― Harry Potter\n\n\"'I’m not going to be murdered,’ Harry said out loud. ‘That’s the spirit, dear,’ said his mirror sleepily.\"\n\n\"Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Don’t let the muggles get you down.\" — Ron Weasley\n\n\"I want to commit the murder I was imprisoned for.\" — Sirius Black\n\n\"Are you insane? Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? When can I move in?\" — Harry Potter\n\n\"Why, dear boy, we don’t send wizards to Azkaban just for blowing up their aunts.\" — Cornelius Fudge\n\n\"You think the dead we loved truly ever leave us? You think that we don’t recall them more clearly in times of great trouble?\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Mischief Managed!\" — Harry Potter\n\nHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\n\nFirst crushes, school dances, and hormonally-fueled awkwardness — who can relate? Not even our wizarding trio can escape puberty, and Goblet of Fire finds them tackling the perils of adulthood amidst the Triwizard Tournament. While shabby dress robes, painful forehead scars, and the first inklings of sexual tension between Ron and Hermione constitute real challenges for our three heroes, the fourth book quickly offers more pressing concerns: Voldemort is back, and his murder of Cedric Diggory marks the first time Harry experiences death in real-time.\n\n\"If you want to know what a man’s like, take a good look at how he treats his inferiors, not his equals.\" — Sirius Black\n\n\"I am what I am, an' I'm not ashamed. 'Never be ashamed,' my ol' dad used ter say, 'there's some who'll hold it against you, but they're not worth botherin' with.'\" — Rubeus Hagrid\n\n\"It matters not what someone is born, but what they grow to be.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Twitchy little ferret, aren’t you, Malfoy?\" — Hermione Granger\n\n\"Your devotion is nothing more than cowardice. You would not be here if you had anywhere else to go.\" — Voldemort\n\n\"Numbing the pain for a while will make it worse when you finally feel it.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Anyone can speak Troll. All you have to do is point and grunt.\" — Fred Weasley\n\n\"Curiosity is not a sin…. But we should exercise caution with our curiosity… yes, indeed.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"We are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Just because it’s taken you three years to notice, Ron, doesn’t mean no one else has spotted I’m a girl!\" — Hermione Granger\n\n\"Differences of habit and language are nothing at all if our aims are identical and our hearts are open.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\n\nFor all that Order of the Phoenix features some of the funniest Harry Potter quotes, the book takes on some intense themes. As the wizarding world becomes more corrupt, Harry, Ron, and Hermione officially jump from childhood and start using their magic to influence events. When Dolores Umbridge takes control of Hogwarts and renders their Defense Against the Dark Arts class useless, our heroes band together to teach themselves and their classmates the required skills to help fight Voldemort. Unity is of the utmost importance, and not only is education empowerment — it’s often the strongest weapon of them all.\n\n\"Accio Brain!\" — Ron Weasley\n\n\"I think we've outgrown full-time education ... Time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?\" — Fred Weasley\n\n\"The mind is not a book, to be opened at will and examined at leisure. Thoughts are not etched on the inside of skulls, to be perused by an invader. The mind is a complex and many-layered thing.\" — Severus Snape\n\n\"I think I'll just go down and have some pudding and wait for it all to turn up — it always does in the end.\" ― Luna Lovegood\n\n\"Just because you have the emotional range of a teaspoon doesn't mean we all have.\" ― Hermione Granger\n\n\"You can laugh, but people used to believe there were no such things as the Blibbering Humdinger or the Crumple-Horned Snorkack!\" ― Luna Lovegood\n\n\"I mean, it's sort of exciting, isn't it, breaking the rules?\" — Hermione Granger\n\n\"We’ve all got both light and dark inside us. What matters is the part we choose to act on. That’s who we really are.\" ― Sirius Black\n\n\"Indifference and neglect often do much more damage than outright dislike.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Things we lose have a way of coming back to us in the end, if not always in the way we expect.\" ― Luna Lovegood\n\n\"Youth can not know how age thinks and feels. But old men are guilty if they forget what it was to be young.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Wit beyond measure is man’s greatest treasure.\" — Luna Lovegood\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\n\nAs the penultimate book in the series, Half-Blood Prince builds on the recurring idea that there is light and dark within all of us. From Harry and Dumbledore forgoing their own peace and safety in search of Voldemort’s horcruxes to Dumbledore literally sacrificing his life, the book stresses the power of self-sacrifice. Trust is another key element of the plot, as seen in Harry’s enduring loyalty to his friends and allies, as well as Dumbelore’s unconditional trust in Snape, which Harry is forced to accept even in the darkest of hours.\n\n\"The thing about growing up with Fred and George is that you sort of start thinking anything's possible if you've got enough nerve.\" — Ginny Weasley\n\n\"And now, Harry, let us step out into the night and pursue that flighty temptress, adventure.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Dumbledore says people find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.\" — Hermione Granger\n\n\"Harry was left to ponder in silence the depths to which girls would sink to get revenge.\"\n\n\"You’re just as sane as I am.\" —Luna Lovegood\n\n\"I am a wizard, not a baboon brandishing a stick.\" — Seamus Finnigan\n\n\"Age is foolish and forgetful when it underestimates youth.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Once again, you show all the sensitivity of a blunt axe.\" — Nearly Headless Nick\n\n\"It is the unknown we fear when we look upon death and darkness, nothing more.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\nHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\n\nThe final chapter of the Harry Potter series is endlessly quotable, and it’s no wonder: we’ve arrived at the final, all-out battle between good and evil, and there’s no shortage of epic moments. Deathly Hallows explores different aspects of death: from the difficulty of loving the dead, as evidenced by all the family members Harry has lost and Snape’s enduring love for Lily Potter; to the importance of keeping faith with the dead, as our heroes continue to do what Dumbledore asked of them even in moments of doubt. Friendships are challenged, whether during the search for Voldemort’s remaining horcruxes or when Harry literally falls in love with his best friend’s sister, but ultimately prevail. The last book teaches that courage can come from surprising places (we see you, Neville Longbottom) and that second chances are important — always.\n\n\"It is the quality of one’s convictions that determines success, not the number of followers.\" —Remus Lupin\n\n\"I’m going to keep going until I succeed—or I die. Don’t think I don’t know how this might end. I’ve known it for years.\" — Harry Potter\n\n\"That wand’s more trouble than it’s worth. And quite honestly, I’ve had enough trouble for a lifetime.\" — Harry Potter\n\n\"We’re all human, aren’t we? Every human life is worth the same, and worth saving.\" — Kingsley Shacklebolt\n\n\"‘Does it hurt?’ The childish question had escaped Harry's lips before he could stop it. ‘Dying? Not at all,’ said Sirius. ‘Quicker and easier than falling asleep.’\"\n\n\"He can run faster than Severus Snape confronted with shampoo.\" — Fred Weasley\n\n\"‘Ron, you know full well Harry and I were brought up by Muggles!’ said Hermione. ‘We didn’t hear stories like that when we were little, we heard ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ and ‘Cinderella’ —’ ‘What’s that, an illness?’ asked Ron.\"\n\n\"Words are, in my not-so-humble opinion, our most inexhaustible source of magic. Capable of both inflicting injury, and remedying it.\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"Not my daughter, you b*tch!\" ― Molly Weasley\n\n\"And Percy was shaking his brother, and Ron was kneeling beside them, and Fred's eyes stared without seeing, the ghost of his last laugh still etched upon his face.\"\n\n\"It is a curious thing, Harry, but perhaps those who are best suited to power are those who have never sought it. Those who, like you, have leadership thrust upon them, and take up the mantle because they must, and find to their own surprise that they wear it well.\" — Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"I've always wanted to use that spell.\" ― Minerva McGonagall\n\n\"Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real?\" ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n“Do not pity the dead, Harry. Pity the living, and, above all, those who live without love.” ― Albus Dumbledore\n\n\"‘Why are they all staring?’ demanded Albus as he and Rose craned around to look at the other students. ‘Don’t let it worry you,’ said Ron. ‘It’s me. I’m extremely famous.’\"\n\n“Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. ‘After all this time?’ ‘Always,’ said Snape.”\""
