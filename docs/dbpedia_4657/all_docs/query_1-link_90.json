Deathgarden has more quality of life features and options than Dead by Daylight. I would greatly appreciate it if I could change individual settings in-game (and have them actually work when I do it) instead of changing a text file and gambling if it does anything. Plus, can we please get other technical bugs relating to the connection fixed? I'm tired of getting infinite loading screens after every single game I play. It was fine before the \"fix\" for it a while back, but since then I get an infinite loading screen nearly every time I finish a match.\n\nThis is my vote for Behavior to update the game technically and fix it as opposed to more licenses for movie killers. I know I will go unheard, but I will still make sure I said something."
