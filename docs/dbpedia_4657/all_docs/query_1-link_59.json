        "text": "Based on the wildly successful book series from J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings has become one of the most popular book and movie series in existence. In fact, there's still more to come for fans to anticpate, from upcoming LOTR movies to new games alike; including a new Magic the Gathering LOTR collection coming this holiday season.\n\nWritten as a fantastical version of his own life and the influences his surroundings had on him, The Hobbit and the famed LOTR trilogy were strongly inspired by life events and teachings that Tolkien found interesting. Starting out with The Hobbit–a children's book he was inspired to write–was just the beginning of the densely canonized world Tolkien would build. Elements of his stories from The Lord of the Rings books were later conceived; inspired by the great goods and evils in his life during World War I. From his background in philology, he was able to construct multiple languages that would form the different societies and races of Middle Earth–Elves, Orcs, and Dwarves. With such a strong background in language studies and some strong influences from Beowulf (the highest achievement of Old English literature), it’s no surprise that the books–and in turn, the movies–would carry some profound, imaginative, and quotable phrases for its fans to enjoy.\n\nWhile the quotes are many, there will always be a quote that resonates differently with each audience member. This is to say that though a quote may not represent a moment of importance for some, it is a wholly memorable experience for others. Here are my top 31 quotes from LOTR, in no particular order.\n\n“Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.” — Galadriel, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe inspiringly charming words of the powerful Galadriel are as indelible as the first time: anyone can make a difference no matter the size.\n\n“One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” — Gandalf, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nIn a moment of horrific realization, Gandalf recites the words engraved on the one ring to Frodo, quickly accepting the reality of the situation.\n\n“I made a promise, Mr Frodo. A promise. \"Don't you leave him Samwise Gamgee.\" And I don't mean to. I don't mean to.” — Sam, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nA character that started out as underrated in the early days of the film's releases, Samwise Gamgee defies expectations by staying true to his word and to his traveling companion.\n\n“You shall not pass!” — Gandalf, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nDefinitely one of the most quoted lines from the entire saga, Gandalf's epic defiance of the Balrog on the Bridge of Khazad-dûm became unforgettable with the release of the very first movie trailer.\n\n“It’s mine. My own. My precious.” — Bilbo, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nThe beginning of Gandalf’s suspicions of Bilbo and the ring, Bilbo begins to act out of character and overly defensive after the thought of parting ways with his ‘precious’.\n\n“I would have gone with you to the end, into the very fires of Mordor.” — Aragorn, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nIn a true display of honor and loyalty, Aragorn closes Frodo’s hand around the ring, knowing that even he would fall victim to its whispers.\n\n“We can not get out... they are coming.” — Gandalf, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nLeading up to the epic battle of Moria, Gandalf reads from the journal of a Dwarf trapped inside the very room they are in.\n\n“This task was appointed to you. And if you do not find a way, no one will.” — Galadriel, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nIn the same vein as a quote from earlier, Galadriel firmly nudges this earth-shattering concept to Frodo, who must now carry the ring to Mordor.\n\n“They have a cave troll.” — Boromir, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nOne of the more comedically-toned moments in the series, Boromir experiences true, hysteric fear as he realizes what their small group of soldiers are up against.\n\n“Fool of a Took!” — Gandalf, The Fellowship of the Ring\n\nShortly after Pippin unintentionally sparks the battle of Moria, Gandalf finds it necessary to shame him for his family name and the reputation they carry.\n\n“Where was Gondor when the Westfold fell?” — Theoden, The Two Towers\n\nQuoted by some of the more versed fans of the books and movies, this is the beginning of many of Theoden’s well-written and delivered lines in the series.\n\n“What's taters, precious? What's taters, eh?” — Smeagol, The Two Towers\n\nA bit of a silly moment in the sequel, this quote has become a massive hit in internet culture with dozens of original songs and hundreds of memes to commemorate it.\n\n“They’re taking the Hobbits to Isengard!” — Legolas, The Two Towers\n\nAnother quote that has been turned into an original song and video, Legolas uses his ‘Elf eyes’ to see where the Uruk-hai are taking the Hobbits.\n\n\"I always liked going south. Somehow, it feels like going downhill.\" — Treebeard, The Two Towers\n\nA most pleasant creature in the series, Treebeard shows his true character by speaking slowly and patiently about something simple that pleases him.\n\n“Be silent. Keep your forked tongue behind your teeth.” — Gandalf, The Two Towers\n\nGreeting Grima Wormtongue in any context is not something to look forward to, which is why Gandalf greets him with a silver-tongued demand that simultaneously stings.\n\n“Looks like meat’s back on the menu, boys!” — Ugluk, The Two Towers\n\nMade known by the very unknown character Ugluk, this one is able to be quoted in many scenarios by outright fans looking to connect with others.\n\n“Let this be the hour when we draw swords together. Fell deeds awake. Now for wrath, now for ruin, and the red dawn. Forth, Eorlingas!” — Theoden, The Two Towers\n\nAnother show-stealing quote from Theoden, he leads the charge out of the gates of Helm’s Deep into an almost-certain death.\n\n“Saruman! A wizard should know better.” — Treebeard, The Two Towers\n\nA potentially emotional line delivery for environmentalists, Treebeard follows this dialogue up with a forest-shaking roar that summons the Ents to war.\n\n“I cannot jump the distance, you’ll have to toss me.” — Gimli, The Two Towers\n\nIn a moment of pure vulnerability, Gimli is forced to ask for help and requests that Legolas never finds out.\n\n“A red sun rises. Blood has been spilt this night.” — Legolas, The Two Towers\n\nThe king of poetic and almost ridiculously dramatic line deliveries, Legolas presumes that many have died because of the color of the sunrise.\n\n“So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate?” — Theoden, The Two Towers\n\nA line that seems pulled out of the very trenches of World War I, Theoden questions the worth of all their efforts to fight evil.\n\n“The Beacons of Minas Tirith! The Beacons are lit! Gondor calls for aid.” — Aragorn, Return of the King\n\nA signal that harkens back to betrayals from the past, Aragorn insists that Rohan answer the call for help despite it.\n\n“Death is just another path. One that we all must take.” — Gandalf, Return of the King\n\nLikely one of the most touching moments in the saga, this is just a snippet of Gandalf’s glorious description of the afterlife he has seen.\n\n“I am no man.” — Eowyn, The Return of the King\n\nIn a Joan of Arc fashion, Eowyn rips off her helmet to reveal she is a woman before destroying the Witch King of Angmar.\n\n“Authority is not given to you to deny the return of the king.” — Gandalf, The Return of the King\n\nAdded for its direct quotation of the title, Gandalf asserts his words as the force of logic and honor in the halls of Minas Tirith.\n\n“The way is shut. It was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it. The way is shut.” — Legolas, The Return of the King\n\nQuoted up to three times in this movie, the quote is memorable simply because of that.\n\n“I can’t carry it for you, but I can carry you.” — Sam, The Return of the King\n\nA moment of triumph for all (but especially for Sam), Sam picks up Frodo to carry him the rest of the way up Mount Doom.\n\n“She’s always hungry. She always needs to feed.” — Gollum, The Return of the King\n\nSpeaking of the terrifyingly large Spider in the path to Mordor, Shelob, Gollum tells Smeagol about her eating habits and the 100% certainty that she will eat the two Hobbits carrying the ring.\n\n“It's the deep breath before the plunge.” — Gandalf, The Return of the King\n\nFaced with a distant view of Mordor and Minas Morgul, Gandalf mentally prepares for the bloody mess that war brings to all.\n\n“That still only counts as one!” — Gimli, The Return of the King\n\nA continued bit in the series where Gimli and Legolas compete by shouting out how many enemies they’ve killed, Gimli attempts to save face after Legolas takes down an Oliphaunt and the many crewmen on board.\n\n“For Frodo.” — Aragorn, The Return of the King\n\nIn a last-ditch effort to distract Sauron and the forces of Mordor away from Frodo and Sam, Aragorn re-affirms their mission before being the first to charge into impossible odds.\n\nFor more LOTR, see the fantasy books, where to watch all LOTR movies, the reading list of Lord of the Rings books in order, and how to watch LOTR movies in order.
