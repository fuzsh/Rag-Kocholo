        "text": "This year is Captain America’s 81st anniversary! Steve Rogers serves as one of the most important members of the Avengers both in the comics and the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He’s been leading the way since 1941 in Captain America Comics #1.\n\nEven with his super hero abilities, Steve Rogers remains one of the more relatable heroes Marvel has to offer. He knows what it is to be bullied and to have to fight and lose on a regular basis. These Steve Rogers quotes are inspirational because no matter what happens, he continues to fight for what he believes in and for those he loves.\n\nTo celebrate the Captain America Day anniversary, here are some of Captain America’s (or Steve Roger’s) best quotes from Avengers and the MCU that capture who he really is at heart.\n\n“I don’t like bullies; I don’t care where they’re from.”\n\n– Captain America: The First Avenger\n\nSteve tries once again to join the army, and instead of receiving the usual denial that he had received so many times before, he meets Dr. Erskine. Recognizing that his first candidate had been a grave mistake, Dr. Erskine decides to be more selective about which qualities his potential super soldier will possess.\n\nHe asks if Steve wants to kill Nazis. Steve, who knows all too well what it is to be on the receiving end of bullying, shows his true nature with this answer. With this iconic Steve Rogers quote, Dr. Erskine recognizes that he has found what he was looking for: a good man.\n\n“On your left.”\n\n– Captain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nSteve is a humble, good-hearted man, but he still likes to have some fun. Although this phrase is generally a common courtesy to let fellow runners know that you will be passing them from behind, Steve cheekily says this to Sam Wilson every time that he passes him. Steve recognizes that his abilities make him superhuman and has no problem having some light-hearted fun with it from time to time.\n\nPhrases repeated back and forth are clearly a staple of having a close friendship with Steve Rogers; Sam says this back to Steve when he wakes up in the hospital at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier and again to great emotional effect when returning in Avengers: Endgame.\n\n“I’m just a kid from Brooklyn.”\n\n– Captain America: The First Avenger\n\nJohann Schmidt, the villain also known as Red Skull, uses his first true face-to-face confrontation with Captain America to inquire about what makes Steve so special.\n\nSteve demonstrates exactly why Dr. Erskine chose him to receive the super soldier serum with this humble reply. Steve never wanted the serum for glory or renown; he wanted to be able to do his part.\n\n“Language!”\n\n– Avengers: Age of Ultron\n\nThis line is one fans continue to have fun quoting. As the Avengers engage their enemies in battle, Tony swears in frustration.\n\nSteve, ever the moral compass of the group, chides him for his word choice. Iron Man, true to form, goes on to mock him for this later on in the movie when Steve uses some “language” himself.\n\n“That is America’s ass.”\n\n– Avengers: Endgame\n\nSteve is often mission-oriented, and at times, can seem woefully serious. He does, however, have moments of levity. After besting his 2012 self in hand-to-hand combat, Steve pauses for a moment to survey himself before carrying on with the mission.\n\nSteve says this Avengers: Endgame quote as he recognizes the truth in Scott Lang’s earlier statement regarding his physique. For all of his stoicism and humility, Steve can still recognize what he has to offer the world with his skillset, and, in this case, his physical assets.\n\n“I can do this all day.”\n\n– Captain America: The First Avenger / Captain America: Civil War / Avengers: Endgame\n\nWhether it’s standing up to his enemy or fighting a former ally, if there’s one thing you can count on Steve Rogers for, it’s that he will never give up. This line is only said four times throughout the MCU films, but it became so synonymous with Steve Rogers that it is used for comical effect in Avengers: Endgame when Steve faces off against his 2012 self.\n\nEven when Steve is not verbalizing this sentiment, he is embodying it. Every time he is knocked to the ground he gets up and prepares for another round. It doesn’t matter if it’s a fight in an alley or facing Thanos’ army all on his own; Steve never backs down from a chance to fight for what is right.\n\n“I’m with you ’til the end of the line.”\n\n– Captain America: The Winter Soldier\n\nOne of the most important relationships in Steve’s life is his friendship with Bucky Barnes, and no inspirational Captain America quote encapsulates the bond these two men share better than this one. Bucky was the first one to say this, letting Steve know after his mother’s death that he would always be there to support him.\n\nWhile everyone else recognizes Bucky for the threat he now is as the Winter Soldier and believes that he is beyond saving, Steve cannot let go of the profound, deep-running loyalty he has for his friend. As Bucky overpowers Steve in a brutal fight aboard one of the Helicarriers, it is Steve saying this meaning-laden quote that stops the Winter Soldier in his tracks, ultimately beginning his journey to becoming Bucky Barnes once again.\n\nSteve is a man of his word, and his loyalty to those closest to him means everything to him, no matter what it costs him in the end.\n\n“I’m not looking for forgiveness, and I’m way past asking permission. Earth just lost her best defender, so we’re here to fight. And if you want to stand in our way, we’ll fight you too.”\n\n– Avengers: Infinity War\n\nAfter being on the run with Natasha and Sam following the events of Captain America: Civil War, Steve comes out of hiding to help save the world once again.\n\nSteve has a strong sense of what is right, and also recognizes that right and lawful are not always the same thing. When chastised by Secretary Ross for showing up so boldly in spite of being a fugitive, Steve’s sense of right and wrong shines through, ultimately putting the Secretary of State in his place.\n\n“Avengers! Assemble.”\n\n– Avengers: Endgame\n\nThis is the line that fans had been waiting for with bated breath since the first Avengers movie. As the returned heroes come through the portals and the battle-weary Avengers that had already been fighting rally, Steve finally says the iconic quote that had been teased initially at the end of Avengers: Age of Ultron.\n\nMany fans that saw the movie on opening night still fondly remember the audience’s reaction to this moment. In this moment more than any other, we see Steve being the leader he was born to be.\n\n“Compromise where you can. Where you can’t, don’t. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move, it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in the eye, and say, ‘No, you move.'”\n\n– Captain America: Civil War\n\nWhile Steve does not say this in the MCU, it is based upon one of his most iconic quotes in the comics and is therefore worth mentioning. Sharon Carter delivers this line in a eulogy to her aunt, Peggy Carter, saying that it was one of the things that her aunt said and stood for.\n\nThis Steve Rogers quote is so important because it is almost impossible to consider who Steve Rogers would have been without the influence of Peggy Carter in his life. She encouraged him, pushed him, and through example undeniably shaped the hero who Steve became as Captain America.\n\nDetermination, a strong sense of right and wrong, and pure nerve were things that the Captain and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent shared, reflecting and amplifying them in one another throughout their lives.\n\nFor more than 80 years in comics, fans’ love of Captain America has continued and perhaps even grown stronger through the MCU. The enduring nature of his character is a testament to the timeless nature of the man out of time.\n\nFans are often drawn in because he is a super hero as Captain America, but what really makes people care for Steve Rogers is what Dr. Erskine recognized in him during World War II: he’s “not a perfect soldier, but a good man.”"
