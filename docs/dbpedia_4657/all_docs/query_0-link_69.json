Robert Englund, Sarah Michele Gellar, Danny Trejo AND Michael Rooker in a game as zombie killers? Whaaaaaat?!! That’s a day ONE buy, Oh hell yeah!\n\nThen I see the release date and had to feign a dropkick at my PS3 (for not getting this pack on the same day AND the current PSN debacle). My 360 is deader than a pack of blown-away flesh-eaters, so it looks like I’ll be a lonely, lonely non-undead killing fool next week (*sob!*). Ah well, there’s always the long wait for the Game of the Year Edition, I suppose…\n\nEr… Activision? I’m sure a whole hell of a LOT of diehard COD fans, zombie fans and B-movie fans wouldn’t mind skipping yet another military-themed COD one year for a dozen or so of non-stop hours of zombie destruction with these four genre legends, a great single-player/co-op focused storyline packed with genre cliches galore, some fine multiplayer modes (YES with MORE arcade bonuses) and so forth and so on. Trust me, it’ll sell like.. er, like Call of Duty, dammit!\n\nOh, that’s George A. Romero as the lead zombie, in case you haven’t guessed. I’d know those over-sized thick glasses ANYWHERE."
