        "text": "Movies are a great source of entertainment, and everyone looks forward to seeing an exciting film. But before we go to a movie, we come across its poster and get a feel of what to expect from the movie. Some movies have set new box office records. Likewise, some movie posters today are labeled as iconic.\n\nA movie poster is not just an announcement of a new release in the cinema halls. More than that, a well-made poster conveys the movie’s theme in a subtle way. Posters that hint at the story and the genre are most likely to draw more viewers to the theatres.\n\nHere Are 51 Of The Most Iconic Movie Posters For Your Inspiration\n\n01. Batman (1989)\n\nBatman was an iconic movie, and so was its poster design. It was an excellent example of using blank space, also known as white space, to convey a message.

Mean Streets (1973)\n\nThe movie poster design for Martin Scorsese’s movie Mean Street conveys the story of the criminal underworld of Little Italy, New York.

Parasite (2017)\n\nThe iconic South Korean thriller swept the Oscars. However, its unique poster does not say much about the film directly. Instead, it has elements that create curiosity and compel viewers to watch the movie.\n\n08. Back To The Future (1985)\n\nBack to the Future was a comedy blockbuster of its times. Its poster is mainly red because the movie’s theme was about the fiery fire cracks.\n\n09. Superman: The Movie (1978)\n\nSuperman movie had a famous tagline, “You’ll believe a man can fly,” representing the state-of-the-art visual effects of those times.
