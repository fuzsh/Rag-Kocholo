        "text": "“The Princess Bride” may be one of the most quotable movies ever.\n\nAn internet search on the subject pretty much bears that out, with lists that typically include such other notably quotable films as “Casablanca,” “The Wizard of Oz,” “Pulp Fiction,” “Airplane!” “The Big Lebowski” and “Monty Python and the Holy Grail” as well.\n\nHere are some of our favorite lines and exchanges:\n\n• Inigo Montoya: “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”\n\n• Westley: “Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.”\n\n• Miracle Max: “He probably owes you money huh? I’ll ask him.”\n\n• Inigo Montoya: “He’s dead. He can’t talk.”\n\n• Miracle Max: “There’s a big difference between mostly dead and all dead. Mostly dead is slightly alive. With all dead, well, with all dead there’s usually only one thing you can do.”\n\n• Miracle Max: “Go through his clothes and look for loose change.”\n\n• Man in Black: “Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something.”\n\n• Inigo Montoya: “You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.”\n\n• The Man in Black: “You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.”\n\n• Miracle Max and Valerie: “Have fun stormin’ da castle.”\n\n• The Grandson: “They’re kissing again. Do we have to read the kissing parts?”\n\n• Vizzini: “He didn’t fall?! Inconceivable!”\n\n• Inigo Montoya: “You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.”\n\n• The Impressive Clergyman: “Mawage. Mawage is wot bwings us togeder tooday. Mawage, that bwessed awangment, that dweam wifin a dweam … And wuv, tru wuv, will fowow you foweva … So tweasure your wuv.”\n\n• Westley: “I’ll explain and I’ll use small words so that you’ll be sure to understand, you warthog faced buffoon.”\n\n• Valerie: “I’m not a witch, I’m your wife. But after what you just said, I’m not even sure I want to be that any more.”\n\n• The Grandfather: “When I was your age, television was called books.”"
