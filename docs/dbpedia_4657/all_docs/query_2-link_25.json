        "text": "Since the dawn of movie making over 100 years ago, movie posters have been used as a medium to promote films with a commercial intent of getting people to buy tickets. Most of the early film posters prior to 1910 were simple signs with block text announcing the title, producer, and director.\n\nIt is generally thought that the first movie poster was created in 1890 by French painter and lithographer Jules Cheret for a short film called “Projections Artistiques”. However, the poster for L’Arroseur Arrosé a 1895 short black and white silent film, illustrated by Marcellin Auzolle, is considered the first poster ever designed to promote an individual film and the first movie poster to depict an actual scene from a film.\n\nAs the movie industry began to grow, studios realized the marketing value of creating colourful artwork that depicted scenes from their movies to promote the films and bring in more viewers.\n\nFrom the mid 1920’s through the 1940’s, poster design moved from being simple advertising to an art form: Movie studios developed their own artwork styles and hired well-known artists and illustrators, there was a shift towards bolder typography with designs, and giant architectural masterpieces began to replace drab movie theatres. One very noticeable change during this time was the elimination of detailed backgrounds with a shift towards blank backgrounds. We see a growing tendency towards illustrations focusing on main characters of the film, particularly faces, over depictions of scenes.\n\nThe 1970s saw a shift from painting to photography, with photographs playing a big role in posters for the first time, often taking up the bulk of the canvas.\n\nDuring the 1980s and 1990s, the industry saw the development of new special effects and computerised effects, which had an impact on the images that were selected for advertisement purposes. Posters began featuring fantastic images of exotic creatures and locations.\n\nDuring these two decades, we start to see movie posters in a form similar to what we’re used to seeing today: the photographic backgrounds, with slogans at the top, and the names of headline actors sitting quietly above or below the name of the film.\n\nFrom the early 2000s to this day, we see the evolution of movie posters slow down as designers reached a series of winning layouts. Some trends do arise every now and then to suit the current times, but the layout often remains the same.\n\nWill Movie Posters Survive\n\nthe Digital Age?\n\nAs modern printing and distribution costs continue to rise for movie posters, many movie studios are choosing to promote their films digitally. Digital media also has a larger reach and attracts a far bigger audience. For these reasons, digital media is overtaking printed media.\n\nAs well as utilising digital media to promote movies, many cinemas are now replacing traditional movie poster frames with digital video screens. Digital movie posters can play movie trailers, animated stills or simple animations to tease movie goers and generate excitement.\n\nWill this mean the demise and eventually end of the paper movie poster? Ultimately, who knows. However, the artistic creativity used to develop these posters will continue whatever the medium used to deliver them, as it remains an important aspect for movies that strive for originality and artistic quality."
