Simple thread game, like the many other similar kind of topics on here. Just vote/pick the one YOU personally feel is the scarier movie above form the 2 choices. I figured I'd put horror/sci-fi since there's a lot of sci fi flicks historically speaking that are horror too or have horror elements and vice versa. You can also put horror/comedy if you wish since that's also a sub horror genre. Enjoy! You can post pics of both movies posters if you wish but not necessary.

I'll start

Which of these movies are scarier to you?

Ok, so I'm going to go with The Thing on that one. The Fly is just as gross as The Thing but not as scary as it's more predictable than The Thing is honestly.

Ok Next Match up Evil Dead 2013(remake) vs. The Exorcism of Emily Rose
