Before a trailer, the very first glimpse at a new film or upcoming TV show is its poster. The lush artwork or posed character portrait immediately gives a taste of what’s to come, and teases plot elements that may not fully come into focus until audiences watch the finished product.

From spotting Ana de Armas’ transformation into Marilyn Monroe up-close for “Blonde” to visiting the desert dystopia of “Don’t Worry Darling,” film posters this year have caught the eyes of moviegoers on social media, at theaters, or anywhere they stake a claim in the wild. Even the hauntingly anonymous silhouette for “She Said” carries a dark weight of going on record for the #MeToo drama.

In television, there were the supercilious silhouettes of “Anne Rice’s Interview With the Vampire,” the mind-bending visuals of “Irma Vep” and “The Patient,” as well as the clean but effective dread evoked by “The Baby.” The colorful sweater within grave artwork for “We Need to Talk About Cosby” prepared viewers for a difficult look into their pasts, while Disney and Lucasfilm stirred up Star Wars nostalgia with character posters for “Obi-Wan Kenobi.”

Below is IndieWire’s full collection of the best film and television posters of 2022.
