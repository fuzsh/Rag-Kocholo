This is an original, one-sheet movie poster from 1979 for the initial, U.S. theatrical release of Game of Death starring Bruce Lee, Gig Young, Dean Jagger, High O'Brian, Chuck Norris, Mel Novak, Roy Chaio, Danny Inosanto, Bob Wall, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and Colleen Camp. Robert Clouse directed the martial arts action thriller. Bob Gleason is the artist for the poster.

The poster measures 27" x 41" and is in very good condition with minimal surface wear near the bottom cross-fold. It was folded at the time of printing and has a pinhole separation at the bottom cross-fold. Most folds flatten out nicely for framing and are often desirable for vintage, collectible movie posters.

Please look closely at the photo (this is the exact poster you are buying). It is not cropped or a stock image. The black squares in the corners of the poster are magnets and not pins.

This very rare and collectible poster, printed in 1979 to promote the U.S. theatrical release of Game of Death, is not a reproduction or a reprint.
