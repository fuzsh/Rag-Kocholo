        "text": "John Elkann, head of the Agnelli dynasty that owns shares in Stellantis, Ferrari and The Economist, has built a reputation as a paragon for how family-owned businesses should manage succession and governance. But a month of scandal involving relatives is a reminder how blood ties can still be wildly disruptive in even the most professionalized of hereditary businesses.\n\nElkann is the anointed heir of the Agnelli automotive empire, which was founded by his great-great-great grandfather in 1899; he is also the chief executive officer of Exor, the family’s investment fund and the holding company for a long litany of enterprises. The last few weeks have been tumultuous. On Nov. 7, a preliminary hearing in the clan’s hometown of Turin, saw a fresh exchange of animosity in a 20-year inheritance battle between Elkann and his estranged mother, Margherita Agnelli, daughter of Gianni Agnelli. The fabled Fiat magnate, who died in 2003, had designated Elkann his eventual successor in 1997."
