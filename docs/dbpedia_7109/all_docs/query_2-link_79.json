        "text": "Agnelli, Marotta - \"we can't compete financially\" bullshit. Can't even so much make a semi serious offer for a good player the sort of player we need\n\nThat's not complaining though.\n\nThat's them being honest.\n\nYour boy Conte complained with the 10 euro comment. That's complaining\n\nAgnelli, Marotta - \"we can't compete financially\" bullshit. Can't even so much make a semi serious offer for a good player the sort of player we need\n\nSo let me get this straight\n\nJuventus is at what 330 turnover when doing QF/SF CL ?\n\nThe big teams do 450-500 mil ?\n\nSo what you are saying is, that when we say \"we cant compete\", the solution is that Exor puts 150 mil in the club each year ?\n\nHow exactly are their shareholders remotely agreeing on that\n\nicema&#951;;5055023 said:\n\nThe deal with the MCC was a real estate play and all you guys know it. It wouldn't have mattered if Marylebone was an Ultimate Frisbee club. The investment was not for fucking cricket. But hey, when have facts stopped you from making stupid claims. So by all means carry on.\n\nAs Klin says its fucking hilarious whenever it's brought up. But the usual suspects, use this thread once every 6 months (transfer window time) to air their retarded grievances about it.\n\nSo we are a selling club then?\n\nWhat has that to do with exor not putting 150 mil down the toilet every single year. There is a hugh gap with us an the top 5 sides financially. And you want a business company to close that gap? They don't want to be juves sugar daddy and whats even more important is that Juve itself doenst want to be such a club.\n\neating their money? exor are eating into our success and ambitions! whilst they are spending our money on a forever failing F1 team and fucking cricket!\n\nYes, a multi-billion euro investment company which has an annual profit higher than our entire turnover is relying on our(?) money to make a €400m real estate investment in what so happens to be an historic cricket club in an exclusive area of London, as well as an extra €350m+ per season on Scuderia Ferrari. Ferrari which is one of the biggest brands in the world and has a revenue of over €2 billion.\n\nMakes sense.\n\nReally, if people are just going to cry and point fingers over our mercato there are already threads for that.\n\nYes, a multi-billion euro investment company which has an annual profit higher than our entire turnover is relying on our(?) money to make a €400m real estate investment in what so happens to be an historic cricket club in an exclusive area of London, as well as an extra €350m+ per season on Scuderia Ferrari.

As i said before the triade didn't let exor see a penny of anything they made through self sufficiency"
