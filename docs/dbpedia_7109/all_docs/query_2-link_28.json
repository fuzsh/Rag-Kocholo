        "text": "Everyone in the auto industry knows Sergio Marchionne’s views on consolidation. For years, Mr. Marchionne, the Italian-Canadian executive who welded former laggards Fiat and Chrysler into a coherent whole, has shouted from the rooftops that the only way to ensure long-term viability for manufacturers like his is to crunch them together and take out capacity.\n\nYet Mr. Marchionne’s public campaign wouldn’t be happening without the backing of John Elkann, the 39-year-old Agnelli family scion who leads Exor, the investment group that owns a controlling stake in Fiat Chrysler. The soft-spoken Mr. Elkann may not project the stylish swagger of his grandfather, the Italian business legend Gianni Agnelli, who once crashed a Ferrari going 120 miles an hour into a meat truck on the Corniche above Monte Carlo. It would be a mistake, though, to underestimate his resolve.\n\nExor’s aggressive bid for the reinsurer PartnerRe may offer a glimpse of what General Motors and others can expect as Mr. Marchionne intensifies his coercive charm offensive. For the first time in his career, which began with a stint at General Electric and a seat on Fiat’s board at 21, Mr. Elkann is pursuing a big unsolicited takeover – and trying to derail an agreed deal between PartnerRe and Axis Capital with an all-cash $6.8 billion offer.\n\nG.M.’s leadership, which rebuffed an approach that Mr. Marchionne made in March about a potential tie-up, would be unwise to think that’s the end of it. True, Fiat Chrysler, with a market capitalization of just $20 billion, is a lot smaller than the $58 billion G.M. It’s also less profitable and has $9 billion of net debt. But Mr. Marchionne’s thesis, bluntly articulated in his manifesto-cum-investor presentation in April titled “Confession of a capital junkie,” is nearly irrefutable. As one large G.M. investor put it to me: “The guy is totally right.”\n\nMr. Marchionne’s basic argument is that there is too much capital being deployed by too many carmakers. The time to act is while the car business is booming – annualized sales in the United States hit a decade high in May — not during one of its inevitable cyclical troughs. Even now, the return on investment by mainstream carmakers is barely 8 percent, below their cost of capital, according to Mr. Marchionne. This results in valuations – around four times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda – for the whole sector that are lower than for most other industries.\n\nBy sharing research and development, powertrain, transmission and engine portfolios, Mr. Marchionne argues, Fiat Chrysler could squeeze out as much as $5 billion in savings in a merger with a rival, a process that would raise returns on capital above 12 percent, and warrant a valuation of around seven times Ebitda. Though deals in the industry have tried to capture these benefits (think Daimler’s ephemeral ownership of Chrysler), they failed because “it is ultimately a matter of leadership style and capability,” Mr. Marchionne says.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
