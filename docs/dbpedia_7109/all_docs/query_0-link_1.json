        "text": "John Elkann serves as the Chairman of both Stellantis and Ferrari, as well as the CEO of Exor, the Agnelli family's prestigious holding company. These roles place him among the most prominent figures in the automotive industry and the Italian business world. Following the passing of his influential grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli, Elkann stepped into leadership positions and has played a pivotal role in steering the family's extensive business empire. This empire extends from the automotive sector, with stakes in Stellantis and Ferrari, to substantial investments in media and the Juventus Football Club. Let's delve deeper into John Elkann's life and achievements.\n\nSteering the family heritage: John Elkann's roles as CEO of Exor and Chairman at both Stellantis and Ferrari showcases his high influence in the global automotive industry.\n\nBeyond automotive: Under Elkann's leadership, the Agnelli family's business interests have expanded into media and sports, exemplified by investments in Juventus Football Club and significant stakes in media outlets like The Economist.\n\nContrasting leadership style: Elkann's leadership approach is marked by a reserved and strategic demeanor, distinguishing him from his charismatic and legendary grandfather, Giovanni Agnelli. This contrast underscores a generational shift in the family's business approach, with Elkann's style reflecting a more calculated and global perspective.\n\nBorn into the influential Agnelli family, John Elkann was earmarked for business endeavors and leadership from an early age. His education and early career were shaped by the expectation that he would one day play a significant role in the family's business empire. After studying engineering at Politecnico di Torino and gaining international experience in various companies, Elkann joined Fiat in 1994, quickly ascending through the ranks due to the family's backing.\n\nBy 2003, Elkann transitioned to IFIL (later known as Exor), taking more responsibilities within the family business. He was appointed vice-chairman of Fiat the same year and assumed the role as Chairman in 2010. Elkann was reportedly instrumental in the company's strategic overhaul, navigating through financial difficulties and industry challenges during the aftermath of the financial crisis. For instance, Elkann led the successful merger between Fiat and Chrysler which were finalized in 2014, creating the global automotive powerhouse Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA). He also played a pivotal role in the 2021 merger between FCA and Peugeot, which led to the formation of Stellantis. As of 2024, Stellantis is the world's third-largest automotive company by revenue, trailing only behind Volkswagen and Toyota. Brands under the Stellantis umbrella include Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Dodge, Fiat, Jeep, Maserati, and Ram.\n\nThe family legacy plays a crucial role in the story of John Elkann, who is the grandson of Giovanni Agnelli, the legendary co-founder of Fiat. Giovanni's passing in 2003 marked the end of an era, but a new one dawned with his grandson. As previously mentioned, Elkann became the Chairman of Fiat in 2010. Just about a year later, he assumed the role of CEO at Exor in 2011, the prestigious family holding company of the Agnellis. His leadership expanded over the years, and following the formation of Stellantis in 2021, he became its Chairman. Additionally, Elkann has been serving as the Chairman of Ferrari since 2018, where Exor is also the largest shareholder controlling roughly 25% of the company.\n\nFurther reading: Pricing Power Through Scarcity: A Case Study of Ferrari\n\nAs engines roared in the background, Elkann set his sights on unexplored territory, steering the Agnellis into the media realm. He orchestrated the acquisition of a significant 43.4 percent stake in The Economist by Exor in 2015, expanding the family's media portfolio, which already included La Stampa and the largest share in RCS MediaGroup. This strategic move underlined how Elkann differed from his grandfather, as he explored new avenues beyond the automotive sector.\n\nGiovanni Agnelli was an enigmatic figure who charmed European high society and associated with prominent figures like Henry Kissinger, the Rothschilds, and the Kennedys. In contrast, John Elkann is described as a more reserved and calculated figure, influenced by his rich Italian, French, and American heritage. The Agnelli family continues to be perceived as Italy's closest equivalent to royalty to this day, with Elkann now being the front figure.\n\nAccording to Forbes, John Elkann's net worth is estimated to be $2.6 billion as of March 2024. This substantial figure is largely attributed to his family's legacy and his ownership stakes in Exor.\n\nJohn Elkann's journey from an industrial heir to a global business leader encapsulates a remarkable career. As he steered iconic companies like Fiat and Ferrari into new chapters, Elkann's role expanded beyond the automotive world, venturing into media and other industries, thus diversifying the Agnelli family's legacy. His leadership at Exor has been particularly pivotal, underlining his ability to identify and seize opportunities that ensure the family's rich influence persists."
