        "text": "Renewal at the top of Fondazione Agnelli’s governance.\n\nAfter 14 years, Maria Sole Agnelli has resigned from her role as Chairwoman of Fondazione Agnelli, which she had taken on in December 2004. During her office, the Foundation decided to focus its research and projects on the field of education and training, carrying out analyses and cultural activities, experimenting with didactics and offering input to policy makers to improve the quality of programmes offered in schools, universities, vocational training and adult education, bringing them to modern standards.\n\nFondazione Agnelli’s board of directors unanimously elected John Elkann, who had already served as Vice-chairman, as the new Chairman. Advisor Tiziana Nasi was entrusted with the role of Vice-chairwoman.\n\nSpeaking for the entire board, the new Chairman expressed to Maria Sole Agnelli “sincere gratitude for the great job she has done in the past few years, in which Fondazione Agnelli has worked for the future of Italian society and of young generations, contributing in a remarkable way to the public debate about education, with recommendations and concrete actions to improve it”."
