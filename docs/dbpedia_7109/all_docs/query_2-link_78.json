        "text": "John Elkann, the head of Juventus’ parent company, Exor, holds significant influence over the club’s decisions.\n\nAs the custodian of the Agnelli family fortune, Elkann has been pivotal in shaping the direction of the club, including appointing Cristiano Giuntoli as its latest sporting director.\n\nIn his recent letter to the club’s shareholders, Elkann emphasised Giuntoli’s role in overseeing the club’s rebuild.\n\nThis endorsement underscores Elkann’s trust in Giuntoli to lead Juventus through this transitional phase effectively.\n\nWhile this season has served as a settling-in period for Giuntoli, expectations are high for him to play a more active role in rejuvenating the team and returning them to the summit of Italian football next season.\n\nJournalist Marco Bucciantini believes that Elkann should increase his involvement in the club’s operations moving forward.\n\nHe says, as quoted by Tuttojuve:\n\n“Giuntoli is the man of the restart, then the others in my opinion should be Yildiz and Soulè who should be included in this project with a talent that creates this sense of belonging that you have created in home. But the real person to start from is John Elkann, I would like to see him more present alongside Giuntoli”.\n\nJuve FC Says\n\nElkann runs several companies, so it is unrealistic to expect him to be involved in the daily running of the club."
