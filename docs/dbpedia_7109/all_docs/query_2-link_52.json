        "text": "Exor CEO John Elkann said yesterday that the investment firm has \"not received any approach from funds over a possible sale\" of Serie A club Juventus and that the firm is not interested in selling, according to Giulio Piovaccari of REUTERS. Asked by reporters during a news conference ahead of Exor's capital markets day whether any funds, including Arab or American, had \"approached\" the firm -- controlled by Italy's Agnelli family -- over a possible transaction, Elkann said \"no.\" Elkann: \"Nor have we approached funds, it's not a scenario we're interested in.\" He added that Exor was \"not considering delisting Juventus.\" The Turin-based soccer club last month approved a capital increase of up to $218M. Exor, which owns a 64% stake in Juventus, had \"made an initial payment\" of about $87M to \"support the club pending the capital increase\" (REUTERS, 11/30)."
