        "text": "Why EXOR?\n\nThe name “Exor” for the investment company controlled by the Agnelli family doesn’t have a publicly known, specific historical or symbolic significance tied to its choice. In many cases, companies choose names that are unique, memorable, and have a strong brand identity, rather than names with specific meanings.\n\nFor Exor, the name might have been chosen for its brevity, distinctiveness, and ease of pronunciation in various languages, making it suitable for a global investment firm. Additionally, unique names can be advantageous for legal and branding purposes, ensuring that the company stands out and doesn’t face trademark issues in different markets.\n\nIt’s also common for companies, especially in fields like finance and investment, to select names that don’t necessarily convey a specific meaning related to their business operations. This can provide a level of abstraction and flexibility, allowing the company’s brand to encompass a diverse range of interests and investments without being tied to a specific industry or activity.\n\nUnless the company has publicly shared a specific reason for choosing the name “Exor,” any further explanation would be speculative.\n\nWhat’s NV\n\n“N.V.” stands for “Naamloze Vennootschap,” which is a Dutch phrase that translates to “public company” in English. It is a legal structure used in the Netherlands, Belgium, and other Dutch-speaking countries for a corporation whose shares may be publicly traded on the stock market.\n\nThe key characteristics of an N.V. are:\n\nPublicly Traded: The shares of an N.V. can be freely bought and sold on public stock exchanges, making it similar to a public limited company (plc) in the UK or a corporation (Inc.) in the USA.\n\nLimited Liability: Shareholders of an N.V. have limited liability. This means their personal assets are protected; they are only liable for the amount they have invested in the company.\n\nShareholders: An N.V. can have an unlimited number of shareholders, making it suitable for large, publicly-traded companies that wish to raise capital from the public.\n\nGovernance: Typically, N.V.s have a board structure that can vary, but often includes a board of directors responsible for the company’s strategic direction and a supervisory board for oversight.\n\nLegal Entity: An N.V. is a separate legal entity, meaning it can own assets, enter into contracts, and be held liable independently of its shareholders.\n\nThis structure is chosen by companies in the Netherlands, like Exor N.V., for its flexibility and suitability for large-scale, international operations.\n\nWho’s EXOR\n\nExor N.V. is a leading investment company based in the Netherlands, controlled by the Agnelli family, a prominent Italian dynasty known for its significant influence in the automotive industry. As of my last update in April 2023, here are some key points about Exor:\n\nAgnelli Family: The Agnelli family, founders of Fiat, play a central role in Exor, with John Elkann, a member of the Agnelli family, serving as Chairman and CEO. The family’s involvement in the automobile industry dates back to the early 20th century.\n\nInvestment Portfolio: Exor’s portfolio includes investments in a variety of sectors, but it is particularly notable for its substantial holdings in the automotive industry. It holds major stakes in well-known companies such as Ferrari, Stellantis (formed from the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group), and CNH Industrial.\n\nGlobal Reach: Exor has a global presence, with investments in companies that operate worldwide. Its strategy involves holding long-term majority and minority investments in global companies, primarily in Europe and the United States.\n\nDiverse Interests: Beyond the automotive sector, Exor’s investment portfolio spans various industries, including media, healthcare, technology, and agriculture. This diversification is part of its strategy to manage risk and promote growth.\n\nFinancial Performance: Exor is known for its strong financial performance and strategic investment choices. The company often plays an active role in the management and strategic direction of its investments, leveraging its experience and resources to foster growth and innovation.\n\nPhilanthropy and Social Responsibility: The Agnelli family and Exor are also known for their philanthropic activities, particularly in Italy, focusing on education, arts, and social causes.\n\nExor’s involvement in companies like Ferrari and Stellantis makes it a significant player in the global automotive industry, and its diversified portfolio reflects a broad approach to investment and business development.\n\nWho owns it now\n\nAs of my last update in April 2023, Ferrari N.V. is a publicly traded company, with its shares listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol “RACE”. The ownership of Ferrari is divided among public shareholders, institutional investors, and a few major stakeholders.\n\nThe largest individual shareholder is Exor N.V., an investment company controlled by the Agnelli family, which is a prominent Italian family known for its historical connection to Fiat. Exor N.V. holds a significant stake in Ferrari, reflecting the Agnelli family’s long-standing involvement in the Italian automotive industry.\n\nFerrari’s transition to a publicly traded company came after Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the successor of Fiat S.p.A., spun off Ferrari in 2016. This spin-off was part of a larger restructuring and was aimed at unlocking the value of the Ferrari brand.\n\nThe company’s leadership, as of my last update, is separate from its ownership. John Elkann, a member of the Agnelli family, serves as the Chairman of Ferrari, while the CEO position might have seen changes since my last update.\n\nIt’s important to note that the ownership and leadership details could have evolved since my last update, and I recommend checking the latest financial news or Ferrari’s official corporate information for the most current details.\n\nHis philosophy\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s philosophy was deeply rooted in his passion for racing and a relentless pursuit of excellence. His views on life, business, and automobiles were shaped by his experiences as a race car driver, a team manager, and later as the founder of one of the most iconic automobile companies in the world. Here are some key aspects of his philosophy:\n\nRacing Over Everything: For Enzo Ferrari, racing was not just a sport; it was a way of life. He famously said, “Racing is a great mania to which one must sacrifice everything, without reticence, without hesitation.” This statement encapsulates his dedication to the world of motorsport and how it influenced all aspects of his work.\n\nPerfection in Performance: Ferrari was obsessed with the performance of his cars. He believed in the continuous improvement of his vehicles, both on the race track and off. His focus was always on achieving superior performance, which he saw as a blend of speed, engineering excellence, and artistic design.\n\nThe Dream of Ferrari: Enzo Ferrari understood the aspirational value of his brand. He is quoted as saying, “The Ferrari is a dream – people dream of owning this special vehicle and for most people, it will remain a dream apart from for those lucky few.” He knew that Ferrari was more than just a car; it was a symbol of success, luxury, and the pinnacle of automotive achievement.\n\nEmotional Connection: Ferrari believed in creating an emotional connection between the driver and the car. He viewed his cars as more than machines; they were artworks capable of stirring emotions. This connection is what made Ferrari cars unique and sought after.\n\nAutocratic Leadership: Enzo Ferrari’s leadership style was autocratic. He made decisions with little consultation, relying on his instincts and experience. This approach sometimes led to controversy but also allowed for quick decision-making and a clear direction for the company.\n\nLegacy and Innovation: Ferrari was always looking forward, pushing the boundaries of what was possible with a car. He embraced innovation, but not for its own sake – it had to serve the purpose of making better racing cars and, by extension, better road cars.\n\nExclusivity: He understood the value of exclusivity. By making limited numbers of each model, he ensured that owning a Ferrari remained a rare privilege, enhancing the allure of the brand.\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s philosophy was a blend of passion, dedication, performance, and art. It is this philosophy that has continued to guide the Ferrari brand long after his passing, making it a timeless emblem of luxury and speed.\n\nEnzo Ferrari history\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s history is as captivating as the iconic cars that bear his name. Born on February 18, 1898, in Modena, Italy, Ferrari developed a passion for racing cars at a young age. His love for motorsports was ignited when his father took him to watch a car race in Bologna.\n\nFerrari served in World War I, and after the war, he found his calling in the automotive industry. He started his career as a test driver and later became a racecar driver for Alfa Romeo. His prowess on the track was notable, but it was his vision and leadership off the track that truly set him apart.\n\nIn 1929, he founded Scuderia Ferrari, initially as a racing team that sponsored drivers and manufactured race cars. This venture was largely successful, and Scuderia Ferrari became the racing division of Alfa Romeo. However, Enzo’s relationship with Alfa Romeo was complicated, and he eventually left to form his own company.\n\nDue to a contract clause with Alfa Romeo, he was prohibited from using the Ferrari name in association with races or racing cars for several years. This led to the foundation of Auto Avio Costruzioni in Modena, where he initially produced machine tools and aircraft parts.\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s journey into manufacturing his own brand of cars began in earnest after World War II. In 1947, he built the first car to bear his name, the Ferrari 125 S, which marked the true beginning of Ferrari as a manufacturer of high-performance sports cars. This vehicle was the cornerstone of what would become one of the most prestigious car brands in the world.\n\nUnder Enzo’s leadership, Ferrari achieved immense success in motor racing, especially in Formula One, where the company holds numerous records. His approach to car manufacturing was unique; he viewed his road cars primarily as a way of funding his racing interests.\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s management style was autocratic and passionate. He was known for his ability to inspire and drive his team to great heights in both engineering and racing. However, he was also known for being quite secretive and enigmatic, rarely appearing at public events or races in his later years.\n\nEnzo Ferrari passed away on August 14, 1988, leaving behind a legacy that transcends the automotive industry. His passion for cars and racing transformed Ferrari into a symbol of Italian excellence, innovation, and craftsmanship, a legacy that continues to thrive today.\n\nThe history of Ferrari is a fascinating journey that intertwines innovation, speed, and luxury. Enzo Ferrari, the founder, was not initially interested in the idea of producing road cars when he formed Scuderia Ferrari in 1929. His intent was to sponsor amateur race car drivers. It was only in 1947 that the first Ferrari-badged car was completed, the Ferrari 125 S, primarily due to the need to fund his racing endeavors.\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s experience with Alfa Romeo’s racing team before WWII significantly influenced his later designs. After leaving Alfa Romeo, due to the restrictions of the war, Ferrari was not allowed to build cars under his name for a few years. Post-war, he began building his own cars, and his first model was the aforementioned 125 S, which made its debut at the Piacenza racing circuit. It was a success right from the start, winning its first race.\n\nFerrari quickly gained a reputation for speed and quality, which translated into success in racing, especially in Formula One. The company’s commitment to excellence in racing helped establish its brand as a symbol of luxury and performance. Notably, Ferrari holds the record for the most Grand Prix wins by a team, a testament to its enduring legacy in motorsport.\n\nIn the 1960s, Ferrari faced financial challenges, leading to a partnership with Fiat in 1969, where Fiat took a 50% stake in the company. This partnership provided much-needed capital and allowed Ferrari to expand and innovate further.\n\nIn terms of road cars, Ferrari has produced some of the world’s most iconic and desirable models. Cars like the 250 GTO, Testarossa, and more recent models like the LaFerrari, are known for their blend of performance, styling, and technological innovation.\n\nEnzo Ferrari’s death in 1988 marked the end of an era, but the company has continued to grow and evolve. Today, Ferrari is not just a car manufacturer; it’s a symbol of luxury and high performance, with a rich heritage in racing and a dedicated following among car enthusiasts and collectors worldwide."
