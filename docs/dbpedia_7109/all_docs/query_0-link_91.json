        "text": "PartnerRe Ltd. has named Brian Dowd to succeed John Elkann as chairman of the company’s board of directors, effective Sept. 1, the Pembroke, Bermuda-based reinsurer said in a statement Thursday.\n\nMr. Dowd was vice chairman of Ace Ltd. and a member of the Ace’s office of the chairman before his retirement in 2015, according to a spokeswoman for PartnerRe.\n\nMr. Elkann, who is chairman and CEO of Turin, Italy-based Exor S.p.A., will remain on the board, the statement said. He was named chairman in March 2016 after Exor bought PartnerRe following a prolonged takeover battle with Pembroke-based Axis Capital Holdings Ltd.\n\n“Our new chairman Brian Dowd brings with him deep, relevant experience to a further strengthened board and leadership team, moves which confirm our commitment as Exor to build an even more successful PartnerRe,” Mr. Elkann said in the statement.\n\nPartnerRe also announced additional executive moves.\n\nNikhil Srinivasan will become chief investment officer, subject to customary governmental approvals, and will leave the board, the statement said. He will report to President and CEO Emmanuel Clarke and will join the company’s executive leadership team.\n\n“As a director since August 2016, Nikhil has been a great contributor to our company’s progress, and has provided valuable insight for our investments,” Mr. Clarke said in the statement.\n\nMr. Srinivasan will succeed Andrea Casarotti, who will assume the new position of head of corporate planning, subject to Bermuda immigration approval, the statement said. She will report to Mr. Clarke.\n\nMary Ann Brown will join the board as an independent director, effective Sept. 1, the statement said.\n\nMs. Brown retired from Pacific Life Insurance Co. in 2017, where she most recently was chair of Pacific Life Re, the statement said.\n\nThe PartnerRe board will consist of six directors, of which four are independent, the statement said."
