        "text": "Takeover battles are often high drama, played out with heated words and outsize personalities.\n\nYet a protracted fight over a Bermuda insurance company was won by a 39-year-old deal maker — John Elkann — whose quiet, persistent style has been quickly reshaping the empire of Italy’s best-known industrial dynasty.\n\nMr. Elkann, the grandson of Gianni Agnelli, has run the $12 billion Agnelli family investment firm Exor for more than a decade. With Monday’s $6.9 billion acquisition of the insurer PartnerRe, he has clinched his biggest deal yet.\n\nThe acquisition represents a new level of ambition for Mr. Elkann as he seeks to continue building Exor into a global conglomerate. Even as the Italian firm disposes of holdings like the real estate services company Cushman & Wakefield, it is seeking to expand its stake in the Economist Group, publisher of The Economist, and turn Fiat Chrysler into a consolidator within the global auto industry.\n\n“We really do see ourselves as a business builder,” Mr. Elkann said in a telephone interview.\n\nAs Exor’s ambitions grow, however, it may face more obstacles, including more takeover targets — perhaps even General Motors itself — who have no intention of selling.\n\nEmpire-building may not seem like the natural course for the soft-spoken Mr. Elkann. He does not pursue the spotlight as lustily as did his grandfather — who was known for his custom suits and for once crashing a Ferrari into a meat truck at 120 miles an hour — and his brother, Lapo, an entrepreneur and socialite.\n\nBut Mr. Elkann has consolidated the Agnellis’ holdings into one vehicle, Exor. And most crucially, he helped oversee the revival of Fiat, which his family helped to create more than a century ago. Now, under his mentor, Sergio Marchionne, Fiat has grown, in part by buying Chrysler as part of the American carmaker’s government-backed turnaround.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
