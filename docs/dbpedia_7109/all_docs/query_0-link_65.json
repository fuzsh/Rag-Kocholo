        "text": "As union workers at Case New Holland plants in Burlington, Iowa and Racine, Wisconsin continue their labor strike, it’s worth considering how easily the company could give workers everything they wanted—and more.\n\nThat’s because the company is raking in healthy, even record profits, while its owner is drenched in extreme wealth. But those profits are going to ever-increasing pay for their shareholders and top executives, not to the workers who are actually producing the goods.\n\nPay disparities\n\nIf you thought the COVID pandemic and resulting focus on an essential workforce meant corporations would shift their focus to how workers were doing, you’d be wrong: Over the last three years, CEO pay actually increased 31% while the average worker’s pay rose just 11%.\n\nLarge majorities of Americans want companies to pay workers enough to make ends meet, to pay workers enough so they don’t have to rely on public assistance, regularly increase wages to keep up with inflation and the cost of living, and provide quality health insurance, according to a recent Just Capital study.\n\n[inline-ad id=”0″]\n\nYet only about a third of 22 companies surveyed earlier this year pay at least half of their workers a living wage, despite raking in enormous profits that went directly to their rich shareholders (which generally includes their top executives as well).\n\n“The 16 companies that repurchased nearly $50 billion of their shares could have raised the annual pay of their median worker by an average of 40% if they had redirected that money to employees,” the Brookings report from April said.\n\nLet’s focus in on our first company whose workers are striking for better pay: Case-New Holland International.\n\nCNHi isn’t hard up for cash\n\nCNHi is a British-American corporation controlled and mainly owned by Dutch investment company Exor.\n\nExor is controlled by the wealthy Agnelli family, the founders of the Italian car company Fiat. Exor made $136 billion in revenue in 2021 alone.\n\nJohn Elkann, chairman and CEO of Exor, made an estimated $100 million in 2021. Meanwhile, a first-shift tractor loader at CNHi in the US makes an average of $36,000 per year.\n\nHow’d he get so rich? The same way nearly all the super rich do: Elkann was born into an Italian multi-billionaire family.\n\n[inline-ad id=”1″]\n\nCollaboration with Fascists in WW2\n\nThe Agnelli family has been described as “the Kennedys of Italy” for their wealth, political connections, rich lifestyles and tabloid drama.\n\nPatriarch Giovanni Agnelli, who started the company as Fiat, and his heirs were quite wealthy and politically and royally connected: Agnelli married the daughter of an Italian duke, a tradition his children and grandchildren would continue.\n\nAgnelli’s father was mayor of his Italian hometown, and Agnelli himself would be mayor of that town beginning in 1895 until his death in 1945. He was also appointed as an Italian senator by dictator Benito Mussolini into the Fascist Party. Fiat would become a key producer of the Italian war machine.\n\nAgnelli Sr. also aligned himself—and his company—with Mussolini and his German allies, and even provided equipment to Nazi Germany.\n\nThose deals with the devils nearly lost Agnelli Sr. his entire company after World War II, but an Italian court acquitted him and allowed him to continue ownership.\n\nGood thing, because that blood money proved profitable to Agnelli’s heirs over the years.\n\nAffairs and more deals with murderous dictators\n\nOne of Agnelli’s sons, Giovanni “Gianni” Agnelli Jr. (who fought for the Italian Fascists in WWII), would take over the family business for the next several decades.\n\nUnder his reign, he grew Fiat Group into the largest private employer in Italy, acquired sexy car makers such as Ferrari and Alfa Romeo, and bought a soccer club, newspapers, and even a vermouth company, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\nGianni also seemed to be unfaithful to his wife (herself Italian nobility): He had rumored but well-publicized affairs with the likes of Rita Heyworth and even Jacqueline Kennedy.\n\nAnd he had his own deals with the devil:\n\nIn 1977, as Fiat struggled, Gianni invited Libyan dictator Muammar al-Qaddafi—who would later be accused of financing global terrorism and the systematic torture and murder of his political enemies—to help rescue the company.\n\nAl-Qaddafi bought a 15% stake in Fiat through his country’s investment company, Lafico. That company still owns around 2% of Fiat, as well as 7.5% of Agnelli-owned Juventus football club.\n\n[inline-ad id=”2″]\n\nElkann could buy your house every day\n\nCurrent CEO and great-grandson Elkann—one of the beneficiaries of all that money from those controversial deals—has an estimated net worth of $2 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nTo recap, Elkann makes $100 million a year, or nearly $274,000 every single day. You could buy a fairly large house in Iowa every single day with that kind of money.\n\nActually, given that the average Iowa house costs around $193,000, Elkann could buy a house in Iowa and have enough to buy an extra Fiat AND Alfa Romeo vehicle per day, too.\n\nWe’re just saying: It seems like the Agnellis can afford to pay their workers a living wage.\n\nBy Amie Rivers\n\n10/05/22\n\nHave a story idea for me?
