        "text": "üåä A tidal wa(y)ve of UK AI successes to be unleashed Wayve announces Europe's largest AI raise - $1bn+ led by SoftBank, Microsoft and NVIDIA. This should be celebrated as a pivotal deal for the UK to stake its claim to be a global leader in the platform shift for embodied AI. The deal is one that is important for firstminute capital, who invested in Wayve 3 times. It wasn't an easy decision, and we should, of course, have invested more each time. Like all best deals, it was a moonshot with a contrarian approach that would probably be wrong or outcompeted by better funded players. I found reassurance from the smart work of our partners (Arek Wylegalski & Spencer Crawley), the outlier maverick intellect of Alex Kendall & Amar Shah, and bumping into Demis Hassabis at FF and asking if he thought this approach to autonomous driving had any chance. A key moment was ensuring my friend Tim Steiner, who had met Alex at FF, took a call on his holiday to seal the Ocado investment and data deal. This negotiation had stalled as it needed a direct meeting of entrepreneurial minds without intermediaries. The resulting ¬£10m investment from Ocado and the deal to collect data from the vans to train the algorithm would be a key step on the journey. Along the way we also gathered smart investors into the round like Linda Fayne Levinson, who had been my mentor and board member at lastminute.com, and went on to mentor Alex as well. Wayve is an exemplary case of corporate-start-up partnerships done right, with investments from @John Elkann's Exor N.V. vehicle early on (an fmc intro), and deals forged with Asda and DPD UK enabling credibility, data access and a faster route to product-market fit. These types of collaborations are something I am hugely passionate about and is the core underlying mission of our work at Founders Factory. The company also benefited from five aspects of being in the UK: üéìAcademic thought leadership, with great Professors such as Zoubin Ghahramani and Roberto Cipolla üë©üíªTalent density, thanks to multiple leading global companies w large UK AI centres üèõÔ∏èRegulatory regime & supportive government, with testing allowed on UK roads & autonomous vehicle bill going through parliament üá¨üáßLeading corporates with UK HQs willing to partner üåéSkilled immigration regime allowing immigrant founders to move to the UK I hope that Wayve acts as a beacon to other international founders, to show how a once contrarian approach can attract the world‚Äôs best brains and capital, and how the UK can focus on technology opportunities and encourage broader entrepreneurship across the country to drive more growth. A huge congratulations to Alex, Amar and the rest of the brilliant Wayve team for everything they have built and this game-changing moment for British tech. Ps. to see Wayve in action, watch the below video of Bill Gates trying it out live in London last year to get some fish & chips https://lnkd.in/ewz2RVjt"
