        "text": "The president of Exor, John Elkann, has written to shareholders to discuss various topics, including their holdings in Juventus.\n\nElkann says the club is now building for the future after last season's board spill.\n\nHe wrote: \"2023 represented a year of transition. Under its new Board of Directors chaired by Gianluca Ferrero, attention was paid to resolving the issues which it was facing with the Sports Justice, both in Italy and in Europe. The 2023/24 season is therefore the 'Year Zero', in which the club is laying the foundations for his return, both on and off the pitch.\n\n\"Cristiano Giuntoli, who arrived in 2023 and was just named Best Sporting Director of the Year at the Globe Soccer Awards for his work with Napoli last year, will help shape Juventus' future. The team aims to return to the Champions League and has already confirmed its presence at the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in the summer of 2025. With a greater focus on the young talents of its Next Gen (who have proven their worth this year), Juventus aims to build a sustainable cost structure in line with the new UEFA regulations.\n\nElkann then focused even more specifically on Juventus' DNA: \"If you know our fans, our players and our spirit, the phrase 'until the end' won't sound new to you. It embodies the club's determination to continue fighting. and overcome adversity, a belief held by Edoardo Agnelli when he was appointed President on 24 July 1923. From that moment a century-long love story began between the Bianconeri families and my family - he concluded in the letter -. which in 2023 we celebrated with generations of fans in Italy and around the world, all united by the love for Juventus. Forza Juve!!!\"."
