        "text": "In 1899, 9 people founded the car company Fiat. One of them was Giovanni Agnelli. 4 generations later, John Elkann is the head of the Exor family conglomerate. He is the grandson of the glamorous Gianni Agnelli, who in turn was the grandson of the founder. The holdings still include Fiat as part of the Italo-French group Stellantis as well as Ferrari, Case New Holland and Iveco.\n\nLast week I traveled to the Exor Investor Day in Lingotto, Turin, Italy. The meeting took place in the modernized former Fiat factory. Today it is a modern complex. I was particularly impressed by the 1.5km long test track that still exists on the roof of the building.\n\nLearning from others\n\nAnyone who manages assets for families would do well to think outside the box. What do wealthy families and individuals do with the assets they have created? How do they invest and how do they deal with the challenges of long-term investment?\n\nAfter the official investor meeting, I had the opportunity to talk to John Elkann in person and ask him questions. I was impressed by his long investment horizon. In his calm and unassuming manner, he has managed to successfully transform the company holdings piece by piece over the last few decades.\n\nIn my conversation with John Elkann, I mentioned the entrepreneur and investor Henry Singleton, who is no longer particularly well known even in investment circles. He founded the Teledyne Group in the 1960s. Initially, he created a large conglomerate through over 100 takeovers. They were not paid for in cash, but with Teledyne shares. Teledyne's share price had risen sharply at the time, making it a valuable currency for these acquisitions.\n\nThen came the bear market of the 1970s and the stock price sank like a stone. Henry Singleton changed his strategy drastically. He terminated external takeovers and focused on the asset he knew best: Teledyne's own shares. As a result, he bought back a large stake. The investment success for Teledyne shareholders over these decades was enormous.\n\nJohn Elkann not only knew surprisingly well who Henry Singleton was. No, he even knew the unnamed company name: “Where is Teledyne today compared to Berkshire Hathaway?” With this question, John Elkann demonstrated his extensive knowledge of legendary investors like Singleton. And more, that he knows exactly how the best investors operate worldwide. For example, if Berkshire had only ever bought back shares and not invested in great companies, we might not even know it today.\n\nReal growth in assets\n\nGuy Spier, an investor I have been friends with for many years and also present at the Investor Day, initiated his questions to John Elkann with the statement: “Thank you for the meeting. It's a great opportunity to learn.” This is also an important reason for me to travel to these events. We visit companies and exchange ideas with the owners and leaders. Because the most important thing is to invest assets in a way that they compound over time.\n\nThis is only possible with equity in good companies. Either through active participation as an entrepreneur or passive participation via the stock market. True to our motto: Value. And how to increase it."
