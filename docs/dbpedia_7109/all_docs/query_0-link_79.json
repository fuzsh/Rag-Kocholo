        "text": "Photo: Ferrari Media\n\nThrough a letter to Exor’s shareholders, the president of Ferrari, John Elkann, spoke about the present of the Scuderia, supporting how important changes are taking place in Maranello, always maintaining humility and ambition.\n\nFerrari’s 2023 is proving to be really bad so far, considering the outcome of the first three races of the season. In fact, the Scuderia is experiencing a difficult moment after a winter of proclamations for a championship which, at least in expectations, should have been the one in which to fight for the world title.\n\nOn the opposite, the Reds has collected only a few points in this first part of the championship, showing disappointing performances in the first two GPs (due to a slow SF-23, with little downforce and bad tyre management). In Australia instead, where the car was close to Mercedes and Aston Martin, zero points were collected due to the various episodes of the race.\n\nNot only that, since the Italian team’s present is also complicated by a transition period due to important changes, desired by team principal Vasseur and not only, in the organization of the team: the farewell of Giacobazzi and Gino Rosato, the relocation of Rueda, the promotion of Ravin Jain and Wolf Zimmermann and the resignation of David Sanchez.\n\nChanges that do not seem to have ended within GeS, since according to rumours collected in recent days, Frederic Vasseur would have been authorized by the president of the Cavallino John Elkann and by the CEO Benedetto Vigna to launch a “prestigious” purchasing campaign aimed at finding market of important technicians useful to fill the gaps that have arisen in recent months, to bring new ideas and methodologies and to reinforce areas of the technical department in which they are lacking in Maranello.\n\nImportant changes also underlined by today’s words from John Elkann, in a letter addressed to the shareholders of Exor (the holding company of the Agnelli family), in which he supports what has just been said on the technical front, speaking of important changes taking place in Maranello for enhance sporting achievements.\n\n“Profound changes are underway within the walls of Maranello, in particular in strengthening sporting activity on the track.”\n\nWords which, as often happens, were also accompanied by a reminder of the teachings and wishes of the founder Enzo Ferrari, still very present in the company today. A quote which, in today’s letter, refers to humility, perhaps useful for sending a message to those who occupy important positions within the GeS."
