        "text": "Say Italian media mogul and Silvio Berlusconi comes to mind.\n\nJohn Elkann, who leads the storied Agnelli empire from Turin, is the new Italian crown prince of European media. But in ways small and large, he is the opposite of Berlusconi.\n\nSilvio is a flashy partier who craves the eye of the camera, Elkann is discreet, shy even. One Italian billionaire’s media outlets are unashamedly vulgar, the other’s are highbrow and serious. Silvio’s from Milan, Elkann Turin. Where Silvio’s politics are forcefully asserted, no one seems able to recall a single strong political opinion voiced by Elkann.\n\nOver the course of his 39 years, the Agnelli heir has cut an unlikely figure in every role he has taken on. Never more so than in his current emergence as a big media player and as a result potential, if yet unrealized, political power broker.\n\nThrough the investment company Exor directed by Elkann, the Agnellis are about to become the largest shareholders in the Economist, after agreeing last month to buy the bulk of education giant Pearson’s stake for £287 million (€405 million). Once they obtain shareholder and regulatory approvals for the transactions, the Italian industrialists will control 43.4 percent of the magazine.\n\nAlready, they controlled La Stampa, a Turin-based national daily, and were the biggest shareholder in RCS MediaGroup, which publishes Corriere della Sera. Other media holdings include a share in Banijay, an international television production company whose shows include “Keeping up with the Kardashians.”\n\nThe investment in the Economist takes the family’s position in the media industry to a new level, but also illustrates the growing assertiveness of Gianni Agnelli’s handpicked heir. By moving head first into media and other investments outside the traditional industrial interests of the Agnellis, Elkann is stepping out of his family’s long shadow.\n\n“Do not be fooled. Sometimes [Elkann] plays with this impression but the man is not at all naive.” — Paolo Griseri, journalist.\n\nThe Agnellis are the closest thing Italy has to a royal family. The industrial empire began with the founding of Fiat by Giovanni Agnelli, a cavalry officer, at the end of the 19th century. By the end of the 1980s, at the peak of their influence, the Agnellis directly or indirectly controlled a quarter of the Italian stock exchange.\n\nElkann, nicknamed Jaki, was born in New York in 1976. His mother Margherita Agnelli was the daughter of Gianni Agnelli, grandson of the founder; Elkann’s father, Alain, was a writer and journalist from a wealthy Italian-French family. He was educated in Paris and Italy, graduating with an engineering degree from Turin’s Politecnico, one of Italy’s top universities.\n\nA tall, slim man who is fluent in four languages (English, Italian, French, and Portuguese), Elkann presents a sharp contrast to his famous grandfather. Gianni Agnelli socialized with Henry Kissinger, the Rothschilds and the Kennedys. He was a flamboyant womanizer, always smartly dressed, with an appeal that transcended European high society. When he died in 2003 his funeral was attended by almost 100,000 people.\n\n“Gianni Agnelli was a king,” says Guido Roberto Vitale, a banker who has worked with both men.\n\nElkann stays out of the limelight. He rarely gives interviews and declined to speak to POLITICO for this article.\n\nIn person, he comes across as unassuming, some say naive.\n\n“Do not be fooled,” says Paolo Griseri, a journalist a La Repubblica, the Rome-based daily newspaper, who has been following Fiat and the Agnellis for more than 20 years. “Sometimes he plays with this impression but the man is not at all naive.”\n\nOn the brink\n\nElkann’s seriousness and diligence made such an impression on his grandfather that when the expected heir Giovanni Alberto, Gianni’s nephew, died of cancer at the age of 33, Elkann was anointed. He joined the Fiat board in 1997, aged only 21.\n\nAgnelli said at the time that while his grandson was still young, “he has already shown remarkable qualities and moral gifts.” After the death of Agnelli in 2003, Elkann increasingly assumed responsibility for the family business.\n\nOther Italian dynasties are selling assets to foreigners. Elkann is acquiring them.\n\nAt that time, Fiat was not in great shape.\n\n“[Gianni Agnelli] inherited one of the best multinationals in the world and left it teetering on the brink,” says Massimo Mucchetti, author of several books on Italian capitalism and now a senator for Matteo Renzi’s Democratic party.\n\nThe company’s turnaround since then is usually credited to Sergio Marchionne, the chief executive.\n\nMarchionne, a former accountant with degrees in law and philosophy, introduced more popular car models, including a revamp of the classic Fiat 500, and acquired the U.S. carmaker Chrysler in 2009. Fiat Chrysler, listed in New York and Milan, is now the world’s seventh-biggest carmaker, with a market value of around $17 billion.\n\nElkann played a minor role in Marchionne’s appointment: “It was [his uncle] Umberto Agnelli who made the choice,” Griseri says.\n\nIt was Elkann who met Marchionne to offer him the position of Fiat’s CEO. There was speculation in the early days, because of his age and inexperience, that the big decisions about the family’s interests were being taken not by the young heir but by his grandfather’s former advisers, men such as Gianluigi Gabetti.\n\nIf that was the case, it is not now, according to long-time observers of the Agnellis. “I am sure he is taking decisions on his own,” says Guiseppe Berta, a business history lecturer at Milan’s Bocconi University and former head of the Fiat Archives.\n\nNow almost 40, Elkann is clearly in control and becoming increasingly bold in his business decisions. He has streamlined the family’s holdings, centralized his power and expanded into new markets. Under his leadership, the Agnelli empire is becoming less wedded to car — and to Italy.\n\nIn the space of a few days last month, Elkann pulled off not only the Economist deal but also the €6.2 billion hostile takeover of PartnerRe, a New York-listed reinsurance company. Other Italian dynasties are selling assets to foreigners, Berta says. Elkann is acquiring them.\n\nMedia mogul\n\nExor’s growing interest in media is part of Elkann’s plan to diversify beyond heavy industry.\n\nElkann revived the family’s interest in Corriere della Sera two years ago, when the parent company RCS ran again into financial trouble. Through Fiat, which owns Ferrari, they increased the stake (that is now at about 17 percent) in the company whose interests also include the daily El Mundo in Spain, magazines and radio stations. Other investors include some of the most important names in Italian capitalism, such as Mediobanca, Pirelli and Intesa Sanpaolo.\n\nElkann also joined the boards of the Economist and News Corp, the newspaper group controlled by Rupert Murdoch, who is said to be an admirer of the young businessman. He bought a stake in Banijay, the Paris-based TV production company whose shareholders also include the luxury goods tycoon Bernard Arnault. In July, Banijay said it will merge with another TV company, Zodiak, creating a production and distribution group with operations in 18 countries and revenues of $1 billion.\n\nIn 2009, Exor amassed a 4.7 percent stake in the Economist after buying shares from Lord Jacob Rothschild. This year, when Pearson decided to offload the 50 percent stake it had owned in the Economist since 1957, to focus on its education business, Exor stepped in.\n\nElkann’s interest in expanding his stake should come as no surprise. In a conversation in Exor’s offices in Turin in 2010, he gushed with enthusiasm about the Economist and made it clear that, in terms of media assets, the magazine monopolized his affections.\n\nThe magazine has a fraught relationship with his homeland. Its often negative editorial judgements on the quality of Italy’s political leadership — particularly Berlusconi — fascinate the Italian ruling class and the media, which dedicates long articles to angst-ridden discussions of the Economist’s withering assessments.\n\nMost famously, the magazine declared Berlusconi “unfit to lead Italy” in a 2001 cover story, prompting a lawsuit that the Economist eventually won. In 2011, with Berlusconi prime minister once more, it called him “The man who screwed an entire country.”\n\nIf Elkann’s intention is to gain influence via his stake in the Economist, the complicated ownership structure designed to protect editorial independence means he will have to be content to remain in the background — more like, say, Lord Rothermere, the owner of the U.K.’s Daily Mail, than Murdoch, who engages with editors directly to project his own views.\n\n“There isn’t a family line that they want to see run through the editorial content” — source close to Exor.\n\nIn Italy, media owners aren’t always hands-off. It’s widely accepted, Griseri argues, that a newspaper’s editorial line closely matches the views of the proprietor. La Stampa has been criticized for not being vigorous enough in covering Fiat.\n\n“In politics and international affairs La Stampa has always been a relatively free newspaper,” says Mucchetti, a former editor at Corriere della Sera. However, “in its coverage of economics and finance it has often felt the pressure of Fiat.”\n\nBut that is not because of direct pressure from Elkann, a source close to the family says. And La Stampa’s editor, Mario Calabresi, argues that he enjoys “total freedom” and that “the best evidence of Elkann’s respect for the independence of newspapers is that at RCS he promoted the appointment of independent board members and he did not take part in the selection of the president [of the company] nor in the appointment of the new editor”\n\nExpanding asset\n\nElkann won’t be able to take outright control of the magazine, but he will emerge with five of 11 board seats, more than £20 million-a-year in dividend income, and the bragging rights to being the largest shareholder in one of the world’s most prized media assets.\n\nLike many wealthy people, he is attracted to the “soft power” such assets confer — the social cachet, the doors they open — but he doesn’t see the investments as a platform to push an agenda, said one source close to Exor. Neither has he ever taken a clear political position in public.\n\n“There isn’t a family line that they want to see run through the editorial content,” the source added.\n\nThe five most recent editors of the Economist, including the incumbent Zanny Minton Beddoes, issued a statement endorsing Exor’s purchase. Elkann and the magazine’s executives had achieved a mutual understanding and “strong sense of current purpose” since he joined the board, they said, and he had given “extensive undertakings” to respect their independence.\n\nIn terms of business opportunities in media, one person familiar with Elkann’s thinking said he is optimistic about the sector’s long-term prospects, despite the turmoil in business models caused by the transition to digital technology.\n\n“His view of media is that it’s potentially an expanding asset,” that person said. “His view is that while print circulation may contract, there’s never been more consumption of content. It’s just the platforms over which media is being distributed that are changing.”\n\nYet some other questions remain open: Whether the move on the Economist means that Exor will buy also in other news organizations? If Elkann plans to expand the strict Economist governance to the rest of his media empire? How in the long term he plans to fix the problems at loss-making RCS? If Murdoch will play a role in it, as the Italian press often speculates.\n\nThe man’s own thoughts on such matters remain elusive. In a recent letter to shareholders, discussing the potential of media brands, he quoted the French renaissance philosopher Michel de Montaigne, writing: “My life has been filled with terrible misfortune, most of which never happened.”"
