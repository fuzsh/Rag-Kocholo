        "text": "Exor chief John Elkann reassures investors that Juventus ‘does not need fresh capital’ and coach Max Allegri is safe in his role.\n\nElkann is one of the heirs to the Agnelli family fortune and the CEO of Juve’s parent company Exor.\n\nFollowing the mass resignation of the entire Board of Directors due to an investigation into potential financial irregularities, some are asking whether Juventus have balanced the books.\n\nThere had even been suggestions in the media that Elkann wanted to sell Juventus and get out of the football business, despite his family running the Old Lady since 1923.\n\n“Juventus does not need fresh capital,” Elkann said during the annual Investor and Analyst Call.\n\n“We are in a situation where there is a clear direction going forward, as we already announced yesterday. A new Board of Directors will be appointed in January and the President will be Gianluca Ferrero, who will know how to approach various issues.\n\n“The club will also have a very capable director general in the areas where Juventus are present. We have a great, experienced coach like Max Allegri.\n\n“Football is a sector of great value and we think with the ingredients that Juventus have, this can be an even more valuable club than it already is today.”\n\nAt the same time, this afternoon Juventus released a formal statement insisting they have done nothing wrong and “that the accounting treatment adopted falls within those allowed by applicable accounting principles.”\n\nThey are on fairly strong ground when it comes to the inflated capital gains, because it has already been shown in a previous investigation that it is practically impossible to prove how much a player is worth, other than the transfer fee two clubs agree on.\n\nThe issue they might have more difficulty with is the reported payment of salaries under the table, after announcing the players had agreed to forego four months of wages."
