        "text": "RASK advised building automation company Bisly - Scalable Building Automation on its €6.2 million Series A capital raise 🎉💼 Karl Erik Esko and Karl-Kristjan Kahm, senior associates at RASK Attorneys-at-Law, advised Bisly, Estonia’s leading developer of next-generation building automation solutions, on a €6.2 million Series A funding round 🤝. RASK advised the client on all aspects of the transaction, including negotiation, drafting of transaction documentation, and closing. Urvo Männama and Paul Padrik, founders of Foxway, joined as new investors 🌍. Other investors include venture capital fund Aconterra, SmartCap Green Fund, Pinorena Capital, and a number of angel investors 🌱. The advantages of Bisly’s building automation technology are its ease of integration with different hardware, its low cost, and the security achieved by combining a Single-Cloud system with a patented digital twin model 💡. “The current financing round allows us to take two steps at once: we can expand into new markets and at the same time develop our product portfolio while maintaining our leadership in setting the latest standards in our field. In addition, we are convinced that Bisly’s technology has the potential to have a major positive impact on our generation’s goal of fighting climate change,” said Bisly CEO Ants Vill 🌱. According to Karl Erik Esko, who led the RASK team, the funding round is significant: “Bisly definitely stands out. The ability to attract a strong Series A round from both Estonian and foreign investors in today’s economic environment speaks volumes about the strength of the product and the team. Considering the potential of Bisly’s technology in the climate crisis, Bisly certainly deserves being rooted for, and we will keep supporting Bisly with our knowledge and skills” 🏢. Bisly, which has become the market leader in Estonia, is using the new capital to expand in Europe, particularly in Germany and the United Kingdom, where the company has opened representative offices and started partnering 🌍. #RASK #Bisly #SeriesA #Funding #Investment #BuildingAutomation #Technology #Innovation #Sustainability #ClimateChange #Expansion #Business #Estonia #Europe\n\n🇺🇸 Scaling in the USA: “You want to find a partner in growth, rather than somebody who’s just writing a check.” 💰 In the second video of this new series, we discuss investments on the US market. Founding partner of Tamar Capital Karine Sarkissian and venture advisor of LUMO Labs Bastiaan den Braber share their lessons, while ScaleNL alums Bhaskar D. (Deol) of eDRV and Viet Nguyen of XLINQ talk about their experience with investment. 💡 The key take-aways you’ll learn in this video: • Always do your homework, be prepared • Use your European perspective as a unique selling point • Set clear goals for yourself and the growth that you’re envisioning • Use storytelling to make a difference for a VC • Connect the different markets in the US to the specific investor climate 📈 Growing your company in the United States requires investments, business savviness and being able to think big. In 5 episodes Dutch and American experts and companies share their tips and tricks with you: from business fit to networking. Learn more about how #ScaleNL and Netherlands Consulate in San Francisco can help you scale in the United States 👉 https://lnkd.in/et2QtwdW #NLintheUSA #ScaleNLAccelerator #DutchTech #startupfounder\n\nHow does fundraising differ in the U.S. versus the Netherlands? That's exactly what ScaleNL's recent video discusses and it offers some great insights, including some from LUMO Labs' Venture Advisor, Bastiaan den Braber. 💡 Here are some of the gems 💎 we took away from this video: 📝 Do your homework and know which VC to pitch to and which not. Know which VCs want tech specifically. Know which geographies to target. It's up to you to do this prep. 🖋️ Make a U.S.-specific funding proposal! Your financial \"ask\" may be different in the U.S. compared to Europe. Europe tends to have a more cautious mindset while a big, bold ask is expected in the U.S. 🤝 Find a partner and not just money. If you can find both, that's a winning combination. 🏅 This is true anywhere, but finding a true partnership is even more important when going into a new market, like the U.S. These are just a few of the great takeaways from the video! If you are a startup founder looking to raise funds in the U.S. now or in the future, this video is for you. It is the 2nd video of a 5-part series.
