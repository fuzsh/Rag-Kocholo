        "text": "It’s not supposed to be so easy to grab a jumbo stake in a publicly traded company worth $20 billion. Yet Exor NV, the investment vehicle of the billionaire Agnelli family, has quietly amassed 15% of Koninklijke Philips NV, revealing the holding as a fait accompli to the market on Monday along with a seat on the European health-care firm’s supervisory board. It’s a dramatic and risky gambit.\n\nThe Philips investment is consistent with the Exor Chief Executive Officer John Elkann’s messaging that the company would reinvest proceeds from selling insurer Partner Re in the health-care and technology sectors. It will complement existing major holdings in Stellantis NV, owner of Fiat, and Ferrari NV."
