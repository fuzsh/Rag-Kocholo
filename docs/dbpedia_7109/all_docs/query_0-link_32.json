        "text": "[New Compounders Podcast] I love this interview with Thomas Bachrach. Tom is an eclectic investor who travels around the world looking for mispriced smaller companies, especially those in markets that a lot of other investors shy away from. He also is willing to invest in sectors that other people shun for various reasons (coal for example). With all of that as background, here is what we covered in the conversation: · The founding inspiration for PFH Capital; · The countries and markets he tends to gravitate towards; · What it means to seek companies with healthy financials; · Why he is interested in investing in companies with exposure to commodities; and · What people are totally missing about coal Please enjoy the full interview here: https://lnkd.in/gcN3G7jk\n\n[New Compounders Podcast] As a public equities portfolio manager who simply clicks a button to invest in a company, you are often so disconnected from the underlying business that it can be easy to forget how important people and culture are to the future success of the investment. On the opposite end of the spectrum is this week's guest, Scott B Colson, CFA, CAIA, who is the CIO of Irrational Capital. Scott is an evangelist for the Human Capital Factor, a framework that tries to capture the connection between human capital and stock performance. The Human Capital Factor is the brainchild of author and behavioral scientist Dan Ariely, whose books I have read. So, I was excited to speak with Scott about: · The founding of Irrational Capital and how Scott got involved; · Examples of a few of the ETFs that Harbor Capital has launched using Irrational’s methodology; · What types of companies score highly when it comes to the Human Capital Factor; · The simplicity and alpha generating potential of using the Human Capital Factor; and · The differences between the larger and smaller cap ETFs. Please enjoy this fun and wide-ranging interview here: https://lnkd.in/gTY-ppcx"
