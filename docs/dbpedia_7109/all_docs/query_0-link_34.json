The discussions between Exor and Philips were initiated in the context of Exor’s stated interest in increasing its presence in the healthcare and technology sectors. Exor’s investment in Philips will not result in any share dilution and has been carried out by way of on-market share purchases and an agreement with a major financial institution.\n\nThe relationship agreement includes Exor’s commitment to be a long-term minority investor and the right to propose one member to the Supervisory Board, as well as several customary conditions.
