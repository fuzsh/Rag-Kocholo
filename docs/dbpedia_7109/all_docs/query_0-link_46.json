        "text": "The F1 News of the Century, which we dubbed the Lewis Hamilton to Ferrari move, had an immediate positive impact on Ferrari shares and continues to inspire, with Chairman John Elkann quoting the seven-time F1 World Champion for motivation to shareholders.\n\nOn 1 February this year, Ferrari and Hamilton shocked the F1 world when the announced the deal of the century for 2025. Sir Lewis will be joining the legendary Italian team. Teaming up with Charles Leclerc, replacing Carlos Sainz from 2025.\n\nAccording to several credible reports, the 39-year-old Briton could earn up to half-a-billion dollars for his services (and successes) during his stay at Maranello.\n\nIn a letter to Exor shareholders this week, seen by FormulaPassion, 48-year-old Elkann wrote: “2024 will be a year we accelerate our goal of building great companies through the right alignment of ownership, governance and leadership.\n\n“Scuderia Ferrari is providing a good example of such progress, having started the new F1 season with several podium finishes. With success, it is important to remember the words of Lewis Hamilton: In racing there are always things to learn, every single day. There is always room for improvement.\n\n“I think this applies to everything in life,” ventured Elkann, who is said to be the mastermind behind the offer that Hamilton could not refuse, ditching his career-long and illustrious, F1 record-breaking association with Mercedes.\n\nLe Mans was the perfect race for Ferrari\n\nElkann went on to praise the Ferrari Hypercar World Endurance Championship (WEC) effort for winning the 2024 Le Mans endurance race in their frist season back in the top tier of the sportscar series.\n\nThe Ferrari chief said: “After twenty-four hours of intense competition, among difficult conditions and with mental determination, Alessandro Pier Guidi, Antonio Giovinazzi and James Calado achieved the victory at the end of 342 laps on the famous French circuit.\n\n“It was a perfect return for the Prancing Horse , after an absence of fifty years, as well as its tenth overall victory in this legendary race.\n\n“The efforts of the mechanics, engineers and drivers, combined with the absolute commitment of the team and its fans, highlight Ferrari’s ability to combine performance and passion like no other,” declared Elkann.\n\nWhat is Exor?\n\nJohn Elkann is CEO of Exor N.V., a Dutch holding company incorporated in the Netherlands and controlled by the Agnelli family through privately held company Giovanni Agnelli B.V. In 2022, it recorded revenues of more than $41 billion, becoming the 317th largest group in the world by revenue according to the 2022 Fortune Global 500 list."
