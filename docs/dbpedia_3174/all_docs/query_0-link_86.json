        "text": "Cupertino, Calif. -- October 19, 1993 -- In a series of announcements at major industry events this week, Apple Computer Inc. is demonstrating growing momentum behind and support for the next generation PC platform: Macintosh with PowerPC. The PowerPC is a new RISC-based microprocessor family under development by Apple, IBM and Motorola. Macintosh with PowerPC will bring a new level of performance and functionality to personal computing at low prices.\n\nIn summary, Apple announced the following:\n\n-- Seven additional software developers have announced plans to develop new versions of applications that tap the power of Macintosh with PowerPC.\n\n-- Plans to deliver higher clock speeds for RISC-based Macintosh systems.\n\n-- Additional details on its PowerPC upgrade program for current customers.\n\n-- Delivery of first silicon of the PowerPC 603, the second member of the PowerPC family of chips designed jointly with IBM and Motorola.\n\nThis week's progress update coincides with three major conferences where PowerPC will be discussed: the Microprocessor Forum in Burlingame, CA, the Seybold Publishing Conference in San Francisco, and the EDUCOM education conference in Cincinnati. Re-affirming that Apple is on schedule for its planned introduction of systems based on new RISC technology during the first six months of 1994, Apple plans to exhibit Macintosh with PowerPC prototype systems and demonstrate a selection of applications that are under development at both Seybold and EDUCOM.\n\n\"Just as the current Macintosh platform continues to gain marketshare, our next generation Macintosh with PowerPC technology continues to gain momentum,\" commented Ian Diery, executive vice president and general manager of the Personal Computer Division. \"PowerPC represents a major milestone for Apple, our customers and the industry. Not only is Apple readying new mainstream systems with radical improvements in price/performance, but we are providing our customers with an on-ramp to the future of personal computing. Because of the imminent arrival of Macintosh with PowerPC, we want to keep our customers well informed of our progress.\"\n\nMajor Developers Committed to PowerPC\n\nNotably, Apple announced seven new developers worldwide have unveiled plans to deliver \"native\" applications for Macintosh with PowerPC. (A native application is an application that has been recompiled for the PowerPC chip. Native applications take full advantage of the superior speed of PowerPC technology.) Together with 11 leading developers who previously announced their support, this brings the total number of developers who have announced applications support on Apple's platform to 18. The seven new developers include the following: Artwork Systems, N.V., Canto Software, Inc., Fractal Design Corporation, Graphisoft, Great Plains Software, ITEDO Software GmbH., and Wolfram Research, Inc.\n\nDevelopers previously committed to developing native applications include: Adobe Systems Inc., ACIUS Inc., Aldus Corporation, Claris Corporation, Deneba Software, Frame Technology, Insignia Solutions, Microsoft Corporation, Quark, Inc., Specular International, and WordPerfect Corporation.\n\nAt both the Seybold and the EDUCOM conferences, Apple plans to publicly demonstrate for the first time a selection of native applications that are currently under development by some of the industry's leading software publishers. These demonstrations underscore the significant performance gains users should be able to achieve with native applications in the future. Planned demonstrations include the following:\n\n-- Aldus FreeHand, one of the world's most popular professional drawing programs.\n\n-- Insignia SoftPC, a program which will allow Macintosh users to run DOS and Windows applications with good performance on the PowerPC processor. This creates a migration path to Macintosh with PowerPC for DOS/Windows users.\n\n-- Adobe Photoshop, the leading image processing program for publishing and multimedia users worldwide.\n\n-- Fractal Design Painter, the premier publishing and multimedia tool for image enhancement.\n\n-- Specular Infini-D, a major 3-D modeling and rendering package for the Macintosh environment.\n\n-- Wofram Mathematica, the world's leading mathematical modeling package for education and business.\n\nApple continues to work with these and hundreds of other developers worldwide to ensure the availability of a wide range of leading applications and to help create entirely new categories of products, enabled by the powerful new PowerPC architecture. (For a complete listing of developers supporting Macintosh with PowerPC, see the third-party summary sheet below.)\n\n\"Apple developers worldwide are quickly and enthusiastically adopting Macintosh with PowerPC and are very excited about the powerful, next-generation applications they'll be able to deliver,\" said David Nagel, senior vice president and general manager of the AppleSoft Division. \"We are extremely pleased with developers' progress to date. Working closely together, we are setting new standards in personal computing.\"\n\nIn addition to native applications, Macintosh with PowerPC will run thousands of existing Macintosh applications based on Apple's current System 7 operating system. Apple's chief goal in introducing PowerPC is to retain a high degree of compatibility with existing Macintosh applications. Addressing compatibility, Nagel said: \"Because Apple controls both the hardware and software, our compatibility is rock solid.\"\n\nAffordable Upgrade Paths\n\nToday, Apple also announced plans to ship upgrade products simultaneous with the initial introduction of Macintosh with PowerPC systems, and added an upgrade path for Apple Workgroup Servers (See related release today).\n\nEarlier this year, Apple announced an aggressive upgrade program for PowerPC technology in order to ensure the highest degree of customer satisfaction for customers as they transition to Macintosh with PowerPC. At that time, the company announced that it would offer upgrades for six Macintosh desktop computer models. Models included: the Macintosh Centris 610 and 650 computers, Macintosh IIvx and IIvi, Performa 600 and Quadra 800. Since that time, Apple has added two new desktop models to the list with the introduction of the Centris 660AV and the Quadra 840AV.\n\nUpgrade prices will vary by model, with upgrades expected to start at below $1,000. Specifics on various upgrade options are expected to be announced in conjunction with the introduction of PowerPC technology-based systems. Apple and third parties continue to work on upgrade paths for other Macintosh models.\n\n\"We intend to be extremely aggressive with our upgrade offerings to ensure a smooth transition for current Macintosh customers to move to PowerPC,\" said Diery.\n\nIncreased Microprocessor Performance\n\nIn co-operation with IBM and Motorola, Apple announced that the performance of the PowerPC 601 chip has exceeded original goals and plans to ship at higher frequencies (speeds) than earlier announced. The minimum speed of RISC-based Macintosh systems has been increased from 50MHz to 60MHz. Additionally, Apple announced that it also plans to ship 80MHz systems during 1994. Last May, Apple exhibited an 80MHz prototype system as part of a technology demonstration at its Worldwide Developer's Conference.\n\nAlso this week, Apple with IBM and Motorola announced that the second PowerPC chip, the 603, has reached first silicon. Motorola and IBM unveiled the new chip at the Microprocessor Forum in San Francisco. The first silicon for the PowerPC 601 processor, which is at the heart of the first generation of Macintosh systems based on PowerPC, was announced last fall at the Slater Microprocessor Forum.\n\n\"By delivering the 603 just one year after the first generation PowerPC chip, the Apple-IBM-Motorola technology alliance has demonstrated the ability of the three companies to stay on schedule for these major joint developments,\" said Diery.\n\n\"With the introduction of the 603 chip we achieve yet another milestone in our drive to make the PowerPC architecture the next industry standard,\" said Phil Pompa, director of marketing for Motorola's RISC Microprocessor Division. \"Together Apple, IBM and Motorola are delivering a full spectrum of PowerPC microprocessors that will power the next generation of personal computing products.\"\n\nHeadquartered in Cupertino, Apple Computer Inc.
