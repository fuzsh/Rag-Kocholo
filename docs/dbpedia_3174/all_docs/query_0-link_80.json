The courses are offered exclusively to students of the minor program and are offered on a rotating basis.\n\n1. Political Science\n\nSeminar in Legislation (LEGISLA) 3 units\n\nThis is an attempt to provide a detailed and comprehensive but non-technical study of the background and phases in the making of Philippine statutes, starting from the origin and development of an inchoate idea into a legislative proposal through its enactment into a statute and its approval by the President or Chief Executive, including its publication.\n\nPhilippine Political Issues (PIPOISU) 3 units\n\nThe course deals with contemporary issues in politics, and governance and development. Inasmuch as political issues cannot be treated in isolation from socio-economic and cultural dimensions, the course will touch on issues which have are of concern to the nation. External factors that have direct or indirect impacts on domestic affairs shall be the subject of the study.\n\nPolitical Language (POLLANG) 3 units\n\nPolitical language is to be understood in the broader context of political communication. Will examine, among others, the impact of the post-Cold War ethos, ethnic awareness, post-modern influences and cultural heterogeneity.\n\nPhilippine Political Economy (PIPOLEC) 3 units\n\nThe course studies social relations in the process of production, distribution, exchange and consumption.\n\nEnvironmental Politics (ENVIPOL) 3 units\n\nThe wanton disregard for the environment has affected global plant, animal and human life on Earth. The ecology has emerged as one of the main issues of the 1990s. The effects of the massive destruction of the environment are now being felt worldwide and ecological awareness, advocacy and activism are now permeating global consciousness. This course will attempt to dissect the rise of environmental politics in industrial and developing states.\n\nPolitical Personalities (FIGURES) 3 units\n\nAristotle noted that human beings are by nature political animals. Politics is essentially a human activity situated within a societal context. However, there are instances in which individual personalities rise to political preeminence for one reason or another. Machiavelli points toward the combination of virtù (political skills), necesità (the occasion for greatness), and fortuna (fortune) as the necessary ingredients for the emergence of political lions and foxes. This course is a study of selected political personalities who have emerged and made an impact (whether positive or negative) on the development of the Philippine nation-state.\n\nPolitical Parties and Party Systems (PARTIES) 3 units\n\nParty politics is an integral part of liberal democratic polities. The existence of political parties provides an avenue for the articulation of the demands of diverse groups and interests in society and the legitimation of the state. There are two major components in the study of political parties. The first is the study of party “units” and characteristics as discrete entities (e.g. various social bases, histories, goals and appeals, formal organizations and actual power structures). The other involves party systems, the competitive interaction patterns among party units or “the forms and mode of their coexistence”.\n\nPolitical Marketing (POLMARK) 3 units\n\nThe end of the current century has been marked by sweeping transformations that have altered traditional structures of power relations. This power shift is enhanced by socio-economic and political changes, such as globalization and recent advancements in information technology. As a result, traditional assumptions about electoral competition are continuously being rewritten. Thus, the challenge of capturing the electorates’ imagination and support necessitates the need to effectively identify and target segments of the political market.\n\nPolitical Contestation (CONTEST) 3 units\n\nThis course explores the interplay among various political forces such as political elites, parties, groups and social and political movements.\n\nPolitics of Sex (POLIGEN) 3 units\n\nAn examination of structures that influence relations among gender groups in formal and nonformal decision making systems. It also covers a discussion of an array of issues concerning the extent of representation and participation of gender groups in the institutions of governance and the processes of social change.\n\nWomen and Politics (WOMEPOL) 3 units\n\nThe course discusses the major debates concerning gender scholarship in general, and the role women play in politics and development in particular. It intends to trace the beginnings of the feminist discourse, contemporary feminist theories, and their relevance to emerging gender perspectives in the field of politics.\n\n2. Development Studies\n\nDevelopment Issues (DEVISSU) 3 units\n\nThis seminar course answers the need for a comprehensive and intensive discussion of selected development issues and concerns at the national and international levels.

This includes discussion of current problems brought about by urbanization such as traffic congestion, pollution, rural-urban migration, and proliferation of slums. Its main emphasis is on the concept of urban renewal as a strategy for urban development.\n\nDevelopment Advocacy (DEVADVO) 3 units\n\nAnalysis of the different arenas for advocating social reforms and changes and political mapping of key forces in the development process.\n\nBachelor of Arts in International Studies major in European Studies\n\nDegree Codes: Program- ABIS Plan- ABIS-EUS\n\nInternational Political Economy IPOLECO\n\nThe fine, thin line between politics and economics is further complicated by the advances that mankind had achieved in transportation, communication, production, information technology and governance in the last two centuries. It is becoming more and more apparent that we need to study the relationship between states and markets with perspectives that take into account the progress made in the aforementioned areas. This course seeks to help you understand what is happening, what has happened, why they happened and what is likely to happen in International Political Economy. This course will give you new perspectives, new eyes with which to see the way states deal with one another. You will be living in a progressively interconnected world. Knowledge of what goes on outside your country and the ability to analyze IPE related data will be invaluable to you whatever your field of expertise.\n\nPrerequisite: INSTUDI, POLIGOV, ENGLTRI\n\nEuropean History EURHIST\n\nThis course intends to provide a survey of European history from classical to contemporary times with emphasis from 400 AD to the present. The discussion focuses on events on early Europe which can shed light on the developments of the 19th and 20th centuries Europe. The course also considers the following important topics: a) the evolution and influence of `religion and religious discord; b) the rise and fall of early Europe Empires; and c) the evolution and influence of European philosophy, political and economic systems, culture, and important advances in the sciences.\n\nPrerequisite: INSTUDI, POLIGOV, ENGLTRI\n\nSeminar on the Government and Politics of Selected\n\nEuropean States EUPOGOV\n\nThis course introduces the students to the political environment of the United Kingdom, France and the Federal Republic of Germany.

The stages of economic integration will be emphasized, and a discussion of the economics of common policies in the European Union is also included.\n\nPrerequisite: EURHIST\n\nEuropean Foreign Relations EUROFOR\n\nThe European Community at the onset of its foundation did not seek any proactive role vis a vis the rest of Europe and the world. The foundations of European Union’s (as it was later named) power and influence lie primarily in its achievement as an economic and a monetary (in-process) union and all that it implies in terms of institutional structures and culture. The EU’s emergence as a global actor has indeed in many respects been an involuntary not to say unexpected by product of this internal success and eventually the socio-politico-historical turn of events in its very own continent and the nearby regions. The present and the future foreign relations of the EU will or may more and more incorporate features of the “traditional” great power. New global actors (governmental, non-governmental, regional economic blocks, transnational agencies, others) are positioning themselves in all spheres of influence and the EU finds itself by default and by nec essity to crystallize its own foreign relations policy.\n\nPrerequisite: PHILFOR\n\nIntroduction to International Law INTTLAW\n\nThis is an exciting time to be studying international law. The end of the Cold War opened up space for more active intervention by international organizations in international peace and security and for more intense cooperation among states that had once belonged to ideologically opposed blocs. The 9/11 attacks have put the flight against terrorism at the top of the international agenda, but there are grounds to fear that the US war against Iraq without the support of the United Nations represented a setback for international law. Beyond these immediate concerns, other equally pressing, but more long-term issues, such as climate change, demand urgent action on the part of the international community.\n\nThere is little doubt that the potential of legal approaches to international problems still remains to be fulfilled. For this reason international law and international organizations, which for many years had been neglected in both departments of political science and law schools, are attracting ever-increasing number of students.\n\nThis course does not claim to be a comprehensive survey of international law. It does intend to acquaint you with its fundamental principles; to make you aware of the political and historical context of its development; to introduce you to a number of major international legal problems; to familiarize you with some of the most important international legal instruments; and to train you to bring to bear the basic principles on the analysis of international problems. The knowledge and skills you acquire should be useful to any international career.\n\nPrerequisite: INTEORG\n\nEuropean Elective EUROLEC\n\nThe elective course for European Studies majors allows students to take any of the specialized courses offered that may help them work on their undergraduate thesis.
