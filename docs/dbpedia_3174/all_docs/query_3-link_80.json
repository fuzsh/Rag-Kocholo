Then I realize that I have\n\ndozens of perfectly good teeth that haven't yet had root canals and I *know*\n\nwhich is more fun. ;-)\n\n\n\nYou might try opening the Aldus/Adobe Persuasion file(s) in Impress,\n\nfrom Open Office. http://www.openoffice.org\n\nIf they'll open with that, you can then save as a PPT file.\n\n--\n\n***DO NOT POST ATTACHMENTS TO THIS NEWSGROUP***\n\nEcho [MS PPT MVP]\n\nhttp://www.echosvoice.com\n\n"
