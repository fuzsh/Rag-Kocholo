        "text": "AT2 File Summary\n\nMost AT2 files can be viewed with Aldus PhotoStyler from Adobe Systems Incorporated (the only known affiliated software application) and associated with the Adobe Persuasion Auto Template format as it's primary file type. Generally, these files are considered Data Files.\n\nBoth desktop and mobile devices enable you to view and (sometimes) edit these files, depending on the software used. These files have a Popularity Rating of \"Low\", meaning they are not very commonly observed on your average hard disk.\n\nInterested to learn more about the AT2 File Extension? We encourage you to view the detailed file information below to learn about the software that opens AT2 files, and other troubleshooting tips.\n\nSources of AT2 Problems\n\nFrequent AT2 Opening Issues\n\nAldus PhotoStyler is Not Installed\n\nWhen you double-click your AT2 file, you may see a dialog box from your operating system stating that it \"Cannot Open This File Type\". When this happens, it is commonly due to Aldus PhotoStyler missing in %%os%%. This will prevent you from double-clicking to open the AT2 file because the OS doesnât know how to handle it.\n\nTip: If you know of another program that can open your AT2 file, you can try opening it by selecting the application from the programs listed.\n\nOutdated Aldus PhotoStyler\n\nIt is possible that your version of Aldus PhotoStyler isn't able to open your Adobe Persuasion Auto Template file due to incompatibility. Visit the Adobe Systems Incorporated website to download (or purchase) the latest version of Aldus PhotoStyler. Your Adobe Persuasion Auto Template file was probably created by a newer release of Aldus PhotoStyler than what's currently installed your computer.\n\nTip: If you right-click on your AT2 file, then select \"Properties\" (Windows) or \"Get Info\" (Mac), you can obtain hints about what version you need.\n\nPrimarily, problems experienced when opening AT2 files are due to having the incorrect version of Aldus PhotoStyler installed on your computer.\n\nOther AT2 File Opening Causes\n\nErrors opening Adobe Persuasion Auto Template files can still occur even with the latest Aldus PhotoStyler software installed on your computer. There can be external issues inside of %%os%% that are causing these errors when opening AT2s. Other contributing causes:\n\nWindows Registry AT2 file paths that are incorrect\n\nAccidental deletion of the description of the AT2 file in the Windows registry\n\nInvalid installation of a AT2-associated program (eg. Aldus PhotoStyler)\n\nYour AT2 file is corrupted (issues with your Adobe Persuasion Auto Template file itself)\n\nYour AT2 has adversely impacted by malware\n\nDevice drivers for AT2-related hardware are out-of-date\n\nYour PC doesnât have enough available resources to open the Adobe Persuasion Auto Template file"
