We had known each other for a few months, and I thought it was time. So I stopped the car, turned to her, held her hand, and said: ↴↴↴ \"I know words have been used to manipulate you, hurt you, and make you unlove yourself. Let me write poetries for you and make you fall in love with yourself first, and then me.\" Cheesy line, right? I thought so too. What can you learn? ↳ You have a better chance of selling your service if you've built a connection with your potential client. Why? ↳ Helps build trust and authenticity.

I'm here to simplify your copy & content for you! Let's connect.\n\nOne of the hardest things to define in your copy and messaging is “tone”. But tone is often the thing that either makes or breaks your piece. It’s the intangible thing that communicates the general mood and attitude you want to portray. Writer and coach Adair Lara calls it “what the dog hears” when you speak to it. Your dog knows certain words — I’ve been around dogs that have learned to spell W-A-L-K — but it doesn’t actually speak the same language as you. But dogs are smart. They know when you’re happy, when you’re frustrated, when you’re proud, and when you’re disappointed, all based on the pitch of your voice and your actions. Humans are the same way. Talking louder at someone who doesn’t speak your language doesn’t help you communicate what you want — but tone and mood do. So tell me, what does the dog hear when you’re reading your copy out loud? And is that mood what you want your brand to be known for? **** Hi, I’m Grace. I help established B2B tech companies find their key messages and amplify them through brand voice and creative writing.

Your marketing words need to change tempo to keep readers interested. How? By switching up your sentence and paragraph length. If every piece of content you publish has three-sentence paragraphs your audience is yawning and scrolling on by. When we read, we keep a beat. By using fewer or more words, it changes the pace of your reading. 1-3 word sentences make a bigger impact. They're short, sharp statements or questions designed to grab attention. Longer sentences are for informing or weaving a story. Our eyes and minds get tired from reading, so looking at a screen or page where every paragraph goes from border to border is hard work. Let your readers catch their breath by adding full stops and switching up the sentence length. It ain't hard. But it's darn effective.\n\n“I won’t take lectures from” Seems to the phrase of the moment in political discourse. This week was the fourth time I’ve heard it and it’s becoming a cliche. Thankfully, politicians aren’t copywriters Because using words and phrases in copy that people have heard a million times before is more likely to crush your potential customer’s spirit than make them want to buy from you. Your food may be delicious, Your drinks may be refreshing. But then so is the offering of all the other businesses that have described theirs the same way! Showing rather than telling is a much better way of making your offering more appealing. If you’re having trouble writing copy that makes your business that bit more irresistible to customers, send me a message. I’ll write copy that helps your customers to picture better your offering and the benefits you can deliver for them. Which, ultimately, can be more persuasive. What words or phrases have you noticed being used a lot lately? Do you like them? Or do they drive you round the bend? Have a good day, Linkies! 😘\n\nLuckily, I'm a better writer than I am a singer... 😂 (I'm no Laurence, who is the best singer I came across on here) If you're still: > Losing sleep over what to put on your Christmas list... > Browsing most of your working hours to find your friend a gift... > Want to nudge a colleague to finally make videos and be seen...

Even though there are also exceptions. What did Stephen King mean by this? ❌ Beginner writers tend to pack as much as possible into one sentence, hoping it will evoke some kind of feeling or reaction. ✅ Experienced writers avoid adverbs and adjectives because they’re less forceful than nouns and verbs. But the problem isn’t the adverb itself. It’s the meaningless adverbs that are… well… meaningless. For example: • Very • Truly • Really • Extremely They don’t add any new information or meaning to a sentence. For example: “She was extremely happy” vs “She was happy” Either you’re happy, or you’re not. If you want to describe how happy she was, you can use more specific words such as delighted, elated, euphoric, etc. “Okay, Joe. So you’re telling me adverbs suck? Don’t use them?” Not exactly. Let’s look at an example where adverbs DO add value. (1) To change the meaning: In the ad below, the introductory line, “Honestly now,” can be removed. But it would change the way you read the sentence in your head. It would have a different tone. Version without adverb: “Did you spend your youth dreaming about someday owning a Nissan or a Mitsubishi?” That feels more like an interrogation. It’s factual. vs. Version with adverb: “Honestly now, did you spend your youth dreaming about someday owning a Nissan or a Mitsubishi?” This version is friendlier. It focuses more on the unspoken truth — that you’re kidding yourself if you don’t want a fancy car. --- P.S. If you enjoyed this, I wrote more about when you should use adverbs in your copy here: https://lnkd.in/eQqcNG-Y\n\nThis hook has been used so many times. ↳Nobody needs to hear it - ever. Look, hooks are your content's appetizer. They get your audience craving more. That phrase \"I don't know who needs to hear this\"? It's played out. It's a song on repeat, the vibe is gone. So, how do you craft fresh hooks? Here's the scoop: -Know your audience. Understand their dreams, fears, and passions. Use this knowledge to craft a hook that hits. -Stay original. Avoid clichés and overused phrases. Let your unique vibe shine and write in your voice. Ignite their curiosity. A great hook sparks interest. It's like whispering a secret. They'll want to lean in to hear more. Listen, a hook is like a movie trailer. It teases the action, without revealing the plot. P.S. What's your favorite hook right now?\n\nThe answer is MORE of you. What is the question? The question is: How can you make this better? And how can you improve what you are doing? On the weekend I was rewriting an article based on feedback from the editor. This was a really fun feature — I had visited coffee roasters, chocolatiers and tea stores all over Vancouver and was writing about them. Somehow my words became very clinical, \"marketing-y\" instead of conveying my experience of each visit. I had hidden myself, and the result was kinda generic. The answer (MORE of you) applies to so many things: from facilitating a group meeting to creating a brand for your new company, and obviously to writing compelling content, whether it's editorial or marketing or somewhere in between. But the problem is, it is HARD to put yourself into everything. And in an influencer-saturated market, cutting through the noise to find the right dose of you has become an art. The other problem is that we are not all extroverts so that \"more of me\" energy can be hard to harness. For me, feedback from my editor was a reminder of what I had in myself. And it surprised me, because, when I'm working with others, as an editor or a coach, I'm doing exactly that, showing people where they can bring MORE of themselves to the story... it's a lot easier to look at what someone is doing and see where they can make it shine. If you're stuck this week, remember where you can find the answer. Here I am at Van Cha Teahouse in Vancouver for the above-mentioned assignment which, sadly, you won't get the chance to read as proof of my re-write since it will be published in Dutch ;)"
