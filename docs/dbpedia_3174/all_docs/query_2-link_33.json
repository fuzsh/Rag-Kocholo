        "text": "“As the big dog of desktop publishing in the ’80s and ’90s, QuarkXPress was synonymous with professional publishing. In fact, it was publishing,” Dave Girard writes for Ars Technica. “But its hurried and steady decline is one of the greatest business failures in modern tech.”\n\n“Quark’s demise is truly the stuff of legend,” Girard writes. “In fact, the story reads like the fall of any empire: failed battles, growing discontent among the overtaxed masses, hungry and energized foes, hubris, greed, and… uh, CMYK PDFs. What did QuarkXPress do—or fail to do—that saw its complete dominance of desktop publishing wither in less than a decade? In short, it didn’t listen.”\n\n“Quark repeatedly failed to make OS X-native versions of XPress—spanning versions 4.1, 5, and 6—but the company still asked for plenty of loot for the upgrades,” Girard writes. “With user frustration high with 2002’s Quark 5, CEO Fred Ebrahimi salted the wounds by taunting users to switch to Windows if they didn’t like it, saying, ‘The Macintosh platform is shrinking.’ Ebrahimi suggested that anyone dissatisfied with Quark’s Mac commitment should ‘switch to something else.'”\n\n“It’s advice people apparently took—just not the way he meant it. It was likely that Quark saw increasing growth in Windows sales as a sign that the Mac publishing market was dwindling. However, what they were probably seeing was new users, not migration to Windows,” Girard writes. “I’ve heard about Windows-based publishing environments, but I’ve never actually seen one in my 20+ years in design and publishing.”\n\nRead more in the full article here.\n\nMacDailyNews Take: Quark got what Quark deserved.\n\nIgnoring – or worse, dissing – the Mac, especially when you’re a maker of publishing software, no less, is suicide.\n\nWe are Mac users. We never forget and – call us crazy – when all is said and done, we will be the last ones standing. Take that to the bank.\n\nHere’s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.\n\nThe ones who see things differently. They’re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.\n\nAbout the only thing you can’t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.\n\nMaybe they have to be crazy.\n\nHow else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?\n\nWe make tools for these kinds of people.\n\nWhile some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.\n\n[Attribution: Daring Fireball. Thanks to MacDailyNews Reader “Brawndo Drinker” for the heads up.]"
