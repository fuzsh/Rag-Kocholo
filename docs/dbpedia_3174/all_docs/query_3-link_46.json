We're here to explain the properties of these files and provide you with software that can open or handle your PRF files.\n\nWhat is a PRF file?\n\nPRF files have multiple uses, and Persuasion Presentation Interchange File Format is one of them. Read more about the other uses further down the page.\n\nPersuasion Presentation Interchange File Format\n\nAdobe Persuasion Presentation Interchange files, with the extension \".PRF\", are specialized files used only in Adobe Persuasion. This presentation software, which has now been discontinued, was created by Adobe Systems. The purpose of this file format is to easily save, share, and exchange presentations made with Adobe Persuasion.\n\nPRF files are a compressed format that includes all components of a presentation like text, images, audio, and video. Its versatility makes PRF an ideal way to share presentations universally, as any computer with Adobe Persuasion installed will be able to display the presentation in the exact same manner.\n\nThe PRF format has a lot of features that make it great for creating detailed presentations, such as text formatting, images, charts, and graphs.\n\nHow to open PRF files\n\nImportant: Different programs may use files with the PRF file extension for different purposes, so unless you are sure which format your PRF file is, you may need to try a few different programs.\n\nWhile we have not verified the apps ourselves yet, our users have suggested ten different PRF openers which you will find listed below."
