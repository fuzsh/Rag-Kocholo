        "text": "Visual Persuasion is an Adobe training program founded by Marti Wedewer in 2007. Wedewer is both a graphic designer and a college professor at Red Rocks Community College. Combining these two professions has allowed her to develop a hands-on program designed to help professionals boost their resumes and quickly integrate new skills into their repertoire. Visual Persuasion offers fully customizable training classes to companies who want to educate their employees on the latest versions of any Adobe software.Â\n\nSchool Locations\n\nVisual Persuasion has one location in the Washington Park neighborhood of Denver, Colorado. This trendy area is conveniently located near highways and public transportation. Visual Persuasion also can travel anywhere in the lower 48 states and provide onsite training. Corporate training pricing is based on the needs of the individual company and includes travel expenses.\n\nSubjects Taught at Visual Persuasion\n\nVisual Persuasion exclusively offers courses designed to help students become more comfortable using all programs created by Adobe. You can use Noble Desktopâs Classes Near Me tool to see how Visual Persuasion compares to other Adobe programs and Photoshop classes.Â\n\nWhat Classes Are Available?\n\nThere are seven standard courses offered at Visual Persuasion. Each course focuses on a different Adobe software (InDesign, Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and WordPress). The courses are designed for beginners, but because the class sizes are so small there are opportunities to skim over some concepts depending on the comfort levels of the students. Sample course outlines are available to download before attending so students can get an idea of what topics will be covered. The courses include assignments and mock projects throughout the instruction to ensure the students are understanding the material.Â\n\nOutside of their regularly offered curriculum, Visual Persuasion can customize training for individuals and groups. To access this service, interested parties simply complete a form explaining the skill level of their group members and the goals they wish to achieve during the training. Once you submit the form, a Visual Persuasion team member will respond within one business day and gather more details.Â\n\nClass Formats\n\nVisual Persuasion offers in-person classes at their location in Denver and on-site around the continental United States for companies who would like their employees to be trained in Adobe. The classes at the Denver location are capped at four students and require at least two participants to run. The on-site classes are two days long for six hours per day. Students will need to bring their laptops with the Adobe software already installed. The instructor is equipped to teach on both Mac and Windows operating systems.\n\nAdmissions Process\n\nVisual Persuasion does not have a formal admissions process of any kind, and the only prerequisite for attendance is a basic understanding of operating your computer. Anyone interested can simply navigate to the upcoming class schedule, find the course (or courses) youâd like to take, and enter your payment information to register. Visual Persuasion requires at least two registrants for a class to run. The school tries to make every effort to run all of the classes that they accept registration for, but they are not liable for any expenses related to travel that you incur.Â\n\nPricing & Payment Options\n\nThe courses at Visual Persuasion are $595 per student. Financing and scholarship opportunities are not available, and students who register for three classes will receive a $75 discount. Prices for individual training and corporate training are not available since these depend on a variety of factors.Â\n\nCareer Support Services\n\nBecause Visual Persuasion is geared toward individuals who already have a career, they do not offer any specific career support services. However, they do offer thirty days of free email support after you complete a class to make sure that you have confidence in your skills outside of the classroom. They also offer additional resources on their blog and other social media sites.Â\n\nAlumni Outcomes\n\nAs previously mentioned, the purpose of attending courses at Visual Persuasion is to help people broaden their knowledge to excel in their existing careers, and people with careers in media do take these courses to boost their resumes and ensure theyâre staying on top of current trends. One former student who has a degree in Marketing and Communications stated that she found these courses more valuable than what she learned during her time in her Masterâs program.Â\n\nWhat Do Students Say?\n\nFormer Visual Persuasion students have shared feedback on Yelp. Marti Wedewerâs instruction style is consistently praised as being both thorough and accessible. She is described as being patient, funny, and genuinely cares about ensuring that all students have a firm grasp on every concept before moving to a new section. The small class size is reportedly very conducive to learning in a stress-free environment, which helps students maximize their retention of the material.Â\n\nThe classes offered at Visual Persuasion are thoughtfully paced and contain a good mix of lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on practice. Marti is described as being an engaging instructor who values her students and enjoys what she does. Students who have reviewed her courses are eager to return and learn more from her.Â\n\nPros & Cons\n\nPros of Visual Persuasion\n\nA combination of low training costs, minimal employee downtime, small class sizes, and customized training allows for a unique and thorough learning experience.\n\nVisual Persuasionâs corporate training options are ideal and convenient.Â\n\nClasses are typically capped at four students so that everyone can receive individualized attention and ensure all of their questions are answered.Â\n\n1-on-1 training sessions can be highly customized to fit a single personâs skills and ensure they are meeting their career goals.\n\nCons of Visual PersuasionÂ"
