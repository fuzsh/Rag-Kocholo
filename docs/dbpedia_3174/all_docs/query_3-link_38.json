        "text": "Lesson Info\n\nYour Persuasion Tool Kit\n\nThe other thing that you wanna be able to do is to gain trust. And how do you do that? Well, this is the part of the tool kit we're gonna do, use. And if you think this is for you, if you want people to trust you more than maybe they do currently, this class should help you. How do you get anger outta the room when people disagree? When do you send an email or call or text or use a jumbotron to propose marriage, which a number of people apparently have, some of them tragically unsuccessfully. How do you turn your own screw-up into an asset? We talked about that. And then I have this tool called, this is my term for it, the PAO, the Personal Attention Optimizer. This is how do you get people in the mood for your persuasion, but at the same time, how do you get their attention, how do you gain their attention and hold their attention and avoid some of the pitfalls of what I call misattention, the wrong kinds of attention. And then this is one of my favorite things of all. When you are gi...\n\nving a talk, a presentation of any kind, there is a tool that the ancient Greeks invented that's been confirmed by neuroscience that lasts 12 seconds long, and I'm gonna show you how to do it. And if you can do that, it plants a thought or an image in people's heads and it lasts for ever. It's like immortality in at least one person's brain. Not necessarily yours. Then how do you get listened to in a meeting? That's part of the tool kit. How do you gain the high ground? We're talking framing here. How to argue without appearing to. What are all these tools based on? Well, they're based on a couple of things. One is ancient rhetoric, which is something I discovered for myself 20 years ago kinda by accident in a library, and that got me on this kinda process of driving my family crazy and reading every book I could. I talked to rhetoricians around the world. This is an art that was created 3000 years ago. It has built civilizations, allowed civilizations to survive. Shakespeare studied it. All the American founders, every one studied rhetoric. It was, used to be part of any education for someone who's gonna go into leadership. It's the original art of leadership. But besides that, besides doing all that great stuff over thousands of years, does it really work? Does this stuff work? Well, neuroscience and linguistics, the research that has been done in the past 10 to 20 years has confirmed a lotta these tools and actually showed that some of the tools I thought were really awesome maybe don't work so well, so I've been looking at the research now and talking to scientists to see whether or not the, what these rhetoricians had originally come up with actually work. And besides that, I've tested them personally in my consulting career, so I've had a number of clients in government and business, as Kenna mentioned, and I've seen what works in real life, at least for me, and what doesn't, everything from presentation skills to marketing. And some of them work and some of them don't. Everything I do before I take on a client is based on evidence, so I insist on data. Everything I do, I say we have to measure this, and it has to be good, accurate measurements. So that's what I'm bringing together for this set of tools. I'm only gonna talk about the stuff that works. All of it, solutions, actions, tools are gonna be evidence-based. So, which leads me to what I'm hoping you'll get at the end. This is my commitment to you. At the end of this whole course here, I want you to be able to know what to write and say on every occasion and not freeze up, to just have some stuff automatically in your head to deal with just about any situation, and at the same time, when you do that, have people like and trust you. Those are the two basics of rhetoric, right? Know what to say, know what to say, how to say it properly for a particular audience in a particular occasion, and then have them just love you when you do it and trust you and follow you. That's the art of leadership right there."
