Since you has shown interest in the article, I would appreciate your input in the discussion. The discussion for move has very a few participants so far, so I'm afraid of spinning result.

I'll add it to the pertinent page in the French Wikipedia for good measure. -- Thanks! Deborahjay (talk)\n\nHi, thanks for your answer on the Reference desk, but who are you? Why don't you have a user page? The Great Cucumber (talk)\n\nHi. You had answered my question about Georges Melies' Star Films catalogue on the Entertainment Reference Desk, however I asked a followup question and since the discussion has been archived I assumed that you might not have seen it. I was wanting to know if there are any reliable references that explain the information you shared with me, as I would like to include the information on the Wikipedia page Georges Méliès filmography.\n\nHere is a link to our original archived discussion - Wikipedia:Reference desk/Archives/Entertainment/2012 May 20#Georges Méliès and the Star Films catalogue--Jpcase (talk)\n\nThanks for getting back to me! Unfortunately, unless I'm missing something, the website you linked to doesn't seem to mention anything about historians compiling the Star Films catalogue in an attempt to order the films as closely as possible to their release order. This interpretation seems very probable, but without a reference that clearly states it, I won't be able to include it on the Wikipedia page for Georges Méliès filmography. Am I missing something on the filmjournal.net site, or have you seen this information somewhere else? Jpcase (talk)\n\nVery good! I have replied on the ref desk page. Regards, Ericoides (talk)\n\nHi, do you recommend the novel? I have tried to read it twice, and got bored while the main character went out riding in his plantation. Did you find the plot gripping? That's what I want in a book. Pleasedon't give any spoilers, should you answer. Thanks. μηδείς (talk)\n\nHello, do you possibly know what the \"Attributs du Service de Table\" means? \"Table service attributes\" doesn't make sense to me. --KAVEBEAR (talk)\n\nIt's from this book.--KAVEBEAR (talk)\n\nWhat does this mean that Queen Agapa was set to white for seven years? Does this mean white as in virginity? You don't have to translate the entire passage. I just wanted help understanding the bits I am confused about. --KAVEBEAR (talk) C'est pendant que nous étions à nous occuper des délibérations en faveur de ce collège, que la jeune Reine Agapa, mise au blanc pendant 7 ans, administrée le 7 juin 1868, morte le 8 juin, a été enterrée le 10, avec une pompe digne de son rang. Le Roi, réconcilié depuis peu avec l'Église, et qui a aussi le germe de cette maladie, tenait les cornes du poêle avec son beau-père Akakio. Le deuil de Mangaréva, c'est le noir ; mais parce qu' Agapa avait été mise au blanc, toute sa famille voulut porter le blanc à son enterrement, voire et les 4 hommes gardiens de baie qui la portaient ; blanc était le cercueil également. La fosse demeura non recouverte pendant 24 heures, afin que la parenté pût encore aller la voir.\n\nDo you know what exactly the last sentence means?\n\nMaputeoa mourut le 23 juin 1857 laissant 5 enfants dont l'aîné Joseph n'avait que 10 ans. Une régence fut exercée par Marie-Eudoxie, la femme de Maputeoa, jusqu'à sa mort en 1869. Il ne restait alors que deux filles et le gouvernement resta pratiquement aux mains de la Mission. Is it talking about the remaining two daughters.--KAVEBEAR (talk)\n\nEnfin arriva le jour où Mgr Jaussen permit que l'on ouvrît la caisse pour mettre les ossements dans un meilleur état (rappel : Cyprien Liausu est mort huit ans plus tôt, le 29 mai 1856) Alors, chaque religieuse et novice s'apprêtait à recevoir les ossements chacune sur leur serviette blanche... Mais quel ne fut pas notre étonnement à tous quand, le chef débarrassé, on vit clairement que c'était celui d'une vieille femme ! Elle avait encore tout son toupet de cheveux, là où aurait été la tonsure... Deux dents à la mâchoire inférieure et sur le devant étaient renversées presque horizontalement et le Père Cyprien n'avait pas pareil défaut. Les cheveux du Père étaient noirs et gros, ceux-ci étaient fins comme de la soie et tiraient sur la couleur rouge. Définitivement ce n'était pas les ossements du Père et toute la communauté de se mettre à pleurer ! Monseigneur était ému... Il faut qu'il y ait eu supercherie de quelque carabin ! ... Monseigneur avait obtenu son exhumation à Cahors... la dépouille était restée à Picpus jusqu'au départ de Mgr Jaussen pour l'Océanie ; à Valparaiso, elle est restée chez Monseigneur lui-même et sur le navire elle a occupé sa cabine ... Dans l'incertitude, que, peut-être, il s'y serait mêlé quelques ossements du Père, elle a été enterrée au couvent, mais dans la partie qui sert au public, “la chapelle des étrangers”... »\n\nFinally, the day arrived when Monseigneur (i.e. Father) Jaussen allowed that the box be opened to rearrange the bones in a better order (reminder: Cyprien Liausu had died eight years earlier, on May 29, 1856). Then, each nun and novice [student nun] was ready to receive the bones, each on her white towel. But, our astonishment was great when, the cover being opened, we could clearly see that they were those of an elderly woman ! She still had a tuft of hair where the bald patch should have been... [note: \"tonsure\" is the part of the head that is shaved off when a man joins a religious order]. Two of the teeth in the lower jaw and in front were tilted almost horizontally, a defect that Father Cyprien never had. The Father's hair was black and thick, but these hairs were fine like silk and almost reddish in color. It was clear that these were not the Father's bones and the entire community began to weep ! Monseigneur was moved... Some prankster must have played a trick on us ! ... Monseigneur had obtained permission in Cahors for the body to be exhumed... the remains had stayed in Picpus until Mgr. Jaussen had left for Oceania ; in Valparaiso, it was kept in his own home, and on board the ship, it had shared his own cabin... Considering that, perchance, some of the Father's bones had been mixed in with them, the remains were interred in the convent, but in its public area, the \"foreigners' chapel\"...\n\nRead more at http://www.cathedraledepapeete.com/pages/histoire-de-la-paroisse/histoire-generale/congregations-religieuses/s-urs-de-rouru-mangareva/s-urs-de-rouru-mangareva/le-couvent-de-rouru.html#4cMbbztBcEHxc2gD.99\n\nCan you translate the above passage? Thank you!--KAVEBEAR (talk)\n\nAlso this:\n\nLeur premier établissement, celui de Valparaiso, remonte à l'année 1834- Il fut fondé par le R. P. Chrysostome Liausu, qui mourut du typhus en 1839, victime de son dévouement auprès des soldats chiliens. Il comprit bientôt une Résidence, une école gratuite avec 3oo élèves, un collège avec de 13o à 15o enfants, une paroisse (la Matriz) desservie par \\ Pères, un noviciat-scolasticat et la Procure de toutes les Missions de l'Océanie. Son Supérieur, le R. P. Doumerc, exerça une telle influence sur les travaux apostoliques de ses frères, que Pie IX l'éleva à la dignité épiscopale (août 1848) et que, huit ans plus tard, Napoléon III, à la demande des ministres de la Marine et de l'Instruction publique et des Cultes, lui fit remettre la croix de la Légion d'honneur (27 déc. 1856).\n\nTheir first establishment, located in Valparaiso, dates back to 1834. It was founded by the Rev. father Chrysostome Liausu, who died from typhus in 1839, a victim of his dedication to helping Chilean soldiers. It soon included a Residence, a school that taught 300 students with no charge, a college of 130 to 150 children, a parish (la Matriz) served by the fathers, a school for novices and a commissary for all missions in Oceania. Its head, Rev. Father Doumerc, exerted such influence on the apostolic work of his brothers that Pope Pius IX named him a bishop (August 1848) and that, eight years later, Napoleon III gave him the cross of the Légion d'honneur at the request of the Minister of the Navy and of the Minister of Public education and religious establishments (Dec. 27, 1856).\n\nCould you help transcribe the text here from File:La famille royale de Huahine vers 1890.jpg and translate into English so there can be a French and English description on the image file? Thanks!--KAVEBEAR (talk)\n\nNevermind. The source has it transcribed. Can you translate: \"La famille royale de Huahine vers 1890. Il est possible d'identifier les adultes suivants, de gauche à droite: la première femme [tenant un enfant] serait Tetuamarama Teuruarii épouse de Marama Teuruarii; la deuxième femme [devant laquelle se tient un garçon] serait Tetuanuimarama, épouse de Ariimate Teururai; à côté de celle-ci, leur belle-mère, la reine Teha'apapa II; en haut, à gauche, Ariimate Teururai [Tamatoa VI], et à droite [barbu], Marama Teururai.\"\n\nHi.

MediaWiki message delivery (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nYou seem pretty knowledgeable about history and thus I have a quick question for you: Had there been no Spanish-American War in 1898 (as a result of the USS Maine sinking in US waters rather than in Cuban waters) and thus the US would have never acquired Puerto Rico, do you think that Puerto Rico would have eventually acquired independence from Spain? Or would Puerto Rico have remained part of Spain up to the present-day just like some Caribbean islands are currently still part of Britain, France, or the Netherlands? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for responding. Anyway, are you sure that it would have been in Puerto Ricans' own best interests to make a break from Spain? I agree with you that Puerto Rico was capable of breaking off from Spain and being a viable independent state if it so desired, but I still wonder if Puerto Ricans would have thought that being a part of a large country such as Spain would have been in their own best interests. After all, I'm presuming that Spain could heavily subsidize Puerto Rico if the Puerto Ricans will demand this. I do agree that a lot might depend on how exactly Spain conducts its policy towards Puerto Rico in the years and decades after 1898, though. For instance, a Spanish government that is disinclined to give autonomy to Puerto Rico (or that is inclined to reverse this autonomy after it was given) would have probably increased anti-Spanish sentiment in Puerto Rico and thus increased support for independence there. As for annexation to the US, I'm not sure that Puerto Ricans would have been any more eager in regards to this than, say, Cubans or Haitians were in real life.\n\nBy the way, here's a separate question for you--do you think that the US ever had a realistic chance to acquire Cuba for itself? If so, when? Also, if the US would have controlled Cuba, would Cuba have had more or less people than it currently has? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWere Britain, France, and the Netherlands able to keep their Caribbean islands because these European countries weren't in decline?\n\nAs for Cuba, please keep in mind that Cuba has much more available space than Puerto Rico has. There isn't much space in Puerto Rico for Americans from the mainland to settle on; meanwhile, Cuba--and in the past, Florida--has a lot of available space. I know because I've looked at population density maps of all of these places. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nHere is a population density map of all of these places (as well as of the rest of the world), if you are curious: http://luminocity3d.org/WorldPopDen/#6/22.198/-77.915 Puerto Rico and southern Florida (with the exception of the Everglades, of course) are mostly full right now, but Cuba still has a lot of available space outside of Havana. Of course, northern Florida also has a lot of available space, but for some reason it appears to be a less attractive destination than central and southern Florida are. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIf you don't mind, I have another quick question for you: Had both World Wars somehow been avoided, do you think that European countries would have been able to keep any of their large colonies up to the present-day? If so, which countries and which large colonies? (Note: I am counting Algeria as a colony here.) Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response. The reason that I was asking is because without the World Wars, colonial powers might have been much more willing to resort to brutality in order to keep their colonies. Still, I do agree with you that, morally speaking, it's still (likely) going to eventually pose a huge problem for Europeans. Specifically, Europeans would have to either grant their colonial subjects citizenship (without any gerrymandering against their colonial subjects, of course) or give their colonial subjects independence. Neither of these options is likely going to be attractive to European imperialists--even liberal-minded ones. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAnother question, if you don't mind--do you think that there would have eventually been a Spanish-Japanese war over the Philippines had the Spanish-American War not occurred in 1898? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nCouldn't Japan have recruited an independent Philippines as an ally just like it did with Thailand in real life, though? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIf you don't mind, I've got another alternate history question for you--do you think that, had Russia avoided Bolshevism and become a developed country by the end of the 20th century, it would have received a lot of immigration? Also, if so, from where?\n\n(I really like alternate history questions--which is why I tend to ask them whenever I have the opportunity to do so.) Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response to my question. I am tempted to agree with everything that you said in it. Of course, I wonder if an unusually large percentage of Russia's African immigrants in this scenario would have been Ethiopians due to the greater similarity between Ethiopians' and Russians' religions in comparison to other Africans. What are your thoughts on this? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAlso, another question--what do you think would have happened had France not fallen in 1940? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response; what you wrote sounds reasonable. For the record, I was talking about France still declaring war on Nazi Germany but being able to hold out against the Nazi German attack on France in 1940. Also, your point about the colonial issue causing severe instability in France even without a Fall of France during World War II sounds very realistic. After all, the colonial issue caused a crisis which caused France to change republics and also bring Charles de Gaulle back to power in 1958 in real life. That said, though, I wonder just how much decolonization would have been delayed by had France not fallen in 1940. Any thoughts on this? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAlso, I figure that I might as well ask--had France not fallen in 1940 and the Anglo-French would have subsequently won World War II, do you think that India would have still gotten partitioned? Random question, I know, but I'm nevertheless extremely curious about this. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nHello!

Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThere's a difference between embracing the Nazi worldview and actually entering a World War, with Italy being willing to do the former but not the latter until France was actually on the verge of falling--with Italy only then also agreeing to do the latter. Before France fell, AFAIK, Italy had no desire to actually enter World War II in spite of its ideological sympathies with Nazi Germany. In turn, this makes me wonder if the Italian monarchy would have been retained had Italy still had Mussolini's rule for decades but completely avoided entry into World War II. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nFascist Italy certainly wanted to expand, but it also wanted to do this in such a way that it could actually get away with its territorial expansions. If it felt that it couldn't actually get away with this, then it might not have expanded as much as it did in real life. I do wonder if Mussolini might be tempted to still invade Greece if the Western Front in World War II will become a stalemate in 1940 and the war will still be ongoing in the winter of 1940-1941. He wasn't able to conquer Greece in real life but he's not actually going to know or foresee this ahead of time, so ... Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThat's the thing, though--if France successfully holds out in 1940, then I suspect that Mussolini might become much more skeptical in his belief that the Germans are actually going to become the new masters of Europe. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nBTW, another alternate history question for you--had French King Charles X been overthrown just a year earlier, do you think that France would have still invaded Algiers in 1830 (or later)? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nYeah, that makes sense, and frankly, I suspect that such a turn of events would have been much better for both France and Algeria in comparison to what actually occurred in real life. At the very least, the extremely brutal and extremely bloody Algerian War of Independence might have been prevented in this scenario since even if France would have colonized Algeria later on (such as in the late 19th century), France might have been much less willing to outright annex Algeria to the French metropole in this scenario (in comparison to real life). In turn, what this would have meant is that once a sizable Algerian independence movement would have developed in this scenario, France might have very well decided to voluntarily allow Algeria to peacefully acquire independence as opposed to forcing Algerians to fight a long, brutal, gruesome, and bloody war in order for them to actually be able to acquire their independence from France.\n\nI'm obviously a supporter of the Algerian FLN in the Algerian War of Independence on national self-determination grounds and also because I want to keep France European-majority (I'd also be willing to support the 1947 Partition of India--albeit not the stupid way that it was actually executed--in order to create a more solid Hindu majority in India as well as support a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in order to create a more solid Jewish majority in Israel). So, I feel that it was astronomically more in France's interests to let Algeria go and to resettle the pieds-noirs en masse in France (FWIW, I do think that the pieds-noirs should have had the option to stay in Algeria, and maybe this would have been possible had Algeria peacefully acquired its independence, but after a long and bloody war this was considerably less likely to occur) than for France to permanently hold onto Algeria and thus to have a Muslim population of ~46 million right now as opposed to a Muslim population of \"only\" 6 million right now. (And to be honest, I do think that France has too many Muslims right now. I would not have minded their presence if they would have tended to assimilate better into French society, but unfortunately that's not actually the case in real life--as events such as the Charlie Hebdo massacre and the recent Chechen teen's beheading of French teacher Samuel Paty for showing Muhammad cartoons clearly, unfortunately, and indeed tragically demonstrate all too well! Still, IMHO, France should be EXTREMELY selective in determining which Muslim immigrants it will accept in the future.) Futurist110 (talk)\n\nHi,\n\nSince you're a native speaker of French, and based on this conversation:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Language/2020_October_23#Need_help_translating_a_footnote_from_French_to_English\n\nI was wondering--could you please provide a full English translation of the relevant footnote in source #7 here in this article (and also put this entire translation into this article, perhaps as a footnote)? Basically, it's the same footnote and source that I previously asked about on the Wikipedia Language Reference Desk, but I feel that it might be more prudent to have you be the one translating this entire footnote because you're a native French speaker and I'm not. Anyway, if you are willing to do this, I am willing to reward you with a Wikipedia Barnstar immediately afterwards. This translation should only take a couple of minutes or so, no?\n\nAnyway, if you don't want to do this, then that's fine. Just please let me know whatever your decision is.\n\nThank you and best regards,\n\nFuturist110 (talk)\n\nThis is the full text of the footnote that I want you to translate here:\n\n\"5 Le P. Anselme et les autres généalogistes de la maison de Bourbon, y compris les modernes, tels que M. Dussieux (Généalogie de la Maison de Bourbon, Paris, Lecoffre, 1869, p. 4), attribuent la paternité de Jean de Bourbon, seigneur de Rochefort, à Pierre Ier, second duc de Bourbon, fils de Louis Ier. Leur erreur est certaine ; ils se sont trompés d'une génération. Jean était le fils naturel de Louis Ier, premier duc de Bourbon, et par conséquent le frère de Pierre Ier. En effet, Jeanne de Bourbon, femme de Guy VII, comte de Forez, et fille de Louis Ier, premier duc de Bourbon, le nomme « notre chier et bien aimé frère, notre frère naturel » dans la donation qu'elle lui fit, en avril 1363, du château de Beçay-le-Guérant (Arch. nat., Bourbons, p. 1438. n° 3090). Marie de Hainault, veuve du duc Louis Ier, l'appelle « notre bien aimé Jehan de Bourbon, chevalier, fils naturel de nostre cher seigneur », dans une donation qu'elle lui fit également en 1351 (ibid.). Stevert ne s'y est pas tromgé [sic] (Hist. des ducs de Bourbon et des comtes de Forez. La Mure, nouvelle édition, II, 32, note). En revanche. Stevert conteste que le bâtard Guy de Bourbon, sire de Classy, ait été le fils de Pierre Ier comme l'ont assuré Anselme (Grands Officiers de la Couronne. Baluze (Hist. de la Maison d'Auvergne, I) et d'autres, sans en fournir de preuves. On voit par là qu'il y avait plus d'un inconnu à dégager, même après les travaux des plus grands généalogistes de la maison de France.\"\n\nFuturist110 (talk)\n\nThe Rosetta Barnstar Here's the barnstar that I promised you in exchange for you helping me with translating a specific footnote in an old French book!

MediaWiki message delivery (talk)\n\nIf you don't mind, I've got a quick alternate history question for you:\n\nDo you think that Benito Mussolini still eventually comes to power in Italy if there is either no Bolshevik Revolution in Russia or if the Bolshevik attempt to seize power in Russia in November 1917 fails? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAnother, off-topic alternate history question for you: If there is no Islam at all (or any replacement religion for Islam; let's say that the Muslim prophet Muhammad either dies young or is born a girl instead), do you think that the territories that are a part of the Muslim world in real life are mostly going to become and/or remain Christian instead--all of the way up to the present-day? If so, what kind of Christian--Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, or some other kind of Christian? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nOne more question for you: Do you believe that Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos's death in 1180 without a surviving adult son of his own played a huge part in the Byzantine Empire's subsequent decline and eventual fall? As in, do you think that the Byzantine Empire's fortunes over the next couple of centuries and beyond would have been much better had at least one of the daughters that Manuel I had would have been born male instead--and of course lived to adulthood, outliving Manuel himself? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAnother question for you; maybe you'll be more likely to have an answer to this question: If Francis I of France and Charles IV, Duke of Alencon both get killed at the Battle of Marignano in 1515 and Charles III, Duke of Bourbon would have become the new French King as \"Charles IX\" (the real-life Charles IX of France was going to occur a whopping three centuries later), what kind of French King would \"Charles IX\" have been? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response. And Yes, I did confuse Charles X of France with Charles IX of France. Sorry about that. Anyway, Yeah, it would have been pretty interesting to see how a France that would have been ruled by the elder branch of the House of Bourbon would have looked like. In real life, the Bourbons who ruled over France came from the younger Bourbon-Vendome branch (due to the fact that the elder branch of the House of Bourbon died out in 1527).\n\nAnother question: What do you think that the odds are of World War I eventually occurring over some over issue if Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie Chotek would have survived the assassination attempt on their lives in late June 1914 in Sarajevo? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response here. Anyway, what I'm really interested in is whether a later World War I could have prevented one or both Russian Revolutions. I know that Russia's Great Military Program was scheduled for completion by 1916-1917. Though of course Britain might have had a larger mess in Ireland to deal with had World War I broken out later; I don't know if that would have affected Britain's willingness to fight in World War I. (In Ireland, the Home Rule Crisis was coming to a head by mid-1914 before World War I temporarily removed this topic from the political agenda.)\n\nAlso, off-topic, but back in regards to the Bourbons, it's quite interesting that Peter I, Duke of Bourbon had one son followed by seven daughters in a row (six of whom survived to adulthood). The statistical odds of having seven daughters in a row are about 1/(2**7), or about 1/128, or slightly less than 1%. So, Yeah, the odds were overwhelmingly (greater than 99%) against this, and yet this still occurred! The only other famous/notable person who did this whom I can think of is this guy: Bohuslav, Count Chotek of Chotkow and Wognin, notable for being the father of Sophie Chotek, Franz Ferdinand's wife. But Yeah, if Peter I, Duke of Bourbon would have had another (surviving) son, then it would have increased the odds of his own male line surviving--and who knows, maybe eventually his own male line would have inherited the French throne in this scenario as opposed to the younger Bourbon-Vendome male line that was descended from Peter I's younger brother James I, Count of La Marche. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nOne more question: Which additional cases of massive 20th century settler colonialism do you see? In real life, the biggest examples of this were Zionism and the post-WWII Russian, Czechoslovak, and especially Polish colonization of formerly German territories. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nYet an extra question: What would it have realistically taken for some other diaspora in Europe to become as large as the German one? Before World War II, the German diaspora in Europe was huge and widely spread-out, especially throughout Central and Eastern Europe. What other European diaspora could have realistically likewise acquired such a huge and spread-out presence throughout Europe? I can think of the Jews before the Holocaust and mass post-World War II emigration from Eastern Europe, of course, but who else? There was a huge Russian diaspora, including in Europe, after the collapse and break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991, but it was almost completely limited to the ex-USSR countries. Is there any realistic way to make the Russian diaspora much more widespread in Europe with a PoD of, say, 1900 or later? Or to create much larger, say, British or French or Mediterranean diasporas in Europe with such a PoD? (BTW, PoD = point of departure, from real life.) Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAnother alternate history question for you, if you don't mind: Let's say that Franz Ferdinand will live (thus there being no World War I in 1914 in this scenario), and let's say that after coming to power in Austria-Hungary, he will attempt to impose military rule upon Hungary through something similar to Plan U (with U being short for Ungarn, the German word for Hungary). Anyway, let's say that this attempt will fail and thus instead trigger an Austro-Hungarian civil war. In such a scenario, Serbia and Romania--with Russian support--decide to conquer some Hungarian territories--and also Bosnia, in Serbia's case--in order to \"help\" Franz Ferdinand crush this Hungarian rebellion (notwithstanding that he didn't actually ask for their help!) and also in order to protect their co-ethnics from both Magyar tyranny and domination and from the Austro-Hungarian civil war in general. Anyway, after crushing this Hungarian rebellion--possibly with German help--Franz Ferdinand gives Serbia and Romania an ultimatum to withdraw from the Hungarian territories that they conquered--with a refusal meaning war. Let's say that Serbia and Romania (with Russian support) refuse, arguing that the people of these territories want to live under Serbian and Romanian rule and that they thus can't withdraw from these territories. Also, let's say that Italy will use this crisis situation (again, with Russian support) in order to threaten to declare war on Austria-Hungary if its own territorial claims--such as Trentino and Trieste--are not going to be met.\n\nAnyway, what does France do in such a scenario? Does France try to arbitrate this conflict together with Britain and Germany and to come up with some sort of peaceful solution to all of these tensions? Or does France decide to back Russia, Italy, Serbia, and Romania to the hilt here even if this means sparking an alternate World War in this scenario? Any thoughts on this? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nOK--here's a simpler alternate history question for you: What do you think happens to French Indochina in the years and decades after 1940 if the Fall of France never actually occurs and instead France manages to hold out against the Nazi onslaught? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWould French Indochina have still become Communist after independence in this scenario? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nSo, no US military involvement in Vietnam in this scenario? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense. By the way, off-topic, but do you think that the Anglo-French would have forced Hungary to hand back the territorial gains that the Hungarians made at Czechoslovakia's expense in 1938-1939 if France would not have fallen in 1940 and if the Anglo-French would have subsequently won World War II? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAn automated process has detected that when you recently edited Patrick J. Kelly, you added a link pointing to the disambiguation page International Hockey League.\n\n(Opt-out instructions.) --DPL bot (talk)\n\nHere's another question for you, but a non-alternate history related one. As in, one relating to real life history instead. Specifically, do you know why exactly Charles IV, Duke of Alencon had no children? Was he infertile? I'm asking because both of his sisters were fertile and had children and also because his wife Marguerite d'Angouleme had two children with her second husband the King of Navarre after Charles IV's death in 1525. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIs there anything in the French language historical materials and/or literature that discusses Charles IV, Duke of Alencon's (possible) infertility in significant detail? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMight as well ask you another, off-topic question while I'm at it: Do you know if Franco-Algerian writer Kaouther Adimi has any European ancestry? Because she could easily pass for a white person here in the United States of America! Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAnother question: What kind of French King do you think that Charles III, Duke of Bourbon would have been had Francis I of France been born a girl or, alternatively, had Francis I of France AND Charles IV, Duke of Alencon would have both been killed at the 1515 Battle of Marignano, thus making Charles III, Duke of Bourbon–as the next in line to the French throne–the French King in late 1515 at the age of 25? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nHad Charles III, Duke of Bourbon been French King, then he would have likely gotten remarried after the death of his wife Suzanne, Duchess of Bourbon in 1521. As the French King, he would have been able to get married to the woman of his choice–as opposed to real life, where French King Francis I told Charles III, Duke of Bourbon that he would either have to marry Francis I's mother Louise of Savoy or else forfeit (all of?) his lands. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that Ukraine will ever actually join the European Union? If so, when exactly? Around 2050? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDoes the European Union eventually dream of even having Russia as one of its members? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense. Also, Yes, Russia certainly does have the potential to reemerge as a superpower if it will ever acquire a much larger population, as is very possible over the centuries: https://www.gwern.net/docs/genetics/selection/2018-collins.pdf In the meantime, though, it will have to handle being the dominant member of the Eurasian Economic Union, which might get Tajikistan and/or Uzbekistan as new members later on. If so, then the Eurasian Economic Union might be composed of around half European peoples and half Asian peoples&as well as half Slavs and half Muslims–by 2100. In other words, it will become a truly Eurasian Economic Union! Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAlso, another question for you: Just how long would Spain's conquest of the Philippines have to be delayed by in order for the Philippines to become Muslim-majority (and permanently stay that way)? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that Korea and Vietnam would have ever actually gotten divided without Communism? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat about China--which was divided into China and Taiwan as a result of Communism in real life. Would it have gotten divided without Communism? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense. Interestingly enough, according to the information here, the United States initially didn't want to protect Taiwan from Chinese aggression but later changed its mind once the Korean War broke out. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIs there any realistic way for the Hundred Years' War to end up being a draw between the Plantagenets and the Valois? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nOr the English could have won this war had Henry V of England lived much longer, no? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDid the French population have a deep love for the House of Valois? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that if South Vietnam falls to the Vietnamese Communists in the mid- or late 1960s as opposed to in 1975, that the United States of America would have accepted anywhere near as many Vietnamese refugees and other Indochinese refugees as it did in real life? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nOff-topic, but in regards to your comment here, I find it interesting that you don't actually think that a lung is a major organ: Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Archives/Humanities/2021_February_4#Another_Ronald_Reagan_assassination_attempt_question Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat if, to punish the Thai government for its support of the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam would have invaded Thailand in either 1979 or the early 1980s after Vietnam had already invaded Cambodia and overthrown the Khmer Rouge there?\n\nThe logic behind a Vietnamese invasion of Thailand would be for Vietnam's huge and powerful military to help bring the Thai Communist Party to power in Thailand and to end Thai support for the Khmer Rouge insurgency in Cambodia. Interestingly enough, Thailand (and other countries as well) actually was very concerned about the risk of a Vietnamese invasion of Thailand between 1979 and 1989 in real life:\n\nhttps://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/full/10.1162/jcws_a_00924\n\nAlso, just how exactly would other Great Powers--such as the United States, China, and the Soviet Union--have responded to a Vietnamese invasion of Thailand?\n\nAny thoughts on all of this?\n\nFuturist110 (talk)\n\nFor what it's worth, Vietnam actually was heavily ostracized by the international community for its invasion of Cambodia. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThe House of Bourbon-Vendome strikes you as being rather minor French royalty until the early 1500s, no? Until that point in time, they were significantly overshadowed by the various Valois cadet branches as well as by the elder branch of the House of Bourbon. Events in the late 15th and early 16th century were like a perfect storm for the House of Bourbon-Vendome: first the various Valois cadet branches run out of males, then the elder branch of the House of Bourbon runs out of males in 1527 with the death of Charles III, Duke of Bourbon in the 1527 Sack of Rome, and then the Valois French royal family itself dies out with Henry III's assassination in 1589, thus allowing King Henry III of Navarre from the House of Bourbon-Vendome to become French King Henry IV. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that had the House of Bourbon-Vendome also died out by 1589 but the House of Dreux would have survived up to 1589 and beyond (and please assume no butterfly effect), then the House of Dreux would have succeeded to the French throne in 1589 as opposed to the House of Bourbon-Vendome? I'm asking because the House of Courtenay was denied a place in the line of succession to the French throne, but then again, the royal ancestry of the latter Courtenays was disputed whereas this was not the case for the Dreux–and of course the Dreux also remained much more prominent royalty and nobility in comparison to the Courtneys even in the late 1400s. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nFor what it's worth, the Dreux were more genealogically senior than the Courtenays were. The Dreux were descended from Louis VI of France's fifth son Robert, whereas the Courtenays were descended from Louis VI's sixth son Peter. So, the Dreux would have had a superior claim to the French throne in my hypothetical scenario above in comparison to the Courtenays. Just how much military power did the Dreux (for instance, Francis II, Duke of Brittany) actually have as Dukes of Brittany? That might have been a crucial factor as to whether the Dreux would have indeed been able to establish and solidify their own claim to the French throne in the event that their own male line would have somehow managed to outlive both the Valois and the Bourbons. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nBy the way, this discussion might be of interest to you as a French person. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAre you Quebecois? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for clarifying this part! That said, though, just how do you know French history so well? Including Medieval and early modern French history, I mean. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat do you think would have happened had Henri, Count of Chambord died a decade or more earlier and thus Philippe, Count of Paris would have become French King in the early 1870s after the overthrow of Napoleon III? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense, but minor nitpick: Philippe, Count of Paris and Henri, Count of Chambord were distant cousins in the male line, not father and son. Their last common male-line ancestor was Louis XIII, back in the early 1600s. Henri was descended from Louis XIII's eldest son Louis XIV whereas Philippe was descended from Louis XIII's gay younger son Philippe I, Duke of Orleans.\n\nAlso, interestingly enough, a surviving French monarchy that maintains its popularity during World War I could actually see a rally around the flag effect around itself during and after this time period. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAgreed. BTW, off-topic, but do you think that China militarily intervenes if the United States invades North Vietnam during the Vietnam War just like China previously militarily intervened in the Korean War once United States and United Nations troops entered North Korean territory in late 1950? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat percentage odds would you have placed on China militarily intervening in my scenario above? 75%? More than that? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks; got it! By the way, if Hitler and the Nazis never actually come to power in Germany but Germany still eventually launches a revanchist war against Poland over Danzig and the Polish Corridor (since even Weimar German politicians STRONGLY detested the Polish Corridor and considered it unbearable and intolerable as a long-term solution!), do you think that France would have still militarily intervened on Poland's side in such a war? Or would it have depended on what exactly Britain would have done? As in, if Britain refuses to militarily intervene in such a war, then France will look for a way to weasel out of its alliance with Poland? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense. Off-topic, but just how much do you know about Byzantine history? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that the Third Crusade actually succeeds in conquering Jerusalem if Frederick Barbarossa lives? Also, if so, just how much will this extend the lifespan of the Crusader states in comparison to real life? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat if Thomas Dewey runs a more energetic presidential campaign in 1948 and thus narrowly wins the US Presidency that year as opposed to narrowly losing the US Presidency like he did to Harry Truman in 1948 in real life? How would a US President Thomas Dewey have handled Korea and the various other problems that would have emerged during his Presidency? Also, would President Dewey have actually gotten reelected in 1952--and who exactly would his Democratic opponent have been? Harry Truman again? Someone else? If so, whom?\n\nPersonally, I don't see Korea going much differently than in real life and I also think that Korea will likely doom Dewey's reelection chances in 1952 in this scenario, though I'm unsure who exactly the Democratic presidential nominee in 1952 in this TL is actually going to be.\n\nThoughts? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you believe that the Khmer Rouge are ever actually going come to power in Cambodia if Hubert Humphrey wins the US Presidency in 1968 and subsequently refuses to bomb Cambodia like Richard Nixon did in real life? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat do you think would have occurred had Germany been reunified in the early 1950s on the basis of the Stalin Note (assuming, for the sake of argument, that Stalin's offer in regards to this was genuinely sincere)? So, having Germany become unified, capitalist, and permanently neutral similar to Austria once the Soviet Union withdrew from eastern Austria in 1955. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat if, during the Vietnam War, the US would have proceeded to invade Cambodia and Laos and advance all of the way up to the Mekong River in the south and up to the San River in the north? :\n\nhttps://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/Mekong_river_basin.png\n\nLet's also say that the US would have also refrained from ever giving these conquered territories back to Cambodia and Laos but would have insisted on having South Vietnam permanently occupy these territories after the US would have withdrawn from there, whenever that might have been, so that the Vietnamese Communists could not infiltrate these territories and use them as a base with which to strike South Vietnam. So, basically, these territories would serve a function for South Vietnam similar to the function that the Rhineland served for France in the post-World War I years and decades--until 1936, in fact!\n\nBut Yeah, ultimately the US's logic with such a move might be to significantly expand the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) between North Vietnam and South Vietnam by hundreds of miles into Laos and Cambodia. After all, a very long demilitarized zone, as in Korea, works much better than a short demilitarized zone, as was the case in Vietnam in real life. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense, I suppose. Honestly, without a very long DMZ, I'm simply very skeptical that the U.S. military intervention in Vietnam was actually worth it. No point in fighting the Viet Cong if the North Vietnamese can simply replenish the Viet Cong's numbers with additional North Vietnamese troops, after all.\n\nBy the way, off-topic, but do you think that there was any realistic way for Syria to end up becoming Shi'a-majority (counting Alawites as Shi'a for the purposes of this question of mine) in the 20th century? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIn regards to Vietnam, the U.S. might have been good at tactics but poor at overall strategy--similar to the Germans in the World Wars, I suppose! As for Alawites, our article about them mentions that they are originally an offshoot of Shi'a Islam, so grouping them together with Shi'ites is not altogether irrational. As for a mass Sunni outflow from Syria, that has to a large extent already been occurring with the Syrian refugee crisis over the last decade.\n\nJust how much Afghan refugees do you think the U.S., Canada, and other Western countries will accept if the Taliban will ever once again come to power in Afghanistan and thus there will be a new Afghan refugee crisis? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat's interesting is that when it came to Indochinese refugees, the West was much more willing to accept them in huge numbers in spite of their extremely long geographic distance from the West. But of course Indochinese refugees generally weren't Muslims, so ...\n\nBut Yeah, I do think that due to the U.S.'s extremely long presence in Afghanistan, there might be a sense of moral duty among more liberal-minded Americans to accept some or even many Afghan refugees–but only after extremely heavily vetting them beforehand, of course! U.S. pro-immigration sentiments nowadays are actually significantly more widespread than they were even 20 or 30 years ago: https://news.gallup.com/poll/313106/americans-not-less-immigration-first-time.aspx Of course, Afghan refugees who aren't going to pass vetting are going to have to be resettled in third countries–very possibly somewhere in the Muslim world. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIf there is no Spanish-American War, is the German Empire or the Empire of Japan more likely to acquire the Philippines in place of the U.S.? Also, does no U.S. control over the Philippines make the possibility of an eventual US-Japan war considerably less likely? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWith the German–Spanish Treaty (1899), the German Empire actually did purchase several Pacific islands from Spain shortly after the end of the Spanish-American War in real life. So, it would not be unreasonable to assume that the German Empire would have also wanted to purchase the Philippines from Spain if it could have ever actually done this. Kaiser Wilhelm II was a huge fan of Weltpolitik and finding the German Empire a place in the sun, after all. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThe U.S. purchased Louisiana in 1803, purchased the Mexican Cession in 1848, and purchased Alaska in 1867. All of those were large territories. Similarly, France purchased Corsica from Genoa in (I believe) 1768. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nFor what it's worth, I just want to make it clear that I always enjoy hearing your thoughts even if I don't always agree with them 100%. Seriously. I certainly strongly enjoy talking to you. :)\n\nAnyway, another question: What kind of French King do you think that Philippe I, Duke of Orleans would have been had his elder brother Louis XIV died of typhoid fever in 1658, as he apparently almost did in real life? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThe Fronde was crushed back when Louis XIV and Philippe were still minors if I recall correctly, so that part is probably unlikely to change. The rest of your analysis here does appear to be spot-on, though! I am curious as to whether Philippe, being the homosexual that he was, would have still actually bothered reproducing if he himself would have been the French King and thus would have had no one more powerful than him to boss him around, though. As far as I know, Philippe didn't really like having sex with women and only did it because his brother Louis XIV essentially ordered him to. Without Louis XIV, is anyone else ever actually going to order Philippe to do this–especially if there would be a serious risk of them getting seriously punished for telling the French King what to do in regards to his sex life? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIn regards to Philippe, that makes sense. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIn addition to Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Grenada, do you see any other realistic cases where the U.S. could have actually realistically used military force during the Cold War in order to prevent a country from falling to Communist rule–or, alternatively, removing Communists there from power if they already came to power there? I could think of Cuba if the U.S. would have actually decided to provide U.S. ground troops to help with the Bay of Pigs invasion, but what else? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIn real life, we saw Vietnam Korea, China (if one considers Taiwan to be a part of China), Germany, and Yemen be split for decades as a result of Communism. In turn, this made me wonder--which additional realistic cases of countries being split for decades as a result of Communism (and/or some other kind of totalitarianism) could there have realistically been? So far, I can think of:\n\n-Japan had the Soviet Union managed to invade and conquer Hokkaido and install a pro-Soviet Communist Japanese government there, in the event that World War II in Asia would have lasted longer.\n\n-Greece, where the Peloponnese and some or all Greek islands in the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas could have broken off and formed an independent free and capitalist Greek state in the event that the rest of Greece would have fallen to Communism as a result of a Communist victory in the Greek Civil War in the late 1940s.\n\n-Yugoslavia, where the West could have militarily intervened to prop up Tito's government in Slovenia and Croatia in the event that the Soviet Union would have ever invaded Yugoslavia and installed a new pro-Soviet Yugoslav Communist government in Belgrade.\n\n-Thailand, where Isan could have separated from the rest of Thailand and become an independent Communist state, especially if given significant help from Vietnamese and Laotian Communists. AFAIK, the Isan people speak a language that is more similar to Laotian than to the languages that are spoken in the rest of Thailand. Still, this would have been more of a separatist movement than a case of a country having two rival, competing governments.\n\n-Afghanistan had the Soviet Union tried to partition it in the 1980s as opposed to trying to subdue all of it.\n\n-Russia had the Communists only managed to take over a part of Russia rather than all of Russia during the Russian Civil War.\n\n-Had the Chinese Nationalists held onto a part of mainland China, China would have still been divided, but the dividing line would have been in mainland China instead of across the Taiwan Strait.\n\n-Austria had the Soviet Union not withdrawn from its part of Austria in 1955 and instead set up a pro-Soviet Communist East Austrian state.\n\n-Iran if the Soviet Union refuses to withdraw from the part of Iran that it occupied (specifically northern Iran) after the end of World War II and instead decides to create an independent pro-Soviet Communist state of North Iran there.\n\n-Perhaps Turkey had it entered World War II on the Axis side and been split east-to-west after the end of World War II, with a pro-Soviet Communist East Turkey and a pro-Western West Turkey.\n\nHowever which additional realistic examples of this could there have been? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nMakes sense. By the way, off-topic, but what would it have realistically taken to make the Baltic states (especially Latvia and Estonia) Slavic-majority with a \"point of departure\" (from real life) of 1850 or later? Also, no mass deportations or mass murder, please. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nTBH, I was thinking of having the Baltic states become Slavic-majority so that Russia would have a much longer coastline on (and thus much greater access to) the Baltic Sea without any serious risk of secessionism. That, and Russia's borders would also look considerably nicer if it would have managed to keep both Belarus and the Baltic states as opposed to only being able to keep Belarus. It would be comparing the U.S. only having a small Pacific coastline versus the U.S. having a large Pacific coastline–or for that matter comparing Poland's current Baltic coastline to the narrow Polish Corridor in the interwar era. There's absolutely no comparison–now is there?\n\nAlso, in regards to East Prussia, I was thinking of avoiding Communist rule in Russia as well as avoiding the extreme demographic devastation of World War II in this scenario. So, in this scenario, it's unclear that Russia would have ever actually acquired northern East Prussia–as in, present-day Kaliningrad Oblast.\n\nIn addition, off-topic, but in the absence of the World Wars, which peoples would have permanently ended up becoming outnumbered in their traditional homelands sooner or later? I'm thinking the Kazakhs, maybe Kyrgyz, Mongols, Estonians, Latvians--who else? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat do you think would have happened had Vladimir Lenin died or, alternatively, gotten assassinated sometime before 1917? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nTo be honest, I think that during the last 150 or 200 years, Lenin would be one of the top people who would have deserved an early death–whether via assassination or via some other method. Even more deserving than both Hitler and Stalin, in my honest opinion.\n\nAnyway, how do you see French history over the 1790s and 19th century progressing had Louis XVI not fled to Varennes in 1791 and thus would have kept his throne and avoided execution along with his wife? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your answer here. BTW, I was NEVER actually advocating for ANY form of cultural genocide here–or for that matter, any kind of displacement of anyone either. For what it's worth, I wasn't actually advocating having Slavs colonize the Baltic states; rather, I was simply flirting with this idea. But even so, this would be a VERY FAR cry from ACTUAL cultural genocide considering that the Balts would still have Russian citizenship and full legal equality and still be free to reproduce, to speak their own languages, to freely express their own cultures, to have and keep all of their civil rights, to remain in their current places of residence indefinitely, et cetera. So, quite different from what's happening in Burma and Xinjiang, with the pogroms, forced expulsions, and/or reeducation camps. The situation of the Balts in my hypothetical scenario would have been more comparable to Mexicans in the Mexican Cession after the US conquest of these territories during the Mexican-American War in 1848. Still nowhere near ideal by ANY means, but not exactly cultural genocide either. Or perhaps comparable to the situation of the Tajiks, Uzbeks, Turkmen, Hazaras, et cetera during the Pashtun colonization of northern Afghanistan.\n\nBy the way, what do you think would have happened had the Napoleonic Empire survived for decades or more after Napoleon Bonaparte's death? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat do you think would have occurred if the ISIS Caliphate from its peak in either late 2014 or 2015 (you can decide on the specific date for this) would have been transferred back in time to 640 AD (you can decide on the specific date for this) while the equivalent regions (eastern Syria and western Iraq/Mesopotamia) from the very same point in time in 640 AD would have been transferred forward in time to the exact same location in time in either late 2014 or 2015 with the help of invisible and completely undetectable Alien Space Bats? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAlien Space Bats are a common theme on alternatehistory.com and on various other alternate history discussion groups, such as this one: https://groups.google.com/g/alt.history.what-if/c/TF_3J_tM1HU Anyway, another question for you: Do you think that the Crusader states could have ever actually had a realistic shot at surviving up to the present-day or at least for centuries longer had particular events in history gone differently? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks! I'll definitely take a look at that book! By the way, which countries in Europe and the Middle East do you think were the most likely to have their monarchies still eventually be overthrown even without both World Wars? Russia? Who else? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nTwo additional questions for you:\n\n1. Had there been no Spanish-American War in 1898 and Japan would have eventually acquired the Philippines from Spain, either through conquest or through purchase, what do you think that a Japanese-ruled Philippines would have looked like? I know that Japan did in fact rule over the Philippines for several years during World War II in real life, but that was during wartime as opposed to during peacetime and I was thinking more in terms of decades for the purposes of my question here.\n\n2. What do you think would have happened had the Niedermayer-Hentig Expedition succeeded and thus Afghanistan would have entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers in either 1915 or 1916? For instance, do you think that the Entente Powers could have successfully sponsored any separatist movements within Afghanistan similar to what they did with the Arab Revolt in the Ottoman Empire? Do you see Japan sending any of its own troops to Afghanistan to help out its ally Britain in regards to this? Et cetera.\n\nFuturist110 (talk)\n\nRe: Afghanistan: I wasn't so much interested in having it change the outcome of the war (which is virtually certainly won't) so much as wondering if the Allies could actually sponsor and support any successful separatist movements/uprisings there. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThe fact that the Central Powers were able to send a mission to Afghanistan in the middle of World War I in spite of Afghanistan's remoteness suggests that doing this might not have been as hard as you think, though.\n\nAlso, as a side question: What do you think happens afterwards if Felice Orsini succeeds in killing Napoleon III in 1858 in the Orsini affair? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nTBH, I was specifically wondering about the effects of a Central Powers Afghanistan on its immediate neighborhood as opposed to on World War I as a whole, which as you said will almost certainly be negligible. I was wondering if we could actually see an independent Hazarajat in this scenario, for instance. Or perhaps the Afghan government engaging in mass ethnic cleansing similar to what the Ottoman Empire did to its Armenians, Greeks, et cetera during World War I in real life.\n\nAs for Orsini and killing Napoleon III, if there's no Franco-Prussian War, does Germany ever actually get unified–and, if so, is an extremely early Franco-German alliance ever actually a realistic possibility without the Alsace-Lorraine dispute actually sending in the way of good Franco-German relations? Sure, France might be upset at being dethroned as Europe's top dog, but just what exactly is it actually going to do about this? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that if the Kingdom of France under the Ancien regime would have ever actually been able to expand all of the way up to its natural borders, do you believe that this would have resulted in France then becoming a satisfied power or do you believe that France would have continued expanding in search of new French natural borders even further to the east? I know that Napoleonic France kept expanding, but what Napoleonic France did isn't necessarily the same thing that what the Kingdom of France under the Ancien regime would have done. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat would the post-World War I peace settlement have looked like after a short and quick World War I? Let's say that--SOMEHOW--Germany is able to achieve the giant Cannae-equivalent in the West that Schlieffen apparently envisioned--or at least hoped for--and is thus able to quickly knock France out of World War I and to subsequently put the overwhelming majority of its military forces onto the Eastern Front. In such a scenario, I suspect that it's only a matter of time before Russia likewise sues for peace, especially considering that even with British help, I just don't think that Tsarist Russia would actually be able to hold out indefinitely against Imperial Germany in an essentially one-on-one fight.\n\nSo, what exactly do the post-World War I peace terms look like in this scenario? In the West, I could imagine Germany stripping France of iron ore-rich Briey and Longwy. Perhaps even Nancy and the rest of Lorraine if Germany was REALLY ambitious. Germany might also outright annex Luxembourg. I don't know if Germany would actually be willing to make any territorial changes at Belgium's expense, especially if preserving Belgium's territorial integrity would be a useful bargaining chip for Germany to get Britain to make peace after France falls. As for the Eastern Front, at the very least, Germany will strip Russia of Poland, Lithuania, and Courland--and also Romania almost certainly joins the Central Powers side in World War I in this TL and thus acquires Bessarabia from Russia at the end of the war. The crucial question, of course, is whether Germany would have actually wanted to go farther than this, especially if it was clear that it was clearly and decisively winning its war against Russia after the defeat of France. If so, I could also see Germany stripping Russia of Livonia and Estonia. Ukraine is more interesting because AFAIK Ukrainian separatist sentiments didn't actually reach a critical mass in Russia in 1914-1916, so I don't know if Germany could actually rally mass Ukrainian support in favor of the creation of an independent Ukrainian state. What Germany could do, however, would be to annex additional western Ukrainian territories such as Volhynia, Podolia, and MAYBE even Kiev to Austria-Hungary, with Germany making the case that the Ukrainians in these territories would be better off under Austro-Hungarian rule than under Russian rule. Having Austria-Hungary annex ALL OF Ukraine might be too much for it to swallow, though.\n\nAs for Serbia, it might very well experience some kind of regime change, with it losing Macedonia to Bulgaria and Kosovo to Albania. Austria-Hungary might also strip Serbia of its part of the Sandjak. Italy I suspect would have remained neutral throughout the entirety of World War I in this TL, though it might also get Trentino (but not South Tyrol, Trieste, Istria, or Fiume) as a \"Thank you!\" present (for its neutrality during World War I) from Germany and Austria-Hungary either during or after the end of World War I in this TL.\n\nAnyway, any thoughts on all of this? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nAgreed with your entire analysis here. In regards to Austria-Hungary, I think that Germany would have aimed to transform it into a nominally independent German satellite state, similar to what Russia has aimed to do to various other ex-USSR countries after 1991 in real life. As you said, partition of an ally would be completely out of the question, but transforming Austria-Hungary into a German satellite state is certainly VERY possible and indeed probably VERY realistic and even VERY likely. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nDo you think that Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ethiopian Jews would have remained in the countries that they had lived in for centuries up to the present-day if it wasn't for Israel's creation in 1948? Futurist110 (talk)\n\nThanks for your response here. BTW, which additional territories were the most likely to ever become US colonies? I mean other than the territories that actually did become US colonies in real life, such as the Philippines, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, et cetera. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nIf you will take a look at the map of the top of this article, you will see that the population in much of northern Kazakhstan has fallen between 1990 and 2020–sometimes significantly so–whereas Nur-Sultan's/Astana's population has increased over three-fold during the very same time period:\n\nhttps://www.unz.com/akarlin/map-population-growth-in-eastern-europe-1990-2020/\n\nhttps://www.unz.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/map-russia-population-growth-1990-2020.png\n\nI really don't think that this is a coincidence at all. Rather, I think that Nursultan Nazarbayev purposely aimed to Kazakhify northern Kazakhstan by bringing in a lot of additional Kazakhs over there at the same time that a lot of Russians and Germans emigrated from Kazakhstan, especially from northern Kazakhstan. Futurist110 (talk)\n\nYou might be right: https://fsu.digital.flvc.org/islandora/object/fsu:175688/datastream/PDF/view Futurist110 (talk)\n\nWhat do you believe that the post-World War II peace settlement would have looked like had France not fallen in 1940 and subsequently won World War II together with Britain? 68.228.73.154 (talk)\n\nSeems like an interesting question. Any thoughts on this? 68.4.99.100 (talk)\n\nHello Xuxl. Many thanks for your very prompt translation. With your permission I will add it, with an attribution to yourself, at the upload page for File:Le Régional 7 August 1890.jpg. Regards. Martinevans123 (talk)\n\nThank you for your drastic changes to my dreadful translating/traducing. But (cough) if you have a few spare minutes, there's a little more of the same, here. This probably has howlers too.\n\nOn EN/FR: the article Ismo Hölttö here is nothing special, but I like to think that it's solid. (If only I could read Finnish, I might realize how very wrong I am about this.) I've just noticed the (feeble) existence of fr:Ismo Hölttö, which I think is an insult to the biographee and also (thanks to search engines' high ranking of Wikipédia) to inquisitive readers. (From the same creator: this.) -- Hoary (talk)\n\nI looked at the second translated passage as well yesterday and frankly, I didn't see anything that cried out for change. You did a good job on that one (and your draft was pretty good on the first, given how difficult the wording was). I'm always ready to help out if you run into more convoluted French text that needs translation or explanation. Xuxl (talk)\n\nThank you for the valuation; but really, I think my translation was a crock. And that's to be expected, given how very little French I've bothered to read during the last several decades. Come to think of it, it's been decades since I last found myself in a French-speaking environment. Time to explore the world! Oh, ah -- no it isn't.... Hoary (talk)\n\nOn Hölttö, the French article is well and truly a stub (the stubbiest stub that ever stubbed ?). I think someone just created the page to erase a red link on another page. I recently ran into a similar problem with fr:Milena Busquets; in this case I was able to insert some content, thanks largely to the Spanish article. With Finnish, you could ask User:JIP, who is Finnish and active on the ref desks, for help. Xuxl (talk)\n\nYes, I previously made a shameless appeal for Finnish-language help; but stupidly didn't bother to suggest where it was most needed or was most likely to be helpful, so little wonder that the appeal didn't work. The Finnish-language article only started six years after the English-language one, and it hasn't been edited at all during the last six years, so maybe there just is little interest among Finns. Aarghh, fr:I. K. Inha is similarly terrible. (Even though it's about the man who created this!) -- Hoary (talk)\n\nHello!
