A VIEW OF THE MISSIONARY FIELD AT THE BEGINNING OF 1906 By Mr. A. Quasco, Secretary-General of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith. In a powerful discourse delivered in Lyons, May 3, 1905, upon the occasion of the 83d anniversary of the foundation of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, the Very Rev. Canon Joseph L6mann said : \" What a consolation it is to a missionary, what a feeling of joy takes hold of his heart, when, after a day^s journeying through an unexplored country, he says to himself upon retiring at night : * To- day the cross has been planted a little farther on; the frontiers of the kingdom of Jesus, my beloved Master, have been extended ; from this forward the Our Father will be said where, heretofore, no one has uttered these blessed words.' \" At the beginning of the year 1906, which, in the mystery of its future, seems to portend great events of serious consequence for some Christian countries, it is a pleasure for us to look back and repeat with the missionary at the close of his da/s travel: \"Praised be Jesus Christ ! The frontiers of His kingdom have been extended.*' L Grod has blessed the year 1905 for missions. The Church has con- tinued on her way with that air of exalted serenity which she pre- serves in the midst of the very worst human agitation, with that calm perseverance which no trial can disconcert, dressing her wounds, filling up the furrows which time makes, enlarging the sphere of her activity with firmness and prudence. The apostolic delegations of Constantinople and Syria were without incumbents, a want supplied by the appointment of Bishop Tacci for Constantinople and Bishop Giannini for Syria. The former had been bishop of Citta della 3 4 A View op the Missionaby Field Pieve, the latter filled the important position of custodian of the Holy Land^in Jerusalem. The formerly vacant sees of Lahore, Tine and Myeone, Hexham and Newcastle, Sappa, Bucharest, and Rockhampton now have their bish- ops. Coadjutors have been appointed for several sees, as those of Rochester, Scutari, Alessio, and Leeds. Monsigneur Hennel has been appointed coadjutor to Bishop Verdier, vicar apostolic of Tahiti. Vicars apostolic have recently been installed in Southern Ho-nan, Hong-Kong, Southwestern Hu-peh, and Pekin, in Northern Chen-si; Prefects in Zambesi and Reti. The prefecture of the Gulf of St. Law- rence, in charge of the Eudist Fathers, has been created a vicariate, the same as Cameroun, December 29, 1904. The vicariate of Indian Territory has been made a diocese and a new diocese has been formed in the ecclesiastical province of Milwaukee. The vicariate apostolic of Batavia no longer includes the part of Borneo belonging to Hol- land; this district has been made a prefecture apostolic and is evan- gelized by the Dutch Capuchins. The reports that we receive from all quarters attest a large increase of conversions. At the present day, pagans would come in crowds to receive the bread of the word of God, if the number of evangelical laborers could be multiplied. The same appeal and the same cry for regeneration rise from the depths of Asia, the deserts and forests of Africa, and the distant islands of Oceanica. In the Protestant parts of ancient Europe itself, prejudice is growing weaker and weaker and Rome is gaining recruits who by character, as well as by numbers, would afford some consolation for the all too striking apos- tasies, if a Christian can be consoled when he hears his Master de- nied, the name of Jesus blasphemed, and His doctrine despised. Leaving Europe, let us spread before our eyes the map of the do- minion of the Propaganda and ask the immense Celestial Empire what it is doing for the religion of Christ. His answer will be: ^^ The hour is not yet come when the majority of my children shall understand the word that comes to them from the west. They con- tinue to do homage to their gods of stone and wood which have eyes and see not, ears and hear not ; still, I allow you to build your churches, schools, hospitals, and orphanages by the side of pagodas and Buddhist temples; I permit you to found your works of charity and perform your works of zeal; I surround your missionaries with exterior marks of my respect and I grant them liberty. If you ask them, they will A View of the Missionaey Field 6 tell you that my mandarins are polite and that I punish those who interfere with the action of your priests.\" We have questioned the missionaries^ religious of the old orders who were the first to visit the immense regions bathed by the waters of the Peiho, the Yangtse-Kliang, the Hoang-ho, the Saghalien — Franciscans, Dominicans, and Jesuits ; we have questioned the priests of the Foreign Missions of Paris, the Lazarists, the Augustinians of Manila; we have questioned missionaries of societies more recently founded, priests of the seminary of Milan, of that of Saints Peter and Paul in Rome, of the Congregation of Scheut, of that of Steyl : all have given the same reply : \" We are spreading our forces. The ruins made by the Boxers and Brigands, wherever they passed, are being rebuilt. Everywhere, in proportion to our resources, we are blessing sanctuaries and calling Sisters to nurse the sick and care for the aged, infirm, and orphans. In all parts the number of con- versions is increasing in far greater proportion than we had deemed possible only a few years since. We number nearly 900,000 Chris- tians, more than during the most prosperous epochs of the Catholic apostolate in China. If the rule of peace lasts for several years, we shall be able to present to our Divine Master a harvest formerly beyond all hope.*' The long struggle between Bussia and Japan which bathed the plains of Manchuria with blood and reddened the seas of the Par East might have engendered troubles in the Chinese provinces situ- ated near the place of hostilities. No such reaction occurred. The war is over and thousands are enjojring a security unknown to them for a long time before. In the disturbances which followed the con- clusion of peace in Japan, some of our institutions, founded at a great cost of labor by our missionaries, were destroyed. These acts of vio- lence indicated no especial hostility against the Catholic church. In Japan, no antipathy is felt against the Christian religion, but who can account for the actions of a mob beyond control? Eeligious in- difference obtains in the land of the Mikado. Indifference is, per- haps, not the most exact term to express the state of affairs, for the press discusses religious problems at length; however, all controver- sies on so interesting a subject have never led to anything beyond pure theory; so far, there has been no practical outcome from the mass of reasoning and contradictory doctrines which fill the publica- tions of the doctors of the country. On the other hand, it is to be observed that a Japanese, once a Christian, is firm in his faith. The 6 A ViBW OP THE M188IONABY Field descendants of those converted by St. Francis Xavier afford ample proof of this fact \" The Japanese has ahown/^ writes Bishop Chat- ron, of Osaka, \" that, as he is faithful to his country and faithful to his emperor, he will also be faithful to his God after he knows Him/* If we seem to linger on a soil which has drunk in the blood of its prophets in so large a measure, it is because in the face of the resurrec- tion of a people, any dream of the future is permissible. But are we indulging in a dream if we love to think of the day when Japan, com- pleting its transformation, will abandon ancient cults to return to the Faith and its belief in the true God? We have no right to despair of the future. The importance which Japan has acquired in the world must not let us forget that all souls have an equal value in the eyes of our Sovereign Lord. The conquests of missionaries, where they obtain, have an inestimable value. In Indo-China, as in India, tiiere has been a marked movement of conversions. Continuing our apostolic journey, we pass to other missions in Asia, situated, however, in that Asia where, in olden days, there reigned supreme those great civilizations of which ancient authors give us some account. Here the Catholic missionary finds a greater difficulty than in former years; nevertheless, his efforts are rewarded by the return of a number of eastern schismatics to the bosom of the church. On the shores of the Mediterranean the work continues with un- abated zeal, though sometimes the laborers are saddened when they see that these regions so rich in great monuments of the past are being invaded by Protestant and schismatic sects. In Africa all is fresh ground. Portuguese, Italian, Spanish, and French missionaries visited the coast in earlier times, but the central part had not been evangelized; or, if intrepid religious penetrated into the interior, all traces of their passing have been lost. At the present day every part of the continent is covered and the prospect is very bright. From the depths of the jungles inhabited by cannibals. Bishop Augouard writes that missionaries are transforming the ferocious Bondjos, ravening wolves, into lambs; the expression \"ravening wolves \" is not used by the brave prelate as a figure of speech ; the term expresses a truth. Consoling news are coming from the missions of the Fathers of the Holy Ghost. Missionaries always count upon A ViBW OF THE M1B8IONAEY Field 7 colleGting the fruits of their labors at Easter time; in 1905 the haryest was greater than ever before. In all parts there has been a larger attendance at services^ numerous communions^ and a marked increase in the number of baptisms and catechumens. The same message has come from the Upper Nile, where the Fathers of Mill Hill, under the guidance of Bishop Hanlon, have established a most beautiful mis- sion. We should mention the magnificent vicariates of the White Fathers, who are doing splendid work. Many of them are laboring on so fertile a field that, on great feast days, scenes similar to those of the primitive church are repeated. Franciscans, Capuchins, Jesuits, Lazarists, priests of the African Missions of Lyons, Oblates of Mary, members of the Society of Mary of Qrignon of Montfort, Pallotins, Benedictines, Premonstratensians, Fathers of Steyl, Trappists, missionaries of Scheut, who have estab- lished a most important mission in Belgian Congo, Oblates of St. Francis de Sales on the shores of the Orange Biver and at Namaqua- land, and native priests — these different representatives of the pacific army of Christ have penetrated everywhere to invite tribes of fetich- ists and Mussulmans to come out from the darkness in which, for so long a time, they have been living a degraded existence. Not only has the number of baptisms multiplied, but persecution has ceased where it raged for several months. The mission of the Gallas has passed through a critical stage. In the month of July, 1904, Father Basile, 0. M. Cap., vested with proper authority, en- tered Addis Abeba as the recognized chaplain of the European col- ony. Even so he was called upon to protect a worthy priest, a con- vert from heresy, from the fury of the natives, February 17, 1906; whilst two of the most prominent Catholics, Ato Atenu6, historiogra- pher of the empire, judge of the court of Has Makowen, and control- ler of civil registers, and Ato Paulo, governor of Schoba and guardian of the gate of the empire on the desert of the Adals, were deprived of their offices, all their property being confiscated. The situation is now somewhat better. + In America the work of Gk>d is progressing in peace. In the United States the name of Gk>d is invoked upon all solemn occasions of national life and the Catholic church enjoys full liberty, continu- ing her glorious and peaceful conquests. + 8 A View of the Missionaet Field In Oceanica^ the year 1905 records the happy event of the progress of evangelization in the Hebrides and Solomon Islands, and particu- larly on the island of Guadalcanar, whose inhabitants are always fierce and hostile. No one dared venture on the coast inhabited by the ferocious tribe of the Gaoumbas, one of the most ignorant and savage of the islands, till a Marist missionary, recalling the example of those gone before him, set aside his fears and gained his way among them. The vicariate of the Gilbert Islands, one of the most recent missions of Oceanica, and also one of the poorest, as the cocoa tree forms the only source of riches of the archipelago, deserves our attention. Seventeen years ago, Father Bontemps, of the Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Issoudun, together with a priest, the present Et. Eev. Leray, vicar apostolic, and a lay brother, arrived on these islands; he was the first Catholic missionary to plant the cross in this region. Now the mission registers 51 missionaries and 14,000 baptized souls. On a tract of land 625 miles long there are 80 churches, 80 schools, 10 residences for priests and assistants, 8 houses for Sisters, and 80 dwellings for catechists. n. If the year 1905 has been a prosperous one for missions, it has not been exempt from the evils that are a consequence of events, the fury of the elements, and the malice of man. We shall pass over the persecutions which some of the vicariates have suffered from civil authority; our readers know how bitter such trials are. We shall refer only to the blood that has been shed. In the German colonies of Africa, we mourn the murder of Bishop Spies, of the Bavarian Benedictines of the monastery of St. Odile, vicar apostolic of German Zanguebar; of two lay brothers, and two Sibters. In Thibet, four missionaries and several Christians were massacred. 4- Earthquakes were felt in Iceland and Montenegro. In the latter country, on June 1, about six o'clock in the morning, a violent shock disturbed the whole of Albania and Black Mountain. The cathedral of Antivari, the only sanctuary of the archiepiscopal city, was com- pletely destroyed; all the churches and dwellings of the clergy were damaged, whilst the frightened people took refuge under tents. During the night of December 29, 1904, a terrible cyclone passed over the Vavau group of islands, in Oceanica. At daybreak a sight of general ruin met the eye. All the houses were overturned, trees A View of the Missionaby Field 9 were uprooted, and plantations destroyed. The natives sat in dismay on the niins of their property. \" During the twenty-four years that I have been at the mission/' writes Rt. Rev. Olier, coadjutor of Bishop Lamaze, '^ I have never seen such desolation.'' 4- Quang-binh and Quang-tin, in Northern Cochin China, were visited by a terrible flood. The mission suffered very much. In Cambodia, twelve Christian settlements were destroyed by a tidal wave. A de- patch from Bishop Gendreau, of Western Tonkin, informed us that a typhoon, accompanied by heavy rains for six days^ destroyed the whole mission during the early part of October. The typhoon of September 1, which desolated the coast of China, especially at Shanghai and Ningpo, caused untold suffering. The sea burst all its bounds, rushed over the vast plains, carrying away bridges, engulfing vessels, overturning houses, and drowning more than 200,000 people. In August, the mission of the Marshall Islands, recently founded, was likewise destroyed by a cyclone. The result of great labor van- ished in a few hours. 4- Famine has likewise raged in India and sad accounts have reached us from Kumbhakonam, Pondicherry, and Trichinopoly. The scourge with all its horrors has imposed heavy obligations of charity upon mis- sionaries; but, at the same time, it has been the means of salvation for many natives. Southwestern Mongolia has likewise suffered from fam- ine with its train of sickness and misery; and, whilst appeals were re- ceived from the famishing in Asia, a cry of anguish came from Abys- sinia, the land of the (Dallas, where grasshoppers, in impenetrable clouds, alighted on the fields, utterly destroying the crops. We must give a word to the sleeping sickness, which continues its horrible ravages in Africa. In some places whole villages have dis- appeared and missionaries are obliged to abandon districts which are deserts now, but were once flourishing settlements. 4- As in the past, we have sustained heavy losses by death. Among the missionaries who died during 1905 are : Monsigneur Piavi, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem for sixteen years; Archbishop Melizan, of Colombo, who died in Toulouse, where he had hoped to regain his health, shattered by thirty-seven years of apostolic labors; Arch- bishop Chapelle, of New Orleans; Archbishop de Homstein, of Bu- 10 A YlSW OF THE MiSSIONABY FiBLD charest; Biahop Ossi, of Quilon, who met his death by an accident; Bishop Pavier, the illustrious vicar apostolic of Northern Chi-li, who exercised his ministry in China for forty-three years; Bishop Bray, of Northern Kwang-si; Bishop Dartois, of Dahomey; Bishop Elans, of the Gk)ld Coast; Bishop Bizzi, of Northern Chan-si; Bishop Usse^ of Northern Burma; Bt. B^v. Monsignor Potron, titulary Bishop of Jericho, who rendered great services as commissary-general of the Holy Land and procurator of the Franciscan missions; and Bt Bev. Monsignor Savdli Spinola, secretary-general of the Sacred Congre- gation of the Propaganda for the oriental rites. Bev. Gfeorges Joseph Eich had been appointed titulary bishop of Setif and coadjutor of Bishop Verdier, May 27, 1904, but his poor health prevented his accepting the charge. He died at Papeete, March 6, 1906, after thirty-nine years of apostolic labors and travels in Tahiti, Moorea, Tuamotu, the Gambier Islands, Easter Island, the Windward Islands, and the Cook Archipelago. V. Bev. Father Lejeune, prefect apostolic of the Lower Niger, re- stored this mission so tried by the death of several of its chief and suc- ceeded in placing it in a less precarious condition; the fatigues of hard labor exhausted the strength of this brave missionary. The Society of Mary has been afflicted by the loss of its superior- general, V. Bev. Father Martin. This venerable religious had never been a missionary, but for twenty years he directed a family of apostles who have devoted their energies and even sacrificed their lives to apostolic work in Oceanica, as did Blessed Chanel at Futuna and Bishop Epalle in the Solomon Islands. 4- We could mention other losses in the evangelical army. However, we must not weep over those who have responded to the divine call when they heard the voice from on high bidding them : \" Leave thy country and go.'* God Himself is their reward. But as to our- selves, have we done our part during the year 1906? Have we re- sponded to the pressing solicitations of those who have held out their hands to us ? Have we given the glass of water which God does not allow to go unrewarded, especially when it relieves His apostles? Have we given the most necessary alms of prayer that rises to the throne of God to fall down again upon our souls as refreshing dew ? It is true, we have our own needs, but the charity of Christ invites us to think of our brethren, to insure our own salvation. Unfor- tunate shall we be if we can not render an exact account of the talents confided to us. THE SOCIETIES OF CATHOLIC MISSIONARIES IX THE CONGREGATION OF THE OBLATES OF MARY IMMACULATE I. Origin of the Congregation. On Auguflt 1, 1782, there was bom in Aix-en-Provence, Prance, Charles Joseph Eugene de Mazenod, who, thirty-four years later, founded the Congregation of the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immac- ulate. Besisting all the exhortations of his family, who desired to have their illustrious name perpetuated through him, he entered the sem- inary of St. Sulpice, became a disciple of the venerable Father Emery, was ordained priest in Amiens, 1811, and returned to Aix. Bishop Jauflfret having asked him what position he desired, he re- plied: *'Any that will permit me to consecrate all my efforts to the young and to the poor.\" His wish was gratified and he divided his time between instructing classes of children and workmen and visit- ing prisons, hospitals, and the sick. Touched by the forlorn condition of the rural population deprived of priests by the Revolution, he resolved to do all in his power to remedy the distressing state of affairs. However, the work was be- yond his strength; he required the help of other priests animated by the same sentiments. He applied first to a young priest of Aries, Father Tempier, who immediately responded to his appeal and re- mained his devoted assistant and confidant till his death. Attracted by their zeal, other priests joined in their labor; they assembled in an old Carmelite monastery which formed the cradle of a religious family, the influence of which, in less than a half century, was to be felt throughout the world. 4- 11 12 The Oblates of Mary Immaoulate Under the name of Oblates of St. Charles, or Missionaries of Prov- ence, the first companions of Father de Mazenod devoted themselves to the missions in the villages of central France. To make their min- istry more efficacious, they wished to submit themselves to a religious rule. Father de Mazenod outlined the code, which was at once ap- Rt. Rev. C. J. B. de Mazenod Bishop of Marseilles and Founder of the Congregation of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. proved by Leo XII, February 17, 1826. The Sovereign Pontiff gave to the young apostles the glorious title which the definition of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, December 8, 1854, made still more dear to them : \" Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate.'^ The Oblates op Mary Imkaculate 13 From this day forward the new society made marvelous progresB; vocations, although numerous, hardly sufficed to supply laborers for the institutions that quickly multiplied. In succession they traversed the seas to penetrate the frozen regions of Upper Canada, to carry the torch of truth into neglected Central Africa, and to labor in India on the island of Ceylon. Father Mazenod, having become bishop of Marseilles, lived long enough to see the expansion of his religious family and set the first landmarks of the works, of which we shall give a short sketch. He died in the fullness of years and merit, May 21, 1861. Since then. Very Rev. Fathers Fabre and Soullier have been at the head of the congregation. Very Eev. Father Cassien Augier, fourth superior-general, was elected May 19, 1898. The Foreign Missions of the Congregation, America. — Lower Canada. — Northwest Canada, seven dioceses or vicariates.

In 1841, Bishop Bourget, of Montreal, addressed a pressing appeal to their founder. At any cost, they must, in the name of Jesus Christ, take possession of the immense territory that stretches to the polar sea. The province of Lower Canada at present numbers 115 Oblate priests and 38 Brothers, who, in 14 residences, exercise their ministry among the whites and Indians. This ministry may consist in preach- ing or parish work in the large cities of Montreal, Quebec, Hull, Ottawa, where the Oblates have charge of a university. Our Lady of the Bosary, etc., or it may consist in traversing the large tracts of timber lands, attending to the wants of the tribes that inhabit Lab- rador and the shores of the St. Lawrence River and Hudson Bay, 4- In the northwestern parts of Lower Canada and the United States there are large tracts of frozen, inhospitable lands, the scene of great self-denial. How many apostles whom we venerate have left the marks of their snowshoes on the interminable carpet of snow which 14 The Oblates of Mary IicicAonLATE covers the soil a large part of the year. The begiiming was hard. Deprivation^ isolation^ difficulties of travel^ lack of means of com- munication— every obstacle prevented the diflfusion of the faith, and all these have been overcome. For a part of the northwest^ at least, times have changed. One vicariate has given rise to another; there are now seven in number. At the same time, a tide of European emigrants has set in for the purpose of colonization. A large part of the territory is devoted to agriculture and stock raising. Vegetation is of quick growth and so Vebt Rev. Cassien Auoieb Superior General of the Oblates. crops are harvested before the sudden and severe winter sets in. Every year brings with it thousands of new inhabitants. This inva- sion of colonists, as it may be called, has brought with it many mate- rial benefits — railroads, organized transportation, and other con- veniences that make life less hard and facilitate the travels of priests on their many missions. On the other hand, how many trials attend so rapid a growth. How may schools, chapels, and missionaries are required I Who is going to furnish them in numbers sufficient to pre- vent the children of God from dying of hunger? The Oblatbs of Maby Iicicaoulate 16 Let us see how Providenoe has blessed the work in behalf of the natiyes and settlers in the seven yicariates. 4- Saint Boniface was the first center founded by the Oblates. Gov- erned by Archbishop Tach6 for forty-five years, it became the chief poet of the ecclesiafitical province in 1871. Under the supervision of Arch- bishop Langevin, 54 priests now care for the spiritual needs of the people ; there are 2*2 bouses or residences, besides 60 posts for the whites and 60 for the Indians. The work is particularly difficult because of the large number of emigrants from France, Gtermany, Poland, Hun- gaiy, Galicia, etc. The Fathers are. obliged to speak six different European languages and three Indian dialects. Progress is mani- fested not only by the increase of conversions, numbering 400 yearly, but by the organization of parishes. There is a Catholic population of about 60,000 souls. 4- The diocese of St Albert presents the same spectacle with less rapid progress, because of the lack of means. Bishop Grandin of holy memory was its pastor for forty-five years; his successor is Bishop L^al. This region was the scene of the last revolt of the natives and half-breeds, who massacred Fathers Faf ard and Marchand in the exercise of their ministry of peace. The vicariate is divided into five districts. There are 23 parishes and missions, besides fifty posts served by 67 religious, priests, or catechists. It possesses a sem- inary, 36 schools, 4 hospitals, and 63 churches and chapels. The population numbers 27,000 Catholics, 38,000 Protestants, and about 5000 pagans. There are about 300 conversions a year. 4- The neighboring vicariate apostolic of Saskatchewan, which formed a part of the above mentioned prior to 1891, is in charge of Bishop Pascal and conducts the same institutions. It has overcome the diffi- culties of its first organization and is developijig slowly because of its poverty. The bishop states, however, that its progress is sure. In 1898, there were only 8476 Catholics; in 1904, there were 16,740. Immigration has added 36,000 whites ^^ of all kinds '^ to the popula- tion; it is hard to tell how many of these are Catholics. There re- main 6000 to 7000 pagans, of whom about 100 are converted every year. The missionaries are 48 in number, 36 priests and 12 Brothers for 56 churches. Their schools accommodate 800 children. 16 The Oblates op Mary Imkaoulate Mission' ABY Bisuofs of the Conqbeoation of the Oblatbs. Rt. Rjsv. Matthew Gauohbbn Rt. Rev.

Bishop Grouard presides over a territory about 300 miles broad and 760 miles long. This vast solitude, where winds and arctic cold prevail, is inhabited by very interesting tribes. Bread is unknown among them ; they live by fishing and hunting and have no permanent homes, but make long journeys, either in sleds drawn by dogs or on snowshoes, and encamp under the starlit heavens, in the depths of the forest aroimd a hearth of green wood built on the snow. The missionaries travel with the natives, share their dangers and fatigues, but suffer one trial more — ^that of having been born in a temperate climate. The sacrifices of the apostles of Athabasca have been blessed with success. In a short time all the Indians will be Catholics; very few become Protestants; 20 priests and 20 Brothers care for them. Brave Sisters have not been afraid, here as in the other vicariates, to imitate the zeal of the priests ; 40 are engaged in conducting 5 orphan schools. The courage of these jCatholic women makes a deep impression upon all observers. 4- As we approach the polar regions, we come to the vicariate of Mackenzie, detached from that of Athabasca in 1900, upon the solici- tations of Bishop Grouard. This division still allows Bishop Brey- nat, the new vicar, a large enough territory, one equal in extent to twice that of Texas. Missionaries travel over this immense tract with snowshoes or by boat, braving a rigorous climate to seek the sheep of the Good Shepherd. Twenty-two Oblate priests and 14 Brothers travel the length of rivers like the Mackenzie or the shores of lakes like Great Bear and Great Slave, true inland seas. Here the Indians assemble during the hunting and fishing seasons, in groups of 200, 300, and 700. Twelve mission posts are established along the route. About 5000 Indians have become Catholics; 400 or 600 have been won over to Protestantism. Here, too, 16 Sisters educate and provide for Esquimaux and other children. Yukon belongs to the vicariate of Mackenzie. It is a land where gold nuggets are found, and in the year 1898 many perished in their quest for riches. The obstacles of cold, lack of means of communi- cation, and hunger have been overcome in part only ; but has suffer- ing been alleviated and abundance found? The Fathers, who were sent there in the beginning, can tell us how many unfortunate crea- tures are still to be met with. At all events, they are there to console. 18 The Oblatbs of Mary Immaculate Mission ABY Bishops of the Conobeoation of the Oblates. Rt. Rev. Gabbiel Bbetnat Rt. Rev.

The soil is rich in wood and minerals. For some years the whites have been settling in the southern part close to Vancouver and the United States. The inhabitants number 200,000 and include Indians, whites, Chinese, and Japanese. There are 10,000 Catholics, half of them being Indians. 4- A discipline obtains among the Indians, worthy of the early ages of the church. The mmt redounds to the credit of Bt. Bev. Mon- signeur Durieu, the first bishop. With a knowledge of the character of these tribes and a wise and constant firmness of rule, he understood how to group his converts around a church, appointing chiefs and superintendents in the absence of the priests for the observance of rules which give villages the air of so many religious communities. The faithful receive a solid education despite the fact that mission- aries, because of their small numbers, are often forced to be away. Tiiere are only 35 to attend the 7 missions, and several of these are obliged to devote their time exclusively to the whites in the college, boarding schools, industrial schools, hospitals, etc. Bishop Durieu was succeeded by Bishop Dontenwill. 4- For a long time the Oblates have been in the United States, espe- cially in Texas, in the capacity of auxiliaries; also in Buffalo and Plattsburg, N. X- ; in Lowell, Mass., and in other large cities, where they have 8 pefmaneut residences with about 80 priests and 28 Brothers. III. Missions op Afbica. When the Oblates were called to South Africa and Bishop AUard landed at Durban, in Natal, in 1850, no Catholic priest had yet taken up his abode in those parts. The Protestants occupied the country without hAing conquered it, for even though the Boers and others attended their sermons, the natives troubled themselves very little about them. The missionaries encountered a large number of Euro- peans, whifeh increased as the rich lands were cleared, and an innu- merable multitude of Blacks, Kafirs, Zulus, Bechmanas, and Basutos, 20 The Oblates of Mary Immaculate Deceased Bishops of the Congregation of the Oblates.

Vicar Apostolic of Natal. The Oblates of Mary Iichaoulate 21 reputed incapable of any elevation of thought. The task seemed an ungrateful one, and it required the iron will of Bishop Allard and the devotion and holiness of assistants like Father Hidien to found and maintain any fixed institution. The immense vicariate, which at first extended from Cape Colony in the south to the desert of Kala- hari, Matabeleland, and Mozambique in the north and northwest, has given birth to several vicariates and prefectures. 4- The vicariate of Natal in the south comprises the English colony of that name and the land of the Kafirs and Zulus. Under the direc- tion of Bishop Allard and, for twenty nine-years, that of Bishop Jolivet, it has prospered beyond all promise and in spite of difiSculties. Where there were only 800 Catholics thirty years ago, there are at present 13,000. There are large numbers of natives, about 1,500,000, but how many obstacles are in the way! There are 8000 Protestants among the whites who require attention; moreover, resources are entirely too scant among a people who have nothing themselves to give. Nevertheless, in the course of six years, the number of priests has risen from 18 to nearly 80, 40 of whom are Trappists; that of churches and chapels from 30 to 45; that of schools and hospitals from 36 to 61. Six congregations of Sisters, among them the Sisters of the Holy Family of Bordeaux, the Dominicans, and the Sisters of Nazareth, are giving their valuable aid to the conversion of these lands, as well as others that we shall mention. 4- The vicariate of Orange Free State, northwest of Natal, is just re- covering from the South African War. Its institutions have suffered greatly. In 1886, it was detached from Natal and given in charge of Bishop Gaughren, whose brother succeeded him three years ago. For a long time the work of evangelization has been going on in behalf of the Blacks, 450,000 in number, as well as in behalf of the wliites, who are attracted by brilliant business prospects and pay very little attention to their immortal souls. There are very many Protes- tants here, as also in the Free State, against 4000 Catholics. Having followed the armies during the war, the missionaries, 15 in number, have returned to resume their interrupted works. There are 7 flour- ishing stations with 15 schools and colleges and 12 churches and chap- els. Conversions number about 90 a year. The Oblates of Mary IififAouLATE ■>5-W;.\" -^-, -»'-.

The former prefec- ture has become a vicariate apostolic under the direction of Bishop Miller. The Fathers, dispersed by the course of eventSy and called to the field, have returned to their poets. There are from 15 to 20 of them laboring for the welfare of the whites, who number over 300,000 Protestants, and for the Blacks, with 600,000 pagans. Conditions for the ministry are very favorable. New missions have been recently founded and every year 1^60 conversions are re- corded. ♦ The prefecture of Bcuutoland, created in 1893, lies between Orange Free State and Natal. Whites are forbidden to settle in this state. The 400,000 negroes would readily enter the fold of Jesus Christ, for paganism is falling into discredit among them, if we could build a new church for them every year. Alas ! we can not even enlarge the old chapels, which are rapidly getting much too small. The personnel is composed of 18 Fathers, assisted by 50 Brothers and Sisters. There are from 9000 to 10,000 Catholics. In Lower Cimhehasia, the early struggles are not over. Since 1896, the year of the foundation of this prefecture, 5 missions with 10 chapels and as many schools have been organized; 15 priests, assistea by 12 Brothers, direct a little band of 500 to 600 Catholics. The Blacks, the tribes of Crambos, Hereroe, Damaras, etc., were beginning to yield to Christian influence when the still unsubdued revolt against German authority retarded all missionary work. A young priest. Father Jaeger, was recently massacred by the insurgents. IV. Missions op Ceylon. The Oblates of Mary Immaculate possess important and flourishing missions in Ceylon, the enchanted isle of perpetual spring, the pearl of the Indies. They were called there in 1845 to revive the Catholic faith, which had first been introduced in the fifteenth century by the Portuguese, and was strengthened by the companions of St. Francis Xavier. Later, it was proscribed by the Dutch Protestants and the last remaining spark was threatened with extinction by Protestant schools. Schools were the institution required, and the sons of Bishop de Mazenod hastened to the assistance of Bishop Bettachini of the Oratory, coad- jutor of Colombo, and in charge of the northern part of the island. 4* 24 The Oblates of Mary Ikhaoiilate Their united efforts developed institutioiis and these, requiring more laborers, the Oblates soon came in suflBcient numbers to constitute a vicariate in 1867. Jaffna was organized by Bishop Semeria, 0. M. I. Different misunderstandings and I know not what spirit of complaint provoked a schism. The bishop displayed the greatest kindness and tact trying to restore good feeling, but all traces of the disagreement have not yet been obliterated. Bishop Bonjean, his successor, was a prelate of exceptional theologi- cal knowledge and administrative ability, and gave strong impetus to works which insure permanent results. Since his time, under Bishop Melizan, and the present bishop, Rt. Eev. Monsignor Joulain, the movement of conversion has been strengthened. The number of Catholics has risen to 46,000. There are only about 5000 Protestants, and the number of pagans has been reduced from 400,000 to 370,000. The people of Ceylon love beautiful churches and make every possible sacrifice to help the missionary build them. In Jaffna there are 222 and about 160 schools. Native Brothers and Sisters have, for some time, been united in congregations ; a college and a seminary have been opened many years. Two newspapers, one in English, the other in tamul, are great aids in apostoUc work. ♦ From Jaffna, the Oblates went to Colombo. Several labored under a strange bishop, but were permanently installed in 1883 under Bishop Bonjean, 0. M. I. The vicar apostolic, Rt. Rev. Pagnani, a Sylves- tran, seeing that his helpers were too few in numbers, returned with his companions to Kandia, asking for a division of the vicariate of Colombo. Bishop Bonjean worked wonders in Jaffna; even non- Catholics were forced to admire his works. In 1887, he found only 170 schools with 12,609 pupils. As a present result of his efforts and of those of Bishop Melizan, lately deceased, who continued his work in Jaffna and Colombo, Colombo occupies a place first in rank with 360 schools with an attendance of 32,000, 8 orphanages harboring 360 chil- dren, and 2 large colleges with 700 to 900 students. As in Jaffna, native Brothers and Sisters are among the teachers. The number of Brothers has risen from 11 to about 85, including 10 natives. They have two printing presses with two sets of type, and are thus able to publish a paper in English and in Cingalese. The language of Jaffna is not the same, but the people are very similar in character. The following show the grand results of their strong organization. Against 1,060,000 Buddhists and 21,000 Prot- The Oblates op Mary Immaculate 25 estants, there are 208,000 Catholics; conversions average, and some- times exceed, 1600 a year. There are 290 Chapels. V. Mission of Australia. In closing this short review we must not forget to mention the be- ginnings of a mission in southwestern Australia. The Oblates already have two houses and 10 religious in the diocese of Perth. Such is a sketch of the beautiful portion of the vineyard confided by our Lord to the Oblates of Mary Immaculate. Their congregation numbers 1600 Fathers and Brothers in the west and east; these will soon be reinforced by 450 aspirants. Their great obstacle is poverty. If one can be consoled when not doing all the good possible, they are comforted by the comparison of their works performed in penury with those of sects that have ample resources. MISSIONS IN ASIA MASSACRE OF MISSIONARIES IN THIBET In our last issue we announced the martyrdom of Father Souli6 In Thibet Alas! new victims have been immolated at the instigation of the lamas. On July 18, the soldiers of Yun-nan, to the number of 800, allowed the city of Atentse to be besieged by the lamas. Being masters of the situation, these advanced upon Tse-kau, where they knew two missionaries, Fathers Dubernard and Bourdonnec, lived. Advised of the approach of their persecutors, the priests left their residence on the morning of the 20th. Father Bourdonnec, accompanied by a few Christians, fled to the south by paths hardly traversable. On the 22d, he was overtaken by a band in pursuit. Stripped of his garments, he was tied to a tree to serve as a target for his mad persecutors. Turning his eyes to Heaven, the martyr commended his soul to God and prayed for his executioners. A blow from a sword severed his head from his body. Three Christians were captured with him. Two were killed; the third made his escape. Father Dubernard, old and feeble, could not undertake a long flight; he hid himself in the forests, and was discovered July 26. His execu- tioners summoned him to invoke Buddha. *' Behold forty years that I have been preaching the religion of the Lord of Heaven, and I shall be happy to die for Him,'' answered the aged apostle. He was put to death at once. 26 PONDIOHERBT 27 DIOCESE OF PONDICHERRY Death of a Christian Child at St. Joseph's College in Cuddalore Letter of Fatheb Loubiere^ P. F. M. To the Members of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith: I know that you love our dear Indian children whom we teach to pray for their benefactors. I hope to please you by giving the history of \"'III '- . Pupils of St. Joseph s Coixeok in C udd aloee. \"Little Xavier/' who entered our boarding school when very young and left us to enter Heaven at the age of fourteen. Xavier and Mariadas, his elder brother, had profited by a holiday to make a pilgrimage to Notre Dame de Vailankanni, in company with their father. They returned to the college the evening of September 12, jubilant 28 Missions IN Asia in the thought that they had offered their prayers in this sanctuary. As I was their spiritual director, they confided the secret of their pil- gi'image to me. Mariadas, our most brilliant Christian pupil, had asked the Blessed Virgin that he might pass his university examination. Xavier prayed for a vocation to the priesthood, and both implored that their mother, who had died some time before, might be admitted into Heaven. Their father, who confided them to my especial care, bade them good-bye and left for Madras. The two brothers repaired to the study hall. In a few moments, however, Xavier begged his brother to take him to the infirmary; he said he felt extremely tired, cold, and as though he were going to faint. The infirmarian, alarmed, called in the native physician. It was eight o'clock in the evening and we were about to take our evening meal when the Brother hurriedly went up to the president and spoke to him in a low tone. Two words that we heard were sufficient to interrupt our conversa- tion ; they were \" Xavier *' and ^^ idou.\" **Idou\" signifies cholera, the terrible malady that frightens the bravest natives to such an extent that they do not even dare to pro- nounce the word. So we learned that Xavier had brought the germs of the scourge back with him from his pilgrimage. This unexpected news justly alarmed us. Would not the horrible evil, visiting us for the first time, spread and claim its many victims from among our children ? The Father superior turned to me : \" You are the spiritual director of Xavier,\" he said, \" and the child is in danger of death/' Whilst he was giving his orders to the infirmarian, I went out, deeply impressed. Was it possible that my \" little Xavier \" was dying in the infirmary; he whom I had just left a few hours before full of health and life? I found him stretched out on his mat, his eyes very bright and restless. On seeing me, Mariadas said: \" My little brother is very sick ; he has vomited several times and is suffering very much.\" However, he had no suspicion of the sad truth. PONDIOHERBY 29 I answered: \"The English doctor is going to come; while we are waiting for him, you may go out, and I will stay with your brother.\" \" Father/^ Xavier whispered in a voice so feeble that I could hardly understand him, \" I want to go to confession.\" \"That is well, my child; then you can receive Jesus to-morrow morning.\" DOBMITOBY OF THE COLLEGE OF CUDDAIX)RE. Bending over to understand him better, I heard his confession, which I felt would be his last. When he had finished, I said to him : \" My dear child, ask God's pardon again for all the sins of your past life.\" He did so with deep contrition, but I noticed that his eyes suddenly filled with tears, as though my words had revealed to him lus approaching death. In the meantime, the English doctor arrived. He examined Xavier and shook his head. Then, after having written a prescription, he went out with a preoccupied air. I followed him. 30 Missions in Asia '^WeU, Doctor ?^^ I said. \" There is no hope.\" He added : \" However, to relieve the patient, rub his arms and legs.\" He bade me good-bye with the words : \" When the cramps return, it is a sign of the end/' I returned and knelt down by Xavier.'s bedside. Mariadas was . weeping ; he seemed to understand that Grod required of him the sac- rifice of his brother. Rt. Rev. Mgb. Zalbski. Apostolic delegate to the East Indies. 1 tried to console him. \" My child,\" I said, \" you must be strong and give a good example to little Xavier.\" \" Father, I am strong, but T can not keep back my tears. May the will of God be done ! \" Xavier smiled in spite of his sufferings and murmured : \" Courage, my brother, let us pray together.\" I gave Xavier a few drops of medicine and began to lub his legs and arms, already cold. Poor Mariadas helped me as well as he could. About the end of an hour neither one of us could do any more ; but it seemed that heat was returning. -' Come, let us rub him some more,\" said I ; \"we shall save your PONDIOHBBBY 31 brother from death yet If we can succeed in getting him warm again, he will be cured/' I really had begun to hope in his recovery. \"Thank you, brother; thank you, Father,\" Xavier whispered from time to time, turning his large eyes affectionately toward us. Continuing to rub his stiffening hands and feet as vigorously as I could, I suggested pious aspirations which he repeated with great fervor. It was now near midnight. Suddenly Xavier gave a cry of pain; the anticipated cramps distorted his poor exhausted frame. \" My child,'* I said, \" be calm ; do not cry out like that; Jesus will not be pleased.'' With an effort he suppressed his feeling, trying to obey me ; but he replied : Oh I Father, I am suffering so much. \" Offer your suffering to the Blessed Mother in behalf of your be- loved mother.\" \" Yes, Father, that I will gladly do.\" I then noticed that, in spite of my rubbing, his limbs were growing cold and I felt that it was high time to administer Extreme Unction. \"Little Xavier,\" I said, kindly, \"prepare yourself; I am going to give you the last sacraments.\" \"Father, I am ready,\" he answered. Assisted by Mariadas, I hastened to apply the sacred oils; my eyes filled with tears, as the dear child, notwithstanding the intense pain caused by the cramps, prayed witl) angelic piety. When 1 had finished, Xavier turned to Mariadas, who was bathed in tears, an3 said to him affectionately : \" Brother, take courage ; I shall pray for you and for our father.\" Having received the plenary indulgence in articulo mortis, he added : \" Father, T am satisfied,\" and ('losed his eyes in deep recollection. Meanwhile his breathing became slower and more difficult. The last moment was approaching. I bent over the face of the dying child and uttered a few aspirations; his lips moved to repeat them. Two o'elock struck. Xavier could not longer suppress his violent pain and suddenly cried out in a surprisingly strong voice which like- wiae manifested an intense desire: \"I want to go! Iwanttogol\" 32 Missions in Asia \" Where do you want to go, my dear child ?\" I asked, trembling with emotion. \" To Heaven, Father/' \" Five minutes longer, my child, and you will be there/^ '^ How good you are. Father,*' he exclaimed, with the look of death in his eyes; \"I am going to see my mother again, brother; we will meet in Heaven ! \" College of Cuddalobe. With these words he closed his eyes, never to open them again on this earth. His soul had taken its flight to Heaven. I recited the De Profundis in a loud voice. Mariadas said the prayer with me; his courage was truly edifjdng. Both of us then dressed little Xavier in his beautiful first communion clothes. Having placed the body on a rattan bed covered with a white cloth, I went to inform the superior of what had occurred. He immediately dispatched the sad news to the child's father. PONDICIIEKRY 33 In the interests of the other children it was decided not to leave the remains in the college until morning. Two of the younger priests carried the precious burden in tlieir arms to a place near the parish ciiurch which served as the death chamber. The recollection of this silent funeral procession still makes a deep impression on me. Afraid to rely upon the servants, the other priests themselves dis- infected the infirmary tainted by cholera. In the morning when the children were assembled in the chapel for prayer, I told them, in the most cautious terms, how Xavier had been called from among them during the night. Thanks be to God ! far from being affrighted at the unexpected news, they at once invoked the intercession of their little brother in Heaven. 4. Xavier^s father came from I^Iadras as soon as possible, but arrived too late to look upon the features of his beloved child that lie had left so well and happy the evening before. However, he gave an example of perfect Christian resignation and proved himself in every way the worthy father of so pious a son. Now, when in their walks our children pass the cemetery in which little Xavier is buried, they observe silence and each one, on making the sign of the cross, begs God for the grace of dying a good death. NEWS OF THE MISSIONS ASIA A Touching Scene in India Father (riraud, P. F. M., writes from Madurantakara, August 28, 11)05 : A few weeks ago, when distributing the alms sent to me by the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, 1 said to my neophytes : ** ^fy children, all these sacks of rice have been given to you by your benefactors in Europe and America. Do not forget them in your prayers.'' ** Oh ! Father, we shall never forget them. Are they not our pro- tectors and the support of our wives and children ? \" ** That is the jight disposition to have. Now, tell me what I shall say to them in your name ? \" */ Father, what are you saying? We, poor pariahs, we who are looked upon as dogs by the rich in this country, how can we dare to speak to the great doreys (gentlemen) of Europe' and America?'* '* Do not be afraid. They are your annenmars {elder brothers) and love you as you love your tamhymars (younger brothers). You can tell them all your miseries.\" *' If such is the case, tell them that we throw ourselves in the dust at their feet and make this humble prayer: \"' (ilory be to (lod Who has not abandoned us in our misfortune ! We have received your alms. They have been to us as the miljc of the goats on the mountains. They have saved our lives. We thank you. The memory of your benefactions will remain engraven on our hearts and on those of our children. We shall not cease to pray to God for you.\" The other day my famishing children came to me again. \" Father,\" they said, \" our benefactors have done much to prevent us from starving; but alas! the famine is growing and will not end 34 Africa 35 till the eleventh month of the year (February). The little grain that we have received is already exhausted and we are beginning to suffer again. Our wives have not lighted fires for several days and our chil- dren, as thin as skeletons, are crying like the jackal in the forest. \"Intercede for us with our benefactors. They have large hearts and generous faith; they will take pity on us. Assure them of our gratitude. Tell them that we shall pray for them morning and night and that the Most High will sustain them with His all-powerful hand. Their families shall multiply like the banyan roots.\" AFRICA Trait of Heroism The following touching trait of heroism is an extract from the letter of Bishop Augouard : Having learned that a poor old woman was suflEering from the sleep- ing sickness in a village not far from Brazzaville, \"good Mother Marie '* left without saying a word to try, at least, to save the soul of the poor negress. Accompanied by a child to act as interpreter, she arrived in Vala- Vala. The people pressed around her and Mother Marie asked to be taken to the poor sick woman. \" There is no one sick in this place,\" they answered. \" What ! is there not an old woman here suffering from the sleeping sickness ? \" \" No; there was one, but she has gone to another village far away.\" \" Well, you must show me the way there.\" The chief gave the sister a guide, who showed her the village but would not enter it. The sun was about to rise, as the sister set out on her way by the winding paths that led to the village, consisting of four or five huts. A turn in the road brought her. to one of the marshes frequent in Africa. It was about one hundred yards broad, a thick black mud of unknown depth. To take off her shoes and stockings was but the work of an instant : she put one foot in the mire and discovered it to be very black. The other followed and the sensation was by no means pleasant. She saw her habit in a deplorable state ; nevertheless, she pressed forward and crossing the swamp, she ran to the village without stopping either to wash her feet or to put on her shoes and stockings again. 36 News of the Missions The natives were very surprised to see a white woman with black feet and were more astonished still when she inquired for the sick woman among them. They took her to the door of a hut in which the poor, afflicted creature lay on a mat. Mother Marie entered and was welcomed by her patient with a smile. The preparation was not long ; the mother recalled the necessary truths to her mind, asked her if she believed in (Jod and whether she desired baptism which would make her happy. The good, old woman con- sented to everything and the Sister experienced the joy of pouring on her aged brow the waters that regenerate souls. The following con- versation ensued : \" Well, mother ; you are happy, you are going to Heaven.\" \" Yes, I am happy ; but, tell me, when shall I die ? \" \" You are not going to die now ; God can cure you ; He sometimes does restore health after the reception of the sacraments.\" \" No, no ; I do not want to live ; see how wretched I am, abandoned by all; everybody avoids me. You tell me that now I am baptized I shall go to Heaven ; I want to go there as soon as possible.\" \" Would you not like me to take 3'ou to our hospital where we shall take good care of you.\" After a mementos hesitation, she replied : \" No, leave me where I am and simply tell God that I want to die and see Him.\" Mother Marie left her neophyte with a few words of comfort and set out for home. She found her shoes on the other side of the marsh and returned alone by the paths through the brush. DESTINATION OF MISSIONARIES Reported since the December Annals. NORTH AMERICA United States Re?.

Fr. Henry, Cardinal Vaughan's successor as Superior General of the Mill Hill Missionaries, London. Father Henry had J)een urgently requested by the Most Rev. Abp. Agius, the Apostolic Delegate in the Philippines, to send somfe of his missionaries there, because, according to the quoted words of the Archbishop, \" hundreds of parishes are vacant and entire provinces are at the mercy of Schismatics and Protestants.\" The request has been granted and eight priests of the St. Joseph's Society designated for that mission. They are ready to start but there is no money to pay their passage from England to the Philippines. Fr. Henry, remembering that the United States owes a heavy spiritual debt to the Philippines, asked our Society to make an appeal to the charity of American Catholics for this most worthy object, stating \" that if they cannot find priests to send there, they might furnish the material means for others to do so.\" The Propagation of the Faith has always taken the deepest inter- est in American Missions; this year it has helped the Jesuit Fathers laboring in the Philippines and it readily endorsed Fr. Henry's appeal. 38 SUPPLBKBNT TO THE AMBKIOAN EDITION OP THE ANNALS 39 It was sent to all the members of the American Hierarchy and to thou- sands of the clergy and laity throughout the land ; Catholic papers were requested to publish it. We are glad to state that many gratifying answers have been re- ceived already. The first one came from the Bight Bev. Bishop of Brooklyn, who forwarded a handsome donation in his and the name of the senior Pastors of his diocese. The Sacred Heart Review which has rendered so invaluable services to our Society and the cause it advo- cates opened at once its columns for subscriptions, the list being headed by the Most Eeverend Archbishop of Boston. Several other Archbishops and Bishops have also sent in their help to the movement and their hearty approval of it, as well as a number of priests and people. The good missionaries who are willing to go and sacrifice their lives in the Philippines will, therefore, soon be enabled to reach their field of labor. But American Catholics ought not to be satisfied with the sending of these few priests; they should see to it that their ministry be not impaired by lack of means. The Apostolic Delegate tells us that '^ ... at the present moment the Bishops there cannot afford to give any money, as they have to struggle themselves to keep things going . . . '* Here is a wide field for charity and a most deserving one since it contains ^' thousands of souls deprived of spiritual help, imploring for priests and dying without the sacraments.'^ (Abp. Agius's Letter.) Let those who enjoy these blessings in abundance show their gratitude by coining to the assistance of their spiritually destitute brothers! Let us help in the payment of the debt we owe as a nation to the Phil- ippine Church I NEED OF PRIESTS IN THE PHILIPPINES Bt the Bev. John B. MoGinley, D. D. Father McQlnley has worked for several years in the Philippines as Rector of the Diocesan Seminary of Nueva Segovia. Owing to various circumstances he was obliged a few months ago to return to his own dio- cese of Philadelphia and has been kind enough to relate for the Associates of the Propagation of the Faith some of his experiences In our new pos- sessions. They more than confirm the words of the Most Reverend Aposto- lic Delegate in the Philippines: \" There is a very large field for labor out here. . .\" There is a crying need of priests in the Philippine Islands. The sup- ply from Spain has heen cut oflf since 1898, and many of the Spanish 40 Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals religious, who formerly manned the parishes, have left the country. Between 1898 and 1904, the seminaries for native priests remained closed or disorganized, and during that stormy period very few priests were ordained. Even now, with the seminaries reopened, the output of priests must be, for many years, hopelessly inadequate ; it takes ten years to equip a young man for the priesthood. What is the actual state of things ? Here are a few statistics which will furnish an answer better than any general statement of mine. These figures are taken from the reports made by the Bishops at the end of last year, as published in Wiltzius^ \" Catholic Directory.** The Diocese of Nueva Cdceres with a population of 700,000 has 107 priests. Jaro has 106 priests and 1,331,194 people. In Cebii there are 188 priests to attend to 2,145,679 souls. Manila seems better off; it has 424 priests and 1,891,826 Catholics; but most of these priests are en- gaged in educational and other non-parochial work. The totals for Nueva Segovia are not given by Wiltzius' Directory, but I know that last March, the priests of that diocese numbered 94; the population is about 1,000,000. According to the ecclesiastical census, the total Catholic population is considerably over seven millions. The Qovemment census, however, makes the total number of Christians to be about 6,500,000. Regard- ing the number of priests there can be no doubt they are only too easily counted; they number 919. Nine hundred and nineteen priests for six millions and a half souls I In other words, the priests do not aver- age one for 7000 persons. Who will say that we have too many priests in the United States ? And yet, the Diocese of Chicago has one priest for about 1700 Catholics; in New York there is one for every 1550; in Philadelphia one for every 944; and for the whole United States the ratio is one for about every 960. Is it then unreasonable to say that to man adequately the parishes of the Philippines, there should be at least seven times as many priests^ t. e., 6300 instead of 900 ? The consequence of this scarcity of priests is, that many parishes, where formerly there were two or three priests, are now without any. I know one old man who has charge of thirteen missions, each of which had formerly its resident clergy. Many flourishing missions among the hill tribes had to be abandoned, with the result that most of the neophytes are fast relapsing into paganism. I know a province in which there are thousands of Christians and several good churches but no priest. Even in the parishes that possess a resident priest theie is in most Supplement to the Amekican Edition of the Annals 41 instances a woful spiritual destitution. For how can one man attend to the spiritnal needs of 10,000 souk? But many parishes have 20,- 000, some 30,000. I know one with 40,000. How can a solitary priest hear the confessions or attend to the sick of such a multitude? Sick calls alone would exhaust the endurance of the most robust. I have often seen the dying carried on a bamboo stretcher to the priesf s chouse to be anointed. Lying thus like sheep without a shepherd, many of the poor unin- structed people ^re easily deceived by Aglipay's so-called priests, who come to them in the garb and with the name of Catholic padres; and who say ^' mass,'' hear confessions, and observe all the ceremonies of the Catholic church. As the course of studies of these schismatics is of only a few months', duration, Aglipay and his friends are not, as are^ the Catholic Bishops, hampered by any dearth of personnel. Protestant missionaires, too, are there with enormous resources. As it would never do to let the Filipinos know how they differ in doc- trine, the sects have agreed to portion out the country among them- selves, so that in no one place (except Manila), do two denominations operate. Moreover, some, if not all, work in harmony with the schis- matics ; and Protestant and Aglipayan ministers have been seen on the same platform ; — ^not because the Protestants admire Aglipayism, but because they know that if the Filipinos would only separate themselves from the Bock of Bome, they could be easily induced to discard piece- meal their Catholic doctrines. America is partly responsible for this deplorable state of things. Will the Catholics of America, if they cannot furnish priests for the Philippines, refuse to bear the traveling expenses of a few zealous mis- sionaries from another land, who have hearkened to the Macedonian cry of the Most Bev. Apostolic Delegate? CATHOLIC SCHOOLS IN THE PHILIPPINES Since the American occupation the Philippine public BChools which here- tofore had been conducted on Catholic principles, have been made to adopt American methods. In the words of a priest writing from Manila: \"The teachers (generally Americans) are not now allowed to speak of religion, either Protestant or Catholic, nor against any form of wor- ship; all books speaking for or against any religion are kept out of the schools. . . .\" This condition of afCalrs not being all that can be desired in many places, the clergy are endeavoring to open Catholic schools wherever pos- sible. 42 Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals The Sisters of St Paul of Chartres conduct a large number of schools and academies in Cochin-China, and about a year ago seven of them left Saigon for the Philippines at the request of Bishop Rooker to open schools in the diocese of Jaro. The following letter, addressed by the Superioress of that missionary band to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith sometime after her arrival, will emphasize the needs of the Church In our new possessions. Letteb of Sister Mary Angela Si Paulas Convent, Dumaguete, Eastern Negros. Last October seven of ns left Saigon for the Philippines, there to open our first house in Oceania. After a fatiguing journey of ten days we reached Dumaguete, the capital of Eastern Negros, where we « received an enthusiastic reception from the people. We were the first nuns to set foot on these shores, and in consequence the natives looked upon us as some extraordinary beings and crowded around us with undisguised veneration. I soon found that God had completely granted my desire; here is a mission that is a mission in the true sense of the word. Saigon is so civilized that I could almost believe myself back on my own native heath, but here I could have no such illusion. Besides the diflBculties that necessarily accompany a foundation, we found everything new here, language, customs, etc., . . . and then we are cut off from all communication with the outer world. In spite of all this we are per- fectly happy and our peace of heart will enable us with the grace of God to overcome everything. We have some Filipino priests, full of zeal and earnest piety, but we need, oh ! so many more. Fancy, our \" Padre Cura *' has 14,000 souls to look after, scattered over an immense territory. Lately I met another priest who has charge of nine parishes, within a radius of three hundred miles. Despite the zeal of these devoted men, how many live and die without the sacraments. One hears of China, but who thinks of the poor souls who are perishing in these islands I This is all the more unfortunate since they have such good natural dis- positions. We are going to open on January 8 our new school and a number of pupils have already been enrolled, and if we could receive free all those who say so sweetly, \" I want to be with the Madres,\" we would have more than three hundred to begin with, but accommodations are lack- ing. I must tell you a secret and it is that we are very poor and I fear that we will not be able to do all that our heart sets before us. SUPPLEKSNT TO THE AMERICAN EDITION OF THE AnNALS 43 If we cannot receive just now for instruction all those poor little ones, later on, when God sends us help they will come to us. Our first duty will be to form an English class, and I am going to be in charge of the boys. Oh ! how I pray that the dear Sacred Heart may choose . from among those little hearts, so innocent and so well disposed, some good priests. The Bishop of Cebu was telling ns recently that he needs at least five hundred for work in his diocese and our Bishop wants three hundred. ^ We are not looked after spiritually as we were at Saigon. Think of us being obliged to make our confession in Spanish when no one knew a word of it before coming here. The good Father speaks only Span- ish and Yisayan. With Ood^s help and the assistance of one of our nuns, a Portuguese, we are getting along well enough. We can already make ourselves understood and fairly understand the instructions our pastor gives us occasionally. We recommend ourselves and our poor mission to the prayers of the Associates of the Propagation of the Faith. STRANGE EXPERIENCES IN CHINA Bt THE Bev. E. Hopsomeb, S. J. The part of the vineyard that I am cultivating is indeed very ex- tensive, comprising at present about 1,400,000 pagans, with 1800 Chris- tians living in communities, scattered over this immense territory. You can readily imagine what a difficult task it would be for me to attend the dying, were I alone. Lately I have had as a helper in the work an excellent and zealous Chinese priest who was recently or- dained. Many are the hardships in the life of a missionary, but the hardest of all in my judgment that he has to endure is the traveling after the manner of the country, — ^by chair. Last year all my journey- ings were made in this way, sometimes in a little carriage drawn by an ox or an ass, and on occasions by a mule or a sturdy little pony, and if need be by the four of them harnessed together. It may appear incredible to you, but the labors of our Protestant brethren work to our advantage. Their principal settlement is about fifteen miles from us, where they have erected magnificent buildings. This they can do because they seem to have unlimited money, and their numerous catechists receive from five to six times the salary that we are able to pay ours. These men work upon the feelings of the natives and are certainly very clever in their way. Their acts, however, do 44 Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals not harmonize with their teachings, and the more serious minded are quick to see it. For instance, some of them come to us occasionally and say that \" Protestantism is a cheap brand of goods/' Up to the present, however, we have avoided all conflict with Protestants. The devil himself, who rules this country, is one of our best helpers. There are very few villages where he is not adored in two er three pagodas, which are very numerous here. In all pagan houses the place of honor is given to him and before his shrines incense is freely burned. The country is deeply pagan; the manners and customs of the people filled with its superstitions. The devil for four or five thousand years has ruled over 450 millions of Chinese, and out of that number we have 1 Chinese Tbavellino Cabt. but a million Catholics. Diabolical possessions are not infrequent, but fortunately they often turn to our advantage, and good comes out of evil. Last year I went to a certain village, the chief of which was a Chris- tian, who said to me : \" a young woman had the deviFs sickness, as they call it. She was dying when I was called to drive the evil one away. On my asking her if she wished to be baptized, she readily assented, and I briefly explained to her the principal doctrines of the faith, bap- tized her, and almost immediately she got better. Now I have come to you. Father, to ask you to supply the ceremonies.^' Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals 45 After this strange recital I proceeded with the ceremonies, and when I came to the prayers of exorcism, the devil whq had not completely given tip his influence over the sick girl suddenly began to torment her sister. She thereupon asked for baptism, and through the sacrament Heaven was certainly opened to her, for she died of the dreaded malady. I had a similar experience a short time afterwards. Not far away, about the same time, the devil took possession of a little girl 9 years old, the daughtfer of good pagans. Incense was burned to the devil both in the home and in the pagoda, but without any effect. Some of \\ Sanctuabt Bots of the College of Ki-Tcheou. our Christians told the parents of the child of the religion of the Master of heaven. They told how the Christians did not believe in the devil and how the child would certainly be cured if they and the little one would become Christians. They came to see me and I placed the child and the mother under the care of one of our women catechists for instruction. The child had some dreadful periods and our good Christian woman was almost frightened out of her wits. When I felt that they had received suflScient instruction I baptized them and the devil never afterwards tormented this new child of God. I would give 46 Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals a last fact which has to do with the father of my catechist. This man had become a Christian with his whole family, and as he was more than ordinarily intelligent the missionary had appointed him catechist. His duty was to teach the pagans of the village where about sixty fami- lies had asked to be received into the Church. It was soon noticed, however, that under one or other pretext he omitted his prayers. He was a proud man and no doubt retained some superstitious practice or another. Suddenly he lost the sight of one of his eyes^nd was threat- ened with the loss of the other. lb all happened so unexpectedly that many saw in it the intervention of the devil. The pagans had a bad influence on him and impressed on hini that he had been thns pnn- Rectoby of S. Tchang-Kia-Tchoano. ished because he had left the religion of his fathers. \" Come to the pagodas, they told him ; invoke the spirits as you used to do, oflEer them incense and undoubtedly you will be cured, otherwise you will be surely blinded permanently.\" After some hesitation he did so. Shortly afterwards his son re- turned home for vacation, and learning the facts, reproached his father for his apostasy and succeeded in bringing him back to the fold. It is a grave question if his conversion was sincere, at any rate God per- mitted him to be afflicted with violent stomach pains. Once more the SUPPLBHENT TO THE AmEEIOAN EDITION OF THE AnKALS 47 pagans came to him, putting forth the same arguments, urging him to go to the pagoda and be cured. Again he apostatized, bringing with him the sixty families whom he had been previously instructing. Since that time he has become a furious hater of the Christians, and has driven his son from home. While I have been writing you, my young college boys have been chanting their night prayers with great devotion. I have two colleges as you may know, the one at Ou-i, a village where two missionaries were murdered in 1900; the other at Ki-tcheou, an old imperial city. The former can accommodate 26, the latter 40 students, and both es- tablishments have done splendid work. In them are trained the cate- chists, without whom Christians and the catechumens would find it extranely diflScult to learn their religion at home. The ordinary charge for their maintenancee is about thirty cents, but those who are too poor to pay even this are admitted free. The little ones are really lovable, very pious, and most respectful to the missionary. Despite the moral evils and other curses of this poor China, some good is being accomplished. More than three hundred ytars ago the Fathers of Hie Society of Jesus had won the friendship of the Em- peror. If he had embraced the faith, Christians would be num- bered to-day by millions and China, with its resources and its teeming population, instead of following old Confucian superstitions, would be the first empire of the world. Unfortunately, I believe, this country will follow the example of Japan, seek after material pros- perity, and remain plunged in paganism. A VISIT TO ST. PAUL'S NATIVE CITY By THE Bev. Pb. Jerome, 0. M. Cap. For the past twenty years the traveller may reach Tarsus, the native place of the Apostle St. Paul, by rail and just as easily as he would an American town situated in the neighborhood of a large city. There are some differences, however, but these should not surprise us, — ^we are in the East. First of all there were no stops, at least for the train in which we were travelling. In a steady run of about three-quarters of an hour, we traversed the twenty-seven miles that separate Tarsus from Mer- sina. Another difference is the Turkish time, which is anything but regular. When the sun disappears behind the snow-clad peaks of the Taurus, the \" Muezzin \" ascends to the top of the Mosque and chants 48 Supplement to the American Edition of the Annals the invitation to prayer — ^it is noon. For the next twenty-f onr hours, this will be the time of the railroad. While we are speaking of differ- ences, let ns mention a third one. It is extremely difficult to hide one's identity in Turkey. As soon as the traveller has taken his seat in the car, a policeman presents himself to ask his name, which he enters in a book. This formality it must be said is always executed with scrupu- lous politeness. If the traveller is somewhat surprised at the beginning it is not long before he takes it all as a matter of course. The signal for our departure had been given and we were soon enter- ing a rich and immense plain. As far as the eye can see, from the shores of the Mediterranean on the right to the feet of the Taurus on the left nothing could be seen but large fields of cotton, whose green color blended itself with the blue of the sea and sky. Here and there upon this great green sea, small white islands appeared to be floating; they were the farms of the \" fellahs.'* One of tiiese buildings, by its peculiar architecture attracted our attention. It was a Cretian settle- ment. After the events which tiroubled the island of Candia a few years ago, a number of the inhabitants of the island were compelled to take the road of exile. The inhabitants of the village before us were among the number. The road is of a blinding white. Travellers, whether on foot or in carriage, venture upon it only when compelled to do so. The camels, on the other hand, seem to be at ease and feel perfectly at home. Even their young and dangerous rival, the steam engine, has failed to awaken their jealousy or disturb their complacency. In the meantime, the long green line had become more distinct, the cultivated fields had been left far behind, and everywhere around us were beautiful little gardens, indications that we were nearing some city. It was Tarsus, which is surrounded by several square miles of gardens thickly planted with fruit trees. The view was a gay and pleasant one, but, as is the case with all Turkish cities, it is a beau- tiful veil cast over an organism more or less decadent, more or less ruined. The railroad station is about one-quarter of a mile distant from the city, into which we were led through a broad avenue lined with trees. The summer season is a hard one in Tarsus, the heat is extreme and continuous, which makes it so much the more unbearable. The vaca- tion period begins at the end of May, and then all those who have a country house hasten to it for several months. In the language of the country, this is called \" going to the vineyards,*' just as we go to the SUPPLBKBNT TO THE AhBSIOAN EDITION OF THE AnNALS 49 seashore or the mountains. Those that cannot afford that luxury do the best they can to stand the heat. They sleep, or at least try to do 80, on the roofs of their houses and spend most of the days inside; we, having no country house and only a most modest one in the city, have to wait, like many others, for a fresh breeze from the sea, and once in a while our expectations are fulfilled. Thanks be to Gk)d, the torrid season never lasts over two or three months. Naturally, the first inquiry of the traveller upon his arrival at Tar- sus is for souvenirs, if there are any in existence, of St. Paul. Truth compels me to say that there is none. It would be difficult to take seriously the so-called tree and cistern of St. Paul. The first of these is an old dead tree of large dimensions, which is to be found in the church-yard of the schismatic Armenians. It is very likely that the great age of the tree is the only reason for its being said that it was there in the days of the Apostle. Certainly one would like to have proofs more tangible and less interested than that which is offered. The dstem of St. Paul is located in the center of the present city in a house belonging to a schismatic Greek. The tradition that con- nects it with the name of St. Paul is of a comparatively recent date. It is said that one of the stones of the cistern had engraved upon it the name of Paul. Where is this stone? asks the inquisitive visitor. It has disappeared. How? An Englishman has carried it away! And there you are. If nothing else remains to commemorate the pas- sage of Paul at Tarsus, what is there left of his apostolate, of that gospel of Jesus Christ, which he carried to all nations? Tarsus numbers twenty thousand inhabitants. Three-quarters of these are Turks or \" fellahs.\" The rest are, in great majority, schis- matics, Greeks, and Armenians. There are but 400 Catholics in the entire city. It is only a little seed, to be sure, but a seed with enough vitality to be able to bring forth a big tree. During the first centuries of the Christian era Tarsus was among the more flourishing Christian settlements. But under evil influences it gradually fell away until it is the little unimportant Christian settlement of to-day. Fifiy years ago the Capuchin Fathers established a mission at Tar- sus; they were the flrst Catholic priests to re-appear in the native city of St Paul in many centuries. They built a small chapel, whose ruins are still in existence. The Maronites, the Armenians, and the United Greeks followed with priests of their own rites. This was the work we were called upon to continue, or to be more exact, to b^in again in 1900. For that mission, begun at the cost of great sacrifices, had to 60 SUPPLBMBNT TO THE AMERICAN EDITION OF THE ANNALS be abandoned a few years after its foundation. Marsina, a few miles distant from Tarsns, developed and progressed rapidly and the Fathers were compelled to proceed there in order to supply the needs of the increasing number of the Catholics of that city. Finally^ five years ago, a priest established himself at Tarsus, and, at the same time, the Sisters of the Holy Family, helped by the So- ciety for the Propagation of the Faith, founded a school in connection with the mission. The beginnings were modest and sometimes discour- aging. Complete success has not yet been achieved, at least, the Sif- ters are in a fair way towards it. Their classes are attended by 120 children. The seed is bringing forth good fruit. But at what cost is due this Catholic Eenaissance at Tarsus ? Only God knows. And yet we must go forward. We must have a school for the boys and another for the girls. Tarsus is the boulevard of Protestantism in the Orient. The sects, generously supported by their brothers of England and the United States, have several beautiful churches, hos^ pitals, dispensaries, magnificent buildings, large grounds, a complete education system from which flows the pernicious poison of Protestant doctrines and continuous and insulting sarcasms towards the Catholic Church — ^this is the Protestant fortress. And it is in presence of this colossus that the poor Catholic missionary must take his stand. It is true that this was also the experience of St. Paul during his cam- paign for the conquest of souls. But the grace of God was with him and the alms of the faithful were forthcoming to supply all his needs. Let us hope that the former is also with us and that the latter will not fail us.
