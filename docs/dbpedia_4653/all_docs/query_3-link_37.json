        "text": "In The Legend of Ruby Sunday, Doctor Who fans were finally given some answers to key mysteries that have been teased throughout the season - most crucially the matter of what's happening to Ruby and who her birth mother is.\n\nWhile it still isn't clear who Ruby's birth mother is, the episode did reveal that the much-teased One Who Waits was the pantheon's supreme commander, Sutekh – one of a race of Osirans, beings of God-like power who are worshipped by many cultures across the universe, including on Earth in ancient Egypt.\n\nBut that isn't the only storyline that fans are hoping for answers to: there's also the matter of the enigmatic Mrs Flood - who appeared to know more than she was letting on in the latest episode.\n\nMore like this\n\nIn The Legend of Ruby Sunday, Mrs. Flood made another appearance, summoned by Carla Sunday (Michelle Greenidge) to look after her mother Cherry (Angela Wynter) so that Carla can accompany Ruby (Millie Gibson) to UNIT HQ.\n\nBut Mrs. Flood was far from a perfect caregiver – and rather than make Cherry a cup of tea, she delivered an ominous warning. \"I'd be very careful, Mrs Sunday – there's a storm coming in… He waits no more.\"\n\nOf course, if you're needing to catch-up in time for the end of the run, all of those previous episodes are available to stream on BBC iPlayer.\n\nFor now, read on for everything you need to know about when the new episode of Doctor Who is released and the full release schedule.\n\nWhen is Doctor Who season 14 episode 8, Empire of Death, out?\n\nDoctor Who season 14 episode 8, Empire of Death, will be released on Saturday 22nd June at midnight on BBC iPlayer and at 6:40pm on BBC One.\n\nAll new Doctor Who episodes will drop on BBC iPlayer first – so if you're waiting to watch on BBC One, beware of spoilers!\n\nEmpire of Death is written by showrunner Russell T Davies and is directed by Jamie Donoughue.\n\nIt's the second instalment in what has been billed as an epic – and very emotional – two-part finale for season 14, and the synopsis for the story says: \"The Doctor has lost, his ageless enemy reigns supreme, and a shadow is falling over creation.\n\n\"Nothing can stop the devastation... except, perhaps, one woman.\"\n\nDoctor Who episode 14 release schedule: When are new episodes out?\n\nWith the first two episodes now available, you can find a full schedule for when the remaining instalments will arrive – complete with the episode titles – below:\n\nEpisode 1 – Space Babies – Saturday 11th May 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 2 – The Devil's Chord – Saturday 11th May 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 3 – Boom – Saturday 18th May 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 4 – 73 Yards – Saturday 25th May 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 5 – Dot and Bubble – Saturday 1st June 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 6 – Rogue – Saturday 8th June 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 7 – The Legend of Ruby Sunday – Saturday 15th June 2024 (out now)\n\nEpisode 8 – Empire of Death – Saturday 22nd June 2024\n\nWhat time are Doctor Who season 14 episodes out on BBC iPlayer?\n\nAs mentioned above, for the first time episodes from Doctor Who season 14 will be releasing at the same time around the world, on BBC iPlayer in the UK and on Disney Plus elsewhere.\n\nAs part of this, the episodes will also be arriving on iPlayer before they air on BBC One– the release schedule depending on your territory around the world is as follows:\n\n12am, Saturday 15th June BST (British Summer Time) – BBC iPlayer\n\n4pm, Friday 14th June PT (Pacific Time) – Disney Plus\n\n7pm, Friday 14th June ET (Eastern Time) – Disney Plus\n\nWhat has been said about the changed Doctor Who schedule?\n\nIn previous years, Doctor Who has always aired on BBC One first, usually at a time between 5pm and 9pm, on a Saturday or a Sunday.\n\nWhen the change in schedule was announced earlier this year, with a switch to the BBC iPlayer-first model at midnight, some fans criticised the move, arguing that they wouldn't be able to stay up so late to watch the episodes, and worried about getting them spoiled on social media before seeing them.\n\nThere was also criticism that the change would mean the show lost its ability to generate instant social media discussion, with fans watching the show together at the same time and discussing it online as it went out.\n\nWhen the news was announced, former showrunner and returning guest writer Steven Moffat commented on a post by showrunner Russell T Davies saying: \"Wait, WHAT??? Two brand new Doctor Who stories ON THE SAME DAY?? This is a whole new level of INSANE GREATNESS!!\".\n\nHe then went on to jokingly acknowledging the fan response, saying: \"Speaking as a fan, I can’t wait to complain about it!!!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Davies wrote in an issue of Doctor Who Magazine that the new release schedule gave fans more choice, saying: \"You’re not having to change your habits to fit the show, the show is changing to fit you. And it’s changing to adopt the patterns of all modern TV shows. Yes, I think all of them, very soon. This is the future, and it’s here, right now.\"\n\nHe added that fans should manage their online activity on a Saturday to avoid being spoiled, while caveating: \"I’m not making light of this. I can hear the worries. It’s easy to say 'stay offline' when your health or job or nature might make that impossible. And I’m sorry, because then, yes, spoilers will fly.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there’s always been a subset of viewers hitting the spoiler problem, like the tons of people who work Saturdays and on night shifts. They’ve had to negotiate this for years. So there has never been a transmission pattern in the digital age that’s perfect for everyone.\n\n\"And to be honest. If you’re that online, and cannot change… folks, you stand a high chance of getting spoiled anyway. Before transmission. That’s the modern world. Beyond my control.\"\n\nHow many episodes are in Doctor Who season 14?\n\nThere will be eight episodes in total in Doctor Who season 14, with the titles, writers and directors already having been announced for each.\n\nYou can find a full list here:\n\nSpace Babies - Writer: Russell T Davies.
