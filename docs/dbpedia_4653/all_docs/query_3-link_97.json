        "text": "Doctor Who celebrated its 60th anniversary on Thursday, November 23 and returned to our screens with a trilogy of specials, which started on Saturday, November 25. All of those episodes are available in the U.K. and around the world now, including the U.S..\n\nBelow we have all the information on how to watch the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials from anywhere and potentially for FREE with a VPN.\n\nThe Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials proved to be absolutely packed with action and fan-pleasing moments. For one thing, David Tennant returned as the Doctor. Joining him in The TARDIS was his sidekick from a decade ago, Donna Noble, portrayed once again by Catherine Tate.\n\nThe last time we were with the Doctor we saw Jodie Whittaker regenerate, very unexpectedly, into Tennant. Although the coat and Converse are back, he is technically not back as his previous incarnation, the 10th Doctor. Instead, this will be a brief stint as the 14th, before the previously announced Ncuti Gatwa takes his place as the 15th.\n\nIf all that wasn’t enough for fans, we saw the late Bernard Cribbins as Wilfred Mott, Neil Patrick Harris joined the cast as baddie The Toymaker and Beep the Meep jumped from the comic books to the screen. We won't spoil anything, but there were some other familiar faces and surprise guests too.\n\nRussell T Davies has written all three of the Doctor Who 60th Anniversary Specials and longstanding director Rachel Talalay led the first. These specials are unmissable for longtime watchers and newcomers alike.
