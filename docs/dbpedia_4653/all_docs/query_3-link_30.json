        "text": "Ncuti Gatwa's first season of Doctor Who is already at an end. The confusingly titled Doctor Who season 1 (or series 14, if you're going by post-reboot numbering) saw the Doctor travel across time and space with new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson).\n\nTheir adventures included a musical trip to Abbey Road, a Bridgerton-style detour to 19th-Century England, and an unforgettable folk horror tale in '73 Yards.' Among all that, Sutekh even came to town, while we also got an answer to the identity of Ruby Sunday's mother.\n\nBelow, you'll find the Doctor Who season 1 episode count for those who have been watching along on the BBC in the UK and Disney Plus in the UK.\n\nFor more, be sure to dive into our Doctor Who episodes 1 and 2 review, and Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson revealing their all-time favorite villains in a new interview with GamesRadar+.\n\nHow many episodes are in Doctor Who season 1/series 14?\n\nThere are eight episodes of Doctor Who season 1, while Ncuti Gatwa's first full episode was last Christmas' festive special 'The Church on Ruby Road.' Another Christmas special, written by Steven Moffat, is set for December.\n\nThe full Doctor Who release schedule is as follows:\n\nDoctor Who episode 1 ('Space Babies') - May 10 (US)/May 11 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 2 ('The Devil's Chord') - May 10 (US)/May 11 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 3 ('Boom') - May 17 (US)/May 18 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 4 ('73 Yards') - May 24 (US)/May 25 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 5 ('Dot and Bubble') - May 31(US)/June 1 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 6 ('Rogue') - June 7 (US)/June 8 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 7 ('The Legend of Ruby Sunday') - June 14 (US)/June 15 (UK) - out now!\n\nDoctor Who episode 8 ('Empire of Death') - June 21 (US)/June 22 (UK) - out now!\n\nWhere can I watch Doctor Who?\n\nDoctor Who can be watched on Disney Plus in the US and other worldwide regions, then on BBC iPlayer and BBC One in the UK."
