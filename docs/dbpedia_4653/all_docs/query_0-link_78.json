        "text": "Mr Mosley, 67, was found dead on Sunday on the small island five days after he was reported missing by his wife of 37 years Dr Clare Bailey.\n\nAn initial post-mortem report revealed the British journalist likely died of natural causes after he sat on the ground and lost consciousness due to how his body was positioned in the sweltering temperatures.\n\nA source told The Sun on Tuesday that BBC executives intend to air the remaining episodes of Mr Mosley’s TV programme Just One Thing, which was announced in April.\n\n“This was Michael doing what he did best - trying to help people in an entertaining and engaging way that other experts might struggle to do,” the source said.\n\n“The BBC are now considering how usable the footage they have is and will of course consult with his family.”\n\nThe source however said it was “just too early” for family consultation “when they in a state of utter devastation” following the beloved doctor’s unexpected death.\n\nJust three episodes of Mr Mosley’s podcast turned TV programme aired before his passing and, closely following the audio version, it took a deep dive into measures viewers could take to improve their overall health.\n\nSpectators of the recent radio episodes, which aired on BBC Radio 4 on Thursdays, saw the renowned British medic examine the benefits of yoga for stress and how eating intuitively can enrich digestion.\n\nThe TV series was not yet complete with more 30-minute episodes due to air but the UK’s Sun claimed the BBC wish to air them as heartfelt tribute to Mr Mosley and his work in the health and media landscape.\n\nSpeaking to the Royal Television Society in April, the father-of-four said he was “delighted” his “popular podcast series” was being converted into a TV series.\n\n“The idea behind the series is that we show people that making a few simple changes can lead to big improvements in their mental and physical wellbeing,” he said.\n\n“For the series I’ll be travelling across the UK to unearth lots of simple tips to help people change their lives for the better.”\n\nThe BBC on Tuesday confirmed it would release two “special programmes for TV and Radio on Friday 14 June 2024, remembering Michael Mosley.”\n\nThe first series named Michael Mosley – The Doctor Who Changed Britain will air on BBC One and iPlayer on Friday at 8pm and a follow up called There’s Only One Michael Mosley will premiere on BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds on Friday at 11am, according to a statement issued on the broadcaster’s website.\n\nThe statement said the two series will look back on Mr Mosley’s 40-year broadcasting career and air the medic’s last interview at the BBC respectively.\n\nThe broadcaster noted the top TV medical whiz “shared his own struggles with audiences world-wide” and “as a chronic insomniac” who “made programmes about sleep” he would “go to extremes in the pursuit of science, even infecting himself with a tapeworm”.\n\nA restaurant manager discovered Dr Mosley’s lifeless body after spotting his watch flickering in the sun near the beachside eatery on Symi island.\n\nThe British TV presenter's family confirmed Dr Mosley’s body was found on rocky ground beside a fence near a restaurant on Sunday.\n\nHis bag was found uphill from his body at the location, about a 30-minute walk from where he was last seen in Pedi.\n\nA police source earlier told the BBC that Dr Mosley's remains had likely been there for a number of days as his death is believed to have occurred the same day he went missing, about 4pm on Wednesday, local time.\n\nHis wife has paid an emotional tribute to her late husband: \"He did an incredible climb, took the wrong route and collapsed where he couldn't be easily seen by the extensive search team.\n\n\"We had an incredibly lucky life together. We loved each other very much and were so happy together,” she said.\n\n\"I am incredibly proud of our children, their resilience and support over the past days.\n\n\"We're taking comfort in the fact that he so very nearly made it.”"
