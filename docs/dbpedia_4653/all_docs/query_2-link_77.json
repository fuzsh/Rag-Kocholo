        "text": "Rejoice all you Whovians. Your favorite BBC sci-fi drama is coming to Disney XD.\n\nI used to believe that fans of Doctor Who were called Who Heads, but I was firmly corrected by the office Whovian. Whovians are every bit as passionate about their show as the most ardent Trekkie. Or is that Trekker?\n\nNote: Disney XD is not the Disney Channel. Disney XD is the Disney-owned basic cable channel aimed primarily at boys ages 6 to 11. But anyone, even adult Whovians, can watch without undue fear of becoming a social pariah.\n\nDisney XD will feature Series 2 through 4 (2006-2008). Doctor Who originally aired for 26 seasons between 1963 and 1989 and was relaunched with Series 2 in 2005, following a 16-year absence.\n\nThe Disney XD episodes are the three years starring David Tennant as the 10th Time Lord who \"travels through space and time in his TARDIS combating various enemies to save civilizations around the universe.\"\n\nThe TARDIS (Time and Relative Dimension in Space) is the series' iconic blue police call box (see photo).\n\nSeries 2 also features Billie Piper as the Doctor's shop assistant traveling companion Rose Tyler.\n\nDoctor Who will debut with a special preview at 8 p.m. Saturday with Series 2, Episode 1, \"New Earth.\" In it, the Doctor and Rose board the TARDIS to visit mankind's new home far in the future. \"They find gruesome secrets hidden inside a luxury hospital. In addition, an enemy thought long since dead, the paper-thin Cassandra, is out for revenge.\"\n\nYes. An evil team of humanoid-feline nuns in the hospital. Enjoy.\n\nOther episodes feature the Doctor and Rose traveling back in time to the Highlands of Scotland to find Queen Victoria confronted by a werewolf; a spaceship in the future that holds a doorway to 18th-century France, where lethal Clockwork Droids stalk Versailles; and modern-day Earth where the human race is threatened by an army of emotionless Cybermen.\n\nAfter Saturday's preview, Season 2 will continue with a special week-long programming event that will give fans an episode each day from June 13-20.\n\nâ€¢ Barnes chats. The Arkansas Educational Television Network premieres four new episodes of its public affairs series Barnes and ... A Conversation With starting today. Here's the lineup.

The fun begins at 7 p.m. on CBS. The sitcom has already been renewed through Season 10.\n\nDig, USA's biblical conspiracy action/thriller, finds Peter (Jason Isaacs) racing to stop the Order of Moriah's plans to destroy the Temple Mount.
