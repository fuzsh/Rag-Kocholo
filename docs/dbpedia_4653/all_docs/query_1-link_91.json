        "text": "Ncuti Gatwa’s Time Lord has arrived. Here’s what we know about the Doctor Who Season 14 release date, cast details, and plot.\n\nYes, Doctor Who has a new star, and the latest Doctor is bringing all the flair and energy you could want from an intergalactic, time-traveling hero.\n\nGatwa first appeared as part of a unique and exciting Bigeneration, as part of the 60th anniversary of the show back in December 2023. Then, Gatwa reprised his role for the 2023 Christmas special, ‘The Church on Ruby Road,’ which also introduced the Doctor’s new companion, Ruby Sunday (Mille Gibson).\n\nSince it aired, it’s become just one of the most-anticipated and talked-about TV shows of 2024. As a roundup, we’ve got everything you need to know about Doctor Who Season 14.\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 premiered with two episodes on Saturday May 11, 2024.\n\nThere were eight episodes in total, with new episodes dropping simultaneously on BBC iPlayer in the UK and Disney+ everywhere else. The Season 14 finale, Empire of Death, aired on June 22.\n\nHere are all the Doctor Who Season 14 episodes and when they aired:\n\nSpace Babies – May 11\n\nThe Devil’s Chord – May 11\n\nBoom – May 18\n\n73 Yards – May 25\n\nDot and Bubble – June 1\n\nRogue – June 8\n\nThe Legend of Ruby Sunday – June 15\n\nEmpire of Death – June 22\n\nFilming for Doctor Who Season 14 kicked off on December 5, 2022, and wrapped on July 14, 2023.\n\nDoctor Who Season 15 wrapped filming in May 2024, meaning it should be just about a year before we get new episodes back on screens.\n\nShowrunner Russell T Davies recently confirmed he’s already mapping out new Doctor Who episodes for Seasons 16 and 17, too. Given Davies’ promise of “annual Doctor Who, no gap years,” we should therefore expect Seasons 16 and 17 to drop in 2026 and 2027, respectively.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who Season 14\n\nYou can watch Doctor Who Season 14 on Disney+ if you’re in the US, while UK audiences will be able to catch the show on the BBC iPlayer as usual.\n\nIf you’re outside the UK, you’ll need to be signed up to Disney+ and you can do that by clicking the link below.

Here, they battle the Boogeyman, a creation of the children’s own fear.\n\nIn The Devil’s Chord, the Doctor and Ruby went back to the ’60s to watch The Beatles record their album at Abbey Road. But they run into trouble when they encounter Maestro, a music-stealing member of the Pantheon of Discord, who wants to erase music from the universe.\n\nNext was Boom, which saw the Doctor step on a motion-activated landmine on a war-torn planet. The majority of the episode had him standing in place, while he and Ruby tried to work out why the planet’s ambulance systems were killing people without reason.\n\n73 Yards then had the Ruby on her own after the Doctor mysteriously disappears from her side. She’s alone in Wales, constantly followed by a strange woman who always remains 73 Yards away. As the decades pass, Ruby has to work out who’s following her, and how she can stop a power-hungry politician from rising the ranks.\n\nThen came Dot and Bubble, which had the Doctor and Ruby infiltrate the “dot and bubble” system of a futuristic planet. When it’s wealthy and young residents start being eaten by giant slug-like creatures, they have to help Lindy, an air-headed dot and bubble user, to get to safety.\n\nRogue took the duo to Regency-era England, where they took on a Bridgerton adventure wherein innocent people were being killed and taken over by the Chulder. It’s here that the Doctor meets Rogue, a handsome bounty hunter who steals his heart and changes his life.\n\nThings finished out with the two-part finale, The Legend of Ruby Sunday and Empire of Death. In this two-parter, it was revealed that the problems with the TARDIS and Susan Twists’ mysterious reappearances were all because of Sutekh, an ancient deity who the Doctor battled back in Pyramids of Death.\n\nThey also finally revealed who Ruby’s mother was, as well as taking us back to UNIT where the Doctor was reunited with Mel, Rose, and Kate Lethbridge-Stewart.\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 trailer\n\nThe trailer for Doctor Who Season 14 was released in April, 2024, and you can watch it below.\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 soundtrack: Who is the composer?\n\nComposer Murray Gold and the National Orchestra of Wales supplied Doctor Who Season 14’s soundtrack.\n\nGold previously collaborated with Davies on the 2005 Doctor Who revival, remaining in post until Davies’ immediate successor, Steven Moffat, exited the franchise in 2017. He also scored all three Doctor Who 60th anniversary specials and The Church on Ruby Road, as well.\n\nCommenting on his return, Gold said: “I’m so happy to be invited back for another joyful ride in the TARDIS.
