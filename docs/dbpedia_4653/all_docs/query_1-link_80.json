        "text": "Doctor Who spoilers follow.\n\nEvery time the Doctor regenerates, Doctor Who regenerates along with them, transforming into something new.\n\nBut with the end of Jodie Whittaker and Chris Chibnall's era comes a unique sense of familiarity thanks to the return of Russell T Davies, the TV legend who made Doctor Who popular again with his 2005 revival.\n\nAnticipation for a new season has never been greater among the Whovian fandom, but what can we actually expect from the show moving forward?\n\nHop in the nearest phone box and join us as we look ahead to what's coming in Doctor Who season 14.\n\nDoctor Who season 14 potential release date: When will it air?\n\nFollowing Jodie Whittaker's final outing as the Thirteenth Doctor, and that highly-anticipated and very surprising regeneration, the BBC has confirmed precisely when we can expect new episodes – including our very first look at Ncuti Gatwa in action as the future Doctor.\n\nUnfortunately, fans are going to be in for quite a lengthy wait.\n\nMark your calendars for November 2023, when the 60th anniversary specials – featuring fan favourites David Tennant and Catherine Tate – will arrive on screens.\n\nGatwa's first full episode as the Doctor will follow during the festive season in 2023.\n\nDoctor Who season 14 cast: Who's in the new season?\n\nWith the return of Russell T Davies as showrunner comes the arrival of a brand-new Doctor, as is traditional with a handover, and in May 2022, Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa was confirmed as our brand-new Doctor in a surprise announcement on the day of the BAFTA TV Awards.\n\n\"There aren't quite the words to describe how I'm feeling,\" Gatwa said of this historic moment. \"A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared.\n\n\"This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my utmost to do the same.\n\n\"Russell T Davies is almost as iconic as the Doctor himself and being able to work with him is a dream come true. His writing is dynamic, exciting, incredibly intelligent and fizzing with danger. An actor's metaphorical playground.\n\n\"The entire team have been so welcoming and truly give their hearts to the show. And so as much as it's daunting, I'm aware I'm joining a really supportive family. Unlike the Doctor, I may only have one heart but I am giving it all to this show.\"\n\nBut with Jodie Whittaker's final episode as Thirteen came a massive surprise – Ncuti isn't going to be the Fourteenth Doctor, he's going to be the Fifteenth.\n\nWith a shock regeneration, it was revealed David Tennant is back as The Doctor. Not in flashback form, not as a cameo... he's the full Doctor. Yup, we know!\n\nThis makes Tennant the first-ever Doctor to play more than one regeneration. What exactly that means will play out across the 60th-anniversary specials airing in late 2023.\n\nHe will then hand the reins over to Ncuti, who will be joined on his adventures by new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson).\n\nMillie is best known for her role in Coronation Street, but left the soap in 2022 in order to climb aboard the TARDIS.\n\nSince then casting announcements have come thick and fast as filming gets going. New guest appearances include Jemma Redgrave returning as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, head of security organisation UNIT.\n\nEastEnders legend Anita Dobson and It's a Sin's Michelle Greenidge will be appearing in yet-to-be-disclosed roles.\n\nHeartstopper's Yasmin Finney has also been added to the cast in a mystery role as Rose for the 60th anniversary specials, making her the first trans actress to have a significant part in the series.\n\n\"​​I'm happy to be the representation on a show that means a lot to so many,\" she told Vogue Magazine.\n\nWhen Yasmin was cast, producer Russell T Davies offered hints about this Rose character: \"Life on Doctor Who gets brighter and wilder, how can there be another Rose? You'll find out in 2023, but it's an absolute joy to welcome Yasmin to the Doctor Who set.\n\n\"We all fell in love with her in Heartstopper, one of those shows which changes the world – and now Yasmin can change the Whoniverse!\"\n\nMandip Gill has also hinted that her character Yaz could return to the show one day.\n\nWhile appearing on BBC's The One Show, the actress was asked if the centenary special will be Yaz's last outing, to which she replied: \"It will be mine. Well, not forever, because who knows in the world of Doctor Who?\n\n\"But [Yaz's story] definitely comes to an end in that episode, but not forever because who knows? See what I did there?\" the actress remarked.\n\nDoctor Who season 14 plot: What will happen?\n\nEven before Russell's return was announced, the BBC's Director of Drama Piers Wenger said (via Elliot Gonzalez), \"As with any change of Doctor and showrunner, we'll be radical [...] Change is ahead.\"\n\nHowever, few could have predicted that this change would involve the return of Doctor Who's most popular showrunner years after he first left the show. Speaking on this, Russell said:\n\n\"I'm beyond excited to be back on my favourite show. But we're time-travelling too fast, there's a whole series of Jodie Whittaker's brilliant Doctor for me to enjoy, with my friend and hero Chris Chibnall at the helm. I'm still a viewer for now.\"\n\nDiscussing his replacement, Chibnall said: \"It's monumentally exciting and fitting that Doctor Who's 60th anniversary will see one of Britain's screenwriting diamonds return home. Russell built the baton that is about to be handed back to him.\n\n\"Doctor Who, the BBC, the screen industry in Wales, and let's be honest, everyone in the whole world have so many reasons to be Very Excited Indeed about what lies ahead.\"\n\nHowever, fans did grow worried when it was announced that Bad Wolf would take over producing Doctor Who from BBC Studios, potentially causing a loss of £40 million for the BBC every ten episodes that are made. Crucially, ' report suggested that Bad Wolf would also take control of \"creative direction\", but the BBC has since pushed back on this, clarifying that they would continue to have commercial oversight.\n\n\"We're incredibly excited about the future of Doctor Who. BBC Studios is ultimately responsible for delivering the show and this production partnership is about long-term investment that will radically build on the already-huge success of the show and franchise worldwide,\" a BBC representative said.\n\nLet's hope this still allows Russell to put his stamp on the show, perhaps even bringing us more positive LGBTQ+ content than Doctor Who has ever seen before. The Flux finale hinted at queer love between Yaz and the Doctor, but hinting isn't really good enough. What's more, Jodie Whittaker's finale episode did very little to push this further forward.\n\nIt's about time that Doctor Who embraced the here and now with a queer Doctor in the lead.\n\nAnd given all that, we wouldn't be surprised if Russell took this opportunity to make Ncuti's Doctor a queer one.\n\nDoctor Who season 14 trailer: When can we see it?\n\nFans have now been given a sneak peek at what's to come next year, thanks to an exciting trailer.\n\nIt naturally offered a first look at Ncuti Gatwa in action, with a short snippet showing the new Doctor passionately shouting the words: \"Will someone tell me what the hell is going on here?\"\n\nIt's also been confirmed by Russell T Davies that Ncuti will be the Fifteenth Doctor, following the regeneration which brought David Tennant back to the role.\n\n\"If you thought the appearance of David Tennant was a shock, we've got plenty more surprises on the way!\" he said. \"The path to Ncuti's Fifteenth Doctor is laden with mystery, horror, robots, puppets, danger, and fun!\""
