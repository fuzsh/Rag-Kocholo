        "text": "Ncuti Gatwa is the newest star of Doctor Who, and his arrival marks a refresh for the series.\n\nThe Sex Education actor was cast in 2022 prior to previous star Jodie Whittaker’s last episode. Russell T. Davies, who led the 2005 relaunch of Who and departed alongside David Tennant in 2010, returned as showrunner for both the 60th anniversary specials and the new season. Though it would technically be the 14th season, Davies considers this such a relaunch that it is being labeled season 1.\n\n“Ncuti dazzled us, seized hold of the Doctor and owned those TARDIS keys in seconds,” Davies said in a May 2022 statement when Gatwa was announced in the role. “It’s an honour to work with him, and a hoot, I can’t wait to get started.”\n\nScroll down for more about the upcoming season of Doctor Who:\n\nWhen Will ‘Doctor Who’ Season 14 Air?\n\nGatwa’s first episode was the Doctor Who holiday special, titled “The Church on Ruby Road,” which aired on December 25. Disney+ confirmed that the 2024 season will debut on Friday, May 10, at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nIs There a Trailer for the New ‘Doctor Who’ episodes?\n\nA trailer released on March 31 shows the Doctor and Ruby headed for plenty of excitement and laughter, but expect things to take a turn for the worst when the Doctor finds someone he loves in danger. “Honey I’m a much bigger bang than you bargain for,” the Doctor says. “I will shatter this silly little battlefield into dust in a heartbeat.”\n\nHe later adds, “I don’t have a people, I don’t have a home — but I have freedom.”\n\nHow Does Ncuti Gatwa Feel About Being the New Doctor?\n\n“There aren’t quite the words to describe how I’m feeling,” he said in a press release. “A mix of deeply honoured, beyond excited and of course a little bit scared. This role and show means so much to so many around the world, including myself, and each one of my incredibly talented predecessors has handled that unique responsibility and privilege with the utmost care. I will endeavour my utmost to do the same.”\n\nWho Is the 15th Doctor’s New Companion?\n\nBBC and Disney+, the U.S. streaming home for the new season, announced in November 2022 that Millie Gibson will portray Gatwa’s sidekick, Ruby Sunday.\n\n“Whilst still being in total disbelief, I am beyond honoured to be cast as the Doctor’s companion,” Gibson said in a November 2022 statement. “It is a gift of a role, and a dream come true, and I will do everything to try and fill the boots the fellow companions have travelled in before me. And what better way to do that than being by the fabulous Ncuti Gatwa’s side, I just can’t wait to get started.”\n\nGatwa is just as pumped. “Far too excited to sail the universe and battle monsters with this one,” the Barbie star captioned an Instagram announcement at the time. “Believe me we got SO much in store for you.”\n\nWho Is Jonathan Groff Playing?\n\nThe Spring Awakening actor was officially announced in a “key role” in May 2023. The first photos of his yet-to-be-revealed character show him with the Doctor and Millie in regency-era clothing.\n\nGroff said in a statement: “I am so thrilled to jump into the extraordinary mind of Russell T. Davies and watch the incredible Ncuti Gatwa soar in this iconic role!”\n\nWhich ‘Drag Race’ Alum Is Joining ‘Doctor Who’?\n\nRuPaul’s Drag Race season 5 champ Jinkx Monsoon landed a “major role” on Doctor Who. While further character details have not been revealed, the Broadway alum is excited to step into the TARDIS.\n\n“I’m honored, thrilled, and utterly excited to join Doctor Who! Russell T. Davies is a visionary and a brilliant writer — I can’t wait to get into the weeds with him and the crew,” the performer gushed in an April 2023 statement. “I hope there’s room in the TARDIS for my luggage.”\n\nWhich Companion Is Coming Back?\n\nBonnie Langford first joined Doctor Who in 1986 as Melanie Bush, the companion to the Sixth and Seventh Doctors, played by Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, respectively. She made a cameo in 2022 during Whittaker’s final episode as the 13th Doctor and returned as a member of UNIT in one of the 60th anniversary specials.\n\nWho Is The Duchess?\n\nGame of Thrones alum Indira Varma is set to play The Duchess. It isn’t clear if the mysterious royal will be related to Suzie Costello, the character she played in 2008 on Doctor Who spinoff Torchwood.\n\n“I’m thrilled to be in Doctor Who and particularly excited to be crossing cosmic paths with Ncuti, as the Doctor, and look forward to creating interplanetary mischief with him,” she said in a May 2023 statement. “I loved playing Suzie Costello for Russell T. Davies in Torchwood so am thrilled to be entering this world again.”\n\nWho Is In the ‘Doctor Who’ Season 1 Cast?\n\nOther confirmed cast season 14 members include Lenny Rush as Morris and Aneurin Barnard as the “mysterious” Roger ap Gwilliam. No further details were released for their characters.\n\nYasmin Finney will appear as Donna’s daughter Rose again after making her Who debut in the 2023 holiday episode. Anita Dobson, Michelle Greenidge, Gwïon Morris Jones and Genesis Lynea have also been confirmed to appear.\n\nBridgerton star Nicola Coughlan will appear in the 2024 Christmas special where she will reunite with Gatwa, who was her Barbie costar.\n\n“Off to the Whoniverse 👽,” Coughlan captioned an announcement of her casting news via Instagram in November 2023. “@russelltdavies63 [is] the loveliest man in the world, thank you so much for asking me to join you on the joy that is Doctor Who and letting me share the screen with the ridiculously brilliant @ncutigatwa, how lucky am I — I’m loving every minute.”\n\nGatwa commented, “Barbie and Ken back at it again 😍💖.”\n\nMeanwhile, Coughlan’s Bridgerton costar Golda Rosheuvel will join Gatwa’s second season as The Doctor."
