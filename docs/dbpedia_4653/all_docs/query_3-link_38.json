Learn more\n\nMore than 60 years after it first premiered, Doctor Who is back with even more new episodes (and a new face). We'll show you everything you need to know about where to stream new Doctor Who episodes.\n\nNcuti Gatwa joins the beloved, long-running British series as the Fifteen Doctor. Gatwa was previously previewed in the 2023 Christmas special, alongside his companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), but the new episodes mark their first official season. The new season also serves as a rebranding of sorts for the franchise, as it's both a new season and the latest iteration of the series (it's being referred to as both season 1 and season 14). The changes are also reflected in the show's streaming options since the newest episodes will air on Disney+ in most parts of the world.\n\nMost of the episodes this season are written by head writer and executive producer Russell T Davies. Davies was the original showrunner of the 2005 reboot. Steven Moffat took over showrunning duties from 2010 to 2017, followed by Chris Chibnall for a few years. Davies returned as showrunner starting with the special episodes in 2023. One episode from this season is written by Moffat, and one episode is co-written by Kate Herron and Briony Redman.\n\nWe'll break down all your watch options below so you can tune in accurately from anywhere in the world. Plus, we've included a trailer for the new season and information on exactly what time you can expect to see new episodes each week.\n\nSee also: How to watch Pretty Little Liars: Summer School | Where to watch Young Sheldon | Where to watch 9-1-1\n\nWhere to watch new Doctor Who in the US\n\nNew episodes of Doctor Who air on Fridays at 7 p.m. ET on Disney+ in the US. The season premiered with two new episodes, but going forward, only one new episode will be released each week. Disney+ subscriptions start at $7.99 a month, but you can upgrade to ad-free for $13.99 a month.\n\nWhere to watch new Doctor Who in the UK\n\nKeeping with tradition, new episodes of Doctor Who will air on the BBC in the UK. Episodes will air on Saturday evenings on the BBC, but they'll also be available to stream starting at 12 a.m. BST on Saturdays on BBC iPlayer. This is a free option that only requires viewers to create an account.\n\nWhere to watch new Doctor Who in more 200 other countries\n\nWhile new Doctor Who episodes won't be available on Disney+ in the UK, Disney+ will be the show's home in more than 200 other regions. Disney+ prices vary around the world, so you'll want to check the streaming service's website for availability and prices in your region.\n\nWhere to watch old Doctor Who from anywhere\n\nThis is just the latest regeneration of the Doctor, but there are more than 800 existing episodes that you can binge. Check out our full Doctor Who watch guide for information on how to watch all seasons and series from anywhere.\n\nDoctor Who trailer\n\nDisney+ released a brand-new trailer for the new episodes in March. In it, the Doctor can be seen meeting up with Ruby and showing her the Tardis. Check out the full trailer below:\n\nHow many episodes are in the new season?\n\nThe new season will consist of eight episodes. The newest slew of episodes will finish airing on June 21 with an episode titled \"Empire of Death.\" There's no word yet on whether there will be any additional episodes released later in the year, like the holiday specials that the show often partakes in."
