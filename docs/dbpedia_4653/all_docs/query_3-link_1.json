        "text": "If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nAfter the annual Doctor Who Christmas Special, we have the new Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) to replace the Fourteenth Doctor (David Tennant) and the Thirteenth Doctor (Jodie Whittaker). And now, the Fifteenth Doctor gets his first full season of TV — which exclusively drops on Disney+ on Friday, May 10.\n\nThe new season (season 14 of the revival series and season 40 overall) is also the first with writer Russell T. Davies back as showrunner after a 13-year absence from Doctor Who.\n\nAt a Glance: How to Watch Doctor Who Online\n\nAfter taking over from the Fourteenth Doctor’s (David Tennant) brief stint, the new season follows the Fifteenth Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) and his new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) going on a sci-fi adventure through space and time.\n\nSeason 14 also features Susan Twist, Bonnie Langford, Alexander Devrient, Jemma Redgrave, Michelle Greenidge, Angela Wynter, Robert Strange and others.\n\nIf you’re looking for a way to stream Doctor Who, Disney+ starts at $7.99 per month with ads. However, you can go ad-free for $13.99 per month, or $139.99 per year. The streaming service is also home to movies and TV shows from The Walt Disney Company, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm (Star Wars and Indiana Jones), Pixar Animation, National Geographic and more. Watch the trailer below:\n\nWatch Doctor Who on Disney+: Premiere Date and Episode Release Schedule\n\nDoctor Who season 14 premieres with two new episodes, “Space Babies” and “The Devil’s Chord” on Friday, May 10, at 4 p.m. PT/7 p.m. ET on Disney+. One new episode is released every Friday at the same time until the season finale, “Empire of Death,” on June 22. There are eight episodes in total for season 14.\n\nWatch Doctor Who on Disney+: Best Streaming Deals\n\nOne of the best streaming deals to stream Doctor Who is with the Disney Duo bundle, which comes with the ad-supported versions of Hulu and Disney+ for $9.99 per month — that’s a nearly 40 percent savings altogether.\n\nAdditionally, the Disney Trio offers Hulu, Disney+ and ESPN+, all with ads, for $14.99 per month — about a savings of 45 percent off compared to signing up for separate subscriptions. You can even go somewhat commercial-free with Disney Trio Premium. It includes the ad-free versions of Hulu and Disney+ and the ad-supported version of ESPN+ for $24.99 per month.\n\nIf you’re a cord-cutter, Hulu + Live TV comes with Disney+ and ESPN+ for $76.99 per month for the ad-supported package, or $81.99 per month to get the ad-free versions of Hulu and Disney+."
