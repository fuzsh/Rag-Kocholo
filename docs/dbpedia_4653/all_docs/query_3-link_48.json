        "text": "After a string of special 60th-anniversary episodes in late 2023 ending with the introduction of a new lead, Doctor Who is officially back for its 14th season.\n\nIt marks a new era for the series with Russell T. Davies returning as head writer for the first time since 2010, and the Doctor “bigenerating” as fan-favorite David Tennant‘s Fourteen splits in half to become the Fifteenth Doctor.\n\nGatwa, who previously starred in Netflix’s Sex Education and last summer’s billion-dollar smash Barbie, is the series’ first Black lead, and he will play the Fifteenth Doctor for at least two seasons.\n\nThe series also has a new home in the United States: Disney+. New episodes will be released on the streaming platform weekly, just one day before episodes air in the UK.\n\nBelow, we’ve rounded up everything you need to know to tune into this new era of Doctor Who.\n\nWhen Does Doctor Who Season 14 Start?\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 premieres Friday, May 10 on Disney+. New episodes will air each Friday through June 21.\n\nWhat Time Do Doctor Who Season 14 Episodes Come Out on Disney+?\n\nAll new episodes of Doctor Who come out at 7 p.m. ET on Disney+.\n\nHow to Watch Doctor Who Season 14 on Disney+:\n\nYou’ll need a subscription to Disney+ to watch new Doctor Who, but luckily, the new episodes will be available no matter which plan you’re subscribed to.\n\nThe service offers two plans: one with ads for $7.99/month and one without ads for $13.99/month.\n\nGet the Disney Bundle:\n\nIf you want to stream even more and save a few bucks a month while you’re at it, we recommend subscribing to one of the Disney Bundles. The Disney Bundle starts at $9.99/month for ad-supported Disney+ and Hulu, and goes up to $24.99/month for ad-free Disney, ad-free Hulu, and ESPN+’s basic plan.\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 Episode Guide: How Many Episodes Are In Doctor Who Season 14?\n\nSeason 14 of Doctor Who will have eight episodes, in addition to the 2023 Christmas special, “The Church on Ruby Road,” which served as Fifteen’s first regular series appearance.\n\nRELATED: Read DECIDER’s Review of “The Church on Ruby Road”\n\nBelow, find the release dates for all eight episodes of Season 14.\n\nEpisode 1, “Space Babies”: Friday, May 10\n\nEpisode 2, “The Devil’s Chord”: Friday, May 10\n\nEpisode 3, “Boom”: Friday, May 17\n\nEpisode 4, “73 Yards”: Friday, May 24\n\nEpisode 5, “Dot and Bubble”: Friday, May 31\n\nEpisode 6, “Rogue”: Friday, June 7\n\nEpisode 7, “The Legend of Ruby Sunday”: Friday, June 14\n\nEpisode 8, “Empire of Death”: Friday, June 21\n\nDoctor Who Season 14 Cast Guide: Who Is In Doctor Who Season 14?\n\nAs we noted above, Ncuti Gatwa will return as the Fifteenth Doctor, alongside Millie Gibson as his companion Ruby Sunday.\n\nThey’ll be joined by the following actors in recurring or guest roles throughout the season. Some character names have been revealed, while others still remain a mystery.\n\nJemma Redgrave as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart\n\nAneurin Barnard as Roger ap Gwilliam\n\nAnita Dobson as Ms. Flood\n\nMichelle Greenidge as Carla Sunday\n\nJinkx Monsoon as Maestro\n\nJonathan Groff\n\nIndira Varma as The Duchess\n\nBonnie Langford as Mel Bush\n\nLenny Rush as Morris\n\nAlexander Devrient as Colonel Christopher Ibrahim\n\nYasmin Finney as Rose Noble\n\nGolda Rosheuvel as Jocelyn\n\nPaul Forman as Lord Barton\n\nCallie Cooke\n\nSiân Phillips\n\nBhav Joshi\n\nMajid Mehdizadeh-Valoujerdy\n\nTachia Newall\n\nCaoilinn Springall\n\nWhere Are Past Seasons of Doctor Who Streaming?\n\nUnfortunately, the only season of Doctor Who streaming on Disney+ is this current one, plus the series of four specials that aired in late 2023 starring Gatwa and David Tennant.\n\nAll 26 seasons of classic Doctor Who, which aired from 1963–1989 and consists of the First through Seventh Doctors, can be streamed on BritBox, Prime Video, and Tubi.\n\nIf you’re looking for “new Who,” a.k.a. the Doctor Who revival that began airing in 2005 with Christopher Eccleston as the Ninth Doctor, you’ll find Seasons 1–13 exclusively on Max.\n\nWhy Trust Decider Shopping\n\nThis article was written by Angela Tricarico, Commerce Writer/Reporter for Decider.
