        "text": "Doctor Who fans were left furious after the BBC pushed back the scheduled time to air the first two episodes of the sci-fi show to midnight - so it can air the same episodes in the US at a decent time.\n\nThe change means Doctor Who fans won't be sitting down on a Saturday evening to watch their beloved show, with the episode instead landing in BBC iPlayer at midnight in order to keep new Disney partners over in America happy.\n\nAnd so now, die hard fans have expressed their disgust at the scheduled time as it's going against tradition to please the American audience, on May 11. Taking to X, formerly known as Twitter, one person fumed: \"I don't care if it's down to time zones. Doctor Who airing at midnight in the UK so it can air at a respectable evening hour for yanks is when I start flag bashing. burn down the white house immediately.\"\n\nMeanwhile another viewer said: \"Might move to America so I can watch Doctor Who at tea time again.\" A third penned: \"Can the Americans take a step back from the pi**taking for one minute and realise that Doctor Who has been event television in the UK for over sixty years. It is ingrained into our culture and it is made in Britain!\"\n\nA fourth added: \"I speak for everyone in the UK when I say we want to watch it at 7pm on the 10th of May on BBC 1. Appealing to your miniscule American audience is NOT it.” While a fifth pointed out: “Time travel is actually required actually cos I am unable to watch it at midnight.” And a sixth commented: \"I like global accessibility, but the show shouldn't aired at 7pm UK time and the rest of the countries follow that time instead. Feels like prioritising the show for America and not Europe and I'm not a fan of that.\"\n\n\"The simultaneous release all over the world was a great idea. But releasing the episodes in the middle of the night in Europe for primetime US is nonsense. Why didn’t you stay with the common primetime Europe/midday America so we can all enjoy together, like for the specials?,\" fumed a seventh.\n\nEarlier this week the broadcaster braced itself for a barrage of abuse when it announced the major change -for the first time in the history of the show. A press release for the new series read: \"Within the upcoming series, audiences will see the Doctor and Ruby [played by Millie Gibson] travel through time and space on adventures to unknown lands, to the Regency Era in England to outer space worlds and the Sixties.\"\n\nShowrunner Russell T Davies said: “At last it’s my great delight to unleash a whole new season of the Doctor and Ruby’s adventures together. Monsters! Chases! Villains! And a terrifying secret that’s been spanning time and space for decades. Don’t miss a second!” Along with a teaser trailer for the new series on the official Doctor Who social media accounts, it said: “No time travel required! Where will you be watching? Watch #DoctorWho on @BBCiPlayer in the UK on 11th May and @DisneyPlus on 10th May where available.\""
