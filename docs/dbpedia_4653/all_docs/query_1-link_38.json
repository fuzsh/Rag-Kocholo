        "text": "First broadcast on 23 November, 1963, Doctor Who grabbed the nation's attention and has continued to captivate audiences with its fantastical adventures ever since. Over the years, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, David Tennant, Peter Capaldi, David Tennant, Matt Smith, Jodie Whittaker and more have played the charismatic Time Lord. Ncuti Gatwa is the latest actor to take on the iconic role, playing the 15th Doctor in season 14, which is on air now.\n\nThere are also more than 800 episodes from the Doctor Who archive available on BBC iPlayer so see if you can spot the location...\n\nWhere was Happy Valley filmed?\n\nWhere was Beyond Paradise filmed?\n\nWhere is Doctor Who filmed?\n\nDoctor Who has been filmed all across the UK since its inception, including many of the country's most scenic locations and famous landmarks. Here are a few of our favourite Doctor Who filming locations, including several from the latest series...\n\nSt Mary’s Church, Nash\n\nThe graveyard of this medieval church featured in the latest Christmas Special, called The Church on Ruby Road, which introduced Ncuti Gatwa as the 15th Doctor. Located just south of Newport, the church is visually striking and has been described as “the cathedral of the moors” by historian Fred Hando, making it a fitting location for a Christmas fantasy drama featuring goblins and stolen babies. This episode also introduced the Doctor’s new companion, Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson).\n\nGiltar Point, Tenby, Pembrokeshire\n\nIn episode four of series 14 – entitled 73 Yards, broadcast on Sunday 25 May 2024 – the Tardis lands on the beautiful Welsh coast and a dark folk mystery unfurls. The coastal scenes were shot at Giltar Point in Pembrokeshire, as the Doctor’s companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) takes the lead in a chilling adventure.\n\nWhite Cross Inn, Groeswen\n\nBilled as a “small pub with a big heart”, the White Cross Inn dates to 1750 and overlooks Caerphilly town. Rumour has it that this little village inn appears in the latest series of Doctor Who – the pub was closed for a week at the end of December 2022 while filming took place here. But which episode did it pop up in, and why? Watch the Doctor’s adventures to find out…\n\nCardiff Bay Barrage in Penarth\n\nIn the series, the bay acts as the location for the fictional ‘Cardiff Rift’', which is ' – a wormhole in space and time that serves as a refuelling station for the Tardis. Ncuti Gatwa and Millie Gibson were pictured filming here at night for season 14. The 1.1km barrage extends from Cardiff docks in the north to Penarth in the south. Featuring locks and bridges, sluice gates and a fish pass, it also has a landscaped embankment area where visitors can picnic and enjoy views out over the sea and Inner Bay.\n\nCaerphilly Castle, Caerphilly\n\nBuilt in 1271, the impressive medieval Welsh castle and its teetering tower appears in several Doctor Who episodes, including the unnerving two-parter The Rebel Flesh / The Almost People (2011), in which the castle is reimagined as The Monastery, as well as The End of Time, The Eternity Trap, The Vampires of Venice, Lost in Time and The Power of Three.\n\nExplore this vast fortress - the second-largest in Britain - on this walk around Caerphilly Castle. Or if you want to give yourself the creeps, check out The Rebel Flesh on iPlayer and play spot the clone...\n\nDiscover more awe-inspiring castles in the UK\n\nNational Botanic Garden of Wales, Carmarthenshire\n\nDesigned by Sir Norman Foster, the largest single-span glasshouse in the world appears in episode The Waters of Mars (2009), starring David Tennant as the Tenth Doctor. The National Botanic Garden of Wales becomes Bowie Base One, humanity's first colony on Mars, with the Great Glasshouse transformed into Biodome 1. Dig into the full episode of The Waters of Mars on iPlayer.\n\nAlso a big fan of glasshouses? (Who isn't?!) Check out the best glasshouses to visit in the UK.\n\nRhossili Bay, Gower Peninsula\n\nThe most westerly bay on Wales' Gower peninsula, with a beautiful long stretch of sand, Rhossili Bay is considered one of the most beautiful beaches in Wales. In the episode New Earth (2006), it becomes a new planet resettled by humans. As Rose and the Doctor arrive five billion years in the future, landing on the windswept apple-grass, the distinctive shape of Worm's Head reveals our true location.\n\nLook out for the famous sea serpent and sandy bay at the outset of New Earth on iPlayer, and make like a Time Lord on this 7.8 mile return walk from Rhossili Bay to Paviland Cavern.\n\nPowis Castle, Powys\n\nBroadcast in 1981, Warrior’s Gate starred Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, and many of the scenes are set against the striking terraced gardens of the 12th-century Powis Castle.\n\nThe medieval castle is now managed by the National Trust and is open to the public, so you can do a spot of time-travelling yourself on this pretty walk around Powis Castle.\n\nPowis Castle and Garden, Welshpool, Powys, SY21 8RF.\n\nSoutherndown Beach / Dunraven Bay, Glamorgan\n\nYou may know this spectacular South Wales beach as 'Bad Wolf Bay', fictionally located in Norway, in Doomsday (2006).\n\nDunraven Bay also makes an appearance as the surface of an alien planet in The Time of Angels / Flesh and Stone (2010). That seems appropriate, given that the otherworldly landscape once lay at the bottom of a warm, shallow sea near the Equator, with blue-grey rocks formed when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.\n\nDunraven Bay makes a fitting backdrop for the second farewell scene between Rose and David Tennant's Doctor Who at Bad Wolf Bay; catch it from 50.35 in Journey's End on iPlayer.\n\nTredegar House, Monmouthshire\n\nAre there any sections of Tredegar House that Doctor Who hasn't filmed? Set in a 90-acre park, this 17th-century restoration mansion in Newport has appeared in at least 10 Doctor Who episodes, by our count. David Tennant made his debut as the Tenth Doctor in the episode The Christmas Invasion (2005), which featured Tredegar House during a broadcast by Penelope Wilton's Prime Minister.\n\nThe basement became a dungeon in New Earth; the house became the Torchwood Estate in Tooth and Claw and it also appeared in The Girl in the Fireplace, Army of Ghosts (all 2006), Human Nature/ Family of Blood (2007) and The Unicorn and the Wasp. David Morrissey strolled its grounds in The Next Doctor (2008), in which the stable and courtyards became a Victorian London on Christmas Eve in 1851.\n\nPlus, it pops up in The End of Time 1 and 2 (2009-2010), The Impossible Astronaut (2011), The Woman Who Lived (2015) and Spyfall, Part 2 (2020). So if you're any kind of serious Doctor Who fan, you should get there pronto.\n\nWatch The Christmas Invasion on iPlayer.\n\nTredegar House, Pencarn Way, Newport, NP10 8YW\n\nDyffryn Gardens, Glamorgan\n\nThese beautiful botanical gardens, designed at the end of the 19th century and completed in 1909, grace the grounds of Dyffryn House, an ancient estate near Cardiff dating to 640AD.\n\nDavid Tennant's Doctor Who first landed here in 2006 for the episode Tooth and Claw, which featured the estate's Castle Room and courtyard, and The Girl in the Fireplace, in which Dyffryn Gardens become the gardens of the Palace of Versailles in 18th-century France. Subsequently, it has been used for a host of Time Lord adventures, including Forest of the Dead (2008), The Wedding Song (2011), The Girl Who Waited (2011), Deep Breath (2014), Into the Dalek (2014), Kerblam! (2018) and Survivors of the Flux (2021).\n\nWatch The Girl in the Fireplace on iPlayer\n\nChepstow Castle, Monmouthshire\n\nStanding guard over the River Wye, Chepstow Castle was built in 1067 following the Norman Conquest and this grand fortification hosted scenes from The Day of the Doctor (2013). Starring Matt Smith and Jenna Coleman, this 77-minute episode celebrated the 50th anniversary of Doctor Who, and featured previous cast stars David Tennant, Billie Piper, John Hurt and Tom Baker. Quite the Whovian knees-up. Chepstow Castle also provided the location for scenes in the The Rebel Flesh (2011) and The Almost People (2011).\n\nWatch The Day of the Doctor on iPlayer\n\nBodiam Castle, East Sussex\n\nBuilt in 1385, spectacular Bodiam Castle starred as the prime location in the 1983 episode The Kings Demons (1983), starring Peter Davison as the Fifth Doctor. Doctor Who wanders the moated, medieval castle's torch-lit corridors and chambers, discovering that the monarch is a robotic weapon called Kamelion. In Robot of Sherwood (2014), the Twelfth Doctor (Peter Capaldi) returns to Bodiam Castle, which this time has been reinvented as the Sheriff of Nottingham's castle in Sherwood Forest in 1190.\n\nWatch Robot of Sherwood on iPlayer and clock the castle's impressive grandeur at 12.39.\n\nTyntesfield House, Somerset\n\nA gorgeous Gothic Revival masterpiece built on wealth derived from importing Peruvian 'guano' fertiliser, Tyntesfield House becomes a 'haunted' mansion in the Doctor Who episode Hide (2013). Set in 1974, this episode features the Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith, and his companion Clara Oswald (Jenna Coleman) solving a ghostly mystery.\n\nThe shots of the mansion are all of Tyntesfield but the scenes in the forest were filmed at Gethin Forest in Wales.\n\nWatch Hide on iPlayer."
