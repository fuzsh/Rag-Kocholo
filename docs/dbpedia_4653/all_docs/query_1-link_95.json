        "text": "If you could travel to anywhere in the world, at any point in time, where would you go? Liverpool, present day? Obviously.\n\nThe Doctor, the iconic Time Lord thought so, visiting the city in early 2021 to film scenes for BBC’s thirteenth series of the landmark sci-fi, Doctor Who – retitled Doctor Who: Flux.\n\nWhat the flux?\n\nWe don’t know either. Read the official synopsis for Doctor Who: Flux below.\n\n‘From Liverpool to the depths of space, via the Crimean war and a planet named Atropos, which shouldn’t even exist, fighting old foes and new creatures from beyond our dimension, the Doctor and company face a race against (and through!) time to uncover a universe-spanning mystery: what is the Flux?’\n\nWhen is Doctor Who: Flux on TV?\n\nDoctor Who: Flux, Episode 1 is available to watch on BBC iPlayer now, with an estimated audience of 4.43 million watching on BBC One last Sunday.\n\nDoctor Who: Flux, Episode 2: ‘War of the Sontarans’ airs on BBC One on Sunday 7 November at 6.15pm.\n\nWatch the trailer for Doctor Who: Flux\n\nWhy Liverpool?\n\nBesides the breath-taking architecture and unique identity, it has a lot to do with Jodie Whittaker’s newest companion joining the cast – Scouse comic (and legend), John Bishop.\n\nJohn, known mostly for his sell out stand up comedy shows, plays newcomer Dan Lewis, a Liverpudlian who will arrive on screens in Episode one.\n\n“it’s one of the best things that I’ve done since I’ve managed to get into this world of showbusiness. I genuinely feel I’ve learned a lot and I genuinely feel I’ve made good friends, and I didn’t think that I’d come away with that.”\n\nWho’s in the cast?\n\nIn addition to Jodie Whittaker, Mandip Gill and John Bishop, Doctor Who: Flux features a host of acclaimed British acting talent.\n\nStars include Jacob Anderson Rochenda Sandall, Annabel Scholey, Craig Parkinson, Kevin McNally, Sam Spruell, Robert Bathurst, Steve Oram and Thaddea Graham.\n\nBut it wouldn’t be Doctor Who without the TARDIS, aliens and humanoid dogs…\n\nWhere is Doctor Who filmed?\n\nDespite all the travel through space and time, production for Doctor Who is based at BBC Studios in Cardiff, Wales.\n\nHowever, the cast and crew visited Liverpool in March 2021. Filming across iconic city centre locations, including the Museum of Liverpool, serving as a backdrop for the sci-fi storyline.\n\n“Nobody has got a top floor like the Museum of Liverpool, because nobody has got our history.” – Dan Lewis\n\nPictured: Dan (John Bishop) on location at the Museum of Liverpool.\n\nNo, this isn’t a new installation for River of Light…it’s a spaceship! Earlier this month a suspected Sontaran spaceship materialised on the Pier Head outside the Royal Liver Building.\n\nJodie Whittaker reflected on filming for her final series:\n\n“no matter if the logistics or the face of the show seemed different because of masks and all of that, all of the heart and all the love was still there and it was still great fun.”\n\nThe Scousers guide to Doctor Who\n\nIt’s not the first time Liverpool has been closely associated with Doctor Who…\n\nThe legendary Tom Baker, who grew up on Scotland Road, played the much-loved fourth Doctor in the mid-1970s, and Paul McGann took the lead role in 1996 becoming the eighth Time Lord.\n\nAnd in 2008, Kensington-born David Morrissey played The Next Doctor in a Christmas special alongside David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor.\n\nThe celebrations are set to continue, amid next year’s opening of a ground-breaking new interactive exhibition in Liverpool.\n\nDoctor Who Worlds of Wonder at World Museum Liverpool\n\nIn a world premiere, this exhibition will be exploring the science within the universe of the longest-running sci-fi TV show. Visitors will see epic monsters, costumes and props from the series and can engage with original artefacts and sets, making it a must-see for Doctor Who fans.\n\nOpening 27 May 2022 at World Museum Liverpool. Find out more here.\n\nLa Boîte Bleue\n\nNational Museums Liverpool was also involved in quest to #FindTheDoctor over the summer. Following a hidden word in the Doctor Who trailer in July, fans were sent on a hunt to find clues which would lead to the password for a locked Doctor Who website. One of the clues was spotted in a curious painting, La Boîte Bleue (The Blue Box), at the Walker Art Gallery and Museum of Liverpool.\n\nWatch Doctor Who: Flux\n\nDoctor Who: Flux will be available on BBC iPlayer.

Items on display include one of Villanelle’s costumes from Killing Eve worn by Liverpool actress Jodie Comer."
