        "text": "Doctor Who has a date.\n\nThe BBC and Disney+ will launch the latest season of the classic sci-fi – the first since the Disney streamer came on board – simultaneously around the world.\n\nThe show, which stars Ncuti Gatwa as the Fifteenth Doctor with Millie Gibson as his companion Ruby Sunday, will launch on Disney+ in the U.S. and internationally on Friday May 10 at 7pm ET.\n\nThis is the same time that the show will drop on the BBC’s streaming service iPlayer before it gets its linear airing later on Saturday, May 11. It follows a series of specials that premiered at the end of last year.\n\nThe move will sate British fans of the show, who were concerned that viewers in other parts of the world would get to watch it before they did.\n\nThis season of Doctor Who follows the Doctor and Ruby Sunday through infinite adventures across time and space in the TARDIS including through the Regency era in England to war-torn futures.\n\nThe guest cast includes Aneurin Barnard, Anita Dobson, Yasmin Finney, Michelle Greenidge, Jonathan Groff, Bonnie Langford, Genesis Lynea, Jemma Redgrave, Lenny Rush, Indira Varma and Angela Wynter.\n\nDoctor Who is produced by Bad Wolf, with BBC Studios for Disney Branded Television and BBC. Russell T Davies is showrunner, writer and exec producer while Phil Collinson, Joel Collins, Julie Gardner and Jane Tranter also exec produce.\n\nDavies said, “At last, it’s my great delight to unleash a whole new season of the Doctor and Ruby’s adventures together. Monsters! Chases! Villains! Mysteries! And a terrifying secret that’s been spanning time and space for decades. Don’t miss a second!”"
