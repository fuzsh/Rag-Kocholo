        "text": "The arrival of a new Doctor is always big news, and the 15th incarnation of the Time Lord — \"Sex Education\" star Ncuti Gatwa — is all set to make the TARDIS his own.\n\nThis article will tell you how to watch new \"Doctor Who\" episodes for free on BBC iPlayer in the UK. And, in case you're going to be away from home when the Doctor's new adventures land, we'll also explain how you can use a VPN, such as NordVPN, to stream \"Doctor Who\" via your usual service from abroad.\n\nGatwa made his first appearance as the Time Lord after David Tennant's unexpected \"bi-generation\" in \"The Giggle\", the third of \"Doctor Who\"'s 60th anniversary specials. We were subsequently introduced to new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson) in Christmas special \"The Church on Ruby Road\", and her mysterious origin story is set to be a major theme of the new eight-part season.\n\nWith Russell T. Davies (the showrunner who resurrected the British sci-fi institution in 2005) back at the helm, this is one of the most eagerly anticipated new seasons of \"Who\" in years. In fact, it's such a big deal that the BBC and new international streaming partners Disney Plus have branded this run of new \"Doctor Who\" episodes as season 1, instead of continuing the previous numbering system and calling it \"Doctor Who\" season 14. In other words, they're pitching it as both a fresh start for the veteran show, and a jumping off point for new viewers.\n\nReady for an adventure in space and time? Here's how to watch new \"Doctor Who\" episodes, kicking off with the double bill of \"Space Babies\" and \"The Devil's Chord\".\n\nHow to watch new 'Doctor Who' episodes for FREE in the UK\n\nHow to watch 'Doctor Who' season 1 from anywhere\n\nIf you're a UK resident enjoying your own adventures through space and time — or simply overseas this weekend — you can still watch new \"Doctor Who\" episodes for free on BBC iPlayer. However, due to geoblocking restrictions, you won't be able to use the service as you would at home.\n\nLuckily, downloading a VPNallows you to stream your favorite content from anywhere. These simple pieces of software can change your IP address, allowing you to access on-demand content or live TV just as you would at home.\n\n(Don't forget that you'll still need a valid TV Licence to watch new \"Doctor Who\" episodes while abroad — or back on Gallifrey!)\n\nWe recommend VPN services in the context of legal recreational uses. For example:\n\nAccessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service)\n\nProtecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad\n\nWe do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services. Consuming pirated content that is paid for is neither endorsed nor approved by Future Publishing.\n\nHow to watch 'Doctor Who' season 1: Stream on Disney Plus\n\n'Doctor Who' season 1 trailer\n\nIf you can't wait to see what the TARDIS has in store this year, check out the official \"Doctor Who\" season 1 trailer."
