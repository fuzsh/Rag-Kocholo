        "text": "BBC Studios is the commercial subsidiary of the British Broadcasting Corporation. It was founded in April of 2016, as a result of a year-long operation to reorganise the BBC's internal non-news television production units into their own commercial subsidary.\n\nHistory[]\n\nProduction[]\n\nBBC Studios began receiving a co-credit for production alongside BBC Wales during series 10 of Doctor Who and the sole series of its spinoff, Class, later gaining the full credit from series 11 of the show onwards.\n\nDistribution[]\n\nIn 2017, it was announced that BBC Worldwide would be subsumed by BBC Studios. This was done to consolidate the production and distribution of their non-news programming under one company.\n\nSince this consolidation, BBC Studios has handled all home media releases of the franchise, vinyl releases of existing TV episodes via Demon Music Group and is in charge of negotiating & granting commercial licenses for Doctor Who and its spinoffs held by Big Finish Productions, Penguin Random House, and UKTV."
