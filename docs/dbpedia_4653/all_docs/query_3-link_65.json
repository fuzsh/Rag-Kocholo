        "text": "With Doctor Who’s 60th Anniversary just twelve days away AND Doctor Who’s arrival on Disney+ just fourteen days away, it seemed an apropos time to write a li’l piece on the best place for a newbie to begin watching Doctor Who. I love this question because I believe every single Whovian has their own particular answer and – in many, if not most, cases – we believe our answer to be sacrosanct. However, the truth of it is, any show with a SIXTY YEAR HISTORY has plenty of entry points. I’d bet the majority of Doctor Who episodes, especially those which aired during the show’s original run (1963-1989), ended up being somebody’s first episode. And I’d also wager most of us (and by “us” I mean Doctor Who fans) didn’t begin our own relationship with Doctor Who where we’d recommend others begin watching. So there are lots of paths to loving Doctor Who and I don’t want to disparage any of them. If it works for you, yay! That makes me happy :). Though, as it’s me writing this piece, I’m going to explore what I think is the best of all possible ways for a newbie to begin watching Doctor Who. I will warn you in advance, it will most likely be a wee bit controversial. With that being said, allons-y!\n\nNote, if you’re uncertain about whether or not to start watching Doctor Who (which yes, you should ;D), then you may want to read this other post of mine, “Should I Begin Watching Doctor Who / How to Begin Watching Doctor Who” that I wrote a few years back. This post is operating from the point that you’ve already made the fantastic decision to start watching Doctor Who. And GO YOU for so deciding! Anyway, I’ve broken my options for where to start into three ranges – the GOOD option, the GREAT option, and the BEST option.\n\nThe GOOD Option – You Can Start Anywhere!\n\nNow, this may seem a little counterintuitive. But with a show like Doctor Who, the only way it can last sixty years is by being welcoming to new viewers. So you can really pick up wherever you’d like to. It may be a little confusing but if you’re comfortable operating on the fly and sorting things as you go along, then I think you can dive in wherever you’d like. Plus, each new regeneration of the Doctor is a fresh start and a perfect place for new viewers to start, too. So pick an actor you like or an outfit of the Doctor’s you like and just go from there.\n\nIf you really want to start with Classic Doctor Who, I’d say Tom Baker’s iconic Fourth Doctor is the best entry point, jumping on with any new companion (S12E1, S14E5, or S16E1), or you could go with Jon Pertwee’s Third Doctor for a more Earth-bound, sci-fi James Bond-esque feel (S7E1, S8E1, or S11E1).\n\nThough I would say the modern/revival run of Doctor Who (2005-2022) is far more effective starting point than going back to 1963 or 1975 or wherever and trying Classic Doctor Who as your first episodes. It just feels more familiar and thus more welcoming. Which brings us to…\n\nThe GREAT Option – You Can Start With Any of These Modern Doctor Who Entry Points\n\nGiven Doctor Who’s ever-changing narrative, Doctors, and showrunners, there are several places you can start. These are the options I suggested in the above mentioned piece, too. And I stand by them!\n\n1) “Rose” (S1E1) – this is the pilot of the modern incarnation of Doctor Who. You begin here with Christopher Eccleston’s Ninth Doctor and Billie Piper as his companion, Rose. This era features Russell T Davies as showrunner who excels at intimate, character-driven stories.\n\n2) “Smith and Jones” (S3E1) – this is the only option here that comes within a showrunner’s tenure. Russell T Davies is still at the helm but this stars David Tennant’s Tenth Doctor with Freema Agyeman’s Martha Jones. You may feel a bit lost as this comes in the middle of the Tenth Doctor’s story but you learn it all through Martha’s eyes.\n\n3) “The Eleventh Hour” (S5E1) – this stars Matt Smith’s Eleventh Doctor alongside Karen Gillan’s Amy Pond. The era features Steven Moffatt as showrunner who gives Doctor Who‘s stories a more grand, cinematic feel while writing the best speeches for the Doctor.\n\n4) “The Woman Who Fell To Earth” (S11E1) – Jodie Whittaker takes over as the Doctor alongside Mandip Gill’s Yazmin Khan, Tosin Cole’s Ryan Sinclair, and Bradley Walsh’s Graham O’Brien. With Chris Chibnall as showrunner, we get some of the best historical episodes Doctor Who’s ever had as well as a greater sense of family with the larger TARDIS team.\n\n5) “The Church on Ruby Road” (Doctor Who Christmas Special 2023 / Special 4 on Disney+) – Ncuti Gatwa takes the reins as the Doctor alongside Millie Gibson as Ruby Sunday. With Russell T Davies back as showrunner and the new episodes streaming on Disney+, this is the only episode you need to watch before the new season starts on Disney+ on May 11th!\n\nThe BEST Option – You Can Start with “Twice Upon a Time” (Doctor Who Christmas Special 2017)\n\nOkay, so, if you’re not already a fan of Doctor Who you may be thinking, “Huh, coolio. I can do a Christmas special.” But if you are a fan of Doctor Who you may well be thinking, “WHAT ARE YOU EVEN TALKING ABOUT AND WHY WOULD YOU BEGIN THERE???” So let me lay out the rationale for my unconventional choice and, if you’re new to Doctor Who, I’ll also explain why it’s a bit unconventional.\n\n“Twice Upon a Time” was Peter Capaldi’s final episode as the Twelfth Doctor. It includes his last adventure, where he meets a younger version of himself (David Bradley’s First Doctor), and we see him regenerate into Jodie Whittaker’s Thirteenth Doctor. So this episode immediately introduces the concept of regeneration to the viewer. You know from go this being – the Doctor – can and has worn many faces. I think, when you are coming to this show knowing there is already sixty years of history and knowing so many actors have played the Doctor, it makes sense to explore that out of the gate.\n\nAlso, “Twice Upon a Time” was the last episode of Steven Moffatt’s tenure as showrunner. And while it may seem as though you’re “ruining” the ending by starting there, he puts all of his lifelong love of Doctor Who into that episode and, in so doing, creates – to my mind – the perfect single episode summary of who the Doctor is as a character. Yes, the Doctor is an alien who is thousands of years old and regenerates into a new body whenever they are near death. Yes, the Doctor can travel anywhere in space and time in their blue police box – called the TARDIS! – and it’s bigger on the inside. But who are they, really? What do they stand for? What’s important to them? How do they live and move and exist in the universe? And why has this character and this show lasted and been so loved for sixty years? Steven Moffatt answers all of those questions in the most beautiful, accurate, and memorable way. It’s a gorgeous love letter to the Doctor and the world of Doctor Who.\n\nPlus, after “Twice Upon a Time,” you keep watching Doctor Who into Chris Chibnall’s time as showrunner and Jodie Whittaker’s time as the Thirteenth Doctor with “The Woman Who Fell To Earth.” This will be a controversial choice too, I’m sure. But if someone has never seen a single episode of Doctor Who, I will die on the hill that having the first seasons they watch be the most current plays best. These episodes have the most modern special effects, the stories feel timely, and the first female incarnation of the Doctor (along with a beautifully diverse TARDIS team in Mandip Gill, Tosin Cole, and Bradley Walsh) is a brilliant way to start. The contemporary nature of the seasons has the greatest chance of bringing new viewers back to watch enough episodes to fall in love with the characters, too. It feels less dated as, let’s be honest, 2005 was almost twenty years ago and asking any new viewer to commit to twenty years of a show and 176 episodes before they can watch what’s current is a bit much. And I adore Russell T Davies first run but watching the Ninth and Tenth Doctor’s episodes now feels like watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit? with the CGI. It looks like the Doctor is dealing with cartoon creatures. And, if someone is unsure about trying the show, having more modern VFX is the way to go.\n\nI’ve tried this method firsthand, too. While my first episode of Doctor Who was “The Christmas Invasion,” I teach a course on Doctor Who and theology. As I was planning the course I knew hooking the students from go was the most important part. When I teach my course using comic books and comic book movies to explore social justice issues or my course presenting Star Wars as a modern myth, the kids are all familiar with the universes and many are even fans. For Doctor Who though, I only had two kids in the whole class who’d seen it before and only four who’d heard of it before. So after a lot of agonizing over choices, watching and rewatching episodes, and asking my friend Samantha (who loves Marvel and DC and Star Wars and fantasy novels and all that fun stuff but who’s never seen Doctor Who) to try watching “Twice Upon a Time” first with the info I’d give the kids in class, I settled on my choice.\n\nWe began with “Twice Upon a Time,” watched all of the Thirteenth Doctor’s first series (so Doctor Who S11), did a small sampling of other Doctors (Ninth, Tenth, Eleventh, and one more from the Twelfth), and then went back to close with the Thirteenth Doctor and ended with her regeneration in “The Power of the Doctor.”\n\nAnd the kids LOVED IT. While I certainly take credit for planning the course and building the discussions we had around the episodes, much of the credit has to go to those Doctor Who episodes themselves. I had four students in that class who also took my Marvel class. None of them had seen Doctor Who before and every single one of them said they enjoyed the Doctor Who class more than the Marvel Cinematic Universe one! I had three students who admitted – in class and in front of their peers – that “The Power of the Doctor” and Jodie’s regeneration moved them to tears. And quite a few others, while they didn’t say the cried, remarked on how emotional it was.\n\nTeenagers are a hard audience – especially now, in an age of endless media options across endless streaming platforms. But that entire classroom, when only two students who had seen the show before, fell in love with Doctor Who by beginning with Peter Capaldi and Steven Moffatt’s final episode and then following Jodie Whittaker’s tenure as the Doctor with Chris Chibnall at the helm as showrunner. Our class discussions were some of the best of my career, in any class I’ve taught, too!\n\nWhen I saw how well this approach worked for my students, it became my new go-to recommendation for anyone who asks me where to start watching Doctor Who.\n\nNow if you’re reading this and you want to try jumping into Doctor Who this way (yay! aww, thank you for trusting me – I feel so honored) and you’d like the intro material I gave my students (basically it’s just a character rundown so they know who’s on screen when they pop up and don’t feel disoriented), it begins below. If you aren’t interested in the guide, you can pickup reading below the picture of Clara Oswald :D.\n\nEpisode Background – the Twelfth Doctor lands the TARDIS at the North Pole, about to regenerate. After 2,000+ years of life and loss – most recently his companion Bill who died horrifically – he is tired of it all and is planning not to regenerate and instead simply die (something a Time Lord can choose to do). While there, he will encounter his very first incarnation – the First Doctor – who is also wrestling with whether or not he wants to regenerate. (Okay, you know what? Don’t think too hard about this. It’s just your usual fictional time travel stuff – think Avengers: Endgame when Tony meets his dad and/or Into the Spider-Verse when all those different versions of Spider heroes meet.)\n\nThe Doctor – here we see the Twelfth Doctor (left) alongside the First Doctor (right)\n\nBill Potts – the Twelfth Doctor’s companion, a student he befriended while he was teaching at St. Luke’s University in Bristol, who died recently after being turned into a monstrosity called a Cyberman.\n\nNardole – another companion who travelled with the Twelfth Doctor and Bill, he stayed with the people they were protecting from the Cybermen in the battle which cost Bill her life and mortally wounded the Doctor, hence his impending regeneration.\n\nClara Oswald – one of the Doctor’s best friends, she travelled with both the Eleventh and Twelfth incarnation of the Doctor for years, however the Doctor lost his memories of Clara as a result of…you know? I don’t really need to go into the whole backstory here. He lost his memories of her and it was super sad :/. I’m still not over it.\n\nThe Daleks – organisms encased entirely within battle tank-like armor, they are the Doctor’s oldest and most dangerous foes. Created as an analogy for Nazism and Fascism, the Daleks are relentless, sweeping across the universe and destroying anything not in their image. Every incarnation of the Doctor has faced the Daleks on multiple occasions.\n\nAnd there you have it, dear reader, my professional opinion on where – in alllllllll of it’s sixty year history – is the best place to begin watching Doctor Who. What do you think? Do you like the idea? Or, if you’ve another favorite episode you suggest new viewers begin their watching Doctor Who with, please let me know in the comments! I’m always interested in hearing things like that :).\n\nPlus, everyone of my loved ones who I’ve urged to begin watching Doctor Who have fallen in love with it…except Lauren >_<. And I’ve tried! After ages of begging she gave it a shot, beginning with Christopher Eccleston’s Ninth Doctor and Billie Piper’s Rose and didn’t make it to episode four (which, honestly, was maybe for the best as there begins Russell T Davies fat shaming which characterized much of his first tenure as Doctor Who showrunner). But I still think I can hook her. Lauren’s not tried the “Twice Upon a Time” into “The Woman Who Fell To Earth” entry point yet though she was very intrigued when I told her how well it went with the kids. But if you’ve another idea, please let me know!\n\nIf you’re excited to start watching Doctor Who for the first time or, if you’ve tried it on Disney+ and would like to try some of the older episodes, here are some other short pieces you may like!\n\nShould I Watch Doctor Who? / How to Begin Watching Doctor Who addresses the biggest concerns people may about jumping into a show with sixty years of history and also offers some suggestions about where would be good places to start (and why) viewing Doctor Who!"
