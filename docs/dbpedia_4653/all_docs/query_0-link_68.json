        "text": "Doctor Who is set to make a return to the BBC next month, the corporation has announced. One of the show's most popular Time Lords is set to make a comeback, too.\n\nThe programme will return to BBC One and BBC iPlayer on Saturday, November 25, the broadcasting corporation has announced. David Tennant will reprise his role as the 14th Doctor and star alongside comedian Catherine Tate as the Time Lord’s former companion Donna Noble.\n\nThree special episodes will run each Saturday from November 25 to mark the show’s 60th anniversary, starting with The Star Beast. This will be followed by Wild Blue Yonder on December 2 and The Giggle, which will air on December 9.\n\nAnnouncing the news, BBC Studios released three images of the upcoming episodes to the official Doctor Who page on X, formerly Twitter, which showed the Doctor and Donna reunited. The cast ensemble includes Yasmin Finney as Rose Noble, Miriam Margolyes as the voice of the Meep, Jacqueline King as Sylvia Noble, Karl Collins as Shaun Temple and American actor Neil Patrick Harris as the Toymaker.\n\nSex Education and Barbie star Ncuti Gatwa will take over in the role of the Doctor over the festive period. The actor will star alongside Coronation Street actress Millie Gibson, 19, who is playing the Doctor’s companion Ruby Sunday.\n\nThe latest revamp of the series has seen It’s A Sin writer Russell T Davies return as showrunner, the man behind the 2005 revival of the long-running BBC show, succeeding Chris Chibnall who introduced Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor. Scottish actor Tennant, 52, first stepped into the Tardis in 2005 to play the 10th Doctor.\n\nAmong his companions were Rose Tyler, Martha Jones, Captain Jack Harkness and Donna, played by 53-year-old actress Tate."
