        "text": "Jodie Whittaker (Broadchurch, Trust Me) literally dropped into the 11th season, crash-landing Tardis-less through the roof of a train and ushering in a fresh era for a show that was in danger of tangling its viewers in knots. With new producer Chris Chibnall (also Broadchurch) at the controls, Dr Who has a stripped-down version of the familiar theme tune, a more cinematic lens, and a muscular commitment to diversity – this season features the show’s first writers of colour, and among the Doctor’s new companions are a policewoman of Asian descent and an Afro-Caribbean twentysomething with dyspraxia (a condition not usually suited to running down corridors at speed). There’s even room for a middle-aged game-show host, Bradley Walsh, who plays a character called Graham. This diversity also extends to the locations it was shot in.\n\nFor much of the show’s 20th-century history, there was always a certain irony that a sci-fi programme that could be set anywhere in time or space was mainly filmed in a Shepherd’s Bush studio, or in a quarry somewhere in the Home Counties. And it was more than just a coincidence, surely, that the Tardis repeatedly kept on materialising on Earth, with a particular fondness for London. But then that was the show’s strength: it was the very familiarity of the locations that made certain scenes so thrillingly unsettling. Seeing the Daleks crossing Trafalgar Square or the Cybermen walking down the steps at St Paul’s in the 1960s, for example, was as unnerving as watching German stormtroopers march under the Arc de Triomph. As Jon Pertwee, who played the third Doctor, once said, ‘There’s nothing more scary than coming home and finding a Yeti on your loo in Tooting Bec.’\n\nWith the show’s reboot in 2005, the days of wobbly sets were over and brave new worlds of convincing, film-quality CGI were conceived. There was also the budget to film in overseas locations such as Dubai, Lanzarote, Valencia, Trogir in Croatia and Utah, although as David Tennant (the 10th Doctor) said, ‘I've been to many planets in the solar system, and you’d be surprised how many of them look like quarries *(pictured)*in Wales.’\n\nBut one of the biggest changes for Season 11 was a move away from Cardiff and the surrounding countryside in favour of Sheffield. Cardiff and its environs were becoming a little over-familiar – the National Museum of Wales has appeared in various guises, as has Cardiff Castle, Dyffryn Gardens and St Fagans open-air museum. And as well as being the first female Doctor, Jodie Whittaker is the first with a Yorkshire accent. Sheffield has enjoyed previous starring roles in Four Lions, When Saturday Comes, Shane Meadows’ This is England ’86 and, most famously, The Full Monty. So plenty of gritty working-class drama and football, but as a character in the first episode says, 'We don't get aliens in Sheffield.’\n\nPictured: the Peak District hills outside Sheffield\n\nIn the first episode, ‘The Woman Who Fell to Earth’ – a story that fizzles with a brooding, Stranger Things-style noir, and whose plot revolves not around a dastardly plan to implode the universe but an alien hunter seeking human prey – you can spot the Sheffield United stadium*(pictured)* and the Norfolk Park district, along with scenes shot in the hills of the Peak District outside the city (the scene in which the Doctor buys her new wardrobe from a charity shop, however, was shot in a Kidney Research shop in Cardiff). Filming for the series also took place by the Grade II-listed, Le Corbusier-inspired Park Hill Flats, a once-notorious estate that's now home to a contemporary art gallery.\n\nChibnall explained his decision to film in the city by saying, ‘With a new Doctor, you want to ground it in a home, and Sheffield is the home for this series. I lived in the city for a year, and I knew how cinematic and how friendly it was.’ The new Doctor is still out of this world, then, but refreshingly down to earth.\n\nFor the following Season 12, which aired early in 2020 shortly before the Doctor's favourite planet was locked down in a plotline that the show's writers hadn't predicted, some familiar faces returned to the screen, including a rebooted Master, and the pitiless Cybermen. Filming took place in various locations around Wales, including Cardiff, Swansea, Barry and Bridgend, and in Gloucester and Bristol. But more adventurous destinations for the production crew included Cape Town, Tenerife and Bulgaria. Jodie Whitaker's character will return to our screens over Christmas 2020 for an episode entitled, no spoilers, 'Revolution of the Daleks'.\n\nKeep scrolling to see more pictures of where Doctor Who is filmed, plus shots from the 11th season\n\nLike this?
