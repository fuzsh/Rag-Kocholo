        "text": "After what feels like an actual eternity, next week we’ll finally get to watch Ncuti Gatwa’s first season of Doctor Who, as he travels through time and space alongside Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson).\n\nNcuti was announced as the fifteenth Doctor all the way back in May 2022, and made his first appearance in the recent 60th anniversary specials in November last year alongside David Tennant. And after his first solo appearance as the Doctor in the recent Christmas special, we’ve now got a full season ahead of us.\n\nThe first two episodes (yes that's right, it's a double billing) of the new series will debut next weekend on Saturday (11 May) ahead of the Eurovision final. So need to know when to mark your calendar? Here’s what time the episodes are on.\n\nWhat time are the new Doctor Who episodes on next Saturday?\n\nGet ready to clear your Saturday evening, as the first new episode of Doctor Who 'Space Babies' will premiere on BBC One at 6:20pm on 11th May.\n\nAnd then get ready for a double feature as the second episode 'The Devil's Chord' will begin straight after at 7:05pm.\n\nYou can then stay on BBC One for the final of the Eurovision Song Contest.\n\nWhen will the Doctor Who episodes be available on iPlayer?\n\nOk, so if you couldn't possibly wait until Saturday evening (we feel you) then you'll be pleased to know the first two episodes will go live on BBC iPlayer at midnight of 11th May.\n\nFor viewers outside of the UK, episodes are going live the previous Friday evening on Disney+.\n\nGiven this pattern we'd then assume all future episodes will be available on BBC iPlayer at Saturdays at midnight each week.\n\nHow many episodes of Doctor Who are there this season?\n\nFor Ncuti's first season as the Doctor, we'll get to see him and Ruby Sunday in action for eight episodes, with the first two episodes being released on 11th May, and each subsequent Saturday a new episode will release.\n\nWhat's the Doctor Who episode release schedule?\n\nClear your calendars, as for the next seven Saturdays we expect to be sat in front of the sofa watching the new episodes.\n\nHere's the full episode release schedule for this season of Doctor Who:\n\nEpisode 1 - 'Space Babies' - 11th May\n\nEpisode 2 - 'The Devil's Chord' - 11th May\n\nEpisode 3 - 'Boom' - 18th May\n\nEpisode 4 - '73 Yards' - 25th May\n\nEpisode 5 - 'Dot and Bubble' - 1st June\n\nEpisode 6 - 'Rogue' - 8th June\n\nEpisode 7 - 'The Legend of Ruby Sunday' - 15th June\n\nEpisode 8 - 'Empire of Death' - 22nd June\n\nOk, can next weekend hurry up please.\n\nDoctor Who will be available on BBC One and BBC iPlayer from 11th May"
