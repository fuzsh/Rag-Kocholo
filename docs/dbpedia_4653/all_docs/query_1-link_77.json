        "text": "At the end of last year, BBC announced they had made the “difficult” decision to end the medical show Doctors. First airing back in 2000, the broadcast revealed the programme had been axed due to funding challenges.\n\nAlthough the series will return to screens later on in the year for the last time, it seems as though filming has concluded. However, it looks as though one screenwriter who worked on the show is less than happy with the decision for the drama to be cut.\n\nTaking to X, formerly known as Twitter, Philip Ralph wrote a lengthy statement on the matter. He said: “Today is the last day of filming @BBCDoctors A show that has run for 24 years, employed thousands of people, produced more than 4,500 episodes, will call ‘cut’ for the final time.\n\n“As a writer on the show for the past 19 years I’m personally impacted along with hundreds. By the disastrous decision to axe it. So, on this day when the show ceases production (though it will remain on screen until November) here is a [thread] into why I believe it matters that it’s been cancelled, who is ultimately responsible, and what comes next…”\n\nIn the post, Philip stated that the show offered people both opportunity and experience, which he called two crucial things to sustain a thriving industry.\n\nThe screenwriter highlighted the mass amount of cast and crew that worked each year on Doctors, which now have all been heavily impacted.\n\nDuring the lengthy thread, Philip reeled there is no career ladder left as those high-profile creatives continue to succeed while everyone else is waiting to get their break.\n\nHe continued: “The loss of Doctors is clearly disastrous for those who worked on the show. It is obviously disastrous for the industry. And, I would argue, it is also disastrous for the tone of public discourse.”\n\nWithin his thread, the screenwriter continued to share his own thoughts on the entertainment industry and cuts to funding.\n\nTraditionally, Doctors occupied the lunchtime slot on BBC One when it first aired and was later promoted to a primetime slot of 7pm on BBC Two, once Holby City was cut.\n\nIn the statement confirming the news at the time, the BBC stated they were fully committed to the West Midlands.\n\nThey said the funding for Doctors will be reinvested into new programming in the region.\n\nAlthough they’ve promised to give the show the finale it deserves, it looks as though other people are just as furious with their decision as Philip.\n\nReplying to his thread, social media user @rapiersword said: “Well said Phil, a great loss for audiences and artists alike. These shows are important training grounds, employers and ways to develop creative narratives. They address issues that matter, bringing them to wide audiences. They help develop talent and craft. Crazy decision to axe.”\n\n@mmaarrow added: “Brilliant thread about the current state of the TV industry in the UK. [sic]. ‘There’s no ‘career ladder’ left. There’s incredible good fortune – or there’s nothing’.”\n\nWith @spayne128 agreeing: “Such a great thread. Want to highlight the point that it's both harder to get a foot in the door, but then once you're through, many will be forced out again due to lack of work. There's always exceptions and 'hot' writers, but that's not the same thing as a viable industry.”\n\nDoctors is available to watch on BBc iPlayer."
