        "text": "But it didn't take sleuthing Whovians too long to work out some meaning behind the teaser, with fans noting that when the audio is played backwards Donna can be heard saying: \"Why did this face come back?\"\n\nFurthermore, some viewers spotted that a sequence of code shown during the teaser reads \"EV1305\" which could well be a hint that we will be getting a brand new trailer during Eurovision (EV) on 13th May (1305).\n\nAdding to the excitement, the official Doctor Who Twitter account also tweeted and then swiftly deleted a post made up entirely of binary number sequences – which also appear in the trailer itself.\n\nMore like this\n\nRead more:\n\nNcuti Gatwa will 'inject new lease of life' into Doctor Who, says Karen Gillan\n\nDoctor Who confirms more new cast members joining season 14\n\nOne fan noted that cracking the codes reveals the words The Star Beast – a reference to the 1980 comic book Doctor Who and the Star Beast which featured two monsters confirmed to be making appearances in the 60th-anniversary specials, the Meeps and the Wrath Warriors.\n\nWith a few months to go until the specials air, there are likely to be a lot more clues to decipher between now and then – and fans will no doubt revel in finding out more information as the countdown continues to the sci-fi show's return.\n\nThe special episodes will feature Bernard Cribbins in his final role as Donna's grandfather Wilfred Mott, while Heartstopper star Yasmin Finney will portray Rose.\n\nDoctor Who is available to stream on BBC iPlayer with episodes of the classic series also available on BritBox – you can sign up for a 7-day free trial here.\n\nCheck out more of our Sci-Fi coverage or visit our TV Guide and Streaming Guide to find out what’s on."
