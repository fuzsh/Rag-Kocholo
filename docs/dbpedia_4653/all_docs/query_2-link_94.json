        "text": "It's been too brief.\n\nAfter just three adventures back in the TARDIS, today's final \"Doctor Who\" 60th anniversary special will see David Tennant's Doctor regenerating for a second time. Before the show ushers in the all-new Ncuti Gatwa era, however, the famous Time Lord will have to face a very old foe in \"The Giggle.\"\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know to watch \"Doctor Who: The Giggle\" FOR FREE today on BBC iPlayer in the UK. In case you're going to be away from home, we also explain how you can use a VPN, such as ExpressVPN, to stream via your usual service from abroad.\n\nFor Tennant's final adventure in space and time, showrunner Russell T Davies has brought back an adversary who debuted opposite William Hartnell in 1966, as Neil Patrick Harris updates the Toymaker for a whole new generation. According to the official synopsis: \"The giggle of a mysterious puppet is driving the human race insane. When the Doctor discovers the return of the terrifying Toymaker, he faces a fight he can never win.\"\n\nA Doctor's final adventure is always a bittersweet affair, but after the brilliant \"The Star Beast\" and \"Wild Blue Yonder,\" the Time Lord's 14th incarnation is sure to get a memorable sendoff. You can get a tease of what's in store when the Toymaker starts pulling the strings by watching the trailer at the end of this article. Before you tune in today, we'll explain how to stream \"Doctor Who: The Giggle\" wherever you are. And if you want to start catching up on the previous six decades of adventures in space and time, check out our \"Doctor Who\" streaming guide.\n\nRelated: Watch new trailer for 'Doctor Who' 60th-anniversary specials coming to Disney+ (video)\n\nHow to watch 'Doctor Who: The Giggle:' Stream for free in the UK\n\nHow to watch 'Doctor Who: The Giggle:' Stream from anywhere\n\nIf you're a UK resident enjoying your own adventures through space and time — or simply abroad — you can still watch \"Doctor Who: The Giggle\" FOR FREE on BBC iPlayer.

For example:\n\nAccessing a service from another country (subject to the terms and conditions of that service)\n\nProtecting your online security and strengthening your online privacy when abroad\n\nWe do not support or condone the illegal or malicious use of VPN services.
