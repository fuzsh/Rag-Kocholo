But what's really at the heart of Doctor Who that makes it quite so quintessentially British?\n\nJournalist, and self-confessed Whovian, Dan John delves into the stories, the costumes, the characters and the origins of Doctor Who to unravel the very British DNA of the world's longest running science-fiction TV show. Interviews with Alexandra Benedict, a writer of official Doctor Who audio dramas, and Chris Oates, a political analyst and writer of the essay Doctor Who and the New British Empire, reveal how the show has become deeply ingrained in the language of British cultural identity itself."
