        "text": "Doctor Who is the longest-running sci-fi show of all time, but exactly how many episodes are there? We’ve got the answer right here.\n\nThe time-traveling adventures of Doctor Who have been chronicled on our TV screens since 1963, and have since become the longest-running sci-fi show of all time coming ahead of other iconic series including The X Files, Red Dwarf, and the Star Trek franchise.\n\nThe recasting of the lead role has been written into the show’s lore due to a Time Lord’s ability to regenerate and this has essentially allowed for endless possibilities that have kept the series alive for decades.\n\nWith so many different incarnations of the titular Time Lord, you may be wondering exactly how many episodes of the show there are. So, whether you’re a longtime fan or a newcomer wondering where to start, we’ve got you covered.\n\nHow many episodes of Doctor Who are there?\n\nAs of December 11, 2023, there are a total of 874 episodes of Doctor Who.\n\nThe first episode aired on November 23, 1963, and there have been a total of 39 seasons, each with a varying number of episodes, and two distinct eras of the show.\n\nFrom 1963 – 1989 the Classic era of Doctor Who aired and remained cancelled until Russell T Davies revived it in 2005.\n\nThe last episode to be broadcast was ‘The Giggle‘ on December 9, 2023, which was the final episode to air as part of the franchise’s 60th anniversary celebrations that saw the highly anticipated return of David Tennant as the Fourteenth Doctor, and Catherine Tate as Donna Noble.\n\nThe episode also introduced Ncuti Gatwa’s Fifteenth Doctor, who will embark on his first adventure in the upcoming Christmas Special set to air on December 25, 2023.\n\nWhat episode of Doctor Who should I start with?\n\nThere are various jumping-on points that fans will typically recommend for newcomers due to the sheer volume of episodes, and the two unique eras.\n\nIf you’re wanting to experience the entirety of Doctor Who starting with William Hartnell’s adventures as the First Doctor, the classic era Series 1 Episode 1, ‘An Unearthly Child’ is the best place to begin.\n\nAlternatively, if the modern NuWho revival looks more interesting to you, there are several options. Series 1 Episode 1, ‘Rose’ is a great reintroduction to the franchise that effectively sets up the modern revival introducing Christopher Eccleston’s Ninth Doctor and his companion Rose Tyler (Billie Piper).\n\nHowever, if there’s a particular lead actor who’s piqued your interest in the show then you’re in luck, as every new Doctor acts as a soft reboot for the series. We’ve provided a full rundown of each modern Doctor and the perfect jumping-on episodes for their eras below:\n\nNinth Doctor: Christopher Eccleston – Series 1 Episode 1: ‘Rose’\n\nTenth Doctor: David Tennant – Christmas Special: ‘The Christmas Invasion’\n\nEleventh Doctor: Matt Smith – Series 5 Episode 1: ‘The Eleventh Hour’\n\nTwelfth Doctor: Peter Capaldi – Series 8 Episode 1: ‘Deep Breath’\n\nThirteenth Doctor: Jodie Whittaker – Series 11 Episode 1: ‘The Woman Who Fell To Earth’\n\nFinally, if you’re especially interested in the show’s 60th-anniversary episodes and want to catch up beforehand, we’d recommend at least experiencing the entirety of Donna’s story, starting with ‘The Runaway Bride’ Christmas Special, then jumping to Series 4, Episode 1 ‘Partners in Crime’ and concluding with Series 4, Episode 13 ‘Journey’s End.’"
