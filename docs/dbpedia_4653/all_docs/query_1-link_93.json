        "text": "A director of BBC show Doctors has begged fans not to attempt to visit the filming site of the soap as they wind up filming the series after it was cancelled.\n\nFans of the long-running lunchtime drama - which has aired on the BBC since the year 2000 - were devastated last year when it was announced that the series would be coming to an end. Unlike other soaps such as the BBC’s EastEnders or rival ITV show Coronation Street, Doctors does not offer fans the chance to take organised tours of the filming locations.\n\nDoctors has been on the air for 24 years and since 2004 has been filming in the Selly Oak area of Birmingham - with the production base being set in the centre of the BBC’s Drama Village, on the University of Birmingham’s campus. Fans are able to access the grounds, but now show bosses are begging viewers not to show up as they prepare to film some of the last ever scenes.\n\nNiall Fraser has worked as a director on the show since 2007 and has pleaded that fans allow the cast and crew to go about their work undisturbed. He has issued a statement which he urged fans of Doctors to spread far and wide.\n\nNiall wrote: “I totally get that some of our loyal and lovely fans want to visit the set this coming week. We all appreciate that without the fans we wouldn’t even have made it to 23 years. But could you possibly find a way to make this point…\n\n“Please please please do not visit on Friday. This will be a very emotional and difficult day for cast and crew. Also, please do not visit Tuesday AM, as due to the nature of what we will be filming we need a visitor free site. Wednesday & Thursday visits are not such a problem, but to exteriors only. There will be no access to interiors of sets, and security will be enforcing this. Much appreciated and huge love to all.”\n\nNiall’s plea was shared via a Doctors fan X account that reiterated his urge, sharing his words and writing: \"@bbcdoctors fans please if you want to visit the set this week take this into consideration please #bbcdoctors Also please retweet to reach as many fans as we can. Thank You. And I have no idea what's being filmed Tuesday.\"\n\nLast October, the BBC announced they were axing the long-running show due to budget constraints. An official statement said: “The cost of the programme has increased significantly and further investment is also now required to refurbish the site where the show is made, or to relocate it to another home. With a flat licence fee, the BBC’s funding challenges mean we have to make tough choices in order to deliver greater value to audiences. We remain fully committed to the West Midlands and all of the funding for Doctors will be reinvested into new programming in the region.\n\n“We would like to thank all the Doctors cast and crew who have been involved in the show since 2000. We know the crucial role Doctors has played in nurturing talent, and we will work to develop new opportunities to support skills in scripted programming.” Fans still have several months of episodes left to look forward to as the last ever episodes won’t air on the BBC until December."
