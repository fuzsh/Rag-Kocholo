Viewers not only have three anniversary specials to look forward to with David Tennant back as the Doctor but also a whole new Time Lord in the shape of Ncuti Gatwa - who has just started filming his second series.\n\nProduction seems to be moving very fast on the new era of Doctor Who as series 14, which airs next year, wrapped months ago. After a short summer break, which included a couple of reshoots, the production team are back in Cardiff filming.\n\nOn Monday, October 30 cast and crew were spotted filming in a variety of different locations across the Welsh capital, including Cardiff University. Another location was at Mansion House and Ncuti was spotted on set. Vote who your favourite Doctor is in our poll below.\n\nREAD MORE: I went to Doctor Who's 60th anniversary concert and was immediately transported back to the best years of my childhood\n\nREAD MORE: The Welsh warehouse where special effects for the world's biggest TV shows and films are created\n\nWhile details are a little sketchy on which episode is currently being filmed, it is assumed that it is next year’s Christmas special. Filming photos have teased that the episode will be set in New York during wartime as a hot dog stand was snapped by a fan.\n\nFilming took place throughout most of Monday and as the sun went down, work continued on the new episode. Extras were seen running into the university building as an elderly man, who was also spotted at Mansion House, looked out from a balcony with a pair of binoculars.\n\nNcuti’s incarnation of the Doctor already has a great number of costumes in his wardrobe and this episode will see him don yet another new outfit. The actor was spotted wearing a yellow polo shirt, brown trousers and white trainers - and his stunt double was pictured wearing the same leather coat Ncuti has been seen wearing in promotional images.\n\nAs the photos emerged from filming, fans reacted in their dozens on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), with one person writing: “loving the colour palette he never misses in these outfits,” in reference to the Fifteenth Doctor’s clothing.\n\nA second wrote of Ncuti’s costume: “I must say that every single costume that Ncuti wears just never misses. Kinda iconic really.” And a third said: “THE WAY I WAS STOOD WAITING FOR AN HOUR AND THEN 10 MINUTES AFTER I LEAVE HE COMES OUT,” irritated that they were unable to catch a glimpse of the actor.\n\nOn Tuesday, October 31 two other actors were spotted filming on St Mary Street in Cardiff. Derry Girls' Nicola Coughlan emerged from the back of a London taxi and Plebs star Joel Fry was also snapped filming."
