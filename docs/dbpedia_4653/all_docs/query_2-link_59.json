        "text": "BBC fans have been left divided over the new series of Doctor Who, with some loyal viewers branding the show as \"woke\" and \"unwatchable.\" The 14th season of the long-running fantasy series returned to our screens this month.\n\nSex Education star Ncuti Gatwa started his travels as the Fifteenth Doctor alongside new companion Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson). Over the weekend, there was a double bill as fans were treated to two episodes ahead of the Eurovision Grand Final.\n\nFans were also introduced to some new villians, including American drag artist Jinkx Monsoon who played The Maestro character in the second episode. There were also a number of cameos made by some familiar Strictly Come Dancing stars.\n\nFollowing its return, fans watching at home have reacted online to the new series. One person slammed: \"After the cast and crew told the old #DoctorWho fans to stop watching in favour of the 'modern audience', the current season's 2-episode premiere received the lowest overnight ratings in the show's HISTORY!!! #RIPDoctorWho.\"\n\nA second person chimed in: \"#RIPDoctorWho Wow. Well Dr Who is totally unwatchable now. Maybe have a Dr Who series again instead of a platform for gender politics and radical left wing ideology? Go woke go broke.\"\n\nA third person also commented on X: \"The Maestro was probably one of the worst things I've ever seen. No exaggeration. #RIPDoctorWho.\"\n\nHowever, other fans were delighted with the new series. One person praised: \"Maestro reminds of a DC Comics Silver age villain and I rather like it ! #DoctorWho.\"\n\nAnother also said: \"In a poor episode of #DoctorWho the best thing in it was Ncuti. He delivered a controlled, authentic and commanding performance despite a mess created by a badly executed villain. He is a really good actor & feels like ‘the Doctor’. Shout out to Gibson who is also ace.\"\n\nA third person also weighed in: \"Just watched #DoctorWho and while Space Babies was just fine I absolutely LOVED The Devil’s Chord - a ridiculously fabulous camp romp with one of the greatest ever performances from Jinkx Monsoon.\"\n\nThe reviews come just as the overnight ratings of Doctor Who show a drop. The BBC One premiere of episode one on Saturday night consisted of only 2.6 million viewers and 2.4 million for the second episode.\n\nThese figures do not take into account streaming figures on BBC iPlayer, on which the episodes are available to stream prior to their broadcast on BBC One on Saturday evening.\n\nDoctor Who returns on Saturday 18 May on BBC One."
