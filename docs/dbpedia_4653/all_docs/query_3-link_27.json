Viewers got a sneak peek of the new Fifteenth Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa, in the Christmas special at the end of last year, and he will make his return for a full new season soon. Gatwa is just the latest version of the Doctor and marks 60 years of TV history.\n\nThe recent 60th-anniversary specials also brought back the beloved former Doctor and Companion duo played by David Tennant and Catherine Tate, sparking quite a wave of nostalgia for past seasons. If you want to rewatch your favorite Doctor's seasons or binge the entire series for the first time, we've got you covered.\n\nBBC iPlayer has all seasons of Doctor Who available to stream for free, and Max and Disney Plus also have some regional offerings. If you're not in the UK, we'll show you how to watch all seasons of Doctor Who live for free using a VPN.\n\nSee also: How to watch Echo online | Where to watch 9-1-1 | Where to watch Friends\n\nHow to watch all seasons of Doctor Who in the UK\n\nAll seasons of Doctor Who are available to stream on BBC iPlayer. This means that UK viewers can watch the modern seasons, the classic series, and the recent 60th anniversary specials all in one place. Plus, this is where viewers can catch the upcoming new episodes. BBC iPlayer is free and just requires that you sign in, so you'll have access to more than 800 episodes for free in no time at all. A few episodes from the classic series, including those that make up the \"An Unearthly Child\" story, are missing due to a licensing dispute.\n\nHow to watch modern seasons of Doctor Who in the US\n\nUS viewers have a much more limited selection of Doctor Who episodes than the UK library. All modern (revived) seasons, from the Ninth Doctor to the Thirteenth Doctor, are available to stream on Max. A Max subscription starts at $9.99 per month.\n\nHow to watch the Doctor Who 60th anniversary specials\n\nThe four 60th anniversary specials are available on BBC iPlayer in the UK. For many other countries – including the US, Canada, and Australia – the specials are available to stream on Disney Plus. Disney Plus plans start at $7.99 per month. The next season will land on the Disney service in those countries later this year, too.\n\nHow to watch the new season of Doctor Who\n\nThe new season of Doctor Who, which features Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor, will be released on Disney Plus in the US and other regions on Friday, May 10, at 7 p.m. ET. They will simultaneously be available to stream through the aforementioned BBC iPlayer in the UK on Saturday, May 11 at 12 a.m. BST. UK Disney Plus will not have the new episodes, as this will be exclusive to the BBC. The season will start with two new episodes and then release weekly on Fridays (or Saturdays, depending on where you are in the world).\n\nHow to watch all Doctor Who seasons for free from anywhere\n\nIf you're not in the UK and want to watch all seasons of Doctor Who for free, you can use a VPN (virtual private network). VPNs are helpful because they unlock various streaming options where permitted and also help boost your online privacy. VPNs work by changing your device's location to a country with different servers, allowing you to access various websites and apps.\n\nWe recommend ExpressVPN, a straightforward VPN with a 30-day money-back guarantee. If you want to find more information, take a look at our ExpressVPN review and read on to learn how to use it.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who episodes with a VPN\n\nSign up for a VPN if you don't have one.\n\nInstall it on the device you're using to watch the movie.\n\nTurn it on and set it to a UK location.\n\nGo to BBC iPlayer.\n\nSign up for an account with a local postcode.\n\nEnjoy watching Doctor Who.\n\nHow to watch Doctor Who spin-offs\n\nMultiple Doctor Who spin-off series are available to stream on BBC iPlayer, including The Sarah Jane Adventures and Torchwood. These two series are available to stream on Max in the US.\n\nNote: The use of VPNs is illegal in certain countries, and using VPNs to access region-locked streaming content might constitute a breach of the terms of use for certain services. Insider does not endorse or condone the illegal use of VPNs."
