        "text": "Doctor Who is rooted in Wales since its return back in 2005, with then (and about to return) showrunner, Russell T Davies choosing to base the BBC show's production here.\n\nWith the latest series about to air on BBC One, Doctor Who: Flux will be the final instalment starring Jodie Whittaker. It will also see John Bishop make his debut on the show and Mandip Gill return as Yaz.\n\nRead more: Russell T Davies returns to Doctor Who as showrunner ahead of show's 60th anniversary\n\nThe show has often been cited as kicking off the popularity of Wales as a location for filming for many TV shows and films, with the rate of productions since 2005 increasing. The likes of HBO's His Dark Materials, Sky's A Discovery of Witches and The Pembrokeshire Murders have been made here, plus many more, which you can read about here.\n\nIn the series about to air, some scenes have been filmed in Wales while previous Jodie Whittaker episodes have also shot in Sheffield, too.\n\nWe'll start off with those locations used in series 13, and also include many more from previous series.\n\nRoath, Cardiff\n\nEarlier in 2021 the crew were spotted at The Gate for the newest (13th) series. Fans reported that Jodie Whittaker and Mandip Gill were spotted on set.\n\nGrange Gardens, Cardiff\n\nStaff at The Hideout Cafe in the Grangetown park were chuffed as stars Bradley Walsh and John Bishop popped by for a cuppa in between filming and photography.\n\nZara Ali, the owner of The Hideout in Grange Gardens, said the television crew unloaded their equipment around midday with the famous faces appearing on the scene.\n\n\"I thought they were just taking a few shots of the TARDIS, but no - Bradley Walsh came, John Bishop and Jodie Whittaker,\" she recalled.\n\nAtlantic College, Vale of Glamorgan\n\nBack in the spring, Mandip and a guest star, Game of Thrones' Jacob Anderson, were spotted filming scenes at the College near Llantwit Major.\n\nA college which takes in royal pupils from around the globe, the building has also featured in Wolf Hall, Keeping Faith and Decline and Fall with Eva Longoria.\n\nWatch the trailer for Doctor Who: Flux\n\nKong's, Cardiff\n\nThe St Mary St bar was taken over in back in March for scenes for series 13.
