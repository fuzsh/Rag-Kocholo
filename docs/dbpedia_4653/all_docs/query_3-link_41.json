        "text": "Doctor Who is back for eight brand new episodes after a Christmas Day special gave fans their first proper look at new star Ncuti Gatwa. A new era of the BBC show was ushered in at the end of 2023, with former showrunner Russell T Davies back at the helm.\n\nWhovians were treated to special episodes featuring previous stars David Tennant and Catherine Tate before meeting Gatwa's Fifteenth Doctor in the third 60th anniversary special when the Doctor \"bi-generated\". His first solo full-length episode on Christmas Day saw him encounter future companion Ruby Sunday, played by Coronation Street’s Millie Gibson.\n\nIt's now time for the main event - a new series with eight episodes, the first since the BBC struck a deal with Disney+. It means a bigger budget and adventures on a bigger scale than ever before.\n\nRead on to find out everything you need to know about the new series.\n\nWhen is the new series of Doctor Who on BBC One?\n\nA double bill of new episodes will land on BBC iPlayer on Saturday May 11 before airing on BBC One later in the day.\n\nThe episode titles for the new series are Space Babies, The Devil’s Chord, Boom, 73 Yards, Dot And Bubble, Rogue, The Legend Of Ruby Sunday and Empire Of Death.\n\nWhat time can you watch the new Doctor Who?\n\nThe episodes will be on BBC iPlayer from midnight on Saturday (May 11). The first episode, Space Babies, will then air at 6.20pm on BBC One, followed by The Devil’s Chord at 7.05pm.\n\nOutside the UK, Doctor Who will begin streaming on May 10 on Disney+.\n\nNew Doctor Who cast list in full\n\nEpisode 1: Space Babies\n\nThe Doctor - Ncuti Gatwa\n\nRuby Sunday - Millie Gibson\n\nJocelyn Sancerre - Golda Rosheuvel\n\nCarla Sunday - Michelle Greenidge\n\nCherry Sunday - Angela Wynter\n\nEric - Mason McCumskey\n\nVoice of Eric - Sami Amber\n\nPoppy - Sienna-Robyn Mavanga-Phipps\n\nVoice of Poppy - Shola Olaitan-Adjiboye\n\nVoice of Adjani - Lonnee Archibong\n\nVoice of Marcel - Param Patel\n\nVoice of Sandra - Cadence Williams\n\nRico Trieste - Jesus Reyes Ortiz\n\nLucia Colasanto - Yasmine Bouabid\n\nBogeyman - Robert Strange\n\nEpisode 2: The Devil's Chord\n\nThe Doctor - Ncuti Gatwa\n\nRuby Sunday - Millie Gibson\n\nMaestro - Jinkx Monsoon\n\nTimothy Drake - Jeremy Limb\n\nHenry - Kit Rakusen\n\nGeorge Martin - Ed White\n\nPaul McCartney - George Caple\n\nJohn Lennon - Chris Mason\n\nGeorge Harrison - Philip Davies\n\nRingo Starr - James Hoyles\n\nCilla Black - Josie Sedgewick-Davies\n\nVinnie - Simon Jason-Smith\n\nStudio producer - Chan Shoker\n\nElderly woman - Laura June Hudson\n\nTea lady - Susan Twist\n\nTea trolley lady - Sherinne Kayra Anderson\n\nHerself - Shirley Ballas\n\nHimself - Johannes Radebe\n\nHimself - Murray Gold\n\nWho is guest starring in the new Doctor Who series?\n\nSpace Babies, the first episode of the new series, will see the Doctor and Ruby Sunday on a baby farm being run by babies facing off against a Bogeyman. Bridgerton star Golda Rosheuvel plays Jocelyn in the episode.\n\nRosheuvel said she got to the end of a press tour for the Bridgerton prequel Queen Charlotte: A Bridgerton Story, and she told her agent she would love to next star in Doctor Who. The 54-year-old said: “It’s one of those shows that every actor has their eye on. It’s like a rite of passage,”\n\n“I had auditioned for it several times over the years, and friends had always pipped me to the post. But now the timing was definitely right.\n\n\"I just randomly put the request out there, and it came back. So the stars, the solar system, the whole Doctor Who universe aligned.\"\n\nThe second episode of the series will see the Doctor and Ruby Sunday meet The Beatles, but discover that the all-powerful Maestro – played by US drag queen and actor Jinkx Monsoon – is changing history. Jinkx Monsoon, real name Jerick Hoffer, said \"no-one cared that this was only my third live-action scripted TV appearance\", adding that Gatwa \"was just so generous\" while filming.\n\nFuture guest stars for the new series announced so far include Jonathan Groff (Hamilton), Indira Varma, Bonnie Langford, Lenny Rush (Am I Being Unreasonable?), Paul Forman (Emily in Paris), Tachia Newall (Waterloo Road), Sian Phillips, Callie Cook, Pete Machale, Aneurin Barnard, Miles Yekinni, Hemi Yeroham and Bhav Joshi.\n\nJemma Redgrave will return as Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, along with Anita Dobson as the mysterious Mrs Flood and Bonnie Langford is back as former companion Mel. And Russell T Davies told Entertainment Weekly that fans can also expect to see Yasmin Finney again as Donna Noble's daughter Rose.\n\nTry MEN Premium for FREE by clicking here for no ads, fun puzzles and brilliant new features."
