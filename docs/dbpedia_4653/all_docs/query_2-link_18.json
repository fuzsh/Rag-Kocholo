        "text": "The Doctor, a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey\n\nA Madman with a Box\n\nThe Doctor is not from Earth, he is a Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey. The Time Lords were considered to be one of the oldest and most powerful races in the universe. Sometime in the future the Time Lords went to war against the Daleks and lost, the Doctor is the only known survivor.\n\nThe Doctor having recently escaped Gallifrey and their strict culture was not comfortable with meeting other people on Earth. When Ian and Barbara, two of his Granddaughters school teachers on Earth discovered the TARDIS he kidnapped them because he feared that they would tell others about what they had seen.\n\nOver time the Doctor learnt to trust other people. The Doctor also saw humans ability to block out certain things they refused to believe in as noted in the “Aliens of London”.\n\nThe TARDIS\n\nTime and Relative Dimension in Space\n\nThe TARDIS is a Type 40 time and space machine. TARDIS stands for Time and Relative Dimension in Space. The TARDIS is supposed to change its appearance on each trip to blend in with its surroundings however the Doctors has a broken chameleon circuit which stops it from working properly.\n\nThe TARDIS is dimensionally transcendental, meaning it’s bigger on the inside than the outside. The interior exists in a different, relative, dimension to the exterior.\n\nFind out more about the TARDIS\n\nThe Monsters\n\nThe Daleks first appeared in the second Doctor Who story, they were the first monsters to face the Doctor in the TV series. The Cybermen appeared a few years later in the 1st Doctors final story. The Master is a rival Time Lord who only cares about causing destruction in the universe.\n\nOther popular enemies include the Sontarans, Ice Warriors and Silurians. The Sontarans are a clone race bred for war, they are one of the few aliens to infiltrate Gallifrey. The Ice Warriors were originally a warrior race from Mars however in the 50th century they became respected members of a Galactic Federation. The Silurians originally inhabited the Earth, before man. The Silurians are not a violent species but many of their species want to reclaim the Earth as their own.\n\nFind out more about the Daleks\n\nFind out more about the Cybermen\n\nFind out more about the Master\n\nThe Time Lords\n\nThe Time Lords are a powerful but peaceful race. They have two hearts and the ability to regenerate their bodies. The 2nd Doctor claimed that Time Lords could live practically forever barring accidents.\n\nThe Time Lords have a strict policy of non-interference with the universe which is why the 2nd Doctor was put on trial for interfering with other cultures. There have been a few occasions where the Time Lords have felt the need to intervene most notably in “Genesis of the Daleks” where the Doctor was asked to go back in time and prevent the creation of the Daleks."
