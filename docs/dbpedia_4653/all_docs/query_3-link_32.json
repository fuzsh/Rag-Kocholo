        "text": "After what has felt like an interminable wait, we are finally in the thick of Ncuti Gatwa's first season as The Doctor in Doctor Who, with show legend Russell T Davies back at the helm as showrunner.\n\nThe joint BBC and Disney venture delivered a two-part premiere, followed by former showrunner Steven Moffat's writing return for 'Boom' and then the Doctor-lite '73 Yards', which spun out over companion Ruby Sunday's life.\n\nThis week sees the sci-fi show foray into tech dystopia territory with 'Dot and Bubble'.\n\nWith that BBC/Disney partnership in mind, the legendary show is now also catering to a US audience as well as UK-based Whovians, so we have slightly different airtimes to those we might be used to from Jodie Whittaker's run as the Doctor.\n\nHere are all the details about the new release schedule for Doctor Who in the US and the UK, so you don't miss any of the upcoming season.\n\nHow to watch the new season of Doctor Who\n\nFor Whovians in the UK, episodes in this season of Doctor Who will drop first on BBC iPlayer on Saturday morning.\n\nThe episodes will then air on BBC One later on Saturday night – scroll on for exact timing details for traditional TV fans.\n\nFans over in the US can expect the episodes on Disney+ every Friday.\n\nWhat's the Doctor Who episode release schedule?\n\nRussell T Davies has teased that upcoming fifth episode 'Dot and Bubble' takes the show into \"Black Mirror territory\".\n\nThe episode sees the Doctor and Ruby arrive in the city of Finetime, where a horde of monsters are terrorising the tech-savvy Gen Z population there.\n\nIn the latest issue of Doctor Who Magazine, Davies said: \"This is probably our clearest step into Black Mirror territory, which I love.\n\n\"I'm a huge fan of Charlie Brooker. He's immensely brilliant. But there's a little bit more freedom and Doctor Who madness in 'Dot and Bubble'. There's a sense of fun. And monsters in the middle of it.\n\n\"So although it's Black Mirror-like, it's more Doctor Who. It's got the bones and the blood of our favourite show. I hoot a lot when I watch it.\"\n\nThe fifth episode will drop on BBC iPlayer at midnight on Saturday, June 1. It will premiere on BBC One at 6.50pm.\n\nOver in the US and worldwide, the episode will premiere on Friday, May 31 at 4pm Pacific/7pm Eastern on .\n\nFor the full Doctor Who episode release pattern, keep reading.\n\nWhen will the new Doctor Who episode 6 be out?\n\nThe Doctor returns next weekend in the highly anticipated episode six, titled 'Rogue', which will guest star Indira Varma and Jonathan Groff.\n\nThe official synopsis says the episode will see the Doctor and Ruby land in 1813, where guests at the Duchess's party are being murdered. While they're there, a mysterious bounty hunter called Rogue will \"change the Doctor's life forever\".\n\nEpisode six will arrive on Saturday, June 8 in the UK and Friday, June 7 in the US. It will premiere on BBC One at 6.50pm. The episode will also be available to watch early on BBC iPlayer and from midnight.\n\nHow many episodes will Doctor Who season 14 have?\n\nThere are eight episodes in total coming in this season, with the full release schedule as follows:\n\nEpisode 1 'Space Babies' – May 11 (UK)/May 10 (US)\n\nEpisode 2 'The Devil's Chord' – May 11 (UK)/May 10 (US)\n\nEpisode 3 'Boom' – May 18 (UK)/May 17 (US)\n\nEpisode 4 '73 Yards' – May 25 (UK)/May 24 (US)\n\nEpisode 5 'Dot and Bubble' – June 1 (UK)/May 31(US)\n\nEpisode 6 'Rogue' – June 8 (UK)/June 7 (US)\n\nEpisode 7 'The Legend of Ruby Sunday' – June 15 (UK)/June 14 (US)\n\nEpisode 8 'Empire of Death' – June 22 (UK)/June 21 (US)"
