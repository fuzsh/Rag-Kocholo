France also was a signer of Emile Zola’s manifesto which defended Alfred Dreyfus, a Jewish soldier falsely accused of espionage. He wrote about the Dreyfus Affair in his novel Monsieur Bergeret (1901). He was a member of the Academie Francaise and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921.\n\nHandsomely framed with original transmittal envelope showing the monogrammed silver wax seal of Anatole France and an image of the journalist. Overall: 13 ¼” x 15 ¾”. Item #A01425"
