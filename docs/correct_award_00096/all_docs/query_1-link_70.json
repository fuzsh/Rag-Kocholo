        "text": "AKA Jacques Anatole François Thibault\n\nBorn: 16-Apr-1844\n\nBirthplace: Paris, France\n\nDied: 13-Oct-1924\n\nLocation of death: Saint-Cyr-sur-Loire, France\n\nCause of death: unspecified\n\nRemains: Buried, Cimetière de Neuilly-sur-Seine, Neuilly-sur-Seine, France\n\nGender: Male\n\nReligion: Atheist\n\nRace or Ethnicity: White\n\nSexual orientation: Straight\n\nOccupation: Novelist, Playwright\n\nNationality: France\n\nExecutive summary: French novelist\n\nMilitary service: French Army (1871)\n\nFrench novelist, critic, skeptic and satirist Anatole France attended a Catholic school, where he learned to hate the church. Mocking all things Catholic became a running subtext in his work. His father ran a bookstore, and France (a pseudonym; his birth name was Jacques Anatole François Thibault) got his education prowling the shop's shelves, devouring book after book. He briefly attended university at École Nationale des Chartes, and before his writing became popular enough to support him, he worked more than a decade as an assistant librarian to the French Senate.\n\nWith Émile Zola he came to the defense of Alfred Dreyfus, falsely accused in an infamous French scandal which emerged again in the author's best known book, Penguin Island. His novel The Red Lily contains perhaps his most oft-quoted line, translated into English as \"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and to steal bread.\"\n\nIn the last years of his life, all his works were listed in the Roman Catholic Church's Index of Forbidden Books. His novels were popular both in and beyond his native nation, earning accolades including the 1921 Nobel Prize, and at his death in 1924, Time magazine described him as \"perhaps the best-known and most highly respected literary artist in the world\".\n\nFather: Francois Noel Thibault (bookseller)\n\nMother: Antoinette Galas\n\nWife: Valerie Guerin de Sauville (m. 1877, div. 1893)\n\nDaughter: Suzanne (b. 1881, d. 1917)\n\nMistress: Madame Armand de Caillavet (twenty-five year relationship, d. 1910)\n\nWife: Emma Laprevotte (housekeeper, m. 1920)\n\nHigh School: Collège Stanislas, Paris\n\nUniversity: École Nationale des Chartes, Paris (attended)\n\nNobel Prize for Literature 1921\n\nFrench Official Ass't Librarian for the French Senate (1876-90)\n\nFrench Academy 1896\n\nFrench National Association of Freethinkers\n\nInternational PEN\n\nDreyfus Affair\n\nFrench Ancestry\n\nAuthor of books:\n\nAlfred de Vigny (1869, non-fiction)\n\nThe Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard (1881, novel)\n\nLe Château de Vaux-le-Vicomte (1888, non-fiction)\n\nBalthasar (1889, short stories)\n\nThais (1889, novel)\n\nThe Queen Pédauque (1893, novel)\n\nThe Opinions of Jerome Coignard (1893, novel)\n\nThe Red Lily (1894, novel)\n\nThe Well of Saint Claire (1895, novel)\n\nThe Garden of Epicurus (1895, aphorisms)\n\nContemporary History (1896, novel; four volumes)\n\nThe White Stone (1903, novel)\n\nPenguin Island (1905, novel)\n\nThe Church and the Republic (1905, non-fiction)\n\nThe Life of Joan of Arc (1908, biography)\n\nRabelais (1909, novel)\n\nThe Gods are Athirst (1912, novel)\n\nMy Friend's Book (1913, novel)\n\nLe Génie Latin (1913, non-fiction)\n\nThe Revolt of the Angels (1914, novel)\n\nThe Human Tragedy (1917, novel)\n\nThe Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard (1918, novel)\n\nAt the Sign of the Reine Pedauque (1919, novel)\n\nThe Bloom of Life (1923, novel)\n\nPierre Noziere (1923, novel)\n\nWrote plays:\n\nAu Petit Bonheur (1898)\n\nCrainquebille (1903)\n\nLa Comédie de Celui qui Épousa une Femme Muette (1908)\n\nLe Mannequin D'osier (1928)\n\nNew!\n\nNNDB MAPPER Create a map starting with Anatole France\n\nRequires Flash 7+ and Javascript.\n\nDo you know something we don't?\n\nSubmit a correction or make a comment about this profile"
