Some maybe earlier. Seems plausible that they were commemorative collectibles and manufactured after the awards were issued. I couple that I have seen were victims of cell rot, so that's something to be aware of and prepared for.\n\nI have seen a number of the Nobel Prise razors over the years, I always guessed they were from 50s/60s.

As far as I know there is no remedy for it other than to replace the scales.\n\nI have searched the net for information on Nobel Preis razors but I can't find anything.\n\nBtw, what do you mean by \"cell rot\"?\n\nWe do read English here in Sweden, but I don't understand everything LOL\n\nIf you google search for cell rot or scale rot or celluloid outgassing youâ€™ll probable get well over a dozen hits. Maybe try the B&B search engine too.\n\nBasically, the pladtic breaks down, creating an acid that dedtroys the blade."
