        "text": "(1844–1924). Jacques Anatole Thibault, best known as Anatole France, dominated French literature for a half century. He was primarily a novelist, but he excelled also in the short story and in literary criticism. His stories still charm readers with their irony and clear graceful style.\n\nAnatole France was born in Paris on April 16, 1844. The pen name “France” that he adopted was his father’s nickname, which is a shortened form of François. His father, who had acquired a love of books while in military service, was a bookseller in Paris.\n\nAnatole was an only child, and his gentle mother was devoted to him. His only contact with the outside world was in the long walks he took with his governess. When he was finally sent to school, at the Collége Stanislas, he did not like it; but he said he was saved by his gift of seeing the comic side of things. He acquired most of his education browsing in his father’s book shop, where men gathered to discuss books.\n\nFrance published little until he met Arman de Caillavet in 1883. Her salon was a center of literary life, and she was clever and stimulating. She convinced France to write, and his lively entertaining tales soon won for him a wide audience. In 1896 he was elected to the French Academy.\n\nUp to this time France had been a genial skeptic. He respected beauty and intelligence, but he believed in nothing and regarded himself as a mere spectator of life. A change came in 1898 when the French novelist Émile Zola published his famous letter “J’Accuse” in support of Alfred Dreyfus, the innocent Jew who had been imprisoned on Devil’s Island by a prejudiced court (see Zola). France at once threw himself into the fight to save Dreyfus. Soon France became active also in the Socialist party. His conservative friends abandoned him as he began to attack with bitter irony both the church and the state.\n\nIn 1921 France won the Nobel prize for literature. He died on Oct. 12, 1924, at his home near Tours.\n\nFrance’s best novel, The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, was published in 1881. Penguin Island, a satirical history of man, was published in 1908."
