A fine impression in fine condition with full margins.\n\nExhibited: Salon de la Société Nationale, 1907.\n\nAnatole France was a writer, critic, and one of the major figures of French literature in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921. France’s skepticism appears already in his early works, but later the hostility toward bourgeois values led him to support French Communist Party. In the 1920 his writings were put on the Index of Forbidden Books of the Roman Catholic Church."
