        "text": "The Works of Anatole France.\n\nFRANCE, Anatole.\n\nItem Number: 71009\n\nNew York: Gabriel Wells, 1924.\n\nFinely bound set of the Works of Anatole France. Octavo, 30 volumes, bound in full elaborate gold-tooled morocco, gilt topstain, extra-illustrated throughout with original watercolors on the text leaves, each signed “WHD,” set number 94 of 575 signed on the limitation page by Anatole France. In near fine condition. A stunning example.\n\nAnatole France was a French poet, journalist, and novelist. He was a successful novelist, with several best-sellers. Ironic and skeptical, he was considered the ideal French man of letters. He was a member of the Académie française, and won the 1921 Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament\". France is also widely believed to be the model for narrator Marcel's literary idol Bergotte in Marcel Proust's In Search of Lost Time."
