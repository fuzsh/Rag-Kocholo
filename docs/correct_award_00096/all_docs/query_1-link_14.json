He intervened on behalf of the Armenians in Rome, London, Geneva and Paris, making inflammatory speeches against Ottoman Empire's despotic and nationalistic tendencies.\n\nIn 1916, in the aftermath of the Armenian genocide, during the great demonstration \"Homage à l'Armenie\" organised at the Sorbona, Anatole France shouted to the crowd \"Armenia Is Dying but Will Be Born Again!\"."
