        "text": "Penguin Island by Anatole France (1938)\n\nSandglass Number Unknown\n\nArtwork: Illustrations in water-colors by Sylvain Sauvage\n\nTranslated by A.W. Evans\n\nHeritage Press Exclusive\n\nClick images for a larger view.\n\nBinding and Spine – Anatole France received quite a smattering of attention from the George Macy Company, way more than he receives today (a shame!). Penguin Island was the one work of France’s that Macy produced twice. I discuss France’s LEC and Heritage editions in my earlier Revolt of the Angels post.\n\nThanks to Django6924, I am able to share with you the original Heritage exclusive that predates the later LEC release. In 1938 Macy recruited Sylvain Sauvage [no stranger to the books of France, as he did two LEC’s of his before this one, At the Sign of the Queen Pedauque (1933) and The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard (1937)] to produce this lovely edition of what is probably France’s best known work. Sauvage has popped up here before for his amazing work on Zadig and more, and I’m happy to have him make another appearance. I covered his career in the aforementioned post, so we’ll just jump into this book’s specifics. Early Heritage books tended to have production details, and this one is such a book, so I’ll plop that down for some minimal design details:\n\nSince I initially wrote this post, fellow George Macy Devotee featherwate submitted to me information from Michael Bussacco’s book on the Heritage Press, which I will paste below:\n\nI don’t have a Sandglass with my copy of the HP Penguin Island, but here are some of the technical details taken from Bussacco’s Sandglass Companion:\n\nType: Granjon was chosen for being both dignified and unobtrusive – (Sandglass: “dignity is required in the setting of a satiric novel”) – and its size is 14 pt. The paper, made by the Worthy Paper Company, resembles the paper used for the HP Romeo and Juliet and is guaranteed to last for at least two centuries!\n\nIllustrations: Ten full-page water-colour pictures, reproduced to the exact size of Sauvage’s original paintings by Ralph M. Duenewald of New York, who was also responsible for printing Sauvage’s illustrations for the LEC Cyrano and Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard. BTW, “The navigation of Saint Mael” is on page 34, and “Then she went away…” on page 60.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of the book is its binding. First the bad news: it’s not leather. In the words of the Sandglass, the sheets are encased in “heavy boards over which the binder has worked a material from the factories of E.I Du Pont de Nemours Company. It is a material of which the surface is treated with pyroxolin. It will last longer than most book cloths, far longer than most cheap leathers, not quite so long as expensive leathers that are used in the binding of a hundred dollar books.\n\nThe material is dyed black. Its surface is treated with leather graining. This is just rank imitation. We would much prefer to use the original goatskin which this graining imitates!”. (Would have been too expensive.)\n\nNot mentioned in the Sandglass is the origin of pyroxolin (or more properly, I think, pyroxylin, though there was a New Zealand racehorse called Pyroxolin in the 1890s). It has been around since 1868, when Albany printer and inventor John Wesley Hyatt gave the name to a blend of nitrocellulose and the plasticiser camphor (sap from the laurel tree) which produced a durable, colourful, and mouldable thermoplastic. It is still used today by specialist bookbinders and conservators. Riley, Dunn & Wilson, for example, make solander boxes with a covering of pyroxolin[sic]-impregnated light-fast, moisture- and vermin-resistant library buckram. As a non-scientist I find it slightly worrying that pyroxylin appears to be essentially the same thing as gun-cotton and the notoriously inflammable nitrate base used for early film stock. Not much point in having a 200 year guarantee for the paper if the binding is liable to sudden spontaneous combustion! Another reason to keep one’s books out of direct sunlight…\n\nSo, the book is bound in a material similar to gun cotton? That’s fascinating…and scary! Definitely keep it out of the sun or away from any other heat source! Anyway, the book’s front binding has a lovely embossing:\n\nThat’s all I can give you for now, but I’ll refresh this post when I find out more.\n\nTitle Page – A.W. Evans was the translator for Penguin Island, and there is no introduction whatsoever. Sauvage’s art is a great fit from what I can tell.\n\nChapter IV – As I do not own this, I do not know the specific page numbers. I’ll update this once I know. This is incredible art, that it is.\n\nExample Illustration – More mastery. I still need this.\n\nExtra special thanks to Django6924 for the images and featherwate for the info from Bussacco!\n\nPenguin Island by Anatole France (1947)\n\nLEC #181/17th Series V. 7 in 1947\n\nArtwork: Drawings by Malcolm Cameron\n\nTranslated by A.W. Evans, Introduced by Carl Van Doren\n\nLEC #1288 of 1950. Heritage Press Reprint available.\n\nFront Binding – For the second issuing of France’s seminal work, the Limited Editions Club issued their own take on Penguin Island. This was one of the winning entries for the LEC’s “Third Competition in Book Illustration”, which the Sandglass below gets into the minor details of on Page 2 (Macy says he doesn’t want to bore people with it yet again, and then explains it all anyway). Malcolm Cameron’s drawings won over the judges and netted him one of the five first prizes, and thus the LEC had its own Penguin Island to crow about. Cameron would do one other book for the George Macy Company, “Jack and the Beanstalk”, which was released in The Evergreen Tales in 1952 as the final set (alas, the one I’m still missing). Cameron was actually an architect by trade, dabbling with his artwork as a side project. Upon winning, he gave up his old career (the Sandglass wondered if his netting the prize had anything to do with it) and committed to being an illustrator full time. Blog commenter Tom Lessup dug up some personal info on Cameron back on the original post:\n\nMalcolm Cameron, printmaker, illustrator and architect\n\nBorn in Redlands, CA on Sept. 2, 1902, Attended the California Institute of Technology and Cornell University. He apprenticed in an architectural office in NYC in 1927-28 and then moved to Los Angeles. In 1945 he settled in Bonsall, CA and lived there until moving to Shaw Island, WA in 1962. He died there in March 8, 1975. Illustrated books such as “Penguin Island” by Anatole France and “Notre Dame de Paris” by Victor Hugo.\n\nExhibitions: Oakland Art Gallery, 1939; GGIE*, 1940. In: Library of Congress.\n\nSource: Edan Hughes, “Artists in California, 1786-1940″\n\n*Golden Gate International Exposition\n\nSometimes confused with Australian painter/printmaker of the same name, born 1934\n\nMassive thanks for elaborating on Mr. Cameron’s career for us, Mr. Lessup. :)\n\nDesign Notes: Joseph Blumenthal was the designer of this edition, who also had personally designed the font chosen for the work, Emerson (named after his printing of Ralph Waldo Emerson’s Essay on Nature). Designer buffs will want to peruse the Sandglass below, as it goes into Mr. Blumenthal’s career in very extensive depth. As for the Quarto:\n\nSpine\n\nSlipcase\n\nTitle Page – A.W. Evans’ translation made the leap from the Sauvage edition. Carl Van Doren supplies this printing with an Introduction. A lovely title page, this one. I like it a little more than the Sauvage edition.\n\nColophon – This is #1023 of 1500, and was signed by Cameron.\n\nExamples of Cameron’s illustrations (right click and open in new tab for full size):\n\nPersonal Notes – Devotee NYCFAddict sold this one to me as a larger lot, and I’m happy to have it along with the other excellent Anatole France LECs! Just need Crainquebille now!\n\nPenguin Island by Anatole France (1947)\n\nSandglass Number 15K\n\nArtwork: Drawings by Malcolm Cameron\n\nTranslated by A.W. Evans, Introduced by Carl Van Doren\n\nReprint of LEC #181, 17th Series, V. 7 in 1947.\n\nFront Binding – The Heritage edition has its own unique binding, loses the light blue flourishes in the text, but is otherwise fairly close to the LEC original. France’s text and Cameron’s drawings were reproduced through electroplates and photographs, respectively. The Photogravure and Color Company handled Cameron’s side of the equation. Blumenthal was the designer of this edition, as well. The Stratford Press handled the printing of the text. The bindery is suspiciously absent, but it was likely Russell and Rutter as was the norm at this stage of the Club’s history.\n\nSlipcase\n\nTitle Page – More or less the same as the LEC, but without the blue flourish.\n\nBook 1: The Beginnings\n\nPage 30\n\nPersonal Notes – I got this at Bookbuyers in Monterey as part of a trade-in. Now that I have the LEC, I traded it in as well. I’d like to own Sauvage’s edition someday, which would give me three versions of this work (I also have an early Dodd, Mead edition with Frank C. Pape’s artwork, and that is also exquisite!).\n\nSandglass:\n\nUpdated on 10/9/22 by JF\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard by Anatole France (1937)\n\nLEC #96/9th Series V. 1 in 1937\n\nArtwork: Illustrations by Sylvain Sauvage\n\nTranslated by Lafcidio Hearn, Introduced by A.S.W. Rosenbach\n\nLEC #278 of 1500. LEC Exclusive.\n\nClick images to see larger views.\n\nFront Binding – Sylvain Sauvage’s trilogy of similarly designed LEC editions comes to its conclusion with Anatole France’s The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, following At the Sign of the Queen Pedauque and Cyrano de Bergerac. France and Sauvage would reconnect one last time for the Heritage Press with an exquisite exclusive of Penguin Island (a book I still need to add to my collection!) in 1938. Both author and artist have been extensively covered here on the blog, with Revolt of the Angels and Zadig respectively covering their bibliographies for the two Clubs.\n\nThat being said, this is one of France’s more realistic and grounded works in contrast to the fantastical Penguin Island and The Revolt of the Angels. This could be due to it being his first published novel in 1881 following a writing career as a poet. The book follows its titular protagonist, a historian and professor, as he tracks down a rare tome of the French translation of The Golden Legend, a collection of biographies of various saints written by Jacobus de Varagine in the late medieval period (this is where “St. George and the Dragon” comes from, for instance). In the process of finding this work, Bonnard meets Jeanne, the granddaughter of a woman he knew and loved earlier in life. Jeanne is currently under the care of an abusive guardian, so Bonnard hides her away to protect her and in the process a love story forms between her and one of Bonnard’s students, Henri Gells.\n\nGeorge Macy (and Helen Macy, for that matter) seemed to greatly enjoy France’s work, as three more LECs would follow (without Sauvage) — Penguin Island in 1947 with Malcolm Cameron’s illustrations, Crainquebille in 1949 featuring art from Bernard Lamotte, and The Revolt of the Angels in 1953 republishing Pierre Watrin’s commission from Calmann-Levy. The Heritage Press would follow along in the admiration by doing their own aforementioned 1938 Penguin Island as well as The Gods are A-Thirst in 1942 with Jean Oberlé’s artistic sensibilities for its French Great Romances series. It’s among the easier ways to acquire France’s work in English these days, as the Heritage Press reprinted everything after Crime from the LEC as well.\n\nDesign Notes – Edward Alonzo Miller of the Marchbanks Press was handed the last of these Sauvage editions to design, of which he kept up the general aesthetic quite well with providing a few of his own unique touches.\n\nBack Binding\n\nSpine\n\nSlipcase\n\nTitle Page – Lafcadio Hearn handled translation duties for Crime. Well known for his folklore collection Kwaidan: Stories and Studies of Strange Things, he performed this translation in 1890 for Harper and Brothers. A.S.W. Rosenbach provides an introduction.\n\nColophon – This is #278 of 1500, and was signed by Sauvage.\n\nExamples of Sauvage’s illustrations (right click and open in new tab for full size):\n\nPersonal Notes – I picked this up at the same time I received Queen Pedauque from an online order at Powell’s. As a big fan of both France and Sauvage I needed these! While the slipcase is a little banged up, the book is nearly perfect and I will be trying to sit down to read this later in the year!\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAt the Sign of the Queen Pedauque by Anatole France (1933)\n\nLEC #49/5th Series V. 1 in 1933\n\nArtwork: Illustrations by Sylvain Sauvage\n\nIntroduction by Ernest Boyd, translated by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson\n\nLEC #278 of 1500. LEC exclusive.\n\nClick images to see larger views.\n\nFront Binding – This month’s post brings two familiar faces together — the French Nobel Prize for Literature winner Anatole France and distinguished French illustrator Sylvain Sauvage — for the first time for both in the Limited Editions Club! France, of course, has had The Revolt of the Angels, Penguin Island and The Gods Are A-Thirst covered here on the blog, as well as being the star of one of my Video Series! I’ve even done a special non-Macy post on a couple of his books! He is one of my favorite fiction authors, and I hope to dig into this particular book, At the Sign of the Queen Pedauque, sometime in the near future. We’ve covered his publication history for Macy’s clubs in The Revolt of the Angels.\n\nSauvag, meanwhile, has had MANY a book covered here already: Zadig, The Physiology of Taste, Penguin Island (Heritage), Cyrano de Bergerac, and his Evergreen Tales contribution “The Sleeping Beauty“, and with this and the upcoming post later this year on The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard, we’re close to covering his entire LEC production (only his Shakespeare, As You Like It, remains outside of my collection at present), although I do have two Heritage exclusives to pick up still, Romeo and Juliet and Candide. This is the second SIGNED LEC of Sauvage’s I get to feature, as he had so many titles in the pipeline that didn’t make it out before his death in 1948. And this is a mighty strong debut for the acclaimed artist!\n\nDesign Notes – William A. Kittredge designed this volume, which would go on to influence the designs of the aforementioned Cyrano and Crime, even though Kittredge had no involvement with either. The Quarto has this to say about this book:\n\nThere’s also a nice motif on the back of the book which I’ve included below.\n\nSpine\n\nSlipcase\n\nBack Binding\n\nTitle Page – Ernest Boyd contributes an introduction, and the LEC utilized Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson’s translation for this book; she was a popular choice for France translations in the early 20th century, and she would return for Revolt. This is a super classy title page, by the by.\n\nColophon – This is #278 of 1500, and was signed by Sauvage.\n\nExamples of Sauvage’s illustrations (right click and open in new tab for full size):\n\nPersonal Notes – This came to me from Powell’s Books in Portland, Oregon via an online order from last year. Getting this was an absolute delight because the Anatole France/Sylvain Sauvage books were VERY high on my wishlist for some time. So HAPPY to have them.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Revolt of the Angels by Anatole France (1953)\n\nLEC #239/22nd Series, V. 7\n\nSandglass Number I:19\n\nArtwork: Etchings by Pierre Watrin\n\nIntroduced by Desmond MacCarthy, and translated by Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson\n\n#1431 of 1500\n\nHeritage Press reprinted this edition, both compared below.\n\nClick images to see larger views.\n\nFront Binding – Today brings an older post back from 2011, The Revolt of the Angels by Anatole France. Having come across the LEC edition, it’s time to finally compare the Heritage against it to see how they stack up. One thing you’ll notice is that the LEC (right) is slightly larger than the Heritage edition (left). It’s not a huge difference, but it is enough of one that it does impact the interior of the Heritage reprint, which we’ll get to.\n\nLet’s discuss the author for a moment. Anatole France, the satirical French author who you see all too little reprinting of these days, is the subject of today’s post. The Revolt of the Angels was the last one printed by the Limited Editions Club, following At the Sign of the Queen Pedauque (1933), The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard (1937), Penguin Island (1947), and Crainquebille (1949). The first two were illustrated by Sylvain Sauvage (who would also do a special Penguin Island for the Heritage Press, among several others), while Malcolm Cameron and Bernard Lamotte supplied illustrations for the last two, respectively. The Heritage Press also did another of his works, The Gods are a-Thrist for the Heritage French Romances line. Django6924 has this to add about France’s popularity within the Macy Companies:\n\nIt is interesting that the Macy companies gave so much attention to Anatole France, who, though a Nobel Prize winner, was certainly not in the upper echelon. Five of his novels found representation in the LEC and one additional Heritage Press only edition of The Gods are a-thirst. This puts him ahead of Thomas Hardy, one of the better represented English novelists (Conrad eventually pulled ahead of France, but a majority of his works were printed after Macy’s tenure–during the time George Macy was in charge, only Dickens was better represented among novelists.)\n\nThis particular book has a bit of interesting history to it, as the Club was wanting to publish a fine edition, but were not receiving sample illustrations that they felt matched the book’s spirit. In fact, they go on record saying that they were “disappointed with these sample drawings”. While in Paris, France’s (the author, not the country) original publisher, Calmann-Levy, was about to unleash their own collector’s edition of Revolt, with etchings done by Sauvage protege Pierre Watrin. Watrin’s work fit the Club’s imagining of their book so perfectly that they gained reprinting rights for the art, and had them reproduced via gravures.\n\nThis was Watrin’s only work for the LEC, which was, as mentioned above, not unique to it. Blog commenter and fellow Macy Devotee featherwate had plenty to say about Watrin’s career following this book:\n\nWhat the Sandglass doesn’t reveal is that during the seven years that elapsed between Watrin’s etchings appearing in the Calmann-Levy limited edition of the Revolt (1946) and their re-appearance in the LEC/HP editions of 1953, the artist himself seems to have largely abandoned serious book illustration to become an animation artist (and later director). He worked on one of the most famous of French cartoon features, Le Roi et L’Oiseau [English title: The King and the Mocking Bird], which began production in 1948 and was finally completed in – wait for it! – 1980; the delay was caused by studio bankruptcy and arguments over rights. The best-known of his other films is The Twelve Tasks of Asterix (1976), which he co-directed with Asterix’s creators Goscinny and Uderzo.\n\nIt was an interesting change of career for someone who was a star pupil of Sylvain Sauvage and according to the Sandglass had in only eight years established a high reputation as an illustrator and theatre designer. I have to say that most of the few illustrations of his I have found reproduced on the internet are pretty mundane compared to his etchings for Revolt: bread-and-butter pictures in children’s books and strip-cartoon histories of various French provinces (and let’s not overlook Space Mission Health Hygéa 7, a bizarre-sounding medical guide for teenagers[?] issued by the French government).\n\nAt http://www.flickr.com/photos/62235807@N02/ I’ve posted a still from Le Roi; the film is in colour but this b&w portrait hanging on a wall seems to have the same graphic wit as Watrin’s etchings for Revolt. I like to think of it as his work.\n\nAnd I’m sure that’s more than you ever wanted to know about the life and work of Pierre Watrin!\n\nDesign Notes – Saul and Lillian Marks handled design and publishing duties for the LEC edition via their Plantin Press, while Ferris Printing Company produced the Heritage edition. Django6924 had this to say about the Marks:\n\nThe Revolt of the Angels was another production from Saul and Lillian Mark’s Plantin Press in Los Angeles…In the Monthly Letter on another of the several books from Plantin, Macy wrote that the presswork “was the finest since John Henry Nash went to his reward.” This was the ultimate in praise, as Macy felt that for quality, Nash was unmatched by any printer alive.\n\nThe LEC edition has the following particulars (per the Quatro-Millenary:\n\nThe LEC’s silk-finish cloth appears to be of sterner stuff than the binding material for the Heritage; the boards are covered in a “silky material of a midnight-blue color” according to the Sandglass, but the ink that stained it is incredibly sensitive to fading in the sun, as I’ve seen at least five different copies all afflicted with a grayed, dull spine. Shame, too, as it’s otherwise a nice book. Both feature a sword adorned with angel wings stamped into the front boards in silver leaf, shared with the spine.\n\nThe Heritage had its gravures handled by the Photogravure and Color Company in New York, like its LEC forebear. Paper was supplied by the International Paper Company. Russell-Rutter handled the binding of this version.\n\nSpines – The Heritage is on top, and demonstrates how badly the fabric tends to sun for this edition. In contrast, the LEC is a vibrant blue.\n\nSlipcase\n\nTitle Page – Mrs. Wilfrid Jackson, who spent much of her time translating the works of France it would seem from a quick Googling, seems the right person for the job translating this work. Desmond MacCarthy serves up an Introduction.\n\nColophon – This LEC is #1431 of 1500. Watrin did not provide his signature, probably due to the several year gap in releases and the fact Macy did not commission him specifically to do this book.\n\nThere isn’t much difference between the production quality of the two editions internally beyond two key things: the paper in the LEC feels higher quality between your fingers, and the text is slightly compressed in the Heritage. An example of this can be seen below:\n\nPage 23 – The top is the Heritage, the bottom is the LEC. The Heritage’s font is a tad denser, while the LEC has a thinner crispness to it. The illustrations are well copied, considering the same company handled both editions on that front (and both were photogravures in the first place).\n\nAs for the art, the LEC was wise to gain the rights to reprinting Watrin’s work, as he has a distinct style that seems to work well.\n\nPage 30 (Heritage) – There’s some in-text art as well.\n\nPage 83 (Heritage top, LEC bottom)\n\nPage 103 (LEC)\n\nPersonal Notes – This is one of the most common Heritage Press books I’ve seen, as least where I used to live. Two of my old bookshop gigs had one, I bought this documented one at a local library sale…it’s sort of bizarre how often I used to see this. I also have spotted it in the Bay Area a lot.\n\nCompared to France’s other books (which are rarer for me to find), Revolt seems to follow me around. :p I bought the copy I have now at Second Time Around in Merced (the last shop I worked at), which had a slipcase and was generally a nicer condition. Since the initial writing of this post I’ve gotten the LEC of this one as well as the aforementioned Gods Are A-Thrist, and snagging the rest of France’s LEC and Heritage output is high on my list to acquire!\n\nI also happen to have a delightful Penguin Island and The Revolt of the Angels printing by Dodd, Mead in the late 1920’s that is illustrated wonderfully by Frank C. Pape. He did a series of France’s work for that publisher following France’s Nobel Prize win. Unfortunately, Pape never collaborated with the George Macy Company.\n\nAnother interesting thing that happened with this book for me is the inclusion of a second Sandglass, for the Heritage Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll, a book I have never laid eyes on (and not for lack of trying!). It is some relief to know that if I ever do stumble upon one I won’t need it to have a Sandglass inside it as a determining factor (although I’d probably buy it on the spot considering how scarce it is). Curiously, the second copy I bought had a Sandglass for Washington Irving’s History of New York if I remember correctly. So, look inside copies of Revolt for unexpected Sandglasses!\n\nSandglass:\n\nUpdated 8/18/2019 JF\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
