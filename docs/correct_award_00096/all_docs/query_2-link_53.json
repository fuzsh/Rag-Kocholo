He was a member of the Académie française, and won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Literature \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament\".\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatole_France\n\nPublished march twenty fifth, nineteen hundred and eight.
