Let me know if you are interested\n\nAlready December!\n\nI have decided to join Lynn in her Countdown to 2024. Click on the link to check her daily prompts and join us.\n\nSo this has been a busy posting week:\n\nThursday: November wrap up\n\nFriday: Countdown to 2024: Day 1\n\nFriday: The top 7 books to read in December 2023\n\nSaturday: Countdown to 2024: Day 2\n\nSaturday: 6 degrees of separation: from a kitchen to a bot\n\nAnd I finished two books this week:\n\nJUST READ / LISTENED TO 🎧\n\n📚 L’Oiseau bleu,\n\nby Maurice MaeterlinckPlay/Fantasy\n\n1905\n\n198 pages\n\nThe book is available in English as\n\nThe Blue Bird: A Fairy Play in Six Acts\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nWow, I really had no idea what this was going to be!\n\nOriginally, I even thought it was a novella, then discovered it’s a play. And what a play!\n\nIt’s so rich with so many themes, around the idea of happiness and how two poor children were led to find it.\n\nThe text is so rich, with even amazing beautiful words just to describe the settings.\n\nThere’s also a lot of humor.\n\nThere are deeper, even theological themes, like when the children meet the souls of animals and trees.\n\nI can’t even imagine how difficult this must be to produce this play.\n\nI know it also exists as a movie and am going to try to watch it.\n\nWith our modern technology, it would be an awesome book to turn into an animated movie!\n\nNo wonder the author won the Nobel Prize in literature. I definitely want t read more by him.\n\n🎧 Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris\n\nby Graham Robb, Nonfiction/History/France\n\n2010 496 pages / 14 H\n\nNarrated by Simon Vance\n\nRead for #NonficNov\n\nI as so impressed by The Discovery of France: A Historical Geography, that I decided to listen right away to the author’s book on Paris, especially when I realized the copy available through my Public Library and Hoopla was narrated by Simon Vance!\n\nLet’s first get the narrator out of the way. Simon Vance went down from the pedestal I had put him on. As a professional narrator, I’m appalled he didn’t take time to check the pronunciation of famous places in Paris, for instance.\n\nAt the beginning, I thought he was doing well, avoiding to pronounce the final consonant, as we usually do in French, but then here came Le Champ de Mars. This one is an exception, and we do pronounce the final -s here. Well, I’m tired of hearing “le Champ de “marr”! Seriously, professional narrators, please do your homework.\n\nAnd worse came. He doesn’t even know how to pronounce the name of the French President Giscard d’Estaing!\n\nBUT the book in itself is fabulous!\n\nIt’s different from Robb’s other book, in the sense that this one does not offer a systematic nor chronological history of Paris.\n\nInstead, it’s a series of (long) vignettes on important people, whose destiny is connected with Paris.\n\nI like his choice of people and how through them he highlights an aspect of Paris or another.\n\nAnd this man can write! Each chapter feels like a short novel. Brilliant rendering of facts too. Highly recommended.\n\nCURRENTLY READING / LISTENING TO\n\nHighlighting here only a couple:\n\n📚 Les dieux ont soif,\n\nby Anatole France\n\nHistorical fiction\n\n1912\n\n310 pages\n\nThe book is available in English as\n\nThe Gods Will Have Blood\n\nAm reading with French student E.\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nClick on the cover to access the English synopsis\n\nI had meant to read this historical novel on the aftermath of the French Revolution.\n\nSo far (25%), it’s not as exciting as I thought.\n\nThere’s more romance than I expected, and 1912 romance is not better than 2023! That part of the book has not aged well.\n\nBut still, I enjoy the description of characters and the settings. It’s actually a nice way to see how the French Revolution was impacting the population on a daily basis. There are a lot of little details related to that.\n\nI was considering DNFing it, but my student was interested in persevering, so I am doing. And looks like events are going to start moving.\n\n“It is April 1793 and the final power struggle of the French Revolution is taking hold: the aristocrats are dead and the poor are fighting for bread in the streets.\n\nIn a Paris swept by fear and hunger lives Gamelin, a revolutionary young artist appointed magistrate, and given the power of life and death over the citizens of France. But his intense idealism and unbridled single-mindedness drive him inexorably towards catastrophe.\n\nPublished in 1912, The Gods Will Have Blood is a breathtaking story of the dangers of fanaticism, with its depiction of the violence and devastation of the Reign of Terror.”\n\n📚 Continuum:\n\nFrench Science Fiction Short Stories,\n\nedited by Annabelle Dolidon with Tessa Sermet To be published by Ooligan Press\n\non April 9, 2024\n\n368 pages\n\nReceived for review, through Edelweiss\n\nReading for #ScFiMonth 2023\n\nI have read half of the stories so far, and I’m quite impressed by almost all of them.\n\nI’m also shocked I had never heard of these authors – they are not all French, but they did in French.\n\nVery impressive collection. If you enjoy scifi, go for it, it’s on Edelweiss.\n\n“Classic French science fiction short stories translated into English for the first time.\n\nThis unique collection of newly translated short stories offers a taste of classic and contemporary French science fiction to English-language readers. These stories cover a range of fascinating topics including simulated reality, speciesism, ecology, and transhumanism—all while exploring universal themes of belonging, death, and identity.\n\nSome of the authors featured in this anthology, like Julia Verlanger, Sylvie Denis, or Jean-Claude Dunyach, have shaped the history of French science fiction after World War II.\n\nCurated by Annabelle Dolidon and Tessa Sermet, French language and literature professors who share a love for the genre, these nine stories showcase some of the brilliant mid-to late twentieth and twenty-first century French contributions to science fiction.\n\nDolidon and Sermet provide illuminating expansions that accompany each tale and fascinating insights into the evolution of French and American science fiction. The discussion opportunities are also a wonderful resource for teachers and students of French literature and French culture as well as English and comparative literature. This anthology is a great opportunity to discover French sci-fi in English translation for fans or readers new to the genre.”\n\n📚 D’entre les morts/Sueurs froides,\n\nby Boileau-Narcejac Mystery/Noir\n\n1954\n\n192 pages\n\nReading with French student F.\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nI can’t believe I waited so many years before discovering the impressive writing duo Boileau-Narcejac – Pierre Boileau (28 April 1906 – 16 January 1989) and Pierre Ayraud, also known as Thomas Narcejac (3 July 1908 – 7 June 1998).\n\nTheir bibliography is shockingly huge.\n\nMy student F. and I were so impressed by She Who Was No More, that we decided to read another right away. Like the previous, and like many other novels by the pair, the book was made into a movie: the famous Vertigo.\n\nThey renamed the book in French after the movie, hence the two titles.\n\nI so enjoy their writing. And the book has so many more layers than the movie, for instance there’s a lot about the approaching WWII, and the authors play a lot on how the main character interacts with the war and with his other life problems!\n\nI don’t think this dimension is present in the movie.\n\n🎧 System Collapse (The Murderbot Diaries, #7)by Martha Wells, scifi\n\nNovember 13, 2023 245 pages / 6H36\n\nNarrated by Kevin R. Free\n\nThis series was a big 2023 discovery for me.\n\nI binged on it all, and I was excited to find the audio through my public library and Libby (though I expected it on Hoopla, where I listened to the first 6 books!)\n\nThis is a really good one, with a lot of suspense, and the same ambiance as the first book in the series.\n\nKevin R. Free is the perfect narrator for Murderbot’s character and mindset!\n\n“Everyone’s favorite lethal SecUnit is back.\n\nFollowing the events in Network Effect, the Barish-Estranza corporation has sent rescue ships to a newly-colonized planet in peril, as well as additional SecUnits. But if there’s an ethical corporation out there, Murderbot has yet to find it, and if Barish-Estranza can’t have the planet, they’re sure as hell not leaving without something. If that something just happens to be an entire colony of humans, well, a free workforce is a decent runner-up prize.\n\nBut there’s something wrong with Murderbot; it isn’t running within normal operational parameters. ART’s crew and the humans from Preservation are doing everything they can to protect the colonists, but with Barish-Estranza’s SecUnit-heavy persuasion teams, they’re going to have to hope Murderbot figures out what’s wrong with itself, and fast.\n\nYeah, this plan is… not going to work.”\n\nBOOK UP NEXT\n\n📚 2040,\n\nby Robert Albo\n\nNov 30, 2023\n\n422 pages\n\nReceived for review\n\nChange of plans…\n\nI was offered this book, presented as a new ebook for January 2024. Somehow, not sure why, I didn’t seem to find it online.\n\nI finally did, AFTER I had said yes. Well, the book is already in print, and it’s over 420 pages!\n\nNot my comfort zone for a brand new to me author…\n\nI feel I have been tricked, but hopefully this is a great book.\n\n“In 2040, advanced technology has transformed daily life, yet many social ills remain.\n\nAt 40, Michael faces a choice: remain in Boston, tethered to uninspiring government programs, or forge a fresh path. Embracing the latter, he relocates to Berkeley to join his twin brother in his groundbreaking research into dark matter.\n\nCould this elusive, intangible substance, rumored to permeate the universe, also reside within the human brain, holding the key to the mysteries of consciousness?\n\nWhen an experiment goes awry, or perhaps ominously right, Michael undergoes an extraordinary transformation, emerging with newfound confidence, insatiable ambition, and an enigmatic edge. Enter Anni, a formidable Chinese power broker and trailblazer in the realm of artificial intelligence.\n\nAmidst this backdrop, a catastrophic “sleeping sickness” sweeps across the globe, consuming the consciousness of its victims. Scientists make a chilling discovery; the origins are extraterrestrial.\n\nDelving into themes of dark matter, artificial intelligence, and the new frontier of artificial intimacy, this novel offers a stark look at the challenges and wonders that may await us in the not-so-distant future.”\n\nLAST BOOK ADDED TO MY GOODREADS TBR\n\nThe Complete Tales,\n\nby Beatrix Potter\n\nChildren\n\n1902-1930\n\n409 pages\n\nThis is the whole collection, from\n\nBook 1: The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902)\n\nto Book 23: The Tale of Little Pig Robinson (1930).\n\n📚 MAILBOX MONDAY 📚\n\nANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nI will no longer co-host MailboxMonday in 2024.

I can’t believe I waited so long to read them.\n\nThe book reminded me a bit of Sébastien Japrisot and Cornell Woolrich. Noir and psychological thrillers at the same time.\n\nBrilliant plot, with amazing ambiance, that actually reminded me of Le Horla.\n\nIt starts simply, with a man and his lover plotting together to kill his wife. But then, her body disappears…\n\nI kind of guessed how it was going to end, but still, the crescendo is fabulous, and the last line puzzled me for a minute.\n\nThe book inspired a very famous French movie, though they say they completely changed the story.\n\nHave you read anything by them?\n\nCURRENTLY READING / LISTENING TO\n\nHighlighting here only a couple:\n\n📚 Les dieux ont soif,\n\nby Anatole France\n\nHistorical fiction\n\n1912\n\n310 pages\n\nThe book is available in English as\n\nThe Gods Will Have Blood\n\nAm reading with French student E.\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nClick on the cover to access the English synopsis\n\nI had meant to read this historical novel on the aftermath of the French Revolution.\n\nSo far, it’s not as exciting as I thought.\n\nBut still I enjoy the description of characters and the settings.\n\n“It is April 1793 and the final power struggle of the French Revolution is taking hold: the aristocrats are dead and the poor are fighting for bread in the streets.\n\nIn a Paris swept by fear and hunger lives Gamelin, a revolutionary young artist appointed magistrate, and given the power of life and death over the citizens of France.

These stories cover a range of fascinating topics including simulated reality, speciesism, ecology, and transhumanism—all while exploring universal themes of belonging, death, and identity.\n\nSome of the authors featured in this anthology, like Julia Verlanger, Sylvie Denis, or Jean-Claude Dunyach, have shaped the history of French science fiction after World War II.\n\nCurated by Annabelle Dolidon and Tessa Sermet, French language and literature professors who share a love for the genre, these nine stories showcase some of the brilliant mid-to late twentieth and twenty-first century French contributions to science fiction.\n\nDolidon and Sermet provide illuminating expansions that accompany each tale and fascinating insights into the evolution of French and American science fiction. The discussion opportunities are also a wonderful resource for teachers and students of French literature and French culture as well as English and comparative literature. This anthology is a great opportunity to discover French sci-fi in English translation for fans or readers new to the genre.”\n\n🎧 Parisians: An Adventure History of Paris\n\nby Graham Robb, Nonfiction/History/France\n\n2010 496 pages / 14 H\n\nNarrated by Simon Vance\n\nReading for #NonficNov\n\nI as so impressed by The Discovery of France: A Historical Geography, that I decided to listen right away to the author’s book on Paris, especially when I realized the copy available through my Public Library and Hoopla was narrated by Simon Vance!\n\nIt’s different from Robb’s other book, in the sense that this one does not offer a systematic nor chronological history of Paris.\n\nInstead, it’s a series of (long) vignettes on important people, whose destiny is connected with Paris.\n\nI like his choice of people and how through them he highlights an aspect of Paris or another.\n\nAnd this man can write! Each chapter feels like a short novel. Brilliant rendering of facts.\n\nAs for the narration, I have to say Vance is down from the pedestal I had put him on. As a professional narrator, I’m appalled he didn’t take time to check the pronunciation of famous places in Paris, for instance.\n\nAt the beginning, I thought he was doing well, avoiding to pronounce the final consonant, as we usually do in French, but then here came Le Champ de Mars. This one is an exception, and we do pronounce the final -s here. Well, I’m tired of hearing “le Champ de “marr”! Seriously, professional narrators, please do your homework.\n\n“This is the Paris you never knew. From the Revolution to the present, Graham Robb has distilled a series of astonishing true narratives, all stranger than fiction.\n\nA young artillery lieutenant, strolling through the Palais-Royal, observes disapprovingly the courtesans plying their trade. A particular woman catches his eye; nature takes its course. Later that night Napoleon Bonaparte writes a meticulous account of his first sexual encounter. An aristocratic woman, fleeing the Louvre, takes a wrong turn and loses her way in the nameless streets of the Left Bank. For want of a map—there were no reliable ones at the time—Marie-Antoinette will go to the guillotine. Baudelaire, Baron Haussmann, the real-life Mimi of La Bohème, Proust, Charles de Gaulle (who is suspected of having faked an assassination attempt on himself in Notre Dame) —these and many more are Robb’s cast of characters.\n\nThe result is a resonant, intimate history with the power of a great novel.”\n\nBOOK UP NEXT\n\n📚 Jakob von Gunten,\n\nby Robert Walser\n\n1909\n\n176 pages\n\nIt counts for The Classics Club\n\nWill be reading for Novellas in November\n\nI have read very few Swiss authors.\n\nThis book seems to be one of his best, so let’s give it a try.\n\n“The Swiss writer Robert Walser is one of the quiet geniuses of twentieth-century literature. Largely self-taught and altogether indifferent to worldly success, Walser wrote a range of short stories, essays and four novels, of which Jakob von Gunten is widely recognized as the finest. It tells the story of a seventeen-year-old runaway from an old family who enrolls in a school for servants. The Institute, run by the domineering Herr Benjamenta and his beautiful but ailing sister, is a deeply mysterious place: the faculty lies asleep in a single room. The students though subject to fierce discipline, come and go at will. Jakob, an irrepressibly subversive presence, keeps a journal in which he records his quirky impressions of the school as well as his own quickly changing enthusiasms and uncertainties, deliberations and dreams. And in the end, as the Institute itself dissolves around him like a dream, he steps out boldly to explore still-unimagined worlds.”\n\nLAST BOOK ADDED TO MY GOODREADS TBR\n\nThe Dos Do Bark (Dr. Westlake #1),\n\nby Jonathan Stagge\n\nMystery\n\n1936\n\n192 pages\n\n“Introducing country doctor Hugh Westlake in a Golden Age mystery of seduction and murder set among a small affluent town.\n\nAs the town doctor for the village of Kenmore, Hugh Westlake spends most of his time making late-night house calls to overanxious patients and treating colds and the flu—until one bright winter morning. Riding with the hunt club, Hugh makes a grisly discovery: the headless, naked torso of a woman. The murder shocks the town and its upper crust society. Before long, the remains are identified as local woman Anne Grimshawe, who was notably missing from the hunt that morning, and who is pegged as a woman of loose morals by the local busybody.\n\nDeputized by the local inspector, Hugh is drawn into the comings-and-goings of the hunt club members. While investigating his own friends, neighbors, and patients, he follows scurrilous rumors to evidence of amorous assignations, jealousy, and greed. Someone in their midst has something to hide—and the chase is on before a killer goes to ground leaving more victims behind . . .”\n\n📚 MAILBOX MONDAY 📚\n\nANNOUNCEMENT:\n\nI will no longer co-host MailboxMonday in 2024.
