        "text": "üåü Please join us in welcoming ForeFront's newest Practice Director, Kaushik Ghosh ‚òÅ PMP¬Æ ITIL¬Æ to the team! üåü With over 10 years of experience in the Salesforce ecosystem, Kaushik specializes in technical solutions and even holds a seat on the Salesforce Field Service advisory board! Reach out to Kaushik for all your Salesforce Field Service needs. Welcome to the team, Kaushik! We are thrilled to have you on board! üéâüöÄ #Welcome #TeamForeFront #Salesforce #FieldService #NewBeginnings\n\nAt ForeFront we often say that we help customers stay ‚Äúat the forefront‚Äù of new technologies. ‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs what that actually means in practice. Our team has been hard at work learning how to leverage AI + Data + CRM solutions in Salesforce. Last week, Yana Vovchik and Sang Nguyen attended the AI Now Tour ahead of World Tour NYC. While there, they got some truly hands-on experience using Data Cloud, Prompt Builder, and Einstein Copilot. They presented some of their takeaways at our monthly Lunch & Learn. We also had a lively chat about the Einstein 1 platform and what it means for our clients. There‚Äôs a lot to learn about the latest and greatest innovations across AI, data, CRM, and the entire Salesforce ecosystem. At ForeFront, we love learning about these new tools‚Ä¶ and we love applying them to our clients‚Äô businesses even more ü§ñüöÄ #Salesforce #BetterTogether #TeamForeFront #AI\n\nYesterday at HQ, we hosted our Future ForeFrontians for Bring Your Child to Work Day! We kicked off with an office tour and split participants into teams of four to build a castle. Emphasizing our client-focused approach, teams documented their process for replicating their build, mirroring how we teach our clients. Later, adults replicated the castles using these instructions. This Build & Tell activity reinforced our commitment to empowering clients with the skills to succeed independently, echoing the guidance children provided. The highlight was comparing adult builds to children‚Äôs instructions, reflecting our commitment to nurturing client success. At ForeFront, we're pioneers in innovation and client empowerment. Our focus is on preparing clients not just for today but for the future, ensuring sustained success. #Innovation #ClientEmpowerment #BuildAndTell #BringYourChildtoWorkDay24\n\n#TeamForeFront is on the move again! This time, Allie Burnaford and Brita Gaeddert ventured to San Francisco for a very exciting event: the FY'25 Salesforce Vector Partner Program kickoff. Vector is all about helping select hyper-growth partners dramatically scale their go-to-market motions with Salesforce. We're incredibly honored to have been selected and we can't wait to dig in to the curriculum over the next few months. #BetterTogether #TheVectorEffect #Salesforce\n\nWe love closing out the week with new Salesforce certs üéâ Congratulations to ForeFront's newest Certified Data Cloud Consultants, Brian McCray and Esteban Gonzalez! Not sure how to leverage the power of Data Cloud? Talk to Brian, Esteban, and #TeamForeFront. We understand exactly how to use this platform to unify disconnected customer data, improve experiences, and drive growth üìàüìàüìà #teamforefront #salesforce #bettertogether #datacloud\n\nBrita Gaeddert has nothing but great things to say about the past few days at Rooted-In 2024: ‚úÖ Panels and sessions filled with expert insights gained from real-world industry experience. ‚úÖ Innovative manufacturing use cases that #TeamForeFront will use to help our clients continue to optimize their operations. ‚úÖ Quality time with partners and peers. ‚úÖ Robots. Thanks for putting on such a valuable and engaging event, Rootstock Software! #RootedIn #Manufacturing #ERP #Salesforce #BetterTogether"
