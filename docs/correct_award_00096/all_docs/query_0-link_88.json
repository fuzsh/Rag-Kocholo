Date: 1844 - 1924\n\nMary Evans Picture Library makes available wonderful images created for people to enjoy over the centuries\n\nMedia ID 14303496\n\nÂ© Mary Evans Picture Library\n\n1844 1921 Anatole Awarded Jacques Nobel Prize Prolific Real Thibault 1924\n\nEDITORS COMMENTS\n\nAnatole France: A Prolific French Literary Genius and Nobel Laureate (1844-1924) This evocative black and white portrait captures the enigmatic and intellectual presence of Anatole France, the renowned French writer who graced the literary world with his profound works from 1844 to 1924. Born Jacques Thibault, Anatole France adopted his pen name as a tribute to his maternal grandfather, Anatole Le Courbe. France's literary career spanned over eight decades, during which he produced an impressive body of work that included novels, essays, plays, and poetry. His writing style was marked by wit, irony, and a deep understanding of human nature. He was a master of language and a keen observer of society, often using his works to critique the political and social issues of his time. In 1921, Anatole France was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature \"in recognition of his rich and creative writing, which, through its charm and spiritual insight, has made a very deep impression on the contemporary world.\" This prestigious honor capped off a remarkable career that had already seen him receive numerous accolades and critical acclaim. Despite his many achievements, France remained humble and dedicated to his craft. He continued to write until his death in 1924, leaving behind a legacy that continues to inspire and captivate readers around the world. This photograph serves as a poignant reminder of the enduring power of the written word and the indelible impact of one of France's greatest literary treasures.\n\nMADE IN AUSTRALIA\n\nSafe Shipping with 30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nFREE COLORIZATION SERVICE\n\nYou can choose advanced AI Colorization for this picture at no extra charge!\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
