        "text": "This extract provides my Editor's Note from Lafcadio Hearn's translation of Anatole France's breakthrough novel 'The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard', along with an introductory on France by Hearn and an essay 'On Crime' by Anatole France himself. It is rare that such a great author as Lafcadio Hearn actually translates another authors work in such a spirited and faithful way. It will certainly reveal a different angle on Hearn to academics and students of his work who are almost entirely familiar with him as the ultimate 'Japanophile'! My editorial essay is brief but I am passionate about this translation and I hope that providing the prelims here will interest some readers in delving deeper. Anatole France's essay 'On Crime' was a particular find and it's analysis of Dostoyevsky contrasts sharply with the 'crime' represented in France's own novel. In fact, reading the two together - his essay and the novel - should get many researchers more deeply interested in the fascinating topic of crime and what makes something criminal. I have also included the brief bibliography of Anatole France's works that I compiled for this volume as well as a portrait of Anatole France at 31 years of age, roughly contemparaneous with the release of this novel. It is important to remember that 'The Crime of Sylvestre Bonnard' was the Prize Novel of the French Academy in 1881 - a prestigious honour indeed for such a young author - and that France would go on to be the recipient of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921."
