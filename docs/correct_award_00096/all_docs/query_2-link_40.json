        "text": "WC isn’t really much of a fan of things French. Some might blame the dislike on the shabby treatment WC got on a trip down the Rhine in 1972.\n\nBut WC has always made an exception for Anatole France, the Nobel Prize-winning author, poet, playwright and philosopher who brightened French literature from 1844 to 1924.\n\nQuotations out of context are always suspect, but here are a few of the reasons WC admires the writings of Anatole France, all of which seem to comment on current events.\n\nIn its majestic equality, the law forbids rich and poor alike to sleep under bridges, beg in the streets and steal loaves of bread.\n\nWC doesn’t know of an aphorism that better states the fundamental hypocrisy of the law. And WC says that as a persn who has spent more than 40 years practicing law.\n\nIf a million people say a foolish thing, it is still a foolish thing.\n\nIf millions of people cast a foolish vote, it is still a foolish vote. Again, France manages to encapsulate a fundamental flaw of democracy in a single sentence.\n\nIt is better to understand little than to misunderstand a lot.\n\nFrance was not particularly humble. Neither was Sir Issac Newton, who is supposed to have said, “To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.” But still.\n\nAn education isn’t how much you have committed to memory, or even how much you know. It’s being able to differentiate between what you know and what you don’t.\n\nCritical thinking is absolutely essential to living in America today, yet it is the skill that seems to be in shortest supply. Truthiness – what WC was taught to call verisimilitude – is a woefully inadequate tool.\n\nSo long as society is founded on injustice, the function of the laws will be to defend injustice. And the more unjust they are the more respectable they will seem.\n\nThe thought is better and more dramatically captured in the first quote above, but this is the general principle. Andrespectable laws are the very hardest kind to overturn.\n\nWhen a thing has been said and well, have no scruple. Take it and copy it.\n\nWC doubts very much that Melanie Trump knows who Anatole France is, let alone had read him. But her plagiarism of Michelle Obama would be an insincere hat tip to France’s aphorism."
