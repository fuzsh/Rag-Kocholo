        "text": "For a relatively brief novel — just over 200 pages-long in the edition I read — Anatole France’s Penguin Island (1908, French: L’île des pinguoins) is quite dense. We could not expect otherwise for a work of fiction that deals with a profound question that the French have been asking themselves for centuries: what makes our nation special? What does it mean to be French and what does our history say about us? Is being French any different from belonging to any other ethnicity? It would have been far easier for the Nobel Prize-winning author to simply write a lengthy essay on French history, but that would not have been quite as fun and whimsical as a novel that instead discusses an imaginary nation that works as a metaphor for France. This imaginary nation has a rather peculiar origin myth: after being accidentally baptized by a visually impaired Celtic Catholic missionary in the Middle Ages, a colony of penguins living on a small island near the Arctic circle (given the geographical coordinates, Anatole France is possibly thinking of great auks instead of penguins, if anyone is interested in zoological accuracy) is turned by God into human beings and their island is moved to somewhere near continental Europe. Anatole France then begins, through the voice of a researcher writing a study on the history of the Penguins, to tell us their history. Using an allegedly neutral foreigner to comment on French affairs was particularly popular in the literature of the French Enlightenment, with epistolary novels like Montesquieu’s Persian Letters and Graffigny’s Letters From a Peruvian Woman as the most well-known examples. Anatole France wants, like those before him, to make his fellow Frenchmen and people in general to question widely held assumptions about national pride, reason, and teleology that seemed evident during his era.\n\nThe first part of the novel dealing with the Penguin Middle Ages might remind people of European Medieval literature, with plenty of legends and folktales surrounding the rise of the Penguin nation. Of particular centrality to the novel is the establishment of the Draconide monarchy by a series of deceptions: a lady named Orberose convinces his husband, who has been terrorizing nearby villages in a dragon costume, to stage the dragon’s defeat in front of the people and blackmail them into making him king to fend off future dragons from invading their land. They accept and this the Draconide monarchy is placed at the core of the Penguin national myth and the cheating Orberose ends up as a beloved saint. The idea that the Penguin monarchy and nationhood has its roots on a fraudulent farce is only the first of several biting critiques of the French nation throughout the novel.\n\nWe continue to witness the failings of the monarchy until A. France arrives to the Penguin modern era. This is the lengthiest section of the novel for good reason: it recounts important events in French history that A. France lived through. For example, an aristocratic and clergy-led plot to take down the recently established Penguin Republic falling through certainly echoes the frequent political transformations of France after the 1789 Revolution. Here, A. France overtly denounces those who have wanted to keep the pre-revolutionary social order in his home country by seeking to revive the monarchy and its institutions. The most interesting part of this section, however, is the discussion of the Dreyfus Affair. Anatole France (like his disciple Proust and many other prominent culture critics at the time) documents the affair as a strong sociocultural and political division of the country. On one side, there were the leftists and artists who defended the innocence of Jewish Captain Dreyfus (unfairly accused of treason and jailed in French Guiana) and on the other, the anti-Semitic conservatives who saw in the affair an opportunity to increase nationalistic sentiments. In A. France’s novel, Dreyfus’ name is changed to Pyrot but otherwise the description of events stays historically accurate. The Dreyfus Affair was a turning point in French history: it forced everybody to ask himself what it meant to be loyal to the French nation and who counted as French. In the novel, naturally, those who planted fake evidence against Dreyfus and persecuted him and his defenders are not spared of strong ridicule and disapproval by the author. After the discussion of the Dreyfus Affair, A. France delves into a mix of political and romantic drama that somehow leads to war with Germany (or the imaginary nation of Marsouinie, in the novel) and ends with a sardonic remark that the people claim the Penguin nation has reached its peak, in spite of widespread poverty and inequality.\n\nThe final section of the novel is a far darker dystopia that speaks of the Penguin nation becoming a place ravaged by capitalism with plenty of pollution, class inequality, mental health issues and terrorism. A reader who didn’t know the author and was presented with them for the first time could be fooled into attributing these bleak passages to Orwell or Huxley, but A. France was of course writing these somber predictions decades before either. At the end, the Penguin nation crumbles after overexploiting the land and reverts to antiquity and desolation, then suddenly rises again, builds a new civilization with the aid of invaders from mainland Europe, and once again advances to an unsustainable capitalism that reverts it once again to prehistory. Whether A. France is being far too pessimistic about the future of humanity is certainly debatable, but the idea that capitalism as he witnessed it (and, naturally, as we continue to witness it) is unsustainable has definitely been proven right.\n\nWhile Penguin Island is clearly a novel concerned with French history, by its end most of its philosophy can apply to humankind as a whole. His critique of acerbated nationalism, phony nation-building, and capitalism rang true during the era that immediately preceded WWI but continues to be relevant as national leaders everywhere in the world continue to adhere to imaginary myths and allegiances to fight “enemies” while the class struggle has not ceased to persist in the background. The challenge, after learning about this, is to keep thinking, rejecting and fighting about the axes of oppression that keep humanity down so that, perhaps, we don’t kill our civilization to death and return to prehistory like the Penguins."
