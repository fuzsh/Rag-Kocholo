Bound by Stikeman for Charles Scribner's Sons in 3/4 crushed blue morocco over cloth, five raised bands, and gilt ruling to spines and boards. Top edges brightly gilt. Marbled endpapers. Spines uniformly sunned. Approximately eight volumes with minor chipping or snagging to crowns. Overall a handsome set that presents well.\n\nA lion of French letters, Anatole France won the 1921 Nobel Prize for Literature in recognition of his wide-ranging contributions to literature. France's career spanned decades and genres, and he started writing as a journalist before publishing poetry and then novels. France is particularly celebrated for his novel Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard, published in 1881. At-times iconoclastic, France earned many enemies, both conservatives and progressives. The Catholic Church was no fan either, and they banned all of France's works the year after he won the Nobel Prize. (Item #3873)"
