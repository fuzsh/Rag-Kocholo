Biographical History

Anatole France (1844-1924) was a French novelist, essayist, poet, and critic who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1921.

Born François-Anatole Thibault in Paris on April 16, 1844, Anatole France was the son of Antoinette Galas and François-Noël Thibault, a bookseller and publisher. As a result of his father's profession, France grew up surrounded by books. He attended the Collège Saint-Stanislas from 1855 to 1862. He left the college in 1862 to begin studying independently and earned his baccalaureate degree in 1864. In 1877, France married Valérie Guérin de Sauville, with whom he had one daughter, Suzanne. The couple divorced in 1893. In 1920, France was remarried to Emma Laprevotte. France went on to have a prosperous literary career, winning the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921. The prize was awarded "in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament" (The Nobel Foundation, http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1921/index.html). He died in October 1924.
