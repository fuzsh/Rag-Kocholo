As of 2020, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 6,898.[4] The city was named for Madison Perry, fourth governor of the state of Florida and a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War.[5]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1922, Perry was a very small town of less than 2,000 people. During this time, a murder happened and three people were lynched for the crimes. Private retribution against the suspected families and those that gave them support ensued. The Perry Massacre occurred in Perry on the 14th and 15 December 1922, during which whites hanged Charles Wright and attacked the black community of Perry after the murder of a white schoolteacher.[6] On the day following Wright's lynching two more black men were shot and hanged; whites then burned the town's black school, Masonic lodge, church, amusement hall, and several families' homes.[6][7][8]\n\nFirefighters battling a blaze[9] at a natural gas plant in August 1998 were injured when an explosion ripped through the area, sending a mammoth fireball into the sky. The flames destroyed at least six houses and several vehicles and forced the evacuation of 100 homes within two miles of the plant. Four firefighters were hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\nIn August 2023, Hurricane Idalia impacted Florida.
