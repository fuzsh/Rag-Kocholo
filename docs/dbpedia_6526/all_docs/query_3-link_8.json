Hampton for $400 from John and Ana Carlton of Madison in 1879. The Hamptons eventually formed the Hampton Springs Hotel and Mineral Company with $20,000 of working capital. The family decided to capitalize off the investment around the turn of the century and the first part of the hotel was built in 1908. It was a two story structure with about 70 rooms. A nearby boarding house, also two story structure, helped house the overflow during the busy season. It wasn’t until wealthy Georgia railroad businessman J. W. Oglesby took an interest in the area that things started to expand. When the hotel was expanded in 1915, it had all the trappings of a luxury resort, including wicker furniture, steam heat throughout the building and a magnificent water fountain that would be lit up at night. This beautiful resort hotel was constructed 5 miles west of Perry. It was built on the site of a sumptuous spring. The hotel had its own power and water plant.\n\nFor reasons unknown, Oglesby leased his interest in the hotel in 1927 to Arnold Joerns for 99 years.

I can remember playing on them when I was young. I remember one behind the Shiloh Church on Shiloh Road, also one east of Boyd out towards the bay.
