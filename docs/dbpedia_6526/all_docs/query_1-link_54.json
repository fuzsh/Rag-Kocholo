        "text": "Establishment\n\nFloral City Marshal J.W Newsome died on Tuesday, March 3, 1908, at the age of 32. Newsome received a tip, which is now perceived to be a false one, on a man that was wanted for an earlier shooting. The goal of the person who sent the tip in was to “lure” the Marshal to the saloon. When arriving at the local saloon, an illegal liquor establishment, Marshal Newsome was shot and killed. Newsome advised the suspect he was under arrest, and when the suspect began to raise his gun Newsome grabbed his as well. They shot simultaneously but Marshal Newsome was hit and died instantly.\n\nThe Line of Duty death was apparently and unfortunately “forgotten” by local officials and later rediscovered by Dr. Wilbanks in 1996. His death was then brought to the attention of Sheriff Charles Dean of Citrus County and Sheriff Dean then certified Newsome’s death. Newsome is remembered today for his dedication and bravery. The names and whereabouts of his descendants are unknown because after the death of J.W Newsome, they left town for “parts unknown” and they’re not listed in the 1900 FL census. It is known that he was survived by his wife, three children, and two brothers. J.W Newsome’s grave can be found in the Hills of Rest Cemetery in Floral City, FL.\n\nDeputy James McIntosh McMullen, was assassinated at his home on December 26, 1899, at the age of 47 years old. McMullen is a decedent of the most prominent pioneer family of Pinellas County. Deputy James McIntosh McMullen served in the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office in the late 1800s as a sheriff’s deputy. He was the first law enforcement officer of Citrus County to be killed in the line of duty. The assassin of McMullen was a fugitive from justice, and after the assassination, the killer fled the scene. It is still unknown if he ever was apprehended.\n\nMcMullen was born on November 6th, 1852, in Thomas County, GA, and he is one of seven children. Deputy McMullen’s grave can be found at the McMullen cemetery next to their log cabin in Pinellas County. In 1997, Citrus County Sheriff Jeff Dawsy certified the name of James McIntosh McMullen to the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, D.C. James McMullen’s death was brought to CCSO’s attention by Dr. Wilbanks. Deputy McMullen was survived by his wife and two children. McMullen is a hero that is remembered today, and the sacrifices he made will never be forgotten.\n\nWhile on duty, Master Detective Aubrey Fred Johnson sadly died from an automobile crash. At the time of the accident, Detective Fred Johnson was 61 years old. The accident happened on Tuesday, February 11th, 1997. While driving on duty, Master Detective Johnson’s car collided with another car and then continued to hit a utility pole. Johnson was dedicated to the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office with a total service of 16 years. We continue to honor and mourn Detective Fred Johnson and those whose watch have ended much too soon.\n\nNational Cases\n\nAmerica’s Most Famous Female Serial Killer\n\nOn June 1, 1990, the body of David Spears was located in Citrus County. Investigators with the Citrus County Sheriff’s Office were able to work with other Florida law enforcement officers and link this case to one of America’s most famous female serial killer, Aileen Wuornos.\n\nAileen “Lee” Carol Wuornos was born February 29, 1956, in Rochester, Michigan. Her father was convicted of child molestation and killed himself in prison. Wuornos’ mother abandoned her and her brother when they were young, leaving them with her parents. Childhood friends said that Wuornos’ grandfather beat her and her grandmother was an alcoholic. (The Facts, n.d.).\n\nBy the early 1980s, after her brother’s death from cancer, Wuornos moved to Florida to work as a prostitute. She frequently was in trouble with the law, for being a prostitute and for other crimes.\n\nFrom late 1989 through late 1990, the bodies of 6 middle-aged white men were discovered in central Florida. The assailant had robbed all of the victims before shooting them to death and stealing their cars. During the murder investigations, Volusia County police discovered items belonging to Richard Mallory (Wuornos’ first victim) at a local pawn shop, with a receipt showing Wuornos’ thumbprint. (The Facts, n.d.).\n\nPolice were able to trace other stolen items from Mallory to Wuornos. A camera from Mallory’s automobile was found inside a rented warehouse unit, which was opened with a key taken from Wuornos. Wuornos had rented the unit under an alias.\n\nWuornos was charged with the first-degree murder of Richard Mallory, armed robbery with a firearm or deadly weapon, and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Prosecutors argued Wuornos qualified for the death penalty based on the charge of murder committed in the course of a robbery.\n\nWuornos’s capital trial for the murder of Richard Mallory began on January 13, 1992. The jury recommended the death sentence by a vote of 12-0. The judge followed the jury’s recommendation of death and sentenced Wuornos to the electric chair on January 31, 1992. (Aileen c. Wuornos vs. the State of Florida, 1992) Later that year, Wuornos would also be found guilty of the murders of her other victims (Humphreys, Carskaddon, Spears, Burress, and Antonio). No charges were brought against her for the murder of Peter Siems, as his body was never found. In all, she received six death sentences.\n\nOn October 9, 2002, Aileen Wuornos was executed by lethal injection at Florida State Prison. In her last statement, Wuornos said, “I'd just like to say I'm sailing with the rock, and I'll be back like Independence Day, with Jesus June 6. Like the movie, big mother ship and all, I'll be back.\" She was pronounced dead at 9:47 a.m. Aileen Wuornos was the tenth woman to be executed in the United States since 1976 and the second woman ever executed in Florida.

Couey was a 46-year-old convicted sex offender who lived nearby and abducted Jessica from her bedroom in the early morning on February 24, 2005.\n\nAt 5:30 a.m. that morning, when Jessica’s father was getting ready for work, he noticed his daughter was gone. The Citrus County Sheriff’s Office, along with hundreds of volunteers pour into the area searching for Jessica. John Evander Couey was named a person of interest due to his criminal background of sexual offenses and for failing to reside at his registered address.\n\nOn March 12, Couey was arrested in Augusta, Georgia, for questioning about Jessica Lunsford's disappearance. Couey stated he did not have anything to do with the nine-year-old disappearance and had moved to Georgia to find a job, only knowing about it from the television news. (John Couey vs. the State of Florida, 2007) He was released from police custody after being interviewed.\n\nDays later, investigators finally received a crack in the case at the home of Couey’s sister, Dorothy Dixon. Dixon’s home was located on West Snowbird Court, just yards away from the Lunsford home. Dixon allowed CCSO officials into the home, where they located bloodstained evidence in Couey’s bedroom.\n\nOn March 17, 2005, twenty-one days after Jessica Lunsford’s disappearance, Couey was arrested and charged with her murder and transported to the Citrus County jail. The next day, Couey made an audio-recorded and videotaped confession to CCSO officials of the kidnapping, rape, and murder of Jessica.\n\nIn his graphic confession, Couey said that he had intended to just burglarize the Lunsford's home but saw Jessica and \"acted on impulse, and he took her.\" He entered Lunsford's house at about three o'clock in the morning through an unlocked door, awakened Lunsford, told her, \"Don't yell or nothing\", and told her to follow him out of the house. Couey admitted to raping Jessica in his bedroom, keeping her in his bed that evening, where he raped her again in the morning. Couey put her in his closet and ordered her to remain there, which she did as he went to work. Three days after he abducted her, Couey tricked Jessica into getting into two garbage bags by saying he was going to \"take her home.” Instead, he cruelly buried her alive.\n\nIn the early morning hours of March 19, despite efforts made by detectives and personnel from our office, as well as numerous community organizations, Jessica’s lifeless body was uncovered at Couey’s residence, buried in a plastic bag in a hole of approximately 2½' deep and 2' circular. We will NEVER forget the pain the Lunsford family felt to learn that their precious Jessica would not be returning home.\n\nUnable to seat an impartial jury in Citrus County, the trial for Jessica’s murder was moved to Miami. On March 7, 2007, Couey was found guilty of all charges in relation to Lunsford's death, including first-degree murder, kidnapping, burglary with assault or battery upon any person, and capital sexual battery. (John Couey vs. the State of Florida, 2007)\n\nThe jury deliberated for four hours, tasked with recommending either life in prison without the possibility of parole or the death penalty, the only two possible sentences available under Florida law. A week later, after about one hour and 15 minutes of deliberation, a jury recommended Couey be sentenced to death.\n\nOn August 24, 2007, a judge convicted Couey for the kidnapping, sexual battery, and first-degree murder of Lunsford, and sentenced him to death. However, Couey died of natural causes in 2009, before his sentence could be carried out. (Blanco, n.d.).\n\nDetectives and the entire CCSO worked tirelessly to bring justice for this young girl, including passing the Jessica Lunsford Act. This act significantly altered Florida’s Sexual Offender and Predator Registration Laws, resulting in tougher registration requirements and increased penalties for violations.\n\nToday, we proudly support and utilize Jessie’s Place - a Children’s Advocacy Center located right here in Citrus County. The center was designed to be a warm and welcoming place, so child victims of abuse and neglect have a safe haven to tell their story and begin the road to recovery.\n\nReferences:\n\nBlanco, J. I.
