        "text": "It's an overall mid school district. While I do enjoy some aspects while attending here, especially the ones involving social interaction, the education system is lacking. Some of the teachers give a valiant effort in teaching us, even if they may not execute it well. Others barely teach and expect us to figure everything out. The activities and clubs are also limited to just a few things. This school has plenty of potential even if it's hard to see."
