        "text": "Frequently asked questions\n\nWhat is Habitat for Humanity?\n\nHabitat for Humanity is a nonprofit housing organization working in local communities across all 50 states and in more than 70 countries around the world. Habitat’s vision is of a world where everyone has a decent place to live. Habitat works toward this vision by building and improving homes in partnership with individuals and families in need of a decent and affordable place to live.\n\nHow does Habitat for Humanity’s homeownership program work?\n\nFamilies and individuals in need of decent, affordable housing apply for homeownership with their local Habitat for Humanity.\n\nEach local Habitat’s family selection committee selects homeowners based on three criteria:\n\nThe applicant’s level of need.\n\nTheir willingness to partner with Habitat.\n\nTheir ability to repay a mortgage through an affordable payment plan.\n\nAs part of their willingness to partner, Habitat’s homebuyers invest hundreds of hours of their own labor, called sweat equity, working alongside volunteers and other Habitat homeowners.\n\nHabitat for Humanity follows a nondiscriminatory policy of family selection. Neither race nor religion is a factor in choosing Habitat’s homeowners.\n\nWhat is a Habitat for Humanity ReStore?\n\nHabitat for Humanity ReStores are nonprofit home improvement stores and donation centers that sell new and gently used furniture, home accessories, building materials and appliances to the public at a fraction of the retail price. Habitat for Humanity ReStores are proudly owned and operated by local Habitat for Humanity affiliates. Proceeds are used to build homes and improve communities locally and around the world.\n\nCan I donate materials?\n\nIn many locations, Habitat for Humanity operates ReStores, which sell reusable and surplus building materials, furniture and appliances to the public. To donate materials, contact your local Habitat ReStore.\n\nHow can I become a volunteer?\n\nContact your local Habitat for Humanity for volunteer opportunities near you."
