        "text": "Reprint from The Taylor County News, April 12, 1945\n\nLumber And Agriculture Form Basis Of Long Time Prosperity In Perry\n\nUnder the above heading the Sunshine Service News, published in the February number the accompanying article by Jack Weidler, manager here for the Florida Power & Light Company. Sunshine Service News is an attractive and interesting monthly issued by the utility for its employees and others.\n\nThrough the interest of Mr. Weidler, The Taylor County News was privileged to send reprints of the article to persons in the armed forces from this county. The Florida Power & Light Company supplied the reprints ready for insertion as a supplement to this paper, and they were mailed out to those in the service with the issue of March 15.\n\nIn order that all News readers may have the opportunity to read the article it is here reprinted with the photo reproduction and the short biography of Mr. Weidler, which accompanied the article in the Sunshine Service News. The article follows:\n\n(By J. W. Weidler, Manager)\n\nPerry, a town of some 3,000 inhabitants, is the county seat of and is centrally located in Taylor county. Taylor county lies in the northeastern curve of the Gulf of Mexico, with a coast line of 52 miles.\n\nIn the early days, the name Rose Head was given to this community, due to the profusion of wild Cherokee roses there.\n\nIn 1857, Taylor county was formed by dividing Madison county, and Perry named the county seat, receiving its name from Madison Perry, who served the state of Florida as governor from 1857 to 1861.\n\nPicturesque streams with such musical names as Fenholloway, Aucilla, Econfina and Steinhatchee wind about Taylor county, and many tales have grown around these names.\n\nIt was not until 1905 that the residents of Perry first received electric service. In that year, The Perry Ice & Power Company was organized and owned by Major Faulkner and Messrs. Stanford and Owens. In 1907 this business became bankrupt and service was temporarily discontinued. J. H. Scales and D. G. Malloy took over the company in 1908 and formed the Perry Electric Company.\n\nPlant Served 52\n\nIn 1911 Major George E. Porter assumed control of the Perry Electric Company which was then serving 52 customers. J. D. Scruggs was named general manager in 1913, and many improvements were made and its customers grow to approximately 325. On July 1, 1925, The Perry Electric Company, controlled and operated by the General Utilities and Operating company of Baltimore.\n\nEnlargement of the system was undertaken and many improvements accomplished, including the installation of a diesel plant, which is still in service. A 13 KV tie line was constructed between Foley and Perry in 1929, thereby enabling the utility to secure power from Brooks-Scanlon Corporation.\n\nThe Florida Power & Light Company began operations in Perry on July 15, 1930, with M. A. Maxwell as manager. In 1931 John T. Moore succeeded Mr. Maxwell and acted in that capacity until February 1940, when he was transferred to Lake City at which time J. W. Weidler became manager in Perry. During the years from 1931 to 1940 the company operations were expanded and improved. The hurricane of 1935 caused damage roughly amounting to $10,000 in Perry. The few days following this storm is the longest interruption sustained in Perry since Florida Power & Light Company began operations.\n\nIn the early thirties the Perry substation was relocated from the edge of town to the plant, placing the load center in proper location. In 1940 a 22 KV tie line was constructed between Perry and Madison, and energized in November of that year. C. A. Ashton is load dispatcher. This construction called for a 22 KV substation at Perry and Madison.\n\nThe main source of power supply for Perry and Madison is Brooks-Scanlon Corporation, at Foley, five miles to the southeast of Perry, being connected to Perry by a 13 KV line. Cold diesel standby plants are located at Madison and Perry.\n\nPerry Shows Growth\n\nDuring recent years Perry has shown a substantial growth. In January 1938, Perry had 511 customers. This figure has now grown to 775.\n\nThe Perry Army Air Field was activated in 1943, receiving electric service from Florida Power & Light Company.\n\nElectric service was recently extended to the community of Fenholloway, about six miles from Perry. Plans are made to serve several other populated areas near Perry.\n\nTo the people who are familiar with Perry and Taylor county, these names are directly associated with the lumber industry, as this area has long been famous for the fine lumber produced here. The lumber industry is the backbone of the financial structure of Taylor county, which boasts of several large mills, headed by Brooks-Scanlon Corporation and Lee Cypress Company.\n\nFoley’s Industry Center\n\nThe modern lumber manufacturing plant of Brooks-Scanlon Corporation is located in its own town of Foley, population 1,500, approximately 5 miles southeast of Perry. Brooks-Scanlon is one of the largest producers of Southern yellow pine in the nation. Located on the Live Oak, Perry & Gulf railroad, this progressive enterprise headed by M. J. Foley, president, provides steady employment for its hundreds of employees in manufacturing its high quality product. An extensive reforestation program is maintained.\n\nThe Lee Cypress company, largest cypress mill in the world, is one of the few all steel saw mills in this part of the country. The property of the Burton-Swartz Cypress Company, which operated here for more than 25 years, was acquired by Lee Cypress company, and saw mill operations began by this organization in 1943. J. Arthur Currey is president of this enterprising company which is unique in that the cypress logs are hauled approximately 400 miles by rail from Collier county to the mill site in Perry. The source of supply is known as the Big Cypress Swamp, and represents the last stand of cypress timber of any consequence in the southeast.\n\nRounding out the sawmill industry in Taylor county are Weaver-Loughridge Lumber Company, Granger Brothers & Hall and Pinkerton Lumber Company.\n\nGeneral farming is the primary agricultural activity, built largely around range cattle and hogs. The 591 farms in the county average 94 acres to the farm, of which a good part is placed under cultivation. The main cash crop is tobacco, the land being peculiarly suited to the growing of that product.\n\nThe peanut and corn crops are grown primarily for cattle and hog feed, and are not placed extensively on the market. Sugar cane and sweet potatoes are grown in abundance, primarily for home consumption. Poultry raising is expanding and will probably play a growing part in the agricultural development of this area.\n\nLive Stock Flourishes\n\nThe live stock industry plays the most important part in the farming field, there being between 30,000 and 40,000 head of hogs and cattle solely on the open range. Good breeding is being practiced, and the stock is being gradually improved.\n\nThe six navel stores operations in the county carry on a large and growing turpentine industry. The waters of the Gulf near Taylor county furnish Rock Island sponges in large quantities, that particular sponge being one of the finest in the world. Sponge and fish markets are located at Steinhatchee and Jug Island and are being expanded and developed.\n\nNaturally, the wild life in the county is among the best. A few bears still range the woods, while turkey, deer, quail, dove, geese and ducks are found in season. The streams and lakes nearby boast of bass, bream and other fresh water fish, while the salt water fishers find red fish, sea bass, mackerel and many others that delight the angler’s skill.\n\nOn the religious side, Perry has many fine churches, including Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian, Episcopal, Catholic and others.\n\nThree railroads serve the county. The main line of the Atlantic Coast Line between Chicago, Atlanta and Tampa, passes through Perry. The Live Oak, Perry & Gulf Railroad, with their home office at Foley, Florida, five miles from Perry, operates between Perry and Live Oak, making connections with the cross-state Seaboard. The South Georgia Railway Company with Perry as the southern terminus, travels between Perry and Adel, Georgia.\n\nThe Taylor County News is the only newspaper issued in the county. It appears weekly, and under the able supervision of R. L. Thompson, has faithfully served Perry and Taylor county many years.\n\nConstruction Booms\n\nA considerable amount of construction is under way in Perry at the present time, headed by 25 new residences, a new bus station and other facilities, necessary to take care of the growing population.\n\nFocal point of interest at Perry today is the Perry Army Air Field, located approximately 3 miles from the city. The roster of flying officers assembly at Perry Army Air Field comprises as noteworthy a group of fighter pilots as ever flew out of the sun - and these men have done that in almost every corner of the globe. Many have just recently returned from combat zones, where they received their baptism of combat experience in the early stages of the war.\n\nHeading the training program at Perry AAF is Lt. Col. Thomas J. Barrett, commanding officer, who has over 3,000 flying hours to his credit, of which approximately 1,700 are pursuit in the Panama Canal Zone. Col Barrett commanded a fighter squadron, was on the staff of the 26th Fighter Command and later served on the Sixth Air Force staff.\n\nTypical of Perry trained pilots is Lt. Robert Keen, who twice within a period of one month, brought down three German planes in dog-fighting over France. Only 20 years old Lt. Keen of Jacksonville, Florida, was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross for his accomplishment.\n\nTurning out such pilots with maximum speed and efficiency, the Perry AAF Ground Training Division and Officers of Director of Flying Training provide the newest teachings of science, mechanics and aviation techniques with actual application of all instruction.\n\nWith at least 1,000 men from this county in the armed forces, the products of the many essential industries, and the trained fighter pilots from PAAF, today the town of Perry is being well represented in all sections of the globe."
