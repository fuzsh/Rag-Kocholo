        "text": "The 1918 railroad depot has been brought up to date as a retail-office space, anchored on one end by Doodads & Delights – a store filled with antiques and country-themed items – and on the other by the Toasted Mug Coffee Shop, which has a hip Greenwich Village vibe along with shakes, homemade soups, and light lunches. Between the two sits the Taylor County Development Authority, which not only made the depot restoration possible, but has created a whole new world just outside its doors.\n\nReclaiming several acres where boxcars once departed with cargos of timber, land has been transformed into a park of boardwalks, ponds, streams, and pavilions. It’s a picturesque scene and an inviting place to take a walk or enjoy a picnic. The depot and the park can be seen as part of the Historic Trail, a 1.2-mile walking (or driving) tour that connects to the commercial district several blocks away. That’s where you’ll find the historic Perry Bank building, now home of the Taylor County Historical Society. Since 1971 this is where visitors, researchers, and armchair historians have come to study and share documents, photographs, memorabilia, and historical artifacts that chronicle Taylor County’s heritage, including fossils and information on local native tribes. If you miss the museum (open from 1-5 p.m. on Thursdays only) their detailed website is impressive.\n\nAny time of the day, though, there’s living history right all around you, although the modern courthouse doesn’t have nearly the appeal of its classic counterparts in nearby Madison and Jefferson counties. Radiating out from the courthouse, the rest of the downtown district is where you’ll find local institutions like the Perry News Herald (established 1889) and Johnson’s Bakery, which has been serving its customers right since 1954. (Their doughnuts are legendary). On the corner, Wilson’s O’Quinn Pharmacy is another throwback, as is the Old Taylor County Jail (the oldest public building in Taylor County) and the WPA-era Old Perry Post Office. Entrepreneurs attracted by wonderful old buildings, many of them vacant, many for sale, and all in need of new life, have bet on themselves to create businesses like the Backdoor Bistro & Coffeehouse, the Coco & Co. Boutique, and the Chic & Pink Shop.\n\nFor many travelers, Perry’s highlight is the Forest Capital Museum State Park. With more than half a million acres of forest, in 1965 Taylor County Florida was dubbed the “Tree Capital of the South” and this combination park and museum attests to that.\n\nThe museum shares the history of logging in the region and describes, incredibly, how the area’s longleaf pines contribute to the manufacturing of more than 5,000 products. From the museum you’ll enter a Cracker Village that, in 1863, was home, sweet home, for the Whiddon family. Their original cabin, barn, kettlehouse and smokehouse, created from hand-hewn logs, are here, giving visitors an idea of how they – and hundreds of other pioneer families – lived in the backwoods of frontier Florida."
