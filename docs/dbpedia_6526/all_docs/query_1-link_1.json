As of the 2020 census, the population was 21,796.[1] Its county seat is Perry.[2] The county hosts the annual Florida Forest Festival and has been long known as the \"Tree Capital of the South\" since a 1965 designation from then-Governor W. Haydon Burns.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nTaylor County was created on December 23, 1856, from Madison County. It was named for Zachary Taylor, twelfth president of the United States, who served from 1849 to 1850. Taylor won most counties in northern Florida during the election of 1848 and was largely responsible for the ultimate U.S. victory in the Second Seminole War.[4]\n\nDuring the American Civil War, Taylor County was home to William Strickland and his band of deserters and Unionists called \"The Royal Rangers\" or the \"Independent Rangers\".[5] In 1864, a Confederate colonel tasked with hunting down deserters, broke into Strickland's home and found a membership list of 35 men who \"bear true allegiance to the United States of America.\" Despite their names being identified and homes burned to the ground, few members of the Rangers surrendered.[6]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has a total area of 1,232 square miles (3,190 km2), of which 1,043 square miles (2,700 km2) is land and 189 square miles (490 km2) (15.3%) is water.[7]\n\nAdjacent counties\n\n[edit]\n\nJefferson County, Florida - northwest\n\nMadison County, Florida - north\n\nLafayette County, Florida - east\n\nDixie County, Florida - southeast\n\nNational protected area\n\n[edit]\n\nSt. Marks National Wildlife Refuge (part)\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 18601,384—18701,4535.0%18802,27956.8%18902,122−6.9%19003,99988.5%19107,10377.6%192011,21957.9%193013,13617.1%194011,565−12.0%195010,416−9.9%196013,16826.4%197013,6413.6%198016,53221.2%199017,1113.5%200019,25612.5%201022,57017.2%202021,796−3.4%2023 (est.)21,582[8]−1.0%\n\n2020 census\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.
