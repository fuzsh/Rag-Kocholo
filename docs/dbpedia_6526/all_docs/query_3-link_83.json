        "text": "INTRODUCTION\n\nTaylor Countyâ€™s Virtual Instruction Program (TC-VIP) is open to all eligible students within the district. TC-VIP is an innovative educational experience that takes place in an interactive learning environment created through technology. The Taylor County Public School (TCPS) district remains steadfast to a commitment of excellence. All grades earned through participation in TC-VIP will be assigned by the Virtual School instructors and not the local teachers. Grades will be sent electronically to the district office for upload to FOCUS for transcripts and report cards. It is very important for parents and students to have ongoing dialogue with the Virtual School instructors to ensure there is no miscommunication about your child's academic performance while participating in these online programs.\n\nVISION STATEMENT\n\nThe students of Taylor County School District will receive a rigorous and relevant education that prepares them to be college and career ready.\n\nPANHANDLE AREA EDUCATIONAL CONSORTIUM (PAEC FLVS FRANCHISE)\n\nServes member districts by helping them to fulfill their virtual classroom needs. Every district has different needs for their students and virtual courses allow the flexibility to fulfill many of those needs. This is for PART - time or FULL - time participation, as well as, one way for students to satisfy the graduation requirement for an online course.\n\nTo enroll or learn more about Virtual School Options, contact Mrs. Pam Padgett at (850) 223-4410 or email at Pam.Padgett@taylor.k12.fl.us .\n\nFlorida Department of Education Virtual Education Webpage:"
