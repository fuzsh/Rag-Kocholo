        "text": "Keaton Beach is located in \"The Big Bend\" on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which is part of Taylor County's \"Nature Coast\". Keaton Beach is 17 miles south of Perry and 17 miles north of Steinhatchee on CR 361, the \"Scenic Coastal Loop\". Taylor County's coastline consists of over 150 miles, with 85% of it unspoiled and owned by the State of Florida. The waters of Taylor County have been designated as \"Pristine\" by the Florida Wildlife Conservation Commission. There are 82,000 acres of State Wildlife Management Areas that are available for hunting, fishing, or wildlife watching.\n\nOur coastal areas include oyster reefs, salt marshes, sponge beds and underwater meadows. Taylor County's Gulf coast also provides great opportunities for fishing, scalloping, bird watching, kayaking, and recreational boating. The wildlife includes otters, osprey, bald eagles, bobcats, panthers, wild pigs, turkeys and many other coastal species.\n\nThe \"Beaches Area\" encompasses Spring Warrior,.Adams Beach, Dekle Beach, Boggy Bay, Ezell Beach, Keaton Beach, Cedar Island, Dark Island, Fish Creek and Hagans Cove. The Beaches Area has a laid-back, relaxed atmosphere. While we do not have wide, white, sandy beaches, we do have a few natural beaches and one man-made beach at the tip of Keaton Beach.\n\nKeaton Beach offers a beautiful beach, with shaded picnic pavilions, rest rooms, a 700 ft fishing pier and new public boat ramp. We're known for our quiet laid back atmosphere and beautiful sunsets.\n\nIf you've never scalloped, Keaton Beach is the place to do it! Taylor County is one of only five counties in Florida where scalloping is still allowed. Scalloping, which begins in July and ends September 10th, is something the whole family will love to do. All you need are the warm, clear waters of the Taylor County Gulf, a dive flag, some snorkel equipment, and a mesh bag (a boat or guide will also be useful). If you plan on visiting during scallop season, please be aware that because it is such a popular sport, most people make reservations several months in advance, due to the limited number of accommodations at Keaton Beach.\n\nHagen's Cove, located on the Gulf, approximately five miles south of Keaton Beach, is State owned and maintained. Here you'll find picnic pavilions, hiking trails, and an observation tower. Because of the shallow waters and grass flats, you'll find several species of fish and birds, horseshoe crabs, and even the occasional eagle.\n\nHickory Mound Wildlife Management Area is a great place to view waterfowl, raptors and the occasional alligator.\n\nTaylor County, a part of Florida's \"Nature Coast\" was established in 1856, and has a wealth of natural beauty and resources. Perry is the county seat, and the central hub of road and rail transportation. Approximately 90% of Taylor County land area is forest, supporting the county's primary industry of wood processing and many outdoor recreational opportunities. The area is varied, including coastline, rolling hills, rivers, lakes, as well as forest."
