        "text": "Help for Those Arrested in Taylor County\n\nTaylor County is located is located along the Gulf Coast of Florida just under the panhandle. Taylor is surrounded by Dixie, Lafayette, Madison and Jefferson counties. The county was named after the United State’s President, Zachary Taylor who served between 1849 and 1850.\n\nThe county seat of Taylor is the city of Perry, which is located approximately fifty miles southeast of Tallahassee. The city was renamed three times before it became known as Perry. The city was originally named Rosehead by the Native American Indians and did so because there were wild rose bushes found throughout the area. Eventually, in 1875, the city’s name was changed to Perrytown. Not long after, the city became known as simply ‘Perry’.\n\nHow to Find Out if Someone Has Been Arrested\n\nAn arrest is usually not expected and rarely considered a concern until it happens. Unfortunately, making the decision on whether or not to bail someone out of jail does not allow much time. And the average individual has no idea on how to go about doing so until they have had to go through the bond process at least once.\n\nWho Can Bail Someone Out of Jail?\n\nThe person who arranges for a pretrial inmate’s release is called an ‘indemnitor’. Anyone who is age 18 or over and has a driver’s license, official state ID or passport can post a bond for someone who has been arrested. However, keep in mind, an indemnitor is responsible for making sure the pretrial defendant who has been released from jail will show up for all court appearances after posting bond.\n\nHow Long After Posting Bail is Inmate Released?\n\nOnce an inmate has completed the booking process (fingerprints and mugshots) and bail has been posted or a bail bond application has been completed, it typically takes anywhere from two to twelve hours for their release. After a bond has been posted by a bondsman or full bail is paid to the court’s clerk, much of the final release process is dependent upon the jail’s administrative staff.\n\nAny Hour Bail Bonds\n\nIf someone you care about has been arrested in Perry or anywhere in Taylor County, FL, call or text a bail bondsman any time at (352)-500-9999\n\nCan You Post Bail Online?\n\nIf you are planning to pay for a bond with a credit or debit card, our online bail bond application makes the entire bail bond application process a breeze.
