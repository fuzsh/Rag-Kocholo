        "text": "Dear Parents/Guardians:\n\nThank you for the opportunity to transport your children to and from school. We take pride in our district and want to provide a safe ride for all our students.\n\nThe Transportation Department needs the support of our parents to explain the importance of bus expectations. We ask you to go over the Bus Rules with your children. It is important for everyone involved to understand we are committed to providing every student a safe, enjoyable ride to/from school. Without help from home, this would not be possible. Remember, our Taylor County School Board has adopted a plan that will result in loss of bus privileges for repeat violators of Bus Safety Rules. It only takes ONE student distracting their bus driver to endanger the safety of all students.\n\nParents, please refrain from trying to board a school bus for any reason. Our Drivers/Staff can be reached at 838-2505. For the safety of everyone, each bus is equipped with a camera system. We randomly view video for quality assurance & training purposes. If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to contact our department.
