        "text": "Taylor County is a county with a population of around 22,600 located on the panhandle of Florida and bordering the Gulf of Mexico. The area is just southeast of Tallahassee, and the county seat is Perry. The county was formed in 1856 from Madison County. Taylor County is named after the 12th President of the United States, Zachary Taylor.\n\nThere are many things that set Taylor County apart from other counties in Florida. The county is known as the Pine Tree Capital of the South, and the name is well earned. The county has been home to a thriving timber industry for many years. Residents and visitors alike celebrate this fact by gathering each year at the Florida Forest Festival. The festival has been celebrated for more than 50 years, and many families come to enjoy the music, arts and crafts, and events.\n\nTaylor County is also the center of a vibrant music scene. Each April, music lovers from all over come to Perry to attend the Florida State Bluegrass Festival which is home to a statewide competition and lots of great music. There are also many wonderful outdoor activities to partake in as well in Taylor County. Hiking and boating opportunities abound at Hickory Mound, Tide Swamp, and Snipe Island. All of these ideal locations provide many opportunities for locals to enjoy the beauty that surrounds them, and to view the wild roses for which the area is famous.\n\nAt the center of the timber and music industries, and with a unique beauty that stretches from the gulf to the northernmost parts of the county, Taylor County is an exciting and joyful place to live."
