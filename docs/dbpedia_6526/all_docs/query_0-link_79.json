        "text": "State Archives Historian Dr. Josh Goodman presented archival evidence at Monday night’s Taylor County Historical Society meeting that Perry is at least a decade older than previously believed, contradicting the age-old tale of how Perry came to be.\n\nFor as long as most can remember, the story has always been that Perry started out as a town called Rosehead, founded in 1869 and named after the wild roses that grew on the banks of nearby creeks. The name Perry did not officially come along until 1875 — or so the story goes.\n\nIn reviewing archival evidence, including maps, official state and county records and correspondence with the postal service, Goodman found that Perry may be much older than Rosehead.\n\nGoodman is a Florida State University graduate, has a Ph.D. in history from Tulane University and is a staff historian at the State Archives of Florida. Having grown up in Taylor County, Goodman is passionate about the area and has been working on a monographic\n\nbook on the history of Taylor County for 10 years.\n\n“As you can imagine, one of the things that came up in the research was trying to figure out the origins of Perry, the origins of the county seat, how it got started, how the street grid was laid out, and what do we do with this thing called ‘Rosehead’ that has made it into beautiful illustrations, songs, poetry and even the names of local businesses?” Goodman said.\n\nGoodman went on a search for contemporary documents that would show Rosehead was established in 1869 and Perry came along in 1875, but found proof that the original story was not entirely accurate.\n\nGoodman showed the audience a map of Perry printed by cartographer J. H. Colton with an “1868” print date — pre-dating the establishment of Rosehead — that he uncovered during his search.\n\nGoodman had also found the oldest known map of Perry in paperwork belonging to James Wentworth. Handwritten on the map by James Wentworth himself was the date “1870.”\n\nAs Goodman spoke, a handwritten document came into focus on the presentation screen behind him. Goodman explained the significance of the document as it was the discovery that confirmed Perry existed long before Rosehead.\n\nThe document was a deed between William McMullen and Joseph H. Sappington for Lot 5 in Section 6 of the Town of Perry — dated Aug. 6, 1859. A wave of gasps and whispers rippled through the audience as the new information was revealed.\n\n“That was not the only one. There are about a dozen town lots that were deeded to people in the 1850s and early 1860s in the Town of Perry. There are legal documents signed by John C. Calhoun when they did the transcripts in the early 1900s that confirm these documents are accurate,” Goodman said.\n\n“Based on these documents, because the area was being recorded repeatedly as the ‘Town of Perry,’ it is very clear there was a town here called ‘Perry’ at least as early as 1859,” Goodman said.\n\nWhat Goodman found raised questions about when exactly Perry was established, when Rosehead was established, what Rosehead was supposed to be and how the story became so confused.\n\nAccording to archival records, Alan O’Quinn applied for a Rosehead post office on Feb. 11, 1869. To be approved for a post office at this time, it had to be proven the new post office was located far enough away from other existing post offices that it would be a burden for the people in the area of the new post office to get to the other post offices. Applicants also had to give a very precise location of where the post office was going to be and had to explain how the mail carrier was going to get things to the new post office.\n\n“Alan O’Quinn wrote on his application that the Rosehead post office was to be in the northwest quarter of section five. Guess where that is? Not in Perry. Not in Perry at all, it is miles away. It is in Pisgah, another very old and very prominent settlement in Taylor County,” Goodman said.\n\n“I swear,” one member of the audience gasped.\n\nGoodman said the reason county officials would apply for the only post office at this time to be located so far away from the courthouse can be found in three clues. He presented to the audience three orders: one for an election for the removal of Perry as the county seat; one granting citizens the right to remove trees from the streets of Perry; and an order for town lot owners to give up their titles for re-selling.\n\n“It looks like they were not happy with where the county seat was in 1869. We can assume from all of this, that even though it was established in 1859, Perry had not developed to a point that people in the county thought it would be sustainable as a county seat,” Goodman explained.\n\nGoodman’s theory is that the residents of the county may have seen more potential in Pisgah as the site for the county seat.\n\n“Pisgah was where the first school was established, where the first wood-frame house was built, and it was a little bit closer to the greater population. That might explain why there might have been a movement to re-establish the county seat.\n\n“So how did all this confusion come about?” Goodman asked the audience.\n\nGoodman showed postal maps from 1869–1875 with Rosehead — not Perry — appearing near the center of Taylor County and said, “As far as the postal service was concerned, Perry did not exist because there was no official post office called ‘Perry’.”\n\nThe postal service did not officially recognize Perry until after December 1875, when the second assistant postmaster general from Washington sent a letter to Henry Tillman, the postmaster of Rosehead at that time, asking for clarification on the location of Rosehead and Perry.\n\nAccording to archival documents, Tillman wrote back, “Perry and Rosehead is one and the same place. By the same mistake, the post office was named Rosehead when it should have been named Perry. Perry is the county seat of Taylor County, Fla.”\n\nAs the presentation concluded, Goodman was asked, “Have you come across anything that indicates where the Rosehead legend of the flowers on the creek come from?”\n\n“The earliest indication I have comes from the writings of Taylor County resident W. T. Cash. He wrote that he heard the story from his mother, who lived through the establishment of Perry and its formative years,” Goodman said.\n\nGoodman’s discovery will bring changes to the Taylor County Historical Society and how the history of Perry is explained, society volunteer J.T. Davis said.\n\n“It will be an interesting story to tell. Everything we have in our collection has little connections to Rosehead, the maps, writings, tapestry. There are little roses sown into or etched on everything throughout the history of Perry,” Davis said.\n\nHe believes the reason the name Rosehead stuck with the town of Perry was because everyone referred to the town as “Rosehead,” as evidenced in the writings and artifacts at the Historical Society. “The legal documents may have said it was the Town of Perry, but to the locals, it was always Rosehead.”"
