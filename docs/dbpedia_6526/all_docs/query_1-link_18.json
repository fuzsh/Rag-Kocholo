Always sparsely populated, the county had seen a steady population decline begin in the 1930’s and continue in the 1940’s. There was little hope of reversing the trend without an industrial base for the economy. The outlook was bleak. County leaders concluded that something had to be done.\n\nThat the “something” ought to involve the 570,000 acres of forest lands in the county was obvious, because Taylor County’s economy historically had been based on the tree.\n\nIn the late 1800’s and first 25 years of this century, the county became world known for its forest products. Railroads began to crisscross the county in the early 1900’s, providing mobility for the mushrooming timber industry. In 1914 Burton Swartz built the world’s largest cypress sawmill near Perry, the county seat. Eating up Gulf Red Cypress at the rate of 150,000 board feet daily, this mill operated for 30 years. A logging camp – Carbur, in southern Taylor County – which served Burton Schwartz and other mills, became the world’s largest logging camp.\n\nIn 1929, Brooks-Scanlon Corporation erected at Foley a milti-million dollar facility which became the largest sawmill ever to operate east of the Mississippi River, and 600,000 acres of virgin yellow pines in the area were on their way to being reduced to sawdust and high grade lumber.\n\nVirgin Timber Disappears\n\nIn the 1930’s, however, other operators began closing their sawmills as the virgin timber was disappearing. By 1940 the county’s growth rate was reversing. From a 1930 population of 13,000, the county decreased to 11.500 in 1940 and was to drop still more to 10,700 in 1945.\n\nHope for the future lay in the county’s second growth trees – wood of great value to the South’s growing pulp and paper industry. Brooks-Scanlon had started planting pines on some of its acreage in 1930. Other landowners had observed the fast and sturdy growth of these trees, and they liked what they saw. The concept of “tree farming” took hold, at first haltingly but then enthusiastically.\n\n(Florida Forest Service records show emphatic proof of that growing enthusiasm for “tree farming.” Between 1928 and 1965, Taylor County landowners planted 67 million trees in a reforestation program covering 120,000 acres. No other Florida county matched this record of reforestation. Taylor County now has a billion board feet of standing timber. Unquestionably, it deserves the title of “Tree Capital of the South” – as proclaimed by Govenor Haydon Burns in October, 1965.)\n\nViewing the county’s increasing suppliers of wood suitable for pulpwood and the abundance of forest land which could be reforested to provide long-term supplies of pulpwood, Taylor County leaders decided to attempt to attract a pulp mill to the county.\n\nThese leaders quickly determined that there were five “musts” for a suitable pulp mill site. Three of these were no problem: (1) the county could offer the necessary wood supply within a reasonable distance; (2) it had an ample supply of water for the manufacturing processes involved; and (3) there was a large pool of good potential employees for a mill.\n\nTwo Related Problems\n\nBut the other two “musts” posed related problems. Rail transportation was a necessity, and a pulp mill had to have some means of disposing of the wastes associated with pulp manufacturing.\n\nUnlike most other parts of Florida, Taylor County had no railroad lines along its coast. Thus, an inland site was indicated, and that site had to have a means of waste disposal. However, unlike other Southern communities then in the competitive race to attract new pulp mills. Taylor County had no stream with a water flow large enough to provide sufficient assimilative capacity for waste from a large pulp mill.\n\nMeanwhile, Brooks-Scanlon Corporation began considering construction of a pulp mill on a Foley site adjacent to the Fenholloway River. This site had the required rail transportation, but it was obvious that the Fenholloway’s flow was too small to assimilate manufacturing wastes from a pulp mill.\n\nA Decision is Reached\n\nIn 1947 Taylor County citizens came to a decision. Because Brooks-Scanlon was interested but also because they felt a Fenholloway site would be attractive to another company if Brooks-Scanlon decided not to build a pulp mill, they decided to ask the Florida Legislature to classify the Fenholloway as an “industrial stream” in order to establish an industrial base for a declining economy.\n\nTaylor County’s delegation took the request to the Florida Legislature in 1947 – with the solid backing of the citizenry – and the special act was passed without debate. (Chapter 24952, Laws of Florida, Acts of 1947)\n\nThe Act states, in part: “That every municipal corporation situated in Taylor County, Florida, and every person, firm or corporation operating any manufacturing or industrial plant in Taylor County, Florida, shall have and is hereby granted the right and is hererby empowered to discharge and deposit sewage, industrial and chemical wastes and effluents, or any of them, into the waters of the Fenholloway River, and the waters of the Gulf of Mexico into which said river flows.”\n\nThus, in 1947 – four years before Buckeye Cellulose Corporation came on the scene – the Legislature of the State of Florida at the initiative of the people of Taylor County declared that the Fenholloway River could be polluted legally.\n\nAnd all this was so Taylor County could get Brooks-Scanlon – or some company – to build a pulp mill on the Fenholloway and, thereby, go a long way toward solving a critical economic problem.\n\nII. BUCKEYE CELLULOSE: General Background\n\nBuckeye Cellulose Corporation. A wholly owned subsidiary of the Procter & Gamble Company, began business in 1901 as the Buckeye Cotton Oil Company. The latter was established by P&G to provide cottonseed oil for use in P&G products.\n\nThe story of how a mammoth pulp mill in North Florida developed from the crushing of cottonseed is a tribute to industrial research.\n\nDuring the second decade of this century, Buckeye directed considerable research against the development of commercial uses for the short fibers – linters – which cling to cottonseed after ginning. Buckeye believed there was possibility of using these linters to make pulp for paper and other uses.\n\nResearch proved that linters could be used to make a high grade cellulose pulp, and Buckeye began pulp production in Memphis, Tenn. in 1920. In addition to providing pulp for paper uses, Buckeye soon became a major supplier of dissolving cellulose pulp to the then-infant rayon industry. During the next 30 years as cellulose-consuming industries grew in size and number and the Southern cotton crop declined, Buckeye found it increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient supplies of linters to meet customers’ needs. The Company, therefore, turned its attention to a new source of raw material – the forest.\n\nResearch led the way. Years of experience in Buckeye’s Memphis research labs had resulted in the development of a superior process for making cellulose pulp from pine trees. With the needed technical knowledge in hand and customers’ future needs clear, Buckeye decided to build a wood pulp mill.\n\nPulp Mill Sites Surveyed\n\nSurveys were made of many possible sites in the United States and Canada beginning in early 1950. Taylor County was studied in 1951. Careful surveys showed that the Foley, Florida, site offered all the key conditions: wood availability, water supplies, excellent labor availability, rail transportation and – via the “industrial stream” zoning of the Fenholloway – a means of waste disposal.\n\nThat year Buckeye acquired the Foley property and some 440,000 acres of forest land from Brooks-Scanlon Corporation, that firm having earlier decided against constructing a pulp mill.\n\nPrior to a final decision to build a mill at Foley, officials of Buckeye and Procter & Gamble arranged a meeting in Perry with a large number of Taylor County’s governmental, business and civic leaders. These leaders were given a detailed picture of the advantages and disadvantages which the county could expect should Buckeye go ahead with construction.\n\nOnly after this “town meeting” -- after community leaders indicated their understanding and acceptance of the disadvantages, including the pollution of the Fenholloway – did Buckeye announce the decision to build at Foley.\n\nConstruction began in February, 1952, and the first finished product was turned out in June, 1954.\n\nBuckeye Land Holdings\n\nAs noted above, Buckeye acquired 440,000 acres of forest land from Brooks-Scanlon Corporation at the time the Foley property was purchased. Since 1951 Buckeye has increased its North Florida land ownership to about 900,000 acres in eight counties. Most of this additional acreages was acquired in large tracts, including three separate purchases of more than 100,000 acres each. (Ownership of very large acreage by individuals and corporations has been common in this part of the state for many years.)\n\nAll Buckeye land is open to the Florida public for hunting, fishing and other recreation.\n\nMuch of the land bought by Buckeye had been cut over earlier for saw timber and needed reforestation. Beginning in 1955, Buckeye began a reforestation program of clearing unproductive land and planting trees at the rate of 10,000 acres per year. This program is continuing at an accelerated rate of 15,000 to 20,000 acres per year.\n\nDespite its large land holdings, Buckeye now purchases a majority of the wood supply for the Foley mill from other landowners, and this heavy reliance on private sources is expected to continue. In 1966, the company’s expenditures for wood purchases from privately owned lands totaled more than $8,000,000.\n\n“Miracle Fiber” Serves the World\n\nBuckeye uses pines and hardwoods to produce a high alpha cellulose pulp which goes into the manufacture of literally hundreds of modern products.\n\nThis “miracle fiber” is finished at the Foley plant in large white sheets which resemble large ink blotters. In fact, one day’s production at the Foley mill would make a sheet of pulp 14 feet wide and almost 200 miles long.\n\nCellulose and materials obtained from it are used in countless products which touch the daily lives of people worldwide. Most familiar is the use of cellulose in paper or in fabrics for clothing, but it also serves as the raw material for many chemical industries. A few of the materials obtained from cellulose processes are:\n\nYarn – Rayon for clothing, fabrics, carpets, auto seat covers, tire cord,\n\nfilters for cigarettes.\n\nFilm – Cellophane, photographic and x-ray films.\n\nPlastics – Hundreds of articles in everyday use – toys, kitchen\n\ncontainers, tools, automobile parts, writing pens, drafting\n\ntools, steering wheels, signs, eye glass frames.\n\nLacquers – Quick drying lacquers used as spray-coatings for cars\n\nand other vehicles, and clear moisture-proof coatings for\n\ncellophane.\n\nExplosives – Explosive material which is used in dynamite and\n\nsmokeless powder.\n\nPaper – Endless number of products, such as books, magazines,\n\nboxes, papers, packages, wrappers – and now even paper\n\nclothing.\n\nIII. TAYLOR COUNTY AND BUCKEYE: Growing Together\n\nAs Taylor County and Buckeye Cellulose moved well into their second decade of growing together, it was apparent that the primary expectations of both in 1951 had been achieved.\n\nTaylor County in 1951 sought to revive its economy and halt its population decline. While having one of its many streams zoned as “industrial” to make it possible to attract a pulp mill, Taylor County had offered no other inducements to secure a new industry (at a time when throughout the South it was common for states and communities to offer free land and buildings, special tax deductions, etc.).\n\nIn turn. Buckeye in 1951 sought a good industrial site with room for growth. While asking no special considerations from the community, Buckeye did make it clear that the 1947 “industrial stream” act was an all-important factor in the decision to build. Had not the Fenholloway been available for waste disposal, the mill would have been built elsewhere in the United States.\n\nExpansion Since 1954\n\nSince Buckeye’s first Foley mill went into operation in 1954, three major expansions, including a second complete mill, and several minor expansions have more than doubled the original production capacity.\n\nBuckeye now employs about 875 men and women and has an annual payroll of about $7,500,000. The Company’s annual expenditures in the area for payrolls, wood purchases, taxes, local purchases, etc., total well over $20,000,000 per year. More than 50 per cent of all taxes collected by Taylor County are paid by Buckeye.\n\nBuckeye has followed a continuing policy of employing and training area residents for the operating jobs at the mill and in its woodlands. The result is that more than 80 per cent of present employees were hired from the immediate area of Taylor County. Foley employees, incidentally, have annual incomes exceeding the national average for the pulp and paper industry, as well as the national average for all manufacturing.\n\nThe Foley plant now uses some 650,000 cords of pine and hardwoods per year, most of which is bought from other forest landowners in Florida and South Georgia. It is estimated that about 1,000 persons are employed in the harvesting labor forces of the independent contractors who sell wood to Buckeye. In this and many other ways, the economic impact of Buckeye’s operation extends well beyond Taylor County.\n\nTaylor County Prospers\n\nObviously, Taylor County citizens had certain beliefs and expectations in 1947 when – via passage of the ‘industrial stream’ act – they extended an invitation to the pulp and paper industry to come to the county. Have these beliefs and expectations been supported and fulfilled?\n\nHere are some of the key indices of growth since Buckeye came on the Taylor County scene in 1951:\n\n1951 1966\n\nPopulation: County 10,400 14,000\n\nPerry 2,800 10,000\n\nBank Deposits: $2,200,000 $17,114,000\n\nPerry Building Permits: $85,000 $904,000\n\nPerry Business Licenses: 192 505\n\nSales Tax Collections: $62,000 $526,000\n\nAuto Vehicle Registrations: 3,145 7,168\n\nThere are many other growth facts which show the positive effects of a large and stable industry:\n\nTaylor County had no hospital in 1951. Now it has a 50-bed hospital\n\nwhich in 1967 will begin an expansion program costing about\n\n$1,000,000.\n\nSince 1951 a new high school and elementary school have been built.\n\nCurrent school expansion programs will cost $1,500,000, including an\n\nultra-modern, fully air-conditioned new junior high school costing\n\n$490,000. (The State of Florida is building a $325,000 vocational-\n\ntechnical school in Taylor County.)\n\nA new $400,000 Taylor County court house is on the drawing board,\n\nand construction is expected to begin during 1967.\n\nAs a follow-up to the 1965 designation of Taylor County as “Tree\n\nCapital of the South,” 1966 saw an all-out community program to\n\ndevelop a Forest Capital Park on a large site on U. S. Highway 19\n\nprovided by the Taylor County Development Authority. City and\n\ncounty funds totaling $250,000 have been allocated to build a\n\ncommunity civic and recreation center – Forest Capital Hall – on this\n\nsite. The Center will be completed in September, 1967.\n\nThe U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare in May, 1966\n\nmade a $21,000 grant for a planning study for the possible location of\n\na Resource-Use Education Center in Taylor County in conjunction\n\nwith the Forest Capital Park Project. The Taylor County\n\nDevelopment Authority then made an additional 118-acre tract of\n\nland available for the Resource-Use Education Center. The planning\n\nstudy, completed in December, 1966, recommended a $1 million\n\ndollar center to teach conservation-resource-use subjects to students\n\nand teachers from all over Florida as part of the State School\n\nProgram. A request was made to HEW in January, 1966 for $191,000\n\nfor the first phase development of the program. State, regional and\n\nnational authorities are excited about the project and predict a final\n\ndevelopment to exceed the present $1 million recommendation.\n\nIn 1955 Taylor countians initiated an annual Pine Tree Festival to\n\nhonor the county’s economic strength – the tree. That first year about\n\n5,000 persons attended the Festival. In 1965, the attendance was\n\nestimated at 50,000.\n\nBecause forestry is of such vital importance to the entire economy of\n\nFlorida, many governmental, civic and business leaders of the state\n\nproposed that the Pine Tree Festival become a state-wide celebration.\n\nTaylor countians – in keeping with these suggestions – held the first\n\nannual Florida Forest Festival in Perry in October, 1966. The Festival\n\nmoved to widespread acceptance and success in just one year and was\n\nnamed the state’s top public relations project by the Florida Public\n\nRelations Association.\n\nAs Taylor County approached the 20th anniversary of that 1947 decision to move to reverse the course of its economy, there were signs on all sides of unbounded optimism about the county’s chances for continuing and growing economic prosperity in the years ahead.\n\nIV. TAYLOR COUNTY RECREATION: Natural and Man-Made\n\n“With its facilities for hunting, fishing, boating, swimming, and\n\ngolfing, Taylor county is becoming a mecca for sportsmen.”\n\n(from a daily newspaper story)\n\nA major factor in Taylor County’s 1947 willingness to zone the tiny\n\nFenholloway River as an “industrial stream” was the abundance of water-based recreation in the immediate area, plus the overall availability of other recreation.\n\nBuckeye’s own strong interest in multiple use of the forests and its desire to increase the recreational facilities of Taylor County brought a steady improvement from 1951 through 1966. And there’s still more in the planning stages."
