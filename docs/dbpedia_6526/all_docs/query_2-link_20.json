        "text": "Taylor County, Florida is located close to the panhandle in the northwest part of the state. According to recent statistics the population of the county is just shy of 20,000 people. The county seat is located in Perry, Florida which is home to the county courthouse. Taylor county is part of Florida’s Third Judicial Circuit which includes Columbia, Dixie, Hamilton, Lafayette, Madison and Suwanne counties. There is one county and one circuit court Judge assigned to the county. County Court Judge Stephen Murphy has been on the county bench since 1985 and is currently assigned to listen to all misdemeanors and traffic ticket cases. Circuit Court Judge James Roy Bean is based in Dixie and Taylor counties. Judge Bean has been a Circuit Court Judge on and off since June of 1992.\n\nTaylor county has an extremely active law enforcement community. Last year there were close to 3,000 moving violations issued within the county, most being issued by the Florida Highway Patrol for speeding. Other moving violations, including red light and careless driving tickets were the majority of the tickets issued in the county according to the DHSMV.\n\nAside from civil traffic infractions, law enforcement in Taylor County issued over 600 criminal tickets last year. Not surprisingly most of the criminal violations were for driving while license suspended and no valid driver’s license.
