        "text": "Taylor County was created in 1856 out of Madison County and named after the twelfth President of the United States of America, Zachary Taylor. The county seat was first named Rosehead by the early Native Americans because of the abundance of beautiful wild rose bushes which grew in the area. In 1875 the name was changed to Perrytown after Governor Stark Perry. However later on the name would undergo another change when the \"town\" was dropped and the name was simply Perry.\n\nThe first courthouse was built in 1858 and was constructed out of logs, later in 1923, the first frame built courthouse was built. By the turn of the twentieth century, Taylor County was the home of a widely known and celebrated resort hotel built on the site of a sulfurous spring. With the belief that these sulfur springs offered some healing abilities many of the wealthiest people from around the country made the journey to Taylor County to experience the sulfur springs. The resort offered many luxurious experiences including a swimming pool, tennis courts, and a golf course.\n\nSpanning over 1,200 square miles, the county is nestled in the \"Big Bend\" area of the state and offers some of the best hunting and fishing in the state of Florida. Having one of the longest coastlines in the state Taylor County offers some of the best saltwater fishing also with fishing tournaments being held each year.\n\nIf you decide to visit Taylor County you won't be disappointed."
