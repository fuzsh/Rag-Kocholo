        "text": "Ag Literacy Day\n\nAg Literacy Day is an annual reading event sponsored by Florida’s Ag in the Classroom program. Each year a new book is chosen by Florida Ag in the Classroom to read to students throughout the state. Taylor County Farm Bureau and its Women’s Committee and community volunteers visit classrooms at Perry Primary School and read to the students about agriculture. Every year there is a “make and take” activity where students will learn about agriculture. Hands-on activities include making butter or planting seeds. The annual event is a fun way to get children to learn about the importance of agriculture. More than 900 volunteers participate in Ag Literacy Day statewide."
