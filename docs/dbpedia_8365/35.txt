Peter McArdle is an artist based in Newcastle upon Tyne, a former member of the Stuckist art group and co - director of NCA (Newcastle Contemporary Arts) formerly Baltic 39. Recent exhibitions include: Everybody knows this is nowhere: Painting in the Northeast now - A survey exhibition curated by Dr Narbi Price & ‘X’ at NCA Gallery.

McArdle makes connections between the narratives, devices and formal qualities of art history and the everyday images we consume and produce. In doing so he attempts to see the history of painting and the digital image afresh. His work also emphasizes the atemporal dimension of contemporary visual culture and considers how relationship to history and the present has been irrevocably altered by the digital image.
