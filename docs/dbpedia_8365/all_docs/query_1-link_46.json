He continues to train and coach with the club 4 times a week, attends competitions accross the UK and also in Hungary. He gives up his spare time to officate at competitions and most recently he has been helping to introduce younger athletics into the club. His poor wife had to wait around 5 years for the promised Baltic Cruise as the dates kept clashing with his athletics commitments and Trevor would never miss one. He has helped people train to get up to the required fitness level for police entry. He is truly a remarkable man with real commitment to athletics. When not coaching or competing, Trevor loves to watch the athletics on the tv. He already has high hopes that his 1 year old Grandaughter will follow in his footsteps and be interested in athletics. Trevor has promised to cut down on his training for several years but is still showing no signs of slowing down. It would be a great honour for him to carry the olympic torch and a very proud moment for us to watch him.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=trevor-madigan-3897/index.htmlAberdeen25/06/201267http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-12/index.htmlForfar12/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=forfar/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/97D5-AFE6-7049-834F.jpg\n\n8\n\nSteve O,neill(Wood Group) Steve O'Neill is a senior project engineer and has worked for Wood Group for more than six years.

I really look up to Olympic athletes because of their skills and dedication. They are such an inspiration to me, watching them makes me want to take part in many sports. I do play individual sports, but I also like being part of a team and helping my friends have more fun. When I'm not in the team, I go and support them and cheer them on. I think it is important to play sport even if you don't win very often. The dedication of the Olympic athletes is a good lesson for me so I must try my best at all times. Carrying the torch will act as a reminder to try my hardest at everything I do for the rest of my life.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=thomas-richardson-1982/index.htmlAlcester25/06/201215http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-01/index.htmlStratford-Upon-Avon01/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=stratford-upon-avon/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/CFBE-8122-C016-3041.jpg\n\n10\n\nSharon Culpepperhttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=sharon-culpepper-2664/index.htmlAlpharetta25/06/201246http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-23/index.htmlThe London Borough of Merton23/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-merton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/2EF2-BE24-02B0-BA4D.jpg\n\n11\n\nZenon OrdoÃ±ez CarcarI've been a sports lover since childhood, and I've been a runner for the last ten years. I became a member of the 360 RIOJA RUNNERS club two and a half years ago, with whom we take part in different races, but the one that stands out par excellence for me, is the BEHOBIA-SAN SEBASTIAN half-marathon. This year will be my third time as a participant. The first one was very special, but the one I feel most proud of is the second time, as I was able to coach my workmate Maria Rosa, who isn't an habitual runner. Maria Rosa Garcia Lorente says: I'm so lucky to know ZenÃ³n, someone who on a daily basis really feels the Olympic values of sacrifice, honesty and hard graft. To carry the Olympic Torch would be very befitting of him, and would be a dream come true, just like it was for me to run the BEHOBIA race, something I only achieved thanks to his support.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=zenon-crispulo-ordonez-carcar-2443/index.htmlAndosilla25/06/201244http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-23/index.htmlBlackburn23/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=blackburn/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/54A0-0C46-A927-0F43.jpg\n\n12\n\nSue Williamshttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=susan-williams-6944/index.htmlAshford25/06/201256http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-23/index.htmlThe London Borough of Merton23/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-merton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/0122-0190-D8BF-4B48.jpg\n\n13\n\nTalan Skeels-pigginsWhen Talan taught in my school he was the only teacher that got me interested and enjoying rugby, this was before he had his accident. Since having the accident he has become even more inspirational a lot more people. He has just retired from competitive skiing after taking part in two world championships and a winter Paralympics for Team GB. He is now coaching skiing to both the disabled and able bodied person, mentoring current athletes, and he is going into schools talking about disability awareness and the opportunities that it can provide. Recently Talan has set up a charity (The Bike Experience), in this charity it teaches disabled motorcyclists to get back on the bike using specially adapted motorcycles. If anything Talan has become more of an inspiration after his accident than before. This is the reason for being nominated, for not giving up.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=talan-skeels-piggins-1417/index.htmlAshtead25/06/201241http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-05-22/index.htmlBath22/05/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=bath/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/11C7-5F30-87A7-B94D.jpg\n\n14\n\nThora BeddardThora Beddard aged 93 - going on 21: Throughout her life Thora has continuously supported and truly inspired those around her. Thora continues to have considerable influence on all who come into contact with her including her 8 grandchildren, 23 great-grandchildren and 6 great-great grandchildren. Her life is such a rich tapestry. Amongst other things, she has done: At 50 Thora learnt to swim; aged 60 she discovered yoga; on turning 70, in search of something more challenging Thora chose abseiling and later modelled lingerie for the older generation on live TV; in her 80's Thora passed her English GCSE and aged 84 carried the Commonwealth batten in Manchester. Recently, aged 90, she was invited to London to feature in Good Housekeeping magazine about inspirational females with her 9 year old great-granddaughter. A regular visitor to the frail and 'old', Thora is extremely active in her local community. Having penned 6,000 poems and produced many other written articles, 'Thora' speeches (fundraising for charity in memory of her daughter) are legendary and even the broken leg Thora suffered last Christmas didn't daunt her. She reminds us all that she has: \"never ever been bored - as she's always made sure she's too busy to be bored\". Thora is an outstanding candidate to carry the Olympic batten and it would be a fitting tribute to an astonishing individual, whose life represents an ideal example of munificence, fighting spirit, determination and success to everyone of us.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=thora-beddard-460/index.htmlAshton-under-lyne25/06/201294http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-24/index.htmlOldham24/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=oldham/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/EB65-EAA5-AAF7-2941.jpg\n\n15\n\nShara Bricehttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=shara-brice-5819/index.htmlAspen25/06/201242http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-23/index.htmlThe London Borough of Wandsworth23/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-wandsworth/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/94A2-EA2F-1782-5C4D.jpg\n\n16\n\nRaymond TownsendLast year my grandad was given the Lifetime Achievement Sports Award for Pendle area and then for the whole of Lancashire. He has played and worked for Pendle Forest Sports Club for 59 years. During that time he has captained 3 cricket teamsand 2 football teams, playing football until he was 45 and cricket until he was 61 .At different times he has been club secretary, treasurer,and now president. He was cricket secretary for 25 years and organised a district junior cricket league for 26 years. Since 1971 he has organised a '200 club'- a weekly draw which has raised over Â£50,000 for club funds. In the past 8 years he has helped start up junior cricket teams for P. F.S.C. He taught me to play cricket and his enthusiasm has rubbed off on me and many other boys. He now umpires, is volunteer cricket grounds man and scores if needed. P.S .Although he had a new knee last year I'm sure, with a bit of training, he would be able to jog the distance with the torch!!.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=raymond-townsend-864/index.htmlBarnoldswick25/06/201276http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-22/index.htmlLancaster22/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=lancaster/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/3DAF-2026-1AD1-F041.jpg\n\n17\n\nSimon PaddonSimon organises the Devon Coast to Coast Challenge - a yearly cycle event for charity across Devon. Total raised so far Â£90,000, and this year's event looks to add to that with another Â£35,000 (once all in) - pushing the grand total to over Â£100,000 for local Hospices. 375 riders took part this year- the biggest field yet. The cyclists ride either the 100km or the 100 miles route, with communal breaks to make it a social event. The event also has it's own branding, with it's own logo and cycle top - over 150 tops having been sold so far. Simon is in the process of trade marking the event, such is it's popularity - other charities have tried to copy the idea and name. Simon is proud to say that he was a winner of a Making a Difference Award in 2010, and has since grown the event even further; this is, in no small part, having been inspired to make the event bigger by the 2010 Awards. Simon is known locally as 'the bike ride guy', and regularly gives 100 hours+ a year to build this event into a credible and family based event. It has a unique place in cycle events, being a true challenge - no times are given, and people are encouraged to be social, and support each other - bringing the community of riders closer together. The opportunity to carry the Olympic Flame would be a personal thank you for all the hard work that he has done.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=simon-paddon-6981/index.htmlBarnstaple25/06/201242http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-05-19/index.htmlStenalees19/05/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=stenalees/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/F342-6219-918D-5147.jpg\n\n18\n\nSimeon WakelyWhen I first met Simeon in 2006, he was a very shy retiring child, anxious and extremely lacking in self confidence, but he was determined to learn to swim. However, being severely disabled from birth, his level of disability meant he had a real struggle - he sinks better than he floats!! However it wasn't long before his cheeky, bubbly personality began to shine through and he developed a fierce determination to become as independent as possible in the water. All along the way he rose to the challenges presented to him and always came up smiling in the end. As a testament to his increased confidence and his willingness to look beyond himself and use his abilities for the benefit of others, in 2009 he decided off his own bat, to do a fund-raising wheelchair push round the streets near his home and raised Â£1,100 for charity. Despite the severity of his disability he has since gone on to participate in other sports including wheelchair tennis and now basketball. Even though health problems mean he is not the strongest athlete and could never reach a highly competitive level, he is a shining example of what can be achieved with determination, enthusiasm and application despite the challenges of a disability.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=simeon-wakely-500/index.htmlBath25/06/201215http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-05-22/index.htmlBitton22/05/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=bitton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/D121-BFEB-2AFE-7C49.jpg\n\n19\n\nSean MaloughDavid Sean Malough (known as Sean) is our Local Hero who has earned the honour to carry the flame for his work leading Duke of Edinburgh Gold Award expeditions and physical skills, and leading the local Scout group.

In recent years, she has been the dynamo behind a huge campaign to build a regional facility in Brentwood - this will finally be completed in Autumn 2011 with a fantastic dedicated hall that will also feature full disability access and a unique 'disability suite'. Trisha has dedicated thousands of hours to promote this project, writing business plans, grant applications and enthusing a huge team of supporters. Over the years, young people who want to just `take part` to those who needed high level training, whilst not forgetting those with access issues, have come to appreciate Tricia`s excellent knowledge - as well as her everlasting love. For the personal coaching of hundreds of young people to her constant planning and fundraising for the new centre, Tricia is an ideal candidate to carry the torch on behalf of Brentwood and she recognises the accolade of even being nominated! The Mayor of Brentwood, who has chosen Tricia`s Recoil Twisters club as her charity, is pleased to support the application.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=patricia-sharpe-1102/index.htmlBillericay25/06/201251http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-06/index.htmlBasildon06/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=basildon/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/EF8A-B129-5088-8346.jpg\n\n28\n\nTim Sullivanhttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=timothy-sullivan-1055/index.htmlBillericay25/06/201251http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-22/index.htmlHavering (London Borough)22/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=havering-london-borough/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/D730-4750-8FF2-E243.jpg\n\n29\n\nSeun IbitoyeOluwaseun is this year's recipient of a local sports award as he has shown incredible passion for all things sporty.

St Christophers School have used the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to raise awareness of the Olympic values, and healthy and active lifestyles. In form time students completed Olympic booklets educating them about countries athletes and Olympic Values of respect, excellence and friendship. Year 10 performing arts started the week with an opening ceremony performance. Each day there was a country of the day. This determined the food that was on the menu in the canteen and the sporting activities. E.g. For Kenya day we had a 1500m team challenge for students to achieve a personal best and a Kenyan food menu. In addition a goal ball competition took place to raise awareness of the Paralympic Games as well as Inter form softball and rounders. The week saw sports participation increase and more importantly pupils who do not normally take part in sport are keen to continue in the future. Ex student Niki Foster a professional golfer did an inspiring assembly. The initiatives will continue until 2012 Olympics and beyond.

I believe that she in an inspiration to us all because of the time and dedication she has donated to organising and managing a homeless shelter in Lancaster. Sue sleeps over at the night shelter 5 nights a week, whilst working during the day for a family support service, helping children and families who are in need of additional support - as well as studying for a degree to achieve her dream of becoming a social worker. As well as this, Sue recruits volunteers to ensure that the night shelter is open seven nights a week and ensures that all clients have sleeping equipment and food - free of charge. She listens, talks and does her job with the greatest commitment and regard for the individuals she works with. The project she organises and manages saves the lives of others in her community and her dedication and hard work goes un-noticed. Sue loves the individuality of people and always puts the needs of others before hers. She has saved lives through the early identification of strokes, overdoses and the fast thinking when dealing with people who self harm. She deserves to be recognised as an inspirational person for her dedication to the care of others within her community - she has respect and positive regard for everyone she works with, and it isn't a job to her it's just her way of life. If we all treated each other this way the world would be a pleasure to live in!http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=susan-fearnley-1627/index.htmlBlackpool25/06/201226http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-23/index.htmlPreston23/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=preston-lancashire/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/E6A6-1EE3-6B85-024E.jpg\n\n35\n\nRyan ThorntonRyan Thornton was just 19 when his older brother Lee was killed in Iraq. Gunner Lee Thornton, 22, was serving with the Royal Artillery when he was shot and fatally wounded by a sniper while out on patrol. His loss was devastating for the whole family. Ryan is one of the founding members of the SSAFA Forces Help Support Group for Bereaved Siblings. Ryan first came along to the Support Groups to support his mother through what was a traumatic time for her. It was only having seen how much the group helped her that Ryan recognised that he and others like him would benefit from something similar. He has worked hard over the last two years to make sure that anyone who has lost a sibling in service knows about the group. Sharing personal memories and experiences about the death of a family member is a challenge - Ryan has done this numerous times and plans to continue doing so in order to help professionals understand how to better support someone in his position. 'When my brother died in Iraq I didn't speak to anyone about it. But this group helped me build my confidence. We meet up and talk about what we have been through.' Ryan chairs the meetings and welcomes new members to make sure they feel part of the group. He's involved in all of the activities and is not afraid to step out of his comfort zone. He also volunteers to work with children with Additional Needs and Disabilities and found the time to run the London Marathon to raise money for the groups.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=ryan-thornton-1497/index.htmlBlackpool25/06/201225http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-23/index.htmlWarton23/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=warton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/1285-F344-F359-AB46.jpg\n\n36\n\nRick ClementRichard suffered horrific injuries in 2010 while on active service in Afghanistan.

Born to a single-mother in war-time, the first in our family to go to University (graduating with a first class degree), he has achieved much in life; he is a loyal and generous husband and father (not to mention grandfather, brother, uncle, friend....), fantastically talented guitarist and erstwhile cricketer. His last job before retirement, as a lecturer at Warwick University, allowed him to educate and inspire many students. In retirement he has become very involved in his local Dorset community. In 1999 a dilapidated church hall was offered for sale to the village of Morcombelake, and after 5 years of negotiations by my Dad, fund-raising (for purchase and significant repairs) lead by my Dad, and his establishing a registered charity, the Hall finally belonged to the village. Having been entirely refurbished, it is now central to the community providing a venue for charity & social events, clubs and classes. One of the most special events is the monthly Luncheon Club for the over 70s, cooked beautifully by my Mum and friends, while many attendees are taxied around by my Dad. The most inspirational thing about my Dad is that he has had such a positive impact on so many people, but has absolutely no idea how special he is.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=trevor-chambers-1795/index.htmlBridport25/06/201269http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-13/index.htmlHamworthy13/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=hamworthy/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/F9B1-23BA-A633-5D4E.jpg\n\n53\n\nTony LanksteadTony always puts customers at the heart of the decisions he makes.

She has gained Grade 6 in music (flute) and is currently working on her Silver DoE award. She is an outstanding role model for her peers at school both in and out of the classroom and has been made a \"senior student\". Out of school she volunteers within the guiding movement and has become a Young Leader, helping to run her local guide pack and finds time to play centre for her local netball team.

It was only about 5 years ago that he discovered running for the first time. Yet in that comparatively short time, he has progressed from being a total beginner, to become the fully qualified Lead Coach at his local running club, Bitton Road Runners in Bristol. His kindness, understanding, technical knowledge and boundless enthusiasm have allowed him to help so many runners, at all levels of ability - and he spends so much of his time ensuring others can both enjoy and improve their running. He would consider it a real honour and a thrill, to be included in our Olympics in this way - and I believe he truly deserves the opportunity to be a part of this momentous occasion.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=terry-kirby-6874/index.htmlBristol25/06/201234http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-05-22/index.htmlBitton22/05/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=bitton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/9D80-B2BC-CB36-3440.jpg\n\n58\n\nWendy MorrellAn inspirational person who's turned full circle, overcoming disability to become a maths teacher, lecturer, pilot and a national standard archer, held two national records and was training to represent GB when a training accident caused a severe brain injury, when struck with a discus. 11 months in hospital and years of rehab followed.

Thirty years on, Ric's children have swum, alongside many other children, left the club and he is now seeing the children of those he taught coming to swim. Ric's enthusiasm and coaching skills have given thousands of local children the opportunity of not only to learn to swim but to compete at the highest of their own ability.Ric is a dedicated and commited person who had given so much of his time encouraging and supporting swimmers over the decades. His dedication has built the club from a small club, competing at local level into a seven times a week, regional and national competition club. Even now, after thirty years, the easiest place to find Ric is at the pool running the training sessions or at weekends supporting swimmers at events throughout the UK. Ric encourages all people who pass throught the club to do their best and be proud of their achievements. The encouragement and friendly atmosphere he creates ensures that swimmers remain enjoying the sport and teaching at the club, even when their fastest competition days are behind them. Ric is a well respected and inspirational member of our local community who has put so much in and truly deserves a moment to shine.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=edwin-wesolowski-1629/index.htmlBury25/06/201259http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-06-23/index.htmlBury23/06/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=bury/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/010B-A616-8A7C-8640.jpg\n\n65\n\nSally HadleyI hope to continue chartity related work involved with swimming.I have already taken part in the Marie Curie Cancer Care Swimathon 2011 & I aim to participate in the 2mile Great North Swim in June 2012 as I will then be 16.

This is a testament to his determination because he has suffered many physical setbacks, including a terrible skiing accident four months before the 1989 event, which he ran with the addition of several steel screws to his leg. In 1986 he was involved in a horrific car crash and his legs appeared completely crushed to all around including the firemen attempting to rescue him. He has no memory of the event and awoke days later in hospital to an amazing yet ridiculous account of his argument his rescuers. As they approached the car with a chainsaw and the intention of amputating his legs to rush him to hospital, he awoke and in a calm stern voice told them on no account where they to remove any limb but instead to cut the car away from him. He protested so much that they agreed and amazingly his legs were fine! He will be seventy-one next month and doing the marathon is more of a challenge every year but he has been determined to continue until the Olympic year inspired in part by Whizzkids, the charity he donates marathon sponsorship to, which provides wheelchairs and sports equipment to the severely handicapped. He has never raced beyond an amateur level, competing in track-cycling in Singapore with the air force and marathons all over the world, but he would have loved to do both at a professional level, and feeling involved in the Olympics would help fulfil this lifetime ambition.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=tony-tillbrooke-1749/index.htmlCambridgeshire25/06/201272http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-08/index.htmlLetchworth Garden City08/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=letchworth-garden-city/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/F564-0538-F61B-DF4E.jpg\n\n69\n\nSam WildingSince being at school, Sam has always shown great committment to his school work and outside interests.

Every weekend she is helping someone, either directly or helping someone help them. Many of her week nights are taken up running her cub pack and district meetings or supporting other groups. On a personal level whenever I have had a hard day at work or feeling unwell, Sue will be at the end of the phone to listen, chat and offer moral support.

Despite intensive chemotherapy as an inpatient and outpatient, numerous emergency admissions and a time in Intensive Care, Will has never once complained - always answering that \"there's no point, it won't change anything.\" Will's love of sailing, shooting, cycling and horse riding has given him a goal and kept him going through some very tough times. He has desperately tried to keep up with his studies and is taking his GCSEs as planned. Will is still on maintenance chemotherapy but carries on living each day to its full and has recently raised Â£608.00 doing an abseil in aid of The Oncology Outpatient Department at Birmingham Children's Hospital. His next challenge is a parachute jump for Teenage Cancer Trust. Will would be a brilliant choice as a bearer of the Olympic Torch. Not only is he a keen sportsman, he's a truly inspirational young man who although facing the horrendous challenge of Cancer can smile, keep his sense of humour and teach us all very valuable lessons. Will is great fun to be with and this is reflected in the huge number of friends and admirers he has - of all ages!!!http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=william-smith-711/index.htmlClaverdon25/06/201217http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-01/index.htmlEarlswood01/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=earlswood/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/927D-E7C1-241A-F34F.jpg\n\n78\n\nZoe McbethZoe is an old school friend who has started an incredible journey this year in the name of charity, Walk the Walk in aid of breast cancer after 2 of her best friends were diagnosed.

She takes on some of the most difficult to place children and never turns away a child in need of a home. As well as caring for children with learning difficulties and/or behavior problems she works with them to help prepare them for the outside world when they eventually have to leave her care. As well as looking after the foster children, my mum also works as a teaching assistant in the local school, again working closely with children on a one-to-one level and whole classes to help those who have learning difficulties. At the age of 60 she has also just passed her maths GCSE exam, in order to better help her teaching. She is also a keen runner, having completed 2 London marathons, several half marathons and the Great North Run in 2009.

Currently I can cater for girls aged 11 - 17 and my aim to expand to welcome youngsters aged 7 - 11 to play as well. I want for the girls to be able to access and enjoy playing a team sport and to show them that team sport is a healthy and fun way to stay out of trouble and get fit and healthy. By becoming a torch bearer I hope to bring more visibility to our wonderful sport and encourage more women and girls to give it a go.

Her grandfather Ted Warren was in the British Olympic Team in Paris in 1924 and again in Amsterdam in 1928 when he won a bronze team medal in gymnastics. My mother has been an inspiration to me and to my sister all our life. She has worked with young people in youth group settings for years and has taken young people on camps, held youth events at our house and always been there as a friend and confidante to so many youngsters. She has worked in a Primary School for 17 years as a school secretary and has regularly held school assemblies to encourage young people to do the best they can and to reach for their dreams. For the last 12 years she has been involved with a charity, Amigos Worldwide, originally started by three of her friends. She has personally been responsible in finding sponsors for 36 children in Uganda enabling them to receive the much needed education that they would not otherwise receive. She has also encouraged others to visit their sponsor children in Uganda and has just returned from a trip where she was working with girls aged between 15 and 25 who had been affected by rebel forces. She tirelessly raises funds and awareness for the poor and underprivileged and makes a way for all to be involved who want to make a difference in this world. My mothers biggest hero was her grandfather and to carry the olympic torch in his memory as a bronze team medallist would be a great honour.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=sarah-blight-1230/index.htmlCrowlas25/06/201252http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-05-19/index.htmlMarazion19/05/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=marazion/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/0DA2-7ED0-59B0-F742.jpg\n\n85\n\nShaun Whitehttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=shaun-white-170/index.htmlCroydon25/06/201214http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-23/index.htmlThe London Borough of Merton23/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-merton/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/0E4C-939F-B4B9-CF44.jpg\n\n86\n\nTwinelle Hopesonhttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=twinelle-hopeson-3603/index.htmlCroydon25/06/201220http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-23/index.htmlThe London Borough of Croydon23/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-croydon/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/82F9-FE94-DB63-F34D.jpg\n\n87\n\nSuki Bartonhttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=suki-barton-5420/index.htmlDartford25/06/201236http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-22/index.htmlBarking and Dagenham (London Borough)22/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=barking-and-dagenham-london-borough/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/63CE-4568-3652-C440.jpg\n\n88\n\nRosie HollisRosie is working very hard to lower the age limit for cervical cancer screening after being diagnosed with it aged just 24.

His school also nominated him as an `Olympic Ambassador` to promote sport and sportsmanship in local schools.

He is committed to his sport, having to fit in training sessions with his busy school life; this has been a very busy year but he has managed to fulfil all of his commitments without complaining.

RS 200 Open Circuit 1st Exmouth 2009, 3rd Exmouth 2010, 3rd Parkstone Open 2008, 5th Youth Championships 2009. RYA Youth Team Racing Championships 2009 2nd Overall Parkstone YC team Commodores Challenge team member in 2008, 2009 and part of the 2010 winning team. He has also been invited to the qualifiers for the British Keelboat Academy in September 2011. In addition to his racing results, he has tried to give something back to the sport by using his skills and knowledge to help others and teach them how to sail. In the summer of 2009 he qualified as an RYA dinghy instructor and since then he has coached Cadet sailors on Tuesday evenings and has organised and run coaching days for his club's RYA On Board Scheme. He says that ' Being able to share and encourage others to sail and see the people I'm teaching having a great time on the water is something that I take immense pride in. This is surely what the Olympic Games are about \"not just the winning but the taking part\" to applaud all the competitors, not just the winners.' With this attitude he deserves to be a torch bearer taking the games and their ethos forward.http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=thomas-brophy-1564/index.htmlDorset25/06/201218http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-13/index.htmlStoborough13/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=stoborough/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/1796-8370-4EEA-A841.jpg\n\n96\n\nWil Fields-jewellhttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=wilem-fields-jewell-1693/index.htmlEast Grinstead25/06/201218http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-17/index.htmlEastbourne17/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=eastbourne/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/9D8D-92AC-6BB7-444D.jpg\n\n97\n\nTyler Saundershttp://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/torchbearers=tyler-saunders-3620/index.htmlEdgware25/06/201229http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/day=2012-07-24/index.htmlThe London Borough of Ealing24/07/2012http://www.london2012.com/torch-relay/torchbearers/community=the-london-borough-of-ealing/index.htmlhttp://www.london2012.com/imgml/torchbearers/s/E759-D65A-C352-A64F.jpg\n\n98\n\nTony CollinsTony is a wonderful example of a young man overcoming problems to participate in the sport of athletics. As was the case with his younger brother Neill (see separate nomination), Tony was born with learning disabilities and was educated at a special school. When he was 14, he joined Havering Mayesbrook Athletic Club training with a middle distance group. His limitless enthusiasm for the sport saw him improve rapidly and become a regular member of the Club's young athletes' teams. In more recent years, Tony worked through the junior and senior ranks competing regularly at distances between 800m and 3000m. His talent led to him being selected some 14 years ago to run for the Great Britain team for athletes with Learning Disabilities and, in the intervening years, Tony has been a regular member of the team competing all over Europe and as far afield as Brazil, South Africa and Australia. He is an excellent example of a young amn who has successfully overcome considerable difficulty in everyday life to achieve at a high level on the sporting stage.
