        "text": "Recent moves towards devolution and decentralisation in the UK have produced a mixture of outcomes. The independence achieved in Wales and Scotland combines two very different approaches while the regional issue in Northern Ireland is a central component of the peace process. In the English regions the workings of the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) now receive less attention although they are regarded as having a substantive role in supporting the social and economic wellbeing of the regions. Even at this macro-level there appear to be problems of fit&#39; between good regional intentions enshrined in Regional Economic Strategies (RES) and more local implementation. By looking at the North East case, the authors argue that changes to the regional - local dynamic are necessary to the restructuring of the social and economic landscape of the region. This means that new competencies are needed to support the forms of regional governance that are taking shape; a process that is fa...\n\nIn the light of the new Coalition Government’s proposed ‘rescaling ’ of sub-national governance away from the regional level, it is an opportune time to re-consider the strength and weaknesses of the city or sub-regional approach to economic development and to search, once more, for the ‘missing middle ’ in English Governance. In this context, the article initially assesses the case for city or sub regions as tiers of economic governance, before examining the lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the existing city regions in the North East of England. It argues that while contemporary plans to develop Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) can be usefully considered within the context of the emerging city regional developments under the previous Labour Governments, a number of important challenges remain, particularly in relation to ensuring accountable structures of governance, a range of appropriate functions, adequate funding, and comprehensive coverage across a variety of s...\n\nIn the light of the new Coalition Government’s proposed ‘rescaling’ of sub-national governance away from the regional level, it is an opportune time to re-consider the strength and weaknesses of the city or sub regional approach to economic development and to search, once more, for the ‘missing middle’ in English Governance. In this context, the article initially assesses the case for city or sub regions as tiers of economic governance, before examining the lessons to be learnt from the experiences of the existing city regions in the North East of England. It argues that while contemporary plans to develop Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) can be usefully assessed against a backdrop of the emerging city regional developments under the previous Labour Governments, a number of important challenges remain, particularly in relation to ensuring accountable structures of governance, a range of appropriate functions, adequate funding, and comprehensive coverage across a variety of sub-regional contexts. While the proposals of the new Government create the necessary ‘space’ to develop sub regional bodies and offer genuine opportunities for both city and county LEPs, the scale of the sub-regional challenge should not be underestimated, particularly given the context of economic recession and major reductions in the public sector.\n\nEnglish Constitutional arrangements in parts of the UK have been transformed by political devolution. In England, however, reliance has been placed on strengthening the regional tier through administrative decentralisation. Drawing on the views of Whitehall civil servants, this article explores how central–regional relations are being recalibrated and how government is building a regional perspective into its activities. We conclude that, in the absence of regional government, Whitehall is pursuing a cautious approach to regional working and greater attention needs to be given to incorporating regional priorities in national spending programmes and developing a more coherent approach to regional strategy making.\n\nIn the absence of strong linguistic and cultural identities, subnational political territories need not correspond with the historical geographies of place. Although the boundaries of local government may be based on identifiable spatial units and draw some legitimacy from being the primary unit of democracy, it is entirely contingent whether the spaces below the nation-state, such as regions, are more than administrative constructions."
