        "text": "William Halpin was born on November 11, 1843, in Kingscourt, Cavan, Ireland to James Halpin and Margaret Matthews. His siblings include John (1846), Patt (1848), Hugh (1851), Phill (1852-1852), James (1857), Phillip (1869), Mary, Thomas and Robert. He married Mary McArdle in Fisherville, New Hampshire, USA on November 23, 1874. Mary McArdle was born in Brooklyn New York in 1852. Her father, Peter McArdle and her mother Rose Maguire were born in Ireland. William died on September 10, 1916, in Greeley, Nebraska, at the age of 72, and was buried there.\n\nJames Halpin married Margaret Matthews ( -1888?) on February 15, 1843 in Kingscourt, Cavan, Ireland. Here is what we know, or think we know from Griffiths Valuation. http://www.askaboutireland.ie/griffith-valuation/index.xml?action=doNameSearch&familyname=Halpin%20&firstname=James%20&offset=20&countyname=&parishname=&unionname=&baronyname=&totalrows=63&PlaceID=0&wildcard=\n\nWilliam Halpin was born in Kingscourt, Cavan, Ireland in 1843, John (1846), Patt (1848), Hugh (1851), Phill (1852-1852), James (1857), Phillip (1869), Mary, Thomas and Robert.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. James Halpin’s birth date, place and parents, death date and place, place of burial?\n\n2. Margaret Mathews’ birth date, place and parents, death date and place, place of burial.\n\na. James Halpin’s wife Margaret Halpin died in 1888. The record indicates she was 55 years old. Which would make her too young for our William Halpin. I know that dates can be off by 10 years easily. But I am also thinking that Margaret Matthews may have died and this is a second Margaret. There are death records that indicate the death of a Margaret Halpin on February 15, 1854 at Kingscourt. I am thinking that is our Margaret Matthews but I do not have the actual church records.\n\nMary McArdle was born on March 14, 1852, in Brooklyn New York to Peter McArdle and Rose Maguire. We have a lot of documentation about her life and death.\n\nPeter McArdle – I have records indicating that Peter McArdle was the sibling of Andrew, Patrick, Mrs. Lawrence (Ann) Gahagan and Mrs. James (Rose) Connor, all residing in Penacook, Fisherville, New Hampshire around 1852 and immigrating from County Meath Ireland. These records include a written history of Penacook New Hampshire, USA and Edward McArdle’s will (probate records in New Hampshire, USA). I have death and approximate birth dates for Ann and Rose which line up with parish birth records in Nobber, Meath. Based on all this, I am making a guess that their parents are Ned (Edward) McArdle and Biddy (Bridget) Brady, Nobber, Meath.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. Peter McArdle’s birth date, place and confirmation that his parents are or are not Edward McArdle and Biddy Brady?\n\n2. Edward McArdle’s (Peter’s father) birth date and place. Peter McArdle’s father died in the US (Penabook history).\n\n3. Biddy (Brady?) McArdle’s birth date, place and death. I am making an educated guess that her birth date is July 24, 1795 in Nobber, Meath, Ireland to Cathe and Patt Brady.\n\nRose Maguire – I have a death record for Rose Maguire indicating that her parents were John Maguire and Ann Lovelle. USA census records indicate that she was born in Ireland about 1832. There are plenty of Maguire’s in the Kingscourt and Nobber area. There is a marriage record for a Daniel Leval in Kingscourt Parish in 1845. A Mary Lavell, married Charles Carrolan in Nobber in May 1854. But I can find no records for the birth of a Rose Maguire to a John Maguire and Ann Lavelle. There seem to be Lavel’s in the Crosmaglen, Armagh area which isn’t too far from Kingscourt. I am really stuck here and just making guesses.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1. The birth date and place for Rose Maguire (baptismal records for Rose, indicating date, place and her parents would solve a lot of questions.\n\n2. The birth date and place for her father John Maguire.\n\n3. The birth date and place for her Mother Ann Lavelle/Lovelle/Leval or any evidence that she existed in the Kingscourt/Nobber area.\n\nAny connections with people in the area who might be related to any of these people would be an amazing thing.\n\nInformation about property.\n\nStories about these people. They all seemed to immigrate at about the same time 1849-1850 (expect for William who came later after he grew up), and they all ended up in the same place, Fisherville, Penacook, Boscowen, New Hampshire, USA. I am assuming they came in relation to the famine. But the mass migration of all these people from the same general area in County Meath to this specific place in the USA is interesting to me."
