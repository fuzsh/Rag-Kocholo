Honour and obedi- ence to beloved guardians are commend- able and to be cherished. But the human soul and intellect cannot be formed and fashioned like the pot- ter's clay. We may not change the colour of the iris, the character of the voice, our form and stature : much less the Divine essence — the soul and its stock-in-trade within us.

Faraday obtained food for his craving genius from the books he stitched, responded to the inward monitor's call, and held \"aloft among the nations the scientific name of England for a period of forty years.\" The generous offer of a friend and the solicitous guidance of parents made William George Armstrong a lawyer.

Children are not necessarily the best judges of that for which they are best intended. They frequently make a wrong selection under the influence of surroundings not intended to give them the bias. In maturity they often abandon their first love. Many boys are without pre- ference ; they continue indifferent to every vocation from the village green to the end of life. This was not the case with the boy William George Armstrong. Me- chanics were to him a passion from childhood, and physi- cal science absorbed his hours of relaxation as a schoolboy and as a student at law. His father was the son of a Cumberland yeoman, who became a corn merchant, an alderman, and a mayor of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, while his mother was a daughter of William Potter, of Walbottle House, Northumberland. To this worthy couple, a son, afterwards the famous engineer, was born on Nov. 26, 1810, at Pleasant Row, Shieldfield, Newcastle.* William entered the Bishop Auckland Grammar School in 1826, where he remained for several years. During his residence at Bishop Auckland, he gratified his me- chanical ingenuity at the works of Mr. Ramshaw. He was invited to that gentleman's home, where he found \"a help-meet for him.\" Aye, and one who, during a busy, eventful, and brilliant career, has seconded his best efforts and cheered his anxious moments. She shares to-day his noble fame. Upon leaving school young Arm- strong entered the law office of Mr. Armorer Donkin, an intimate friend of the family, and a man of influence and position in the cemmunity. His legal curriculum was finished at the office of his brother-in-law, Mr. W. H. Watson, the late Baron Watson, then a special pleader in the Temple. In 1833 he returned to his native town to become a partner with Messrs. Donkin, Stable, and Armstrong. Mr. Armstrong was not an orthodox English sports- man. Though fond of music, the cry of the hound failed to charm his senses. Fishing was his favourite sport. He imbibed the taste from his father. Even in this pas- time his inventive genius found employment. A new bait basket was contrived, whereby the minnow was kept at a lower temperature; his tackle was continually under- going improvement ; and he became one of the most ac- complished fishers on the Coquet. It was during an out- * For view of birthplace tee IfmtUy Chronicle, voL L, p. 286. ing through the Craven district of Yorkshire in quest of trout that the idea which culminated in his fame first came to him. He was rambling through Dent Dale, in 1836, when his attention was arrested by an overshot water-wheel turned by a gurgling rill. The mill-wheel supplied the power for some marble works at the foot of the declivity. Twenty feet only of several hundred feet descent was utilised ; the rest remained unproductive. The possibility of the stream as a motive power at once engrossed Mr. Armstrong's thoughts. Intuition took the hint. For ten years he thought and wrought Jo perfect and realise his idea. Now the freights of nations are swung by his crane, and his hydraulic machinery is found on every mart of commerce in the civilized world. But the time during which he was harnessed to the legal profession was in truth a period of apprenticeship in constructive mechanics. Scarcely a day passed when Mr. Armstrong was at home that he did not spend several hours at Watson's High Bridge Works, either superintending his own models or watching the construc- tion of scientific machinery. It was a severe struggle be- tween a sense of duty to his partners and profession on the one hand, and innate genius on the other ; and the young solicitor kept swinging like an erratic pendulum between the law office and the lathe. The first attempt of Mr. Armstrong to realise his ambition to convert a column of water into a motive power was by means of an automatic hydraulic wheel, acted upon by discs made to enter a curved tube at the radius of the wheel-edge. It was an ingenious contrivance, and its utility was tested at the Skinner Burn. This was admirable experience, and a valuable lesson ; but the wheel failed to realise the in- ventor's expectations. Soon after this time a sensation was produced in the scientific world by a phenomenon which transpired at one of the Seaton Delaval Collieries. The workmen declared that something \"uncanny like\" was seen at the engine boiler, and when they adjusted the safety-valve while steam was blowing off, fire was said to reach out towards their finger-tips. Tyneside philosophers, and subse- quently men of science throughout the country, became interested in the mystery ; and it was discovered that electricity was evolved under the following circumstances : The boiler was found to be insulated upon a dry seating, and the friction produced by the escape of particles of water blowing away with high-pressure steam produced electricity, and a nervous shock was experienced when the hand was held in proximity to the escaping steam. Experiments bearing upon the generation of electricity by high-pressure steam were commenced by a number of scientific men ; but the lawyer distanced the philosophers in the measure of success attained. Numerous tests were made as to the best material for insulation and the best form and lining for the exit of steam. At last the hydro-electric machine was produced at the works of Messrs. Watson and Lambert, Carliol Square. Large January I NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. numbers of this celebrated machine were constructed — for the Polytechnic Institution of London, for Professor Faraday, and for the scientific institutions of Europe and America, When the invention had been completed, Mr. Arm- strong returned to his favourite study, and continued to make experiments to perfect his hydraulic machine : at last he succeeded. A fortunate circumstance materially assisted in bringing it under public notice and into prac- LOBD ABMSTRONO. tical use. In 1845, Mr. Armstrong became associated in his legal capacity with a company organised to supply the towns of Newcastle and Gateshead with water. When the company was formed, Mr. Armstrong delivered a lecture at the Literary Society of Newcastle, and demon- strated the utility of his invention by a working model. Soon thereafter a few friends joined with him to erect a crane on Newcastle Quay, where its usefulness could be put to the test in loading and discharging ships. Three more cranes were eventually ordered by the Corporation of Newcastle. A somewhat interesting circumstance, which tended to forward the popularity of the hydraulic crane, took place at this time. Let the inventor himself relate it : — Amongst others the late Sir William Cubitt (then Mr. Cubitt) took a very early interest in the machine, and wrote to Mr. Jesse Hartley, who was then the engineer of the Liverpool Docks, urginghim to go and see it, but that somewhat eccentric gen- tleman, who was very averse to novelties, at first flatly refused to do so. A second letter from Sir William Cubitt put the matter in such a light that Mr. Hartley could not persist in hia refusal without incurring the imputation of shutting his eyes to improve- ments ; so without giving any notice of his intention he went to Newcastle alone to see the crane. It was not at work when he arrived, but the man in charge was there, and Mr. Hartley entered into a banter- ing conversation with him. This man, who went by the name of '* Hydraulic Jack,\" had acquired great dexterity in the management of the ma- chine, and being put upon his \"mettle\" by Mr. Hartley's in- credulous observations, he pro- ceeded to show its action by a daring treatment of a hogshead of sugar. He began by run- ning it up with great velocity to the head of the jib, and then letting it as rapidly descend, but by gradually reducing its speed as it neared the ground he stopped it softly before it quite touched the pavement. He next swung it round to the opposite side of the circle, con- tinuing to lift and lower with great rapidity while the jib was in motion, and, in short, he exhibited the machine to such advantage that Mr. Hartley's prejudices were vanquished. Mr. Hartley, who will be re- membered as a man whose odd ways were combined with a frank and generous disposi- tion, displayed no feeling of discomfiture, but at once called upon the author, whom he la- conically addressed in the fol- lowing words : *' I am Jesse Hartley, of Liverpool, and I have seen your crane. It is the very thing I want, and I shall recommend its adop- tion at the Albert Dock.\" With scarcely another word he bade adieu, and returned to Liverpool. This anecdote marks an epoch in the his- tory of hydraulic cranes, which then passed from the stage of experiment to that of assured adoption. The triumph of the invention and the fame of the in- ventor were now established ; and in 1847-8 the Elswick Works, intended for the construction of hydraulic ma- chinery, were founded by Mr. Armstrong and his old friend and partner Mr. Alderman Donkin, Mr. Alderman MONTHLY CHRONICLE. \\ January Potter, Mr. George Cruddas, and Mr. Richard Lambert. From this beginning the famous works of Sir William Armstrong and Partners have developed. Mr. Armstrong had no part in the international jumble out of which the Crimean War was begotten. But when the appeal to arms was made, he was sufficiently human, and enough of a patriot, to wish success to British arms. He watched the movements of troops, the formation of lines, the approaches and means of defence with the anxiety of an Englishman, but from the plane of science. Difficulty was experienced at Inkerman in bringing up heavy artillery. Two eighteen-pounders were finally got into position ; they contributed largely to turn the tide of battle, and gain the doubtful day. \" Why cannot lighter guns obtain a greater range ? \" That was the question which occurred to Mr. Armstrong. And he grasped this proposition with all that strength and continuity which characterise him. Inkerman was fought in November, 1854. Within a month he had solved the problem, convinced the War Secretary, and commenced the gun. The arrow in its flight tirst suggested the best for rifled ordnance. A Committee of the House of Commons, reporting upon the whole question, said : — Mr. Armstrong proposed » method of constructing a gun which rendered it capable of enduring the strain to which rifled ordnance is submitted. This method was certainly at that time the only one capable of fulfilling that condition ; and your Committee have had no practical evidence before them that even at this mo- ment any other method of constructing rifled ordnance exists which can be compared with that of Mr. Arm- strong. In combination with his system of constructing or manufacturing a gun, Mr. Armstrong had introduced to the notice of the Government a plan of breechloadinsr, the gun being rifled on the old polygroove system, which involved the coating of the projectile with soft metal. This combination of construction, breechloading, rifling, and coating the projectiles with soft metal, came to be termed the Armstrong system. The range and precision of the gun were so vastly superior to all field ordnance known at the time, that, after careful and repeated trials, the Committee appointed to investigate the question recommended its adoption as the field gun of the service. , The Adjutant-General of Artillery pronounced the Armstrong field gun the best then known— that also- being \" the opinion of officers of Artillery of all classes.' The success of the gun was conclusive, the result of the form of projectile. But material of construction and its application, the mode and method of rifling, loading, and of exploding shells — all the questions involved in gunnery had to be thought out anew and by a single mind. Experimental guns were constructed, and trials were made at early hours and in out of the way places, on the moors at Allenheads and by the sea-shore. At last, in the spring of 1856, the Armstrong gun was ready for official scrutiny. The first gun submitted to the Govern- ment was a three-pounder. A five-pounder was next made for further examination ; it was adopted. Heavier cannon, to be constructed on the Armstrong principle, were required at once. The Rifled Cannon Committee tested the capabilities of the (run to the uttermost, and recommended it as combining the best known elements struggle was most gratifying to Mr. Armstrong, and fortune was at his feet. But he rose to a sublime height, and gave the fruit of his genius, his toils of years, his hope of reward and renown, without fee or consideration, to his country. The nation applauded the deed of patriotism. The Queen conferred upon him the dignity of Knighthood and Commander of the Bath. His services were found imperative for the construction of the gun ; and he was made Engineer of Rifled Ordnance, with a salary of £2,000 a year, and, later, Superintendent of the Gun Factory. The Government required that guns should be constructed with secrecy and despatch. Woolwich was entirely unprepared for such work, and an arrangement was made whereby the Armstrong guns should be made at Elswick. Lord Derby's Government January I 1889. f NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. made the contract. Under its provisions the Elswick Ordnance Company were obliged to provide all the works and machinery for making the ordnance required, and confine them entirely to the execution of Government orders. Should the works be kept idle through want of orders from the Department for War, the company was to receive compensation, to be assessed by the Attorney General. This arrangement continued until the spring of 1863, when Sir William resigned his appointment, and the contract between the Government and the Elswick Company was cancelled by mutual consent. But few of the original features of the Armstrong gun are maintained in the ordnance now made by the in- ventor. The coil formation, the rifling, and the breech- loading when desired, are adhered to. And in view of the results of the trials at Spezzia, it is only fair to add that the gun still holds the supremacy. But the original little three-pounder, which two men could carry, has grown into a one hundred ton wire gun, the most destructive weapon upon earth. From modest beginnings the Elswick Works have gone on increasing and extending until now they cover about seventy acres of ground, and afford employment to 12,000 contented men. Towards the end of 1882, they were joined to the well-known shipbuilding works of Charles Mitchell and Co., of Low Walker, under the corporate name of Sir William George Armstrong, Mitchell, and Co., Limited. The position for their enterprise is admirable : their capabilities for build- ing and mounting war vessels — arising out of a remark- able combination of genius, skill, workmanship, hydraulic contrivances to make and handle ordnance, and work the guns when mounted— are certainly unsurpassed. When the new company's stock was placed upon the market, the applications exceeded the shares to be issued fourfold. Although he had been frequently invited to associate himself in some direct manner with the management of the public affairs of his native town, Sir William Arm- strong only once solicited the suffrages of his fellow- citizens. And then his services were declined. A grave crisis had arisen in 1886. Mr. Gladstone, having pro- duced a Home Rule Bill for Ireland which had failed to secure the support of a large section of the Liberal party, was defeated in Parliament. Then followed a general election. Sir William Armstrong was a Liberal ; but he dissented from the Irish policy of Mr. Gladstone. Re- quested to come forward as a candidate on Unionist principles for one of the two seats for Newcastle, he agreed to stand, with Sir Matthew White Ridley as his colleague. Mr. John Morley and Mr. James Craig, Gladstonian Liberals, were, however, returned. It was Sir William Armstrong's first and last contest in New- castle. But though excluded from the House of Com- mons, he was offered a seat in the House of Lords. This offer, made in 1887, was accepted. Elevated to the peerage as Baron Armstrong of Cragside, he was hon- oured by the Government of the day with the duty of seconding the Address in reply to the Speech from the Throne. It goes without saying that he discharged this function with dignity and credit MONTHLY CHRONICLE. ( January I 18»9. Lord Armstrong has ever taken a deep interest in pub- lic institutions and affairs. It was through him that a committee was appointed by the Government to report upon the coal measures of Great Britain. He has actively participated in the deliberations, and is a past president of the British Association, the Institute of Mechanical Engineers, the Institute of Civil Engineers, and kindred societies. The Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle is indebted to Lord Armstrong, its president, for more than his bountiful hand and wise supervision. His lectures from its platform have added to the high position it occupies among the societies of England. In 1844 he addressed the members upon hydro-electricity. During the next session he delivered three lectures on \" The Employment of a Column of Water as a Motive Power for Propelling Machinery.\" These, together with addresses delivered to the various scientific and mechanical institutes, and articles contributed to maga- zines and publications, are all in the special direction of his fame. But in the winter of 1873 he gave the society and his townsmen the result of a visit to Egypt in 1872, in four lectures. These lectures now constitute a small volume, full of information and charm. Bountiful gifts from Lord and Lady Armstrong have become such frequent occurrences that they no longer oc- casion surprise. Were the Jardin d'Acclimatation re- peated on the western slopes of Newcastle, no one would wonder. A lecture hall for the Literary Society to-day, an operating theatre for the Infirmary to-mor- row ; thousands to restore a grand old steeple ; thou- sands more to the Children's Hospital ; three-fourths of a £20,000 bridge across Benton Valley; ten thou- sand to the Natural History Museum ; a Mechanics' Institute, and a long range of schools, for the work- men of Elswick : a Banqueting Hall for the city of his birth ; Parks for his fellow-citizens ! I am told that his wealth is still immense. The more he bestows the richer he becomes. To satisfy the cravings of the student, to reclaim the child from disease, are deeds for more than evanescent applause. What are bags of gold in the vaults compared with a mortgage upon the hearts and brains of men and women ? And the parks he has provided, the acres which his bountiful heart has wisely bestowed upon the people, are more valuable to him now than ever before : the quality has been transformed, the area transferred into the grateful visages of the people ; and smiling little faces of generations yet unborn shall bless the memory of him who vouchsafed for them recrea- tion grounds surrounded by the beauties and riches of nature — who enabled them to breathe the air of heaven amid the hum and strife of earth. He who can evoke the blessings of the poor is more than a prince : and his fame shall resist \" the empire of decay.\" The banqueting hall in Jesmond Dene, like the Armstrong Park adjoining, forms part of the princely gifts of Lord Armstromg to the people of Newcastle. Lord Armstrong's portrait is copied from a photograph by Messrs. W. and D. Downey, taken a few years ago. j]R. MURRAY, of Oxford, pausing in the her- culean task of his \"New English Dictionary,\" _ tells us—\" The fact has of late years power- fully impressed itself upon philological students, that the creative period of language, the epoch of 'roots,' has never come to an end. The ' origin of language' is not to be sought merely in a far-off Indo-European antiquity, or in a still earlier pre-Aryan yore-time ; it is still in peren- nial process around us.\" A literary language is hostile to word-creation. But such is not the case with language in its natural state. \"The unwritten dialect,\" he adds, \"and, to some extent, even slang, and colloquial speech, approach in character to language in its natural state, aiming only at being expressive, and treating memory and precedent as ministers, not as masters. In the local dialects, then, in slang, in colloquial use, new vocables and new expressions may at any time be abruptly brought forth to serve the needs of the moment. Some of these pass at length from colloquial into epistolary, journalis- tic, and, finally, into general literary use. The dialect glossaries abound in words of this kind.\" Such a word is \"candyman,\" a word known to every pitman in Durham and Northumberland, which has a place in the English language and is defined in \"The New English Dic- tionary \" as meaning, in the North of England, \" a bum- bailiff, or process server.\" Now, everybody knows the \"candy,\" or \"sugar-candy,\" which lured the juvenile, happy in the possession of a penny, to purchase its sticky sweetness from the tempting window, or which was an irresistible bait to our infantile ha'penny when displayed with all the blandishment of the itinerant \" candyman.\" But what possible connection can there be between the grave \" bum-bailiff \" of the dictionary and the wandering confectionery man with sweet discourse ? This question was asked in the London Kotet and Queries just a dozen years ago, and was in that same volume fully and finally explained by Mr. W. E. Adams, of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, who wrote — \" It is not often that we are able to trace so satisfactorily the origin of provincial words as we are that of the word 'candyman.' It is, as was stated in the editor's note (Notes and Queries, vol. v., p. 325, April 22nd, 1876), 'a term in the North for men employed to carry out evictions against cottage occupiers.' There was, in October, 1863, a great strike of miners at the collieries of Messrs. Strakers and Love, in the county ot Durham. As no adjustment of the difference was possible, the owners determined to eject the miners from their cottages. For this purpose a large number of curious characters were engaged by the agents of Messrs. Strakers and Love. Among the persons so engaged was at least one January \\ NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. whose ordinary occupation was that of selling candy and other sweetmeats in the neighbouring towns. The man was recognised and was chaffed about his calling by the evicted miners. Very soon, of course, the term 'candyman,' which rapidly became a term of reproach, was applied to the whole class. Since that time the word has come into general use over the two Northern Counties whenever ejectments take place.\" Like the verbs to bowdlerize, and to boycott, the substantive candyman has thus taken its place as an English word in very recent years. The adoption of \"candyman,\" however, dates from an earlier period than that mentioned by Mr. Adams. It seems to have been first used during the \" great stick\" of 1844, and had already become general in 1863. But for the prompt record of the unlikely connec- tion between sugar-candy and the serving of a warrant, what groping might not some twentieth century philolo- gist have made, \"as vainly in the 'word-hoard' of Old English speech, or even the fullest vocabulary of Indo- European roots, as in a school-manual of Latin and Greek roots and affixes,\" to find the origin of the bum-bailiff candyman !

WHITTINGHAM FAIR. jjALLADS embodying a series of riddles are much rarer in the English language than in the language of Sweden, Denmark, or other Northern nations. The riddles in these ballads are sometimes propounded to a knight, sometimes to a lady, and often to the Evil One himself ; in the latter case, the demon is sure, of course, to be puzzled and unable to answer the questions. In addition to its enigmatical character, the metrical construction of \" Whittingham Fair \" is of a duolinear form, common to many ballads which have descended to us from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These compositions were generally of a rude and simple kind, consisting of verses of two lines only, with an interval of rest at the end of each, which the minstrel made use of to play a symphony (either to lengthen the ballad or to display his musical skill). Vocalists, when singing such ballads without instrumental accompaniment, it may be easily inferred, would introduce some burden to replace the symphony of the minstrel. Some of these burdens consisted of short proverbial expressions, such as \" 'Tis merry in the hall, when beards wag all.\" Others were mere nonsense lines that went glibly off the tongue, giving the accent of the music, but having no connection with the subject of the ballad. Examples of these burdens are common in the plays of Shakspeare and the Elizabethan dramatists. The \" Willow willow \" of Ophe- lia in \" Hamlet,\" and \"Hey ho ! the wind and the rain \" of the clown in \"Twelfth Night,\" are specimens, as are also the \"Fallal la\" and the \"Tol derol\"of our own day. \"Whittingham Fair,\" like many other old ballads, has been relegated to the nursery, and is sometimes sung without the first verse, though it is then evidently in- complete. The melody which here accompanies the song we believe to be the original tune, and is always sung to it in North and West Northumberland. Are you go • ing to Whit-ting-ham Fair?

When he has done and finished his work, Parsley, sage, rosemary, and thyme ; Oh. tell mm to come and he'll have his shirt, And he shall be a true lover of mine. • The second line of the song \" Parsley, sage, rowmary, and thyme,\" fullv bears out the condition of being a nonsense line, having no connection with the lubjeet ; but when we once heard the ballad the singer achieved a still higher pitch of absurdity by solemnly chanting \"Parsley, sage, grwa merry in time, an the correct burden. MONTHLY CHRONICLE. j] ALTON CASTLE or Tower is situated about a couple of miles north of Cor- bridge, and within a short distance of the Roman Wall. It is regarded as a good specimen of the late pele tower. Without possessing any distinguish- ing feature, it is interesting from the fact that its stones were mostly taken from the neighbouring Roman station of Halton Cheaters, which was identified by Horsley as the Hunnum of the Notitia, the fifth of the stations from the east per lineam valli and the headquarters of the Sabinian cavalry regiment. Two Roman funereal tablets are built into the surrounding walls. A small chapel ad- joins ; but, save the chancel arch and the east window, little of the original architecture remains. The manor originally belonged to the family of Halton, and appears in the list of lands held in drengage under King John. There was a John de Halton in Henry III. 's reipm, and a William of the family was High Sheriff of Northumberland in the seventeenth year of the reign of Edward I. A sister, Margaret, inherited a moiety of the manor, the other moiety being possessed by the Carnabys of Carnaby, a famous Northumbrian family who in the reign of Richard II. appear to have been in possession of the whole manor. Preserved in this Border tower was a sword of the Carnabys, 5ft. 4in. long. There is a tradi- tion to the effect that when the country was infested with mosstroopers one of the Carnabys had a commission to apprehend and try them. Whilst he was engaged upon the trial of some thieves who had fallen into his hands, a notorious character was seized by his son, who asked his father what should be done with him. \"Hang him,\" said the father. At the termination of the trial with which he was occupied, the elder Carnaby ordered the culprit to be brought before him, but was informed that the sentence had already been carried out. There is a similar tradition, however, about Belted Will. A relic of the feudal system, according to a statement in the proceedings of the Newcastle Society of Anti- quaries for 1882-t, is still observed at Great Whittington. The freeholders are obliged to send seven mowers and January \\ 1889. / NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. 9 fourteen reapers to Halton Castle for one day every year when called upon. It is called the Bond Barge. The labourers receive no wages, but are supplied with victuals and drink. Efttrltoall pHE ruins of Thirlwall Castle are situate on an eminence on the west bank of the Tipalt, a tributary of the South Tyne, at a short distance north of the point where that rivulet was crossed by the great Roman Wall. Though the castle is said to derive its name from the Scots piercing the wall here, it has evidently had no con- nection with the great barrier. Horsley, indeed, con- jectures that it might have received its present name from a passage of a branch of the South Tyne through the wall a little to the west of the fortress. There is, however, a tradition that the castle received its name from the fact that the Roman Wall was \"thirled,\" or penetrated, at this point. The walls are in some places nine feet thick, and the place was defended by a strong outward barrier. There is evidence that this stronghold was built entirely of stones from the Roman Wall. In 1831 the south wall fell into the Tipalt. The ruins now present a picturesque appearance, derived from its situation on a rocky boss about thirty feet from the stream. Thirlwall Castle was for many generations the seat of the Thirl- walls, whose heiress, in 1738, married Matthew Swin- burn, of Capheaton, who sold the castle and manor to the Earl of Carlisle. Dr. Bruce in his \"Roman Wall,\" says : — \" Amongst the witnesses examined on the occa- sion of the famous suit between the families of Scrope and Grosvenor, for the right to bear the shield 'azure, a bend or, 'which was opened at Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1385, before King Richard II. in person, was John Thirlwall, an esquire of Northumberland.

Such is the lan- guage of the record of these proceedings, preserved in the Tower of London.\" at Jttarft 'Eton^t Cgne antr Brabant, AN EXTREME LOYALIST. \" Sir Henry Brabant, another alderman, profest, if the King should command him to kill a man in cold blood, he took himself bound in conscience and duty to execute his commands.\" \" Life of Ambrose Barnes.\" j]NE of Richardson's reprints— \" The Eve of the Revolution in Newcastle\" (already quoted in our sketch\" of Sir William Blackett the Second)— is a letter to King James II. from Sir Henry Brabant, complaining that his loyalty to the Crown had not been supported as it should have been by some of his colleagues in the municipal government of Newcastle. The writer of this epistle came, like so many other \"men of light and leading\" in Newcastle, from the adjoining palatinate. His father, John Brabant, of Pedgbank, had bound him apprentice, in 1636, to Alexander (afterwards Sir Alexander) Davi- son, one of the leaders of the Royalist party in New- castle, and one of the most venerable and venerated aldermen of that faction. The times were becoming critical when he entered upon his apprenticeship ; they became still more so before his indentures were half com- pleted ; long ere his term expired the country was en- gaged in civil war. In the eighth year of his servitude, when the Scots stormed Newcastle, his master was killed fighting, at the age of eighty, upon the town wall. Trade being at a standstill, he made no effort to secure a \"turnover,\" and when he applied to be admitted to the freedom of the Merchants' Company he was fined for neglecting to complete his apprenticeship. Pleading ig- norance, he obtained a remission of one-half the fine, and on the 1st September he was received into fellowship. Not for long, however, did he enjoy his privileges. He had taken lessons in loyalty from the master who died sword in hand defending the Stuart cause, and express- ing his opinions too freely, he incurred the displeasure of the authorities. By order of Common Council, in 1649, he was publicly disfranchised for being in arms against the Parliament. What became of Mr. Brabant during the interregnum, is not stated. At the Restoration he regained his freedom, and, being impoverished in his estate by the civil commotions, obtained from Charles II. the office of collector of customs, &c., in Newcastle. The Shrievalty came to him in 1662, and five years later he rose to the higher position of Mayor. Excisemen in those days were not usually very popular persons, and even collectors of customs, when invested with municipal authority, were apt to be regarded with aversion. \"There were none that bore office in the excise but rogues,\" said John Lee, yeoman, \" being at William Mason's house in the Bigg Market,\" on the lath October, a few days after Mr. Brabant's election. \" And what was Henry Brabant,\" he temerariously asked, \" but an exciseman ! and none but broken rogues had such places.\" For which outspoken speech, and seditious words against his Majesty, Lee was hauled up before a magistrate, as, at a later date, Albert Hodgson was cited for saying something to the contrary effect. Hodgson being a Catholic, railed at Alderman Davison, son of Brabant's master, \" and did with much invitracye and malice asperse and abuse Mr. Davison,\" adding that \"none of the aldermen were worth anything except Mr. Brabant,\" &c. In the times of the Stuarts, as in our own day, railing and abuse were the common heritage of persons in authority, for party spirit in politics and religion is eternally the same. In the books of the Trinity House is a record that Alderman Henry Brabant and Ralph Jenison were deputed by the town to attend the King in council for the adjustment of a dispute pending between the town and Mr. Edmoud Curtis, who had undertaken to clear away the wrecks in the river. The Hostmen's books contain entries that \"Ralph Jenison, governor, and Henry Brabant, Esq., going to London, are desired to use their endeavours to secure an Act of Parliament for regulating the abuses of collieries,\" &c., and that in 1681 the Hostmen appointed a committee to consult Henry Brabant and other officers in the Custom House, with a view to compel ships to discharge at a proper ballast quay, or shore, within the river. Items of no great importance are these, except to show that Mr. Brabant was living in the sunshine, after some years spent in the shade. The circumstances under which he became Mayor a second time, at Michaelmas, 1685, are given in his letter to the King. In that document he appears as a knight, and it is believed that he received this courtly title at his Majesty's accession in March previous. The honour came too late to be of much use to him. For in June, 1687, being then about 66 years of age, he died — died, as he had lived, a poor man. There is an order of Common Council, dated 1707, by which £5 was to be given \" to Lady Brabant in charity,\" and that is the last time the name appears in the municipal annals of Newcastle. January \\ 1889. / NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. 11 gflje ?Rtt). |oljn $ranb, Jtt.gu, ANTIQUARY AND HI8TOBIAN. The father of John Brand was parish clerk of Washington, near Durham. His daily occupation is not stated ; probably he was a farm labourer, or small handicraftsman ; if he had been in better circumstances, local historians would have told us so. His son John was born on the 19th August, 17*4; his wife died shortly afterwards, and when he married a second time he allowed his brother-in-law, Anthony Wheatley, to bring the boy to Newcastle to be brought up. Mr. Wheatley was a shoemaker in the Back Row, a narrow thoroughfare which extended eastward from the foot of Westgate Street. (A view of the Back Row, which has now disappeared, was given in the Monthly Chronicle, vol. ii., p. 137.) He was only a small tradesman, follow- ing an ill-requited calling in a poor neighbourhood, with squalid surroundings, but he did the best he could for his adopted son. As soon as he was old enough, young Brand was sent to the Royal Free Grammar School of Newcastle, an institution which a newly-appointed headmaster — the Rev. Hugh Moises — was endowing with fresh life. Under his careful tuition, the lad made rapid progress. Wise and thoughtful beyond his years, as boys brought up by foster-parents often are, he became a diligent and obedient scholar — a credit to the school, and a source of pride and gratification to bis teachers. At the age of fourteen he was withdrawn from Mr. Moises's care, and bound apprentice to his uncle. It was, perhaps, fortunate that the sedentary occupa- tion of a cordwainer fell to his lot. Shoemaking, as practised before the introduction of machinery, was favourable to the formation of studious habits. Young Brand had acquired at the Grammar School a taste for learning which he was unwilling to neglect. His uncle, being a lenient master, and most likely proud of the accomplishments of his youthful relative, raised no objec- tion. Thus, unfettered at home, and encouraged by Mr. Moises, the lad kept up his studies, conned over his lessons as he sat at work, and grew up to manhood clever and accomplished. When his indentures of apprenticeship expired, in 1765, Mr. Brand was desirous of utilising his acquirements in a more congenial sphere. But no opening presented itself to his maturing genius, and he remained with his uncle. During his servitude he had begun to woo the Muse, and ventured into print with \"A Collection of Peetical Essays. Newcastle-upon-Tyne : Printed by I. Thompson, Esq., 1765.\" Under the will of Bishop Crewe, Lincoln College, Oxford, was endowed with twelve exhibitions to be held by natives of the diocese of Durham, and in 1768, when Mr. Brand was taking up his freedom of the Cordwainers Company, it occurred to Mr. Moises that the bishop's munificence might be utilised to rescue his gifted protegu from a life of drudgery and indigence. Opulent friends were consulted, and favourable responses obtained. On the 8th of October, 1768, Mr. Brand was admitted a commoner of Lincoln College, and on the 10th of the month following he was elected a Lord Crewe ex- hibitioner, the value of which, at that time, was £30 per annum. His collegiate course lasted three years, and when it was ended he was ordained by Dr. Egerton, Bishop of Durham, and licensed to the curacy of Bolam. In 1773, returning to Newcastle, he officiated as one of the curates of St. Andrew's, and the following year, Mr. Matthew Ridley, of Heaton, gave him his first pre- ferment, the curacy of Cramlington, of the yearly value of £40. While at Oxford, Mr. Brand had renewed his dalliance with the poetic Muse. The subject of his verse was sug- gested by frequent walks along the banks of the Isis to the ruins of Godstow Nunnery, the burial place of \"Fair Rosamond,\" paramour of Henry II. In 1775, when he took his bachelor's degree, he gave these poetical medita- tions to the printer, and they were published in a thin quarto (with a copperplate engraving by Ralph Beilby), under the suggestive title of \"Illicit Love.\" For- tunately, soon after its publication, he turned to a more attractive and more useful study— that of antiquities. In November, 1776, he sent to press, from his residence in Westgate Street, Bourne's little book on the Antiquities of the Common Peo- ple (which had become scarce) with copious addi- tions of his own, under the title of \"Observations on Popular Antiquities.\" This work, expanded from materials which Mr. Brand left behind him, and from other sources, was re-issued in 1813 by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Henry Ellis, and has been several times reprinted. 12 MONTHLY CHRONICLE. A few months after it was published the author was admitted a member of the London Society of Anti- quaries ; the year following he was appointed under usher in the Grammar School of Newcastle, where he had received his early education ; and in 1781, having in the meantime taken his M.A. degree, he was preferred to the ushership. The curacies of Cramlington and St. Andrew's, Newcastle, supplemented by his income as usher, afforded him a moderate competence, and he lived in Newcastle, with his aunt, Mrs. Wheatley, as his house- keeper, in comparative ease and comfort. While thus engaged, be had been collecting materials for a history of Newcastle, and by Christmas, 1783, had made substantial progress with his work. It happened that just at this time the rectory of St. Mary-at-Hill and St. Andrew Hubbard, in the City of London, fell vacant, and the Duke of Northumberland, the patron for that turn, offered the living to Mr. Brand, adding to it the office of private secretary and librarian. On the 8th of February, 1784, he read him- self in at St. Mary-at-Hill, and prepared to take up his permanent abode in London. Directly afterwards, another appointment fell in his way. Dr. Morrell, secretary to the London Society of Antiquaries, died on the 19th of the month, and through the influence of the duke, and the high opinion which his fellow members entertained of his merits, Mr. Brand was unanimously chosen to fill the office. And now, resident in the Metropolis, provided with ample means, and having free access to public records and private collections, Mr. Brand was able to push his history of Newcastle more rapidly towards completion. Frequent reference to it is made in his \" Letters to Ralph Beilby,\" published by the Newcastle Typographi- cal Society. Obtaining from the Common Council of Newcastle, on the 14th June, 1787, permission to dedicate the work to them, he commenced to solicit subscribers, and on the 16th May, 1789, it was announced as ready for delivery, price three guineas, in two volumes, royal quarto, and liberally illustrated with 34- plates, &c., engraved by Mr. Fittler. For two and twenty years Mr. Brand fulfilled the duties of secretary to the Society of Antiquaries and rector of St. Mary-at-Hill. He did not marry, but lived with a housekeeper at the rooms of the society in Somerset Place, Strand, till, prosecuted by common informers for non-residence, he was compelled to occupy his parsonage. After the publication of his \"History,\" nothing of importance issued from his pen. He con- tributed a few papers to the \" Archaeologia,\" and printed a quarto pamphlet about some inscriptions discovered in the Tower of London, and that was all. Not that his pen was idle during that long time. On the contrary, it was constantly at work, though in another direction. He n.ade it the chief business of his life to collect scarce and out-of-the-way books and manuscripts, and enrich them with pen and ink sketches of their authors, explanations of the text, and other useful and critical annotations. Many hundreds of books, pamphlets, and tracts were gathered together at Somerset Place and the parson- age, some of them of the rarest character. Writing a small, thin hand, but clear and legible as print, he was able to compress a great deal of matter into a fly leaf, or the back of a title page, and scores of his treasures were in this way illustrated, explained, and improved. On the morning of the llth of September, 1806, while preparing for his usual walk through the City to the office of the Society of Antiquaries, Mr. Brand suddenly died in his study. He was buried in the chancel of his church of St. Mary-at-Hill, where a tablet, bearing the following inscription, preserves the memory of his pastorate : — Within the Communion Rails lies interred the Body of the Rev. John Brand, 22 years and 6 months the faithful Rector of this and the united Parish of St. Andrew Hubbard. He was also perpetual Curate of Cramlington, in the County of Northumberland, and he was Fellow and Secretary of the Society of Antiquaries. He died llth September, 1806, in the 63rd year of his age. His affectionate Aunt, Mrs. Ann Wheatley, of Newcastle- upon-Tyne, has erected this Monument to his Memory. By his will dated March 14, 1790, Mr. Brand be- queathed all his \" books, English portraits, prints, ancient coins, household furniture, cloaths, and linen,\" and all the residue, &c., to his aunt and sole executrix, Ann Wheatley, who had brought him up. The old lady proceeded to realise the property, and the sale of the books and MSS. which he had gathered together was a notable event in London. A priced catalogue of the first part of the \"Bibliotheca Brandiana\" shows that the sale lasted from May 6 to June 20, 1807, comprised 8,611 lots of books, &e., and 243 lots of MSS., and with a second auction in February follow- ing of more than 4,000 duplicates, and collections of pamphlets, realised £17,000. Probate was granted to Mrs. Wheatley in November, 1806, the value of the property being sworn as under £800. But after the sale, when it was ascertained how inadequately that sum represented the value of Mr. Brand's effects, another probate was issued, and the pre- vious one was declared to be null and void. At Mrs Wheatley's death, her furniture and other goods and chattels were bequeathed to her maid, Mary Sharp, who had lived with Mr. Brand in London. From Mary Sharp, who resided for some years in Cumberland Row, New- castle, and died at the age of 90, they came to her niece Ann, wife of Edward Hudson, of Alnwick, and are now in the possession of Mrs. Hudson's representative, Miss Almond of that town. Among them are Mr. Brand's cabinet of coins and curios, gold watch, clock, portfolio of prints, and various framed pictures and engravings. His writing desk (upon which the Rev. Mr. Wasney, the popular curate of St. Thomas's Chapel, wrote his sermons while lodging with Mary Sharp) is owned by the widow January!

A collection of papers and letters by and relating to Mr. Brand, including his memorandum book for 1799, and a MS. notice of his works by the late Mr. Thomas Bell, was purchased by the Rev. J. R. Boyle, in 1885, and is now in the library of the Newcastle Society of Anti- quaries. Our portrait is taken from a miniature kindly lent by Mr. J. C. Brooks, of Newcastle, who inherited it from Mr. John Martin, librarian to the London University. So far as is known, this is the only recognisable portrait of Mr. Brand in existence, the liknesses prefixed to the \" History of Newcastle,\" and sometimes found attached to the catalogue of the \"Bibliotheca Brandiana, \" being only shadow-outlines, or silhouettes. (George ATTORNEY AND TEMPERANCE REFORMER. In the early part of the present century three brothers named Brewis came from the country to Newcastle, and started business as cartmen. They were industrious, thrifty, God-fearing men, and they prospered. John, the oldest, became an elder and precentor at the High Bridge Presbyterian Chapel, round which loving memories of the Rev. James Murray still lingered, and his brothers William and George were among his fellow-worshippers They all brought up families in respectability and com- fort. One of John Brewis's sons became a popular Independent minister (of him more presently) ; one of William's children was George Brewis, attorney, pioneer of building societies in Newcastle, and temperance reformer. George Brewis was born about the year 1814, in Percy Street, and was educated by Mr. John Weir, a well- known schoolmaster of the period. As a boy he entered the office of Mr. John Clayton, town clerk, where he continued eleven years, and thence transferred his services to Mr. George Tallentire Gibson, to whom he was articled with a view of entering the profession of the law. About 1845, he was placed on the rolls as an attorney and solicitor, and at once commenced a prac. tice as the legal adviser of building societies, the founda- tion of which, with much foresight, he had laid during his clerkship. Incentives to thrift in the form of building societies, and incitements to sobriety in the shape of total abstin- ence pledges, came in together. Joseph Livesey, the founder of teetotalism, visited Newcastle in the autumn of 1835. George Brewis signed the pledge on the 22nd June, 1836, and immediately thereafter became an active propagandist of temperance principles. When the first report of the \" Newcastle Teetotal Society \" came out, its roll of officers was filled with these well-known names :— President, Jonathan Priestman ; secretaries, Jas. Rew- castle (corresponding), Geo. Hornsby (minute), John Benson (registering), and Geo. Brewis (discipline). Following the bent of his own inclination as well as the traditions of his fore-elders, Mr. Brewis was an earnest Nonconformist. As a youth he taught in the Sunday School of High Bridge Chapel ; in manhood he became a member of the Congregational Church assembling in St. James's Chapel, at the head of Grey Street. In politics he was an advanced Liberal, and gave energetic support to Mr. J. F. B. Blackett, Mr. Peter Carstairs, and Mr. (afterwards Sir) Joseph Cowen, in their re- spective candidatures for the representation of New- castle. With municipal matters he did not actively intermeddle till late in life, and then, having been a Poor Law Guardian for a time, he fought for a seat in the Council, and was unsuccessful. Mr. Brewis died suddenly in his office, Royal Arcade, on the 3rd December, 1867, and a few days later was interred in Elswick Cemetery with the solemnities of a public funeral. $eo. SKUltam INDEPENDENT MINISTER. William Brewis, eldest son of the before-named John Brewis, was born in Newcastle on the 8th of October, 1804. Trained to the religious life by his father at High Bridge Chapel, and manifesting early inclinations for the work of the ministry, he was sent to Rotherham Indepen- dent College, in September, 1820, on the eve of his 17th, u MONTHLY CHRONICLE. year. After passing through the usual curriculum, he was called to the pastorate of the church at Lane End in Staffordshire, and on the 26th of April, 1825, received the rite of ordination. His next appointment was at Kirby Moorside ; thence he removed to Gainsborough ; and in 1837 he became minister of the Congregational Church at Penrith, where he remained until called to his reward, thirty-two years later. The congregation at Penrith was small in number and1 in influence when Mr. Brewis entered upon his ministry there, but his preaching attracted hearers, and in no long time he built up a strong and flourishing cause. Such was his success that, after a few years' labour, a new building, in which his Penrith followers might worship with convenience and comfort, became desirable. But, although his hearers were numerous, their resources were slender. It was not until 1865 that they felt justified in commencing to build a place that should be worthy of them and their position. When, however, they did begin, they built for posterity. Completed in July, 1866, at a cost of £3,500, the handsome new edifice became a centre of renewed life and activity, sixty members were added in one year, and the various organisations which have their origin and find their home in a prosperous religious community, grew and flourished under the roof of Penrith Congregational Church. i'or three years only was Mr. Brewis permitted to see the fruition of his labours. The end came somewhat suddenly. In the morning of Saturday, May 22, 1869, after family worship, he complained of sickness, and in the afternoon, sinking from his chair, in a kneeling posture he passed away. On the Wednesday, while his old friend Samuel Plimsoll, M.P., and ministers from all parts of the Northern Counties gathered round, his re- mains were buried in the private cemetery of the congre- gation. A sermon from the text, \" The Lord God is a Sun,\" which he had prepared the day before his death for the ensuing morning service, was read the following Sun- day in a dozen neighbouring chapels, and, being after- wards printed, had a wide circulation. |ol)n Srottec Crockett, AUTHOB OF THE \"GLOSSARY.\" During the fifty years which preceded the general adoption of steam locomotion, when methods of inter- communication and opportunities for interchange of thought and opinion between provincial communities were limited, Newcastle was the home of gifted men, whose acquirements in literature and science, in anti- quities and art, gave the town a definite position among trans-metropolitan centres of intellectual activity. Excel- lent are their names — Adamson and Atkinson, Bewick and Buddie, Burdon and Brockett, Dobson and Double- day, Hodgson, Losh, and Mitchell, Mackenzie, Richard- eon, and Turner, Williamson, Wilson, and Winch. Ad- mirable were their enterprises — the Literary and Philo- sophical Society, Society of Antiquaries, Typographical Society, Institution for the Promotion of the Fine Arts, Botanical and Horticultural Society, Mechanics' In- stitute, and Natural History Society. \"True men were they in their time \" — these pioneers and promoters of cul- ture in Newcastle. \" They rest from their labours\"; but their works, for the most part, survive, and bear testi- mony, generation after generation, to their wisdom and foresight, to their energy and devotion. Among these leaders of thought in Newcastle, John Trotter Brockett was a prominent figure. Born in 1788, JOHN TROTTER BROCKETT. his early surroundings had been in the highest decree favourable to the acquisition of knowledge and the cul- tivation of literary taste. The Rev. William Turner — Unitarian divine, scientific lecturer, and director-general of intellectual progress on both sides the Tyne— super- intended his education ; his father (claiming on the mother's side descent from the Nonconformist family of Angus) was Deputy-Prothonotary in the local Courts of Record, and supervised his studies in mathematics and jurisprudence. His own diligence, aiding the sound training of teacher and parent, enabled him, at the proper age, to enter with confidence upon the profession of the law. Having completed articles with Messrs. Clayton and Brumell, the leading solicitors in the town, he became managing clerk to Mr. Armorer Donkin, in due time was admitted an attorney, married a daughter of John Bell, merchant, and settled down to a lucrative practice. Mr. Brockett commenced at an early period of life to write, to edit, and to publish. In 1817, his name appears as the editor of a new issue of Bartlet's \" Episcopal Coins January! NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. 15 -of Durham and the Monastic Coins of Reading, Minted during the Rei(rns of Edwards I., II., and III.\" Heat the same time reprinted two rare tracts — one of 1627, \"A Short View of the Long Life and Reigne of Henry the Third\"; the other, dated 1650, being \"An Exact Narration of the Life and Death of the Reverend and Learned Prelate and Painful Divine, Launcelot Andre wes, late Bishop of Winchester.\" The excellence of the typo- graphy displayed in these reprints by the printer (Mrs. Hodgson) induced him to suggest the formation of a society for the re-issuing of scarce tracts, and the preservation of local compositions, in the best style of printing that the town could produce. He was busy at this time with a learned treatise upon a question that was occupying the attention of local politicians, and the following year it was issued, with the long-drawn title of \"An Enquiry into the Question whether the Freeholders of the Town and County of Newcastle-upon-Tyne are entitled to vote for members of Parliament for the County of Northumber- land\"— an inquiry, by the way, that was answered by the Reform Bill. As soon as this, his first bit of inde- pendent authorship, was out of hand, Mr. Brockett resumed his reprint proposals. A pamphlet on \"Hints on the Propriety of Establishing a Typographical Society in Newcastle,\" which he published in the same year as the \" Enquiry,\" led to the formation of a literary organisation based upon his suggestions. The Newcastle Typographical Society sprang into being at once, and, although its aims were limited and some of the members were not very careful about the utility of the productions which they put forth, a collection of their tracts— about 80 in number — is not without historical value. The society printed for private distribution as a rule, and in very limited numbers, Of some of their publica- tions only twenty copies were issued ; of a few as many as 300 were struck off, and these were generally offered for sale, but for the most part the number printed was a hundred. On various issues were engraved the special devices of the issuing members, being generally cuts by Bewick, representing a ruin with armorial bearings. Mr. Brockett's vignette, which appears upon a dozen of the tracts, was one of the most striking, as his pamphlets were, from a historical point of view, among the most valuable of the series. In 1825, appeared the first edition of his far-famed \" Glossary of North-Country Words\" ; it was followed in 1829 by another and much more comprehensive book under the same title ; and after Mr. Brockett's death, his son, aided by local men of letters, brought out the work in the two-volume form that is now most com- monly met with. A \" Glossographia Anglicana,\" from MSS. which Mr. Brockett had prepared for publication, was privately printed a few years ago in \"The Sette of Odd Volumes, \"with a biographical sketch by Frederick Bloomer. From the title of the first book to which Mr. Brockett put his name it may be inferred that he was interested in the collection of coins and medals. To a knowledge of numismatics, which was at once deep and wide, he added a passion for gathering together not only the shining discs which attract men to that special cult, but curios of all kinds, and especially rare editions of rare books. Mr. Fenwick tells us that his collection of the former at a ten days' sale in London, in 1823, realised £1,760; and his library of scarce and curious books, which occupied fourteen days in the selling, brought £4-, 260. No sooner had he disposed of these treasures than he began to accumulate afresh. Dr. Dibdin, the famous antiquary, passing through New- castle in 1837, was entertained by the literati of the town, and in the charming book which he after- wards published, \"A Bibliographical, Antiquarian, and Picturesque Tour in the Northern Counties of England and in Scotland,\" describes his intercourse with Mr. Brockett in terms of mingled humour and apprecia- tion : — More than once was the hospitable table of my friend, John Trotter Brockett, Esq., spread to receive me. He lives comparatively in a nut-shell : but what a kernel ! Pictures, books, curiosities, medals, coins of precious value, bespeak his discriminating eye and his liberal heart. You may revel here from sunrise to sunset, and fancy the domains interminable. Do not suppose that a stated room, or rooms, are only appropriated to his BOKES : they are \" upstairs, downstairs, and in my lady's chamber.\" They spread all over the house— tendrils of pliant curve and perennial verdure. For its size, if 1 except those of one or two Sannatyners, I am not sure whether this be not about the choicest collection of books which I saw on my tour. From an early period of his life Mr. Brockett was a member of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle, and for some years preceding his death he undertook the responsible duties of one of its secretaries. He assisted at the formation of the Newcastle Society of Antiquaries, and became an active member of its Council. The Newcastle and Gateshead Law Society found in him 16 MONTHLY CHRONICLE. one of its warmest supporters, and awarded him, in 18J2, its special thanks for services he had rendered to the pro- fession before a Parliamentary Committee. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London ; the well-known initials of that institution formed the only affix that he consented to couple with his name. In domestic life, he was a pattern of all that was amiable. His family participated with him in his favourite studies and pursuits, and his home was the abode of peace and happiness. Some years previously to his death he lost his eldest sen. He sustained the shock with surprising fortitude ; but it may have been the remote cause of his death, which occurred at his house in Albion Street on the 12th of October, 1842, in the 54th year of his age. was the popular name given to two Hfe-sized leaden figures which for many years formed the chief attraction and laud- mark in Broad Street (now Roker Avenue), at the junction of Fulwell Lane and Church Street, Monk- in its later days by \" Gentleman John,\" a soubriquet which clung to Mr. John Smith, shipowner, all through his successful career from a blacksmith to a capitalist. But previous to this it ia said to have been the residence of the great-grandfather of the late Mr. George Cooper Abbes, of Cleadon Hall, who purchased the two figures' which had been brought over from Germany (with ten more) by some speculative skipper, and set them up to adorn the entrance to his house. The other figures found their way into the hands of different gentlemen in the County Palatine, and most of them have probably Jong ere this been melted down for the sake of the lead. The duty on lead, in the shape of ore, was four pounds a ton a hundred years ago, whereas the Babbies, being \"works of art,\" would be admitted either duty free or for a com- paratively small charge.

Mr. Kae's wife was the sister of a Miss Gilbert, the mother of the celebrated Lola Montez, whose real name was Eliza Gilbert. Eliza, whose father is said to have been an officer in the British army serving in India, was sent home from the East while yet a mere child, and boarded January I 1889. j NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. 17 with Mr. and Mrs. Rae, from whom she received the elements of a Rood substantial English education. She had for her schoolfellows many who, when she after- wards became world-famous, remembered her as a very interesting, clever, pretty girl. A few years ago, the Babbies were presented to the Roker Park, where they may now be seen ; but it is proposed to place them on the pillars at the entrance from Roker Promenade when the gateway shall have been completed. The style of dress denotes the figures to be of German or Dutch manufacture. The scythe which the man is represented in the act of sharpen- ing, is the Flemish or Hainault scythe, with which a good workman could cut an acre of corn easily in a day, and which was introduced into this country by some enter- prising farmers about fifty years ago, to take the place of the Irish scythe-hook, which had itself supplanted the old toothed hook or sickle, all to be rendered obsolete in their turn by the reaping machine. TOmft at tire (HE wreck of the Stanley at the mouth of the Tyne took place on the 24th of November, 1864. During the early part of that day, a strong breeze blew from the east-south-east. It was not, however, sufficiently violent off the mouth of the Tyne to account for the gradual rise of the waves as the day advanced. In the afternoon, the storm, of which the wind from the quarter indicated had been the herald, gradually grew in violence until it became evident that there were serious grounds for apprehension as to the safety of vessels which were then in the offing. About half-past four o'clock an occurrence took place which, unfortunately, proved the precursor of further and more serious disasters. One of the Tyne Commis- sioners' hoppers, in tow of a steam-tug belonging to Mr. Lawson, of South Shields, was outside the bar, when the towline parted. The hopper was driven behind the North Pier, the two men who were on board of her being rescued by means of life-buoys by some of the pier men ; while the tug was dashed upon the Herd Sands, whence her crew were saved by the South Shields lifeboat. The next vessel which ran on shore proved to be the passenger steamer Stanley. This fine vessel was the property of the Aberdeen Steam Navigation Company. She was an iron screw- steamer, and was built at West Hartlepool by Messrs. Pile, Spence, and Co. in 1859. Her register tonnage was 376, her actual burthen being 552 tons. She had sailed from Aberdeen on the previous night, bound for London, in charge of Captain Howling, having a crew of 2j hands, all told. The number of passengers at the time of sailing was 30, about half of whom were women. The vessel had also a full cargo on board, and on her deck were about 48 cattle and 30 sheep. She proceeded on her voyage with every prospect of reaching her desired haven in safety, until off the Northumberland coast, where she first began to experience the effects of the storm. Finding the sea so turbulent in-shore, the Stanley stood out seaward in the expectation of finding smoother water, but discovered th:it she was only run- 18 MONTHLY CHRONICLE. IK* ning into the full force of the gale. In this terrible plight, the captain determined to steam for the Tyne, the mouth of which was reached about a quarter to five o'clock. The master had only once during his nautical career been in the Tyne, and that was about twenty years previously. Under these circumstances, he na- turally felt considerable hesitation in taking the bar, more especially as the tidal lights were not then burning. He fired a couple of rockets for a pilot, but none came off. A tug-steamer did, indeed, leave the harbour, but she never approached near to the Stanley. The mate, however, who had frequently sailed to and from the Tyne, expressed his readiness to steer the vessel into port. The captain yielded to his representations, and the head of the steamer was turned towards the bar. This was safely crossed. But the ship had got no further than just off the Spanish Battery, when, with a dreadful shock, she struck upon the rocks known as the Black Middens. As soon as the peril of the Stanley was seen from the shore, a number of the coastguardsmen set about getting the rocket apparatus ready for firing. The Tynemouth lifeboat, the Constance, was promptly manned, while the North Shields lifeboats, the Northumberland and Providence, with the South Shields lifeboats, William Wake, Tyne, and Fly, were also got out and pulled down the harbour into the Narrows. Intelligence of the catastrophe spread with lightning-like rapidity, and the consternation and excitement of the inhabitants in the sister towns at the mouth of the Tyne were intense. The night was pitch dark, and from the elevated headland overlooking the harbour the sea could be made out only by a broad band of white foam ; but a couple of hundred yards from the shore could be dimly discerned through the gloom some dark object indicating the position of the ill-fated vessel. The roar of the waves, too, was deafening ; but in the lulls of the storm the despair- ing wail of the poor creatures exposed to the pitiless waves was heard with painful and agonizing distinctness. As the tide fell, the rocket apparatus was carried over the rocks, and preparations were made to establish means of communication with those on board. Before the disaster, the Stanley had been provided with four lifeboats ; but, after striking upon the rocks, three of these were speedily smashed to pieces. An attempt was made to launch the remaining lifeboat ; and for this purpose four of the crew got into her, taking with them four female passengers. While the boat, however, was being lowered from the davits, a heavy sea caused her to turn round and sink. Three of the seamen were rescued by those on board, but the four ladies and the fourth seaman were, in a moment, swept beyond the reach of aid. After firing one or two abortive rockets, the coastguard at last succeeded in establishing communication with the Stanley. The line carried by the rocket was soon the .means of carrying a stout warp between. the vessel and the shore ; and upon this warp the cradle was slung. The first man to venture into the cradle was an ordinary seaman, named Andrew Campbell, who was safely conveyed to the shore amid the cheers of the bystanders. A second seaman and a woman next got into the cradle, but, unhappily, they fell or were thrown out, and were drowned. The second mate, James Knipp, then took his place in the cradle, and was safely drawn through the raging waters to the shore. Owing to an unfortunate error of judgment on tho part of some one, the hawser was secured in such a manner that it was no higher than the rail of the ship, the consequence being that those on shore could not get it clear of the water. The result of the mistake was soon painfully palpable. When a seaman named Buchan had been drawn about midway between the vessel and the shore, the bight of the warp was borne by his weight against the rocks, amongst which the whip-line of the cradle became entangled, and the cradle itself was brought to a standstill. Inspired by the strength born of despair, the determined fellow managed to haul himself hand-over-hand to the shore by the warp. The warp and cradle being, by this untoward accident, rendered use- less, an end was put for the time being to any further efforts in that direction ; and the unfortunate pas- sengers and crew still on board were left to their fate until the full tide of the morning should afford an opportunity for the resumption of measures for their rescue. The captain and his mate appear to have done every- thing in their power towards saving the passengers from being swept away. Two women — the only two who were afterwards saved — were induced to place themselves in the foretop, where they were securely lashed ; and three or four more were bound to the shrouds beneath. The bulk of the female passengers, however, were too much affrighted and prostrated by the fearful experiences through which they were passing to venture from the deck. About half-past nine o'clock, the steamer was struck by a tremendous sea. The hull yielded to the irresistible blow, and parted abaft the mainmast. The force of the waves swung the fore part and larger portion of the vessel completely round until it was left in a position with the bow breasting the waves. At this time the whole of those on board were on the larger portion of the vessel. The second-class cabin was on the deck, and the top of it formed what was known as the bridge or \"look- out.\" Affording as it did a place of refuge from the breakers which poured incessantly upon the doomed vessel, it became crowded by female passengers and a portion of the crew. All were tightly lashed to the rails by which the sides were guarded. But a terrific breaker swept the entire structure, with its shrieking occupants, into the sea, where they all perished. January I NORTH-COUNTRY LORE AND LEGEND. 19 The survivors in other parts of the vessel had taken refuge in the fore and main rigging, whence several of them were washed into the sea. The same fate befel two of the women who had been lashed to the shrouds, while another, unable to bear up against the exposure and hardships of that terrible trial, expired from exhaustion. About five o'clock next morning the sea had suffi- ciently fallen to permit a resumption of the exertions to save the survivors. Three rockets were fired before a communication with the vessel was established. This time those on board made the warp fast to the mast- head, by which means it was kept out of the angry surf, and the incline materially facilitated the working of the cradle. Soon all was ready for recommencing the work of rescue, and in a few minutes afterwards the whole of the survivors were brought safely to land. There were lost, in all, about twenty-six lives ; and with the other disasters which occurred at the harbour's mouth during that memorable night, the catalogue of mortality was swollen to between thirty and forty. There has since been no such lamentable experience in the history of Tyne navigation, the great improve- ments effected by the enterprise of the River Com- missioners having largely contributed to the greater im- munity from fatal disaster which is now enjoyed, while the brave members of the Tyneraouth Volunteer Life Brigade, which owes its origin to the wreck of the Stanley, are ever ready to render assistance when neces- sity arises. The sketch of the wreck which accompanies this article is taken from a painting by Mr. J. W. Swift, a local artist of the time. (Cite j|HE whole surface of the globe, so far as it has been inhabited and explored by man, is supposed to have been infested more or less in former times, if not still, by super- natural beings of one sort or another. Some of these sprites have been held to be beneficent, others malig- nant, others again only mischievous or tricksy. Some seem to have been thought ubiquitous, if not omni- present, or at least able to appear, or capable of being called up, at any time or place ; while others are local goblins, frequenting particular spots, and never wandering beyond certain narrow limits. The counties of Durham and Northumberland are popularly believed to have abounded as much as any known region with these crea- tures of the imagination, which have not even yet been all forced to flee away by the spread of secular know- ledge. The Brownie and Dobie, the Brown Man of the Moors, Redcap, Dunnip, Hob Headless, Silky, the Cauld Lad of Hilton, the Picktree Brag, are all local sprites of more or less celebrity, haunting particular spots, and varied in characteristics. The Hedhy Kow is not one of the least famous of the number. According to all accounts, this Kow was a \"bogie,\" mischievous rather than malignant, which haunted the village of Hedley, near Ebchester. Some uncertainty pre- vails as to the precise locality here indicated; for there are at least four Hedleys within a short distance of the old Roman station on the Derwent, viz., Hedley, near ilickley, in the parish of Whittonstall ; Black Hedley, near Eddy's Bridge— both in Northumberland ; Hedley, or Hedley Hall, on the skirts of Blackburn Fell, formerly a great waste, in the parish of Lamesley ; and Hedley Hope, near Cornsay, in the parish of Lanchester— the two last in the county of Durham. Whichever of these four neighbourhoods was that haunted by the Kow, it is perhaps impossible now to tell. Neither, in fact, does it matter very much, as the localities are only a few miles from each other, with only the river Derwent intervening. One thing all are agreed on, the Kow did nobody any serious injury, but merely took delight in frightening people. To whomsoever he appeared, lie usually ended his frolics with a hoarse laugh at their fear or astonsihment, after he had played them some sorry trick. To an old woman, for instance, gathering sticks, like Goody Blake, by the hedge side, if not actually out of the hedge, he would sometimes appear as a \"fad\" or truss of straw, lying on the road. If, as was natural, the dame was tempted to take possession of this \"fad,\" her load in carrying it home would become so heavy that she would be obliged to lay it down. The straw would then appear as if \"quick,\" the truss would rise upright like the patriarch Joseph's sheaf, and away it would shuffle before her along the road, swinging first to one side and then to another. Every now and then it would set up a laugh, or give a shout, in the manner of a rustic dancer when he kicks his heels and snaps his fingers at the turn of the tune ; and at last, with a sound like a rushing wind, it would wholly vanish from her sight. Two men belonging to Newlands, on the left bank of the Derwent, opposite Ebchester — a place now rendered famous in connection with the mysterious person who claimed to be Countess of Derwentwater — went out one night about the beginning of the present century to meet their sweethearts. On arriving at the appointed place, they saw, as they supposed, the two girls walking at a short distance before them. The girls continued to walk onwards for two or three miles, and the young men to follow without being able to overtake them. They quickened their pace, but still the girls kept before them ; and at length, when the pair found themselves up to their knees in a mire, the girls suddenly disappeared with a most unfeminine ha, ha, ha !
