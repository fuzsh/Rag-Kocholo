        "text": "Janice Reinders McArdle, (“Jan”), passed away Sunday, May 7, 2023. She was 71. Jan, a native Texan, was born to James Webster Reinders and Violet Strong Reinders. The family moved frequently until the fall of 1966 when they relocated to the New Orleans area. Jan enrolled at St. Mary’s Dominican High School where she was a National Merit Scholar. At Dominican she made many lifelong friendships. After graduating from Dominican, she attended Tulane University’s Newcomb College where she earned a degree in biology, graduating in 1973. While at Tulane, she also studied French, spending her Junior year abroad in Paris, France, attending the College of Sorbonne. In 1969, Jan met her future husband Patrick Dennis McArdle (“Pat”). They married in November 1973 and had 2 children, Peter Fox McArdle and Kelly Mae McArdle. Jan was a devoted mother to her children. She was a founding member of the preschool program, Infancy to Independence (“I to I”) and was the Cub Scout and Girl Scout leader for her children’s troops at St. Pius X School. After raising her children, she went on to open Passages, a French antique store on Magazine Street. She enjoyed her many buying trips to France with her business partners. During her husband Pat’s (14 year) long battle with brain cancer she was his devoted caretaker. After his passing she turned her attention to real estate, working as an agent at Latter & Blum until her granddaughters were born. Her granddaughters, Madeleine Fox Millet and Charlotte Rose Millet, were her everything. She provided care for them and enjoyed many activities with them: reading, educating, French tutoring, cooking, playing games, and having fun in general. Jan was an amazing cook, a lover of nature and the outdoors, a breast cancer survivor, a fancier of cats, a marathon runner, an expert Scrabble player, and a world traveler. She was beautiful, on the inside and out, an inspirational human being - wise, intelligent, hardworking, resilient, patient, bighearted, generous, caring, and loving.\n\nJan is survived by her children, Peter Fox McArdle, and Kelly McArdle Millet [her favorite (and only) son-in-law, Matthew]; her granddaughters Madeleine and Charlotte; her siblings James “Jimmy” Reinders [Andrea], and Jody Cook [Michael]; and a host of friends and extended family members.\n\nJan was a long time and current parishioner at Our Lady of the Rosary Parish and for many years at Saint Francis Xavier Catholic Church where she served in the adoration chapel. Additionally, she served as an Extraordinary Minister of the Eucharist in both parishes.\n\nJan’s funeral mass will be held on Saturday, May 20, 2023, at 11:00 AM at Our Lady of the Rosary Catholic Church at 3368 Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans, LA 70119. Her family will receive friends and family before the service starting at 10:00 AM. In lieu of flowers, memorial contributions may be made to the City Park Conservancy [neworleanscitypark.org/support-your-park]. At a later date, there will be a graveside service in Clear Lake, Indiana, and Janice will be laid to rest next to the love of her life, her husband, Patrick, in Covenanter Cemetery. Greenwood Funeral Home, 5200 Canal Blvd., New Orleans, LA 70124 is in charge of arrangements. Condolences may be expressed at www.greenwoodfh.com\n\nTo plant a beautiful memorial tree in memory of Janice Kay Reinders McArdle, please visit our Tree Store."
