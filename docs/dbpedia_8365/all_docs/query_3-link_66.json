        "text": "May 17, 1941 - Aug. 9, 2011\n\nIt is with shock and despair that the family of Peter Eamon McArdle announces his sudden passing at home on August 9th, 2011.\n\nBorn in Castleblayney, Northern Ireland, Eamon came to Fort MacMurray, Alberta in the winter of 1960. From there Eamon moved to 108 Mile Ranch in 1972, where he was actively involved with the 108 Lions, Knights of Columbus, and Ducks Unlimited. Eamon ran the first 108 Store near the mail kiosk and bartended at the Lakeview Inn (Exeter Arms) in town. Later he entered the insurance business in which he remained until his retirement in 2005.\n\nEamon was well-known and will be remembered for his sense of humour and penchant for telling tall tales. Among his passions were gardening, nature, the community, and of course, the horses.\n\nHe is survived by his loving wife of 25 years jennifer raifteiri-mcardle, daughters Mavis Conrad (Kevin Conrad, Medicine Hat, Alta.), Crystal and Elanis McArdle, son Patrick (Misty Colburn, Yellowknife, NWT), grandsons Liam and Brendan Graff, Bernard Immel (Kamloops, B.C.), and numerous brothers, sisters-in-law, nieces, nephews and cousins in Alberta and Ireland.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation or the charity of your choice.\n\nA mass will be held 11:00 a.m. Friday, August 19th at St. Judeâ€™s Catholic Church, with an informal gathering to follow at the 108 Community Hall from 1:00 to 3:00 p.m. Please bring a favourite snack to share."
