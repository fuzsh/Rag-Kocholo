        "text": "Doris Anne Dillon McArdle passed away peacefully in her home on Easter Sunday, March 31, 2024, with family and loved ones by her side.\n\nDoris was born in Teaneck, New Jersey on May 12th, 1927, the youngest child of Michael and Helen Missbach Dillon and sibling to Helen, (Clarke) Catherine (Markey) and Michael Jr. (Buddy.)\n\nShe attended St. Cecelia’s High School in Englewood, New Jersey and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Mount Saint Vincent College in the Bronx. She was a proud “Mountie” from the class of 1949.\n\nDoris married Henry McArdle, her high school sweetheart and fellow St. Cecelia classmate, on April 15, 1950. For 58 years they shared a life together, raising 11 children. Their family grew to include 24 grandchildren and 21 great-grandchildren, all of whom loved and cherished their “Grandma Doris and Pappa.”\n\nFamily life was a never-ending challenge for Doris. For many years she handled day-to-day parenting duties while Henry traveled for work. Her faith in God and her strength and determination helped the family persevere during these times and when the task of raising a large family seemed overwhelming. It was hard work, but she thrived in the role.\n\nAs her children grew older, Doris worked outside the home as a receptionist and scheduler at New York Oncology in Rexford, New York. Her job gave her tremendous personal fulfillment working alongside oncologists and staff and helping cancer patients and their families.\n\nDoris loved flowers and her garden. She loved fashion and interior design and always followed current events. The Sunday papers were her favorite. She danced and loved music, especially Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett whose songs and lyrics she knew by heart. Music brought joy and comfort in her final days as it did her entire life. She had a hearty laugh to go along with her big heart and kind soul.\n\nDoris enjoyed many happy times – There were summer vacations in Milford and Old Lyme Connecticut and trips abroad with Henry along with large gatherings at Thanksgiving with family at their home in Clifton Park. Nothing made Doris and Henry happier than having family gather around holidays and other special occasions.\n\nThey loved and cherished their family. It was their legacy and proudest achievement.\n\nDoris was predeceased by her husband Henry McArdle, their beloved children Maureen and Michael McArdle, and her parents and siblings.\n\nShe is survived by her children Eileen McArdle, Mary McNelis (David); John McArdle (Patricia); Sheila Charlson (Peter); Brian McArdle (Judy); Patricia Tracey (Kevin); Thomas McArdle; Anne Hoffman (Charles); James McArdle (Tina) and daughter-in-law Suzanne McArdle.\n\nShe is also survived by her grandchildren Adam, Jeff, Rob and Matt Werther; Kaivalya and Will Miller; Andrew (Kelly) and Kevin (Holly) McNelis, Katie Garcia (Lindley) and Meghan Goff (Dan) ; Allison McArdle Avery (Brian) and Kathleen McArdle (Adam); Matt Charlson and Meghan Polhemus; Caitlin (Michael) and Brendan McArdle (Maria); Maureen Connolly (Patrick), Mary Bridget, Katherine (Jack) and Margaret Tracey; Lauren Brock (Anthony) Michaela and Charlie Hoffman; Taylor and Zac McMahon and her many great-grandchildren.\n\nAll will miss Doris dearly.\n\nThe family gives special thanks to the many aides who cared for Doris over the years, and to her doctors, Christopher Murphy and Kevin Costello. Your love and compassionate care will never be forgotten.\n\nThere will be a Christian Mass of Celebration in memory of Doris at St Edward the Confessor Church 569 Clifton Park Center Rd. Clifton Park, NY 12065 on Wednesday April 10, 2024 at 11:00 am. A calling hour will precede the mass in the Church. Burial will be at 1:00 pm at the Gerald B.H. Solomon Saratoga National Cemetery in Schuylerville, New York.\n\nThe Funeral Mass will be live streamed and able to be viewed by using the following information;\n\nJoin Zoom Meeting\n\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/82199159941?pwd=ZXB4cDZ5OXF4S2swejYvYlBFY0puUT09\n\nMeeting ID: 821 9915 9941\n\nPasscode: 0565\n\nThe family is asking that in lieu of flowers donations be made to the National Organization of Rare Diseases at NORD, Inc. - Donations, Dept. 5930, P.O.

Emerick Funeral Home, 1550 Route 9, Clifton Park, NY 12065. 518-371-5454.\n\nPlease feel free to offer your on-line Condolences by using that tab on this page."
