        "text": "ANDOVER â€” Nancy Burns McArdle, a longtime resident of Andover, died peacefully at her home of 54 years on Tuesday, Nov. 30, 2010. She was 90-years-old and was the beloved wife of the late Dr. John J. McArdle, Jr.\n\nBorn in Andover on June 5, 1920, she was the daughter of the late David and Florence (Soutar) Burns. Nancy was educated at St. Augustine's Parochial School in Andover and at Abbot Academy, which is now part of Phillips Academy Andover. She then enrolled at Smith College and she graduated with a degree in biology. After Smith, she attended the Prince Program in Retail Management at Simmons College. Her studies were cut short when she was offered a job in the retail training program at Bamberger's (owned by Macy's) in New York City. She lived in New York City from 1943 until she married in 1946. She and her husband returned to Andover in 1947 when Dr. McArdle opened his medical practice and they started their family.\n\nIn addition to being a wife and mother, Nancy also was active and generous in her volunteer work. She was a member of the Lawrence General Hospital Auxiliary and became its President. From there she was asked to join the Ladies Committee at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where she served a term as its Chairman. When Nancy volunteered, she did so wholeheartedly. She loved meeting and working with people and addressing new challenges.\n\nShe will be sorely missed by her loving children, Nancy Schofield Worthen and her husband Frederic P. Worthen Jr. of Newnan, Ga., John J. McArdle III and his wife Joan Creamer McArdle of Reading, Susan McArdle and her husband David Koelle, M.D. of Seattle, and Peter S. McArdle and his wife Cynthia Lee McArdle of North Hampton, N.H. She is also survived by three grandchildren, Frederic P. Worthen III, Sarah Worthen Harter, and Samson J. Koelle; two great-grandchildren, Isabel Harter and John B. Harter II; her sister-in-law, Janet Young Burns; and many nieces and nephews. She was predeceased by her sister, Florence Burns Bowen and her brother, David Burns, Jr.\n\nARRANGEMENTS: A funeral Mass will be held on Friday, Dec. 3, 2010 at 9 a.m. at St. Augustine's Church, Andover, with internment at Spring Grove Cemetery in Andover. Relatives and friends are kindly invited. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Nancy's memory to Schepens Eye Research Institute, 20 Staniford St., Boston, MA 02114. Funeral arrangements are under the direction of the Kenneth H. Pollard Funeral Home, 233 Lawrence St., Methuen.
