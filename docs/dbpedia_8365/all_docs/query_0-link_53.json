        "text": "As the third volume of a trilogy, this book recounts the story of everyday life in the town of Bletchley during the years 1945, 1946 and 1947.\n\nDespite rationing, despite the ever present threats of enemy air raids and invasion, and despite the long hours of work, compounded by the need to tend allotments and also perform duties for Civil Defence, the population maintained a strong sense of community, and during the research for this book it quickly became evident that the ‘wartime spirit’ was indeed no myth.\n\nEven when news from the battlefronts was far from encouraging the Council remained unperturbed, and not only carried on with planning the development of the town after the war, but also dealing with the more mundane matters of everyday life, to include cows straying across allotments, squabbles over billeting arrangements, and children swinging on shop blinds.\n\nThe study material for this book has of course included a wealth of prime source official documents and local news archives. Yet as equally invaluable have been the recollections of the many people who had been residents in the town before and during the war, or who came to the town as evacuees. Indeed meeting them proved a sincere privilege for, as soon became very apparent, they represent a Britain that had very different standards and values from those of the modern society. Attributes in fact that made the eventual outcome of the war not just an optimistic possibility, but an inevitable conclusion.\n\nIn January Mrs. Isabella Noble Wodhams, who for many years had been the infant headmistress at the Bletchley Road schools, died at the age of 81. Born as Isabella Walker, she had married the late Charles Wodhams, a local coal merchant, and being a resident of Church Street she would remain on the staff at the Infants School until her retiring age. On January 8th the pupils returned to Bletchley Road Senior School, and the following day the headmaster, Mr. Cook, attended an interview with the Committee of the Foundation of Educational Research in London. However, travel was hardly favoured by the weather, and on January 10th due to a severe snowstorm the school buses were very late, with none at all arriving from Great Brickhill. Even when a thaw began the roads were covered in slush, and a giant snowball outside the Bletchley Road schools resisted melting for quite a long while. At the Bletchley Road Senior School the attendance was now comprised of, 11 years but under 12 years, 23 boys and 29 girls, 12 years to 13 years, 54 boys and 61 girls, 13 years to 14 years, 62 boys and 58 girls, and 14 years to 15 years, 6 boys and 7 girls. This made a total of 300 pupils - 45 boys and 155 girls - and on the afternoon of January 30th they no doubt greatly enjoyed ‘The Young America Exhibition’ at which, being illustrated by films and pictures, Sergeant Elmore gave the children a delightful talk about his home country. This was followed by ‘an informative half an hour’, and on June 15th the Young America Exhibition would again pay a visit, with Sergeant Elmore and Sergeant Jones in charge. As for another informative occasion, on the afternoon of February 7th Mr. Kew, the County School Dentist, paid a visit to the school where, illustrated by films and charts, he gave a lecture on ‘The Care of the Teeth’.\n\nAt Aylesbury, on February 24th Mr. Cook attended a conference for all head teachers. This had been convened to consider the change of status of the school after March 3rd, but for Miss M. Brown, who for the past six years had been in charge of the nursery class at Bletchley Road Infants’ School, there was a change of status towards the end of the month, for she had now secured a position at a Slough nursery school. With the chairman of the School Managers, Mr. W. Brown, presiding, at a farewell ceremony she was presented with Savings Certificates, and it was therefore without Miss Brown that, on a following Wednesday, the Bletchley Road Infants’ School held their Parents’ Day. Adorned with springtime decorations the rooms had been made very bright, and on an even brighter note a collection for the Red Cross raised 30s. As for adult education, at 7.30p.m. on Wednesday, February 28th the W.E.A. A.G.M. took place. This was held at the Bletchley Road Senior School, being followed at 8p.m. by a public meeting on the subject of ‘Adult Education for Democracy.’\n\nClosure came at the end of February for the London Senior Boys’ School which, quartered in Bletchley Park Pavilion, had been evacuated to Bletchley early in the war. Having originally travelled to Bletchley with the boys, Mr. Jackson had taught them until his transfer to the Yeomanry Hall last Easter, but when the headmaster at the Pavilion retired he was then appointed to fill this vacant position. However, he was also to now retire, and marking the occasion would be the presentation of a cheque at a social gathering in the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church. Here letters were read from both the former headmaster, Mr. S. Taylor, and a former colleague, Mr. Michael, and on behalf of the children and parents a moving tribute was also paid by the headmistress of the Old Bletchley and Yeomanry Hall schools, Mrs Zilpah Bailey. As for the lessened number of pupils now attending the London Senior Boys’ School, they would be transferred to St. Martin’s Hall, with Mr W. Davies as the headmaster. For a thesis on Edward Benlowes, (one of the less well known of the Elizabethan dramatists), in March it was announced that Harold Jenkins, M.A., the eldest son of Mrs. M. Jenkins of 18, Vicarage Road, had been awarded a D. Litt. by the University of Witwatersrand, in Johannesburg. In fact this was rather appropriate, since it was on the radio station of this city that Dr. Jenkins, the senior lecturer in English at the University, broadcast a regular review. Towards the end of March a jumble sale was held by the headmistress, staff and pupils of St Mary’s Church of England School, and of the £21 that was duly raised equal sums would be divided between the School Fund and the Overseas League Tobacco Fund. This had been established for the benefit of soldiers, sailors and airmen, and already the children had received many appreciative letters from the men who were serving in the fighting zones. With music by the Melody Makers, on March 31st the Parents Association held a dance at the Senior School Hall from 7.30p.m. to 11.45p.m., and on April 12th the pupils were no doubt also dancing for joy when, having closed on March 27th, the Bletchley Road Senior School reopened. However, due to the recent Education Act this would now be styled as a ‘Modern Secondary School’, and, having been written by the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, the activities of the new order would be detailed in a two column article in the Times Educational Supplement.\n\nFrom Thursday, April 19th, for a fee of 2s 6d Mr. N. Masterman, ‘one time lecturer at Budapest University’, began a local six week course in International Relations, whilst on Wednesday, May 2nd ‘Education in the Future’ was the subject of Miss I. Haswell, of Tynemouth. As President of the N.U.T., at 7.30p.m. she addressed a public meeting of the Bletchley and District Association of the N.U.T., with the venue being the Bletchley Road Senior School Hall. Elsewhere, the major scholarship held by Miss Bettine Hanks had now been extended for another year, although this was subject to her gaining admission to the London University Institute of Education. At the ‘Modern Secondary School’, from 8.30p.m. to 3p.m. two kitchen maids were now required, and the need had also arisen for a full-time male assistant caretaker. No accommodation was offered, but the position would pay £12 a month plus war bonus - presently £59 19s p.a. - and, supplying two recent testimonials, applicants were to contact Mr. Ernest Marchant, at The Elms, Bletchley. On May 8th V.E. Day was announced, and in consequence the school was closed for two days. Then in the presence of the chairman of the U.D.C., on the afternoon of Wednesday, May 16th a special Victory Celebration took place at the Bletchley Park sports ground and, featuring general sports, massed country dancing and a picnic tea, the events commenced with a fancy dress parade. With the blindfolded masters being lead by the mistresses, a teachers race caused much amusement, and it would seem quite appropriate that the headmaster, Mr. E. Cook, and his partner would be the winners! The obligatory effigy of Hitler was burnt on a bonfire, and in further celebrations on Friday, June 8th the Bletchley Road Primary School devoted the whole of the day to commemorating the Victory. Souvenir programmes had been prepared on the premises, and, after school prayers and a thanksgiving, a film programme at the County Cinema was shown in the morning, consisting of cartoons, wild west, comedy and interest features. The children were then addressed by the chairman of the Council, to whom a vote of thanks was expressed, and a vote of thanks was also expressed to the cinema manager, Mr. J. Betteridge, who was presented with tobacco. As for his wife, she received a bouquet, whilst the projectionist, Mr. R. Coley, was given cigarettes. During the afternoon a programme of country dancing and games then took place, and with contributions having been made by parents and friends of the school, this was followed by a tea in the Senior School Hall. In fact on the following day this then became the venue for the social of the Parents Association which, due to the Hall having been closed for a week, had been cancelled from May 23rd. Now, however, to the music of the Melody Makers Band the dance took place from 7.30p.m. until 11.45p.m. On June 11th, at the Bletchley Road Senior School for three hours a day Miss Timpson began as a clerical assistant, and in the afternoon Mr. Aycaster, the Organiser of School Gardens, paid a visit to investigate the growth of the various school crops. Meanwhile, at the Bletchley Road Junior School the headmaster, Mr. W. Crisp, had been asked to explain ‘Puppets in School’ to a wider audience, and in a brief and compact article for the 1944/45 Puppet Year book, (published by the Educational Puppetry Association), he duly recalled the reasons for having introduced puppets as a topic.\n\nThroughout the war Miss Bertha Eden had been the headmistress of the Ecclesbourne Road Infants School, accommodated at the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church. Yet with the war now at an end, on Wednesday, June 13th the people of the Church organised a social evening to bid both herself and the staff farewell. As the senior deacon, Mr. F. Bates J.P., presented Miss Eden with book tokens, (as also Miss Hancock, Miss Davis and Miss Easton), but regarding Miss Gray, she had sent a written apology for her absence. Since the schools at St. Martin’s Hall and the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church had now closed, the pupils of the latter were transferred to the Bletchley Road schools, whilst as for Miss Eden, on leaving Bletchley for London she would go to Rising Hill Street, and then, for the last few months of her career, to Sebborn Street. However, receiving a cheque to which many Bletchley people had contributed, it would be at Hargrave Park School, Islington, that her retirement function would be held in January 1947. Miss Eden had commenced her teaching career in London as an assistant at Queen’s Head school, and after becoming the head of Ambler Road School she was then transferred, in 1932, to the Ecclesbourne Road School. On June 16th from 7.30p.m. to 11.45p.m. the joint dance of the Bletchley Road Junior School and Senior School took place. With the music provided by the Melody Makers, this took place in the Senior School Hall, whilst on Wednesday, June 20th Bletchley Park would be the venue at 2p.m. for the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School annual sports, with Cowper House proving victorious in winning the shield. Schoolgirls from Bletchley were then sportingly distinguished on Friday, June 29th when, under the captaincy of Joan Cutler, on the athletics field at Wolverton they won the championship shield for the Senior Girls’ School, this being in fact the first post war sports meeting to be held under the auspices of the North Bucks Schools Athletic Association. Towards the end of June, Jean Greaves, the only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. A. Greaves, of 172, Western Road, gained the award of a ‘Domestic Science Exhibition’, valued at £60p.a. for two, or possibly three, years. Jean, who had been educated at Bletchley Road Junior School, now hoped to enter the Domestic Science College at Leicester, but for Mrs. Naylor at least for a while academic matters presently assumed a lessened priority, since her husband had recently returned home on leave. Therefore on July 2nd she left her teaching duties for a week, and with her naval husband also being home briefly on leave, about a week later Mrs. Linnell would be granted a similar absence. There was also something to sing about on July 4th when Dr. Russell, the County Musical Director, visited the Bletchley Road Senior School, where he gave a musical recital at 11a.m. Assisting would be Miss Graham on violin, and Miss Mason on flute, but during the day it would be medical skills that were also needed when, having entangled her foot in the rope, a girl whilst skipping with her friends broke her arm, and had to be taken to Bedford hospital. Due to polling for the general election, the Bletchley Road Senior School closed on July 5th, but apart from those hoping for a political career candidates were now also required for the position of Correspondent to the Managers of the Bletchley Road Council Schools. The position paid a salary of £36p.a., and applicants were to contact the secretary, Mr. E. Marchant, at The Elms.\n\nIn July, those evacuees who had returned to London were invited to write essays regarding their time in Bletchley, although some of the comments would hardly prove complimentary! ‘Bletchley is all right for a holiday’, wrote one schoolchild, ‘but when you have to stick it for nearly six years well it gets a bit monotonous.’ However, ‘There are one or two advantages about Bletchley you have got a lot of space to play in and you get plenty of sun.’ A few additional advantages were then praised by a 13 year old; ‘I like its country surroundings, its beautiful woods, villages and its farms where we can see lambs and calves in spring. In London we see none of these beauties which nature alone can build, but things built with men’s hands, which, though beautiful with exquisite carvings and marvellous paintings adorning their walls, cannot be compared with the beauty of nature. I have missed the theatre and the big parks, picture galleries and museums so I have naturally felt rather dull. I am not sorry to leave Bletchley but I am sorry to leave the many friends I have made. Bletchley people have been very good to me.’ As for another reminiscence; ‘In some parts of London there are big tall flats that keep the sun from shining on to the gardens or on to the streets. In Bletchley the sun shines where it pleases.’ Yet of a more negative outlook, ‘There are a lot of grumpy old misers about but there are also kind people as well. My lady I’m living with is very nice to me and I don’t know whether I want to go back or not. You see I want to go back to London to see my family, and I want to stay here with my auntie so you see I am rather mixed up.’ However, for one pupil there was no such indecision; ‘We will be going back soon, thank goodness and three cheers.’ At Bletchley Park, the Bletchley Primary School Sports were held at 2p.m. on Wednesday, July 18th. At an admission price of 6d proceeds were for the School Sports Fund, and the inclusion of St. Paul’s evacuated school, Islington, which had lately joined the Primary from St Martin’s Hall and the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church, proved an additional attraction. Over £20 would be raised by the sale of adult tickets, and this sum was then expended on sports equipment. Held for the first time since the war at Church House, Newport Pagnell, on Saturday there was also cause for celebration when, for schools in North Bucks, at the annual country dancing competition the Bletchley Road Primary School won the Junior Section cup.\n\nFrom the Bletchley Road Senior School, on July 23rd three teachers and 53 children left for an educational week at Little Kimble. The school then closed on July 27th for the summer holidays, to duly reopen, despite the decorators still being at work, on September 10th. Then on Tuesday, September 18th from 7p.m. until 9p.m. the premises provided accommodation for the student enrolment of the Bletchley Evening Institute. This would re-open on Monday, September 24th, with the Education Committee having now announced that amongst the subjects would be included dressmaking Vocal Music, German and country dancing. On the afternoon of September 28th the school housed the Harvest Festival, at which Mr. Davies, secretary of the Royal Bucks Hospital, Aylesbury, gave a short address. On Wednesday, with the arrangements being made by Miss E. M. Workman and her staff the Thanksgivings at the Bletchley Infants and Nursery School proved an enjoyable affair. Mr W. Brown, the former chairman of the managers, presented each child with a New Testament, and in return he received a Bible, as recognition for his devoted service to the school for many years. Unfortunately, the concert had to be cancelled, although during the afternoon a large crowd watched the fancy dress parade in the Leon Recreation Ground. Each child received a prize, and on behalf of the parents Miss Workman was presented by one of the children with a bouquet. For a performance of Henry V, by permission of the Education Authority the Bletchley Road Senior School attended the County Cinema on October 10th, whilst of a less visual means of education, on October 16th Miss Reynolds, of the B.B.C., paid a visit to the school to listen to a B.B.C. lesson. By the middle of the month there had arisen the need for a public hall in Bletchley, since - unless they came within the purview of the Parents’ Association - organisations had now been denied the use of the Senior School Hall. In explaining the decision, which had been taken by the local school managers, Mr. F. Bates said that the caretaker found it impossible to clean the premises in time for the schoolchildren, and with St. Martin’s Hall having been taken over by the County Education Committee, (and therefore only available for educational purposes), Wilton Assembly Hall remained as the only suitable venue for public entertainment.\n\nThroughout the day, on October 18th the V.J. celebrations were held, and, with Mrs. Cutler as the teacher in charge, at the Yeomanry Hall R.S.M. Schofield, of the Intelligence Corps, and S.S.M. Shepheard, of the R.A.S.C., provided the 125 children with a really hilarious time. Supervised by Mrs. Gladwin, at the Old Bletchley school a sumptuous tea then followed. On the morning of October 19th Mr. E. Cook paid a visit to the Food Office. This was regarding the increased ration supplies for the school canteen, whilst on October 22nd Mrs. Edwards was granted leave of absence to meet her son, who had been recently demobilised. During the six months until the end of October, the Old Bletchley Church of England School, of which Mrs. Bailey was the headmistress, had sent 15,000 cigarettes to local men serving abroad in the Forces, and in the same period £173 9s had been collected as National Savings, exclusive of such special events as Wings for Victory. As for recreational matters, in the summer holidays Mrs. Bailey and Mrs. Holdom, ‘a born camper’, had taken a party of pupils to camp for a week at Kimble, near Aylesbury, and apart from visits to many places of interest, 10 mile walks had been daily undertaken. As for other school activities, the harvest festival, conducted by Mr. Staniford and Mr. Payling, had realised eight guineas, and of this Northampton, Aylesbury, and Bedford hospitals each received two guineas, with a further two guineas being donated to the Bletchley Nursing Association.\n\nAssisted by Mrs. Budd, of Bletchley Park, Miss E. Sinfield, a former headmistress of the Old Bletchley Church of England School, was now running the adult section of Bucks County Library, and she could thereby not only make weekly contact with her former pupils, but also learn of their academic progress. Progress was also being made by Bletchley pupils in the typewriting exams of the Union of Educational Institute, for although there would be five failures, the 16 successful scholars enabled Bletchley to gain equal second place with the Aylesbury centre. As for the educational progress of Miss Mary Jones, of Sandringham Place, she had now been awarded £50 p.a. for three years by the Bucks Education Committee, to attend the Royal Academy for Music. At the Old Bletchley Church of England School a caretaker was now required, and at the Bletchley Road Senior School on November 12th Mr. W. Puryer, the arts and crafts teacher, recommenced his teaching career, having been released under Class B from the Forces. Called up in July, 1941 until recently he had been a corporal in R.E.M.E., and although his service would be mostly stationed in England, where he was engaged on radar work, he had also spent a while at Bevenson, near Luneberg, in Germany. Being transferred from the Beds. and Herts. Regiment to R.E.M.E., also engaged on radar work had been his colleague Mr. K. Davies, the history teacher, who, with the rank of sergeant, was ‘demobbed’ on November 14th. In fact this was the date that from the Ship’s Adoption Society Captain Dalziel, the captain of the ship adopted by the Bletchley Road Senior School, would pay a visit to the school, having, accompanied by his wife, received the O.B.E. the previous day from the King. Also achieving renown were a team of children from Bletchley Road Primary School, who, on Saturday, November 24th presented a show at the London Conference of the Educational Puppetry Association. In fact giving prominence to the Conference several national newspapers would make a mention of the School, from which before a critical audience eight children presented a glove puppet show entitled ‘The Princess and the Swineherd.’ This was staged in the ‘College of Preceptors of the Educational Puppetry Association’, and earned a much deserved acclaim for the headmaster of the School, Mr. Crisp.\n\nBy the end of November the release of Elmers School from requisition was imminent, and, with the Bucks County Council Medical Officer having been given permission to use the building as a temporary home, at a meeting of the public health committee, held on a Tuesday, it was decided to recommend that Bletchley Council should purchase the premises. By now, on two nights a week the town’s library was being held at the Bletchley Road Primary School, and a worthy testament to the popularity could be regularly seen with the presence of the long queues. All being volunteers, the unpaid staff included a teacher in the nursery school, Miss Mary Timpson, and Miss Marjorie Wells and Miss A. Milsom, and twice a week from county library boxes they had to unpack and repack 1,600 books, since the present accommodation consisted of a schoolroom. However, Miss Marjorie Beattie, the county librarian, had made enquiries about more suitable accommodation in the town, and when this was secured a paid librarian would then be appointed. At the Bletchley Road Primary School, on Friday, Saturday and Monday, December 7th, 8th and 10th, an exhibition of work was shown in the school hall, and interestingly one visitor would be Louise Morley, of the American Embassy. She was the wife of an English army officer, and would in the company of Mr. D. Cooke, the chief education officer of Bucks, be presented with a leather posy, made by one of the children. On December 14th the Bletchley Road Senior School Carol Festival took place in the Spurgeon Memorial Baptist Church and, admission free, at 3p.m. the Bletchley Co-op Education Committee, Bletchley Women’s Labour Party, held a film show entitled ‘Song of the People.’ This was staged on Tuesday, December 18th and the schools then closed on the following day for the Christmas holidays. In fact this perhaps proved rather opportune for one person who, by accidentally knocking over a bottle of ink, had not only managed to spill the entire contents across an open page of the Senior School register, but thereby to also blot their own copybook!\n\nAccommodated in a local school building, on Monday, January 6th the Bletchley Evening Institute reopened. However, during the war across the nation one fifth of school buildings had been destroyed, and also damaged by enemy action had been Elmers school which - the premises having recently been released from code breaking activities - would now commence the new term, under Mr. Still, on January 21st. As for the Bletchley Road Council Schools, applications were presently invited for an assistant caretaker, who would be paid £144 p.a. plus a current war bonus of £59 19s. By courtesy of the W.E.A., on Tuesday, January 15th adult students could look forward to a class at 8p.m. on ‘The Soviet Union in World Affairs.’ Mr. H. Short being the lecturer, this would be held at the Community Centre, but for the younger generation on Tuesday, January 8th they were back at the Bletchley Road Schools, where 355 pupils would attend the Modern Secondary, 213 the Infants and 362 the Primary. Then on the afternoon of January 15th Mr. Aycaster, the County Organiser for School Gardens, and Mr. Wallis, the County Organiser of Rural Studies, paid a visit to the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary. This was for a conference on the Development of Rural Subjects, and with various teachers in attendance the occasion had been convened by the Chief Education Officer. Following this, on January 25th another conference would then be held at Aylesbury regarding ex members of the Forces, and thus suitably qualified Mr. Puryer, Mr. Davies and Mr. Hinton, who had recently returned from five years service in the R.A.F., left the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary at 11a.m. to attend.\n\nOn January 31st the practice test for entrance to Grammar schools took place, and although an epidemic of colds and flu affected the attendance, on February 1st the Preliminary Test was taken. As for the Bletchley Road Primary School, on Wednesday, February 6th in the school hall 43 of the pupils would give a demonstration of puppet making, to include the mixing of the clay, modelling and baking the puppet heads. With the occasion to be filmed by Pathe Gazette, the building had been transformed into a film set, complete with lights and a camera, and whilst the film would only last for 15 minutes on screen, the cameraman nevertheless stayed for four hours! With Mr. Brann as the producer, (assisted by the educational adviser to Pathe Pictures, Miss Wilson), Pathe Gazette had first developed an interest following a successful demonstration of the craft in London, and, with a shortened version of the footage - Pathe Pictorial No. 77 - being screened in those cities on Sunday, March 2nd, audiences in Manchester and Birmingham would be the first to be shown the completed production. In fact on the day after the original filming, on Thursday, February 7th International Photos Ltd., an American company, had taken more than a hundred stills at the school, and, as a pictorial sequence, these were intended for distribution to magazines and journals in Britain and the U.S. Thus the pupils would once again become the focus of media attention, although Bletchley Park would not become a focus for media attention until 1974, when the achievements of the code breakers were finally revealed. However, on February 13th at least the grounds of Bletchley Park became the centre of attention for the headmaster of the Bletchley Road Senior School, Mr. E.C. Cook, when he paid a visit to the school farm. This was to investigate the progress of the Rural Science activities, and with the produce supplied to the school canteen, the enterprise provided an extension of the work being carried out in the school garden. Indeed, the rural science tuition at the Modern Secondary School was unique in the county, and, with a large tract of land having already been cleared for a poultry run, as well as a sty having been prepared for five young pigs, and the ground made ready for crops, it was therefore not surprising that, on Monday, March 13th, at the North Bucks Divisional Executive a unique application would be made, to supply wellingtons and overalls for the children. Approval was duly awarded, with the application then sent to the Education Committee.\n\nHaving been appointed to the Swansea Education Authority, on February 25th Mr. K. Davies, B.A., tendered his resignation. However, he would continue his duties until April 2nd, and was therefore able to experience not only the weekend Speech Training course for teachers, held on March 8th and 9th, (with lunch and tea provided by the school canteen service), but also a ‘delightful’ lecture on life in France. This concerned both the present time and also that under the Occupation, and the speaker, Hedwise Gillet, of 32 Boulevard Henri IV, Paris, was well qualified to speak upon the subject, for she had been a member of the French Underground Movement. During the summer term it was tentatively proposed to hold a Combined Musical Festival. Thus on the morning of March 14th Mr. E. Cook had relevant discussions with the County Musical Adviser, Mr. Dawes, and in consequence he and the teachers involved attended a conference on March 20th, in order to proceed with the arrangements Then regarding scientific matters, under the care of their teacher, Mr. A. Jones, the pupils of the Science Society, as well as those of the Geographical Society, travelled to London on March 27th. The former group visited the Science and Art Museum, Kensington, and the latter the Imperial Museum, whilst as for the Sports Section, their scheduled visit on April 5th to Gosford Hill Modern Secondary School, Oxford, to play soccer, hockey, and netball, had to be cancelled due to the weather. Yet of a more optimistic outcome, on the afternoon of April 9th in the House finals, held on their home territory, Cowper House proved victorious at hockey, and Penn House at football.\n\nAt the Old Bletchley Church of England School, following Mrs. Bailey’s appointment as headmistress a fund had been launched, in December, 1940, to send cigarettes to those local men serving in the Forces. In fact by the beginning of April 61,600 had been sent by the scholars and friends, with the detailed figures being 1,600 in 1941, 12,000 in 1942, 18,000 in 1943, 15,000 in 1944 and 15,000 in 1945. On returning from the Forces, at the end of April Mr. A. Richards and Mr. W. Rose resumed their teaching positions at the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School, although a couple of weeks later Mr. Rose had to be sent home with tonsillitis. As for Bletchley teachers from the past, on May 7th Joseph Henry Shardlow, who had been the headmaster of the Bletchley Boys school from 1897 to 1920, died at his home at 11, Eveson Road, Norton, near Stourbridge. After retiring he had moved to Clacton but when his bungalow, appropriately named ‘Bletchley’, was destroyed by wartime bombs, he then went to Norton. As the headmaster at Bletchley his successor had been Mr. Melton, and in 1924 he was then succeeded by Mr. E.C. Cook who, exploiting the modern wonders of technology, had recently acquired a new duplicating machine for the use of the School. In fact the decision had been deferred pending inquiries about the condition of the present machine, until it was then discovered that this belonged to the Parents Association! Also regarding the Modern Secondary School, on May 8th plans and estimates were received from the County Architects Department. These concerned the new dining hall and kitchen, whilst as for other matters needing his attention, Mr. Cook attended the Ministry of Education on May 14th to discuss with Mr. Hawkins, of the Inter Relations Department, the various details regarding a proposed educational tour of America. The following evening, attended by teachers from North Bucks, and representatives of industry, a conference at the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School was then convened to discuss science and crafts.\n\nAgricultural matters were the subject on May 20th, when the boys of the Young Farmers Club spent the day at the County Farm, Stoke Mandeville. Also attending lectures, they were shown around the premises, as well as being given a demonstration of the latest types of farming machinery. On the afternoon of May 29th the Modern Secondary School closed to allow the pupils to compete in the North Bucks Sports Day, at which they won the Shield for Secondary Schools, whilst in the evening the school choir travelled to New Theatre, Oxford, for a performance by the D’Oyley Carte Opera Company of the Yeoman of the Guard. Continuing a musical interest, the following day Mr. Dawes, the County Musical Adviser, then brought a party of instrumentalists to the School to give a concert, and this perhaps proved an inspiration for the school choir, who, on Friday, May 31st, participated in the Buckingham Musical Festival. Also on May 31st Bletchley residents had the chance to watch their embryo film stars when, being additionally screened on the following day, Pathe Pictorial No. 77 was shown at the two local cinemas. At the County Cinema, during the afternoon 350 children of the Bletchley Road Primary School had great fun identifying themselves - or their schoolmates - amongst the puppet makers, and puppet making was perhaps also of interest to five young colonial educationalists when, making a tour of schools throughout the country, they paid a visit to the Modern Secondary School. Three of the visitors had ambitions to become education officers in various parts of Africa, with the other two hopefully destined to teach in the West Indies.\n\nOn June 3rd Mr. Clifford Parfit began his duties at the Modern Secondary School, and two days later, excepting Mr. K. Davies, who had now left for Swansea, in the school hall the Bletchley and District N.U.T. gave a welcome home lunch to Messrs. W. Puryer, Richards and Hinton who, as staff members, had now returned from the Forces. Also celebrating were the children of both the Bletchley Modern Secondary School and the Bletchley Road Primary School who, on Victory Day, Friday, June 7th, devoted themselves to ‘merry-making.’ Adding to the fun, the local magician, Bernard Brown, paid a visit to the Primary School in the morning, and in the afternoon the girls gave a display of country dancing on the school lawn, and also joined the boys in sports and games at Leon Recreation Ground. After tea a number of competitions were held in the School, with an ice cream being given to every pupil. As for the Modern Secondary School, following assembly the scholars walked to the playing fields at Bletchley Park, where in the morning sports and games took place. In the afternoon a fancy dress parade and other activities were then held, and having returned to their school for tea, the children retraced their steps to Bletchley Park where, having been borne on a bicycle, a seven foot high effigy of Hitler, prepared by members of the staff, was thrown onto a bonfire. From the Dramatic Art Society, the Historical Society, and the Choral Society, on June 12th 82 children and four teachers from the Modern Secondary School visited Stratford Upon Avon, where in the afternoon at the Memorial Theatre they watched a performance of Cymbeline. However, Mr. Cook, the headmaster, had his mind focussed on more distant horizons, for the following afternoon he travelled to the American Embassy in London, regarding a proposed educational tour to the United States.\n\nOn Wednesday, June 19th Mr. Ralph Morley, M.P., the President of the N.U.T., came to Bletchley to speak to teachers and other educationalists regarding the aim of the new Education Act. This, he explained, would provide ‘a system which gives equality of educational opportunity to all our children’, and he further added that ‘No child should be debarred by reason of the locality in which he lived or because of the financial and social position of his parents ---.’ Nationally, the majority of boys and girls had been educated via the so called elementary schools, and were thereby alleged to have suffered three handicaps; 1/ They left at the age of 14, ‘just when the horizon of their interests was beginning to widen.’ 2/ The classes were large. 3/ They suffered from low self esteem. The 1944 Act would therefore provide pupils with a unified national system in two stages; namely Primary, age 2 to 11, and Secondary, age 11 to 16. The first element would be the nursery school, or nursery classes, attached to infants schools for children aged between 2 and 5, and, although not compulsory, an attendance of 50% was expected, not least because all the children would receive proper medical attention, regular rest periods, sleep and recreation, furniture of a suitable size and educational toys. The next stage would comprise the Infants School for children aged from 5 to 7, and then from 7 to 11 the Primary, or Junior School; ‘a place to learn to read and write and to handle the tools of knowledge.’ At the age of 11 all children would then receive a Secondary education, and it was planned to raise the leaving age to 15 in April, 1947, and then, as soon as practical, to 16. Three types of Secondary School were planned; Secondary Grammar, with a bias towards academics and literature, Technical Schools, and Modern Secondary schools. During 44 weeks of the year it was then intended that young people from the age of 16 to 18 should receive part time education, by attending county colleges for two half days, or one day, a week and this would be in the employer’s time, and at his expense. However, despite all these grandiose plans, due to a lack of men, money and material, little had so far been achieved to implement the Act.\n\nOn July 3rd the Geographical Society of the Modern Secondary School enjoyed an outing to Oxford. In the afternoon they visited All Souls College and the Ashmoleum Museum, and on the following day the school choir, under the charge of Mrs. Holt and Mrs. Linnell, ventured to the King’s Theatre, Hammersmith, where they watched a performance of The Mikado by the D’Oyley Carte Opera Company. Then on the evening of July 8th the feeding at weekends, and other holiday times, of the school’s animals at Bletchley Park, (accommodated on a site now occupied by the fire station), was discussed at the North Bucks Education Division Executive Committee. In a letter, the headmaster of the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School, Mr. Cook, said that in connection with the rural studies of the school they had tried to employ a rota, but this had been unreliable, since many of the boys who lived in the villages were unable to travel at the times required. He therefore felt that it would be much better to ask the groundsman, Mr. W. Souster, to perform the tasks, for which, as had been the arrangement before the war, a special payment would be made, and at the chairman’s suggestion this was agreed in principle, with the details to be left to a committee. In the Bletchley and District Schools Musical Festival and Concert, held at 7.15p.m. on Wednesday, July 10th, those taking part were the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School, the Bletchley Road Primary School, Bow Brickhill Primary, Drayton Parslow Primary, Little Brickhill Primary, Old Bletchley Church of England, Stewkley Primary, Wavendon Endowed Primary, and Woughton and Simpson Primary. At the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School the large hall was used to accommodate the event, but as for the Old Bletchley Church of England School, problems of accommodation were now proving a concern for Mr. N. Hames, the Divisional Education Officer. Currently there were around 132 pupils on the roll, and - as was mentioned by Mr. Hames - during the early days of the war the pressure on school places at Old Bletchley had been so great that, in order to ease the situation, use had to be made of the Yeomanry Hall. However, it now appeared that the T.A. Association needed the building, and in consequence the chief education officer had asked the executive committee to consider the question of alternative premises. Yet at least for a while there would be a temporary respite, since on July 12th the summer holidays began. In fact not until August 26th would the pupils return, although for those at the Modern Secondary School, where Miss Thompson would now begin her duties, they were to find a complete reorganisation since, under the new educational system, two sections had been created, Academic and Practical, with seven forms in each.\n\nBeing the first educational outing of the new term, on September 4th the Dramatic Groups visited the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford Upon Avon, where they watched a performance of The Tempest. As for outdoor activities, on September 9th a party of children left Bletchley to spend a week of organised entertainments at Little Kimble Camp where, on September 11th, they were visited by the headmaster, Mr. E. Cook. Finding everything in order he reported that the pupils were having ‘a very happy and useful time together’, as hopefully were the pupils of the Natural History Society who, on the afternoon of the same day, enjoyed a trip to Bow Brickhill woods. Enrolment for the Bletchley Evening Institute had taken place from 7p.m. to 9p.m. on Tuesday, September 24th, and on Monday, September 30th the Institute duly reopened at 7.30p.m. However, by holding lessons at ‘moderate terms’ Mrs. M. Warne, F.C.T.S., could offer alternative tuition in shorthand and typing at 5, The Grove. At the Community Centre, on Thursdays from the end of September the W.E.A. Bletchley branch would conduct a ‘University Tutorial Class’ on ‘Great Britain in the Post-War World.’ The first meeting was to be held on September 26th at 7.30p.m., and interested persons were invited to contact the branch secretary at 59, Eaton Avenue. However, for those persons of a more artistic persuasion, they might be interested in the Art Class at the Community Centre which, to include drawing in pen, pencil, charcoal etc. and water and oil colours, would reopen on Thursday evenings at 7.30p.m. Persons wishing to enrol were asked to contact Miss N. Wells, at 68, Napier Street. Together with their parents, children of the Bletchley Modern Secondary School enjoyed a trip to Southend on Thursday, September 24th, but for the parents of those children from Stewkley and Dunton matters were proving less amicable, for one Tuesday they went ‘on strike’. Regarding the school bus service, this was due to the excessive delay in collecting those children aged 11 and over after school hours, but on the following Friday the parents were informed that they had won their case, and as from Monday the children would be collected at 8.35a.m., and then again on leaving school. Otherwise the children would have been left for 1 hour and 20 minutes every day, waiting both for school to begin, and then to be collected.\n\nFor a position paying a weekly wage of £1 1s, applications for a part time cleaner, for an average of 12 hours a day, were to be sent to Miss F. Davis, ‘Correspondent 5 Victoria Road.’ The employment would be at the Bletchley Road Nursery School, whilst at the Bletchley Road Primary School and Modern Secondary School their 9th annual Harvest Home was held at 3p.m. on Friday, October 14th. The beneficiary would be the Royal Bucks Hospital, Aylesbury. On October 24th a concert was then performed at the Modern Secondary School by a party of ‘instrumentalists.’ This had been arranged by Mr. Dawes and Miss Bryer, the County Music Advisers, and also now arranged had been the choice of candidate to fill the position of Assistant Organiser of Rural Subjects, (for the Bucks Educational Authority), for, following his successful interview on September 26th, Mr. Hinton was to be appointed from October 31st.\n\nOn the morning of November 27th the annual Carol Festival for schools in North Bucks was held, accommodated in the large hall of the Modern Secondary School, where on Tuesday December 3rd, Thursday December 5th, and Friday December 6th an enthusiastic audience attended a Christmas concert. Apart from plays, the features would include acrobatics as well as Scandinavian dancing and - as an ‘outstanding item’ - the School Corps de Ballet. In fact having been trained by Mrs. M. Naylor and Mrs. M. Jones ‘the girls were worthy of a place in a professional pantomime.’ Also worthy of professional praise was Deirdre Barker, ‘a coming young actress’, for she had given an excellent portrayal of the Queen Mother. As for Norma Lewtas, she put over an entertaining ‘Albert’ monologue in her native Lancashire accent, which seemed quite appropriate since one of the participants in the production was a Grace Field! For Mrs. F. Cutts, S.M., A.V.C.M., L.V.C.M., of Lyndhurst, Cambridge Street, a seasonal satisfaction was provided by the musical success achieved by many of her pupils, and also proving a success was an exhibition of work at the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School. This was held on Friday, December 12th and Saturday, December 13th and with the major feature being a display of cookery, which was a subject taught to both boys and girls, as an interesting statistic during the previous year the school canteen had served 58,937 dinners.\n\nFor the benefit of those children living in the surrounding villages, it was now agreed to operate five buses to the Bletchley schools, and as a further benefit four modern oil heaters, at six guineas each, were to be installed in St. Martin’s Hall, for the primary school section presently accommodated at the premises. As the manager of the Bletchley Road Primary School, Mrs. W.J. Brown had now been nominated to replace Mrs. E. Staniford, who had resigned, whilst on Thursday January 30th at the Bletchley Nursery School a presentation was made, by the parents and staff, to Miss Mary Timpson, who, having been in charge for the past two years - and having been on the staff for the previous three years - had been appointed as a nursery school superintendent at Clevedon, Somerset. No doubt she would retain many fond memories of the town, as also perhaps had Sydney Howard Still, the former principal of Elmers school. Following the requisition of Elmers, during the war Mr. Still and his wife had resided at Highfield, Manor Road, and although with the end of the hostilities the school was again destined for an educational use, about five weeks ago Mr. and Mrs. Still had chosen to move to Dorchester, and the home of a married daughter at Silverdale, Edward Road. There, leaving a widow and two daughters, Mr. Still died aged 73 on February 20th, and of his estate of £3,358 18s 6d probate was granted to his widow, and also Ernest Thornley, of Hove.\n\nUnder the Education Act of 1944, on Thursday, February 28th the Education Development Plan, to be submitted by March to the Minister of Education, was adopted by the County Council, and seemingly not before time, since the following day in the wake of a school inspection, carried out by Mr. F. Bates, the children of the Bletchley Road Infants and Primary Schools had to be sent home, when it was discovered that the lavatories were frozen. The programme estimated a capital expenditure of £9,508 22s 5d from 1947 to 1965, and amongst the local details was included the ‘probability’ that the child population of Bletchley would be affected by the building of 250 new houses in 1947, and 300 in 1948. As for the proposed alterations to the Bletchley County Primary School, the costs from 1959 to 1962 were estimated at £600 for the site and £10,500 for the buildings, with the alterations to Bletchley Junior School for 1950 to 1953 envisaged as £500 for the site, and £6,000 for the buildings. For Bletchley Modern Secondary School the costings for 1956 to 1959 were set at £50,000 for building, whilst for the proposed new schools for the town the schedule anticipated the construction of the Primary, 1950 - 1953, Grammar, 1953 - 1956, Modern Secondary, 1953 - 1956, Secondary Technical 1956 - 1959, and Nursery school, 1959 - 1962.\n\nYet all this was for the future, and more immediate concerns were considered at a Monday meeting in late February of the North Bucks Educational Executive, when an application for a grant towards the purchase of a grand piano was submitted from Bletchley Modern Secondary School. Following discussions regarding the relative merits of a grand piano or an upright instrument, a recommendation was then made to grant an award of not more than £75. As for another key event, this occurred when Miss Workman, who since 1927 had been the headmistress of the Bletchley Road Infants School, resigned, prior to her impending marriage. In fact when she was first appointed the Infants School had been accommodated in the building of the present Primary Dept., and it would not be until 1938 that the move into premises which had previously been the senior girls building was made, with the nursery class - the first in Buckinghamshire - commenced in 1939. Due recognition of Miss Workman’s past service was made on Wednesday, March 26th, when, at a gathering of managers, teachers and children of the Bletchley Primary, Nursery and Infants Schools, Mr. F. Bates, the chairman of the managers, presented her with a cheque. Also receiving money was the Bletchley Modern Secondary School which, in early March, had been granted £100 by the Educational Executive Committee towards the cost of a Rural Studies Scheme. Should any profits be made then half would be applied to the committee, and half to the Rural Studies account of the school, but a financial statement of the Scheme showed that a loan had already been made to the school sports account of £150, of which £57 had been spent on equipment. As for other expenditure, stock and feed stuffs totalled £107, although £89 had been received from the sale of chickens and pigs. New teaching arrivals at Bletchley now included Miss G. Kinvig, Miss E. Brooks, (nursery class), Mr. J. Halsey, (Bletchley Primary), Miss S. Taylor, (Old Bletchley), and Mrs. L. White, (Bletchley Infants), and perhaps - since at 38, Bletchley Road a local teacher was urgently advertising for a daily help - the occupation was proving a little stressful. However, therapeutic swimming might soon be available, for, having purchased The Grange, Norman Green was now offering the local schools the morning use of the associated swimming pool! On April 1st the school leaving age was raised to 15, and on Wednesday, May 14th the Bletchley and District Schools Music Association Festival Concert took place. Admission was 2s 6d, and items included the massed singing of the choirs under the direction of James Dawes, who was the county schools musical organiser. The event took place at the Bletchley Road Modern Secondary School, where for some ten years the scholars had been corresponding with officers and men of the Merchant Navy. In fact, accompanied by his wife and young daughter, on Thursday, May 15th one of the seaborne correspondents then came to visit the school, to give a talk on his maritime experience during the war. He was Captain David Pederson who, now being the captain of the S.S. Moses Gay, a vessel presently bringing pit props to the country, had formerly been first officer on the S.S. Chelwood which, under the British Ship Adoption Society, had been adopted during the war by the pupils, as also had the S.S. Goodwood.\n\nA vacancy had now arisen at the Bletchley schools for a clerical assistant. Plus a cost of living bonus, the position would pay from £100 to £300p.a. for a male, and between £100 and £240 for a female, and applicants would need shorthand and typing skills. They would also need rather more commitment than that shown by the several parents who, on Tuesday, June 10th, failed to attend the A.G.M. of the Bletchley Schools Parents Association. This was held at 7.45p.m. in the Modern Secondary School Hall, although less disappointing was the comment by the headmaster, Mr. E.C. Cook, that because the pupils enjoyed their schooling so much, punishment at the premises was nil. In fact it was more of a job to ‘kick them out an hour or more after normal hours.’ At the A.G.M. a report was also given by the headmaster of the Primary School, and with the winding up announced of the Bletchley Schools Sports Association the credit balance, of £129, would be divided equally between the sports funds of the Modern Secondary and the Primary School. As regarding other matters, much interest had been attracted by the Wednesday club groups, when during the afternoons the normal grouping of the school into ages and classes was suspended, and, irrespective of age, groups of children studied subjects of their own choosing. Agriculture was also a school speciality, and on Wednesday, June 18th at 7.30p.m. the Bletchley Modern Secondary Agricultural Society presented a Grand Concert in the school hall, featuring amongst the artists Mrs. Z. Bailey as soprano, and Bernard Brown as conjuror.\n\nAs the successor to Miss E. Workman, Miss Winifred Perrin, aged 35, had now been appointed as the headmistress of the Bletchley Road Infants School, having previously been the headmistress of Gosport Infants School. Educated at Dewsbury Grammar School, she attended Hull Municipal Training College from 1929 until 1931, and this would be the year in which she passed the Teaching Certificate. Until 1940 she then taught at Dewsbury Junior and Infants School and, after an appointment as the headmistress at Morley Infants School, she then moved to Gosport. In July, work was ongoing at the rear of the Modern Secondary School to construct not only a new canteen and dining room, but also three additional classrooms and two craft rooms. This new accommodation would house the activities of the domestic science, woodwork and metalwork departments, etc., whilst as for the musical aspirations of the School, during the month twenty girls took part in a concert at the Temple of Music, at Tyringham House. Conducted by Mr. Moss, their items included Handel and Schubert, but matters were less harmonious for John Finn, for after a term teaching at Bletchley Modern Secondary School he was now returning to Portsmouth, having been unable to acquire a house in Bletchley. Also leaving, after more than 30 years of teaching in Bletchley, was Mrs. Mabel Edwards of Water Eaton Road, who retired on Friday, July 25th. Her father, Mr. W. Wilkins, had been the headmaster of a Wesleyan school at Sturminster Newton, in Devon, and at the age of 13 Mabel continued this educational tradition by training for the teaching profession. After passing her final exams she then moved to St. Albans, and came to Bletchley in 1909 on marrying Jesse Edwards, a builder. At the request of the authorities, being employed at the Bletchley Road schools she then returned to teaching during World War One, but three years after the death of her husband she left in 1922 for the Old Bletchley Church of England School where, until seconded back to the Bletchley Secondary Modern School, she would teach for the next 20 years. Music and arts and crafts were her chief interests, and she was also the organist and choirmistress at the former Albert Street Methodist Church.\n\nBy the beginning of September, on social, economic and other subjects correspondence courses of the Co-operative Union Ltd. were available to Co-op members and their families, with grants being available towards the cost from the Bletchley and District Co-op Society Education Committee. Interested applicants were to contact the secretary at 62, Eaton Avenue, and also on the subject of self education, having by permission of the County Medical Authority been transferred to the Clinic, the ‘County Library Bletchley Centre’ - with A. Milsom as the Honorary Librarian - would be open from September 16th on Tuesdays from 6p.m. to 8p.m., and from September 24th on Wednesdays from 2.30p.m. to 4.30p.m. In fact the facility would no doubt be greatly used by students of the Bletchley Evening Institute which, following an enrolment night held at 7p.m. on Tuesday, September 30th, reopened on Monday, October 6th at 7p.m., to include commercial, technical, and domestic subjects and classes for youth clubs.\n\nAt the Bletchley Church of England School, Mr. Morgans had now left for National Service, and his place would be taken by Douglas Pinckard, a former officer of the R.A.F. Just before Easter Mrs. H. Cutler had also left, and not only did she depart with the good wishes of the pupils and teachers, but also the £3 3s that, in recognition of her teaching work at the Yeomanry Hall, (the use of which had now been withdrawn), they had collected for her. As caretakers, also deserving of recognition was the twenty years of service given by Mr. and Mrs. T. Gladwin, who for their dedication would be presented with a wireless set by the managers. However, there was sad news for the headmistress, Mrs. Bailey, for on Friday, October 31st her mother, Sarah Denton-Ayres, of Chase Farm, Ramsey St. Mary’s, Hunts., had died at the age of 76. At the Bletchley Road schools Miss J.M. Smith was now appointed as a clerical assistant, whilst regarding other employments at £1 2s per five day week women cleaners were needed at the Modern Secondary School. This was for both the mornings and the afternoons, and they hopefully did a good job on Wednesday, November 19th, when the annual visit to the Bletchley and District Association was made by the N.U.T. president, J. Lawton, BSc. At 7.30p.m. the proceedings culminated in a public meeting in the school hall on ‘Problems arising from the Education Act, 1944’, and here perhaps the latest type of sound film projector was usefully employed, having been recently purchased from their own funds by the Modern Secondary School. On the occasion of the Royal Wedding, on Thursday, November 20th the schoolchildren enjoyed a days holiday. The flag was flown at the Council Offices, and as another cause for celebration at the annual house festival the new ‘Mrs Edwards trophy’ - for the best house at Bletchley Modern Secondary School - was won by Hampden House, with 19 points. During mid December pupils of the Bletchley County Primary School held their 7th annual exhibition of work, with the visitors being guided around by the enthusiastic pupils. On appropriate display were several portrayals of the Royal Wedding, although not on display for much longer would be Mr. G. Baker, the teacher in charge of rural studies at the Modern Secondary School. At the end of the term he was to leave for a teaching appointment at a school at Poole, and there his wife would also be employed. Becoming the leader of the local branch of the Young Farmers Association, he had arrived in Bletchley a year ago, having previously been on the teaching staff at Buckingham.\n\nAt the beginning of the year Captain Hubert Faulkner, well known for his local construction business, announced in a personal notice that he had returned home from hospital, and he thanked everyone ‘for their most kind enquiries and messages.’ The reason for his medical treatment had been that whilst recently riding with Mr Barbour and Mr Richardson, to a meeting of the Whaddon Chase, at Whaddon Hall, he had received a kick on the knee from Mr Richardson’s horse, and at Luton hospital his smashed kneecap was duly removed. Then on the morning of the first Sunday of the year another local casualty would be Miss Gertrude Pacey, the Aylesbury Street confectioner, who, having slipped whilst turning into Aylesbury Street from Denmark Street, had dislocated her thigh. Her injury was tended at Northampton hospital. Needing ‘no previous experience’ a cook was now required at the Garden Café and Restaurant, but elsewhere in the town other matters were cooking when, one Tuesday evening, an overheating stove set fire to the roof of Maclaren’s garage, in the High Street. Fortunately only minor damage was caused, and an N.F.S. pump quickly dealt with the incident. A member of the N.F.S. then had another incident to deal with towards the end of January, although this would not be related to his employment. He was Jacob Leigh, of 28, Napier Street, who, due to the noise of two sewing machines, and the smell of leather, claimed, in court proceedings, possession of the rooms in his property which were presently occupied by Max Freeman, a manufacturer of handbags. Mr. Leigh said that he needed the accommodation for his family, and Mr. Freeman, according to the rent book, was obliged to use the premises only residentially. The house contained four bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen and a scullery, and for the use of a living room, bedroom and a second bedroom, in which he had set up a workshop, Mr. Freeman paid 14s a week. For trade purposes, in one room he stored leather, but he had also installed two sewing machines, and it was due to the ensuing nuisance and noise that Mr. Leigh had made his complaint. Compounding matters was the fact that people treated the facility much like a shop, and in fact with customers calling every day the inconvenience had been only partially remedied by the installation of a bell, with Mr. Freeman’s nameplate. Apart from himself, his wife, his father in law and mother in law, Mr. Leigh’s family also included two boys, aged 9 and 11, and it was by an ongoing arrangement that one of the boys now slept in the ‘workshop’. In fact the origins of this ‘facility’ dated from the time that Mr. Freeman had been a tenant of Mrs. Minnie Smith, of 34, Brooklands Road, for it had been with her permission that he set up his equipment. Therefore the judge deliberated in favour of the defendant who, perhaps via Mr. Turner’s newsagents at 55, Bletchley Road, which was now a branch office for The North Bucks Times, lost no time in advertising ‘Send your Handbags, all Leather Goods for repair, to Freeman, 28 Napier Street, Bletchley. New ones are expensive.’ Perhaps he also took the opportunity to upgrade his equipment, for in May he would sell off a Singer treadle sewing machine, ‘in good condition’, for £5; ‘View between 11a.m. and 5p.m. except Wednesdays.’\n\nTowards the end of February Mrs. Eliza Essen, of 19, Duncombe Street, died one Tuesday aged 79. She had come to Bletchley in 1902, when her husband, previously an employee of the railway at Willesden, opened in business as a coal merchant, and for a while she would carry on a business at the Corner Shop. However, she eventually relinquished this trade to help her husband in the coal business, and would continue in this occupation after his death in 1930. Presently there was little demand for bricks, and in consequence in early February the London Brick Company decided to temporarily close its works at Newton Longville. Nevertheless, for the accommodation of new machinery, being sent from London, in March plans were approved for the construction of a factory on the Watling Street for Messrs. Pacey & Co., although during early August disaster would threaten when, one Friday at 9.45p.m., the N.F.S. were called to a blaze at the factory. A heap of metal shavings and other rubbish had caught fire, but by midnight the blaze had been brought under control. In early April the Flettons brickworks required a temporary canteen attendant for not less than one month - ‘No special knowledge necessary’ - and perhaps this was cause for a cautious optimism in the industry. However, for obvious reasons in 1940 there had been no such expectancy for the civilian motor trade, and due to the lack of custom Walter Wright, for £145, had sold his garage business, in Bletchley Road, to Mr. Field, with an agreement that Mr. Wright could stay in the house for three months, whilst looking for alternative accommodation. Living rent and rates free, he would meanwhile be employed as a mechanic by Mr. Field at £3 a week, and although this situation expired on April 10th, 1940, nothing was said. Thus with three subsequent wage rises the arrangement continued, but now Mr. Field, who was presently resident at 119, Buckingham Road, had dispensed with the services of Mr. Wright, who was instead working as a toy maker and ‘doing pretty well.’ Therefore at Bletchley County Court on Monday, April 23rd Mr. Field claimed possession of 85, Bletchley Road, and the judge duly ordered possession in three weeks. A similar judgement was then awarded to James Fieldman Ramsbotham, of ‘Brooklands’, Bletchley, when, at Bletchley County Court, he claimed possession of 44, Windsor Street from George Selby, who had left his employment the previous October. The house was now required for the foreman appointed to look after the nurseries, but with Mr. Selby having become increasingly infirm the judge, in view of this situation, gave him a month to leave, instead of the usual three weeks.\n\nAged 68, on Saturday, April 28th William Fowler died at 8, Church Street. A native of Peckham, about 17 years ago he had come to Bletchley from Whittlebury, Northamptonshire, and after an eight years employment as foreman at the gasworks, for the next eight years he then worked as a water fitter for the Council. At the beginning of May a saleslady was needed at Hill’s shoe shop, in Bletchley Road. The position offered ‘good wages and prospects’, although possibly not good enough to convince Mr. Hill’s son, John, for, with his marriage impending, he had opted for a job at Bletchley post office! A strong, intelligent lad was now required at Hurst’s engineering works. This was situated in Denmark Street, and here also was the premises of Charles Dunbar, a blacksmith. At the entrance, small boys would often gather on their way home from school to watch the noisy activities, which one day then also attracted the attention of Charles Head who, with ‘demob kit in one hand and my demob papers in the other’, had decided to look around the town after missing his train connection. Having been in the Cavalry, following a ‘short stint’ with tanks he then became a mechanic in the Engineers, and he was now returning home to Newmarket from a demobilisation centre. At Bletchley station he dumped his ‘stuff’ in the waiting room, and during his subsequent perambulations called into the Bull and Butcher where, in conversation with the landlord, he learned that a blacksmith’s business was for sale ‘down the road.’ As Charles would later recall, ‘When I got to Denmark Street I saw a blacksmith’s workshop with plenty of banging and swearing going on inside’, and suitably impressed within half an hour he had bought the business! Thus from this chance encounter he would establish a successful business, which some ten years later he then transferred to Tavistock Street. Becoming a well known personality in the town, Charles played an active role on the local council, and in April 1960 he was made a Freeman of the City of London.\n\nWith more equipment now available, in May the Bletchley and District Co-op ladies hairdressing department required additional staff, whilst at the Bakery (Confectionery), in Park Street, girls aged 14 to 15 were needed. At the other end of the town, at the end of the month at 79, Victoria Road Mr. Johns now took over from Mr. E.C. Weatherhead, in a business that had been established for nine years, but for the more established business of the Co-op, at the end of June boys and girls aged 14 to 17 were required for butchery rounds. As for another of their departments this could now ‘supply your immediate needs in Utility Bedsteads’, but of somewhat different needs on Wednesday, July 11th, by order of Messrs. Richardson, Timmins and Co. Ltd. the surplus requirements of Henry Butcher and Co., at 126, Buckingham Road, were to be auctioned in lots at the Conservative Club. However, the equipment, which included well drilling and contractors plant, would be of little interest to Mr. K.H. Axford who, from July 30th, took over the business of newsagent, stationer and fancy goods at 61, Aylesbury Street. This had been previously run by George Austin and his wife, but, having acknowledged the patronage of their customers over the last 16 years, they had now decided to retire to Colchester for, as George had said, ‘Too active a life after 50 does tell. I had to do paper rounds myself because of the lack of newspaper boys.’ Mr. Austin had originally come from Dorking, whilst as for Mr. Axford, having been a representative for the well known firm of Spicers Ltd. he had 20 years of experience in the newsagents trade. A native of Devon, he had lately seen service in the N.F.S., and during the blitz of that city had occupied the role of Section Leader and Mobilising Officer at Exeter. Now settled at Bletchley he would start a new life, but unfortunately a tragedy would befall the family later in the year, when, during a visit by his parents from Bristol, towards the end of December his father died. On happier matters, one Sunday afternoon in late July at St. Martin’s Church the vicar, the Reverend Wheeler, solemnised the marriage of Miss Carina Tramontini, the younger daughter of Mr. & Mrs. Oswald Tramontini, of the Garden Café, (which adjoined the Studio), and Corporal Don Fullerton, of the R.A.F. With the reception being appropriately held at the Garden Café, the couple then left for a honeymoon in London. With good wages and prospects a ‘sharp lad’ was now required for warehouse and other duties at the British Gaslight Co. Ltd, 83, Bletchley Road, and elsewhere by the beginning of September Blackmore Patterns had a few vacancies for female part-time workers and juniors. However, it was the end of a career for Henry Keyte, who died aged 78. He had retired from his trade as a blacksmith five years ago, having begun his working life at the age of 11 in Leighton Buzzard. Upon his marriage in 1888 he then moved to Old Bletchley, where he worked for Mr. Meager.\n\nA shorthand typist was now required by J. Root & Son, Tavistock Street, and to sport a healthy glow at the interview perhaps potential candidates might wish to invest in the Hanovia sun lamp, ‘used for three hours’, which was currently for sale for £15 at Cowley & Wilson, The Garage. After a legal battle, on Tuesday, September 25th at Bletchley County Court a Bletchley hairdresser, Miss Margaret Dorothy Taylor, of 47, Bletchley Road, obtained possession of her shop and premises, situated at 53, Wolverton Road, Stony Stratford, from Benjamin Dancer. Retaining an upper room, which she used as a ladies hairdressing saloon, at 10s per week she had initially let part of the premises to the defendant for the men’s saloon, but then subsequently let the whole of the accommodation for 25s 6d, which included light and rates. However, with it being alleged that the tenants were noisy and troublesome, she resorted to legal action, and in evidence it was said that although Dancer had left the house on May 20th, the following week another family moved in. Nevertheless, Dancer was said to have been responsible in 1943 for a number of anti social incidents, and his defence was hardly helped by the revelation that during that year a petition had been brought against him by the residents of Wolverton Road. This he then countered with an action for conspiracy, although this was not upheld. At 73, Bletchley Road, Weatherheads had now received a small supply of post war radio receivers and domestic appliances, and they could also offer a small number of bowl fires at 26s 3d, including Purchase Tax. Additionally, one or two of the first post war Murphy radios were also available - ‘Your early enquiry is solicited’ - but somewhat more unusual were the items now available further along the road at the showroom of the British Gaslight Co. Ltd. Here, in aid of the R.A.F. Benevolent Fund ‘Mr. Therm’ invited customers to buy a Victory Bell - ‘Very suitable for Christmas gifts’ - which, priced at £1 each, had been cast from the metal of German aircraft shot down over Britain.\n\nAt the end of September, on his 36th wedding anniversary Mr. A. E. Staniford of ‘Athelstan’, Staple Hall Road, retired from the firm of Rowlands. On leaving school he had joined the timber firm in 1891, but left after a few weeks to work on the railway. Three months later he was then persuaded to return, and with only one break through illness, and two years service during World War One, he thereon remained with the firm for 54 years. In the early days the office had been the small building currently occupied by the blacksmith’s shop, but alternative accommodation was then provided in more spacious premises across the road. Mr. Staniford and his wife were now to enjoy a well deserved week in Blackpool, whilst at Rowlands the need was not surprisingly soon advertised for an office boy. In early October Mrs. Lizzie Gamble of 40, Albert Street, died at the age of 86, her husband having died the year before. A native of Leicester, she came to Bletchley at the time of her marriage 48 years ago, and, being destined to serve for 12 years, she was elected onto the management committee of the Co-op in 1923. A one time secretary, and more recently President, she was also a member of the Co-op Women’s Guild. At James Root and Son a shorthand typist was still required, as well as girls to learn how to make paintbrushes; ‘Full wages paid whilst being taught.’ Otherwise there was an opportunity at Blackmore Patterns for a young girl with an interest in dressmaking, cutting, etc. - ‘a little knowledge an advantage’ - whilst for male employment, for a lorry delivery round the Bletchley Co-op needed a coal carter who, after a hard day’s toil, might care to visit the Co-op Hardware Department, since it presently offered to ‘Solve your washday troubles and supplement your soap ration by using KLORYDE, the Sunshine Bleaching Fluid’. ‘Makes the dirt dance out of your clothes.’ It was now announced that Mr. W. Billingham, the general manager of the Bletchley Co-op for 22 years, would retire early in the New Year. Having been appointed as secretary of the Society in 1918, he came from Northampton, where he had been an auditor for the C.W.S., and five years later he became the general manager. Yet in an additional occupation, since its inception early in the war he had been the District House Coal Officer on the L.M.S. railway system, with responsibility for an area that encompassed 16 depots.\n\nMr. A. Souster, it was reported, would be unable to complete his usual round with Christmas cards, but especially for the younger generation November 5th was perhaps more prominent in their thoughts, although due to a shortage of supplies fireworks were being strictly rationed by shopkeepers. However, the town would not be lacking a fiery spectacle for, on the night of Friday, November 9th, a blaze started in the shop premises of the Bletchley Fish Company, near the station. Spreading to overhead electric light cables, and consequently blacking out most of the town, the fire began as the manageress, Mrs. A. Ivory, of 24, Brooklands Road, had been dealing with the diminishing rush for fish and chips, having, assisted by Mrs D. Garner, of Western Road, been busy since mid-afternoon. In fact it was at about 6p.m. that the ladies first noticed smoke in the shop, and on opening the back door Mrs. Ivory was confronted by sheets of flame, which, issuing from the back of the fryer, quickly engulfed the whole of the premises. Having seen the glow whilst passing by, Mr. C. Flack urgently telephoned the fire brigade from the Co-op butchers shop, and meanwhile after ushering the customers out of the shop the ladies managed to rescue the cash register, scales, and several other items. Using a special foam, the fire brigade soon brought the blaze under control, and were thereby able to save the front structure of the shop, although not the adjoining cold fish store. With the power cut off for much of the town, at the Studio complimentary tickets were given to the audience as compensation, and the cinema then remained closed until some time after 8p.m., when the supply was restored. Not surprisingly, as the owners of the fish shop Messrs O. Tramontini and Mr. N. Green were soon advertising for estimates for rebuilding and redecorating, and in fact the café and ‘chippie’ would survive until the early 1970’s, when the premises succumbed to the development of the Brunel Centre. However, the business was subsequently re-accommodated in Weatherburn Court. Between April, 1940 and December, 1945 £1,891 had been raised in the Co-op Comforts for the Forces Fund, and by the end of November it was also a comfort to know that, having secured a quantity from the C.W.S. cabinet factory, the Bletchley & District Co-op Furniture Department were presently able to exhibit Utility bedroom furniture; ‘We can supply your immediate demands from this stock on surrender of units.’ Yet at ‘The Bazaar’, in Bletchley Road, Mr. & Mrs. Frank Bollen were now putting their business to bed, for they were making plans to retire to a bungalow at Cold Hill, one of the beauty spots surrounding Bournemouth. When they first came to Bletchley there had been hardly a dozen houses between Bletchley and Fenny Stratford, but much new development would take place during their 25 years in business. Since their son was a Flying Officer in the R.A.F., and their daughter was presently serving in the W.A.A.F., the business would consequently now leave the family ownership, to be taken over from December 1st by Mr. E. Neal, of Wembley.\n\nAs well as two clerks, Beacon Brushes now had 50 vacancies for learners, machinists, etc., and at Old Bletchley G. Chandler required a boy or girl, aged 16 to18, as a grocery assistant. As for Mr. H. Sweetland, of 74, Duncombe Street, having previously been the district manager for United Dairies he was seeking a position in Bletchley, or the local district, since, after 3½ years of employment as chief cashier, he had been recently released from the Bletchley office of the Northampton Electric Light Co., due to the return of staff from the Forces. At a Thursday meeting in late November, Bucks County Council decided by 38 votes to 24 to reinstate all those employees who had been registered as conscientious objectors. However, they would only be employed for as long as ‘rendered obligatory by statute’, after which they might perhaps be interested in the various vacancies at Roots and Beacon Brushes. More interested in poaching staff from these firms was the managing director of Cooper, Turner and Co. Brush Manufacturers, the head office of which was situated at 6, Broad Street Place, London, E.C.2. Despite the factory works being located at Barking, he now locally advertised for a works manager, and could offer ‘A real and progressive opportunity to live man.’ One Thursday in early December Mr. Edward Cecil Weatherhead, ‘the grocer’, died at the age of 39. The eldest son of the well-known Bletchley family, he began his working life in the Co-op bakery but then left to join the L.M.S. railway, where he stayed for seven years. After running a poultry farm in Stoke Road for 12 months, he then bought a grocery store in Victoria Road, but 10 years later in 1940 he took over his mother’s shop in Bletchley Road. Married in 1928, he left a widow and two young boys, David and Terry. Another sad death would be that of Walter Terence Harrison, aged 59, who one Wednesday morning in late December suddenly died at his home, ‘Bowden’, in Denbigh Road. After employment at Market Harborough he came to Bletchley as the manager of the Bletchley branch of Lloyds Bank, and would duly occupy this position for 14 years. Apart from his usual employment, often playing in local concerts he was well known in the district as a banjo player, and his son, John, was now studying at the Royal Academy in London.\n\nHaving recently returned from Japanese captivity, Carl Moser had now resumed his journalistic profession, being, with responsibility for the editorial control, appointed a director of the Bletchley Gazette. Also making the news was the Bletchley Fish Co. which, at 18, Bletchley Road, had now re-opened their fried fish and chip department although, due to a shortage of oils and fat, they could not fry every night. No such limitations were affecting Beacon Brushes, however, for they presently had 50 vacancies for learners, machinists, and other positions, as well as for two clerks. Meanwhile, at the rival concern of James Root and Son, in Tavistock Street, girls were needed to learn the trade of paintbrush manufacture. Thirsty work perhaps, and in a spirited decision on Thursday, January 3rd Bletchley magistrates granted the full transfer of the off beer licence at 22, Park Street, from Miss Dorothy Gammage to Adolph Ament, the secretary of the Victoria Wine Co., where shop boys were now required. As the replacement for the recently deceased Walter Harrison, Mr. Richard Platten, aged 47, had now been appointed as the new manager of Lloyds Bank. Descended from a farming family in Norfolk, he had begun his career at Guildford, and then moved to Beaminster, Dorset. After military service during World War One he was next employed at the branch in Downham Market, to be transferred in 1921 to Cambridge where, in 1939, he gained promotion to clerk in charge of the Cattle Market Office. A keen sportsman, he was married, with one daughter. Following the retirement of Mr. and Mrs. Bollen, under the new ownership of Neal’s their former premises, ‘The Bazaar’, Bletchley Road, was now apparently ‘The shop for all domestic needs’, and could thereby supply tobacco, stationery, hardware, glass, china, and fancy goods. Elsewhere in Bletchley Road, at the detached nos. 38 and 40 there was an opportunity for a hairdressing proprietor, for on Thursday, January 24th the vacant freehold possession of a salon, and also a shop, would be auctioned at 3p.m. at the Conservative Club by Wigley and Johnson. Mr. T. Sipthorp was presently renting the living accommodation at 15s a week, and with the sale being in compliance with the instructions of the will of the late Mrs. E. Frost, the premises would be duly bought by Cowley and Wilson for £2,200. Presumably they had no hairdressing ambitions, as opposed to Mrs. Millicent Joyce, of Wilton Avenue, who now invited potential customers to ‘Have your hair done by a qualified London hairdresser. Send your name and address on a postcard.’ Yet elsewhere in the town there was competition not only from the Co-op, who would shortly require a young lady to take charge of their ladies hairdressing salon - ‘must be proficient in Eugene waving and in all other branches of the profession’ - but also Phyllis Coopers hairdressing salon at 37, Aylesbury Street, where customers might be interested to know that Miss Pamela Brett was currently in attendance. As for additional aspects of personal grooming, from 11a.m. to 8p.m. Mr. Frederick Henry, the tailor, now paid a visit to 5, Bletchley Road, every Thursday.\n\nAt the Co-op Hall, in Albert Street, on Saturday, January 26th ‘a cordial invitation’ was extended by the Bletchley and District Trades Council. This was to attend a talk on ‘Health Aspects of the Factories Act, 1937’, and would be given at 2.30p.m. by Mr. J. Tecey, H.M. District Inspector of Factories. However, such matters were now of little concern to Mr. Jasper Cook who, after 26 years of service, was to retire at the end of the month as the Bletchley general manager and engineer for the British Gas Light Co. Ltd. In consequence, on Tuesday, January 22nd Wigley and Johnson were instructed to auction his surplus furniture and effects at 83, Bletchley Road, adjoining the Gas Offices, and with the workmen and staff making a presentation, at a farewell ceremony held at the works his wife received a table lamp. Mr. Cook had originally come from Herne Bay, where he had been on the staff of the local gas company for several years, and later he became assistant engineer at Bedford Gas Light Co. When he arrived at Bletchley, in 1920 the price of gas, from the then Fenny Stratford Gas Light Co. Ltd., had been nearly 7s per 1,000cu. ft. but now it was little more than 5s! Following the purchase of the gas company in 1928 by the British Gas Light Co., having been promoted to engineer Mr. Cook then became the general manager, and during the war he would oversee many new additions to the works. These included purifiers, a charging machine, coal breakers, a generator, washer/scrubber, condensers, a new boiler, new pump, and a booster, and despite a shortage of man power, (with Army personnel and Italian P.O.W.s having to be variously employed), throughout the hostilities a full supply of gas was always maintained. At Bletchley Mr. Cook had been a prominent Freemason, and now in retirement he and his wife would move to Clacton, where he intended to indulge his leisure by fishing and playing bowls. As for his daughter, Rose, she was presently nursing at St. Mary’s Hospital, Paddington. Mr. Cook’s successor would be Mr. W. Mulley, previously in charge of the British Gas Light Co. stations at Holywell, and Flint, in North Wales, and there would also be a new appointment for Mr. D. Blane, for after 23 years of service with the firm he and his wife were shortly to move to Freshwater, Isle of Wight, where Mr. Blane would take up a position as Assistant Engineer and Manager at the Company’s works. At an informal gathering of the employees, on Tuesday, April 30th he and his wife were therefore bade farewell, being respectively presented with a leather wallet and a silver plated cake tray.\n\nHis wife having died two weeks ago, on January William Hing, now aged 70, retired after nearly 25 years as the Bletchley Co-op grocery manager. He should have retired in 1942, but stayed on because of the wartime conditions. Born at Slapton, for a long while he lived in Leighton Buzzard and began with the Co-op in a local branch at the age of 14. Moving to Watford 4½ years later, in 1899 he married Louie Geeves, of Linslade, and becoming a member of the combined expeditionary force, which landed at Murmansk to protect the Allied interests, he received a commendation during World War One from General Ironside, for his role baking bread. After the war Mr. Hing moved to Bletchley, where he soon became manager of the Albert Street grocery store, and in recognition of his service to the Co-op, on Thursday, April 4th at the Co-op Hall, at the first meeting of the Departmental Branch and Shop Managers Association he would be presented with a silver mounted umbrella.\n\nOffering ‘good wages’, the London Central Meat Co. at 21, Bletchley Road, required a ‘smart lad’, and of a similar business in the town Mr. C.W. Tookey, the butcher and grocer of 74, Bletchley Road, now wished ‘to thank all customers for their support during my absence.’ In fact many local men were now returning from the Forces, and of little surprise house building became a national concern. Therefore, intending to shortly reopen their works at Newton Longville the London Brick Company had the consequent need for brick drawers, brick setters, press operators - male and female - and general labourers, whilst at the Water Eaton works of Flettons there would be a competitive requirement for all classes of brickworkers, general labourers, youths and women. In fact many ex servicemen would find employment at the brickyards, and thereby also a use for their ex army kit, especially the greatcoats and also the gasmask containers, which proved very handy for carrying sandwiches! For those just starting out on their working life, a boy aged 14 to 16 was required for a bread round by Stevens, Aylesbury Street, and boys could also find work at the sawmill of Rowlands, where the firm also had the need for a shorthand typist. Soon the need would also arise for a young man for the grocery trade at the shop of G.E. Chandler, Old Bletchley, and girls, or women, could find part or full time employment at Ramsbothams. By the end of February, Kingsway Garages, High Street, had been appointed as the sole agents in North Bucks. for Hillman, Humber, Sunbeam, Talbot, and Commer, and in a few weeks they would open new showrooms opposite their present premises at 45/47/49 High Street, formerly Berwick House. Meanwhile, at The Garage, High Street, business also seemed buoyant, for Mrs. J. Haynes now required a daily help. From Monday, March 11th Miss Pamela Brett would again be in attendance at the hairdressing salon of Phyllis Cooper, at 37, Aylesbury Street, whilst of other employments the month would find the need for an office cleaner, from 7.30a.m. to 9a.m., Monday to Saturday, at the British Gas Light Co. Ltd., (83 Bletchley Road). They also required a youth as a gas fitter’s mate, a collector for their slot machines, and someone to assist him, and later, during June, a lad of school leaving age would be needed for the weighing office at the Gas Works. Full training would be given, but for those applicants who were unsuccessful then at nearby Metalins vacancies would soon be available on a 47 hour week for chemical workers. However, their routine would no doubt be interrupted by a fire at the premises on the evening of Wednesday, May, 29th when a corrugated iron and wood building, used as a boiler house and store for workmen’s clothes, was burnt out. After 27 years of service, in early March to mark his retirement a cheque for £60 was presented to Mr. W. Billingham, at the quarterly meeting of the Co-op. Having been appointed as the first full time secretary to the Society in November, 1918, he had been the general manager since 1923, and in further appreciation in early April he would be presented with a gramophone, record cabinet and 25 records at a Saturday social, at which Mrs. Billingham received a handbag. Another employee of a long standing service was Hubert Eldridge, who died at his home at 33, Cottingham Grove, in late March. Performing much useful work on the local Food Committee, he had been employed for 30 years in the offices of the General Federation of Trade Unions, firstly in London and then, due to the transfer during the war, at Holne Chase, whilst as for his earlier career, following the outbreak of World War One he served for five years in India and Mesopotamia. He then spent three years in Singapore, where he joined the Singapore Voluntary Army, but on contracting malaria he had to be invalided home.\n\nAt 61, Aylesbury Street, K.H. Axford could now offer stationery, toys, games, fancy goods etc., fishing tackle, greeting cards, children’s books, and maps but possessed of wider ambitions was Mr. N. Green, who now asked the Council if he could establish a public market at the rear of his premises in Bletchley Road. In early April, as recognition for his 50 years of service the C.W.S. board of directors presented an illuminated ‘appreciation’, in a leather folder, to George Adkins of ‘The Indus’, Buckingham Road. As a boy, on March 22nd, 1896 he had begun his working life in the C.W.S. warehouse in Leman Street, London, but during World War One would serve for two years with the artillery in Mesopotamia. After the war, on his appointment as traveller in the London Boot and Shoe Department he then came to Bletchley in 1922. The Bletchley Co-op Hardware and Furnishing Department now advertised that ‘With the Steady return to production of Domestic Goods it will be worth a visit to these Depts.’, since distempers, oil paints, linseed and turps substitute, and paints were all available, as well as paintbrushes. However, the production of brushes at Beacon Brushes would be adversely affected when, on Friday, May 3rd, a quantity of ‘bass’ caught fire. Fortunately the Bletchley and Woburn Sands Fire Brigades were swiftly summoned, and the fire was soon brought under control. Yet the following Monday another blaze then broke out, in in which large quantities of scarce bassine and coca fibre would perish. As the first indications, whilst alone during the lunch hour Mr. Ashley Elmer had heard ‘popping’ noises, (which in fact were caused by the cracking of glass in the store shed), and having urgently attached the works hose to the hydrant in Denbigh Road, he then sent word to Mr. Maclaren to telephone the police. Meanwhile, being later assisted by Mr. Rose he tackled the blaze until the Fire Brigade arrived, with further help being provided by volunteers from the M. A. Cook brushworks, including two of the directors, Mr. Jack Cook, and Mr. Arthur Cook. Assisted by soldiers and P.O.W.s the firemen toiled away in 24 hour relays, but even so the smoke became so dense that traffic had to be guided along the Watling Street. Then, another tragic event befell the company when, after 42 years of marriage, on Good Friday the wife of Mr. A. Cook, a director of the firm, died at The Limes, Staple Hall Road. She was Mrs. Mabel Cook, aged 62, who had been the daughter of Mr. R. Dunkley, a well known saddler in the town.\n\nPermission had been recently sought by Mr. C. Dimmock to develop, as a retail shop, a store building at the junction of Shenley Road and Buckingham Road, and although this would be allowed by the Council the permit was for a maximum of only three years, as a precaution against any interference being caused to plans for the scheduled new developments in the area. A similar permit would then be issued to Mr. H. Wardman, for a small building in a corner of the market field for use in a printing business. At The Corner House, Bletchley Road, Mrs. D. Perrin had now been registered to sell ice cream, and also successful was the application by Mr. V. Bunyan to convert 42, Aylesbury Street into a café. He might therefore be interested in the sale of various cooking equipment held on Wednesday, May 15th at the former British Restaurant, which included two solid fuel, ‘but converted to gas’, Yorkshire Range Units. Also to be auctioned by Wigley and Johnson were a hot plate for £24, and a gas café set for £10 10s, and of the 10 lots, nine would be purchased by Mr. O. Tramantini, and Mr. N. Green, for Greenways Café. In early May Walter Pacey, the son of the late Thomas Pacey, a local painter and decorator, died at the age of 57 in America, where he had worked as a florist. Having left Bletchley at the age of 19, as a football player for the Fenny Stars and Rovers he soon introduced the game to his adopted district, and in 1914 he returned to England for three months to visit his brother, Lawrence. Another sad death was that of Charles Haywood, who at the age of 83 died at Hounslow on Monday, May 27th. Having for many years been a warden and church councillor at St. Martin’s, for nearly 18 years he had worked as a blacksmith in Denmark Street, but left Bletchley in 1928 for Chalfont St. Peters, from where he later moved to Cromwell Road, Hounslow. By the end of May, having approved plans for a gas plant house at the Gasworks, for the British Gas Light Co. Ltd., the Council also gave permission for Mr. Price to erect a garage at 202, Buckingham Road, as well as allowing Harris Wardman Printing Co. to put up a temporary building in Oliver Road. However, there was sad news for the Blackmore Fashion Co. when, at 1, Mount Street, London, W.1, the managing director, Mr. William Blackmore, died after a long illness at the age of 49. The firm had origins in North West London, and having taken over the business from his uncles, in 1940 to escape the Blitz he transferred the company to the old Fenny Stratford Town Hall, in the High Street. He lived with his wife, Vera, and their two children, Jeanette and Roy, in Woburn Sands, and when in 1944 they moved back to London, he would then divide his time between there and Fenny Stratford.\n\nPriced at 27s 6d each, Bletchley Co-op had now received a stock of strong deckchairs with ‘sturdy frames’. They could additionally offer Junior models at 18s 9d, and also on the subject of leisure at 51, Bletchley Road, Williamsons could supply amplifiers for any indoor or outdoor event. As for Weatherheads, as well as their shop at 73, Bletchley Road, from Monday, May 27th they would also trade from premises at 33, Aylesbury Street holding, to coincide with the re-opening of television programmes, television demonstrations on Friday, June 7th. On the following day, at the Assembly Rooms of the Conservative Club they would then hold further television demonstrations which, being watched by an audience of around 600 people, featured the Victory Celebrations in London. In fact the spectacle no doubt encouraged an increased demand for television sets, for which, despite the cost, there was now a waiting list. Including those from the Northampton Brewery Co., and Flitton and Co., Bedford, the firm of Stanifords, in Bletchley Road, were currently able to supply ales and stouts, in bottles and casks, from their premises in Bletchley Road, but at 86, Bletchley Road the premises were now under new management, for Mr. W.H. Thurlow had sold his fish business to the Co-op. Being survived by one son and a daughter, at his home in Denmark Street on Saturday, June 29th James Page, a special constable, and one of Bletchley’s oldest tradesmen, died aged 75. As a newly married couple, he and his wife moved to the town 55 years ago, and having set up as a shoe maker he had continued in this business until around last October. During the First World War, in which he lost two sons, he served as a special constable, and for similar service in World War Two he had been recently presented with the special constable certificate. Now back in ‘civvies’, Arthur Holdom was able to once again offer his expertise tuning and repairing pianos, ‘Any distance’, and also returning to ‘civvy street’ was Mr. J. Brookes. With many years experience he was a professional photographer, and, having now been released from his photographic instructional duties in the Forces, had opened a photo studio at 43, Bletchley Road. However, for the thousands of service personnel who were presently returning to domestic life, the financial realities were emphasised when, by the authority of a permit dated 18th June, granted by the Minister of Fuel and Power, the directors of the British Gas Light Co. Ltd. announced that, from the reading of the meters for the June quarter, the price of gas would be increased by 2d to 15d a therm. Nevertheless, business remained sufficiently brisk for vacancies to be created for stokers, stoker-labourers, and general labourers, and later in the year a works maintenance fitter would also be required, ‘able to do acetylene welding and forge work.’\n\nFor a young lady aged 14 to 16, a job opportunity was presently available in the footwear department of J.E. Wells, in Aylesbury Street. An assistant was also needed for Gilroy’s dress shop, whilst for boys, a youth was needed to train as a shoe repairer at Hill’s shoe shop. Elsewhere, clean, homely lodgings were required by a saw mechanic employed at Rowlands, and on Saturday, July 27th for Mr. C. Pacey, the Aylesbury Street ironmonger, there was cause for celebration when the wedding was solemnised of Mary, his only daughter, with Roger Roberts of Baldock, who was presently on ‘demob’ leave from the R.A.F.
