McArdle was a well known city councilman in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania between 1911 and 1940. Prior to that, he was president of the labor union The Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers.\n\nPeter Joseph \"P.J.\" McArdle was born in Belpre, Washington County, Ohio. He was the son of Peter McArdle and Ann Gorman.[1] His obituary says that he was orphaned at the age of 5 and then was raised by an aunt in Clifton, West Virginia. At 16, he got his first job as a bar heater in a mill in Pomeroy, Ohio, where he worked for 5 years. Then, in 1895, he moved to Muncie, Delaware County, Indiana.[2]\n\nP.J. married Margaret Flaherty on 21 Nov 1900 in Muncie.[3] They had 8 children.[2][4]\n\nIn his 20's, P.J. began to get involved in the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel, and Tin Workers, a labor union, and quickly was put into leadership positions. In 1905, he was elected president of the union, the youngest man to ever hold the position at that point.[5] His family then moved to Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, where the union headquarters were located.[6] In 1911, he was elected to the Pittsburgh city council for the first time. He would serve on and off the council for the rest of his life.[2]\n\nP.J. died on 1 Jan 1940 in Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania.[1][2] He was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Pittsburgh.[7] After his death, the Mt. Washington Roadway in Pittsburgh, which he had advocated for on the city council, was renamed for him - the P.J. McArdle Roadway.[8]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nP.J.'s parental family has not yet been completely identified.
