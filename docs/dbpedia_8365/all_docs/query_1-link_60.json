This book was commissioned when its author was on one side of the Atlantic and completed, a little later than intended, on the other side of that ocean. I am, without reservation, indebted to Edinburgh University Press for persisting with me. As, too, did Jenny Wormald, the academic who waited. Thank you for being the most generous editor one could wish for. To Trevor Griffiths my profound appreciation for reading an earlier draft of this book and for the hospitality that makes my visits home the transatlantic equivalent of comfort eating. And to my family, including the furry and pedantic members, my thanks for reading as well as ‘being’ major parts of this book.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd viii\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\nIf there is an overused descriptor bestowed upon contemporary experiences, it was the ‘singularity’ of that society. As a metaphor for the age, it smacks of amazement, incredulity and historical inimitability. Historians are wont to impress the uniqueness of their period upon their readers, and to avoid disappointment such claims are made here. The span 1832 to 1914 is when the technology of modernity came firmly into view: the electric telegraph, the motorised omnibus and the sailing ship that no longer depended on nature to propel its passengers and cargo. Above all, the steam railway shrank the temporal distances criss-crossing the Scottish mainland as it did the connection to England and, through the country’s ports, passage to the wider world. Not that the Scottish people had ever been hermitic, but this was an age marked by the movement of people and the flow of information – both in and out of the nation. The steam-powered rotary press brought down the cost of printing, increased the speed of publishers’ output and better helped the Scots to read about themselves and learn about others from any number of standpoints. Prior to 1830, 131 newspapers had been registered in Scotland. Over the next two decades, 169 new newspapers were established and more than 100 more were added each decade throughout the century. The unstamped press flourished around the time of franchise reform in 1832, with fifty-four of these publications in Glasgow alone. With a partial reduction in the cost of the stamp tax in 1840 and removal of that tax in 1855 the advent of daily news had\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 1\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n2\n\nourselves and others\n\ncome. Periodicals were strongest in the first half of the century, regional newspapers in the second half. The Orcadian began publishing in 1854, The Shetland Times rolled out its first edition in 1872 and the Dundee publisher D. C. Thomson dominated the reading matter of Tayside and Fife after 1905 with its mixture of provincial newspapers and weeklies for women. The Celtic Magazine and other nineteenth-century periodicals – such as Tait’s and Blackwood’s (both Edinburgh), Fraser’s (London) and Harper’s (New York) – fed the minds of Scotland’s learned civil society. When Chambers’s Edinburgh Journal started in 1832 it quickly gained a readership of 80,000 before shifting focus to London under new editorship in the 1850s. But with a range of publishing houses on their doorstep, few others were compelled to follow the path south. The evidence suggests Scotland was a more literate society than England, a consequence of its many schools (religious and secular), its universities and a civil society bulked and developed by early urbanisation. Publishing brothers William and Robert Chambers informed readers of their Information for the People (1856) that Scotland had long benefited from the advantage of a ‘universally diffused means of elementary education’. In their view it established the Scots as steadfast people, examples of fidelity and perseverance, each possessing ‘some tincture of literature’. While imagined from afar as preserving an essentially oral society – from which the much-translated ancient poetry of Ossian had sprung – the Scots would be more likely found reading their political economy, their tracts and their mechanical descriptions, nurtured under the guise of ‘improvement’. Begun in the 1840s, mechanics’ institutes drew members for the newspapers, periodicals and manuals stocked in their libraries and reading rooms, and for guidance to the manufacturing processes taught in their classrooms. Practical and prosaic, reading was not just for pleasure or debate. Such pathways to learning enabled a wide array of contrasting ideas to penetrate, any choice of which will seem diverse: exiled from both Switzerland and France, the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Mazzini established himself in England as a literary\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 2\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\ncommentator in 1837; Karl Marx published Das Kapital in 1867 written from his favourite seat in the British Library; Sherlock Holmes first pitted his intellect against London’s criminal fraternity in A Study in Scarlet in 1887; Peter Rabbit bounced quietly into print with a limited private edition of his Tales by author Beatrix Potter in 1901. Lauded by John Stuart Mill for giving a fresh perspective to Britain’s tendency toward cultural insularity, Mazzini was read in Scotland not least through his contributions to Tait’s Magazine. His one-time collaborator Giuseppe Garibaldi – who was likened to William Wallace – found that Oban Town Council had placed a steamer at his disposal so he might complete the ‘experience’ of touring Scotland in the 1850s by journeying to Staffa and Iona. Once Das Kapital had been translated into English in 1887, radicals and later socialists could read for themselves the ideas of the man they had learned about in the monthly journals Modern Thought and Contemporary Review, both London-based periodicals that circulated north of the border. Scottish-born Arthur Conan Doyle’s connections with the nation were impeccable; he lived at various addresses in Edinburgh before moving south, and based his detective on the forensic science of Dr Joseph Bell from Edinburgh University’s medical faculty. In contrast, but just as perceptive on human relations, Peter Rabbit was welcomed to Scotland from the Lake District. His Tales, a potential Christmas gift in 1902, left The Scotsman’s critic delighted with Peter’s childlike actions that were so appealing yet without ceasing to be those of a rabbit. These stories and much more arrived to shape the culture of the Scots. Connection through the electric telegraph and the transatlantic cable mid-century meant this small north-western European nation was imbued increasingly deeply with values from other nations as well as those from its own people. When Paul Reuter moved to London in 1851 and made use of the new communication technology, he endeavoured to send news around the world, counting the Scottish newspapers amongst his clients. News from the agency that took his name was printed regularly in The Scotsman, in one instance reporting from Paris that the French royal family ‘mingled their regret and grief with\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 3\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n4\n\nourselves and others\n\nthe Royal Family and the English nation’ for the death of the Prince Consort in 1861. The column also contained snippets from Prussia, Herzegovina, the Brazils and America, and reports on the Bombay Mail and the eruption of Vesuvius. Like nations on both sides of the Atlantic, the Scots were intrigued by the new communications. A lecture the next year on the technology of telegraphy by Major J. H. A. Macdonald, of the Edinburgh Rifle Volunteers, and in support of that regiment, explained the different approaches and exhibited part of the failed transatlantic cable which had a tendency to unravel because of the direction of the join – one twisted to the right, the other to the left – a problem confirmed by two independent assessors. This singular age in Scotland’s history can be pitched as opening the nation to the movement of people, ideas and information more intensely than before. There was nothing static or moribund here, even for the most immobile handloom weaver, stable lad or domestic servant. Strangers, travellers, tramps, tourists and economic migrants were commonplace, as Chapter 6 and Chapter 11 will show. News was circulating, and it was more recent news than their grandparents’ generation would have known. News, indeed, had become an industry. Information was packaged and manufactured just as any piece of wrought iron or woollen hose added value to the raw materials they comprised. These Scots had the means to know more about themselves than their forebears knew about themselves. They especially had greater opportunity to learn about others, whether they resided inside the nation or outside its boundaries. Being Scottish was not simply being other than English or being other than Catholic. Being Scottish was not a rejection of the unknown, but a reflection of the known. In this age of deepening information flows, the nation’s history was in dialogue with the nation’s identities. THE SOCIOLOGY OF OBJECTIFICATION\n\nVery lightly, this book will make use of objectification theory to frame its analysis. Borrowed from gender studies, the theory\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 4\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n5\n\nis formed to show how society objectifies women to separate their sexuality from their personality. In turn it leads to selfobjectification, where the observer’s perspective is internalised and taken to be one’s own. The French philosopher Michel Foucault explains how objectification is achieved by dividing sections of society into distinct groups, by the application of (claimed) scientific classification and then by the subjectification of self. By believing in how others have objectified our history, by the self-objectification of that view because it is presented to us rationally, we internalise ourselves as subjects and deny our own agency. For good reason the late Victorian theorist Ernest Renan explained that getting history wrong is essential to how nations are formed. To better explore Scotland’s history and identity during the rise of modernity, self-objectification will be used to analyse the inter-relationship of ourselves and others. The evidence comes from what contemporaries thought was happening, and what it meant for them as a people, and what they thought of ‘others’ both inside and outside the nation. By the same token, it is a reflection of what contemporaries external to the nation thought was going on in Scotland, and thought they knew about the Scots, and what they told the Scots about themselves. Such echoes may be artifice; these observations may be distortions; the contemporary conclusion may be misplaced. So this intellectual interchange will be presented alongside the socio-economic history of a near century of transformation. As much as Ourselves and Others is a narrative history book, it is story formed in the interplay of personal identity (myself), the framework of the nation (ourselves) and the knowledge of others. A YEAR OF BEGINNINGS\n\nIn both Scotland’s and Britain’s capital cities, the discussion of 1832 was all about politics, and in particular the ‘Nation’s Bill’. The Times caught the mood:\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 5\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nourselves and others\n\n6\n\nEverything now announces that this great restorative of a decayed constitution will be realized. The Sovereign is, as he ever was, staunch to his conviction, and to his Royal word once given: in the Cabinet there is not a shadow of difference upon the course to be pursued. The people of Great Britain are alike unanimous; what, then, can an expiring party do?\n\nThe Parliamentary Reform of 1832 – expanding the franchise to allow those owning property to the value of £10 to vote in general elections – was enacted by separate English and Scottish legislation. It pulled proportionately more Scots into the voting booths and produced a system for both countries that was more reflective of recent population settlement. The Reform also invigorated the link between politics, a progressively dominant industrial economy and the new media nurtured by civil society. In the interpretation of The North American Review in January 1832, reform of Westminster was ‘an American question’, not one simply for the people of Scotland or England. This was not for the principles of democracy, but for the commercial relations that crossed the Atlantic. Those whose income and wealth came from trade and industrial endeavour had pushed for political power to be opened and while the British electoral system had led the world with this initial expansion, ground was steadily lost. America, Australia, New Zealand, Russia and Germany all widened their electorate later but then more extensively than Britain. Indeed, most adult Scots had no entitlement to vote for or against their government. In 1911, only 54 per cent of men in Glasgow (and 60 per cent of men for the whole of Scotland) were entitled to vote. Women lacked even that, despite the increasingly vociferous campaigning of the suffrage movement from 1867. Women ratepayers could vote in Scottish burgh elections in 1884, in county elections in 1894 and in parish council elections in 1894 (the only instance of the three where they could stand for office). The position of town councillor was a privilege open only to men until 1907 as was that of county councillor until 1914. Scottish women\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 6\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n7\n\nin some parts of the diaspora were granted the legislative vote earlier than their sisters, mothers and daughters back home: in New Zealand (1893), in Australia (standardised under the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902, while indigenous women remained excluded) and in Canada (1917). In 1918 women over the age of thirty who owned property could cast their vote at a British general election, but not until 1928 were women and men enfranchised equally. CHOLERA: MORIBUS AND SPASMODIC\n\nConcurrent with the agitation around electoral reform, throughout 1832 the people had a new threat to deal with. It came from cholera, and it caused fear for the ease with which it had spread since its first appearance the previous December. To some, the consequences of the disease were being overstated, more mirage than reality, a political tool used to stifle free discussion amongst the working classes and to further impose external morality on their behaviour. When The Loyal Reformers’ Gazette told its Glasgow-dominated readership that this new health scare was but a distraction from the Reform debate, they argued it gave the Tories reason to delay action in Westminster. With an average monthly death rate of twenty to thirty in Edinburgh, cholera did not seem especially virulent. In Glasgow, 106 cases resulted in forty-six deaths. For England and Scotland combined in the year, there were 5,064 cases reported and 1,496 deaths confirmed from the disease. The Gazette, in spiteful jest, even offered a cure: Take a full and fair representation of the people, the whole people, and nothing but the people; let the House of Commons, this chosen, immediately reduce the taxes; let the poor obtain cheap bread, wholesome food, and warm clothing, in exchange for their labour, and thus they will defy the Cholera.\n\nIt was a debate about social class, with consumption and typhus associated with the undernourished poor, whereas until understanding developed in the 1860s of how cholera was transmitted\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 7\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n8\n\nourselves and others\n\nthrough contaminated water, that disease induced panic across the social orders. Despite the Gazette’s accusation that they were mere operatives of the state for their intervention into the cleanliness, intemperance and eating habits of the poor, the Scottish medical profession took a line that marked a difference from the sanitary strategies introduced in the English towns and cities. They encouraged ventilation in housing and discouraged people from going out at night when the disease was present. The Boards of Health of Dundee and Edinburgh asked the populace to eat before leaving the house, to dress more warmly than usual and to avoid large gatherings of other working-class people, even at church. Spasmodic cholera had been long known in India and contemporaries traced the current problem to a particularly virulent attack that moved to Calcutta in September 1817. The disease then spread throughout the regions and into the army, causing watery purging, first without pain, then sickness, then pain rising up from the toes, through the legs and inducing a burning in the stomach, with death coming within four to six hours of onset. It moved to Persia in 1821, the Mediterranean in 1823, Tehran in 1828, Georgia in 1830, then ravaged the Russian and Polish armies in the spring of that year. Paris was badly affected, and by October the disease had made its way to Sunderland and into an emigrant ship spotted at New Ross in Ireland. London at this point was only mildly affected, and various reasons were posited: their meat diet, perhaps, or the sulphur from their coal? Was it the narrow and thickly populated areas that experienced its effects more widely than the wider-built areas? In Scotland, East Lothian saw some of the earliest cases of the disease, in Musselburgh, Tranent and Prestonpans. It seemed to miss some regions completely, to travel great distances without losing its virulence, to backtrack on itself and to spread against the prevailing winds. It was made worse in Musselburgh because of the presence of typhus before and during the epidemic, while in Prestonpans, the beggars, colliers and ‘dissipated persons’ were most afflicted.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 8\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n9\n\nFigure I.1 Cholera!

The Scottish economy of the 1830s was filled with latent transformative power. This came with the partial replacement of industry around textiles with processes powered by coal and steam. Mechanisation and the factory were to become the new mark of Scotland’s economy; iron, steel, chemicals and shipbuilding fired a small nation to increase its GDP by 10 per cent, close enough to England’s lead and well in front of Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy and Austria. It was an uneven story, as Chapter 6 shows, and small industrialists continued apace. Indeed, even the largest concerns were dependent on human capital rather than physical plant. Around one million more jobs were created during the period in focus here, but wages remained some 10–20 per cent lower than for similar work in England. The near constant movement in search of work was the norm for most, and for many that journey took them overseas. SCOTT IS DEAD. LONG LIVE SCOTT-LAND\n\nOne who opposed the Reform legislation but welcomed the economic benefits of political union with England was the celebrated novelist Sir Walter Scott. His narrative and poetic writings were to define the age with their mixture of romance, Jacobitism and historical reflection. The year 1832, however, marked his death. The first stroke came in February 1831, a second shortly after and a third more serious one in April, as his daughter Anne recounted: Papa is recovering slowly, but mere acquaintance would think him quite well. In mind he has always been the same. In this last attack he has never lost it, but I think his speech is not quite right yet.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 10\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n11\n\nIndeed, till it comes round the disease is still, I fear, hanging about him. He is very irritable, and will not believe but it has been my insisting on him being bled that has made him ill.\n\nScott’s failing health was headline news around the world and of concern to monarchs and compatriots alike. In October Scott travelled to the Mediterranean, given passage on a man-o’-war at the insistence of King William. The Scotsman thought it necessary to report on letters that had arrived from Malta on 24 November 1831 announcing that Scott had survived the journey and the general improvement in his health. In January, he was presented to the King of Naples who offered to order any excavation of Pompeii that he may desire. Instead Sir Walter chose a trip to Athens, with Sir Frederick Adam offering passage on a government steamer for his convenience. On hearing of the presentation, the satirist within the Pittsburgh Gazette suggested the ‘King of Naples has the honor of being presented to Sir Walter Scott’. The novelist began his return in May of that year, but suffered a fourth stroke in Nijmegen, delaying his return to Scotland. In June, under ‘English news’, his state of health was reported in Courrier de la Louisiane, a daily published in New Orleans. The fulfilment of his wish that he return to Abbotsford was reported in the American & Commercial Daily Advertiser, and under ‘European News’ the likelihood that Scott’s life would soon end was reported in the Geneva Gazette. Scott died at his Abbotsford home on 21 September 1832 at around 1.30 p.m. This was the passing of a celebrity. The obituary for the ‘wizard of the north’ was reproduced worldwide. The Pittsburgh Gazette heard ‘a universal echo this side of the Atlantic’ for his mourning. The Connecticut Courant copied its account of Scott’s celebrated life from The Times and Fraser’s Magazine, explaining that the major events in his life were so known to the world that they did not need repeating. Despite Sir Walter’s passing, Scott-land continued apace. Boosted by the quixotic descriptions in Marmion and Lady of the Lake especially, foreign visitors and others had long been attracted to Scott’s romanticisation of the west coast to gaze\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 11\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n12\n\nourselves and others\n\nupon a coastline and a people that were ‘unchanged’, appeared unworldly and offered a looking glass into an earlier time. This the outsider contrasted with their own life: of towns, fashion, of being fashionable and an intellectual exchange so different from the people one nodded recognition to at the church hall, the coffee house or the dinner club. The ever-quotable English critic Dr Samuel Johnson, encouraged by his Scottish-born companion and biographer James Boswell, was an earlier tourist in search of authenticity. The tales of the Hebridean poet Ossian were a sensation from 1760 via the antiquarianism and writings of James Macpherson (1736–96). It created Europe-wide shorthand of what Scotland and its people were to those looking in from afar. Johnson made this judgement despite A Journey to the Western Isles of Scotland (1775) being published at the zenith of the Scottish Enlightenment. Ossian was at the centre of ‘sublime existence’, offering a guide to travellers in search of a ‘physical’ or a ‘metaphysical’ experience. Another who came was the composer Felix Mendelssohn. The year was 1829 and he was twenty years of age. Mendelssohn had followed the path of romantics before him, braving seasickness to take the small rowing boat to the island of Staffa, located in the Hebrides off Scotland’s western coastline. The cave became his inspiration to write The Hebrides Overture (Fingal’s Cave) the next year and then The Scottish Symphony, although it would be another dozen years before it was finished. Mendelssohn, like the others, came looking for Scotland and for the Scots. His music would be his discovery, objectifying Scotland’s pre-modern past into aural shorthand for the pleasure of a modern society. Like Scott-land, The Hebrides Overture summarised its subject. SEEING OURSELVES AS OTHERS SEE US\n\nThese visitors were in search of landscape and emotion, of essential Scotland more than the everyday Scot. But what did the people look like in this period? Their clothing and fashion are examined in Chapter 7, most of it remarkably uniform.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 12\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n13\n\nTheir physical features are not so easily catalogued. One English art critic’s description of the Scots comes from Lady Eastlake, who gave some thought to this question in her diary entries for 1844: On first returning to Scotland you are struck with two prominent national physiognomies. The one, the accepted type of the Scottish face – long in the chin and high in the cheeks; the features large, all but the eyes, and as ill put together as the limbs of the body; the upper lip turning out, and as large as the lower one; the hair reddish-grey, straggling, and coarse; the skin tight and freckled, and the working of every bone in the face seen under it. But occasionally good teeth and good humour enliven the face: honesty you expect from it, and vulgarity you are not surprised at; much sense and no vice are to be found in it. The other is very different; but, I fancy, equally Scotch. A small, well-set head, going up straight from the back, with clean-cut, sharp, hard features; small, light, and very red-lipped mouth, the long slender nose rather drawing it upwards; complexion clear, with a set colour; hair black and plentiful, and deepest eyes of a peculiarly dark slate colour, with a fine, tightskinned, slightly wrinkled brow, which looks as if it worked hard for its owner. A face of no softness and no openness, but intensely shrewd and intellectual, and one which you are long in trusting and never tire of examining. The women have, many of them, wide open faces, with their features, the moment they speak, flopping back like the borders of their caps.\n\nOther descriptions flowed from cultural stereotypes. Punch, for example, tended to eschew the simian features it assigned for the Catholic Irish and instead used highland garb in its satire to distinguish all Scots from ourselves. Scientists also offered some descriptions. John Beddoe’s presidential address to the Anthropological Society in 1872 reflected on Scottish ethnicity and its association with national identity: Blood may rule the physique, but climate and other media, and linguistic, religious and other history all act, of course, upon the character and sympathies of a people; and as personal identity has been affirmed to consist in the consciousness of personal identity, so it might be argued, not without some appearance of plausibility, that\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 13\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nourselves and others\n\n14\n\nnational identity consisted merely in the consciousness of national identity.\n\nBeddoe’s earlier work had seemingly identified a distinctive distribution of eye and hair colours, with light hair and eyes in the east, especially the south-east, light eyes and dark hair in the west, and an increase in darker shades in the towns and cities. Much of this research was impressionistic, and in 1908 Beddoe unsuccessfully employed colour cards to measure and debate J. F. Tocher’s observations the previous year on the connection between physical characteristics and insanity. Tocher had studied over 50,000 school children to discover the preponderance of red hair in the north-east of Scotland, precisely the area where most asylums were to be found. This research in turn built on John Cleghorn’s 1868 inquiry into whether Scottish character could be deduced from the attributes of the soil. Cleghorn attempted to compare Scots in the east with those in the west, and to compare the Scots with the English. Findings from Board of Trade returns showed him there was little difference between the amount of corn and the number of cattle and sheep under cultivation throughout Scotland, but their value was greater in the east than in the west: ‘The want of soil, the want of food, on the west, is further seen in the Gaelic, for it and heather go together’. Confidently he stated that the ‘east man is taller and his head bigger’ than his western counterpart. In the east there have been religious revolutions, but in the west they ‘move in masses’ – where ‘Papacy is the religion of poverty’. His answer for progress was to mix up the soil and mix up the species, because the ‘character of the Scotch is the expression of the soil of Scotland’. Respondents to the paper were not wholly convinced with his classifications, however, conjuring up examples throughout Continental Europe where the soil was similar but the character different. In these examples of seeing ourselves as others see us, Scott, Mendelssohn, Eastlake, Beddoe, Tocher and Cleghorn all sought to objectify Scotland by dividing the nation into distinct groups: a Jacobite heart and sublime landscape by Scott; an aural Ossian\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 14\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nIntroduction\n\n15\n\nby Mendelssohn; the nation’s physiognomies by Eastlake, Beddoe and Tocher; the character of the nation formed from its soil by Cleghorn. Through the rationalisation of these classifications – and the historical, cultural, aural and scientific objectification of Scotland – the national self was subjugated, historical agency was downplayed and Scottish identity was formed. WE MOVE ON\n\nOurselves and Others is a social history based on a question so simple yet so difficult to answer: who were the Scots? When we look at the great changes that took place in Scotland, and explore the factors affecting how many Scots were being born, the rate at which they died, the numbers who left for a life elsewhere, those who returned and those who came from other countries, we are moved to try to understand the lives of the Scottish people and those who lived in Scotland. Consciously, this is a history of Scots within the nation, within Britain, and also distant of Scotland. The chapters are set out to investigate Scotland as a society structured by its institutions, its economy and its political and constitutional framework, along with multifarious customs, beliefs and accepted ways of doing things. The denominational differences within Protestantism, and Presbyterianism most especially, and the growth in the number of Irish Catholics midcentury were reflected in marriage, childbirth, illegitimacy and social mores, as well as cultural control and legal and social punishment. Religious beliefs and practices structured many different aspects of lives that were ordinary as well as the experiences of extraordinary people in this period. And the churches, too, structured the lives of Scots overseas. The number of Presbyterian churches to be found throughout the ‘new world’ is testament to that, with by comparison nary an Anglican church to be found in the Maritime Provinces of Prince Edward Island or Nova Scotia, for example. But this is also evidenced by a debate that strained the Free Church of Scotland immediately after its creation in 1843: should it take much-needed\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 15\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n16\n\nourselves and others\n\nfinancial help from Scottish slave owners in the southern states of America, or was that help tainted beyond its monetary value? Ourselves and Others is a blended history of the Scots in a period of major transformation. It is not about ‘the other’, for that is only part of how life was envisaged and identities were formed. ‘Being Scotland’ is about the blend itself. We do not simply reflect ourselves in England’s economic and constitutional development or in Ireland’s Roman Catholicism; we are part of that development, as it is part of us, of being Scottish within the united kingdom of Britain. The wearing of multiple hats – one or another, but never more than one at a time – or imagining identities as if they were a Russian doll – each selfcontained but subsumed beneath a larger identity – was not being Scotland in the 1832–1914 period. There was no zerosum or sliding scale here. Rather, it was a relentless eddy of historical developments from home and away, some engaged with completely, most only elliptically; in other words a blend of our history with a chaser of others.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 16\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n1 Being Scotland\n\nLAND OF BROWN HEATH AND SHAGGY WOOD\n\nWhere ‘being Scotland’ first formed was upon the land. Not by itself an island, Scotland nevertheless meets the sea with 6,100 miles of coastline. The nation’s single land border is to the south, shared with England, and little changed over centuries. The North Channel and the Irish Sea take the Scot to Ireland and the Atlantic Ocean to the west; the Pentland Firth joins the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea to the north; the North Sea ferries the Scot east to Scandinavia and the Low Countries and, once the journey around England has been made, the English Channel to the European Continent completes the circuit. Scotland is a narrow country. From Berwick upon Tweed in the east to the Solway Firth in the west the distance is around sixty-eight miles. Scotland is no easy shape to measure, but estimates made to the Board of Agriculture mid-century came to the conclusion that its landmass comprised 18,944,000 acres, with 5,043,450 acres that were cultivated and 13,900,550 acres that were not. Of this number, Scotland’s islands comprise around 4,000 square miles, and its lakes and rivers around 638 square miles. Measured in 1870, there was 3.5 million acres of arable land, with the remainder being grassland, used primarily for hay. The biggest of Scotland’s islands are nestled in the Outer Hebrides to the west and Shetland to the north (covering 352,337 acres) with around twenty-five of its ninety islands inhabited in the 1830s. In total, the Scottish nation comprises\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 17\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n18\n\nourselves and others\n\nupwards of 790 islands with many of these little more than outcrops while others were populated seasonally or when moving cattle or sheep from grazing grounds to market. Great Britain is the largest island in Europe and Scotland takes up around 30 per cent of its landmass. There are twentysix square miles of land in Britain to every one mile of coastline, a remarkably low figure, with vaguely comparable estimates for the continents showing Europe at around 229 square miles per mile of coastline, America 437, Asia 500 and Africa 741. Divided by the Highland Boundary Fault, which travels from the north-east to the south-west of the nation, separating highland from lowland, there are three great regions of the nation: the southern uplands and central belt around the Firth of Forth and Firth of Clyde; the central area of Tayside and Perthshire going north to Inverness-shire and the north-east; and the highland area to the west of the Great Glen. So variable is Scotland’s topography that there is much difference in how land was put to use, its mountainousness being the origin of rivers as well as of the absence of plentiful rich soil. Scotland is a small land mass, and only around a quarter of its acreage was cultivable in this period. Nor was agricultural work helped greatly by the weather. Scotland has a temperate climate, a wet and windy one, not conducive to the cultivation of the wheat and corn that was found in greater abundance in England. Wheat generally struggles to grow above 500 feet (700 feet maximum), and while oats are not fond of elevations above 1,200 feet, along with barley and the potato these were mainstays of Scotland’s cash crop production and the nation’s diet. The figures in Table 1.1 refer to Scotland after the potato blight had all but passed and the highland region was slowly regaining its output. The potato crop yielded 529,915 tons in 1854 and 732,141 tons in 1855. When all produce is totalled, ‘man and beast’ of Scotland produced 1,532,004 tons of food in 1854 and 1,592,604 tons in 1855. It was the nation’s western and highland lands that were ‘the mighty impulse’ that inspired both Scott and Wordsworth into poetic excitement, such was its polar contrast to lowland\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 18\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland Table 1.1\n\n19\n\nMajor crop yields, 1854, 1855\n\nWheat Barley Oats Beans and peas Total (in quarters)\n\n1854\n\n1855\n\n608,063 954,950 4,231,789 135,115 5,927,917\n\n632,817 761,613 3,758,893 147,956 5,301,279\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Statistics.

It is in Dumfries (Wanlockhead at 1,295 feet) and in South Lanarkshire (Leadhills at 1,280 feet) that Scotland’s two highest villages are found, not in the Highlands. And in contrast to the romantic appeal of the nation’s glens and lochs, diverse local enterprise developed as much from below the ground as above. Professor James Nicol’s survey of 1861 divided up the 31,000 square miles of Scotland into 15,500 square miles of gneiss, granite, mica slate and quartz rock; 2,700 square miles of trap; 4,900 of old red sandstone; 4,750 of slate; and 1,750 of coal – the latter in the south of the nation. BEING SCOTLAND\n\nOn top of this geological matrix, Scotland’s rural life, its fishing industry and animal husbandry and, as we shall see more fully in Chapter 6, its mining industry all underpinned so much of the nation’s economy and society. How the identity of the nation as a landmass and as a people of the land flowed into cultural constructions of ourselves and others can be distilled from two inter-related sets of historical developments. The first was a continuation of mid-eighteenth-century attempts to advance the productivity of agricultural work and the living standards of the rural population, the philosophy of ‘improvement’. The midnineteenth-century arrival of Phytophthora infestans, potato\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 19\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n20\n\nourselves and others\n\nFigure 1.1 Map of Scotland showing land-use and population density, 1895. © National Library of Scotland. Licensor www.scran.ac.uk\n\nblight, challenged this philosophy and added an edge to how the highland Gael (and the Irish immigrant) was objectified. The second, also based on older debates, is the consequence of Improvement for ownership of the land, from the great highland estates to the small crofts. If outsiders, absentee Scots and elites predominated in owning Scotland, what did it mean for ourselves as a community if we had limited or no legal entitlement to the land of our fathers and mothers? The crofters’ war of the 1880s was an important part of the answer. ON AN ISLAND, WITH THE ANIMALS\n\nBecause they lived on an island, guaranteed water was important to the Scots. Food and fuel were caught from the sea and rivers\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 20\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n21\n\nor scavenged from the beach: the harvesting of kale created its own industry. The herring industry added around £1 million to the British economy each year in the 1860s, employing 91,139 people directly, including 39,266 as fishermen. The Shetland Islanders described themselves as fishermen with farms while the Orcadians to their south were farmers with boats. When cash-rich lowland capitalists partnered with locals in Caithness and Sutherland to invest in larger boats to fish the northern and western waters in the 1840s, it led to an expansion in related jobs in gutting, curing and drying fish for wider markets. From mid-century the crofting people, cottagers and tenant farmers went in significant numbers to temporary employment in fishing fleets operating out of these two counties and around the Clyde coast. These examples are reminders that in this age of steam, the sailing boat continued to have a relevant economic role. Animals, too, were central to changes in local economic activity. The Marquis of Breadalbane converted 240 square miles of land around Glencoe into a deer farm in the 1820s for hunting, catering for outsider engagement with the highland estates. Mid-century the Mar estate employed fifteen gamekeepers to attend its hunting visitors and added construction jobs to build fencing and rounds (towers) to meet the new leisure requirements of the land. With an estimated 2 million acres given over to farming deer for hunting in the 1860s, the waste of cultivable land was loudly questioned. The sport proved lucrative for the landowners who could attract hunters to their straths and glens, but it was a recurrent complaint amongst locals that sportsmen, gamekeepers and their dogs would trample over the fields of corn ‘for such a paltry thing as a dead grouse’. Primarily amongst the more moneyed English, deer stalking increased in popularity in the final quarter of the century as royal and ennobled patronage – backed up by society magazines and retail promotions – injected the masculine blood hunt with a feminine romance divorced from the reality of rural transformation. Deer were not the only animals whose cultivation had a major cultural impact on ‘being Scotland’ even if of less emotive appeal. Horses were expensive to own and were used intensively\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 21\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n22\n\nourselves and others\n\nthroughout the year. The 1857 agricultural census returned 185,409 horses at work on Scotland’s farms – 126,471 under three years of age, 34,947 over three years of age and another 23,991 owned for leisure and transportation. Their value was reflected in the bothy ballads of Scotland’s north-east. This was not simply an indication of the animals’ cultural appeal and the affection in which they were held, but society’s measure of a master, recalling how well he treated them as an economic resource. Far from universal, the bothy system has come to represent some of the hardship of all rural life. The large single room that housed a group of male farmworkers was popular only in areas where there was little work for women. Cows were kept for beef in the north-east and for milk in the south-west. In the east of Scotland in the 1840s pork and bacon were eaten if pigs were kept locally. By 1901 sows kept for breeding represented only 12 per cent of the total number of pigs; the rest were for sale. Of all Scotland’s animals, sheep had the greatest economic, social and cultural impact. Their numbers at the end of the century were well above the human population (of 4.5 million in 1901). The price of cattle had halved between 1810 and 1830, while sheep prices remained more or less unchanged. It was an encouragement for farmers to invest further in the animal, and the land-hungry Blackface and the Cheviot sheep had already been introduced from the middle of the previous century. In 1800 there were an estimated 35,000 sheep in Inverness-shire; by 1880 this had increased to 700,000. Sutherland had seen an earlier and quicker increase, from 15,000 in 1811 to 130,700 in 1820, and the numbers in Argyll increased at a similar rate, reaching one million by 1880. Karl Marx had denounced the Countess of Sutherland as ‘a female Mehemt Ali, who had digested her Malthus’ for her attempt to increase financial returns with the introduction of sheep on her land. By 1835 her scheme had removed 15,000 people and replaced them with sheep farms run by a single family, comprising 131,000 animals. Reflecting on those tenants who objected to their forced removal, the Countess’s estate factor Patrick Seller pleaded in\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 22\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland Table 1.2\n\n23\n\nCensuses of animals in Scotland, 1870–1901\n\nYear\n\nHorses\n\nCattle\n\nSheep\n\nPigs\n\n1870 1871 1877 1884 1885 1901\n\n172,871 174,434 188,736 187,803 188,292 194,893\n\n1,041,434 1,070,107 1,102,074 1,136,604 1,176,004 1,229,281\n\n6,750,854 6,882,747 6,968,774 6,983,293 6,957,198 7,401,409\n\n158,690 195,642 153,257 159,560 150,984 124,821\n\nPoultry\n\n2,307,092 2,325,354\n\nSource: Ministry of Agriculture, Agricultural Statistics.

He felt himself a ‘Dwarf in the fable’ and that ‘our cause has been just, but, then, every battle cost me a leg or an arm . . . I defy the world to say, with truth, that in any part of my conduct, there has been injustice, harshness or unmanliness’. Seller argued that it was the Poor Law that needed attention for the treatment of the cottars, yet the narratives of forcible eviction and the stories of emigration have played an important part in objectifying the landless Scot. Indeed, research suggests that the headlines have masked a more sober judgement that economically the move to sheep farming was a response to rather than a cause of highland poverty. Masked also, argues historian Eric Richards, is the management structure of the sheep farms, which could have been run differently without so drastic a loss of population. In the 1840s agricultural work was still paid predominantly in kind, shielding the communities from downturns in the market, but also hindering the accumulation of even small amounts of capital. The agricultural labourer’s contract detailed how much barley, oats and other grains were to be exchanged, with employment contracted for six or twelve months. This relationship and the ownership of only small amounts of land on the croft or tenant farm made it inherently difficult for rural Scots to escape a life of subsistence. For the years 1856 and 1865, the average value created by a croft in the highland\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 23\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n24\n\nourselves and others\n\ncounties was £33, yet it was estimated that land to the value of £40 or £50 was needed to support a family who had no other source of income. The contemporary calculations indicate that highland agriculture returned little more than £7 per annum on average, meaning that without a good crop and a ready supply of potatoes and fish, then the wellbeing of the family would be quickly undermined. Before 1832 the majority of Scots were employed in agricultural work, but this declined over the period until 1914. In the census return of 1891, over half of Scotland’s population was returned in the towns rather than the countryside. Between 1851 and 1891 the numbers employed in agricultural fell by 41 per cent, with the biggest loss coming during the agricultural depression of 1873 to 1896. The debates surrounding the overpopulation of the countryside were well rehearsed in Archibald Alison’s Principles of Population (1840), William Thomas Thornton’s Over-Population and its Remedy (1846) and John Stuart Mill’s Principles of Political Economy (1848). Yet throughout this period, neither these trends nor the Malthusian fear diminished the economic and cultural importance of rural and agricultural work to ‘being Scotland’, with most Scots still of the land, or only one generation removed from it. Despite the undoubted mundanity and fragility of agricultural work, and – from the outside – its associations with drudgery, poverty, the highland Gael and then the Irish immigrant, estate work was varied. The harvesting of kelp, the digging of canals, the building of roads and fencing, and cattle and sheep rearing were all part of the early-nineteenth-century improvement of the countryside. Enclosure marked out the landscape in the first half of the century; erecting dykes and planting hedges had the benefit of providing work during the off season. Peat was important as fuel in the early decades but lost out to coal and the development of the fireplace to burn the ‘smokeless’ versions later in the century. Horse-drawn ploughs, the rotation of seeding to gain greater productivity and the use of alternative crops like turnips were part of the intensification of lowland farm life. Before the 1840s, and increasingly so afterwards,\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 24\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n25\n\nhighland workers would tramp to lowland farms for seasonal employment, which brought much-needed cash back to the highland economy. Importantly, it better enabled the northern parishes to hang on to their population over the longer term, allowing stomachs to be filled that would otherwise go hungry. Along with the intensification of sheep farming and seasonal and temporary migration, the harvesting of seaweed and the creation of kelp from burning it was a third source of cash income in the highland counties. Kelp was used in the production of soap, glass and iodine, and its trade provided a boost to the west highland economy in the years from around 1760 until the 1830s. It was not an industry that developed any infrastructure, however. The collapse in price that followed the reopening of trade routes at the end of the Napoleonic Wars caused a major loss of cash income. In response to the continued decline up to 1845, the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland put out a call to establish the most economic and straightforward means by which iodine could be extracted in situ from seaweed. The extraction of salt from kelp was chemically difficult and of no commercial gain, even if undertaken in specialist facilities in Glasgow. Iodine, however, was a better bet. Kelp could yield three to four and a half pounds of iodine per ton, and drift-weed could produce six to ten pounds per ton. It was work that could be carried out in the croft, keeping Highlanders in their homes. But the cost of iodine was on a downward trend, collapsing from 30–40s per pound in 1845 to 16s per lb the next year. The discovery in France of the means to convert iodine into a range of permanent dyes, through combining it with metals, had driven the price upwards in 1849, but still the returns did not recover sufficiently. The loss of profit from kelp undermined landowner attempts to establish long-term industrial activity on the coastal fringes while intensifying crop and animal husbandry in the hills and glens. Improvement was variable in its impact and take-up by those instructed in new techniques. Agriculture was only slowly progressing in Orkney in the 1830s with the move away from the single stilted plough to its replacement with the ‘common\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 25\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n26\n\nourselves and others\n\nkind’, with iron-toothed harrows and rollers to ease progress. The use of guano as fertiliser was popularised after 1840, with experiments showing that foreign guano produced 530 stones per Scots acre of turnips more than farmyard dung alone for little more than half the cost. When overseas supplies of guano dried up, ammonia was used, supplied by William ‘Paraffin’ Young’s Oakbank Oil Company. Agricultural improvement was thought not only to aid living standards but also to keep people on the land. In the contemporary analysis of the Rev. David Esdaile, minister of Rescobie in Angus, the acquisition of landed property was the most natural and efficacious remedy to poverty and degradation in the rural areas. This was a desire, he thought, especially strong amongst Scots. His solution was not the forced subdivision of land from the wealthy, but to push the landowner or the cultivator of land to appreciate the happiness engendered if many could enjoy it. They would be wise, he chided, to heed the Wisdom of Solomon: ‘the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself is served by the field’. This ministerial contribution to the Journal of Agriculture countered Lord Brougham’s suggestion that small amounts of land, peopled by a few in constant toil, was no solution to either finding work for the masses or lifting their moral spirits. FIXING THE ROOF\n\nThe philosophy of agricultural improvement and its application mixed internal and external objectifications of highland society. From local lairds at home to external landowners in Edinburgh or London, the ideas combined intimate knowledge of Gaelic and rural society with rational science framed by advanced theorising on civil society. An example of how Improvement was applied in the first Victorian decade is the reconstruction of simple cottages at Abbeymains in the Lennoxlove Estate of Lord Blantyre, redeveloped in the 1840s under the watchful eye of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland. The old cottages consisted of one room of 20 feet by 15 feet; the beds were used as the divide from the kitchen and the pantry. The\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 26\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n27\n\nwalls were clay, the floor unplastered and there was no ceiling below the rafter board. The cottages had gardens behind, with dunghills and ruinous pigsties in front. The conversion turned the eight cottages into six larger ones with two new additions built. Outhouses were constructed for each cottage, and the windows were replaced with cast-iron frames. The rooms were provided with a mixture of wooden flooring and Caithness pavement. Ceilings were installed, the walls plastered and a fixed bed, shelving in the pantry, grates and sweys (to swing the kettle out from above the heat) added in the kitchen. The cost for improving the cottages was £233 12s 6d, with a further £84 12s spent on improving the associated offices. On average it cost £38 18s 9d to improve each cottage and £13 2s to provide an office for each (with each dwelling allowed a privy, coal-house, pigsty and ash-pit). The Society’s impetus for this investment came from criticism voiced in England about the condition of the Scottish peasantry. Stung by this rebuke from afar, the Highland Society offered premiums to reward the best-kept cottages and gardens, with their gold medal offered to the proprietor who erected on his estate the greatest number of approved cottages. Of particular concern were further reports received about the poor condition of workers’ accommodation in the bothies. So, in 1847 the Society offered for the first time its gold medal to whoever constructed the most approved farm steading on his estate for farm-servants. The aim was to encourage the habits of cleanliness and order, but also to better the health and comfort of the rural population through the improvement in the warmth, ventilation and drainage of the accommodation. The Earl of Rosebery, who had more than once addressed the Society on the importance of representing those who were unable to argue their own case, displayed special attention for these workers. Building new cottages would be the best answer, but Rosebery did not want the pace of change to be slowed, accepting that the cheaper option of renovation should be followed ‘to ensure this national problem is addressed’. While there was no profit to be made, it was ‘one of the most important duties to which a public\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 27\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n28\n\nourselves and others\n\nsociety could direct its attention’. The philosophy of agricultural improvement was also one of morals. The idealism and spirit of discovery, which had been present in its Enlightenment roots, were now transformed into characterisations of the industriousness and self-worth of the individual, a personification of race in the face of the imperatives of capitalism within peripheral and undercapitalised agriculture. This moral indignation focused with greatest hostility on the Gaels, and on the highland Celt more widely. BLIGHT AND FLIGHT\n\nIf there was to be one solution to the Malthusian darkness of a rural society increasingly unable to feed itself, then the introduction of the potato seemed to be the answer. Known for two centuries or more, the potato began to overtake oats as Scotland’s food staple from the late eighteenth century. The great advantage of the potato was that nutritionally it could sustain a denser population. Sir John Sinclair estimated that four times as many people could be supported by an acre of potatoes as by an acre of oats, and it was a crop more resilient to the mild and damp Scottish climate. The use of the potato also meant non-arable areas were now being inhabited where once they were empty, creating population spread but also dependence on the crop. Shocked by the unfolding disaster in Ireland, the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland sent out surveys to establish the extent of the potato blight in various parts of the country, both highland and lowland. In the autumn of 1846 the blight’s appearance was logged. It had first appeared ten years earlier in Argyll, but the spread and extent was now much greater, destroying nearly all of Scotland’s potato crop in only a few short weeks. It had been a long year of waiting to see if the catastrophe would be transferred from Ireland, and correspondents increasingly documented the unwelcome evidence. On 19 December 1846 John Hutchison of Monyruy, near Peterhead, recorded that unlike the previous year, ‘I cannot now hear of a single instance within many miles, where the potatoes have\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 28\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n29\n\nescaped’. Conscious efforts were made to defeat the disease, such as that of Thomas Aird, a weaver in the parish of Darvel, who sowed the seeds first in his garden hotbed before transplanting then into open ground; while the tubers grew to be as large as plums the blight came and the stems decayed. Some tried leaving their potatoes in the ground over the winter and ready for the spring, others dug their potatoes daily until the frost came, but no one in this part of Aberdeenshire escaped unscathed. The respondents were asked to comment on the weather, concluding that dry or sometimes very wet weather accompanied by humid conditions brought on the blight. The parish of Lanfine in Ayrshire found the blight to be particularly bad despite different varieties of potatoes and manures being tried; even with only slight evidence of disease these crops failed. Government officials led by Sir Edward Pine Coffin, church representatives and newspaper reporters commented back from the Highlands to the rest of Britain, and to the world, of the despair. In 1847 lowland aid was newly coordinated by the formation of the Central Board of Management for Highland Relief, coming together from the Edinburgh and Glasgow relief committees and that established by the Free Church of Scotland. Before the year was out, an unprecedented £210,000 was raised. Relief came in the form of seed and meal, with work given in exchange. In some parishes as much as three-quarters of the population was dependent on hand-outs to avoid starvation. Yet these were distributed unevenly and there was fear that the help either was too generous or was turning the Highlander into an indolent pauper, dependent (forever) on charity. Estimates of the number left hungry or starving by the potato blight suggest that around 200,000 Highlanders were affected. Contemporary claims of 300,000 going without food and halfstarving were explosive, but exaggerated. Proportionately few died from the consequences of the blight in Scotland compared to the devastation in Ireland. Outside of the six years of potato blight, Scotland was spared the kind of agricultural shortages that affected earlier periods, but price fluctuation was significant to livelihoods and the choice of food upon the kitchen table.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 29\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n30\n\nourselves and others\n\nThe costs of the relief on the landowner were also noticeable, with some selling off land to raise capital and others using what funds they had left to assist in the emigration of their tenants. In the estimate of population historian Michael Flinn and his colleagues, 9,000 more emigrants left Scottish ports in 1847–9 compared to the departures recorded in the three years before famine struck. Yet there was no immediate abandonment of the Highlands, with preference first for internal movement. In most cases of western and island depopulation – ranging from 12 per cent in South Uist to 21 per cent in Barra and 23 per cent in Coll – much was already in progress before the blight took hold. The parishes of Inverness-shire and Sutherland in the east, and the towns of Dingwall, Tain and Stornoway, increased in population between 1841 and 1851. It is suggestive that emigrant flight during blight was not coterminous when accounting for the 60,000 highland Scots who were displaced in the period 1841–61. Only after the Emigration Act 1851 was there government finance to help with the cost of passage for those otherwise held in place by the debt of rent arrears. Newspaper coverage of the potato famine would frequently summon up the spectre of race rather than God’s will to explain the destitution. Seeing idleness all around, Highlanders were reported to be refusing to work for what seemed a fair wage. To those outsiders who travelled to see the effects of the blight at first hand, it was the Highlanders’ living conditions that appalled most: ‘it is a fact that morally and intellectually they are an inferior race to the Lowland Saxon,’ reported The Scotsman in January 1847. OWNING SCOTLAND\n\nOne fall-out of the potato blight, exacerbated by the famine in Ireland, was that it confirmed to some observers that the Celtic races no longer had a place in society, at least not a productive one. Once economically ‘of the land’, the Celt was objectified into an older Scotland, one confined to the nation’s past. No longer modern, the Celt and the Highlands were objectified\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 30\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n31\n\nthrough cultural consumption: as landscape to visit, to hunt, to improve and to contrast in painted image, song and social investigation. For all these changes to society, and the propensity of highland Scots to temporarily relocate in lowland Scotland or to emigrate, big landowners remained dominant in the late nineteenth century. In 1872, 93 per cent of Scotland was held in estates of more than 1,000 acres, in contrast to 78 per cent in Ireland, 61 per cent in Wales and 56 per cent in England. At this time, four out of the top ten great British landowners were Scottish – the Dukes of Buccleuch, Bute, Sutherland and Hamilton – and nine of the top twenty-nine had Scottish estates. The 1,500 largest landowners controlled 90 per cent of Scotland; it was a dominance that had dropped only marginally thirty years later. Land reform against the landed classes was a feature of late-nineteenth-century Ireland and Scotland, most acutely in the crofting areas of the north-west, whereas rural England was not similarly challenged. This economic domination was reflected in political control at the local level. In 1892 two-thirds of the thirty-three conveners of Scottish county councils were landowners, of whom seven were peers and five were also lord lieutenants. We owned Scotland’s land, and others owned Scotland’s land too, but most of us owned nothing or very little. There is interest in examining any of Scotland’s counties in some detail, but for its royal connections focus here falls on Aberdeenshire, including what became known as Royal Deeside, where there were 4,489 landowners recorded in the return. There were 869 people named as owning one acre or more, totalling 1,252,100 acres at a combined value of £768,791 4s. Ten estates were over 20,000 acres in size and these landowners controlled 561,498 acres, or just under 45 per cent of Aberdeenshire (see Table 1.3). Opposition between the ‘have much’ and the ‘have little’ manifests itself in religious divisions and class antagonism alongside more everyday concerns of underwork, poverty and migration. The one major legislative attempt to redress some of the iniquities for the very poorest came with the Crofter’s Holding\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 31\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nourselves and others\n\n32\n\nTable 1.3 Distribution of land ownership over 20,000 acres, Aberdeenshire, 1872–3 Acres 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\n\nTrustees of the Earl of Fife, Duff House, 139,829 Banffshire Colonel J.

The crofter’s plight drew contemporary comment of Parliamentarians, too. It was one of the few Scottish issues, along with the Disruption in the Church of Scotland (1843), that garnered significant attention in the Westminster chamber. Both were insular debates, yet because of the nation’s interrelationship with its near neighbours, each was driven by the concerns of the shared Parliament. Because the newspaper editors of Edinburgh and Glasgow were at times reluctant to provide a sympathetic interpretation of tenant poverty in the Highlands, it left a gap for John Murdoch to fill with the establishment of the Highlander in 1873, promoting a strong highland economy and culture from within the region, and informing supporters in the central belt towns and cities of the issues at hand. The influence of the press was behind the land agitation of the 1870s when both the Highlander and the writings of Free Church minister John MacMillan criticised the actions of Aberdeen paper mill owner [and later MP] A. C. Pirie in 1879 for forcing his tenants to\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 32\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n33\n\nwork on his estate or face eviction. It led to warnings that unless reform was forthcoming, then troubles akin to the situation in Ireland would arise. Greater concern came along with shock and disbelief at the severity of reaction in what became known as the Land Wars of the 1880s. Memories of the Sutherland Clearances between 1807 and 1821 were the backdrop to highland anger towards any forcible efforts to move people from their homes. The Battle of the Braes in Skye in 1882, when the crofters asserted their ‘historic right’ to graze their animals on land owned by Lord MacDonald and used for his own sheep, was reported throughout Britain. With the tenants refusing to pay rent if access continued to be denied, and soldiers dispatched from Glasgow to quell the ‘troublemakers’ – leading to crofters being beaten and prisoners taken to Portree – the right to own land was an issue for both local and national government. The Royal Commission of Inquiry established to consider this agitation published its report in 1884. The Commission was accused of being landlord dominated, but still much evidence came from factors and crofter leaders. The outcome, the Crofters’ Holdings (Scotland) Act, received Parliamentary assent in June 1886. As a philosophical reflection on the moral right to own land, the legislation was a dramatic change in the law, taking from the landowner and giving to the crofter the heritable right to the land. But in reflecting the historical narrative of ‘being Scotland’, it was less unexpected because it fitted the experience of improvements to crop and animal husbandry, attempts to improve the rural house and home, and a pattern of land ownership that remained the most concentrated in Europe despite the imperatives of the modern age. THE CELT FROM TEMPORAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE\n\nIn the examples of housing improvement, blight and land reform, contemporaries framed the socio-economic and political influence of ‘the Celt’ within a particular objectification of\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 33\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n34\n\nourselves and others\n\nthe Highlands. This came from various directions, for good and ill, and kept the Improvement philosophy at its core. Whether it be to advance living conditions and diet, agriculture and industrial output, or belated land reform at the century’s end, the cultural objectification of the Celt and the highland region was built on economic and philosophical changes premised on an interpretation of what a successful highland society would look like. Throughout all this, respect for the highland soldier and Queen Victoria’s affection for Deeside ensured a place in popular and intellectual discourse for the ordinary Highlander that was more sympathetic than might otherwise have been the case. In the towns and the cities the Highlander was still thought of as an interloper and an economic threat when jobs were scarce, but when in the Highlands the Celt was simply exotic and peripheral. The Highlands, as a place, was no longer threatening to lowland constructions of self, and their land was now for leisure and sport, insufficient to sustain a viable society to the level it once did. To others, this history of economic hardship and (en)forced migration is evidence of an older society ending, irrespective of the stability in land ownership. The history of the land and its people supplied the evidence to feminise the Celt in comparison with masculine progress. Matthew Arnold’s On the Study of Celtic Literature (1867) describes the Celt as ‘sentimental’, ‘sensual’ and ‘ineffectual in politics’. Arnold saw truth in the ‘extravagance of chivalry’ in the Celt, who ‘has an affinity to [feminine idiosyncrasy]; he is not far from its secret’. Arnold associated the Celt with ‘magic naturalism’ and special charms and secret powers, producing a decidedly Ossianic definition, where English was the language of importance with Gaelic confined to antiquarianism. The feminised Celt as noble savage was ‘owned’ by masculine Britain. The feminisation of the Celt was reinforced in affinity with ‘shared’ societies. The encounter of Scottish Highlanders with colonisers paralleled the experience of North American Indians. Both were oral cultures based on myth, kinship and natural resources; each lay in shadow from a core civilisation. Kin-\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 34\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nBeing Scotland\n\n35\n\nbased communities, a distinctive clothing that signalled ‘savage’ against the refinery and fashions of the urban world, they were peoples subjected to pacification. Scholars make the argument that the masculine core of England/Britain ‘oppressed’ both the Celt and the Native American, undermining, appropriating and adapting their symbols as and when needed. In each case ‘nature’ was used to classify the everyday life of ordinary people in ways that made sense to contemporaries at a distance. In this context, and with a widespread cultural resonance that continued throughout the century, the lines of Scott’s The Lay of the Last Minstrel encompassed the objectification of the nation and its people through ‘the land’: O Caledonia! stern and, wild, Meet nurse for a poetic child! Land of brown heath and shaggy wood Land of the mountain and the flood, Land of my sires! what mortal hand Can e’er untie the filial band, That knits me to thy rugged strand!\n\nThat the character of the Scot was formed in relation to the nation’s soil, and the Celt was believed closer to nature – as Arnold’s theories were followed and given currency by the likes of Beddoe and Cleghorn – then ‘being Scotland’ flowed out of the natural environment. To investigate this further, our eyes gaze upwards to the clouds in the sky and to the nation’s weather.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 35\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n2 Weather Scotland Will\n\nOne part of Scotland’s identity never constrained by national boundaries is the weather: it always comes second hand. Lying along the northern 55th parallel, Glasgow and Edinburgh are on the same latitude as Moscow and Copenhagen to the east, Quebec and Alaska to the west. The Gulf Stream hits the nation’s west coat with warm but moist air from the Gulf of Mexico; in chilly contrast blasts from the north polar continent spread cooler but drying air to the east coast. For most months in the year, Scotland is the wettest and the cloudiest part of Britain, and it can be windy, too: the Hebrides and Shetland experience on average thirty-five and forty-two days respectively of gales each year. Even though it is a narrow country, Scotland’s coast is sunnier than its interior, with the highest average sunshine recorded each year in Moray and the Outer Hebrides at around 1,300 hours (although Shetland measures only around 1,100 hours). And while the northernmost parts of Scotland can average four hours more daylight than London during the height of the summer, on average Scotland’s crops are warmed less by the sun than in the farms of England, with the southern coast of Britain benefiting from over 1,750 hours of sunshine on average each year. Throughout the 1832 to 1914 period, the number of hours of daylight affected not just agricultural and other work outdoors, but spinning and craft, leisure and everyday life in the home. Heavy rain, wind, hail and frost impacted the farmer as it did the builder, the fisherman and the groundsman. It meant\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 36\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nWeather Scotland Will\n\n37\n\nthe working day would be variable even when disciplined by the clock or the machine. Nor did the move from sail to steam power free the trader from the elements. Rough seas and fog remained variables in the delivery times of coastal steamers and for transatlantic cargoes alike. It was not controversial for the Enlightenment thinkers David Hume and Adam Ferguson to argue that Europe’s temperate climate was one reason behind that region’s lead in the path of civilisation. Doubt, however, remained for their contemporary John Miller that the national characteristics of the Scots, the English and the Irish could be explained by weather patterns that, to him at least, seemed too similar to be of great influence. And while the seasonal changes in daylight and in wind, rain and sun were associated with Scottish national characteristics ranging from a dour demeanour that matched the clouds above, the development of muscle and sinew from long summer evenings of athletic activity or a heavy use of alcohol once the sun set early in winter, the nation’s climate remained embedded in worldwide weather patterns. The weather of others affected our weather, yet contemporary Scots were at first sceptical that outsiders could offer insight into their national climate. For many, still the best guess to the seasonal changes the weather would bring for the farmer or seafarer was to follow rhymes and prognostics passed down through experience and the trained eye, to trust indigenous knowledge. Even after British national weather forecasts came to Scottish newspapers in 1862, the use of science to describe, let alone predict, the weather was not always adjudged an improvement upon local knowledge. A story recalled by one critic told of a visit to Perthshire by the celebrated naval captain Sir Sidney Smith (1764–1840), who upon being complimented on his abilities as a seaman to predict the weather, replied, ‘I can do nothing among your mountains; but set me afloat in a known sea, with a barometer before me, and I will give you a rough guess of what you may expect’. He could do this, he insisted, because whenever he was posted somewhere new, he would make a point of asking the local fishermen for their signs and observations on the weather, never finding\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 37\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nourselves and others\n\n38\n\nthem wrong. The Rev. David Esdaile, a Presbyterian minister from Forfar and scientific sceptic whose story this was, insisted that weather prognostics by fishermen, sailors and shepherds, without any pretension of science, should not be mocked: the scientists should instead read Addison’s Barometri Descriptio, and ‘let them not despise the empirical knowledge of the unlearned, handed down from the days of old and trusted in because it was founded on experience’. Writing in 1867, the Presbyterian minister Alexander McLeod insisted the purpose of using science to predict the weather was not to discover the secular truth, but rather ‘the entire subordination of all these to His control’. Some prognostics could be readily proven to convince Scots that the observations of their parents and grandparents remained of value in this age of technological modernity: ‘If the first day of Januarie happen to be Fridaye, then shall the winter be very cold and dry, the spring boysterous and wette then drye . . .’ Tested in 1864, it was found to be true. And similar unattributed prognostics were repeated throughout the century. Spring, for the farmer, was the crucial period for sowing: Nae hurray wi’ your corns, Nae hurray wi’ your harrows; Snaw lies ahint the dyke, Mair may come and fill the furrows.\n\nThe farmer and sailor alike were keen to know what kind of winter they would endure: If Candlemas-day be dry and fair, The half o’ winter’s to come and mair: If Candlemas be wet and foul, The half o’ winter’s gane at Yule\n\nCirrus clouds, known as mare’s tails, were thought to indicate wind to the seafarer: Mackerel’s scales and mare’s tails Make lofty ships carry low sales\n\nAnimals, too, were predictors of the weather in many parts of Scotland. Swine carry straw in their mouths before a storm; cats\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 38\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nWeather Scotland Will\n\n39\n\nscratch a post or wall before wind, wash their face before a thaw and sit with their backs to the a fire before snow. Humans, of course, developed their own weather sense, being more likely to feel pain or rheumatism before a change from dry to wet weather or from mild to cold weather; listlessness or unease were often felt before a storm. When milk suddenly and unexpectedly went sour, then a thunderstorm was said to be at hand. Some of these predictions had implications for the nation’s health: ‘a green Yule makes a fat Kirkyard’ came from the belief that frosty weather is healthier than damp weather. And there were a large number of popular prognoses regarding all manner of weather characteristics, confirming its importance to those working out of doors or at sea. A cloud on top of Sidlaw Hills is a sign of rain soon to come to the residents of Carmylie; when there is mist covering the summit of Bin Hill, rain is likely in Cullen; and a similar covering of the Paps of Jura indicates to the people of Kilcalmonell and Kilberry that wet weather is due. This was not so much a national preoccupation with the skies as a test of the value of science and its application in the parishes of Scotland. One correspondent to the Scottish Farmer in 1863 explained that although popular prognostics were rarely valid for more than the next twenty-four hours, natural signs of old differed little from those provided by Admiral FitzRoy ‘with all the meteorological science of the present day at his command’. FitzRoy, of whom we shall soon learn more, was mocked for offering predictions only one week in advance, whereas ‘the weather prophet’ Thomas Du Boulay, without state support, was sufficiently confident to predict the weather six months in advance simply by observing the vernal equinox. With both ‘exposed’, the old farmer was thought to know best, whether the prognostics were scientific or not. While it was almost uniformly believed that the weather followed God’s will, some were still prepared to bring earthly theories into the discussion. In 1867 the Rev. Charles Clouston, Minister of Sandwick near Stromness, President of the Orkney Natural History Society and honourable member of the Kirkwall Literary and Scientific Association, as well as a member of\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 39\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n40\n\nourselves and others\n\nmutual aid societies in Orkney and Glasgow, published a treatise on predicting Scotland’s weather. For this man of God there was no conflict of conscience in waiting for the Newton of meteorology to one day discover the laws by which the Almighty regulates the weather: ‘In the meantime, it must be pleasing to God, as well as beneficial to man, to throw light on any of these laws’. With his time maximised by the isolation of an Orcadian life, Clouston was able to combine his scientific training and observations with his ministerial and pastoral obligations. His analysis mixed scientific and religious reasoning, describing the circulation of warm air around the equator that heated up the ocean and led to rain falling on the more temperate regions as ‘beautifully illustrating the wisdom and beneficence of the Creator’. His principal instrument was the anemometer, used to record wind speed; government issued, it came by way of the meteorologist Admiral Robert FitzRoy. FitzRoy first made his reputation as the commander of the Beagle expedition served by a young scientific officer by the name of Charles Darwin from 1831 to 1836. After a chequered career that took him to an ill-fated governorship of New Zealand, he became in 1854 Britain’s first state meteorologist within the Board of Trade. Armed with his barometer and anemometer, Clouston offered the first published validation of popular prognostics that built upon the classificatory structure developed in Dr Arthur Mitchell’s ‘Popular weather prognostics of Scotland’ (1863). Through systematic observation and the recoding of air and water temperatures, he tested long-held beliefs such as river fog being a sign of frost or whether Fife coal miners were correct to suggest that before a storm a sound like a bagpipe or the buzz of a bee would come from the rocks and minerals, and that such sounds were significantly quieter before rain. Similar techniques, measuring water and gas pressure, were used to investigate whether an increased flow of water, and the issue of gases and foul air from underground crevices preceded approaching changes in the weather, a prognostic held by the miners of Midlothian.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 40\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nWeather Scotland Will\n\n41\n\nTHE WEATHER WORLD\n\nWhatever confidence there was in common knowledge, nascent international measurements and God’s will to predict its path, Scotland’s weather was wont to play tricks on any who thought it either indigenous to the nation or homogeneous in its effects. The meteorologist Alexander Buchan pointed out that in comparing Scotland’s mean temperature of August 1860 with the same month in 1864 an identical figure was found (54.4 degrees), but in 1860 the highest daily temperature was 60.8 degrees and in 1864 it was 62.5 degrees. The higher day temperature helped produce a bountiful harvest; the lower was the chief cause of a poor harvest. For such a small landmass, but a coastal one in the path of significant wind flows, the weather had a profound effect on staples and luxuries alike. The air temperature, compared to the sea temperature, was three degrees higher around the coast of the Orkney Islands than in the south of Scotland. The Scottish Meteorological Society [SMS] found that the average rainfall in the west of Scotland over a six-year period mid-century was 47.38 inches, whereas it was 29.29 inches in the east. In a further striking example of such disparities, Charles Roberts recorded in his Naturalist’s Diary that even though the west coast of Skye and the Laigh o’ Moray are on the same latitude and only seventy or eighty miles apart, with an average temperature difference of two degrees, in Skye the rainfall can be 100 inches or more per year, but in the Laigh o’ Moray it is only twenty-six inches. In the drier parish, with bright sunshine, cereals grow well, but not so in Skye. The sun’s radiation at 1,000 feet or more can ripen peaches in Fallon in Aberdeen whereas in the south of Scotland it is insufficient to do likewise. Scotland’s weather knew no national boundary; that much is clear. Similarly the regular movement of goods and people by sea was linked to wide meteorological conditions, beyond Empire to all the world’s trade routes. Scotland’s seafarers required knowledge of favourable wind and current, and as the growth of global capitalism demanded regular and timely\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 41\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n42\n\nourselves and others\n\nmovement of goods, so science was called upon to benefit the safety of crew, cargo and profits. In 1853, the US Navy admiral Matthew Fontaine Maury visited Britain with a plan to raise public support for an international collaboration to document worldwide meteorological readings. Although he was cautiously welcomed at first, doors eventually opened once the generous funding he received from the US government became known, enough for a staff of ten or twenty. Maury was the leading international meteorologist, his personal drive flowing from a desire to understand the nature of storms and ‘establish God’s pathways through the sea’. Around 1,000 US vessels had been using a standardised reporting form since 1851 and the first international maritime conference to agree a uniform system of meteorological observations taken at sea was held in Brussels in August 1853. Support for international measurement had come from the governments of Sweden and Norway and, in anticipation, the British government had instructed the Royal Navy to record the kinds of meteorological data already being collated by its US counterpart. In addition to locational information, delegates agreed to record the direction and velocity of currents, the form and direction of clouds, the quantity of rain, the direction and force of wind, and the temperature and density of water at the surface and at various depths. The use of standardised forms replaced reliance on ships’ logbooks and meteorological atlases and began the process still in place today of the systematic collection of meteorological and oceanographic data for better guiding ship movements. Upon receiving the report from Brussels, government civil servants wrote to the Royal Society with a series of requests that led to the establishment of a meteorological office in London in 1854 as part of the Board of Trade. Concurrent with these developments, debate on the merits of scientific over culturally formed measurements continued within Scotland. When the Marquis of Tweeddale lectured the SMS in 1860 that old customs remained best, he did so with the hope of being proved wrong. The Society had formed five years earlier from 200\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 42\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nWeather Scotland Will\n\n43\n\nsubscribers each putting in £200, with Tweeddale its first chairman. Simply by watching the sky, the ennobled amateur meteorologist later pointed out, a number of shepherds were able to predict the dramatic snowstorm of 1861: why should this be, he wondered. Tweeddale had offered two essay-writing prizes of £20 to the Society, then meeting in the Museum Hall of the Highland and Agricultural Society. One of those was for the best essay on rainfall (achieving five entries and won by Thomas F. Jamieson of Ellon in Aberdeenshire); the other for the best essay on the optimum crops for Scotland’s weather conditions (which had no claim upon it, despite the belief it would appeal to Scotland’s tenant farmers). In the spirit of discovery, the SMS was keen to acquire and test out new measuring equipment. With the increase in the interchange of meteorological information between the European nations, lighthouse engineer Thomas Stevenson reported on the six stations around Great Britain and Ireland feeding information into the Board of Trade and, at the request of the mathematician and astronomer Urbain Leverrier, to Paris also. Believing somewhat optimistically that Scotland’s trade and extensive fishing fleet would gain to an extent greater than any other country in the world – ‘if only the appearance of storms could be telegraphed a day or even a few hours in advance’ – the SMS promoted the international free trade of information as a competitive advantage for the nation. The data collected was sent to Edinburgh’s Royal Observatory for analysis before the summaries were passed to the Registrar General for Scotland. Charles Piazzi Smyth was Scotland’s Astronomer Royal in these years. Born in Italy in 1819, he was the son of London-born Admiral William Henry Smyth and great-grandson of Captain John Smith (1580?–1631). Through his sister’s marriage, he became uncle of the hero of Mafeking and scout leader Robert, Lord Baden-Powell. Admiral Smyth was an amateur astronomer and Charles gained his exotic middle name from his godfather, the Sicilian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, later taking it as his forename. Smyth was educated in England and trained at the Royal Observatory at Cape Hope in South Africa. Observing\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 43\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n44\n\nourselves and others\n\nHalley’s Comet in 1835, along with Sir John Herschel he produced watercolours of this ‘extraordinary phenomenon’. Smyth took up the position of Astronomer Royal for Scotland and Regius Professor of Astronomy at Edinburgh University in 1846. The work was arduous, the pay low and the office underfunded. He came to rely on his Scottish-born wife Jessie Duncan as his assistant, finding greater success observing the night sky over Tenerife in the Canary Islands than Calton Hill in Edinburgh and publishing the first known book on astronomy containing stereo-photographs in 1858. That expedition had been helped by a grant of £500 from the Admiralty and the use of the 140-ton yacht Titania from Robert Stephenson, MP and son of the engineer George Stephenson, for the duration of the expedition. Piazzi Smyth was a pioneer in the technique of placing telescopes at high altitudes. His photographic experiments had in 1843 produced the oldest known calotypes of indigenous peoples in southern Africa. By his own invention in 1852, he introduced the means to signal the time from the observatory on Calton Hill using a time-ball. Edinburgh’s one o’clock gun was added to this service in 1861 and he worked with the local clockmakers James Ritchie & Son to ensure that the citizens of the city would always have a means of telling the time, a system he then spread to Dundee. Smyth’s Astronomical Observations made at the Royal Observatory, Edinburgh (1863) was widely acclaimed, while his work on spectroscopy, the precursor of astrophysics, was recognised with a moon crater named after him. Smyth’s analysis of Scotland’s weather was dependent on the daily information he received from the SMS. By 1857 the Society had established thirty-six measuring stations although some counties were still not covered and the Society found elusive the financial support it needed to fill the gaps. In 1858 J. F. Macfarlan petitioned the Chamber of Commerce in Edinburgh to memorialise the government for a grant on the Society’s behalf, receiving the city’s unanimous support. It was now, after three years of subscriptions, that these amateur\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 44\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\nWeather Scotland Will\n\n45\n\nmeteorologists pondered closure. If that happened, the Society feared, ‘in regard to meteorological observations, Scotland would be behind England’. There was an element of national pride as well as stubbornness in how they valued work that was often painstaking, declaring confidently that if Scotland were to lag behind its southern neighbour in the application of science to weather measurement and prognosticating, then their ‘countrymen would come forward to assist’. The stand-off was concluded when the Board of Trade offered to undertake the role of classifying, reducing and publishing the Society’s results (done by engaging Smyth in the task). The coverage of Scotland increased, with fifty-four reporting stations operating in the middle of 1860, sixty-five in 1861 and seventy-two the next year. The Society kept up a role as coordinators of the national measurement of the weather as well as exploring the scientific value of their methodology. By 1865 the SMS was estimated to be the largest and bestorganised meteorological society in Europe, tripling in size over the decade to almost 600 members. Beyond recording weather statistics for Scots, the Society was contributing to knowledge of Britain’s weather patterns for domestic and international use. Tweeddale gifted the SMS mementos and reports from the Council of India in 1862 and the Society sold over 200 copies of its quarterly reports in 1863, gaining the services of two volunteers in Syria to provide measurements from that region. The rise in membership indicated that meteorology was becoming popular and practical, no longer a mystery to society at large. A new medical department was added to look at the effects of climate on health and disease. One of its members took the practice of reading to the public schools – the Normal School [in Edinburgh], the Dollar Institution, Elgin Academy and Aberdeen Grammar School. To confirm its newly established credibility, His Royal Highness the Prince Alfred became an honorary member – two years before becoming Duke of Edinburgh, the title then revived by Queen Victoria – having had the occasion to visit the Society and examine its measuring instruments in 1864.\n\nMORTON PRINT.indd 45\n\n28/06/2012 09:40\n\n46\n\nourselves and others\n\nChallenges, however, remained. The Society struggled with its plans to establish a meteorological observatory at the summit of Ben Nevis, a point chosen to best record the direction of Scotland’s Atlantic storms. After a failed appeal to government, momentum fell upon the endeavours of the Englishman Clement Wragge who not only spent much time clambering around the mountain to take daily measurements, but headed an appeal for funds throughout Britain in 1883 which climaxed sufficiently to open the Thomas ‘Lighthouse’ Stevenson-designed building in October that year, which remained in operation until 1904. It was Wragge who began the trend of naming cyclones with people’s names and in 1886, having returned to Australia upon failing to secure the position of superintendent of the Ben Nevis observatory, he became a founding member of the Royal Meteorological Society of Australia. ‘IT’S NO RAINING’\n\nThe motivation for Tweeddale’s £20 prize in 1860 was his belief that the average rainfall in Scotland – as well as that of Western Europe more widely – was declining. From the evidence of twenty-two recording stations, Thomas Jamieson’s winning essay countered that the average was unchanged. But this conclusion was itself challenged by James Glaisher, founder member in 1850 of the Meteorological Society, who suggested the annual rainfall since 1815 was indeed on the decline. That his evidence came only from one recording station in London convin"
