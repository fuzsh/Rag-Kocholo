        "text": "Newnan - Nancy Schofield McArdle was born in Lawrence MA, on October 8, 1947, to John Joseph McArdle, Jr., M.D., and Nancy Burns McArdle. Nancy grew up in Andover, Massachusetts, graduating from The Pike School in 1961 and from Abbott Academy in 1965. She attended Hollins College in Roanoke, Virginia, where she was a member of the water ballet squad, and of the singing group the Accidentals. Nancy graduated from Hollins in 1969 with a degree in Biology.\n\nThree weeks after graduating from Hollins, Nancy married Frederic (\"Ricky\") Paine Worthen, Jr. After a Bermuda honeymoon, the couple moved to Virginia Beach, Virginia, for Ricky's tenure in the Naval Reserve. In 1970, Nancy and Ricky moved to a family farm in Granby, Connecticut. While Ricky pursued a degree at the University of Hartford, Nancy worked for Connecticut General. The couple relocated to Andover when Ricky began working for Worthen Industries. In 1973, the couple welcomed a son, Frederic (\"Eric\") Paine Worthen III. Three years later, Sarah (\"Cricket\") Mills Worthen was born, completing the family.\n\nIn 1978, Ricky's father proposed building a manufacturing facility in Newnan, Georgia and asked Ricky to run it. Nancy was elated over a move to the South, so a year later the \"Yankees\" arrived. Five years later, Theresa Pritchett came into the family's lives, helping Nancy run the household. For forty-one years, Theresa has been a cherished friend, caretaker, and honorary member of the family.\n\nEric and Cricket attended The Heritage School and Nancy served on the Heritage board for nine years serving as treasurer, fund-raising chair, and headmaster search committee chair. Her involvement in her children's school was her great pleasure. She played ALTA tennis during this time and was active in the Driftwood Garden Club, highlighting another great passion, gardening. During this period, she also became a successful personal representative for the Carlisle clothing line.\n\nLater in life, she became an ardent golfer, as well as serving on the board of the Newnan Country Club.\n\nTo say Nancy loved animals would be an understatement. She cared for a plethora of cats, dogs, and even a hog. They were indeed family to her.\n\nIn 2006, Cricket married John (\"Bubba\") Brewington Harter. With the arrival of Izzy in 2006 and Brew in 2008, Nancy became \"Lucy\" to her grandchildren, a name she always wanted to be called. She and Ricky enjoyed their roles as grandparents.\n\nTo discuss Nancy without note of her warrior spirit would be amiss. For almost 3 decades, Nancy battled cancer valiantly, rarely discussing her disease but fighting with intensity, even daring, until complications took her life on February 18, 2023.\n\nShe was preceded in death by her parents, Ricky's parents, her husband, and her two brothers-in-law Peter Worthen and Robert Worthen. Survivors include son Eric Worthen and his partner Tonya Chambers, daughter Cricket and her husband John Harter and their children Izzy and Brew, sister Susan McArdle and her husband David Koelle, M.D., brothers John McArdle and his wife Joan and Peter McArdle and his wife Cindy, sisters-in-law, Sally Van Worthen, Susan Benner Worthen, as well as Helen Worthen Berns and her husband Fred, brother-in-law, David Worthen and his wife, Gail, and numerous nieces and nephews.\n\nA memorial service and reception will be held at a later date. Memorials may be sent to Emory University Cancer Center (Winship Cancer Institute of Emory University, Development Office, 1762 Clifton Road, Suite 1400, Atlanta, GA 30322) or Sloan-Kettering in New York (Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, P.O. Box 5028, Hagerstown, MD 21741-5028). Condolences may be expressed to the family online at www.mckoon.com.\n\nMcKoon Funeral Home & Crematory 770-253-4580."
