        "text": "In three, so far, postings on the cottage ruins at Loughan an Lochan (Loughan Bay) we explored a former community above the Irish Sea with a view of Scotland. For the third posting I shared some research on the last cottage people of that site with the intent of additional postings.\n\nI wondered, “What motivates you to do this?” and remembered my mother’s Canadian passport in which, for place of birth “Proleek, Ireland” was written and my request to our cousin, John Mills, who invited us to stay with them after my mother passed away, June, 2013, the request being to visit the site of great grandfather James McCardle’s home, where grandfather Peter McCardle was raised, information since discovered from the Irish census.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, May 25, John took us from mass on a tour of sites related to the family. One of these was the site of the McCardle home, Proleek Townland.\n\nThere site is an anonymous corner on a unnamed street with no outlet. The street ends close to the Proleek Dolmen, an ancient passage tomb, after passing farms and fields.\n\nThe 1901 Irish Census provides these details from 116 years ago:\n\nThe walls were stone, brick or concrete.\n\nThe roof of thatch, wood or another perishable material.\n\nTwo rooms, with three windows facing the road.\n\nOut buildings listed were:\n\ncow house.\n\npiggery.\n\nToday, the site is another person’s property, it was not possible to explore further than when the camera lens reached when I leaned as far a possible into the brush. No sign of standing walls.\n\nModern homes surround the corner, solid and prosperous.\n\nFor this posting I collected the following images from Google Earth. The site is marked with a pushpin, “McCardle Home.” A “Proleek Dolmen” pushpin marks the passage tomb.\n\nA closer view suggests, if we trespassed and poked around, some remains of the structure were concealed by the trees and brush.\n\nBetween May 2014 and this image, from 2015, the center of the plot was gouged out. The area corresponds to the corresponds to the remains indicated in the 2013 image. From this we can understand were the structures stood in relation to the road.\n\nUsing the polygon ruler tool the size of the site is 413 feet in circumference, 9,619 square feet, and the gouge, indicating the ruins, is 1,368 square feet.\n\nBut for John and Betty Mills, their kind invitation to stay and John’s guidance that day, the “Proleek” notation on my mother’s Canadian passport would still be a mystery today.\n\nJohn Mills passed away the next year, September 26, 2015. Here are Hawthorne Blossoms from the corner of the former McCardle home in memory.\n\nHere is some follow-up to my story in the posting “A Visit to Proleek Dolmen.”\n\nHawthorne Blossoms\n\nCopyright 2024 Michael Stephen Wills All Rights Reserved"
