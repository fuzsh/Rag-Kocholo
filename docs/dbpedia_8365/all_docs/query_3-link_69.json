McArdle earned a bachelor’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1994, and a master’s degree from the University of Chicago in 2001.\n\nMcArdle blogged under the name Jane Galt at Asymmetrical Information:\n\nMcArdle has something of a contrarian streak. She’s the “black sheep” of her “rabid Democrat” family. She took her pseudonym from the Ayn Rand novel Atlas Shrugged, solely to irk a frequent commenter on a New York Times Internet forum who smeared anyone to the “right of Chairman Mao” as a “Randroid.”\n\nMcArdle authored the 2014 book The Up Side of Down: Why Failing Well Is the Key to Success.\n\nMcArdle is married to Peter Suderman (born September 30, 1981), who ran the blog alarm-alarm.com. Suderman writes for Reason and previously worked for National Review, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, FreedomWorks, Doublethink, and Culture11.\n\nMcArdle has described distress from being personally misgendered: “I’m 6-foot-2, tall enough that distracted store clerks often call me “sir,” a fact that caused me great distress as a young woman.”\n\nAnti-trans activism\n\nMcArdle has written a number of pieces about trans issues in the Washington Post. promoted and uplifted many voices from the anti-trans fringe, including Jesse Singal, J.K. Rowling, Hilary Cass, and Riittakerttu Kaltiala.\n\nReferences\n\nUrquhart, Evan (February 2, 2023). Megan McArdle Wants Child Abuse to Be Simple.
