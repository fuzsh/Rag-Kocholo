        "text": "Peter McArdle lives in Broadmeadow when he is not in some far-flung crisis point in the world. Picture: Phil Hearne\n\nNEWCASTLE Red Cross worker Peter McArdle has gone from burying Ebola-ridden bodies in Sierra Leone to engineering access to clean water for women giving birth in earthquake-shattered Nepal.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\n“Every disaster has its own specific challenges,” said the Newcastle engineer, who has recently returned from his latest deployment, in the hilltop town of Chautara, 50 kilometres east of Kathmandu.\n\n“Earthquakes damage tanks and pipes and it is often about access or storage of water, and that can lead to contamination.”\n\nEnsuring clean water was available for the births of the 56 babies born in a Red Cross field hospital since the April 25 quake was one of his responsibilities.\n\nMr McArdle was seconded to Norwegian Red Cross to oversee water and sanitation at a field hospital that served tens of thousands of people in the wake of the 7.8-magnitude quake.\n\nNewcastle Aid worker Peter McArdle in Nepal. Mr McArdle had to help keep the water clean at a field hospital for women in labour.\n\nKeeping the maternity and operating theatres clean and dry was a challenge as monsoon rains fell on the hospital tents set up on a soccer field.\n\nAt one point a landslide, triggered by the rains, blocked the hospital’s water supply.\n\nBut the aid worker, who lives in Broadmeadow when he is not on assignment, said Nepal needed more than just water and shelter.\n\n“There’s also things like psychosocial support ... there’s a social impact of an event like this that needs a lot of attention,” he said.\n\nWhen he left Nepal, 4 months after the first quake stuck, hundreds of people were still living in tents across the road from the Red Cross facility.\n\nThe Newcastle water and sanitation specialist was also commissioned to set up infrastructure to move the field hospital to the site of the former local hospital.\n\nNewcastle Aid worker Peter McArdle in Nepal. Mr McArdle had to help keep the water clean at a field hospital for women in labour.\n\nBut patients will essentially move from one tent city to another.\n\n“It’s the reality that rebuilding just takes a really long time. When there are so many people affected, you have to do what you can to support people in the interim,” Mr McArdle said.\n\nHe said this time round he was struck by how positive the people were.\n\n“I was really taken by the positivity of the people,” he said. “It would be completely understandable for people to be completely struggling, but I was so impressed with the way they go about recovering and getting their communities back on their feet.”\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
