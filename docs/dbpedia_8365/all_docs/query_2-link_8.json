He paints seven days a week, starting as early as 4am. He has chosen to distance himself from city \"as a kind of sabbatical\" in order to focus on painting. There are cows and sheep outside the kitchen window - because of which he ended up in casualty with Campylobacter. His studio is on the third floor of the farmhouse.\n\nWorking method\n\n\"I always paint with oil on canvas, which I prime and sand several times with gesso for a smooth surface. I sketch out in pencil and use a 000 (cat's whisker) sable brush to refine and define the sketch. Then I underpaint with burnt umber and glaze on top of that several weeks later - up to seventeen glazes. Paintings take six to nine months as an average. Usually a painting changes drastically in the last three or four months. At the final stage I reject around a third of the paintings.\"\n\n\"On a Theme of Annunciation\" painting\n\n\"It's probably a lot to do with being brought up as a Roman Catholic, and a transitional moment in my life. Every Saturday night I went to confession. One day my father asked the priest to tell him his own sins. The priest clammed up and my father walked out of confession.. After that we left the church. Years later I went to Venice for a few weeks and I was confronted by all this religious imagery which brought back all the guilt. I was inspired by a Titian painting with a sexual element and also wanted to paint a contemporary annunciation. These things fused. It gets a bit more complex after that. The gun is symbolic of penetration yet also of protection. I expect the viewer to work hard. You need a certain understanding of history.\"\n\nWeb site\n\nwww.peter-mcarle.com"
