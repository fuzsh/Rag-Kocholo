Ddeing the early years of the College Library each library-keeper or librarian held the office for a short time only, usually while he was preparing to enter the Christian ministry. Although no one librarian, during his short period of service, could exert a very large measure of influence upon the administration of the institution under his charge, the Library for generations kept its position as the most useful and important store-house of knowledge on the continent. It is believed, therefore, that the Harvard graduates who thus shaped its destinies for so many years have a claim to grateful remembrance for this service as well as for their honorable labors in after years. Of the sixty men whose lives are recorded here only five — Shapleigh, Cogswell, Peirce, T. W. Harris, and Sibley — can be said to have made librarianship their pro- fession. Of the others twenty-nine, or over half, became clergymen ; seven were teachers ; six entered the legal and three the medical profession ; and the remaining ten followed various pursuits. The average term of office for the whole period is three and a half years; but for the first century (1667-1767) the average was not quite two and one third years. The principle sources for the history of the Library may be here summarized. The earlier history is to be found in the manuscript Records of the Corporation and of the Board of Overseers, which contain frequent notices of the Library and of the appoint- ments of Librarians; lists of books given; codes of laws for its administration, and amendments thereto ; and other matters of importance. The Treasurer's books and the books of letters, especially those from Thomas Hollis, also contain much of value. The Library's own manuscript records date back only to the fire of 1764; and, indeed, prior to Mr. Sibley's day, they are scanty and unsystematic. There is a MS. catalogue, not dated, but probably prepared about 1780 or 1790, which contains the names of the givers of books then in the Library. For Sibley's own administration his manu- script Library Journal, containing, besides his annual reports, a detailed record of events, is invaluable. This and his letter-books are preserved in the College Archives. The printed sources mainly deal with the later periods of the Library's history, although the histories of Harvard by Quincy, Peirce, and Eliot, have more or less matter per- taining to it in earlier times. Lists of the books bequeathed by John Harvard, by Peter Bulkley, and Sir Richard Bellingham, were printed in Mr. Andrew McFarland Davis's mtes on the records of Harvard College (Bibliographical Contributions, no. 27). Mr. Sibley's chapter on Gore Hall and the College Library contributed to the Harvard book PREFACE. (1875, V. i. pp. 112-121) sketches the history of the Library. Dr. George Birkbeck Hill in his Harvard College by an Oxonian (1894) devotes a chapter (pp. 285-296) to an historical and descriptive account. Bush's Higher education in Massachusetts, issued by the Bureau of Education in 1891, also has some references to the Harvard Library. The report on Public libraries in the United States, published by the same Bureau in 1876, has two accounts (pp. 21-26, 78-95). The several printed catalogues, issued in 1723, 1773, 1790, and 1830-34, of which detailed mention is made under the various Librarians who prepared them, throw light on its composition at their respective dates. The Annual Reports of the Presidents of Harvard College (1826-1896) contain sum- maries of the conditions and needs of the Library, and since 1877 include a separate report by the Librarian. The committees appointed by the Board of Overseers to visit the Library generally printed their reports between 1854 and 1864. These were usually accompanied by the Librarian's report and by other documents ; that for 1864 con- taining Mr. Abbot's Statement respecting the new catalogue (pp. 36-76). In 1833, President Quincy printed Considerations relating to the Library of Harvard University respectfully submitted to the Legislature of Massachusetts (8°. pp. 16) ; and in 1858 appeared a Report of the committee of the Association of the Alumni appointed to take into coyisideration the state of the College Library (8°. pp. 44), and this was followed the next year by an eight page Letter of the Librarian addressed to the same committee. The Library has issued the Harvard University Bulletin, in seven volumes, 1879-94, con- taining hsts of accessions, records of the Corporation, the necrology, bibliographical matter, and notes ; and fifty-one numbers of Bibliographical Contributions, partly re- printed from the Bulletin. The following magazine articles should be mentioned : Charles A. Cutter, Harvard College Library in the North American review, Oct. 1868 (cvii. 568-593), and the New catalogue of Harvard College Library, in the same, Jan. 1869 (cviii. 96-129) ; John Fiske, A librarian's ivork, in the Atlantic monthly, Oct. 1876 (xxxviii. 480-491), also reprinted in his Darwinism and other essays, 1879, etc. ; Kate V. Smith, A glance into the '■^Sumner alcove,\" Harvard Library, in Scribner's monthly, March, 1879 (xvii. 732-736) ; Charles Knowles Bolton, Harvard University Library, in the New England magazine, Dec. 1893, (n. s. ix. 433-449), also reprinted separately. This Ust indicates the chief material to be used in making a history of the Harvard College Library. It is hoped that the following records of the lives of Harvard's Librarians may also serve as a contribution towards that end. II^DEX OF LIBEAEIAl^S. Abbot, John Lovejoy Page 34 Moore, Jonathan ....

Bt ALFRED CLAGHORN POTTER and CHARLES KNOWLES BOLTON. i667-i672(?). Solomon Stoddard, the first Librarian of Harvard, was born in Boston near the end of September, 1643. His baptism is thus recorded 1 October, 1643, on the records of the First Church, \" Solomon of Anthony Stoddard aged about 4 days.'' His father was Anthony Stod- dard, a linen-draper, a representative to tlie Gen- eral Court, and for many years recorder of Boston. His mother, Mary Downing, was the first of Anthony Stoddard's five wives. Sibley, however, apparently following the News-Letter, says she was his second wife, and gives her name as Lucy ; but both the printed genealogies of the Stoddard family and Savage agree in giving her as the first wife and her name as Mary. Solomon Stoddard graduated from the College in 1662, and on taking his second degree in course three years later, sustained the affirmative on the question, \"TJtrum Deus puniat peccata necessitate naturas.\" In November of the next year, he was made a tutor, and the following spring, by vote of the Corporation, \" March. 27. 1667. M' Solomon Stod- dard was chosen Library keeper.\" This is the first record of the appointment of a Librarian at Har- vard. While the Library had been in existence since John Harvard's bequest, nearly thirty years before, it is not probable that previously the care of it had been entrusted to any distinct officer. A code of laws defining the duties of the Librarian and regulating the use of the books was now adopted and entered on the Corporation Records.* How long Stoddard retained the office is uncer- tain ; his successor was not appointed until 1674 ; but two years before that he had accepted , 7 Feb- ruary, 1672, a call to the church at Northampton, where, moreover, he seems to have already preached at least occasionally for some two years. * See Appendix I. As early as 4 March, 1670, the town had voted that they hoped to give him £100 annually, and a few days after this vote Stoddard married Esther, daughter of Rev. John Warham, and widow of Bleazar Mather, his predecessor in the Northampton pulpit. His ordination took place 11 September, 1672. He must, therefore, have left the Library as early as that year, and pro- bably he left a year or two earlier. In an obituary notice, reprinted by Colman from the News-Letter, it is stated that \"Growing out of Health by reason of too close an Application to his Studies he was prevail'd on to take a voyage to Barbados, with Governor Serle as his Chaplain, where he preach'd to the Dissenters on that Island. But his State of Health growing better, he return'd to his Native Country in about two Years.'' No date is assigned for Stoddard's resi- dence there, and it is difficult to fix any. Daniel Searle was governor of Barbados from 1653 to 1660; it could, then, hardly have been during his term of office. Searle lived in Boston for some years later, returning finally to his estates in Bar- bados in 1669. He may, perhaps, have visited the island for a year or so during this period, and Stoddard may have then accompanied him. The most probable time for the latter's stay there, which could not have lasted two full years, is between taking his A.M. in July, 1665, and his appointment as tutor in November, 1666. Mr. Stoddard's pastorate of nearly sixty years was distinguished by five revivals, or \" harvests,\" as he termed them, during which \"the bigger Part of the young People in the Town, seemed to be mainly concerned for their eternal Salvation.\" For some years he was the oldest minister in the province, and it was said of him that \"he pos- sessed, probably, more influence than any other clergyman for a period of thirty years.\" For a long time he regularly attended Commencement, 8 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. and the next day gave the annual \" Public Lecture.\" He continued to preach until shortly before his death, 11 February, 1728-29, at the age of 86. Two years earlier his grandson, Jona- than Edwards, had been installed as his assistant. Stoddard printed about twenty sermons and several other works, of whicli Sibley gives a full list. His book on the \"Safety of appearing at the Day of Judgement, in the righteousness of Christ,\" went through four editions (1687, 1729, 17i2, 1804). In a pamphlet published in London in 1700, under the title, \"The Doctrine of the instituted churches explained and proved from the word of God,\" he first promulgated what was long known as the Stoddardean doctrine. The main point of his views, that the communion table should be accessible to all persons not immoral, excited a long and bitter controversy. \" His Sermons were plain and powerful, experimental & spiritual, close & searching, yet rational & argumentative.\" Of his twelve or thirteen children may be men- tioned his son Anthony (H. U. 1697), minister at Woodbury, Conn. ; Colonel John (H. U. 1701), a man of considerable influence, and five daughters, all of whom married clergymen.

Samuel Seirall, the second Librarian of the College, was born 28 March, 1652, at Bishopstoke, Hampshire, England, second child of Henry and Jane (Dummer) Sewall. He studied at the gram- mar school at Rorasey until tlie family came to Ne%v England in 1661, where he continued his education under the Rev. Thomas Parker at New- bury. Hannah Hull, daughter of tlie wealthy master of the colonial mint, was present at Sewall's graduation from Harvard in 1671, and as he afterwards relates in his famous Diary, she lost her heart to him on that day. He was a tutor and fellow in 1673-1674, receiving his A.M. the same academic year. On 1 March, 1674, it was \"ordered by the Corporation that S\"' Sewall be from henceforth the Keeper of the Colledg Li- i rary.\" He held this ofllce only nine months. Sewall studied divinity, and preached for two hours and a half in Mr. Parker's church 4 April, 1675, being afraid to look at the hour-glass. But his marriage, 28 February, 1676, to the daughter of the mint-master, put him in possession of wealth and gave him special opportunity for usefulness in civic life. In 1681-1684 Sewall was manager of the print- ing-press in Boston. In 1684-1686 he held the office of assistant, and from 1692 to 1725 he was a member of the council. From 1692 to 1718 he was a judge of the superior court, and from 1718 to 1728 chief justice. During most of this period he was ex officio a member of the Board of Over- seers of the College. In 1692 Mr. Sewall was chosen one of the judges of a special court of Oyer and Terminer to try persons accused of witchcraft. Several of these were condemned to death, and he never ceased to regret the part he had taken in their destruction. In January, 1697, he gave Mr. Wil- lard, the minister of the Old South Church, a written confession of his sin, which was read aloud in the church while he stood with bowed head. „ , Of his fourteen children by his wife Hannah, Joseph was elected President of Harvard, but de- clined. The chief justice married 2d Abigail, daughter of Jacob Melyen and widow of William Tilley, 29 October, 1719, and 3d Mary, daughter of Henry Shrimpton and widow of Robert Gibbs, 29 March, 1722. He contributed to the church for \"praying Indians\" at Natick and built a meeting-house at Sandwich, besides giving generously to the Col- lege. His little pamphlet of three quarto pages, \"The selling of Joseph,\" published in 1700, de- nounced negro slavery, but brought upon him \"Frowns & hard words.\" Among his other pub- lications was \"Description of the New Heaven\" (1697). But he is to-day best remembered for his Diary, a minute record of his life for many years, that throws a clear light on the colony of those days. He has well been called \"the Pepys of New England.\" This was pubhshed by the Massachusetts Historical Society in three volumes (1878-82), and the same society a few years later issued his Letter-books in two volumes (1886-88). He was captain of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company in 1701, and for twenty-four years he set the tune at church and led the singing. He died at Bos- ton, 1 January, 1729-30. His must have been an impressive figure, as Whittier pictures him : Stately and slow, with thoughtful air. His black cap hiding his whitened hair, \"Walks the judge of the great assize, LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. As the weekly News-Letter truly said, he was \" worthy of very distinguishing regard in the New England histories.\" Adthokities : Samuel Sewall, Diary, (Mass. hist, soc, Collections, 6tli ser., t. vi. vii. 1878-82).

Daniel Gookin, the son of Major-General Daniel Gookin and his wife Mary, was born at Cambridge, 12 July, 1650. At the age of 19 he graduated at Harvard with the class of 1669 and proceeded to his degree of Master of Arts. In May, 1673, he \" was chosen probation\"^, & is forth- with to take y'^ charge of a Classis,\" and in the fall his fellowship was confirmed by the Corporation. He remained a tutor and resident fellow for eight years, meanwhile twice serving as Librarian. At a meeting of the Corporation, 11 December, 1674, it was \" Ordered further that hencforth Mr Daniell Gookin be Library keeper : And that he enquire of persons formerly [con]cerned for finding out & restoring the book[s] found wanting in the last surveigh ma[de] by the Praesidt: himself and Mr Sewal as in the Li- brary book.\" In August, 1676, there was \"paid m' Dan' Gookin, one of the Fellowes, money 50\" in Satisfaction for his paines in removing the library to the new CoUedge & placeing them.\" This was evidently extra work, for some months previously Daniel Allin had been appointed Li- brarian ; perhaps in the removal of the books to the first Harvard Hall, then only partially com- pleted, the new Librarian was glad to have the aid of his predecessor. Gookin, however, in June, 1679, was again \" chosen Librarie keeper.\" Two months later the account-books of the Col- lege have the entry, \" Paid to Jn° Palfrey 36s on the president's note for 1 doz. Stooles made for CoUedge Library.\" The following winter there is a record of payments of over £20 for freight on eleven boxes of books for the Library; probably these were the library of the English philo 0- gist and divine, Theophilus Gale, then recently bequeathed to the College. ^ u -^ In 1681, resigning his positions at Cambridge, Mr. Gookin began his services as a mmis ter^ He seems to have assisted the Ap«stle Wiot in hu work among the Indians at Natick, and is described by him as \" a pious and worthy young jjjj^n.\" In March, 1685, he was ordained pastor ot the church at Sherborn, with an annual salary of \"twenty pounds in money and twenty pounds in country pay.\" Here Mr. Gookin preached for many years, both to his parishioners and to the Indians, and here his death occurred, after a long illness, 8 January, 1717-18. William Rider of Natick wrote to the editor of the News -Letter as follows : \" The Reverend, learned and pious Mr. Daniel Gookin deceased, aged about 67 years : who in his younger Time was a Fellow of Har- vard College about the space of seven years ; and since has been an Ordained Minister in said Town about 34 years ; who many years preached the Indian Lectures at Natick; a Gentleman sound in his Doctrine, explaining the Scriptures to the weakest Capacity, and painfull in his Studies, tender of his Flock, and Exemplary in his Life, and Lamented of all Good Men that had Acquaint- ance with him, especially in his own Church and Town.\" And his friend Sewall notes in his Diary : \"He was a good Scholar, and a solid Divine. We were Fellows together at College, and have sung many a Tune in Consort ; hope shall sing Halle- lujah together in Heaven.\" Gookin married, first in 1681, Elizabeth, daugh- ter of Edmund Quincy, and second, in 1692, Bethia, daughter of Edward Collicott. Savage credits him with another wife, name unknown, whom he is said to have married in 1682, but this is more than doubtful. He had seven children. Daniel Gookin never published anything, but there exists a printed catalogue of his library, which was sold, together with that of Joshua Moody, in 1718.

John Allin, the first minister of Dedham, and his second wife, Catherine, widow of Samuel Hackburne and of Governor Thomas Dudley. Sibley and Savage give the date of his birth as 5 August, 1656, but the following entry made by his father in the records of the First Church at Dedham shows that the actual date was a week earlier : \" Daniell my sone being borne 31'' 5™ was baptised 3* 6\"\" 1656 \" ; and this date is confirmed by the Dedham town records. At college he was a scholar of the house, and not long after his graduation with the class of 1675, \" at a Meeting of ye Corporatio at Cambridge 11. 2. 76. [it was] Ordered that S' Allin be Librarie-keeper.\" He continued in that lO LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. position until 1679, meanwhile taking his second degree. His thesis on this occasion was on a medical subject, \"An hepar sanguifioet?\" and not long after he seems to have begun the practice of medicine in Boston or Charlestown. Sewall in his Diary refers to liim as a physician in Boston. The first of his six children by liis wife Mariana was born in June, 1680. Sibley states that he died in 1692, apparently on the authority of Sav- age and of Mann's Historical annals of Dedham. The latter says (p. 86) \"lie seems from his Will (Suffolk Prob. Rec.) to have died in December, 1692.\" But an examination of these records shows that while the will was drawn 17 November, 1692, and the codicil added five days later, it was not admitted to probate until 6 June, 1694. That this latter year is the real date of his death is confirmed by an entry in the diary of Lawrence Hammond of Charlestown under 7 May, 1694 : \" D' Daniel Allen, a true Lover of his Country & most Loyal to the Crown of England, Learned, Wise, Humble pious, most true to his friend, the approved, able and beloved physician &c. Sick- ned Saturday the 28\"\" day of April in y» night, and dyed this day being Munday, to the universall griefe of all good men who were acquainted with his worth.''

He was success- ful, it may be supposed, for Rev. Joshua Moody in 1683 wrote: \"The people like his preaching very well.\" Mr. Cotton was a Fellow from 1681 to 1G90, and a tutor from 1681 to 1685. In 1682, \"At a cor- poration meeting : Ordered that the double Books in the Colledge Library be prized & sold & y° money improved for the buying other books y' are wanting.\" The same year the general court voted fifty pounds to Mr. Andrews and Mr. Cotton, fel- lows, they \" hauing tooke much paynes & vsed much diligenc in carrying on the praeaideuts worke, since m' Oakes death.\" Rev. Increase Mather, acting president in 1685, had very little leisure from his duties in Boston to give to the college, and the money voted by the General Court that year for the president was to be applied by the Corporation \"for the encouragement of such as have done the work.\" A share of this money came to John Cotton, who had, no doubt, been restored to favor. A letter by him and an official communication upon which his name ap- pears— both relating to college business — have been preserved in the \" Mather papers.\" On August 17th, 1686, Mr. Cotton was married to Anne, daughter of Captain Thomas Lake of Boston. The next year he was invited to settle as pastor of his father's church at Hampton, but then and on later occasions declined. He con- tinued to preach at Hampton irregularly ; and for a time occupied the pulpit at Portsmouth during the absence of Mr. Moody, but refused to be settled there. After repeated solicitation Mr. Cotton accepted a call to the church in Hamp- ton, and was ordained 19 November, 1696. From a membership of twenty-five the church grew rapidly, until his labors were terminated by his sudden death, 27 March, 1710. His widow, the mother of his eight children, afterwards married Rev. Increase Mather. Sewall refers to the \"dreadful news\" of Mr. Cotton's death, and in speaking of him on the Lord's day following, gave him \" a very august character.\" Mr. Cotton published a wedding sermon in 1699. His qualities, as noted by contemporary writers, are very attractive, even allowing for the partiality of friends. He was said to be \" one who had very much of the Gentleman in him,\" catholic, schol- arly, hospitable, entertaining and sweet tempered. Authorities: Harvard Corporation Records. Mass. hist. soc.

Noah Newman of Rehoboth, and his wife, Joanna Flynt. Graduat- ing from Harvard in 1687, he began in the year in LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. I I which he took his second degree, his service of three years as Librarian. In September, 1691, there is an entry in the College records of £3 paid to him as \"Library-keeper.\" Later in the records (1694-95) are several references to his services in procuring \" the Colledge arms to be cut in Freestone or in marble \" ; but it is uncertain ■whether this plan, which seems to have originated with him, was finally carried out. About 1707 Newman went to England, where for a time he lived in the Duke of Somerset's family, — in what capacity we are not told. Afterwards we find him settled in the Inner Temple in Lon- don. Nearly half a. century before this time, Edward Hopkins had bequeathed a legacy to Har- vard College, but his heirs had disputed his will and it was still unsettled. In 1709 the College appointed Newman its agent toward procuring this bequest; and in three or four years his efforts were successful. In fact, during the whole of his life in England, Newman was active in furthering the interests of the College in that country, and procured for it many gifts both of money and of books. It is said by Turell, the biographer of Dr. Colman, that he \" saw cause to conform to the Established Church. — But he ever cherished and exprest a warm and generous Love and Regard for his Country, and the Churches and Colleges here, and sought their Prosperity and flourishing.\" As late as 1741, he was still the English agent of the College as appears from the following votes of the Corporation, passed 6 April, 1741 : \" That in Consideration of the many good Services done for the College by Henry Newman of London, Esq :, Mr. Treasurer be directed to give him a full Discharge, of whatsoever may be due from him to the College, upon his Book. That the Pres^' be desir'd to give the Thanks of the Corporation to Henry Newman of London, Esq., for the informa- tion he gives us by D' Colman of some Prospect there is, of our obtaining a part of the Library of S' Richard Gyles Bar. which he is about to bestow upon Dissenters, & pray him to continue his good Offices to the College, and particularly in that affair.\" . For many years Newman was the agent in Eng- land of New Hampshire. Governor Belcher was his warm personal friend, and many of the letters that passed between the two have been preserved and printed. Several others of Newman's letters have been printed : two or three to Colman, one to President Leverett, and another to his uncle. Tutor Flynt, well-known in the College history. His only other pubUcations were two Almanacs for 1690 and 1691, and a paper in the Lor.don Philosophical Transactions (xxxii. 33) on \"The way of proceeding in the small pox inoculated m New-England.\" The date of Henry Newman's death is not known. His name was starred in the Triennial Catalogue of 1745, but Sibley states that he was living as late as 1748. He was certainly dead in 1749, when Turell's book, mentioned above, was published.

He graduated at Harvard in 1691, held the positions of Librarian 1693-1697, of tutor 1697-1700, and of fellow from 1707 until his death, 13 February, 1717. On leaving the college he was ordained as colleague of the Rev. Samuel Willard of the Old South or Third Church, Boston, 28 August, 1700. He was married 12 June of the next year to Mary Clark, who survived him. Their son Ebenezer (H. IT. 1721) was one of the founders of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University). Mr. Pemberton's \"Sermons and Discourses on several occasions \" were printed in London in 1727, with a portrait of the author and a memorial sermon by the editor, Rev. Benjamin Colman. H\" had also previously printed a number of sepa- rate sermons. After his death a catalogue of his library to be sold by auction was issued by \"Samuel Gerrish, bookseller, near the Old Meeting-house.\" It consisted of 1000 lots, and is \"perhaps the first instance in New England of a printed catalogue of books at auction.\" Mr. Pemberton had a, high reputation as a preacher, and held his audience by his strong, masculine style, and the fervor of his delivery. \"He had,\" says Dr. Joseph Sewall in his funeral discourse, \" a great natural capacity, a large and comprehensive genius, and by hard study and great industry had amassed a rich treasure of learning.

His family had held an honorable position in Eng- 12 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. land before his ancestor, Sir Richard, settled at Watertown in New England. From the time of their setting foot in America each generation has been represented by a graduate of Harvard. Saltonstall took his first degree in 1695, followed by the master of arts degree. He was Librarian of the College in 1697-1701, and tutor in 1700-1702. The following from Judge Sewall's Diary refers to him : \" Dec' 26 [1728] Mr. Nathan' Saltonstall was at Lecture ; came in lately from England, with a very long and Cold passage.'' John Frizel of Boston, a benefactor of Harvard College, died in April, 1723. He was a merchant of wealth and influence, as we learn from Cotton Mather's funeral sermon. His gifts to churches and other institutions had won for him marks of gratitude from Glasgow and otlier cities and towns. He was one of the few men who kept a car- riage. Mr. Frizel had married Dorothy, daughter of Francis Parnel. His widow now became the wife of Mr. Saltonstall, reserving, however, the right to dispose of her own estate. In March, 1732: \"Nathan\" Salenstal Esq' Chose a Selectman in the Room of Thomas Lee, who Refused.\" The minutes of the Boston select- men for April 18th, 1733, have a vote \"that Mr Saltonstal be desired to agree with a Printer for Printing Two Hundred Advertisements relat- ing to the Inhabitants entertaining In-mates con- trary to the Law.\" His duties as a selectman during the year were numerous and varied, as shown by the records. Mrs. Saltonstall died 4 April, 1733, leaving by will, among many legacies, £200 to be distributed among the poor of the town, and the further sum of twenty pounds to buy Bibles and testaments \" for such poor children as their parents are not able to furnish them with.\" She bequeathed £300 to Harvard College, and \"unto my loving hus- band the sum of five hundred pounds.\" Nathaniel Saltonstall died very suddenly at Woburn, 23 June, 1739. He was, said the News- Letter, in announcing his death, \"a Gentleman well respected among us,\" and another writer said he had \"a high reputation for abilities and learning.\" Authorities: Boston — Record couimissionci's, Reports, 1885, xii. 39, xiii. 240.

Anthony Stoddard, the second of the eleven c '.lildreu of Simeon Stoddard and nephew of Solo- mon Stoddard, Harvard's first Librarian, was born in Boston 24 September, 1678. He graduated in 1697, received his A.M. in 1700, and the next year (1701-1702) acted as Librarian. Moving to Bos- ton, where he seems to have become a citizen of prominence, he held tlie following offices : justice of the peace, 1728-48 ; justice of inferior court of common pleas of Suffolk county, 1783-48 ; member of the council for the province, 1735-42. From his father, who died in 1730, a rich man for those days, he inherited considerable property. While in the council he served on several commit- tees appointed in connection with the Spanish war and the expedition against Carthagena in 1740. His death took place 11 March, 1748. His wife, Mar- tha, daughter of Andrew Belcher and sister of Governor Jonathan Belcher, had died just a month earlier. Of their three children, Simeon gradu- ated from Harvard in 1726, and was \"placed\" first in the class. There is a portrait of Anthony Stoddard in the possession of a descendant in New York.

Josiah Willard, the son of Samuel and his second wife, Eunice (Tyng) Willard, was born in Boston 21 June, 1681. His father was the pastor of the South Church in Boston and, from 1701 to 1707, vice-president of Harvard College. Josiah graduated in 1698, and received the degree of A.M. in 1701. During the next year he was Librarian and the three following years (1703- 1706) a tutor. He had studied for the ministry, but, \" on account of an unconquerable diffidence,\" gave up preaching. He then made several voyages to the West Indies and to England, and at one time was in command of a ship in the London trade. He married, 24 October, 1715, Katherine Allen of Boston. She died in 1725, and tl)e next year (7 April, 1726) he married Mrs. Hannah Clarke, who survived him. By these marriages he had ten children. In 1717, \"George I. exceedingly gratified and bless'd this Province, by appointing Him our Secretary.\" For nearly forty years AVillard filled this important position, and, says Prince in his funeral sermon, he was \" a bright and most amiable Example of Care, Diligence, Integrity, Publiek Spirit, AVisdom, Goodness and Gener- miflity *\" *''° p-reat Honour and Advantage, and LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 13 to the universal Pleasure of his Country.\" He was often spoken of as the \"good Secretary.\" He held two other public offices, — judge of pro- bate for the county of Suffolk, 1731-45, and member of the council for the province, 1734-56. While in the latter office he acted as Overseer of the College. He died 6 December, 1756, aged 76.

I7O3-I706. John liirhitmg, horn in Lynn, 20 January, 1681, was the sixth son of Rev. Joseph Whiting, by his first wife, Sarah, daughter of Thomas Danforth, deputy governor of Massachusetts. He graduated from Harvard in 1700, and after taking his A.M. degree was made Librarian. He kept this office for three years (1703-6). During the last year of his tutorship of five years (1707-1712) he was a fellow of the Corporation. In the fall of 1711 he was chosen minister at Concord. It is interesting to note that one of the two other candi- dates for this position was Edward Holyoke, then Lit)rarian and afterwards President of the Col- lege. He was ordained 14 May, 1712, receiving a settlement of £100 and an annual salary of the same amount. The latter, however, was increased by frequent additional grants. About the time that he went to Concord he mar- ried Mary, the daughter of Rev. John Cotton (Librarian, 1681-90). By this marriage he had eight children. His first wife died in 1731, and he married, second, Rebecca (Bulkley), widow of Dr. Jonathan Prescott, of Concord. He had no children by this second marriage. John Whiting served as pastor to the church in Concord for about twenty-six years. In 1788, as the result of the religious controversies which were at that time disrupting most New England parishes, he was obliged to leave his pulpit, but continued to preach to a few members of his old flock who seceded from the church with him. He died 4 May, 1752, at the age of 71. \" Mr. Whiting was one of the (then) old school, quiet, modest, gentle, and persuasive.\" \"He was a man of wealth, learning, influence, and talents.\" His epitaph tells us he was \" a gentleman of singular hospitality and generosity, who never detracted from the character of any man, and was a universal lover of mankind.\" AUTHOEITIES : Quincy, Jlist. of Harvard, 1840, i. 278-9.

He was admitted to the first church in Cambridge 6 January, 1707. Gore afterwards be- came a sea captain, and married Rebecca Smith, 12 May, 1713, but had no children. On a voyage from London, in the fall of 1720, the small-pox broke out on his ship. Several of the passengers and crew had died of it. On their arrival in Boston harbor Gore himself was not sick, but although in those days when small-pox was both more dreaded and less guarded against, there were no quarantine laws, he refused to land for fear of carrying the contagion. He remained on board his vessel and in a few days died of the disease, 12 November, 1720, aged 37. He \"was a Gentleman of very good parts; of great industry, knowledge, prudence, and cour- age ; He excelled in Philosophy and Mathematical learning; ... of strict, unaffected, rational and immovable Piety ; ingenious, free and chearful in conversation . one that seemed to be set as a rare example for all ship-commanders and sea- faring men to observe.\" Authorities : Cooper.

Nathaniel of Cambridge and his wife Hannah Savage, and nephew of Daniel Gookin, the third Librarian of Harvard, was born 15 April, 1687. Graduat- ing with the class of 1703, and receiving tlie master's degree in 1706, he was appointed Libra- rian the next year. Near the close of his service of two years, the Treasurer, 16 September, 1709, paid him £2 10s \" for his pains in taking a Cata- logue of y* Books in y» Library, about a year or two ago.\" This seems to be in addition to his regular salary of five or six pounds a year. 14 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGEl. While acting as Librarian, Gooldn occasionally preached from neighboring pulpits. Sewall in his Diary, under date of 5 December, 1708, has this characteristic entry concerning him: \"Mr. Na- thaniel Gookin preaches in the forenoon ; I think every time he mention'd James, 'twas with prefix- ing Saint : about 4 or 5 times that I took notice of. I suppose he did it to confront me and to assert his own Liberty. Probably, he had seen the Letter 1 wrote to Mr. Elint. Spake also of Reverence in God's Worship ; he may partly intend being cover'd in Sermon-Time : It had better becom'd a person of some Age and Authority to have intermeddled in things of such a nature. Qticedam Confidentia non est virtus, at audacia\" Early in the spring of 1710 the town of Hamp- ton, N. H. , voted \"that Mr. Nathaniel Gookin shall be called to the work of the ministry in the town.\" The terms proposed, however, do not appear to have been satisfactory to Gookin, and it was not until 15 November, 1710, that he was ordained as the pastor. Under the final terms, the town agreed to pay the new minister £70 per annum, one half to be in money and one half in produce, to give him the use of the parsonage dur- ing his ministry, and also twenty cords of wood a year ; moreover, when he should have a family, the £70 was to be increased to £80. In a little more than a month after his ordination he married (21 December) Dorothy Cotton, daughter of his predecessor in the pulpit at Hampton — John Cotton (Librarian, 1681-90). The increase of ten pounds which he was thus able to claim so soon could not have availed him much, for his family grew rapidly, and no less than fourteen children were the result of this marriage. Mr. Gookin's ministry was long and successful, and he greatly endeared himself to his people. In 1719, after the erection of a, new meeting house, the town voted to sell the old one \" for the use & benefitt of y\" Rever* Mr. Nattf Gookin.\" The town also paid for the education of his son Na- thaniel at Harvard (A.B. 1731) ; and after the death of their pastor amply provided for his widow during her life. The only matter of especial interest during his pastorate is perhaps his sermon preached on the afternoon preceding the great earthquake of October, 1727. For his text he took the words: \"The day of trouble is near,\" and in his discourse said he felt a strong foreboding of some evil close at hand. It was but a few hours later that the shock of the earthquake was felt. From this incident Mr. Gookin, although disclaiming any such power, almost attained the reputation of being a prophet ; at all events there followed upon this a great religious awakening in his church. This sermon, together with three others preached after the earthquake, \"and an account of the Earthquake, in Hampton; and something Remarkable of Thunder and Light- ning, in 1727,\" Mr. Gookin had printed in Boston the next winter in a pamphlet of over eighty pages octavo. It forms his only publication. Soon after this event, although he was still a young man, Mr. Gookin's health began to fail, mainly owing to throat trouble, and the town voted to secure an assistant for him. His death came on 25 August, 1734. At his funera,!, which was at the charge of the town, the sermon was preached by Rev. Mr. Fitch. His colleague. Rev. Ward Cotton, wrote in the town records an obitu- ary of him, from which the following is extracted : \" He was justly esteemed by the most judicious, a well accomplished Divine, a judicious Casuist ex- cellently qualified both to feed & guide the flock of Christ; an eminent preacher, excelling in the most correct phrase, clear method, sound scrip- tural Reasoning, a masculine style, manly voice, grave utterance, and a lively, close application to his hearers, with great affection, and yet free from affectation. . . He was a zealous asserter of the civil Rights, and Religious liberties of mankind. His temper was grave & thoughtful, yet at times cheerful and free, and his conversation very enter- taining. . . He was much given to hospitality, and took great pleasure in entertaining such as he might improve [himself] by conversing with.\" Authorities : Allen, Americanbiog. and HH. dictionary, 1832, p. 420.

Entering College at the age of twelve, he received his bachelor's degree in 1705 and his master's degree in 1708. For three years (1709 to 1712) he was Librarian, and for four (1712 to 1716) tutor. He was during the last three years of his tutorship a fellow of the Corporation. In 1715 he and John Barnard (H. U. 1700) were rival candidates for the place of assistant pastor to the aged Mr. Cheever at Marblehead. Barnard was elected, but some of the parish were dissatisfied with the choice and withdrawing, organized a new church, over which Holyoke was ordained 25 April, 1716. The two pastors, however, remained close friends. After the death of President Wadsworth in 1737, there was difficulty in choosing his sue- LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 15 eessor. The Corporation appear to have been equally divided between Holyoke and Rev. Joshua Gee (Librarian, 1721-22) ; while the Overseers were at first strongly opposed to the former, both because his orthodoxy was held not to be strictly Calvinistic and because he was a country clergy- man. The Corporation compromised by electing the Rev. William Cooper, but he declined the office. Finally, after over two months of discussion, the Corporation unanimously elected Holyoke, and two days later, 2 June, 1737, the Overseers unani- mously confirmed the choice. The causes that led to this change can hardly be determined ; Barnard in his Autobiography seems to attribute it to his own influence on Governor Belcher, and relates the conversation he had with him shortly before Holyoke's election, in which he vouched for the latter's scholarship and Calvinism. The society at Marblehead, however, was unwilling to let their pastor leave. Finally, at one of the meetings to discuss the question, Mr. Barnard prayed that they might have light in the matter, and forthwith they accepted Holyoke's resigna- tion. Afterwards, when it was asked why they allowed him to go, it was said, as Barnard quaintly relates, that \"old .Barnard prayed him away.\" Holyoke's inauguration took place 28 Septem- ber, 1737. His administration, the longest in the history of the College, covered years of prosperity and progress. A number of bequests were re- ceived and new professorships established, and several buildings were erected. New methods of teaching and text-books were adopted, and the laws governing the students were revised. The early part of his term was disturbed by a con- troversy with Whitefield. The revivalist had attacked the College as a place of darkness and irreligion. His charges were answered in a pamphlet entitled \" The testimony of the Presi- dent, professors, tutors, and Hebrew instructor of Harvard College, in Cambridge, against the Rev- erend George \"Whitefield and his conduct\" (1744). To this Whitefield replied, and was answered in a printed letter by Professor W^gglesworth, with an appendix containing Holyoke's refutation of the charge of inconsistency. Whitefield among other things had declared that \" Bad books are become fashionable amongst them. Tillotson and Clarke are read instead of Shepherd and Stoddard and such like Evangelical writers.\" Wigglesworth's answer to this charge indicates the kind of use the students made of the Library in the middle of the eighteenth century: \"for almost nine years,\" as was shown by an examination of the Library records and \"attested by the Library Keeper,\" \"Tillotson had not been so much as once taken out of the Library by any Undergraduate ; nor any of Dr. Clark's Works for above two years : Whereas Owen, Baxter, Flavel, Bates, Howe, DoolHtle, Willard, Watts, and Guyse (who be sure most of them can be reckoned Evangelical Writers, as well as Shepherd and Stoddard) have some or other of them been borrowed by Under- graduates during this whole time ; and that they they are scarcely ever in the Library.\" Professor Wigglesworth's letter ended the controversy so far as the College was concerned, although the pamphlet war outside continued long after. The peace of the later years of President Holyoke's long term was somewhat marred by trouble with the students over the commons. Holyoke continued the active duties of liis office until not long before his death, 1 June, 1769, in his eightieth year. At his funeral. Professor Stephen Sewall (Librarian, 1762-1763) delivered a Latin oration. Edward Holyoke was three times married : 1st in 1717 to Elizabeth, daughter of John Browne, of Marblehead ; 2d in 1725 to Margaret, daughter of John Appleton and grand-daughter of Presi- dent Rogers ; and 3d in 1742 to Mary, widow of Samuel Epes of Ipswich. He had eleven children. President Holyoke published very little ; Quincy suggests that it was owing to his being unwilling as the head of the College to enter into contro- versy. During his presidency his only publica- tions, besides his part mentioned already in the Whitefield incident, were a convention sermon, in 1741, on the \" Duty of ministers of the Gospel to guard against the pharisaism and sadducism of the present day,\" and a Latin poem contributed to the \" Pietas et Gratulatio,\" sent by the College to George III. on his accession. When a young man he had edited several numbers of an almanac (1715, etc.), and shortly before he became Presi- dent he printed his sermon preached at the ordi- nation of James Diman (Librarian, 1735-37) over the church at Salem. The previous year he had published his election sermon delivered before Governor Belcher, which it is said influ- enced the Governor in his favor. His Dudleian Lecture, delivered in 1755, the first of the series, was never printed. The manuscript of it, how- ever, is preserved in the College Library, where also may be found several manuscript sermons by him, — some of them in short-hand. Nathaniel Appleton, in his discourse after the funeral of President Holyoke, thus descrii es his appearance and character : \" The former of our Bodies gave him not only a comely Countenance, and a graceful Presence, but an healthy, robust and active Constitution of Body. And the Father of our Spirits endowed him with superior Powers of the Mind ; and by his kind Providence gave him special Advantages for improving and enlarging i6 LIBRARIANS t)F HARVARD COLLEGE. his mental Powers, in the yarious kinds of useful Learning, by an earlier Admission and longer Con- tinuance than common in that Society, over which he has since for many Years so laudably presided. Idleness and Sloth was an Abomination to him, so that he took Care to fill up his Time with some useful Service or other : Some for the Health of his Body ; others for the Improvement of his Mind ; some for the gratifying a particular Genius, and others for the accomodating his Family, or for the public Good.\" Attthorities : Appleton, The crown of eternal life, 1769. pp. 52, Essex inst.

Thomas Robie, the son of William and Eliza- beth (Greenough) Robie, was born in Boston 20 JIarch, 1689. Graduating in 1708, and obtaining his A.M. in 1711, he acted the next year (1712-13) as Librarian. In April, 1714, he was chosen \"fellow of the House,\" as tutors at that time were called; and eight years later (7 April, 1722) was elected \"fellow of the Corporation.\" This was the time, under President Leverett, of the contro- versy over the right of the resident fellows, or tutors, to be also members of the Corporation. It may have been partly this controversy that led Robie to resign his position in the College in February, 1722-3. He had preached occasion- ally, but a report \"that his sermons were only heathenish discourses, no better Christianity than was in Tully,\" caused him finally to withdraw from the pulpit. He then became a physician and settled in Salem. He was married to Mehitable Sewall, daughter of Major Stephen Sewall and sister of Chief Justice Sewall, who was Librarian, 1726-28. Three children were born to them. Mr. Robie died in Salem, 28 August, 1729, at the age of 41. Thomas Robie was a man of good scientific attainments ; many of his papers on mathematical and physicial subjects were published in the Pliilosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. He was \" a handsome writer ; speci- mens of his scientifick abilities, and his manner of composing, may be found scattered in the maga- zines and newspapers during 20 years of the 18th century.\" President Leverett wrote of him: \"It ought to be remembered that Mr. Robie was no small honor to Harvard College by his mathe- matical performances, and by his correspondence thereupon with Mr. Durham and other learned persons in those studies abroad.\" Besides his contributions to periodicals and societies, Robie published little. He edited several numbers of an almanac and a few years before his resigna- tion printed a \"Sermon preached in the College at Cambridge, to a society of young students\" (1721).

John Denison, the son of John and Elizabeth (Saltonstall) Denison, and the nephew of Na- thaniel Saltonstall (Librarian, 1697-1701), was born in 1688. His father was for many years the minister at Ipswich. Graduating in 1710, he took the degree of A.M. in 1713. He was Librarian for a year from 1713 to 1714. He studied for the ministry, but, on account of poor health, gave up preaching after a year or two, and settled in Ipswich as a lawyer. In this profession Denison appears to have been very successful ; his Latin epitaph in the old grave-yard at Ipswich speaks of him as most skilled in jurisprudence. For three years (1716-18) he was the representative from Ipswich to the General Court, and later he was lieutenant colonel and high sheriff of Essex county. In 1719 he married Mary, daughter of President Leverett of Harvard ; by this marriage he had two children. He died at the age of 35, on 25 November, 1724.

I714-I718. John Rogers, born in 1692 (?), was the oldest son of Rev. John Rogers, minister of Ipswich, and Martha Whittingham. His grandfather was presi- dent of Harvard 1682-1684. John took his first degree in 1711 and his A.M. three years later. He served as Librarian from 1714 to 1718, and on 16 October of the latter year was married to Susannah, sixth child of Major John Whipple of Ipswich. As early as 1715 Mr. Rogers was invited to Kittery, Maine, to preach on probation. \"His labours proving acceptable he was continued among them from year to year until suitable materials were found for constituting a Church.\" On the 22d of June, 1721, a church was organized at Sturgeon Creek, the north or second parish of Kittery, and Mr. Rogers, having accepted an invi- LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 17 tation to become the minister there, was ordained 25 October following. In this place (later called Elliot) Mr. Rogers labored for over fifty years, taking an active part in the work of the ministry, and attending conventions and ordinations. He preached at Gloucester, Mass., when his son accepted a call to that church. Mr. Rogers was unable to preach towards the close of his life, and received Rev. Alpheus Spring as his colleague 29 June, 1768. He died five years later, 16 October, 1773, at the age of eighty-one. His wife, by whom he had nine children, died 22 October, 1779.

His father, for whom he was named, was naval oflScer of the port and a man of considerable means ; Elizabeth, his mother, was the daughter of Henry Dering of Boston. William graduated at Harvard in 1716, and was Librarian from 1718 to 1720. The Rev. Samuel Mather, in his quaint English, says: \"As while he was young and tender he not onely was desirous of knowledge and sought after it, but he was swift to hear and ready to obey good counsels, and both a lover of good order and government and subject unto it. So continuing the same after he came to years of maturity, he was therefore judg'd to be, and there- fore chosen as, a most suitable person by the cor- poration and overseers of our little academy, to have the instruction and ordering of a class in it.\" This office of tutor he held from 1720 to 1728, when he was ordained as second minister of the New Brick Church, Boston, where he preached until his death, 29 April, 1753. He married 16 January, 1728, Sarah, sister of Governor Thomas Hutchinson, who survived him. William Welsteed died of palsy, as did his father, having \"had a fixed impression on his mind that he should be seized with it.\" It is worthy of note that his colleague for fifteen years, Ellis Gray (H. V. 1734), died at the same time and of the same disease. \" They were not especially distinguished men, but were accom- plished and exemplary, diligent and useful.\" His election sermon on \"The dignity and duty of the civil magistrate \" was printed at Boston in 1751.

Willlaiu Cooke, or Cook, was born at Hadley, Mass., 20 June, 1696, the son of Westwood and Sarah (Coleman) Cooke. He graduated at Har- vard in 1716 and took his A.M. in course. After he had served a year (1720-21) as Librarian, the Corporation elected him a, tutor ; President Lev- erett's ill health had made it impossible for him to continue giving instruction to the students. The Overseers, however, considered another tutor un- necessary, and at once annulled the election. At this time the inhabitants of Sudbury, living on the west side of the river, had successfully urged a division of the town into two parishes on account of the difliculty of crossing the water in winter. The east precinct was organ- ized 25 June, 1722, and on 20 March, 1723, Mr. Cooke was ordained as pastor. The salary, voted by the town, varied from year to year. Wood was furnished and the value deducted from the sum appropriated. In 1733 the town voted twenty pounds to Mr. Cooke \" towards making up for the loss of his barn,'' and also forty pounds as a gratuity. In \"A sermon preach'd to a society of young people, in Sudbury, on a Lord's-day evening, October, 1730,\" there is evidence of a simple, vigorous style and an earnest, kindly heart. The language suits his purpose admirably. Several other addresses are still accessible in printed form. Mr. Cooke lived \"in much harmony with his people, and was highly esteemed by them for his work's sake.\" After a long and successful minis- try a lingering illness kept him from the pulpit until his death, 12 November, 1760. Mr. Cooke's wife was Jane, daughter of Major Stephen Sewall of Salem and sister of Mitchel Sewall (Librarian, 1722-1723) . His only son, WilUam, (H. tJ. 1748) , had died in 1758, after teaching the grammar school since 1751. Authorities: Hudson, History of Sudbury, 1889, pp. 290-1,351-52.

Joshna Gee, the son of a respected tradesman of the same name, was born in Boston, 29 June, 1698. He took his A.B. in 1717, his A.M. in course, and served as Librarian of the College in 1721-1722. It was he who prepared the first printed catologue of the Library, as is shown by the following votes of the Corporation : 30 April, 1722. \"Upon the Intimation lately made by M'' Hollis, and formerly by M\"' Neal, that it may be of great advantage to the College Li- brary, that a Catalogue of the Books in this Library be printed and sent abroad, Voted, that i; LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. forthwith the Library-keeper take an Exact Cata- logue of the Books in the Library, and that the Same be printed in Order to transmit to friends abroad.\" 3 October, 1722. \" That M' Gee Library-keeper having prcpar'd a Catalogue of the Books belong- ing to the Library for the press is desired to take care to get 300 Copys prinf^ off & stitch'd for the use of the Corporation.\" At the meeting at which the last vote was passed Mr. Gee resigned, but the publication of the catalogue he had made proceeded and it was issued the next year in a small quarto volume of 106 pages, under the following title: \" Catalogus librorum Bibliotheca; CoUegij Harvardini quod est Cantabrigiae in Nova Anglia. Boston! Nov- Anglorum : Typis B. Green, academiae typography MDCCXXIII.\" This is not only the first cata- logue of the Harvard College Library, but proba- bly the first library catalogue printed in America. The \" Prsemonitio ad Lectorem\" described briefly the arrangement of the Library and the catalogue. The books, it says, are arranged in numbered cases of seven shelves each, and the books on each shelf are also separately numbered. Attached to each case is an index of the books in it. By the direc- tion of the Corporation, the catalogue is divided into three alphabetical sections, according to the size of the books, — folio, quarto, and octavo and under. That the books may be readily found, these numbers are given in the left hand margin, while the right margin is devoted to the place and date. The preface ends with an appeal to the reader: \"Cum nullum in hujusmodi Laboribus utcunque versatum lateat, quam proclive sit in numerorum notis et ejusmodi aliis, identidem errare ; nihil restat nisi utfretus Lectoris Candore, & Huraanitate hie filura abrumpam.\" There are about three thousand titles entered in this cata- logue. The most of the works are theological, and the Latin language predominates. In English literature, Shakespeare and Milton are almost alone, while in French the works of Clement Marot are oddly enough nearly the sole repre- sentative. Mr. Gee was ordained 18 December, 1723, pastor of the Old North, or Second, Church, Boston, as the colleague of Rev. Cotton Mather. In 1732, Mather having died four years before, his son. Rev. Samuel Matlier, was settled as col- league of Mr. Gee. But a separation occurred nine years later, and a new church was built for Mr. Mather. In 1747 Samuel Checkley was called as an assistant to Mr. Gee, who remained an invalid until his death in Boston, 22 May, 1748. His wife was Sarah, daughter of Rev. Nathaniel Rogers of Portsmouth, N. H., a near relative of President Rogers and of Rev. John Rogers (Li- brarian, 1714-1718). Joshua Gee was a powerful advocate of revivals, and distinguished himself by his defence of White- field, whom he entertained at his home in Boston. He was a member of the assembly of clergymen that met in Boston 7 July, 1743, to discuss the progress of religion in this country. In a printed letter to the moderator he complained of indiffer- ence and the doctrinal errors prevalent among the New England ministers. He is said to have been considered as a possible successor to Wadsworth as President of the College in 1737. His learning and his penetrating mind gave him great influence and made him feared as a possible \"fire-brand among the churches.\" Yet it has been said \"his foible was a strange indolence of temper. He preferred talking with his friends to everything else.\" As a preacher he was full of zeal and convincing in argument. He greatly endeared himself to his people, and was instrumental in founding a library for the use of the church. Beside the letter referred to above, Mr. Gee printed a sermon preached after the death of Cotton Mather in 1728, and the next year two sermons under the title \"The straight gate and the narrow way.\" It was said of him that he \"was reluctant to print his discourses, when urged, because he must finish them with some labour.\" Authorities : Appleton, Cyc. of Amer. biog., 1887.

Mitchel Seirall, the seventh child of Major Stephen Sewall of Salem, and Margaret, daughter of Rev. Jonathan Mitchel, was born 29 October, 1699. He was with his uncle, Chief Justice Samuel Sewall, at Cambridge on commencement day in 1714, and at his graduation in 1718 the Chief Justice \"saw Mitchel Sewall hold a ques- tion.\" He took his master's degree three years later, and was Librarian of the College 1722-1723. Mitchel soon returned to Salem, becoming clerk of the court of sessions and common pleas in 1725, and justice of the same in 1733. James Jeffrey, in an interleaved almanac, men- tions a journey to Ipswich 24 August, 1727, with Mitchel Sewall, B. Lynde (afterward chief justice), and others, to proclaim the king (George II.), and adds that they \"supped at Stanford's and returned at 2 in the morning.\" Sewall inherited his father's home in Salem, where he lived until his death, 13 October, 1748, \" a very respectable and worthy citizen.\" His LIBRARIANS Or HARVARD COLLEGE. 19 first -wife, whom he married 10 May, 1729, was Mary Cabot. They had three daughters. By his second marriage, 10 January, 1743, to Elizabeth Price, he had one daughter and two sons.

John Hancock (H. U. 1689) of Lexington, and Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Thomas Clark. He was born 1 June, 1702, graduated at Harvard in 1719, taking his A.M. in course, and served as Librarian 1723-1726. During his term a supplement to the Catalogue was printed. It was a small pamphlet of only five leaves, without a title-page, and paged continu- ously with the Catalogue of 1723. The heading of the first page reads: \" Continuatio Supple- menti Catalogi Librorum Bibliothecse Collegij Har- vardini, quod est CantabrigiEe in Nova Anglia \" ; the colophon is \" Bostoni Nov-Anglorum : Typis B. Green, Academiae Typographi. MDCCXXV.\" There is a copy of this supplement in the library of the Massachusetts Historical Society, but the College Library does not possess a copy. Some years previously Thomas Hollis of Lon- don, the first of the benefactors of that name, had begun his long series of gifts of money and books to the College. His letters still preserved contain frequent references to the Library. The follow- ing extract from a letter written in June, 1725, presents a sorry picture of its condition at that time: \"Your library is reckoned here to be ill managed, by the account I have of some that know it, you want seats to sitt and read, and chains to your valluable books like our Bodleian library, or Sion College in London, you know their methods, wch are approved, but do not imitate them, you let your books be taken at pleasure home to Men's houses, and many are lost ; your (boyish) students take them to their chambers, and teare out pic- tures & maps to adorne their Walls, such things are not good; if you want roome for modern books, it is easy to remove the less usefull into a more remote place, but not to sell any, they are devoted.\" Mr. Hancock was ordained at Braintree 2 November, 1726, and proved himself an able minister, a counsellor of moderation, yet a forcible defender of his belief, industrious and hospitable. His reply to the Rev. Joshua Gee's attack upon the assembly of ministers which met at Boston in 1743 is clear, concise, and not with- out cutting repartee. He baptized President John Adams. His brother Thomas founded the Han- cock professorship of Hebrew and other Oriental languages. John Hancock married Mary Hawke, widow of Samuel Thaxter, and died at Braintree (now Quincy) 7 May, 1744. Of his three children, his son. Governor John, was president of the conti- nental congress, a signer of the Declaration of Independence, and a, donor of five hundred pounds to the College towards replacing the Library and philosophical apparatus after the fire in 1764.

Stephen Seirall, the twenty-fourth Librarian of Harvard, and chief justice of Massachusetts, was a nephew of Samuel Sewall, the second Librarian of the College, chief justice of the colony in 1718. His brother Mitchel was Libra- rian 1722-1723, and Stephen, son of his cousin Nicholas, held the position in 1762-1763. Stephen was born at Salem 18 December, 1702, the ninth child of Major Stephen Sewall and Margaret, daughter of Rev. Jonathan Mitchel. He graduated with the class of 1721, took his A.M. in course, and for a time kept a school at Marblehead, devoting much of his leisure to preaching and to the study of divinity. Return- ing to Cambridge, Sewall became Librarian at Harvard in 1726. In 1728 he withdrew from the Library, but held a tutorship until 1739. \"As a tutor he proved that there was a perfect consistency between the most rigorous and reso- lute exertion of authority and the most gentle and complacent manners.\" Turning his attention, meanwhile, to the study of law, for which his mind seemed especially fitted, he accepted in 1739 a seat on the bench of the supreme court of Massachusetts. In 1752 he was appointed chief justice to succeed Paul Dudley (II. U. 1690) ; he became also a member of the council. These positions he held until his death, 10 September, 1760. Mr. Sewall doubted the legality of granting general writs of assistance upon which the cus- toms officers depended for their power to suppress illicit trading. This view of the question brought him into great favor with the patriotic party. He died before passing final judgment, 20 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. He was of a reverent nature, modest, yet with dignity becoming his position, and charitable even to a fault, leaving his estate insolvent at his death.

Joseph Champney, son of Joseph Champney of Cambridge, was baptized 19 September, 1704. He prepared for Harvard and graduated in 1721. Later he became a master of arts. He fitted him- self for the ministry, but held the position of Librarian 1728-1729. Six months after the death of Rev, Thomas Blowers of Beverly, Mr. Champ- ney was called to take his place. To the ordina- tion, 10 December, 1729, the neighboring churches were invited, and twenty pounds were voted to defray the expense. He was expected to preach a monthly lecture and catechise the children. His salary, £140 in province bills of credit, was to change with the fluctuation of the bills. In 1749 this amounted to £660 old tenor, and in 1750 it was £90 \"lawful money.\" Either through Mr. Champney's influence or the natural sentiment in the congregation, the church gave only a half- hearted support to the Cambridge platform and the denominational organization which it advo- cated. At about this time, and also shortly before his death, Mr. Champney was brought into oppo- sition to the work of Whitefield. He was, how- ever, of a \"peaceable temper and behavior, and a steady, prudent conduct.\" While the first mutterings of the Arminian theo- logical feud were too faint to stir the people, Mr. Champney's health began to fail. Mr. Joseph Willard was called as his colleague in 1772, and Mr. Champney died 23 February, 1773. A monu- ment was erected over his grave at the expense of his parish. \"He was of medium stature, light complexion, social habits, and, as was customary with clergymen of his time, wore a wig and cocked hat. \" Mr. Champney was married 1 October, 1730, to Elizabeth, daughter of Rev. Mr. Blowers. She died 13 January, 1732, at the age of nineteen, leaving an infant son. By his second wife. Thankful Pickens of Lynn, whom he married in 1733, he had six children. She died 31 July, 1777. Their daughter Elizabeth was a, successful teacher for many years. AuTHOKiTiES : stone, History of Beverly, 1843, pp. 226- 230. Whitney, The Christian mother.

Graduating from the College in 1726, he was made Librarian in the year in which he received his second degree, and served one year (1729-30). He studied both medicine and divinity, and although he preached at times, he had no regular settlement, and was better known as a physician than as a preacher. Settling first in Longmeadow, he may have been the Joseph Pynchon who was a selectman of Springfield in 1747. From 1747 to 1759 he was a member of the council of the Colony. He mar- ried, 13 October, 1748, Mary, widow of Rev. Thomas Cheney of Brookfield, and daughter of Rev. John Cotton of Kewton. Shortly after- wards he removed to Boston, where he seems to have passed the remainder of his life. Little is known of him ; he is referred to as a \" phys- ician in Boston\" by Belknap, but it was Dr. Charles Pynchon who attained some fame for his able and generous work among the poor of Boston during the small-pox epidemic of 1764. Dr. Joseph Pynchon is mentioned in the town records occasionally as being on the various com- mittees to visit the Boston schools. His death occurred in October, 1765. By his will, dated 5 October and admitted to probate the 25th of that month, he left his entire estate (consisting in part of five farms in western New Hampshire, one farm in Weston, and lands in Brookfield) to his four minor daughters, over whom his brothers Edward and Charles were appointed guardians. His wife had died previously. ACTHOEiTiES : Belknap's interleaved triennial. Boston — Record commissioners, Report, 1887. Green, Springfield, 1888, p. 262.

He graduated from College with the class of 1724, and took his A.M. in 1727. Immediately after graduating he had been the schoolmaster in Watertown. He was Librarian for the year 1734^5. In 1738 we find him serving as chap- lain at Castle William in Boston harbor. He is said to have been a man of brilliant parts, but very eccentric. One of his many peculiarities was his habit of talking in Latin. During the latter part of his life he became intemperate and was probably insane. He never married. He died a pauper at the age of 63, and was buried at the expense of the town of Watertown, 13 January, 1767. His only publication was a sermon with the fol- lowing title : A sermon preached at his Majesty's Castle William, March 26, 1738. Upon the much lamented death of her late most excellent majesty Caroline, queen-consort of the most puis«ant George the second, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland, king, defender of the faith, &e.

In 1730 he gradu- ated from Harvard, and three years later received the degree of A.M. He was appointed Librarian in 1735 and served until the spring of 1737. During his term a new code of laws for the administration of the Library was adopted by the Corporation.\" In February of that year he was called to the pastorate of the Second, or Bast, church in Salem. At his ordination there, 11 May, 1737, the sermon was preached by Ed- ward Holyoke (Librarian, 1709-1712), then the pastor of the church in Marblehead. Mr. Di- man, it is recorded, was to have » salary of \" 150 ounces of silver, at 6/8 an oz., and a free contribution.\" By his marriage with Mary Orne, 6 December, 1743, he had seven children. His ministry in Salem of over fifty years was in the main prosperous and peaceful. He was, how- ever, an old-school Calvinist, and at the end of his pastorate his parishioners were growing away from his rigid orthodoxy. This increasing differ- ence of views culminated in the calling as col- league to the aged pastor a young unitarian minister. Rev. Wilham Bentley (H. U. 1777). After this the senior pastor withdrew more and more from the parish work, until his death, 8 October, 1788, at the age of 81. James Diman is described as a man of \"grave aspect, invested with imposing dignity — rather stern and awe-inspiring — peculiar to the ministry of the age of huge wigs, which were the symbol of the clerical authority and the orthodox theology of the day.\" His only publication was : A sermon, preached at Salem, January 16, 1772.

On • See Appendix II. 22 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 20 May, 1737, he was elected Librarian at a salary of £25 per annum, and serred nntil 1741. The following interesting action was taken during the first year of his connection with the Library : — 21 March 1737/8 voted : \" That the Members of the Corporacon in Town w\"^ M' SteW^ Boardman be a Com\"= to provide Boxes for the Books in the Library, fitted w\"i handles &c v^^y the said Li- brary may be Speedily & Safely remov'd in case of Fire.\" In 1741 he received a unanimous call to become minister of the church in Rutland, but preferred to accept the position of tutor at Harvard. The duties of this office he performed very satisfactorily from 1741 to 17G6. On January 6 of this year he married Hannah Sprague, and upon his marriage, according to the rules of the College, he sent in his resignation. At a meeting of the Corporation of the College 1 September, 1766, this acknowledg- ment of his services was placed upon the records : \" The Time of Mr. Thomas Marsh's being Tutor of this House & Fellow of the Corporation, being now e.'spir'd. Voted, That the Thanks of the Cor- poration be given to the s'' M' Marsh, for his long & Faithful Services in those Capacities, & That liis Allowance as a Tut' be continued to the End of his present Quarter, being the Eleventh of this Instant.\" Mr. Marsh was a fellow of the College from 1755 to 1766. On the 14th of June, 1777, he purchased of John Stratton a dwelling-house, barn, and forty acres of land in Watertown. This estate he made his home, taking his nephew, John Marsh, into his family. At liis death in Watertown, 22 September, 1780, he left a considerable estate, the use of which was given to his wife during her lifetime. His nephew, John, eventually inherited nearly all this property in Watertown, Westminster, Stoddard (New Hampshire), and elsewhere. The inventory mentions portraits of Newton and Montague ; and fifteen sermons, these valued at one shilling and three pence, a rather discouraging estimate ! The inscription on his tomb was written by \" M'' Sewall.\" He left no children. His widow soon returned to Cambridge, where she died 24 October, 1788, aged 84.

Belcher Hancock, the son of a Cambridge shoemaker, Nathaniel Hancock, and of Prudence Russell, his wife, was born 24 April, 1709. He took his degree at Harvard in 1727, but we have found no record of his life during the ten years following. In 1741-42 he acted as Librarian of the College, and for the next twenty-five years held the position of tutor. From 1760 to 1767 he was also a fellow of the Corporation. Sidney Willard, in his \" Memories of youth and manhood,\" tells an amusing story of Hancock's last year at Harvard. When it was made known to the tutor in 1766 that he would not be reelected for another term of three years, he asked to be chosen again with the understanding that he should resign shortly after the appointment was announced. When reelected, however, Hancock deliberated a whole year before handing in his resignation. He died unmarried 8 November, 1771, aged 62. AuTHOiTiES : Paige, JTistory of Cambridge, 1877. Wil- lard, Memories, 1855, p. 34. 1742-1743- Benjamin Prat was born 13 March, 1710-11, in that part of Hingham now called Cohasset, the fourteenth child of Aaron Pratt, a farmer and constable. He began life as a mechanic. When about nineteen years of age he fell from an apple- tree and was so badly injured that his leg had to be \"taken off up to the hip.'' Incapable now of earning his livelihood in the ordinary ways open to a young man in a country town, he fitted for Harvard and graduated in 1737. He continued to suffer from this accident, and at times the pain was so great that the sweat stood out on his face as he bent over his books. He was accounted the lowest in social rank in his class. Three years later he received the degree of A.M. In 1742- 1743 he had charge of the Library. Eor a short time he went from one to another of the islands in Boston harbor, preaching to the Indians and teach- ing them. He studied law with Judge Robert Auchmuty, and opened an office on King, now State, street, north-east of the Old State House. He rose rapidly in his profession and associated himself with the leading men of the time. From 1757 to 1759 he represented Boston in the General Court (the second member of the legal profession, it is said, who attained to that position), and became advocate general for Massachusetts. He had a country house at Milton Hill, with 160 acres, where his love for historical study and poetry would have led him, had not his professional business kept him in the midst of affairs. Through Gov. Pownall's influence he was early in 1761 appointed chief justice of New York and a mem- ber of its council. In October, 1761, a group of his friends accompanied him as far as Dedham on his journey to New York, which was under- taken hastily on account of the unsettled condition of the courts there. His fellow-members of the LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. 23 Boston bar joined in a laudatory address to him on his departure. In 1762, having been obliged to re- turn to Milton chiefly from lack of money, he appealed to the Lords of Trade for his salary, which had been denied him by three successive sessions of the Assembly because his commission had not been granted during good behaviour. Mr. Prat went back to New York, however, and in June the Lords of Trade declared iu an address to the king that \"had it not been for the disinterested zeal of Mr. Prat, the administration of Justice had totally ceased in the Province.\" As a partial settlement of the dispute the Chief Justice's salary was paid out of the quit-rents, as suggested by Lieut. Gov. Golden. At first many felt a preju- dice for Mr. Prat as a stranger, but before his death, which occurred 5 January, 1763, his ability began to win recognition. He attempted to stop corrupt practices and extortion among the lawyers. Says Mr. Colden : ' ' He was received with contempt & displeasure. He died beloved and regretted as the greatest loss the Province ever sufl'ered.\" Chief Justice Prat was buried under the chancel in Trinity church. John Adams pictured him as \"wit, sense, imagination, genius, pathos, reason, prudence, eloquence, learning, and immense read- ing, hanging by the shoulders on two crutches, covered with a great cloth coat.\" Besides his ability as a lawyer and a judge (\"he was,\" says Hutchinson, \" of the first character in his profession\"), he wrote poetry, which in those not too critical daj'S was highly esteemed. His wife was a daughter of Judge Robert Auch- muty. His daughter Isabella inherited the prop- erty at Milton Hill. AuTHOBiTiES ; Mass. hist. soc. Proceedings, 1864, p. 35.

Matthew Cashing, the son of Solomon and Sarah (Loring) Gushing of Hingham, was born i April, 1720. His father, a tanner by trade, was a selectman and a deacon. Matthew gradu- ated from Harvard in 1739. The winter after he was granted his second degree, he was chosen (21 February, 1742-3) Librarian. On the following Commencement (6 July, 1743), the Corporation passed this vote : \" That Mr. Gushing Library- keeper be call'd to an Account with Respect to his Absence from the Library to Day Whereby the Overseers & Corporation were hindred from going in.\" It is to be presumed that he was able to give a satisfactory excuse for this negligence, as he seems to have served as Librarian for five years. Of Mr. Cushing's later career but few details are to be found. In September, 1749, the town of Charlestown granted him permission to keep a private school in that place, and the next spring, when the town voted to maintain two public schools, he was appointed master of the Latin school with a salary of £60 a year. Here he taught a year, until the summer of 1751, when the two schools were merged into one. Five years later we find him teaching school in Plym- outh for two years, 1756-1758, and then again we lose all trace of him, until in 1763 he was chosen master of the grammar school, then newly estab- lished in connection with King's College (now Columbia University), in New York. The next year that college gave him the honorary degree of A.M. The grammar school does not appear to have been a success, for in a few years reforms were thought necessary and the expenses were reduced. One of the two teachers was dismissed, but whether it was Gushing or his colleague, Alex- ander Leslie, does not appear. As a, new master was not appointed until five years after the form- er's death, it would seem probable that it was the latter who was retained in the school. In this case, the last dozen years of Mr. Cushing's life are a blank to us. He died in New York, 8 Janu- ary, 1779.

Oliver Peabody, the oldest son and second child of Rev. Oliver Peabody, minister at Natick, Mass., and missionary to the Indians, was born 15 January, 1725-6. His mother was Hannah Baxter, daughter of the Rev. Joseph Baxter of Medfield. Oliver graduated in 1745 and became Librarian in the year in which he received his second de- gree, 1748. In September, 1749, he was reelected for one year, and the following fall he was chosen pastor of the First church in Roxbury, where he was ordained 7 November, 1750. As no record appears of the appointment of a successor to him at the Library until the election of Marsh as Li- brarian ^ro tempore in April, 1751, it would seem either that he continued during the first few months of his pastorate to carry on the duties of Librarian or that there was no \" Library- keeper\" during that time. After less than two years of labor in this parish, Mr. Peabody died, unmarried, 29 May, 1752, at the age of 26. The 24 LIBRARIANS OF HARVARD COLLEGE. house that he built for » parsonage during his brief ministry is still standing. The minister to the Indians of Natick and his family were remem- bered with peculiar reverence and love by the townspeople, on account of tlieir piety, learning, and their simple and kindly natures. The College, too, took paternal care of the elder Peabody, making several grants to him, and after his death, shortly before his son's, paying his funeral ex- penses.

I75I- Perez Marsh, son of Captain Job Marsh, town clerk of Hadley, and Mehitabel, daughter of Hon. Samuel Porter, was born at Hadley, 25 October, 1729. He graduated from Harvard in 1748, and in the spring in which he took his second degree the Corporation passed, 24 April, 1751, the follow- ing vote : \" 1 : That S' Marsh be Library-Keeper till the Commencement, after V'^ it shall be con- sider'd, what Proportion of the establish'd Salary of that Officer, shall be allow'd to him . . . 3. That the Consideration of the Choice of the Library- keeper for the next year be left to the next Meetr ing.\" The matter, however, was not taken up until the fall, when, 16 September, 1751, the fol- lowing vote was passed: \" Vote 1. That whereas S\"' Marsh who was chosen Library-keeper, pro Tempore, at our Meeting Apr. 24. 1751, at which time it was proposed to give him, for s'' Business, some Proportion of the establish'd Salary of s^ Office, the s\"' Proportion was now debated upon. And inasmuch as it appears to us, That he hath been very negligent in the Business he was ap- pointed to Voted that he have allow'd him, for what Care he hath taken of said Library viz. Dur- ing the Space of nine Weeks, no more than the Sum of thirteen Shillings and four pence.\" From this it appears that, although his name has always been included in the list of Librarians, Marsh was in reality only Librarian pro tempore during a few weeks of the summer of 1751. In 1754 Mr. Marsh received an honorary A.M. from Yale, and at about this time, although the year is uncertain, he settled in Dalton, where he soon became one of the leading men in western Massachusetts. His marriage, about 1759, to Sarah, daughter of Colonel Israel Williams of Hatfield, allied him to the more prominent families of the county. Although Dr. Marsh is mentioned as a surgeon at Lake George in 1755, it is doubtful if he ever practised the profession in Dalton. He was the proprietor of a very successful tavern. From 1765 to 1781 he was nominally judge of the court of common pleas for Berkshire, although it ■H-as not allowed to sit after September, 1774. Dr. Marsh died at Dalton 20 May, 1784. Of his eleven children, Martha married Thomas Gold, and was the grandmother of Thomas Gold Apple- ton and of Mrs. Henry W. Longfellow. Authorities : Beers, History of Berkshire County, i.

He was the son of Stephen, a potter, and Mary Noseitor. He graduated in 1747. After taking his A.M. he was appointed (16 September, 1751) Librarian, and served for two years. 27 March, 1753, he was ordained as missionary over the Indians at Natick, succeeding Rev. Oliver Peabody (H. U. 1721) in this oflSce. On the Col- lege records, under dates of 9 January and 7 February, 1753, appear two votes of the Corpora- tion, by which they express their interest in the Indian lectureship and agree to grant Mr. Badger annually one moiety of the Boyle donation, amounting to £22 10s., and to give also the sum of forty pounds towards building him a house on land given him by the Indians, this money to be returned to the College if he should leave his charge within ten years, and provided further that the Corporation for propagating the gospel in New England should grant him like sums.
