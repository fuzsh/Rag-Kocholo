        "text": "This week everyone’s favourite plumber returned to cinemas for the first time in 30 years with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, starring Chris Pratt. While the first film, a live-action adaptation released in 1993, was a bomb that famously deterred Nintendo – one of the biggest game companies in the world – from making more movies, the latest iteration is expected to be one of the biggest releases of the year.\n\nIllumination’s Super Mario Bros. Movie is projected to make $190 million in its first five days in cinemas. If this eventuates, it will be the second-best opening week debut for the animation studio beaten only by Despicable Me 2 (2013), which grossed $213 million over the same period.\n\nSo, what’s changed? The anticipated success of the film is part of a much bigger story about how game adaptations are made, how they’re viewed by audiences and what we now regard as quality cinematic entertainment.\n\nThe original Super Mario Bros. film, released in 1993 and backed by the now-defunct Hollywood Pictures division of Walt Disney Studios, was both a critical and commercial flop. It made just $14 million during its opening week in the United States and Canada, and grossed about $31 million overall – less than half of its $62 million production budget. And reviewers were equally unenthused, lamenting the gratuitous use of explosions and kitschy costumes, and taking issue with the over-complicated storyline that failed to pay homage to the original game. “The movie knocks your eyes out, at the same time it dulls the mind’s eye,” Los Angeles Times reporter Michael Wilmington wrote at the time of its release.\n\nDespite the star power of Kylie Minogue and Jean-Claude Van Damme, the 1994 film Street Fighter was also ripped to shreds, receiving an abysmal 20 per cent audience score on Rotten Tomatoes and just 11 per cent from critics. It was, however, one of few adaptations in the decade to turn a profit, grossing about $147 million worldwide – nearly three times its production budget.\n\nLoading\n\nFilm critic and comedian Alexei Toliopoulos said much of this was due to the fact video games were still a developing form of media in the ’90s. Filmmakers couldn’t depend on a significant pre-existing fan base and had weaker storylines to work with too.\n\n“People didn’t understand what games culturally meant to audiences,” Toliopoulos said. “At that time, video games had interactive media at the forefront. Storytelling was less of a priority.”\n\nDr Matthew Harrison, a researcher in digital games-based learning at the University of Melbourne, said the film industry also simply didn’t consider video games a serious creative art form at the time.\n\n“The perception of movie studios was that [game adaptations] were a quick way to use name recognition from a popular activity for children, and to be able to get people into the cinema with their parents without having to worry about things like plot development,” Harrison said.\n\nWhat’s changed over the past couple of decades is the enormous growth of the video game industry, especially relative to films. Harrison said it’s more or less accepted now that video games were more profitable than films, partly due to rising interest from a ballooning middle class in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nIn 1993, revenue for the global gaming industry was equivalent to $55.2 billion (adjusted for inflation). By 2013, Grand Theft Auto V made $1 billion worldwide in three days, making it the fastest-selling entertainment product at the time. It was a turning point for the industry, and things have only accelerated since.\n\nA recent PwC report noted that global video games revenue rose 32 per cent between 2019 and 2021, and the industry was expected to be worth $479.3 billion by 2026. This week, Australian drinks retailer Endeavour Group invested $3 million into Sydney’s newest e-gaming centre, Fortress, showing just how mainstream the medium has become.\n\nMark Johnson, a digital cultures scholar at the University of Sydney, said this growth had triggered a shift in the cultural power between mediums.\n\nLoading\n\n“Rather than films being seen as the core media and games being seen as adaptations, we’re now seeing the reverse,” he said. “There’s also a real prestige difference, as games based on films and television are still normally critically panned and have very little impact on gaming ... Yet television and film based on games are becoming more accepted.”\n\nPeople are also choosing to watch other gamers play on platforms like Twitch or YouTube for recreation, which is almost like a midway point between watching a film and gaming."
