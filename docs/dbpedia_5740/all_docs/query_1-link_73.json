        "text": "A few weeks ago, I found myself embroiled in a war of words with a few men I had never met.\n\nThis isn't big news in the era of social media. Indeed, our exchange took place online, on a Facebook page devoted to comic books and superheroes.\n\nSetting off the argument was news that Disney plans a sequel/reboot of its 1991 movie \"The Rocketeer,\" which was based on a comic book character created by Dave Stevens in 1982.\n\nYou may remember the film: Billy Campbell played Cliff Secord, a 1930s pilot who becomes a flying, helmet-wearing superhero after he discovers a rocket pack created by Howard Hughes. The new film, which is in the early days of planning, is said to feature a black female in the lead role.\n\nAnd that, my friends, is where the problem began.\n\nEchoing concerns by others, one Facebook user said the new movie is \"affirmative action disguised as (a sequel).\" Another said he preferred movies \"where the main character has the look of the source material\" (in other words, a white lead), even when other elements of the original are changed. This led to guffaws about the \"uproar\" that would occur if characters who were originally created as minorities were recast as white men. Such comments are proof that people don't like having their white privilege challenged.\n\nMy argument then -- as now -- is that Disney has many ways to make a minority Rocketeer an interesting character, one who reflects the racial tensions in the 1930s and 1940s, but still headlines an exciting adventure.\n\nI find it acceptable to reimagine some traditionally white characters as minorities, along with creating new characters of all races, genders and backgrounds to better reflect today's diverse audiences. Companies who purvey pop culture -- movie and television studios, comic book publishers, video game producers and the like -- should also actively recruit minorities to write and direct. There are perspectives beyond those of white, Anglo-Saxon males that deserve to be given voices.\n\nOn the Facebook page where I posted these views, I was accused of being \"insidiously racist\" and told that a diversity equilibrium, at least in comics, had already been reached. \"Every time I turn around these days,\" one fan wrote, \"I'm being introduced to a new female or minority writer or artist.\"\n\nThe debate went on for a while, with neither side convincing the other. For an online exchange, it was civil -- see Joel Stein's cover story, \"Why we're losing the Internet to the culture of hate,\" in Time magazine on Aug. 29 for a look at more typical cyber arguments -- but I was nevertheless dubbed an \"SJW\" and accused of wanting \"black\" stories and \"white\" stories in comics and movies.\n\nSJW, or social justice warrior, is a term used by the alt-right to insult anybody whose agenda is seen as too liberal or progressive, or who challenges white privilege in modern society. In the entertainment world, SJW is levied against people who believe it is acceptable that the new \"Ghostbusters\" cast four women in the lead instead of four men, that the protagonist in the forthcoming movie adaptation of Stephen King's \"Dark Tower\" books will be a person of color, and that some traditionally male, straight, caucasian characters in comics have been reimagined as women, gay and minorities.\n\nAs for the opinion that people who advocate a level playing field for minority writers and actors are somehow segregating stories into \"white\" and \"black,\" it's inaccurate and unfair. Everybody wants good stories, shows, books, movies, comics, whatever, created by the most talented people.\n\nWhy not, as part of this talent search, put a special emphasis on discovering voices that have been traditionally underrepresented or even suppressed? Such creators can write about characters who are the same as, or different from, their own backgrounds. No story segregation is implied.\n\nSuch changes don't affect entertainment that has already been made, after all. The history of Hollywood and comics -- like most pop culture -- is overwhelmingly (and shamefully) white. People who, for whatever reason, prefer this perspective will find that nobody has replaced the actors in old movies with minority stand-ins or modified Superman and Spider-Man comics of the '60s to make the principal characters Asian or Hispanic.\n\nYour memories are preserved. Your childhoods have not been ruined.\n\nEventually, I had to walk away from the keyboard in my disagreements about the new Rocketeer. It was a sunny summer day, and I could find too many other things to do than argue the potential merits of a movie that hasn't been written yet.\n\nBut if it gets made, I hope viewers give it a chance. Let's support big, glorious, cheesy movies that appeal to the widest audiences possible, and let's make those movies reflect the diversities of everybody watching.\n\nIf that makes me an SJW, it's a role I'll play with pride.\n\nChris Schillig, who promises to return to his own voice next week, can be reached\n\nat chris.schillig@yahoo.com or\n\nat @cschillig on Twitter."
