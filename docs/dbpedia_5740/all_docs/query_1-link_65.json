        "text": "June 8, 2022\n\nNice collection of Rocketeer stories but several artist and writers. Fun Read. Recommended\n\nDecember 4, 2021\n\nI have to say, this is a bit of a letdown. Dave Stevens wove a masterpiece in the creation of the art and writing in the original eight \"chapters\"/issues(?) of Cliff Secord/The Rocketeer (see The Rocketeer: The Complete Adventures). Artists since have not matched his skill with 'realistic illustration' and writers since have not matched his in plots, pulp atmosphere, cameos, dialogs nor semi-realistic action. Well, except maybe The Rocketeer / The Spirit: Pulp Friction -- although less realistic, we know from the title that we are getting a different product than the Dave Stevens original.\n\nHere, we have four issues/chapters and a prose story (although the prose story seems to be set after the WW II). The stories are okay, but they move away from the emotions and fell of realism that ran through the original. The action doesn't seem to match Stevens' work, there is no issue of physics (flying forever on one tank of 'gas'), and the art is more cartoon-ish.\n\nSo, likeable as a derivative escapist adventure story, disappointing when measured by the things I loved about the original.\n\nFebruary 1, 2017\n\nA funny Rocketeer WWII miniseries from IDW, but art was a pale imitation of Darwyn Cooke's style and storyline reminded me too much the plot of \"Captain America: the first Avenger\" movie.\n\nApril 15, 2017\n\nBeing a fan of the Rocketeer, I was really disappointed with how bad this is. The writing is clunky and the art is laughably bad on many pages. Avoid this at all costs.\n\nSeptember 15, 2020\n\nIts a pretty fun story of Cliff Secord enlisting in the army to fight the Allies and the Ratzis. The generals ask him to become a Rocketeer again as he is the only one who can operate it and stop the Ratzis from destroying NYC who seem to have a similar prototype of the rocket Cliff has. Its a fun story, fun cameos, and introduction to Brit Super-spy Roxy O'Hara and typical Cliff saving the day, it was a short quick read and showed the patriotic side of Cliff which I enjoyed!\n\nApril 6, 2023\n\nIt's 1942. The United States is now at war. Heck, the whole world is at war at this point. Cliff Secord has joined the war effort and in doing so, he's given the US Army access to his jet pack and schematics. Thinking he'll get to be the Rocketeer for the Allied forces, in typical Army fashion, Secord is posted as a lowly private while big wigs and egg head types attempt to create an entire fleet of flying superheroes.\n\nHowever, when the latest guinea pig to test out the flying suit dies during a training run and a Nazi spy attempts to steal one of the parts to the jet pack, fate gives Cliff a chance to be the hero he was always meant to be! The Rocketeer of the United States Armed Forces!\n\nWhy I haven't been reading and collecting Rocketeer stuff is beyond me. Well, okay. Maybe I understand why. The 1991 Disney live action film was boring to a 13 year old me. Nowadays, I view the film with older eyes and I see its brilliance. But compared to the Tim Burton Batman films and even the earlier Superman films, the Rocketeer movie was definitely designed for a more sophisticated audience and one that enjoyed the Saturday morning serials of the 1940s and 50s.\n\nObviously, the main reason just about anyone loves The Rocketeer is because of its amazing creator, the late Dave Stevens. His artwork was year 3000 stuff. Though Dave Stevens operated in the comics medium, he was more than just a sequential artwork hack. We have a limited amount of work from him because Dave Stevens was his own harshest critic and was meticulous over every piece he did. Plus, if the job offer just wasn't right, he'll turn it and the heaps of cash it would have provided down flat.\n\nTaking over for Dave Stevens in this miniseries is writer Marc Guggenheim and the art team of Dave Bullock and J. Bone. The quality of both the story and art are great. But the artwork is much better. That's probably because the plot borrows heavily from other World War II franchises. There are elements of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Captain America: The First Avenger and the war books of DC Comics. It all made for a great story. Just the level of creativity was lessened in my mind.\n\nI did think it was odd that J. Bone's amazing artwork in the first chapter gets temporarily replaced by Dave Bullock in the next and then no more Bullock. I would have been okay if the two artists switched tasks every other issue as that would have made for an even pattern in the art. Sorry, but I like patterns and symmetry and what I just described is asymmetric as I don't know what.\n\nOkay. This wasn't a perfect read. But I had a lot of fun reading it and I want more. Technically, I got some more with a 4-part prose story by Liza Morton. 'The Rivet Gang' is set towards the end of the second World War. It has Secord and his girlfriend, Jenny Blake, taking on an all-female group of criminals that are using a stolen prototype of the Rocketeer's suit.\n\nThat backup story was really good. Very creative with some great dialogue and an awesome set of twists and turns. In some ways, it was a better story than the main feature. Just why couldn't this have been done in comic book form as well? Yes, there's some great illustrations peppered in. It's just not the same however...\n\nFebruary 4, 2018\n\nGiven the time period in which the character is set, it seems surprising no one had thought to put Dave Stevens' flying hero The Rocketeer into World War II until IDW finally did it with this mini-series. The collected four issues set in 1942 makes for a fun, pulpy read though the dialogue is more functional than anything else. The artwork is in a fun style that brings to mind the animation work of Bruce Timm which may put some readers off. The collection also has a fun short story included called the Rivet Gang which moves The Rocketeer characters to the other end of the war but which is another piece of pulp fun. Indeed, this entire volume can be described exactly that way: fun. Just don't expect much depth going on.\n\nJune 21, 2022\n\nFun little Rocketeer miniseries. It’s nice to see The Rocketeer move into WWII a bit, and the story is certainly engaging. However, it moves along at a snail’s pace. A single mission, really, is told over 4 issues. Why couldn’t we have seen multiple instances of the Rocketeer fighting overseas?\n\nAlso, the artist changes at the halfway mark, and for the worse, in my option.\n\nI did enjoy the text story in each issue, but I don’t think the reader would have missed anything skipping them.\n\nNot bad. Not the best.\n\nJune 2, 2018\n\nIt was pretty good. It was more fun than some of the other comics I have read lately. It did have a scene where he was starting to hallucinate due to oxygen deprivation and it was solely an excuse to have naked mermaids in the story. It also had a short story at the end that wasn't a comic that took place just after World War II. A group of women turn robbers to make ends meet now that the men are back so they aren't valuable anymore.\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nFebruary 5, 2017\n\nSadly too cartoony in its art and hamfisted in its writing. With so much possibility we get two women fighting over Cliff and a Nazi ray gun plane. Cliff's fighting Nazi's and for some reason Betty needs to get captured again - continuing her journey as one of the worst female characters in all of comics.\n\nAugust 26, 2017\n\nCliff Secord hangs up his rocketpack to enlist in WW2, but the appearance of a Nazi Rocketeer pulls him out of active duty and into the line of fire! Introducing Roxy O'Hara, a possible rival to Betty's affection. Charming and fun, reminiscent of the first Captain America movie - which is a very good thing indeed.\n\nJuly 16, 2021\n\nAs someone who grew up watching the 90s film based on this character, I was looking forward to learning more about him. I was not disappointed. It had a great story, characters and above all just a fun time on this adventure. I enjoy reading and learning more about classic Pulp characters. Look forward to reading more stories of The Rocketeer.\n\nMarch 20, 2018\n\nThe late Dave Stevens' high flying hero lives on in this miniseries chronicling Cliff Secord's adventures during WWII. Marc Guggenheim gives us an entertaining story and the art by Dave Bullock and J. Bone is a bit more cartoony than the original but that didn't bother me.\n\nJune 9, 2017\n\nI love Spider-Man, but even this was a little too quippy for me.\n\nPretty cute, but mostly nostalgic/enjoyable because I love The Rocketeer.\n\nFebruary 6, 2017\n\nCliff Secord, despite having retired as the famed Rocketeer, is convinced to join in the anti-Nazi effort of WWII because he's the only one who can effectively control the jetpack. Others have tried and pretty much all have died in the attempt. Now Corporal Secord must fight against the Nazis and their Amerika bomber complete with Japanese-built death ray. Oh and did I mention there is a Nazi \"Kapitan\" with his own jetpack.\n\nIt's campy and cutesy and wholly defies logic but it's fun. Totally rah rah WWII pro-Allies propaganda feel to it like the Chris Evans Captain America movie, but I enjoyed it. Just go in with low expectations.\n\nOctober 11, 2016\n\nPublic Library copy.\n\nThis was a bit better than I thought it'd be. It's certainly not the gem the Dave Steven's work was, but the story was decent and the art was fun to behold in its cartoony way.\n\nMarch 16, 2020\n\nA fun read that makes me wish the movie would have done better."
