        "text": "It’s been a long time since the Rocketeer has saved anyone, but today the new Disney Junior animated series based on the classic hero made its debut. The new animated series, simply titled The Rocketeer, passes the spirit of the old hero to a child named Kit, who uses her new rocket pack to protect her community.\n\nA special preview of the series’ fourth episode is available on DisneyNOW. This episode features Kit taking on a magician who tries to steal her rocket pack in the first story and in the second Kit inspires a comeback from a once-great pilot. The latter features guest star Phylicia Rashad, who Disney fans know as Dr. Marsh from the Dinosaur attraction at Disney’s Animal Kingdom.\n\nThis show is a lot of fun. It is absolutely a children’s show, as you could have guessed from its presence on Disney Junior, so don’t expect it to be very complex and thrilling. If you’re willing to watch a kids’ show though, you can do a lot worse than this.\n\nThere’s plenty of humor throughout the episode, mainly from Kit’s best friend Tesh and her dog Butch. There are a lot of cheesy jokes and cringingly quirky characters thrown in for the kids but they’re not the worst I’ve seen in a show like this and they’re easily outnumbered by very enjoyable jokes and characters.\n\nThere’s also a decent amount of action for a kids’ show. It may not be the same kind of action you would see in the original Rocketeer, but fans of the classic movie will enjoy the high-flying fun and the way the series captures some of that same energy.\n\nOverall, Disney Junior’s The Rocketeer is just fun. If you’re looking for something to watch with your kids while still sharing some of your favorite old content with them, this is a good way to do it. And perhaps it can spark an interest in the original Rocketeer as well."
