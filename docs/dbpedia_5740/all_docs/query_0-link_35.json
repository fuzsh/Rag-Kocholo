        "text": "PREFACE\n\nThroughout the relatively short history of video games, a number of best-of and top-100 lists have appeared in print and online. Since lists of this type have been done before, what’s the point of this book?\n\nFor starters, to my knowledge there has never been a 100 Greatest video games book of any type, just articles and magazine features. Further, most previous top-whatever video game lists offer a couple of sentences or maybe a paragraph or two about each title. This book, on the other hand, covers each game in exhaustive detail, featuring such content as production histories, sequels, remakes, ports for current consoles, anecdotes, creator info, collector pricing, comparisons to similar games, comparisons to lesser versions of the game, and, most interestingly (at least to me), quotes from industry professionals (both recent and from older publications).\n\nIn addition, most endeavors of this type cover too narrow or, conversely, too broad of a category, focusing on either a single system—best 100 NES games, for example—or the industry as a whole, lumping together console, handheld, computer, and arcade games from all eras. By comparison, this book zeroes in on those console titles released during a singular, highly crucial, fondly remembered decade—one marked by the introduction of the indispensable Atari 2600, Odyssey2, and Intellivision, the unleashing of the underrated Vectrex, the mind-blowing debut of the next-gen ColecoVision and Atari 5200, and the rebirth of the industry through Nintendo’s legendary juggernaut, the NES.\n\nTo the very best of my ability, which is informed by 40 years of playing video games and more than 15 years of writing about them professionally, I’ve boiled the hundreds of console games released from 1977–1987 down to the 100 greatest titles. I’m sure I excluded some cartridges that many gamers—including you, constant reader—hold in particularly high regard, and for that I don’t apologize.\n\nRather, I hope my perceived oversight makes your blood boil (or at least simmer), forcing you to fire up the respective classic console, plug in that old favorite that I neglected to include, and extol the virtues of that game to anyone who will listen online or in person. Like movies, paintings, and novels, video games are an art form, and it’s okay to be passionate about them.\n\nBut before you get too angry, check the back of the book for The Next 100 appendix, which catalogs 100 more great games—honorable mentions, if you will—many of which just barely missed the main section.\n\nOne of the primary goals I hope to achieve is to introduce casual and hardcore gamers alike to games they’ve never played before, or games they’ve only played once or twice, and then blown them off without really giving them a fair shake. You’ll find obvious selections listed, such as Space Invaders for the Atari 2600 and Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo NES, but you’ll also find obscure gems such as Killer Bees! for the Odyssey2 and such drastically underrated games as Donkey Kong 3 for the NES.\n\nWhile preparing this book, playing and replaying countless old favorites, I made sure to include only those games that have held up well over time and are still fun to play today. A game like Superman for the Atari 2600 or Utopia for the Intellivision may be more important historically than Frenzy for the ColecoVision, but the latter game is more fun (at least to me), so it made the list, while the other two, quality titles though they are, remain relegated to more straightforward video game history books.\n\nNarrowing the list down to 100 games was tough; there are just too many great games from the era to include them all. Alien, Boxing, and Worm War I for the Atari 2600 barely missed The Next 100 appendix at the back of the book, for example, as did a number of excellent ColecoVision, Intellivision, and Vectrex titles. If you are disappointed that some of your favorites didn’t make the list, believe me, so am I.\n\nFor certain entries in this book I cheated, such as when I lumped the Atari 2600 and 7800 versions of Asteroids into one entry, and when I did the same with K.C. Munchkin! and K.C.’s Crazy Chase! for the Odyssey2. Allowing these cheats helped give the book more cohesion, and it let me sneak in a few extra titles that otherwise would have remained on the cutting room floor.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind as you read is that I wrote the book in such a way as not to be redundant. For example, Centipede for the Atari 2600 is an entertaining game that probably deserves to be in The Next 100 appendix, but Centipede for the Atari 5200 and ColecoVision are listed in the main section of the book, where I also detail the 2600 version. Since 2600 Centipede isn’t the best (or tied for the best) Centipede port, and since it’s already covered in the 5200/ColecoVision chapter, it doesn’t get its own entry.\n\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that, even though video games are my area of expertise, my opinions are just that—opinions. I’ve got a considerable amount of gaming experience, of course, so I can compare and contrast with the best of them, but a lot of the book simply comes down to my specific tastes, which is one reason I included numerous quotes from other prominent gamers. (I did so for historical purposes as well.)\n\nA key inspiration for this work was my love of heavily opinionated reference books, including such indispensable tomes as Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels (1985, Carroll & Graf) by David Pringle and The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History (2000, Citadel Press) by Michael H. Hart. These types of books rarely gather dust on my shelves, as I flip through them again and again.\n\nMore precisely, the idea for this book came to me while I was reading Bill Warren’s Keep Watching the Skies! (2010, McFarland Publishers), which is a massive (not to mention massively entertaining) tome chronicling American science fiction movies of the 1950s (and up through 1962). Warren’s book isn’t a best-of volume, but, with its production histories, quotes from other sources, coverage of a specific era, and the like, it did get me thinking along the lines of the book you are holding in your hands.\n\nThough games listed in this book are, obviously, decades old, they remain timeless and relevant, having influenced generations of games to follow. Many are available as downloads for current consoles, some have been remade for smart phones and tablets, most have been emulated via personal computers, and all show up on eBay from time to time (some way more often than others). Keeping this in mind, there’s no excuse not to treat yourself (and your friends and family) to some old-school gaming.\n\nI hope you are able to use this book as a guide to what games are worth your time and money. Just be sure to let me know what games I should have included, and which ones I should have left out.\n\nYou can reach me at brettw105@sbcglobal.net.\n\nAs always, thanks for reading!\n\n~Brett Weiss\n\nAdventure for the Atari 2600, complete in box. $27.\n\nCHAPTER 1\n\nADVENTURE\n\nATARI 2600\n\nGENRE: ADVENTURE\n\nPUBLISHER: ATARI\n\nDEVELOPER: ATARI\n\n1 PLAYER\n\n1979\n\nBOTH CHARMINGLY SIMPLE AND DAUNTINGLY DIFFICULT.\n\nAlthough extremely dated in appearance, Adventure for the Atari 2600 is such an influential and continually endearing game that I simply had to include it in this book. Not only is it a fun game in its own right, it paved the way for countless adventure quests to follow, including such favorites as The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy, and Tomb Raider.\n\nCreated by Warren Robinett, Adventure has players trying to retrieve an enchanted chalice that was stolen by an Evil Magician and hidden somewhere in a labyrinthine Kingdom. Said chalice must be returned to the Golden Castle where it belongs. Making this task difficult are three dragons created by the Evil Magician: Yorgle, the mean yellow dragon; Grundle, the mean and ferocious green dragon; and Rhindle, the fastest, most ferocious red dragon.\n\nThere are three castles in the Kingdom for players to explore: Black, Gold, and White. Each castle contains a gate over its entrance that must be opened with a color-coded key. Castles are separated by labyrinths, pathways, and rooms, and there are items scattered about these areas that will help the player in his or her quest. In addition to keys, players can find a bridge for passing through barriers, a magnet for moving objects and removing stuck and out-of-reach objects, and a sword for slaying the dragons.\n\nEach dragon guards specific items. In addition, there’s a pesky black bat that tries to switch out items with the player, such as—God forbid—an enemy dragon in exchange for the fabled chalice.\n\nAdventure offers three skill levels, the hardest and most tantalizing of which finds the objects and dragons placed randomly within the Kingdom. Further, when the left difficulty switch is set in the B position, the dragons hesitate before they attack the player, making them a little easier to dodge.\n\nRobinett got the idea for Adventure from a computer game, as he revealed in an interview published on www.dadgum.com. I played the original text adventure, written by Don Woods and Willy Crowther, at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab in 1978, he said. \"This was while I was working on Slot Racers. Then it was time to do another game, and I thought that doing Adventure as a video game would be really cool.\"\n\nCreating such a game with graphics created some tricky problems, as Robinett explained: Text adventures used verbal commands like ‘Go North’ or ‘Take Wand’ or ‘Wave Wand.’ My idea was to use the joystick for the North/South/East/West commands, the button for picking up and dropping objects, and touching graphical objects together on the screen for all the other miscellaneous actions…instead of describing each room in text, I would show it on the screen, one room at a time…driving off the edge of the screen was the analog of ‘Go North’ or east or whatever. This allowed the game to have a much larger playing space than a single screen, which was a big change in the feel of a video game.\n\nThe entrance to the Gold Castle in Adventure.

The castles are comprised of squares and rectangles, and the mazes consist of the type of crude outlines found in such early Atari titles as Slot Racers and Maze Craze. The sparse sound effects are a meager collection of bleeps and bloops.\n\nIn a recent interview with Chris DeLeon (hobbygamedev.com), Robinett talked about working on Adventure and the special challenges of programming for the 8-bit console. The Atari 2600 has so many limitations that it’s hard to do anything, he said. \"If I had more resources I might have represented it [the graphics in Adventure] differently, but it worked.\"\n\nWhen Robinett was developing Adventure, Atari didn’t pay royalties to programmers, nor did they publish creator credits, as he related in High Score! The Illustrated History of Electronic Games (2002, Osborne/McGraw-Hill). When I first went to Atari, I thought I’d died and gone to heaven, he said. I was being paid to design games. But then, after about a year and a half, it started to dawn on me that Atari was making hundreds of millions of dollars and keeping us all anonymous. They didn’t even give you a pizza if you designed a good game. There was no incentive at all. Nothing. That’s when I had the idea of hiding my name in the game.\n\nAs any retro gamer worth his thumbs knows, Robinett created a secret room in Adventure that could only be accessible by selecting a single gray dot on a gray wall, a major violation of company policy. I could have been fired if anyone had discovered it, so I kept it secret for a year, he said. \"The game code would have been very easy for Atari to change if they had known about the secret room. But after 300,000 Adventure cartridges had been made and shipped around the world, it was too late.\"\n\nFor years, Robinett’s name in Adventure was thought to be the first Easter egg—a term coined by Arnie Katz, Joyce Worley, and Bill Kunkel of Electronic Games magazine—in a video game. However, in 2004, a programmer and collector named Sean Riddle found an Easter egg—programmer Bradley Reid-Selth’s surname—in Videocart-20: Video Whizball (featured in The Next 100 appendix at the back of this book) for the Fairchild Channel F system. Video Whizball was released to stores in 1978.\n\nAccording to Before the Crash: Early Video Game History (2012, Wayne State University Press), however, the exact historical timeline of Easter eggs in video games is muddled. Contributor Zach Whalen wrote, \"… some confusion may yet exist over which programmer deserves credit, since Reid-Selth claims to have gotten the idea because of reports that programmers at Atari were already doing it, and Robinett had completed at least some of the code for Adventure as early as 1978.\"\n\nRegardless of who invented the video game Easter egg, everyone agrees that Robinett popularized the idea, and most everyone agrees that Adventure is a great title, despite its primitive audio/visuals.\n\nRich gameplay more than makes up for the game’s rudimentary graphics and sounds, said Chris Cavanaugh of the All Game Guide (allgame.com). Jeff Rovin, in The Complete Guide to Conquering Video Games (1982, Collier Books), called the game absorbing and said that \"if you like surprises [and] enjoy seat-of-the-pants play mixed with ingenuity and bravado, Adventure is your cup of hemlock.\"\n\nIn a review published in issue #7 (June, 1984) of the British publication TV Gamer, the writer said, \"Adventure is one of the most enthralling games you can buy for the Atari 2600 and any adventure enthusiast should not be without it.\"\n\nIn the Digital Press Presents: Our 99 Favorite Classics feature published in issue #33 (Sept./Oct., 1997) of the Digital Press fanzine, the contributors had predictably high praise for Adventure, calling it a longtime favorite…arguably the most replayable adventure game because of its random skill setting on game 3…the perfect example of the video gaming spirit.\n\nIn Classic Gamer Magazine #3 (spring, 2000), Kyle Snyder said Adventure is both charmingly simple and dauntingly difficult. It speaks to the inner child in all of us. Those of us who saw it brand new when we were six were blown away at all the things you could do. Whether you were busy searching catacombs, collecting objects, or slaying dragons, there was so much to interact with. (Snyder was apparently a child prodigy—Adventure would have confused me silly as a six-year-old.)\n\nIn Ken Uston’s Buying and Beating the Home Video Games (1982), the noted gamer and gambler made a prescient prediction about Adventure: I have a feeling that this cartridge…is going to be the wave of the future.\n\nWith countless fantasy adventure video games following in its wake, Adventure, which sold more than a million copies, did nothing less than change the industry forever. Not only did it create the fantasy adventure genre for consoles, it predicted an industry in which entire games would be built around hidden surprises (2001, The Ultimate History of Video Games: From Pong to Pokemon—The Story Behind the Craze That Touched Our Lives and Changed the World).\n\nA timeless classic, Adventure has been reissued for modern systems on such compilation discs as Atari Anthology! (2004, PS2, Xbox) and Atari Classics: Evolved (2007, PSP). It’s also built into Atari Flashback consoles 1–3. In 2010, Microsoft made Adventure available as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 Game Room service.\n\nAtari announced a sequel to Adventure in 1982, but it devolved into the ill-fated Swordquest series. In 2005, Curt Vendel created a true sequel, Adventure II, for the Atari Flashback 2. In 2007, AtariAge also released a game called Adventure II, this one a homebrew sequel on the Atari 5200. Epic Adventure, an AtariAge homebrew for the Atari 2600, followed in 2011.\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nAdventure is parodied in Cannot Be Erased, So Sorry, a 2009 episode of Robot Chicken (a stop-motion animated show produced by Seth Green).\n\nWHY IT MADE THE LIST:\n\nPossibly the greatest game ever written for the Atari 2600 platform (Time Magazine, Nov. 15, 2012), Adventure not only created a new console gaming genre, it is still widely played today.\n\nAir-Sea Battle for the Atari 2600, complete in box. $10.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nAIR-SEA BATTLE\n\nATARI 2600\n\nGENRE: NON-SCROLLING SHOOTER\n\nPUBLISHER: ATARI\n\nDEVELOPER: ATARI\n\n1 OR 2 PLAYERS (SIMULTANEOUS)\n\n1977\n\nAIR-SEA BATTLE IS A TRUE TEST OF SKILL—THE BETTER PLAYER USUALLY WINS.\n\nA favorite of the late, great Bill The Game Doctor Kunkel, Air-Sea Battle was released the same day the Atari VCS (later called the Atari 2600) hit store shelves. With its pitch-perfect two-player simultaneous action and pick-up-and-play mentality, it was an excellent choice for a launch title and still holds up extremely well today.\n\nSporting 27 play variations, Air-Sea Battle consists of six different types of games, all of which involve aiming and shooting, and all of which are highly entertaining: Anti-Aircraft, Torpedo, Shooting Gallery, Polaris, Bomber, and Polaris vs Bomber.\n\nIn Anti-Aircraft games, each player points and shoots a ground-based gun at small jets, large jets, and helicopters flying horizontally overhead. Observation Blimps (a shape with the letter A inside) flying randomly across the bottom of the playfield yield no points when shot, but they do obstruct the players’ line of fire.\n\nTorpedo games are similar to Anti-Aircraft games, but instead of a gun that can be angled, players control a submarine that fires straight upward at PT boats, aircraft carriers, pirate ships, and freighters that move horizontally along the water up above. Unlike the gun base, the submarine can move right and left along the bottom of the screen.\n\nShooting Gallery variations are a cross of sorts between Anti-Aircraft games and Torpedo games. Players can adjust the angle of the gun (as in Anti-Aircraft) and they can maneuver the gun base back and forth (similar to the subs in Torpedo). The targets include rabbits, ducks, and clowns.\n\nKeeping the formula firmly intact, Polaris games have each player guiding a ship that travels across the bottom of the screen, shooting at small jets, large jets, and helicopters. Bomber variations change things up a bit by putting players at the helm of a plane flying across the top of the screen, dropping bombs on PT boats, aircraft carriers, pirate ships, and freighters.\n\nIn both Polaris and Bomber, players compete to shoot the most enemies; games end after 2 minutes, 16 seconds of play, or after either player scores 99 points. In Polaris vs Bomber, it’s pure head-to-head nirvana, with one player flying a bomb-dropping plane across the top of the screen while the other controls a missile-equipped ship along the bottom of the playfield. Depending on the option selected, mines can obstruct players’ lines of fire.\n\nAs with Combat, Pong, and other pure, undiluted, two-player simultaneous games, Air-Sea Battle is a true test of skill—the better player usually wins. To handicap the action, gamers can toggle the difficulty switches on the Atari console: in position A, the missiles players fire are one-fourth the size of those in position B. Another cool feature is that gamers can opt for guided missiles and bombs, which are maneuverable after they’ve been fired.\n\nLike all early Atari 2600 titles, Air-Sea Battle has primitive graphics. However, the airborne vehicles and boats are recognizable as such, and the blue background, which is dark at the top and gradually gets lighter toward the bottom, looks pretty neat for a game that came out in 1977.\n\nAnti-Aircraft Game in Air-Sea Battle for the Atari 2600.

Its introduction heralded the dawn of the age of true programmability because it was the first title that departed from the ball-and-paddle contests that ruled the roost back in 1978…Air-Sea Battle may be one of the oldest VCS cartridges, but it certainly hasn’t dated. It has, rather, aged gracefully and is still one of Atari’s outstanding software selections.\n\nOn a far less positive note, Walter Lowe, Jr., author of Playboy’s Guide to Rating the Video Games (1982, PBJ Books), wrote that, Children may play it for hours, but adults will get bored with it pretty quickly. However, he contradicted himself a short time later when he called the guided-missile variations good party games and said that if you want to introduce a date to video games, this is a fun one to start with.\n\nIn an interview conducted by Scott Stilphen published on www.digitpress.com, Air-Sea Battle programmer Larry Kaplan (Kaboom!, Super Breakout) revealed how he came up with the idea for the game: \"Air-Sea Battle was based on an Atari coin-op called Anti-Aircraft [1975], he said. In those days, we just ripped off anything we could make work.\"\n\nIn that same interview, Kaplan shared some of the difficulties he had in designing Air-Sea Battle. The development process was a nightmare in the beginning, he said. We had a time share service we reached via a teletype to do our editing and assembling. Then we downloaded to a development kit that had only a display and some address switches. Extremely primitive and difficult to use, it made game programming even more difficult.\n\nIn Atari, Inc.—Business is Fun (2012, Syzygy Company Press), Kaplan further discussed the creation of the game. I discovered early that it was possible to reposition player objects during a screen (which is a frame of the TV picture), though that was not a consideration of the original design specs, he said. \"So by designing Air-Sea Battle, which had used horizontal bands of player objects, this programming technique was used as a cornerstone extensively with many VCS games. Without that single strobe, H-move, the VCS would have failed as a game platform very quickly.\"\n\nAs fans of the cartridge well know, if you’ve only played Air-Sea Battle against the computer, you haven’t truly played Air-Sea Battle.\n\nDave The Video Game Critic Mrozek (videogamecritic.com) summed up the two-player appeal of the game thusly: \"It may not be much to look at, but Air-Sea Battle is an unadulterated head-to-head shooting game. In some ways it’s only as good as the people at the controls. Playing it casually against a friend (or the ultra-lame CPU) just isn’t going to cut it. It’s only properly played between two enraged, testosterone-laden males willing to put everything on the line! As the trash talk begins to flow, Air-Sea Battle really comes into its own.\"\n\nIf you don’t have an Atari 2600, you can play Air-Sea Battle on such compilation discs as Atari Anthology! (2004, PS2, Xbox) and Atari Classics: Evolved (2007, PSP). It’s also built into Atari Flashback consoles 1 and 3. In 2010, Microsoft made Air-Sea Battle available as a downloadable title for the Xbox 360 Game Room service.\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nWith the title changed to Target Fun, Air-Sea Battle was the original pack-in game with the Sears Tele-Games version of the Atari 2600 console.\n\nWHY IT MADE THE LIST:\n\nLike Combat and Video Olympics, Air-Sea Battle offers fair, competitive, two-player action that never gets old.\n\nAntarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision, complete in box.

Smith. $50.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nANTARCTIC ADVENTURE\n\nCOLECOVISION\n\nGENRE: CHARACTER RACING\n\nPUBLISHER: COLECO\n\nDEVELOPER: KONAMI\n\n1 PLAYER\n\n1984\n\nEVERYTHING ABOUT THIS GAME IS GOOD. THE MUSIC IS PERFECT. THE GRAPHICS ARE SMOOTH, DETAILED, AND COLORFUL.\n\nHardcore gamers and macho joystick jockeys alike may wonder why I would include a cutesy penguin racing game in a book called The 100 Greatest Console Video Games: 1977–1987. The answer, my testosterone-fueled, troglodytic friends, is simple: because it is one of the greatest games of the Golden Age.\n\nYou don’t race penguins in Antarctic Adventure. Rather, you are a penguin (unnamed in this game, later called Penta), sliding and gliding down twisting, turning, ice-covered pathways to the tune of Émile Waldteufel’s The Skaters’ Waltz, which plays in an endless loop. I’ve heard some gamers complain that this music gets old after extended play, but it’s never bothered me in the least. In fact, I like it quite a bit. It’s an upbeat, catchy, circus-like song that fits the action very well.\n\nThe view in Antarctic Adventure evokes a slower Pole Position, with players watching the action from behind the penguin (as opposed to behind a formula-one racer). Pressing up on the joystick makes the penguin go faster while pressing down slows the flightless fowl. The penguin can also jump, which sets the game apart from most racers.\n\nAs the penguin skates his way to his destination, obstacles in the form of small ice puddles and wide ice crevasses appear on the track. Seals intermittently pop out of puddles, adding to the challenge. If the penguin hits a puddle or a seal, he’ll skitter to the side, wasting precious seconds. If he falls in a crevasse, you must help him climb out.\n\nAs you approach the aforementioned holes in the ice, they appear to get larger, and part of the challenge is determining whether you should skate around or jump over them, and when it’s necessary to slow down. If you slow down too often (by purposely skating slower or by hitting too many obstacles), time will run out and you won’t reach your goal, bringing the game to an abrupt end (you only get one life).\n\nSo, what is your goal in this game, you may be wondering? The track in Antarctic Adventure circles the South Pole and is comprised of 10 sections (some much longer than others), each of which ends in a quick stay in front of an Antarctic ice station. When the penguin reaches a station, he turns around and waves his little flipper, and a flag will go up on the station building. After this brief, but charming, intermission, it’s off to the races again. If you manage to circle the South Pole (i.e., make it to the last station) the cycle repeats itself, but at a more difficult pace.\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, keeping a fast pace is important to staying alive, especially deep into the game. Skating fast also racks up big points. Other ways to make your score soar include capturing green flags as they appear along the pathways and catching flying red fish as they leap up from holes in the ice. However, you should be careful not to let these goodies distract you from the primary goal: to reach the station before the timer runs out. Stations, in order, are as follows: Australia, Australia, France, New Zealand, South Pole, U.S.A., U.S.A., Argentina, United Kingdom, and Japan.\n\nAntarctic Adventure game cartridge. $15.\n\nAntarctic Adventure instruction manual. $5.\n\nAntarctic Adventure foldout poster. Courtesy of Digital Press (digitpress.com). $12.\n\nThe original Antarctic Adventure was released by Konami in Japan in 1983 for the MSX computer. I’ve never played Kekkyoku Nankyoku Daibōken (as it was called), but I can tell you that after watching a YouTube video of the MSX game in action, the ColecoVision cartridge is an excellent, extremely faithful port. The crisp, cute graphics—stark white and rich hues of blue, complemented by playful penguin animations—are fully intact, as is the memorable music. More importantly, gameplay appears to be the same.\n\nIn issue #27 (Sept./Oct., 1995) of the Digital Press fanzine, longtime gaming enthusiast Jeff Cooper said, \"Everything about this game is good. The music is perfect. The graphics are smooth, detailed, and colorful. Antarctic Adventure helps cement the ColecoVision’s reputation as the very best of the classic video game systems.\"\n\nIn the seventh edition of the Digital Press Collector’s Guide (2002), Joe Santulli said the game is a top 10 for the ColecoVision and that it has the best graphics the system ever saw and a quality (albeit repetitive) soundtrack.\n\nIn 1985, Konami released Antarctic Adventure for the Famicom, which is the Japanese equivalent of the Nintendo NES. The music’s not as good in this version, but it does have an interesting addition in the form of flashing flags. If the penguin grabs a flashing flag, a beanie with a propeller will appear on his head, letting him fly for a limited time. In addition, the Famicom game has different flag colors—green, red, and blue (as well as flashing)—and two colors of fish: red and green.\n\nIn 1986, Konami released Penguin Adventure, a Japan-only sequel for the MSX. Designed by Ryouhei Shogaki and Hideo Kojima (Metal Gear, Metal Gear Solid), Penguin Adventure added numerous elements to the formula, including boss fights, mini-games, purchasable items (including a gun), different environments (forest, caves, outer space, water), multiple endings, and multiple pathways.\n\nEver since I got my ColecoVision console in the Christmas of 1982, I’ve had a ColecoVision hooked up to my television set (I’ve gone through four units). As such, I’ve logged many an hour on Antarctic Adventure. My kids have enjoyed it as well, especially when they were in elementary school and called it The Penguin Game.\n\nAntarctic Adventure starts off easy (unlike most ColecoVision titles, there is no difficulty level selection screen), but it does present a challenge later on as more seals and more holes appear. It’s especially tough to reach all 10 stations more than once, a goal I always shoot for when I play the game.\n\nI’m a big fan of such hardcore classic racers as Pole Position, Turbo, and Bump ’n’ Jump, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed such slickly modern racing titles as Gran Turismo, Rage Racer, and Burnout, but Antarctic Adventure, an unlikely character game starring a perky little penguin, will always get some play time at the Weiss household.\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nWhen Antarctic Adventure for the ColecoVision was released in stores, it came packaged with a foldout map poster, which is difficult to find in today’s collector’s market.\n\nWHY IT MADE THE LIST:\n\nChallenging, fun, and irresistibly cute, Antarctic Adventure appeals to gamers of all stripes, from young kids to grizzled racing fans willing to give it a chance.\n\nArkanoid instruction manual. $5.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nARKANOID\n\nNINTENDO NES\n\nGENRE: BALL-AND-PADDLE\n\nPUBLISHER: TAITO\n\nDEVELOPER: TAITO\n\n1 OR 2 PLAYERS (ALTERNATING)\n\n1987\n\nARKANOID’S SIMPLICITY IS ITS GREATEST STRENGTH, AND THE BREAKOUT FORMULA REMAINS SOLIDLY PLAYABLE TO THIS DAY.\n\nIn 1977, when I was 10 years old, my life changed forever. Okay, that’s a bit hyperbolic, but the year did have significance in terms of how I perceived video games. I was a huge pinball fan at the time, and I still love the silver ball to this day. However, when Atari’s Breakout (1976) showed up at my local arcade, I suddenly realized that pinball might have to take a backseat to video games.\n\nI had previously played and enjoyed Pong (Atari, 1972), Gun Fight (Midway, 1975), and a number of other arcade cabs, but Breakout was my breakout video game (so to speak)—I simply loved it. It took the basic idea of Pong and mixed it with something altogether new: the addictive and challenging notion of clearing groupings of similar items from the screen, a gameplay conceit that would be repeated again and again with the likes of Space Invaders, Asteroids, Tetris, and too many other titles to mention.\n\nIn 1986, Taito upped the ante with Arkanoid, a coin-op game that has players guiding a paddle (called a Vaus spacecraft) along the bottom of the screen, keeping a bouncing ball in play by rebounding it off said paddle so it will hit and eliminate bricks that are the building blocks of space walls. If the ball gets past the paddle, the player loses a life. The objective is to eliminate all the bricks. Programmed by Akira Fujita, Arkanoid adds dramatically to the Breakout formula by incorporating such elements as levels, power-ups, a boss named Doh, and a sci-fi storyline.\n\nArkanoid for the NES is a near-perfect port of the coin-op game, boasting 35 different block formations and a 36th screen featuring the aforementioned boss (the manual mistakenly claims there are only 33 rounds of play, probably because that’s how many are in the arcade version), which is a large face that must be hit 16 times to be destroyed. Once the boss has been vanquished, the game will end. It’s a shame the action doesn’t start over again at a more challenging pace, but this is a small gripe, as only the most skilled players will make it that far.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that gold bricks are indestructible. Also, floating obstacles frequently appear onscreen and will change the trajectory of the ball when hit. Certain bricks in the space walls contain color-coded power-ups, which fall when released and can be captured. Colors include orange (slows movement of ball), yellow/green (players can catch the ball and release it), light blue (splits ball into three balls), pink (opens warp escape to advance to next round), red (lets players shoot lasers at the bricks), gray (awards players with an extra paddle), and dark blue/purple (widens the paddle).\n\nThe power-ups and level progression add immeasurably to the already fun Breakout formula. Even more important is the fact that the home version of Arkanoid originally came packaged in an oversized box with a special controller featuring a rotary control knob. The knob is small, especially when compared to the paddle controllers used for playing Breakout on the Atari 2600, but it works flawlessly, giving players precise, quick, and smooth control over the Vaus spacecraft. Unfortunately, it’s hard to find the controller nowadays (the cartridge shows up for sale way more often than the controller), and the manual and box are pretty darned scarce as well.\n\nThe back of the Arkanoid box.\n\nArkanoid for the NES, complete in box. $125.\n\nArkanoid game cartridge. $10.\n\nLike all ball-and-paddle games, Arkanoid is less impressive from an audio/visual standpoint than the average platformer or adventure title, but it’s a good looking and sounding game nevertheless. The bricks making up the space walls are crisply drawn, the backgrounds aren’t distracting, and the shimmering effect when a gold brick is hit is a nice touch. The musical intro is inviting, as is the pinging sound the ball makes when it hits a brick or the paddle.\n\nIn The Video Games Guide by Matt Fox (2006, Boxtree), the author underrated the game a bit, giving it three out of five stars. However, he did say that \"Arkanoid’s simplicity is its greatest strength, and the Breakout formula remains solidly playable to this day.\"\n\nEric Bailey, writing for www.examiner.com, called Arkanoid a fantastic action puzzler that blends mind-bending puzzle strategy with tense on-screen action elements. He also said it’s a true classic, a worthy battle…a game that will be fondly remembered for a long time.\n\nTwo arcade sequels were produced in 1987: Tournament Arkanoid and Arkanoid: Revenge of Doh. These games were followed in 1997 by Arkanoid: Doh it Again for the Super Nintendo. Unfortunately, Doh it Again lacked rotary control, making the NES game far superior.\n\nArkanoid Returns, released to the arcades in 1997, only appeared in Japan.\n\nIn 2008, Arkanoid DS (2008) was released for the Nintendo DS. In 2009, two downloadable titles were produced: Arkanoid Live! for the Xbox 360 (via XBLA) and Arkanoid Plus for the Nintendo Wii (via WiiWare). In 2009, Arkanoid made it to the iPhone.\n\nClassic console games similar to Arkanoid include Breakaway (Arcadia 2001), Blockout!/Breakdown! (Odyssey2), Clowns/Brickyard (Astrocade), Flipper Slipper (ColecoVision), and Super Breakout (Atari 2600).\n\nFUN FACT:\n\nArkanoid was reviewed in issue #144 of the RPG magazine, Dragon (Oct., 1986), earning five out of five stars.\n\nWHY IT MADE THE LIST:\n\nSmooth rotary control, crisp graphics and sounds, and a slick updating of the Breakout formula make Arkanoid an A+ title for ball-and-paddle fans.\n\nArtillery Duel for the ColecoVision, complete in box. $115.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nARTILLERY DUEL\n\nCOLECOVISION\n\nGENRE: TURN-BASED STRATEGY\n\nPUBLISHER: XONOX\n\nDEVELOPER: XONOX\n\n2 PLAYERS (SIMULTANEOUS)\n\n1983\n\nASTROCADE\n\nGENRE: TURN-BASED STRATEGY\n\nPUBLISHER: ASTROCADE\n\nDEVELOPER: ASTROCADE\n\n2 PLAYERS (SIMULTANEOUS)\n\n1982\n\nGOOD, OLD-FASHIONED FUN [IN A] KILL-OR-BE-KILLED FORMAT.\n\nThey say that every dog has its day, and that is certainly true of Xonox, publisher of such dreck as the virtually unplayable Tomarc the Barbarian (Atari 2600, ColecoVision) and the laughably bad It’s Only Rock ’n’ Roll (ColecoVision). Xonox’s bright and shining moment was Artillery Duel for the ColecoVision, a masterful turn-based strategy game that isn’t terribly original (more on that later), but is a blast to play.\n\nAs the game begins, players are treated to the opening strains of The William Tell Overture, with an automatic paint program of sorts drawing randomly placed hills and trees on the screen, along with clouds overhead and snow-capped mountains in the background. Then artillery guns pop out of the ground (as if by magic), one on the left side of the playfield (player one) and the other on the right (player two).\n\nThe artillery guns face one another, and players must take turns lobbing shots back and forth to try and take out the opposing gun. During the aiming process, the player positions the angle of the barrel of the gun. It is preset to 60, but players can maneuver it between 90, which shoots straight up, and 00, which fires straight toward your opponent.\n\nGamers should also consider toggling the powder charge (between 00 and 99—70 is the default setting), which determines the strength of the shot. Wind plays an important role; arcaders are advised to take the strength (indicated by a wind speed indicator) and direction (indicated by moving clouds) of the wind into account when readying the artillery gun to fire.\n\nAnother key aspect of the game is the level of difficulty selected: Corporal gives you 59 seconds to adjust and fire your shot; Captain gives you 30 seconds; and General provides only 15 seconds. Unlike most ColecoVision games, Artillery Duel lets each player choose their own difficulty level, giving less skilled gamers a fighting chance.\n\nArtillery Duel moves slowly, which may annoy certain players. In addition to waiting for the other player to fire, you must watch as each bullet moves slowly toward its destination. For me, this only builds the excitement and anticipation of the possible impact of each shot fired, so I don’t mind the relaxed pace.\n\nIf you miss the target, your shot will hit a tree or part of a hill, destroying it incrementally. Sometimes you have to shoot through terrain to reach the enemy artillery gun. One direct hit will destroy that gun and start another round of play, with the loser getting to shoot first. The first person to score five kills wins the game.\n\nArtillery Duel instruction manual for the ColecoVision."
