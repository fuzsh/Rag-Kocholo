        "text": "No. 91; June 2017\n\nPlaying video games has become a popular activity for people of all ages. Video gaming is a multibillion-dollar industry bringing in more money than movies and DVDs. On average, girls spend more than an hour per day playing video games and boys spend more than two hours. Teens often spend even more time than younger children. Video games have become very sophisticated and realistic. Some games connect to the internet, which can allow children and adolescents to play games and have discussions with unknown adults and peers.\n\nWhile some games have educational content, many of the most popular games emphasize negative themes and promote:\n\nThe killing of people or animals\n\nThe use and abuse of drugs and alcohol\n\nCriminal behavior, disrespect for authority and the law\n\nSexual exploitation and violence toward women\n\nRacial, sexual, and gender stereotypes\n\nFoul language and obscene gestures\n\nStore-bought video games are evaluated by the Electronic Software Ratings Board (ESRB) and rated for their appropriateness for children and teens. The ratings are featured prominently on the game packaging.\n\nStudies of children exposed to violent media have shown that they may become numb to violence, imitate the violence, and show more aggressive behavior. Younger children and those with emotional, behavioral or learning problems may be more influenced by violent images.\n\nIn moderation, playing age-appropriate games can be enjoyable and healthy. Some video games may promote learning, problem solving and help with the development of fine motor skills and coordination. However, there are concerns about the effect of video games on young people who play videogames excessively.\n\nChildren and adolescents can become overly involved with videogames. They may have difficulty controlling the amount of time they play. They may resist their parents’ attempts to limit their time playing video games. Spending excessive time playing these games can lead to:\n\nLess time socializing with friends and family\n\nPoor social skills\n\nTime away from family time, school work, and other hobbies\n\nLower grades\n\nLess reading\n\nLess exercise and becoming overweight\n\nDecreased sleep and poor quality sleep\n\nAggressive thoughts and behaviors\n\nTips for Parents\n\nParents can help their children enjoy these video games appropriately and avoid problems by:\n\nAvoiding video games in preschool-aged children\n\nChecking the ESRB ratings to select appropriate games—both in content and level of development\n\nPlaying videogames with their children to share the experience and discuss the game’s content\n\nSetting clear rules about game content and playing time, both in and outside the home\n\nMonitoring online interactions and warning children about potential dangers of Internet contacts while playing games online\n\nAllowing video game playing only in public areas of the home, not in the child’s bedroom\n\nRemembering that you are a role model for your children including which video games you play and how long you play them\n\nEnforcing total screen time limits\n\nEnsuring video games are only played after homework and chores are done\n\nEncouraging participation in other activities, particularly physical activities\n\nIf you continue to have concerns about your child’s gaming habits or if your child is having difficulty with mood or behavior, ask your child’s pediatrician, family physician or school counselor to help arrange a referral to a trained and qualified mental health professional."
