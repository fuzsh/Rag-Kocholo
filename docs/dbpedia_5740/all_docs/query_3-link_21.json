They include their scores on Rotten Tomatoes, the region in which they were released (for foreign adaptations), approximate budget, their approximate box office revenue (for theatrical releases), distributor of the film, and the publisher of the original game at the time the film was made (this means that publishers may change between two adaptations of the same game or game series, such as Mortal Kombat). Also included are short films, cutscene films (made up of cutscenes and cinematics from the actual games), documentaries with video games as their subjects and films in which video games play a large part (such as Tron or WarGames). Films based on video games have garnered a negative reputation for their poor execution and poor grasp at the source material of the game each film is based on, and have traditionally garnered rotten Tomatometer rankings on Rotten Tomatoes. Currently, Pokémon Detective Pikachu and The Angry Birds Movie 2 are the only films on Rotten Tomatoes's Video Game Movies Ranked Worst to Best list to have received a fresh Tomatometer rating.[n 1] [1]\n\nTheatrical releases[]\n\nInternational (live-action)[]\n\nTitle Release date World wide box office Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic Distributor Original game publisher Super Mario Bros.
