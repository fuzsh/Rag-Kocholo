        "text": "Joe Johnston's The Rocketeer, a cult gem if there ever was one. The film was mismarketed by Disney when it came to theaters, forgotten on video and largely discarded by some moviegoers today, save for the dedicated fans who define their childhoods by this high-flying comic icon. The Rocketeer is a film in need of fans, though, lots of them. It deserves it. And sometimes the best way to find an audience is to borrow from another one. Which is confusing why Disney didn't capitalize on Joe Johnston's latest gig as the director of Captain America. Seems like a good idea to pop that credit on the cover art. Alas it's only mentioned, quickly, on the back of the box.\n\nFor those new to The Rocketeer, the film is based on a comic series of the same name. In the movie, we follow Cliff Secord (Bill Campbell), a young down-on-his-luck pilot with dreams of making a name for himself, and getting the girl of his dreams (Jennifer Connelly). When Cliff and his old friend (Alan Arkin) stumble upon a mysterious self-manned rocket pack, he soon realizes this could be his ticket. But several nefarious foes, from gangsters, to Nazis to Hollywood actors (Timothy Dalton) and Howard Hughes (Terry O'Quinn), are already after the rocket pack and might reach Cliff before he can figure out how the suit even works.\n\nThe Rocketeer is a great piece of old school vintage cinema that has aged quite well over the years. Johnston, his cast and his crew nail the film's 1930's aesthetic and tone. And the narrative keeps you on your toes, save for the somewhat sloppy middle act where things drag a little more than they should. The film might have flopped when it first got released, but The Rocketeer remains a beloved cult gem, and that's a title the film rightfully deserves.\n\nThe Rocketeer comes to Blu-ray presented in 1080p/AVC, mixed in 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio. The film is spread across a dual-layered BD50 disc. The digitally restored and remastered transfer is a giant leap over the previous DVD release. Color depth is much more defined, as are shadows and textures. The original shaky effect (during the blimp scenes) from the theatrical version of the film have been restored here, which is a nice added touch. The encode is fairly pristine â€“ no compression or ghosting noted. And the print is clean, save for a speck of dust every now and then. The image does flicker from time to time, and cinematography does favor a soft visual design, but neither is too distracting. This film looks pretty remarkable in HD.\n\nAudio is also a notch above the previous DVD. The high-res mix packs a punch, most notably during the film's flying/action set pieces. Dialogue rarely sports a crackle, and surrounds are fairly engaged throughout, though nowhere near as robust and impacting as a modern mix. While there's nothing truly stand-out about this mix, the track does provide an organic, impressive listening experience, especially considering the film's 20 years old now.\n\nSpeaking of turning 20, this Blu-ray is labeled the \"20th Anniversary Edition.\" Alas, that's merely a label. Disney skips out on any bonus material, save for the film's original theatrical trailer. Such a shame Disney didn't take the time to compile a featurette, or even a Johnston commentary. Perhaps when the film turns 30.\n\nIf you've yet to check out The Rocketeer, and you like a good old fashioned action-adventure, please do so now that the film has reached Blu-ray. If you're a longtime lover of the film, this release is a must-own. It's a shame the disc doesn't have any bonus features, but the film is bonus enough. I never thought this one would reach Blu-ray before some vintage classics, like Jaws or Indiana Jones, but I'm sure glad it did."
