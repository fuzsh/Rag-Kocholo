        "text": "According to The Wrap, Sylvie’s Love writer-director Eugene Ashe has signed on to pen the upcoming Disney+ reboot of 1991’s period superhero film The Rocketeer. This comes after over two years since the project was first announced.\n\nWho will lead The Rocketeer reboot?\n\nGolden Globe nominee David Oyelowo is currently still attached to lead The Rocketeer reboot, which he will also be producing alongside his wife Jessica Oyelowo, as part of their first-look deal with Disney. Before Ashe boarded the project, Ed Ricourt was enlisted to write the sequel, which will reportedly center around “a retired Tuskegee airman who takes up the mantle of the Rocketeer.”\n\nDirected by Captain America: The First Avenger filmmaker Joe Johnston, the original 1991 film was based on Dave Steven’s comic book character of the same name. It followed the story of a young stunt pilot named Cliff Secord, who becomes a superhero after finding a prototype jetpack. The cult classic starred Bill Campbell, Jennifer Connelly, Alan Arkin, Timothy Dalton, and Paul Sorvino.\n\nDespite receiving positive reviews, the film had a disappointing box office performance during its theatrical run. It only earned a domestic gross of over $46 million against a reported budget of around $35-40 million.\n\nBlake Griffin and Ryan Kalil’s Mortal Media are the executive producers."
