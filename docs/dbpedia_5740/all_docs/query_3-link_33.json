        "text": "Hollywood has tried to figure out how to successfully wade into the world of video games for decades, but a recent string of animated and live-action hits have demonstrated there is more demand than ever from fans to see exceptional adaptations and extensions of their favorite games.Â\n\nSony is moving forward with adaptations of its most popular franchises, includingÂ The Last of Us, God of War, Uncharted,Â and even nostalgic plays likeÂ Twisted Metal. There'sÂ HaloÂ series on Paramount+. Segaâs newÂ Sonic the HedgehogÂ movie secured nearly $400 million globally. Amazon found success withÂ Legends of Ex Machina. Nintendo has an animated Super Mario film due out this holiday season, and Ubisoft has a full partnership with Netflix to produce several series based on its games.Â\n\nAll leading to the very important question:Â Is now the time that Hollywood gets gaming right?\n\nSo Far So Good\n\nMuch like comic book IP in the earlyÂ â00s and into the 2010âs, gaming IP is the next well that studios, networks, and streaming services will mine for their next big hit. Most importantly, gaming studios and development teams will become more involved than ever before to the benefit of the final product.Â\n\nWeâve already started to see it play out on streaming services like Netflix, which in absence of owning top comics IP like Disney and WarnerMedia do, jumped on gaming.Â Arcane, Castlevania, PokÃ©mon, Dota: Dragonâs Blood, Digimon Adventure,Â andÂ Resident Evil: Infinite DarknessÂ all demonstrate good to outstanding demand worldwide. Of course, thereâs alsoÂ The Witcher, Netflixâs fantasy series thatâs technically based on a series of books by the same name, but is closely associated with the corresponding game series. These series are well-reviewed, unique adaptations or continuations of beloved digital worlds that created a cultural zeitgeist moment.\n\nThough audiences have seen countless film adaptations of massive gaming franchises over the last few decades âÂ Tomb Raider, Resident Evil, Doom, Max Payne,Â andÂ House of the DeadÂ â these were largely regarded as uninspired failed translations of the original story, focusing more on trying to make the most basic cinematic elements of the game work in a two-and-a-half passive format. More recent movie installments, including theÂ Sonic the HedgehogÂ franchise andÂ Detective PikachuÂ prove that creatives on the film side better understand how to adapt the stories for global audiences.\n\nThroughout all the attempts, however, one of the most popular video game adaptations in the world premiered, picked up, and has become one of the biggest cultural forces in the world for the last two decades âÂ PokÃ©mon.Â So how did an anime series about pocket monsters capture the worldâs attention beyond a video game and a competitive card series? More importantly, what canÂ PokÃ©monâs success tell us about the future of gaming adaptations and cinematic expansions?Â\n\nBetween 2022 and 2023, several new gaming expansions will arrive. HBO is getting in on the action to with its live-action adaptation of Naughty DogâsÂ The Last of Us, and Paramount Global will attempt to useÂ HaloÂ to bring swaths of subscribers to Paramount+, and Netflix hasâ¦well, letâs just say Netflix has a lot going on â including an adaptation ofÂ PokÃ©mon.Â\n\nIncorporating lessons from shows that did work likeÂ PokÃ©monÂ andÂ Arcane,Â while studying everything that did not work, there are four key facets that stand out when it comes to creating a successful gaming franchise at the height of demand:Â\n\nGoing Beyond The Typical Gaming Narrative\n\nOriginal Games Engines Can Translate Into Beautiful Linear Art\n\nRespecting The Original, But Subverting The Genre\n\nLeaves Room Open For Further Expansion and Adaptation With New TechnologiesÂ\n\nColor Outside the Lines\n\nâThe stories you didnât the chance to tell, or youâre thinking someday maybe this is the story we will tell...â\n\nThatâs howÂ ArcaneÂ co-creator Alex Yee described coming up with the show in a recent interview, noting that when cinematic shorts were made forÂ League of LegendsÂ in the past, they were based on a gaming perspective. How will players, looking for an interactive experience, receive a more passive form of entertainment. WithÂ Arcane, the opposite became true for Riot â how do they remove the gaming perspective to create an episodic experience thatâs enjoyable for anyone and everyone?Â\n\nItâs worked. Within just days of premiering â timed perfectly withÂ League of Legendsâ Championship match that saw more than 40 million people tune in âÂ ArcaneÂ saw its demand skyrocket. Its average demand is about 40x that of any other show in the world, putting it in the top 0.2% percentile of all series. At its peak, the show reached 53.5x the demand of other shows, making it on par with series likeÂ Stranger Things, Game of Thrones, WandaVision,Â andÂ Squid Game.Â\n\nInstead of trying to recreateÂ League of Legends,Â or adapting one storyline that players have somewhat seen play out over the yearsÂ (unlike heavy story games likeÂ UnchartedÂ orÂ The Last of Us, League of LegendsÂ didnât focus on building out the worldâs lore until relatively recently), Yee and co-creator Christian Linke worked outside the gameâs normal rules. Instead of trying to make everything feel fast pacedÂ (almost chaotic) and fill every moment with action, as the game does, Yee and Linke found strengths in dramatic pauses better associated with live-action dramas.Â\n\nArcaneÂ stars some characters that players would know, but its success comes from leaning into the connective spirit of the game, not trying to adapt it outright. Itâs the same reason thatÂ Castlevania, another Netflix original series based on CapcomâsÂ Castlevania IIIÂ from 1997, works so well. Instead of prioritizing winks, nudges, and nods to in-game moments, showrunner Adi Shankar and writer Warren Ellis use the game as a looser setting, deciding to spend more time building out the characters that the game couldnât allow for at the time.\n\nUnderstanding what works in what medium, and what can transfer well to another medium, is key to ensuring an adaptation pleases both fans and newcomers. This isnât singular to video games, but whereas adapting books into TV series or movies has required cutting outÂ lessÂ of the story to make it work in a 10 episode or two hour format, games require a fundamental shift of audience approach.Â\n\nThe joy a reader gets out of a book or TV show is often for the same reason: linear, passive storytelling. This doesnât automatically apply to games.Â HaloÂ can be enjoyed without knowing the story as friends go on multiplayer journeys together and appear in team battle royale situations. Game designers craft around a playerâs different wants in a game; showrunners and authors navigate a story.Â\n\nTo create a successful adaptation, the show or filmÂ hasÂ to incorporate elements of the game to make it feel truthful and less of an homage, but has to stand out on its own to succeed as an extended arm of the franchise for fans and a standalone series for newcomers. For example,Â CastlevaniaÂ andÂ ArcaneÂ lift elements and familiarities from the game, interweaving stories, characters, and settings, but ensure the focus is on building something new within the foundation, not just trying to recreate what already exists and works on a completely different platform.Â\n\nPokÃ©monÂ led the charge, creating an anime centered on Ash Ketchum as he made his way through the Johto Region collecting PokÃ©mon and battling gym leaders along the way. The gameâs focus was on ensuring the player, acting as the director, could explore on individual terms. Play for five minutes, or play for five hours; go from gym-to-gym to complete the main objectives or slow down and smell the flowersÂ (in the tall grass where wild PokÃ©mon could be caught).Â\n\nSelf-pacing storylines and exploration doesnât work in a TV show. Instead, anime as a medium and longform storytelling as creative direction broadenÂ PokÃ©mon.Â Players give up their directorial position and become a less active participant, watching Ash and his friends take on the role players are so used to inhabiting in the game.Â\n\nMost recently, Kiki Wolfkill, the executive producer behind Paramount+âs adaptation ofÂ HaloÂ announced that the series wonât be compliant with in-game canonical narrative. The team made the decision to protect the gameâsÂ âcore canon and protect the television story,â with Wolfkill adding this means beingÂ âable to give ourselves the chance to evolve both and for both to be what they need to be for their mediums without colliding with each other.âÂ\n\nConsider that the most in-demand genre of entertainment worldwide between September 17th and December 15th 2021 was dystopian content at nearly 10x the demand for any other genre, followed closely by apocalyptic series at 7x the demand for any other genre.Â Halo, as a video game, encompasses these genres, but focuses on the first-person shooter element, allowing players to explore and have more calculating experiences. By creating a new canonical narrative for the TV show,Â HaloÂ gets to shift in its expectations for a new audience.Â\n\nThis is similar toÂ PokÃ©mon.Â Without the added weight of trying to become the best trainer in-game, viewers can dive into more emotionally driven story arcs that seem plausible within that world.Â PokÃ©monÂ the anime gives fans and newcomers an accessible, curated introduction to the world. The barrier of entry is lowered, the characters, settings, and PokÃ©mon have more weight behind them, and the franchise finds new ways to entertain millions of people.\n\nÂ Engines Power AllÂ\n\nDemand for animated and anime series has grown exponentially over the last decade, especially with adults.Â\n\nGen Z and MillennialsÂ (14-34) are the demographics that consume the most entertainment, and theyâre also the two groups who grew up with animation as a core form of entertainment in their childhood and throughout their teenage years into adulthood. Whether itâsÂ The Simpsons, Family Guy, BoJack Horseman,Â andÂ Rick and Morty,Â toÂ NarutoÂ andÂ Cowboy Bebop,Â animation and anime has become a premium form of entertainment globally.Â\n\nPart ofÂ Arcaneâs success is in its animation, which looks completely different from any of its competitors. It was created using technology from a company called Fortiche Production and on an engine that Riot Gamesâ has used over the years several times for the companyâs ownÂ League of LegendsÂ cinematic shorts. The show, therefore, takes on the gameâs aesthetic, increasing the seriesâ feeling of authenticity among fans and creating a unique look for newcomers who have an interest in animation and anime.Â\n\nKomi Canât CommunicateÂ andÂ JuJutsu Kaisen,Â two Japanese anime series, share strong affinity withÂ ArcaneÂ (meaning those who watchedÂ ArcaneÂ also watchedÂ Komi Canât CommunicateÂ andÂ JuJutsu Kaisen).Â Resident Evil: Infinite DarknessÂ shares strong affinity withÂ Godzilla Singular Point,Â another Japanese anime. Most interesting, few shows about gaming overlap with one another affinity wise, suggesting that while there is inherent demand for individual shows based on gaming franchises,Â many viewers are coming from outside traditional gaming circles.Â\n\nConsider that gaming universes are constructed on intricate world building and fantastical concepts.Â Animation and anime can naturally achieve more than live-action can because there are fewer limitations and restrictions.Â For stories likeÂ ArcaneÂ orÂ DOTA: Dragonâs Blood, reconstructing and expanding the world feels more authentic within animation. Similarly,Â Castlevaniaâs anime style allows for creatives to reach horror effects that would cost 10x as much with live-action.Â PokÃ©monÂ would look far more terrifying as a live-action series mixed with CGI elements instead of classic, hand drawn 2D animation. That animation style has kept is as one of the most in-demand shows, with 70x the reach of other shows globally.Â\n\nGame enginesÂ (like Unreal and Unity) are becoming more powerful than ever. The quality in the worlds they create, and characters that players become attached too, have never looked as sophisticated and stylized. For entertainment companies like Netflix, Amazon, and WarnerMedia, all of whom are trying to figure out their way into the gaming adaptation space while also developing high quality animation slates, relying on the same technology back end that game studios use to entertain players globally helps create a cohesive aesthetic.Â\n\nWorking directly with the developers and the tools they use adds a layer of authenticity and uniqueness to a project.Â ArcaneÂ looks distinct from any of its competitors, whileÂ Resident Evil: Infinite DarknessÂ maintains the same visual style prevalent in the games and other animated cinematics that Capcom and its partners have released. With Unityâs recent acquisition of Weta Digitalâs technology divisionÂ (Peter Jacksonâs award-winning film software studio), the ability to create more realistic or more distinctive series while incorporating game features becomes more ubiquitous.Â\n\nPart of ensuring a gaming adaptation, live-action or animated, works is finding ways to work in authentic elements of the title. Unity and Unreal Engine, used to power animated series and premium live-action series likeÂ The Mandalorian, allows those elements to be integrated much more easily and create a cinematic but authentic experience for both newcomers and fans of the original game.Â\n\nRespectul Subversion\n\nThereâs a reason thatÂ Thor: RagnarokÂ is considered one of the best Marvel Cinematic Universe movies. Thereâs a reason thatÂ The BoysÂ became an instant hit for Amazon Prime Video, and thereâs a reason thatÂ Harley QuinnÂ is regarded as one of the most impressive DC TV series amongst fans. They subvert the genre.Â\n\nSuperheroes, and comic book stories in general, have reached an age where audiences know what the stereotypical tropes are. Games are in the same boat. The countless film adaptations of popular games over the last few decades may have left a stale taste in audiencesâ mouths. At the same time, the number of people who play games on both a casual and regular basis â and the demographics representing those players â has vastly grown and changed over the last decade. Much like how the games industry has subverted and reestablished its own genres, the television and film world is looking to mirror that evolution.\n\nJohannes Roberts, director of the Resident Evil filmsÂ Welcome to Raccoon City,Â told the AP he was approaching the film like he would adapting a Steven King novel. As more directors with critical acclaim approach adapting gaming adaptations, much like the comic book industry has seen with filmmakers like Chloe Zhao and showrunners like Damon Lindelof helming their own projects, the more individual it feels and the more room there is to play around with the look and feel of the title.Â\n\nGaming is Only Growing\n\nGaming is still seen as niche subject matter for filmmakers, which has led to pressure to create straight adaptations the source material. But consider that by 2024, gaming will reach $218 billion in revenueÂ (much higher than the film industry), according to the Associated Press, and people between the ages of 14 and 24 choose gaming as theirÂ preferred past time, according to an eMarketer report. Other consumers in their lateÂ â20s,Â â30s, and earlyÂ â40s, grew up with games and still regularly or casually play. These stories, much like certain comic book characters, are well known; they can be subverted because the underlying knowledge of fundamentals is recognizable.Â\n\nWhile looking at the audience demographic for some of the most recent animated and live-action gaming adaptations, we found that the majority of viewershipÂ trended toward Gen Z and MillennialÂ (14-34 years old) audience. Series likeÂ The WitcherÂ showed the strongest tracking of the shows listed below for Over 40, suggesting that live-action adaptations will play stronger with older consumers who might be more likely to cancel Netflix subscriptions as low engaged users.Â\n\nNotably,Â The WitcherÂ has aÂ definitively smaller gap in gender, followed by a noticeably smaller gap withÂ Arcane.Â On the other hand,Â DOTA: Â Dragonâs BloodÂ has the widest gap in gender breakdown. Alongside this breakdown, we can see demand forÂ ArcaneÂ andÂ The WitcherÂ greatly outpacesÂ DOTA: Dragonâs Blood.Â All three series are available on Netflix, butÂ DOTAÂ has a smaller player base thanÂ League of LegendsÂ (about 785,000 active monthly players in November 2021 compared to more htan 115 million active monthly players logging ontoÂ League of Legends.)\n\nKeeping that in mind, think of howÂ The WitcherÂ subverted the typical video game adaptation to make it more accessible to non-male, young and older audiences looking to dive into a fantasy series. Instead of focusing on how the world reacted to main character Geralt and his travels, as a game would do because the player takes on the role of a director, time was spent on developing key female characters like Yelena. Most importantly, these portrayals subverted both gaming and fantasy tropes by not just focusing on physical attributes or their relationship to Geralt. On December 17th,Â The WitcherÂ became the most in-demand series in the world upon its season two premiere, amassing 81x the average demand of all other series globally.Â\n\nSimilarly,Â ArcaneÂ took a game thatâs fundamentally about strategy and turned it into a story about sisterhood, relationships, and grief. Part of this is natural plot development; but Riot Games could have focused on a more male, typically sci-fi/fantasy arcÂ (again, which tend to lean predominantly male) and chose not to do so.Â\n\nFocusing on Vi and Powder, two sisters, allows the story to become much more global and resonate with viewers regardless of their interest in the actual game. WhenÂ ArcaneÂ moves into more general world-building more closely associated with fantasy television and video games, it loses some of its power as a TV show. The glue holding everything together is a relationship and real world emotions that donât get explored in the game.\n\nData from Parrot Analyticsâ showcases that dystopian series, as a genre, skews slightly more male, but fantasy skews slightly more female. Science fiction and animation skew slightly more male, with drama skewing much more toward female audiences. The gap between audiences in genres like animation is closing, however, as it becomes even more of a ubiquitous and mainstream platform. Getting away from pre-conceived notions of whatÂ hasÂ worked, and leaning into whatÂ couldÂ work by subverting everything audiences think about gaming adaptations.\n\nQuintessentially, these series donât detract from the games theyâre based on. Nor do they try and reinvent overarching facets of the worlds those games come from. Instead, they subvert.Â Detective PikachuÂ did the same thing, taking aÂ PokÃ©monÂ puzzle offshoot and turning it into a hybrid live-action/animated film enamored by the world Nintendo has fostered for more nearly 30 years while also poking light fun at the most obvious absurdities.Â\n\nAs Parrot AnalyticsÂ noted in a previous analysis about subversion in the comic book/superhero genre on television, gaming could learn from similar successes and apply them to new projects going forward to widen the audience net and creating something truly spectacular.Â\n\nOpen to More\n\nThe very nature of entertainment is changing. Mediums are morphing; something like Netflix, which was once a place for passive entertainment, is starting to embark on games in an attempt to be an entertainment home beyond TV and film.Â\n\nAs we move closer to a Metaverse reality, and as the lines between different forms of entertainment continue to blend, creating a new universe that can be watched passively and inhabited actively is the difference between a franchise that keeps peopleâs attention and demand, and those that donât.Â\n\nAt the heart of this conversation is the value of IP and how that IP is handled as more expansion arms appear. Does Disney become a destination for gaming, like Netflix wants to be, or continue licensing at a higher value while maintaining oversight of the final product to protect brand identity? The Metaverse will be powered by content and users interacting in way that builds upon what gaming and entertainment already have, blending online identity with fictional worlds that people want to inhabit.Â\n\nHere are some quick points about gaming and entertainment, including projections over the next few years:Â\n\nThe Metaverse could see a market opportunity of nearly $800 billion by 2024, according to Bloomberg Market ResearchÂ\n\nMovie and television premieres, as well as concerts with the most in-demand musicians in the world, are occurring within video games likeÂ Fortnite. Most recently,Â FortniteÂ hosted a short film festival with Universal Pictures.Â\n\nSome of the most in-demand entertainment across global platforms like YouTube and Twitch are coming from stories being created within games likeÂ MinecraftÂ andÂ Roblox,Â both of which have more than 100 million monthly active players\n\nCompanies like Netflix are exploring more virtual and augmented reality experiences to supplement shows, alongside physical experiences that create more real life connection to subscribersâ favorite series\n\nConsumers are getting their favorite linear stories in gaming universes, and passive entertainment sourcesÂ (like watching TV or movies) are becoming more interactive â just look at Netflixâs foray into choose-your-own-adventure programming.Â\n\nGaming adaptations, much like comic book stories, have the possibility to introduce consumers to an entirely new world of content they can explore after the credits roll. AfterÂ The WitcherÂ premiered in 2019, CD Projekt Red saw a new record for PC gamers logging on to playÂ The Witcher 3Â (92,268 players logged in when the game was released in May 2015, and 94,601 people played on December 30th, 2019 â ten days afterÂ The WitcherÂ premiered on Netflix).Â\n\nPublishers and studios like Ubisoft, Naughty Dog, Sony, and Microsoft are teaming with entertainment partners to try and achieve similar results, much like how Disney partnered with Epic Games to ensure that Marvel characters were always on audienceâs minds, no matter what they were doing. Thinking about how these relationships, which often first take form in adaptations, can help propel two different businesses right now that are quickly becoming much more intertwined.Â\n\nArcaneÂ and Riot Gamesâ Relationship with Netflix\n\nNetflixâs integration of games on the platform is both an attempt to protect its core assetÂ (more time spent on the platform takes attention away from competitors) and increase retentionÂ (or reduce churn) in the process. Thereâs no extra cost, so it feels like anÂ âextraâ for every subscriber, and therefore may encourage more people to check out the offering. While this is just step one for NetflixÂ (the goal, according to COO Greg Peters, is to eventually branch out and make games that could exist outside of the Netflix app), it sets the groundwork for what Netflix needs.Â\n\nIf a show on Netflix can encourage fans to check out some of the early games Netflix has released, could the opposite happen?Â Could a game encourage other subscribers to check out a show?Â\n\nEnterÂ Hextech Mayhem.Â The rhythm game from Riot Games sees players take control of twoÂ League of LegendsÂ champions â Ziggs and Heimerdinger â as they move around their phone screen in time with in-game music. While the game costs $10 to players outside of NetflixÂ (on Epic Games Store and Steam), itâs free for all Netflix customers with access to games on their devices.Â\n\nHextech MayhemÂ is a game that stands on its own as an experience, but fans ofÂ ArcaneÂ will also know that Heimerdinger is a character within the series. This is a faceÂ (and voice) they know. Itâs a character theyâve spent several hours with over the course of nine episodes. Having a game with an interlocking connection to the TV show is another way of boosting awareness and interest in the game.Â Hextech MayhemÂ also features locations thatÂ ArcaneÂ fans will knowÂ (the city of Piltover), where Zigg first meetsÂ Arcaneâs main character, Jinx.Â\n\nAlex Neuse, co-founder of Choice Provisions, which developedÂ Hextech MayhemÂ told TechRadar that expandingÂ League of LegendsÂ in a format that was different than the main gameÂ (going from a MOBA to a rhythm title) wouldÂ âexpand the League of Legends oeuvre to include forays into less serious territory.âÂ\n\nâIf weâre expanding the universe, letâs go where it has never gone before, you know?â Neuse said. The same could be said of Netflixâs gaming ambitions.Â\n\nThe Metaverse and room for entertainmentÂ\n\nOne core difference between Netflixâs gaming ambitions as they currently stand and Disneyâs is that Netflix is both building a platform that games exist onÂ (similar to a marketplace like Apple Arcade) while Disney is licensing out its IP to publishers and developers who can use globally recognized characters and worlds to create billion dollar franchisesÂ (see: EAâsÂ Battlefront).Â\n\nNetflixâs entry into games will start with ownership. The company is acquiring small studios to make games exclusively for Netflixâs platform right now. This will likely broaden into developing games for partners like Microsoft Xbox and Sony PlayStation, but the goal is to increase time spent with Netflix, on Netflix â consistently thinking about Netflix. Itâs a way to strengthen the IP for an entirely different audience.Â\n\nDisneyâs Metaverse ambitions will likely incorporate forms of interactive entertainment we think of as gaming right now, but licensing out its IP to some of the best gaming studios and publishersÂ (EA, Respawn, Epic) can save on overall investing into the traditional gaming space while still commanding top dollar for lending out characters, franchises, and worlds that consumers love globally.Â\n\nBoth, however, are trying to accomplish a similar goal: use interactive experiences and gaming to determine viable new ways to reiterate their core IP to consumers of the future. Itâs similar to what Matthew BallÂ noted in an essay about Travis Scottâs concert performance onÂ Fortnite,Â which drew 12 millionÂ âviewers.â\n\nâEpic is a game engine companyÂ (Fortnite too). These tests are about finding out what's interesting & viable, financing R&D thatâs also great marketing, showing the world what they can build on.â\n\nAs we move closer to aÂ âMetaverseâ â the next iteration and successor to our current internet model thatÂ (in a very loose definition) incorporates a variety of factors including digital ownership through cryptocurrency, virtual/augmented reality, and real-time experiences â entertainment becomes much more of an overlap between passive and interactive. Itâs partially why Facebook listed Snapchat, Sony, Roblox, and Epic as part of theÂ âfierce competitionâ itâll face in building the Metaverse.Â\n\nRight now, Sony is developing about ten different adaptations of its video games, from movies likeÂ UnchartedÂ to TV series likeÂ Twisted MetalÂ andÂ The Last of Us. Through a program calledÂ âOne Sony,â the goal is to integrate many of the Sony companies together to produce work that brings more attention â and revenue â to each of their divisions, according to Sony Pictures chief Tony Vinciquerra. Sony has the platformÂ andÂ the content to create a universe where adaptations and video games help to reiterate the importance and prominence of that IP in the eyes of consumers.Â\n\nSony PicturesâÂ Spider-ManÂ trilogy has grossed more than $3 billion, and Insominac GamesâÂ Spider-ManÂ title from 2018 generated more revenue in its first weekendÂ ($198 million) thanÂ Spider-Man: HomecomingÂ did in its 2017 debut weekendÂ ($119 million). In 2020, Sony bought Insomniac Games for $227 million â and just recently,Â Spider-Man: No Way HomeÂ earned more than $560 million in its opening weekend. Insomniacâs sequel to 2018âsÂ Spider-ManÂ game is due out in two years.Â\n\nAlternatively, gaming studios can partner with companies like Facebook, Netflix, HBO Max, or Apple TV+ to carry out different adaptations, and ideally bring in new players. If a company like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, or Apple also has a platform for games to live on, the deal is even sweeter. For Facebook, a company trying to carry some of the biggest IP that can draw in consumers looking for passive and interactive entertainment offerings, gaming adaptations and gaming spinoffs are the perfect place to start.Â\n\nâWe really think of our TV series and films as another doorway for people to enter,â Danielle Krenick, a development executive at Ubisoft, toldÂ VarietyÂ in 2019.Â âThere really is no baseline of knowledge that they have to have coming in.â\n\nTo Rememberâ¦\n\nDeciphering what can help make a quintessential title for gaming and non-gaming fans alike, how to use pre-existing technology to make those visions work, and how to incorporate future play time into the series or movie for diehard fans who want to explore more is integral to coming out on top as adaptations start to flood the market. Itâs an exciting time for game developers and studios alike, but there will also be an influx in competition.Â\n\nThe nextÂ PokÃ©monÂ is right around the cornerÂ (it may have beenÂ Arcane), but as gaming becomes even more mainstream and audiences seek out those stories in both passive and interactive entertainment arenas, watching what works and what doesnât will be crucial to expanding the genre for years to come."
