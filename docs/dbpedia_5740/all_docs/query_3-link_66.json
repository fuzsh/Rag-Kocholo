        "text": "There is an intense intersection between movie and their video games. Have you imagined why Nigerian movies might not ultimately appeal for the constant production of highly appealing video games? Or does it mean that we lack local game programers who wouldn’t love to invent games to represent our local cinema culture. I ask again.\n\nFor instance, a popular movie like “Living In Bondage,” the Nigerian set initially released around 1992. Does it mean it can not appeal to gamer(s) [Game lovers] if re-invented as a video game. “Imagine that,” just like Styl Plus sang, alluding to a great carefree and party lifestyle from their 2006 record off the critical-acclaim “Expression” album. During 2000s, the top tier Nigerian music band group of four members redefined R&B on mainstream level.\n\nBack to the intersection between games and movies within pop culture. Perhaps, the role of video games on our local culture, could be to assist us to fully represent and portray various elements of our home videos to appeal a larger consensus.\n\nImagine when some local Nigerian films begin to come in handy via video games. Partly, it could unveil or have certian local representation of the Nigerian culture. Because there is a thin line between movies and there game productions obviously. Whether you believe it or not, it is real and it also plays a vital role within pop culture. It has either negative or positive impact on the consumers (consensus).\n\nSeveral people who see movies might find the games of those movie greatly interesting. However, they might perceive both pop culture component; the movie and game differently. It is apparently everyone’s disparity and perhaps also how we can learn from each other and further gain peculiar ideas in the same process. We have people who could always invest much more time in gaming. Alot of people who might also love soccer games might not be strong fans of arcade games or boisterous action or adventurous games.\n\n“For me, I love football games more than any game” Kingsley, namesake to this writer confesses during our brief conversation. Pointing out their various intersections. The heroic movie like Spiderman first released around August 1962, gave culture generally a breath of fresh air at the time to date. The movie and DC comics at the time played several roles in the lives of both young teenagers and adult ardent movie explorers. Apart from assisting them see live and the world through the lens of being heroic and noble and also embracing villain; perhaps being appreciative of self and exploring ones ability whether to manifest positivity or the opposite. Also, it comes more practically by inspiring viewers into putting those abilities and natural gifts in due use to affect humanity (majorly through arts or science).\n\nFor the Spiderman movie at the time, it offered movie lovers a fresh view of live generally. Although, Peter Parker’s spider web ability was not an inborn gift, and that never stopped him from saving the day often when he could.\n\nThe DC comics as well which appealed more to the younger generations, who would still have their own view of the world no matter how minute. The game consoles were also published and those gamers who often invests more interest on adventure games or love arcade and action oriented games would as well perceive the product through a different lens. They too can tell a peculiar story.\n\nFor your information, all of this intersection would spur our creativity differently. Due to the fact that we reason and always see things from various points, the relationship we have or might have choosen to share with one another becomes peculiar to us ranging from this few components sorrounding pop culture. Our experiences also differs.\n\nAlways, there has been this strong fascinating element and a potential excitement whenever genuine movie lovers tend to approach the world of those movies within the video games planet. There is literally alot of criss-crossing between this both worlds. With movies you can perceive the world differently and with the game consoles whether for mobile devices or PlayStation devices, XBox, VR and more everyone would see the world differently; the point is you just have to make sure you are affecting lives through these pop culture streams positively."
