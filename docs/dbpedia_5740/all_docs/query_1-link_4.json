Participate in several action sequences that mimic the same sequences in the movie, like racing a plane, a shootout in a warehouse, and hand-to-hand combat on top of a flying blimp.\n\nSound\n\nWhile The Rocketeer supported many different sound cards, the demo sent to retail stores only supported the Disney Sound Source. This was intentional--in addition to selling the game itself, they wanted to sell more Sound Sources to people who didn't have sound devices. Along this vein, all digitized sound in the game was mastered with the Disney Sound Source in mind; it sounds just as good or better on a Sound Source as it does a Sound Blaster or other device, even though the Sound Source is just an LPT DAC with slight filtering.\n\nAwards\n\nEGM\n\n1993 Buyer's Guide - Worst Movie to Game"
