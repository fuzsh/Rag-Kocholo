        "text": "Should I grind out that sabotage mission, and over-level myself for the boss fight? Because if I lose that grind mission, oh yes, I am going to lose my Epic revolver and Legendary, one-hit kill marksman rifle, and start over with Common crap. And that’s going to require even more grind. So, really, when should I take on this boss?\n\n— Owen S. Good, Polygon, 16 Feb. 2023\n\nIk when i was on the task before the boss there were husks i killed them all but didnt count so the boss came and i killed him then after i did the husks came again and the quest of the husks counted but when the quest of the boss came he was no longer there as i killed him\n\n– (comment on Discord server) 12 Feb. 2023\n\nIt's no different in the modern era of online and console gaming -- some of the most iconic cheats in videogame history were put there by the person making the game itself. The Konami Code (up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, start) is perhaps the most well known cheat code in gaming history. It was added to 1985's Gradius for the NES by the game's developer, Kazuhisa Hashimoto, who found the game to be too difficult during its debugging phase.\n\n— Andrew Tarantola, Engadget, 15 Jun. 2019\n\nThe one complaint that remains from the open beta — agents who lurk on the subreddit for \"The Division\" will know what I'm talking about — are the weapon mods. Many of them still apply a damage debuff in exchange for improved handling. It's an awful design that will end up discouraging players from using mods at all, particularly at higher levels when extra damage to elite enemies becomes vital.\n\n— Brian Fung, The Washington Post (online), 14 Mar. 2019\n\nA group may, for example, involve a tank, as a character who absorbs enemy blows and protects other members of the team; a healer, as a character responsible for keeping up the health of the party; characters which inflict damage (often referred to as DPS, meaning Damage Per Second); and those who temporarily control the mobs and make them lose control of actions and abilities (Crowd Control, or CC, characters).\n\n— Mirko Suznjevic et al., Multimedia Tools and Applications, Oct. 2009\n\nOptiFine is a mod for Minecraft that helps improve the performance of the game. It can be installed just like any other Minecraft mod, and once installed, it provides players with a range of performance-enhancing options that can help boost the game's FPS (frames per second).\n\n— The Hindustan Times (New Delhi, Ind.), 10 Feb. 2023\n\nThe online gaming frequency varied between countries and was higher in Germany, Finland, and the US, comprising first person shooter (FPS) games, multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) games, and massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs).\n\n— Olatz Lopez-Fernandez et al., Problematic Internet Use among Adults: A Cross-Cultural Study in 15 Countries, in Journal of Clinical Medicine (Basel, Sw.), 2023\n\nSadly, the game has an infamous mission -- Doppelganger -- that forces you to endure all of the most obdurate cliches of stealth games. Like crawling, on hands-and-knees, behind a guard as they wander about on their patrol and timing your moves to perfection. It's the sort of challenge that I despise, especially since it's so inflexible, so I ragequit the game and never played again.\n\n— Daniel Cooper, Engadget, 31 Mar. 2019\n\nEver wanted a nice documentary to just sit you down and introduce you to the world of speedrunning? Well, wish fulfilled, because Running With Speed has just released, a documentary that dives into story of what speedrunning is, who speedrunners are, and how their culture has developed. It follows some notable and famous speedrunners, telling their stories both past and present.\n\n— Jonathan Bolding, PC Gamer, 8 Jan. 2023\n\nA group may, for example, involve a tank, as a character who absorbs enemy blows and protects other members of the team; a healer, as a character responsible for keeping up the health of the party; characters which inflict damage (often referred to as DPS, meaning Damage Per Second); and those who temporarily control the mobs and make them lose control of actions and abilities (Crowd Control, or CC, characters).\n\n— Mirko Suznjevic et al., Multimedia Tools and Applications, Oct. 2009"
