        "text": "The certainties in life: death, taxes, and the assurance that if a movie is based on a video game, that movie will probably suck. The highest-rated video game movie of all time on Rotten Tomatoes is Detective Pikachu at a 68 percent. The average is somewhere around 35. In our hearts, the mean is 0.\n\nNow, the failure has absolutely nothing to do with the video game medium. Plenty of games offer rich narrative experiences that—even if just adopted shot for shot—would make for a perfectly acceptable film. Which makes decisions to deviate from great source material inexplicable. (We’re looking at you, Assassin’s Creed—which has enough material for a very solid 8-season television series. There was only one group getting a hidden blade to the throat and that was the audience.) So instead of developing quality existent video game narratives, Hollywood has decided to ride do-nothing franchises like Tomb Raider and Resident Evil into the dirt and mire first-rate actors—Michael Fassbender, Jake Gyllenhaal, Alicia Vikander, Timothy Olyphant—in filthy mediocrity.\n\nThe good news is that recent years have probably given us the best of the genre. (We know, the bar is low.) Netflix's The Witcher series has taken as many cues from the novel series as the Geralt of the video games. And we have high hopes for upcoming projects, including HBO’s adaptation of The Last of Us and Tom Holland’s Uncharted."
