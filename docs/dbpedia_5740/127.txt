Combining movies and video games is like mixing peanut butter and jelly – the outcome can either be a delightful treat or a bit of a mess. When it's done right, the best video games based on movies let fans explore their favorite cinematic worlds in new, interactive ways. These games take the narratives, settings, and characters from films and expand them into immersive gaming experiences that add depth to the stories we thought we knew. But when it's not done right, you end up with major fails like Bad Boys: Miami Takedown or Fight Clubm – absolute disasters that are insulting to the source material.

When looking back at the various movie-based games that have graced our consoles and PCs, there are a few standouts that effectively capture the essence of their movie counterparts. From alien invasions to epic quests, these games offer a range of genres and styles to suit every gamer's preference.
