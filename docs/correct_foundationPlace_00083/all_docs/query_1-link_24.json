        "text": "Software provides means to hear millions of calls\n\nRUTHERFORD, N.J. -- If you've ever\n\nhad the feeling that the customer service representative at the other end of\n\nthat toll-free number was not really paying attention, you might be right. But\n\nthey probably won't get away with goofing off for much longer.\n\nNew call monitoring software is\n\nallowing companies check up on their employees and identify those who are playing\n\ncomputer solitaire, job hunting or even viewing pornography instead of helping\n\ncustomers.\n\nReel-to-reel tape has allowed employers\n\nto monitor calls for years, but the new programs work at a much faster rate\n\nand don't require humans to listen in. Software can be programmed to key in\n\non certain words, such as obscenities or a competitor's name, or keep track\n\nof call times and origins. A computer can even alert a supervisor to join a\n\ncall if it becomes a bit heated.\n\n''I don't believe there are limitations\n\non what they can measure,'' said David Spindel, an analyst at Datamonitor, a\n\nmarket research firm.\n\nSales of call monitoring software\n\nreached $323 million last year, up 16 percent from 2001, and are projected by\n\nDatamonitor to reach $538 million in 2007.\n\nFinancial services company Conseco\n\nInc. installed a system in late 2002 to help analyze its 55,000 weekly calls,\n\nand has revised its training of customer service reps as a result, said Don\n\nPapp, director of the life insurance and annuities call center.\n\n''We've been able to go in there\n\nand identify trends'' so managers no longer have to make assumptions based on\n\nspot checks, he said.\n\nThe biggest provider of such computer\n\nprograms is NICE Systems Inc., an Israeli company with offices in Rutherford.\n\nIts products are used by hundreds of companies in about 60 nations, NICE said.\n\nNICE accounted for nearly a quarter\n\nof the sales of call recording software, followed by Witness Systems Inc. and\n\nVerint Systems Inc., according to Datamonitor figures for the first quarter,\n\nthe most recent period available.\n\nWitness, which does business in\n\nabout 40 countries, is based in Roswell, Ga. Verint, which says its software\n\nis used in more than 50 nations, is based in Melville, N.Y., and is a subsidiary\n\nof Comverse Technology Inc.\n\nNICE's big customers include FedEx,\n\nCarnival Corp. and the Federal Aviation Administration, which uses the system\n\nto record all conversations between pilots and air traffic controllers at nearly\n\n700 control towers and radar rooms across the nation.\n\n''The advantage there, is you can\n\ngo to any point on the digital recording to listen, and the quality is better''\n\nthan the magnetic tape the FAA had used, agency spokesman Jim Peters said.\n\nIn many cases, customers are notified\n\ncomputer-monitoring is in place by an announcement stating, ''This call may\n\nbe recorded for quality control or training purposes.''\n\nThe increased recording of consumer\n\ncalls has not prompted complaints to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit\n\ngroup concerned with digital rights, senior staff attorney Lee Tien said. But\n\nhe questioned whether the announcement at the start of calls is enough, since\n\nmany call centers offer no alternative if callers do not wish to be recorded.\n\nRecordings also need to be secure, he said.\n\nSoftware companies say the recordings\n\nare encrypted, cannot be altered, and can only be played on special software.\n\nMost companies destroy the recordings after a few weeks, although in some cases\n\nthe tapes are kept longer to comply with securities industry and other regulations.\n\nFor all their strengths, though,\n\nsoftware data systems still require a human touch -- and human interpretation.\n\nOscar Alban, a consultant for Witness\n\nSystems, recalled a company that wanted to determine if any of its sales agents\n\nwere cursing at the customers.\n\nSure enough, the Witness software\n\nshowed one woman was regularly using rough language -- but in this case that\n\nwasn't a bad thing. The saleswoman was the No. — seller of the company's products,\n\nwhich were computer programs for law enforcement agencies.\n\n''She wasn't swearing at customers,\n\nshe was mirroring the type of communication that they were using, and they felt\n\ncomfortable with her,'' Alban said.\n\nThe saleswoman continued in her\n\njob, but not the agent at a financial services company whom the software red-flagged\n\nfor his long calls with customers.\n\n''He was actually doing Web chat\n\non the topic of pigs,'' Alban said. ''He was in the Web chat room, just going\n\nat it, and he refused to help the customer until he was done.''\n\nINFOBOX:\n\nOn the Net\n\nNICE Systems: www.nice.com\n\nVerint Systems: www.verintsystems.com/corporate/index.cfm\n\nWitness Systems: www.witness.com\n\nGRAPHICS.
