        "text": "Ace fund manager Walter Price finds some good technology stocks are on Wall Street's losers list for the wrong reasons.\n\nOne reason Walter C. Price Jr. runs a star tech fund is that he is devilishly good at spotting beaten-down stocks that don't deserve their ignominy.\n\nIn 2006 and thus far in 2007 Price's Allianz RCM Technology has consistently turned in the best-ranked ten-year performance for a tech fund, says fund tracker Morningstar. Its recent ten-year annual return: an exceptional 16.1%. The MIT-educated Price, 58, has been with San Francisco's RCM Capital Management since 1974. He runs the fund with comanager Huachen Chen for RCM's parent, asset manager Allianz Global Investors, which is part of German financial powerhouse Allianz .\n\nTech stocks have staged a comeback of sorts after their dark night of the soul earlier in the decade, although they lag behind many other sectors. In 2006 the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite posted a 9.5% return, versus the broad-market S&P 500's 13.6%. In this year's rockier market, the two indexes are doing similarly, each up some 5%.\n\nPrice looks for fallen angels--companies that used to sport robust, double-digit earnings growth, only to stumble for a quarter or acquire some black mark, like an options scandal. Some of these will resume their growth records. Which ones? \"It's a little bit of a venture capital mentality,\" says Price.\n\nHis fund has a large swatch of mainstream tech names like Nintendo , Cisco and Google . But it's in midcaps (generally defined by RCM as $1 billion to $15 billion in market value) that Price trolls for the surprise winners. Midcaps make up half of the portfolio.\n\nHelping in the search is RCM's Grassroots Research division, which specializes in ground-level examinations of company operations. This is vital because it requires clearing the fog of bogus enthusiasm that surrounded too many tech issues. \"There are a lot of companies that overstate their case and overstate their product,\" Price says.\n\nRCM launched the research unit in 1984 after taking a shellacking on the old Warner Communications, maker of Atari videogames. When the games didn't sell one Christmas, Warner stock plunged. Founder Claude Rosenberg (RCM was founded as Rosenberg Capital Management) blamed himself for letting his people talk only to rah-rah analysts, not retailers. Store managers \"would have told us that these games were piling up on the shelves,\" Price quotes Rosenberg as saying. Rosenberg, now 79, left RCM in 2001 to focus on philanthropy.\n\nSo in the spirit of Price's contrarian perspective and an intent to get early-mover advantage, here are some of his best picks (see table) from the $1.2 billion fund. These are not cheap, and one is not profitable. But he's convinced they have great futures.\n\nChartered Semiconductor . Partly owned by Singapore's government, this company makes chips for tech outfits without manufacturing operations. But in late April the company reported the second straight quarter of earnings declines. Chartered produces chips used in Advanced Micro Devices' computer processors and Apple 's video iPods.\n\nTrouble is, an excess of chip inventory and a price war between AMD and Intel makes things look iffy for the short term. And the monster of Chartered's field, Taiwan Semiconductor, is the odds-on favorite to come out ahead during any industry turmoil.\n\nFor the long pull, however, prospects look good for Chartered. It has forged an alliance with IBM and Samsung to create the next generation of semiconductors, at 45 nanometers or below. Chartered is down from its $12 high a year ago, although at $9 it has clawed back from the $7 nadir it hit in August.\n\nComverse Technology . Comverse provides voice mail and billing services to phone companies. The company also provides bears with a lot of negative publicity about itself. Comverse's former chief executive has fled to Namibia and is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges. Kobi Alexander is charged with illegally backdating stock options to inflate their value. Two other executives have pleaded guilty to securities fraud. The stock price is off by a quarter from early 2006.\n\nBut Price sees underlying strengths. \"The company has done a good job of fixing itself after the executives left,\" he says. The accounting problems they left in their wake should be cleaned up soon, he feels.\n\nAs cable and telecom companies compete for phone customers, they need new billing and messaging systems. One customer is Bharti Airtel, one of India's largest wireless operators, which is increasing orders. Bharti is growing at a 60% yearly clip and is adding between 1 million and 2 million subscribers every month. \"Comverse has some extraordinary customers,\" says Price.\n\nMarvell Technology. The maker of semiconductors used in Apple's iPod has seen its stock halved after displeasing Wall Street on two fronts. One, a 22% sales rise in last year's third quarter, was the smallest gain since Marvell went public in 2000. Second, Marvell was swept up in the backdating maelstrom. It will restate results for the past six years to record costs for misdated stock-option grants to executives.\n\nPrice likes its role in the next wave of all-in-one phones. Marvell has made a big bet buying the Intel processor business that builds chips for gizmos like the BlackBerry, Treo ( Palm ) and Q ( Motorola ) handheld devices. \"This is going to be a huge hit,\" says Price. \"It gets them into a business that is very hard to enter.\" Marvell's only rival here is Texas Instruments . Price also is buoyed by the big chip orders Marvell gets from Cisco. Marvell has a strong business in disk drive and Wi-Fi chips.\n\nResearch In Motion . This company makes the ubiquitous and indispensable BlackBerry for executives on the go. Its stock doubled in 2006 but tumbled 8% last month after robust quarterly results failed to meet analysts' expectations. Also hurting the stock: The company announced that stock options grants in the 1990s had been improperly accounted for.\n\nWith a $24 billion market cap RIM these days is a bit beyond Price's midcap range, but he thinks its growth prospects remain remarkable. Price is especially impressed by the Canadian company's moves to take it beyond its customary business clientele into the wider consumer market. The elegantly styled Pearl smart phone features a camera and a multimedia player that appeals to consumers. \"Our Grassroots survey says that this product is really hot,\" says Price. \"So I think this adds a whole new growth layer.\"\n\nSalesforce.com. This $4.8 billion (market cap) company makes Web-based customer management software. Chief Marc Benioff is trying to sell more-expensive programs and attract larger customers. He's competing with biggies like SAP and Oracle . But Salesforce.com's wares are much less expensive. Salesforce is a subscription system; the customers don't have to put in servers or software. They sign on to the Internet as a service. \"I think for the middle market this is absolutely the way to go,\" says Price.\n\nPrice's Allianz RCM Technology Fund is offered in multiple share classes. The no-load D shares, while not available for direct purchase, can be acquired through brokerage platforms at outfits like Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard. The D shares cost $1.64 per $100 of assets annually, which is on the high side. You won't have to pay a purchase or transaction fee when buying the D shares through one of the fund supermarkets. The fund's high turnover (272%) says this investment belongs in a tax-deferred account."
