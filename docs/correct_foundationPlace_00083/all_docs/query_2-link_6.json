        "text": "Last week a parody was making the rounds online. The video clip contained extracts from the 2006 Hollywood movie \"300,\" featuring King Leonidas and a force of soldiers fighting the Persians at Thermopylae in 480 B.C., but the voice track had been changed. The new track claimed that Israeli technology company Comverse was callously firing workers and depicted CEO Andre Dahan as a hedonist callously indifferent to the troops on the firing line.\n\nThe clip began circulating a few days after the latest staffing cuts at Comverse were announced.\n\nPresumably what irked the clip's authors was the $800,000 Dahan grossed in 2010, while the company continued to rack up losses and dismiss employees. Perhaps they are also irritated by the half-billion dollars the company spent on restating its financial figures after the backdating scandal exploded - probably one of the costliest processes in the history of accounting, as Dahan himself admits.\n\nThe CEO, however, says he understands the workers.\n\nDahan, 62, devoted Sunday to talking with the press, but not because of the layoffs. He wanted to discuss the company's new strategy.\n\nThis isn't the first time Dahan says he's found a new path for Comverse, but this time he sounds keener. On the layoffs, he explains that the company had no choice because of liquidity difficulties, but he feels the new growth plan will emotionally involve the company's remaining staff.\n\n\"In five years Comverse will be in a totally different place,\" says Dahan. He sees growth in billing technology and the mobile Internet.\n\nSo what's new? Comverse sells technology to phone companies, which in turn can offer new services to their customers. Comverse's income comes from two main areas: \"converged BSS\" - business support systems - and \"VAS\" - the supply of value-added services such as text messages and image messages.\n\nDahan is expanding from two to four areas: BSS, VAS and mobile Internet and service maintenance.\n\n\"When Comverse started out, it provided voicemail. That was Comverse 1.0. Comverse 2005 engaged in value-added services, prepaid and post-paid. Comverse today is Comverse 3.0 - a new company,\" he says.\n\nComverse's main focus will remain billing systems - a $13 billion-a-year market. Comverse and its ilk sell the software to phone companies that create client bills, an increasingly tricky task as communication services explode. The company will be opening a new R&D center in Israel to work on billing systems. The center is to have dozens of employees, some new, some taken from the company's other divisions.\n\n\"The world is moving to mobile data, to consuming data using smart phones,\" Dahan says. \"We want to be part of that change. We want to allow telecom operators to manage and prioritize clients without impairing network neutrality.\"\n\nOded Golan, recruited by Dahan to oversee the progress of change, claims that Comverse's operating costs have stopped bleeding.\n\n\"It also has some strong assets. Don't write us off,\" he quips. \"The company is a leader in BSS and mobile Internet. It has a range of services in VAS and hundreds of clients, some premium clients. It operates globally. Its systems are deployed in practically every country. For all the cynicism and pessimism, the people working at Comverse are very connected to the company and want it to succeed.\"\n\nSo even though layoffs continue, is the crisis over?\n\n\"The trauma is over. It lasted five years. We still have to submit a financial statement for 2010, but that won't be a big problem,\" Dahan says.\n\n\"In March 2010 I went to the chief financial officer, Steve Swad, and said we have to start thinking about investments at Comverse, mainly in mobile Internet. I said to him, 'Find me $100 million for investment.' He came back to me and said, 'Listen, not only don't you have $100 million. We have a $50 million liquidity problem.\"\n\nThe company took steps. It sold land in Ra'anana for $27 million, sold subsidiary Ulticom for $90 million (which brought in $56 million for its stake ) and offloaded 2.3 million shares in another subsidiary, Verint, while keeping the 52% controlling stake. And as we know, it's cutting its workforce. This week, 200 Comverse workers are undergoing hearings ahead of dismissal.\n\nThe Comverse group, including subsidiaries, had 6,900 people on its payroll worldwide, including the people at Ulticom. Comverse itself has 3,900 of whom about half work in Israel.\n\nDahan declines to say how many people have been fired, but adds that the figures bruited about in the press are wrong. The media says 400 were let go in October, 200 are leaving now and hundreds more face the ax this year.\n\n\"It isn't easy to be a Comverse worker,\" he says, presumably meaning \"at this time.\" \"It hurts us to fire people. But what was the alternative? We're doing this to build a healthy company that has a chance to grow, and even invest in other companies. You can't just sell assets and fiddle with operational problems. Nobody would support a CEO who does nothing but that.\"\n\nThe company can't just tap cash reserves; \"I don't want to play Russian roulette,\" Dahan says.\n\nComverse has certainly had a tough row to hoe in recent years. It stopped publishing financial statements entirely for three years following the remarkable backdating scandal uncovered in 2006, which sent founder and former CEO Kobi Alexander fleeing the arm of the law to Namibia.\n\nRecently, the company finally managed to issue a statement for 2009. It reported revenues of $799 million (Comverse alone ), down 13.7% from 2008. For 2009, Comverse reported a loss of $37.7 million, after losing $20.5 million the year before.\n\nCompiling financial statements for the years after the scandal erupted cost Comverse a cool half-billion dollars. Dahan predicts that this very month, Comverse can tell the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission when the statement for 2010 will be ready.\n\nIf the only problem had been backdated stock options, the process of recalculating the company's financials probably would have ended within months. But it wasn't. \"There were three things that caused the process to drag out,\" Dahan says. \"The first was backdating. The second was registration of fictitious names who received stock options.\"\n\nMoney was siphoned out of the company by \"granting\" stock options to people who never existed, to drive home the point. \"That's a problem of fraud,\" Dahan observes. \"The third problem was use of reserve bank accounts to handle profits. These three things together meant that the process of correcting the financial statements was complex and cost money.\"\n\nManagement racked its brains thinking of ways to truncate the process, to no avail, Dahan says.\n\nThe company's auditors at the time, Deloitte, advised Comverse in November 2007 that the method of recognizing income had to be revisited. This was a bombshell. \"You have to understand what that meant. Our relations with clients are long-term,\" Dahan says. \"The moment you reopen one order, you have to reopen the main contract.\" That sort of in-depth, broad inspection takes years.\n\n\"When we began the process of rechecking income, we didn't know how deep the audit would go. It was madness,\" Dahan says. \"For instance, an American client signed a $10 million contract with us at the start of 2001, of which $50,000 was allocated for service and training on the software systems we sell. We undertook to provide 100 training days. We started to look for records of training days but couldn't find any. We had to ask the client to look for documentation from 2001.\"\n\nThat meant deferring recognition of $10 million in income until the records could be found. In short, Comverse's records were a mess.\n\nAnd now? The situation is clearing up. Management sees light at the end of the tunnel. Dahan, who came out of retirement to lead the company back to grace, is reshaping it in the image of the new age - Comverse 3.0. Will it work? Time will tell."
