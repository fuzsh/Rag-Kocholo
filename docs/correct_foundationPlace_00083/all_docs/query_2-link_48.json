        "text": "6. Karatz acknowledges and agrees that the exercise price of each annual stock option granted to him since October 2, 1998 (the “Subject Options”) shall be changed to the closing price per share of the Company’s common stock on the new measurement dates selected by KB Home for such grants as reflected in the restated financial statements or adjusted books and records expected to be completed by KB Home. For each Subject Option exercised by Karatz prior to the date hereof, Karatz shall pay to KB Home, in cash, the product of (i) any positive difference between the exercise price and the fair market value of KB Home common stock on the new measurement date for the Subject Option and (ii) the number of shares subject to such Subject Option. KB Home will provide Karatz with a schedule containing reasonable detail regarding the new measurement dates and amounts payable by Karatz in respect of the Subject Options within 15 days of filing financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission and Karatz shall make the required payments and enter into amended option agreements within 90 days thereafter. Karatz acknowledges that KB Home makes no representation as to the tax treatment of Karatz’s KB Home stock options and shares of restricted stock and that he will be responsible for any tax obligations that may arise therefrom.\n\nThe Company has determined that the stock option (“Option ”) granted to you on June 7, 2004 in respect of 30,000 shares of our Series B common stock (“Common Stock ”) at an exercise price of $10.00 per share was granted with an exercise price less than the fair market value of the Common Stock at the time of grant.\n\n…\n\n[Y]ou and the Company desire to raise the exercise price of the Common Stock in respect of the Option from $10.00 per share to $21.25 per share, which the Company has determined to be the fair market value of the Common Stock on June 7, 2004."
