        "text": "Corporate Partners Introduce Buddy CheckTM 9 Program\n\nJune 2, 1999\n\nMedia\n\ncontact:\n\nMichel Daley,\n\nBell Atlantic\n\n202-392-1021\n\nKay Brewer,\n\nComverse Network Systems\n\n781-224-8372\n\nWASHINGTON -- Bell Atlantic and other corporate sponsors today held\n\na rally to stop breast cancer in its tracks. The event, held at Bell Atlantic's\n\noffices in Arlington, Va., was designed to increase breast cancer awareness\n\namong employees and promote early detection, which offers the best\n\nchance to treat the disease successfully.\n\nBell Atlantic and its partners -- Comverse Network Systems, the Cancer\n\nResearch Foundation of America, the Lombardi Cancer Center at the\n\nGeorgetown University Medical Center, Channel 9 Eyewitness News and\n\nWHUR 96.3 FM -- are sponsoring Buddy CheckTM 9, a program to inform\n\nwomen about the importance of early detection and how to perform breast\n\nself-exams.\n\nAt the rally, Marie C. Johns, president and CEO of Bell Atlantic -\n\nWashington and Andrea Roane, news anchor, Channel 9 Eyewitness News\n\nhighlighted the importance of breast self-exams and challenged to\n\naudience to get involved. Attendees also received Buddy CheckTM 9 T-\n\nshirts and Buddy CheckTM 9 brochures with important information about\n\nbreast health awareness. Most women have to be taught how to perform\n\nthe exams correctly. Therefore, nurses from the Lombardi Cancer Center\n\nwere on hand to demonstrate the correct procedure.\n\nIn addition, Bell Atlantic is using its technology to further promote breast\n\ncancer awareness. Starting in July, Bell AtlanticÂ® Home Voice Mail\n\nsubscribers in the Washington metropolitan area can sign up to receive a\n\nfree monthly voice mail message reminding them to conduct a breast self-\n\nexam.\n\n\"It is very important to educate the public about the most common\n\nform of cancer affecting women in this country,\" said Johns.\n\n\"And our Home Voice Mail service provides a convenient way to\n\nencourage everyone to join the fight against breast cancer.\"\n\nAll women-and one percent of men-are at risk of breast cancer. The\n\ndisease cannot be prevented because the cause is unknown. However,\n\nwhen breast cancer is detected and treated in its early stages, the five-year\n\nsurvival rate is 97 percent.\n\n\"There is no more rewarding use of Comverse's technology than to\n\ndeliver these life-saving reminder messages each month to Bell Atlantic\n\nHome Voice Mail customers,\" said Francis E. Girard, chief\n\nexecutive officer of Comverse Network Systems. \"For over 10\n\nyears, Comverse and Bell Atlantic have worked together to bring voice\n\nmessaging services to consumers and businesses. We are honored to\n\nextend that partnership to include the Buddy CheckTM 9 program.\"\n\nBreast self-exams are not meant to replace mammograms or clinical exams\n\nperformed by physicians. However, they are an important third step of the\n\nbreast cancer early detection triad recommended by major U.S. cancer\n\norganizations.\n\n\"The good news is that early stages of breast cancer are highly\n\ntreatable,\" Johns said. \"Thanks to breast cancer early-\n\ndetection programs, there are over two million breast cancer survivors in\n\nthe U.S. today. With the help of Buddy Check 9, I'm hopeful that figure\n\nwill climb even higher.\"\n\nBell Atlantic is at the forefront of the new communications and\n\ninformation industry.
