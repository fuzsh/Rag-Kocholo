        "text": "THE TRANSITION\n\nPassed by the Council of the District of Columbia, The Department of Buildings Establishment Act of 2020 became law on October 1, 2021, and started the process of establishing two new agencies, which began service to the District at midnight on October 1, 2022.\n\nThese new agencies, the Department of Buildings (DOB) and the Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection (DLCP), will serve residents, businesses, and visitors of the District of Columbia, taking on responsibilities previously under the Department of Consumer and Regulatory Affairs’ (DCRA) purview. This transition will allow each agency to enhance their consumers’ experiences through promoting their health, safety, and quality of life.\n\nWithin their respective areas of responsibility, DOB and DLCP will deliver effective compliance, meaningful regulation, and timely maintenance, putting consumer protection at the forefront of their improved operations.\n\nWhat does this mean for the consumer?\n\nBuilding on the progress DCRA has made over the past three years, the transition to two agencies will allow each to better serve their respective customers by having a narrower focus and clear organizational structures. With a continued emphasis on providing good customer service, and improved access through innovative digital services, the anticipated positive impact of this transition will be clear through measured, published key performance indicators.\n\nAs with all District government agencies, each agency will operate independently with its own leadership. Efficiencies such as a single sign-on program that allows access to multiple platforms with one set of credentials and enhanced customer relationship management systems will remain, each powered by Kustomer with a “K.” It is through Kustomer that customer inquiries will be efficiently received by each agency after the transition.\n\nWE’RE HIRING\n\nWe are currently seeking talented professionals who possess a relevant skill set and a strong desire to serve the residents and businesses of the District, to increase our ability to better serve our customers as we expand into the newly established Department of Buildings and Department of Licensing and Consumer Protection.\n\nTo join District government at this exciting time, please view the positions associated with DCRA and apply now.\n\nIf you have an interest and are potentially qualified, view the current positions and apply at the link below."
