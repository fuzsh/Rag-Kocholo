Special algorithms utilized by the Company to handle\n\noptical disks within a number of jukebox devices include automatic\n\nchannel-to-disk allocation, automatic retrieval of multimedia information from\n\nany disk located in the jukeboxes and redundant archiving on two or more\n\ncartridges simultaneously.\n\n-8-\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nBecause of the continuing technological changes that characterize the\n\ntelecommunications and computer industries, the Company's success will depend,\n\nto a considerable extent, upon its ability to continue to develop competitive\n\nproducts through its research and development efforts. The Company currently\n\nemploys more than 2,200 scientists, engineers and technicians in its research\n\nand development efforts, located predominantly in the United States and Israel\n\nwith additional offices in France, Germany and Malaysia, with broad experience\n\nin the areas of digital signal processing, computer architecture, telephony, IP,\n\ndata networking, multi-processing, databases, real-time software design and\n\napplication software design, among others.\n\nA portion of the Company's research and development operations benefit\n\nfrom financial incentives provided by government instrumentalities to promote\n\nresearch and development activities performed in Israel. The cost of such\n\nefforts is and will continue to be affected by the continued availability of\n\nfunding under such programs. During the past fiscal year, the Company's research\n\nand development activities included projects submitted for partial funding under\n\na program administered by the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of\n\nIndustry and Trade of the State of Israel (\"OCS\"), under which reimbursement of\n\na portion of the Company's research and development expenditures will be made\n\nsubject to final approval of project budgets. The percentage of the Company's\n\ntotal research and development expenditures reimbursed under these programs has\n\ndeclined in recent years, and will continue to decline. The Company pays\n\nroyalties on its sales of certain products developed in part with funding\n\nsupplied under such programs. During the year ended January 31, 2002, Comverse\n\nentered into an arrangement with the OCS whereby Comverse agreed to pay a lump\n\nsum royalty amount for all past amounts received from the OCS. In addition,\n\nComverse will receive lower amounts from the OCS than it has historically\n\nreceived, but will not have to pay royalty amounts on future grants. Permission\n\nfrom the government of Israel is required for the Company to manufacture outside\n\nof Israel products resulting from research and development activities funded\n\nunder such programs, or to transfer outside of Israel related technology rights,\n\nand in order to obtain such permission the Company may be required to increase\n\nthe royalties to the applicable funding agencies and/or repay certain amounts\n\nreceived as reimbursement of research and development costs. See \"Licenses and\n\nRoyalties\" and \"Operations in Israel\" in Item 1 and \"Management's Discussion and\n\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7.\n\nPATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nThe Company holds a number of United States and foreign patents. While\n\nthe Company files patent applications periodically, no assurance can be given\n\nthat patents will be issued on the basis of such applications or that, if\n\npatents are issued, the claims allowed will be sufficiently broad to protect the\n\nCompany's technology. In addition, no assurance can be given that any patents\n\nissued to the Company will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented or\n\nthat the rights granted under the patents will provide significant benefits to\n\nthe Company.\n\n-9-\n\nIn order to safeguard its unpatented proprietary know-how, trade\n\nsecrets and technology, the Company relies primarily upon trade secret\n\nprotection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others\n\nhaving access to confidential information. There can be no assurance that these\n\nmeasures will adequately protect the Company from disclosure or misappropriation\n\nof its proprietary information.\n\nThe Company and its customers from time to time receive communications\n\nfrom third parties, including some of the Company's competitors, alleging\n\ninfringement by the Company of such parties' patent rights. While such\n\ncommunications are common in the computer and telecommunications industries and\n\nthe Company has in the past been able to obtain any necessary licenses on\n\ncommercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that the Company would\n\nprevail in any litigation to enjoin the Company from selling certain of its\n\nproducts on the basis of such alleged infringement, or that the Company would be\n\nable to license any valid patents on reasonable terms.\n\nIn January 2000, the Company and Lucent Technologies GRL Corp.\n\n(\"Lucent\") entered into a non-exclusive cross-licensing arrangement covering\n\ncurrent and certain future patents issued to the Company and its affiliates and\n\na portfolio of current and certain future patents in the area of\n\ntelecommunications technology issued to Lucent and its affiliates.\n\nLICENSES AND ROYALTIES\n\nThe Company licenses certain technology, know-how and related rights\n\nfor use in the manufacture and marketing of its products, and pays royalties to\n\nthird-parties under such licenses and under other agreements. The Company\n\nbelieves that its rights under such licenses and other agreements are sufficient\n\nfor the manufacturing and marketing of its products and, in the case of\n\nlicenses, extend for periods at least equal to the estimated useful lives of the\n\nrelated technology and know-how.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nAt January 31, 2002, the backlog of the Company amounted to\n\napproximately $220.7 million. Substantially all of the backlog is expected to be\n\ndelivered within the next 12 months.\n\nSERVICE AND SUPPORT\n\nThe Company has a strong commitment to provide product service and\n\nsupport to its customers and emphasizes such commitment in its marketing.\n\nBecause of the intensity of use of systems by telecommunications network\n\noperators and other customers of the Company's products, and their low tolerance\n\nfor down-time, the Company is required to make a greater commitment to service\n\nand support of systems used by these customers, and such commitment increases\n\noperating costs.\n\n-10-\n\nThe Company's general warranty policy is to replace or repair any\n\ncomponent that fails during a specified warranty period. Broader warranty and\n\nservice coverage is provided in many cases, and is sometimes made available to\n\ncustomers on a contractual basis for an additional charge.\n\nThe Company provides technical assistance from several locations around\n\nthe world. Technical support is available for the Company's customers 24\n\nhours-a-day, seven days-a-week.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe Company faces strong competition in the markets for all of its\n\nproducts. The market for ESS systems is highly competitive, and includes\n\nnumerous products offering a broad range of features and capacities. The primary\n\ncompetitors are suppliers of turnkey ESS systems and software, and indirect\n\ncompetitors that supply certain components to systems integrators. Many of\n\nComverse's competitors specialize in a subset of Comverse's portfolio of\n\nservices. Direct and/or indirect competitors include, among others, Boston\n\nCommunications, Cap Gemini, CMG, Ericsson, Glenayre, IBM, InterVoice-Brite,\n\nLogica, Lucent, Motorola, Nokia, Openwave, SS8 Networks, Tecnomen, Telcordia,\n\nand Unisys. Competitors of Comverse that manufacture other telecommunications\n\nequipment may derive a competitive advantage in selling ESS systems to customers\n\nthat are purchasing or have previously purchased other compatible equipment from\n\nsuch manufacturers.\n\nIndirect competition is provided by messaging and other enhanced\n\ncommunications products employed at end-user sites as an alternative to the use\n\nof services available through telecommunications network operators. This\n\n\"enterprise based equipment\" includes a broad range of products, such as\n\nstand-alone voicemail systems, answering machines, telephone handsets with\n\nvoice-activated dialing and other enhanced services capabilities, products\n\noffering \"call processing\" services that are supplied with voicemail features or\n\nintegrated with other voicemail systems, as well as personal computer modems and\n\nadd-on cards and software designed to furnish enhanced communications\n\ncapabilities.\n\nComverse believes that competition in the sale of ESS systems is based\n\non a number of factors, the most important of which are product features and\n\nfunctionality, system capacity and reliability, marketing and distribution\n\ncapability and price. Other important competitive factors include service and\n\nsupport and the capability to integrate systems with a variety of telecom\n\nnetworks, IP networks and Operation and Support Systems (OSS). Comverse believes\n\nthat the range of capabilities provided by, and the ease of use of, its systems\n\ncompare favorably with other products currently marketed. Comverse anticipates\n\nthat a number of its direct and indirect competitors will introduce new or\n\nimproved ESS systems during the next several years.\n\nVerint faces strong competition in the markets for its products, both\n\nin the United States and internationally. Verint expects competition to persist\n\nand intensify in the digital security and surveillance market, primarily due to\n\nincreased demand for homeland defense and security solutions following the\n\nSeptember 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Verint's primary competitors are suppliers\n\n-11-\n\nof security and recording systems and software, and indirect competitors that\n\nsupply certain components to systems integrators. In the enterprise business\n\nintelligence market, Verint faces competition from organizations emerging from\n\nthe traditional call logging or call recording market as well as software\n\ncompanies that develop and sell products that perform specific functions for\n\nthis market. Additionally, many of Verint's competitors specialize in a subset\n\nof Verint's portfolio of products and services. Primary competitors include,\n\namong others, ECtel, e-talk, Eyretel, JSI Telecom, NICE Systems, Sensormatic,\n\nSS8 Networks and Witness Systems. Verint believes it competes principally on the\n\nbasis of product performance and functionality, knowledge and experience in the\n\nindustry, product quality and reliability, customer service and support, and\n\nprice.\n\nVerint believes that its success depends primarily on its ability to\n\nprovide technologically advanced and cost effective solutions and to continue to\n\nprovide its customers with prompt and responsive customer support. Competitors\n\nthat manufacture other security-related systems or other recording systems may\n\nderive a competitive advantage in selling to customers that are purchasing or\n\nhave previously purchased other compatible equipment from such manufacturers.\n\nFurther, Verint expects that competition will increase as other established and\n\nemerging companies enter its markets and as new products, services and\n\ntechnologies are introduced.\n\nCompetitors of Ulticom include a number of companies ranging from SS7\n\nsoftware solution providers, such as SS8 Networks and Trillium Digital Systems,\n\nan Intel company, to vendors of communication and network infrastructure\n\nequipment, such as Compaq and Hewlett Packard. Ulticom believes it competes\n\nprincipally on the basis of product performance and functionality, product\n\nquality and reliability, customer service and support, and price.\n\nMany of the Company's present and potential competitors are\n\nconsiderably larger than the Company, are more established, have a larger\n\ninstalled base of customers and have greater financial, technical, marketing and\n\nother resources.\n\nMANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLIES\n\nThe Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of final\n\nassembly and testing, involving the application of extensive testing and quality\n\ncontrol procedures to materials, components, subassemblies and systems. The\n\nCompany primarily uses third-parties to perform modules and subsystem assembly,\n\ncomponent testing and sheet metal fabrication. Although the Company generally\n\nuses standard parts and components in its products, certain components and\n\nsubassemblies are presently available only from a limited number of sources. To\n\ndate, the Company has been able to obtain adequate supplies of all components\n\nand subassemblies in a timely manner from existing sources or, when necessary,\n\nfrom alternative sources or redesign the system to incorporate new modules, when\n\napplicable. However, the inability to obtain sufficient quantities of components\n\nor to locate alternative sources of supply if and as required in the future,\n\nwould adversely affect the Company's operations.\n\n-12-\n\nThe Company maintains organization-wide quality assurance procedures,\n\ncoordinating the quality control activities of the Company's research and\n\ndevelopment, manufacturing and service departments.\n\nCAPITAL MARKET ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Company seeks to identify and implement suitable investments, and\n\nengages in portfolio investment and capital market activities, including venture\n\ncapital investments directly and indirectly through private equity funds.\n\nThrough a joint venture formed by the Company in partnership with Quantum\n\nIndustrial Holdings Ltd., an investment company managed by Soros Fund Management\n\nLLC, the Company invests in venture capital in high technology firms, and\n\nengages in other investment activities. The Company has significantly reduced\n\nits new venture capital investments in recent periods.\n\nOPERATIONS IN ISRAEL\n\nA substantial portion of the Company's research and development,\n\nmanufacturing and other operations are located in Israel and, accordingly, may\n\nbe affected by economic, political and military conditions in that country.\n\nSince the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed\n\nconflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and the\n\ncontinued state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to\n\nsecurity and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been a\n\nsignificant increase in violence, primarily in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and\n\nmore recently Israel has experienced terrorist incidents within its borders. As\n\na result, negotiations between Israel and representatives of the Palestinian\n\nAuthority have been sporadic and have failed to result in peace. The Company\n\ncould be adversely affected by hostilities involving Israel, the interruption or\n\ncurtailment of trade between Israel and its trading partners, or a significant\n\ndownturn in the economic or financial condition of Israel. In addition, some of\n\nthe Company's employees in Israel are subject to being called upon to perform\n\nmilitary service in Israel, and their absence may have an adverse effect upon\n\nthe Company's operations.\n\nIsrael is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary\n\nFund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the\n\nInternational Finance Corporation, and is a signatory to the General Agreement\n\non Tariffs and Trade, which provides for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers\n\namong its members. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the\n\nGeneralized System of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada, and\n\nJapan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by such\n\nprograms either duty-free or at reduced tariffs.\n\nIsrael and the European Union are parties to a Free Trade Agreement\n\npursuant to which, subject to rules of origin, Israel's industrial exports to\n\nthe European Union are exempt from customs duties and other non-tariff barriers\n\nand import restrictions. Israel also has an agreement with the United States to\n\nestablish a Free Trade Area that has eliminated all tariff and certain\n\nnon-tariff barriers on most trade between the two countries. Israel has also\n\nentered into an agreement with the European Free Trade Association (\"EFTA\"),\n\nwhich currently includes Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland, that\n\n-13-\n\nestablished a free-trade zone between Israel and EFTA nations exempting\n\nmanufactured goods and some agricultural goods and processed foods from customs\n\nduties, while reducing duties on other goods. The end of the Cold War has also\n\nenabled Israel to establish commercial and trade relations with a number of\n\nnations, including Russia, China, India, Turkey and the nations of Eastern\n\nEurope, with whom Israel had not previously had such relations.\n\nThe Company's business is dependent to some extent on trading\n\nrelationships between Israel and other countries. Certain of the Company's\n\nproducts incorporate components imported into Israel from the United States and\n\nother countries and most of the Company's products are sold outside of Israel.\n\nAccordingly, the Company's operations would be adversely affected if trade\n\nbetween Israel and its current trading partners were interrupted or curtailed.\n\nThe sale of products manufactured in Israel has been adversely affected in\n\ncertain markets by restrictive laws, policies or practices directed toward\n\nIsrael or companies having operations in Israel. The continuation or\n\nexacerbation of conflicts involving Israel and other nations may impede the\n\nCompany's ability to sell its products in certain markets.\n\nThe Company benefits from various policies of the Government of Israel,\n\nincluding reduced taxation and special subsidy programs, designed to stimulate\n\neconomic activity, particularly high technology industry, in that country. As a\n\ncondition of its receipt of funds for various research and development projects\n\nconducted under programs sponsored by the Government of Israel, the Company has\n\nagreed that products resulting from these projects may not be manufactured, nor\n\nmay the technology developed in the projects be transferred, outside of Israel\n\nwithout government consent.\n\nThe results of operations of the Company have been favorably affected\n\nby participation in Israeli government programs related to research and\n\ndevelopment, as well as utilization of certain tax incentives and other\n\nincentives available under applicable Israeli laws and regulations, some of\n\nwhich have been reduced, discontinued or otherwise modified in recent years. In\n\naddition, the Company's ability to obtain benefits under various discretionary\n\nfunding programs has declined and may continue to decline. The results of\n\noperations of the Company could be adversely affected if these programs were\n\nfurther reduced or eliminated and not replaced with equivalent programs or if\n\nits ability to participate in these programs were to be reduced significantly.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAt January 31, 2002, the Company employed approximately 5,650\n\nindividuals, of whom approximately 77% are scientists, engineers and technicians\n\nengaged in research and development, marketing and support activities.\n\nThe Company is not a party to any collective bargaining or other\n\nagreement with any labor organization; however, certain provisions of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of\n\nLabor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations\n\n(including the Industrialists' Association) are applicable to the Company's\n\nIsraeli employees by order of the Israeli Ministry of Labor. Israeli law\n\n-14-\n\ngenerally requires the payment by employers of severance pay upon the death of\n\nan employee, his or her retirement or upon termination of his or her employment,\n\nand the Company provides for such payment obligations through monthly\n\ncontributions to an insurance fund. Israeli employees and employers are required\n\nto pay pre-determined sums to the National Insurance Institute, which payment\n\ncovers medical and other benefits similar to the benefits provided by the United\n\nStates Social Security Administration.\n\nThe continuing success of the Company will depend, to a considerable\n\nextent, on the contributions of its senior management and key employees, many of\n\nwhom would be difficult to replace, and on the Company's ability to attract and\n\nretain qualified employees in all areas of its business. Competition for such\n\npersonnel is intense. In order to attract and retain talented personnel, and to\n\nprovide incentives for their performance, the Company has emphasized the award\n\nof stock options as an important element of its compensation program, including\n\noptions to purchase shares in certain of the Company's subsidiaries, and\n\nprovides cash bonuses based on several parameters, including the profitability\n\nof the recipients' respective business units.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\nAs of January 31, 2002, the Company leased an aggregate of\n\napproximately 2,455,000 square feet of office space and manufacturing and\n\nrelated facilities for its operations worldwide, including approximately\n\n1,486,000 square feet in Tel Aviv, Israel, approximately 367,000 square feet in\n\nWakefield, Massachusetts, approximately 77,000 square feet in Andover,\n\nMassachusetts, approximately 60,000 square feet in Woodbury, New York,\n\napproximately 85,000 square feet in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, and an aggregate of\n\napproximately 380,000 square feet at various other locations in the United\n\nStates, Europe, the Far East, Australia, Latin America and Africa. The aggregate\n\nbase monthly rent for the facilities under lease as of January 31, 2002 was\n\napproximately $3,119,000, and all of such leases are subject to various\n\npass-throughs and escalation adjustments.\n\nIn addition, the Company owns office space and manufacturing and\n\nrelated facilities of approximately 40,000 square feet in Durango, Colorado and\n\napproximately 25,000 square feet in Bexbach, Germany.\n\nIn September, 1999, the Company acquired approximately 423,000 square\n\nfeet of unimproved land in Ra'anana, Israel, with a view to the potential future\n\nconsolidation and construction of facilities for its Israeli operations.\n\nThe Company believes that its facilities currently under lease are more\n\nthan adequate for its current operations, and may endeavor selectively to reduce\n\nits existing facilities commitments as circumstances may warrant.\n\n-15-\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\nOn or about October 19, 2001, Kevin Beier v. Comverse Technology, Inc.,\n\net al., CV 016972, the first of four virtually identical purported securities\n\nclass action complaints was filed against CTI and certain of its executive\n\nofficers in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New\n\nYork. The four actions were consolidated into the Beier action on January 15,\n\n2002 and an amended consolidated complaint was filed on March 4, 2002. The\n\nconsolidated complaint generally alleges violations of federal securities laws\n\non behalf of individuals who allege that they purchased CTI's common stock\n\nduring a purported class period between April 30, 2001 and July 10, 2001. The\n\nconsolidated complaint seeks an unspecified amount in damages on behalf of\n\npersons who purchased CTI stock during the purported class period. The Company\n\nbelieves all claims in the complaints to be without merit and will vigorously\n\ndefend against these claims.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company is subject to claims in legal\n\nproceedings arising in the normal course of its business. The Company does not\n\nbelieve that it is currently party to any pending legal action that could\n\nreasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on its business or\n\noperating results.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS.\n\nAt a Special Meeting of Shareholders held on February 25, 2002, the\n\nshareholders of CTI authorized CTI to make an offer to holders of certain CTI\n\nstock options granted under its stock incentive compensation plans entitling\n\nsuch holders to surrender such options for cancellation in exchange for the\n\ngrant of replacement options to purchase 0.85 shares of Common Stock for each\n\nshare that was issuable under such cancelled options, with the replacement\n\noptions to be granted no earlier than six months and one day following the\n\ncancellation date of the cancelled options at a price equal to the fair market\n\nvalue of the Common Stock on the new grant date. This proposal was approved with\n\na vote of 74,549,571 shares in favor, 58,162,258 shares against and 1,206,026\n\nabstentions.\n\n-16-\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.\n\nThe Common Stock of CTI trades on the NASDAQ National Market System\n\nunder the symbol CMVT. The following table sets forth the range of closing\n\nprices of the Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ for the past two fiscal years.\n\nAll prices have been adjusted to reflect the three-for-two stock split, effected\n\nin the form of a stock dividend, distributed on April 15, 1999, and the\n\ntwo-for-one stock split, effected in the form of a stock dividend, distributed\n\non April 3, 2000.\n\nYear Fiscal Quarter Low High\n\n2000 2/1/00 - 4/30/00 68.06 119.69\n\n5/1/00 - 7/31/00 65.25 102.75\n\n8/1/00 - 10/31/00 76.06 114.81\n\n11/1/00 - 1/31/01 86.19 121.63\n\n2001 2/1/01 - 4/30/01 45.82 113.13\n\n5/1/01 - 7/31/01 24.78 74.11\n\n8/1/01 - 10/31/01 15.90 29.87\n\n11/1/01 - 1/31/02 19.14 26.93\n\nThere were 1,829 holders of record of Common Stock at April 23, 2002.\n\nSuch record holders include a number of holders who are nominees for an\n\nundetermined number of beneficial owners. The Company believes that the number\n\nof beneficial owners of the shares of Common Stock outstanding at such date was\n\napproximately 30,000.\n\nThe Company has not declared or paid any cash dividends on its equity\n\nsecurities and does not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable\n\nfuture, but rather intends to retain its earnings to finance the development of\n\nthe Company's business. Any future determination as to the declaration and\n\npayment of dividends will be made by the Board of Directors in its discretion,\n\nand will depend upon the Company's earnings, financial condition, capital\n\nrequirements and other relevant factors. See \"Management's Discussion and\n\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Liquidity and Capital\n\nResources.\"\n\n-17-\n\nITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.\n\nThe following tables present selected consolidated financial data for\n\nthe Company for the year ended December 31, 1997, the one month period ended\n\nJanuary 31, 1998, and the years ended January 31, 1999, 2000, 2001 and 2002.\n\nSuch information has been derived from the Company's audited consolidated\n\nfinancial statements and should be read in conjunction with the Company's\n\nconsolidated financial statements and the notes to the consolidated financial\n\nstatements included elsewhere in this report. All financial information\n\npresented herein has been retroactively adjusted for the January 1998 merger\n\nwith Boston Technology, Inc. (\"Boston\") and the July 2000 acquisition of Loronix\n\nInformation Systems, Inc. (\"Loronix\") to account for those transactions as\n\npooling of interests. All per share data has been restated to reflect a\n\nthree-for-two stock split effected as a 50% stock dividend to shareholders of\n\nrecord on March 31, 1999, distributed on April 15, 1999, and a two-for-one stock\n\nsplit effected as a 100% stock dividend to shareholders of record on March 27,\n\n2000, distributed on April 3, 2000.\n\nYear Transition\n\nEnded Period Ended Year Ended\n\nDecember 31, January 31, January 31,\n\n------------ ----------- -------------------------------------------------\n\n1997(1)(3) 1998 1999 (3) 2000 (3) 2001 2002\n\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n\nStatement of Operations Data:\n\nSales $ 498,343 $ 14,401 $ 708,805 $ 909,667 $ 1,225,058 $ 1,270,218\n\nCost of sales 221,650 21,666(2) 304,665 371,589 482,658 525,480\n\nResearch and development, net 98,152 13,481 134,201 169,816 232,198 293,296\n\nSelling, general and administrative 142,055 51,892(2) 157,106 193,996 259,607 323,036\n\nMerger and acquisition expenses - 41,877 - 2,016 15,971 -\n\nWorkforce reduction and\n\nrestructuring charges - - - - - 63,562\n\nInterest and other income\n\n(expense), net 4,957 175 8,315 16,595 33,339 (5,789)\n\nIncome (loss) before\n\nincome tax provision 41,443 (114,340) 121,148 188,845 267,963 59,055\n\nIncome tax provision 9,430 867 11,783 15,698 18,827 4,436\n\n---------- ---------- ---------- --------- ------------ -----------\n\nNet income (loss) $ 32,013 $ (115,207) $ 109,365 $ 173,147 $ 249,136 $ 54,619\n\n========== =========== ========== ========= ============ ===========\n\nEarnings (loss) per share - diluted $ 0.23 $ (0.89) $ 0.75 $ 1.08 $ 1.39 $ 0.29\n\n========== ========== ========== ========= ============ ===========\n\nWeighted average number of\n\ncommon and common equivalent\n\nshares outstanding - diluted 139,702 130,060 145,439 178,986 189,964 186,434\n\nDecember 31, January 31,\n\n------------ -------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1997 (4)(5) 1998 1999(4) 2000(4) 2001 2002\n\n(In thousands)\n\nBalance Sheet Data:\n\nWorking capital $ 402,901 $ 280,793 $ 712,165 $ 858,304 $ 1,860,379 $ 2,030,250\n\nTotal assets 636,342 527,652 1,042,959 1,372,847 2,625,264 2,704,163\n\nLong-term debt, including\n\ncurrent portion 142,790 124,257 416,327 308,082 906,723 648,611\n\nStockholders' equity 357,514 231,390 390,855 724,839 1,236,165 1,616,408\n\n(1) Includes results for Boston for the 11 months ended December 31, 1997.\n\n(2) Includes approximately $7.8 million in cost of sales and $36.1 million\n\nin selling, general and administrative expenses relating to charges as\n\na result of the merger with Boston.\n\n(3) Includes the results of Loronix for its fiscal year ended December 31.\n\n(4) Includes amounts for Loronix as of its fiscal year ended December 31.\n\n(5) Includes amounts for Boston as of December 31, 1997.\n\n-18-\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS.\n\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally\n\naccepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\n\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\n\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\n\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\n\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\nRevenue is generally recognized at the time of shipment for sales of\n\nsystems which do not require significant customization to be performed by the\n\nCompany and collection of the resulting receivable is deemed probable by the\n\nCompany. The Company's systems are generally a bundled hardware and software\n\nsolution that are shipped together. The Company generally has no obligations to\n\ncustomers after the date products are shipped, except for product warranties.\n\nThe Company generally warranties its products for one year after sale. A\n\nprovision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale.\n\nCustomers may also purchase separate maintenance contracts, which\n\ngenerally consist of bug-fixing and telephone access to Company technical\n\npersonnel, but in certain circumstances may also include the right to receive\n\nunspecified product updates, upgrades and enhancements. Revenue from these\n\nservices is recognized ratably over the contract period.\n\nRevenues from certain development contracts are recognized under the\n\npercentage-of-completion method on the basis of physical completion to date or\n\nusing actual costs incurred to total expected costs under the contract.\n\nRevisions in estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting\n\nperiod in which the facts that require the revision become known. At the time a\n\nloss on a contract is known, the entire amount of the estimated loss is accrued.\n\nAmounts received from customers in excess of revenues earned under the\n\npercentage-of-completion method are recorded as advance payments from customers.\n\nAccounts receivable are generally diversified due to the number of commercial\n\nand government entities comprising the Company's customer base and their\n\ndispersion across many geographical regions. At the end of each accounting\n\nperiod, the Company records a reserve for bad debts included in accounts\n\nreceivable based upon its current and historical collection history.\n\nCost of sales include material costs, subcontractor costs, salary and\n\nrelated benefits for the operations and service departments, depreciation and\n\namortization of equipment used in the operations and service departments,\n\namortization of capitalized software costs, royalties and license fee costs,\n\ntravel costs and an overhead allocation. Research and development costs include\n\nsalary and related benefits as well as travel, depreciation and amortization of\n\nresearch and development equipment, an overhead allocation, as well as other\n\ncosts associated with research and development activities. Selling, general and\n\nadministrative costs include salary and related benefits, travel, depreciation\n\nand amortization, marketing and promotional materials, recruiting expenses,\n\nprofessional fees, facility costs, as well as other costs associated with sales,\n\nmarketing, finance and administrative departments.\n\n-19-\n\nSoftware development costs are capitalized upon the establishment of\n\ntechnological feasibility and are amortized over the estimated useful life of\n\nthe software, which to date has been four years or less. Amortization begins in\n\nthe period in which the related product is available for general release to\n\ncustomers. The Company reviews for the impairment of long-lived assets and\n\ncertain identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances\n\nindicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An\n\nimpairment loss would be recognized when estimated future undiscounted cash\n\nflows expected to result from the use of the asset and proceeds from its\n\neventual disposition are less than its carrying amount. Impairment is measured\n\nat fair value.\n\nIn July 2000, CTI acquired all of the outstanding stock of Loronix in a\n\ntransaction accounted for as a pooling of interests. The Company's financial\n\nstatements for the year ended January 31, 2000 include the operations of Loronix\n\nfor the year ended December 31, 1999.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nYear Ended January 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended January 31, 2001\n\nSales. Sales for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2002 (\"fiscal 2001\")\n\nincreased by approximately $45.2 million, or 4%, compared to fiscal year ended\n\nJanuary 31, 2001 (\"fiscal 2000\"). This increase is primarily attributable to an\n\nincrease in sales of ESS products of approximately $48.7 million. Such increase\n\nwas principally due to increased sales to American customers. In addition, sales\n\nof security and business intelligence recording products and service enabling\n\nsignaling software products increased (decreased) by approximately ($8.0)\n\nmillion and $9.3 million, respectively.\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for fiscal 2001 increased by approximately\n\n$42.8 million, or 9%, as compared to fiscal 2000. The increase in cost of sales\n\nis primarily attributable to increased materials and production costs of\n\napproximately $21.8 million due to the increase in sales and increased\n\npersonnel-related costs of approximately $23.2 million due to hiring of\n\nadditional personnel and increased compensation and benefits for existing\n\npersonnel. Gross margins decreased from approximately 60.6% in fiscal 2000 to\n\napproximately 58.6% in fiscal 2001.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and\n\nadministrative expenses for fiscal 2001 increased by approximately $63.4\n\nmillion, or 24%, compared to fiscal 2000, and as a percentage of sales increased\n\nfrom approximately 21.2% in fiscal 2000 to approximately 25.4% in fiscal 2001.\n\nThe increase was primarily due to hiring of additional personnel and increased\n\ncompensation and benefits for existing personnel to support the increased level\n\nof sales during the first half of fiscal 2001.\n\nResearch and Development. Net research and development expenses for\n\nfiscal 2001 increased by approximately $61.1 million, or 26%, compared to fiscal\n\n2000 due to overall growth of research and development operations and the\n\ninitiation of significant new research and development projects. The increase\n\nwas primarily due to the hiring of additional personnel and increased\n\ncompensation and benefits for existing personnel of approximately $32.9 million,\n\n-20-\n\nlower reimbursements for research and development projects submitted for funding\n\nto the OCS of approximately $11.5 million, an increase in depreciation and\n\namortization costs of approximately $6.3 million and an increase in the overhead\n\nallocation of approximately $3.6 million.\n\nAcquisition Expenses and Workforce Reduction and Restructuring Charges.\n\nDuring the 2001 fiscal year, the Company took steps to better align its cost\n\nstructure with the current business environment, to improve the efficiency of\n\nits operations and to better position the Company to realize emerging\n\nopportunities. These steps included a reduction in workforce announced in April\n\n2001 and a restructuring plan announced in December 2001. In connection with the\n\nimplementation of these actions the Company incurred charges of approximately\n\n$63.6 million to cover the costs of severance, elimination of excess facilities\n\nand related leasehold improvements, write-off of certain inventory, property and\n\nequipment and capitalized software and other restructuring related charges, such\n\nas professional fees. The Company expects to pay approximately $11.9 million for\n\nseverance and related charges during the year ended January 31, 2003 and\n\napproximately $24.3 million for lease related obligations at various dates\n\nthrough January 2011.\n\nIn July 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of\n\nLoronix, a company that develops software-based digital video recording and\n\nmanagement systems, and all of the outstanding stock of Syborg\n\nInformationsysteme GmbH, a company that develops software-based digital voice\n\nand internet recording and workforce management systems. In August 2000, the\n\nCompany acquired all of the outstanding stock of Gaya Software Industries Ltd.,\n\na company specializing in software-based intelligent IP gateways and VoIP\n\ntechnology, and all of the outstanding stock of Exalink Ltd., a company\n\nspecializing in protocol gateways and applications software for the delivery of\n\nInternet-based services to all types of wireless devices. These business\n\ncombinations were accounted for as pooling of interests.\n\nIn connection with the above acquisitions, the Company charged to\n\noperations approximately $16.0 million in fiscal 2000 for merger related\n\ncharges. Such charges relate to the following:\n\nAsset write-downs and impairments\n\n---------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions in fiscal 2000, certain assets\n\nbecame impaired due to the existence of duplicative technology, property and\n\nequipment and inventory of the merged companies. Accordingly, these assets were\n\nwritten down to their net realizable value at the time of the mergers and a\n\ncharge of approximately $7.4 million was charged to operations.\n\nProfessional fees and other direct merger expenses\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions in fiscal 2000, the Company\n\nrecorded a charge of approximately $8.6 million for professional fees to\n\nlawyers, investment bankers and accountants, as well as other direct merger\n\ncosts in connection with the mergers, such as printing costs and filing fees.\n\nInterest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income\n\n(expense), net, for fiscal 2001 decreased by approximately $39.1 million as\n\ncompared to fiscal 2000. The principal reasons for the decrease are increased\n\n-21-\n\nnet realized losses and write-downs of the Company's investments and decreased\n\nequity in the earnings of affiliates of approximately $22.1 million, increased\n\ninterest expense of approximately $0.3 million and a change in foreign currency\n\ngains/losses of approximately $20.1 million. These decreases were partially\n\noffset by increased interest and dividend income of approximately $7.6 million.\n\nThe increase in interest and dividend income is primarily a result of the\n\ninclusion of the proceeds for a full year in fiscal 2001 of the Company's $600\n\nmillion 1.50% convertible debentures issued in November and December 2000,\n\npartially offset by the decrease in interest rates during fiscal 2001.\n\nIncome Tax Provision. Provision for income taxes decreased from fiscal\n\n2000 to fiscal 2001 by approximately $14.4 million, or 76%, due to decreased\n\npre-tax income. The Company's overall effective tax rate increased from\n\napproximately 7.0% during fiscal 2000 to approximately 7.5% in fiscal 2001. The\n\nCompany's overall rate of tax is reduced significantly by the tax benefits\n\nassociated with qualified activities of certain of its Israeli subsidiaries,\n\nwhich are entitled to favorable income tax rates under a program of the Israeli\n\nGovernment for \"Approved Enterprise\" investments in that country.\n\nNet Income. Net income decreased by approximately $194.5 million, or\n\n78%, in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000, while as a percentage of sales\n\ndecreased from approximately 20.3% in fiscal 2000 to approximately 4.3% in\n\nfiscal 2001. The decrease resulted primarily from the factors described above.\n\nYear Ended January 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended January 31, 2000\n\nSales. Sales for fiscal 2000 increased by approximately $315.4 million,\n\nor 35%, compared to the year ended January 31, 2000 (\"fiscal 1999\"). This\n\nincrease is primarily attributable to an increase in sales of ESS products of\n\napproximately $277.2 million. Such increase was principally due to increased\n\nsales to European and American customers. In addition, sales of security and\n\nbusiness intelligence recording products and service enabling signaling software\n\nproducts increased by approximately $23.8 million and $18.7 million,\n\nrespectively.\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales for fiscal 2000 increased by approximately\n\n$111.1 million, or 30%, as compared to fiscal 1999. The increase in cost of\n\nsales is primarily attributable to (i) increased materials and production costs\n\nof approximately $62.3 million due to the increase in sales, (ii) increased\n\npersonnel-related costs of approximately $30.3 million due to hiring of\n\nadditional personnel and increased compensation and benefits for existing\n\npersonnel, (iii) increased travel-related costs of approximately $7.1 million\n\nand (iv) an increase in depreciation and amortization costs of approximately\n\n$4.3 million. Gross margins increased from approximately 59.2% in fiscal 1999 to\n\napproximately 60.6% in fiscal 2000.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and\n\nadministrative expenses for fiscal 2000 increased by approximately $65.6\n\nmillion, or 34%, compared to fiscal 1999, and as a percentage of sales was\n\napproximately 21% in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000. The increase was\n\nprimarily due to hiring of additional personnel and increased compensation and\n\nbenefits for existing personnel to support the increased level of sales during\n\nfiscal 2000.\n\n-22-\n\nResearch and Development. Net research and development expenses for\n\nfiscal 2000 increased by approximately $62.4 million, or 37%, compared to fiscal\n\n1999 due to overall growth of research and development operations and the\n\ninitiation of significant new research and development projects. The increase\n\nwas primarily due to hiring of additional personnel and increased compensation\n\nand benefits for existing personnel to support the higher volume of research and\n\ndevelopment activities.\n\nAcquisition Expenses. In February 1999, the Company acquired all of the\n\noutstanding stock of Amarex Technology, Inc., a company that develops\n\nsoftware-based applications for the telephone network operator and call center\n\nmarkets. In August 1999, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of\n\nInTouch Systems, Inc., a company that develops and markets a suite of\n\nintelligent voice-controlled software applications. In July 2000, the Company\n\nacquired all of the outstanding stock of Loronix, a company that develops\n\nsoftware-based digital video recording and management systems, and all of the\n\noutstanding stock of Syborg Informationsysteme GmbH, a company that develops\n\nsoftware-based digital voice and internet recording and workforce management\n\nsystems. In August 2000, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of\n\nGaya Software Industries Ltd., a company specializing in software-based\n\nintelligent IP gateways and voice-over-IP technology, and all of the outstanding\n\nstock of Exalink Ltd., a company specializing in protocol gateways and\n\napplications software for the delivery of Internet-based services to all types\n\nof wireless devices. These business combinations were accounted for as pooling\n\nof interests.\n\nIn connection with the above acquisitions, the Company has charged to\n\noperations approximately $2.0 million and $16.0 million in fiscal 1999 and\n\nfiscal 2000, respectively, for merger related charges. Such charges relate to\n\nthe following:\n\nAsset write-downs and impairments\n\n---------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions in fiscal 2000, certain assets\n\nbecame impaired due to the existence of duplicative technology, property and\n\nequipment and inventory of the merged companies. Accordingly, these assets were\n\nwritten down to their net realizable value at the time of the mergers and a\n\ncharge of approximately $7.4 million was charged to operations.\n\nProfessional fees and other direct merger expenses\n\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nIn connection with the acquisitions in fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000, the\n\nCompany recorded a charge of approximately $2.0 million and $8.6 million,\n\nrespectively, for professional fees to lawyers, investment bankers and\n\naccountants, as well as other direct merger costs in connection with the\n\nmergers, such as printing costs and filing fees.\n\nInterest and Other Income, Net. Interest and other income, net, for\n\nfiscal 2000 increased by approximately $16.7 million as compared to fiscal 1999.\n\nThe principal reasons for the increase are increased interest and dividend\n\nincome of approximately $26.7 million, a change in foreign currency gains/losses\n\nof approximately $8.8 million and a decrease in interest expense of\n\napproximately $1.4 million. These increases were partially offset by an increase\n\nin net realized losses and write-downs on the Company's investments and the\n\nequity in the earnings of affiliates of approximately $20.7 million. In November\n\n-23-\n\nand December 2000 the Company issued $600 million convertible senior debentures\n\nwith the interest income earned on the proceeds of such debentures adding to the\n\nincrease in interest and dividend income in fiscal 2000. The decrease in\n\ninterest expense is primarily a result of the inclusion in fiscal 1999 of the\n\nCompany's 5-3/4% convertible subordinated debentures redeemed in October 1999.\n\nIncome Tax Provision. Provision for income taxes increased from fiscal\n\n1999 to fiscal 2000 by approximately $3.1 million, or 20%, due to increased\n\npre-tax income. The Company's overall effective tax rate decreased from\n\napproximately 8% during fiscal 1999 to approximately 7% in fiscal 2000. The\n\nCompany's overall rate of tax is reduced significantly by the tax benefits\n\nassociated with qualified activities of certain of its Israeli subsidiaries,\n\nwhich are entitled to favorable income tax rates under a program of the Israeli\n\nGovernment for \"Approved Enterprise\" investments in that country.\n\nNet Income. Net income increased by approximately $76.0 million, or\n\n44%, in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999, while as a percentage of sales\n\nincreased from approximately 19% in fiscal 1999 to approximately 20% in fiscal\n\n2000. The increase resulted primarily from the factors described above.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nThe Company's working capital at January 31, 2002 and 2001 was\n\napproximately $2,030.3 million and $1,860.4 million, respectively.\n\nOperations for fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999, after adding\n\nback non-cash items, provided cash of approximately $130.0 million, $309.7\n\nmillion and $208.1 million, respectively. During such years, other changes in\n\nworking capital provided (used) cash of approximately $12.2 million, ($65.2)\n\nmillion and ($30.8) million, respectively, resulting in cash being provided by\n\noperating activities of approximately $142.2 million, $244.5 million and $177.4\n\nmillion, respectively.\n\nInvestment activities for fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 used\n\ncash of approximately $122.4 million, $207.3 million and $475.7 million,\n\nrespectively. These amounts include (i) additions to property, plant and\n\nequipment in fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 of approximately $54.6\n\nmillion, $97.3 million and $85.6 million, respectively; (ii) maturities and\n\nsales (purchases) of bank time deposits and investments, net, of approximately\n\n($44.8) million, ($94.5) million and ($377.6) million, respectively; and (iii)\n\ncapitalization of software development costs of approximately $23.0 million,\n\n$15.5 million and $12.5 million, respectively. The property additions in each of\n\nfiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 include the increase of the Company's fixtures and\n\nequipment and in fiscal 1999 the purchase of land by the Company of\n\napproximately $25.8 million for potential future construction purposes. In\n\naddition, in each of fiscal 2001, 2000 and 1999 the Company increased the amount\n\nof its bank time deposits and investments to better utilize the net proceeds of\n\nthe 2000 and 1998 issuances of convertible debentures.\n\nFinancing activities for fiscal 2001, fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999\n\nprovided cash of approximately $67.0 million, $894.1 million and $53.6 million,\n\nrespectively. These amounts include (i) the net proceeds from the issuance of\n\nconvertible debentures in fiscal 2000 of approximately $588.4 million; (ii)\n\n-24-\n\nproceeds from the issuance of common stock in connection with the exercise of\n\nstock options, warrants and employee stock purchase plan of approximately $28.8\n\nmillion, $111.4 million and $50.6 million, respectively; (iii) net proceeds\n\n(repayments) of bank loans and other debt of approximately $38.2 million, ($0.9)\n\nmillion and $3.1 million, respectively; and (iv) net proceeds from the issuance\n\nof common stock of a subsidiary in connection with public offerings in fiscal\n\n2000 of approximately $195.2 million.\n\nIn November 2000, the Company issued $500 million aggregate principal\n\namount of its 1.50% convertible senior debentures due December 2005. In December\n\n2000, the Company issued an additional $100 million aggregate principal amount\n\nof its 1.50% convertible senior debentures due December 2005 as a result of the\n\ninitial purchaser exercising in full their over-allotment option.\n\nAs of January 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding convertible\n\ndebentures of $600 million. In January 2002, Verint took a long-term bank loan\n\nin the amount of $42 million. This loan, which matures in February 2003, bears\n\ninterest at LIBOR plus 0.55% and may be prepaid without penalty. The loan is\n\nguaranteed by CTI.\n\nThe Company has obtained bank guaranties primarily for performance of\n\ncertain obligations under contracts with customers. These guaranties, which\n\naggregated approximately $23.4 million at January 31, 2002, are to be released\n\nby the Company's performance of specified contract milestones, which are\n\nscheduled to be completed primarily during 2002.\n\nThe Company leases office, manufacturing, and warehouse space under\n\nnon-cancelable operating leases. As of January 31, 2002, the minimum annual rent\n\nobligations of the Company were approximately as follows:\n\nTwelve Months Ended\n\nJanuary 31, Amount\n\n------------------- ------\n\n(In thousands)\n\n2003 $ 34,007\n\n2004 30,234\n\n2005 20,253\n\n2006 18,981\n\n2007 and thereafter 33,666\n\n-----------\n\n$ 137,141\n\n===========\n\n-25-\n\nOn February 1, 2002, Verint acquired the digital video recording\n\nbusiness of Lanex, LLC. The Lanex business provides digital video recording\n\nsolutions for security and surveillance applications primarily to North American\n\nbanks. The purchase price consisted of $9.5 million in cash and a $2.2 million\n\nconvertible note. The note is non-interest bearing and matures on February 1,\n\n2004. The holder of the note may elect to convert the note, in whole or in part,\n\ninto shares of Verint's common stock at a conversion price of $16.06 per share\n\nat any time on or after the completion of an initial public offering by Verint.\n\nThe note is guaranteed by CTI. Pro forma results of operations have not been\n\npresented because the effects of this acquisition are not material.\n\nThe Company believes that its existing working capital, together with\n\nfunds generated from operations, will be sufficient to provide for its planned\n\noperations for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Company regularly examines opportunities for strategic acquisitions\n\nof other companies or lines of business and anticipates that it may from time to\n\ntime issue additional debt and/or equity securities either as direct\n\nconsideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be used (in\n\nwhole or in part) in payment for acquired securities or assets. The issuance of\n\nsuch securities could be expected to have a dilutive impact on the Company's\n\nshareholders, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any acquired\n\nbusiness would contribute positive operating results commensurate with the\n\nassociated investment.\n\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources have not been, and are\n\nnot anticipated to be, materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the\n\nability of its foreign subsidiaries to pay dividends or by withholding taxes\n\nassociated with any such dividend payments.\n\nCERTAIN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nThe Company derives the majority of its revenue from the\n\ntelecommunications industry, which is facing an unprecedented recession. This\n\nhas resulted in a significant reduction of capital expenditures made by TSPs.\n\nThe Company's operating results and financial condition have been, and will\n\ncontinue to be, adversely affected by the severe decline in technology purchases\n\nand capital expenditures by TSPs worldwide and by unfavorable global economic\n\nconditions. Consequently, the Company's operating results have deteriorated\n\nsignificantly in recent periods and may continue to deteriorate in future\n\nperiods if such conditions remain in effect. For these reasons and the risk\n\nfactors outlined below, it has been and continues to be very difficult for the\n\nCompany to accurately forecast future revenues and operating results.\n\nThe Company's business is particularly dependent on the strength of the\n\ntelecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry, in general, and\n\nthe Company, in particular, have been negatively affected by, among other\n\nfactors, the high costs and large debt positions incurred by some TSPs to expand\n\ncapacity and enable the provision of future services (and the corresponding\n\nrisks associated with the development, marketing and adoption of these services\n\nas discussed below), including the cost of acquisitions of licenses to provide\n\nfuture broadband services and reductions in TSPs' actual and projected revenues\n\nand deterioration in their actual and projected operating results. Accordingly,\n\nTSPs have significantly reduced their actual and planned expenditures to expand\n\nor replace equipment and delayed and reduced the deployment of services. A\n\n-26-\n\nnumber of TSPs, including certain customers of the Company, have indicated the\n\nexistence of conditions of excess capacity in certain markets.\n\nIn addition, TSPs have delayed the planned introduction of new\n\nservices, such as broadband mobile telephone services, that would be supported\n\nby certain of the Company's products. Certain of the Company's customers also\n\nhave implemented changes in procurement practices and procedures, including\n\nlimitations on purchases in anticipation of estimated future capacity\n\nrequirements, and in the management and use of their networks, that have had an\n\nadverse affect on the Company's sales and order backlog, which also has made it\n\nvery difficult for the Company to project future sales. The continuation and/or\n\nexacerbation of these trends will have an adverse effect on the Company's future\n\nresults. In addition to loss of revenue, weakness in the telecommunications\n\nindustry has affected and will continue to affect the Company's business by\n\nincreasing the risks of credit or business failures of suppliers, customers or\n\ndistributors, by customer requirements for vendor financing, by delays and\n\ndefaults in customer or distributor payments, and by price reductions instituted\n\nby competitors to retain or acquire market share.\n\nThe Company's current plan of operations is predicated in part on a\n\nrecovery in capital expenditures by its customers. In the absence of such\n\nimprovement, the Company would experience further deterioration in its operating\n\nresults, and may determine to modify its plan for future operations accordingly,\n\nwhich may include, among other things, additional reductions in its workforce.\n\nThe Company intends to continue to make significant investments in its\n\nbusiness, and to examine opportunities for growth through acquisitions and\n\nstrategic investments. These activities may involve significant expenditures and\n\nobligations that cannot readily be curtailed or reduced if anticipated demand\n\nfor the associated products does not materialize or is delayed. The impact of\n\nthese decisions on future financial results cannot be predicated with assurance,\n\nand the Company's commitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to\n\ndownturns in its markets, technology changes and shifts in competitive\n\nconditions. The Company also may not be able to identify future suitable merger\n\nor acquisition candidates, and even if the Company does identify suitable\n\ncandidates, it may not be able to make these transactions on commercially\n\nacceptable terms, or at all. If the Company does make acquisitions, it may not\n\nbe able to successfully incorporate the personnel, operations and customers of\n\nthese companies into the Company's business. In addition, the Company may fail\n\nto achieve the anticipated synergies from the combined businesses, including\n\nmarketing, product integration, distribution, product development and other\n\nsynergies. The integration process may further strain the Company's existing\n\nfinancial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures. This may\n\nresult in the diversion of management and financial resources from the Company's\n\ncore business objectives. In addition, an acquisition or merger may require the\n\nCompany to utilize cash reserves, incur debt or issue equity securities, which\n\nmay result in a dilution of existing stockholders, and the Company may be\n\nnegatively impacted by the assumption of liabilities of the merged or acquired\n\ncompany. Due to rapidly changing market conditions, the Company may find the\n\nvalue of its acquired technologies and related intangible assets, such as\n\ngoodwill as recorded in the Company's financial statements, to be impaired,\n\nresulting in charges to operations. The Company may also fail to retain the\n\nacquired or merged companies' key employees and customers.\n\n-27-\n\nThe Company has made, and in the future, may continue to make strategic\n\ninvestments in other companies. These investments have been made in, and future\n\ninvestments will likely be made in, immature businesses with unproven track\n\nrecords and technologies. Such investments have a high degree of risk, with the\n\npossibility that the Company may lose the total amount of its investments. The\n\nCompany may not be able to identify suitable investment candidates, and, even if\n\nit does, the Company may not be able to make those investments on acceptable\n\nterms, or at all. In addition, even if the Company makes investments, it may not\n\ngain strategic benefits from those investments.\n\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological\n\nchange. The introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications market\n\nand new alternatives for the delivery of services are having, and can be\n\nexpected to continue to have, a profound effect on competitive conditions in the\n\nmarket and the success of market participants, including the Company. The\n\nCompany's continued success will depend on its ability to correctly anticipate\n\ntechnological trends in its industries, to react quickly and effectively to such\n\ntrends and to enhance its existing products and to introduce new products on a\n\ntimely and cost-effective basis. As a result, the life cycle of the Company's\n\nproducts is difficult to estimate. In addition, changing industry and market\n\nconditions may dictate strategic decisions to restructure some business units\n\nand discontinue others. Discontinuing a business unit or product line may result\n\nin the Company recording accrued liabilities for special charges, such as costs\n\nassociated with a reduction in work force. These strategic decisions could\n\nresult in changes to determinations regarding a product's useful life and the\n\nrecoverability of the carrying basis of certain assets.\n\nThe Company's products involve sophisticated hardware and software\n\ntechnology that performs critical functions to highly demanding standards. There\n\ncan be no assurance that the Company's current or future products will not\n\ndevelop operational problems, which could have a material adverse effect on the\n\nCompany. The Company relies on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers\n\nfor specific components and may not be able to find alternate manufacturers that\n\nmeet its requirements and existing or alternative sources may not be available\n\non favorable terms and conditions. Thus, if there is a shortage of supply for\n\nthese components, the Company may experience an interruption in its product\n\nsupply. In addition, loss of third party software licensing would materially and\n\nadversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of\n\noperations.\n\nThe telecommunications industry continues to undergo significant change\n\nas a result of deregulation and privatization worldwide, reducing restrictions\n\non competition in the industry. Unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment\n\nalso may have an impact on the Company's revenues and/or costs in any given part\n\nof the world. The worldwide ESS system industry is already highly competitive\n\nand the Company expects competition to intensify. The Company believes that\n\nexisting competitors will continue to present substantial competition, and that\n\nother companies, many with considerably greater financial, marketing and sales\n\nresources than the Company, may enter the ESS system markets. Moreover, as the\n\nCompany enters into new markets as a result of its own research and development\n\nefforts or acquisitions, it is likely to encounter new competitors.\n\nThe market for the Company's digital security and surveillance and\n\nenterprise business intelligence products has also been affected by weakness in\n\ngeneral economic conditions, delays or reductions in customers' purchases of\n\ncapital equipment and uncertainties relating to government expenditure programs.\n\n-28-\n\nBudgetary constraints, uncertainties resulting from the introduction of new\n\ntechnologies and shifts in the pattern of government expenditures resulting from\n\nincreased uncertainties in the market for monitoring systems, resulting in\n\ncertain instances in the attenuation of government procurement programs beyond\n\ntheir originally expected performance periods and an increased incidence of\n\ndelay, cancellation or reduction of planned projects. Competitive conditions in\n\nthis sector have also been affected by the increasing use by certain potential\n\ngovernment customers of their own internal development resources rather than\n\noutside vendors to provide certain technical solutions. In addition, a number of\n\nestablished government contractors, particularly developers and integrators of\n\ntechnology products, have taken steps to redirect their marketing strategies and\n\nproduct plans in reaction to cut-backs in their traditional areas of focus,\n\nresulting in an increase in the number of competitors and the range of products\n\noffered in response to particular requests for proposals. The lack of\n\npredictability in the timing and scope of government procurements have similarly\n\nmade planning decisions more difficult and have increased the associated risks.\n\nThe Company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales\n\nand operating profit from contracts for large system installations with major\n\ncustomers. The Company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its\n\nproduct development and marketing strategies. Contracts for large installations\n\ntypically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, and the\n\nability of the Company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to\n\npredict. The timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins\n\nassociated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast, and may\n\nvary substantially from transaction to transaction. The Company's future\n\noperating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the\n\noperating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted\n\ndifferent strategies, and also may be more volatile than the Company has\n\nexperienced in prior periods. The degree of dependence by the Company on large\n\nsystem orders, and the investment required to enable the Company to perform such\n\norders, without assurance of continuing order flow from the same customers and\n\npredictability of gross margins on any future orders, increase the risk\n\nassociated with its business. The Company's gross margins also may be adversely\n\naffected by increases in material or labor costs, obsolescence charges, price\n\ncompetition and changes in channels of distribution or in the mix of products\n\nsold.\n\nPolitical, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect\n\nthe Company's operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in\n\n1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab\n\nneighbors, and the continued state of hostility, varying in degree and\n\nintensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October\n\n2000, there has been a significant increase in violence, primarily in the West\n\nBank and Gaza Strip, and more recently Israel has experienced terrorist\n\nincidents within its borders. As a result, negotiations between Israel and\n\nrepresentatives of the Palestinian Authority have been sporadic and have failed\n\nto result in peace. The Company could be adversely affected by hostilities\n\ninvolving Israel, the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and\n\nits trading partners, or a significant downturn in the economic or financial\n\ncondition of Israel. In addition, the sale of products manufactured in Israel\n\nmay be adversely affected in certain countries by restrictive laws, policies or\n\npractices directed toward Israel or companies having operations in Israel. The\n\ncontinuation or exacerbation of violent conflicts involving Israel and other\n\nnations may impede the Company's ability to sell its products in certain\n\ncountries. In addition, some of the Company's employees in Israel are subject to\n\nbeing called upon to perform military service in Israel, and their absence may\n\nhave an adverse effect upon the Company's operations. Generally, unless exempt,\n\n-29-\n\nmale adult citizens and permanent residents of Israel under the age of 54 are\n\nobligated to perform up to 36 days of military reserve duty annually.\n\nAdditionally, all such residents are subject to being called to active duty at\n\nany time under emergency circumstances. These conditions could disrupt the\n\nCompany's operations in Israel and its business, financial condition and results\n\nof operations could be adversely affected.\n\nThe Company's costs of operations have at times been affected by\n\nchanges in the cost of its operations in Israel, resulting from changes in the\n\nvalue of the Israeli shekel relative to the United States dollar, and from\n\ndifficulties in attracting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and\n\ntechnical personnel in Israel, where the availability of such personnel has at\n\ntimes been severely limited. Changes in these cost factors have from time to\n\ntime been significant and difficult to predict, and could in the future have a\n\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe Company's historical operating results reflect substantial benefits\n\nit has received from programs sponsored by the Israeli government for the\n\nsupport of research and development, as well as tax moratoriums and favorable\n\ntax rates associated with investments in approved projects (\"Approved\n\nEnterprises\") in Israel. Some of these programs and tax benefits have ceased and\n\nothers may not be continued in the future and the availability of such benefits\n\nto the Company may be affected by a number of factors, including budgetary\n\nconstraints resulting from adverse economic conditions, government policies and\n\nthe Company's ability to satisfy eligibility criteria.\n\nThe Israeli government has reduced the benefits available under some of\n\nthese programs in recent years, and Israeli government authorities have\n\nindicated that the government may further reduce or eliminate some of these\n\nbenefits in the future. The Company has regularly participated in a conditional\n\ngrant program administered by the OCS under which it has received significant\n\nbenefits through reimbursement of up to 50% of qualified research and\n\ndevelopment expenditures. Verint currently pays royalties, of between 3% and 5%\n\n(or 6% under certain circumstances) of associated product revenues (including\n\nservice and other related revenues) to the Government of Israel for repayment of\n\nbenefits received under this program. Such royalty payments by Verint are\n\ncurrently required to be made until the government has been reimbursed the\n\namounts received b"
