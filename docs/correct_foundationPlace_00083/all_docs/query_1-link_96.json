        "text": "10/25. Silicon Graphics Inc. (SGI) filed a complaint in U.S. District Court (WDWisc) against ATI Technologies alleging patent infringement. The complaint, filed on October 24, alleges infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,650,327 which relates to graphics processing.\n\nOn October 25, 2006, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) announced that it completed its acquisition of ATI Technologies. See, AMD release.\n\nSGI is the assignee of U.S. Patent No. 6,650,327, titled \"Display system having floating point rasterization and floating point framebuffering\".\n\nDennis McKenna, CEO of SGI, stated in a release that \"The Company's technology covered by the '327 patent is an important resource in achieving enhanced graphics processing demanded by today's computer systems ... SGI has licensed this technology to ATI's major competitors and, as I have previously been stating publicly, SGI intends to aggressively protect and enforce its IP. This is the first visible step in that process.\"\n\nAn AMD spokesman told TLJ that AMD is still reviewing the complaint, but will \"aggressively defend\" itself. He added that AMD does not expect the suit to create any issues for the merger, or with its plans going forward.\n\nSGI is a Delaware corporation based in Mountain View, California. Neither ATI nor AMD incorporated in, or established a major presence in, Wisconsin.\n\n10/25. President Bush gave a speech at a Congressional campaign event in Sarasota, Florida on October 24. He discussed the extra-judicial electronic surveillance program of the National Security Agency (NSA) where one party in inside the U.S. and one party is outside the U.S.\n\nHe said that \"We had a series of interesting votes in Washington, D.C. recently that should explain the fundamental differences between how we view the war on terror and how the Democrats view the war on terror. I felt that the President should do everything in his power within the Constitution to protect you. And therefore, after 9/11, I made a couple of decisions that recently were brought to a vote on the floor of the House of Representatives, which should give you an indication about the differences of opinion.\"\n\nPresident Bush did not reference any bill numbers or titles. However, the House approved HR 5825, the \"Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act\", sponsored by Rep. Heather Wilson (R-NM), on September 28, 2006. The House vote was 232-191. Republicans voted 214-13, while Democrats voted 18-177. See, Roll Call No. 502. See also, story titled \"Bush Discusses Surveillance, FISA and HR 5825\" in TLJ Daily E-Mail Alert No. 1,461, October 4, 2006.\n\nHe continued that \"I believe that we must work to prevent attacks from happening in the first place, but here in the homeland -- by staying on the offense. But here in the homeland, I understand that the enemy has to be right one time, and we have to be right a hundred percent of the time in order to protect you. And therefore I feel it's important to make sure our professionals have the tools necessary to protect you.\"\n\n\"I felt like that if al Qaeda or an al Qaeda affiliate was making a phone call into the United States of America from outside our country, our intelligence professionals need to know why. This is a different kind of war. Past wars -- in past wars, you could watch flotillas of ships or count airplanes to determine the intent or the strength of the enemy; you could watch manpower being moved. This is a different kind of war. It's a war that requires intelligence so that we can make sure our professionals are able to protect you\", said Bush.\n\nHe added that \"The idea of people -- professionals being able to listen to al Qaeda and its affiliates came to a vote on the floor of the United States Congress. The American people must fully understand that the vast majority of Democrats opposed the right of this administration to have a tool necessary to protect you. We just have a different view. They must not think we're at war. They must think that the best way to protect you is to respond after the attack.\"\n\nPresident also held a long news conference in Washington DC on October 25 at which he discussed the war on terrorism, Iraq, Iran and North Korea. See, transcript.\n\nHe stated that terrorists \"are lethal, cold-blooded killers. And we must do everything we can to protect the American people, including questioning detainees, or listening to their phone calls from outside the country to inside the country. And there was -- as you know, there was some recent votes on that issue. And the Democrats voted against giving our professionals the skill -- the tools necessary to protect the American people.\"\n\n10/20. Peter Mandelson, the European Commissioner for Trade, gave a speech in Monaco on ideas, intellectual property rights (IPR), globalization, and trade.\n\nMandelson (at right) said that Europe trades in ideas that are transformed into products and services, that those ideas are being stolen, and that nations need to address this.\n\nHe said that \"I'm steering towards the question of IPR and counterfeiting because I want to use it as an example of the kind of issue that is around the next corner in trade policy. And it is particularly important for people who trade in ideas -- ideas as services or ideas as manufactured products.\"\n\nHe said that until recently counterfeiting meant fake Gucci purses and Rolex watches. However, he said that it is much bigger now, and includes \"fake foodstuffs and drinks, fake car parts; fake airplane parts -- I mean think about that for a moment, fake aircraft parts! -- fake electrical appliances and fake toys.\"\n\nHe continued that counterfeiting now includes \"fake antibiotics, fake avian-flu drugs, fake anti-malarials and fake insulin. 800000 doses of fake medicine were seized at EU borders in 2004. Most of those fake drugs were headed for the world's poorest countries. Still think its harmless?\"\n\nHe said that \"it goes far beyond counterfeit manufactures. Counterfeit music and film -- often easily available on the internet -- is undermining the music and film industries' investments in artist development. That single issue of internet music piracy and the abuse of music copyright is a significant part of whats standing between Russia and the US on the issue of Russias accession to the WTO to which I have added Europe's voice -- so it matters.\"\n\nHe said that \"two thirds of counterfeit goods intercepted on their way into the EU are made in China. Behind China come Russia, the Ukraine, Turkey, Chile.\"\n\nHe also recited some of the things that the EU is doing in response. He said We've teamed up with the US this year to create joint task forces in our embassies, and customs services and to share intelligence on border trafficking.\"\n\nHe added that \"We've been strengthening our resources on the ground in China to help EU businesses find reliable suppliers, spot the risks from IP theft and deal with the Chinese legal system -- which is, well, opaque, shall we say. Weve set benchmarks for intercepting counterfeit goods and we expect the Chinese to meet them.\"\n\nHe also suggested that it is in the interest of China to protect IPR, and that it is beginning to act accordingly. He said that \"I think that I detect a definite shift in approach in China, certainly a major change of tone. There is a willingness to engage on IPR that wasnt there even two years ago. Why? Partly because of carefully applied and constructive pressure for action. But there is also this: last month China became the fifth biggest filer for patents in the global economy after the US, Japan, Korea and the EU.\n\nHe elaborated that \"half or more of those patents are foreign companies looking to protect their own production in China from local piracy. But an increasing number of Chinese companies are looking to the Chinese system to protect their own innovation.\"\n\n\"The infant Chinese film industry is being crippled by film piracy in China. The Chinese governments attempts to protect the official branding of the 2008 Beijing Olympics is being undermined by the flow of counterfeit knock-offs of official merchandise. If Chinese businesses dont have confidence in the protection of IPR in their own market then they wont innovate.\" Mandelson said that \"The lesson -- if youre inclined to draw it, and I think the Chinese government is drawing it -- is that tolerating intellectual property theft is a dead end for just about everyone.\"\n\nHe also commented on those persons who argue against protection of IPR with slogans such as \"corporate agenda\" and \"people not patents\".\n\nHe said that \"When we privatise knowledge we have to do so with great care.\" He urged consideration of \"the incentive that drives us to innovate in the first place\". He argued that Europe produces many services and products that are idea based, and \"To preserve the innovation that creates those things, and to preserve the quality dividend that attaches to those things, those ideas need to be better protected.\"\n\nHe concluded that \"IPR protection is not a ``corporate agenda´´. And it is not a favour emerging economies like China are doing for us. If you want to get ahead, move up the value chain, then looking the other way on intellectual property piracy will come back and bite you. Its an essential element of an economy that trades in ideas.\"\n\nIn this speech, he referenced many types of intellectual property that should be protected, including trademarks that consist of European place names used to identify food products. He said that Camembert is an idea.\n\nThe House will not meet. It may return from it elections recess on Monday, November 13, 2006.
