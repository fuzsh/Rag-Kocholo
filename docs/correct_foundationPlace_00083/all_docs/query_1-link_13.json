In addition, during such period, CTI's holding company operations experienced negative cash flows from operations.

Cash, cash equivalents, bank time deposits and restricted cash excludes ARS.

Following such payment, all ARS and cash proceeds from sales of ARS became unrestricted. In addition, in November 2011, CTI sold ARS with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $61.2 million and a carrying amount of $50.0 million for approximately $49.2 million.\n\nAs of October 31, 2011 and July 31, 2011, CTI and its Comverse subsidiary had combined indebtedness of approximately $2.2 million.\n\nVerint Segment\n\nVerint is a majority-owned subsidiary of CTI. Its common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol \"VRNT.\"\n\nFor additional information concerning Verint's results for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2011, please see the press release issued by Verint on December 7, 2011, which is available on Verint's website, www.verint.com and is included as an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by Verint with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\"), and Verint's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the three months ended October 31, 2011.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nWe will be conducting a conference call today at 8:30 am to discuss our results for the third quarter. An on-line, real-time webcast of the conference call will be available on our website at www.cmvt.com. The conference call can also be accessed live via telephone at 1-678-825-8369. Please dial in 5-10 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.\n\nA replay of the call will be available, beginning at approximately 11:00 am on December 9, 2011, for thirty days, at 1-404-537-3406, and archived via webcast at www.cmvt.com. The replay access code is 34995666.\n\nSegment Performance\n\nCTI evaluates its business by assessing the performance of each of its operating segments. CTI's Chief Executive Officer is its chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\"). The CODM uses segment performance, as defined below, as the primary basis for assessing the financial results of the operating segments and for the allocation of resources. Segment performance, as the company defines it in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standard Board's (\"FASB\") guidance relating to segment reporting, is not necessarily comparable to other similarly titled captions of other companies. Segment performance, as defined by management, represents operating results of a segment without the impact of significant expenditures incurred by the segment in connection with the efforts to become or remain current in periodic reporting obligations under the federal securities laws which are expected to be eliminated over time, certain non-cash charges, and certain other insignificant gains and charges.\n\nSegment performance is computed by management as income (loss) from operations adjusted for the following: (i) stock-based compensation expense; (ii) amortization of acquisition-related intangibles; (iii) compliance-related professional fees; (iv) compliance-related compensation and other expenses; (v) impairment charges; (vi) litigation settlements and related costs; (vii) acquisition-related charges; (viii) restructuring and integration charges; and (ix) certain other gains and charges. Compliance-related professional fees and compliance-related compensation and other expenses recorded for fiscal periods ended on or before July 31, 2011 relate to fees and expenses incurred in connection with (a) the company's efforts to complete current and previously issued financial statements and audits of such financial statements, and (b) the company's efforts to become current in its periodic reporting obligations under the federal securities laws. Compliance-related professional fees and compliance-related compensation and other expenses recorded for the three months ended October 31, 2011 relate to fees and expenses incurred in connection with the timely filing of the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended July 31, 2011 and CTI's efforts to remediate material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that are expected to be eliminated over time.\n\nIn evaluating each segment's performance, management uses segment revenue, which consists of revenue generated by the segment, including intercompany revenue. Certain segment performance adjustments relate to expenses included in the calculation of income (loss) from operations, while, from time to time, certain segment performance adjustments may be presented as adjustments to revenue. In calculating Verint's segment performance for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2011, the presentation of segment revenue gives effect to segment revenue adjustments that represent the impact of fair value adjustments required under the FASB's guidance relating to acquired customer support contracts that would have otherwise been recognized as revenue on a standalone basis with respect to acquisitions consummated by Verint during the periods presented. Verint did not have a segment revenue adjustment for the three or nine months ended October 31, 2010.\n\nPresentation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nCTI provides Non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Comverse Technology, Inc. and Non-GAAP earnings (loss) per share attributable to Comverse Technology, Inc.'s shareholders as additional information for its operating results. These measures are not in accordance with, or alternatives for, GAAP financial measures and may be different from, or not comparable to similarly titled or other non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. CTI believes that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures provides useful information to investors regarding certain additional financial and business trends relating to its results of operations as viewed by management in monitoring the company's businesses. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing financial results and for planning purposes. See \"Comverse Technology, Inc. and Subsidiaries Consolidated Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" below.\n\nAbout Comverse Technology, Inc.\n\nComverse Technology, Inc., through its wholly-owned subsidiary Comverse, is the world's leading provider of software and systems enabling converged billing and active customer management and value-added voice, messaging and mobile Internet services. Comverse's extensive customer base spans more than 125 countries and covers over 450 communication service providers serving more than two billion subscribers. CTI also holds majority ownership positions in Verint (Nasdaq:VRNT) and privately-held Starhome.\n\nThe Comverse Technology logo is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/newsroom/prs/?pkgid=7454\n\nForward-Looking Statements\n\nCertain statements appearing in this press release constitute \"forward-looking statements.\" Forward-looking statements include financial projections, statements of plans and objectives for future operations, statements of future economic performance, and statements of assumptions relating thereto. In some cases, forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as \"may,\" \"expects,\" \"plans,\" \"anticipates,\" \"estimates,\" \"believes,\" \"potential,\" \"projects,\" \"forecasts,\" \"intends,\" or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results, performance and the timing of events to differ materially from those anticipated, expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this press release. These and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors are described in CTI's filings with the SEC, including, without limitation, in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2011 (the \"2010 Form 10-K\") and in Part II, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" of subsequently filed Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, and include, among other things, the following risks and uncertainties:\n\nthe risk of diminishment in our capital resources as a result of, among other things, future negative cash flows from operations at Comverse or the continued incurrence of significant expenses by CTI and Comverse in connection with the filing by CTI of periodic reports under the federal securities laws and the remediation of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting;\n\nthe continuation of material weaknesses or the discovery of additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and any delay in the implementation of remedial measures;\n\nthe review of the periodic reports of CTI and Verint Systems by the staff of the SEC could result in amendments to our and Verint Systems' financial information or other disclosures;\n\nthe risk that, if CTI ceases to maintain a majority ownership of Verint Systems' outstanding equity securities and ceases to maintain control over Verint's operations, it may be required to no longer consolidate Verint's financial statements within its consolidated financial statements and, in such event, the presentation of CTI's consolidated financial statements would be materially different from the presentation for the fiscal periods covered by this Quarterly Report and for the fiscal years covered by the 2010 Form 10-K;\n\nwe may need to recognize further impairment of intangible assets or financial assets and goodwill;\n\nthe effects of any potential decline or weakness in the global economy (due to among other things, the downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and European sovereign debt crisis) on the telecommunications industry, which may result in reduced information technology spending and reduced demand for our subsidiaries' products and services;\n\ndisruption in the credit and capital markets may limit our ability to access capital;\n\npotential loss of business opportunities due to continued concern on the part of customers, partners, investors and employees about our financial condition and CTI's previous extended delay in becoming current in its periodic reporting obligations under the federal securities laws;\n\nrapidly changing technology in our subsidiaries' industries and our subsidiaries' ability to enhance existing products and develop and market new products;\n\nour subsidiaries' dependence on contracts for large systems and large installations for a significant portion of their sales and operating results including, among other things, the lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, the difficulty predicting their ability to obtain particular contracts and the timing and scope of these opportunities;\n\nthe difficulty in predicting operating results as a result of lengthy and variable sales cycles, focus on large customers and installations, short delivery windows required by customers, and the high percentage of orders typically generated late in the fiscal quarter;\n\nthe deferral or loss of one or more significant orders or customers or a delay in an expected implementation of such an order could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in any fiscal period, particularly if there are significant sales and marketing expenses associated with the deferred, lost or delayed sales;\n\nthe potential incurrence by our subsidiaries of significant costs to correct previously undetected operational problems in their complex products;\n\nour subsidiaries' dependence on a limited number of suppliers and manufacturers for certain components and third-party software could cause a supply shortage and/or interruptions in product supply;\n\nthe risk that increased competition could force our subsidiaries to lower their prices or take other actions to differentiate their products and changes in the competitive environment in the telecommunications industry worldwide could seriously affect Comverse's business;\n\nthe risk that increased costs or reduced demand for Comverse's products resulting from compliance with evolving telecommunications regulations and the implementation of new standards may adversely affect our business and financial condition;\n\nthe risk that the failure or delay in achieving interoperability of Comverse's products with its customers' systems could impair its ability to sell its products;\n\nthe competitive bidding process used to generate sales requires our subsidiaries to expend significant resources with no guarantee of recoupment;\n\nour subsidiaries' inability to maintain relationships with value-added resellers, systems integrators and other third parties that market and sell their products could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations;\n\nthird parties' infringement of our subsidiaries' proprietary technology and the infringement by our subsidiaries of the intellectual property of third parties, including through the use of free or open source software;\n\nrisks of certain contractual obligations of our subsidiaries exposing them to uncapped or other significant liabilities;\n\nthe impact of mergers and acquisitions, including, but not limited to, difficulties relating to integration, the achievement of anticipated synergies and the implementation of required controls, procedures and policies at the acquired

operations in countries with a history of corruption, entering into transactions with foreign governments and ensuring compliance with laws that prohibit improper payments;\n\nadverse fluctuations of

uncertainties relating to research and development grants, tax benefits and the ability of our Israeli subsidiaries to pay dividends;\n\npotential decline in the price of CTI's common stock in the event of sales of a significant number of shares by shareholders who received shares as part of a class action settlement and by holders of securities awarded under CTI's equity incentive plans;\n\nrisks associated with Verint's significant leverage resulting from its current debt position, including Verint's ability to maintain compliance with the leverage ratio covenant under its credit facility;\n\nthe ability of Verint to pay its indebtedness as it becomes due or refinance its indebtedness as well as comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained therein;\n\nrisks that the credit ratings of CTI and its subsidiaries could be downgraded or placed on a credit watch based on, among other things, its financial results;\n\nVerint's dependence on government contracts and the possibility that U.S. or foreign governments could refuse to purchase Verint's Communications Intelligence solutions or could deactivate Verint's security clearances in their countries;\n\nrisks associated with Verint's handling, or the perception of mishandling, of customers' sensitive information;\n\nVerint's ability to receive or retain necessary export licenses or authorizations; and\n\nother risks described in filings with the SEC.\n\nThe documents and reports we file with the SEC are available through CTI, or its website, www.cmvt.com, or through the SEC's

AND SUBSIDIARIES SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION (Unaudited) (In thousands) The company has revised its segment reporting as a result of the implementation of the Phase II Business Transformation at Comverse and the manner in which its CODM reviews the operating performance of Comverse and allocates resources to its operating segments. The company is providing the following additional information, presenting the results of operations of the previous Comverse reporting segment. The company believes that such presentation provides useful information to investors regarding the performance of the company's Comverse subsidiary, including comparability to previously reported financial information. The additional information provided is not a replacement for or subset of business segment information presented above. The results of operations presented in the column below under \"Comverse Other\" relate to all the operations of the Company's Comverse subsidiary, other than the company's Comverse BSS and Comverse VAS segments and includes the Comverse MI operating segment, Comverse's Netcentrex operations and Comverse's global corporate functions that support its business units. The information presented for \"Comverse Other\" includes unallocated global corporate function costs that are consistent with prior internal allocation practices. The company determined that the operating segments of the company's Comverse subsidiary included in \"Comverse Other\" do not meet the aggregation criteria under the segment reporting guidance; specifically they do not have similar economic characteristics, which would permit the presentation of \"Comverse Other\" results of operations as a separate reportable segment in the revised segment reporting information. Accordingly, such results of operations of \"Comverse Other\" are included in the company's \"All Other\" column.\n\nComverse\n\nBSS Comverse\n\nVAS Comverse\n\nOther Total\n\nComverse (In thousands)
