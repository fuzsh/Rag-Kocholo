        "text": "Beware of the GPS week number roll-over problem on 22 August 1999. The year 2000 problem, with the year roll over from 99 to 00 has received much attention. But is that also the case with the global positioning system (GPS) week number roll-over problem?\n\nIn telecommunications, the GPS is used at some places to synchronize the timing or the frequency of systems. So just in the same way that we look at the year 2000 problem, each user should check if their GPS-based system will be working correctly on 22 August 1999, the first day that the GPS week number will roll over from 1023 to 0. The reason is the limited number of bits (10) used in the GPS navigation message. If the software in the GPS receiver is not corrected, then the receiver will internally interpret the new week 0 as 6 January 1980. It might then stop tracking any satellite and the systems might perform worse or even loose synchronization.  Working Party 7A, Study Group 7 (Science services), Radiocommunication Sector.\n\ntele.ring and Alcatel sign contract for nationwide GSM network in Austria. tele.ring  majority owned by Mannesmann  has awarded to Alcatel a major contract for the turnkey delivery of key elements for its new GSM 1800 network in Austria, valued at FRF 1.9 billion. Deliveries will start immediately in order to meet the planned service launch within less than 12 months.\n\nThe contract includes the complete EVOLIUM radio solutions (GSM base station subsystems and microwave transmission), the comprehensive GPRS (general packet radio service) system for high-speed data transmission over GSM, the intelligent network platform and project management.  Alcatel.\n\nAnalysys launches newentrants.com. A fully interactive Web service tracking telecommunication entrants in the Western European fixed telephony market has been launched by telecommunications consultancy Analysys.\n\nThe new site (www.newentrants.com), which is updated quarterly, features profiles of over 300 new entrants across 16 countries and contains contact details for more than 500 companies. The former monopoly operators are also profiled, enabling users to track the performance of all the key players in the business.\n\nIn addition, the site includes operator benchmarks providing the ability to compare and contrast key financial and operational statistics for the major new network operators and the incumbent operators, and a share indices service, updated daily, which enables users to compare the individual share performance of the major listed network operators.  Analysys.\n\nAlcatel to sell European transmission assets of DSC Communications Corporation to Tellabs, Inc. Alcatel and Tellabs, Inc., an American supplier of telecommunications equipment, have signed an agreement under which Alcatel is selling to Tellabs the European transmission assets of the former DSC Communications Corporation for some USD 110 million.\n\nIn the framework of the deal, both parties also entered into a patent cross-licensing agreement according to which the parties will license to one another their respective patents. In particular, Tellabs will benefit over the next four years of the patent licences of Alcatel's extensive range of SDH, SONET and WDM technologies.\n\nAlcatel acquired DSC Communications Corporation in 1998 and has integrated its American activities within Alcatel USA.  Alcatel.\n\nCNN news via mobile phone. CNN Interactive and Nokia have developed an extensive news and information service used via mobile phone. The CNN Mobile service will become available in Europe, the Near East, Africa and Asia and its news content varies by region. CNN news comes in the form of phone text messages. By the end of February, nine mobile phone operators had signed an agreement on this form of news transmission. The service was to be offered first in Finland, and later by other operators by the end of June 1999.\n\nCNN Mobile is the first worldwide added value service that is based on the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP). WAP is an open standard that enables the offering of so-called value-added services via digital wireless mobile phone networks. In addition to news services, value-added services include weather reports, stock prices, electronic mail, flight schedules and banking services.  Finnfacts.\n\nBT to build nationwide Internet telephony and multimedia network in Spain. BT has announced it is to create a purpose-built nationwide Internet telephony and multimedia network in Spain.\n\nThe network will use the latest Internet Protocol (IP) technology from Nortel Networks and will form part of a multi-million pound investment by BT in Spain.\n\nThe company has already invested more than GBP 400 million in its various fixed, mobile and Internet interests, and plans to spend at least an additional GBP 600 million over the next ten years.\n\nThe IP network will provide national coverage from 12 main nodes this year, with plans to expand the network by 27 main nodes within three years.  BT.\n\nAscom to renew New Zealand's entire payphone network. Between July and December 1999, Telecom New Zealand will be replacing its existing network of public telephones with 6000 chip card payphones supplied by Ascom, including an off-line management system. This network will be the second, after Hungary, to benefit from a comprehensive security system protecting the operator against fraudulent card use. The contract is valued at FRF 45 million.  Ascom.\n\nTurner Broadcasting signs long-term lease with AsiaSat. Asia Satellite Telecommunications Company Limited has announced the signing of a long-term lease with Turner Broad casting System Inc. (TBS), for a full 36 MHz C-band transponder on AsiaSat-3S. The capacity will be used to broadcast to Asia a number of digital television channels including CNN International, TNT and Cartoon Network. TBS, a subsidiary of Time Warner Inc., is a producer of news and entertainment around the world and a leading provider of programming for the cable industry.  AsiaSat.\n\nNTT to aid telecommunication reconstruction in Honduras. NTT will help Honduras rebuild its telecommunications infrastructure following the devastating hurricane Mitch (November 1998)  the killer storm which left nearly 15 000 people either dead or missing. Some 1.4 million Honduran residents are still suffering.\n\nAid from NTT is focused on the provision of essential telecommunications equipment. Transmission cables donated by the corporation include 10 km of optical fibre cable, 9 km of aerial cable, 265 km of jumper wire, 7 km of lead-in wire and 3 km of inside wire. The total value of NTT's aid is about JPY 9 million.\n\nNTT is providing the aid through the Basic Human Needs Telecom Committee, a non-governmental organization based in Japan that offers humanitarian aid focusing on telecommunications.\n\nCables and other equipment from NTT were to arrive in Honduras in May 1999.  NTT.\n\nAscom to install 7000 payphones in El Salvador and Guatemala. Already present in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina, Ascom has confirmed its presence in Latin America in the public telephone sector through new contracts in these two countries.\n\nAscom will be installing 7000 Proxim card payphones in El Salvador and Guatemala together with their supervision system, both orders having been placed by the national telecommunication operator.\n\nIn Guatemala, 500 payphones had been installed by January 1999 and the remaining units will be supplied at a rate of 1000 per month. In El Salvador, 4000 payphones will be installed during 1999 for CTE Antel, a company in which France Télécom recently took a controlling interest.  Ascom.\n\nAmericans said to pay more for their calls than many Europeans. Recent studies by United Kingdom-based Eurodata Foundation reveal that, overall, most households in the United States are in reality paying more for their telephone service usage than Europeans  substantially so, in many cases.\n\nEurodata's report Competition and tariffs in the USA challenges the perception that all calls in America are markedly cheaper than those made by Europeans. The report explains in detail, with supporting basket analysis, the structure of tariffs for PSTN services, private lines, ISDN, ATM and frame relay services. It is an essential guide for anyone who wishes to understand and analyse the cost of service in this most complex of markets.\n\nTraditionally, United States local loop operators include an element to cover costs of local calls within the \"flat rate\" element of their monthly bill. The effect is that United States residential users do not see the true cost of the local calls they make. In short, Americans perceive their local calls to be free.\n\nThis perception influences their views of the charges they pay for non-local calls, creating an assumption that all calls in the United States are exceptionally good value.  Eurodata Foundation.\n\nBT and Sega to provide subscription-free television Internet access across Europe. BT has announced that it has been chosen by Sega, the global electronics company, to provide a pan-European subscription-free Internet access service for users of Sega Dreamcast.\n\nThe new Dreamcast games console, to be launched in September 1999, will provide users subscription-free Internet access through their televisions on a pay-as-you-go basis via BT's network of European partners. This is the first time that subscription-free Internet access has been made available across Europe in this way.\n\nThe dial IP service will be available from BT in the United Kingdom and its European partners in France, Germany, Italy and Spain. BT and Sega expect to roll-out the service to other European countries later in the year.\n\nThe new Dreamcast console will include a 33.6 k modem and a browser, and will also enable customers to access E-mail, chat and on-line gaming services. Future plans include the offer of on-line shopping facilities. Dreamcast is expected to retail at around GBP 199.  BT.\n\nNew services for Greece. Greece's State network operator OTE is now adding intelligent services to its network to make itself more competitive before the full opening of its national telecommunications market in the year 2001. It is against this background that Siemens has obtained an order worth some DEM 23 million to equip OTE's telephone network with the Siemens platform for intelligent networks, INXpress.\n\nThis means that OTE will be able to launch Siemens services on its network at the same time as developing new services which can also be tested and operated in heterogeneous network architectures with components from various manufacturers of telecommunication devices.\n\nOnce the intelligent network has been fully set up, OTE customers will be able to make use of services such as universal access number, premium rate, televoting, universal personal telecommunications, virtual private network and prepaid card.  Siemens.\n\nGTS announces majority stake in Omnicom. Global TeleSystems Group, Inc. has announced that it has acquired a total of 1 877 608 common shares of Omnicom, representing 98.6 per cent of Omnicom's common share capital. This concludes the offer for those common shares and convertible bonds of Omnicom not previously held by GTS.  GTS. q INTELSAT provides first satellite link to Internet II backbone. The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization has announced that it will be providing capacity to one of the alternate carriers in Israel, Israsat, a subsidiary of Gilat Communications, to connect to the Internet II backbone. The link, which is the first satellite link to the Internet II network, will connect the Inter-Universities Computation Center (IUCC) in Israel with academic institutions in the United States. Service was scheduled to start in June 1999.\n\nThe Internet II is an initiative by a number of universities worldwide, in conjunction with government and industry partners, to accelerate the next stage of Internet development in academia. This private network will operate at speeds several times faster than today's Internet.\n\nThe duplex service will be carried over the Intelsat-801 satellite at 328.5° E and will initially operate at 45 Mbit/s using two 36 MHz transponders. This is expected to be upgraded to a duplex 155 Mbit/s service.  INTELSAT.\n\nNTT Communications Corporation, a new company. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation has established NTT Communications Corporation, following approval of its reorganization plan by the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications.\n\nAn agreement to transfer business from NTT to NTT Communications was also signed by the two companies.\n\nThe new company was to commence operations on 1 July 1999.  NTT.\n\nAlcatel and Compaq announce marketing initiative for ADSL in Europe. Alcatel and Compaq Computer Corporation are embarking on a series of joint marketing ventures to encourage the commercial roll-out of ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) equipment and services among operators and consumers in Europe. Initial target countries are the United Kingdom, Belgium, Italy and Sweden.  Alcatel/Compaq.\n\nColumbia signs Justice Technology to \"Columbia-515\". Columbia Communications Corporation has announced a new lease of 36 MHz West-West capacity on the Columbia-515 satellite to Justice Technology.\n\nThe lease will support voice and data, using the Internet protocol between the United States and several sites in Latin America.  Columbia.\n\nComverse unveils Internet call waiting service. Comverse Network Systems, a division of Comverse Technology, Inc., has unveiled its Internet call waiting service, which will give residential voice messaging and unified messaging (voice, fax and E-mail in a single mailbox) subscribers a virtual telephone line while they are online.\n\nThis new service is activated automatically, as soon as the subscriber connects to the Internet. When a call comes in to the designated phone, a message pops up on the computer screen with the name and number of the caller. The subscriber can then decide whether to accept the call, route the caller to voice mail, redirect the call to another number, play a message for the caller, or simply ignore the call.  Comverse.\n\nEMS Technologies to supply wireless products to Nortel Networks for multimedia satellite link. EMS Technologies Canada, Ltd. has received a contract from Nortel Networks to supply advanced communications hardware and software for the Astra satellite network of Société européenne des satellites (SES), and its advanced return channel system (ARCS). ARCS will be the world's first broadband system for providing direct two-way Internet access via satellite.\n\nThe multi-frequency, time-division multiple-access (MF-TDMA) architecture of the ARCS programme is a major advancement in satellite communications technology. Traditionally, satellites have received uplink signals from a limited number of earth stations. Under this new architecture, small terminals in hundreds of thousands of homes and offices will be able to communicate directly with a central hub via the Ka/Ku band satellite. The satellite access units will efficiently share satellite bandwidth through software developed by EMS, especially for the multimedia traffic environment.  EMS.\n\nICO Global Communications sponsor of TELECOM 99 + Interactive 99. ICO Global Communications will sponsor the opening ceremony of TELECOM 99 + Interactive 99 to be organized by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva from 10 to 17 October.\n\nThis ceremony will be held on 9 October, from 14h00 to 16h30 and will launch the event on the theme \"Join the world\" and start off the programme of speakers.\n\nAbout 200 000 visitors and 3500 official participants are expected from 150 countries.\n\nThe TELECOM exhibition and Forum are held every four years. They are regarded as the world's most important event in the field of telecommunications.\n\nEricsson, NEC and Hughes Network Systems are ICO's partners in sponsoring the opening ceremony.  ICO.\n\nWorldTel awarded BOT concession in Zimbabwe. WorldTel has been awarded a build-operate-transfer concession in Zimbabwe, following a joint venture agreement between the Posts and Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and WorldTel with the express authorization of the Government. WorldTel has established a local private company, WorldTel Zimbabwe Limited (WTZ) to build and operate the fixed line network.\n\nWorldTel is planning to install 150 000 lines in Mashonaland and Victoria provinces including Harare. Both the project and its business plan were developed with the assistance of the International Telecommunication Union that had earlier drawn up the national master development plan. The estimated investment is over USD 115 million. The project, which will expand existing capacity by 75 per cent, aims to meet the present enormous pent-up demand in the country and seeks to reduce the waiting list for additional lines to zero over the next few years.\n\nWTZ positions itself as a friendly complementary service provider to PTC and not as its competitor. The company intends to use existing national and international network system capacity, wherever possible.\n\nIn return for the in-kind contribution that PTC makes and for the operating opportunity given to WTZ, the former will obtain equity interest and share part of the revenue to be collected from subscribers.\n\nWorldTel has undertaken to give priority to Zimbabwean institutional investors to place funds in WTZ in the form of debt and equity. The balance of the required investment will be raised from WorldTel's own shareholders and other international institutional investors and banks.  WorldTel.\n\nAnalysts foresee radical restructuring in telecommunications as bandwidth economics are redefined. International telecommunications analyst group, Ovum, has warned of a radical redefinition of the global telecommunications landscape as the industry moves from a business model where bandwidth is scarce and expensive, to one where bandwidth is potentially plentiful and, therefore, extremely cheap. Ovum predicts that this change will invert existing pricing models, create new market structures with new types of players and transform the operational and organizational make-up of today's operators.\n\nIncreased supplies are driving dramatic reductions in price. But as prices fall, what happens to the commercial viability of the networks? Will increased supply stimulate enough extra demand to fill the networks at commercially sustainable prices?\n\nOvum points out in its report The bandwidth explosion that many new networks are built on the premise of \"if you build it, they will come\"  i.e. increases in supply of capacity will always be filled up by growth in demand. But Ovum believes that the key issue is not simply whether or not demand will continue to grow rapidly  it evidently will. Rather, the success of many new and existing bandwidth providers will be determined by how quickly this will happen and whether or not some operators will be left with a capacity \"glut\", i.e. large amounts of capacity that they cannot sell.  Ovum.\n\nGTE/Bell Atlantic merger. GTE Corporation shareholders have approved the company's merger with Bell Atlantic. The vote was announced at the GTE annual shareholder meeting in Atlanta (Georgia).\n\nAccording to the company, 96.7 per cent of the votes submitted were in favour of the transaction.\n\nThe United States Department of Justice cleared the merger after an exhaustive review, finding no competitive issues in the company's vast combined wireline businesses.  GTE.\n\nLMI to begin communication services. Lockheed Martin Intersputnik (LMI), a joint venture of Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications and the International Organization of Space Communications (INTERSPUTNIK), confirmed it will launch its initial satellite, LMI-1 and initiate communication services by the end of September 1999.\n\nIn a statement issued following a board meeting, the joint venture said its LMI-1 spacecraft is completing production at Lockheed Martin Commercial Space Systems in Sunnyvale (California), and has successfully completed thermal vacuum testing.\n\nThe satellite will be ready for shipment to the Baikonur Cosmodrome launch site before the end of July 1999 and is manifested for launch by International Launch Services aboard a Proton launch vehicle in late August/early September 1999.\n\nLMI-1 will provide communication services to Eastern Europe, South and South-East Asia, parts of Africa and the Middle East, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The spacecraft is the first of four planned advanced- technology satellites that are to provide comprehensive coverage and connectivity to business and residential customers throughout the world.  Lockheed Martin Global Telecommunications/INTERSPUTNIK.\n\nColumbia signs COMSAT Mobile for service to cruise ships. Columbia Communications has signed an agreement with COMSAT Mobile Communications to provide space segment in support of communication services (voice and data) for two cruise ships: QE2 and Century.\n\nThe expansive C-band coverage of Columbia's TDRS-6 satellite, combined with its competitive pricing, makes the Columbia satellite system the ideal choice for C-band maritime services. A single TDRS-6 transponder delivers simultaneous full coverage to the Caribbean and Mediterranean regions, providing the most efficient space segment service for cruise ships and maritime service providers operating in these areas.  Columbia.\n\nA benchmark industry study of OSS investment points to pent-up demand for integrated solutions. TeleManagement Forum, a communications industry consortium of service providers and solution suppliers, has announced availability of a benchmark study of the global market for operational support systems. The study shows a 1998 world market of USD 16.5 billion for these business critical systems, documents current purchasing habits among service providers, and identifies a large, fast growing market that is not yet well understood, but that is going to create new winners and losers across the industry. Entitled The communications industry market for OSS, the study was commissioned by TeleManagement Forum and conducted by Ovum, Ltd.\n\nWhile time-critical pressures to improve efficiency drive service providers to look for turnkey solutions, issues of interoperability are preventing the industry from realizing the goal of fully automated and integrated systems. For a sufficient number of products to emerge, the industry must rally around a few key agreements that will enable common reusable off-the-shelf solutions and software components to be built.  Ascom SA.\n\nStructural changes\n\nin Kenya\n\nKenya Posts and Telecommunications Corporation has ceased to be the signatory of Kenya. The Communications Commission of Kenya is the current designated signatory to the ITU on all telecommunications regulatory matters.\n\nin Monaco\n\nA Directorate for Licensing and Telecommunications Control was established by Decree No. 13.633 of 25 September 1998.
