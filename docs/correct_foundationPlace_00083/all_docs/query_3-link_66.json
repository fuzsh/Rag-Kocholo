Paving the Way to New VAS Opportunities: Comverse IP Messaging and Service Enablement Middleware\n\n2. 2For more information please visit www.comverse.com Paving the Way to New VAS Opportunities Introducing Comverse IP Messaging and Service Enablement Middleware Solutions Comverse Extends VAS Leadership: Investing, Innovating, Opening New Horizons by Oz Ovady, Value-Added Services General Manager, Comverse For decades, innovation has driven Comverse leadership in VAS, and this tradition continues strongly as Comverse ushers in the future with pioneering voice and messaging solutions. ComverseVAS 3.0 IPMessaging and Service Enablement Middleware pave the way to opportunities for communication service providers (CSPs) to expand their markets and introduce compelling new consumer, enterprise and machine- to-machine (M2M) experiences. Comverse IP Messaging: Revving Up Transition to an All-IP Ecosystem Multiple product silos have created a complex infrastructure whose intricate integration requirements impede change. Comverse IP Messaging is an important developmental milestone designed to leverage IP capabilities to free CSPs from the constraints of the traditional architecture. Comverse IP Messaging leverages the common IP core to facilitate inter-communication across product silos, device types, applications and services. This simplifies integration of third-party applications - setting the stage for an enriching, yet simplified the user experience. Modernizing the core messaging infrastructure to the highest standards of current Internet technologies, Comverse IP Messaging positions CSPs to keep pace with industry developments and compete with the services being introduced by non-traditional over-the-top competitors. Optimizing the Messaging Platform for 4G/ LTE Comverse IP Messaging, standards-compliant, optimizes the messaging platform for 4G/ LTE for text and multimedia messaging, voice and video, visual voicemail and other new services. Key elements include: IP Engine:• With a pre-integrated collection of the newest communication experiences in a converged environment, including person-to-person messaging (immediate and deferred) with attached multimedia objects, online one-on-one and group messaging (IM/chat), file transfer, media sharing, integration with visual voicemail, advanced personalization, parental control and more\n\n3. 3For more information please visit www.comverse.com Centralized Service Configuration:• For operator policy and user preferences, safeguarding network security Network-Based Storage:• With converged inbox access for all communication experiences and history archiving Robust Monetization Capabilities:• Including tight integration with Comverse ONE for payment and balance to generate revenues from content and additional network data, such as location, handset capabilities and address book information Comverse IP Messaging utilizes IP as a common infrastructure for messaging, yet at the same time it continues inter- working seamlessly with existing legacy silos and services. This improves the operator position and user experience by introducing a converged and harmonized environment that is a springboard for a myriad of opportunities for compelling services, yet supports legacy services and devices to ensure seamless robust functionality to and from all users. Comverse Service Enablement Middleware: Bridging CSPs and Third Parties The Comverse Service Enablement Middleware (SEM) solution, already deployed by several operators, securely externalizes CSP messaging and related assets (e.g. communication services, subscriber knowledge). The next- generation cloud-based version introduces new capabilities that can further enhance the ability of CSPs to enable"
