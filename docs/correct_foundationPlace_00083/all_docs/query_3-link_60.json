        "text": "(FORTUNE Magazine) â€“ If the Israeli tech sector had a motto, it would be \"Act locally, sell globally.\" On two recent trips to Israel, I sat through umpteen PowerPoint presentations, all of them in English, before it finally dawned on me that there are no presentations in Hebrew and no mention of any Israeli market for the country's high-tech products. It's all about North America and Europe, in that order.\n\nConsidering Israel's size (pop. 5.9 million, about the size of Indiana), it might surprise investors just how many new tech companies are sprouting up there. More than 130 Israeli firms--defined as being headed by an Israeli or with a major presence in Israel, such as an R&D facility--are listed on U.S. exchanges, 97 of them on the Nasdaq. That makes it the most heavily represented country after the U.S. No wonder Tel Aviv-based analyst Stephen Levey of UBS Warburg calls it the \"Holy Valley.\"\n\nWhy the wealth of technology expertise? The military. Israel has a high concentration of well-trained engineers with defense experience, all looking for ways to commercialize the country's 50 years of prodigious military-related R&D spending. Many of the companies specialize in things like telecom equipment and security software, meaning business plans that are long on real-world applications and short on dot-com nonsense.\n\n\"What's strong in Israel are infrastructure players, because Israel is extremely strong in core technologies,\" says Elan Zivotofsky, an Israel-based tech-stock analyst with Goldman Sachs. \"One of the things that really stands out has been how the higher-quality companies tend to all be profitable and have tried-and-true business models.\"\n\nFor example, Zivotofsky likes AudioCodes, based outside Tel Aviv, a leading maker of semiconductors that enable voice communications over the Internet (Nasdaq ticker: AUDC). Like nearly every successful Israeli company, AudioCodes is richly priced. At a market valuation of $1.7 billion, it trades for about 75 times earnings estimates for this year. But analysts expect AudioCodes to increase earnings at a 50% year-over-year clip. What's more, at $87 recently, its stock price has retreated from a midsummer high of $148, in part because of profit-taking after a decent performance last quarter and in part because of concerns about one of its major clients. But Zivotofsky believes the weakness is unwarranted and \"represents an attractive buying opportunity for a profitable leader in a rapidly growing market.\"\n\nThe Goldman analyst also recommends three of the larger Israeli tech companies, specifically Orbotech, a maker of semiconductor test equipment based in Billerica, Mass.; Gilat Satellite Networks, a supplier to digital satellite systems; and Comverse Technology, which makes voice-mail software for telecom companies. (All three trade on the Nasdaq.) Comverse is a good example of an Israeli company with a U.S. veneer. It's in Woodbury, N.Y., where Kobi Alexander, its chairman, president, and CEO is based, but maintains a sizable R&D facility in Israel.\n\nAnd then there's Check Point Software, probably the best-known company in Israel's burgeoning tech sector (and one of FORTUNE's Cool Companies in 1998). Check Point popularized so-called firewall software, which helps companies protect their networks from hacker attacks. Its hyperkinetic co-founder and CEO, Gil Shwed, toiled with a handful of buddies in a prestigious military-intelligence unit, protecting Israel's sensitive security network by trying to hack into it. Based in the Tel Aviv suburb of Ramat Gan, Check Point sports a market cap of $18.5 billion and sales over the past four quarters of $300 million. The stock has recently traded at about $120 a share, up 20-fold from its late 1998 low of about $6 (adjusted for splits).\n\nDoes that make the stock too pricey? Not according to some analysts, who say Check Point is as unstoppable now as Microsoft used to be. \"The company is growing at levels that no one believes,\" says UBS Warburg's Levey, noting that its most recent quarterly earnings of $43.7 million doubled the year-earlier figure. \"Every time people think they get a handle on the numbers, [Check Point] just blows them away.\"\n\nOliver Katz, an emerging European specialist with Deutsche Asset Management in New York, likes brand-new Israeli issues Floware and Giganet, both of which make broadband wireless components and both of which went public this summer. Already the two stocks have increased notably from their offering prices. And Katz adds a caveat about investing in Israel: The safest way to play, he says, is to stick with the biggest players. Smaller Israeli companies typically haven't been vetted the way larger companies have, by institutional investors scrutiniz- ing their financial performance. That's true anywhere, of course, but even more so in a place like tight-knit Israel, where foreign investors are often the last to hear about sensitive information.\n\nAnd if the prospect of betting on companies launched from halfway around the world seems overly risky to you, consider diversifying with a mutual fund. A little-known New York company called TransNations Investments packages 35 Israeli companies into a single index fund, called the Amidex 35 (ticker: AMDEX). It comprises the 35 largest Israeli companies traded in either Tel Aviv or New York. TransNations rebalances it at the beginning of the year and whenever a member stock gets acquired. Although the Amidex 35 attracted just $20 million in assets in its first year, it returned an impressive 78% to investors. Boaz Rahav, the fund's manager, says he'll soon begin marketing the Amidex through Merrill Lynch, Oppenheimer, and a few other brokerages. He says the firm also plans to offer actively managed Israeli stock funds in the near future.\n\nIf nothing else, Israel's fast-growing tech market offers a key lesson for savvy investors: The best homegrown ideas often come from somebody else's backyard.\n\nADAM LASHINSKY is a columnist for TheStreet.com."
