Our goal is to provide easy-to-understand discussion of the Scriptures, without relying on jargon or slogans. Here, you can find book-by-book, chapter-by-chapter, and verse-by-verse commentary on the entire Bible (eventually). At the same time, youâll find links to related passages and biblical themes. These connections will help to show how the Scriptures fit together.\n\nBibleRef.com is guided by three major principles: Biblical Authority, Accessibility, and Discipleship. In short, we believe that the Bible is the most critical resource in the life of a Christian. We believe that each person has the ability, and responsibility, to understand the Scriptures. And, we believe in promoting a whole-person commitment to Christianity, including thoughts, deeds, and actions."
