BUSINESS.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nComverse Technology, Inc., a New York corporation (\"Comverse\" and,\n\ntogether with its subsidiaries, the \"Company\"), designs, develops, manufactures,\n\nmarkets and supports computer and telecommunications systems and software for\n\nmultimedia communications and information processing applications. The Company's\n\nproducts are used in a broad range of applications by fixed and wireless\n\ntelephone network operators, government agencies, call centers, financial\n\ninstitutions and other public and commercial organizations worldwide.\n\nThe Company's line of enhanced services platform products enable\n\ntelecommunications network operators to offer a variety of revenue-generating\n\nservices that are accessible to large numbers of simultaneous users, including a\n\nbroad range of integrated messaging, information distribution and personal\n\nassistant services, such as call answering, voice mail, fax mail, unified\n\nmessaging, pre-paid services, short text messaging and audiotext. The Company's\n\nComverse Network Systems (\"CNS\") Division's principal market consists of\n\norganizations that use the systems to provide services to the public, usually on\n\na subscription or pay-per-usage basis, and includes both fixed and wireless\n\ntelephone network operators and other telecommunications services organizations.\n\nIn January 1998, Boston Technology, Inc., a Delaware corporation\n\n(\"Boston\"), merged with and into Comverse in a transaction in which former\n\nshareholders of Boston received an aggregate of 18,141,185, shares of Comverse's\n\nCommon Stock, par value $0.10 per share (\"Common Stock\"). Boston, like the\n\nCompany's CNS Division, manufactures multimedia enhanced services platforms for\n\nservice provider organizations, including both fixed and wireless telephone\n\nnetwork operators. Boston's enhanced services platforms are similar in features\n\nto those of the Company, but have traditionally been sold to different market\n\nsegments, which include, among others, several of the Regional Bell Operating\n\nCompanies in the United States and NTT in Japan. Prior to its merger with\n\nBoston, Comverse's marketing efforts were focused primarily on international\n\nnetwork operators, as well as wireless personal communications network operators\n\nin the United States. The business and assets of Boston have been combined with\n\nthe CNS Division following the merger of Boston with Comverse (the \"Merger\").\n\nExcept for financial information and as otherwise indicated, discussion of the\n\nbusiness of the Company in this report includes the business of Boston.\n\nThe Company markets its enhanced services platforms throughout the world,\n\nwith its own direct sales force and in cooperation with a number of leading\n\ninternational vendors of telecommunications infrastructure equipment. The\n\nCompany is the market-share leader in providing large capacity enhanced services\n\nplatforms for wireless and wireline telecommunications network operators. More\n\nthan 250 fixed and wireless telephone network operators in more than 65\n\ncountries, including 13 of the 20 largest telephone companies in the world, have\n\nselected the Company's platforms to provide enhanced telecommunications services\n\n- 1 -\n\nto their public customers. CNS customers include, among others, AT&T (USA), Bell\n\nAtlantic (USA), BellSouth (USA), Deutsche Telekom (Germany), Hongkong Telecom\n\n(Hong Kong), NTT (Japan), SBC Communications (USA), SFR (France), Sprint PCS\n\n(USA), Telebras (Brazil), Telecom Italia (Italy), Telmex (Mexico) and Telstra\n\n(Australia).\n\nThe Company's Comverse Information Systems (\"CIS\") Division\n\nmanufactures multiple channel, multimedia digital monitoring systems, which\n\nsupport the monitoring, recording, surveillance, and information gathering and\n\nanalysis activities of law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and digital\n\nrecording systems which support the voice, fax and data recording and analysis\n\nactivities of a variety of governmental and commercial organizations. The\n\nCompany's monitoring systems enable many simultaneous users to monitor, record\n\nand process voice, image (facsimile) and data communications from multiple\n\nchannels in a variety of analog and digital formats, provide facilities for\n\narchiving large volumes of recorded information and allow the use of computer\n\ndatabase processing techniques for analysis, management and retrieval\n\noperations. The systems have been sold to law enforcement, military and\n\nintelligence agencies that monitor and record communication channels for a\n\nvariety of purposes, such as surveillance in support of police actions and the\n\ncollection and processing of information for intelligence analysis. Customers\n\nsuch as inbound and outbound call centers, commercial organizations, emergency\n\nservice (e.g., \"911\") providers, correctional facilities, public health and\n\nsafety organizations and financial institutions, use the Company's call\n\nrecording systems to record and process large volumes of audio, image and data\n\ncommunications. Traditionally, analog tape recorders, alone or coupled with a\n\nvariety of special purpose devices, have been used for these applications. The\n\nworldwide growth in telecommunications traffic in general and digital\n\ncommunications in particular, and the increasing use of a variety of digital\n\ntransmission formats in telecommunications networks, have created a need for\n\nuser organizations to modernize their monitoring, recording and processing\n\ncapabilities. The Company's systems provide a number of advantages over analog,\n\ntape recorder-based equipment, including improvements in capacity, reliability,\n\naccuracy, processing efficiency and archiving and retrieval capabilities. Most\n\nimportantly, the systems enable users to adapt efficiently to the emergence of\n\nnew telecommunications technologies, such as digital transmission, Integrated\n\nServices Digital Network (\"ISDN\") and enhanced signaling systems, for which\n\nanalog, tape recorder-based equipment was not designed. CIS Division products\n\nhave been sold to end-users in more than 30 countries.\n\nThe Company's DGM&S Telecom (\"DGM&S\") Division provides Signaling\n\nSystem Number Seven (\"SS7\") telecommunications software and hardware. DGM&S's\n\nproducts provide Intelligent Network (\"IN\") and Advanced Intelligent Network\n\n(\"AIN\") applications for voice, data and mobility communications services such\n\nas 800 number translation, voice mail, Internet routing, short text messaging,\n\nlocal number portability, cellular roaming and emergency \"911\" services. DGM&S's\n\nproducts are marketed to wireline and wireless equipment providers and network\n\noperators to enable global connectivity, inter-platform portability,\n\nclient/server flexibility and clustering reliability. The products provide the\n\nglobal standards and national variants needed to communicate between the\n\ndisparate signaling protocols worldwide, and enable operators to use either a\n\nUNIX or Windows NT platform. The products, which offer\n\n- 2 -\n\nmediated access to the telecommunications signaling network, operate in a\n\nclient/server configuration.\n\nDGM&S's customers include, among others, Amdahl, Compaq, DSC\n\nCommunications, Ericsson, MCI, Nokia, PTT Telecom (Netherlands), Qualcomm,\n\nSiemens, Sprint and Sun Microsystems.\n\nThrough subsidiaries and affiliates, the Company is also involved in\n\nthe development of technologies and products incorporating video compression and\n\nnetworking, the design and development of systems for telephone answering\n\nservice bureaus, the operation of telemessaging service bureaus and capital\n\nmarket activities for its own account.\n\nThroughout this document, references are made to technologies,\n\nfeatures, capabilities, capacities and specifications in conjunction with the\n\nCompany's products and technological resources. Such references do not\n\nnecessarily apply to all product lines, models, system configurations and\n\nCompany operating Divisions.\n\nThe Company was incorporated in the State of New York in October 1984.\n\nIts principal executive offices are located at 170 Crossways Park Drive,\n\nWoodbury, New York 11797, where its telephone number is (516) 677-7200.\n\nTHE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS\n\nComverse Network Systems Division: Enhanced Services Platform Product Family\n\nThe market for network-based enhanced services platforms has grown\n\nrapidly over the past several years. The Company believes that a number of\n\nfactors have contributed to this growth, including the heightened emphasis among\n\nwireless and wireline telecommunications network operators on offering new\n\nservices for revenue-generation and competitive differentiation, the increasing\n\npublic awareness and acceptance of multimedia messaging services resulting from\n\nthe growing installed base of messaging systems in the business community, the\n\nexpanding availability from the major telephone companies of call answering\n\nservices, and the growing use of wireless telephone services, which almost\n\nuniversally offer a mailbox-based call answering service.\n\nThe CNS Division's primary focus has been on supplying large-capacity\n\nenhanced services platforms, which are marketed under the names Access NP and\n\nTRILOGUE INfinity, to fixed and wireless telecommunications network operators.\n\nThese organizations benefit from the ability to offer their customers a variety\n\nof revenue-generating services provided by the Company's systems, such as\n\nautomated call answering, voice and fax messaging, unified messaging, pre-paid\n\nservices, short text messaging, audiotext, voice activated dialing, call\n\nscreening, one-touch call return, automated personal assistant services and\n\n\"virtual telephone\" service, usually on a subscription or pay-per-call basis.\n\nWith call answering and voice and fax\n\n- 3 -\n\nmessaging, telephone operating companies benefit not only from service\n\nsubscription fees, but also from traffic revenue generated by the increase in\n\nbillable completed calls. In addition, these services improve overall network\n\nefficiency by reducing congestion from repeated unbillable busy/no-answer calls.\n\nWireless telephone service operators are almost universally adding voice\n\nmailboxes to their service offerings, and often as part of their basic service\n\npackage, not only because of these benefits, but also because wireless messaging\n\nservices directly increase billable airtime by stimulating outbound calls.\n\nThe Company's enhanced services platforms have been designed and\n\npackaged to meet the capacity, reliability, scalability, maintainability and\n\nphysical requirements of large telephone network operators. The systems are\n\noffered in a variety of sizes and configurations, extending to a capacity of up\n\nto 6,000 ports, 45,000 voice storage hours and 1,000,000 mailboxes. The systems\n\nalso offer redundancy of critical components, so that no single failure will\n\ninterrupt the service. The Company's platforms are available in both centralized\n\nand widely distributed configurations, and maintain their integrity as a single\n\nsystem in distributed configurations.\n\nThe Company's systems also incorporate components that are compatible\n\nwith the IN and AIN protocols for Intelligent Peripherals (\"IP\"), permitting the\n\nCompany's network operator customers to develop and deploy services based on the\n\noverall IN/AIN architecture. In addition, when the system is configured as a\n\nService Node (\"SN\"), it enables customers to offer next-generation IN/AIN-based\n\nservices such as personal number, call screening/caller introduction, one-touch\n\ncall return and pre-paid. The incorporation of IN and AIN-related software also\n\nallows a customer, which has not yet implemented intelligent network\n\ninfrastructure, to purchase an enhanced services platform from the Company with\n\nthe confidence that it contains a built-in migration path to IN/AIN standards,\n\nshould the network operator decide to implement IN/AIN infrastructure in the\n\nfuture.\n\nThe Company's platforms incorporate proprietary and third-party\n\nsoftware, and industry standard and proprietary hardware, in an open system\n\narchitecture. Most hardware is based on Industry Standard Architecture (\"ISA\"),\n\nwhich facilitates the integration of commercially available ISA technologies\n\nwith the Company's core technologies. The systems support a wide variety of\n\nanalog and digital telephony interfaces and signaling systems, enabling them to\n\nadapt to a variety of different telephony environments and IN/AIN applications,\n\nand provide a \"universal port\" -- a single port that supports any combination of\n\nvoice and fax services at any time during a single call. The Company has also\n\nintroduced Internet messaging capabilities, enabling end-users to access their\n\nvoice, fax and e-mail text messages from anywhere in the world via the World\n\nWide Web.\n\nComverse Information Systems Division: Monitoring and Recording Systems\n\nComverse's Information Systems Division develops, manufactures and\n\nmarkets monitoring and recording systems primarily for law enforcement,\n\nintelligence agencies, call centers and financial institutions.\n\n- 4 -\n\nThe Company's AUDIODISK systems are multiple channel, multimedia\n\ndigital monitoring systems, sold primarily to law enforcement and intelligence\n\nagencies, which enable multiple users simultaneously to monitor, record and\n\nprocess audio, image (facsimile) and data communications over multiple channels\n\nin a variety of analog and digital formats, and provide facilities for archiving\n\nlarge volumes of recorded information. The systems automatically decode and\n\nrecord a variety of signals without operator intervention and store the recorded\n\ninformation on magnetic and optical disks to permit quick and easy random access\n\nand the use of computer database techniques for analysis, archival and retrieval\n\noperations. AUDIODISK also enables multiple users to access the same recorded\n\ninformation simultaneously for processing and analysis.\n\nThe Company's ULTRA line of multiple channel, multimedia digital\n\nrecording systems are marketed primarily to call centers, financial\n\ninstitutions, emergency \"911\" service providers, correctional institutions, and\n\nother organizations that record large volumes of communications, and require\n\nfast and easy retrieval of recorded information.\n\nTraditionally, analog tape recorders, alone or coupled with a variety\n\nof other special purpose devices, have been utilized for communications\n\nmonitoring, recording and related applications. The limited capacity and\n\nprocessing capability inherent in these systems have imposed constraints on\n\norganizations that process large amounts of multimedia information from multiple\n\nchannels and that need to store the processed information for long periods while\n\nkeeping it available for rapid retrieval. The Company's systems interface with a\n\nvariety of analog and digital communications protocols and automatically\n\nrecognize and adapt to voice, fax or modem content on each recorded channel.\n\nMost importantly, they also enable users to adapt efficiently to the emergence\n\nof new telecommunications technologies, such as digital transmission and\n\nenhanced signaling systems, for which analog, tape recorder-based equipment was\n\nnot designed. The systems provide a number of advantages over analog, tape\n\nrecorder-based systems, including improvements in capacity, reliability,\n\naccuracy, processing efficiency and archiving and retrieval capabilities.\n\nThe AUDIODISK product design is based on open system architecture and\n\nclient/server concepts, and supports a broad range of multimedia monitoring\n\ncapabilities, such as the recording, processing and retrieval of analog audio\n\nsignals, such as telephone and radio channels; analog facsimile and modem\n\ncommunications; digital audio and data signals, including ISDN, T1, E1 and X.25;\n\nand telephony signaling, including Pulse Dialing, DTMF, Calling Line\n\nIdentification and Call Progress Tones (such as busy, no-answer and ringback).\n\nAUDIODISK systems simultaneously process incoming signals over multiple\n\nchannels, apply digital signal processing technologies and use magnetic and\n\noptical disks for temporary and long-term digital storage. Digital signal\n\nprocessing technologies that are employed by AUDIODISK to enhance monitoring\n\napplications include, among others, signal compression, automatic signal\n\nidentification, automatic signal interpretation and noise cancellation. Magnetic\n\nand optical disks permit virtually instantaneous retrieval and sharing of stored\n\ninformation among many users. The systems also enable users to transmit\n\nmultimedia information among multiple sites over\n\n- 5 -\n\ncommunication links. AUDIODISK is designed to support various communications\n\nlinks, including T1, E1, ISDN, Dial-up telephone lines (over secure modems),\n\nsatellite links, TCP/IP over Ethernet (with routers) and X.25. AUDIODISK systems\n\nalso provide a facility for archiving large volumes of recorded information on\n\nrewritable optical disks. This archive function allows a single recording\n\nsession, groups of sessions, a single recording channel, selected channels or\n\nall channels to be stored on the same disk. The archive disk records all the\n\nsignals on a particular channel and automatically associates the signal-related\n\ninformation (\"SRI\") as well as the date and time with the recorded information.\n\nFor larger AUDIODISK systems, automatic disk library systems, referred to as\n\n\"jukeboxes\", provide very large amounts of on-line storage. The product employs\n\na database management system to provide a central facility for access to all\n\nstored information. This feature allows any operator to use computer database\n\nquery techniques to retrieve the audio and SRI data quickly and efficiently.\n\nThe Company offers AUDIODISK systems in a range of configurations,\n\nwhich share substantially the same hardware, software and user interface. The\n\nAUDIODISK systems' multimedia server can be configured in a variety of models to\n\nsupport a range of applications, including large, fixed-site audio monitoring\n\nplatforms with up to 350 channels. Moreover, several AUDIODISK multimedia\n\nservers may be networked for increased capacity or to satisfy redundancy\n\nrequirements. Storage configurations include magnetic disks, optical drives and\n\noptical jukebox devices. Up to 50 four-gigabyte magnetic disks can be configured\n\nin a disk array to provide a recording buffer. Removable optical cartridges are\n\nused for archiving, with each cartridge capable of storing up to 180 compressed\n\naudio hours. Multiple jukebox configurations provide automated management of\n\noptical media, storing up to 30,000 hours of audio or 4,500,000 pages of fax for\n\nrapid automated retrieval.\n\nULTRA systems provide Computer-Telephony Integration (\"CTI\") enabled\n\nrecording, including integration with major PBX/ACDs, Predictive Dialers and\n\nmiddleware products. The CTI connection allows the customer to easily search\n\ncalls through database queries. In addition, selective recording is possible\n\nthrough time-driven schedules or event triggers. ULTRA systems support high\n\nvolume of simultaneous playbacks over the telephone or through LANs, WANs, and\n\nthe Internet. Immediate access to recordings is possible through advanced\n\noptical disk technology and jukeboxes. The ULTRA Series comprises six products,\n\ntailored to customer-specific requirements for capacity, storage and special\n\nfeatures.\n\nDGM&S Telecom Division: Telecommunications Signaling Products\n\nThe DGM&S Telecom Division provides SS7 telecommunications software and\n\nhardware, marketed under the name SignalWare. DGM&S's SignalWare products\n\nprovide IN/AIN applications for voice, data and mobility communications services\n\nsuch as 800 number translation, voice mail, Internet routing, short text\n\nmessaging, local number portability, cellular roaming and emergency \"911\"\n\nservices.

SignalWare products, which offers mediated access to the\n\ntelecommunications signaling network, operates in a client/server configuration.\n\nDGM&S's customers include, among others, Amdahl, Compaq, DSC\n\nCommunications, Ericsson, MCI, Nokia, PTT Telecom (Netherlands), Qualcomm,\n\nSiemens, Sprint and Sun Microsystems.\n\nMARKETS, SALES AND MARKETING\n\nThe Company's CNS Division markets enhanced services platforms\n\nthroughout the world, with its own direct sales force and in cooperation with a\n\nnumber of leading international vendors of telecommunications infrastructure\n\nequipment. The Company is a market share leader in providing large capacity\n\nmessaging systems for telephone network operators around the world.\n\nMore than 250 fixed and wireless telephone network operators in more\n\nthan 65 countries, including 13 of the 20 largest telephone companies in the\n\nworld, have selected the Company's platforms for messaging and other enhanced\n\nservices. The Company's network operator customers include, among others, AT&T\n\n(USA), Bell Atlantic (USA), BellSouth (USA), Deutsche Telekom (Germany),\n\nHongkong Telecom (Hong Kong), NTT (Japan), SBC Commmunications (USA), SFR\n\n(France), Sprint PCS (USA), Telebras (Brazil), Telecom Italia (Italy), Telmex\n\n(Mexico) and Telstra (Australia).\n\nThe Company provides its customers with programs of marketing\n\nconsultation, seminars and materials designed to assist them in marketing\n\nenhanced telecommunications services, and also undertakes to play an ongoing\n\nsupporting role in their business and market planning processes.\n\nThe Company's CIS Division markets AUDIODISK and ULTRA systems\n\nworldwide through its direct sales force and, where appropriate, through agents,\n\ndistributors and system integrators. The Company sells AUDIODISK directly to the\n\nlaw enforcement, military and intelligence markets. Primary target markets for\n\nthe ULTRA Series include call centers, public safety and emergency services\n\norganizations and financial institutions.\n\nTECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe Company's research and development efforts focus particularly on\n\nthe design of very large, high throughput systems and digital signal processing\n\ntechnologies for voice, image and data communications. The Company's products\n\nuse advanced technologies in the areas of digital signal processing, facsimile\n\nprotocols, telephony interfaces, mass storage, digital networking,\n\nmulti-processor computer architecture and real-time software design. The Company\n\n- 7 -\n\nalso possesses considerable technology and expertise in the development of\n\nsoftware products, solutions and applications within the IN and AIN environment.\n\nThe Company's products are based upon flexible system architectures\n\nspecifically designed to handle multiple channel, multimedia communication and\n\nprocessing applications. Multimedia processing computers require a much higher\n\nthroughput than conventional data processing systems, especially when a large\n\nnumber of channels have to be processed simultaneously. The Company's products\n\nemploy open system, modular architectures, which use distributed processors,\n\nrather than one large central processor, as well as multiple storage devices and\n\ndigital networking. The product design is intended to be readily adaptable to\n\nthe usage and capacity requirements of the individual end-user. The product\n\narchitectures also allow the Company to add enhancements and new technologies to\n\nits systems without rendering existing products obsolete.\n\nA primary focus of the Company's research and development efforts has\n\nbeen digital signal processing technologies required for voice, image and data\n\ncommunications. Computer systems designed for signal processing applications,\n\nsuch as processing of voice and image communications, handle information\n\ndifferently from conventional data processing systems and require greater\n\nprocessing and storage resources. For example, a digitized voice message, even\n\nwhen subjected to data compression techniques, may require as much as 150 times\n\nthe storage capacity as the same message processed in textual form. The computer\n\nmust be designed to function at a fast and efficient rate to produce a form of\n\nspeech acceptable to the human ear. The Company has developed a number of speech\n\ncompression algorithms, which provide the Company's products with optimal\n\ncompression taking into account the level of speech quality required for each\n\napplication. The Company also has developed a special signal detector, which\n\nidentifies signals as voice, fax or modem. Voice processing algorithms currently\n\navailable with the Company's products include speech enhancement (noise\n\nreduction) and variable playback speed with pitch compensation. Fax and modem\n\nprocessing algorithms offered by the Company enable communication and\n\ninterception of a large number of standard and non-standard communications\n\nprotocols.\n\nThe Company has developed interfaces for its products to most telephony\n\nenvironments used around the world, including digital interfaces, such as T1, E1\n\nand ISDN, and SS7 interfaces designed to encompass both basic network\n\nconnectivity and the IN/AIN capabilities of Intelligent Peripherals and Service\n\nNodes. The Company has implemented facsimile communication and intercept\n\nprotocols for Group 3 facsimile. Certain of the Company's products incorporate\n\nlocal area network and wide area network technologies used for the transfer of\n\ndigitized voice, fax and modem information, as well as for the transfer of data\n\namong various network elements.\n\nThe Company utilizes state-of-the-art mass storage technologies in many of\n\nits products. Proprietary algorithms developed by the Company are utilized for\n\nstorage of multimedia information to facilitate real-time processing of large\n\namounts of information and optimal use of media. A variable number of disks may\n\nbe configured in a disk array to serve large numbers of users and to provide\n\nfull or partial disk redundancy for critical applications. Special algorithms\n\nutilized by the Company to handle optical disks within a number of jukebox\n\ndevices include automatic channel-to-disk allocation, automatic retrieval of\n\nmultimedia information from any disk located in the jukeboxes and redundant\n\narchiving on two or more cartridges simultaneously.\n\n- 8 -\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nBecause of the continuing technological changes that characterize the\n\ntelecommunications and computer industries, the Company's success will depend,\n\nto a considerable extent, upon its ability to continue to develop competitive\n\nproducts through its research and development efforts.\n\nThe Company is engaged in ongoing research and development efforts\n\nintended to expand and enhance the technical capabilities, features and range of\n\nuses of its products, and to design and develop new generations of its product\n\nofferings. The Company currently employs more than 1,200 scientists, engineers\n\nand technicians with broad experience in the areas of digital signal processing,\n\ncomputer architecture, facsimile protocols, telephony, digital networking,\n\nmulti-processing, mass storage, and real-time software design.\n\nA substantial portion of the Company's research and development\n\noperations benefit from financial incentives provided by government\n\ninstrumentalities to promote research and development activities, including its\n\nresearch and development activities situated in Israel. The cost of such efforts\n\nis affected by the continued availability of funding under such programs. The\n\npercentage of the Company's total research and development expenditures\n\nreimbursed under these programs has declined in recent years, and will continue\n\nto decline with the growth in the Company's overall operations and the\n\nincreasing amount of research and development conducted by the Company at\n\nlocations other than those in which reimbursement programs are available to it.\n\nThe Company pays royalties on its sales of certain products developed in part\n\nwith funding supplied under such programs. Permission from the government of\n\nIsrael is required for the Company to manufacture outside of Israel products\n\nresulting from research and development activities funded under such programs,\n\nor to transfer outside of Israel related technology rights, and in order to\n\nobtain such permission the Company may be required to increase the royalties to\n\nthe applicable funding agencies and/or repay certain amounts received as\n\nreimbursement of research and development costs. The Company expects to incur\n\nadditional royalty expenses and/or repayment obligations as a result of the\n\nMerger and the location of certain manufacturing and research and development\n\noperations pertaining to its TRILOGUE product line at its Boston facilities. See\n\n\"Business--Licenses and Royalties,\" \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of\n\nFinancial Condition and Results of Operations\" and Note 3 to the financial\n\nstatements.\n\nPATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\n\nThe Company currently holds a total of 17 United States patents and a\n\nnumber of foreign patents. While the Company files patent applications\n\nperiodically, no assurance can be given that patents will be issued on the basis\n\nof such applications or that, if patents are issued, the claims allowed will be\n\nsufficiently broad to protect the Company's technology. In addition, no\n\nassurance can be given that any patents issued to the Company will not be\n\nchallenged, invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted under the\n\npatents will provide significant benefits to the Company.\n\n9\n\nIn order to safeguard its unpatented proprietary know-how, trade\n\nsecrets and technology, the Company relies primarily upon trade secret\n\nprotection and non-disclosure provisions in agreements with employees and others\n\nhaving access to confidential information. There can be no assurance that these\n\nmeasures will adequately protect the Company from disclosure or misappropriation\n\nof its proprietary information.\n\nThe Company and its customers from time to time receive communications\n\nfrom third parties, including some of the Company's competitors, alleging\n\ninfringement by the Company of such parties' patent rights. While such\n\ncommunications are common in the computer and telecommunications industries and\n\nthe Company has in the past been able to obtain any necessary licenses on\n\ncommercially reasonable terms, there can be no assurance that the Company would\n\nprevail in any litigation to enjoin the Company from selling certain of its\n\nproducts on the basis of such alleged infringement, or that the Company would be\n\nable to license any valid patents on reasonable terms.\n\nLICENSES AND ROYALTIES\n\nThe Company licenses certain technology, know-how and related rights\n\nfor use in the manufacture and marketing of its products, and pays royalties to\n\nthird parties under such licenses and under other agreements entered into in\n\nconnection with research and development financing. The Company believes that\n\nits rights under such licenses and other agreements are sufficient for the\n\nmanufacturing and marketing of its products and, in the case of licenses, extend\n\nfor periods at least equal to the estimated useful lives of the related\n\ntechnology and know-how. The Company currently pays royalties on substantially\n\nall sales of enhanced services platforms and on certain sales of AUDIODISK,\n\nULTRA and derivative products. The royalties vary in amount based upon the\n\nrevenues attributable to the various components of such products. During 1995,\n\n1996 and 1997, aggregate license and royalty payments by the Company amounted to\n\napproximately $2,419,000, $4,365,000 and $6,865,000, respectively.\n\nINTERNATIONAL SALES\n\nSales of the Company's products outside of North America have increased\n\nfrom approximately $92,046,000 in 1995 to approximately $136,236,000 in 1996 and\n\n$205,988,000 in 1997. International sales and marketing efforts may be adversely\n\naffected by a number of factors, including the need for system customization and\n\nspecial integrations, government approvals and export licenses, instability in\n\ninternational trading relations, currency fluctuations and additional costs of\n\nmarketing, service and support due to lack of proximity with the end-users. In\n\ncertain cases, the Company's contracts are denominated in local currencies, and\n\nas such, the Company may be adversely affected by fluctuations in those\n\ncurrencies. International sales of certain systems manufactured by the Company\n\nalso are subject to a variety of legal restrictions governing the export of such\n\nproducts.\n\n10\n\nWhile the Company believes that prevailing economic conditions in the\n\nFar East and Southeast Asia have reduced the demand for its systems in certain\n\ncountries, overall sales in the region have increased over the past 12 months.\n\nThe Company cannot currently predict the effect on its business should regional\n\neconomic conditions fail to improve.\n\nFor additional information regarding foreign operations, see Notes 16\n\nand 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Management's\n\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -\n\nCertain Trends and Uncertainties\" appearing elsewhere in this report.\n\nBACKLOG\n\nAt December 31, 1997, the backlog of the Company amounted to\n\napproximately $87,644,000, compared with approximately $70,339,000 at December\n\n31, 1996, an increase of approximately $17,305,000. Substantially all of the\n\ncurrent backlog is expected to be delivered within the next 12 months.\n\nSERVICE AND SUPPORT\n\nThe Company has a strong commitment to provide product service and\n\nsupport to its customers and emphasizes such commitment in its marketing.\n\nBecause of the intensity of use of systems by telephone network operators and\n\nother customers of the Company's products, and their low tolerance for\n\ndown-time, the Company is required to make a greater commitment to service and\n\nsupport of systems used by these customers, and such commitment increases\n\noperating costs.\n\nThe Company's general warranty policy is to replace or repair any\n\ncomponent that fails during a specified warranty period. Broader warranty and\n\nservice coverage is provided in certain instances, and is usually made available\n\nto customers on a contractual basis for an additional charge.\n\nThe Company provides centralized technical assistance from several\n\nlocations around the world. Technical support is available for the Company's\n\ncustomers 24 hours-a-day, seven days-a-week.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe enhanced services platform industry is highly competitive, and\n\nincludes numerous products offering a broad range of features and capacities.\n\nThe primary direct competitors of the CNS Division are manufacturers of\n\nstand-alone voice mail systems, including, among others, Brite Voice Systems,\n\nInc., Centigram Communications Corporation, Glenayre Electronics, Inc., Octel\n\nCommunications Corporation (acquired in 1997 by Lucent Technologies, Inc.),\n\nTecnomen Oy, Unisys Corporation, and manufacturers of central office\n\ntelecommunications equipment, including Northern Telecom Limited and\n\nTelefonaktiebolaget LM Ericsson. Competitors of the Company that manufacture\n\nother telecommunications equipment may derive a competitive advantage in selling\n\nvoice processing and message management systems to customers that are purchasing\n\nor have previously purchased other compatible equipment from such manufacturers.\n\n11\n\nIndirect competition is provided by voice and fax messaging products\n\nemployed at end-user sites as an alternative to the use of services available\n\nthrough telephone network operators. This \"customer premises equipment\" includes\n\na broad range of products, such as stand-alone voice mail systems, products\n\noffering \"call processing\" services that are supplied with voice mail features\n\nor integrated with other voice mail systems, as well as personal computer modems\n\nand add-on cards and software designed to furnish voice processing and message\n\nmanagement features.\n\nThe Company believes that competition in the sale of enhanced services\n\nplatforms is based on a number of factors, the most important of which are\n\nproduct features and functionality, system performance and reliability,\n\nmarketing and distribution capability and price. Other important competitive\n\nfactors include service and support and the capability to integrate systems with\n\na variety of central office and cellular switches and other communications\n\nsystems. The Company believes that the range of features provided by, and the\n\nease of use of, its enhanced services platforms are competitive with other\n\nplatforms currently being marketed, and that its products are among the leading\n\nsystems designed specifically for telephone network operators.\n\nNeither the Company nor any of the Company's competitors is a dominant\n\nvendor of enhanced services platforms in any market segment or product line. The\n\nCompany anticipates that a number of its direct and indirect competitors will be\n\nintroducing new or improved enhanced services platforms during the next several\n\nyears.\n\nThe Company is aware of a relatively small number of manufacturers of\n\nproducts that compete with the AUDIODISK product line at the present time.\n\nManufacturers of products that have been offered in competition with the\n\nAUDIODISK system include Applied Signal Technology, Inc., the E-Systems division\n\nof Raytheon Corporation, GTE Government Systems Division, Harris Corporation,\n\nJSI Corporation and Nice Systems, Ltd. Competition also has been provided by\n\nmanufacturers and integrators of custom designed computer and telecommunications\n\nsystems in response to particular government procurements in specific markets\n\nwhere they have entrenched customer relationships. The Company believes that it\n\nderives a competitive advantage over many potential competitors of its AUDIODISK\n\nproduct line by reason of its ability to offer prospective customers a family of\n\nproducts that can provide a solution to most customer requirements without\n\nextensive special development effort. The government market in general is highly\n\ncompetitive and difficult to penetrate, and the Company may be at a competitive\n\ndisadvantage in respect of certain customers and market segments as a result of\n\nits small size in relation to other potential vendors and the existence of\n\nentrenched customer relationships with other vendors. The market in which ULTRA\n\nproducts are sold is also highly competitive. Primary competitors include Atis\n\nAssmann GmbH, Dictaphone Corporation, Kreutler GmbH, Nice Systems, Ltd., Racal\n\nRecorders Ltd., Seltronics Corp., TEAC America, Inc., Teknekron Infoswitch\n\nCorporation and Witness Systems, Inc.\n\n12\n\nMany of the Company's present and potential competitors are\n\nconsiderably larger than the Company, are more established, have a larger\n\ninstalled base of customers and have greater financial, technical, marketing and\n\nother resources.\n\nMANUFACTURING AND SOURCES OF SUPPLIES\n\nThe Company's manufacturing operations consist primarily of final\n\nassembly and testing, involving the application of extensive testing and quality\n\ncontrol procedures to materials, components, subassemblies and systems. The\n\nCompany uses third parties to perform printed circuit board assembly and sheet\n\nmetal fabrication. Although the Company generally uses standard parts and\n\ncomponents in its products, certain components are presently available only from\n\na limited number of sources. To date, the Company has been able to obtain\n\nadequate supplies of all components in a timely manner from existing sources or,\n\nwhen necessary, from alternative sources. However, the inability to obtain\n\nsufficient quantities of components or to locate alternative sources of supply\n\nif and as required in the future, would adversely affect the Company's\n\noperations.\n\nThe Company maintains organization-wide quality assurance\n\nprocedures, coordinating the quality control activities of the Company's\n\nresearch and development, manufacturing and service departments. The Company's\n\nprimary manufacturing and research and development facilities have received\n\ncertification to Quality Standard ISO 9001.\n\nCAPITAL MARKET ACTIVITIES\n\nThe Company has organized a wholly-owned subsidiary, CTI Capital\n\nCorp. (\"CTI Capital\"), in support of its exploration of strategic acquisition\n\nand investment opportunities. CTI Capital, directly and through a wholly-owned\n\nsubsidiary in Israel, Comverse Investments Ltd., seeks to identify and implement\n\nsuitable strategic investments for the Company, and engages in portfolio\n\ninvestment and capital market activities, primarily in Israel. Such activities\n\ninclude, in addition to direct investment in public and private companies,\n\ninvestment and merchant banking activities and short-term trading of debt and\n\nequity securities. Through ComSor Investment Fund N.V., formed by CTI Capital in\n\npartnership with a subsidiary of Soros Fund Management LLC., the Company seeks\n\nto invest venture capital in high technology firms, primarily those located in\n\nIsrael, and engages in other investment activities. The ComSor fund has a $25\n\nmillion dollar capital commitment each from CTI Capital and a subsidiary of\n\nSoros Fund Management. Comverse also engages in direct strategic and capital\n\nmanagement investment activities for its own account.\n\n13\n\nOPERATIONS IN ISRAEL\n\nA substantial portion of the Company's research and development and\n\nmanufacturing operations are conducted at its wholly-owned subsidiary, Efrat\n\nFuture Technology Ltd. (\"Efrat\"), which is located in Israel and, accordingly,\n\nmay be affected by economic, political and military conditions in that country.\n\nThe Company's business is also dependent to some extent on trading relationships\n\nbetween Israel and other countries. Certain of the Company's products\n\nincorporate components imported into Israel from the United States and other\n\ncountries and most of the Company's products are sold outside of Israel.\n\nAccordingly, the Company's operations would be adversely affected if major\n\nhostilities involving Israel should occur or if trade between Israel and its\n\ncurrent trading partners were interrupted or curtailed. The Company benefits\n\nfrom various policies of the Government of Israel, including reduced taxation\n\nand special subsidy programs, designed to stimulate economic activity,\n\nparticularly high technology industry, in that country. As a condition of its\n\nreceipt of funds for various research and development projects conducted under\n\nprograms sponsored by the Government of Israel, the Company has agreed that\n\nproducts resulting from these projects may not be manufactured, nor may the\n\ntechnology developed in the projects be transferred, outside of Israel without\n\ngovernment consent.\n\nSince the establishment of Israel in 1948, a state of hostility has\n\nexisted, varying in degree and intensity, between Israel and the Arab countries,\n\nand Israel and countries doing business with Israel have been the subject of an\n\neconomic boycott by the Arab countries. Following the Six-Day War in 1967,\n\nIsrael commenced administering the territories of the West Bank and the Gaza\n\nStrip and, since December 1987, increased civil unrest has existed in these\n\nterritories and resulted in acts of violence in other parts of Israel. Although\n\nIsrael has entered into various agreements with Arab countries and the Palestine\n\nLiberation Organization (\"PLO\"), and various declarations have been signed in\n\nconnection with efforts to resolve some of the regional problems, no prediction\n\ncan be made as to whether a full resolution of these problems can be achieved or\n\nas to the nature of any such resolution. To date, these problems have not had a\n\nmaterial adverse impact on the financial condition or operations of the Company,\n\nalthough there can be no assurance that continuation of these problems will not\n\nhave such an impact in the future.\n\nIsrael is a member of the United Nations, the International Monetary\n\nFund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the\n\nInternational Finance Corporation, and is a signatory to the General Agreement\n\non Tariffs and Trade, which provides for reciprocal lowering of trade barriers\n\namong its members. In addition, Israel has been granted preferences under the\n\nGeneralized System of Preferences from the United States, Australia, Canada, and\n\nJapan. These preferences allow Israel to export the products covered by such\n\nprograms either duty-free or at reduced tariffs.\n\nIsrael and the European Union are parties to a Free Trade Agreement\n\npursuant to which, subject to rules of origin, Israel's industrial exports to\n\nthe European Union are exempt from customs duties and other non-tariff barriers\n\nand import restrictions. Israel also has an agreement with the United States to\n\nestablish a Free Trade Area (\"FTA\") which is intended ultimately to eliminate\n\nall tariff and certain non-tariff barriers on most trade between the two\n\ncountries. Under the FTA agreement, most products received immediate duty-free\n\nstatus in 1985, and all tariffs have since been eliminated. In 1993, Israel\n\n14\n\nentered into an agreement with the European Free Trade Association (\"EFTA\"),\n\nwhich includes Austria, Norway, Finland, Switzerland, Iceland and Liechtenstein,\n\nthat established a free-trade zone between Israel and EFTA nations exempting\n\nmanufactured goods and some agricultural goods and processed foods from customs\n\nduties, while reducing duties on other goods. Israel is the only country which\n\nhas free-trade area agreements with the United States as well as with the\n\nEuropean Union and EFTA states. The end of the Cold War has also enabled Israel\n\nto establish commercial and trade relations with a number of nations, including\n\nRussia, China and the nations of Eastern Europe, with whom Israel had not\n\npreviously had such relations.\n\nIsrael's economy has from time to time been subject to various\n\ndestabilizing factors, including a period of rampant inflation in the early to\n\nmid-1980s, low foreign exchange reserves, fluctuations in world commodity\n\nprices, military conflicts and civil unrest. For these and other reasons, the\n\nIsraeli Government has intervened in all sectors of the economy, employing,\n\namong other means, fiscal and monetary policies, import duties, foreign currency\n\nrestrictions and controls of wages, prices and exchange rates. The Israeli\n\nGovernment has frequently changed its policies in all these areas. For the\n\ncalendar years 1993 through 1997, the annual rates of inflation were\n\napproximately 11%, 14%, 8%, 11% and 7%, respectively. This inflation, and the\n\nassociated increases in salaries that are linked by Israeli law to increases in\n\nthe consumer price index, have increased the cost of the Company's operations in\n\nIsrael, and salary costs have further increased as a result of the growing\n\ncompetition for qualified scientific, engineering and technical personnel in\n\nIsrael. The increase in costs in recent periods has not been offset by\n\nproportional devaluation of the Israeli shekel against the U.S. dollar, and\n\naccordingly has had a negative impact on the Company's overall results of\n\noperations.\n\nThe results of operations of the Company have been favorably affected\n\nby Efrat's participation in Israeli Government programs related to research and\n\ndevelopment, as well as its utilization of certain tax incentives and other\n\nincentives available under applicable Israeli laws and regulations, some of\n\nwhich have been reduced, discontinued or otherwise modified in recent years. In\n\naddition, the Company's ability to obtain benefits under various discretionary\n\nfunding programs has declined and may continue to decline as its internal\n\nfinancial and operational resources increase relative to other applicants. The\n\nresults of operations of the Company could be adversely affected if these\n\nprograms were further reduced or eliminated and not replaced with equivalent\n\nprograms or if Efrat's ability to participate in these programs were to be\n\nreduced significantly.\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAt December 31, 1997, the Company employed 2,827 individuals,\n\napproximately 76% of whom are scientists, engineers and technicians engaged in\n\nresearch and development, marketing and support activities.\n\n15\n\nThe Company is not a party to any collective bargaining or other\n\nagreement with any labor organization; however, certain provisions of the\n\ncollective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of\n\nLabor in Israel) and the Coordinating Bureau of Economic Organizations\n\n(including the Industrialists' Association) are applicable to the Company's\n\nIsraeli employees by order of the Israeli Ministry of Labor. Israeli law\n\ngenerally requires the payment by employers of severance pay upon the death of\n\nan employee, his retirement or upon termination of his employment, and the\n\nCompany provides for such payment obligations through monthly contributions to\n\nan insurance fund. Israeli employees and employers are required to pay\n\npre-determined sums to the National Insurance Institute, which payment covers\n\nmedical and other benefits similar to the benefits provided by the United States\n\nSocial Security Administration.\n\nThe continuing success of the Company will depend, to a considerable\n\nextent, on the contributions of its senior management and key employees, many of\n\nwhom would be difficult to replace, and on the Company's ability to attract and\n\nretain qualified employees in all areas of its business. Competition for such\n\npersonnel is intense, particularly in the computer and telecommunications\n\nindustries. In order to attract and retain talented personnel, and to provide\n\nincentives for their performance, the Company has emphasized the award of stock\n\noptions as an important element of its compensation program, including, in the\n\ncase of certain key management level personnel, options to purchase shares in\n\ncertain of the Company's subsidiaries, and cash bonuses based on several\n\nparameters, including the profitability of their respective business units.\n\nITEM 2. PROPERTIES.\n\nAs of December 31, 1997, the Company, excluding Boston, leased an\n\naggregate of approximately 548,000 square feet of space for its operations\n\nworldwide, including approximately 414,000 square feet in Tel Aviv, Israel,\n\napproximately 46,000 square feet in Woodbury, New York, approximately 31,000\n\nsquare feet in Mt. Laurel, New Jersey, approximately 22,000 square feet in\n\nIrvine, California, and an aggregate of approximately 35,000 square feet at\n\nvarious other locations in the United States, Israel, Western Europe, the Far\n\nEast and Australia. The aggregate base monthly rent for the facilities under\n\nlease at December 31, 1997 was approximately $604,000, and all of such leases\n\nare subject to various pass-throughs and escalation adjustments.\n\nIn March 1998, the Company entered into a lease for approximately\n\n93,500 square feet in Tel Aviv, Israel to increase the capacity of its Israeli\n\noperations. The monthly base rent for the new premises starts at approximately\n\n$103,000.\n\nThe Company believes that its facilities currently under lease are\n\nadequate for its current operations, and that additional facilities are\n\navailable on competitive market terms to provide for such future expansion of\n\nthe Company's operations as may be warranted.\n\n16\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.\n\nOn November 16, 1995, a purported class action was filed in the United\n\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania against Boston\n\nand certain of its officers. Two similar complaints were filed on November 20,\n\n1995 and November 21, 1995. The plaintiffs alleged violations of the Securities\n\nExchange Act of 1934. On February 15, 1996, the Court consolidated the three\n\ncases into one captioned In re Boston Technology, Inc., Securities Litigation.\n\nOn November 13, 1996, Boston was allowed to transfer the consolidated action to\n\nthe United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. On February\n\n5, 1998, the Court issued an order granting the defendants' motion to dismiss\n\nthe Amended Complaint. No final judgment has been entered in the case. The\n\nCompany has received no information regarding any plans the plaintiffs may have\n\nto ask the Court to reconsider its order, attempt to re-plead their claims, or\n\nappeal from any judgment that might be entered. However, if any of these actions\n\nare taken by the plaintiffs, the Company and the other defendants intend to\n\ncontest these actions vigorously.\n\nOn or about March 11, 1997, a complaint was filed in the Fourteenth\n\nJudicial District Court of Dallas County, Case No. 9702187, by Syntellect\n\nTechnology Corporation (\"Syntellect\"). The complaint alleges, among other\n\nthings, breach of contract by Boston in failing or refusing to pay certain\n\nroyalties allegedly due under the Patent License Agreement between Boston and\n\nSyntellect's predecessor, Dytel Corporation (the \"License Agreement\").\n\nSyntellect claims that the License Agreement required Boston to pay royalties on\n\nsales of its software and hardware products. On February 10, 1998, the Court\n\ngranted the Company partial summary judgment, holding that the License Agreement\n\nrequires payment of royalties on software products only, and not on hardware\n\nsales. Discovery on the remaining claims continues, and a trial is scheduled for\n\nthe summer of 1998. The Company is currently engaged in negotiations with\n\nSyntellect for the settlement of the litigation and the license by the Company\n\nof a number of patents for which Syntellect holds licensing rights. Should such\n\nnegotiations not result in the settlement of the action, the Company intends to\n\ncontest Syntellect's claims vigorously.\n\nOn February 2, 1998, Computel Computadores e Telecommunicacoes S.A.\n\n(\"Computel\") filed a Request for Arbitration with the International Chamber of\n\nCommerce (\"ICC\") in Paris, France, claiming breaches by Boston and its\n\nwholly-owned subsidiary, Boston Technology Investments, Inc., in respect of\n\nagreements with Computel and its affiliates for the distribution of Boston's\n\nsystems in Brazil. Computel claims, among other things, that the defendants have\n\nbreached their obligations to Computel by engaging in the Merger and thereby\n\ncompeting with the joint venture established by the parties in connection with\n\nsuch distribution activities, by delivering equipment that did not conform to\n\nspecification, by failing to support this equipment and by \"fraudulently\n\ninducing\" Computel to terminate the agreement that established the joint venture\n\nwithout advising it of the possibility of the Merger. In its prayer for relief,\n\nComputel alleges damages in excess of US $50 million as a result of lost\n\nbusiness opportunities, injury to its business reputation, investment losses and\n\nlosses due to currency devaluation. On March 10, 1998, the Company commenced an\n\naction against Computel and an affiliate in the Middlesex Superior Court of\n\nMassachusetts (Civil Action No. 98-1155) seeking declaratory judgments as to\n\n17\n\narbitrability and the continuing validity of the Purchase and Sale Agreement\n\nbetween the parties, Computel's specific performance of such agreement and\n\ninjunctions to prevent Computel from proceeding with the ICC arbitration. The\n\nCompany also seeks damages in excess of $3,767,500 as a result of Computel's\n\nfailure to pay monies owed under the Purchase and Sale Agreement, as well as\n\ncosts and attorneys' fees. The Company has also filed a Demand for Arbitration\n\nwith the American Arbitration Association in Boston, Massachusetts, against\n\nComputel and certain of its affiliates claiming breach of a Distribution\n\nAgreement between the parties and unfair and deceptive trade practices. The\n\nCompany seeks to recover damages in excess of $12,000,000, plus interest, for\n\nsystems shipped to respondents, and additional damages for respondents'\n\nrepudiation and anticipatory breach of contract and unfair and deceptive trade\n\npractices. The Company intends to vigorously contest Computel's claims and\n\nassert its claims against Computel and its affiliates.\n\nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF\n\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.\n\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve a\n\nnumber of risks and uncertainties, including without limitation information\n\nregarding competition and future trends in the industries in which the Company\n\ncompetes, the Company's future revenues and expenses, and the Company's plans,\n\nstrategies and expectations for its business. There are a number of factors that\n\ncould cause the Company's actual results and business plans to differ materially\n\nfrom those forecasted or projected in such forward-looking statements. These\n\nfactors include, without limitation, those set forth below under the caption\n\n\"Certain Trends and Uncertainties\". Readers are cautioned not to place undue\n\nreliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date\n\nhereof. The Company undertakes no obligations to publicly release any revisions\n\nto these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the\n\ndate hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of the Company's results of\n\noperations covers the operating results of Comverse and its consolidated\n\nsubsidiaries for the fiscal years included in the foregoing selected financial\n\ndata. The operating results of Boston are not included. In connection with the\n\nMerger, the fiscal year of the Company has been changed from the calendar year\n\nto the fiscal year ending January 31, corresponding to Boston's fiscal year. The\n\nCompany is recognizing substantial charges relating to the Merger and the\n\nresulting combination of the two companies, effective upon the consummation of\n\nthe Merger in January 1998. Sales in the January, 1998 one-month transition\n\nperiod (including Boston) were approximately $14,401,000, with a net loss of\n\napproximately $115,207,000.\n\nComparison of 1996 and 1997 Operations\n\nTotal Revenues. Total revenues increased from 1996 to 1997 by\n\napproximately $89,179,000 (43%). The increase is attributable primarily to a\n\nhigher volume of sales of systems and parts. Sales increased from 1996 to 1997\n\nby approximately $83,100,000 (42%), primarily resulting from increased sales in\n\nthe TRILOGUE product line. Interest and other income increased from 1996 to 1997\n\nby approximately $6,079,000 (60%), resulting primarily from increased interest\n\nand dividend income, the investment of funds generated through the issuance of\n\nconvertible subordinated debentures in October 1996, and realized gains on sales\n\nof investments.\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by approximately $34,538,000\n\n(41%) from 1996 to 1997 primarily as a result of the increase in sales. Gross\n\nmargins increased from approximately 57.2% in 1996 to approximately 57.6% in\n\n1997.\n\n21\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and\n\nadministrative expenses increased from 1996 to 1997 by approximately $20,717,000\n\n(39%) and as a percentage of total revenues decreased from approximately 26% in\n\n1996 to approximately 25% in 1997. The increased amount was a result of\n\nincreased sales, marketing and administrative activities associated with the\n\noverall growth of the Company's operations, and particularly with the expansion\n\nof direct sales and marketing activities.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Net research and development\n\nexpenses during 1997 increased by approximately $11,218,000 (41%) over 1996 due\n\nto overall growth of research and development operations, the initiation of\n\nsignificant new research and development projects and increases in salaries and\n\nother costs associated with research and development operations in Israel.\n\nRoyalties and License Fees. Royalties and license fees increased from\n\n1996 to 1997 by approximately $2,500,000 (57%) due primarily to growth in sales\n\nof royalty-bearing products. Royalties and license fees as a percentage of total\n\nsales increased from approximately 2.2% in 1996 to approximately 2.4% in 1997,\n\nreflecting an increase in the royalty rate payable to a funding agency that\n\nbecame effective in 1996.\n\nIncome Tax Provision. Provision for income taxes increased from 1996 to\n\n1997 by approximately $1,457,000 (43%), while the Company's overall effective\n\ntax rate decreased from approximately 10.7% during 1996 to approximately 10.0%\n\nin 1997. The Company's overall rate of tax is reduced significantly by the tax\n\nbenefits associated with qualified activities of one of its Israeli\n\nsubsidiaries, which is entitled to favorable income tax rates under a program of\n\nthe Israeli Government for \"Approved Enterprise\" investments in that country.\n\nNet Income. Net income after taxes increased from approximately\n\n$27,988,000 in 1996 to approximately $43,500,000 in 1997, an increase of\n\napproximately $15,512,000 (55%), while net income after taxes as a percentage of\n\ntotal revenues increased from approximately 13.5% in 1996 to approximately 14.7%\n\nin 1997. The increases resulted primarily from the factors described above.\n\nComparison of 1995 and 1996 Operations\n\nTotal Revenues. Total revenues increased from 1995 to 1996 by\n\napproximately $61,415,000 (42%). The increase is attributable primarily to a\n\nhigher volume of sales of systems and parts. Sales increased from 1995 to 1996\n\nby approximately $60,032,000 (44%), primarily resulting from increased sales in\n\nthe TRILOGUE product line. Interest and other income increased from 1995 to 1996\n\nby approximately $1,383,000 (16%), resulting primarily from increased interest\n\nand dividend income, the investment of funds generated through the issuance of\n\nconvertible subordinated debentures in October 1996, and realized gains on sales\n\nof short-term investments.\n\n22\n\nCost of Sales. Cost of sales increased by approximately $25,022,000\n\n(42%) from 1995 to 1996 primarily as a result of the increase in sales. Gross\n\nmargins increased from approximately 56.8% in 1995 to approximately 57.2% in\n\n1996.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and\n\nadministrative expenses increased from 1995 to 1996 by approximately $11,959,000\n\n(29%) and as a percentage of total revenues decreased from approximately 28% in\n\n1995 to approximately 26% in 1996. The increased amount was a result of\n\nincreased sales, marketing and administrative activities associated with the\n\noverall growth of the Company's operations, and particularly with the expansion\n\nof direct sales and marketing activities.\n\nResearch and Development Expenses. Net research and development\n\nexpenses during 1996 increased by approximately $8,015,000 (41%) over 1995 due\n\nto overall growth of research and development operations, the initiation of\n\nsignificant new research and development projects and increases in salaries and\n\nother costs associated with research and development operations in Israel.\n\nRoyalties and License Fees. Royalties and license fees increased from\n\n1995 to 1996 by approximately $1,946,000 (80%) due primarily to growth in sales\n\nof royalty-bearing products. Royalties and license fees as a percentage of total\n\nsales increased from approximately 1.8% in 1995 to approximately 2.2% in 1996,\n\nreflecting an increase in the royalty rate payable to a funding agency that\n\nbecame effective in 1996.\n\nIncome Tax Provision. Provision for income taxes increased from 1995 to\n\n1996 by approximately $1,301,000 (63%), while the Company's overall effective\n\ntax rate decreased from approximately 10.8% during 1995 to approximately 10.7%\n\nin 1996. The Company's overall rate of tax is reduced significantly by the tax\n\nbenefits associated with qualified activities of one of its Israeli\n\nsubsidiaries, which is entitled to favorable income tax rates under a program of\n\nthe Israeli Government for \"Approved Enterprise\" investments in that country.\n\nNet Income. Net income after taxes increased from approximately\n\n$17,050,000 in 1995 to approximately $27,988,000 in 1996, an increase of\n\napproximately $10,938,000 (64%), while net income after taxes as a percentage of\n\ntotal revenues increased from approximately 11.7% in 1995 to approximately 13.5%\n\nin 1996. The increases resulted primarily from the factors described above.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nAt December 31, 1997, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of\n\napproximately $173,531,000, bank time deposits of approximately $40,700,000,\n\nshort-term investments of approximately $60,787,000 and working capital of\n\napproximately $330,303,000. The Company believes that its existing working\n\ncapital, together with funds generated from operations, will be sufficient to\n\nprovide for its planned operations at least through December 31, 1998.\n\n23\n\nThe Company regularly examines opportunities for strategic\n\nacquisitions of other companies or lines of business, and anticipates that it\n\nmay from time to time issue additional debt and/or equity securities either as\n\ndirect consideration for such acquisitions or to raise additional funds to be\n\nused (in whole or in part) in payment for acquired securities or assets. The\n\nissuance of such securities can be expected to have a dilutive impact on the\n\nCompany's shareholders, and there can be no assurance as to whether or when any\n\nacquired business would contribute positive operating results commensurate with\n\nthe associated acquisition cost.\n\nThe Company's liquidity and capital resources have not been, and\n\nare not anticipated to be, materially affected by restrictions pertaining to the\n\nability of its subsidiaries in Israel to pay dividends or by withholding taxes\n\nassociated with any such dividend payments. Cash dividends paid by an Israeli\n\ncorporation to United States residents are subject to withholding of Israeli\n\nincome tax at source at rates of up to 25%, depending on the particular\n\nfacilities that have generated the earnings that are the source of the\n\ndividends.\n\nYEAR 2000\n\nThe Company has taken actions to understand the nature and extent of\n\nthe work required to make its systems, products and infrastructure Year 2000\n\ncompliant and has begun work to prepare its products and its financial,\n\ninformation and other computer-based systems for the Year 2000, including\n\nreplacing and/or updating existing legacy systems. The Company continues to\n\nevaluate the estimated costs associated with these efforts. While these efforts\n\nwill involve additional costs, the Company believes, based on available\n\ninformation, that it will be able to manage its total Year 2000 transition\n\nwithout any material adverse effect on its business operations, products or\n\nfinancial prospects.\n\nCERTAIN TRENDS AND UNCERTAINTIES\n\nThe Company has benefited from the growth in its business and capital\n\nbase over the past three years to make significant new investment in its\n\noperations and infrastructure intended to enhance its opportunities for future\n\ngrowth and profitability. The Company's results of operations reflect the\n\nsignificant increase in its investment in operations over the past three years.\n\nThe Company intends to continue during 1998 to make significant investments in\n\nthe growth of its business, and to examine opportunities for additional growth\n\nthrough acquisitions and strategic investments. The impact of these decisions on\n\nfuture profitability cannot be predicted with assurance, and the Company's\n\ncommitment to growth may increase its vulnerability to unforeseen downturns in\n\nits markets, technology changes and shifts in competitive conditions. However,\n\nthe Company believes that significant opportunities exist in the markets for\n\neach of its main product lines, and that continued strong investment in its\n\ntechnical, product development, marketing and sales capabilities will enhance\n\nits opportunities for long term growth and profitability.\n\n24\n\nThe Merger involves the integration of two companies that have\n\npreviously operated independently. The combination of two sizable\n\ntechnology-based companies involves significant complexities, and no assurance\n\ncan be given that the combined Company will be able to integrate the operations\n\nof Boston into the Company without encountering difficulties or experiencing the\n\nloss of key Comverse or Boston personnel or that the benefits expected from such\n\nintegration will be realized. The integration of two companies across\n\ngeographically dispersed operations can create the risk of disruption in\n\noperations of the combined company, and neither company's management has\n\nsubstantial experience in managing such integration or the operations of an\n\nentity the size of the combined Company. The Company does not expect to realize\n\ncost savings in the near future as a result of the Merger, and no assurance can\n\nbe given that any savings can be achieved in future periods. Furthermore, there\n\ncan be no certainty that the Merger will not adversely affect the relationships\n\nwith key customers or key vendors of either company. As a result of its\n\nsignificantly greater concentration on a small number of large telephone company\n\ncustomers, Boston's business has historically been considerably more volatile\n\nthan that of Comverse, and the operations of the combined Company are likely to\n\nbe less predictable and subject to greater risks from actions of individual\n\ncustomers than the operations of Comverse in recent years.\n\nThe telecommunications industry is subject to rapid technological\n\nchange. The Company's revenue stream will depend on its ability to enhance its\n\nexisting products and to introduce new products on a timely and cost-effective\n\nbasis. This includes any customer-requested custom software enhancements\n\nrequired in the normal course of product delivery and customer demands for the\n\ntechnological convergence of the Company's products. The Company's products\n\ninvolve sophisticated hardware and software technology that performs critical\n\nfunctions to highly demanding standards. There can be no assurance the Company's\n\ncurrent or future products will not develop operational problems, which could\n\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company. In addition, if the Company were\n\nto delay the introduction of new products, or to delay the delivery of specific\n\ncustom software enhancements, the Company's operating results could be adversely\n\naffected. The Company sells a majority of its products to companies in the\n\ntelecommunications industry. This industry is undergoing significant change as a\n\nresult of deregulation and privatization worldwide, reducing restrictions on\n\ncompetition in the industry. Unforeseen changes in the regulatory environment\n\nmay have an impact on the Company's revenues and/or costs in any given part of\n\nthe world. The worldwide enhanced services systems industry is already highly\n\ncompetitive and the Company expects competition to intensify. The Company\n\nbelieves that existing competitors will continue to present substantial\n\ncompetition, and that other companies, many with considerably greater financial,\n\nmarketing and sales resources than the Company, may enter the enhanced services\n\nsystems markets. The 1997 acquisition of Octel Communications Corporation, a\n\nsignificant competitor of the Company, by Lucent Technologies, Inc. may\n\nintensify the competitive environment in the industry, and there can be no\n\nassurance that similar business combinations or industry consolidation will not\n\noccur in the future.\n\n25\n\nThe enhanced services platforms industry has experienced a continuing\n\nevolution of product offerings and alternatives for delivery of services. These\n\ntrends have affected and may be expected to have a significant continuing\n\ninfluence on conditions in the industry, although the impact on the industry\n\ngenerally and on the Company's position in the industry cannot be predicted with\n\nassurance. Significant changes in the industry make planning decisions more\n\ndifficult and increase the risk inherent in the planning process.\n\nThe market for telecommunications monitoring systems is also in a\n\nperiod of significant transition. Budgetary constraints, uncertainties resulting\n\nfrom the introduction of new technologies in the telecommunications environment\n\nand shifts in the pattern of government expenditures resulting from geopolitical\n\nevents have increased uncertainties in the market, resulting in certain\n\ninstances in the attenuation of government procurement programs beyond their\n\noriginally expected performance periods and an increased incidence of delay,\n\ncancellation or reduction of planned projects. The continuing delay and\n\nuncertainties surrounding the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act\n\n(\"CALEA\") have had a significant impact on acquisition plans of law enforcement\n\nagencies in North America engaged in monitoring activities, and no assurances\n\ncan be given as to the timing or ultimate content of the proposed legislation.\n\nCompetitive conditions in this sector have also been affected by the increasing\n\nuse by certain potential government customers of their own internal development\n\nresources rather than outside vendors to provide certain technical solutions. In\n\naddition, a number of established government contractors, particularly\n\ndevelopers and integrators of technology products, have taken steps to redirect\n\ntheir marketing strategies and product plans in reaction to cut-backs in their\n\ntraditional areas of focus, resulting in an increase in the number of\n\ncompetitors and the range of products offered in response to particular requests\n\nfor proposals. The lack of predictability in the timing and scope of government\n\nprocurements have similarly made planning decisions more difficult and have\n\nincreased the associated risks.\n\nThe Company has historically derived a significant portion of its sales\n\nand operating profit from a relatively small number of contracts for large\n\nsystem installations with major customers. Boston's operating results, in\n\nparticular, have often been characterized by volatility and lack of\n\npredictability, reflecting its traditional customer concentration among major\n\ntelecommunications services providers such as the Regional Bell Operating\n\nCompanies. The Company continues to emphasize large capacity systems in its\n\nproduct development and marketing strategies. Contracts for large installations\n\ntypically involve a lengthy and complex bidding and selection process, and the\n\nability of the Company to obtain particular contracts is inherently difficult to\n\npredict. The Company believes that opportunities for large installations will\n\ncontinue to grow in both its commercial and government markets, and intends to\n\ncontinue to expand its research and development, manufacturing, sales and\n\nmarketing and product support capabilities in anticipation of such growth.\n\nHowever, the timing and scope of these opportunities and the pricing and margins\n\nassociated with any eventual contract award are difficult to forecast, and may\n\nvary substantially from transaction to transaction. The Company's future\n\noperating results may accordingly exhibit a higher degree of volatility than the\n\noperating results of other companies in its industries that have adopted\n\ndifferent strategies, and than the Company has experienced in prior periods.\n\nAlthough the Company is actively pursuing a number of significant procurement\n\nopportunities in the United States and internationally, both the timing of any\n\neventual procurements and the probability of the Company's receipt of\n\nsignificant contract awards are uncertain. The degree of dependence by the\n\nCompany on large orders, and the investment required to enable the Company to\n\nperform such orders, without assurance of continuing order flow from the same\n\ncustomers and predictability of gross margins on any future orders, increase the\n\nrisk associated with its business.\n\n26\n\nThe Company has significantly increased its expenditures in all areas\n\nof its operations during recent periods, including the areas of research and\n\ndevelopment and marketing and sales, and the Company plans to further increase\n\nthese expenditures in the foreseeable future. The increase in research and\n\ndevelopment expenditures reflects the Company's concentration on enhancing the\n\nrange of features and capabilities of its existing product lines and developing\n\nnew generations of its products. The Company believes that these efforts are\n\nessential for the continuing competitiveness of its product offerings and for\n\npositioning itself to participate in future growth opportunities in both the\n\ncommercial and government sectors. The increase in sales and marketing\n\nexpenditures primarily results from the Company's decision to expand its\n\nactivities and direct presence in a growing number of world markets. The\n\nCompany's costs of operations have also been affected by increases in the cost\n\nof its operations in Israel, resulting both from general inflation and increases\n\nin the cost of attracting and retaining qualified scientific, engineering and\n\ntechnical personnel in Israel, where the demand for such personnel is growing\n\nrapidly with the expansion of technology-based industries in that country. The\n\nincrease in these costs in recent periods has not been offset by proportional\n\ndevaluation of the Israeli shekel against the United States dollar, and\n\naccordingly has had a negative impact on the Company's overall results of\n\noperations. Continuation of such trends may have a material adverse effect on\n\nthe Company's future results of operations.\n\nA significant portion of the Company's research and development and\n\nmanufacturing operations are located in Israel and may be affected by\n\nregulatory, political, military and economic conditions in that country. The\n\nCompany's historical operating results reflect substantial benefits from\n\nprograms sponsored by the Israeli government for the support of research and\n\ndevelopment, as well as favorable tax rates available to \"Approved Enterprises\"\n\nin Israel. The Israeli government has indicated its intention to reexamine\n\ncertain of its policies in these areas. Recently, the government acted to\n\nincrease, from between 2% and 3% of associated product sales to 3% of associated\n\nproduct revenues (including service and other related revenues), the annual rate\n\nof royalties to be applied to repayment of benefits under the conditional grant\n\nprogram administered by the Office of the Chief Scientist of the Ministry of\n\nIndustry and Trade, a program in which the Company has regularly participated\n\nand under which it continues to receive significant benefits through\n\nreimbursement of qualified research and development expenditures. The Company's\n\nrepayment of amounts received under the program will be accelerated through\n\nthese higher royalty rates until repayment is completed. In addition, permission\n\nfrom the government of Israel is required for the Company to manufacture outside\n\nof Israel products resulting from research and development activities funded\n\nunder such programs, or to transfer outside of Israel related technology rights,\n\nand in order to obtain such permission the Company may be required to increase\n\nthe royalties to the applicable funding agencies\n\n27\n\nand/or repay certain amounts received as reimbursement of research and\n\ndevelopment costs. The Company expects to incur additional royalty expenses\n\nand/or repayment obligations as a result of the Merger and the location of\n\ncertain manufacturing and research and development operations pertaining to its\n\nTRILOGUE product line at its Boston facilities. The Israeli authorities have\n\nalso indicated that this funding program will be further reduced in the future,\n\nparticularly for larger entities such as the Company. The Israeli government has\n\nalso shortened the period of the tax moratorium applicable to \"Approved\n\nEnterprises\" from four years to two years. Although this change has not affected\n\nthe tax status of most of the Company's current projects, it will apply to any\n\nfuture \"Approved Enterprises\" of the Company. If further changes in the law or\n\ngovernment policies regarding those programs were to result in their termination\n\nor adverse modification, or if the Company were to become unable to participate\n\nin or take advantage of those programs, the cost to the Company of its\n\noperations in Israel would materially increase and there would be an adverse\n\neffect on the results of the Company's operations as a whole. To the extent the\n\nCompany increases its activities outside Israel, which will result from the\n\nMerger and possible future acquisitions, such increased activities will not be\n\neligible for programs sponsored by Israel. The Company's research and\n\ndevelopment and manufacturing operations attributable to Boston are expected to\n\ncontinue to be located in the United States and thus will not be eligible for\n\nthe benefits of those programs. Accordingly, the effective cost to the Company\n\nof its future research and development activities in particular, and its\n\noperations in general, could significantly increase relative to that of\n\nComverse, historically.\n\nThe Company currently derives a significant portion of its total sales\n\nfrom customers outside of the United States. International transactions involve\n\nparticular risks, including political decisions affecting tariffs and trade\n\nconditions, rapid and unforeseen changes in economic conditions in individual\n\ncountries, turbulence in foreign currency and credit markets, and increased\n\ncosts resulting from lack of proximity to the customer. Volatility in\n\ninternational currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on the\n\nCompany's operating results. The Company has, and anticipates that it will\n\ncontinue to receive, significant contracts denominated in foreign (primarily\n\nWestern European and Japanese) currencies. As a result of the unpredictable\n\ntiming of purchase orders and payments under such contracts and other factors,\n\nit is often not practicable for the Company to effectively hedge the risk of\n\nsignificant changes in currency rates during the contract period. Since the\n\nCompany will hedge the exchange rate risks associated with long-term contracts\n\ndenominated in foreign currencies only to a limited extent, operating results\n\ncan be affected by the impact of currency fluctuations as well as the cost of\n\nsuch hedging.\n\nWhile the Company believes that prevailing economic conditions in\n\nthe Far East and Southeast Asia have reduced the demand for its systems in\n\ncertain countries, overall sales in the region have increased over the past 12\n\nmonths. The Company cannot currently predict the effect on its business should\n\nregional economic conditions fail to improve.\n\nThe trading price of the Company's shares may be affected by the\n\nfactors noted above as well as prevailing economic and financial trends and\n\nconditions in the public securities markets. Share prices of companies in\n\ntechnology and government contracting businesses, and particularly smaller and\n\nmedium-sized publicly traded companies such as the Company, tend to\n\n28\n\nexhibit a high degree of volatility. The Company's revenues and earnings may be\n\nmore volatile than that of Comverse historically as a result of the greater\n\nconcentration of Boston's business on a limited number of large customers.\n\nShortfalls in revenues or earnings from the levels anticipated by the public\n\nmarkets could have an immediate and significant effect on the trading price of\n\nthe Company's shares in any given period. Such shortfalls may result from events\n\nthat are beyond the Company's immediate control, can be unpredictable and, since\n\na significant proportion of the Company's sales during each fiscal quarter tend\n\nto occur in the latter stages of the quarter, may not be discernible until the\n\nend of a financial reporting period. These factors contribute to the volatility\n\nof the trading value of its shares regardless of the Company's long-term\n\nprospects. The trading price of the Company's shares may also be affected by\n\ndevelopments, including reported financial results and fluctuations in trading\n\nprices of the shares of other publicly-held companies in the voice processing\n\nindustry, which may not have any direct relationship with the Company's business\n\nor prospects.\n\nITEM 8.
