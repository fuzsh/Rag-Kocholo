This represents the first time someone has built a machine-learning-based DRAM simulator, in which the simualtor need not maintain a cycle-accurate state and instead returns a highly accurate \"hint\" about latency. This means that CPU simulators can be rewritten as VERY simple (no longer need to keep polling until the memory controller returns the result), and it makes massively parallel systems MUCH faster to simulate.

It's about time to give up and put them out as tech reports, because it's good research. The work was not done in 2014, that is simply when I decided to make them public. Each tech report has the date appropriate to the timeframe of the work and when the work was written up.\n\nAnd, by the way, yes -- we are the group who did the performance modeling of Hybrid Memory Cube for Micron, while the part was in development (Paul and Elliott were grad students at the time, and Dave Resnick, the man behind HMC's design, was at Micron). The first paper in the list is about that -- and, yes, they are accurate results, because our simulator reflects how the part is actually built. We tried submitting that paper to several computer architecture conferences, but the paper was rejected for two reasons: first, the work was considered \"not novel\" (we couldn't publish anything until Micron announced HMC details in 2012, and evidently, the moment Micron announced it, it became \"not novel\"), and, secondly, the program committees really, really, REALLY wanted power numbers. Which we couldn't produce, and still can't, because of NDA reasons.

Resistive RAM Based Main-Memory Systems: Understanding the Opportunities, Limitations, and Tradeoffs (Northrop Grumman)\n\nAs DRAM faces scaling issues as a high-density memory, emerging technologies are being explored as alternatives. Resistive Memories (ReRAM) are scalable, vertically stackable, and can deliver higher density than DRAM as a main-memory solution. This research work explores ReRAM as a main-memory alternative at three levels of detail: at the device level, at the physical-design level, and finally at the architecture level. Cells are fabricated and characterized; reduced write energies can extend cell lifetimes, and system-level simulations show that, for high core counts, this offers a better main-memory alternative than any other existing memory technology.\n\nShang Li\n\nPh.D. 2019. Scalable and Accurate Memory System Simulation (Cadence Design Systems)\n\nWe develop a fast and validated cycle accurate main memory simulator that can accurately model almost all existing DRAM protocols and some NVM protocols, and it can be easily extended to support upcoming protocols as well. To efficiently simulate the increasingly paralleled memory systems, we propose a lax synchronization model that allows efficient parallel DRAM simulation. Lastly, we discuss the limitation of cycle accurate models, and explore the possibility of alternative modeling of DRAM. We propose a novel approach that converts DRAM timing simulation into a classification problem. By doing so we can make predictions on DRAM latency for each memory request upon first sight, which makes it compatible for scalable architecture simulation frameworks.\n\nPaul Tschirhart\n\nPh.D. 2015. Multi-Level Main Memory Systems: Technology Choices, Design Considerations, and Trade-off Analysis. (Northrop Grumman)\n\nMulti-level main memory systems provide a way to leverage the advantages of different memory technologies to build a main memory that overcomes the limitations of the current flat DRAM-based architecture, using any of the new non-volatile technologies that have appeared in the past decade. However, these novel technologies require multi-level main memory hierarchies to achieve acceptable performance. This dissertation investigates the implications of these new multi-level main memory architectures and provides key insights into the trade-offs associated with the technology and organization choices that are integral to their design.\n\nPaul Rosenfeld\n\nPh.D. 2014. Performance Exploration of the Hybrid Memory Cube. (Micron)\n\nThe Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) is an emerging main memory technology that leverages advances in 3D fabrication techniques to create a memory device with several DRAM dies stacked on top of a CMOS logic layer. The logic layer at the base of each stack contains several DRAM memory controllers that communicate with the host processor over high speed serial links using an abstracted packet interface. While the architecture of this type of device is still nascent, we present several parameter sweeps to highlight the performance characteristics and design trade-offs.\n\nIshwar Bhati\n\nPh.D. 2014. Scalable and Energy-Efficient DRAM Refresh Techniques. (Oracle/Sun)\n\nA DRAM cell requires periodic refresh operations to preserve data in its leaky capacitor. Previously, the overheads of refresh operations were insignificant, but, as both the size and speed of DRAM chips have increased significantly in the past decade, refresh has become a dominating factor of both DRAM performance and power dissipation. This dissertation presents a comprehensive study of the issues related to refresh operations in modern DRAM devices, and it then proposes techniques to mitigate refresh penalties.\n\nMu-Tien Chang\n\nPh.D. 2013. Technology Choices for Large Last-Level Caches. (Samsung)\n\nSeveral memory technologies, including SRAM, STT-RAM (MRAM), and embedded DRAM (eDRAM), have been used to implement Large last-level caches (L3Cs). This thesis compares their characteristics and performance: SRAM is relatively low density and dissipates high leakage; STT-RAM has long write latency and requires high write energy; eDRAM requires refresh. As future processors are expected to have larger last-level caches, the objective of this dissertation is to study the tradeoffs associated with using each.\n\nElliott Cooper-Balis\n\nPh.D. 2012. Buffer-On-Board Memory Systems.

Performance Analysis of NAND Flash Memory Solid-State Disks (SSDs) (SanDisk)\n\nNAND Flash Solid State Disks (SSDs) are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to Hard Disk Drives (HDDs). It is important to understand the internals of solid state disk drives. This work provides an in-depth study of the relationship between SSD architectures, their management algorithms, and system-level performance, as well as proposing new optimization heuristics.\n\nSadagopan Srinivasan\n\nPh.D. 2007. Prefetching vs. the Memory System: Optimizations for Multi-core Server Platforms. (Intel)\n\nInvestigates prefetching scheme for servers with respect to realistic memory systems. Real systems disable prefetching in server settings, suggesting that there is a fundamental disconnect between research and practice. This thesis shows that the disconnect is due to the use of simplistic memory models; experimental results suggest that using simplistic models can mis-predict the system performance by a factor of two.\n\nBrinda Ganesh\n\nPh.D. 2007.

(AMD)\n\nThis dissertation shows that both CACTI and eCACTI still contain major limitations and even flaws in their design, making them unsuitable for use in very-deep submicron and nanometer caches, especially pipelined designs. These limitations and flaws are discussed in detail.

The Effects of Out-of-Order Execution on the Memory System. (Intel)\n\nStudies the deleterious effects of out-of-order execution. Common wisdom holds that bigger is better: to wit, the larger the instruction window, the better the performance. Numerous studies show this result, and, consequently, numerous other studies investigate low-cost ways to implement large instruction windows. This study shows that, once one includes a realistic model of the memory system, nearly all of those projected performance gains fail to materialize.\n\nDavid Tawei Wang\n\nPh.D. 2005.
