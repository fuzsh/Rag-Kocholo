        "text": "Earlier this morning Comverse announced a new partnership with Sony Ericsson to bring visual voicemail to future SE handsets. Ever since a certain mobile device (hint: starts with “i” and ends with “phone”) hit the mobilesphere, consumers have been clamoring for visual voicemail on other cell phones / carriers. Slowly, but surely, the incredibly convenient feature has begun to spring up.\n\nBut don’t just take our word for it. According to the press release:\n\nNoticeably absent from the release was any info regarding availability or the mention of any specific devices. Guess we’ll all just have to keep our eyes peeled. No matter…hooray for visual voicemail!"
