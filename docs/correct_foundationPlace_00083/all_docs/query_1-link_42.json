        "text": "WAKEFIELD, Mass., Jan. 23, 2012 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Comverse (Nasdaq:CMVT), a global leader in BSS, Mobile Internet and Value-Added Services, announced today that the Online & Converged Charging deployment mode of its flagship Comverse ONE® Billing and Active Customer Management solution is bringing real-time charging to postpaid environments, addressing the growing need of Communication Service Providers (CSPs) around the world for real-time capabilities.\n\nOnline charging enables postpaid systems to better monetize data services, improving the experience of users through timely notifications, real-time balance & spending management and more. Comverse ONE's productized integration with Comverse Kenan and other postpaid billing systems offers a speedy, phased path to convergence that protects and leverages existing investment, preventing the need for expensive IT transformation projects.\n\nSpanning policy to billing with a telco-specific approach to CRM, Comverse's market-leading single-system BSS solution fuels business transformations and entry into new lines of business, delivering a consistently superior customer experience. It is deployable in a variety of ways, enabling CSPs to take their optimal route to subscriber and revenue growth, rapid time to market, use of real-time marketing, and account updates.\n\nFor example, a Comverse ONE customer recently launched new business models, expanding existing digital television services with advanced real-time rating and charging, leading to increased profitability. Another operator uses Comverse ONE online and converged charging capabilities to augment its Comverse Kenan postpaid billing system with key real-time advantages such as spending control capabilities — experiencing significant postpaid subscriber growth as a result. The foundation for service providers to embark on full business transformation including CRM, Comverse ONE deployments have an established record of lowering network costs and accelerating time to market.\n\nAri Banerjee, Senior Analyst with leading industry analyst firm Heavy Reading, observes that \"a majority of Communications Service Providers, especially mobile operators, signaled in a recent global survey that they will migrate to converged billing within the next two years. Besides improved operational efficiency and having a single place for offer definition, over 85% of mobile operators cited enhanced customer care options for prepaid users and real-time credit control for postpaid subscribers as important benefits driving their converged billing plans.\"\n\n\"One of the first companies with a convergent real-time solution, Comverse continues at the forefront of the market,\" said Roni Levy, Head of Comverse BSS. \"With a constantly expanding client base and a streamlined, phased approach to full convergence for our Kenan installed base and other postpaid systems, Comverse ONE has captured a leading convergent market share in both developed and emerging regions.\"\n\nAbout Comverse\n\nComverse is the world's leading provider of software and systems enabling converged billing and active customer management, mobile Internet, and value-added services.
