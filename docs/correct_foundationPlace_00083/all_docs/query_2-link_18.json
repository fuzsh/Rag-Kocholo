        "text": "A private investigator eyeballed Jacob “Kobi” Alexander – the fugitive CEO of Comverse who went on the lam just as he was set to be indicted for making millions in a stock option backdating scam – in Sri Lanka, he said yesterday.\n\nBut the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Brooklyn, which is prosecuting Alexander for conspiring with top executives at Comverse to pull off the scam in which they pocketed $138 million, said the investigator might be on the wrong track.\n\n“There is no confirmation of Mr. Alexander’s whereabouts,” said Robert Nardoza, a spokesman for the Brooklyn U.S. Attorney.\n\nPrivate detective Moshe Buller, who declined to name the New York venture capital fund that hired him, said he tracked down Alexander in Sri Lanka through money transfers and a Skype Technologies SA phone call made between the country’s capital city, Colombo, and his home in Israel.\n\n“I saw him with my own eyes; it was definitely Kobi,” Buller said. “The place is so small, it wasn’t hard to find him.”\n\nIsraeli newspaper Ma’ariv reported yesterday that Alexander was spotted in Negombo, a Sri Lankan fishing village about 20 miles north of Colombo.\n\n“The FBI is aware of the report and checking whether it’s true,” said U.S. Embassy spokesman Stewart Tuttle.\n\nAlexander, an Israeli national who founded the voice-mail software company in 1984, illegally wired almost $60 million to Israel just weeks before prosecutors were set to unseal an indictment against him and company execs William Sorin and David Kreinberg on Aug. 9, according to court documents.\n\nWithin in a week, the FBI declared Alexander a fugitive, and law enforcement sources said they don’t believe he is currently in Sri Lanka or Israel.\n\nBuller said he also believes Alexander has since left Sri Lanka since he was spotted on Wednesday.\n\nAlexander faces up to 10 years behind bars if convicted in the stock scam, a sentence which could be doubled as a result of his skipping the country.\n\nHis lawyer, Robert Movillo, did not return a call seeking comment.\n\nWith Bloomberg"
