Comverse Technology Inc., a Manhattan software company with deep Long Island roots, has avoided prosecution under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by agreeing to pay a $2.8 million penalty to two federal agencies.

It must pay $1.2 million to the Justice Department and $1.6 million to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The case against Comverse centered on $536,000 in improper payments to officials of a Greek telecom company, OTE, from 2003 to 2006. In exchange OTE agreed to buy services from Comverse, officials said.

Comverse is the majority owner of Verint Systems Inc., a Melville security software company. A company spokesman was not immediately available for comment Thursday.

Long based in Woodbury, Comverse under former chief executive Jacob "Kobi" Alexander grew into a billion-dollar corporation specializing in software for voice communications. The Comverse headquarters was moved to Manhattan in 2005.

Along with paying the $2.8 million penalty, Comverse had to accept responsibility for falsely recording in an Israeli subsidiary's ledgers that the $536,000 in payments were legitimate.

"The agreement recognizes the company's thorough self-investigation and the results of its investigation, voluntary disclosure of the underlying conduct, and full cooperation with the department," a Justice Department news release said.

The company "has also undertaken extensive remedial efforts and overhauled its overall compliance culture . . . " the department said.

The repercussions of Alexander's alleged accounting misdeeds, which included backdating options, continued to be felt last month when Comverse replaced its chief executive.
