Jason Mirandi

Wildlife photographer based in Eastern Pennsylvania, capturing images across the United States

About me

I’m a guy with a lot of passions. An urban search & rescue technician and Pennsylvania State wildland firefighter, I’ve recently re-connected with a lifelong love of photography, nature and wildlife. While the rescue work appeals to one side of my personality, I’ve turned to photography for relaxation and a different sense of purpose.

I travel frequently, but I currently live with my family outside of Philadelphia, where you can oftentimes find me hiking local trails with my equipment in tow.

Equipment

I shoot with a Nikon Z8, D850 and D7100. I have multiple lenses, my best and most frequently used listed below:

Nikon 600mm f/4 G ED VR

Nikon Z 180-600 f/5.6-6.3

Nikon 200-500 f/5.6

Nikon 70-200 f/2.8 ED VRII

Nikon 24-70 f/2.8 VR

Tokina atx-i 100mm f/2.8 Macro

Nikon 50mm f/1.8

I sometimes couple these with a TC-14E-II teleconverter, and while I usually shoot handheld, I do often use a Vanguard Alta Pro tripod which is married to a Movo gimbal, or to stay more mobile, a Sirui P-326 monopod with a Manfrotto quick disconnect head. I also have various other accessories, mounts, and supporting equipment for low angle shooting, travel, and weather conditions.

Locations

I’ve had the privilege to shoot all over the country, and the images you’ll find in my gallery are from various locations, including:
