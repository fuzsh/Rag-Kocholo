        "text": "Does the thought of making videos for your online business seem out of reach?\n\nMaybe you’ve tried to record yourself before, but wanted to crawl into a sewer of embarrassment after watching it back.\n\nOn top of that, with cameras, lights, and file formats, it may seem too complex and pricey.\n\nSure, you bust a movie on TikTok now and again, but you couldn’t possibly make “real” videos, right?\n\nHold up.\n\nYou can actually make high-quality videos with little more than a smartphone and a $10 microphone.\n\nI’ll go over why and how to do video production for your business, even if the last thing you filmed was on your mom’s old camcorder (good thing no one has a VHS player anymore, huh?).\n\nWhy you need to create videos for your business\n\nWhen you’re growing your business, there’s a lot to do. Video is probably low on your priority list. But, you should nudge it closer to the top. Here’s why…\n\nPeople expect it\n\nCheck out any reputable brand, and you’ll find they at least have some video up. If they don’t, you might scratch your head and think, “Dude, is this company even legit?”\n\nSure, it’s easy to put a YouTube link on your site’s footer, but when people actually click that sucker, they want to see something.\n\nFrom unboxing videos, to reviews and customer stories, people love obsessing over products.\n\nThat’s because the more they see, the more at ease they are to buy.\n\nVideo gives a sense of trust\n\nIf people don’t trust you, they’ll get sketched out and run to your competitor. One that doesn’t give off those creepy non-video-having vibes.\n\nThe more time that goes by without having a video presence, the longer you’re missing out on potential traffic and sales.\n\nBut, won’t I make my brand look cheap?\n\nIf you’re making a commercial for TV, sure, maybe it’s time to bring in the pros. But online, it’s a free-for-all.\n\nIn the world of TikTok and Instagram, people are used to rough, off-the-cuff video. And a lot of times, it’s actually preferred over polished content.\n\nIf you run a small online business, people don’t expect some Scorsese-level production.\n\nYou’re not BMW or GEICO, so don’t try to be. These days, consumers crave realness from a company.\n\nJust remember, the “what” is most important.\n\nVideo isn’t held to the same standards as written content. Meaning, when it comes to video, your quality has to be good, but not amazing.\n\nAs long as people can hear the audio, and they’re not getting motion sickness from what’s on-screen, you’re golden.\n\nBenefits of adding video to your business\n\nVideo can help boost your sales if you do it right. You can showcase what you have to offer, and customers can see they’re buying from real people.\n\nThere are many other benefits to adding video to your WordPress business. Here are just a few:\n\nBoost SEO\n\nWhile it’s constantly evolving, Google’s algorithm likes video content.\n\nThis is especially true with its new Helpful Content Update. Google wants to promote content that’s “people-first.”\n\nTotal video-hours watched continues to grow, so what’s more people-first than giving them what they crave?\n\nUp your conversions\n\nSpeaking of Google, they say that digital video is the new window shopping.\n\nIt’s even been noted that 88% of people surveyed say they’ve been convinced to buy a product or service by watching a brand’s video.\n\nHow many hours have you spent on Yelp scoping out a new restaurant before finally deciding to go? (Don’t lie.)\n\nPeople shopping for both physical and digital goods do the same.\n\nIncrease brand awareness\n\nIf you’re creative enough to do it well, video is memorable.\n\nThat funny wipe-out clip you use will stick in a viewer’s mind.\n\nIt’s been noted that people are twice as likely to share video content than any other type.\n\nIt makes sense if you think about it.\n\nHow often do you share an article or blog post? Maybe a couple times a week? Maybe a little more if there’s some political drama going on?\n\nNow think about the number of cat-fail IG Reels flying from phone to phone every day. It’s massive!\n\nGet a good ROI\n\nMaking videos on the cheap gives a small business a big bang for its buck.\n\nAccording to a survey by HubSpot, 68% of marketers say content showcasing their products and services generates the biggest ROI.\n\nThat’s probably why 56% of brands in one recent survey said they planned to increase their Instagram video investment.\n\nKeep users on your page\n\nThe math on this one is simple.\n\nThe more time a user spends on a page = the more likely they are to buy.\n\nWistia found that people spent on average about 1.4x more time on pages with video than on those without!\n\nAttention spans are being twisted in all directions, so keeping people focused on you can be tricky. Video is the perfect tool to grab and keep attention.\n\nWith all these benefits, there’s no reason not to learn the basics and start posting videos now.\n\nTypes of video for online business\n\nVideo can be used for all sorts of things. It can be:\n\nA product to sell\n\nWith MemberPress + WordPress, you can easily sell videos online behind a paywall. For example, you could sell:\n\nIndividual videos, for a one-time fee\n\nAccess to a bunch of them, with a monthly or yearly membership\n\nEpisodes released over time, like webisodes or video podcasts\n\nA lot of MemberPress creators sell things like:\n\nOnline video courses\n\nFitness routines\n\nLessons (music, cooking, and more)\n\nTutorials and how-to videos\n\nExclusive webinars\n\nLive classes\n\nand more!\n\nReally, you can charge for anything that takes expertise and time to make.\n\nMarketing Material\n\nVideo is one of the best ways to get the word out about your business.\n\nEach social platform has different people using it, and it’s where hot new products are discovered.\n\nJust to give you a few ideas, you can make:\n\nBehind-the-scenes peaks of your products or business\n\nIntro or team videos\n\nCustomer stories or reviews\n\nPromos and teasers for anything you’re selling\n\nTo make things easy, repurpose your longer-form videos into ads and promo clips.\n\nHow-to videos\n\nVideo tutorials are the best way to help customers use your site or product. If you make it easy, they’ll stick with you and buy more.\n\nWant to dig through Roomba’s user manual to figure out why it’s not finding the charger? Didn’t think so.\n\nBut, what if you could just search a video hub? Bingo, there’s almost surely a quick video to help you fix the problem.\n\nOkay, you don’t need any more convincing. So let’s get filming!\n\nHow to make videos (on the cheap)\n\nBelieve it or not, you may already have the main piece of gear you need.\n\nIf not, don’t worry. Your credit card won’t get too dinged up.\n\nStep 1) Choose a recording style\n\nSo, you know what kind of video you’re going to make (for example, an online course).\n\nNext, you need to choose how you’re going to film it.\n\nOn-camera\n\nThis is simple. It’s you, standing or sitting, talking to a camera.\n\nIf that sounds daunting, don’t worry.\n\nTurn your smartphone into a teleprompter with an app, or get creative and DIY your own.\n\nYou can also use the power of editing to cut out mistakes, overlay images to cover up that weird face you just made, and more. See, not so bad.\n\nOff-camera\n\nHaving a bad hair year, or just don’t want to be on-screen?\n\nRecord a voiceover. This can be:\n\nImpromptu\n\nFrom a written script\n\nOr Mix and match the two (script an intro and record the rest on the fly)\n\nThen create graphics and screen recordings to edit with your voiceover. This works great for tutorials.\n\nYou can also film whatever you’re talking about, whether that’s food, books, crafts, or something else.\n\nOnce you pick your recording style, you’ll have an idea of what equipment you need. Which brings us to the next step.\n\nStep 2) Gear up\n\nThere are two main things to think about – video and audio.\n\nSmartphone or Camera\n\nTo capture video, you have two options:\n\nA smartphone\n\nA dedicated camera\n\nIf you’re a beginner, use your phone.\n\nYup, that’s right. Great looking weddings, music videos, and much more have been filmed with an iPhone.\n\nThen, get a tripod and phone clamp. I recommend the Manfrotto PIXI Mini Kit, which has both.\n\nFor some cheaper options, check out the Square Jellyfish, ULANZI Mini Flexible Tripod, or Acuvar Flexible Tripod.\n\nYou can also buy a smartphone clamp separately, and use whatever affordable tripod you can find.\n\nFor some phone-life balance, use a camera instead.\n\nThere are plenty of vlog-style cameras under $400 to choose from, such as the Panasonic LUMIX DC-ZS70K or Panasonic LUMIX FZ80.\n\nOr step it up and invest in a more expensive option like the Sony ZV-1.\n\nThen, snag a tripod, a memory card, and you’re ready to go.\n\nMicrophone\n\nSound is more important than video. Did you hear that?\n\nPeople will put up with low quality video, but if they can’t hear it or it sounds annoying, they’ll turn it off.\n\nDo not use the built-in microphone, on either a phone or camera.\n\nInstead, invest in one of these:\n\nA tabletop USB microphone, like the Blue Yeti, Blue Snowball, or Samson Q2U. Just make sure it’s USB, otherwise you’ll spend a lot of money on adapters.\n\nOptional: Get a microphone arm stand and pop filter to look like a hip podcaster.\n\nLavalier mics. These pin on your shirt, and can often plug right into a smartphone. Check out the PoP Voice Lapel Mic, Pixel Lavalier, or Rode SmartLav+.\n\nPro-tip: You can also hide the microphone cord under your shirt.\n\nIf you have some extra cash, go with a wireless option instead. These come in handy if you’re moving around in a gym or kitchen.\n\nOn-camera or shotgun microphones, like the Movo VXR10.\n\nThese can be mounted on top of your phone or camera, or placed next to your mouth with a tripod or boom arm. Just be sure to hide the mic in your shot.\n\nLighting\n\nYour cheapest option is the sun. It’s free, at least until they start charging for it.\n\nLet as much sunlight in the room as you can, without it being too harsh on your subject.\n\nJust be sure to avoid filming with your back to a window.\n\nIn a room where the sun don’t shine, try some household or cheap items to light your video. Things like:\n\nDesk or table lamps\n\nPaper lanterns\n\nClamp lights\n\nOr, snag a more pro option, such as:\n\nA ring light like this one from UBeesize\n\nVideo conference lights\n\nA softbox\n\nYouTube is chock full of videos showcasing creative ways to light videos. You can also find plenty of DIY light kit tutorials online to avoid expensive ones.\n\nSoftware\n\nHere are some totally free options for recording and editing:\n\nUse a free video editor like HitFilm or Adobe Express. iMovie works great too.\n\nTake screen captures with software like OBS or Quicktime.\n\nRecord voiceovers with Audacity.\n\nStep 3) Choose a location\n\nIf you’re going to be on-camera, you want your background to be pleasing to the eye. Here are two easy options:\n\nUse an existing space\n\nUse a large, open room. It can be a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. You just want to avoid looking cramped or filming yourself directly against a wall.\n\nHere’s some tips:\n\nClean up the clutter. This isn’t your Hoarders debut. Also, hide anything embarrassing you have in the background.\n\nChoose somewhere quiet. This may seem obvious, but even a slight street noise or appliance hum can ruin your audio.\n\nAvoid empty rooms. Film somewhere that’s full of stuff. Furniture, carpets, pillows, etc all help dampen sound and avoid echo.\n\nAlso, when you’re positioned on-camera, make sure there’s isn’t anything directly behind your head.\n\nA lot of iPhone lenses let you use a large aperture to blur the background. You can even do this with a built-in feature on newer iPhones.\n\nBuild a dedicated backdrop or room\n\nDon’t have a place in your house free of wild kids running around? Build your own dedicated video area.\n\nSnag some photo paper and lights to create a solid color background.\n\nUse a wall. Sit 5+ feet away and shine some light behind you to separate yourself from the wall.\n\nSet up a desk-space with some LED lights like many YouTubers do.\n\nSide-note: If you’re only recording voiceover, surround your microphone with pillows to block out ambient noise, or get a portable sound proofing booth.\n\nStep 4) Film\n\nThe moment has finally come, it’s time to hit record.\n\nFind a spot to sit or stand and do whatever it takes to position your camera. Put your tripod on a stack of books if you have to.\n\nWatch up on how to frame a shot to make it look good.\n\nAnd, as a general rule, film more than you need. You’ll thank yourself later when editing.\n\nHere are some other things to consider:\n\nDo a few practice runs to get used to talking about your material and warm-up your voice.\n\nLeave some space on the recording before and after you’re done talking. This gives your footage “room” for transitions in editing.\n\nRecord at least 2-3 takes, so you can choose the best one\n\nWhile filming, remote start the recordings with your voice or Apple Watch to save you some hassle.\n\nOne last thing. Before you wrap up, make sure your footage actually saved. Also, check the sound quality to ensure nothing went wrong.\n\nStep 5) Edit\n\nNow that you have your raw material, it’s time to put it together.\n\nTransfer the video files to your computer (AirDrop works wonders on Mac). Then import them into your editor.\n\nTry to keep your videos short and concise. Remove redundant parts, and long pauses.\n\nHere are some other tips to polish things up:\n\nAdd music. Look through free resources like Pixabay and FreePD\n\nAdjust the volume of your vocals. You don’t want it too quiet or distorted\n\nColor-correct your shots so they all match\n\nThen, check the file specifications for the platform you’re uploading to. This will make your video the highest quality possible.\n\nThen, export the file!\n\nBonus Steps: Host and Sell Your Videos\n\nOnce those videos are exported, put them to use!\n\nWith MemberPress + WordPress, you’ll be able to monetize your videos in no time.\n\nStep 1) Create a website\n\nFirst, you’ll need to:\n\nGet a domain name\n\nBuy some web hosting\n\nInstall WordPress on your web host\n\nThen, create your site. Use page builders like Beaver Builder or DIVI to make things easy.\n\nStep 2) Install the MemberPress Plugin\n\nPurchase a MemberPress plan and download the plugin zip file from the Account page of the MemberPress website.\n\nThen upload the plugin from your WordPress Dashboard.\n\nOnce installed, the MemberPress Setup Wizard will guide you through the basics, like adding a payment method.\n\nStep 3) Create a membership\n\nThis is what will let you sell content.\n\nFrom the left sidebar of the WordPress Dashboard, go to MemberPress > Memberships. Then click Add New.\n\nNext, choose your Membership Terms.
