        "text": "Sound, lighting, backdrops, tripods… my gosh it’s a lot! Self-tapes were already on the rise, but now, they are the norm! Recent events have accelerated this trend, so it’s key to be prepared for all self-tape audition opportunities that come your way.\n\nFor detailed tips on working the frames, make sure you’ve checked out my comprehensive self-tape blog called The Art of Self-Tape. After you’ve become familiar with my artistic tips for self-taping, the equipment tips below will help elevate the technical aspects of your process.\n\nYou have filming options!\n\nYou might be used to self-taping on your phone, but also consider that Zoom can be useful for taping because it allows you to integrate a remote reader smoothly. Ask a friend to jump on Zoom with you!\n\nTip: Did you know we have a “Find a Reader” network in our Acting Collective? Members help each other out at short notice all the time. Another option is to check out the platform WeAudition to find a reader instantly (free or for hire). You can rehearse or film together using WeAudition’s taping feature, then export files to quickly submit. Or, you can utilize the reader and set up your own camera to film.\n\nOPTION 1: USE A CAMERA\n\nSet up your camera or smartphone as well as your lights, sound, and background. Tape with a reader at home. Your reader can be local (in the room) or remote (via a computer or cell phone video or audio). In both circumstances, the reader is positioned next to the camera, as close as possible.\n\nOPTION 2: USE ZOOM\n\nSet up your computer, smartphone, or tablet at eye level for filming. Whoever is the host on Zoom can record. This is how I run class—I film people remotely on Zoom. You can use the other elements of your set-up as well: lights, sound, backdrop, etc. For more tips on how to use Zoom for auditions, go to my blog post How to Self-Tape Auditions on Zoom!\n\nP.S. If you’re looking for a way to get rid of the black bars on either side of the video when you film via Zoom on an iPhone or iPad, check out this article about how to crop your video. But, please know that it’s completely acceptable and professional to leave the black bars.\n\nEquipment Recommendations for Self-Tapes\n\nBelow are some equipment recommendations that actors have given me. Let it be a starting point for your research! Always check that any prospective equipment is compatible with your existing technology. Do you use an iPhone? An Android? A Mac or a Windows PC? Read the product specs and make sure you consider whether it comes with the necessary accessories (e.g., input cords, adapter plugs, stands, etc.) or if you’ll have to get them separately. If an item is no longer available via our link, you could Google the name and see if it’s available elsewhere. (Heads up: some of the links below are affiliate links, meaning the studio gets a small commission when you purchase at no extra cost to you. Thanks!)\n\n• Sound & Mics for Self-Tapes\n\nPlease check the specs of the device that you’re connecting a mic to so that you can select the ideal mic. For example, what is the required input connector for your computer, phone, or camera? Adapter cords are often an option to make an item work.\n\nAlso, if you typically film your self-tapes on a camera or your phone, but then you do auditions via Zoom/Eco-Cast on your computer, keep that in mind when selecting your mic connector. Select the one that you are prioritizing to start.\n\nSpecial note: if you are experiencing any static or interference noise with any mic connected to a phone, test it in airplane mode.\n\nLAV MICS\n\npOp Voice Omnidirectional Lav Mic for Smartphone (PC adapter included)\n\nPowerDeWise Professional Omnidirectional Lavalier Mic\n\nRode SmartLav+ Omnidirectional Lavalier Microphone\n\npOp Voice Dual-Head Omnidirectional Lav Mic\n\nYelloWay Dual Lavalier Lapel Microphone\n\nValband Omnidirectional Lav Mic for iPhone\n\nMOUNTED MICS\n\nComica CVM-V30 PRO Camera Microphone\n\nMovo VXR10 Universal Video Microphone w/ Mount & Windscreen\n\nBOYA BY-MM1 Universal Camera Microphone\n\nShure MV88 Portable Condensor iOS Microphone\n\n^This one might be especially useful for singers as well as actors!\n\nRode VideoMic GO Lightweight On-Camera Microphone\n\nUSB MICS\n\nBlue Yeti USB Microphone\n\nSamson Satellite USB/iOS Broadcast Microphone Deluxe Bundle\n\nACCESSORIES\n\nApple Lightning to 3.5 mm Headphone Jack Adapter\n\n• Lighting for Self-Tapes\n\nAlways an important element! We need to see your EYES!\n\nTip to avoid shadows: Place two lights at 45-degree angles in front of you, then make sure you’re standing 2-3 feet in front of the backdrop.\n\nGenaray Spectro LED Essential 500IIB Bi-Color LED 2-Light Kit\n\n^My top choice! It’s small, but mighty. And easy to set up!\n\nMOUNTDOG Softbox Lighting Kit w/ Updated LED and Remote\n\nLimoStudio Continuous 26″ Octagonal Soft Box Lighting Light Kit\n\nNeewer 2 Pieces Bi-color 660 LED Video Light and Stand Kit\n\nGVM 800D-RGB LED Studio 2-Video Light Kit\n\nLume Cube Video Conference Lighting Kit\n\nNeewer Ring Light Kit\n\nGenaray 2-Light Soft and Simple Audition Kit\n\nNewmowa 60 LED High Power Rechargeable Clip Fill Video Conference Light\n\nRALENO 19.5W LED Video Soft Light\n\n• Backdrops for Self-Tapes\n\nI recommend a neutral color backdrop—like gray—that will suit all genres. Blue can work fine for comedy, commercials, or projects with a brighter tone/mood. Evaluate your setup and see if you need a backdrop stand as well (scroll down for those). Avoid green because that is associated with green-screen acting.\n\nIf you select a hanging fabric backdrop, set it as far behind you as possible to reduce both shadows and to blur the appearance of wrinkles.\n\nHeads up! Sellers will change their color options from time to time, or items may sell out/come back in stock, so take a close look at the details if you decide to buy!\n\nKATE BRAND COLLAPSIBLE BACKDROPS:\n\nKate Collapsible Backdrop, “Dark Gray-Blue/Textured Dark Grey”\n\n^The textured grey is helpful for hiding shadows\n\nKate Collapsible Backdrop, “Pink/Beige”\n\n^I find the pink to by more rosy, it’s not a hot pink with lights and camera. The beige is a soft beige.\n\nKate Collapsible Backdrop, “Gray/Pink”\n\nOTHER COLLAPSIBLE BACKDROPS:\n\nSelens Collapsible Backdrop, “Blue/Grey”\n\nePhotoInc Collapsible Background – Twist Flex, Double-Sided Pop-Out Muslin Backdrop, “Gray/Blue”\n\nFovitec Double-Sided Pop-Up Collapsible Backdrop for Video & Photo, “Gray & Blue” or “Cool Gray”\n\nHANGING BACKDROPS\n\nGFCC Gray Backdrop – 8FTX10FT Grey Photo Backdrop for Photoshoot Background for Photography Screen Video Recording Picture Background\n\nKate 6ft×9ft Solid Gray Backdrop Portrait Background for Photography Studio\n\nSuperior Seamless Photography Background Paper, “Neutral Gray”\n\nMUZI Photography Backdrops “Dark Gray Muslin Background”\n\nNeed a video tutorial on how to put those darn things back in the bag?

In addition to these, also consider looking at standing desks, laptop risers, piles of books, boxes, etc. to raise your computer if you’re using it.\n\nUrmust Laptop Riser Stand\n\nLapGear Ergo Lap Desk\n\n^If your stand doesn’t have a tilt feature, add this to it! This can be placed anywhere—like on top of your desk—to get your laptop at eye level. It also eases general neck tension! I use it for teaching!\n\nHola! Music HPS-300B HEAVY Duty Professional Multi-Purpose DJ Tripod Stand\n\nHola! Music HPS-290B LIGHT Professional Tripod Projector Mixer Stand\n\nStellar Labs 555-11690 Heavy Duty Laptop/Projector Presentation Stand\n\n• Webcam for Self-Tapes\n\nAre you wanting to see the casting director or reader in a larger image than your cell phone? Tired of squinting? Then you can still use a laptop and get great amazing quality if you attach a webcam! All computer cameras are 720p. So a webcam will be a great boost.\n\nPlus, some webcam models can be attached to a tripod, standing or tabletop. This gives you a little more freedom to position it in line with where the reader is on your screen (or even to move it away from your light sources if your eyes are sensitive to the brightness).\n\nPlease note that I still stand by the idea that if you have strong lights, then the image will be crisper. Always start there.\n\nAnker PowerConf C200 2K Webcam\n\nLogitech HD Pro Webcam C920, Widescreen Video Calling and Recording, 1080p Camera\n\n• Camera Accessories for Self-Tapes\n\nEXTERNAL CAMERA CAPTURE CARD\n\nYou can connect your DSLR, camcorder, or action cam to your computer. If you have a nice camera and want to use it over Zoom in place of your built-in laptop camera, try something like this.\n\nElgato Cam Link 4K, External Camera Capture Card\n\nPHONE CAMERA REMOTE\n\niPhone Camera Shutter Remote\n\n• Ethernet Adapters\n\nHOW TO CONNECT YOUR COMPUTER OR PHONE DIRECTLY TO YOUR ROUTER\n\nFor auditions over Zoom or Eco-Cast Live, strong internet connection is key. No one wants glitchy freezes or slowdowns in their audition. So, if you prefer using your phone for live auditions, you can get around poor wi-fi connection by plugging your phone directly into your router.\n\nGiochem RJ45 Ethernet Adapter for iPhone/iPad\n\nUSB C to Ethernet Adapter for MacBook Pro, Air, Dell XPS, and more\n\nWHERE TO FIND MORE RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nKeep checking out blogs and articles from your favorite acting resources. Browse the web, look at related products, and read reviews. Remember, this is just a starting point!\n\nKeep going!"
