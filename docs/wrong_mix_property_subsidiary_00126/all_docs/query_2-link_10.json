It is a unique numeric identifier that is used to identify general characteristics about bank cards in the payments industry. It allows you to identify details such as: name of the bank that issued the card, the card funding type ( Debit or Credit ), global card schemes like Visa, MasterCard, Amex, card category levels such as (personal) or commercial (business) or card product name such as Classic, Gold, Platinum country of origin.\n\nBy performing an IIN Lookup you can also identify the financial institution name (issuing bank name) of co-branded cards. Those are cards issued by banks in joint sponsorship with the retail merchants and bin sponsors who issue reloadable prepaid cards and non-reloadable gift cards.\n\nYou may try the demo search with some of the following examples: 527346 Revolut, 422803 movo.cash, 559900 Yandex, 440393 cash.app Virtual, 484718 Vanilla, 377750, 372888, 375150 Bluebird"
