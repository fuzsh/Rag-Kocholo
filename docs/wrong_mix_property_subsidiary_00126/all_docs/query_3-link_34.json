        "text": "Why is a good podcast microphone important?\n\nWhy should you even care about getting a good microphone for your podcast?\n\n1. We have stronger physiological responses to audio than video\n\nDo you want your audience to innately feel something when listening to your podcast?\n\nAs part of a study, researchers from University College London made participants watch and listen to several videos and audiobooks. The results showed that participants had stronger physiological responses from audio stories rather than videos. Their heart rate was higher and their bodies were warmer when listening to the audiobooks compared to watching the videos.\n\nIf our bodies react more to audio than video stimuli, shouldnât you make sure that you deliver great-sounding audio?\n\nThe fundamentals of great-sounding audio begin with crisp and clear recordings of you, your co-hosts, and your guests speaking. That comes down to choosing the best recording microphone set up for your podcast.\n\n2. Good audio quality is no longer the exception, but the norm\n\nIf you listen to the top podcasts on iTunes or Spotify, you will find that they have one thing in common - good audio quality. While you may argue that good audio quality with a great microphone is not the sole reason for their success, the fact that the most popular podcasts deliver superb-sounding audio inadvertently shifts the reference point of a good podcast.\n\nGood audio quality has become a prerequisite to running a great podcast.\n\n3. Have your podcast been taken seriously\n\nIf we assume that all the other things that make a podcast great are in place, excellent quality audio will give your show more legitimacy. Why?\n\nGood quality audio not only makes you sound more professional but also signals to your audience that you are serious and sincere about delivering a high-quality podcast.Â\n\nAs you try to build up credibility in your podcasting genre, good audio quality is a must.Â\n\nIt helps to show that you are dedicated to providing your audience with a pleasant auditory experience.\n\nAnd checkout our guide to the best podcast software\n\nCan you use your iPhone as a podcast microphone?\n\nGood quality audio is essential, but we know podcast equipment can be expensive. So, what if you only have a phone lying around? Can you just use your phone as your podcast microphone instead?\n\nIt dependsâ¦\n\nIf you want to test the waters to determine if you like podcasting before entirely investing in a proper microphone, using your phoneâs microphone to record your first few episodes could make sense.\n\nHowever, if you are serious about podcasting, we recommend that you eventually get a dedicated external microphone with the proper hardware to record your podcast.\n\nHow should you decide what external microphone is the best for you then?\n\nHow to choose a podcast microphone: What to considerÂ\n\nEssentially, different microphones have different features, making them great for various purposes. Thus, you have to be clear on your purpose and budget to figure out which microphone is the most suitable for you.\n\nHere are some questions that you should ask yourself to get started with understanding what type of microphone you will need:\n\n1. Think about your recording location\n\nAre you going to be recording in a studio, your bedroom, your office, or in a public space?\n\nHow noisy is it in the space that you plan to record in? Are you situated next to a busy road where you can hear cars or people go by?\n\nWill you have other roommates or family members in the same house as you when recording?\n\nAre you recording in one location, or will you be moving around frequently to different spaces to record?\n\n2. Factor in your use case\n\nAre you recording voices talking?\n\nAre you recording ambient noises for effect?\n\nAre you recording or streaming a live podcast?\n\n3. Decide if youâll be recording with others\n\nAre you recording a solo cast?\n\nAre you recording with a co-host or guest(s) in the same room?\n\n4. Focus on your recording goals\n\nAre you planning on keeping your podcast style constant?\n\nAre you planning on bettering your gear after you have launched a few episodes of your âminimum viable podcastâ?\n\nAre you planning on producing a narrated storytelling podcast?\n\nAre you planning on including live podcasts in the future?\n\nIs your podcast for a business?\n\n5. Keep your budget in mind\n\nWhat kind of budget do you have?\n\n$100? $200? $500? $1000 and over?\n\nWe do need to stress, though - you do not need to spend a lot to get a good microphone. However, what you do require is to understand what you need from your microphone and microphone set up. That will, in turn, inform what kind of microphone you should get.\n\nHow much does a good microphone cost?\n\nIf youâre looking for a good microphone, weâd say you can probably expect to buy one at around $100 or more. You donât necessarily have to choose the most expensive microphone for the best quality, many budgeted microphones will do great and are sometimes even better than pricier options.\n\nWhen you are ready, you may continue to the next part of the article, where we will delve into the basics of soundâ¦\n\nâThe basics of sound and microphones\n\nWhat is sound?\n\nSound is a form of energy. When you clap your hands, you make the air molecules vibrate around your hand. These sound waves or air vibrations enter your ear, and your brain processes them as sound. (Recall those dreaded physics classes you had as a child? Theyâre finally put to good use!)\n\nWhat do microphones do with sound?\n\nMicrophones convert sound waves (mechanical energy) into electrical energy. This electrical energy is also known as analog audio signals.Â\n\nOne essential part of a microphone is the microphone diaphragm.Â\n\nThe microphone diaphragm is a thin membrane that vibrates when struck by sound waves. When the diaphragm vibrates, the other components vibrate. The vibrations are then converted into an electrical current (the analog audio signal).\n\nHow is recorded sound sent to a computer?\n\nFor your computer to read the analog audio signal from your microphone, you must convert the analog signal to a digital signal that your computer can understand. These digital signals are the 0s and 1s that every computer uses to store and understand data.\n\nCool! How is this done?\n\nThere are two usual methods to this:\n\n1. Some microphones perform the analog-to-digital conversion\n\nSome microphones can fully perform the analog-to-digital conversion. The microphone first records an analog audio signal and then converts it to a digital signal with its built-in analog-to-digital (ADC) converter. The digital signal is directly sent from the microphone to the computer. The microphone normally outputs the digital signal with a USB connection.\n\n2. External devices can perform the analog-to-digital conversion\n\nAn audio interface is an external device that helps perform analog-to-digital conversion. A microphone is typically connected to an external audio interface in such a setup, and the audio interface is connected to a computer. The audio interface converts an analog signal to a digital signal and sends the digital signal to the computer.Â\n\nThis external audio interface can either be a dedicated standalone audio interface, a USB mixer or connected to an audio interface. We generally recommend a dedicated standalone audio interface for most podcasting purposes (more about this in our audio interface vs audio mixer article). In such cases, microphones typically output the analog signal via XLR or TRS connections (more about that later too).\n\nWhat to look for in a microphone: What is your ideal microphone type?\n\nNow that you have a basic understanding of recording sound, letâs focus on what you should look for in choosing your ideal microphone. Weâll go into detail later but essentially youâll need to look at the following microphone factors:\n\nPolar pattern or directionality\n\nMicrophone type - Dynamic or Condenser\n\nMicrophone connection - USB or XLR\n\nAnother factor you may want to consider includes frequency response, which mostly refers to the sensitivity of the microphone and what sound range it picks up. All microphones differ when it comes to this and itâs hard to categorize them but we go into a little more detail on frequency responses in our best podcast microphone guide.\n\nTo sum up, this is how youâll get your ideal microphone type.\n\nMicrophone type formula: Polar Pickup Pattern + Dynamic or Condenser + USB or XLR = Your Ideal Microphone Type\n\nYour ideal microphone type combines the polar pickup pattern, the category (dynamic mic or condenser mic), and the connection (USB or XLR).\n\nIn the following sections, we will explain what they mean to you and present our recommendations for each variable.\n\nIf youâd like to jump ahead, here are our recommendations on the types of microphones for various purposes:\n\nRecommendations â Polar pickup pattern\n\nRecommendations â Dynamic vs. condenser microphoneâ\n\nRecommendations â USB vs. XLR microphone\n\n(A) Polar pickup pattern\n\nEver seen this beast of a chart?\n\nThis is the polar response chart of a Shure SM7B, one of the most popular podcast mics.\n\nAre you now thinking - âthe chart looks complicated, technical, and honestly probably something I donât need to know aboutâ?Â\n\nWe will show you why polar pickup patterns will be helpful for you as a podcaster and how easy it is to understand the polar response charts.\n\nWhat is a polar pickup pattern?\n\nA polar pickup pattern describes how much sound a microphone will pick up in each direction. Essentially, different microphones respond to sounds coming from various directions differently! Thus a polar pickup pattern helps you understand how a particular microphone responds to sounds coming from different directions.\n\nMicrophones can have varying levels of sensitivity to sound coming from different directions. Sensitivity is the amount of output for an input.\n\nThere will be a strong output signal vis-Ã -vis the input sign with high sensitivity.\n\nThere will be a low output signal vis-Ã -vis the input signal when there is low sensitivity.\n\nUnderstanding polar pickup patterns will help you choose a microphone that picks up sound in the manner you want.Â\n\nFor instance, if you will be the only one talking directly into your microphone, you would want a microphone that picks up the most sound from the front of the microphone, not the back. This microphone would be the most sensitive to sounds coming from the front.\n\nIf you are new to microphones, you would also want the microphone to give you a bit of leeway such that even if you donât position the microphone 100% perfectly in front of you, or if you like to move around as you speak, you would still be able to hear your voice at a decent volume. This microphone would be sensitive to sounds coming from the front and area near the sides.\n\nIt is also good to remember that all microphones also have different frequency responses.\n\nWhat is a polar response chart?\n\nThankfully, there is a more straightforward method to understand and visualize the microphone's pickup pattern.\n\nBeholdâ¦ A polar response chart!\n\nA polar response chart is a standardized way of displaying a microphoneâs directional characteristics or sensitivity in different directions.\n\nThe following is the polar pattern of the Audio-Technica ATR2100x-USB.\n\nHow do you read it?\n\nHere are some tips on reading a polar response chart:\n\nThe dark curved lines represent the sensitivity of the particular microphone when sound arrives from different directions\n\nThe innermost circular ring represents low sensitivity\n\nThe outermost circular ring represents high sensitivity\n\nStraight lines represent the direction of incoming sound\n\n0Âº - Straight into a microphone diaphragm\n\n270Âº and 90Âº - From the side of the microphone diaphragm\n\n80Âº - From the back of the microphone diaphragm\n\nAs seen in the legend, the different line styles (dots, dash, etc.) represent the polar pattern for varying frequencies\n\nLetâs do a quick read of the ATR2100x-USB microphone!\n\nFrom the chart, we can tell that the ATR2100x-USB picks up the most sound when you speak directly into the microphone from the front, 0Âº on-axis, for all frequencies. It rejects sound from the back of the microphone, and to a lesser extent, from the sides. There is leeway when using the microphone, as there is a relatively good pick up from 300Âº to 60Âº.\n\nType of polar pickup patterns\n\nLetâs proceed to learn about the six main types of pickup patterns that you will encounter when searching for a microphone.\n\nOmni-directional microphones\n\nDirectional microphones - Bi-directional (Figure 8)\n\nDirectional microphones - Cardioid\n\nDirectional microphones - Hyper-cardioid (Mini shotgun)\n\nDirectional microphones - Super-cardioid\n\nDirectional microphones - Lobar/Shotgun\n\n1. Omni-directional microphones\n\nOmni-directional microphones are designed to be equally sensitive to sound from all directions.\n\nPros:\n\nThey are suitable for picking up an overall room sound or groups.\n\nThey are thus great if you are recording at a specific location and want to capture the background ambient noise for effect.\n\nCons:\n\nThey are not suitable for selective sound pickup or isolating certain sounds.\n\nIf you use one omnidirectional microphone to capture the multiple people talking, you will not isolate each voice during post-production and make isolated adjustments.\n\nIf you capture more than one voice, do not go for an omnidirectional microphone. Opt for a one-directional microphone per speaker instead.\n\nExamples: Blue Snowball, Rode smartLav+,Movo HM-M2\n\n2. Directional microphones - Bi-directional (figure 8)\n\nDirectional microphones are, in general, more sensitive to sounds coming from specific directions.\n\nWhat are they: Bi-directional microphones are designed to pick up sound from the front and the back of the microphone and reject sound from the sides. This is also known as a Figure 8 pattern.\n\nPros:Â\n\nThey are suitable for Q&A-style discussions, such as an in-person lecture where a lecturer asks the audience questions and accepts them.\n\nThese microphones are commonly used for musical instrument recordings.Â\n\nCons:\n\nIf you use a bi-directional microphone to capture the sound of two people talking, you will not isolate each voice during post-production and make isolated adjustments.\n\nEven for interviews, stay away from bi-directional microphones. Use one microphone per speaker instead, such as a cardioid microphone.\n\nExamples: Blue Yeti & Warm Audio WA-47jr\n\n3. Directional microphones - Cardioid\n\nCardioid microphones are designed to pick up sound from the front and reject sound from the back of the microphone.\n\nPros :\n\nThey are fantastic for podcasting, be it for a solo cast, pure interview, or mini-group discussions where each person has their microphone.\n\nThe pickup pattern allows you to capture less unwanted noise and produce a cleaner recording.\n\nYou also would not have to worry too much about positioning the microphone perfectly to capture your voice, given that there is some leeway for sound pickup even if you are not angled 0Âº at the front of the microphone.Â\n\nAdditionally, cardioid microphones supposedly pick up less echo in rooms with many echoes. Hereâs more information on mics for rooms with an echo, if you are interested.\n\nCon:\n\nNote that cardioid microphones can still make background noise if the surrounding environment is relatively noisy.\n\nExamples: Audio-Technica AT2020, Rode PodMic, Shure SM7B\n\n4. Directional microphones - Hyper-cardioid (mini shotgun)\n\nHyper-cardioid microphones are designed to reject more sound from the side than a cardioid and pick up slightly more sound from the back of the microphone. They are also known as âmini shotguns.â\n\nPros:Â\n\nThey are also great for podcasting.\n\nThe pickup pattern minimizes unwanted sound capture.\n\nYou also would not have to worry too much about positioning the microphone perfectly to capture your voice, as there is still some leeway for sound pickup even if you are not angled at 0Âº at the front of the microphone.\n\nCon:\n\nHyper-cardioids supposedly capture more echo than cardioid microphones. Thus consider going for a cardioid microphone instead if you will be recording in spaces that potentially have a lot of echoes.\n\nExamples: Audio-Technica AT4053b, Neumann KM185, Audix D4\n\n5. Directional microphones - Super-cardioid\n\nSuper-cardioid microphones are similar to hyper-cardioids, with a narrower pickup from the front.\n\nPros:\n\nThey deliver excellent audio quality for podcasting.\n\nYou can stand farther away from the microphone and still get good sound quality.\n\nCons:\n\nThey are unforgiving if positioned incorrectly. You must position the microphone accurately, such that you speak straight into the front of the microphone, 0Âº on-axis.\n\nIt may be challenging to start with a microphone with this pickup pattern, as there is little room for error.\n\nExamples: Shure BETAÂ® 58A, Sennheiser e 845, AKG D5\n\n6. Directional microphones - Lobar/shotgun\n\nLobar microphones are the extremes of hyper-cardioid and super-cardioid microphones. They pick up the most sound from the front and reject sound from the sides. Although the lobar pattern illustrates multiple sensitive lobes, it is a unidirectional pattern with the greatest sensitivity 0Âº on-axis.Â\n\nLobar microphones also use interference tubes that use phase cancellation, which help to reject more sound from the sides, narrowing the pickup pattern. Lobar microphones are also known as âshotgun microphones.â\n\nPros:\n\nThe best for focusing on specific sounds and blocking out unwanted ambient noises.\n\nThey are often used in film and television, mounted on boom and camera poles.\n\nCons:\n\nHowever, they require skilled operators to capture good sound, as you must directly point the microphone at the subject.\n\nThere is little room for error. The pickup pattern is the least forgiving of them all.\n\nExamples: Rode NTG-2, Audio-Technica AT897, Sennheiser MKH 60\n\nMicrophones with multiple pickup settings: multi-pattern microphones\n\nSome microphones even have multiple polar pickup patterns, depending on what pattern you choose. You can switch to your desired pickup pattern for multi-pattern microphones, which changes the areas surrounding the microphone that it picks up audio from.\n\nExamples: Blue Yeti, HyperX QuadCast, Shure KSM\n\nOur recommendation\n\nConsidering that you probably do not have a full team with a boom operator, a sound recordist and an audio engineer, we recommend the following:\n\nOnly capturing speech, without background noise: Cardioid microphone\n\nCapturing speech together with background noise: Omni-directional microphone\n\nMultiple modes of recording (e.g. speech in a quiet room and background noise in a public setting): Multi-pattern microphone\n\nHere are the links to our other recommendations on the types of microphones:\n\nRecommendations â Dynamic vs. condenser microphone\n\nRecommendations â USB vs. XLR microphone\n\n(B) Category - Dynamic vs. condenserÂ\n\nNext, we move on to another critical distinction between microphones: dynamic microphones and condenser microphones.\n\nDynamic microphones and condenser microphones capture sounds differently.\n\nOne rejects background noises well, and the other does not.\n\nSo, should you go for a dynamic microphone or a condenser microphone?\n\nDynamic microphones\n\nA dynamic microphone has a wire coil that amplifies signals picked up by the microphoneâs diaphragm. The output signal is much lower from a dynamic microphone compared to a condenser microphone.\n\nPros:Â\n\nDynamic microphones reject background noises very well.Â\n\nThey are perfect if you will record in spaces where there may be ambient or distracting noises, such as your bedroom or office.\n\nThey are also great at capturing loud and strong sounds.\n\nA power source is not required.\n\nCon:\n\nNot as sensitive to quiet, delicate, or high-frequency sounds as condenser microphones.\n\nExamples: Audio-Technica ATR2100x, Samson Q2U, Rode Procaster\n\nCondenser microphones\n\nA condenser microphone has a lightweight diaphragm suspended by a plate, which moves when sound waves pressure the diaphragm. Condenser microphones require either a battery or phantom power (power supply) to work.Â\n\nThe audio mixer/audio interface usually supplies phantom power. For instance, take a look at the Audient ID4 audio interface where a â+48Vâ button powers a condenser microphone when connected.\n\nPros:Â\n\nCondenser microphones capture delicate sounds and high frequencies very well.\n\nSuitable for use in quiet spaces such as studios.\n\nCons:\n\nThey are more sensitive than dynamic microphones, and they tend to capture more background noise.\n\nA power source is required.\n\nâExamples: Blue Snowball, Audio-Technica AT2035PK, Neumann TLM102\n\nOur recommendation\n\nRecording in a noisy environment, and intending on reducing background noise: Dynamic microphoneâ\n\nCapturing very delicate sounds within a quiet setting: Condenser microphone\n\nHere are the links to our other recommendations on the types of microphones:\n\nRecommendations â Polar pickup patternâ\n\nRecommendations â USB vs. XLR microphone\n\n(C) Connection â USB mics vs. XLR mics\n\nThe last technical detail that you need to look at is whether you want a microphone with a USB connection or an XLR connection.\n\nThe connection type can alter the quality of sound that you would get from a recording.\n\nThe connection type would also determine whether you would need another external device, to send the captured audio signals to your computer.\n\nShould you get a USB microphone or an XLR microphone?\n\nUSB microphones\n\nUSB microphones are microphones with a USB connection output. USB microphones have a built-in analog-to-digital converter, converting analog sound waves to digital signals for your computer to process. This means that a separate dedicated device (an audio interface) is not required, as seen in the above section on how âSome microphones perform the analog-to-digital conversion.â\n\nPros:\n\nUSB microphones are plug-and-play, allowing you to plug the microphone into your computer and begin recording quickly.\n\nA separate dedicated device (an audio interface) is not required.\n\nGiven that a separate external audio interface is not required, they are also convenient to carry around, mainly if you often record in different locations and travel with your gear.\n\nGreat if you are looking for the easiest and most hassle-free method to record your podcast.\n\nUSB microphones could be a good option if you are budget-conscious, as they are generally cheaper than XLR microphones.Â\n\nCon:\n\nYou can normally only record with one USB microphone connected to a computer at a time. They thus are not suitable for recording multiple participants on-premise.\n\nExamples: Blue Yeti, Samson Go, Rode Podcaster, Rode NT-USB\n\nRelated article: Best USB Microphones to Buy in 2021 [Podcasting & Recording]\n\nXLR microphones\n\nXLR microphones are microphones with an XLR connection output. XLR microphones are dedicated microphones that record analog audio sounds. They do not have a built-in analog-to-digital converter.\n\nXLR microphones thus require a separate device called an audio interface, as seen in the above section on how âExternal devices can perform the analog-to-digital conversion.â\n\nA 3-pin XLR connector, the most common for podcasting XLR microphones, carries balanced audio and is grounded. There is also a spring lock, ensuring that the XLR connector fits tightly into the plughole of the microphone. This reduces static to a minimum, and you would generally get less static than a USB microphone (assuming that everything else is the same).\n\nPros:\n\nXLR microphones generally offer better sound quality than USB microphones, as a dedicated audio interface performs the audio conversion.\n\nDue to the nature of the connection type and the spring lock, you would usually get less static than a USB microphone.Â\n\nGreat for all types of recording. You can record both a solo cast and episodes with multiple participants recording on-premise. For the latter, you will need a multi-channel audio interface.\n\nYou can host a live podcast and adjust your audio EQ on the fly, using an XLR microphone with an audio mixer and an audio interface. This makes XLR mics ideal as live streaming microphones.\n\nCon:\n\nThey are generally more expensive than USB microphones.\n\nExamples: Audio-Technica ATR2100x (also has a USB connection), Samson Q2U, Shure SM7B\n\nRelated article: XLR Microphones: The Best Ones for Podcasters of All Levels\n\nHow about other types of connections?\n\nApart from USB and XLR connections, there are indeed other connections such as TRS and TRRS (such as the one found on the omnidirectional Rode smartLav+).\n\nSo why arenât we talking about TRS or TRRS connections in this article?\n\nTRS and TRRS connections tap onto the analog-to-digital converter of your computer. This is something you generally want to avoid. Such connections will typically give you lower sound quality than using a USB microphone with a built-in analog-to-digital converter or an XLR microphone paired with an audio interface.Â\n\nTherefore, most microphones suitable for most podcasts feature USB or XLR connections.\n\nOur recommendation\n\nIf you are starting and may scale in the future:\n\nMicrophone with both USB and XLR connections + audio interface in the future. Our tried-and-tested favorites are the Audio-Technica ATR2100x and the Samson Q2U.Â\n\nThese two microphones are relatively affordable and perfect for growing into your podcasting career. With both a USB and XLR connection, you can use the same microphone should you upgrade from a USB setup to an XLR + audio interface setup. Sweet deal!\n\nIf budget is your concern: Microphone with both USB and XLR connections + audio interface in the future (optional)\n\nThe Audio Technica ATR2100x and the Samson Q2U retail for under $100. Awesome!\n\nIf you want a microphone that gives you outstanding audio quality:\n\nXLR microphone + audio interfaceÂ\n\nIf you mainly care about the portability of the microphone:\n\nUSB microphone\n\nIf you are recording with multiple participants on-premise:\n\nXLR microphone + multi-channel audio interface\n\nIf you are recording a live podcast and need an excellent streaming microphone:\n\nXLR microphone + audio mixer (optional depending on whether you want to adjust your EQ) + audio interface\n\nHere are the links to our other recommendations on the types of microphones:\n\nRecommendations â Polar pickup pattern\n\nRecommendations â Dynamic vs. condenser microphone\n\nHow to use a podcast microphone\n\nWhen using a podcast microphone there are a few pointers you should know about before recording.Â\n\nSetting up your microphone:Â\n\nYouâll want to make sure thereâs as little background noise as possible in the location youâll be recording in. When setting up your microphone youâll also have to connect it directly to your computer or through an audio interface, depending on your connection type. Youâll also want to connect your microphone to your recording software, which is easy to do if youâre using a platform like Riverside.\n\nPositioning your microphone:\n\nPositioning your microphone correctly can make a huge difference when it comes ot recording. Firstly, youâll want the microphone at a comfortable distance. Itâs best to actually speak closer to the microphone, around an inch away and you may want to angle your microphone a little to the side to avoid harsh plosives ruining your sound.\n\nHow do you use an external microphone for a remote podcast or a remote interview?\n\nWhat if you want to record a remote podcast where your podcast participants are located in different locations? Can you use any microphone for that? How will the video podcast platform detect the microphone you think best fits your purpose?\n\nThis depends on your video podcast software.\n\nAnd at Riverside, we get you.\n\nWe want you to be able to not only find the microphone that suits your purpose but be able to use it for all your podcasting purposes, including remote podcasts. That is why we have created our platform, which allows you to record remote podcasts with any microphone compatible with your computer.\n\nThe Riverside.fm platform automatically uses the default microphone of your computer. You can also switch between microphones directly within the dashboard when recording. Thus you can easily use your external microphone if it is plugged into your computer, even if it is not your default microphone.\n\nAgain, just make sure that your microphone or audio interface is compatible with your computer! You can even do a podcast microphone test to check everything is working.\n\nIt is as simple as that!Â\n\nFAQs on Podcast Microphones\n\nWhat is the best microphone for talking?\n\nConsidering podcasting is all about talking, any of the microphones recommended above could be great for voice or talking use cases. From our list of the best podcast microphones, these are some options for the best mics for talking:\n\nBlue Yeti\n\nRODE PodMic\n\nAudio-Technica AT2040\n\nElectro-Voice RE20\n\nShure MV7\n\nIs there a microphone that makes your voice sound better?\n\nWhile a microphone canât change your actual voice, the way you position and use it will make a huge impact on the quality of sound you record. Your micâs sensitivity and pick-up accuracy will also impact how recordings come out and this can certainly improve your voice recordings. Again, this wonât change your actual voice but how and what you use to capture sound can make your recordings clearer and crisper.\n\nWhat mic is best for two-person podcast?\n\nIdeally, itâs best to use one microphone per person, but if you do happen to use one microphone to record a two-person podcast your sound doesnât have to suffer. A popular option for a podcast microphone for multiple voices is the Blue Yeti. This is because itâs multi-directional and you can adjust it to record in the polar pattern that you need. That being said, not everyone would suggest this mic, but you can read our Blue Yeti review to find out more.\n\nAre shotgun mics good for podcasts?\n\nShotgun microphones can definitely be used for podcasting as theyâre extreme cardioid microphones and limit background noises being picked up. This makes them suitable for voice recording use cases such as podcasting."
