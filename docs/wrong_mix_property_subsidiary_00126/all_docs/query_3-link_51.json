        "text": "When most people think about making videos they think that they’re going to need a lot of fancy equipment and that it’s going to be expensive. And this is where many folks get hung up. It just seems all too daunting to figure out what equipment to buy and then learn how to use all that gear.\n\nIt doesn’t have to be that way…\n\nI love making videos and I have fancy cameras and lots of gear. But these days I shoot everything on my iphone and I use the four basic tools that I’m sharing with you in this guide.\n\nAnd it all fits easily in my messenger bag so I’m ready to shoot wherever I go.\n\nHere’s my keep-it-simple video gear list to get you shooting awesome video without spending a ton of money:\n\nMovo Smartphone Video Rig with Mini Tripod, Grip Handle and Shotgun Microphone – Cost: $89.95\n\n1. This Smartphone Video Rig comes with a cute little shotgun microphone and is a must-have if you love making high quality videos. The mini shotgun mike dramatically improves your sound quality. It hears the sound that’s in front of the microphone while rejecting sound from the rear and sides making it especially useful when recording in a location with background noise. It’s really compact letting you carry this rig with you wherever you go. (to conferences and networking events). And the wind screen will allow you to record outdoors on windy days.\n\n2. The great little Tripod has a rotating ball head for easy adjustment and extends to 16 in height. It’s light-weight and fits nicely in your messenger bag making for easy and fast set-up.\n\n3. The Phone Grip works as a tripod mount and camera grip that will hold both your smartphone and microphone safely and tightly. Ideal for avid smartphone videomakers, it even has a built in level to make sure your shot is even.\n\nAlready have your own tripod? Here’s the same kit without the mini tripod:\n\nMovo Smartphons Video Rig with Grip Handle and Shotgun Microphone – Cost: $52.95\n\n4. Wide Angle Lens – Cost $17.99\n\nThis wide angle lens is super helpful when you’re shooting in a tight space and you need to show more, or when you’re interviewing a guest and you want to easily get the two of you in the same shot. You just clip the lens right onto your smartphone and it will give you a really wide angle shot.\n\nWhen you’re doing an interview, the lens gives such a wide view so that you can still be an arms-length from your phone, and hold it selfie-style, but now you’ll have lots of space in the shot for both you and your guest to talk to each other.\n\nIf you’re walking around with your phone and you’re wanting to give your viewers a tour of what’s going on around you, the wide angle lens is a great tool for showing everything in your background. It’s particularly good for indoor spaces because it can help show an entire room.\n\n1. Lightweight 60″ Tripod – Cost: $25.99\n\nThis lightweight tripod has adjustable-height legs and rubber feet and is compatible with most video cameras, digital cameras, still cameras, GoPro devices, and smartphone mounts.\n\n2. Best Budget Soft Light – Cost: $44.99\n\nProbably the best deal on a small, portable soft light for vlogging and live streaming. This light has a very thin profile allowing you to carry it anywhere and comes with battery and charger.\n\n3. Movo Lavalier Microphone – Cost: $39.95\n\nUsing a good external microphone is essential to creating good video. Your sound is as important as your image! This simple lav microphone plugs right into your phone and lets you get great sound when you’re positioned away from your camera. The kit comes with two microphones which will allow you to do interviews with a guest. It even comes with a separate plugin for earbuds so you can monitor your sound and make sure the audio is working.\n\n4. Extension Cord – Cost $12.95\n\nYou can attach this cord between your microphone and your smartphone which will let you (and your interview guest) sit well away from your phone without feeling crowded. This is really helpful if you want to move at all while you’re shooting and really gives you plenty of freedom.\n\nAs soon as you’re equipped with these simple tools, join my FREE Video Creators Lab group on Facebook where you can post your smartphone videos, see what others are posting and give and receive positive feedback.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/groups/videocreatorslab/"
