The event of the week is, of course, the opening of the Genoa Conference, upon which the hopes of the world—perhaps the fears and doubts of the world also—are just now directed. The opening address by Lloyd George, certainly the most picturesque and prominent if not the most influential personage of the time, was worthy of the occasion and of himself, not only in the thought and the fitness of the thought but in the vigor and the telling quality of the lan­ guage. He lias been called a compromiser and deft at avoidance, but he has been and is a pacificator, whatever else be said of him ; and while fundamental principles must be maintained, at whatever present cost, because otherwise no permanent good is possi­ ble, it is immovably true that agreement and peace require some compromise, and when men are at one another’s throats and each demanding that another shall give way, they can be brought together only on some common ground, and such ground can be reached only by some yielding on non-fundamental points. This was the keynote of Lloyd George’s address. We are here, he said, not as belligerents or as neu­ trals, but to find methods by which each may rebuild in his own country; but if we meet on equal terms we must accept equal conditions. Said he: “What is the first need of Europe ? Peace—a real peace. We propose to study the currency—good. We propose to examine the question of exchanges, and that is good. We propose to discuss transporta­ tion and credit, and that also is good. But unless Electric Railway Section State and City Section NO. 2964 peace is established and good-will among nations, all these discussions will be of no avail; on the other hand, if real peace is the issue of this conference all those things will be added unto you.” It does not require a prophet to say such obvious and immovably true things, but it requires a strong man to give them force in the saying. All he said of the “snarling dogs” and the many in every country that think they make an impression according to their noise is true. This is distracting, as be said; it rattles the nerves of a nerve-racked continent, and any real contribution to peace in Europe turns upon stopping the snarlers. Behind conferees lies public opinion, a “common restriction,” but public opinion is not rigid like a mountain range; “it is amenable to guidance, to direction, to reason and conscience,” and he expressed confidence that it will yield much to a right appeal which teaches “that the good of another country is not necessarily evil for one’s own, but that which benefits all lands must needs be best for one’s own.” For the world “is one economic unit,” and while he recognized the caution of this country in not intervening boldly in the European job he regrets America’s absence and hopes Genoa may render an­ other immortal service by rediscovering Europe to us here. This Conference was meant to be, and in order to have great reconstructive value it must be, a Gettogether meeting. Lloyd George indicated funda­ mental conditions very clearly, as th at: when a coun­ try assumes obligations for value received it cannot repudiate them whenever it changes its governmen­ tal form; no country “can wage war on the institu­ tions of another” or “engage in aggressive operations against the territory of another,” and nations must have “impartial justice in one another’s courts.” Any people who reject these elementary conditions of civ­ ilized intercourse cannot expect “to be received into the comity of nations.” This is as certain as that whoever delivers only blows and scowls cannot win welcome and smiles. A press dispatch of Wednesday says that Lloyd George “is expected to propose” a pact that no nation shall attack another, “thus abol­ ishing the possibility of war.” This was conveyed in his opening address. War arises in the war spirit, and as that fades from the world all need of peace compacts will cease; meanwhile, right conduct is doubtless somewhat aided by right resolutions. Snarling, quarreling—the recalcitrants are here, as elsewhere. All they who demand that their indi­ vidual suffering from war and after-war conditions shall be relieved, by shifting to others’ shoulders (the only immediate method and even that ineffectual) are in the snarl class. Our various blocs—agricul­ tural, ex-service men who are willihg to be mercena­ ries and nothing better, unionized workers who in* 1576 THE CHRONICLE [V ol. 114. in January and a further decrease of more than 300 suspensions from the February figures having ap­ peared in March. In February of this year there is a decrease from January, but in March the number was only 260 less than the high record for January and actually 130 larger than in February. Of the total for March, 563 defaults, with liabili­ ties of $23,522,390, were classified as manufacturing concerns; 1,761, with liabilities of $27,884,251, as trading concerns, and 139, with liabilities of $20,201,­ 551, as agents and brokers. In March of last year there were 298 failures, with liabilities of $16,945,­ 691, of manufacturing enterprises, 951 trading fail­ ures, with liabilities of $25,394,954, and 87 classed as agents and brokers, having liabilities of $25,468,­ 264.

What else are all peo­ ple doing, the world over, who set their own selfish­ ness in the way of the general rebuilding by which alone there can be any real restoration? The world needs peace, but that is only a sham peace which does not put energy and heart into industry; stimulate production, and bring relief through abundance in­ stead of quarreling over the division of what there is. When Lloyd George went to Genoa he left behind him people who need to take home his beckoning words. We wish his address could be read by every person on this unhappy and quarrel-rent globe, and that each would take it home to himself instead of discovering its application to somebody else. A pril 15 1922.] THE CHRONICLE than 80% over the corresponding three months of 1921. The number of these defaults in the Central Eastern section this year is 1,41G, while the number in the Central Western section for the same period is only 742. In 1921 the commercial defaults in the South were unusually numerous, the percentage of increase over 1920 in the Southern States being larger than for the other groups, and for the first quarter of this year commercial defaults at the South show a further increase, but of only 43% over the fig­ ures for the corresponding three months of 1921, whereas for the entire country the increase this year is 54%. As to the amount of indebtedness involved in these defaults, the losses in the Central Eastern section, including Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, etc., were very heavy, the total of all liabilities of the defaults in these five States for the first three months of this year being $41,667,472. About G0% of this aggregate of defaulted indebtedness was in the two States of Ohio and Illinois. In no other States in the country, with the exception of New York and Pennsylvania, is the aggregate of defaulted indebtedness for the first three months of this year so great as that re­ ported for Ohio and Illinois. Banking defaults this year to date also make an unfavorable comparison, 94 such failures, for $27,­ 073,782 for the first quarter of 1922 contrasting with 83 banking failures in the first three months of 1921, with a total indebtedness of $23,288,GS9. Most of these suspensions were of small banks in a number of the States at the South and Southwest, and in the States west of the Mississippi River. 1577 and Signor Schanzer my gratitude for their abnega­ tion in preparing this Conference, even when it was uncertain that it would occur. It is impossible to predict exactly what will be accomplished. The day’s conferences are as uncertain as the day’s human life. Nobody can tell what the morrow will bring forth. But one thing is certain, we have come here to work with all energy. and earnestness, not to waste any time in amusements. On one point I am sure all the delegations are in accord, that is, to reach agree­ ments which will prevent renewal of international conflicts, thus re-establishing general peace and re­ ciprocal confidence between the States on a basis of economic prosperity.” Speaking somewhat figuratively relative to the prominent part that Lloyd George was expected to play, even from the*, very beginning, a special corre­ spondent of the New York “Times” at Genoa said: “To-morrotv at 3 o’clock begins Mr. Lloyd George’s great effort to get Europe back to normalcy. To the sunshine of the ancient city of Genoa, where the Brit­ ish Premier has .set. up his clinic, the nations of the continent have brought their ills. He is expected to tell his patients of his proposed remedies when he gets them lined up to-morrow. His^ advice for the cure of their financial sicknesses will be given in the building which housed the first bank the world ever had—St. George’s Palace.” . t' It became known at the preliminary gathering of delegates held ofl Sunday that Premier Facta of Italy\" would serve as President of the conference and that Premier Lloyd George would make the first address following that of introduction by the President. The representative of the New York “Herald” added that “the idea of Premier Lloyd George is to restore the concert of Europe. The idea of Premier Poincare is to avoid isolation. Both ideas have a clear right of way for hard work by the financial and economic commissions before any of the several delicate poli­ tical problems are. tackled.” The French delegation was reported to have admitted that in their judgment “the Russian problem towered over all other matters in importance, in the belief the rehabilitation of Rus­ sia was imperative if Europe and the world would be restored to what President Harding has called nor­ malcy.” The Russian representatives were said to have resented being quartered at Rapallo, fifteen miles from Genoa* and to have urged the Italian au­ thorities to give them quarters in the latter city, “even if it was only two rooms, so that they might be in close touch with affairs.” They succeeded in hav­ ing an interview with Premier Facta during the day. George Tchitcherin was reported to have told the Premier “in the most emphatic terms that despite the incomplete! advantages of scenic observation of­ fered from the balconies and verandas of the hotel that faces the blue .Mediterranean, the Bolsheviki want to be nearer Genoa.” The Genoa Economic Conference began its sessions at 3 o’clock on Monday afternoon. The cable advices from the leading European centres over the week-end seemed to indicate that the different delegations, with the exception of the Russian, were displaying an encouraging attitude toward the gathering and the most important problems to be considered. The hopeful feeling regarding the outcome of the deliber­ ations began on Friday of last week following the in­ terview between Premier Lloyd George and Premier Poincare in Paris. The Associated Press said that the former declared before leaving the French capi­ tal for Genoa that “the French and British delega­ tions to the Genoa Conference are going to work to­ gether with a determination to make that gathering, which opens Monday, a success.” • Dr. Walter Rathenau, Foreign Minister of Ger­ many, was quoted as follows by the Berlin corre­ spondent ol the New York “Times” regarding his at­ titude toward the Genoa Conference: “I go to Genoa with good-will, but little hope—and yet with hopes lor a later time. For even if Genoa proves entirely negative, if nothing comes of Genoa, it still will yield two vitally important results. It will prove that world reconstruction is impossible without tackling Germany’s reparations problem and it will prove that world reconstruction is impossible without America’s active help.” The first cable accounts of the opening of the Con­ Upon arriving in Genoa the British Premier ex­ ference, received here Monday afternoon, stated that pressed himself in greater detail regarding his ideas there were present 157 delegates representing 34 na­ for the Conference and what he was determined to tions.

I have expressed to Signor Facta ^throwing a monkey wrench into the machinery” of 1578 THE CHRONICLE the Conference at the very start. It seems that he made a speech in which he suggested the discussion of land disarmament. The New York “Herald” cor­ respondent declared that he “nearly became the Hughes of the Genoa Conference,” but added that “he did not, as did Secretary Hughes in Washington, be­ gin with a definite offer of sacrifice by his own Gov­ ernment. In fact, his reference to disarmament con­ sisted of the simple statement that there was a de­ mand for it, and the Conference had better discuss it.” The correspondent also observed “but that ref­ erence sufficed to set off Louis Bar thou, the French Minister of Justice and head of the French delega­ tion, who was on his feet as soon as M. Tchitcherin had finished, emphatically announcing that France under no circumstances would permit the discussion of disarmament in plenary or committee or sub-com­ mittee sessions.” Barthou declared that “the pro­ gram of what was not on the agenda and what was on the agenda had to be observed.” M. Tchitcherin re­ plied in his quiet manner that Russia knew what France's position on disarmament was. M. Briand at the Washington Conference, he said, had justified French armaments by saying that “Russia's arma­ ments had made disarmament impossible.” M. Tchitcherin was reported to have added that “we hope by open discussion to be able to allay French suspicion. Russia must have disarmament, and knows it.” Premier Lloyd George endeavored to “ex­ ercise a soothing influence. He opposed the addition of disarmament to the agenda. He likened the Con­ ference to a heavily laden ship. To overload it was to sink it; and he felt there already was plenty of work for the present Conference.” The Premier in his speech, as already noted in the former paragraphs of this article, said that “the fighting has ceased in Europe, but the snarl goes on. The greatest contribution we can make to reconstruc­ tion is to stop the snarl.” In outlining the conditions under which the delegates had assembled and the purposes that they should hold constantly in view the Prime Minister said : “We meet on equal terms, provided we accept equal conditions. We are not here as Allied and enemy States; we are not here as belligerents or neutrals; we have not come together as Monarchists or Republicans or Sovietists. We are assembled as the representatives of all the nations and peoples of Europe to seek out in common the best methods for restoring the shattered prosperity of this continent. So may each build up in his own land each in his own way, a better condition of things for the people than the world has yet enjoyed. But if we meet on terms of equality it must be because we ac­ cept equal conditions.” In concluding his speech, Mr. Lloyd George declared “the world will follow our deliberations with alternate hopes and fears. If wc fail, there will be a sense of despair which will sweep over the whole world; if we succeed, a ray of confidence will illuminate the gloom which is rest­ ing on the spirit of mankind.” [V ol. 114. come here to act. We are not onlookers; we are col­ laborators, ready to take our part in the common la­ bors and responsibilities. We are not indeed blind to the difficulties and obstacles of our task, nor to the amount of time it must take. But pessimists are impotent to stop faith; and active faith can alone save the world.” Before adjournment was taken on Monday “four commissions were appointed to handle Conference affairs.” It was announced that “no further public session will be held for several days.” Foreign Minister Tchitcherin of the Russian Gov­ ernment appears to have made himself prominent, and not a little troublesome and obnoxious from the beginning of the Conference. Reference has been made already to the commotion that he caused by bringing up the question of disarmament. At a meet­ ing Tuesday afternoon of the principal conference committee, “which is to consider Russian affairs,” lie protested against the presence of the Rumanian and Japanese delegates, “because Rumania was oc­ cupying Bessarabia and Japan was occupying por­ tions of Siberia.” The Associated Press correspond­ ent cabled that “Premier Facta of Italy, who was presiding over the committee, declined to consider the Russian protest, giving as his reason that all the countries invited to the Conference had a right to be represented on its committees.” Viscount Isliii, rep­ resenting Japan, was quoted as saying “Japan is here and will stay here whether M. Tchitcherin likes it or not.” The correspondent added that “admission of Russian and German representatives to the prin­ cipal committee was opposed by both French and Belgian representatives. Premier Lloyd George, with Premier Facta and Foreign Minister Schanzer of Italy, intervened. Their conciliatory attitude fi­ nally resulted in the admittance of both the Russians and the Germans.” As the days advanced it became increasingly evi­ dent that the Russian delegation, under the leader­ ship of M. Tchitcherin, was likely to make trouble al­ most constantly for Premier Lloyd George and the French representatives. Commenting upon the situ­ ation in a long cablegram to his paper Tuesday even­ ing a special correspondent of the New York “Times” observed that “twenty-four hours of the Genoa Con­ ference have shown that Mr. Lloyd George's primal task is to create an atmosphere in which economic problems may be discussed with a prospect of suc­ cess. Mr. Lloyd George breathes forth that atmos­ phere. No one else yet does. Can he make it gen­ eral ? The first public session yesterday showed that at the start the Genoa Economic Conference was al­ most saturated with the poison of national selfish­ ness and national fear. To-day's exhibition showed about the same thing. Yesterday France made trou­ ble for Mr. Lloyd George. That was expected. But to-day the Russians, who every one thought would be so grateful to be allowed to sit here, showed a trou­ blesome spirit. They snarled at Japan, asking that Nippon be excluded from the Conference. They tried to put out the Rumanians—both because of nation­ alistic reasons. They tried to get double representa­ tion on the steering committee and generally took what even Mr. Lloyd George regards as an uppish attitude.” Barring the Tchitcherin incident, it was generally agreed that the Conference made a good start. The Associated Press representative said that “general acceptance of the definite principle of the Cannes resolutions makes certain that the deliberations will continue, with every prospect of success.” Louis Bar­ thou, head of the French delegation, set forth In a cablegram Wednesday morning the Berlin France’s position in part as follows: “We have representative of the New York “Times” said that A pril 15 1922.] THE CHRONICLE “Premier Lloyd George is hailed as the ‘conqueror of the Genoa Conference’ by the German press, re­ gardless of party. Every German correspondent at Genoa telegraphed or telephoned that ‘Lloyd George saved the Conference,’ and the editors at this end did . the rest.” On Tuesday in Genoa there was handed to M. Tchitcherin, head of the Russian delegation, a copy of a report prepared by the Allied experts that have met in London in recent weeks, “relative to a pro­ gram for the restoration of Russia and of Europe generally.” Tchitcherin asked for two days “to study the preamble.” An outline of the report will be found on a subsequent page in our department of Current Events and Discussion. The very next day the Associated Press represen­ tative cabled that “the Russian Soviet delegation to the Economic Conference is staggered at the sweep­ ing political changes in the Soviet Government sug­ gested in the report of the Allied experts on Russia, now before the sub-commission intrusted with for­ mulating plans for Russian reconstruction. Lenin, Trotzky, Tchitcherin and other of the Bolshevik lead­ ers have repeatedly said that the recognition of Rus­ sia’s old debts would be a subject for negotiations looking towards the recognition of the Soviet Re­ public. The demands embodied in the report for gen­ eral recognition of the rights of personal property and better protection for foreigners contemplate changes in the Soviet Government, however, which would, in the opinion of the Russian delegation, as expressed to-day, wipe out communism utterly and impair the sovereignty of the Russian Government. George Tchitcherin, head of the Russian delegation, has asked Signor Schanzer, as Chairman of the prin­ cipal sub-commission, for exact interpretation of sev­ eral points in the plan for the restoration of Russia.” Evidently the Allied Premiers have experienced not a little difficulty in confining the discussions at the Conference to the program laid down at Cannes. The Associated Press correspondent said Thursday evening that “the one fact that stood out in Confer­ ence circles to-day was that neither the disarmament nor reparations question would be brought up for specific action against the opposition of France. The disarmament discussion has centred in the rumor that Prime Minister Lloyd George would propose a military holiday for a fixed time. This was flatly disavowed this afternoon by members of the British delegation.” It was reported in Genoa the same day that both Nikolai Lenin, Soviet Premier, and Ray­ mond Poincare, French Premier, were coming to the Conference in the near future. According to the re­ port, Lenin “will replace George Tchitcherin as head of the Russian delegation when the negotiations at the Conference reach the proper stage.” In a cable­ gram yesterday morning, the Genoa correspondent of the New York “Times” outlined still further the difficulties of dealing with the Russian delegation already there. He said that “the Russians are mak­ ing most difficult the effort to help them. The Rus­ sian delegation, brought here to listen to the condi­ tions under which other countries would aid Russia, have, instead of contenting themselves with the study of proposals offered, attempted to put forward for the benefit of the world cures for all the ills of all na­ tions, which projects are, of course, worthless, both because of their nature and their origin. It will be a 1579 tremendous task to bring the Russian delegation to realize just where it is.” The position of the Allied leaders was set forth as follows by the Associated Press representative: “The ‘Big Four,’ Lloyd George, Barthou, Schanzer and Jaspar, have decided at a meeting to present a ‘united front’ when the Soviet submits its counter-propositions for the restoration of Russia. This action is understood to imply for­ mal acceptance by the four Powers of the London ex­ perts’ report as a basis for the treatment of the Rus­ sian problem. The allied Governments had not pre­ viously pledged themselves as bound by the report of their experts drawn up at London.” According to a Genoa dispatch last evening “divergencies of opin­ ion” developed at a conference of the “Big Four” ear­ lier in the day over the Russian problem. This re­ port was said to have been confirmed by the Italian delegates. Word came from Paris Tuesday morning that the reply of the German Government‘'to the latest Allied demands relative to reparations had been received. It was asserted that “the demand for Allied control of German finances, as well as for the creation of new taxes amounting to 60,000,000,000 marks, was definitely refused.'” The note added that “the Ger­ man Government is prepared to furnish the Repara­ tions Commission with any information it may re­ quire on the situation and on the financial operations carried on in Germany. No Government, however, could allow a foreign country to exercise any definite influence on the creation and application of legisla­ tive measures.” In further setting forth its position, the German Government declared that “the new re­ quirements, moreover, are physically impossible of execution. This is especially true with regard to the new taxes exceeding the fiscal compromise by sixty billions.” According to a Paris cablegram to the New York “Times” Thursday morning “the Repara­ tions Commission has decided to temporize with re­ gard to the German refusal to carry out its previous instructions. The Commission met twice to-day [Wednesday] informally in the morning and for­ mally this afternoon. In the morning’s meeting there was discussion of two alternatives, first, to do nothing for the present; second, to send a non-com­ mittal reply indicating that no definite decision will be taken until May 31. At the afternoon meeting it was decided to follow the latter and send a note couched in firm language, informing Germany she has until the end of May to obey the Allied instruc­ tions.” The New York “Herald” representative at the same centre presented the position of the Com­ mission in quite a different light. He said that “Ger­ many’s effort to balk the Reparations Commission’s demands for payment by seeking the decision of neu­ tral nations on her capacity to pay met an early death this afternoon when the Commission decided to reject the German counter proposals. A note to that effect will be drawn up to-morrow and will de­ mand again the immediate acceptance or refusal to meet the Allies’ requirements in its note of Mar. 21 for budget reforms and financial control by an Allied commission, according to the statement of a high of­ ficial of the Commission this afternoon.” He further stated that “for the time being and until May 31 the moratorium idea still governs the German payments, the next of which is due on Saturday and amounts to 18,000,000 marks gold. Fifty millions more must be paid by May 15. Agents of the Reparations Commis- sion in Berlin have reported that Germany is making arrangements to meet the first payment, but is likely to allow the Commission to report to the Allied Gov­ ernments that she has defaulted on the second, simul­ taneously with her default in the Commission’s de­ mands for financial changes, which the Wirth Gov­ ernment apparently has decided it is safe to reject.” In a cablegram from Paris yesterday morning the Associated Press said that “the Reparations Com­ mission to-night [Thursday] adopted the text of a note to Germany informing her that the Commis­ sion’s decisions of Mar. 21, notably as regards pay­ ments to be made until May 31, are maintained, and that if Germany does not take necessary measures to put her finances in order the Commission will be obliged on May 31 to exact penalties.” Griffith and Brugha, respectively, the other parties being the Archbishop, the Lord Mayor and Stephen O’Mara, senior, of Limerick. Once Collins and De Valera are got together with other represeptative men, there is some hope the election battle will be fought without what the Labor Party calls gun and bomb. The Labor Party’s bold protest against such rule did much toward getting Collins and De Valera to accept the Archbishop’s invitation to a confer­ ence.” The National Executive Committee of the Irish Labor Party issued “a strong protest against the reintroduction of military methods in Ireland.” In a cablegram from Dublin to the New York “Times” yesterday morning it was stated that “the anxiously awaited conference between the heads of the Provisional Government and the leaders of the Republican faction took place this afternoon. It Michael Collins, speaking at Wexford a week ago lasted for two and three-quarter hours and resulted to-day, warned of the danger of civil war in Ireland in no agreement. It was not, however, broken off, and appealed to Eamon de Valera to withdraw from and will be resumed next Wednesday.” the course that he has taken since being defeated by his own people.

The Bank’s gold holdings, therefore, now aggregate 5,526,372,950 francs, comparing with 5,505,145,290 francs at this time last year and with 5,585,740,181 francs the year before; of these amounts 1,978,367,056 francs were held abroad in 1922 and 1921 and 1,978,278,416 francs in 1920. Silver dur­ ing the week gained 97,000 francs, Treasury deposits rose 44,050,000 francs and general deposits were augmented by 43,090,000 francs. On the other hand, bills discounted fell off 2,908,000 francs, while advances were reduced 45,531,000 francs. Note cir­ culation took a favorable turn, a contraction of 117,­ 918,000 francs being registered. This brings the total outstanding down to 36,035,467,000 francs, contrasting with 38,528,892,225 francs on the corre­ sponding date last year and with 37,434,293,05Q francs in 1920. In 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, the amount was only 6,683,184,785 francs.

Another, though not quite as sensational, increase was recorded in note circulation, which this week expanded 1,165,897,000 marks. The Bank’s stock of gold on hand now stands at 999,876,000 marks, in comparison with 1,091,519,000 marks last year and 1,091,460,000 marks in 1920. Circulation outstand­ ing has reached the gigantic total of 131,837,249,000 marks. A year ago it stood at 69,235,239,000 marks and in 1920 at 45,617,060,000 marks. The Federal Reserve Bank statement, issued']late on Thursday afternoon, indicated further additions to gold reserves together with a drawing down of bill holdings. For the system as a whole there was a gain in gold of S2,000,000 and a curtailment of re­ discounting operations, both Government paper and “all other,” of 852,000,000. Bill purchases-in the open market fell off 84,700,000, so that total bills on hand were reduced 856,000,000. Total earning assets likewise declined, 86,000,000, and deposits were $1,400,000 lower. The volume of Federal Re­ serve notes in actual circulation was slightly larger, namely $2,000,000. In the New York Bank changes were along similar lines. Gold increased $12,000,000, while rediscounting of Government secured paper was reduced $20,800,000. “All other” fell $400,000. Bills bought in the open market were $2,000,000 smaller. As a result of these operations the volume of bills on hand stands at $101,746,000, or $23,700,­ 000 less than last week. Total earning assets of the local institution are larger by $5,000,000; total de­ posits increased $18,000,000, but Federal Reserve note circulation was reduced $7,700,000. Com­ paratively little change has taken place in the ratios of reserve, which for the combined system stands at 77.7%, the same as last week, and for the local Re­ serve Bank 86.2%, comparing with 86.0% last week. Last week’s statement of New York Clearing House banks and trust companies was in line with general expectations, and, in sharp contrast with the heavy increases of the week preceding, reported declines in loans and deposits. In the former a cut of $8,100,­ 000 was shown, bringing the total of loans and dis­ counts to 84,452,007,000. Net demand deposits fell $12,624,000, to $3,929,309,000, which is exclusive of Government deposits of $53,359,000. Net time de­ posits, however, were larger by $2,601,000, to $270,­ 184,000. Cash in own vaults of members of the Reserve Bank was increased $4,333,000, to $63,718,­ 000 (not counted as reserve). Reserves of State banks and trust companies in own vault gained $39,­ 000, while reserves of the same institutions kept in other depositories expanded $149,000. Reserves of member banks with the Federal Reserve Bank de­ creased $400,000. This in turn, when combined with the decrease in deposits, resulted in a small gain in surplus, namely $1,352,890, thus carrying the total of excess reserves to $14,661,950. The figures here given for surplus are on the basis of 13% reserves above legal requirements for member banks of the Federal Reserve System, but do not include cash in vault amounting to $63,718,000 held by these banks last Saturday. In its statement, issued as of April 7, the Imperial Bank of Germany once more showed radical changes and plainly reflected the abnormal condition of that institution. Huge declines were shown in discount and Treasury bills and deposits, the former being reduced 3,784,433,000 marks and the latter 7,515,­ 627,000 marks. Treasury and loan association notes decreased 1,293,016,000 marks, bills of exchange 41,487,000 marks, and other assets 490,927,000 marks. There were increases in gold o f'2,990,000 Notwithstanding transactions in stocks on the marks, in total coin and bullion of 2,654,000 marks, in notes of other banks of 1,192,000 marks, in Stock Exchange totaled in the neighborhood of 1,- 1582 THE CHRONICLE [Vo** 114. 500,000 shares a day, there were no indications of town institutions appeared to take more interest in higher money in the local market either Monday or the market than for some little time and the expec­ Tuesday.

A pril 15 1922.] THE CHRONICLE 1583 This action is regarded as one of the most important taken since the signing of the Armistice, but will have no influence on American rates except in the event that arbitrage transactions between the United States and Great Britain be undertaken on something like the scale existing in pre-war days. Referring to day-to-day rates, sterling exchange on Saturday of last week was firm and higher, with- an advance to 4 39%@4 41% for demand, 4 40@4 41% for cable transfers and 4 37%@4 39% for sixty days. Trading was not active, but a more hopeful sentiment contributed to the firmness. On Monday the market exhibited increased strength and activity and demand bills again moved up, with the day’s range 4 40%@ 4 42%, while cable transfers were 4 41%@4 42% and sixty days 4 38%@4 40%. A slightly reac­ tionary trend developed on Tuesday and trading fell off sharply; quoted rates covered a range of 4 40%@4 41% for demand, 4 41 1-16@4 41% for cable transfers and 4 38%@4 39% for sixty days. On Wednesday, though transactions continued light, a better undertone was noted, so that demand bills sold up to 4 41 @4 41%, cable transfers to 4 41%@ 4 41%, and sixty days to 4 39@4 39%. Pre­ holiday dulness was the outstanding feature of Thursday’s dealings and quotations were but little changed, demand ruling at 4 40%@4 41%, cable transfers at 4 41 5-16@4 42% and sixty days at 4 38%@4 40%. On Good Friday, which was ob­ served as a religious holiday, business was practically at a standstill and rates, which were largely nominal, ranged between 4 41%@4 41% for demand, 4 41% @4 41% for cable transfers and 4 39% for sixty days. Closing quotations were 4 39% for sixty days, 4 41% for demand and 4 41% for cable transfers. Commer­ cial sight bills finished at 4 34%, sixty days at 4 28%, ninety days at 4 27%, documents for pay­ ment (sixty days) at 4 28%, and seven-day grain bills at 4 34%. Cotton and grain for payment closed at 4 34%. Two consignments of gold were received from Europe this week. There were 10 cases of gold on the France from Havre and $1,587,­ 932 in gold bars and gold marks on the Stockholm from Sweden. Besides this a case of platinum valued at $17,746 arrived on this vessel. From South America the Almagro brought 8 cases of gold, the Bolivar from Colombia 10 gold bars and the General G. W. Goethals from Central America 9 packages of gold and silver and 40 bars of gold and silver. An­ other small consignment, consisting of $227,000 in gold bars, was sent to India last week. This is the third shipment sent to India in the last two months. 12 points above the high of a week ago. Rates on the Central European countries were not materially changed, except for Czechoslovakian currency, which reflected the improvement in financial affairs at that centre by a rise to 2.03, the highest point yet attained, it is claimed, in the brief history of that nation. Trading in Greek drachma practically came to an end this week when several of the largest banks sus­ pended quotations on this currency because of the unfavorable turn in affairs at Athens. It is reported that a crisis in financial affairs has compelled the Government to resort to the flotation of a huge in­ ternal loan; that business is at a standstill owing to the action of the Government and part of the paper money in circulation has been called in to be ex­ changed, so it is claimed, for Government bonds. Because of the forced loan and the existing confusion the Greek Bourse has been closed and' the National Bank of Greece temporarily suspended operation. Following a weak opening, reichsmarks responded to the generally better sentiment and improved fractionally, gaining about 4 points, to 0.35%, but the improvement did not last long and with the news that the Reparations Commission had rejected Ger­ many’s counter proposals regarding financial reforms, the quotation sagged off and closed weak, while Austrian kronen moved in sympathy. Offerings of commercial bills were light, which to some extent exercised a steadying influence, while London during the greater part of the time sent firm quotations. The official London check rate in Paris finished at 47.88, as compared with 48.17 last week. Sight bills on the French centre closed at 9.27%, against 9.12%; cable transfers at 9.28%, against 9.13%; commercial sight at 9.25%, against 9.10%; and commercial sixty days at 9.19%, against 9.04% a week ago. Clos­ ing rates for Antwerp francs were 8.56% for checks and 8.57% for cable transfers, against 8.45 and 8.46. Reichsmarks finished the week at 0.33% for checks, against 0.32% last week, and cable transfers at 0.33%, against 0.33 a week earlier. Austrian kronen closed at 0.0130, against 0.0132%, and cable trans­ fers at 0.0135, against 0.0137 last week. Lire fin­ ished at 5.43 for bankers’ checks and 5.44 for cable transfers, which compares with 5.27% and 5.28% the preceding week. Exchange on Czechoslovakia closed at 2.00, against 1.95; on Bucharest remains at 0.76, unchanged; while Polish checks finished at 0.027, against 0.026, and rates on Finland at 1.94, against 1.95. Greek exchange was heavy and closed at 4.40 for checks and 4.45 for cable transfers, against 4.43 and 4.48 a week ago. In the Continental exchanges also business was extremely dull and featureless, especially toward the latter part of the week, when observance of the religious holiday caused a practical cessation of trading activity. However, so far as price levels were concerned, the market gave a good account of itself and some substantial gains were noted in a number of the leading European currencies, on com­ paratively light transactions. The opening of the Genoa Conference under what was taken to be auspicious conditions, had a favorable sentimental influence and sent quotations for French francs up to 9.29 for checks, an advance of nearly 15 points. Antwerp francs likewise moved forward, advancing about 14 points to 8.62. Lire ruled strong and though movements were somewhat irregular, the quotation subsequently advanced to 5.47, which is As to the former neutral exchanges, there is very little new to report. The selling for German account has apparently subsided for the time being and trading is at a low ebb, with most operators, speculative or otherwise, out of the market for the present. Never­ theless, quotations were well maintained at close to the levels prevailing last week. Bankers’ sight on Amsterdam finished at 37.91, against 37.78; cable transfers at 37.96, against 37.83; commercial sight at 37.86, against 37.73, and com­ mercial sixty days at 37.50, against 37.37 a week ago. Swiss francs closed the week at 19.40% for bankers’ sight bills and 19.45% for cable remittances. -This compares with 19.39% and 19.44% the previous week. Copenhagen checks finished at 21.30 and cable transfers at 21.35, against 21.17 and 21.22. Checks on Sweden closed at 26.02 and cable transfers at 26.07, against 26.07 and 26.12, while checks on Norway finished at 18.75 and cable transfers at 18.80, against 18.18 and 18.23 the week before. Final quotations for Spanish pesetas were 15.51 for checks and 15.56 for cable transfers. Last week the close was 15.49 and 15.54. With regard to South American exchange little if any change has taken place. Checks on Argentina finished a shade firmer, at 35%, and cable transfers at 36, against 35% and 35%, but Brazil closed at 13% for checks and 13% for cable transfers, un­ changed. Chilean exchange was steady at 11%, (unchanged), and Peru at 3 48, against 3 46 last week. Far Eastern rates were as follows: Kong Kong, 54%@55, against 54%@54%; Shanghai, 73%@74, against 73%@74; Yokohama, 47%@47%, against 47%@47%; Manila, 49@49% (unchanged); Singa­ pore, 51@51%, against 50%@51; Bombay, 28%@ 28% (unchanged), and Calcutta, 28%@29 (un­ changed) . tions on the Clearing House institutions.

THE COUNTRY’S MONEY DEBT TO THE SOLDIERS — ITS RE COGN1TI ON AND ITS PAYMENT. In the present situation in Washington concern­ ing this subject it is proper and timely, and should also be helpful towards an honest judgment, to see what has been done in recognition and payment of the country’s moneyed debt to ex-service men. For this we must turn back about five years. In the special session called just after this coun­ try entered the war, in .1917, the subject of insur­ ance was taken up. Very sensibly, the first step was to consult the life insurance companies. They could not agree among themselves upon the war risk, and all hope of any joint action by them with the Government was soon abandoned; they acted for and by themselves as to war extras, and in course of time were hard hit by the war mortality and by the influenza which followed it. The Administra­ tion heard the companies’ advice but turned away from experts, and proceeded to put through the in­ surance bill, which was said to have been written by a judge in a Federal court. The bill covered a family allowance, contributory and compulsory on the part of the man; a compensation scheme, non­ contributory, paid for by the country, and itself a liberal insurance; finally, a formal insurance, con­ tributory and optional, but paid for by the country as to the war risk. This last part (Article IV) was an ill-devised excrescence, of which the “Chronicle” said [Sept. 29 1917] that it was “not only danger­ ously indefinite but contains the seeds of a jmssible undoing of the intent to replace the pension by some­ thing better.” We had previously noted the general agreement in the country concerning adequate and liberal provision “and concerning the great desir­ ability of a better scheme than the ancient one of pensions,” but had to add that “there is no warrant that a service pension scheme may not obtrude it­ self, later on, and may be pushed as such schemes have been in the past; no Congress can bar action by following Congresses, and nothing short of a con- A pril 15 1922.] THE CHRONICLE stitutional amendment can absolutely make an end of the pension.” The “seeds of a possible undoing” of the excellent intent to replace the pension by something better were chiefly in the great looseness and vagueness of the insurance section. For some were sure to omit to avail themselves of the option to apply for the insurance, “and in this difference will be found a cause of complaint” ; some were sure to fail to keep up their insurance after taking it, and in course of time a demand might arise for relief legislation for “adjustment” of alleged unjust in­ equalities. Criticisms upon this hasty measure are useless now, and the only point in recalling it is to show that it was distinctly offered and pressed as being a final disposition of the subject of soldier relief. As such, it was accepted. This has not yet been de­ nied, and in evidence take the following explana­ tion bjr Secretary McAdoo himself, made to a com­ mittee on August 17 1917: “This bill, to my mind, will effectually satisfy the country with respect also to pension claims that would otherwise arise out of tire war. It is in lieu of pensions. “It not only provides for the support of the fami­ lies of the men who are called to the front which the pension laws do not cover but also provides for all of the indemnities the pension laws contain, and in addition to that gives this insurance, which, I think, is one of the most valuable features of the bill. “It further provides means for the re-education and rehabilitation of the men who are partially or wholly disabled. That is one of the most humane portions of the bill. “The bill provides, in lieu of all pensions here­ after, that these war risk compensations and indem­ nities will be paid; that is, the compensation and indemnities provided in the bill.” It is hardly supposable that anybody will attempt such a quibble upon words as to assert any differ­ ence between “pension” and “bonus” ; either is some­ thing additional, and neither can be justified or claimed on other ground than as a debt morally owed. Take either word, it falls within the distinct general understanding, unmistakably expressed by Mr. McAdoo, that the insurance scheme was to cover everything and be “in lieu of” any further obligation. There was no contract in legal form, but acceptance was no less morally binding than if there had been. Perhaps what has been done towards discharging the nation’s money debt has not all been done wisely, yet consider what it amounts to. Ac­ cording to figures prepared by the director of the War Veterans’ Bureau, and brought down to the close of 1921, there were then in force 339,167 policies of War Risk Term Insurance, for over 2% billions in face amount, and 259,730 policies of Government life insurance, for nearly a billion in amount; the two forms of policies aggregating 598,897 in number and 13,165,775,138 in amount. Upon these two forms of policy there had been allowed 148,361 “term” claims, with a computed value of over 1,311 millions, and 1,307 life insurance claims, with a computed value of over 5% millions, and “the amount paid on insurance to date” was over 283% millions. The number of ex­ service men receiving “compensation” was 153,651; in the month of December a little over 11 millions was paid on this class of claims, and the total paid on them to date was over 300 millions. At that time 28,687 men were receiving “treatment,” and over 1585 53% millions had been spent on hospitalization out of the 1921 appropriation; to this we may now add that March 31 the lower house of Congress passed a bill authorizing the Bureau to spend another 17 millions to provide further hospital facilities and medical aid to veterans. For vocational trainings 299,879 applicants had been declared eligible, up to the end of last year; 137,068 had entered upon such training, and 101,578 were then engaged in it. Suim ming these figures, we have in round numbers 618% millions for insurance and “compensation,” about 583 millions for “allotments and allowances,” nearly 212% millions for vocational training, SO millions for medical and hospital service, and about 17 mil­ lions for administrative expenses. These foot up $1,541,447,182 expended for soldier relief down to this year. On Jan. 21 Secretary Mellon told the Houte Com­ mittee that Ave are now expending on account of this money debt 450 millions a year, “more than for any one purpose except interest on the public debt,” and on Feb. 16 the President said “we are now expend­ ing about 400 millions a year in compensation, hos­ pitalization and rehabilitation.” A number of States ha\\re no constitutional prohibition of incur­ ring public debt for private benefit, and a large ag­ gregate of bonds for bonus purposes has already been placed. Early in February, the Bank of Amer­ ica figured that $191,389,300 Avas already in course of distribution in thirteen States and that 156% milIions more will be paid under legislation already en­ acted. There seems ho reason to question this, and Ave might include in our reflections about it the fact that the bonus bond issue voted in this State in 1920 but declared unconstitutional by the Court of Ap­ peals is noAv on its way to completion through a con­ stitutional amendment and Ave may expect to have another 45 millions added, within the next two years, to our already quite ample State debt. Were the subject less serious, Ave might see humor in the plea that the States can afford to pay bonuses be­ cause (unlike the practice in previous Avars) they did not liaA-e to raise and equip men for the field, the “Government” taking that labor. But somehoAv the “Government” is in financial straits. For ex­ ample, the Treasury reports in the past month a falling off of about 16% in receipts from income and excess profits taxes and of about 39% in “ordinary” receipts as compared Avith the like time of last year. Perhaps 400 or 450 millions a year seem hardly 011 worth discussing, now that Ave hav^e been carried along into the habit of familiarity Avith “billions.” Yet Ave need not turn back in our national career a full quarter-century to find a time Avhen the entire national expense bill for a year Avas less than 400 millions; indeed, it Avas not much above 300 millions, and, even then, “service and military pensions” took about 45% of it. So readily do we progress when Ave have once made the start, and the movement is so much more easy and rapid, when it is on a down-, grade. More than a month ago a prominent Republican Club passed resolutions denouncing any scheme for paying money to uninjured soldiers and calling for a Congressional investigation of the expenditures already made for the disabled, “to the end that the country may be assured that the veterans are receiv­ ing the fullest possible benefit from the appropria­ tions made on their behalf.” The point is well taken, 1586 THE CHKONICLE for experience has shown that any such large ex­ penditure by any Government needs and should have careful watching; corruption is almost sure to slip in somewhat, and it is certain that there will be misdirection, inefficiency and waste. Therefore the work should be investigated, to correct whatever wrong is in it and to clear and justify it if no wrong is found; the investigation should be made in the manner and spirit of a strict corporation audit, by competent men instead of partisan politicians, and without effort or desire to find something that can be used as campaign stuff in the elections. This suggestion of the Republican Club may well be taken up by the Senate. At least, it seems reason­ ably sure that the bonus raid will not duplicate in that body its gagged rush in the House, but will meet deliberation and some degree of sanity in treat­ ment. In that treatment, the question may well be raised whether the money debt due the ex-service men is not already so far in course of discharge that nothing need be added to it at present. “MORE BUSINESS IN GOVERNMENT” While the recent summary removal of a large num­ ber of division chiefs in the Bureau of Engraving and Printing of the Treasury Department at Washington naturally causes a tempest of discussion at the Capi­ tal, it will be looked upon with a more temperate in­ terest by the country at large. In Congress, when Senator Norris, a Republican, and an ardent believer in the “civil service,” tells “the Senator from New Hampshire” that he has a right to be a believer in the “spoils system” if that be his conviction, we realize that there are still two sides to this old question. Senator Norris feels that while both Republican and Democratic Presidents have “extended” its applica­ tion, both have “broken” the civil service require­ ments at times in the making of appointments, and, being the ardent advocate he is, he demands strict observance of the law or its abandonment. President Harding's reply to an inquiry by the Bu­ reau heads as to ivhy they were dismissed, has caused much criticism by its asserted lack of reasons, by its so-called obscurity. But it seems to us well within the prerogative of the Executive, dignified and yet kindly. In substance—there was no statement and no intent in the removal to make charges as to char­ acter or work—though the inference is left that an “investigation” in progress is yet to be heard. “Good of the service” may be for many other reasons. Charges are not necessary to the exercise of Presi­ dential power under the law further than that cov­ ered by for “the good of the service.” There is no Ex­ ecutive intent to thwart the law—better business in Government is sought. The Executive is not subject to answer implications. Citizens, however, we think, will drive straight to the centre of this problem—that if we are really to have “more business in government” we must take account of conditions as we find them in today. The “Civil Service” must be judged by the requirements of efficiency in Government. It is not, therefore, now, or at any time, a sacred institution. Its historic consideration presents anomalies. Originally a Dem­ ocratic proposal the Democrats made many a former campaign upon the slogan “turn the rascals out.” Republicans now come into power, and in the main, taking the recent removals as an example, declare that the reason “for the good of the service” if it re­ [V ol. 114. quires summary removals is in the spirit of the law, and in any event is paramount. During the war Washington swarmed with “de­ partment clerks.” Thousands upon thousands of them have been discharged. If the civil service rules were “stretched” a little in the emergency, shall they be invoked now to hold in office appointees secured in this manner? Does it not seem reasonable to say that if the effort to put more business into Govern­ ment is to succeed it may require in certain instances that summary dismissals be made? In fact, stating a general proposition, there is a certain class of office holders that cannot be gotten rid of save by removing their heads close to their shoulders. And at most, all things considered, the people will not grow excited over a political hullabaloo raised over the loss of a few heads and a few offices in the face of a seven mil­ lion majority in favor of a “change” after the war. One might almost say that if there shall appear to be as much incompetency, to use no graver term, in the “engraving” as there has been shown to be in the “shipping,” removals are in the right direction. An ex-official of the Civil Service Commission en­ ters the discussion to point out that originally the law was intended to cover only the selection and ten­ ure of clerks in the lower grades of departmental ser­ vice. He notes its constant “extension.” He believes it very hard to draw the line where the application of the law should stop. He declares his personal opinion is that it should not apply to the appointees who have leading parts and responsibilities in the “executive and administrative” business. He feels that there should be in these places a close “sympa­ thy” with the aims and purposes of the “Administra­ tion”—a reason for removals often heralded. We advance this thought that judgment in this matter must pass beyond consideration of civil ser­ vice, spoils, and mugwumpism, and reach a golden mean between the two camps in this, that if the party in power will rise above partisanship in the selection and retention of employees of the Government, there will be “better service,” and the people need not con­ cern themselves either for or against either civil ser­ vice or spoils, for there is ability enough in either “party” to efficiently administer the ministerial work of Government in normal times if that party will hew to the line of efficiency first. There are ob­ jections to keeping men in official appointive posi­ tions indefinitely. If each new “administration” will recognize the “four-year limit” of its own tenure, reappointing the worthy and competent without ref­ erence to politics and removing the others, replacing them with competents, the civil service will never be torn to shreds nor will cliques be able to perpetuate themselves indefinitely in office. As to the average man holding a “Government po­ sition” for a period of twenty-five years as a bureau chief (or a common clerk for that matter) he tends to become a petty and an intolerant autocrat, inim­ ical to change of obsolete methods, or he becomes an indifferent “go-easy,” inimical to progress and care­ less of administration. A “shake-up” becomes the only way where civil service has “run to seed.” It is to be borne in mind here that if Civil Service becomes so hidebound as to prevent removals some­ what summary in manner—the fact of long tenure in office is not proof in itself of efficiency—rather it is a shield for incompetency by reason of the difficulty and sentiment attending removal. Also this must be true—the power that can make sweeping “exten­ A pril 15 1922.] THE CHRONICLE sions,” can certainly remove them—in part or in whole. And when we contrast the evils of perpetuity in ofice with spoils it must appear that if Civil Ser­ vice be made to cover practically the whole of admin­ istration the effect might be to create an arrogant oligarchy of office-holders which might snap its fin­ gers at the intent of the people to put more business in Government, and might defy even a seven million majority dictate or mandate for more efficient ser­ vice. It is shown that wasteful methods are yet in use. Other things are hinted. *We need not discuss these until the investigation and “check-up” now in progres is finished. It may be found that there was no more feasible way open than the summary one adopt­ ed. The main point as we see it is—that “more busi­ ness in Government” means that only those shall stay on who succeed (but that even in this, good and effi­ cient service in appointive places under changing ad­ ministrations is not a patent or fee simple title to of­ fice for life)—and this success must be measured by that of the man in outside business who, meeting all comers, all competition, in the ever changing conduct of his own personal enterprise, shows his fitness by his growing plant and his continuing profits. We realize the parallel is lacking in many ways—we know the man acting for the people in a limited work is hampered in what he would do—but what­ ever befalls, it cannot be argued that he should re­ main because of “civil service,” in the face of incom­ petency and waste.________________ “A SAVING WAGE” Secretary of Labor James J. Davis, replying to an editorial in the New York “Times” relating to his ar­ ticle “Toward a Saving Wage,” recently said : “There is, of course, no hard and fast definition of what con­ stitutes a living or a saving wage, for the simple rea­ son that all economic principles are highly abstract and hard to state in terms that are simple and pre­ cise. But the facts that argue against too savage cuts in wages, and argue for a wage so adjusted to pre­ vailing prices as to permit of reasonable buying and saving, seem to me self-evident and sufficiently hard and fast.” And then he introduces, by way of illus­ tration, a suppositious case in which the daily wage of every one of the forty million wage earners is re­ duced a dollar a day “it means the drying up the rivers of purchasing power at the rate of $15,000,­ 000,000 a year” with the consequent decline of busi­ ness and the diminishing of dividends. Of course, this illustration is only offered as a reductio ad absurdum argument! The important consideration lies in these words: “A wage so adjusted to jircvailing prices as to per­ mit a reasonable buying and saving.” The Secretary thinks tins is a self-evident” proposition But is i t ! Wc admit at the outset that the contention em­ bodied in this declaration lends itself to a see-saw argument. And yet this lends force to the fact that wages and prices act and react upon each other. Re­ late this adjustment to the present. We are living, more oi less, in an abnormal period of war prices. Since labor or wage is so large a part of cost-price (augmented by a swollen selling price), how can an equilibrium ever be re-established if we are first to gauge wages by prevailing prices? Wages and prices cannot in this one-sided way ever be brought into normal limits. If we are to adjust wages to war prices we fasten upon ourselves for all time an ab­ 1587 normal period. To the extent that labor-cost enters into price-cost if we adjust the former to the latter, we shall not be able to reduce price. We must to that extent reduce wages first, and there is no alternative. But when we do this then there may be a reduction in price and that in time must follow because of oth­ er natural and economic laws. The wage earner is now endeavoring to reduce price without accepting reduction in wage by his contention for war-wages—war-wages being outside normal laws, and Avar being outside the natural life of man. The introduction of the cause of a “saving wage” folloAvs the contention for a “living wage.” We agree that the wage should be, abstractly considered, sufficient to permit of saving, though we deny the power of Government or of unionism to declare what this ratio should be. It must appear, however, that adjustment cannot be upon one side alone. Wages and prices must move toAvard a common point, and when they have reached it there is an equilibrium that Avill normally remain —though of course there are so many affecting fac­ tors as to predicate a state of flux. The important fact should not escape attention—that if it were pos­ sible to adjust price to a saving-wage independent of Avage-cost itself there would be as much opportunity for “saving” as by the proposed one-sided adjust­ ment. Holding strictly to the two parts of the equa­ tion, this is in time not possible. It sometimes seems hard that we are bound to live under these mutually reacting natural laws. Yet we must believe that all wages (so many are the contrib­ uting and temporary affecting influences) can never be brought to the horizontal of what we call a “dead level” as to the payment by various industries; nor can prices ever be brought to the same level as em­ bracing all the objects and articles of industry. And any artificial laAv inevitably constitutes an interfer­ ence which retards the natural processes of adjust­ ment and destroys the equilibrium of wage and price. This being true, no r e l a t e margin of saving power can ever be declared. If it were possible to so declare it, there is no power existent anywhere to make men utilize the marginal saving in the same way. That this saving power lies somewhere in the difference between wages (earnings) and prices (expenses) is an abstraction incapable of concrete estimate or ex­ pression. The individual cannot escape the laws of opportunity and necessity. They envelop him as at­ mosphere. True, if he cannot earn according to his Avisli either for spending or saving in one industry he is free to go to another. There is no fundamental reason Avhich declares his right to adjust wages to “prevailing prices” at any time, and ignore environ­ ment and other classes of Avage earners. No savung can ever come except as a result of the personal will or effort. Adjusting wages to “pre­ vailing prices” does not compel saving—even if we admit, which we do not, that prices compel spending. On the contrary, saving, not spending, does reduce price, as witness the swift fall in clothing prices due to a large extent to the use of worn clothing rather than buying neAv. Saving here, however, takes itself largely out of relative prices and Avages—since fru­ gality and non-use may belong to the individual in any condition of wages and prices. And it is useless to talk of establishing any saving wage—the saving person must first exist. And the same is also true of the so-called “living wage”—that is to say, outside socialistic living. Tt all comes down to the free play 1588 THE CHRONICLE of competition—open-competition sometimes called —competition of producers and traders inside a giv­ en industry—competition between these- industries themselves, that is to say, the competition between products by substitution. Really a free competition in saving is a species of competition which tends to bring equilibrium of wage and price. [V ol. 114. 000, had a deficit of less than half a million.
