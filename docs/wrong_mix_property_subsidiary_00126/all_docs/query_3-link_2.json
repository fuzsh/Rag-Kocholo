        "text": "Whether you’re recording a podcast or capturing an interview for a video, having quality audio is a must. The PM20-S is a lavalier microphone set-up that is designed specifically for smartphones and mobile devices. This means you can turn your iPhone, Android smartphone, iPad, and other mobile devices into your audio recording studio on the go.\n\nWith the PM20-S you get two great omnidirectional mics. Both of these microphones are combined into one cable that then plugs into your smartphone or other recording devices. This is ideal for interviewing someone, as both people don’t have to share a single mic, providing for a more natural conversation. The interviewee microphone is removable and plugs in using a 3.5mm jack. When you remove this microphone, it leaves you with a female 3.5mm jack that you could even use to plug in another one of your mics and use the PM20-S is a different capacity when recording audio on your mobile device.\n\nWhen recording audio using your smartphone, often you lose the ability to monitor your audio, but this is not an issue with the PM20-S. A monitoring output provides you with a place to plug in your headphones or a speaker, using a 3.5mm plug. This also allows you to use this for live video calls and interviews using your smartphone.\n\nAttaching the microphones to yourself or your subject is super easy with the two alligator clips that come included. You can use this to clip the microphones to a tie, blouse, lapel, or anywhere else that with the help you capture that quality audio. Also included are foam windscreens that will help reduce those loud pops that sometimes come when getting a microphone close to the subject. The storage pouch that comes with the PM20-S is also nice, so you can keep everything secure in one place.\n\nThe portability of this mic is one of my favorite aspects. I don’t have to worry about lugging around my larger audio recorder and microphones just in case an opportunity comes up to interview someone. Since I already take my phone with me most places I go, the only extra thing I need is the small pouch that contains the PM20-S and its accessories. It is so compact, I often slip in my pocket as I’m heading out the door and I know I’ll be ready to capture some high-quality audio."
