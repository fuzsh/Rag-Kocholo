Facilities therefor\n\nDefinitions\n\nthe present invention relates to a method and system for ranking search results and is particularly, but not exclusively, suited to providing search results when the delivery of data corresponding to the search results is metered, such as when data are delivered to terminals connected to mobile networks.\n\nsearch engines such as those provided by GoogleTM and YahooTM, which use âweb crawlersâ to locate new or modified web pages.\n\nthe content of these pages is analyzed, keywords are extracted from the pages, and the keywords are added to a search index, which links to a list of web pages that contain a particular word.\n\na weight or rank for the web page can be generated on the basis of the number of times that word occurs on the web page, and stored in the index.\n\na variety of other parameters can be factored into the web-page rank, including the number of times other search users have clicked on the link to that web page, how extensively that web page is linked to from other web pages, personal reviews and ratings of web pages or sites, or on the basis of an amount that a given web site is willing to pay for a particular ranking.\n\nthe search engine When a user types in a search word or term, the search engine performs a lookup of the search index and generates a result set of web pages that contain the search term. Web pages within this result set may then be organised in accordance with their respective rankings, and the highest-ranked results displayed to the user.\n\nsearch queries are received from terminals that are fixedly connected to the Internet (either directly, or via one or several network portions), and of course the transmission of data within the Internetâon a per request basisâis free.\n\nsearch requests are increasingly being received from terminals connected to wireless networks.\n\nthe transmission of data within mobile networks is typically metered on a per transmission basis.\n\nmobile terminals are faced with hitherto unseen costs for accessing sites on the basis of search results generated by search engines.\n\na search results list in response to a search request, the request comprising one or more search terms, said search terms being held in a storage system arranged to store a plurality of search listings, one or more said search terms, and a bid amount, wherein each search listing is associated with a network location providing access to a set of data, the method comprising:\n\na bid amount comprises an amount of resource that a third party is willing to submit so as to ensure that data is accessed from their network location; suitable resources can include money or network resources, such as use of network services for the purposes of delivering data from their network location.\n\nthe search results list is most preferably ordered so as to present search listings in dependence with sponsored and/or subsidised access to sets of data accessible from respective network locations.\n\nthe method includes generating said second bid amount so as to account for an amount of data corresponding to at least one data item accessible from the network location.\n\nthe method includes weighting the first bid amount according to the size of at least one data element accessible from the network location, whereby to generate said second bid amount.\n\nthe method can include weighting the first bid amount according to the size of a predetermined number of data elements accessible from the network location, whereby to generate said second bid amount.\n\nthe set of data includes a link to the network location and the method includes identifying a cost associated with accessing said link and allocating a classification dependent on the identified cost.\n\nthe classifications can include fully subsidised, partially subsidised and non-subsidised, and the step of ordering the search list further comprises identifying selectable links classified as fully subsidised differently to identifying selectable links classified as partially subsidised and non-subsidised.\n\nthe ordered list comprises a plurality of portions, each said portion corresponding to one of said classifications, whereby to identify said selectable links in accordance with said classifications.\n\nthe set of data includes a link to a further network location, said further network location being accessible via said network location, and the method includes weighting the first bid amount according to the type of said link to the further network location, whereby to generate said second bid amounts.\n\nthe method further includes identifying a number of said links to the further network location and classifying the or each said link.\n\nthe method includes identifying costs of transporting data from the network location to a terminal, by means of, for example weighting the first bid amount in accordance with the identified transport costs, whereby to generate said second bid amounts.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are particularly convenient for use in transmitting search results to a terminal connected to a mobile communications network.\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a distributed information system within which embodiments of the invention can operate;\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing fields of several records stored within the search database shown in FIG. 1 ;\n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing components of the search broker shown in FIG. 1 ;\n\nFIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing components of the search engine shown in FIG. 1 ;\n\nFIG. 5 is a timing diagram showing data flows between components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1 when operating according to a process of an embodiment of the present invention\n\nFIG. 6 is a schematic diagram showing an example web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5 ;\n\nFIG. 7 is a schematic diagram showing an alternative example web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5 ;\n\nFIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing a further web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5 ;\n\nFIG. 9 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to an embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1 ;\n\nFIG. 10 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1 ;\n\nFIG. 11 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to a yet further embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1 .\n\nembodiments of the present invention are concerned with ranking search results for delivery to content providers and/or end users via devices such as mobile terminals.\n\nthe nature of the ranking process and the criteria relating thereto is described in detail below, but first a description of the infrastructure needed to support some embodiments of the invention will be presented.\n\nFIG. 1 shows an example of a distributed information system 1 within which some embodiments of the invention operate; the messaging system 1 comprises a plurality of information providers 6 a , 6 b , 6 c , at least some of which are arranged to store content and information, a content search broker 8 , and a search engine 10 , all of which are connected to a network 12 either directly or indirectly (e.g. via the Internet, local area networks (LANs), other wide area networks (WANs), and regional networks accessed over telephone lines, such as commercial information services).\n\nLANs local area networks\n\nWANs wide area networks\n\nregional networks accessed over telephone lines such as commercial information services\n\nMobile terminals 2 , 4 are adapted to communicate with the various information providers 6 a , 6 b , 6 c via mobile network 14 and an appropriate gateway GW, as shown; the terminals 2 , 4 can be mobile telephones or PDAs, lap top computers and the like, and the mobile network 14 can comprise licensed (such as cellular networks using e.g. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology, Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA); Code Division Multiplex Access (CDMA), WiMax) and/or unlicensed network portions (such as Wireless LANs and Bluetooth technologies).\n\nthe gateway GW can be a GPRS support node (GGSN) forming part of the mobile network 14 .\n\nGGSN GPRS support node\n\nthe mobile terminals 2 , 4 comprise browser programs adapted to locate, and access data from, web sites corresponding to the or each information provider 6 a , 6 b , 6 c .\n\nthe browser programs allow users of the terminals 2 , 4 to enter addresses of specific web sites, typically in the form of Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, and are typically adapted to receive and display web and WAP pages; in the event that a given terminal 2 is only capable of processing and displaying WAP pages, translation of a web page can be performed by a device in the network or by suitable translation software running on the device 2 .\n\nany given web page can include links nested therein, which, when selected, can provide access to other pages or data such as plain textual information, or digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs, audio signals, videos graphics, etc. Accordingly selection of such links results in transmission of further data to the terminals 2 , 4 .\n\nthe search engine 10 is operable to receive keywords of interest to the users of terminals 2 , 4 , and, by accessing data stored in the search database 20 , to generate a search results list.\n\nthe search results include, at least in part, entries obtained from and formatted by the results of a bidding process, to be described in detail below.\n\nthe search results are organised into a list of hypertext links to documents that contain information relevant to these search terms of interest and the search engine 10 transmits this list, for example in the form of a web page, to a specified mobile terminal 2 , 4 , where it is displayed by the browser running on the mobile terminal.\n\nthe search broker 8 is preferably embodied as a web server, and essentially provides an interface to the search database 20 via which the information providers 6 a , 6 b , 6 c can submit their bids to influence their position in the search results list.\n\nthe search broker 8 comprises standard operating system, storage, Input/Output, processor and memory components, and bespoke software components in the form of authentication software component 301 , bid capturing software component 303 , and account updating software component 305 (the latter will be described later in relation to FIG. 5 ).\n\nthe authentication software component 301 comprises a firewall, not shown, which is arranged to protect the bid capturing software component 303 and information stored in the search database 20 from unauthorised access. Additional security may be provided via enhancements to the standard communications protocols such as Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).\n\nthe bid capturing software component 303 is arranged to process authenticated bids received from an information provider 6 a , 6 b , 6 c .\n\na bid is a request for a URL corresponding to the information provider to be preferentially ranked relative to URLs of other information providers in a list of search results.\n\nembodiments of the invention are concerned with providing search results to end users either directly to a mobile terminal or indirectly via a content provider.\n\ntransmission of data over wireless networks is chargeable; since the recipient of the data is typically paying for receipt of these data, the amount of data being transmitted is material to the recipient.\n\nembodiments of the invention are arranged to rank search results in dependence on delivery costs to be borne by the subscriber. This might be different to the actual delivery costs, since information providers can frame their bid criteria so as to subsidise delivery of their data to mobile terminals.\n\nthe bid criteria submitted by information providers can include two sets of criteria: a first set, applying to delivery of search results to fixed-line terminals, and a second set, applying to delivery of search results over radio networks, being designed to account for transmission charges expected to be levied when a mobile user accesses data from its network location.\n\na first set applying to delivery of search results to fixed-line terminals\n\na second set applying to delivery of search results over radio networks, being designed to account for transmission charges expected to be levied when a mobile user accesses data from its network location.\n\nthere can be a single set of bid criteria and the storage and/or transmission criteria can be used by the search engine 10 at the time of providing search results to modify the bid amounts.\n\na bid comprises a plurality of components, including one or more key words of interest, storage characteristics and/or transmission characteristics of the data accessible via the URL and a set of bid criteria.\n\nTypical bid criteria include one or more of:\n\nTypical storage characteristics and/or transmission characteristics include one or more of:\n\nthe bid capturing software component 303 can be arranged to download the web page so as to verify, or correct, the submitted data.\n\nthe portion of the bid which can be used to provide Subsidized Access can be defined by search service provider.\n\nP 1 and P 2 are probability values indicative of the likelihood of users accessing the click-through links.\n\nMany information providers maintain statistics indicative of access to internal and external links, so this information can be provided by the information providers at the time of submitting the storage and/or transmission criteria.\n\nthe bid capturing software component 303 can apply estimates for the respective probabilities, in the form of discrete values (such as, if there are eight inter-web click through links (so eight layers of clicks), the probability of accessing level one click is 75%, the probability of accessing level two click is 50%, the probability of accessing level three click is 30%; the probability of accessing level four click is 25%; the probability of accessing level five click is 20% etc.) or in the form of a continuous function.\n\nthe bid capturing software component 303 stores the same in a database record corresponding to the information provider 6 a ; an example of a suitable schema is shown in FIG. 2 .\n\nany given record R comprises for example five fields: the URL corresponding to the information provider is stored in field 201 , the keywords in field 203 , the storage criteria in field 205 , and bid criteria in field 207 .\n\nFIG. 2 is highly schematic and that, in the case of fields 205 , 207 , there the schema will most likely include subfields corresponding to respective elements thereof.\n\nthe search engine 10 is preferably embodied as a web server, and comprises standard operating system, storage, processor, input/output interfaces, together with includes various bespoke software components 401 , 403 , 405 . These software components are arranged, respectively, to receive a search request and identify keywords within the request (request receiving component 401 ); to query the search database 20 on the basis of the keywords and evaluate respective bids associated with information providers registered in respect of the keywords (bid evaluation software component 403 ) so as to generate corresponding search listings; and to arrange the search listings in a list in accordance with the bid amounts (list generating software component 405 ).\n\nthe request receiving software component 401 is also arranged to identify the terminal 2 to which the search listings are to be transmitted, so that the list generating software component 405 can deliver the results to this terminal 2 .\n\nthe list generating software component 405 triggers an update to the account balances of those information providers appearing on the results list. Details of this updating process will be described in relation to FIG. 5 , described below.\n\nthe bid evaluation software component 403 is arranged to identify and combine the various criteria that influence the access costs, as will now be described in more detail.\n\nthe bid criteria it will be apparent from inspection of the bid criteria that the actual magnitude of a bid that is submitted for a particular set of keywords may vary per search request received. This is due to the fact that a) the number of information providers that have registered with the search database 20 can vary over time, b) the funds available to a given information provider to place a bid varies over time (since funds get depleted) and c) the data accessible from network locations (thus storage/transmission characteristics) vary over time.\n\nThis variation is particularly acute in relation to the bid criterion specifying a âlowest acceptable ranked position in a set of search resultsâ, and can be seen from consideration of an example in which the bid criteria specify a lowest acceptable ranked position of âthirdâ.\n\nthe amount that will be deducted from information provider 6 a 's account balance will vary as the number of information providers, and their downloadable content, changes, since e.g. the greater the number of information providers that have registered for the keywords âcars, engines, motorbikesâ, the greater the amount of resources that will have to be deducted from the information provider 6 a 's balance to keep information provider 6 a listed in third position.\n\nthose information providers having resource-heavy web sites will have to bid a significantly greater amount than would information providers having fewer resources to download in order to get higher ranking.\n\nFIG. 5 is a timing diagram showing the various messages and data transmission between components 2 , 10 , 20 , 6 c and 16 .\n\nthe mobile terminal 2 sends a search request to the search engine 10 using the browser application of the terminal 2 , the search request comprising one or more keywords of interest.\n\nthe search request is received by the search engine 10 , having been routed via the mobile network 14 , gateway GW and other network portions, and the request receiving component 401 extracts the keywords from the search request, formulating a query based thereon and sending same to the search database 20 (step S 5 . 3 ).\n\nthe search database 20 performs a lookup in respect of the keywords and retrieves data indicative of network location, storage criteria, bid criteria, and account balance (collectively referred to as ranking criteria) for all information providers listed against keywords corresponding to the search request, and creates a message M 1 including this information.\n\nthe message M 1 comprises a plurality of entries, each relating to a respective information provider and having a predetermined format so as to accommodate the ranking criteria.\n\nthe message M 1 is then sent to the search engine 10 (step S 5 . 5 ).\n\nthe search database 20 will also hold entries corresponding to information providers that are not interested in paying for a position in a list of search results (and in respect of which the bid criteria is null). Since the query performed at step S 5 . 5 will return all information providers corresponding to the keywords specified in the search request, the message M 1 will include entries corresponding to non-paying and paying information providers.\n\nthe bid evaluation software component 403 is arranged to receive the message M 1 sent from the search database 20 , to retrieve data therefrom, and to apply a ranking algorithm, such as the one described above, in respect of each of the paying information providers listed in the message M 1 (step S 5 . 7 ).\n\nthe output of this ranking process is a list of network locations, each accompanied by a bid/kbyte value.\n\nthe list generating software component 403 then compiles a list comprising selectable links to network locations corresponding to the information providers, the list being ordered in accordance with the bid/kbyte value, so that the network location corresponding to the highest bid/kbyte value is positioned at the top of the list.\n\nthe payingâand rankedânetwork locations are preferably separated from the non-paying information providers.\n\nthe sorted list preferably comprises a subsidised portion 601 , a fully chargeable portion 603 , and a search requesting portion 605 .\n\naccount identification information is coded into the subsidised portion 601 of the search results page W 1 on a per listing basis, and each of the links appearing within the subsidised portion 601 actually corresponds to the network address of the search broker 8 .\n\nthis causes the terminal 2 to send an account identifier and URL corresponding to the selected listing to the search broker 8 ; the search broker 8 is then responsible for updating the respective account together with re-directing the request to the URL of the selected listing.\n\nthe account identifier is embedded as a parameter in the URL, but it could be embedded within a cookie that is transmitted to, and maintained at, the terminal 2 along with the results page W 1 .\n\nthe results page W 1 is transmitted to the terminal 2 at step S 5 . 9 ; assuming the user to select one of the links appearing within the subsidised portion 601 (e.g. information provider 6 c ), message M 2 comprising account identification and the selected URL is transmitted to the search broker 8 (step S 5 . 11 ).\n\nthe message M 2 is processed by the account updating software component 305 shown in FIG. 3 , causing the account updating component 305 to send a standard HTTP retrieval request to the URL listed within message M 2 , the request having, as source address, a network identifier corresponding to the terminal 2 (step S 5 . 13 ).\n\nthe account updating software component 305 accesses the search database 20 on the basis of account identifier retrieved from message M 2 , and at step S 5 . 15 updates the account balance (field 209 ) in accordance with the bid criteria evaluated at step S 5 . 7 .\n\nData are transmitted to the terminal 2 under control of the information provider corresponding to the selected URL in response to the re-directed access request transmitted from the search broker 8 at step S 5 . 13 . Whilst this is shown in FIG. 5 (step S 5 . 19 ), it will be appreciated that transmission of data from the network location occurs independently of the components of data information system 1 , and is shown for completeness only.\n\nFIG. 5 includes a step involving the search broker 8 sending a message to the billing system 16 associated with the mobile network portion 14 shown in FIG. 1 .\n\nthis additional refinement to the ranking process means that the search listings can be further categorised for selection by the userâinto âfreeâ portion 604 , âsubsidisedâ portion 601 and âfully chargedâ portion 603 within web page W 1 â².\n\nthe bid criteria 207 specified by any given information provider 6 a , 6 b , 6 c can include data indicative of the amount of money that the information provider is willing to pay so as to cover transmission of data to any given mobile terminal; for example, assuming the bid criteria 207 corresponding to information provider 6 a specifies that all delivery costs will be covered, the web page W 1 â²â² appears as shown in FIG. 8 .\n\ndata indicative of the actual cost to the subscriber to receive data from the selected information provider 6 c are transmitted to the billing system 16 at step S 5 . 17 , preferably before the data are transmitted from the information provider, so that the subscriber's balance can be âtopped upâ to cover the subsidised costs.\n\nFIGS. 9 and 10 show the steps involved for an example in which the search request relates to âhotels in Londonâ: FIG. 9 relates to the case where the information source submits bid criteria so as to influence the position of the information source in the search results, but does not agree to subsidise access to their site, and FIG. 10 relates to the case where the information source both submits bid criteria so as to influence the position of the information source in the search results and at least some of the information sources (corresponding to hotel 2 and hotel 3 ) agree to subsidiseâeither partly or fullyâthe transport costs associated with accessing data from their site.\n\nThese two examples clearly show the effects of weighting the bid amounts in accordance with the amount of data to be transmitted and subsidising subsequent requests to access data from the information sources.\n\nFIG. 11 relates to the case in which the amount of subsidy specified by the information provider in relation to transport costs is related to their bid amount (i.e. the amount that the information source has bid for the purposes of achieving a preferential ranking position in the search results transmitted at step S 5 . 9 ).\n\nthe bid criteria submitted by the information source specifies a transport subsidy as a percentage of the bid amount (this being submitted via the search broker 8 in the manner described above), and in the specific example shown in FIG. 11 the transport subsidy is specified as 40% of the bid amount.\n\nthe web page W 1 â² transmitted to the mobile terminal 2 only shows search results corresponding to web sites that have been determined as free to access (portion 604 ) (in addition to the non-sponsored web sites (portion 603 )). It can clearly be seen from these examples that the list generating software component 405 orders the search results in accordance with profit associated with any given information source.\n\nthe search engine 10 is described as having access to the storage and/or transmission characteristics in addition to the bid criteria\n\nthe distributed information system 1 could include an additional network component, arranged to store the storage and/or transmission characteristics, and to receive search results, ranked in accordance with conventional methods, from the search engine 10 , and to then factor in the storage and/or transmission characteristics.\n\nthe ranking process comprises separate stages, performed at different logical devices, rather than comprising a single integrated process.\n\nan information provider can store content and/or promotional data, and accordingly can be hosted or sponsored by an advertiser.\n\nthe search requests submitted at step S 5 . 1 can be submitted from a terminal other than the one to which the search results are to be delivered; for example, requests could be submitted as part of an automated process, which includes, as one of the input fields, an identifier corresponding to the terminal 2 destined to receive the search results.\n\nsearch requests could be typed in or entered via speech recognition software.\n\neach record R i in the search database 20 corresponding to an information provider can comprise a field relating to an account balance for the information provider.\n\nthe balance is quantified in terms of resources, which can be money or usage of communications services.\n\nthe latter type of resource would be particularly convenient for the arrangement in which transportation costs are factored into the ranking process, since communications resources could be directly traded rather than being translated into and out of financial amounts.\n\nthe ranked and categorised search results are delivered to a mobile terminal\n\nthe search results could alternatively be transmitted to a search results service, for further processing of the results or delivery thereof to the mobile device.\n\nthe information source can submit data indicative of an overall, or specifically allocated, budget.\n\nany given information provider can specify a link to a network location that is unrelated to the keywords (e.g. an information source providing information in relation to the key words âhotels Londonâ can specify links to network locations unrelated to these keywords).\n\nnon-sponsored Link is to be understood as including (but not limited to) a link to a network location associated with an information source whose ranking in a list of search results is defined purely on the relevance of the content of the web page to key words related thereto and is unrelated to any bid amounts associated therewith.\n\nsponsored link is to be understood as including (but not limited to) a link to a network location associated with an information source whose ranking in a list of search results is dependent on bid amounts relating to the position of the link in the list of search results. However, in general the term does not refer to subsidizing access to content associated with any of the links listed in the search results.\n\nsubsidized access is to be understood as including (but not limited to) part of the bid amount, the amount of the subsidy being dependent on the parameters available for the purposes of providing subsidised or free access to a network location associated with an information source.\n\nsubsidized access can cover, wholly or in part, the costs of associated with accessing data from the network location associated with the information source.\n\nbid criteria is to be understood as including (but not limited to) criteria for use in determining how a bid amount can be used to provide subsidised access to a network location associated with an information source.\n\nLandscapes\n\nBusiness, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nEngineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nTheoretical Computer Science (AREA)\n\nFinance (AREA)\n\nAccounting & Taxation (AREA)\n\nDevelopment Economics (AREA)\n\nPhysics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Physics & Mathematics (AREA)\n\nStrategic Management (AREA)\n\nMarketing (AREA)\n\nEconomics (AREA)\n\nGeneral Business, Economics & Management (AREA)\n\nDatabases & Information Systems (AREA)\n\nGeneral Engineering & Computer Science (AREA)\n\nData Mining & Analysis (AREA)\n\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation (AREA)\n\nTechnology Law (AREA)\n\nGame Theory and Decision Science (AREA)\n\nInformation Transfer Between Computers (AREA)\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and system for ranking search results and is particularly, but not exclusively, suited to providing search results when the delivery of data corresponding to the search results is metered, such as when data are delivered to terminals connected to mobile networks.\n\nDescription\n\nThis application is U.S. patent application that relies for priority under 35 U.S.C. 119, on Application Serial No. GB0704837.4, filed on Mar. 13, 2007, which is incorporated herein by reference.\n\nFIELD OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and system for ranking search results and is particularly, but not exclusively, suited to providing search results when the delivery of data corresponding to the search results is metered, such as when data are delivered to terminals connected to mobile networks.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nThe explosive growth of the Internet has resulted in huge numbers of web pages being published. Finding specific information among the billions of pages of information is facilitated by search engines, such as those provided by Googleâ¢ and Yahooâ¢, which use âweb crawlersâ to locate new or modified web pages. The content of these pages is analyzed, keywords are extracted from the pages, and the keywords are added to a search index, which links to a list of web pages that contain a particular word. A weight or rank for the web page can be generated on the basis of the number of times that word occurs on the web page, and stored in the index. A variety of other parameters can be factored into the web-page rank, including the number of times other search users have clicked on the link to that web page, how extensively that web page is linked to from other web pages, personal reviews and ratings of web pages or sites, or on the basis of an amount that a given web site is willing to pay for a particular ranking.\n\nWhen a user types in a search word or term, the search engine performs a lookup of the search index and generates a result set of web pages that contain the search term. Web pages within this result set may then be organised in accordance with their respective rankings, and the highest-ranked results displayed to the user.\n\nIn most cases search queries are received from terminals that are fixedly connected to the Internet (either directly, or via one or several network portions), and of course the transmission of data within the Internetâon a per request basisâis free. With the advent of widespread deployment of 3G networks, search requests are increasingly being received from terminals connected to wireless networks. Unlike the transmission of data within fixed-line networks, the transmission of data within mobile networks is typically metered on a per transmission basis. As a result, mobile terminals are faced with hitherto unseen costs for accessing sites on the basis of search results generated by search engines.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn accordance with aspects of the present invention, there is provided methods and systems according to the appended claims.\n\nMore specifically according to a first aspect there is provided method of generating a search results list in response to a search request, the request comprising one or more search terms, said search terms being held in a storage system arranged to store a plurality of search listings, one or more said search terms, and a bid amount, wherein each search listing is associated with a network location providing access to a set of data, the method comprising:\n\nreceiving a search request;\n\naccessing the storage system so as to identify search listings having search terms generating a match with the received search request;\n\nretrieving data indicative of a first bid amount and a network location corresponding to the or each matched search term, the network location providing access to a set of data corresponding to the matched search term;\n\ngenerating a second bid amount in dependence on the first bid amount and an amount of data associated with the set of data accessible via the network location;\n\nordering the identified search listings into a search results list in accordance with values corresponding to respective second bid amounts for the identified search listings; and\n\noutputting data indicative of the ordered search result list, said outputted data comprising a plurality of selectable links, each corresponding to a said network location.\n\nIn one embodiment a bid amount comprises an amount of resource that a third party is willing to submit so as to ensure that data is accessed from their network location; suitable resources can include money or network resources, such as use of network services for the purposes of delivering data from their network location. The search results list is most preferably ordered so as to present search listings in dependence with sponsored and/or subsidised access to sets of data accessible from respective network locations.\n\nPreferably the method includes generating said second bid amount so as to account for an amount of data corresponding to at least one data item accessible from the network location. In one arrangement the method includes weighting the first bid amount according to the size of at least one data element accessible from the network location, whereby to generate said second bid amount. For example the method can include weighting the first bid amount according to the size of a predetermined number of data elements accessible from the network location, whereby to generate said second bid amount.\n\nIn at least one example the set of data includes a link to the network location and the method includes identifying a cost associated with accessing said link and allocating a classification dependent on the identified cost. The classifications can include fully subsidised, partially subsidised and non-subsidised, and the step of ordering the search list further comprises identifying selectable links classified as fully subsidised differently to identifying selectable links classified as partially subsidised and non-subsidised.\n\nConveniently the ordered list comprises a plurality of portions, each said portion corresponding to one of said classifications, whereby to identify said selectable links in accordance with said classifications.\n\nAdditionally or alternatively the set of data includes a link to a further network location, said further network location being accessible via said network location, and the method includes weighting the first bid amount according to the type of said link to the further network location, whereby to generate said second bid amounts. In one example the method further includes identifying a number of said links to the further network location and classifying the or each said link.\n\nMost preferably the method includes identifying costs of transporting data from the network location to a terminal, by means of, for example weighting the first bid amount in accordance with the identified transport costs, whereby to generate said second bid amounts.\n\nEmbodiments of the invention are particularly convenient for use in transmitting search results to a terminal connected to a mobile communications network.\n\nIn accordance with further aspects of the invention there is provided a distributed system and apparatus for carrying out the method steps described above.\n\nFurther features and advantages of the invention will become apparent from the following description of preferred embodiments of the aspects of the invention, given by way of example only, which is made with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that other embodiments may be utilized and structural and functional modifications may be made without departing from the scope and spirit of the present invention.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n\nFIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram showing a distributed information system within which embodiments of the invention can operate;\n\nFIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing fields of several records stored within the search database shown in FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 3 is a schematic diagram showing components of the search broker shown in FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 4 is a schematic diagram showing components of the search engine shown in FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 5 is a timing diagram showing data flows between components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1 when operating according to a process of an embodiment of the present invention;\n\nFIG. 6 is a schematic diagram showing an example web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5;\n\nFIG. 7 is a schematic diagram showing an alternative example web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5;\n\nFIG. 8 is a schematic diagram showing a further web page output from the search engine during the process shown in FIG. 5;\n\nFIG. 9 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to an embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1;\n\nFIG. 10 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to an alternative embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1; and\n\nFIG. 11 is a schematic flow diagram showing a method according to a yet further embodiment of the invention, as performed by the components of the distributed information system of FIG. 1.\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n\nAs described above, embodiments of the present invention are concerned with ranking search results for delivery to content providers and/or end users via devices such as mobile terminals. The nature of the ranking process and the criteria relating thereto is described in detail below, but first a description of the infrastructure needed to support some embodiments of the invention will be presented.\n\nFIG. 1 shows an example of a distributed information system 1 within which some embodiments of the invention operate; the messaging system 1 comprises a plurality of information providers 6 a, 6 b, 6 c, at least some of which are arranged to store content and information, a content search broker 8, and a search engine 10, all of which are connected to a network 12 either directly or indirectly (e.g. via the Internet, local area networks (LANs), other wide area networks (WANs), and regional networks accessed over telephone lines, such as commercial information services). Mobile terminals 2, 4 are adapted to communicate with the various information providers 6 a, 6 b, 6 c via mobile network 14 and an appropriate gateway GW, as shown; the terminals 2, 4 can be mobile telephones or PDAs, lap top computers and the like, and the mobile network 14 can comprise licensed (such as cellular networks using e.g. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology, Wideband Code Division Multiplex Access (WCDMA); Code Division Multiplex Access (CDMA), WiMax) and/or unlicensed network portions (such as Wireless LANs and Bluetooth technologies). The gateway GW can be a GPRS support node (GGSN) forming part of the mobile network 14.\n\nThe mobile terminals 2, 4 comprise browser programs adapted to locate, and access data from, web sites corresponding to the or each information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c. The browser programs allow users of the terminals 2, 4 to enter addresses of specific web sites, typically in the form of Uniform Resource Locators, or URLs, and are typically adapted to receive and display web and WAP pages; in the event that a given terminal 2 is only capable of processing and displaying WAP pages, translation of a web page can be performed by a device in the network or by suitable translation software running on the device 2. As is known in the art, any given web page can include links nested therein, which, when selected, can provide access to other pages or data such as plain textual information, or digitally encoded multimedia content, such as software programs, audio signals, videos graphics, etc. Accordingly selection of such links results in transmission of further data to the terminals 2, 4.\n\nThe search engine 10 is operable to receive keywords of interest to the users of terminals 2, 4, and, by accessing data stored in the search database 20, to generate a search results list. The search results include, at least in part, entries obtained from and formatted by the results of a bidding process, to be described in detail below. The search results are organised into a list of hypertext links to documents that contain information relevant to these search terms of interest and the search engine 10 transmits this list, for example in the form of a web page, to a specified mobile terminal 2, 4, where it is displayed by the browser running on the mobile terminal.\n\nTurning now to FIGS. 2 and 3, an example of a record that is stored in the search database 20, and a method for populating the record, will be described. In one arrangement the search broker 8 is preferably embodied as a web server, and essentially provides an interface to the search database 20 via which the information providers 6 a, 6 b, 6 c can submit their bids to influence their position in the search results list. As can be seen from FIG. 3, the search broker 8 comprises standard operating system, storage, Input/Output, processor and memory components, and bespoke software components in the form of authentication software component 301, bid capturing software component 303, and account updating software component 305 (the latter will be described later in relation to FIG. 5).\n\nThe authentication software component 301 comprises a firewall, not shown, which is arranged to protect the bid capturing software component 303 and information stored in the search database 20 from unauthorised access. Additional security may be provided via enhancements to the standard communications protocols such as Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). The bid capturing software component 303 is arranged to process authenticated bids received from an information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c. In a preferred embodiment a bid is a request for a URL corresponding to the information provider to be preferentially ranked relative to URLs of other information providers in a list of search results.\n\nAs described above, embodiments of the invention are concerned with providing search results to end users either directly to a mobile terminal or indirectly via a content provider. In cases where search results are delivered to mobile devices, transmission of data over wireless networks is chargeable; since the recipient of the data is typically paying for receipt of these data, the amount of data being transmitted is material to the recipient. Thus, embodiments of the invention are arranged to rank search results in dependence on delivery costs to be borne by the subscriber. This might be different to the actual delivery costs, since information providers can frame their bid criteria so as to subsidise delivery of their data to mobile terminals.\n\nAccordingly, the bid criteria submitted by information providers can include two sets of criteria: a first set, applying to delivery of search results to fixed-line terminals, and a second set, applying to delivery of search results over radio networks, being designed to account for transmission charges expected to be levied when a mobile user accesses data from its network location. Alternatively or additionally, there can be a single set of bid criteria, and the storage and/or transmission criteria can be used by the search engine 10 at the time of providing search results to modify the bid amounts.\n\nIn either case, when ranking search results, it is assumed that the mobile terminal 2, 4 will click on the link corresponding to any given search result; accordingly the amount that respective information providers are willing to bid for preferential ranking of their network location within the search results is evaluated on the basis of this assumptionâi.e. on the basis of the amount of data that will be delivered to the mobile terminal 2, 4 upon selection of the link in the search results.\n\nIn one arrangement a bid comprises a plurality of components, including one or more key words of interest, storage characteristics and/or transmission characteristics of the data accessible via the URL and a set of bid criteria. Typical bid criteria include one or more of:\n\nA maximum amount that the information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c is willing to pay for appearing in any given set of search results;\n\nThe lowest acceptable ranked position in a set of search results;\n\nA resource fund and a period during which the resource fund applies: the fund essentially being a pot of resources from which an amount can be deducted each time the information provider appears in a set of search results;\n\nLinks that are always accessible at no cost\n\nLinks that are accessible at a subsidised cost (or not).\n\nPortion(s) of the links which can be used for Subsidized Access.\n\netc.\n\nTypical storage characteristics and/or transmission characteristics include one or more of:\n\nThe size of the web page accessible via the URL associated with the information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c;\n\nIf the link is associated with Subsidised Access or not.\n\nThe number of click-though links accessible via the URL associated with the information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c (categorised as inter-web page, meaning that the link leads to a web page owned by the same information provider, or external to web page, meaning that the link leads to a web page owned by a different information provider);\n\nThe size of the data accessible via objects accessible via the URL associated with the information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c, such as click-through banners, which lead to other websites. Such objects can additionally include executables, audio or video content, all of a determinable size;\n\nA list of mobile network operators that is permitted to deliver content from the information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c.\n\nValid data plans associated with consumers, operators and/or web page owners.\n\nThese criteria can be specified by a given information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c via a form or similar (not shown), and in the case of the storage and/or transmission characteristics, the bid capturing software component 303 can be arranged to download the web page so as to verify, or correct, the submitted data. In addition the portion of the bid which can be used to provide Subsidized Access can be defined by search service provider. These characteristics are preferably combined by the bid capturing software component 303 so as to provide a single measure of the storage characteristics and/or transmission characteristics. In one arrangement the characteristics are combined so as to generate an overall download requirement, as follows:\n\nDownload requirement=Size of directly accessible web page+No. inter-web page click-through links*P 1+No. external web page click-through links*P 2\n\nWhere P1 and P2 are probability values indicative of the likelihood of users accessing the click-through links. Many information providers maintain statistics indicative of access to internal and external links, so this information can be provided by the information providers at the time of submitting the storage and/or transmission criteria. Alternatively the bid capturing software component 303 can apply estimates for the respective probabilities, in the form of discrete values (such as, if there are eight inter-web click through links (so eight layers of clicks), the probability of accessing level one click is 75%, the probability of accessing level two click is 50%, the probability of accessing level three click is 30%; the probability of accessing level four click is 25%; the probability of accessing level five click is 20% etc.) or in the form of a continuous function.\n\nOnce the data have been verified, the bid capturing software component 303 stores the same in a database record corresponding to the information provider 6 a; an example of a suitable schema is shown in FIG. 2. As can be seen, in this representation, any given record R comprises for example five fields: the URL corresponding to the information provider is stored in field 201, the keywords in field 203, the storage criteria in field 205, and bid criteria in field 207. It will be appreciated that FIG. 2 is highly schematic and that, in the case of fields 205, 207, there the schema will most likely include subfields corresponding to respective elements thereof.\n\nThe processes involved in ranking of search results will now be described with reference to FIG. 4, which shows components of the search engine 10. The search engine 10 is preferably embodied as a web server, and comprises standard operating system, storage, processor, input/output interfaces, together with includes various bespoke software components 401, 403, 405. These software components are arranged, respectively, to receive a search request and identify keywords within the request (request receiving component 401); to query the search database 20 on the basis of the keywords and evaluate respective bids associated with information providers registered in respect of the keywords (bid evaluation software component 403) so as to generate corresponding search listings; and to arrange the search listings in a list in accordance with the bid amounts (list generating software component 405). The request receiving software component 401 is also arranged to identify the terminal 2 to which the search listings are to be transmitted, so that the list generating software component 405 can deliver the results to this terminal 2. In addition, once the search results have been delivered, the list generating software component 405 triggers an update to the account balances of those information providers appearing on the results list. Details of this updating process will be described in relation to FIG. 5, described below.\n\nIn view of the foregoing comments relating to the parameters used to rank search resultsânamely access costsâthe bid evaluation software component 403 is arranged to identify and combine the various criteria that influence the access costs, as will now be described in more detail. By way of an introductory remark, it will be apparent from inspection of the bid criteria that the actual magnitude of a bid that is submitted for a particular set of keywords may vary per search request received. This is due to the fact that a) the number of information providers that have registered with the search database 20 can vary over time, b) the funds available to a given information provider to place a bid varies over time (since funds get depleted) and c) the data accessible from network locations (thus storage/transmission characteristics) vary over time. This variation is particularly acute in relation to the bid criterion specifying a âlowest acceptable ranked position in a set of search resultsâ, and can be seen from consideration of an example in which the bid criteria specify a lowest acceptable ranked position of âthirdâ. The amount that will be deducted from information provider 6 a's account balance will vary as the number of information providers, and their downloadable content, changes, since e.g. the greater the number of information providers that have registered for the keywords âcars, engines, motorbikesâ, the greater the amount of resources that will have to be deducted from the information provider 6 a's balance to keep information provider 6 a listed in third position. In addition, those information providers having resource-heavy web sites will have to bid a significantly greater amount than would information providers having fewer resources to download in order to get higher ranking.\n\nThe details of the algorithms used by the bid evaluation software component 403 to account for these various factors will now be described for various information providers that have entries in the search database 20 corresponding to keywords specified in a search request. In a first arrangement, it is assumed that the information providers have submitted a single set of bid criteria, to be applied irrespective of whether the recipient of the search results is a mobile or fixed terminal. It is also assumed that the magnitude and type of data that are downloadable from the corresponding network locations have been specified and verified in the manner described above, so that fields 201, 203, 205, 207 in the search database 20 have been populated in respect of their selected keywords.\n\nAssuming information provider 6 a has an overall storage transmission characteristic of 3 MB (2 MB+5 click-through links), and that the provider 6 a has specified 1Îµ per search listing (with no preference in relation to position in the rankings) then the bid evaluation software component evaluates a bid per KB of 1Îµ/2 MB=0.0003Îµ/kbyte. As described above, this effectively represents the amount that the sponsor is willing to pay for the mobile terminal 2 to receive data from its network location. Assuming information provider 6 b has an overall storage characteristic of 20 kbyte and has specified 0.2Îµ per search listing, then the amount of subsidy for accessing the network location corresponding to provider 6 b is 0.2/20=0.01Îµ/kbyte; further, assuming information provider 6 c has an overall storage transmission characteristic of 120 kbyte (100 kbyte+2 objects) and has specified 0.3Îµ per search listing, then the amount of subsidy for accessing the network location corresponding to provider 6 b is 0.3/120=0.0025Îµ/kbyte. It can therefore be seen that the effective bids, when ranked in accordance with delivery through a mobile network, result in a ranking of 6 b, 6 c, 6 a, which is quite different to the ranking that applies in respect of delivery solely through fixed networks (6 a (1Îµ), 6 c (0.3Îµ), 6 b (0.2Îµ)).\n\nOperation of the various components of the distributed information system 1 when servicing a search request will now be described with reference to FIG. 5, which is a timing diagram showing the various messages and data transmission between components 2, 10, 20, 6 c and 16. At step S5.1, the mobile terminal 2 sends a search request to the search engine 10 using the browser application of the terminal 2, the search request comprising one or more keywords of interest. The search request is received by the search engine 10, having been routed via the mobile network 14, gateway GW and other network portions, and the request receiving component 401 extracts the keywords from the search request, formulating a query based thereon and sending same to the search database 20 (step S5.3). The search database 20 performs a lookup in respect of the keywords and retrieves data indicative of network location, storage criteria, bid criteria, and account balance (collectively referred to as ranking criteria) for all information providers listed against keywords corresponding to the search request, and creates a message M1 including this information. Thus in one arrangement the message M1 comprises a plurality of entries, each relating to a respective information provider and having a predetermined format so as to accommodate the ranking criteria. The message M1 is then sent to the search engine 10 (step S5.5).\n\nThe foregoing passages assume that all of the information providers listed in the search database 20 have submitted bid criteria when registering via the search broker 8. However, the search database 20 will also hold entries corresponding to information providers that are not interested in paying for a position in a list of search results (and in respect of which the bid criteria is null). Since the query performed at step S5.5 will return all information providers corresponding to the keywords specified in the search request, the message M1 will include entries corresponding to non-paying and paying information providers.\n\nThe bid evaluation software component 403 is arranged to receive the message M1 sent from the search database 20, to retrieve data therefrom, and to apply a ranking algorithm, such as the one described above, in respect of each of the paying information providers listed in the message M1 (step S5.7). The output of this ranking process is a list of network locations, each accompanied by a bid/kbyte value. The list generating software component 403 then compiles a list comprising selectable links to network locations corresponding to the information providers, the list being ordered in accordance with the bid/kbyte value, so that the network location corresponding to the highest bid/kbyte value is positioned at the top of the list. In addition, the payingâand rankedânetwork locations are preferably separated from the non-paying information providers.\n\nReferring to FIG. 6, the sorted list preferably comprises a subsidised portion 601, a fully chargeable portion 603, and a search requesting portion 605. Preferably account identification information is coded into the subsidised portion 601 of the search results page W1 on a per listing basis, and each of the links appearing within the subsidised portion 601 actually corresponds to the network address of the search broker 8. Thus, when a link within the subsidised portion 601 is selected, this causes the terminal 2 to send an account identifier and URL corresponding to the selected listing to the search broker 8; the search broker 8 is then responsible for updating the respective account together with re-directing the request to the URL of the selected listing. Typically the account identifier is embedded as a parameter in the URL, but it could be embedded within a cookie that is transmitted to, and maintained at, the terminal 2 along with the results page W1.\n\nAccordingly the results page W1 is transmitted to the terminal 2 at step S5.9; assuming the user to select one of the links appearing within the subsidised portion 601 (e.g. information provider 6 c), message M2 comprising account identification and the selected URL is transmitted to the search broker 8 (step S5.11). When received, the message M2 is processed by the account updating software component 305 shown in FIG. 3, causing the account updating component 305 to send a standard HTTP retrieval request to the URL listed within message M2, the request having, as source address, a network identifier corresponding to the terminal 2 (step S5.13). At the same time or shortly thereafter, the account updating software component 305 accesses the search database 20 on the basis of account identifier retrieved from message M2, and at step S5.15 updates the account balance (field 209) in accordance with the bid criteria evaluated at step S5.7. Data are transmitted to the terminal 2 under control of the information provider corresponding to the selected URL in response to the re-directed access request transmitted from the search broker 8 at step S5.13. Whilst this is shown in FIG. 5 (step S5.19), it will be appreciated that transmission of data from the network location occurs independently of the components of data information system 1, and is shown for completeness only.\n\nIn the event that the user of the terminal 2 selects a link listed in the non-subsidised portion 603 of the search listings, access to, and retrieval of data from, the web site corresponding thereto will progress in accordance with standard methods and independently of the search broker 8.\n\nIt will be noted that FIG. 5 includes a step involving the search broker 8 sending a message to the billing system 16 associated with the mobile network portion 14 shown in FIG. 1. This relates to a further aspect of the invention, namely one in which the actual transport costs are factored into the ranking algorithm described above. In this aspect of the invention, the search broker 8 has access to transport costs data associated with the various mobile network operators, and, depending on the operator with which the terminal 2 is connected (together with parameters identifying whether the terminal is at home/roaming, time of day etc.), the costs associated with delivering data from the various network locations to the terminal 2 are evaluated by the bid evaluation software component 403 as part of step S5.7. For example, assuming the costs of transport to terminal 2 are P=0.007Îµ/kbyte, then the costs of accessing data from information providers 6 a, 6 b, 6 c are as follows:\n\nInformation provider 6 a: 1Îµ/2 MB=0.0003Îµ/kbyte, which is less than the transport costs, so that, whilst the data is subsidised, it will nevertheless be delivered at a cost.\n\nInformation provider 6 b: 0.2/20 kbyte=0.01Îµ/kbyte, which is greater than the transport costs, so that data will be delivered at no cost.\n\nInformation provider 6 c: 0.3/120 kbyte=0.0025Îµ/kbyte, which is less than the transport costs, so that, whilst the data is subsidised, it will nevertheless be delivered at a cost.\n\nTurning to FIG. 7, this additional refinement to the ranking process means that the search listings can be further categorised for selection by the userâinto âfreeâ portion 604, âsubsidisedâ portion 601 and âfully chargedâ portion 603 within web page W1â².\n\nIn another arrangement the bid criteria 207 specified by any given information provider 6 a, 6 b, 6 c can include data indicative of the amount of money that the information provider is willing to pay so as to cover transmission of data to any given mobile terminal; for example, assuming the bid criteria 207 corresponding to information provider 6 a specifies that all delivery costs will be covered, the web page W1â³ appears as shown in FIG. 8.\n\nReturning to FIG. 5, data indicative of the actual cost to the subscriber to receive data from the selected information provider 6 c are transmitted to the billing system 16 at step S5.17, preferably before the data are transmitted from the information provider, so that the subscriber's balance can be âtopped upâ to cover the subsidised costs.\n\nFIGS. 9 and 10 show the steps involved for an example in which the search request relates to âhotels in Londonâ: FIG. 9 relates to the case where the information source submits bid criteria so as to influence the position of the information source in the search results, but does not agree to subsidise access to their site, and FIG. 10 relates to the case where the information source both submits bid criteria so as to influence the position of the information source in the search results and at least some of the information sources (corresponding to hotel2 and hotel3) agree to subsidiseâeither partly or fullyâthe transport costs associated with accessing data from their site. These two examples clearly show the effects of weighting the bid amounts in accordance with the amount of data to be transmitted and subsidising subsequent requests to access data from the information sources.\n\nFIG. 11 relates to the case in which the amount of subsidy specified by the information provider in relation to transport costs is related to their bid amount (i.e. the amount that the information source has bid for the purposes of achieving a preferential ranking position in the search results transmitted at step S5.9). In one arrangement the bid criteria submitted by the information source specifies a transport subsidy as a percentage of the bid amount (this being submitted via the search broker 8 in the manner described above), and in the specific example shown in FIG. 11 the transport subsidy is specified as 40% of the bid amount.\n\nIn each of FIGS. 9, 10 and 11, the web page W1â² transmitted to the mobile terminal 2 only shows search results corresponding to web sites that have been determined as free to access (portion 604) (in addition to the non-sponsored web sites (portion 603)). It can clearly be seen from these examples that the list generating software component 405 orders the search results in accordance with profit associated with any given information source.\n\nAdditional Details and Modifications\n\nWhilst in the above embodiments the search engine 10 is described as having access to the storage and/or transmission characteristics in addition to the bid criteria, in an alternative arrangement the distributed information system 1 could include an additional network component, arranged to store the storage and/or transmission characteristics, and to receive search results, ranked in accordance with conventional methods, from the search engine 10, and to then factor in the storage and/or transmission characteristics. Thus in this alternative arrangement the ranking process comprises separate stages, performed at different logical devices, rather than comprising a single integrated process.\n\nAs described above, an information provider can store content and/or promotional data, and accordingly can be hosted or sponsored by an advertiser.\n\nThe search requests submitted at step S5.1 can be submitted from a terminal other than the one to which the search results are to be delivered; for example, requests could be submitted as part of an automated process, which includes, as one of the input fields, an identifier corresponding to the terminal 2 destined to receive the search results. In addition, search requests could be typed in or entered via speech recognition software.\n\nAs described above, each record Ri in the search database 20 corresponding to an information provider can comprise a field relating to an account balance for the information provider. The balance is quantified in terms of resources, which can be money or usage of communications services. The latter type of resource would be particularly convenient for the arrangement in which transportation costs are factored into the ranking process, since communications resources could be directly traded rather than being translated into and out of financial amounts.\n\nIn the case where the information provider specifies âfree accessâ and the transport costs are higher than the Îµ/kbyte associated with the downloaded content, all actual delivery costs will be subtracted from the corresponding account balance field 209 when a given URL is selected.\n\nWhilst in the above embodiments the ranked and categorised search results are delivered to a mobile terminal, the search results could alternatively be transmitted to a search results service, for further processing of the results or delivery thereof to the mobile device.\n\nIn addition to the bid criteria described above, the information source can submit data indicative of an overall, or specifically allocated, budget. In addition, whilst it is preferably that the search listings, network location and key words are related, any given information provider can specify a link to a network location that is unrelated to the keywords (e.g. an information source providing information in relation to the key words âhotels Londonâ can specify links to network locations unrelated to these keywords).\n\nBy way of clarification, the term ânon-sponsored Linkâ is to be understood as including (but not limited to) a link to a network location associated with an information source whose ranking in a list of search results is defined purely on the relevance of the content of the web page to key words related thereto and is unrelated to any bid amounts associated therewith.\n\nThe term âsponsored linkâ is to be understood as including (but not limited to) a link to a network location associated with an information source whose ranking in a list of search results is dependent on bid amounts relating to the position of the link in the list of search results. However, in general the term does not refer to subsidizing access to content associated with any of the links listed in the search results.\n\nThe term âsubsidized accessâ is to be understood as including (but not limited to) part of the bid amount, the amount of the subsidy being dependent on the parameters available for the purposes of providing subsidised or free access to a network location associated with an information source. In addition the term âsubsidized accessâ can cover, wholly or in part, the costs of associated with accessing data from the network location associated with the information source. The term âbid criteriaâ is to be understood as including (but not limited to) criteria for use in determining how a bid amount can be used to provide subsidised access to a network location associated with an information source.\n\nThe above embodiments are to be understood as illustrative examples of the invention. It is to be understood that any feature described in relation to any one embodiment may be used alone, or in combination with other features described, and may also be used in combination with one or more features of any other of the embodiments, or any combination of any other of the embodiments. Furthermore, equivalents and modifications not described above may also be employed without departing from the scope of the invention, which is defined in the accompanying claims.\n\nClaims (25)\n\nThe invention claimed is:\n\n1.
