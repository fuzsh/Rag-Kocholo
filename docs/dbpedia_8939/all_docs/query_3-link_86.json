        "text": "After a night relaxing in Kanagawa with my good buddy, Kentaro Osaki (just so you know, his dad is awesome), I came back to Tokyo to sign the contract! Finally, after all this time, after jumping through all the hoops, I was going to finally sign my apartment.\n\nI took the Denentoshi line from Kanagawa to Shibuya, then the Chuo line to Nakano.\n\nHello Mr. Zetes! We heard back from the guarantor company and everything is ok.\n\nGreat! I was so excited to finally sign the-\n\nPlease come back in tomorrow to sign the contract and give the initial payment\n\nOk, another day waiting couldn’t hurt. I had better things to do today, anyway.\n\nFor one thing, I had plans to meet…\n\nThis Guy!\n\nShunsuke is a year above me at Aoyama Gakuin University (“Aogaku”), where I am going to study for the next year. We actually met last year, when I was supposed to go to Aogaku before, but pulled out at the last minute. We still kept in contact throughout the year; he seemed like a pretty nice guy and offered to show me around Tokyo anyway, even if he wasn’t officially assigned to me this year.\n\nShibuya station is one of the closer stations to Aogaku, so we met there at the legendary “Hachiko Meeting Point.”\n\nAnd then that awkward moment when you meet someone from the internet in real life.\n\nShunsuke is a really nice guy, though. We talked in a mix of Japanese and English, and he showed me around the Aogaku campus.\n\nThe Aoyama Gakuin campus is pretty beautiful, but it is really small as you can see from the map. It’s probably around one-quarter the size of my alma mater. He showed me the gym, the international exchange center and a couple of class buildings. We were in the middle of summer vacation, so there were very few students around.\n\nOne thing that was surprising to me was that Aogaku is known as the protestant university of Tokyo, and has a school of divinity to ordain protestant pastors in theology. There’s even a statue of the bible pointing to Hebrews 13 (the main image of this post).\n\nIt looks like a great campus, with great people, and I can’t wait to start taking classes here.\n\nProbably more interested than the Aogaku campus, is the area around the campus:\n\nOmotesando (表参道)\n\nOmotesando is just one stop from Shibuya, and is known as a pretty ritzy area. When I walked around I could almost feel the money draining out of my pockets. There are some cool areas around there, though, some quiet back streets that contrast with the posh, high-class roads and stores that line Omotesando Avenue, but I will write more about those in the future.\n\nAfter walking around a bit, Shunsuke invited me to meet his friend Kota. We were just supposed to say hello, but Kota ended up taking us to this real hole-in-the-wall cafe that was supposed (read: failed to) resemble a New York style. It was a really cool place, and we ended up talking about life, our passions, and I helped Shunsuke plan his itinerary for his trip to Boston in the near future.\n\nKota is an interesting guy. He’s 22, full of energy and charisma, and is working hard to create an advertising company. I think Kota belongs an emerging entrepreneurial class in Tokyo that is on its way to change Japan. The tsunami in March 2011 (what Japanese refer to as “3/11”), really shook up many Japanese. We know the horrors of what happened in the North East of Japan, but Japan amazed the world in the solidarity its people exhibited in helping and supporting each other throughout the difficulties.\n\nIt was around that time that many Japanese started to wake up, much like the housing crisis in the USA did for us, and see that there wasn’t a guaranteed, secure way to live one’s life: working at a company, being loyal to the company, and the company taking care of you till you retired. Many Japanese are starting to take a more independent, entrepreneurial road for their futures. I’ve met many such people in Seattle, and I’ve been impressed by the entrepreneurial spirit of the men I’ve had the honor of knowing.\n\nKota and I talked about the difficulties of running a business, finding a niche, and what success for a business really means. When I asked him why he wanted to start his own business, he said:\n\nI want to create something on my own. Something I can call mine. I don’t want to walk in the footsteps of someone else.\n\nWell said, my new friend.\n\nI have been so blessed by the people I’ve met, by the opportunities I’ve had so far even though I haven’t been in Japan even two weeks yet. I was not sure why I decided to come to Tokyo, and I’m not sure even now, but I know that this next year is going to be one wild ride, and I’m ready to take advantage of it."
