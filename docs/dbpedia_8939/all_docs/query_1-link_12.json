        "text": "ABOUT AOYAMA GAKUIN\n\nAoyama Gakuin traces its origins to a school founded in 1874 by Dora Schoonmaker, a Methodist missionary from the United States, with the help of Tsuda Sen, a Japanese Christian. In 1878 Julius Soper opened the Koukyou Gakusha Boy's School and the following year the Methodist Mission Seminary (Mikai Theological Institute) was established by Robert S. Maclay. These are the earliest foundations of what later became Aoyama Gakuin.\n\nToday Aoyama Gakuin has separate institutions at every level from kindergarten through graduate school and serves over 23,000 students. It is a member of the Association of Christian Schools in Japan (Kirisutokyo Gakko Kyouiku Doumei).\n\nThe present Junior High School was established in 1947 as a three-year coeducational school in accord with Japan's postwar restructuring of its educational system. In 1986 it was joined with the Senior High School to form Aoyama Gakuin Junior-Senior High School. The Junior High School moved into new buildings on its campus in 2017.\n\nThere are up to 768 students 12 to 15 years old in three grade levels. About half of the student body comes by recommendation from the Aoyama Gakuin Elementary School, and half enter by examination at the first-year level.\n\nMore than 95% of the graduates of the Junior High School continue on to Aoyama Gakuin Senior High School. In principle all Junior High graduates in good standing may continue to the Senior High, where they will form the new incoming class together with students who enter the Senior High by examination. More than 80% of the graduates of the Senior High enter Aoyama Gakuin University or Aoyama Gakuin Women's Junior College.\n\nOUR EDUCATIONAL MISSION"
