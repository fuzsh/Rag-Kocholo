        "text": "Introduction to Aoyama Gakuin\n\nSince 1874, the founding spirit of Aoyama Gakuin, which is based on the Christian faith, has succeeded in becoming a living tradition. As a comprehensive educational institution comprising schools from the kindergarten through the graduate school, we will continue our efforts to implement various types of educational reforms aimed at character building in the truest sense so that our graduates can contribute to modern day society.\n\nHistory of Aoyama Gakuin\n\nAoyama Gakuin is a Christian school with Methodist roots.\n\nIt is one of the oldest schools in Japan, with a history of more than 140 years, and it has held fast to its Christian education.\n\nDuring that time there have been many hardships.\n\nEach time, all teachers and staff members have worked hard to achieve the growth that we see today. The present Aoyama Gakuin was formed by combining the previous Girls' and Boys' Schools in 1927.\n\nThe university was established in 1949, turning Aoyama into an integrated campus encompassing the kindergarten through the graduate school.\n\nCampus\n\nAoyama Campus\n\nAoyama Campus is conveniently located within walking distance from Omotesando Station on the Tokyo Metro and Shibuya Station on JR, Tokyu, Keio, and Tokyo Metro.\n\n\"Aoyama Campus has been the main site of Aoyama Gakuin since its foundation and the home of the kindergarten, the elementary school, the junior and senior high school, the eleven university schools and colleges in the fields of humanities and social sciences.
