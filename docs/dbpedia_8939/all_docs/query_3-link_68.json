The embroidered ceremonial flag has dark green background with a gold and silver symbol mark in the center and gold fringe. In 1952, the university's school emblem was decided after soliciting designs from students. The shield comes from \"faith as a shield\" (Ephesians 6:16) and represents the symbol of faith. A and G are the initials of Aoyama and Gakuin.\n\nZachary Harden, 7 July 2023\n\nSystem flag\n\nimage by Shunsuke Omachi, 21 March 2023\n\nThe embroidered ceremonial flag has dark green background with a gold and silver symbol mark in the center and gold fringe. The symbol mark is a beautiful design of a laurel tree and the words \"TOKYO AOYAMA GAKUIN\" on a shield, which is the basic prototype of the university emblem, and is thought to be based on the winning flag design adopted in 1906.\n\nNozomi Kariyasu, 21 March 2023\n\nSport flags\n\nimage by Shunsuke Omachi, 17 October 2023"
