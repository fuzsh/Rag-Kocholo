Aoyama Gakuin University is an educational and research institution based on the Educational Policy of Aoyama Gakuin which is to serve God and persons, contributing to society as the Salt of the Earth and Light of the World.

Our institution nurtures persons who, with a sound understanding based on global perspectives, possess the wisdom and strength with which to discover and solve issues personally. This is achieved through a wide range of barrier-free academic research that pursues service and commitment to humanity.

With respect for one another and the traditions of our institution, all faculty members, personnel, and students are making an effort towards the creation of a university that is able to respond to the needs of its era.
