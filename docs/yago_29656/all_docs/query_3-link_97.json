        "text": "The annals of history are brimming with captivating individuals, each with their own remarkable tale to tell. One individual who stands out is Alice Roosevelt, the eldest daughter of former President Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nRenowned for her razor-sharp sense of humour, bold demeanour, and unparalleled uniqueness, Alice has created a lasting impression that extends beyond her time in the White House. Her life exemplifies how fortitude, bravery, and a refusal to fit in can leave a lasting impact on the world.\n\nThe early years\n\nAlice Lee Roosevelt was born into a world stained by death. The oldest child of President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt and socialite Alice Hathaway Lee made her grand entrance on February 12, 1884, in the Roosevelt family home at 6 West 57th Street in New York City.\n\nTragically, the new mother passed away just two days after giving birth as a result of undiagnosed kidney failure that the pregnancy had concealed. And because life likes to kick you when you’re down, Teddy’s mother, Martha Stewart Bulloch, had also succumbed to typhoid fever only hours earlier."
