The only child of Theodore Roosevelt and his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee, she was a teenager when her father assumed the presidency, and she enlivened the White House with her charm, irreverence, and rambunctious independence. In 1906 she married Representative Nicholas Longworth in a White House ceremony. For many decades she was a famous Washington hostess, noted for her knowledge of all things political, her outspoken opinions and often caustic wit, and her influence as a powerbroker.\n\nSee her autobiography (1933); M. Teague, ed., Mrs. L: Talks with Alice Roosevelt Longworth (1981); biographies by J. Brough (1975), H. Teichmann (1979), C. Felsenthal (1988), and S. A. Cordery (2007).\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press. All rights reserved."
