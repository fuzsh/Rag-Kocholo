        "text": "It was a heartbreaking Valentine’s Day for future President Theodore Roosevelt on February 14, 1884. He was working in New York trying to get a government reform bill passed when he heard the news that he needed to head home right away. His brother reportedly exclaimed when he returned home, “There is a curse on this house. Mother is dying, and Alice is dying, too!” Soon his mother, Martha, died from typhoid fever. Just hours later, his wife, Alice, died of a kidney ailment called Bright’s disease after giving birth to their daughter, also named Alice, two days prior.\n\nRoosevelt could not handle his grief. He left politics and took his daughter Alice to live with his sister, Bamie. He headed out West and lived as a rancher and a sheriff for two years while dealing with his heartbreak. In his downtime, he ordered people never to mention his wife’s name and started getting more passionate about reading and writing about history. In 1886, he decided to return to New York after a blizzard had wiped out his entire herd. He got back to work in politics and started raising his daughter.\n\nOf course, we know what happens next. In 1900, he was named William McKinley’s vice-presidential running mate. When McKinley was assassinated in 1901, Roosevelt took over as President and lived in the White House for the next eight years.\n\nHis daughter grew up and while she loved her father, she admitted that she did resent him for abandoning her in the first years of her life. Things got worse for Alice when he re-married and she received five half-siblings.\n\nShe became a bit wild and Roosevelt once admitted, “I can either run the country or I can control Alice, but I cannot possibly do both.” After his run as President ended, she was eventually banned from visiting the White House after she reportedly made a voodoo doll of First Lady Taft and buried it in the front lawn.
