        "text": "March 28, 2022\n\nI can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly DO BOTH.~Theodore Roosevelt\n\nAlice Roosevelt was involved in Washington politics for decades. She assisted her father with his campaigns, was married to a congressman and Speaker of the House, and circulated in the social scene into her eighties. She was a firecracker and was said to carry her pet snake, Emily Spinach, in her purse. She travelled the world to help her father and his administration. Her boundless energy often caused gossip, but she was likely Teddy's favorite of his six children. It makes you wonder what heights she might have achieved had she been born fifty or possibly one hundred years later than she was. This picture book bio does a great job showing us what Princess Alice was like. Another book I have enjoyed featuring this fascinating woman is American Princess: A Novel of First Daughter Alice Roosevelt.\n\nFebruary 18, 2010\n\nThe charming, humorous illustrations really won me over and are my favorite part of this story about Teddy Roosevelt's oldest daughter, who \"ate up the world\" one (generally improper) adventure at a time yet became the darling of the world and dubbed \"Princess Alice.\" I think it's a really interesting book to share with children in terms of the discussion that could follow--should Alice be seen as a brave young lady who defied the stifling conventions of society or as a disobedient daughter who caused her father a great deal of trouble--or both? Did Alice have any goals in terms of bettering women's role in society, or was she merely out to have a good time? Lots of room for interpretation here! :-) Alas, I got this from the library and, as has happened to me in the past, the extremely annoying library binding process taped the dust jacket to the cover so I could not read all of the historical notes printed on the inside back cover--gurr!--but the research I could make out seems quite good.\n\nSeptember 29, 2012\n\nWhat young ladies were not meant to do, Alice did or wanted to do. In the early 1900's, proper young ladies did not \"galavant\" to all hours of the night, drive a car willy nilly about town, dress like a tom boy and bet on horse races. Alice Roosevelt felt to compunction to behave as a proper young lady, despite her famous fathers urging to do so. Alice was indeed a free spirited and adventurous young lady, much beloved by her father and a loving daughter and confidante to him. Her antics were, for the time, outrageous to some and entertaining to others. By todays standards, her funloving spirit and zest for life would not be so unusual, but in her day, she was considered something of an enigma. Newspapers were filled with stories of her adventures, much to her fathers consternation, but readers delighted in them. This book about Alice Roosevelt is a splendid delight as well.\n\nSeptember 6, 2013\n\nA great children's biography that is entertaining and educational for the younger/middle grade set (and their parents). My daughter and I both loved the book. She didn't know anything about Alice Roosevelt, and I loved that she picked out the book by herself \"because it looks like a great story, Mommy!\" I loved the pictures and the action depicted in them. The story kept moving, just like Alice did. Definitely a read again book.\n\nJanuary 25, 2009\n\nThe illustrations really make this book. They’re full of the same zest that Alice exhibited. They’re perfect for this book. This is a fun history book for kids. They’ll be able to relate since the biography picture book covers Alice from birth to old age, and does not skimp on her childhood. While the pictures are what I loved, the story did make Alice and her times really come alive.\n\nAugust 14, 2010\n\nThis book made me smile. I love the illustrations! This is one of my favorite parts:\n\n\"Instead of going to school, Alice was taught at home, with lots of time for exploring. In New York City, she watched the students of Miss Spence's boarding school walk oh-so-primly down the sidewalk. That didn't look like much fun to Alice...She came up with her own solution for her education. She said to Father, 'Let me loose in your library.' She taught herself astronomy, geology, even Greek grammar. She read Twain, Dickens, Darwin, and the Bible, cover to cover. Every morning she told Father what she had learned the day before.\"\n\nMarch 23, 2018\n\nBarbara Kerley, accompanied by Edwin Fotheringham's delightful illustrations, writes about one of the most remarkable women of the 20th century: Alice Roosevelt. Kerley writes about Alice's exploits, her relationship to her father, and her many accomplishments in the early part of the century starting from when she was a little girl and continuing until her marriage to Nicholas Longworth.\n\nBoth Kerley's text and Fotheringham's illustrations reflect the essence of Alice herself: energetic, vibrant, and colorful. The change in fonts to emphasize words or quotes and the often quirky illustrations create a vibrant, whirlwind experience in reading the book. In one scene, five Alice's romp through the library, with direct paths showing her maze of motion, and the accompanied text is silhouetted by a moosehead gazing out at the havoc.\n\nKerley also shows an excellent eye to quotes, sprinkling accurate, sourced quotes throughout the text that aptly sum up Alice, such as the facetious and famous, \"I can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both\" (p. 25). Fotheringham's illustrations are a delight, making Alice a larger-than-life figure with adventures on every page. In one scene, she chases after her brother with a leg brace, face pursed and determined as he flees. In another, she gleefully sails down the stairs on a serving tray. Fotheringham's stylization of Alice recalls old Hollywood star Katherine Hepburn: a classic beauty who gives the impression of quick wit and whip-smart intellect. Kerley's recountings of her many adventures during her life bears this out.\n\nHowever, in order to keep the tone light and fun, Kerley may give the impression of Alice being happier than she was, when in Kerley's own author's note, she acknowledges historical evidence that Alice never felt a part of her family, and her own father's refusal to call her by her name or acknowledge her in her early years due to the death of her mother. Though she glances on this in the author's note, the illustrated text certainly does not give the full story and may paint a not-entirely-accurate story through omission.\n\nAdditionally, the decision to stop at Alice's marriage, beyond a glancing \"she still ate up the world\" (p. 40) also erroneously gives the impression that Alice ceased being as fun when she married Nicholas Longworth. If nothing else, it was a disappointment not to see the aged Alice's quip, \"If you haven't got anything good to say about anybody, come sit next to me\" depicted in the text, even if it was included in the author's note.\n\nThe author's note itself gives more context to the story and Alice, including the full-text of a letter excerpted in the main portion of the book, and several quotes that could not make it into the story. A section listing where children - or adults - could go for more information about the irrepressible Alice would have been appreciated.\n\nAside from these problems, What to Do About Alice? is a faithful recounting of the life of a truly remarkable woman, and the book excels in embodying the spirit of its subject through well-chosen quotes, details, and lively illustrations.\n\nApril 15, 2021\n\n3.5 out of 5\n\nWhat to Do About Alice?: How Alice Roosevelt Broke the Rules, Charmed the World, and Drove Her Father Teddy Crazy! is an entertaining picturebook biography of Alice Lee Roosevelt, the daughter of Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th president of the United States. What a feisty personality!\n\n\"I can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly DO BOTH.\"\n\n--Theodore Roosevelt\n\nEdwin Fotheringham's bold, quirky, and dynamic illustrations nicely enhance -- sometimes by contradiction! -- Barbara Kerley's informative yet lively text, creating a fun reading experience.\n\nIf you are borrowing a copy of What to Do About Alice? from a local library, make sure the dust jacket isn't taped over the endpapers, because the back endpapers offer some additional information about the life of Alice Lee Roosevelt.\n\n\"If you haven't got anything good to say about anyone, come and sit by me.\"\n\n--Alice Lee Roosevelt\n\nJanuary 14, 2009\n\nTotally delightful. This story is funny without being cheesy. The text is sort of okay-to-good, and it pleased me by retaining most of its momentum even after Alice grows up (not many children's biographies can do that, which is probably why they published that whole series of Childhood of Famous Americans). But the pictures are terrific--they have a slight Jazz Age feel, and an amazing sense of movement (especially the picture of Alice in the library, and the dockworkers loading the boat full of her souvenirs of Asia).\n\nIt's hard to compare this with the pure gorgeousness of the illustrations in We Are the Ship, but I think these might be more kid-friendly. I'd be pleased to see it somewhere on the Caldecotts. According to a spreadsheet I got from Kathy Baxter, this got more starred reviews than any other children's or YA book this year--at least through November.\n\nSeptember 15, 2014\n\nThis is one of the shorter Sibert honor books, but still manages to pack a lot of information in about Alice, daughter of Teddy Roosevelt. The author's note at the end adds a LOT to the information presented in the book. Alice was a feisty, energetic girl who loved to \"eat up the world\" and who caused her father all sorts of headaches. She was also well-loved by much of the public, helped her father's popularity, and became one of his most-trusted political advisers. She sounds like quite the girl! I enjoyed learning about her. My favorite illustration is Alice in her father's library, taking care of her own education after refusing to go to a boarding school to learn to become a proper lady.\n\nFebruary 9, 2021\n\nI found this ridiculously entertaining, and I think that a picture book is just about the right amount of time to spend with Alice. I think she is hilarious in small doses, but would get annoying to spend any real amount of time with.\n\nNovember 17, 2019\n\nAlice Lee Roosevelt - eldest daughter of Theodore Roosevelt - was quite the character: always up to mischief, always involved in an adventure, always causing a sensation! From the time she was a little girl, when she refused to do something as conventional as attend Miss Spence's exclusive New York City boarding school for girls, to her days as a young woman traveling abroad, Alice was someone to be reckoned with - a reality best summarized by her father's comment, during his presidency, that \"I can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly DO BOTH.\"\n\nI enjoyed this picture-book biography of a figure that was very well-known in her own day - dubbed \"Princess Alice,\" she was often in the newspaper for her various antics, and was a true celebrity - although I do wonder, from the little I have read, whether the \"real\" Alice Roosevelt was such a happy person. Leaving that aside, What to Do About Alice? does introduce younger readers to a historical figure about whom they probably know little, and Edwin Fotheringham's illustrations have a frenetic energy that suites the fast-paced narrative. Recommended to young biography lovers, and to anyone who appreciates stories about feisty girls.\n\nAugust 24, 2013\n\nThe whole time I was reading this book I couldn't get \"How do you solve a problem like Maria?\" out of my head. :)\n\nRead\n\nMarch 31, 2022\n\nI can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly DO BOTH.~Theodore Roosevelt\n\nAlice Roosevelt was involved in Washington politics for decades. She assisted her father with his campaigns, was married to a congressman and Speaker of the House, and circulated in the social scene into her eighties. She was a firecracker and was said to carry her pet snake, Emily Spinach, in her purse. She travelled the world to help her father and his administration. Her boundless energy often caused gossip, but she was likely Teddy's favorite of his six children. It makes you wonder what heights she might have achieved had she been born fifty or possibly one hundred years later than she was. This picture book bio does a great job showing us what Princess Alice was like. Another book I have enjoyed featuring this fascinating woman is American Princess: A Novel of First Daughter Alice Roosevelt. *Review by Darla from Red Bridge*\n\nNovember 10, 2010\n\n\"What To Do About Alice?\" is a delightful book about a girl who defined herself and lived life to the fullest. The book tells about the life of Alice Roosevelt, the daughter of former president Theodore Roosevelt. As the subtitle says, Alice broke the rules, charmed the world, and drove her father, Teddy, crazy. Her mother died when she was only two days old and it made everyone sad, but Alice wasn't growing up sad and she didn't want to be called \"The Poor Little Thing.\" The book tells about her many adventures, because she wanted to try new things, read new things, go new places and generally do lots of things that were not considerate appropriate for a girl at that time. While the book focuses on all the trouble she got into, the author still conveys the message that along the way she won the adoration of many people she met and was an ambassador and support for her father and later her congressman husband.\n\nI loved the adjectives and silly phrases the author used to describe Alice and her adventures. The author's choice of words certainly helped create a vision in my mind of what Alice must have been like. The illustrations also added to that vision. There were often multiple pictures on a page, or pictures within pictures which gave the feeling of how she was always on the go. Teachers could use this book in any first through fifth grade classroom. There are many different things a teacher could use as a focus. It could be used as a biography, but would be a model for how creatively a biography can be written. It would lend itself to discussions about how our behaviors can bring different reactions from different people. Alice is a role model as a strong woman who was not defined by the \"rules\" of the times or people around here. In my first grade classroom, I would love to spend some time expanding vocabulary with all the new and fun words this author used. It would be fun to decide as a class what expressions like \"eating up the world\" or \"running riot\" meant. We could expand the activity by coming up with some expressions we've heard or make up some of our own.\n\nNovember 8, 2009\n\nFor ages 8 and up, this book is a pure delight. Readers familiar with Eleanor Roosevelt's life and charms will discover quite a contrasting personality in her cousin, Alice Roosevelt, Teddy Roosevelt's only daughter by his first wife, Alice Lee. The sub-title says it all: How Alice Roosevelt Broke the Rules, Charmed the World, and Drove her Father Teddy Crazy!\n\nThe story revolves around contrasts. Teddy Roosevelt--big-game hunter, former cowboy/ranch hand, battle tested leader of the Rough Riders, President of the United States--complaining from the White House: \"I can be president of the United States, or I can control Alice. I cannot possibly do both.\" The sadness of her mother's death when Alice was just two days old is contrasted with young Alice's drive to bounce as high as possible, to have a pet monkey, and to turn the tables on the gender issue by joining a boys-only club.\n\nBarbara Kerley's amusing text is elevated by Edwin Fotheringham's illustrations. The whole style of the visual presentation matches the era, right down to the use of sensationalistic fonts at appropriate moments. When Kerley describes Alice devouring her father's library, Fotheringham's illustration captures the girl's energy even in her academic pursuits. This book is an excellent example of text and illustration working perfectly together.\n\nMore contrasts enter the story when Alice is able to play helpful roles in policy and win over key diplomats, at the same time she makes the headlines in a fashion that would make today's celebrities jealous. She could be impossible, yet indispensible; exasperating, yet entrancing.\n\nAfter her marriage in the White House (to a congressman who later rose to be Speaker of the House), Alice Roosevelt Longworth remained a force in politics (sometimes greatly feared) for decades. Children who find they don't fit neatly into social categories may well find inspiration in this book. Just steer them clear of that famous quote from Alice, later in her life: \"If you can't say something good about someone, sit right here by me.\"\n\nFebruary 28, 2009\n\nThis is a brief child-friendly bio of one of the most impetuous first daughters ever to grace the White House. Alice Roosevelt, daughter of Teddy, was a fun loving vivacious girl. She seemed to be full of impulsive ideas, but in a sweet an innocent way.\n\nI loved the shades of muted primary colors in the pictures and the warmth and inviting tone it set while telling the story of Alice and her ups and downs as the president’s daughter and sometimes representative of the United States.\n\nIt left me wanting to learn more about Alice.\n\nThis was an honor book in the Mock Caldecott at the 2009 Provo Library event\n\nNovember 30, 2016\n\n1) Book summary, in your own words (3 pts)\n\nThis book is about the daughter of Teddy Roosevelt.

A great way to find out books you may not have heard of. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed it and finding out “How Alice Roosevelt Broke the Rules, Charmed the World, and Drove Her Father Teddy Crazy!” Barbara Kerley really captured Alice’s energy and the spirit- even Edwin Fotheringham’s illustrations were exuberant!\n\nApril 8, 2015\n\nI loved this book! Alice is great role model for high-spirited young ladies everywhere. I checked this out because the authors of Hissing Cousins:The Untold Story of Eleanor Roosevelt and Alice Roosevelt Longworth cited it as their inspiration for writing their own book.\n\nApril 9, 2018\n\nGenre: Biography\n\nUnique Feature: One unique feature of this book is the language that is used and how the story is told. When reading this book aloud, the story and the words fit together perfectly as if the book was meant to be read aloud. The author brings in a sense of humor and lightheartedness to the text which matches the delightful illustrations.\n\nGrades: This book would be best utilized in grades 3rd-8th.\n\nApril 28, 2017\n\nThis book was the 2009 Robert F. Sibert Medal honor book for best informational books for children. I never knew much about Alice Roosevelt Longworth until I read this book--and now I want to read more. I never realized what a celebrity she was, and how she helped her father, the President. I'd have given this book 5 stars but I didn't like the illustrations much. Nevertheless, recommended.\n\nApril 22, 2018\n\nHer name was Alice. Alice Lee Roosevelt was hungry to go places, meet people, do things! Father called it running riot. Alice called it eating up the world. Whether she was entertaining important White House visitors with her pet snake or traveling the globe, Alice bucked convention and turned every new experience into an adventure! I really like Alice! she is funny and adventurous!!\n\nMay 30, 2008\n\nThis is truly fantastic! The text flows, bounces, jumps, runs, creates havoc -- just like Alice -- and just like the illustration. Wow. Such fun reading and looking at it -- and learning about a pretty remarkable woman in history! My 4th grade students LOVE this book :)\n\nSeptember 1, 2011\n\nThis is the kind of biography I like! Lots of pictures and written for children :) Alice Roosevelt was quite a lively lady. I wonder what the grown-up books say about her?\n\nFebruary 10, 2020\n\nIn What To Do About Alice by Barbara Kerley, we learn the story about Alice Roosevelt; the daughter of President Theodore Roosevelt. This book is a biography about her life and the adventures she went on, all while being in the spotlight for being the daughter of a president. It tells her story growing up as the daughter of Teddy all the way up to her adult life. Alice was the talk of the town as she broke stereotypes and stigmas and paved her own path in life.\n\nI think this book would be fantastic in a 3rd grade classroom as it shows students that you may be told that you have to be a certain person or act a certain way but you should not feel restricted by those boundaries. Alice took risks and put herself in a way that women had never seen before, but did she care? Nope! Alice was a revolutionary of her time. As a teacher, I could show them that it’s okay to be different. Individuality and being unique are an important part of being yourself and that’s not something that we should suppress.\n\nAnother part of this book I liked was how the pictures are very detailed and show a lot when the text may not. The text for each page is short but there’s a lot to analyze in the picture provided. It really shows students that a picture is worth a thousand words!\n\nThis was a WOW book for me because it showcased an important person in History who I had never considered before. Alice Roosevelt was an extraordinary being and she did so much that at the time was considered radical but she was just having fun!\n\nNovember 19, 2020\n\nWhat to Do About Alice?: How Alice Roosevelt Broke the Rules, Charmed the World, and Drove Her Father Teddy Crazy! is a children's picture book written by Barbara Kerley and illustrated by Edwin Fotheringham. Theodore Roosevelt's irrepressible oldest child receives an appropriately vivacious appreciation in this superb picture book.\n\nAlice Lee Roosevelt Longworth was an American writer and prominent socialite. She was the eldest child of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt and the only child of Roosevelt and his first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee.\n\nKerley' text is rather simplistic, straightforward, and informative. Kerley's precise text presents readers with a devilishly smart, strong-willed girl who was determined to live life on her own terms – and largely succeeded. Backmatter includes an author’s note. Fotheringham creates the perfect mood from the start: his stylish digital art sets a fast pace, making use of speed lines and multiple vignettes to evoke characters in perpetual motion.\n\nThe premise of the book is rather straightforward. It outlines Alice Roosevelt Longworth's childhood and its increasingly outrageous hijinks – and there were many, as well as the loving, albeit exasperating relationship she enjoyed with her renowned father – Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nAll in all, What to Do About Alice?: How Alice Roosevelt Broke the Rules, Charmed the World, and Drove Her Father Teddy Crazy! is a gleeful celebration of a fully, unapologetically led life."
