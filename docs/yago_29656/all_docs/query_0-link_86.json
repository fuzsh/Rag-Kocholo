        "text": "Alice Roosevelt Longworth (born February 12, 1884, New York, New York, U.S.—died February 20, 1980, Washington, D.C.) was an American socialite and daughter of U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who was known for her wit and her political influence.\n\nAt the time of Alice Roosevelt’s birth, her father was a New York assemblyman. Her mother died two days after her birth, and during her father’s long absence in Dakota Territory she was reared by an aunt. After her father’s marriage in December 1886 to Edith Kermit Carow and the establishment of the family seat at Sagamore Hill in Oyster Bay, Long Island, she grew up in a home of wealth, tradition, and politics.\n\nWhen her father became U.S. president in 1901, Alice Roosevelt became the center of national attention. Headstrong and rebellious and with a pronounced taste for the society of aristocrats and the Gilded Age wealthy, she was a favorite topic for the press, which slavishly recorded the comings and goings, the defiance of conventions, and the acid comments on contemporaries of “Princess Alice.” Her reported favorite color, a shade of blue-gray, became widely popular as “Alice blue” and later inspired the song “In My Sweet Little Alice Blue Gown” (by Joseph McCarthy and Harry Tierney), introduced in the musical Irene (1919). In February 1906 she married Ohio Rep. Nicholas Longworth.\n\n(Read Eleanor Roosevelt’s Britannica essay on Franklin Roosevelt.)"
