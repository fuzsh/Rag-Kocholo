        "text": "The U.S. has had its fair share of rebel teens in history, but an original American wild child grew up in the White House.\n\nAlice Roosevelt Longworth, the eldest daughter of 26th President Theodore Roosevelt, was of fascination to the entire nation and remains so to this day.\n\nBeautiful, intelligent, hilarious and outspoken, Longworth was coined the \"original wit of Washington\" by presidential historian and Reagan biographer Craig Shirley.\n\nROBERT MESNIER, WHITE HOUSE PASTRY CHEF FOR FIVE PRESIDENTS, PASSES AWAY AT 78\n\n\"Nobody has even come close to Alice Roosevelt Longworth [in history],\" Shirley said in a video interview with Fox News Digital.\n\nLongworth, nicknamed \"Princess Alice,\" reportedly nagged at her father for wanting to be \"the bride at every wedding, the baby at every baptism and the corpse at every funeral.\"\n\n\"But, of course, she loved attention, too,\" Shirley said.\n\nLongworth made a name for herself due to her shocking antics, such as carrying around a pet boa constrictor named Emily Spinach — often worn around her neck — and for smoking on the roof of the White House.\n\n\"She had no filter and she didn’t care. And she did it with wit and verve.\"\n\nAt 17 years old, she became a media spectacle for racing her car up and down the streets of Washington, chewing gum, playing poker, wearing pants, sleeping until noon and partying all night long with the Vanderbilts, according to All That's Interesting.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 30, 1967, THURGOOD MARSHALL IS CONFIRMED TO SCOTUS AS FIRST BLACK JUSTICE\n\nHer behavior shocked the public, as these tendencies were something presidential daughters of the early 20th century — or women, period — simply didn’t do.\n\n\"She broke the mold and then split it into a million pieces,\" Shirley told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"Presidential families, and especially daughters, were supposed to be quiet and low key and polite — and she was none of them.\"\n\nShirley explained that Longworth was the first to say \"whatever was on her mind\" and even kept a pillow with a needle-point message that read, \"If you haven’t got anything nice to say about anyone, come and sit here by me.\"\n\nPRESIDENTS DAY: GREAT ADVICE FROM GREAT US PRESIDENTS FOR MODERN-DAY AMERICA\n\n\"She had no filter and she didn’t care,\" he said. \"And she did it with wit and verve.\"\n\nWhen concerns were brought to the president’s attention about his carefree daughter, Teddy Roosevelt famously admitted that he could not control Alice and run the country at the same time.\n\nWhile some of the public despised her antics, much of the nation adored its casual first daughter.\n\nYet Longworth didn’t care either way, according to Shirley.\n\n\"She was in the newspapers all the time,\" he said. \"She was a gossip.\"\n\n\"She was not only the original TMZ — she was probably the inspiration for TMZ.\"\n\nShirley mentioned that Longworth’s erratic behavior was always accompanied with class and elegance, including her ability to \"cut down a man as soon as look at him.\"\n\n\"She had no precepts against hurling insults against her opponent, or some of her friends, for that matter.\"\n\n‘Already a handful’\n\nLongworth was born on Feb. 12, 1884, by virtue of Teddy Roosevelt’s first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt, who died two days after their daughter was born.\n\nRoosevelt’s own mother died that same day.\n\nON YELLOWSTONE'S 150TH ANNIVERSARY, 150 FASCINATING FACTS ABOUT AMERICA'S FIRST NATIONAL PARK\n\nTorn with grief, Roosevelt spent two years exploring the mountain west region of the U.S. as a cowboy, Shirley noted.\n\n\"That’s where he learned a lot about life and it helped prepare him to become the president,\" he said.\n\nDuring this time, a young Alice lived with her aunt, Anna Roosevelt, until her father got remarried — to Edith Kermit Carow in 1886.\n\nLongworth was first introduced to the White House at 17 years old in 1901, the year her father was elected commander-in-chief. Throughout her father's years as president (1901-1909), Longworth grew her reputation for antics and for being naturally outspoken.\n\nBut Shirley said the first daughter was born with rebellious tendencies.\n\n\"She was already a handful,\" he said. \"[Roosevelt] never complained about his other children, but he was honest and frank about Alice — she was a handful.\"\n\nLongworth's behavior has been pinned to the early 20th century suffrage movement, as a reaction to America's changing perspective of womanhood.\n\nWHY IS PABLO PICASSO SO FAMOUS? A LOOK AT THE 20TH CENTURY'S MOST INFLUENTIAL PAINTER\n\nWedding bells\n\nAlice Roosevelt married House Speaker Nicholas Longworth, R-Ohio, on Feb. 17, 1906, according to the Theodore Roosevelt Center at Dickinson State University.\n\nThe wedding ceremony took place in the East Room of the White House.\n\nThe couple's marriage lasted 25 years until Nicholas Longworth died in 1931.\n\nWhen asked if she’d like to be buried next to her husband in Ohio, Alice responded that it would be a \"fate worse than death,\" according to Shirley.\n\nRoosevelt Longworth only had one child in 1925 — a child conceived in an alleged affair with Sen. William Borah, R-Idaho.\n\nThe illegitimate daughter, Paulina Longworth Sturm, had nothing of her mother’s outspoken energy.\n\n\"She was actually meek and mild and very, very polite,\" Shirley said. \"She was nothing like her mother.\"\n\nBanned from White House\n\nEven after Teddy Roosevelt left the White House, Longworth continued to wreak havoc on Washington, according to accounts.\n\nLongworth was kicked out of the Woodrow Wilson White House for \"making cracks\" about the 28th president at his expense, according to Shirley, and for burying a voodoo doll of first lady Edith Wilson on the White House lawn.\n\nShe was also banned for smoking in the White House, which infuriated her; she even launched a one-woman lobbying campaign against Wilson’s League of Nations proposal.\n\n\"And she may have sunk it to defeat just by her own efforts,\" Shirley said.\n\nLongworth had a five-story mansion on Massachusetts Avenue; various lawmakers and politicians would visit and try to court her, Shirley said.\n\nON THIS DAY IN HISTORY, AUGUST 26, 1939, MLB GAME BROADCAST ON TV FOR FIRST TIME\n\nShe kept a close relationship with Richard Nixon and remained in the news until at least his second term as president.\n\n\"If she was president, she either would’ve been impeached or she would’ve been on Mount Rushmore,\" Shirley commented.\n\nThe first daughter went on to write an autobiography in 1933 called \"Crowded Hours,\" airing out the dirty political laundry of her time.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLongworth lived to be 96 years old.\n\nShe died in 1980 of emphysema.\n\nShe remained a smoker her entire life."
