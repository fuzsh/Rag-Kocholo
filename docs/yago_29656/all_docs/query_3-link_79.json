He was the second born out of four children who included his older sister Anna, younger brother Elliott and younger sister named Corinne. Elliott was the father of the First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, wife of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. As a young boy Teddy suffered from severe asthma, which had a huge impact on his body and health. Roosevelt was homeschooled and would eventually entered Harvard College on September 27, 1876. When Roosevelt was 22 years old he married Alice Hathaway Lee and enrolled in Columbia Law School. They had a daughter named Alice Lee Roosevelt who was born on February 12, 1884. Alice died two days after their baby was born from kidney failure. Roosevelt’s mother also died the same day as Alice hours earlier in the same house. Theodore left baby Alice in the care of his sister Anna in New York City while he took time to grieve. He then assumed custody of his daughter when she was three. Roosevelt didn’t last long in Columbia; instead he decided to join the New York State Assembly as a representative from New York City. After the death of his mother and wife Roosevelt spent the next two years on a ranch he owned in the Dakota Territory, where he hunted, drove cattle and worked as a frontier sheriff. Upon returning to New York, he married his childhood sweetheart, Edith Kermit Carow on"
