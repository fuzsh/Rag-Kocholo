        "text": "Though the huggable “Teddy bear” was named after him, Theodore Roosevelt (1858–1919), who served as the president of the United States 1901 and 1909, strove for a life that embodied his ideal of assertive masculinity. He was at various times an outdoor sportsman, explorer, western rancher, and soldier, as well as an aggressive political leader and writer on history and public affairs.\n\nWhile the American people had ample opportunity to observe Roosevelt’s public side, he kept his personal relationships extremely private. These letters reproduced here show an aspect of Roosevelt’s life seldom seen by the public.\n\nRoosevelt established a residence in the nation’s capital during his six years with the U.S. Civil Service Commission. But his family also spent time at Sagamore Hill, their Long Island residence, during Washington, D.C.’s sweltering summers in the era before air-conditioning. Bound by duties in Washington, D.C., Roosevelt sent these letters to his young son, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., who could not yet read but would understand the pictures.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt’s seven surviving pocket diaries provide a unique insight into the inner man. On 13 February 1880, an ecstatic Roosevelt recorded his great joy, because the woman of his dreams, Alice Hathaway Lee, who he had actively courted for more than a year, had finally accepted his proposal of marriage. Knowing that his love was reciprocated and that he could now “hold her in my arms and kiss her and caress her and love her as much as I choose” gave the enraptured young Roosevelt enormous satisfaction.\n\nOn February 14, 1884, Theodore Roosevelt received a terrible blow-both his wife and mother died within hours of one another in the Roosevelt house in New York City. His mother, age 50, succumbed to typhus, and his wife Alice died at the age of 22 giving birth to her namesake. The following diary entries lovingly describe his courtship, wedding, happiness in marriage, and his grief over the death of his wife Alice, after which he never spoke of the union again. Roosevelt’s seven surviving diaries provide a unique insight into the inner man.\n\nDuring William M. “Boss” Tweed’s stewardship of Tammany Hall, he acquired almost total control of New York City Democratic politics and managed to loot the city’s coffers of between $50,000,000 and $200,000,000. The New York Times entered into one of the toughest journalistic fights in New York history when it published editorials questioning how “Boss” Tweed and his associates managed to acquire such vast wealth. At first the Times lacked hard evidence, but a Tweed rival provided the newspaper with copied pages from the Ring’s secret books detailing the extent of corruption, as reported in this November 20, 1873, edition of the paper. Tweed was sentenced to twelve years in prison and fined $12,500, but served only twelve months after paying a $250 fine. Later, he was rearrested in connection with a $6,0000,000 civil suit. Tweed fled to Spain where he was identified from a Thomas Nast cartoon, apprehended, and escorted back to the United States.\n\nThe Spanish-American War, a brief but vicious campaign that left 240 Americans dead and 1,400 wounded, was waged in 1898. American artist William Glackens was sent to Cuba to capture the action for McClure’s Magazine. Published at a time when photographers had made documentary sketch artists virtually obsolete, Glacken’s work represents the apotheosis of American graphic journalism.\n\nEl Pozo is one of five drawings produced by William Glackens used to illustrate an eyewitness account as reported in the October 1898 issue of McClure’s Magazine of the assault on San Juan Hill, overlooking Santiago, Cuba. Glackens was the only artist sent by the magazine to cover the Spanish American War fought in the spring and summer of 1898. His sketches in the field capture the atmosphere and mood of this short-lived war. After the war, Glackens’ concentrated on his art, gaining renown as a member of what came to be known as the “Ashcan School” of American painters.\n\nA talented artist and self-promoter of the first order, Frances Benjamin Johnston made a place for herself and paved the way for other women in the emerging field of photojournalism when she began making portraits and photographs for magazines and newspapers in 1889. She exhibited with the leading Pictorialist art photographers between 1898 and 1901 but returned to magazine and news work until about 1910, when then she turned to garden and architectural photography.\n\nUsing her parents’ social connections and her own talent and initiative, Johnston earned the title “The American Court Photographer” by photographing the administrations of Presidents Harrison, Cleveland, McKinley, Roosevelt, and Taft between 1889 and 1913. President Theodore Roosevelt’s children Quentin and Archie provided some of her most appealing photo opportunities.\n\nPhotographs of The Hampton Institute for display in Paris at the World’s Exposition in 1900 form one of Johnston’s most famous photojournalism assignments. Forty of the 150 photographs she produced in December 1899 appeared in the April 1900 issue of The American Monthly, timed to coincide with the opening of the Fair. “Mechanical Drawing” is one of the 150 images that emphasize the importance of progressive education and vocational training at the school.\n\nIn the 1880s George Pullman built the town of Pullman near Chicago to manufacture his famous railway sleeping cars. All buildings, homes, and stores in the town were owned and rented to the workers. By 1894, the Pullman Company had declining sales and lay off hundreds of workers, and reduced the salaries of others. On May 7, the workers asked for lower rent and were flatly refused. The American Railway Union was formed and led by Eugene V. Debs. By June 26, railroad workers around the country began to strike. On July 3, President Grover Cleveland, declares striking a federal crime and orders federal troops to forcibly disperse the striking works. On July 7, troops, standing face to face with strikers, open fire killing thirty-four workers. By August 3, the strike was declared over by police, and Debs and others were imprisoned. Six days later, the U.S. Congress makes Labor Day a National Holiday.\n\nOriginally published as the cover for the July 6, 1916, issue of Leslie’s Weekly with the title “What Are You Doing for Preparedness?” this portrait of “Uncle Sam” went on to become—according to its creator, James Montgomery Flagg—“the most famous poster in the world.” Over four million copies were printed between 1917 and 1918, as the United States entered World War I and began sending troops and matÃ©riel into war zones.\n\nFlagg (1877–1960) contributed forty-six works to support the war effort. He was a member of the first Civilian Preparedness Committee organized in New York in 1917 and chaired by Grosvenor Clarkson. He also served as a member of Charles Dana Gibson’s Committee of Pictorial Publicity, which was organized under the federal government’s Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel.\n\nBecause of its overwhelming popularity, the image was later adapted for use in World War II. Upon presenting President Franklin Delano Roosevelt a copy of the poster, Flagg remarked that he had been his own model for Uncle Sam to save the modeling fee. Roosevelt was impressed and replied: “I congratulate you on your resourcefulness in saving model hire. Your method suggests Yankee forebears.”\n\nUncle Sam is one of the most popular personifications of the United States. However, the term “Uncle Sam” is of somewhat obscure derivation. Historical sources attribute the name to a meat packer who supplied meat to the army during the War of 1812—Samuel (Uncle Sam) Wilson (1766–1854). “Uncle Sam” Wilson was a man of great fairness, reliability, and honesty, who was devoted to his country—qualities now associated with “our” Uncle Sam. James Montgomery Flagg (1877–1960)\n\nWith the storm of war brewing behind her, a personification of America sleeps. She wears a Phrygian cap, a symbol of liberty since Roman times. This poster tells all of America to wake up and do their part for the war effort.\n\nWhen they met in November 1934, photographer Dorothea Lange (1895–1965) and economist Paul Taylor (1895–1984) made a formidable team of advocates for improving living conditions of migrant laborers. Their illustrated reports provided clear accounts of the systemic causes of the problems and the need for governmental response. Lange herself selected, cropped, printed, mounted, and captioned the photographs in the reports. Her captions incorporate the very words of the people pictured, telling their own stories.\n\nArmed with these forceful reports, H.E. Drobish, director of California’s Rural Rehabilitation Office of the Emergency Relief Administration, stated in his request for federal funding to build housing camps for workers:\n\n“These laborers stand at the foot of the socioeconomic scale in our state....These are the ‘forgotten men, women, and children’ of rural California but on these people the crops of California depend.”\n\nBetween 1935 and 1943, Lange and other top-caliber photographers hired by Roy Stryker of the Resettlement Administration produced what was to become the world’s best-known photographic survey, the Farm Security Administration (FSA) collection. These report albums came to the Library of Congress as part of that collection when it was transferred from the FSA in the 1940s.\n\nEstablished in the administration of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the Federal Theatre Project (FTP) was part of the Works Progress Administration and was active from 1935 to 1939. It was administered entirely by, and was wholly a function of, the Federal government and was intended to provide employment for theater professionals during the Great Depression. FTP productions included plays, musical revues, vaudeville, dance, children’s theater, puppetry and circus performance. There were also black theater, and Yiddish, French, German, Italian, and Spanish language presentations. There has been nothing comparable to it since.\n\nOrson Welles (1915–1985) was only twenty-one when he directed, designed costumes for, and appeared in the title role of The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus. The 1937 FTP production of Christopher Marlowe’s rarely staged Elizabethan play was, artistically, one of the most notable productions in the history of the American theater. Welles’s highly innovative use of costumes, lighting, and a series of trapdoors resulted in a production in which the sense of black magic and damnation was all-pervasive.\n\nAlthough the set design was very simple, the production was given intense visual effect through powerfully dramatic lighting and splendid costume coloring. The cardinal’s vivid costume with its luxurious folds was designed to stand out against an essentially black thrust stage that was punctuated from the sides and above with a complex arrangement of lights. Welles also designed the costume for Faustus’s assistant Wagner.\n\nDoctor Faustus is thought to be the only instance in which Welles designed costumes for the theater. It is also an early instance of racially integrated casting. Jack Carter, whose elegant and austere Mephistopheles contrasted mightily with the explosive Faustus of Welles, had appeared as Macbeth in the 1936 all-black production of Shakespeare’s play, often known as the “Voodoo Macbeth” (also directed by Welles for the FTP in New York City).\n\nIn another FTP production, Welles directed and appeared as Mugglethorpe in Horse Eats Hat adapted by Welles and Edwin Denby from the 1850s French farce Un chapeau de paille d’Italie.\n\nThe Library’s Federal Theatre Project Archives consist of a wide variety of materials documenting the stage productions actually mounted or considered by FTP companies. The archives include scripts, often elaborately marked to function as production guides, costume and set designs, posters, photographs, playbills, and publicity materials.\n\nSome of the designs are thought to have come from vaudeville presentations, and are attributed to James Stewart Morcom. Like many FTP professionals, he had a successful later career. Morcom designed for the New York City Ballet and was with the Radio City Music Hall for many years.\n\nOne of the highly regarded writers whose work was seen often in FTP theaters was Eugene O’Neill, who allowed FTP a special royalty rate. The FTP produced O’Neill’s The Emperor Jones in several cities, including a production with marionettes in Los Angeles in 1938.\n\nIn 1935, the first year of radio network broadcasts of Major Bowes’ Amateur Hour, more than thirty thousand acts auditioned for the talent contest program. One of the successful acts was the “Hoboken Four.” The vocal quartet auditioned as “Frank Sinatra and the 3 Flashes,” but was renamed, purportedly by Major Bowes himself. The act won the competition of the September 8, 1935, broadcast and joined one of Major Bowes’s traveling vaudeville units. Sinatra soon left the tour to strike out on his own.\n\nThe Library holds a copy of nearly every radio and television network broadcast of the Amateur Hour program, which ran until 1970, and every successful application form for contestants on the radio series.\n\nOther Amateur Hour performers represented in the collection who went on to achieve stardom include Robert Merrill, Regina Resnik, Beverly Sills, Gladys Knight, Pat Boone, Jack Carter, Dorothy Collins, and Ann-Margret. Many believe that Maria Callas appeared on the radio program, but research has not substantiated this rumor.\n\nIn addition to holding the most extensive radio broadcast collection in the country (nearly three-quarters of a million recordings), the Library of Congress offers researchers unparalleled print documentation of the medium. The NBC Radio Collection at the Library includes hundreds of thousands of scripts, business correspondence, bound press releases, and programming documentation.\n\nThis annotated script of a December 7, 1941, news report on the bombing of Pearl Harbor includes the announcer’s markings for emphasis. The NBC “program analysis” index card outlines all of the network’s news broadcasts of that day, including the break in regularly scheduled programming to announce the tragic news from Pearl Harbor.\n\nOther NBC documentation now at the Library outlines nearly every program heard over the network throughout World War II, including the debates which preceded our entry into the war. Described in detail, for example, are programs aired in 1941 devoted to the Fight for Freedom Committee, which promoted intervention and aid to Britain, as well as programs devoted to the isolationist America First Committee.\n\nRecordings of more than half of these programs are also in the collections of the Motion Picture, Broadcasting and Recorded Sound Division, Library of Congress. The Library’s radio collections provide not only the means to monitor the progress of World War II as experienced on the home front, but, through the extensive Armed Forces Radio and Television Service Collection, to hear American entertainment and information as heard by the fighting American forces abroad.\n\nThe microphone pictured was used by Joseph Nathan Kane to broadcast his Famous First Facts radio series of 1938.\n\nAmerica’s unofficial national anthem was composed by an immigrant who left his home in Siberia for America when he was only five years old. The original version of “God Bless America” was written by Irving Berlin (1888–1989) during the summer of 1918 at Camp Upton, located in Yaphank, Long Island, for his Ziegfeld-style revue, Yip, Yip, Yaphank. “Make her victorious on land and foam, God Bless America...” ran the original lyric. However, Berlin decided that the solemn tone of “God Bless America” was somewhat out of keeping with the more comedic elements of the show and the song was laid aside.\n\nIn the fall of 1938, as war was again threatening Europe, Berlin decided to write a “peace” song. He recalled his “God Bless America” from twenty years earlier and made some alterations to reflect the different state of the world. Singer Kate Smith introduced the revised “God Bless America” during her radio broadcast on Armistice Day, 1938. The song was an immediate sensation; the sheet music was in great demand. Berlin soon established the God Bless America Fund, dedicating the royalties to the Boy and Girl Scouts of America.\n\nBerlin’s file of manuscripts and lyric sheets for this quintessentially American song includes manuscripts in the hand of Berlin’s longtime musical secretary, Helmy Kresa (Berlin himself did not read and write music), as well as lyric sheets, and corrected proof copies for the sheet music.\n\nThese materials document not only the speed with which Berlin revised this song, but also his attention to detail. The first proof copy is dated October 31, 1938; the earliest “final” version of the song is a manuscript dated November 2; and Kate Smith’s historic broadcast took place on November 11. These documents show the song’s step-by-step evolution from the original version of 1918 to the tune we now know.\n\nThese manuscripts are part of the Irving Berlin Collection, a remarkable collection that includes Berlin’s personal papers as well as the records of the Irving Berlin Music Corp. It was presented to the Library of Congress in 1992, by Berlin’s daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, Linda Louise Emmet, and Elizabeth Irving Peters.\n\nIn August 1942 President Franklin Delano Roosevelt appointed W. Averell Harriman (1891–1986), head of the American Lend-Lease Program, to represent the United States at a conference with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin. The Moscow conference sought a common understanding of Soviet and Anglo-American military plans in the war against Hitler’s Germany and was the highest level meeting to that time of the three allies.\n\nAt the conference Churchill delivered some unwelcome news. He told Stalin that Western military planners had concluded that an Anglo-American invasion of Europe that year was military folly. The Soviets, however, desperately wanted a “second front” to relieve Nazi pressure. (By that time German forces had taken much of the western Soviet Union and held Leningrad under siege.)\n\nIn response to Churchill’s announcement, Stalin gave Harriman the memo reproduced here, one of the few documents with Stalin’s handwritten signature (lower right) extant in the West.\n\nIn it Stalin deplored the decision and argued that British and American forces were capable of invading Europe in 1942. In an attempt to break the joint British-American stance, Stalin also worded the memo to imply that the decision was a British one. (Churchill, however, spoke for the United States as well as his own country in this decision.)\n\nThis memo illustrates the sometimes difficult nature of the American-Soviet alliance during the war. Harriman’s position as head of Lend-Lease in London and, from 1943, ambassador to the Soviet Union placed him at the center of this demanding alliance. The copious memoranda, letters, cables, and personal notes in Harriman’s papers make them an indispensable source of historical documentation of that relationship as well as of the Cold War diplomacy that followed.\n\nOn December 7, 1941, during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Mess Attendant Doris “Dorie” Miller came to the aid of his shipmates on the U.S.S. West Virginia, helping to move the injured out of harm’s way, including the mortally wounded captain. Though untrained in its use, Miller also manned an antiaircraft machine gun, downing several Japanese planes before being ordered to abandon the sinking ship. Miller’s courage and devotion to duty at Pearl Harbor earned him the Navy Cross, the first ever awarded to an African American sailor. This honor is even greater in light of the fact African Americans were only allowed to serve in the messman’s branch of the Navy at the time. Though later killed in action in 1943, Miller’s legacy of bravery in the face of great danger and discrimination lives on.\n\nIn March 1945, Toni Frissell took more than 280 photographs of the “Tuskegee Airmen,” the elite, all-African American 332nd Fighter Group at Ramitelli, Italy. The group was commanded by Colonel Benjamin O. Davis, Jr, who later became the first three-star general in the Air Corps. The Tuskegee Airmen flew more than 700 missions and never lost a bomber to enemy aircraft. They earned more than 744 Air Medals and Clusters, more than 100 Flying Crosses, 14 Bronze Stars, 8 Purple Hearts, a Silver Star, and a Legion of Merit. This photo records a member of the group is being given an “escape kit” containing cyanide in the event of capture in Yugoslavia.\n\nJoe Rosenthal’s Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph taken on the Pacific island of Iwo Jima is one of the best-known war images ever made. The Allies invaded the island, more than six hundred miles off the coast of Japan, on February 19, 1945, hoping to establish a staging area for bombers. Rosenthal, a photographer for the Associated Press, landed under gunfire three hours after the invasion began. The Marines fought their way to the top of Mount Suribachi on February 23 and raised a small flag. Later that same day, five Marines and a naval medicine corpsman raised this second, larger flag at the summit and were recorded by Rosenthal. Contrary to popular belief, the moment was not staged. In thirty-one days of brutal fighting, 6,821 Americans died, including three of the flag-raisers. Rosenthal inscribed this print to Wyoming Democratic Senator Joseph O’Mahoney.\n\nIn August of 1945, service members in the Pacific Theater were dreading an invasion of Japan. Infantryman William T. Livingston saw fierce action in the Philippines and survived the ravages of tropical diseases, including malaria and dengue fever. In one of 462 letters home, he describes the elation that quickly ensued after news reached his unit of the war’s end. News of the war’s end dominated the front pages of newspapers coast to coast, as did the headlines that gas rationing would cease. Private First Class Livingston would go on to serve as part of the occupying force in Japan for five months.\n\nGeneral Douglas MacArthur was one of the most prominent U.S. military figures of the first half of the twentieth century. Beginning as a combat officer in World War I, MacArthur’s military career reached its pinnacle after his victorious Pacific campaign during World War II with his appointment as Supreme Allied Commander charged with presiding over the Japanese transition to democratic self-rule. MacArthur’s career came to a close during the Korean War, but as recognition of his status as one of the nation’s greatest living military leaders, Congress asked him to address a joint session. MacArthur closed his speech with a famous line from an old army ballad: “Old soldiers never die, they just fade away.”\n\nAuthor, educator, and political philosopher Hannah Arendt was born into a German Jewish family in KÃ¶nigsberg, now Russian “Kaliningrad.” After being arrested in 1933, Arendt fled her homeland, moving from Prague to Geneva then to Paris, and finally to the United States in 1941. In 1946, she wrote that she understood that “the infinitely complex red-tape existence of stateless persons” inhibits freedom of movement. This denial of the right of citizenship led Arendt on a exploration of the origins of totalitarianism that would dominate her intellectual life.\n\nIn 1949 Arendt used this well-worn affidavit of identity “in lieu of a passport, which I, a stateless person, cannot obtain at present.” Also seen here is Arendt’s draft of the introduction to the third edition of Origins Of Totalitarianism, her first major book.\n\n“At the going down of the sun and in the morning\n\nWe will remember them”\n\n—Laurence Binyon “For the Fallen”\n\nThe Vietnam Veterans Memorial, originally designed as a student project by Maya Lin at Yale University’s School of Architecture in 1981, has become a profound symbol that has served to unify and reconcile a nation sorely divided by a foreign entanglement. Lin envisioned a black granite wall, in the shape of a V, on which the names of the American military dead and missing would be inscribed. The architect hoped that “these names, seemingly infinite in number, [would] convey the sense of overwhelming numbers, while unifying these individuals into a whole.”\n\nSince its unveiling in 1982, the work—popularly known as “the wall”—has become a point of reference, inspiring a new generation of American memorials. Maya Lin’s drawing is one of 1,421 design-competition submissions documented in the Library of Congress as part of the Papers of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund.\n\nArchitect/artist Paul Stevenson Oles recalled about his role in the initial phase of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial: â. . . shortly after we had learned our entry had not been selected as the winner, I received a frantic telephone call . . . from the competitionâs Professional Advisor Paul Sprieregen, informing me that the drawings of the winnerâs original submission were so vagueâbeautiful, indeed, but highly ambiguous. . . . He asked me if I could produce, say, three drawings for the purpose of explaining Maya Linâs design, in a hurry . . . In those heady hours, Maya asked, shyly, if âshe could be included in the picture.â I agreed, conditionally, if she would be willing to appear on the arm of the illustrator (center drawing).â"
