Thee and the other Roosevelt men ready themselves with guns to protect their possessions from the mostly poor, immigrant rioters.\n\n1872\n\nTravels to Egypt\n\nThee takes the family on a long trip through Egypt. T.R., having just learned to hunt and eager to show his father his manly fitness, shoots birds and game all along the banks of the Nile.\n\nNov 1873\n\nReturn to New York\n\nHaving spent several months in Germany, the fifteen-year-old T.R. returns to New York and prepares to enter society.\n\nSep 27, 1876\n\nHarvard College\n\nT.R. begins his studies at Harvard College.
