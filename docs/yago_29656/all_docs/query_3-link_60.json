        "text": "Behind every great man, there is a greater woman—in Theodore Roosevelt's case, five women.\n\nO’Keefe, the CEO of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, offers illuminating portraits of the women—Martha Bulloch Roosevelt, Anna Roosevelt Cowles, Corinne Roosevelt Robinson, Edith Kermit Carow Roosevelt, and Alice Hathaway Lee—who helped mold one of the most significant political figures of the 20th century. The author’s exhaustive research is evident, and his prose brings vitality and nuance to his subjects. Relying on a treasure trove of family letters and other archival documents, O’Keefe succeeds in proving his thesis about the Roosevelt women's centrality in shaping the bombastic president, but the execution is uneven. Some speculation is required to flesh out the motives and desires of Martha, the Roosevelt matriarch, and Alice, Roosevelt’s first wife. Tragically, Alice's presence in her husband's life was brief (she died at age 22), and what little is known of her thoughts comes from a cache of letters preserved by her daughter. Given that most of Alice's correspondence was deliberately destroyed following her death, the author is forced to rely on other scholars' musings about a variety of topics, including Alice's purported influence on Roosevelt's Harvard thesis on women's suffrage and her rationale for accepting his marriage proposal. O'Keefe finds better footing when chronicling the life of Edith, Roosevelt's childhood friend and second wife, and Anna and Corinne, his two sisters, for whom there is a lifetime of correspondence. The author amply demonstrates how Anna repeatedly picked up the pieces of her brother's life when tragedy struck; how Corinne was his political sounding board; and how Edith created the modern First Ladyship while curating public knowledge about her marriage and her husband's legacy.\n\nFor fans of presidential history, a fascinating celebration of women who helped make an iconic president.\n\nA former New York City dancer reflects on her zesty heyday in the 1970s.\n\nDiscovered on a Manhattan street in 2020 and introduced on Stanton’s Humans of New York Instagram page, Johnson, then 76, shares her dynamic history as a “fiercely independent” Black burlesque dancer who used the stage name Tanqueray and became a celebrated fixture in midtown adult theaters. “I was the only black girl making white girl money,” she boasts, telling a vibrant story about sex and struggle in a bygone era. Frank and unapologetic, Johnson vividly captures aspects of her former life as a stage seductress shimmying to blues tracks during 18-minute sets or sewing lingerie for plus-sized dancers. Though her work was far from the Broadway shows she dreamed about, it eventually became all about the nightly hustle to simply survive. Her anecdotes are humorous, heartfelt, and supremely captivating, recounted with the passion of a true survivor and the acerbic wit of a weathered, street-wise New Yorker. She shares stories of growing up in an abusive household in Albany in the 1940s, a teenage pregnancy, and prison time for robbery as nonchalantly as she recalls selling rhinestone G-strings to prostitutes to make them sparkle in the headlights of passing cars. Complemented by an array of revealing personal photographs, the narrative alternates between heartfelt nostalgia about the seedier side of Manhattan’s go-go scene and funny quips about her unconventional stage performances. Encounters with a variety of hardworking dancers, drag queens, and pimps, plus an account of the complexities of a first love with a drug-addled hustler, fill out the memoir with personality and candor. With a narrative assist from Stanton, the result is a consistently titillating and often moving story of human struggle as well as an insider glimpse into the days when Times Square was considered the Big Apple’s gloriously unpolished underbelly. The book also includes Yee’s lush watercolor illustrations.\n\nA blissfully vicarious, heartfelt glimpse into the life of a Manhattan burlesque dancer.\n\nThe iconic model tells the story of her eventful life.\n\nAccording to the acknowledgments, this memoir started as \"a fifty-page poem and then grew into hundreds of pages of…more poetry.\" Readers will be glad that Anderson eventually turned to writing prose, since the well-told anecdotes and memorable character sketches are what make it a page-turner. The poetry (more accurately described as italicized notes-to-self with line breaks) remains strewn liberally through the pages, often summarizing the takeaway or the emotional impact of the events described: \"I was / and still am / an exceptionally / easy target. / And, / I'm proud of that.\" This way of expressing herself is part of who she is, formed partly by her passion for Anaïs Nin and other writers; she is a serious maven of literature and the arts. The narrative gets off to a good start with Anderson’s nostalgic memories of her childhood in coastal Vancouver, raised by very young, very wild, and not very competent parents. Here and throughout the book, the author displays a remarkable lack of anger. She has faced abuse and mistreatment of many kinds over the decades, but she touches on the most appalling passages lightly—though not so lightly you don't feel the torment of the media attention on the events leading up to her divorce from Tommy Lee. Her trip to the pages of Playboy, which involved an escape from a violent fiance and sneaking across the border, is one of many jaw-dropping stories. In one interesting passage, Julian Assange's mother counsels Anderson to desexualize her image in order to be taken more seriously as an activist. She decided that “it was too late to turn back now”—that sexy is an inalienable part of who she is. Throughout her account of this kooky, messed-up, enviable, and often thrilling life, her humility (her sons \"are true miracles, considering the gene pool\") never fails her.\n\nA juicy story with some truly crazy moments, yet Anderson's good heart shines through."
