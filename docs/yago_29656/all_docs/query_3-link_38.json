        "text": "“The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt: The Women Who Created a President”\n\nBy Edward F. O’Keefe\n\nc. 2024, Simon & Schuster\n\n$30.99, 464 pages\n\nIs it really better to have loved and lost, rather than to never have loved at all?\n\nAsk your average teenager and the answer would be a resounding and emphatic “no.” As an adult, though, Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s words likely have a wider meaning. In the game of love, you win some, you lose some, and in the new book “The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt” by Edward F. O’Keefe, your position in life matters not.\n\nThough he later had a reputation for adventure and derring-do, young Theodore Roosevelt was soft-hearted and gentle. His many illnesses may’ve had something to do with that; as an infant, he suffered from “cholera morbus” and other maladies; as a young boy, he took to his bed from many afflictions. Because he wasn’t rough-and-tumble like other boys, he had few playmates other than his siblings: oldest sister Bamie, younger sister Conie, brother Elliott, and a “bonus sister,” Edie Carow, who lived nearby.\n\nIn later years, Conie (who was the same age as Edie) would say that Edie and “Teedie” seemed destined to be together. When the Roosevelt family embarked on a trip to London, Teedie cried upon leaving his friend. He wrote Edie long letters while he was away at Harvard. He named his boat after her.\n\nAlas, says O’Keefe, on August 22, 1878, something happened between them, maybe a marriage proposal that Edie wasn’t prepared to accept. Roosevelt headed back to Harvard, brokenhearted, but not for long: not two months later, he met Alice Hathaway Lee.\n\nMuch has been written about Valentine’s Day of 1884, and the losses Roosevelt sustained. After the funerals, Roosevelt did what he always did: he left his home and threw himself into action – leaving behind a baby daughter and grieving families.\n\nBut he kept in touch with family, and in the fall of 1885, he was in New York, visiting with his daughter and Conie, when Edith Carow came to call. Accidentally or on purpose, the former crushes came face-to-face and “... within forty days of their reunion, they became secretly engaged.”\n\nChances are, if you know anything about our twenty-sixth President, you have an image of a manly-man, the hunting-camping-horseback type. He was like that, yes, but in “The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,” you’ll see a surprisingly marshmallowy TR.\n\nIndeed, author Edward F. O’Keefe presents evidence that Roosevelt had a downright soft side, and could actually be almost floral in his emotions. O’Keefe shares letters written by the future President that practically ooze with Victorian emotion, which knocks any old image you might have aside. Forget all that Rough Rider stuff; Roosevelt was a mushy romantic at his core, and while he did hold some typical late-nineteenth-century attitudes about women and race, he was also quite progressive, which is another pleasant shocker in this very fine book.\n\nObviously, this is a good tale for history fans and those who like unique biographies, and romance readers may find what they crave in it, too. Try “The Loves of Theodore Roosevelt,” and you’ll love it, too.\n\nBooks for Mental Health Awareness Month\n\nFrom various authors\n\nc.2024, various publishers\n\n$13.99 to $30, various page counts\n\nYou need a break. A good long rest, maybe a binge-watch session. You need a friend, someone to talk with and bounce ideas. For sure, you need a hug and maybe some help from any one of these books to mark Mental Health Awareness Month ...\n\nFrom author, politician, and mental health advocate Patrick Kennedy, Jr., with Stephen Fried, “Profiles in Mental Health Courage” (Dutton, $30) introduces you to people from all walks of life who are open, honest, and helpful in sharing their journeys with addictions, afflictions, and mental illness.\n\nHere, Kennedy briefly touches on his own issues with mental health, and he cites examples from history, but the heart of this book is its best. The authors’ interviewees speak about their families, their situations, what it’s like to live in their shoes, and what it took to ask for help. Allies tell their stories here, too, making this a book to share with everyone who needs to see it and anyone who needs the courage to take a step toward help.\n\nWhat’s it like to deal with mental illness and cultural issues at the same time? In “But What Will People Say?” by Sahaj Kaur Kohli, MA, LGPC (Penguin Life, $30), the founder of Brown Girl Therapy writes about caring for one’s self while also honoring a personal beliefs, background, and community. There is a space for people of color in therapy, self-care, and treatment, and that care integrates who you are. This important book assists in sorting options in a search for help, letting you be your best advocate.\n\nAnd finally, if you know a young person who’s struggling with mental health issues, look for “Puzzled: A Memoir About Growing up with OCD” by Pan Cooke (Penguin Graphic, $13.99).\n\nWritten in a graphic novel format, Cooke writes about how, at age ten, he began to have thoughts that alarmed him. What if, for instance, he said something out loud that he really didn’t mean? This anxiety led to fears, which led to rituals meant to soothe his overworked brain and he couldn’t stop with the behaviors. What’s worse, he got in trouble at school and with friends, and that just made things harder. He knew that there was a “missing piece” to this whole puzzle, and he had to find it.\n\nOne night, in the middle of the night, he woke up and went downstairs to his computer. He’d learned by then that he felt better if he had helpers. That’s when Cooke learned that his worry and anxiety had a name: obsessive compulsive disorder, or OCD.\n\nThis is a great book for readers age 9 and up, and adults can enjoy it, too. It’s easy to read, sometimes funny, and wonderfully relatable.\n\nAnd if these three books don’t offer the help you need, then be sure to ask your favorite librarian or bookseller for more. Mental health is an important topic and the shelves are full of books that explain, comfort, and education. One of them could be the break you need.\n\nMore Bookworm: ‘The Situation Room’ – inside the crisis\n\nAnd Bookworm: Take note – ‘The Jazzmen’ may send you searching your music library\n\nAlso Bookworm: ‘Living Constitutionally’ and ‘Selling the Dream’\n\nThe Bookworm is Terri Schlichenmeyer. She has been reading since she was 3 years old and never goes anywhere without a book. Terri lives on a hill in Wisconsin with two dogs and 11,000 books. Read past columns at marconews.com."
