The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again because there is no effort without error and short-comings, who knows the great devotion, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the high achievement of triumph and who at worst, if he fails while daring greatly, knows his place shall never be with those timid and cold souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\" ...Theodore Roosevelt 26th U.S. President. Speech at the Sorbonne, Paris, April 23, 1910.[1]\n\nPersonal\n\nTheodore Roosevelt, Jr was born in 1858 to Theodore \"Thee\" Roosevelt Sr. and Martha Bulloch. Teddy had 2 sisters and 1 brother. Their names were Anna, Corinne and Elliott. Anna and Teddy were extremely close and Teddy called her \"Bamie\". Theodore or \"Teedie\" as he was known by family, hated the nickname Teddy, grew up in New York City. He was mostly home-schooled due to his Asthma and other illnesses. He went to school at Harvard where he developed an interest in naval affairs.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt married his first wife Alice on 27th October 1880.[1][2][3] He was very excited about the birth of their first child also named Alice in February 1884. He lost his wife and mother on the same day, two days after the baby's birth. He left baby Alice in the care of his sister Bamie, (Anna's nickname) while he grieved over his losses in the West.\n\nHis second marriage to Edith Kermit Carow produced 5 children. Theodore knew Edith for most of their lives and had actually dated and were engaged before he met his first wife Alice.\n\nTheodore's hobbies included reading, hunting and protecting the environment. He also liked to box to build his physique. He especially loved to read science, nature, and hunting books because he found them very amusing and interesting.\n\nHe was considered a true American hero, the example that people should live by.\n\nCareer\n\nTheodore Roosevelt graduated from Harvard in 1880 and went on to Columbia Law School it was there where he dropped out to enter politics.\n\nHe published his first historical book in 1882 called The Naval War of 1812.\n\nAs a New York state legislator, he was appointed to the United States Civil Service Commission by Benjamin Harrison in 1888 and served until 1895. He worked as New York City Police Commissioner, for 2 years. He became Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1898 and and Colonel of the Rough Riders. Later in 1898 he became governor of New York.\n\nHe became Vice President of the United States and on 14th September 1901 when president William McKinley was assassinated he became the 26th president of the United States until 1909. He was 42.\n\nPresidency\n\nPresident Theodore Roosevelt’s interventionist foreign policy subverted the Constitution and helped transform America into the most powerful nation on Earth.\n\nDescribing his foreign policy, Roosevelt quoted a West African proverb: \"Speak softly and carry a big stick.\" As president, Roosevelt used \"big stick diplomacy\" to seize unprecedented executive power in handling international affairs.\n\nHe was the first world leader to make an argument to the Court of Arbitration at The Hague. He also was first to call for convening of what became the Second Hague Peace Conference at which he got the Latin American Nations to equal the rest of the world.\n\nWhen Roosevelt was president he tried to make the Republican Party more progressive, which included trust busting, and increasing the regulation of businesses.\n\nRoosevelt helped create the Panama Canal and negotiated an end to the Russo-Japanese war, which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nLater Years\n\nIn 1912 Roosevelt when on a expedition to South America, where he got malaria. The malaria damaged his health.[4]\n\nHe was a successful president, naturalist, historian, lawyer and explorer. He was also a member of the Freemasons and Sons of the American Revolution[5][6]\n\nIn 1918, his youngest son Quentin was killed in WWI.\n\nIt was 06 January 1919, when Theodore passed away from coronary embolism in his sleep at his home, Sagamore Hill. He was buried in Young's Memorial Cemetery at Oyster Bay, New York. [7][8][9][10][11]\n\nLegacy\n\n1998 - One hundred years after the Spanish American War, Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously the Medal of Honor.[12]\n\nHis image is carved on Mount Rushmore[13]\n\nRoosevelt County, Montana and Roosevelt County, New Mexico are both named in President Roosevelt's honor.\n\nSources\n\n↑ Marriage: \"Massachusetts, U.S., Marriage Records, 1840-1915\"\n\nNew England Historic Genealogical Society; Boston, Massachusetts; Massachusetts Vital Records, 1911–1915\n\nAncestry Sharing Link - Ancestry Record 2511 #3120690 (accessed 24 April 2024)\n\nTheodore Roosevelt (22) marriage to Alice H Lee on 27 Oct 1880 in Brookline, Massachusetts, USA.\n\n↑ Marriage: \"Massachusetts, U.S., Town and Vital Records, 1620-1988\"\n\nOriginal data: Town and City Clerks of Massachusetts.
