        "text": "Calvi, Mary. If a Poem Could Live and Breathe: A Novel of Teddy Roosevelt’s First Love. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 2023.\n\nISBN-13: 978-1250277831 | $28.99 USD | 320 pages | Historical Fiction\n\nBlurb\n\nA fact-based romantic speculative novel about Teddy Roosevelt’s first love, by Mary Calvi, author of Dear George, Dear Mary.\n\nStudded with the real love letters between a young Theodore Roosevelt and Boston beauty Alice Lee—many of them never before published—If a Poem Could Live and Breathe makes vivid what many historians believe to be the pivotal years that made the future president into the man of action that defined his political life, and cemented his legacy.\n\nCambridge, 1878. The era of the Gilded Age. Alice Lee sets out to break from the norms of her mother’s generation. Women are fighting for educational opportunities and exploring a new sense of intellectual and personal freedom. Native New Yorker, Harvard student Teddy Roosevelt, is on his own journey of discovery, and when they meet, unrelenting currents of love change the trajectory of his life forever.\n\nIf a Poem Could Live and Breathe is an indelible portrait of the authenticity of first love, the heartache of loss, and how overcoming the worst of life’s obstacles can push one to greatness never imagined.\n\nReview\n\n4 stars\n\nI received an ARC from the publisher via NetGalley and am voluntarily posting a review. All opinions are my own.\n\nI don’t know a ton about Theodore Roosevelt prior to picking up If a Poem Could Live and Breathe, beyond the “Bull Moose,” man’s man and 20th century Progressive politician personas he cultivated later in life, so the prospect of a book delving into his earlier life and first romance and marriage with Alice Lee seemed promising (especially as I had gleaned some inklings about how the tragedy of that relationship impacted his relationship with his tempestuous only daughter from that union, also called Alice). And Mary Calvi did a great job fleshing out what that young man may have looked like and following the trajectory of his relationship with Alice Lee.\n\nGiven that correspondence between Teddy and Alice survives, I love how that aspect is woven into the narrative, with some portions of the book allowing their letters to each other speak for themselves. And as the title suggests, this correspondence not only consists of those letters, but poetry as well. I love how this book explores the true romantic soul that quite possibly died with Alice.\n\nI also love how it explores who they are as people. Teddy is coming into his own as a young man, and he has yet to reach the heights we know he will reach. Alice is also a great partner for Teddy, being a champion of gender equality when women’s suffrage is a hot-button issue. Given Teddy’s later more Progressive leanings, it’s interesting to speculate how she may have influenced him.\n\nThe narrative not only follows them in the throes of their love and marriage, but also follows Teddy as he falls into his grief following Alice’s passing, and refuses to have her name said in his presence. These portions are the most moving, especially when you think about how, while he did move on, he likely never really got over this loss, and it impacted his relationship with his daughter.\n\nI will note the most engaging bits were probably the courtship parts, along with the bits from Teddy’s POV while grieving Alice. It falls into somewhat of a lull, pacing wise, after their marriage, but the story comes together and ultimately packs an emotional punch.\n\nI really enjoyed this book, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys historical fiction, especially about the lives of American presidents.\n\nAuthor Bio\n\nMARY CALVI is an author of historical fiction. Her upcoming book, IF A POEM COULD LIVE AND BREATHE: A NOVEL OF TEDDY ROOSEVELT’S FIRST LOVE, is based on never-before-published love letters to and from Roosevelt, which Calvi researched and transcribed from the originals. The publication is set for Valentine’s Day 2023 (St. Martin’s Press). Her in-depth research for her debut book, DEAR GEORGE, DEAR MARY: A NOVEL OF GEORGE WASHINGTON’S FIRST LOVE is the basis of a Smithsonian Channel documentary, airing now. Calvi is a 14-time New York Emmy® award-winning journalist, the morning news anchor for WCBS-TV, and national anchor for Inside Edition Weekend.\n\nWebsite\n\nBuy links\n\nBookshop (affiliate link)\n\nAmazon\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nGoogle Play"
