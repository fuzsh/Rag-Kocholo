        "text": "If a Poem Could Live or Breathe tells the story of Theodore Roosevelt’s first wife, Alice Hathaway Lee. Alice dreams of going to college to further her education. One day, she meets a junior at Harvard named Theodore Roosevelt. He falls immediately in love with her and begins to pursue her. This story chronicles the courtship, marriage, and tragedy of Theodore Roosevelt and Alice Lee.\n\nI knew a little bit about Edith Roosevelt, Theodore’s second wife. However, I did not know anything about his first wife. Yet, this novel was very illuminating. I found Alice to be very fascinating. She was strong-willed and spunky. I like how she was a feminist and was for women having an advanced education. Thus, I can see why she managed to capture the heart of the future President.\n\nTheodore was a very compelling and eccentric figure. It was interesting to see the younger and more romantic side of him. He was very loyal and passionate to Alice. He was also a very deep thinker and matched well with Alice. I like how Alice influenced and supported him. Thus, I really liked them as a couple, and I cried at their tragic end.\n\nOverall, If a Poem Could Live and Breathe is a coming of age novel. This was a heart-breaking love story. Both Theodore and Alice had a deep love for each other. It makes readers see another side of this legendary President. He is very sympathetic and human. I also like all of the other characters. They seem very complex. There were a few things I did not like about the novel. I thought that the story moved at a slow pace and seemed drawn out. I also thought the writing was somewhat dry and stilted. It was more like a nonfiction work than a novel. Nevertheless, it was meticulously researched. It was still an enjoyable and moving novel about first love. I recommend this for fans of American Princess, The President’s Lady, and The Kennedy Debutante!\n\n3.5⭐️ I found this to be a very interesting portrayal of Teddy Roosevelt and his first wife, Alice. It definitely leans heavily into the romantic and overtly sweet and poetic nature of their relationship. I enjoyed the letters that were incorporated in the later part of the book.\n\nThe portrayal of the times and the social issues that women were facing was well done. The writing is reflective of that time, which made it harder to read in parts. Alternatively, some of the writing is beautiful and read like poetry.\n\nThank you to the publisher for a copy of this book to read & review\n\nTitle: If a Poem Could Live and Breathe\n\nAuthor: Mary Calvi\n\nRelease Date: February 14th, 2023\n\nPage Count: 310\n\nFormat: Netgalley/Audiobook\n\nStart Date: March 11th, 2023\n\nFinish Date: March 11th, 2023\n\nRating: 5 Stars\n\nReview:\n\nThis is a fictional story that is based on Teddy Roosevelt's first wife. I don't remember ever learning about her in school. I guess they would be more focused on his accomplishments than his love life. I wound up doing some research about the couple after I got done reading it. It made me feel really emotional. The story is so beautiful. It's also really realistic and emotional. From what I understand, the story is based on letters that were actually recovered between the two of them. I'm not usually a romantic sap, but this really tugged at my heart. I loved it!\n\nStories of Theodore Roosevelt often depict him in his years of political life but here the focus is on a young man finding the love of his life and losing her. Mary Calvi used Teddy’s intimate letters to piece together a fictional account of Alice Lee and their relationship.\n\nThey met when he was a student at Harvard in 1878. Alice was a progressive young woman who believed girls should have equal rights in regards to education. Teddy was smitten at first sight and some of his letters, which are included in the book, are a testament to his infatuation.\n\nThe book switches back and forth between the budding romance (the past) and a present time when Roosevelt is struggling to adjust to the loss of the woman he loved. Much of his love of the West, of nature and of his commitment to making America more equitable grew out of his early years. Calvi uncovers his intimate emotions through the correspondence she perused. Sometimes the romance is a bit heavy handed but, based upon the letters, it was part of their relationship. These letters lend credibility to the story of a broken-hearted man who turned to nature to heal.\n\nWhat this book does is show a different side of an important historical figure. The story focuses on a time when Teddy Roosevelt was in his formative years, establishing his character and personal priorities. Calvi used his own words from his letters to posit his feelings and beliefs. The author’s notes are particularly helpful and add to the appreciation of this fictional account of a man much has been written about.\n\nThank you Netgalley, Mary Calvi, and publishers for gifting me a copy of this book in return for my honest opinion.\n\n3/5 stars\n\nI want to start by saying that this is a wonderfully written book but during some parts of it I almost felt like I was reading fanfiction about Theodore Roosevelt and Alice Lee. I was not expecting some of the poetic nature of the writing. For example, \"feeling his powerful thighs through the wool of his pants. She imagined his masculinity would be even more apparent below the material.\" It came off more smutty to me than the romantic feelings she intended. I can see what she was trying to do and I can understand why some like it but it wasn't for me.\n\nThe history and research were fantastically done and I always love a strong female lead! It was fascinating to learn about Roosevelt's earlier life. I also really enjoyed the love letters that were included.\n\nThis book tells the love story between Teddy Roosevelt and Alice Lee. Real love letters are included in the novel to help add something special to their love story. Alice is trying to break the norms of her mother's generation. Between the fight for educational opportunities to exploring personal freedoms. We then have a young Teddy studying at Harvard on his journey.\n\nAs a Canadian reader I did not have any knowledge of Theodore Roosevelt and his life, so this was a pleasant introduction to the HUMAN behind the president. A love story that was hard to believe was true as it played out like the plot of a period piece I might watch. I was pleased to learn about the force that was Alice Hathaway Lee and the start of women's movements across the US. I would recommend this read to all of my literary friends and those that don't dive into history too often but appreciate a love story including two humans that support and uplift one another no matter the atmosphere around them.\n\nThis one is based on the real life love story of Theodore Roosevelt and Alice Lee.\n\nSet during the 1870’s, both Teddy and Alice are young - we meet them during Roosevelt’s uni days - and full of life. They both have impressive character and stories in their own right. Obviously, Theodore, a one day president, is on the track of political and self discovery. He is surrounded by young, intelligent minds and exploring future options, from natural science to politics. Alice is formidable. She is described as a great beauty but also a student, setting out to break down the stereotypes women face and push for women’s freedoms in life and education. Many of her ideas are credited for shaping Roosevelt’s politics.\n\nThey meet. They fall in love. The rest is history.\n\nI had hoped for more depth to their story - perhaps more historical fiction - but found it to be pretty sappy romance. Do people really talk like that? Did they? The letters written, presumably real letters written between the couple, were, in my mind, strange and awkward.\n\nI think that the author was trying to utilize the writing style of the time - emulating the classics - and, as the title suggests, engage the poetic but it just felt overly sugary to me.\n\nThat said, I think the boundaries and pressures of the time were captured well. Things like Alice’s illness being diagnosed as an overtaxing of her brain; she studied too hard and her poor feminine, fragile sensibilities just couldn’t handle the strain, for example. The discussions about women’s further education were well represented. Alice’s mother’s expectations seemed well representative of her generation and what Alice was hoping to break out of.\n\nTheir story is not one often told and, for that, it was worth the read. If you’re a fan of historical romance and the classics, this one should be right up your alley.\n\nThanks to NetGalley and st.Martin’s press for my e arc in exchange for my honest review.\n\nIf a Poem Could Live and Breathe by Mary Calvi. Pub Date: February 14, 2023. Rating: 3 stars. This novel is an account of the love story between Teddy Roosevelt and Alice Hathaway Lee. At first glance, Teddy Roosevelt is smitten with Alice and their love story unfolds throughout the novel with use of personal letters. The reader is taken on a journey of courtship into marriage during the 1800s and the author does a fabulous job of transporting the reader to the place and time of this relationship. I was immersed in this world and found the love story authentic and portrayed well. If you love historical fiction with a romantic twist, then pick this novel up. You will not be disappointed. Thanks to NetGalley and St. Martin's Press for this e-arc in exchange for my honest review. #netgalley #ifapoemcouldliveandbreathe\n\nThis book is a romantic speculative novel drawn from real historical archives, of Theodore Roosevelt and his first love and wife Alice Hathaway Lee.\n\nI loved having a glimpse into this softer side of Roosevelt as the usual narrative surrounding him is \"rough and ready\" Teddy. In the early stages of their courting, I enjoyed going along with them on their excursions - birding, chestnutting, getting tintypes made, and sledding. As their relationship grew, their poems and love letters were a touchingly intimate look into their love story.\n\nWhile Alice was described as beautiful, I particularly enjoyed Teddy's attraction to her intellect. Their philosophical debates were fascinating and fun. She was an advocate for women's rights surrounding higher education. His support for her feminist beliefs was a pleasant surprise. I wonder how much of this is true. Their daughter certainly modeled the behavior of an independent woman.\n\nThis is a wonderful story of first love and a personal glimpse into a storied president.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for an ARC of this book. All opinions are my own."
