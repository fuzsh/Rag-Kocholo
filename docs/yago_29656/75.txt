Alice Hathaway Lee-Roosevelt (July 29, 1861 – February 14, 1884) was the first wife of Theodore Roosevelt. They had one child, Alice Lee Roosevelt. The elder Alice died of Bright's Disease complicated by childbirth at the age of 22, two days after giving birth to her daughter. Her death, which closely coincided with the death of her mother-in-law, prompted her widower to go into a deep depression, declaring "The light has gone out of my life" and temporarily leaving politics a short time later.
