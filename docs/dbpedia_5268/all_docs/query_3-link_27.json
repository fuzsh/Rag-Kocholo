        "text": "If you enjoy silent comedy and film history, tonight is a big night on Turner Classic Movies. Beginning at 8 p.m. (EDT), TCM will present more than seven hours of the earliest available examples of filmed comedy, from the visionary brain of Mack Sennett. (A complete schedule for tonight is below.)\n\nBorn in 1880 in Danville, Quebec, Canada, Sennett began his career in Vaudeville in New York City, where he met famed filmmaker D.W. Griffith. Sennett went to work for Griffith at the American Mutoscope and Biograph Company in Lower Manhattan, directing and starring in some of the first comedic short subjects. In 1912, he headed westward to form Keystone Studios in Edendale, California and then the Mack Sennett Comedies Corporation in 1917, helping to launch the careers of Charlie Chaplin, Roscoe “Fatty” Arbuckle, W.C. Fields, Harry Langdon, Mabel Normand, Charley Chase and Raymond Griffith.\n\nIn addition to producing, directing and starring in hundreds of short subjects, Sennett also helmed the first feature-length comedy, TILLIE’S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914) with Marie Dressler and Charlie Chaplin. You can see that film tonight at 12:45 a.m. (EDT).\n\nThere are 29 Sennett short subjects airing tonight. If you can’t catch all of them, TCM Senior Writer/Producer Scott McGee says don’t miss the following titles, airing during the 9 p.m. (EDT) block: THE BANGVILLE POLICE (1913), featuring the first appearance of the Keystone Kops; BARNEY OLDFIELD’S RACE FOR A LIFE (1913), a racing-themed film featuring the Kops; and MABEL’S DRAMATIC CAREER (1913) with Mabel Normand. During the 11 p.m. hour, McGee recommends THE KNOCKOUT and THE ROUNDERS (both 1914) with Chaplin and Arbuckle. And in the 2 a.m. block, Scott suggests you catch FATTY’S NEW ROLE (1915), featuring Edgar Kennedy and Billy Gilbert, two faces that will be familiar to fans of 1930s comedy.\n\nIn addition to silents , TCM is peppering the pot tonight with two rarely seen early talking shorts from Warner Bros. Vitaphone Varieties series: deadpan comedy team Shaw & Lee in THE BEAU BRUMMELS (1928) at 12:36 a.m. (EDT) and Ray Mayer and Edith Evans in THE COWBOY AND THE GIRL (1928) at 3:17 am. (For more information on the delightful Vitaphone series, read my 2009 interview with film preservationist and Vitaphone Project founder Ron Hutchinson.)\n\nAnd the night closes out with the first two films Leo Gorcey and the Bowery Boys made at Monogram Pictures: LIVE WIRES (1946) and FAST COMPANY (1946), the latter directed by Three Stooges veteran Del Lord.\n\nIt’s an embarrassment of black & white comedy riches, and it’s only the first night of a month of fun. Every Thursday during September, TCM will highlight the work of Mack Sennett – 87 films, 76 of which have never before aired on the network!\n\nHere’s a promo for the month-long Sennett Salute, written and produced by Scott McGee.\n\n8-9 p.m. (EDT) – 5 Biograph shorts (1909-1912)\n\nTHE CURTAIN POLE (1909)\n\nDirector D.W.
