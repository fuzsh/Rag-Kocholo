        "text": "In 1944, Grantland Rice of The New York Herald Tribune lamented the inability of Lou Novikoff to live up expectations well into four seasons in the National League:\n\n“It would have ben a big lift to big league baseball if…’The Mad Russian’ of the Cubs could only have approached his minor league average under the Big Tent.”\n\nThe reason was baseball’s need for “color;”\n\n“There has always been a need in baseball for another Rube Waddell, another Bugs Raymond or another Dizzy Dean. They had more than their share of color. But they had something more than color—they were also great ballplayers.”\n\nNovikoff, Rice said had “a gob of color,” but hadn’t come close to putting up the numbers he did the Pacific Coast League and American Association:\n\n“Novikoff on the West Coast looked to be as good a hitter as Ted Williams…But he was no Ted Williams in the major show.”\n\nBoth Williams and Novikoff had huge seasons in the American Association after leaving the West Coast—Williams hit .366 in Minneapolis in 1938 and Novikoff hit .370 in Milwaukee in 1941—but as Rice concluded: No one had yet “wipe(d) away the dust from his big-league batting eye.”\n\nThe loss of Novikoff to pick up where Dizzy Dean left off “in the headline class, “ was a loss for baseball, Rice said:\n\n“Baseball can use more color than it has known since Dizzy Dean retired to tell St. Luis radio listeners that someone ‘sold into third base.’\n\n“It could use another Rube Waddell, who split his spring and summer days three ways—pitching, tending bar, and going fishing. But it should be remembered Dizzy Dean and Rube Waddell were among the great pitchers of all time.”\n\nThere was none he said, as colorful as Babe Ruth. Ping Bodie “was never a great ballplayer, but he was good enough. He was another remembered character. There was the time he bought a parrot and taught the bird to keep repeating— ‘Ping made good.’”\n\nRive said Bugs Raymond had color and talent—but for too short a time before the color overtook the talent.\n\n“There was the time when Bugs was pitching for Shreveport. He made a bet that he could eat a whole turkey, drink two quarts of Scotch and win a double header. He won his bet tradition says.”\n\nBy “tradition” Rice meant Rice. He was the source of the turkey and scotch story as a young reporter covering the Southern League.\n\nRice’s dream team of colorful players would include:\n\n“Babe Ruth, Rube Waddell, Dizzy Dean, Bugs Raymond, Larry McLean, Tacks Parrott, Arlie Latham, German Schaefer, Al Schacht, Crazy Schmidt [sic Schmit] Rabbit Maranville and one or two more. I wouldn’t however, want to be manager.”\n\nWhile Rice valued color, he said “two of the greatest ballclubs” he ever covered we not at all colorful:\n\n“One was Connie Mack’s Athletics lineup from 1910 through 1914, winners of four pennants in five years. The other was the Yankees after Babe Ruth left, a crushing outfit season after season.\n\n“These two squads were composed of fine ballplayers who were rarely prankish or the lighter side of life—Eddie Collins, Eddie Plank, Stuffy McInnis, Jack Barry, Homerun Baker, Jack Coombs, Chief Bender, to whom baseball was strictly a business matter. The same went for Bill Dickey, Joe Gordon, Lou Gehrig, Charlie Keller, Spud Chandler, Joe DiMaggio and others might have made up a session of bank presidents.”\n\nNovikoff never lived up to his minor league hype. He hit a respectable .282 in five major league seasons but only played 17 games in the big-leagues after the end of World War II.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIn 1914, Eddie Collins contributed an article about the life of a major leaguer in The National Sunday Magazine, a syndicated insert that appeared in several papers across the country.\n\nHe described the beginning of his first road trip in the big leagues:\n\n“It happened two days after I had joined the Philadelphia Athletics. As ‘Mr. Sullivan,’ (Collins initially played under the name Edward T. Sullivan), still being an undergraduate at Columbia, I had watched two games from the grandstand at Shibe Park.\n\n“The series over, Manager (Connie) Mack told me to report at the railroad station in time to catch a train that was leaving at six o’clock. The Athletics were to make a quick September (1906) swing around the circuit.”\n\nCollins said he was “about the first one at the depot,” and “eager as a boy” to begin his big league career.\n\nOnce on the train, he described the reaction of the players the first time the porter announced that dinner would be served:\n\n“What transpired, immediately, might have led one to believe that the porter had insulted nearly everyone in the car. There was a stampede. Every one of the Athletics was up and rushing down the aisle, throwing aside magazines and newspapers, tumbling and pitching toward the door. The porter was knocked over and it is no exaggeration to state that one of our players—a very fleshy outfielder with elephantine tread (Topsy Hartsel)—walked over him in his haste.\n\n“’What’s the matter with those fellows?’ I asked a veteran who had not joined the stampede.\n\n“In justice to him, be it explained that he had a sprained ankle and couldn’t run.\n\n“’They’re pulling a Lave Cross,’ he threw over his shoulder, as he hobbled after the others as fast as his lame ankle would permit.\n\n“I came to know what ‘Pulling a Lave Cross’ meant.”\n\nCollins explained the term, which referenced the former Athletics player:\n\n“He was in the big leagues for years and during that period, he was never beaten into a dining car or eating room of any sort. He always caught the first cab out of the station; he always was the first to plunge into the sleeper and select the best berth. He never ran second where personal comforts or tastes were at stake. During all his years, and the competition is keen, he was supreme.”\n\nCollins said while Cross’ behavior might have been extreme, “haste” was “a habit inbred in all successful” ballplayers:\n\n“I have noticed that after the game we all dress like firemen getting three alarms, race back the hotel, race into the dining room, race through our meal. Then we saunter out into the lobby and kill two or three hours trying to see which foot we can stand on longer. At first I marveled at this, then I found myself racing along with the rest of them.”\n\nCalling himself, and his colleagues “rather peculiar individual(s)” Collins said of ballplayers:\n\n“On the field, all his energies and thoughts are concentrated on one idea—the winning of the game. His day’s work done, however, he throws that all off. His first desire is to avoid the crowds and excitement. Then he persistently refuses to talk baseball. If you want to make yourself unpopular with big league ballplayers, drop into their hotel some night and try to talk baseball to them. “\n\nCollins next provided readers with “some idea of ballplayers out of spangles,” to bring them into “closer touch.”\n\nHonus Wagner, he said, was not a fan of fans:\n\n“Down in Carnegie (PA) there are about twenty unfortunates…who are taken care of solely through Wagner’s generosity. He has a heart as big as his clumsy looking body, but he hates the baseball ‘bug.’ Frequently wealthy fans have called at Wagner’s hotel on the road and tried to engage him in conversation. Generally he will excuse himself and going over to the elevator boy will sit and chat with him for an hour at a time. Wagner’s worst enemy will not tell you he is conceited, but he hates the fans prying into his affairs.”\n\nConnie Mack, he said, “is the same kind of man” as Wagner:\n\n“Connie is forever handing out touches to old time players. He is always thinking of anybody connected with baseball from the bat boys up. I know he insisted out little hunchback mascot (Louis Van Zelst) getting a share of the World Series’ money—not that any players objected—but it was Connie’s thought first.\n\n“’Little Van comes in on this,’ he said.”\n\nCollins also talked about how his teammates occupied themselves on the road:\n\n“You will never find Chief Bender, our Indian pitcher, hanging around the hotel. Too many original fans are apt to salute him with a war-whoop. Besides, he is golf mad and when not on the diamond, he is to be found on the links… (Carroll “Boardwalk”) Brown, the young pitcher who did so well for us last year, is a billiard expert… (Stuffy) McInnis and (Eddie) Murphy are the ‘movie fiends’ of our club and are the only ones (Collins said many players were scared to go to the movies because they thought it would damage their eyes). They can call the name of every star as soon as they see the face on the screen. Jack Barry, our shortstop, is inordinately fond of Hebrew literature and Biblical history. This, although he, as well as his name, is Irish.”\n\nCollins also shared his manager’s rules for the Athletics when the team was traveling:\n\n“It is one of Mack’s rules that we are only allowed to play cards on the trains…Connie is against card playing, which only leads to-night after night sessions, ill feelings and finally, disruption. I could tell you of at least one American League team that was broken by card games…Everybody has to be in bed by half past eleven and report in Mack’s room at half past ten in the morning. For an hour Mack talks baseball, planning our campaign for the day.”\n\nAfter Mack’s meeting, it was time to eat, and Collins shared his insights on ballplayers and food:\n\nHe said a “young pitcher on our club” should be a star, but “he has a weakness for roast beef,” and “persists in stuffing himself at noon time.” He didn’t name the pitcher.\n\n“Walter Johnson, the greatest pitcher in baseball, also has a noonday weakness. It is ice cream, but he seems to thrive on it. Jack Barry feels off-color if he does not get his slice of pie…On the day he is going to pitch, Eddie Plank, our veteran left-hander, always eats tomato soup. He thinks he would lose if he did not observe this ritual.”\n\nCollins concluded:\n\n“There is great temptation for the young minor league player, being put up at first class hotels…to eat his head off. I honestly believe that more good youngsters have been ruined for big league work simply from overeating than any other extraneous cause.”\n\nOther than their general disdain for ‘bugs,’ Collins said, in the end, players of the current era were unrecognizable from their counterparts of a generation earlier:\n\n“Ballplayers today are scrupulously careful never to offend anyone in any way. Especially do they take pride in being Chesterfields when women are around.”\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe Cost of Superstitions, 1913\n\nJohn Phalen “Stuffy” McInnis his .324 and drove in 90 runs for the 1913 Philadelphia Athletics, but the first baseman hit just .118—2 for 17—during the World Series.\n\nThe Washington Post told how one superstition among the athletics players might have contributed to McInnis’ slump:\n\n“Those boys believe that they can change the luck at a crucial moment by hurling their bats in the air and letting them fall where they will. Probably you fans have often seen them do it. They also believe that they can keep up their good luck by continuing this practice.\n\n“During the first game, in which (Frank “Home Run”) Baker hit a home run, the Athletics started tossing their bats the minute the ball was hit. As the bats came down Stuffy McGinnis couldn’t get out of the way in time and one of them struck him in the ankle, causing a painful bruise. He limped to first base and for a while (Connie) Mack was afraid he couldn’t go on with the game.”\n\nDespite McInnis’ slump, the Athletics beat the Giants four games to one.\n\nThe Case against the Spitball, 1905\n\nBaseball’s greatest pitcher hated the games most controversial pitch. In 1905 Denton True “Cy” Young was quoted in The Sporting Life saying it wouldn’t be long before the pitch disappeared entirely:\n\n“I don’t think the ‘spit ball’ is going to cut a much a figure as was thought early in the season. Many of the pitchers that were using it at the start of the campaign have cut it now, and from now on the twirlers that use it will be dropping it one by one. I used it against Philadelphia and Washington and had it working nicely, but it hurt my arm and I have cut it altogether. An old pitcher like myself has no business using it at all.”\n\nYoung said the pitch injured his forearm and said he was not alone. He claimed Jack Chesbro, George Mullin, (Guy) “Doc” White all received similar injuries. And Washington’s Case Patten, who a year earlier so loved the pitch The St. Louis Republic said he was often “giving the ball a shower bath preparatory to flinging,” was now saying the pitch “lamed his arm.”\n\nYoung said even for those who weren’t injured, the spitter would ultimately lead to pitchers losing “control of his curve ball and his fast ones.”\n\nWhile Chesbro disagreed with Young’s claim that his arm problems were the result of throwing spitballs, his effectiveness diminished greatly after the injury.\n\nYoung’s prediction of the demise of the pitch was premature. At the time of his statement, Chicago White Sox pitcher “Big Ed” Walsh was perfecting the pitch, which he learned from teammate Elmer Stricklett—who had also been instrumental in Chesbro’s use of the spitter. Walsh started throwing the spitball regularly in 1906.\n\nA month before his death, on his 78th birthday and bed-ridden, Walsh remained an advocate for the pitch Cy Young detested. He told a reporter for The Associated Press:\n\n“I admire the pitchers today who throw the pitch. Some people call ‘em cheaters. They’re not. They’re just guys doing everything they can to win.”\n\nWahoo Sam’s Scouting Report, 1914\n\nComing off of the New York Giants off-season world tour with the Chicago White Sox, the consensus opinion seemed to be that Giants Manager John McGraw did not make a mistake in signing Jim Thorpe, the world’s greatest all-around athlete, to a three-year contract worth–depending on the source—from $5,000 to $6,500 per season. Many doubted Thorpe’s prospects after he hit just .143 in 19 games for the Giants in 1913.\n\nBut, not to worry, said McGraw:\n\n“All Thorpe needed was every day action, instead of idleness, although of course sitting on the bench all summer gave him a chance to learn lots of things that will stand him in good stead later on.”\n\nThe baseball world generally agreed with McGraw’s assessment.\n\nHugh Fullerton predicted Thorpe would be “the most sensational baseball player of 1914.”\n\nDamon Runyon declared Thorpe was “now a star.”\n\nGustave (G.W.) Axelson, Sports Editor of The Chicago Record-Herald, who traveled with the teams, said of Thorpe’s development during the trip:\n\n“The fans in the United States will see an entirely different kind of player when Thorpe Lines up for the season. “\n\nWhite Sox pitcher Joe Benz, who played against Thorpe on the tour, agreed saying Thorpe “improved greatly” and would be of “great assistance to the Giants,” in 1914.\n\nBut, “Wahoo” Sam Crawford, the Detroit Tigers outfielder who traveled with the tour as a member of the White Sox disagreed with all the glowing accounts of Thorpe’s progress. The Detroit Times said:\n\n“Thorpe’s speed is all that commends him, according to Sam. He is not a particularly good fielder, and he cannot hit. He is not a natural hitter at all, but he gives the bat a little upward chop as he swings at the ball in a way that Crawford never saw any man do before.\n\n“Furthermore Thorpe doesn’t seem to have that baseball instinct that is so necessary for a big league player, say Crawford. He is a very chesty fellow for a man who has yet to prove that he is of big league caliber, is the assertion made by Wahoo Sam.”\n\nCrawford’s assessment was the most accurate. Despite the fanfare that accompanied Thorpe’s return from the tour, Thorpe was never better than a mediocre outfielder (career .951 fielding percentage) and he hit just .252 over parts of nine major league seasons.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nCharles John “Butch” “Butcher Boy” Schmidt was credited by Connie Mack with being the catalyst for the Boston Braves World Series upset of Mack’s Philadelphia Athletics in 1914; one year later Schmidt walked away from baseball in his prime.\n\nHe was born in Baltimore in 1886, and played amateur ball while working in the family meat market, which earned him his nickname.\n\nSchmidt signed as a pitcher with the Baltimore Orioles in the Eastern League and assigned to the Holyoke Papermakers in the Connecticut State League, where he posted a 10-9 record. In late August the Orioles recalled him, and he went 5-1 in 11 games with Baltimore.\n\nThe New York Highlanders drafted Schmidt and the 22-year-old pitcher started the 1909 season in New York. He appeared in only one game, on May 11, giving up 10 hits and eight runs, four earned, in five innings. Early in June he was returned to the Orioles.\n\nAfter appearing in eight games on the mound with the Orioles, Schmidt was moved to first base. After hitting .244 for the remainder of ’09, he hit .292, .291, and .274 the next three seasons, and was sold to the Rochester Hustlers in the International League, where he hit .321; he was purchased by the Boston Braves on August 22, and hit .308 in 22 games playing in place of Ralph “Hap” Myers.\n\nAt the end of the 1913 season Boston sold Myers’ contract to Rochester; The Boston Post reported that Braves manager George Stallings simply didn’t like Myers. (Myers had a different theory for his release—that story next week)\n\nSchmidt was installed as the Braves first baseman in 1914, and as Boston made their improbable run to the National league pennant Schmidt hit .285 with 71 RBI and .990 fielding percentage, and finished 16th in the voting for the Chalmers Award, for the most valuable player in the National League; teammates Johnny Evers and Rabbit Maranville finished first and second in the voting.\n\nGrantland Rice said in The New York Tribune:\n\n“There are few greater first basemen in baseball and none who is steadier or a better fighter. For Schmidt is also of the aggressive type and a hustler every second.”\n\nThe New York Times didn’t think quite as highly of Schmidt and on the eve of the World Series said the “advantage favors the Athletics” at first base:\n\n“(John “Stuffy”) McInnis makes exceptionally brilliant plays…has been through Worlds Series fire and proved just as cool as if he were playing an exhibition game in the springtime. Schmidt has yet to face the strain and tension of the big baseball classic…While Schmidt is not a scientific batsman, he is a free swinger and hits the ball hard, but he doesn’t hit it often.”\n\nThe pressure of the series didn’t seem to bother Schmidt, the Braves first baseman hit .294 with five hits, two runs and two RBIs in the four game sweep of the Athletics; McInnis hit just .143.\n\nIn game one he made a play in the first inning that Connie Mack said set the tone for the series and “sparked the Braves.” With runners on first and second with one out, Athletics third baseman Frank “Home Run” Baker hit a foul pop-up into short right field. Athletics outfielder Eddie Murphy tagged up and attempted to go to third; The Associated Press said Schmidt made a “great throw…from a difficult angle,” to third baseman Charlie Deal to retire Murphy.\n\nEarly in the 1915 season Braves manager George Stallings called Schmidt “The best first baseman in the game,” but his performance at the plate slipped. Schmidt hit just .251 with 60 RBIs. The Braves again found themselves in 8th place in July, and while they made another strong run, finished 2nd, seven games behind the Philadelphia Phillies.\n\nDespite the mediocre season at the plate, it was assumed the 28-year-old Schmidt would remain the Braves first baseman. Schmidt shocked Stallings, Boston fans, and all of baseball when he announced in January of 1916 that he was retiring from baseball.\n\nThe Associated Press said Schmidt was leaving “to devote his entire time to his private business.”\n\nGrantland Rice said Schmidt’s business included “six meat markets in Baltimore,” and that he earned $8000 a year from his stores.\n\nThe Sporting Life said it was just as likely that Schmidt, listed at 200 pounds, retired because:\n\nHard work in that old rubber shirt to get down to weight, especially when the extra weight comes off slowly, more slowly each succeeding season, is a trial that anyone would like to sidestep if he could. “\n\nBoston manager George Stallings filled the void left by Schmidt by purchasing Ed Konetchy from the Pittsburgh Rebels from the newly defunct Federal League.\n\nThe Boston Post said the change at first base would not hurt the Braves:\n\n“Konetchy, a heavier hitter than Schmidt, is just about as capable in other ways.”\n\nDespite the confidence of The Post, Stallings was not convinced and continued to try to induce Schmidt to return; his efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nAfter Konetchy hit .260 for the third place Braves in 1916 it was reported that Schmidt would return to the team. After several weeks of speculation, Schmidt told The Boston Globe “no offer” could induce him to return to Boston.\n\nKonetchy hit .272 and .236 the next two seasons, and each off season it was rumored Schmidt would return, and every year he stayed home where he continued to run his business and play semi-pro ball in Baltimore’s Inter-City League.\n\nBefore the 1919 season Konetchy was traded to the Brooklyn Robins and the Braves acquired Walter Holke from the Cincinnati Reds. Holke hit .292 for the Braves in 1919, but rumors continued that Schmidt, out of organized baseball for four years, would be returning to Boston. The Associated Press said:\n\n“George Stallings of the Boston Braves is trying to get Charlie “Butch” Schmidt, the Baltimore butcher boy who played first base for the world’s champions of 1914, to return to the Boston Braves. Schmidt is reported to be in wonderful condition as he has kept in practice since his retirement.”\n\nSchmidt never returned to professional ball, and was finally removed from Boston’s reserve list in 1922.\n\nButch Schmidt walked away from professional baseball and never looked back; he died in 1952 of a heart attack while inspecting cattle at the Baltimore Union Stock Yards.\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading..."
