Kelly Osbourne, who previously talked about being sober for six years, revealed in April 2021 that she had suffered a relapse and was working on next steps. “Not proud of it. But I am back on track,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. Two months later, the former Fashion Police star explained how the COVID-19 pandemic caused her relapse during a June 2021 appearance on Red Table Talk. “I was alone, sitting by a pool and waiting for somebody to come have a meeting with me. And I saw this woman and her husband had a glass of champagne. It looked really nice, and I was like, ‘I can do that, too,’” she shared. “And the next day, I had two glasses. And the day after that, it was bottles.” [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"2fTANRlH7r-2837958-14453\"] Demi Lovato, who first entered rehab for drug and alcohol addiction in 2010, has used their experience to help others who may be struggling with similar problems. The singer previously sought treatment and entered a sober house in 2013, but relapsed after six years of sobriety and was rushed to the hospital following a near-fatal drug overdose in 2018. \"A one-size-fits-all solution does not work for everybody,” Lovato told Glamour magazine about the choice to not remove marijuana from their life. “Any path that is right for someone else does not mean that it is an effective, meaningful, safe path for you. ... What I'm encouraging people to do is just make choices for themselves. Autonomy, for me, is what changed my life.\" Scroll down for all the stars who bravely got sober in private, then shared the inspiring news with fans by coming clean on getting clean: If you or anyone you know is facing substance abuse issues, call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 for free and confidential information 24/7.\n\nCredit: Jason Kempin/Getty Images\n\nJon Pardi\n\nThe country star revealed in December 2023 that he was 112 days sober. “I was pre-diabetic and I was just like, ‘I gotta stop,’” he shared while appearing on the \"Country Heat Weekly\" podcast for Amazon Music, noting that he’d “lost a bunch of weight” as a result of cutting out alcohol.\n\n“I was really getting to the point where every picture, every video I was so unhappy with myself. And where I was going, I needed to just take a break,” he said, adding that sobriety has been a “great” decision.\n\n“I just did a photo shoot and I was like … ‘D-mn, I look good.’ Take that Tito’s,” he continued. “So for anybody that’s thinking about it, if they want to lose weight and you do drink, let me tell you, it does help tremendously if you stop.”\n\nCredit: Chad Salvador/Shutterstock for Hawke Productions\n\nIsaak Presley\n\n“I’m three years sober off of, like, pills. But I’m six months sober off of drinking and excess, other things like weed and shrooms,” the former Disney Channel actor revealed on an August 2023 episode of the “Vulnerable with Christy Carlson Romano” podcast.\n\nIt took being arrested earlier that year — for an incident unrelated to his addiction battle — to make him realize he wanted to make some lifestyle changes. “I just realized, like, I was still a prisoner under a coping mechanism that wasn’t healthy,” he shared. “I had been drinking a bit. I didn’t have a drinking problem, but I was drinking a lot more than normal. I was binge-drinking.”\n\nPresley continued: “I just kind of sat there, and I was like, ‘Is this what I want to be, sitting in this cell right now? This person that I am sitting in this cell, is this who I want to be?’ And I was like, ‘No. I am a shadow of the person I want to be.’”\n\nCredit: MediaPunch/Shutterstock\n\nDelilah Belle Hamlin\n\nLisa Rinna's daughter revealed in February 2022 that she was six months sober after accidentally overdosing on prescription drugs. While speaking to Flaunt magazine in December 2022, Hamlin noted that she felt \"grateful\" to have survived her \"hard times.\"\n\nShe continued: \"I haven’t really spoken about why I became sober. I chose to be sober because of the seizures that I was starting to have because of brain inflammation. I've been a year and some months sober from alcohol and other things. I don't think about it. I love this lifestyle. I wouldn't push it on anyone, but it's definitely an amazing feeling. It's such an interesting word, the word 'sober.' It's shown me the connotations that come with it — like, 'She's an addict.' No, I'm really just living my life without substances to get me to feel something. I feel enough.\"\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nSam Worthington\n\nThe Avatar: The Way of Water actor reflected on being eight years sober in a December 2022 interview with Variety. \"I couldn't see it. I thought it was normal,\" he said of his drinking habits. \"I didn't like who I was. Drinking helped me get through the day.\"\n\nWorthington noted that he would have his first drink in the morning. \"Nine out of 10 people couldn't tell. They could probably smell it on me, but when they looked at me, they couldn't tell,\" he said. \"I was still doing my job — I just don't think I was doing it very well.\"\n\nCredit: Shutterstock\n\nTom Felton\n\nIn his debut memoir, Beyond the Wand: The Magic and Mayhem of Growing Up a Wizard — released in October 2022 — the actor behind Draco Malfoy revealed his past battles with substance abuse. “It came to the point where I would think nothing of having a drink while I was working,” he wrote about his post-Harry Potter struggles. After his team and then-girlfriend staged an intervention for him, he attended rehab three times. While he left the first and got kicked out of the second, he ultimately chose to go to a third after \"the numbness\" eventually returned.\n\n“It was one of the hardest decisions I ever had to make,” he shared about his third trip to a mental health facility — but one he is grateful he made, noting that he hopes that in sharing his story he will be able to help others.\n\nCredit: Tammie Arroyo/Shutterstock\n\nCharles Kelley\n\nIn August 2022, the singer's band Lady A postponed their Request Line Tour amid Kelley's sobriety journey.\n\n\"Being on the road with our fans is our greatest joy, so it was a hard but important decision to make,\" the country music group wrote via Instagram at the time. \"We are a band, but more importantly ... we're family. We're proud to say that Charles has embarked on a journey to sobriety.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"So, right now in order to be the healthiest, strongest and most creative band we can be, Lady A will take the time with the support of our families and team of professionals to walk through this together. It's early on this road, but we are determined to do what will best set us up for many more years together. We're grateful for your patience.\"\n\nCredit: Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nJamie Campbell Bower\n\n\"12 and a half years ago I was in active addiction,\" Bower tweeted in July 2022. \"Hurting myself and those around me who I loved the most. It got so bad that eventually I ended up in a hospital for mental health. I am now 7 1/2 years clean and sober.\"\n\nIn the lengthy social media post, the Stranger Things star reflected on his \"many mistakes\" that he used to grow as a person. \"For anyone who wakes up thinking, ‘Oh God not again.' I promise you there's a way,\" he continued. \"I'm so grateful to be where I am, I'm so grateful to be sober. I'm so grateful to be. Remember, we are all works in progress.\"\n\nCredit: Jordan Strauss/AP/Shutterstock\n\nFlorence Welch\n\nThe \"Dog Days\" singer called sobriety \"the best thing I ever did\" during a July 2022 appearance on Munroe Bergdorf's \"The Way We Were\" podcast.\n\n\"It took me a long time to come to terms with the fact that I had a problem with drinking because I was one of those drinkers where [it was all or nothing],\" the English singer said. \"If I enjoy my drinking, I can't control it and if I control my drinking, I don't enjoy it. That was a real wake-up call for me.\"\n\nWelch told the podcaster it was \"fine to be a chaotic mess\" when she was a relatively unknown artist, but knew she had to make a change after the release of her Grammy-nominated album Ceremonials in 2012. \"I was like, 'This has to be contained. This can't leak out into the public sphere,'\" she said.\n\nCredit: Eric Charbonneau/Shutterstock\n\nDave Coulier\n\nIn March 2022, the Full House alum revealed that he got sober in 2020 after a drunken night that left his face bloodied. “I was a drunk. Yes. An alcoholic,\" he wrote via Instagram, sharing a photo of his face after the accident. \"I’ve been alcohol free since January 1, 2020. When I drank, I was the life of the party. I could make people laugh until they fell down. In this picture I was the one who fell down. Not because I was playing hockey or doing the things I love — like chopping wood or doing construction, golfing, fishing or flying airplanes. I was hammered and fell, going up some stairs made of stone.”\n\nThe comedian went on to thank his wife, Melissa Coulier, for helping him make a change. “The mental and physical withdrawal were big challenges for me, but I was supported by @melissacoulier and friends who had already made the journey,” he wrote. “The psychological and physical transformation has been amazing. The sky is more blue, my heart is no longer closed, and I enjoy making people laugh until they fall down more than ever before. Thank you, Melissa, for being by my side. I love you❤️.”\n\nCredit: Paul Zimmerman/BAFTA/Shutterstock\n\nJane Lynch\n\nThe Glee alum recalled her struggles with alcohol addiction during an interview with The Guardian in February 2022, revealing she got sober for a second time after relapsing years ago. Lynch explained that after going to AA for years, having a successful career and doing therapy, she began drinking again — and quickly learned she couldn’t just have one drink.\n\n\"I became a connoisseur of wine in a way that only an alcoholic can,\" she shared of her relapse, noting she drank while starring on Paramount+’s The Good Fight, which she appeared on from 2017 to 2021. \"I went back into denial, after all those years of sobriety and self-knowledge. I fooled myself — I woke up one day and went: ‘I'm back.'\"\n\nLynch recalled being able to fool her close friends during that time, saying, \"I remember a friend said: ‘I told you you're not an alcoholic anymore.' I'd go: ‘I know!'\" The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel actress is now sober, adding that she stopped drinking again just six months after her relapse.\n\n\"[It was] like the sober fairy said, ‘OK, I'm giving you one more chance,'\" she said. \"And it was over. Five o'clock would come and I didn't notice it.\"\n\nCredit: Courtesy of Holly Ramsay\n\nHolly Ramsay\n\nGordon Ramsay's daughter shared an inspiring message for those who \"continue to take it day by day\" on their sobriety journeys, revealing in December 2021 that she chose to \"take a break from alcohol\" one year prior. \"This time last year I was at my lowest and I was scared but I made a decision to take control of what I could - and that meant removing alcohol from my life,\" she wrote via Instagram. \"It was not an easy decision, nor one that I have taken lightly. ... Living without alcohol has helped me feel better & more present both mentally and physically.\"\n\nHolly noted that she wasn't certain if she'd be sober \"forever,\" adding, \"Don't get me wrong, I've had a year of high highs and low lows but I'm grateful I gave myself the chance to work through them consciously rather than mask my feelings (good or bad) with a drink.\"\n\nCredit: Erik Pendzich/Shutterstock\n\nDrew Barrymore\n\nThe actress revealed on CBS This Morning in December 2021 that she quit drinking alcohol two and a half years prior. “It was something I realized just did not serve me and my life,\" she said, noting that she’s \"been very private with a lot of struggles” because of social media.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if there is a revolt against the perfection right now that we are all forced to see and feel through social media,\" Barrymore explained. \"We're in an impasse and a crux of a moment where talking about how we figure ourselves out, how we fix ourselves takes a journey and solutions. Most people do it in private.\"\n\nBarrymore was previously candid about her battle with drugs as a teenager.\n\nCredit: Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nTim McGraw\n\nThe country crooner recalled how his wife, Faith Hill, helped inspire him to get sober, he wrote in an essay for Esquire magazine, published in August 2021.\n\n“I remember a moment when I was getting out of bed and going to the liquor cabinet and taking a big shot at 8:00 in the morning and thinking, ‘I have to wake the kids up.’ I went straight to my wife and said, ‘This is where I’m at.’ I was scared. She just grabbed me and hugged me and changed my life.”\n\nHe added, “I didn't know love could feel so good. Was it an emotion? Was it a lifestyle? Was it an imaginary thing? But love is all of those things.”\n\nCredit: Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nKit Harington\n\nThe actor admitted that his struggles with drinking started during Game of Thrones but hit a new low after the HBO hit ended. “You get to a place where you feel like you are a bad person, you feel like you are a shameful person. And you feel that there’s no way out, that’s just who you are,” Harington told The Sunday Times in August 2021.\n\nThe Londoner continued, “Getting sober is the process of going, ‘No, I can change.’ One of my favorite things I learnt recently is that the expression ‘a leopard doesn’t change its spots’ is completely false: that a leopard actually does change its spots. I just think that’s the most beautiful thing. It really helped. That was something I kind of clung to; the idea that I could make this huge fundamental change in who I was and how I went about my life.”\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nKehlani\n\nThe “Nights Like This” singer opened up about her decision to stop smoking marijuana in an August 2021 TikTok video.\n\n\"I used to smoke a lot of weed and now I speak on it in a past tense perspective. People think I'm s—ting on weed, I'm not! I loved weed when I was involved with it,\" she said. \"It's a beautiful plant with very nice properties when used correctly. I don't think that I was using it correctly. I think I was overusing it. I wasn't the most productive pothead.\"\n\nThe California native went on to note that smoking was hurting her vocal cords.\n\n\"I got to a point where I couldn't eat, sleep or be at a social gathering. I couldn't kick it without smoking weed and I just didn't want it to have that hold on my life anymore,” she added. “And also my throat and lungs were tired of me.”\n\nCredit: Amy Harris/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nThe singer reflected on how several factors led to their relapse and eventual overdose in 2018.\n\n“I asked for help and I didn’t receive the help that I needed. So I was stuck in this unhappy position. Here I am sober and I’m thinking to myself, ‘I’m six years sober, but I’m miserable. I’m even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?’” Lovato said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in March 2020. “Ultimately, I made the decisions that got me to where I am today. It was my actions that put me in the position that I’m in.”\n\nLovato shared what led to the 2018 relapse in their Dancing With the Devil docuseries in March 2021, later clarifying that they decided not to completely remove marijuana and alcohol from their life.\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nChristy Carlson Romano\n\nThe Kim Possible voice actress celebrated being five years sober with a TikTok video highlighting her biggest accomplishments.\n\n\"Graduated from [an] IVY league, Sober for 5 years, Have 2 daughters,\" she captioned a clip of her lip-syncing the song \"Know Yourself\" by Drake in July 2021.\n\nThe actress previously wrote in an op-ed piece for Teen Vogue about how being famous pushed her to self-destructive actions, revealing that she hadn't had any alcohol since before her first pregnancy with husband Brendan Rooney.\n\n\"I was highly criticized for my youth, which fueled my desire to prove everybody wrong. I became a bit harder-edged, binge-drank more at loud nightclubs, and started to accept the transient natures of love, sex, and friendship. Growing up, I entertained thousands of families only to feel completely lonely,\" the Even Stevens alum wrote in May 2019. \"People were as replaceable as they had deemed me to be. Imposter syndrome had stiff competition against my self-hatred at that point.\"\n\nCredit: Gregory Pace/Shutterstock\n\nPatricia Heaton\n\nThe Everybody Loves Raymond star posted a video in July 2021, sharing an exciting milestone. “It’s July when we celebrate our nation’s freedom. Also celebrating three years of freedom from alcohol for me,\" she said while on a three-mile hike. \"Just wanted to share that with you. And message me if any of you are thinking about doing that, any of you are doing that now and need some encouragement or anything at all. Have a great day.\"\n\nThe Middle star revealed her kids were the reason why she decided to get sober in a candid September 2021 interview on the “Heart of the Matter\" podcast.\n\nWhile she drank shooting the Ray Romano-led sitcom, which ran from 1996 to 2005, her drinking got worse after her four sons moved out. “I just noticed that if it was 5 p.m. and I don’t have anything to do the next day, I would start drinking automatically,” the actress said, adding that she “really started looking forward to drinking and thinking about it in a way that I hadn’t before.”\n\nHowever, it was a birthday dinner for one of her sons that made her realize she had a problem.\n\n“I was just filling my glass with red wine throughout the five or six hours that we were together. I don’t know how many glasses it was, and I felt completely sober and fine,” the Carol’s Second Act star said. “I was making a joke to the table, and I started saying, ‘You know, in our family it’s a tradition …’ And I could not pronounce the word ‘tradition.’ I tried three times, and I couldn’t say the word.”\n\nOne of her sons remarked on her inability to say the word in front of everyone. “And I was so humiliated,” she says, adding, “It shook me up. I thought, ‘That’s it. That’s it’ … It had every element that I needed. It had a logical element and had this, ‘Oh, my gosh, my sons have seen me drink too much.’”\n\nThe next day at breakfast, the Back To You actress said she told a friend, “Well, you’re the first person I’m telling this to, but this is my first day of never drinking again.”\n\nCredit: Al Wagner/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nMargo Price\n\nIn an essay for GQ, the singer revealed that when she stopped drinking alcohol in January 2021, that was \"the most rebellious thing\" she's ever done. \"I drank because I was worried about the state of the world, I drank because I was bored, I drank because I missed tour, I drank because I was unemployed, I drank because everyone else drinks,\" she revealed. \"And I drank even though I didn't really want to.\"\n\nPrice also said that she's figured out \"a version of not drinking that works\" for her. \"I'm not attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and I haven't apologized to the people in my life. As women, we are always saying we are sorry. The only one I feel the need to beg forgiveness from is myself. ... I don't identify as an alcoholic, and I have no regrets for the decisions I've made in my life. I believe everything happens for a reason. But I also believe that quitting drinking has made parenting and work easier.\"\n\nCredit: Matt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nChrissy Teigen\n\nThe cookbook author revealed in December 2020 that she was “four weeks sober” while responding to a fan’s comment on her dancing video about wanting “whatever drugs” she was on. That same month, she shared that Holly Whitaker’s book, Quit Like a Woman, inspired her sobriety journey.\n\n“One month ago, on my birthday, I got this book from my doctor and friend,” Teigen wrote via her Instagram Stories. “I was done with making an ass of myself in front of people (I'm still embarrassed), tired of day drinking and feeling like shit by 6, not being able to sleep. I have been sober ever since.”\n\nThe Cravings author marked her 50-day streak in September 2021.\n\n“Today is my 50-day sobriety streak,” she captioned an Instagram video of her attempt to work out with her kids. “It should be nearly a year but I had a few (wine) hiccups in the road. This is my longest streak yet! I still dunno if I’ll never drink again but I do know it no longer serves me in ANY way. I don’t get more fun, I don’t dance, I don’t get relaxed. I get sick, fall asleep and wake up sick, having missed what was probably a fun night.”\n\nCredit: Courtesy Anthony Hopkins/Twitter\n\nAnthony Hopkins\n\nThe Silence of the Lambs star announced in a Twitter video in December 2020 that he had reached a major milestone in his sobriety. “Forty-five years ago today, I had a wake-up call. I was headed for disaster, I was drinking myself to death,” he recalled, noting that his “life has been amazing” ever since he gave up alcohol. Hopkins went on to share an encouraging message to people struggling with substance abuse, saying in part, “Hang in there. Today is the tomorrow you were so worried about yesterday. Young people, don’t give up. Just keep in there.”\n\nIn December 2022, the Hannibal actor celebrated 47 years of sobriety and posted a heartfelt video to commemorate the occasion.\n\n\"I just want to wish everyone a happy new year and also to say I'm celebrating 47 years today of sobriety,\" he said in the clip. \"This is a message not meant to be heavy, but I hope helpful. I am a recovering alcoholic. And to you out there — I know there are people struggling.\"\n\nHe continued: \"In this day and age of cancel and hatred and non-compromise, children being bullied, I say [this]: Be kind to yourself. Be kind. Stay out of the circle of toxicity with people, if they offend you. Live your life. Be proud of your life.\"\n\nCredit: Christopher Polk @POLKIMAGING/Shutterstock\n\nFrench Montana\n\nThe Moroccan rapper revealed he hadn't consumed alcohol since he landed in the ICU for nearly two weeks in November 2019. \"Too much drinking, too many pills, you know, boom,\" he said during a December 2020 interview with XXL. \"It was just overdoing something for too long. And, to the point where now [being] sober is becoming my new high. People [saw] I was out of control, not me, you know what I'm saying? Because, it's almost like working out. You don't see [yourself] getting big because you see yourself every day. It's the same thing with you being out of control.\"\n\nBefore his hospitalization, Montana's drug use was \"a hobby\" that eventually transformed into \"being an addiction.\" In the year since his health scare, the Grammy nominee has faced life with a new perspective. \"I think that was the hardest thing I ever did in my life, to snatch myself back,\" he told XXL. \"So, for me to stop everything and just step back, that was, like, one of my biggest accomplishments.\"\n\nCredit: Tammie Arroyo/AFF-USA.com/MEGA\n\nMiley Cyrus\n\nThe singer celebrated six months of sobriety in June 2020 after undergoing a “really big vocal surgery” the previous November. “I did a lot of family history, which has a lot of addiction and mental health challenges,” she told Variety at the time. “So just going through that and asking, ‘Why am I the way that I am?’ By understanding the past, we understand the present and the future much more clearly. The former Disney Channel star revealed in November 2020 that she was two weeks sober after having a setback amid the coronavirus pandemic. “I fell off and I realized that I now am back on sobriety, two weeks sober, and I feel like I really accepted that time,” Cyrus told Zane Lowe during an Apple Music’s New Music Daily interview. “One of the things I’ve used is, ‘Don’t get furious, get curious.’ So don’t be mad at yourself, but ask yourself, ‘What happened?’ To me, it was a f—k up because I’m not a moderation person, and I don’t think that everyone has to be f—king sober.”\n\nCredit: Kelsey McNeal/ABC\n\nCheryl Burke\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars pro revealed she is two years sober during a September 2020 episode of the “LadyGang” podcast. “It was just a decision that I made for myself,” she said. “And it was when Matt [Lawrence] and I got engaged and it was during that engagement party that we were just like — or that I was like, he didn’t even know — I was just like, I was done. My father passed away — and then my dad was an alcoholic — so either I was gonna crash and burn and check myself into rehab or I was gonna just quit cold turkey. That’s just my personality. It’s either black or white.”\n\nCredit: Mike Marsland/WireImage for Rosewood Hotels and Resorts\n\nJohn Mayer\n\nThe “Waiting on the World To Change” singer can thank Drake for helping him get clean. Mayer revealed in the November 2018 cover story of Complex that he hadn’t had a drink since Drake’s 30th birthday party two years earlier. After making “a fool” of himself at the rapper’s October 2016 bash and suffering a six-day hangover, Mayer says he asked himself, “‘OK, John, what percentage of your potential would you like to have? Because if you say you’d like 60, and you’d like to spend the other 40 having fun, that’s fine. But what percentage of what is available to you would you like to make happen? There’s no wrong answer. What is it?’ I went, ‘100.’” He added of alcohol, “If you look at drinking the way you would look at anything else, which is risk-reward, what am I giving up? What am I getting? It’s some of the worst odds that ever existed.”\n\nCredit: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images\n\nKelly Osbourne\n\nThe reality star frequently talked about rehab and sobriety for years. On August 9, 2018, she took to Instagram to share that she’d had a relapse — but was celebrating a year of sobriety once again.\n\n“This past year has been one of the hardest years of my life and I feel it’s time share that with you guys. To cut a long story short things got really dark… The only way I knew how to function was to self medicate and go from project to project so I never had to focus on what was really going on with me,” she wrote.\n\nOsbourne turned her life around through her own hard work and with the help of family and friends. “I could not have done this with out there love and support. I can’t believe It’s been a year!!!,” she continued. “I can whole heartedly confess that I’m finally at peace with myself and truly starting to understand what true happiness is.”\n\nOsbourne revealed in April 2021 that she relapsed again after almost four years of sobriety.\n\n“I relapsed. Not proud of it. But I am back on track,\" the former Fashion Police host said via her Instagram Story.\n\nThe Masked Singer alum confirmed that she is currently sober and would continue to be sober from here on out.\n\n“But I’ve learned it truly is just one day at a time,” she explained. \"And I just want to tell you guys the truth because I never, ever want to lie to you. Thank you so much for your support and your love.”\n\nDuring an appearance on Red Table Talk, Osbourne also reflected on how a medical procedure started her addiction when she was younger, noting, \"I had a really bad case of tonsillitis. They ended up having to give me some crazy surgery and then after that they gave me Vicodin and that was all I needed.\""
