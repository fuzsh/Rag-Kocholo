        "text": "Mace History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe surname Mace came to England as a result of the Norman Conquest in 1006. The name is derived from Macé or La Ferté-Macé, a place name in Orne, France, having derived from the Old French for the Christian name Matthew 1 2 or Mathieu 3 and also meant \"a staff borne as an ensign of office.\" 4\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Mace family\n\nThe surname Mace was first found in Normandy, France where William de Mes held lands (1180-1195) according to the source (Magni Rotuli Scaccarii Normanniae) 5\n\nEarly English rolls show the first entry in Bedfordshire where Richard Mace was recorded in 1229. A few years later in 1236 at Oseney (or Osney) Abbey in Oxfordshire, the singular name \"Mace\" with no forename was recorded in 1236. \"Mace, now represented in Chipping Norton, was an Oxfordshire name in the reign of Edward I.\" 6\n\nLondon records show Perotus de Mace there in 1319 and later in Colchester, Essex William Mace was listed in 1372. 7\n\nMasse is recorded in the Pipe Rolls of Suffolk in 1177 and in 1194 Osbert Masse is mentioned in the Pipe Rolls of Norfolk. The Curia Regis Rolls of Middlesex contain a reference to John de Maci in 1221 and Adam Mace of Oxfordshire and William Mace of Co. Buckinghamshire are recorded in the Hundredorum Rolls of 1273. 8\n\nClosely related to the Massey surname, the origins of both names are closely intertwined.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Mace family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Mace research. Another 58 words (4 lines of text) covering the years 1353, 1583, 1592, 1609, 1612, 1636, 1644, 1672, 1676, 1706, 1727, 1729 and 1753 are included under the topic Early Mace History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nMace Spelling Variations\n\nNorman surnames are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. The frequent changes in surnames are largely due to the fact that the Old and Middle English languages lacked definite spelling rules. The introduction of Norman French to England, as well as the official court languages of Latin and French, also had pronounced influences on the spelling of surnames. Since medieval scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, rather than adhering to any specific spelling rules, it was common to find the same individual referred to with different spellings. The name has been spelled Mace, Macey, Massey and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Mace family\n\nOutstanding amongst the family at this time was\n\nThomas Mace (c.1612-1706), an English lutenist, viol player, singer, composer and musical theorist, best known for his work \"Musick's Monument\" (1676.)

He became Presby...\n\nMace World Ranking\n\nIn the United States, the name Mace is the 2,874th most popular surname with an estimated 9,948 people with that name. 9 However, in France, the name Mace is ranked the 351st most popular surname with an estimated 11,592 people with that name. 10\n\nLoading...\n\nMace migration to the United States +\n\nMany English families emigrated to North American colonies in order to escape the political chaos in Britain at this time. Unfortunately, many English families made the trip to the New World under extremely harsh conditions. Overcrowding on the ships caused the majority of the immigrants to arrive diseased, famished, and destitute from the long journey across the stormy Atlantic. Despite these hardships, many of the families prospered and went on to make invaluable contributions to the development of the cultures of the United States and Canada.

They made many attempts but failed in some to establish settlements on the Islands including Saint Lucia and Grenada. By 1627 they had managed to establish settlements on St. Kitts (St. Christopher) and Barbados, but by 1641 the Spanish had moved in and destroyed some of these including those at Providence Island. The British continued to expand the settlements including setting the First Federation in the British West Indies by 1674; some of the islands include Barbados, Bermuda, Cayman Island, Turks and Caicos, Jamaica and Belize then known as British Honduras. By the 1960's many of the islands became independent after the West Indies Federation which existed from 1958 to 1962 failed due to internal political conflicts. After this a number of Eastern Caribbean islands formed a free association. 14\n\nMace Settlers in West Indies in the 17th Century\n\nMiss Alice Mace, (b. 1613), aged 22, British settler travelling from London, England aboard the ship \"Peter Bonaventure\" arriving in Barbados and St Christopher (Saint Kitts) in 1635 15\n\nContemporary Notables of the name Mace (post 1700) +\n\nJem Mace (1831-1910), English boxing champion, nicknamed \"The Gypsy\", inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990\n\nDame Georgina Mary Mace DBE, FRS (1953-2020), British ecologist and conservation scientist, Professor of Biodiversity and Ecosystems at University College London\n\nJoe Mace (b. 1971), British television producer\n\nNancy Ruth Mace (b. 1977), American businesswoman and the author of \"In the Company of Men: A Woman at The Citadel\"\n\nJames E.
