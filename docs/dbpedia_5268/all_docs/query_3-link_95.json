        "text": "In trying to keep up with the vast pace of developments across many fronts, I have started to hypothesize something. Perhaps it is oversimplified. Perhaps it is just wrong. I am open to all eventualities, I'm sharing this to get feedback. When Mike Johnson did his complete turnaround, I started to wonder what he could possibly have been told that changed his view so drastically. It is tempting to think it was some personal threat to his reputation or family. But that is a low-context explanation that could apply to anything, and as such is not very informative, imo. What if, what he was told, is that what is going on is pretty much the opening moves for WW3? See the map below and think about what was recently approved with the help of Mike Johnson: - Warrantless wiretapping - TikTok forced sale or banning - Funding for Ukraine - Funding for Israel - Funding for Taiwan - No funding for strenghtening the border (and actually perhaps some funding to get *more* people into the US) Basically, infowar funding for the internals of the empire, and actual war funding to support the borderlands (Taiwan, Israel, Ukraine) against the rising BRICS powers. And an entry to the US of cheap workforce that will be needed to set up a new industrial base. At best we end up with a new Cold War. If we're lucky.\n\nMaverick - “That's one of life's great mysteries.” A perfect summary of careers for many talented individuals most of whom belong to under-served, unrepresented, and ignored communities. \"You can’t get a promotion, you won’t retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die.\" (Watch the clip or read the transcript) Why is that? It's time to see change - opportunity - equity! To all the leaders, heads of institutions and agencies out there - Let's see if you have the courage to move away from academic exercises and make a real change for Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility!

Only man to shoot down three enemy planes in the last 40 years. “Distinguished.” “Distinguished.” “distinguished.” Yet you can’t get a promotion, you won’t retire, and despite your best efforts, you refuse to die. You should be at least a two-star admiral by now, if not a senator. Yet here you are: Captain. Why is that?

With a new trailer out this week, the Dave Filoni-created Star Wars: Tales of the Empire serves up a look at two storylines involving former Jedi Barriss Offee (voiced by Meredith Salenger) and warrior Morgan Elsbeth (Diana Lee Inosanto) and how they find their way to the Galactic Empire — vengeance, it’s always vengeance. The series also features the formidable General Grievous (Matthew Wood), Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) Lyn aka Fourth Sister (Rya Kihlstedt), Wing (Wing T. Chao), and Grand Inquisitor (Jason Isaacs). Star Wars: Tales of the Empire premieres on May 4 (of course) on Disney+. var facebookPixelLoaded = false; window.addEventListener('load', function(){ document.addEventListener('scroll', facebookPixelScript); document.addEventListener('mousemove', facebookPixelScript); }) function facebookPixelScript() { if (!facebookPixelLoaded) { facebookPixelLoaded = true; document.removeEventListener('scroll', facebookPixelScript); document.removeEventListener('mousemove', facebookPixelScript); !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s){if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod? n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)};if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n; n.push=n;n.loaded=!0;n.version='2.0';n.queue=[];t=b.createElement(e);t.async=!0; t.src=v;s=b.getElementsByTagName(e)[0];s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}(window, document,'script','//https://lnkd.in/eY9zQvVb'); fbq('init', '1453039084979896'); fbq('track', \"PageView\"); } } Source link By Nakisisa George\n\nIn 2017, I had a chance to spend the summer with the Polish Air Force, flying their jets and instructing their pilots. At first, I was thrilled - literally a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Then that little voice of doubt chimed in: \"I had just become an instructor pilot a handful of days before I got the nod. Pretty much any other instructor would be more experienced than I was.\" \"They hadn't had any women flying their F-16s. How would I fit into the squadron there? Would they take instruction from me??\" I suddenly saw this internal conversation from a third-person perspective. I realized this was the exact scenario I had been working on shifting my mindset toward. That's when I decided to view the situation differently and recognized my inner critic for what it was — a voice, not a verdict. That moment of clarity made the decision for me. I went to Poland. Was it daunting? Absolutely. Was it worth it?? HELL YES. It took a long period of intentional work - not to stop the voice, but to have perspective on it. I wanted to get to a place where I could acknowledge it but also look logically at the risks and rewards that came with the decision I was debating. Understanding how to tame this nagging voice in my head was such a game-changer for me. And I know so many of you face similar debates every day, which you realize is preventing you from unleashing your full potential. Don't let your inner critic steal amazing opportunities from you. Acknowledge it. Then do the thing. 🚀 ------------------------ 𝗽.𝘀.

The most uncomfortable scene for me was when he attempted to offer CEO-worthy inspiration for his team that was preparing to walk into a high-stakes meeting. He exhorts them: \"Remember to focus on your breath. When you breathe in, know you're breathing in. When you breathe out, simply know you're breathing out.\" Spoiler 🚨 : it doesn't land. Once he leaves the room, a teammate responds with \"What the hell is he talking about?\" It takes one to know one, but I think Phil was using a defense mechanism called spiritual bypassing. Spiritual bypass is \"the tendency to use spiritual ideas and practices to sidestep or avoid facing unresolved emotional issues, psychological wounds, and unfinished developmental tasks\" (thanks, Wikipedia). I don't like feeling uncomfortable either, so I totally get what he was going for. But sometimes -- okay, almost always -- the way forward is the way through, not around. Naming the uncomfortable feeling, whether it's resentment or fear or overwhelm, is the first step to getting to REALITY. And that's the space in which a leader needs to play.\n\n🔥🎙️Alright folks, gather 'round, it's story time on LinkedIn, of all places. And no, I'm not here to tell you about the virtues of waking up at 4 AM to hustle—today, we're talking about a real-life superhero, minus the cape, and a ton of humility. I just read about Jake Larson, a 101-year-old WWII veteran, who's packing up to hit France for the 80th D-Day anniversary. 🇫🇷✈️ Now, this guy landed on Omaha Beach, dodged enough bullets to make any action movie look like a slow dance, and still insists he's not a hero. Imagine that! Today, if you make it through a Zoom meeting without technical issues, you’re labeled a \"warrior.\" 😂 Jake's story got me thinking—what’s with our obsession with calling ourselves heroes for doing, you know, basic stuff? This man literally walked through a minefield, and his biggest concern is making sure the real heroes, the ones who didn’t come back, get the recognition they deserve. And here we are, practically throwing a parade if we manage to get through the day without gluten. 🍞❌ So, what’s the deal with heroism today? It seems like the bar's pretty low. Back in Jake’s day, heroism was about sacrifice, about doing something bigger than yourself. Nowadays, it seems like people want a medal for getting out of bed. I mean, come on! Let’s take a page out of Papa Jake’s book (yeah, he's on TikTok by the way, raking in followers with stories from the trenches—not the Twitter kind). The guy's a walking, talking history lesson on what real grit looks like. And get this—he’s still humble about it! We need to rethink what it means to be a hero. It's not about the applause or the likes you rack up online. It's about what you do when no one's watching, how you handle the tough stuff, and whether you stand up for others. 🛡️ So, next time you want to call yourself a hero, ask yourself: Am I really doing something heroic, or am I just doing my job? Let's save the hero tag for folks who truly deserve it, like Jake. #Heroism #Humility #RealHeroes #WWII #Veterans #LeadershipLessons #LifeLessons"
