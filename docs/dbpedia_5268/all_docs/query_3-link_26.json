        "text": "THE MACK SENNETT COLLECTION: VOLUME ONE\n\n\"Over a 21-year period from 1912 to 1933, the short and feature films produced by Mack Sennett (and released under the banners of Keystone Comedies and Mack Sennett Comedies) played a large part in creating the style and language that has forever defined visual humor in motion pictures, earning Sennett the nickname \"the King of Comedy\" and recognition as the father of American film comedy.\"\n\n– Brent Walker, \"Mack Sennett's Fun Factory: A History and Filmography of His Studio and His Keystone and Mack Sennett Comedies, with Biographies of Players and Personnel\"\n\nSennett's historic studio - dubbed the \"Fun Factory\" - was at one time home to nearly every major silent screen comedian including Mabel Normand, Roscoe \"Fatty\" Arbuckle, Harold Lloyd, Gloria Swanson, Wallace Beery, Harry Langdon, Marie Dressler, Ben Turpin, The Keystone Cops, the Mack Sennett Bathing Beauties, Ford Sterling, Charley Chase, Al St. John, Mack Swain, Edgar Kennedy, Chester Conklin, Slim Summerville, Polly Moran, Ford Sterling, Billy Bevan, Louise Fazenda, Vernon Dent, Carole Lombard, W.C. Fields, Syd Chaplin and Charlie Chaplin, who introduced his beloved Tramp character under the auspices of Keystone, in 1914 (CHAPLIN AT KEYSTONE, also available from GME).\n\nNow, for the first time, the best of these surviving Sennett comedies have been gathered from around the world, fully restored, and digitally re- mastered in HD. THE MACK SENNETT COLLECTION: VOLUME ONE features 50 of these films presented together on a 3-disc Blu-ray set. (These films are also available in DVD-R format, upon request). This seminal collection also includes films directed, written, and acted in by Sennett for the Biograph Co. (1908-1912), as well as numerous bonus extras, including an episode from the television broadcast, \"This is Your Life\" in 1954, that pays tribute to this pioneering comedy producer.\n\nThese new editions have been painstakingly reconstructed by CineMuseum and Keystone Films using original 35mm nitrate, archival negatives, preservation materials, and sometimes the lone known surviving film print, from the collections of the Library of Congress, the Museum of Modern Art, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Blackhawk Films®, Lobster Films, the Richard M. Roberts Collection, Gierucki Studios, and dozens of privately held archives."
