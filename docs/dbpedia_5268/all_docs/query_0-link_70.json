        "text": "As high-achievers, we often push ourselves relentlessly. However, burnout is real and can sabotage our productivity and well-being. That's why I've made it non-negotiable to take time for myself each day to recharge. For me, this means closing the laptop, putting my phone away, and doing something solely for myself—whether it's working out in my garage gym, taking a walk, or learning a new skill. This personal time allows me to reset and return to work feeling refreshed and focused. Setting communication boundaries is also crucial. You don't have to respond to emails, DMs, or texts the second someone else decides to send them. While it may feel uncomfortable at first, establishing these guardrails is vital for sustainable success. I encourage you to examine your own boundaries: • Where can you start saying \"no\" to work demands during personal time? • How can you be more intentional about unplugging? Don't let the grind consume you! Prioritize your mental health, and you'll be amazed at how it boosts your overall performance. How do you recharge and reset? ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm a former fighter pilot turned speaker, author, and coach.

But for me, it's so much more than a convenient hairstyle. It's a beacon for little girls everywhere who have stood on the sideline, waiting for their chance. It's a symbol of possibility! When we show children what's achievable, we expand their horizons. We give them permission to dream BIGGER. Your view of your potential in the world is shaped by what you've been exposed to. Show your daughters. 👧🏼 Show your sons. 👦🏼 Let them discover what's possible! 🚀 ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm a former fighter pilot turned speaker, author, and coach.

A key lesson I've learned is to outsmart the \"pleasure principle.\" Too often, we say yes for immediate gratification. But in both the cockpit and on stage, I've realized the importance of aligning actions with priorities. When I began speaking, opportunities flooded in. I initially said yes to everything because closing deals felt good, even when they didn't align with my goals. I quickly learned that saying no to opportunities that weren't a good fit allowed me to focus time and energy toward keynotes that truly excited me and aligned with my objectives. Each of those tended to lead to more that fell into that same category. The takeaway? Selective focus drives meaningful success. What strategic \"no\" has made a difference in your journey? ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm a former fighter pilot turned speaker, author, and coach.

Check it out here 👇🏻 https://lnkd.in/gPePdteW ------------------------\n\nWhen I was preparing to leave the military for the uncharted waters of entrepreneurship, I was terrified. Here's how I pushed through self-doubt and took action (and so can you): Acknowledge your fears ⤵ • Identify specific concerns • Write them down to gain perspective • Remember that discomfort often signals growth. Reframe the risk ⤵ • Consider the long-term consequences of inaction • Evaluate if worst-case scenarios are likely or permanent • Focus on potential gains rather than losses. Interrupt negative thought patterns ⤵ • Take a deep breath • Label the thought as unhelpful • Consciously shift to a more constructive mindset Summon your support system ⤵ • Imagine what advice they'd give • Draw strength from their belief in you • Reach out to real-life mentors or friends if needed. Choose courage over comfort ⤵ • Start with small, manageable steps • Celebrate each bit of progress • Build confidence through repeated exposure. Follow this framework, and with time, you'll develop the resilience to pursue your goals confidently. Using this framework, I've: • Had many firsts • Authored two children's books and have more in the works • Delivered speeches to tens of thousands in the US and internationally • Launched my Badass Masterclass • Created time and financial flexibility for myself • Found something I'm passionate about Overcoming self-doubt is a skill that improves with practice, but the discomfort of uncertainty is worth the rewards. What's one goal you've been hesitating to pursue due to self-doubt? ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle. I'm a former fighter pilot turned speaker, author, and coach.

Now, let's zoom out and seek a different vantage point: 1. Does this inner voice have any traits? 2. What does it sound like or look like? 3. What types of situations cause it to get loud? 4. Does it resemble a person or group of people from your past? Write down (or even draw out) your insights. Giving your inner critic a form on paper diminishes its control, allowing you to acknowledge it while moving forward. How does that 👆🏻 shift your perception of your inner critic? If you can rise above the daily chatter, over time and with practice, you will begin to see things differently: 𝗢𝘂𝗿 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗖𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗰 𝗶𝘀 𝗼𝗻𝗹𝘆 𝗮 𝘀𝘂𝗯𝗷𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗿𝘆 𝗰𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗿𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘆 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗽𝗮𝘀𝘁, 𝗳𝗲𝗮𝗿𝘀, 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗻𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿𝘀, 𝗻𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗺𝗼𝗿𝗲. This practice will help you develop the habit of recognizing your inner critic for what it is: a voice, not a verdict.

I was a complete rookie, and it wasn't an easy adjustment. Here's how embracing \"beginner mode\" transformed my journey: 𝗖𝘂𝗿𝗶𝗼𝘀𝗶𝘁𝘆 • Instead of hiding my ignorance, I asked questions constantly. • This openness led to unexpected mentors and collaborations. 𝗖𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗶𝘁𝘆 • Without preconceived notions, I approached problems creatively. • My \"rookie\" ideas often became innovative solutions to problems. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 • Each \"failure\" became a learning opportunity. I built the grit to keep pushing through setbacks. 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗶𝗰𝗶𝘁𝘆 • Admitting my beginner status fostered genuine connections. • People appreciated my honesty and were eager to help. 𝗚𝗿𝗼𝘄𝘁𝗵 • The beginner's mindset became a permanent asset. • I now seek out \"beginner moments\" to stay sharp and innovative. 𝗕𝗲𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮 𝗯𝗲𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗿 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗴𝗶𝗳𝘁. When you lean into and embrace the fear of being new, you'll open doors to opportunities that wouldn't be possible otherwise. ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle.

During those first few training flights in the F-16, it felt like I was drinking from a firehose. Every flight was complex and was analyzed and critiqued at a high level. To make matters worse, my struggle with imposter syndrome led me on a quest for the perfect flight. But in reality, this mindset held me back. My job wasn't to be perfect - it was to be effective, adaptable, and learn from my mistakes. Perfection was a standard I would never meet in the environment I was operating in. With this in mind, I started focusing on improvement rather than perfection. I eventually embraced flight debriefs as learning opportunities, not personal critiques. This mindset shift was a game-changer and improved my performance dramatically. That's when I realized: 𝗣𝗲𝗿𝗳𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘀𝗺 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆. I learned that pursuing excellence, not perfection, made me a better pilot, teammate, and leader. This shift in mindset allowed me to show more courage and take on tasks that stretched my abilities. \"Good enough\" isn't about lowering standards. It's about taking action, learning, and constantly improving. Does this mindset surprise you? Have you had a similar experience? Drop it in the comments! ------------------------ Hi, I'm Michelle.
