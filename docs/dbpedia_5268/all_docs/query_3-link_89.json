        "text": "Those of you who live in the Midlands may have seen Bob Warman and Sameena Ali-Khan preview a feature on our new DVD release this evening…\n\n…Central Tonight will be reporting on our co-production with ATVLand.productions, From ‘ATVLand’ in Colour tomorrow evening (Wednesday 26th October) at 6pm. Those of you reading this from outside of the region will be able to view Central Tonight online after the programme, tomorrow HERE\n\nFrom ‘ATVLand’ in Colour has been a labour of love for the guys at ATVLand.Productions, and their infectious enthusiasm for the ATV Centre and regional production as a whole has meant MACE’s partnership with them in bringing this 4 hour documentary to DVD has been a great experience – their passion for the region complementing MACE’s core aims of preserving and providing access to the screen heritage of the Midlands.\n\nEven better now, that viewers of the programme are reacting so positively to the documentary, with 5 star reviews on Amazon, a wonderful write up on Cathode Ray Tube, and orders from, not only the Midlands, but Scotland, Wales, Switzerland and the USA.\n\nMACE have sold over 250 copies in the DVD’s second week of release, and enthusiasm for the DVD is spreading across the internet.\n\nWhen ATVland.Productions and MACE first discussed collaborating in bringing their documentary to DVD, we talked of From ‘ATVLand’ in Colour having a specific appeal to those interested in TV history. What has been, perhaps not surprising, is that the DVD is actually having a much broader appeal, especially for those who fondly remember ATV (Associated Television) and the regional and national programmes that were made in Birmingham.\n\nI hope, like me, you’ll be tuning into Central Tonight tomorrow to remember with Bob Warman and colleagues, a vibrant and exciting time in the history of television… all from studios in Birmingham.\n\nTo purchase the DVD:\n\nFrom the MACE website Shop – CLICK HERE\n\nFrom Amazon – CLICK HERE\n\nTRAILERS\n\nTRAILER 1\n\nTRAILER 2\n\nWhat a fantastic weekend of films, walks, tours and lectures we had this weekend in Belper, Derbyshire. The Discovery Days Festival is still running until 30th October so there is still time to catch even more events! For more information visit http://www.derwentvalleymills.org. At The Ritz queues were forming to see the newly discovered films found through the Full Circle project of Belper and surrounding area.\n\nThe films we were screening at the Ritz were a mixture of home-movies and professional footage. Some of the home-movie material had been deposited with the Full Circle project by Stephen Walters and showed scenes in and around Belper during the 1960s.\n\nTeresa Mikula produces the BBC programme ‘Preserving the Past‘. She has been supporting the Full Circle project and helping to bring the found footage to a wider audience. She interviewed Stephen about his uncle’s film collection and we will be seeing more of the footage and the interview in the Autumn series. Stephen said about the film screening:\n\nI wouldn’t have missed it for the world! It was lovely to see the films up on the big screen and I’m looking forward to having a copy of my uncle’s film collection to view on DVD\n\nTeresa Mikula, BBC producer of “Preserving the Past” interviews Stephen Walters\n\nThe other home-movie footage The Wright/Radcliffe Collection, found through Full Circle featured scenes in and around Ashbourne & Kniveton in the 1930s – this is really rare footage and is quite a big collection – over 90 reels – which is still in the process of being assessed. Our thanks go to Peter Frost who deposited this collection with MACE.\n\nThe collection of films shown also included a lovely 1955 British Transport travel guide to Derbyshire, ATV footage of the controversial closure of East Mill Belper in 1986 and a small independent film made in the 1980s about climbing friends ascent of High Tor in Matlock Bath which had the audience on the edge of their seats!\n\nA HERITAGE of HERITAGE EVENTS!\n\nAn Invitation to all Nottinghamshire & Derbyshire Museums, Heritage Groups, Local Historical & Genealogical Societies & Community Groups to join with us to celebrate Nottinghamshire & Derbyshire Heritage, ALFRETON LEISURE CENTRE, Church Street, Alfreton, DE55 7BD 10am to 4pm Children 16 and under Free, Adults £1\n\nCome and see Kay, senior curator of Full Circle at the Full Circle stall and find out how your films can be preserved for future generations to enjoy.\n\nThe Fred Alvey films were shot by Roy’s brother Fred Alvey. He started filming in 1955. A film enthusiast, Fred also put on public film shows at Alfreton town hall in the 1970s. The collection, which Roy has kindly donated to the archive, includes footage of the Cromford Raft Races. The collection also includes some 1950s 8mm footage shot from the window of a moving car, depicting a complete journey from Alfreton to Derby.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the camera was mounted inside the car, and the footage filmed by shooting still frames at intervals, a kind of stop-motion effect similar to that used in animation films. The final film, when played back, appears dramatically speeded up, and takes the viewer on a whirlwind tour of the area. The footage offers a fascinating insight into everyday life and street scenes which are often neglected by filmmaker in favour of family events or special occasions.\n\nOrganiser: ALFRETON & DISTRICT HERITAGE TRUST Vice Chair – Paul Nichols Tel 01773 604809 http://www.alfretonheritage.com In Conjunction With: JACKSDALE AREA CULTURE & HERITAGE Secretary – Carol Taylor-Cockayne Tel 01773 603440 www.jacksdale.org.uk Email: zyg1010@care4free.net\n\nIf you have any films or moving image that you would like to share with the community and preserve for future generations to enjoy then contact Kay Ogilvie, senior curator on kay.ogilvie@tiscali.co.uk\n\nCome along and celebrate Discovery Days Film Season this weekend at the Ritz Cinema, King Street, Belper. Ring 01773 822224 for seat prices and to book. We are pleased to help bring rare film footage found through MACE’s Full Circle project to one of the finest independent cinemas in the UK.\n\nWe will be screening footage from the Peter Frost Collection and the Norman Mellors Collection.\n\nThe late Norman Mellor of Belper, used to go to the old Ritz in Belper regularly where his father worked as the projectionist. This led to Norman becoming very interested in filmmaking, he bought himself a cine camera in the early 1950s and filmed many local events in and around Belper, Derbyshire. His nephew Stephen Walters has been clearing out his late uncle’s house and found Norman’s film collection.\n\nStephen said: “Uncle Norman worked at LB Plastics based at Heage and Norman took his camera on holiday with him and also filmed many Belper Town football matches as he loved football and went to most of their matches.”\n\nFrom 21st until 29th October Frequency 2011 will transform Lincoln into an interactive sensory playground with work by local, national and international artists. Barry Hale & Uzma Johal, Festival Directors at Frequency 2011 brought a very special 16mm film of Francis Bacon to the MACE film archive. We were pleased to be able to help them by copying this rare film onto an accessible DV-CAM format so that it could be screened at the festival.\n\nFestival Director Uzma Johal from Threshold Studios said:\n\n“This is a truly unique event marking the beginning of an exciting journey for Lincoln, its artists, academics and local people to come together in celebrating the pioneering spirit of contemporary digital culture and take its place as an active contributor on the international circuit of digital culture and arts festivals.”\n\nThe nine-day event will take place in a range of locations throughout Lincoln including established arts venues The Collection, the Usher Gallery, Lincoln Drill Hall and the University of Lincoln.\n\nThe festival will also embrace non-traditional and unexpected locations across the city in an effort to engage local residents as well as artists and academics.\n\nRunning throughout the festival will be seminars, workshops and debates and an exciting programme of activities for children which will coincide with the October half-term holiday.\n\nDetails can be found on the website http://www.frequency.org.uk.\n\nThroughout MACE’s time at the University of Leicester, MACE shared an office with the East Midlands Oral History Archive. This may sound like it was a squeeze, and we certainly did have a lot of desks in a small place, but the East Midlands Oral History Archive (EMOHA) is actually one very knowledgable man (and rather fine musician!) Colin Hyde.\n\nWhen MACE left the University of Leicester on 9th September, we said a poignant goodbye to Colin, so today it was wonderful to see him as he visited our new archive at the University of Lincoln and looked round our space.\n\nHere he is below looking at our new DVD release, From ATVLand in Colour, with Julie Ives, who is in her final year of a PhD at the University of Leicester, and MACE Archivist, Kayla Thompson.\n\nTonight, Wednesday 12th October, The Colony at The Drum\n\nControversial at the time of its original broadcast, this is a powerful film which explores the lives of Caribbean migrant communities living in Birmingham and the Midlands. Including interviews with Stan Crooke a railway signal man from St Kitts living in Balsall Heath and Bernice Smith a Jamaican teacher working at St James’ Primary School in Handsworth. This screening compliments the launch of the BBC’s ‘Reel History of Britain’ featuring Melvyn Bragg.\n\nby Philip Donnellan\n\nClick on the photo to book tickets!\n\nThe Drum are helping our Full Circle Film Search by looking for home-movies, or old cinefilm shot by your relatives that relate to your local area! http://www.the-drum.org.uk/news/full-circle/\n\nMACE’s Full Circle Project pairs up with The Drum to search for home-movies\n\nIf you have any old cinefilm or home-movies relating to the Birmingham, Aston and wider Midlands area and are not sure what to do with them… Bring them along to The Drum this evening and speak to myself, Full Circle Project Curator – Lucie Kerley – email:lkerley@lincoln.ac.uk or call: 07919 896505 if you are interested in hearing about the possibility of digitising this material in order to make it accessible and preserve it for future generations.\n\nhttp://www.macearchive.org\n\nhttp://www.macearchive.org/Full-Circle.html – For more information please check out.\n\nSee you there!!"
