        "text": "Mabel aficionados, and plenty of others, will know of Mabel at the Wheel. This was a film intended to boost Mabel’s screen persona to new heights. Admittedly, it was unusual at that time for a studio to even release a star’s name, let alone develop their character. However, we are talking about the unusual circumstances pervading the Keystone Studio. The Mabel of the screen was the real-life Mabel, and the real-life Mabel was responsible for bringing success to Keystone and Mack Sennett. For this Mabel demanded total loyalty from Sennett – no big-name female stars in her films, and no boosting of any actresses who may come onto the lot. Furthermore, she insisted that no man should steal a scene from her, although originals like Ford Sterling, Fred Mace, and Mack Swain, could compliment her as leading men.\n\nMabel got her way, and in early 1914, two months before Mabel At The Wheel, a humdinger of a film would be made that showcased The Keystone Girl, at the exclusion of Sterling, Swain and Roscoe Arbuckle. Although a single-reeler, the film was intended to lead Mabel later into a big (for the time) two-reeler (Mabel At The Wheel). A rough script had been drawn up for the single-reeler called Mabel’s Strange Predicament, but, unfortunately, Mack and Mabel were stuck on how to construct the first scene, which was to be in, and around, a hotel lobby. A new, highly skilled gag-man had just arrived at the studio, and Sennett grabbed him. His name was Charlie Chaplin. “Put on a comedy costume”, said the boss, “then get on the set, and see what you can do”. Chaplin obliged, and used the costume of a character he knew from the music hall – the tramp. Chaplin then gave a sparkling impression of a drunken tramp falling around the lobby, for which he received an ovation from the assembled studio people. It was not originally planned that the drunk guy would appear in more than one short scene, according to the extant pre-shoot synopsis.\n\nAfter quickly filming the scene, it appears Chaplin was whisked away to film in Venice, under direction of Pathe Lehrman (Kid Auto Races at Venice), while still in the tramp’s outfit. It is the records contained in Mack Sennett’s private papers that indicate the two films were made on the same day. On his return, some three hours later, Chaplin was put into a subsequent lobby scene, but it seems much filming had been done without him, although some elements of the story were changed after Chaplin’s second scene in order to include Chaplin’s character within the whole plot. This resulted in some inconsistency in the film. In one scene a woman is seen in the hotel lobby smelling a flower, although Chaplin did not give the flower to her until a later scene. Also, Mabel’s boyfriend deposits a bunch of flowers in her room, but the flowers were already present in an earlier scene. These seem to be big slip-ups, even for Keystone. We can only conclude that Chaplin gags were added, which interfered with the continuity of the film [Endnote 1].\n\nMabel’s Strange Predicament – a historical record?\n\nWe might think that this film has no relevance as history, even of the movie industry. Nevertheless, it might be possible to plot the rise of Chaplin’s tramp from anomalies in the film. Firstly, we know that the film’s intended director was a fake Frenchman called Pathe Lehrman. It was he that took Chaplin to Venice, and had great fun pushing the tramp around while filming the Kid Auto Races. Lehrman it seems became angry about\n\nthe ovations Chaplin had received for his performance, as the tramp in the first lobby scene of Mabel’s Strange Predicament. Chaplin sought to introduce numerous gags, and a massive argument took place with Lehrman. Sennett immediately demoted Lehrman to extra for the duration of the film, and installed himself as director (look out for Mr. ‘Ego’ Lehrman lurking at the back of the lobby and outside the hotel). The first lobby scene is interesting, for the film opens with Mabel and Charlie standing in the lobby together. Mabel departs after 13 seconds, but Charlie then holds the scene for a further 42 seconds, a staggering length for 1914 (75 feet of film in total). Bearing in mind that Mabel was the star of the picture, this was most unusual. In fact we know that Lehrman (who like everyone was in love with Mabel) tried to get most of the Chaplin scene cut out, but failed. We can also believe that Mabel would have expected that most of the scene would be cut. Charlie had effectively stolen the scene from Mabel. Of course, this is followed by two short scenes for Mabel, but they are split by a longer scene for Charlie in the lobby. The scene where Mabel poses briefly outside the hotel, then enters via the hotel steps, was probably intended to be the first scene, and crafted to get the audience warmed up as they recognized their favorite star. Chaplin records that his appearance was met with silence from the audience at first, as he was not then well known. It seems likely that Mabel’s entry to the hotel scene was shot while Charlie was absent. In the film, Mabel then enters the lobby and storms upstairs to her room, after some unwelcome attention from Charlie. Once in the room we can see that the boyfriend’s flowers are not there, and so this part was, perhaps, shot before Chaplin’s character was fully integrated into the film. We then get more of Charlie in the lobby, and when the camera turns to Mabel’s room, lo and behold, the flowers have now mysteriously appeared. This suggests that the later shenanigans in Mabel’s room were linked to Charlie’s activities in the lobby, and his\n\nstealing of a flower from her boyfriend (which he gave to the seated woman). In other words, Charlie became the lynch-pin that now linked the scenes, and he had, more or less, taken over the picture. In the second half of the picture, we see the hilarious goings on when Mabel gets accidentally locked out of her room in her pajamas. However, it is possible that the scene where Mabel hides under a bed in another room, with her dog, and was discovered by her boyfriend (as per the synopsis), was also filmed before Chaplin’s had a key role in the film. Chaplin’s scene of entering the room, after chasing Mabel around the hotel, were dovetailed into the old scheme.\n\nPathe Lehrman later stated that the film was shot in a single day, a remarkable achievement, especially if it was shot the same day (10th Jan.) as Kid Auto Races (actually released before Mabel’s Strange Predicament). [Endnote 2].\n\nIt will be noticed that Mabel puts in a sterling performance in the chase scenes with Chaplin, resulting, perhaps, from the realization that the tramp could be the ‘coming man’ and she needed to be more forceful. Following this film, it seems that Mabel refused to work with Chaplin. Sennett, in his autobiography, stated that Mabel said she did not, any longer, think his performance so good. In reality she perhaps thought Chaplin too good!\n\nMabel At The Wheel\n\nThis film was shot two-and-a half months after Mabel’s Strange Predicament. Mabel was, no doubt, still upset about what Chaplin had been allowed to do in the first film, and had resisted any attempt to team her with the tramp. We can well imagine that Mabel insisted on being the director, if Chaplin ever appeared alongside her again. This way she could control his exposure in the film, which was intended, after all, to showcase her talents alone. Trouble subsequently arose during shooting for Mabel At The Wheel, when Chaplin tried to introduce gags, as he had in Mabel’s Strange Predicament. Mabel refused to countenance them, and Charlie blew up. Shooting was stopped early, and Sennett threatened to fire Chaplin. Of course, it was impossible to fire Chaplin at this point, as he had already received much public acclaim. The situation was apparently smoothed over, and Chaplin was allowed to make suggestions, on the understanding, perhaps, that he was not to wear the tramp costume. The lack of the tramp outfit would have diminished Chaplin’s persona in the film, although he was probably still identifiable to his growing hoard of fans.\n\nWhat was this film all about? Basically, it is all about an ordinary girl, who is able to jump straight into a racing car, then race, and win, on a hard-packed dirt road. The news papers then were full of daring deeds carried out by women such as Harriett Quimby, who was the first woman to achieve great things in an aircraft. Not only did product manufacturers jump on the bandwagon, and sponsor such women’s deeds, but film companies were also keen to have their own adventurous females in movies (The Perils of Pauline was one such series of films). Mabel had previously shot a pistol from an aircraft, and climbed 300 feet down from a tethered balloon (wearing a swimsuit, of course). Her exploits on high diving boards were well known. Of course, in the film, Mabel wins the race after crashing once, and an amusing moment occurs when she powders her face, before getting in the car (much to the annoyance of the team). Mabel is seen driving the car down the straight sections, but it is far from clear who was driving when the car is spinning and sliding on the oiled surface of the corners. In all probability a professional driver was used, perhaps Teddy Tetzlaff (Mabel’s flame in Speed Kings) or Earl Cooper.\n\nChaplin’s role in the film is as a villain, somewhat similar to that played by Ford Sterling. As stated above this reduced Chaplin’s character, and we might imagine that Chaplin insisted on riding a motorcycle, so that he is not totally eclipsed by the Keystone Girl. Unfortunately, as Mabel later related, Chaplin had never actually ridden a two-wheeled machine. He told everyone that, as he’d ridden a bicycle, he could handle a motorcycle. The result was the obvious one – when he charged off with Mabel on the makeshift passenger seat, he soon lost control of the cycle, and, as Mabel later explained, the machine ended up in a ditch and their own mortal remains were scattered along the road.\n\nThe film was made in the time honored way, by using the public highway, and a race track. The race track was, in fact, a temporarily closed stretch of public road in Santa Monica, and the basis of the picture was a Keystone film made of the race. Some of the picture was made on the track after the race, and other scenes were shot on a set. The scene that caused most problems between Mabel and Charlie, was the one where Charlie uses a hose to water the race-track, ostensibly to cause Mabel to crash her car. Undoubtedly, this scene was filmed, not during the actual race, but, perhaps, soon after. We might think that, as this was a public road, Keystone’s actions were illegal, and dangerous. However, the authorities were happy for the race organizers to damp down their dirt roads with water and kerosene, as this helped compact the road, and allay the dust. However the amount of water Chaplin uses is excessive.\n\nSummarizing the films\n\nBoth of these films were intended to showcase Mabel’s talents, but, in Mabel’s Strange Predicament, along comes Chaplin, who would have completely dominated the picture, if Mabel had not made strenuous efforts to impose her character on the film. The results of the contest were, consequently, a draw, and a very fine picture was produced. What is a little annoying is that this was later dubbed a ‘Chaplin picture’, even though the title did not include his name. It appears that Mabel refused to work with Chaplin following this film, although we might suspect that Pathe Lehrman was whispering poison into Mabel’s ear concerning Chaplin’s evil intentions. Why did Mabel allow Chaplin to carry on the opening scene for so long without her? The answer is, probably, that Mabel was unaware of the extended scene, the bulk of which could have been filmed while she was elsewhere on the lot. Almost certainly, she never saw the rushes of the scene.\n\nThe reason why the pair were brought together for Mabel’s flagship Mabel At the Wheel film, might lie with Keystone bosses Kessell and Baumann, who would certainly have considered them a ‘dream team’. Sennett, who disliked Chaplin, probably agreed with Mabel that the tramp should be kept out. However, they had to include Chaplin, but made sure he was not immediately recognizable, by ensuring he did not appear in the tramp costume. Furthermore, the designation of Mabel as director would make it doubly certain that Chaplin could not take command of the picture. Job done – only it wasn’t. World War 1 broke out early, and things got heated. Fortunately, it all got smoothed out, and plenty of Charlie and Mabel films followed. More importantly, the pair had long discussions about the direction screen comedy was going, and the result was films like Mickey and The Gold Rush. The smoothing out might well have resulted from Big Boss-Man Charles Baumann having his daughter, Ada, installed on the set of At The Wheel, as a one-off extra. If so, she almost certainly telegraphed the goings on back to ‘dad’.\n\nEndnote 1: The fact that Mabel’s dog suddenly disappears (for good), as the boyfriend pulls Mabel out from under his friends bed, does not seem to relate to any rescheduling of scenes, and may simply be the typical Keystone discontinuity seen in so many of the studio’s films.\n\nEndnote 2: Pathe Lehrmann later stated that he directed all of Chaplin’s non-Mabel scenes in Strange Predicament, while Sennett directed all of Mabel’s non-Chaplin scenes. If this is true, then it explains why the discontinuities occurred, and how Mabel was manipulated out of most of the opening scene, and some of the other scenes.\n\nBibliography\n\nKEYSTONE: The Life and Clowns of Mack Sennett (2003).\n\nMack Sennett’s Private Papers held by Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.\n\nCharles Chaplin: My Autobiography (1964).\n\nMabel Normand’s Own Life Story by Chandler Sprague (Los Angeles Examiner February 17, 1924)."
