        "text": "Jim Carrey fans might want to get their tickets now for “Sonic the Hedgehog 2,” as it could be the last acting role of the iconic comedian’s career. Speaking to “Access Hollywood” this week, Carrey said he is planning to retire from acting following his reprisal of the villainous Robotnik in the upcoming “Sonic” sequel. How serious is Carrey about leaving acting behind? “Fairly serious,” he said.\n\n“Well, I’m retiring. Yeah, probably. I’m being fairly serious,” Carrey said. “It depends. If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road, but I’m taking a break.”\n\nCarrey added, “I really like my quiet life and I really like putting paint on canvas and I really love my spiritual life and I feel like — and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say as long as time exists — I have enough. I’ve done enough. I am enough.”\n\nFans of Carrey are used to the actor taking extended acting breaks. The release of “Sonic the Hedgehog” in 2020 marked Carrey’s first major role in a studio movie since the 2014 sequel “Dumb and Dumber To.” In between, the actor appeared in the indie films “The Bad Batch” and “Dark Crimes.” Carrey’s recent roles also include Showtime’s comedy series “Kidding,” which ran for 20 episodes across two seasons before being canceled. The comedian also guested on “Saturday Night Live” as Joe Biden for six episodes in 2020.\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nWith the release of “Sonic the Hedgehog 2,” Carrey returns to the franchise opposite Ben Schwartz, Tika Sumpter, James Marsden and Natasha Rothwell. The first “Sonic” movie opened right before the pandemic in February 2020 and grossed just under $320 million worldwide. The sequel adds the voice of Idris Elba to the mix as Knuckles, a character that will be getting a spinoff series at Paramount Plus in the future.\n\nWatch Carrey’s full interview with “Access Hollywood” in the video below."
