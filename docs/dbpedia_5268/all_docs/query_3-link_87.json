        "text": "I wanted to ask first about your obvious passion for photography, how did that all start, as you’ve put together a photo series called ALSAMO comprising of shots taken when you were in your early teens. Have you always carried a camera with you to document life around you?\n\nAround the age of 12, I was gifted my first 35mm film camera from a good friend and legendary cinematographer/photographer John Simmons, ASC. He inspired me to start taking photos of what caught my eye and introduced me to the art of street photography.\n\nWhat inspires you most to pick up a camera and shoot?\n\nA gut feeling, the unknown.\n\nMaybe a cinematographer is next on your to-do list?\n\nIf you are asking what filmmakers I want to work with, it would be a Gaspar Noé, Safdie Brothers, Daniels, or a David Lynch project. But if you are asking if BEING a cinematographer is on my to-do list, when I was 16, I made a short film (Gibson), that I shot, wrote, and edited myself. When I was 14, my talented friends Mishka Kornai and Zack Wechter, also cast me as the lead in their coming-of-age movie Pocket, where I was not only the actor but by way of the story, was also the cameraman.\n\nYou write poetry too, and I love the fact you do it on an old-fashioned typewriter. You come across like an old soul Mace! What drives those passions?\n\nWhat drives me to make art and try out different avenues of self-expression is just a gut feeling.\n\nSpeaking of gut feelings, you started your acting career at just 7 years old. What made you want to chase your dreams at such a young age – were there films you saw as a kid that made you want to do this?\n\nI loved improvisation and intuitively creating and expressing myself as a kid. I was inspired by life and the different ways to express myself.\n\nIs there something you haven’t done yet as an actor that you really want to do?\n\nThe best is yet to come, I really enjoy film, and trust I will work with more independent experimental filmmakers with raw movie ideas in the future.\n\nYour true love is really an Indie film. What kind of stuff do you find yourself looking for? Is it escapist stuff, or movies where you’re feeling feelings\n\nI am drawn to authentic-surreal storytelling and would love to portray a complex or eccentric character.\n\n“I loved improvisation and intuitively creating and expressing myself as a kid. I was inspired by life and the different ways to express myself.”\n\nAside from the short film Gibson you created, are there any other stories you’re really keen to take to the big screen, or other creative outlets you would like to try?\n\nMy journey as an artist has only just begun, I have dreams that exceed a big screen.\n\nWhat about combining acting with your love of music too? Would you ever make playlists to help you get into character for a role?\n\nI really keep an open ear and have an appreciation for all types of music. However, I will always appreciate the genius of pianists and thinkers such as Ahmad Jamal, Thelonious, and Bill Evans. What helps me get into character for a role is purely just studying or creating the psychology of a character's mind and personal truth, not really music. For me, acting is being. Although, if the characters' taste in music was a huge determining factor in personality, I would definitely use music to get into the role.\n\nLet’s discuss your latest project, That ‘90s show.
