        "text": "CHAPTER ONE.\n\nBROOKLYN ROAD PICTURE THEATRE.\n\nResearched and written by Charlie Grimble.\n\nThomas Funnell, (b.28/3/1868 Hellingly, d.4/3/1955, Green Woodpecker, Kammond\n\nAvenue, Seaford) wife Ellen Georgina Funnell (nee Hance),born 2 May 1871 at Hill Head, west of Gosport, Hampshire, died 4 April 1957 Taunton, Somerset.\n\nThomas was a builder and carpenter who moved into a Lodging House, Gosport House, 14, The Esplanade, Seaford in 1901 and remained in Seaford for the rest of his life.\n\nHe bought the land at 48 Brooklyn Road, on 10 April 1905. He built a workshop in 1908 probably in anticipation of a sale to Seaford Gas Company who, on 23 November 1906 had sought approval from the Board of Trade (published in the London Gazette on that date) to acquire land surrounding the Gasworks site (including Thomas Funnell’s land).\n\nHowever, although the gasworks were extended at that time, it was not necessary to purchase No 48 Brooklyn Road. Thomas Funnell therefore had to find some interim use for his building and so he changed it in late 1909 to a roller skating rink, and occasionally films were shown there.\n\nIt was lit by gas, as electricity had not come to Seaford at that time. Roller Skating rinks on a commercial basis first appeared in the UK in 1857 with one in The Strand, and also in the Floral Hall, London, swiftly followed by 48 more by the 1870’s, using the recently new design of the quad skate (previous types were in-line skates), It died down again but briefly re-erupted in in 1909 when 38 companies registered in the UK.\n\nOn 12 May 1911 in the name of his wife Ellen Georgina Funnell, Thomas Funnell bought from the Seaford West Company, the adjacent plot now occupied by the building used by Swindells, probably to make the whole entity more attractive for onward sale to the Gas Company. The building did not last long in that form as Charles Bravery built The Empire Cinema in Sutton Road in 1913 and that cinema thrived. Pike’s Blue Book of 1910-11 calls Funnell’s building ‘a skating rink and concert hall’.\n\nThomas Funnell bought the Martello Tower in 1911 and got approval for converting it into a skating rink on 12 August 1912 (The Keep Ref DL/A/34/372). In the works to adapt the building for commercial purposes, he included a skating rink and tea rooms. Pike’s Blue Book of 1912-13 has the Electric Picture Theatre adjacent to 44 Brooklyn Road. This description has disappeared by the time the 1915-16 Pike’s Blue Book was compiled.\n\nOn 22nd February 1913 Mr. Charles J. Bravery, Mr. H. Ediss and Mr. F. Ediss, with a capital of £3,000 in £1 shares, registered a company for the purpose of erecting an ‘electric or cinematograph theatre’. They called the company ‘Seaford Empire Company Limited’. The company was registered by Crawford & Barwell, solicitors, Seaford.\n\nThe number of directors of the private company was to be not less than two, and no more than three. The first directors were Bravery, Ediss and Ediss.\n\nRegardless of this within seven months Mr. C. J. Bravery was in sole charge of the company, and spent just under £2,000 having the 72ft x 32ft theatre built by local builder Mr Wilkinson, on a plot of land in Sutton Road, already owned by Mr. Bravery.\n\nCharles J. Bravery was a property owner and estate agent, whose business interests were supervised by his son, C. Victor Bravery, of Blatchington Estates, Station Road, Seaford. The Braverys did not operate the Empire themselves, but leased the cinema out.\n\nThe Empire was a 500 seater cinema, completed in 1913. Sutton Road at the time was residential. Houses had been built on both sides of the road, all with small gardens leading to the front door of the building. To build the Empire in keeping with the houses, the steps leading to the entrance of the cinema took up the the depth of the gardens, which allowed the front of the cinema to be built near enough in line with the houses.\n\nOn entering the front foyer of the Empire, the kiosk was right in the middle. There were two swing doors leading to the inner foyer, which had a large radiator. On winter evenings many of the staff would gather around this radiator for extra warmth.\n\nFurther in there were another two swing doors leading you to the auditorium. The auditorium was very well furnished. The balcony was decorated in plaster motif’s and the ceiling lights were of a dome shape.\n\nBy all accounts the Empire was a very popular cinema with Seaford folk, especially the courting couples, as it had an atmosphere about it that many people liked.\n\nLiving in London at that time were Mr and Mrs. Lloyd Langdon. Mr. Langdon was general manager of Sir Oswald Stall’s theatres. He had supervised the change of the Stoll Theatre in Kingsway, London to the Stoll Picture Theatre. Suffering from asthma, he was advised by his doctor to move to the South Coast.\n\nIn 1931 he and Mrs. Langdon moved to Seaford and decided to go into the cinema business, purchasing the lease of the Empire from Oscar Deutsch.\n\nThis suited both parties. Oscar Deautsch would no longer be committed to running the Empire, giving him more time with his venture of acquiring land in suitable towns for building Odeon cinemas for local businessmen.\n\nWhether or not it was during the time Deutsch operated out of Seaford that he examined the possible trading position for new theatres in other South Coast towns is open to conjecture. Certainly the early Odeon circuit was strongly represented in the south with new cinemas at Bognor, Kemptown, Lancing, Lewes, Littlehampton, Portslade (the Rothbury), and Worthing\n\nAs for the Langdon’s, they were back in the business of managing a local cinema, which they had been so successful in London.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Langdon passed away within three months of their move to Seaford, and therefore Mrs. Isobel Merriman Langdon became the sole leaseholder.\n\nSoon after, while Deutsch early Odeons were under construction at Lancing, Portslade and Worthing, a hoarding was erected on the site of what was to become the Ritz, saying that a new Odeon theatre would shortly be built there. This caused great alarm to Victor Bravery, who could see that the viability of his Empire Cinema would be affected, and also to Mrs. Langdon.\n\nAt a meeting between Mr. Bravery and Mrs. Langdon, it was suggested that she should see Oscar Deutsch to discuss the matter. Victor Bravery promised that if Mrs. Langdon could persuade Deutsch not to proceed with his Odeon Seaford scheme, he would purchase the site and build a brand new cinema for her to lease.\n\nAt that time the site of the new Ritz was some way from the commercial centre of the town, and had been in recent years the town’s pound where any stray cattle were herded. It was strange that the Braverys had overlooked this plot of land in the town, for they were opportunists who bought and sold building plots all over Seaford, but they probably dismissed the Ritz site as of no retail value.\n\nMrs. Langdon did visit Oscar Deutsch in London, and pointed out that it was hardly fair trading, in her opinion, to sell the lease of one cinema, the Empire, to her late husband and herself, and then build a brand new cinema in direct opposition! Surprisingly Deutsch agreed, and explained that with his programme of new Odeons gathering momentum, his agents were exercising options on sites all over the country, and that he had overlooked the position at Seaford. Under the circumstances he was quite prepared not to proceed with the proposed Odeon at Seaford.\n\nTrue to his word Mr. Deutsch took down the hording regarding the possible opening of an Odeon cinema for Seaford. Mr. Bravery, in turn, purchased the plot of land and put plans in place for the building a new cinema in Seaford.\n\nThe Empire continued entertaining Seafordians even after the Ritz was completed, both cinema’s being managed by Mrs. Langdon and her daughter. It was debatable whether a small town like Seaford could accommodate two cinemas, but that debate ended one fateful night in 1939, when the Empire caught fire and a local fireman lost his life.\n\nTHE EMPIRE CATCHES FIRE\n\nOn Tuesday evening, February 28th 1939 there were two feature films showing at the Empire– The Port of Seven Seas, starring Wallace Beery and Walking Down Broadway.\n\nAfter the second film the customers left, and the main electric switch near the front doors was turned off, the premises locked, and the staff went home.\n\nOne of the usherettes employed at the Empire, Miss Joan Coffen walked the short distance to her home in 9, Croft Lane.\n\nAt 1am. on the Wednesday morning, Joan’s mother, Mrs. Coffen looked out of her bedroom window and saw what she described as a flicker of light inside the lavatory window of the cinema It was almost like a piece of paper flickering to and fro, she said, and then, thinking that it was not worth bothering about, she returned to bed. Mrs. Coffen did not enjoy very good health, and three-quarters of an hour later she got up and looked out of the window again.\n\nThis time there was no mistaking the fact that the cinema was alight for the flames were quite pronounced and were licking round the inside of the same window. She promptly called her daughter, who at once partly dressed and ran round into Sutton Park Road and rang the fire alarm, a distance of about 150 yards from her house.The call was received at 1.50am, and the Seaford Fire Brigade were on site within eight minutes.\n\nChief Officer John Henry Reeves stated: “Directly we arrived we could see that the outbreak had started in the vicinity of the boiler room behind the stage and the flames had already got a good hold. They had already reached the roof at the rear of the building, and we were hampered by the fact that a very strong wind was blowing straight from the sea and therefore fanning the flames towards the centre of the building. In as short a time as possible we connected up fifteen 50-ft. lengths of hose and started to play water on the building and on the properties on its left and right.\n\nWe could see when the flames got such a hold that the interior of the building became a raging furnace, that the only thing to do to save the outer walls from falling was to play water on to the steel girders which ran from one side of the cinema.\n\nAt 2.30am Chief Officer Reeves soon realised that the assistance of the Newhaven brigade was needed and they in turn arrived shortly afterwards. Under Chief Officer Knight, they arrived in a very short time and, like the Seaford Brigade, set about their task in a workmanlike manner. They ran out another five 50-ft lengths of hose from hydrants and soon cascades of water were concentrated on the flames from all directions.\n\nTHE ACCIDENT.\n\nThe fire escape ladder was first erected and placed sideways to the front of the burning building. At that time it was about 40-ft. high and the two side props were put in position. Fireman Stanley Brown of 39, Stafford Road, heard the Chief Officer ask for volunteers to help, and four men, including Mr. Desmond White of the Belmont Café, came forward, and they stood at the foot of the escape to try and prevent the swaying.\n\nMr. Fred Mace an experienced volunteer fireman of 20 years was to climb the ladder and hose the flames from the top. Mr. Brown followed Mr. Mace up the ladder, and assisted to secure the hose. The wind was so strong it was hard for Mr. Brown to hold on to the escape ladder, and the pressure of the wind at the top, where Mr. Mace was hosing the flames, would have been enormous, but Mr. Brown’s duty was over. As soon as he was satisfied that the hose was secure and safe, Mr. Brown decended.\n\nA little time afterwards the position of the escape was changed slightly and the four men continued to try and steady the bottom. At around 3.30am the escape ladder seemed to get sideways to the wind. The four men were not as strong as the wind, and with Mr. Mace at the top of the ladder, the escape crashed to the ground. Mr. Fred Mace was taken to Brighton Hospital where he unfortunately died from his injuries.\n\nGENERAL DESIGN\n\nThe Ritz was promoted by the Seaford Empire Company of which Victor Bravery was merely a director, handling the business side of the affairs for his father, Charles J. Bravery. As far as can be seen, plans for the Odeon Seaford were not sufficiently advanced for any drawings to have been made, therefore the Ritz bore no resemblance to an Odeon.\n\nHow it was that architect Major W. J. King of 16/17 Jermyn Street, London SW1,came to design the Ritz at Seaford is a mystery. W. J. King specialised in acquiring sites, building cinemas on them designed by himself, and then leasing them off to one of the major circuits as they were completed. Seaford was most certainly not a piece of speculative building. Most other W. J. King cinemas were built in Middlesex and a curious spin off from this was evident at Seaford. Licensing authorities in Middlesex insisted the words “Way Out ” be used while every other authority stipulated “Exit”. At Seaford all the exits follow the Middlesex pattern of “Way Out”\n\nThe builders were Leighton (Contractors) Ltd., 62 Oxford Street, London, but some of the work was sub-contracted to local Seaford companies. The Ritz was designed on modern lines. For the comfort of those to whom stairs are a burden, it was contrived to make the circle within nine steps of the ground level.\n\nThe auditorium provided potential accommodation for 1000 patrons — 700 in the stalls and 300 in the circle. However, the original seating capacity was never more than 860, as Mrs. Langdon and Mr. Bravery insisted on wide spacing between rows.\n\nThe tasteful decoration was in Dubarry rose with pleasantly contrasted furnishings in eau-de-nil.\n\nTHE AUDITORIUM\n\nThe auditorium was wide, long, spacious and airy, although the ceiling was not all that high. In common with many other of Major King’s cinemas, the proscenium arch was shaped in a distinctive way. Instead of it being straight, or even curved across, at the top, the width was divided into three, and the two side segments sloped downwards. The suspended ceiling of the theatre followed this pattern. Although the centre of the ceiling was high, by the time it reached the side walls the height had been considerably reduced. This helped to make the cinema more intimate, and reduced the heating bills in the winter!\n\nThe auditorium was 133ft wide at the maximum point, and this tapered somewhat severely to 45ft at the proscenium opening.\n\nThe splay walls on either side held both the ventilation ducts and four recessed sections that were part of the lighting scheme. These were lit by concealed bulbs. Overhead were six large chandeliers of modern design, sympathetic to the atmosphere of the rest of the building.\n\nSeating in both stalls and circle was in three blocks with two gangways. The seats were in rows of different colours. One row was rose pink, and the next eau-de-nil green. Decoration on the walls downstairs was quite plain, but in the circle the motif of the sea was continued, with silver and green wave tips. This looked quite attractive.\n\nTHE STAGE\n\nThe stage was 36ft deep. In pre-CinemaScope days there were two sets of electrically operated tabs. The main house tabs were plain satin with a shiny band at the bottom that roughly followed the design of the proscenium arch. Behind were several sets of legs of peach colour, with festoon borders. The screen tabs were a rigid edge, side opening festoon.*\n\nThe screen was on a frame away from the rear wall, and the black serge masking had square corners. The Ritz never had the rounded corners so popular in cinemas of the mid-Thirties. Effective stage lighting was provided by two battens and by floats. The number one batten was just behind the main tabs, and number two was in front of the festoons. The footlights were slightly lower than the stage floor and there was a gap between the edge of the stage and the lights. Later on this gap was boarded over with the result that a shadow was cast on the lower part of the festoon curtain and the pleasing effect on the curtain lit from top and bottom in contrasting colours was never fully realised.\n\nThe single horn speaker of the B.T.H. sound was in the space between the screen and rear wall. To help with the acoustics, W.J. King specified a plaster finish to the auditorium that was rather like pebble-dash and he would not agree that acoustic tiles were necessary. There were criticisms of the sound at Seaford, but history has judged that B.T.H. was not the best sound system.\n\n*Rigid edge means that the leading edge of each curtain was fixed top and bottom to the hauling cable which, besides passing through the curtain track, also by means of pulleys passed along the stage at the foot of the curtains. Unless side opening festoons were fixed top and bottom, the sheer weight of the material in the festoon made the curtain taper. Rigid-edged festoon curtains were expensive to install and more prone to go wrong, and this is the reason why some interior designers specified a side opening festoon that had a panel of non-festooned material on the leading edge. This did not require the extra cable and pulley work.\n\nCHANGES IN MANAGEMENT\n\nFor the major part of its lifetime, the policy of the Ritz was in the hands of Mrs Langdon and her daughter. Mrs. Langdon had retained a pleasant business relationship with Oscar Deutsch, and she took over the Odeon Lancing during the war as well as the Deutsch-managed Rothbury at Portslade from the builders, Mr. and Mrs. Middleton, who had got into a hopeless muddle when Oscar Deutsch withdrew.\n\nIn 1958 she took over the Abbey Cinema at Battle.\n\nAt Seaford her admission prices were always high. Whereas in other cinemas the stalls were priced at 1/- and 1/9, Mrs. Langdon’s prices were 1/-. 1/9 and 2/6. The circle was 2/9 and 3/6. During weekdays the theatre opened at 5 o’clock, on Sundays at 8pm. The Wednesday and Saturday matinees, at 2.30 with reduced prices, were popular with the retired patrons, and continued until June Howard resigned.\n\nMrs. Langdon was very careful about the product she booked as she catered for what was called the carriage trade. Newhaven was only four miles distant, and for most of the time both towns crossbarred each other.\n\nNewhaven had first run on all Paramount and Warner product, but Seaford had the rest.\n\nVery occasionally 20th Century-Fox films played concurrently. On average, rental for films was 40%.\n\nGaumont-British News was shown when the cinema opened in 1936 and this continued until 1947 when the reel was changed to Movietone and then British Paramount News. Projection standards were excellent. Fade-ins on the Censors’ certificates, where printed on the film, were always screened and the films were shown in their entirety, right to the end of the cast. They were never ‘slipped’ even at the last performance. Changeovers were uniformly good, with no dialogue clipped.\n\nFor a medium-sized South Coast town, the Ritz was an ambitious project. The Empire had burnt down in 1939 and was never restored, so the Ritz served the town on its own for forty years.\n\nWhen Mrs. Langdon died in 1961 her lease died with her, and no other lease on the cinema was ever issued. Victor Bravery died two years after Mrs. Langdon, and Mrs. Langdon’s daughter, Mrs. June Howard, was invited to run the cinema as an employee of the Seaford Empire company.\n\nThe Ritz closed in June 1970, mainly because it was in such a dreadful condition. There was no proper heating, the seats were in need of repair, and it was dirty. Mrs. Howard reports: “It was just not worth running. The audiences were so small and no wonder! I wouldn’t have paid to go there. No money had been spent on the place almost since it was built.”\n\nThe staff, most of which had been there since wartime days, including the projectionist, Percy Brunsdon, who had come from the old Empire, resigned en bloc.\n\nThe Ritz would have remained shut had the Seaford Empire company not discovered that no insurance could be obtained unless the place was occupied. Hence there was a desperate search for a tenant.\n\nThe Ritz was re-opened on July 1st by Roy Markwick of Uckfield Picture House, who traded under the name of Hallmark Cinemas. Mr. Markwick was charged a rent of £900 per annum, and he was responsible for all insurances. By this time, business had declined to such an extent that the Seaford Empire company had applied to the Old Seaford Urban District Council for planning permission to redevelop the entire Ritz site into shops and flats. But in 1970 the bottom had fallen out of the property market and, although planning permission was granted, there was no money to finance the redevelopment.\n\nRoy Markwick replaced the original B.T.H. sound with R.C.A. resprayed the screen and fitted Peerless Arcs. Later he threw the old Kalee projectors into the rectifier room and installed some second-hand Westars.\n\nThe introduction of Value Added Tax brought about Mr. Markwick’s departure from Seaford. He wrote to the Seaford Empire company giving notice that he would vacate the Ritz on 30th April 1974. The people of Seaford just did not care about their cinema, he said. They would not attend whatever film he put on.\n\nIn August 1974, the late Myles Byrne agreed to re-open the cinema, so long as he could have it for no rent at all. As Roy Markwick had removed projectors and sound system to his planned twin at Uckfield, Myles Byrne had to start from scratch.\n\nHe acquired some ex-government Kalee 11 machines that were brand new, found some Nevillectric rectifiers, installed another set of RCA sound equipment, and opened up for business.\n\nWith the threat of possible redevelopment hanging over his head, or even whether he would be able to make the cinema pay, Myles Byrne did not redecorate either, apart from a quick colour wash to the main entrance.\n\nIn the original leasing agreement between Mr. Bravery and Mrs. Langdon, the lessee was responsible for the day-to-day running expenses of the theatre, but all the inside fixtures, furniture, equipment and decorations were the responsibility of the landlord.\n\nThe lease was a decoration and repair lease. Victor Bravery knew very well that\n\nall decorations were his company’s responsibility, but it was like getting blood out of a stone to get him to do anything that would cost money. Rent for the cinema was fixed at 25% of the gross takings.\n\nOn the day that demolition commenced at Seaford, in March 1985, the Ritz was still painted in its original colours, in fact in its original paint! The Ritz Seaford must have been the only cinema that had never been redecorated in all its forty-nine years of operation. True, when it changed managements in the Seventies, the foyer was tickled up, and the outside was repainted after the war because of bomb damage to a building opposite.\n\nA new Safeway store was opened at the end of July 1986 on the site of the old Ritz. This supermarket covers the entire area of the former cinema, shops and car park, and it is a reminder of the vast and ambitious project that the building of the Ritz complex was in its day.\n\n(Mrs. Howard comments):\n\n“The Ritz should never have been built. It was too large for the town, and Seaford was certainly not big enough to support two cinemas as it tried to do when both the Empire and the Ritz were in operation. If we had had the Empire, we should probably still be running it today.\n\nHad not the sign for a new Odeon been erected, the Ritz would have not been built. It was a barn of a place, and very difficult to heat. There were no radiators in the auditorium. The heating consisted of hot air being blown through the grilles on either side of the proscenium. The cinema never did really well, even when it first opened, and although it was full during the war, the takings were well down as troops could always get in for 6d.(2 ½ p).”\n\n(Seaford Times comment)\n\nHad Mr. Bravery, a very wealthy man, obeyed the terms of the lease, a lease that he had agreed to with Mr. & Mrs. Langdon back in 1936, the Ritz might still be in use today in one form or another."
