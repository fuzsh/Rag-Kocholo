        "text": "Lester D. Friedman’s second, newly updated edition of his encyclopedic study of Steven Spielberg, ‘Citizen Spielberg’ (University of Illinois Press, Paper $24.95) includes material on the current Best Picture and Best Director Oscar-nominated ‘West Side Story’ and the maestro’s November release, the fictionalized autobiographical ‘The Fabelmans.’ Friedman, an emeritus professor and former Media and Society chair at Hobart and William Smith Colleges, explained in a phone interview that he has no idea how the multi-faceted filmmaker and Hollywood deity continues his relentless pace. ‘Spielberg has always in his career tried to balance the popcorn movies and the prestige movies. And he does it again and again. At night,’ Friedman said, ‘he was editing “Jurassic Park” and during the day shooting “Schindler’s List.” It just shows how he can compartmentalize which other mortals cannot.’\n\nQ: Why does Steven Spielberg continue to have this hold on audiences 50 years and counting?\n\nLESTER D. FRIEDMAN: One of the projects of the book was to evaluate if Steven Spielberg is anything more than a Barnum & Bailey entertainer who makes people jump out of their seats. Spielberg uses genres — all of his films are in genre — but he manages to infuse genre with nostalgia and expectation and also by adding something new. What he does so well – and his imitators do so badly – he makes you care about conventional characters, whether a brown alien, 3 guys who don’t like each other on a boat or Abraham Lincoln.\n\nQ: You’ve done studies on Clint Eastwood, Arthur Penn’s ‘Bonnie and Clyde’ and the Frankenstein narratives. Why Spielberg?\n\nLDF: I didn’t start this as a Spielberg fan but my students asked, ‘Can you do a class on Spielberg? And I discovered there was only Joe McBride’s scholarly book [1997’s ‘Steven Spielberg: A Biography’]. I thought, ‘This is crazy. The most successful director in American cinema and there’s no book on this?’ The more I looked the more I got into it. All my friends thought it was bad idea to do ‘Citizen Spielberg.’ One colleague said, ‘He’s the cinema antichrist.’ Another said, ‘This is academic pornography. You’ll never be taken as a legitimate scholar again.’ But I’ve been very gratified to see others have taken up the cause as well. How many books are there on [Fred] Zinnemann? [Michael] Curtiz – he directed ‘Casablanca’! One of my friends says you have to die before you’re recognized.\n\nQ: Despite critical acclaim, Spielberg’s ‘West Side Story’ was dead on box-office arrival, a spectacular flop for a movie that cost $100 million. What do you think happened?\n\nMF: I saw it the night it opened in a theater. I loved it. Of course it’s hooked up with the demographics of the audience. As Spielberg gets older, his audience gets older. A lot of people who were older were not going to the movies (even though he kept it back a year). And people thought, Why would you do such a thing? It’s a classic twice – first on Broadway, then the Robert Wise movie. The whole thing Spielberg does with the movie, he gives it a depth. Like the Jets’ song ends on a pile of garbage. That it’s being shot where they’re building Lincoln Center. That is a different version than what Robert Wise gave us. To shoot ‘America’ [a kinetic dance number] in the traffic in the street, to have Rita Moreno [of the original film] singing ‘Somewhere’ — I teared up at the end for goodness’s sake. In terms of the Oscars I don’t think it will win. But if it did, I have to search my Jeopardy memory, I don’t think a remake of a movie has ever won. [Actually, there are many remakes who are Best Picture Oscar winners: most famously Wyler’s ‘Ben-Hur,’ Scorsese’s ‘The Departed,’ Olivier’s ‘Hamlet’ and the 1955 ‘Marty’ which was originally on TV.]\n\nQ: Spielberg shows no signs of slowing down. Do you see him retiring?\n\nLF: I see him dying on the set in the director’s chair. He’s a model to me, he’s keeping — I say this in the preface to the new edition — this love/hate relationship with technology in particular. He uses technology, he has all along, but in many ways he would have been comfortable in the ‘50s working for Warner Bros.\n\nNEW DVDs:\n\nBRANAGH’S CHILDHOOD Set in Northern Ireland’s capital city during the beginning of what was called ‘The Troubles,’ Kenneth Branagh’s ‘Belfast’ (Blu-ray + Digital Code, Focus, PG-13) is primarily a memoir of his childhood. Nominated for 7 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and, for Dame Judi Dench, Best Supporting Actress, ‘Belfast,’ filmed in black-and-white, is a look back at a childhood where the majority Protestants and minority Catholics lived side by side – until an undeclared war for Irish Independence erupted against English military rule and discrimination. None of that takes much space in Branagh’s familial saga where his Protestant father (Jamie Dornan) must decide to leave the familiar city nest and emigrate to London. Bonus: Branagh’s feature commentary, deleted scenes, featurette on ‘Everyone’s Inner Child,’ a Making of and, truly special, the alternative ending featuring Branagh no one has ever seen.\n\nCHASTAIN’S GIRL POWER The all-star feminist action movie ‘The 355’ (Blu-ray + DVE + Digital Code, Universal, PG-13) was shepherded by a determined Jessica Chastain who needed every ounce of grit to finally get this picture released after, literally, years of delays. Producer and star Chastain is a volatile CIA agent who joins forces with German agent Diane Kruger, former ally and all-important computer expert Lupita Nyong’o and Colombian psychologist Penelope Cruz. Not part of their team but involved: Bingbing Fan’s Lin Mi Sheng. (This was filmed before BingBing’s sudden disappearance from public life due a reported dispute with Chinese authorities about her tax payments.) Can girl power stop WWIII? On the case: Edgar Ramirez and Sebastian Stan. Blu-ray Bonus: Deleted scenes, analyzing the Paris chase sequence, stunts examined, the Moroccan set and VFX breakdowns.\n\nDUB MISSTEPS Two of the old Soviet Union’s ‘Golden Voices’ (DVD, Music Box Films, Not Rated), the actors who dub foreign films for local theaters, find themselves in Israel with a mid-career crisis. What do Raya and Victor do now? Comically, Raya answers an ad for a woman ‘with a pleasant voice’ and is suddenly a phone sex operator to Russian ex-pats. Victor too finds his way beyond the legal highway when he becomes involved with underground video pirates who hire him to provide the voice for black-market VHS movies. Bonus: Writer-director Evgeny Ruman and writer/cinematographer Ziv Berkovich’s audio commentary, deleted scenes.\n\nRUSSIAN WWII GLORY What with Putin’s Ukrainian war of aggression, maybe now is not the ideal time for ‘The Pilot’ (Blu-ray, Well Go, Not Rated), a 2021 Russian film glorifying the courage and determination of WWII Russian fighter pilots. Specifically, one Nikolai Komlev whose plane was downed by German Nazis who then pursued him on the ground. As he fled thru woods in icy winter, the Nazis weren’t quite as fearsome as the packs of bloodthirsty wolves that weren’t deterred by fire. Filmed in collaboration with Russia’s Ministry of Culture, ‘Pilot’ vividly tells its reality-based story with CGI and old-fashioned flashbacks to the woman Nikolai loves. When he’s rescued from near death and wakes in a hospital he discovers his feet have been amputated. Still, he goes on. A true story.\n\nNOT THE EXORCIST Now in a brand new 4K restoration, ‘AntiChrist’ (Blu-ray, KL Studio Classics, Not Rated) is the 1974 Italian ‘Exorcist’ wannabe. Carla Gravina gets the acting honors as the paralyzed beauty – traumatized by the childhood accident that crippled her – who undergoes hypnosis. Could that be called a good idea when she is suddenly plagued by past-life visions where she’s not just a heretic but a passionate pervert eager to defile Satan himself!? Will, the film wonders, the Devil be exorcised for all time? Or is the door now open for the birth of the AntiChrist!! Aptly described as ‘a puke-spewing classic,’ ‘The AntiChrist’ was also known as ‘The Tempter.’ Special Features: A short film with composer Ennio Morricone, an audio commentary, ‘The Tempter’ opening credit sequence. In Italian or English.\n\nFATAL ATTRACTION 2? Is ‘Shattered’ (Blu-ray + Digital, Lionsgate, R) a nightmare meant simply for thrills? Or is it, like ‘Fatal Attraction’ to which it’s been compared, a piece of social examination? Directed by Spain’s Luis Prieto and scripted by David Loughery, ‘Shattered’ lets its tech millionaire (Cameron Monaghan) meet the femme fatale of all femme fatales Sky (Lily Krug) in the grocery store. Before he can say (or maybe scream to the heavens), What happened! when he’s injured and Sky wants to play nurse. Does that mean someone might never recover? After all, Sky’s roommate died under, shall we say, mysterious circumstances. With John Malkovich and Frank Grillo.\n\nMAFIOSO DEFINED Needless to say, with ‘Gomorrah: Fourth Season’ (Blu-ray, 12 episodes, 4 discs, Kino Lorber, Not Rated) the killing continues. As does the rivalry. We’ve seen Genny, the main gangster, go from spoiled socialite to hardened, brutal mob boss. Now he needs a life change if he’s to save his family – and himself. That means Genny must turn the keys of his kingdom over to Patrizia, sole boss of the territory. A year later, out of the crime business and into constructing a new airport, the old ways and his reputation complicate the sale of the final parcel of land Genny needs to begin construction. In its original Italian with English subtitles or an alternate, English dubbed version.\n\nA KOREAN ‘SPEED’? For a work obsessed bank manager, driving to a meeting in Busan had never ever been like this. The tension couldn’t get more explicit, the threat more dire than what rapidly unfolds in the South Korean ‘Hard Hit’ (Blu-ray, Capelight, Not Rated), a smash hit back home. That bank manager is on his regular route to work with his daughter and young son being dropped off at school when a mobile phone rings. It’s in his glovebox which is odd. Even odder, it’s a man who warns that there’s a bomb under his seat, the car is being monitored and if anyone exits, it explodes! Only if a huge ransom is paid will the bomb be deactivated. And this ain’t, he all too soon realizes, a joke!! What follows, with a nod to ‘Speed,’ is high speeds, a puzzle to be solved as to the kidnapper’s identity, and an incredible climax. Shot on Busan’s city streets, the view of the city is from inside the racing car with squads of cops on the chase. It’s a remake of ‘Retribution,’ a 2015 Spanish hit, which means we may see an English language version sometime soon. Bonus: A Making of. In Korean with optional English subtitles or in a German or English language dubbed version.\n\nBRONSON BECKONS! By 1986 Charles Bronson’s leading man status had, naturally, ebbed from its ‘’70s heyday where he was a box-office monarch. In terms of his career, ‘Murphy’s Law’ (Blu-ray, KL Studio Classics, R) was preceded by the 3rd and last ‘Death Wish’ and followed by a rare TV turn as the murdered union reformer, the coalminer candidate Joseph Yablonsky, which was a nod to his roots. ‘Murphy’ pits Bronson’s lone lawman Jack Murphy against a clever psychopath (Carrie Snodgrass) who wants revenge. Jack put her away a decade earlier. Costar Kathleen Wilhoite and film historian Nick Redman do the audio commentary. Plus, an interview with co-star Robert F. Lyons.\n\nCLASSIC REVIVED This ‘12 Angry Men’ (Blu-ray, KL Studio Classics, PG-13) is a 1997 TV version of the ‘50s hit that boasts an all-star cast that’s a model of diversity – Courtney B. Vance, Ossie Davis, Oscar winner George C. Scott, James Gandolfini, Tony Danza, Hume Cronyn, two-time Oscar winner Jack Lemmon and William Petersen. Its big plus is the Oscar-winning director William Friedkin (‘To Live and Die in LA,’ ‘The Exorcist,’ ‘The French Connection’) working on a classic courtroom drama for TV. What’s missing in the ‘diversity lineup’ is…. Women! It’s still an all-male jury slugging it out to determine if the young kid on trial will be convicted of patricide. Or not."
