        "text": "In 1948, John Mace, a sophomore voice student, was working part time in the extension division of the Juilliard School, helping to sort out schedules, when a tall, good-looking freshman walked into the office. He was Richard Prahl, and he was a bit miffed at being told to work out a kink in his courses.\n\nThen it happened. “I first looked at Richard, and my heart went pitter-pat; it’s been that way ever since,” Mr. Mace told People magazine in 2011.\n\nA relationship developed, one that endured for well over a half-century. The two men set up shop as vocal coaches to a roster of stars; lived together in New York City; raised Mr. Mace’s son, the product of a brief marriage; and in 2011 joined forces with Freedom to Marry, a group advocating changes in state laws forbidding same-sex marriages.\n\nThey became part of an online advertising campaign in support of the changes, participating in a widely circulated short video about themselves.\n\nBy then, getting married seemed like the natural thing to do.\n\n“I come from an Italian family, and they’re the marrying kind,” Mr. Mace told The Independent of London in 2011. “So why not? Why not complete this relationship, after so many years?”\n\nA year later, after the New York State Legislature had legalized same-sex marriage, they did. In August 2012, Mr. Mace married his partner, who had taken the stage name Richard Adrian Dorr, near their vacation home in upstate New York. They remained together until Mr. Dorr’s death in 2016.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
