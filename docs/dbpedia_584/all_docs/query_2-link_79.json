        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\n370 Source: Monumenta Nipponica, Vol. 41, No. 3, Autumn 1986, pp. 369–371 33 Yoshitake Oka, Five Political Leaders of Modern Japan: Itō Hirobumi, Ōkuma Shigenobu, Hara Takashi, Inukai Tsuyoshi, and Saionji Kimmochi Itō Hirobumi – a simple rustic who served coarse meals, enjoyed tippling , and fetched his own food from the kitchen? Ōkuma Shigenobu – a ‘shallow, showy, and domineering type’ who more than anything else craved grandeur and praise? Saionji Kimmochi – the kind who would decide to make a trip to Belgium simply to dally with a notorious prostitute who had murdered a Japanese diplomat? These are but three of the portraits sketched by the University of Tokyo’s venerable student of political history, Oka Yoshitake, in this chatty, human – and highly enlightening – account of five prewar prime ministers, originally published by Iwanami in 1979 under the title Kindai Nihon no Seijika. Uninterested in producing a standard biography, Oka has instead given us five ‘case studies in political leadership’ (p. vii), attempting to show each man’s character, as well as the way in which specific historical developments shaped and changed him. The result depicts Itō as a man who, while pleasure-loving and egoistical on the personal level, was impeccably honest and dedicated to the national good on the public level; Ōkuma as a lordly elitist whose reputation as a man of the people was without substance; Hara Takashi as a skillful and pragmatic realist ‘unencumbered by ideals or concern for the past or future’ (p. 109); Inukai Tsuyoshi as a highly cultured political strategist whose tactics usually failed, then unexpectedly catapulted him into the prime YOSHITAKE OKA, FIVE POLITICAL LEADERS OF MODERN JAPAN 371 minister’s chair six years after retirement, and Saionji as a genuine internationalist whose liberal leanings were undercut by his aristocratic tastes and diffident personal style. The book has its weaknesses. Oka’s recounting of institutional political developments sometimes is as dry as dust and terse beyond comprehension . The index, averaging just eighteen items for each individual, is so brief as to be barely useful. Discussions of each man’s ‘human side’ totally omit references to family relationships. And, most important, Oka’s failure to include overall analysis of ‘political leadership’ robs us of the kind of insights that only someone of his detailed knowledge and rich understanding could provide. The problems, however, are relatively minor when contrasted to the book’s contributions. The fresh light shed on important individuals should, for example, make anyone who reads Five Political Leaders a better interpreter of Japanese history. The anecdotal approach occasionally gives the book an overly gossipy tone, but at the same time it enriches our understanding of these men as complex, full-blooded human beings in a manner that is long overdue. The account of Inukai’s calm confrontation with his assassins on 15 May 1932, for example, and his attempts to reason with them even while ‘bleeding profusely from the head and temples’ (p. 173), gives a dignity to the man no number of scholarly discussions ever could. Similarly , the story of Ōkuma refusing to study calligraphy merely because a single classmate excelled him provides new (if perhaps trivial) understanding of the constitutional crisis of 1881. And Hara’s derisive retort when journalist Baba Tsunego called for a ‘political system that doesn’t need financing’ (p. 120) humanizes the ‘commoner’ prime minister’s pork-barrel brand of politics. One of the more constant themes that runs through this study in leadership is the elitism – and its concomitant disdain for the masses – of all of Japan’s prewar prime ministers. Of Itō, one journalist commented : ‘To lead the people and determine the public issues of the nation hand-in-hand with them is probably too much for such a finicky elitist’ (p. 29). Hara feared universal male suffrage, lest ‘class boundaries . . . be totally confused, and the nation itself put in jeopardy ’ (p. 116). And even the liberal-leaning Saionji warned that too much talk about ‘the masses’ would bring national progress to a halt. All but Saionji came from relatively common backgrounds, but their identification with commoners dissipated once they had achieved high status. [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-10 08:38 GMT) 372 THE RISE AND EVOLUTION OF MEIJI JAPAN Even more striking is Oka’s picture of these men as consummate politicians, energetically dedicated to both personal advancement and the success of their own political groups. The spirit of dedication is evident in Itō’s apparently serious claim that..."
