        "text": "Hara Takashi assassination\n\nOn a Friday night at a railway station in Tokyo, on November 4, 1921, a well-dressed, grey-haired man arrived to prepare to catch a train to Kyoto. As the man stepped from his chauffeur driven car, his wife urged him to take a coat, but it was a warm Autumn evening and he told her “I don’t need a coat.” He then bade her farewell. She had no idea that it was the last time she would see him alive.\n\nThe man was no ordinary Japanese citizen, he was Japanese Prime Minister Hara Takashi. Accompanied by around 20 members of his Rikken Seiyūkai party, he was on his way to a party conference in Kyoto, where decisions were to be made regarding important policies such as Japan’s military involvement in Manchuria, its policies in Korea and the country’s relations with the US.\n\nHara and several of his entourage entered the station master’s office to wait for the train, presumably to get away from the prying eyes of the public, given that he was such a well-known politician. At around 7.35pm he left the office to head toward the platform, but as he passed by the ticketing area and stopped to look at a notice board, he was approached by a young man wearing a hunting cap. The stranger produced a knife and plunged it into Hara’s chest. In the ensuing chaos people called for a doctor, and Hara was taken to the stationmaster’s office and placed on a table where people tried to revive him without success. Within 15 minutes the prime minister was dead.\n\nMembers of Hara’s entourage, and station attendants, detained the killer, pinning him to the ground. The assassin turned out to be a 19 year old railway switchman named Nakaoka Konichi, who had right wing political connections. He believed Hara was corrupt, was too friendly with the US and that he was working for a clique of business interests and working against the Japanese military. Nakaoka later said he had been acting in the best interests of the nation, but he added to the deep suspicion between the government and the military.\n\nHara had been the leader of the first true parliamentary party to govern Japan, under him the country had seemed to be moving toward a period of liberal democracy and, Hara hoped, a time of peace. While his party remained influential for another decade in the 1930s the country began a lurch to the right, toward ultranationalism, militarism and a sense that their destiny was to rule the Asia Pacific region, which would lead them to a destructive war.\n\nHara was born in 1856 in Motomiya, a small village near the city of Morioka in the north of Honshu. His family had been members of the Shizoku or samurai class of nobility and had fought against the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the movement that overthrew the dictatorship of the shogunate and reimposed the Emperor as a constitutional monarch. But Hara broke with the politics of his family, preferring not to take a noble title and following a path as a commoner.\n\nHe left home at 15 and tried to join the navy, but was rejected and he enrolled at a free school run by French Jesuits in Tokyo, learning to speak perfect French. He was also later baptised as a Catholic, under the name David. At 19 he also deliberately chose to be classified as a commoner, disowning any titles he would inherit from his family.\n\nHe studied law at the law school attached to Japan’s Ministry of Justice but left without gaining a degree and went to work as a journalist. He later quit that job in protest over being made to write propaganda for a political party. He went into the diplomatic service in 1882 and came to the attention of the influential public servant, politician and later Prime Minister Count Ito Hirobumi. Among his postings in the Foreign Service he was first secretary at Japan’s embassy in Paris.\n\nHe quit the diplomatic service in the 1890s to work at the Osaka newspaper Mainichi Shimbun, but returned to the civil service to help his mentor, Ito Hirobumi, found a new political party Rikken Seiyūkai (friends of democracy). Ito became Prime Minister for his fourth term in 1900 and Hara served as Secretary General of the Rikken Seiyukai and won a seat in parliament, appointed Minister of Communications. Ito resigned in 1901, bringing General Katsura Taro to power. Being from the military Katsura represented military interests. Under his government Japan became involved in war with the Russian Empire in 1905, over Russian interests in Manchuria and Korea. While Japan won the war, many were unhappy with the treaty that Katsura negotiated and he resigned in 1906, bring the Rikken Seiyukai back to power under Ito’s successor as leader of the party, Saionji Kinmochi.\n\nHara was appointed to the more senior role of Home Minister. Saionji’s government fell in 1912 in a power struggle with the military over funding the armed forces. Katsura returned to power but was very unpopular and resigned in 1913 amid rioting in Tokyo in opposition to his government, he was replaced by Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohyoe who resigned in April 1914, taking the fall for officers in his cabinet involved in a scandal over ministers earning kickbacks for an arms deal.\n\nYamamoto was succeeded by Okuma Shigenobu, who was a member of Katsura’s party the Rikken Doshikai. Okuma embroiled the country in World War One and, seeing an opportunity to extend Japanese influence in China while the European powers were preoccupied with the war, he drafted a set of demands made to China that increased Japanese control over parts of China. He too was driven from power, in 1916, over a scandal involving excessive expenditure on the armed forces. His successor was another military officer, Terauchi Masatake whose government fell in 1918 due to riots brought on by inflation and crowds seeing rice being sent to feed Japanese troops involved in action against the Communists in Siberia.\n\nMeanwhile Hara had taken over as leader of Rikken Seiyukai replacing Saionji in 1914. His party had a majority in the parliament and when Terauchi resigned, Hara was appointed Prime Minister. He was the first commoner and the first Christian to fill the role.\n\nUnlike previous governments, Hara was able to fill his ministry with members of his own party, making for a more stable government.\n\nHara broadened the franchise, lowering property qualifications for voting, but refused to use his majority in parliament to introduce universal male suffrage, which angered some people who saw this move as a way of propping up his power. Opposed to Japan’s military involvement in Siberia, also deepening involvement in China, he also tried to reduce some of the oppression in Korea, which was under Japanese rule. He was therefore viewed with suspicion by the military and by nationalist supporters of the military. Under his leadership Hara urged closer relations with the US and was assassinated in November 1921 while a delegation from Japan was taking part in talks in Washington over limiting naval power in the Pacific region. Hara’s assassin was sentenced to life but got out in 13 years.\n\nThe Rikken Seiyukai remained influential in politics for some time, but a succession of coalition governments ensued and the party’s vote share and influence waned over the course of the 1920s. By the beginning of the 1930s the power struggle between the military and parliament was being won by the armed forces.\n\nHara was not the last Japanese PM to be assassinated. In November 1930 Japan’s “Lion Prime Minister” Osachi Hamaguchi was shot in the stomach at Tokyo station just as he was about to board a train. Again it was a right wing nationalist angry that Osachi was about to sign a disarmament agreement. In 1932 Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was shot dead by naval officers. While the officers were court martialed their punishment was light, a sign that the rule of law was breaking down and that democracy was in danger."
