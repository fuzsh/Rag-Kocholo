        "text": "The Japanese military gained too much power in the process of winning the two major wars against China and Russia and young officers became too cocky to believe that they could control the political system through coercion. As a result, elite officers formed secret terror groups to plan military coups and dozens of political figures were assassinated by these far-right groups in the 1930s. The emperor appointed Tojo prior to Pearl Harbor because he was afraid of being assassinated by ultra nationalists and even Hirohito did not have the veto power over the military path that Japan had taken.\n\nPlenty of webnovels have been written on this era.\n\nRed Dawn is a fairly controversial and well-known webnovel.\n\nThe premise of the novel is that People's Party (the equivalent of Chinese Communist Party) and the People's Republic of China\n\nwas established in 1921 (not 1949).\n\nIkki Kita and his group had support from People's Party and involved in \"Showa Reformation\" in the webnovel.\n\nHalting Japanese militarism in the 1930s meant:\n\nMajor upsets for Japanese military (nothing short of disastrous) in the 1930s (or even earlier, as in Red Dawn).\n\nSpeculative timeline is quite difficult because it can change the whole course of history.\n\nbut he still supported Japanese economic rights in Manchuria.\n\nSome Chinese people see the dangers of Inukai Tsuyoshi's plan and call it \"the gradual boiling of the frog\" or \"the dangers of the so-called moderate\".\n\nA lot of countries supported a lot of economic rights in China into the 1920s and 1930s and until 1943, that had not exactly been freely given by China. And this was in an era when the Chinese people had increasingly had more than enough of it. So multiple countries, US, UK, France (in places like Shanghai), even USSR (on Chinese Eastern Railway) had extraterritorial rights and limited numbers of troops and ships in some parts of China. Before 1931, Japan's level of involvement in China was no different from them.\n\nChina's rolling back of foreign privileges of even the non-Japanese foreigners was \"a negotiation\" that was a tense tug of war at times, that wasn't completed with the west until 1943 or with the Soviet Union until 1955. So I don't know what better China could have expected from Japanese governments in the 1920s or politicians like Inukai."
