Chaplin was almost assassinated during a visit to Japan years before this speech, in an attempt to turn the island in a totalitarian dictatorship under the emperor.\n\nThe conspirators just missed him but killed the Prime Minister at the time Inukai Tsuyoshi. I'm pretty sure they call the event the May 15th Incident. Anyways, Chaplin returned to the Prime Minister's residence with his Tsuyoshi's son and saw his blood all over floor. It must have made a stark impression."
