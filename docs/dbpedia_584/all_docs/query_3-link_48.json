        "text": "TOKYO, Feb. 22, 1932 (UP) --The Seiyukai party government headed by Premier Tsuyoshi Inukai was returned to power today by a landslide exceeding its fondest hopes.\n\nThe government, prosecuting its military campaign against China, was given an overwhelmingly popular mandate in almost complete returns from Saturday's election. With only 18 of the 466 diet seats unreported, the standing was:\n\nSeiyukai 288, Minseito144, Labor 5, Others 11, Unreported 18, Total 466.\n\nInukai expressed extreme gratification at the expression of the nation's confidence, which he said would enable the government to proceed vigorously with financial and industrial reconstruction and solution of the China problem.\n\nThe Minseito campaign manager, Chuji Mahida, former cabinet minister, attributed the party's crushing defeat to the government's interference with the election and to the unfavorable popular reaction to the recent assassination of Junosuke Inouye, former finance minister.\n\nAn extra session of the Diet probably will be held in April.\n\nIn the last Diet, the Minseito Party, headed by Baron Reijiro Wakatsuki, held 251 seats and the Seiyukai 171. Premier Inukai had predicted that his party would win 230 or 235 seats.\n\nA cabinet meeting was scheduled for today to consider sending heavy reinforcements to Shanghai, altho a government spokesman indicated immediate dispatch of additional forces was not likely.\n\nThe spokesman based his prediction on the report from Shanghai of Japanese Minister Momoru Shigemitsu, who said it was likely that expulsion of the Chinese army from the Shanghai area would be accomplished in a week.\n\n(Copyright 1932 by United Press)"
