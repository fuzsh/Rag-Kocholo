        "text": "Ancestors\n\nProblems/Questions\n\nProfile last modified 10 Jul 2024 | Created 2 Jul 2019\n\nThis page has been accessed 1,013 times.\n\nBiography\n\nJohannes Stark is Notable.\n\nJohannes Stark is born April 15, 1874 in Schickenhof, German Empire.[1] He was the son of farmer Georg Stark and Maria Margaretha Christina Gollwitzer.[2]\n\nHe is a German physicist who is awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1919 \"for his discovery of the Doppler effect in canal rays and the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields\". This phenomenon is known as the Stark effect.\n\nStark receives his Ph.D. in physics from the University of Munich in 1897 under the supervision of Eugen von Lommel, and serves as Lommel's assistant until his appointment as a lecturer at the University of Göttingen in 1900. He is an extraordinary professor at the University of Hannover from 1906 until he becomes a professor at RWTH Aachen University in 1909. In 1917, he becomes professor at the University of Greifswald, and also works at the University of Würzburg from 1920 to 1922.\n\nA supporter of Adolf Hitler from 1924, Stark is one of the main figures, along with fellow Nobel laureate Philipp Lenard, in the anti-Semitic Deutsche Physik movement, which seeks to remove Jewish scientists from German physics. He is appointed head of the German Research Foundation in 1933 and is president of the Reich Physical-Technical Institute from 1933 to 1939. In 1947, he is found guilty as a \"Major Offender\" by a denazification court.\n\nJohann Nikolaus Stark married Luise Katharina Uebler on 16 Aug 1905 at Bezirksamt Mannheim, Kreis Mannheim, Großherzogtum Baden, Deutsches Reich. The transcription lists his parents as Joh. Georg Stark and Maria Christine Margarethe (alias Gollwitzer) and hers as Johann Friedrich Uebler and Eva Maria Magdalena (alias Bärenklau). He was born 15 April 1874 and she was born 21 September 1884. [3] Note that this paragraph relies on the transcription online except for his birth date, which was transcribed incorrectly. Her family name is written with a \"b\" rather than the \"p\" seen on most sites.\n\nStark dies June 21, 1957 in Traunstein, West Germany. There is a monument shown on FindAGrave, but it is not clear whether this was the actual burial location.[4]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nJohann Stark's wife is called Luise Uepler at the Nobel prize site[5] and that spelling has been copied elsewhere. It seems to be incorrect. Her marriage record shows Uebler and a German biography site has Uebeler.[6] Also note that while \"ü \"is often written \"ue\" in English the German sources have \"Ue\" at the beginning of the name, so this was apparently not a name with an umlaut.\n\nA biographical sketch at FindAGrave names his parents Alton Stark and Elizabeth Erhart. This contradicts the names Joh. Georg Stark and Maria Christine Margarethe (alias Gollwitzer) seen elsewhere, but more work is needed to resolve this.\n\nThe Nobel site says that he had five children. A headstone naming Johannes and Luisa also shows Friedrich (1906-1955) and Maria (1915-1995). The Deutsche Biographie site appears to list 2 sons, Fritz and Hans and 3 daughters Anneliese (1913), Elfriede (1914), and Marlene (1914). This is packed into a single cryptic line, so it is not clear whether the years represent birth dates or something else, nor is it even certain that S stands for Sohn and T for Tochter as I have assumed. This information can't be considered definitive, but may provide useful starting points for further research.\n\nSources\n\n↑ \"Johannes Stark,\" Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Stark&oldid=1154627338 (accessed May 26, 2023).\n\n↑ From Family Sheet 3764 of the Thansuess Ortssippenbuch prepared by Gottlieb Glockner.\n\n↑ Marriage: \"Germany, Lutheran Baptisms, Marriages, and Burials, 1500-1971\"\n\nciting Marriage, Bezirksamt Mannheim, Kreis Mannheim, Großherzogtum Baden, Deutsches Reich, , German Lutheran Collection, various parishes, Germany.\n\nFamilySearch Record: QPDD-2X6B (accessed 26 May 2023)\n\nFamilySearch Image: 3Q9M-CS43-5Q6T-K Image number 00611\n\nJohann Nikolaus Stark marriage to Luise Katharina Uebler on 16 Aug 1905 in Bezirksamt Mannheim, Kreis Mannheim, Großherzogtum Baden, Deutsches Reich.\n\n↑ Memorial: Find a Grave (has image)\n\nFind A Grave: Memorial #219006583 (accessed 26 May 2023)\n\nMemorial page for Johannes Stark (15 Apr 1874-21 Jun 1957), citing Bergfriedhof, Berchtesgaden, Berchtesgadener Land, Bavaria (Bayern), Germany; Maintained by Find a Grave.\n\n↑ Johannes Stark – Biographical.
