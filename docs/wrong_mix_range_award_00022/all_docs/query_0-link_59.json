        "text": "Some people may think librarians have the best job in the world. We get to buy books…professionally. It is pretty great, but we can’t and don’t just buy whatever tickles our fancy. We work hard to make sure the books we’re buying for the collection support the action, whether that’s purchasing what scholars near and far recommend to us, trying to predict the future to acquire what scholars of tomorrow may want, or supporting the work our colleagues do at the Niels Bohr Library & Archives or Center for History of Physics. The last thing we want is for the books we buy to fly onto the shelves (yes, that’s how processing and cataloging work, let’s pretend just for now) and never get pulled down again. We want them to be read and used and dogeared (only in your imaginations please, we’re happy to supply you with bookmarks). Though the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how research happens all over the world, and increasingly people are accessing information virtually, we know there’s still a place for the gorgeous smell of a new or used book. Not just to have them, but to use them. These are just some of the books we purchased this year and why we purchased them.\n\nÉmilie du Châtelet Acquisitions\n\nEvery summer, NBLA and CHP are lucky enough to get to sponsor a Society of Physics Students intern. In 2022, we worked with the amazing Emma Goulet. SPS interns always inspire collection development, and this year was no exception. Emma produced a teaching guide and several articles about French natural philosopher and mathematician Gabrielle Émilie Le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise du Châtelet (1706-1749), better known simply as Émilie du Châtelet, whose intellectual accomplishments have often been overshadowed by her love affair with Voltaire. We bought these books to support her research:\n\nZinsser, Judith, Emilie du Châtelet: Daring Genius of the Enlightenment, 2007\n\nA biography about the great lady. From the publisher: “Although today she is best known for her fifteen-year liaison with Voltaire, Gabrielle Emilie le Tonnelier de Breteuil, Marquise Du Châtelet (1706-1749) was more than a great man's mistress. After marrying a marquis at the age of eighteen, she proceeded to fulfill the prescribed-and delightfully frivolous-role of a French noblewoman of her time. But she also challenged it, conducting a highly visible affair with a commoner, writing philosophical works, and translating Newton's Principia while pregnant by a younger lover. “\n\nGunderson, Lauren, Emilie: La Marquise du Châtelet Defends Her Life Tonight, 2010\n\nIn this play, Gunderson explores Emilie’s life through the questions: Love or philosophy? Head or heart?\n\nDoes a play have a place in a history of physics library? We firmly believe that fiction and the arts are ways to explore the history of physics. We’ve been growing our offerings in these areas, and this is not our first play in the collection, and indeed not our first Lauren Gunderson! In 2019, we went to see a local production of Gunderson’s Silent Sky, which is about American astronomer Henrietta Swan Leavitt; read Digital Archivist Audrey’s “Curating the Sky” post.\n\nBrading, Katherine, Émilie Du Châtelet and the Foundations of Physical Science, 2019\n\nHere is a selection that doesn’t focus on du Chatelet’s love life! A book of philosophy of science, it argues that Du Châtelet put her finger on the central problems that lay at the intersection of physics and metaphysics at the time.\n\ndu Châtelet, Emilie, The Art of Happiness: The Reflections of Madame du Châtelet, 2017\n\nOriginally written by Mme. du Chatelet at the age of 40 in 1746, this English translation gives readers a personal look into her thoughts and feelings. How does one stay happy, in and out of love, with old age creeping in, as a woman in 18th century French society? Many of her thoughts are still very relevant today. This book is a special favorite of Corinne’s.\n\nQuote text: \"To be happy, we need to strip away our prejudices, be virtuous, enjoy good health, have tastes and passions, be susceptible to illusions, since we owe the majority of our pleasures to illusion, and unhappy is the person who loses that capacity.\" - Émilie du Châtelet, The Art of Happiness\n\nContinuation of quote: “Far from seeking therefore to make it disappear by the torch of reason, let us try to thicken the veneer that it places upon the majority of objects. Illusion is even more necessary to them than are care and adornments to our bodies.”\n\nHagengruber, Ruth (Ed.), Emilie du Châtelet between Leibniz and Newton, 2011\n\nThis book is a compilation of essays about Emilie du Châtelet’s philosophy. From the publisher: “The contributions in this volume… analyze the nature and motivation of Emilie du Châtelet's synthesis of Newtonian and Leibnitian philosophy. Apart from the Institutions Physiques they deal with Emilie du Châtelet's annotated translation of Isaac Newton's Principia. The chapters presented here collectively demonstrate that her work was an essential contribution to the mediation between empiricist and rationalist positions in the history of science.”\n\nAV Acquisitions!\n\nThis year, we embarked on an A/V mini-project in the library. This category of library materials, which includes (but is not limited to) CDs, tapes, phonographic records, DVDs, VHSs, and more, has been somewhat haphazardly collected by the library over the years since NBLA was founded in 1962. Our librarians collect published A/V materials and house them in our open stacks (can be browsed by the public), whereas, in a separate collection, our archivists tend to collect A/V materials that are unpublished (like the William F. Meggers Home Movies Collection) or that come in with other donations and house them in the closed archives stacks (a staff member must retrieve these for patrons). Our archival collection of A/V materials has been well-established over the years, in contrast to the library’s A/V holdings. The project in 2022 consisted of:\n\nEvaluating our existing library A/V items\n\nEstablishing cataloging procedures for library A/V items and correcting cataloging of existing A/V items as appropriate\n\nRehousing a good chunk of library A/V items so they will not get lost on the shelves\n\nSeeking out and purchasing new library A/V items\n\nWe welcome you to send us your recommendations for A/V or books to add to our collections through our recommendation form!\n\nA few DVDs purchased for the library this year include:\n\nWomen in Engineering DVD, 2007\n\nThe subtitle says it all: ”the best kept secret to changing the world.” From the publisher: “Featuring women engineers from companies all over the United States, this video offers women encouragement to pursue engineering.”\n\nRock N Learn: Physical Science DVD, 2008\n\nThis one fits in our physical science educational materials collection development objective. From the publisher: “Marko the Pencil makes understanding science easy and fun! Join Marko the Pencil as he takes students on a fascinating journey to his Super Science Station where it's easy to grasp science concepts. Designed for students in 5th grade, but learners at all levels will find the information fun and informative.”\n\nBold Visions: Women in Science and Technology DVD, 2008\n\nFrom the publisher: “A glimpse into the lives of women who are dispelling the myths commonly associated with professionals who work in the fields of science and technology: a research scientist searching for genetic causes of diseases, an astronaut who applies her engineering expertise in space, and a technologist who is as agile leading a team of colleagues as she is playing soccer with her sons. Their work is exciting, collaborative, and makes a difference to the quality of our lives.”\n\nMeteorology Acquisitions\n\nIn the mid-2010s, NBLA staff made the decision to expand one of its collection areas: meteorology, or the branch of science that focuses on the atmosphere and the prediction of weather. We collaborated with an expert to curate a bibliography of works that would help us to achieve this goal. This list includes both rare and non-rare books, which we have been steadily purchasing since 2015. In 2022, we crossed a few of the rare books off of the list, including The Climate of London. *Check out the photo gallery at the end of the post for images\n\nHoward, Luke, The Climate of London, Deduced From Meteorological Observations Made in the Metropolis and at Various Places Around It, second edition, 3 vols, 1833\n\nThe Climate of London is sometimes considered to be the first textbook in English on climatology, and indeed, the three volumes (expanded from the two volumes of the first edition) describe and analyze climate in general, not just the climate of London. Its author, Luke Howard (1772-1864), was the first person to name various cloud types. Our copy is inscribed by him to his grandson on the title page. If you can’t make the trip to College Park to look at our copy, take a look at the International Association for Urban Climate’s free online edition.\n\nReid, William, An Attempt to Develop The Law of Storms by Means of Facts, Arranged According to Place and Time: and Hence to Point Out a Cause, 1846\n\nSir William Reid became obsessed with hurricanes in 1831 when he was assigned to assist with the reconstruction of Barbados after the Great Barbados hurricane. An Attempt to Develop The Law of Storms the result of his study of tropical storms, including scientific ideas developed with William Redfield. Internet Archive has a digitized copy of an earlier edition of this work. William Reid was also Governor of the Bermudas, the British Windward Islands, and Malta during his lifetime. My personal favorite accomplishment, however, is his founding of the Bermuda National Library in 1839.\n\nBlodget, Lorin, Climatology of the United States: and of the temperate latitudes of the North American continent, embracing a full comparison of these with the climatology of the temperate latitudes of Europe and Asia, and especially in regard to agriculture, sanitary investigations, and engineering : with isothermal and rain charts for each season, the extreme months, and the year, including a summary of the statistics of meteorological observations in the United States, condensed from recent scientific and official publications, 1857\n\nLorin Blodget is often considered to be a major early figure of American climatology. In the years following its 1857 publication, Climatology of the United States circulated widely and was well-received in Europe. The book has 12 folding maps and charts and is one of the first comprehensive American works on climatology and meteorology. Find a digitized version of the US National Library of Medicine’s copy of this book on the Internet Archive.\n\nGarriott, Edward, Ed., Weather Folklore and Local Signs, 1903\n\nThis book is a US Government Printing Office publication. The first part of the book examines different topics of weather (birds, clouds, seasons) through the lore of various authors and through oral tradition. The second part contains weather station reports to the chief of the US Weather Bureau, arranged alphabetically by town name, making it an invaluable resource for anyone studying climate change and the history of the climate.\n\nMiscellaneous Acquisitions"
