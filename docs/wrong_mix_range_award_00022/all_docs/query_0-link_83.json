The news of his nomination has only just come out in the past ten days or so, so I assume that the nomination itself is quite recent. The Nobel Committee takes its time: it actually reads the works of those it's considering. Dylan would be eligible in 1997 at the earliest.\n\n-- last year's winner was Seamus Heaney, an Irish male poet. The Nobel likes to scatter things around. This year the winner is a Polish female poet. Likely rotation suggests that next year will be an Indian male novelist. It may be quite a few years before a male poet from a western country comes around again.\n\nStephen\n\nSubject: Dylan nominated for Nobel Prize!!!!!\n\nFrom: highland@interaccess.com (Josh Miller)\n\nDate: 1996/10/03\n\nOn Mon, 30 Sep 1996 18:47:41 -0400, Tom Lace (tomlace@WESTOL.COM) wrote: >While I'm a huge fan of Bob's, I was quite surprised to hear of his Nobel >Prize for Literature nomination.

In many of Dylan's songs, the aesthetic unity comes from the music and the vocal performance, not from the words. That's why their songs, not poems.

Professor Gordon Ball, who nominated Bob, apparently read the ad in The Telegraph appealing for support. All nominations must be sent to the Swedish academy before February 1. Later in the spring a Nobel prize committee within the academy reduces the numbers of those nominated to a list of five names which is then passed on to the members in the academy so that they can read works by these authors during their summer holiday. Then the academy decides which one of these five will receive the Nobel prize. The announcement of the 1997 winner will be made in the first week of October. All of which makes you wonder if those old Swedes have CD players, and if they'll be given advice on the right tracks to play . . . I mean, what if one of them cues up I'll Remember You?\n\n************************************************************** John Bauldie The Telegraph bauldie@mail.bogo.co.uk **************************************************************\n\nSubject: Nobel/Paul Williams\n\nFrom: Bruce Williams (xpertnet@ocs1.ocs.mq.edu.au)\n\nDate: 1996/10/10\n\nHi,\n\nFor a radio program I work on in Australia (a writing program called Final Draft) I reviewed the Paul Williams book Watching the River Flow in the context of the Nobel Prize, thought you might get a laugh.\n\nCheers\n\nBruce\n\n_____________________________ Final Draft review 2SER-FM by Bruce Williams\n\nFirst, all the wrong footy teams won in the finals, then there was the farce of the ARIA awards, but nothing, nothing prepared Bruce Williams for the shock news that Bob Dylan did not win this year's Nobel Prize for literature.\n\nTake it away, Bruce ...\n\n________________________________\n\nAnd that's exactly what they did.\n\nThere's only one possible explanation for why Bob Dylan, nominated for the first time for the world cup of creativity, was robbed of his laurels.\n\nIt's an international anti-Jewish plot orchestrated by David Irving, who should be denied entry to this, or any other country unless or until Bob Dylan gets the guernsey he so richly and so obviously deserves.\n\nAnd who got it - some Polish Sheila who writes poetry - can you believe it?\n\nAnd what has she got that Bob Dylan hasn't? I mean we're talking about the guy who wrote:\n\nWe stayed up all night - till the break of dawn.\n\nand\n\nWe lived with them in Montague street\n\nin the basement down the stairs.\n\nand my personal favourite\n\nRing them bells\n\nfor the blind and the deaf\n\nGenius.\n\nWell, as a salve for the disappointment that every single decent human being must be feeling right about now, Omnibus Press has released a collection of essays and journalism by Paul Williams called Watching the River Flow. It's really good.\n\nIt begins with a review of the 1966 double album Blonde on Blonde, and finishes with an account of the 1995 Paradise Lost tour, which featured Patti Smith, REM, and wicked uncle Bob.\n\nBut the centre-piece, and why Bobists will, and non-Bobists should by this book, is the long essay first published in the late seventies, called: What Happened?\n\nLike so much of the work of Dylan himself, this essay, amounting to a small book's worth, was conceived and constructed double-quick. Begun in November 1979, it was in the bookshops before Christmas.\n\nIt's a weird piece of writing.\n\nPaul Williams tries to figure out how it happened that iconoclast Dylan got god, and not any god, but the god of born-again USA.\n\nIt's not a biography, he's got no access to letters or interviews with pals, he just saw a bunch of concerts, listened to a bunch of recordings, and came up with a bunch of really interesting conclusions. It's journalism, analytical and biased all at once. It's fanzine writing, describing his impressions of a series of concerts scarcely a month old, but its audience is obviously not just the converted. It's an odd one.\n\nWilliams points out that two major turn-arounds in Dylan's career happened after similar sequences of events - a change of direction, a group of terrific albums, followed by a long and tiring touring schedule.\n\nThe first break in continuity was the motorcycle accident shortly after the release of Blonde on Blonde, and the second was his conversion, following Street Legal and the Alimony tour.\n\nThe first marked the beginning of a long period of seeking for salvation through romantic love, and the second marked a period of seeking salvation through, well, salvation.\n\nWilliams explores the way Dylan over the years has characterised women, and how he has set himself up in relation to his lovers in his songs. He builds a strong case for a turn-around. But he falls just short of the point.\n\nEither tiresomely or heroically, Dylan paints himself, time and again, particularly in the 70s, as the trickster, the unpredictable male loner in a mythology dominated by women. His conversion to Christianity is represents a leap from matriarchal mythologies, back to Dad.\n\nIt's strange, Williams seems on the verge of saying this so many times, but it never quite comes out.\n\nLike most of the collection, this essay is at once insightful, adoring and critical, taking itself seriously enough for you to want to join in, but not so seriously for you to want to stick the pin in.\n\nAnd Bob read it himself, buying 100 or so copies to distribute amongst his friends - or should that be so-called friends.\n\nThe next story in the collection shows Paul Williams invited back stage where an appreciative Dylan reads to him the lyrics a new song he's proud of. Every Grain of Sand.\n\nIf Paul Williams can get that lucky, surely Bob can land a little thing like the Nobel Prize. Oh well, as they say, there's always next year.\n\nSubject: The poet behind his rightful time? - Dylan and the Nobel\n\nFrom: rollason@dialup.francenet.fr (CHRISTOPHER ROLLASON)\n\nDate: 1996/10/13\n\nThe poet behind his rightful time? Dylan and the Nobel\n\nWe now know that Dylan did _not_ get the 1996 Nobel Prize for Literature. On the other hand, we also know he was officially nominated for the prize, by Professor Gordon Ball with the support of Allen Ginsberg. This means that the members of the Swedish Academy must, at the least, have had to sit and look seriously at Dylan's work - read the lyrics and, perhaps, even listen to the records. Let us hope that the pressure will be kept up in future years (rmd has a role to play here!), and that Dylan's name will in future be regularly there on the list of Nobel nominees.\n\nIf Mr Zimmermann's admirers are to lobby successfully, some hard work will have to be done. Dylan certainly has his converts in the academic world - e.g. Christopher Ricks and Eric Griffiths - but there are also those who refuse to give serious attention to writing which they associate with the supposedly trivial world of rock'n'roll. As a former academic (Univ. of Coimbra, Portugal, 1980-87), I am more than willing to take part in any campaign. For now, I'd like to make a few points, just as a beginning:\n\n1. It is not unprecedented in history for a poet to make his or her mark through the medium of song. Examples include John Donne ('Songs and Sonnets'), Robert Burns and Rabindranath Tagore. Many of Yeats' poems have been set to music as Irish folk songs. Walter Scott began his writing career as a collector of the Scottish traditional ballads - which are themselves, although anonymous, perfect examples of poetry-as-song, and part of the folk narrative tradition that Dylan himself draws on ('ballad' in Dylan, as in titles like 'Ballad of Hollis Brown', means _not_ 'sentimental song', but 'narrative poem'). It is simply not true historically that there has always been a rigid dividing-line between 'poetry' and 'song'.\n\n2. One argument in Dylan's favour, at least in my view, is simple but crucial: his _use of rhyme_. Over the 20th century, English-language poetry very largely abandoned the use of rhyme (or of the old rhythmic alternative, blank verse) - one could argue, with disastrous results. The process began in the 19th century with Walt Whitman, who at least had a strong sense of rhythm to compensate; but its generalization has, in my opinion, produced torrents of flat, prosaic and unmemorable verse. Poetry in some other languages, such as Spanish or Portuguese, can survive the absence of rhyme and remain musical; English is not an innately musical language and, one might submit, needs that discipline of rhyme, or of a regular form like blank verse, if poetry is to be something more than left-justified prose. As I see it, the genuine English-language poets of this century have been few: in England, Thomas Hardy; in Ireland, W.B. Yeats; in the US, Hart Crane, T.S. Eliot and Robert Frost. None of these completely abandoned the tradition of rhyme/blank verse; Yeats and Frost, in particular, remained wedded to traditional forms. Frost died in 1963, and I am not sure that there has since been any continuator of the art of expressive speech-in-rhyme - except Bob Dylan. Detailed examination of Dylan's use of rhyme is for another time, but I think it's a far from inappreciable point. Just one example: 'I am a lonesome hobo, without family or friends/Where another man's life might begin, that's exactly where mine ends'. Surely 'ends' here is far more powerful than 'stops' or 'closes' would have been; the rhyme brings 'ends', with its sense of finality, into direct relation with 'friends', so linking the ideas of friendlessness and hopelessness and reinforcing the sensation of stark desolation that surrounds the 'hobo'.\n\n3. The development of Dylan's work over the years is another important aspect. I think there is a fair case for saying that the best of the later Dylan (which I take as the period from 'Blood on the Tracks' on, or approximately that covered by 'Greatest Hits III') is actually superior in songwriting quality to the best of the 'famous' earlier Dylan. Again, this would have to be shown in detail, but I would stick my neck out and say that later songs like 'Tangled Up In Blue', 'Isis', 'Every Grain of Sand', 'Jokerman', 'Brownsville Girl' or 'Dignity' actually display clearer structure, more interesting narrative, more focused vision and, indeed, better command of English grammar than more celebrated songs like 'Gates of Eden', 'Desolation Row' or 'Visions of Johanna'. This is not to devalue the early songs, far from it, nor to deny that there is a fair amount of mediocre material in the later years. But I think that where Dylan has made an effort the quality of the best later songs is more consistent, with less unevenness, less vagueness, and a surer sense of where the song's creative dynamic is heading. More for another time: but I'd still say that a song like 'Jokerman' - scarcely-ever covered and known mostly to hard-core Dylan fans - has a far better claim to be considered Dylan's best-ever song than, say, the universally known 'Like a Rolling Stone'. Of course, it might also help if Dylan thought about writing a few more songs!\n\n4. Finally, one aspect of Dylan's writing that deserves pointing up is his ability to take an apparently dead phrase or set expression and bring it back to life - through surprising juxtapositions or new contexts which breathe new force into a dead metaphor. I'll give a few examples, all of them, by the way, from the later Dylan:\n\n'Heart of mine, be still/You can play with fire, but you'll get the bill' ('Heart of Mine') (the set phrase 'play with fire' is given new life, as 'fire' suggests physical damage and a bill to pay; after this reanimation of the literal sense, a new metaphor is introduced: the consequences of a failed relationship are as unpleasant as an unwelcome bill) 'The Book of Leviticus and Deuteronomy, The law of the jungle and the sea Are your only teachers' ('Jokerman') ('Law of the jungle' is a set phrase, suggesting Darwinism and the survival of the fittest; 'law of the sea' is an actual legal term; and the biblical books mentioned set out the divine law of the Old Testament. Dylan runs together three different types of law - natural, juridical and religious - suggesting that institutional law ('the law of the sea') is no better or fairer than the non-human law of the jungle, and also casting doubt over the authoritarian divine law of the Pentateuch) 'Feel the pulse and vibration and the rumbling force - Somebody is out there beating on a dead horse' ('Man in a Long Black Coat') (Dylan brings to life the tired metaphor of 'flogging a dead horse', so that we feel and hear the act of beating itself. The image suggests a sterile, worn-out community which has lost all creativity and can do nothing but repeat useless gestures) * * *\n\nThese are just a few ideas, and I'd appreciate any comments, either on what I've written or on the general subject of Dylan and the Nobel. Perhaps some time next century he will indeed get the award, and the sky will crack its palms in naked wonder!\n\nPlease email me!\n\nChristopher Rollason\n\nMetz, France\n\nhome: rollason@dialup.francenet.fr\n\nwork: crollason@europarl.eu.inst\n\n'but would not change my free thoughts for a throne' (Byron)\n\nSubject: Nobel Meditations\n\nFrom: Dan Mayshar (mayshar@hum.huji.ac.il)\n\nDate: 1996/10/12\n\nIt's not that i care that much about who wins nobel prizes, but i spent a good week in searching the deep, hidden archives of pop music trivia in my brain for other examples of \"songwriters\" winning the prizes meant for \"novelists\" and \"poets\". only case i could think of was a vague memory of french balladeer georges brassens winning some big [french] award in the early 60's. is my memory playing tricks on me, or did this actually happen? it wouldn't be MUCH of a precedent, but it would be A precedent... or can anyone think of some other case of songwriters winning literary awards?\n\nface it, people, bob will just be another giant of 20th cent. lit. who never got the nobel prize (and that's most of them anyway: Joyce, Musil, Borges, Kafka, Svevo, Hasek et al.) But since Toni Morrison's [polite snicker] got hers, i can die happy [manic laughter].\n\nDan Mayshar West Jerusalem"
