        "text": "Alex Ashford\n\nBiology\n\nMentor - Claudia Ihl\n\nWith this project, I am seeking to sample and analyze muskoxen forage samples from disturbed feeding areas in and around Nome, Alaska for differential nutrient and mineral composition on mine tailings in comparison to naturally disturbed gravel bars. This may help explain why muskoxen are present and foraging in the city of Nome.\n\nAbby Amick\n\nChemistry\n\nMentor - Jennifer Guerard\n\nThis project will use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to analyze pore water samples from permafrost and non-permafrost lakes in the Fairbanks area. By analyzing the composition of organic matter at different depths in the lake beds, we hope to better understand how climate change affects thawing permafrost lakes.\n\nMadeline Andriesen, Jenna Dreydoppel, Taylor Hendricks, Jonathan Lange, Lindsay Moisan, and Phoenix Williams\n\nMusic Education and Vocal Performance\n\nMentor - Jaunelle Celaire\n\nThis outreach will include opera workshop performances by the UAF voice students at various Anchorage middle and high schools.

The team will be designing, building, and flying a remote-controlled aircraft that fulfills the design requirements and rules of the international competition.\n\nRowan Biessel\n\nGeoscience\n\nMentor - Franz Meyer\n\nVertical movement of the ground over volcanoes can potentially be a sign of future activity. This can be measured using remote sensing, but the signal can be distorted in the atmosphere. So that we can automatically monitor volcano deformation, I want to see how different volcanoes are affected by atmospheric errors.\n\nKatelynn Bushnell\n\nEconomics\n\nThe inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) can have several sorts of effects on the environment in developing countries. My research seeks to contribute to the debate by asking: What is the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) on China’s environment, for a given level of economic growth?\n\nEmily Cohen and Aidan Earnest\n\nPolitical Science\n\nMentor - Alex Hirsch\n\nAlaska currently faces a sexual violence epidemic, with sexual assault rates three times the national average. Our project will comparatively analyze states’ statutory consent laws and the significant impact of these laws on sexual crime rates, ultimately producing a definition of consent to be implemented into Alaska Statute.\n\nJalen Cox\n\nGeoscience\n\nMentor - Jeff Benowitz\n\nWe aim to test if about 20,000 years ago a glacial outburst megaflood drained through the Matanuska Valley sourced from Glacial Lake Atna which covered much of the Copper River Basin at this time. Our tests will determine if “megaflood” sediment samples from the Matanuska Valley, are from Lake Atna.\n\nNick Hasson\n\nChemistry & Biochemistry\n\nMentor - Jennifer Guerard\n\nInside of the U.S. Army Permafrost Tunnel near Fairbanks, Alaska (CREEL), we will determine the significance of Magnetotactic bacteria and single-domain magnetite in hemipelagic loess sediments, which have important implications for astrobiology and climate. The unrepresented in-situ tunnel access and loess magnetic susceptibility record is important terrestrial proxy for Mars analogs.\n\nAlexandra Keller\n\nChemistry and Biochemistry\n\nMentor - Tom Green\n\nUsing capillary electrophoresis with laser induced fluorescence to separate the stereoisomers of sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate. Sphingosine kinase will be used to phosphorylate sphingosine and enzymatic kinetics will be determined by capillary electrophoresis. Competitive inhibition of sphingosine kinase is expected by the unnatural stereoisomers compared to natural extracted sphingosine.\n\nLauren Livers\n\nGeoscience\n\nMentor - Elisabeth Nadin\n\nI intend to get ages and compositions of two igneous rock bodies that cut across basin sediments in southern Alaska. This data will test if these rocks belong with a widespread family of similar-looking igneous rocks in the area, and also document when stress in the basin was extensional.\n\nDeAnna Lowden\n\nChemistry & Biochemistry\n\nMentor - Kelly Drew\n\nThis project uses the knowledge gathered from hibernating arctic ground squirrels and their mechanism for saving energy during the cold months. We are mimicking this response with the use of developmental drugs to potentially treat people who suffer from cardiac arrest to improve their survival rates.\n\nKellie Lynch\n\nInterdisciplinary Studies\n\nMentor - Sveta Yamin-Pasternak\n\nThis project will apply participatory action methodologies to explore cross cultural comparative music by introducing Gamelan music, an Indonesian music that is played on metallophones and gongs.

Heavy metals, perfluorooctanoic acid, fecal matter and nitrate being the pollutants that will specifically be sought out and tested for.\n\nRodney Tracht\n\nPsychology\n\nMentor - Jennifer Peterson\n\nThis study aims to confirm the relationship between social media use and the amount of loneliness experienced by adults 60 or older. This study will attempt to show a correlation between increased social media use and a lessening of the feelings of loneliness among this group of people.\n\nSierra vonHafften Natural Resource Management\n\nMentor - Christina Buffington\n\nI will research the relationship between air quality and the potential effects that it may have on the water quality in the Fairbanks area through the absorption of said pollution by precipitation. Testing conducted will include PM2.5 levels, pH and the concentrations of nitrogen, sulfur, and ammonia.\n\nPhillip Wilson\n\nGeoscience\n\nMentor - Dan Mann\n\nLittle is known about the prehistoric surges of the Black Rapids Glacier despite the threats these surges pose to the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and Richardson Highway. My goal is to reconstruct the history of glacier surges and outburst floods from lakes dammed when this glacier advanced across the Delta River valley.\n\nAnthony Zizza, Kyle Jones, Joseph Becker and Ron Hansen\n\nMentor - Chengfu-Chen\n\nOur senior project group is currently working on a redesign of Dr. Chen's current stress-corrosion cracking (SCC) equipment. This will provide the university a safe, fast and compact setup to perform the testing of a specimen under a tensile load within a corrosive environment.\n\nJamie Clark\n\nAnthropology\n\nEngaging undergraduates in zooarchaelogical research at the Croxton Site (Tukuto Lake, Northern Alaska)\n\nClark, Taylor Vollman and other undergraduates will research materials from a site that is believed to have served as a focal point for hunting/processing during seasonal caribou migration through the Brooks Range. Students will be involved in basic data collection and more specialized analyses; with the goal of creating a series of publications.\n\nCarie Green\n\nEducation\n\nChildren’s environmental identity development in an Alaskan rural and non-rural context\n\nGreen and her undergraduate students will conduct a participatory longitudinal project utilizes multiple methods (parent surveys, children’s drawings and descriptions, child-led nature tours using wearable cameras, and educational approaches) to investigate the emotional and behavioral processes of children’s environmental identity development in an Alaskan non-rural and rural village context.\n\nTracie Haan and Taylor Seitz\n\nBiology and Wildlife\n\nAntibiotic Exploration in Sub-Arctic Soils\n\nHaan and Seitz will host a multi-day workshop unearthing antibiotics from Fairbanks soils. Undergraduates will have the opportunity to learn methods and techniques needed to produce cutting edge microbiological research, from the formulation of a research question to bacterial culturing, antibiotic production assays, and whole genome sequencing of antibiotic producing bacteria.
