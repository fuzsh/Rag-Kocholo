Loula leaves behind her three daughters, Effie (Dimitris) Arvanitis, Joanne (Haris) Basiakos, and Elaine (the late James) Papanton, her eight grandchildren, Dina (Marcel) Mihalaris, Leonidas Arvanitis, Sotiris (Elisabeth) Basiakos, Vicky (Daniel) Sugden, Zackie (Frank) Kowal, Tricia Papanton, Aristotle (Kate) Papanton, and Nicole Papanton. She is also survived by her three, beloved great-grandsons Vasilis, Haris, and Francis Joseph Jr.\n\nIn addition to her immediate family, she also leaves behind countless nieces, nephews, and friends who absolutely adored her.\n\nLoula was the daughter of the late Pano and Eleni Angelos, and dear sister of the late Angelo (Kathy), the late Anthony (the late Eleni), the late Niko (the late Popi), the late Amalia (the late Pete) Deligianis, and the late Vivian (the late Dr. John) Christiakis.\n\nLoula came to the United States from Vrina, Greece; a small, Greek village, at only 23 years old, on April 30th, 1951. She arrived with her brother Tony; without the English language or money in their pockets. They stayed with their uncle Anthony Angelos, whom Loula adored and respected beyond words. She spoke of him often throughout her life with the utmost love, respect and nostalgia.\n\nShe worked tirelessly from the moment she arrived, taking a job in a bakery and later in a bank where she learned the English language and American way of life. After meeting Nick and becoming man and wife, they set forth on their journey to build something amazing for themselves and their girls, and to give them more than the two of them had ever had or dreamed of. She was married to her one true love, Nick Stolis, for 44 years. Together, they lived out the American dream and built an empire.\n\nThey were the original owners of Oak Lawn Restaurant, followed by Stoll’s Restaurant, Nick’s Fish Net, Pasta Di Familia, and Chantilly Banquets.\n\nChantilly was the gathering place for so many family weddings, Mother’s Day Brunches, kids’ birthday parties, and more. So many memories were made in that “pink palace” Loula and Nick built from the ground-up. Her sweet tables, set with beautiful ice sculptures and fruit baskets, were her greatest pride. Loula worked as the ultimate “boss lady” well into her mid-seventies. She knew the importance of keeping busy and she continued to find crafts and hobbies to take on and perfect, up to the day she left this earth. She made beautiful “miniatures” and other creations that adorn family and friends homes around the world. While she was still able, she’d frequently visit trade shows to find special beads to create one-of-a-kind jewelry. It was her love language to create beautiful things and then give them to family, friends, and new acquaintances.\n\nHer pieces are loved by those who have been gifted her work, all around the world!\n\nBesides keeping her hands busy with creating, she always kept her mind busy. She was a voracious reader to the very end and an avid student of history, specifically involving Asia Minor. She was able to recite facts from memory and would seamlessly weave her own experiences, along with family member’s experiences into those historical facts. She painted a vivid picture of history for all who would listen to her tell it. Her memory and stories will live on through the beautiful stories she shared, that her loved ones will pass down for generations.\n\nLoula always presented herself as the ultimate class-act and carried herself with grace and elegance from another time. A natural beauty, she’d never leave the house without a beautiful piece of jewelry, like pearls, around her neck and just a little lipstick. She carried herself in a coquettish fashion, like a Hollywood starlet from the 1940’s with her grace and affinity for fashion and beautiful things. Her greatest affinity, though, was for her family. She was fiercely loyal and protective for her family and gave her all to her loved ones, every single day of her life.\n\nShe was effortlessly quick-witted and funny. She blessed all her loved ones with so many laughs throughout their lives. Her loved ones were blessed to have so many beautiful years of love, beauty and laughter with Loula. She was one of a kind, truly an angel on Earth.\n\nHer family knows that although she will be dearly missed here on Earth, Loula is surely making Heaven a more fabulous place as she has been reunited with her true love, Nick, her parents, and all of her siblings.\n\nMay her memory be Eternal.

Verros, a resilient soul at age 90, peacefully passed away on February 4, 2024. He was born on March 18, 1933 in a village in Greece named Louka, Tripoli. He was a devoted and loving husband to his wife of 55 years, Petroula (Doulas). Loving father of Konstadina (Sotirios) Georgelos and Bob (Sophia) Verros. Proud pappouli of Valerie (Peter) Kotsiovos, Patricia (Leo-Paul) Bezanis, Pamela Georgelos, Petra and Christina Verros. Great pappouli of Christos, Evi, and Sam Kotsiovos. Dearest brother of late Fotini (late Manoli) Drogossis, late Panagiotis (late Eleni) Verros, late James (Katina) Verros, late Evagelia (late Dimitrios) Psyhogios, George (Toula) Verros, Eugenia (Peter) Kioussis, Vasiliki (late Petro) Doukas, late Thanasis and late Tasia Verros (passed at birth). Dearest brother-in-law of Nikoletta (late Harry) Panos, George (Maria) Doulas, late Vasilios (Lynn) Doulas, Anastasios (Effie) Doulas. Proud uncle of many nieces and nephews.\n\nHe embarked on a journey from Greece on April 19, 1966, to create a new chapter in his life in the USA. His immigrant spirit inspired all who knew him. He was a proud union worker at Radio Flyer manufacturing factory where he produced the famous red wagon. Notably, he started his own band, Asteria, captivating audiences with the traditional Greek music of his clarinet and leaving a lasting mark on the hearts of those who listened. Behind his musical pursuits, he found joy in revisiting his roots. After retirement, he spent many summers indulging in the beauty of his home in Milia, Tripoli, Greece. Year after year, he immensely enjoyed the strong bonds of friendship he had established there, and was excited for his return the next summer. Additionally, he had a passion for fixing broken things with duct tape and ropes, and spending many weekends at the flea market in pursuit for the perfect finds. He was “Mr. Fix it.”\n\nHis zest for life extended to the outdoors where he delighted in riding his bike and cultivating the Earth through gardening. May the echoes of his music, the warmth of summers in Greece, and the deep love for his family be everlasting of his remarkable legacy. His memory will be eternal in our hearts.

The time she got to spend with her sister in person was priceless. It would be wrong to say that Angeliki lost her battle because she never stopped fighting.

Trisagion service at 7:00 PM. Friends and Family asked to meet Friday morning 10:15 AM, December 22nd directly at St. Spyridon Greek Orthodox Church 12307 South Ridgeland Avenue Palos Heights Illinois 60463, for the 10:30 AM Funeral Service. Karen will be laid to rest near her beloved parents at Bethania Cemetery of Justice.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, memorials in Karen’s name will be donated according to the families wishes. Thank you.\n\nFor information please call or text Michael Orrico at 815/260-0668 or orricofuneral@comcast.net\n\nOn December 17th , in “Karen Style”, she left this world on the same day she came into it, on her birthday, where she peacefully passed away at home alongside her supporting family. Karen leaves behind Dean Keorpes, her incredibly devoted husband, three children: Jim (Jennifer) Keorpes, Peter (Laurel) Keorpes and Amelia (Devin) Wise, whom she showered with love, and four Grandchildren: Grayson, Brogan, Penelope and Constantine that she absolutely adored. Karen was the daughter of departed Peter and Amelia Deligianis and the loving sister of Helen (Don) Schmidt and Mary (Jim) Gianakakis. Although there are no words to describe our amazing Karen, a few come to mind. Loving, Epic, Eccentric, and maybe a little crazy (in a good kind of way). There was never, and never will be, a person quite like her. Her selfless nature to her family and friends was evident even in the darkest of moments and her values that she instilled in her children will live on forever. If you wanted to know the definition of true love, look only at her 44-year marriage to Dean, a true example of what anyone could ever hope for. Karen loved to travel and enjoyed spending time with her family and friends. From warm beach getaways, where she walked miles on the sand alongside her husband, to enjoying gelato (Stat!) on the most incredible vacation to Italy and Croatia with her family only a few years ago. But no matter the destination, the only thing that mattered most was that her family was there and this is what gave her true joy. The memories she shared that gave her the most happiness were always with family and primarily involved food and drink. But truly, isn’t that where all the best memories are always made? From the banquet parties at the Delphian House, holiday gatherings at her sisters or just a simple Wednesday dinner (nothing “simple” about it) at Yiayoula and Papou’s, she simply loved being around her grandparents, parents, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, nieces, nephews, husband, children and grandchildren. This is what she lived for and gave her the most happiness in life. Karen possessed unbelievable talents and was known for her passion of art. Her talented works are a physical part of her that she leaves behind for us. In particular, her final piece on display at her wake. This piece is a symbol of her strength; she pushed through to make certain she completed this work of art even while in the midst of her difficult battle. She not only created these works of art, but as a high school teacher of 23 years passed on these skills to her students and helped them further develop their own skills, not only in the arts, but their futures as young adults. Karen was taken from us much too early. Although she had so much more to give us in this life, she did live a fulfilling and beautiful life that most would never experience even in two lifetimes. The people that she touched was evident in the constant support she had during her battle. Everyone would tell me what an incredible person she is; noting her electric personality, her warm smile and her loving hugs. She was never short of kind words, a willingness to help and quick to make you smile with her uniquely quirky personality. People just could not help but be moved by her and how being around her brought out the happiness in everyone. Certainly, everyone’s life that Karen touched has been made just a little bit brighter. The world may now be not as bright with you gone, but I am so proud to call you, my Mana. Your memory will always burn eternally and, although that cannot replace the brilliant brightness of your life, I hope your flame is bright enough to shine upon us when we need you the most.\n\nJohn D.

Theofilos lived a full life that took him all over the world; always a fighter from the start of his life to its end. He was resilient in the face of the obstacles and adversity that came his way. He was born on December 18th, 1925 on the island of Ikaria, the oldest of 8 siblings, and as a young boy worked on the boats (καΐκια). At the age of 16, he joined the Greek resistance during World War II. He was captured by the Germans and first sent to Genti Koule prison in Thessaloniki and then a concentration camp in Germany for three years, where he was sentenced to hard labor. Once the camps were liberated, he made the journey back home to Greece on foot which took five months. He went on to join the Greek Merchant Marines and traveled all over the world. Eventually, he went to the United States, where he met his wife Anna Facaros, settled in Chicago and had 3 children. Through his hard work, he became a successful restaurant owner and helped some of his siblings come to the Unites States. He retired and returned with Anna to his beloved Ikaria, where he enjoyed the next 37 years fishing and spending time with his family and friends.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his wife Anna Kotsores, son Tracy Kotsores (late Maria), and grandson Nick Kotsores.
