        "text": "Oops! We did it again... Our mischievous eye for a tabloid friendly picture has forced wee Donegal model Michelle Doherty to deny any romance with controversial Priests son Ross Hamilton. She swears they are just wee good \"friends\" so they are...\n\nRoss Hamilton, Michelle Doherty\n\nHere at ShowBiz Ireland, we've found over the years that it's just better to release our pictures to the press and let our photos speak for themselves... Well, you can never please everyone in this damned-if-you-do-damned-if-you-don't industry. So we DO... We are Millwall, no one likes us.\n\nRoss Hamilton, Michelle Doherty\n\nAfter the TVNow afterparty at Krystle recently, we spotted the son of the late Father Michael Cleary, Ross Hamilton, chancing his arm with model and hot Channel 6 presenter Michelle Doherty. So we took a few snaps of her 'Night Shift'. Ahem... Since then she's been linked in the media (no thanks required) to the handsome wannabe actor, forcing her to deny any relationship. She told the Herald (in a wee Donegal accent) today: \"I can't even have an innocent conversation without people linking us together. But myself and Ross are just friends. He's a lovely guy and I've known him for a while now, but that's really all there is between us.\" Okaaay. Has there ever been anyone linked romantically to Michelle that she hasnt denied?\n\nRosanna Davison, Wesley Quirke\n\nAnd speaking of other high profile couples at the Krystle afterparty, Rosanna Davison and beau Wesley Quirke were also spotted leaving the club in the wee hours (Michelle has us saying \"wee\"). Rosanna came out in the media today saying she managed to hold-on to her virginity until she was 18 and also hit out against Catholicism. She told Hot Press: \"The power of The Pope and people like that just annoys me. Look at the scandals. I'm just grateful that I was brought up in a Protestant way...\" Ian Paisley would be proud of ya Rosy! Random thought: with all her Das money you think she could afford to employ a press officer? Get Max Clifford on the phone. Like, now.\n\nAidan Power, guest\n\nThere were also a number of familiar faces from the Irish small-screen at the party, with new partners we've not seen before... First off, we spotted The Cafe's Aidan Power sneaking out the backdoor of Krystle with a hot mystery brunette...\n\nLisa Cannon, guest\n\nAlso emerging from the same door was Xpose's Lisa Cannon with a mystery man and a grin that would make the Cheshire Cat blush. Can we take a photo without Lisa popping up?\n\nClaire Byrne, guest\n\nWe also caught a peek of Newstalk 106's anchor woman Claire Byrne hot-tailing if off in a cab with a mystery man. These two were none-too-keen on posing up for pictures, so we didn't get them clean... Why bring your man to a PR event, and then hide from the cameras?\n\nAlan Hughes, boyfriend\n\nEven TV3's Alan Hughes left the afterparty with a mystery man. Jaysus! What is in the drinks at Krystle  Spanish Fly? Everyone feckin scored... If you recognise any of the mystery partners in these pictures please leave a comment below folks. Fill in the blanks.\n\nCharlie Clements, Roxanne Pallet\n\nFans of UK soaps will be glad to hear that a few of their favourite stars also hooked-up at the party. EastEnders Charlie Clements was spotted leaving the venue with Emmerdale's Roxanne Pallet.\n\nZoe Salmon, Gerard McCarthy\n\nHollyoaks' Gerard McCarthy jumped into a cab with Blue Peter hottie Zoe Salmon, although we think these two may have been an item for a while now...\n\nMichele McGrath\n\nThe Tudors actress and Assets model Michele McGrath left the party looking very dressed-down for the occasion. Well, her musician boyfriend Gavin Edwards was out of the country, so there was no one there she was trying to impress... Good girl Shelly!\n\nMarcus Sweeney, Leigh Arnold"
