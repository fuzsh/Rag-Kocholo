        "text": "The fifth annual Fate Awards, in association with Diet Coke, and the biggest bash in Northern Ireland ahead of the MTV Awards, will see the largest turnout of UK and homegrown celebrities, from the worlds of music, entertainment, politics, reality and some of the highest rated television shows, recognise the crème de la crème of Northern Ireland’s entertainment and hospitality industry.\n\nOn 15th April, host Patrick Kielty will be joined on stage in the Europa Hotel by ‘Celebrity Big Brother’ winners Chantelle Houghton and, soon to be Katie Price’s ex husband, Alex Reid together with former politician and ‘Strictly Come Dancing’ contestant, Ann Widdecombe; ‘Eastenders’ and ‘Gavin and Stacey’s’ actor Larry Lamb and the one and only Shane MacGowan from The Pogues.\n\n‘X Factor’ hopeful Katie Waissel and mentor Sinitta will be there, while ‘voice’ of the ‘X Factor’ Peter Dickson, will announce the winners throughout the evening. More than 17 million people watched Katie’s first ‘X Factor’ performance so she is sure to have some keen interest when she glides along the red carpet.\n\nOur very own, former Miss Northern Ireland, Zoe Salmon, will add some glamour to the evening and she will be battling it out with host Patrick Kielty, Cool FM’s Pete Snodden, TV Presenters Christine Bleakley and Julian Simmons, for the title of ‘Media Personality’ which was won last year by Gerard McCarthy and who will be on hand to pass it over to this year’s winner.\n\n‘Starman’ Andrew Stone, who was catapulted to fame in the smash hit series ‘Pineapple Dance Studios’, will make his first Fate Awards appearance with music entrepreneur Rob Davies, who also featured in the hit show.\n\nNutritionist Gillian McKeith will be hoping there are no witchetty grubs on the menu, following her appearance on ‘I’m A Celebrity’, watched by more than 10 million people; and ‘Benidorm’s’ Madge (Sheila Reid) will be ditching her mobility scooter to walk the red carpet with Fate Awards stalwart Gail Porter.\n\nLongest serving loose woman Carol McGiffin will be enjoying some lighthearted banter with Northern Ireland comedic genius Roy Walker although Harry Derbidge, known as the ‘catchphrase king’ from ITV2’s ‘The Only Way is Essex’ may give Roy a run for his money, while Harry’s co-star, glamour puss Sam Faiers, dazzles on the red carpet.\n\nLocal boy Aaron McCusker, Jamie Maguire from Channel 4’s ‘Shameless’, will be joined by Danny Miller from the Dales – Aaron Livesy of ‘Emmerdale’.\n\nMichael Mervyn-Jones, Publisher of Fate Magazines, said; “I really can’t wait until this year’s Fate Awards. The excitement is building for the sold out event and we’ll be celebrating the fifth year of the Fates this year with the largest turnout of celebrities we’ve ever welcomed to Northern Ireland.\n\n“We are really looking forward to welcoming Patrick onto the stage to host the evening as it will be an opportunity for us to applaud the initiative and risk that those in the industry have taken in these challenging financial times.\n\n“I’m thrilled that we have managed to attract some of the biggest names in TV right now and I guess it shows how the awards have grown over the years. Some attending are Fate Awards stalwarts and some are Fate Awards virgins. The atmosphere will no doubt reach fever pitch as the winners receive their awards from some of the country’s top celebrities on 15th April.\n\n“I am very excited at the prospect of this year’s celebrations and with the Europa Hotel completely transformed, we’ll celebrate those who have worked so hard to contribute to Northern Ireland’s thriving entertainment and hospitality industry.”\n\nThis year sees the addition of a brand new category – the Best Restaurant Critics Choice together with: Best Classic Bar, Best Style Bar, Best Gastro Pub, Best Front of House, Best Chef, Best Restaurant, Best Regional Bar, Best Regional Restaurant, Best Club, Best Regional Club, Best Club DJ, Best Gay Venue, Jim Aiken Live Venue, Colin Angus Best Media Personality, Best Hotel and Best Newcomer.\n\nLast year’s winners were Best Classic Bar – Laverys, Belfast; Best Style Bar – McCrackens Cafe Bar, Belfast; Best Cocktail Bar – The Merchant Hotel, Belfast; Best Gastro Pub – The John Hewitt, Belfast; Best Regional Bar – Grace Neills, Donaghadee; Best Restaurant – No 27, Talbot Street, Belfast; Best Regional Restaurant – The Plough, Hillsborough; Best Club – Rain, Belfast; Best Regional Club – Sallys, Omagh; Jim Aiken Live Venue – The Belfast Empire Music Hall, Belfast; Best Hotel – Ten Square, Belfast; Best Front of House – Andy Carson, Bar Retro, Hillsborough; Best Chef – Danny Millar, Balloo House, Killinchy; Best Gay Friendly Venue – Kremlin, Belfast; Best Newcomer – Slide, Belfast; Best DJ – Stevie Simpson; Colin Angus Media Personality of the Year – Gerard McCarthy; Legend Award – Eamonn Holmes; Club of the Decade – Thompsons, Belfast; Restaurant of the Decade – Deanes, Belfast; Bar of the Decade – Apartment, Belfast; Best Overall Venue – Café Vaudeville, Belfast.\n\nThe Fate Awards in association with Diet Coke, will be held on Friday 15 April 2011 in Belfast’s Europa Hotel and is proudly supported by Becks Vier, BMI, Bacardi Brown-Forman, Victoria Square, Sunday Life and Hospitality Review.
