        "text": "When memberships in NYSTRS cease we make every effort to contact these individuals and encourage them to withdraw contributions they made to the System. If contributions are not withdrawn, we add their names to a list of Unclaimed Accounts. If the contributions remain unclaimed for 18 months, they are considered abandoned. Whether unclaimed or abandoned, such funds may be claimed at any time by the former member or their beneficiary or estate.\n\nHelp us find former members with unclaimed funds. Search both the list of Abandoned Accounts below and the list of Unclaimed Funds. You may scroll the alphabetical lists or search by entering a name or school district."
