        "text": "It was the sauciest Dancing on Ice outfit ever.\n\nLast week former Blue Peter girl Zoe Salmon stunned viewers when she took to the rink in a costume which – on our TV screens – made her look naked apart from a few strategically placed sequins. And Zoe, 29, loved every minute of it.\n\nShe laughs: “It’s weird to think millions of people thought I was in the nude. I thought it looked cute and very girly.\n\n“When I watched the show back, I saw what everyone meant. But that flesh-coloured suit was actually really thick material, like lycra.\n\n“I felt really sucked in and held in. In fact, on Blue Peter they had me in bikinis a lot, so I actually feel more covered up on Dancing On Ice.”\n\nBut Zoe does have plans to reveal a lot more of herself – and break free from her prim and proper image for good by stripping off for a sexy photoshoot.\n\nShe says: “You can expect to see something soon. It won’t be tacky – there is definitely a way of doing lads’ mags that isn’t glamour modelling.”\n\nAfter all, following nine weeks of the ITV ice dance competition, Belfast-born Zoe is at her fighting weight.\n\n“All us dancers are a lot more toned up and we feel a lot sexier. At least with my new bod I’ll need less airbrushing!\n\n“I don’t really notice the change any more. I eat twice as much. I think it’s because the routines are getting more stressful and it’s like ‘give me more chocolate’.”\n\n<p>Since Dancing on Ice started, the 1999 Miss Northern Ireland’s tousled blonde hair and perfect size 8 frame have attracted a more adult fanbase than that of her Blue Peter days.</p> <p>“I don’t see myself as the blonde bombshell. I’m more girly than sexy. But if that’s what people think, that’s a compliment,” she says. Former Dancing on Ice contestant Melinda Messenger has said the relentless exercise had seen her shed pounds and reinvigorate her sex life.</p> <p>But Zoe, who has been linked to Hollyoaks hunk Gerard McCarthy, is more coy about her love life.</p> <p>“I’m just a single girl living in London, dating people and having a good time. I don’t really talk about the guys I date because a lot of them are in the public eye.</p> <p>“If I had a ring on my finger and I was married I would be singing it from the rooftops. But I don’t.”</p> <p>In fact Zoe insists the main man in her life is skate partner Matt Evers.</p> <p>“I really do live in an ice bubble. I am with Matt all the time – I take him everywhere I go. It’s like we are inseparable. He’s not my boyfriend – but he’s the guy I spend most time with. I even spent Valentine’s Day with him. He is so cute – he actually made me a card and bought me chocolates and wine. Matt’s the main man in my life now.”</p> <p>And she’s certainly a good catch. Far from being a “dumb blonde” (her words), Zoe is a qualified lawyer.</p> <p>She says: “People just assume because of the way I look I’m stupid. It’s easy for people to see the blonde hair and the make-up and think, ‘what a bimbo’.</p> <p>“That is sad. Hopefully when people know me they know it’s not true. In fact I’m actually very academic. I only ever got one grade C in my life. If I didn’t get an A it wasn’t good enough.”</p> <p>But for now, the only briefs she’s concentrating on are the sparkly ones she wears for the show. This week she knows she has to put in an extraordinary performance if she is to avoid the dreaded skate-off. Last week the judges decided to save her over Emmerdale babe Roxanne Pallett when both were put through to the elimination round.</p> <p>She has to fight off hot competition from those still remaining, including singer Jessica Taylor and X Factor finalist Ray Quinn.</p> <p>Zoe says: “I’m thrilled and delighted the judges saved me. I’m not the best skater but I’m not ready to go yet. I want the audience to fall in love with me. At the end of the day, if they love you, you get more public votes. It’s really important I entertain the audience.” And from the sound of things, her costume for tonight’s show is certainly going to be entertaining.</p> <p>“I’m like a kid in the candy store when I see all the costumes. They are still making my next one and I can tell you it’s beautiful. It is going to wow people – I want to blow people over.”</p> <p>And the routine sounds like a showstopper too. “It’s the most difficult and dangerous routine I’ve done yet by miles – to the point where I don’t even know if I can do it. I’m actually close to tears and freaked out about it.</p> <p>“I don’t go out there thinking ‘I’m amazing, I can do this’. I go out thinking ‘I’ve rehearsed for the past five days and I’m going to do the best I can and try not to make big mistakes’.”</p> <p>Like rival Coleen Noleen, who injured her wrist in a bad fall – Zoe has had her fair share of injuries.</p> <p>“I’ve got bruises everywhere. My knee is all bandaged up and it’s got like this big pad on the front. I just keep falling on it, it’s permanently swollen. I pulled a rib a few weeks ago and that was just agonising.”</p> <p>She added: “It’s almost nice when you get a new injury because it takes your mind off the old ones!”</p> <p>But Zoe’s used to hard graft: in the past year alone she has run a marathon, skied, wing-walked, walked on hot coals and driven a Formula 1 car and a monster truck.</p> <p>Whatever the outcome of the show, Zoe has won a legion of new fans – and she’s desperately hoping to become popular across the pond as well as here. She admits: “My heart’s in LA.</p> <p>“I want to do light entertainment. I think they need a Northern Irish girl like me there!”</p> <p><em>Dancing On Ice is on ITV tonight at 7.10pm &amp; 9.15pm</em></p> <p><em>features@sundaymirror.co.uk</em></p>"
