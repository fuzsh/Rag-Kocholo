        "text": "Zoe Salmon loves to talk. The Dancing on Ice star lives up to her reputation as a chatterbox the moment she breezes into Belfast's Radisson hotel. Her partner on the show, Matt Evers, may have teased her for talking too much during training, but Co Down-born Zoe is an interviewer's dream.\n\nAfter warm greetings, she immediately starts chatting 19-to-the-dozen. There are no awkward silences nor any one-word answers... in fact, it's hard to get a question in edgeways.\n\nDespite being on the go since dawn, she looks stunning — whippet thin (but not scarily so) and not a hair out of place.\n\nHer only gripe is that she's hungry. Back-to-back radio interviews haven't allowed any time for breakfast and she's craving an Ulster Fry — plus muesli, fruit, muffins...\n\n“I'm actually a bit embarrassed about the amount I eat,” she laughs. “It's an enormous amount. I recently did an interview with a reporter and they went through what I ate in a day and my intake was more than 4,000 calories!\n\n“Some people might say it's because I'm training every day, but I think it's just me. And I really haven't had any breakfast.”\n\nZoe is on a flying visit home to publicise Torvill & Dean's Dancing on Ice: The Bolero 25th Anniversary Tour, which comes to Belfast’s Odyssey Arena next month.\n\nReplicating the formula of the hit TV show, audiences at each venue on the tour will be able to text vote for their favourite couple. Those votes will then be added to the scores from the judges to decide that night's winner.\n\nAs well as Zoe and Matt, Todd Carty, Jessica Taylor and Ray Quinn will all take part, plus champions and contestants from previous series including Suzanne Shaw and Chris Fountain. And of course, Torvill & Dean will also be performing.\n\nZoe is probably best-known for her four-year stint on BBC1 children's programme Blue Peter, where she quickly became famous as the show's daredevil, walking over hot coals, jumping out of planes, wing-walking and performing numerous other stunts devised by the production team.\n\nBut of all the dangerous things that she has done in the past, nothing compares to Dancing on Ice and she's still in pain from the many injuries she suffered.\n\n“They're still ongoing,” reveals Zoe. “I fell four times yesterday — twice on my elbow. And I tripped over Christopher Dean at one point.\n\n“Even after doing it for months, you can still fall. Even the professionals do. It's a very tough sport.\n\n“My knee injury is still really bad. If I'm on a plane or sitting in a car, it gets really sore. I can't have it bent for too long.”\n\nShe's not at all bitter about losing out to Jessica Taylor in the quarter final skate-off, even though Coleen Nolan, a far less able contestant sailed through.\n\n“It's not always about the most talented person,” she says. “Yes, Ray won and he was the most talented, but as for going through from one week to the next, it's about other things — popularity etc, so it really didn't bother me.\n\n“Without the support from people from Northern Ireland I wouldn't have got as far as I did and I'd like to say a massive thank you to everyone for voting for me. I'm really grateful and the support of everyone back home really kept me going.”\n\nBecoming an ice skating star is just one of the 29-year-old's achievements. After growing up in Bangor, Zoe studied law at Queen's University, Belfast during the late Nineties, gaining a degree and postgraduate diploma.\n\nStudent life was interrupted in 1999 when she won the Miss Northern Ireland title and took a year out to perform engagements and do some modelling.\n\nAfter Queen's, Zoe was preparing to start work as a high-flying lawyer, when she spotted a discreet ‘TV Presenter Wanted' advert (there were no clues about its origins) in the Belfast Telegraph and thought, ‘why not?'\n\nAnd so followed four “wonderful” years, which gave her the opportunity to travel the world, meet politicians and movie stars and perform those daredevil stunts.\n\nSince leaving the show last June, she's fronted children's TV show Hot Rods, reality TV competition Design Academy, presented Northern Ireland's Children in Need and now, Dancing on Ice. Plus this month, she's gracing the cover of top lads mag, FHM.\n\nIs she now trying to create a more adult image after years as a kiddies' presenter?\n\n“Not at all,” she insists. “I modelled for six years before I got the Blue Peter job and I've done lingerie shots in the past, but I didn't think it was appropriate to do something like that when you're presenting a children's show, so although I had lots of offers, I always refused.\n\n“But I've just spent the past few months wearing next-to-nothing on the ice, so why not?\n\n“I agreed to do the shoot on condition that\n\nI could be true to myself. The outfits were very carefully chosen and although I wanted it to be sexy, anything along the lines of Page 3 would have been a no-no. That's not for me.\n\n“If it had been something that I would have been ashamed for my parents to see, I wouldn't have done it. I'm actually a bit of a prude at heart. I wouldn't even sunbathe topless in the privacy of my own garden.”\n\nZoe is just one of a growing group of Irish telly talent making it big in the UK. Have they formed a little power network in London?\n\n“Yes, we are invading the world,” she laughs. \"There's Patrick [Kielty], Colin Murray, Christine Bleakley and of course Eamonn [Holmes]... I should start a Facebook page for Irish TV presenters living in London!\n\n“Eamonn in particular has been really supportive of me and is always sending me wee texts.\n\n“And we all occasionally bump into one another — usually at airports — the last time I saw Patrick was at an airport.”\n\nNow based in London, Zoe insists that she doesn't lead a celebrity lifestyle and gets back to Ireland as often as she can. Her best friend is the same one she had when she was four.\n\n“Don't get me wrong, I love getting dressed up and going out to a nice do, but it's only every so often. Most nights I'm at home in my jammies with a pizza and a tub of Ben & Jerry's,” she laughs.\n\nAs for the future, she has a number of things in the pipeline, but there's a recent vacancy that has caught her eye and which she says would be her dream job.\n\n“I would love Fern Britton's job on This Morning,” she says. “That would be amazing, a dream come true. As soon as I finish Dancing on Ice, it's back to London and back to work. I'm in talks about a number of things, but I'm one of those people who don't like to talk about something unless it's definite.”\n\nAnd what about romance? It's an open secret that Zoe is dating Belfast actor Gerard McCarthy (who plays Kris in C4 soap, Hollyoaks) and most weeks he was in the Dancing on Ice audience cheering her on.\n\n“Yes, he came down to support me quite a lot,” she smiles, knowing where the conversation is going.\n\nThe couple have always kept their relationship strictly private and Zoe just shakes her head and giggles at my attempts to elicit more information.\n\nThere follows some friendly teasing, but I get nowhere — she just creases up with laughter, refusing to say another word.\n\nAnd so, probably for the first time ever, chatterbox Zoe Salmon has absolutely nothing to say — but her happy smile tells me all I need to know."
