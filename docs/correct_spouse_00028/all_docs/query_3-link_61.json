I used to love coming to the city, it was always the best place for busking.\n\n“It’s changed a lot. I’ve been looking at Liverpool One, thinking it would be a great place to busk.”\n\nThe night also featured a fashion sequence, with models wearing outfits by Liverpool designer Philip Armstrong.\n\nLIPA students, singer Alex Gardner and new girl group Girls Can’t Catch also took to the stage on the night.\n\nThe night started with a champagne reception followed by a three course meal and the awards ceremony.\n\nWinners on the night included the ECHO arena, which won the after dark award, while Alma de Cuba was named best bar and also best restaurant and Malmaison won best hotel.\n\nCelebrity favourite Cricket won the boutique prize and Anfield-born designer Kirsty Doyle picked up the business enterprise award.\n\nLiverpool One received the Liverpool Lifestyle award and Liverpool Food and Drink Festival won the culture award.\n\nRuncorn’s Nicola Roberts, who was staying in the city this week, had recorded a video message and said she was “honoured” radio listeners had voted her as the city’s stylish Scouser.\n\nLFC star Steven Gerrard retained his title of most stylish sporting star and even beat off competition from Sir Paul McCartney to win the icon award.\n\nBoy band Take That won Juice FM’s UK music award.\n\nTopshop, which opened its second largest store in Liverpool earlier this year, won the fashionista award, while River Island received the retail award.\n\nCars waited outside the Hilton in Liverpool city centre to take guests across the road to Portico at the Albert Dock for the after party. The Albert Dock won the visitor award.\n\nJuice breakfast presenter Adam Weighell, who hosted the event, said: “This was our third annual Style Awards.\n\n“So much has changed in the city over the past 12 months so we were looking forward to celebrating Liverpool’s stylish and vibrant culture with those that have been part of that reinvention of the city”."
