Hollyoaks star Gerard McCarthy set tongues wagging at the British Soap Awards last week after being seen spotted hand-in-hand with a look-a-like of his ex Zoe Salmon.

The 29-year-old actor, who plays Kris Fisher in the show, emerged from a nearby hotel holding hands with an unknown model and the paparazzi presumed he'd reunited with his ex-girlfriend, Dancing On Ice star Salmon.

Last year, McCarthy and Salmon mutually agreed to end their two-year relationship after her stint on ITV1's skating reality programme.

At the time he said: "I suppose it's just one of those things, but there are plenty more salmon in the sea!"

A source close to the actor told Digital Spy: "Gerard still isn't over Zoe and he misses her loads. They had so much in common and were really good together.

"It was a bit weird for him last week at the ceremony as everyone thought, at a glance, the girl he was with was actually Zoe," they continued. "The blonde model, though, was just a friend."
