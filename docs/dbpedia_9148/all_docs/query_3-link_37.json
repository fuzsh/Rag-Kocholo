        "text": "Also in 2018, Mollie was the youngest person to be inducted into the International Polka Hall of Fame and she had a US Flag flown in her honor by the US Air Force in a mission in the Middle East.\n\nIn 2020, like many, Mollie and Ted had to pivot due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Mollie and Ted began their YouTube channel, with weekly Tuesday night performances, and gained over 20,000 subscribers and over six million views.\n\nIn fall of 2021, Mollie received the Sperati Award from Luther College. An award presented to one alumni musician receives this award each year for their excellence in instrumental music. And in 2022, Mollie was inducted into the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame.\n\n​\n\nIn 2024, Mollie created her \"Mollie B & Friends\" band as SqueezeBox took a break from road gigs. The band performed in Arizona, Iowa, Minnesota, Helen, and Wisconsin.\n\n​\n\nMollie’s talents have also been showcased in front of a live audience during The Mollie B Christmas Shows both at RFD-TV the Theatre and the Jim Stafford Theatre in Branson, Missouri, in 2011-2014, and 2016. Since 2017, Mollie performs the holiday special at the CAL Center in Reedsburg, Wisconsin. Mollie has performed, directed, wrote, produced, choreographed, and hosted these two+-hour live performances. Mollie’s cast has featured up to 36 renowned musicians and artists in front of audiences up to 1300."
