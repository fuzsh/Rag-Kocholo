        "text": "The Beginning\n\nWith a legendary career spanning more than four decades, KANSAS has firmly established itself as one of America’s iconic of classic rock bands. This “garage band” from Topeka released their debut album in 1974 after being discovered by Wally Gold, who worked for Don Kirshner, and have gone on to sell more than 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nComposing a catalogue that includes fifteen studio albums and five live albums, KANSAS has produced eight gold albums, three sextuple-Platinum albums (Leftoverture, Point of Know Return, Best of KANSAS), one platinum live album (Two for the Show), and two one million-selling gold singles, Carry On Wayward Son and Dust in the Wind. KANSAS appeared on the Billboard charts for over 200 weeks throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s and played to sold-out arenas and stadiums throughout North America, Europe and Japan. Carry On Wayward Son continues to be one of the top five most played songs on classic rock radio, and Dust In the Wind has been played on the radio more than three million times!\n\n1998-2004\n\nIn 1998, KANSAS released an orchestral album; Always Never the Same, recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra at Abbey Road Studios in London. They followed with an orchestral tour accompanied by top-caliber symphony orchestras.\n\nIn 2000 KANSAS went back into the studio with original band member and songwriter Kerry Livgren to produce Somewhere to Elsewhere, the first album featuring all 6 of the original players in 20 years! The ten new songs were written by Kerry Livgren and recorded in his studio in Topeka, KS. Players included: Phil Ehart, Billy Greer, Dave Hope, Kerry Livgren, Robby Steinhardt, Steve Walsh and Richard Williams.\n\nIn 2002, KANSAS released a state-of-the-art DVD using the latest technology in film, audio and visual design, entitled Device-Voice-Drum and was the driving force behind the 2002/2003 tour.\n\nSony Music released a boxed set in 2004 titled Sail On which featured unique KANSAS cuts as well as vintage video footage on the DVD disc that was included.\n\n2006-2009\n\nIn 2006, KANSAS released the two-disc (one CD/one DVD) anthology Works In Progress. Material was taken from a decade’s worth of studio, live albums and home videos; 1992’s Live At The Whisky, 1995’s Freaks Of Nature, 1998’s Always Never The Same and 2002’s Device Voice Drum.\n\nIn 2009, in their hometown of Topeka, KANSAS celebrated their 35th Anniversary with a symphonic concert, accompanied by the Washburn University Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Larry Baird. The DVD release There’s Know Place Like Home captured this unique live performance and featured special guests Kerry Livgren & Steve Morse with spectacular lighting and high-resolution clarity. Available on both DVD and Blu-Ray, There’s Know Place Like Home includes favorites such as Dust In The Wind, Carry On Wayward Son and Point of Know Return as well as a sampling from each album in their discography, with a special symphonic touch.\n\nToday\n\nCoinciding with the celebration of their 40th anniversary in 2015, KANSAS was inducted into both the Kansas Hall of Fame and the Georgia Music Hall of Fame as recognition for their achievements from both their native state and adopted home state.\n\n2016 marked the release of “The Prelude Implicit,” KANSAS’s fifteenth studio album. The wide-ranging progressive rock album was released on InsideOut Music, and marked the band’s first studio album release in 16 years.\n\nThe summer of 2020 marked the release of “The Absence of Presence,” KANSAS’s sixteenth studio album, which debuted at #10 on Billboard’s Top Current Albums chart. The wide-ranging progressive rock album, released by InsideOut Music, follows-up 2016’s “The Prelude Implicit,” which debuted at #14 on Billboard’s Top 200 Albums chart.\n\nThroughout 2016-2022, the band celebrated the anniversaries of multi-Platinum breakout albums “Leftoverture” and “Point of Know Return” with anniversary tours for both albums. Both tours were commemorated with live album releases “Leftoverture Live & Beyond” (2017) & “Point of Know Return Live & Beyond” (2021).\n\nThe band is currently comprised of original drummer Phil Ehart, bassist/vocalist Billy Greer, vocalist/keyboardist Ronnie Platt, keyboardist/vocalist Tom Brislin, violinist/guitarist Joe Deninzon, and original guitarist Richard Williams. With no signs of slowing down, KANSAS continues to perform in front of large and enthusiastic audiences.\n\nAlong with constant touring, KANSAS continues to remain a fixture of Classic Rock radio and popular culture. The band continues to reach a whole new audience through their unmistakable presence in various commercials, live sports broadcasts, popular video games Rock Band, Guitar Hero, and Grand Theft Auto; the band’s documentary film “KANSAS: Miracles Out of Nowhere,” and a guest appearance on The CW’s television show ‘Walker.’ The band’s songs have also been included in various television shows such as ‘Supernatural,’ ‘Reacher,’ ‘All Elite Wrestling,’ ‘South Park,’ ‘The Office,’ and ‘The Simpsons;’ as well as blockbuster films including ‘Old School,’ ‘The Suicide Squad,’ ‘Anchorman,’ ‘Pitch Perfect,’ and ‘Happy Gilmore.’"
