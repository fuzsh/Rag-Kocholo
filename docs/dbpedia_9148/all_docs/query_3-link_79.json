        "text": "A new festival called Worlds Away, featuring Tiesto, the Chainsmokers, Lauv and others, will take place on Oct. 12 at the historic Monterey County Fairgrounds, home of the legendary Monterey Pop Festival of 1967, event producers Pendulum have announced. Other performers include R3HAB, Sam Feldt, Lost Kings and Ayokay, with more to be announced.\n\nAccording to the announcement, the inaugural festival “is more than just an event; it is a movement that celebrates the enduring power of art to transcend boundaries, and connect people from all walks of life, paying homage to Monterey’s rich cultural legacy while paving the way for the future of festivals. The inaugural event will transport ‘travelers’ (Worlds Away attendees) to an entirely different world, using cutting-edge technological innovation, never seen immersive art installations, spectacular light shows, and performances from an incredible lineup of multi-platinum and Grammy award-winning music acts.”\n\nGeneral tickets will go on-sale beginning Aug. 16, and a pre-sale will be available Aug. 14.\n\n“This is not just a music festival. Worlds Away will be an immersive, augmented experience,” explained festival founder Ro Sahebi. “Today, festivals are focused on getting bigger and bigger. We are focused on creating something much more intimate and engaging. And what better place than the place where it all started.” Sahebi continued, “this first event is just a taste of what we have planned for the future. We have some very serious sponsors and partners that have committed to building this out over the next few years in multiple locations.”\n\nThose who purchase a GA ticket will be granted access to the festival as well as all activations. GA+ purchasers will receive the same access along with a one-of-a-kind merch package in addition. VIP guests will have additional access to an exclusive VIP lounge and viewing area to all performances. A special Pendulum VIP package will also be available for purchase that will include an exclusive sneak peak of the venue as well as a special guest performance on Oct. 11, the evening before the official festivities begin. This package will also include full access to the artist lounge, an exclusive festival after party invitation, and personal concierge service during the festival to assist with dinner reservations, festival questions and more."
