        "text": "REBECCA ST JAMES recently took part in an international online chat on the internet where she fielded dozens of questions from fans around the world. Here are the highlights.\n\nHi Rebecca! Do you play any instruments?\n\nI learned the piano in high school in primary school. I used to play the harmonica in concert, but I can't officially say that I really play either. I did play guitar on the song \"A Cold Heart Turns\", on the 'God' album, but that's because I didn't use the fret board! I just strummed the strings.\n\nWhat did you and your family do while you were on a sabbatical?\n\nMy family worked as usual, although it was a little slower in our management office (my dad is my manager). I went to Australia for two months and went on a cycling trip and visited the outback. I also went on a houseboat here in the States, and had an awesome time.\n\nDo you feel that a sabbatical is more or less refreshing than just a few days off?\n\nA few days off just allows me to have enough energy to just keep going - a sabbatical is more of a renewal. A renewal of the mind, body, spirit. It's something that pastors and people in ministry do regularly, and something I wish I had done more.\n\nWhat CD is in your CD player right now?\n\nI'm in the studio today recording a musical, so for the last 24 hours I've been listening to the songs I've been learning for today. The musical is called 'Hero'. It will probably go on tour next year. I am Mary Magdalene in the musical. It's really the story of Jesus.\n\nWhen do you have your quiet time with God every day?\n\nI mostly try to have it at the beginning of the day. I feel like it turns my perspective off myself, and on to God. But, if I have something first thing in the morning, I might read something out of my devotional, and then have a more extended prayer time later in the day. I love spending my quiet times outside. I have a trampoline in the back yard, and I love to go out there and have my quiet time, and enjoy God's creation and have him speak to me there.\n\nIs it hard to be a role model for so many Christian teens?\n\nMost of the time I don't find it to be a pressure at all, because I've always been a big sister to six siblings, so I've always felt a sense of responsibility. Every now and then I have to be called to account for my actions more than other people, because people can take one tiny action and blow it out of proportion, so I have to be careful to be above reproach at all times. It is a bit of a strain sometimes.\n\nDo you get the chance to go back to the church you grew up in and visit your youth group?\n\nActually, just this last week I was in Australia and I got to go back to the church where I became a Christian, which was awesome. I was recording a DVD down there, and shared my testimony in front of that church. It was really cool."
