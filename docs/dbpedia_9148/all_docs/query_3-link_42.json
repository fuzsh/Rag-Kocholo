        "text": "In the Music app on your Mac, create a playlist that contains the songs or files you want to burn to the disc.\n\nChoose View > as Songs and make sure the items you want to include have a checkmark beside them.\n\nIf checkboxes aren’t displayed to the left of the song titles, choose Music > Settings, click General, then make sure “Songs list checkboxes” is selected.\n\nInsert a blank disc.\n\nSelect the playlist, then choose File > Burn Playlist to Disc.\n\nIf Burn Playlist to Disc doesn’t appear in the File menu, the playlist you selected can’t be burned to a disc because it contains items with usage restrictions (for example, a song your computer isn’t authorized to play).\n\nSelect a disc format.\n\nIf you’re creating an audio CD, choose your options:\n\nChange the recording speed: Choose an option from the Preferred Speed pop-up menu.\n\nChange the amount of silence between songs: Select Gap Between Songs.\n\nSet all the songs on the disc to play at the same volume: Select Use Sound Check.\n\nInclude information that disc players in some vehicles can display: Select Include CD Text.\n\nClick Burn.\n\nIt might take several minutes to burn a disc. You can cancel the burn by clicking the Cancel button next to the progress bar, but if you’re using a CD-R or DVD-R disc, you won’t be able to use it again.\n\nIf the playlist contains more items than will fit on the disc, insert another disc to continue burning the remaining items.\n\nIf you’re creating an audio CD, only the last disc burned includes track information (song title, artist, and album). Songs on the other CDs are identified only by track number (for example, “Track 01,” “Track 02”). See If song information doesn’t appear in Music."
