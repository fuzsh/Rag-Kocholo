This has been on my mind for years, but wanted to finally ask it publicly.

As the thread title asks, do you ever wish you were born at a different time in history? I was born in 1986.

I ask this as as a car guy, I wish I was born in the 60's as I could have had a Fox Body Mustang in the 80's, and then a Japanese sports car in the 90's (3000GT, the early Eclipses, Toyota MR2, 300ZX, or hell even a 90's NSX (still my dream car, though realistically not even an option in the 90's as it was/is a Supercar).

As a tech guy, I wish I was born in the 70's, as I would have been an adult with disposable income in the 90's, and I would have been a proud early adopter of the Internet, DVD, 3D Accelerator cards (3DFX, S3, Matrix, etc. My god there were so many GPU vendors back then), the 3DO, Jaguar, Saturn, and PSX for console gaming.

Throw in being in my early 20's in the 90's as well for "clubbing" when 90's dance music was (still is) the peak of it's genre.

But as a gamer and sports guy, I am still happy being born in 1986. Yes I missed the NES craze of the 80's, but got my MegaDrive for Christmas 1990, Super Famicom at Christmas 1991, and eventually went all in with gaming in 1998 with my N64, PSX, and eventually Saturn in 2000 due to the NBA lockout of 1998/1999. The industry I have pretty much devoted my entire life to has been dead to me for the last decade, but still proud of my 2900+ game collection, 50+ consoles, my massive magazine collection, books, merchandise, etc. It's all easily worth over $100k nowadays.

Anime as well as I had discovered Sailor Moon in June 1998.

As a sports guy, I still got to experience the NBA of the 90's, my beloved Magic on the rise, Iowa State growing under McCarney, Orr, Floyd, and Eustachy. I became an AZ Cardinals fan due to the 1998 playoff run, and it's only been in my lifetime they have been even remotely relevant since moving to AZ in 1988. Diamondbacks get established, and eventually win the 2001 World Series (and make it back this past season).

As a wrestling fan, I still live, breathe, and bleed for WCW, and became a wrestling fan on Monday, January 1, 1996. Little did I know that day what the next five years would bring to the entire industry until WCW closed down on March 26, 2001.

Anyway, just kind of a silly and "what if" question. Sorry for the long rant, but got caught up reminiscing.

As a car and tech guy, I think it would have been awesome being born much sooner, but for everything else, I feel like as I born when I was for a reason, and wouldn't have it any other way (well, maybe born a few years sooner so I could have experienced the NES craze (or even Master System as I am a huge Sega fanboy) of the 80's).

Also, I am still very much stuck in the 90's, and I am never leaving (well, minus broadband Internet, smartphones, and thin flat screen TVs).
