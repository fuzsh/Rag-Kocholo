        "text": "There are many medieval map makers , who have contributed a great deal in the field of map making. Some well known medieval map makers of the world are Hartmann Schedel, Johannes Ruysch and Piri Reis.\n\nHartmann Schedel was a German historian, humanist and physician who was also a skilled map maker. He used the printing press in cartography. The Nuremberg Chronicle produced by him was his most ambitious project in the world of maps. It includes a world map, quite a few city maps and a map representing central and northern Europe.\n\nJohannes Ruisch is another leading medieval map maker of the world. He created a map representing the entire world. It is the second oldest printed map depicting the New World. Johannes used Ptolemyâ€™s first projection to create this map.\n\nPiri Reis or Hadji Muhammad is another medieval map maker of global acclaim. His full name is Hadji Muhiddin Piri Ibn Hadji Mehmed. Piri Reis prepared a number of charts and maps, which have been compiled in a book called Kitab-i Bahrieh.\n\nThe names of some other renowned map makers of the medieval era are Fra Mauro, Johannes Werner, Philipp Apian, Willem Janszoon Blaeu and Peter Apian."
