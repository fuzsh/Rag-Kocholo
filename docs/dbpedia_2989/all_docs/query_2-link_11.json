        "text": "Almost all maps on the market today were produced since the invention of the printing press. Printing methods such as copper plate engraving, steel engraving or lithography were used. These hand-printing methods require the skilled hands of craftsmen. Only artists would use such time consuming methods for printing today. Therefore old maps are beautiful, decorative works of art that are suitable for framing. The best ones also contain significant historical information.\n\nWoodblock printing is an early form of print making that you will see in our Ptolemy maps published by Munster in 1542 and some of our antique sheet music- it features bold dark lines. Copperplate engraving was invented in the 16th century and became the dominant printmaking method for several centuries until steel plate engraving was invented in 1792. Copperplates are softer and easier for artists to work with, but wear out the more prints you make with them. Steel plate print making allows finer lines and more prints than copperplate and was used for reproducing paintings as prints and also for atlases and books- anything that required many prints to be made with the same plate. During the 1880's, they began using photography in the printing and coloring of maps. This was considered a great technological advance because they could print many more maps at far less cost making them affordable to everyone.\n\nMany early maps were left uncolored by their publishers and have been colored at a later date. It is often difficult or impossible to tell if coloring is original. When done well, later hand coloring enhances the appearance of old maps and prints and makes them more desirable to most people. By the 1800s it was common to color maps and atlases using hand coloring (often done with stencils by unskilled laborers) and by the late 1800s printed color was common. Collectors are beginning to take interest in maps printed in the early 1900s and many maps, particularly pictorial maps, have become highly desirable.\n\nMaps of Antiquity also carries prints of places, because they are a good adjunct to the maps. During the nineteenth century there were several periodicals such as Harper's Weekly and Ballou's Drawing Room Companion, which regularly published wonderful views of cities and towns.\n\nMost of our collection is now online, but we do have maps and charts that have not been added to our inventory yet. If you are looking for something particular, please feel free to contact us. Most of the time we have only one copy of a map. If you call to order a map that has been sold, we may have something that is similar to it.\n\nVISIT OUR BLOG FOR MORE ARTICLES AND INFORMATION ABOUT ANTIQUE MAPS, CHARTS, PRINTS, AND MORE!
