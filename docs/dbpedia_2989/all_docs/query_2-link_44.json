Fourth Impression TUB MAPEK i*n KHK COMPANY, YOItK, PA* Marie Georgette Raisz whose devotion and care made this book possible Preface to the Second Edition World-shaking events, have taken place since the original “General Car- tography” was published. The global war brought forth an interest in cartography unparalleled since the time of Columbus and Magellan. Soldiers were trained by the million in map reading, map making, and the use of airplane photographs. The public, confronted with geographical problems of all parts of the world, demanded maps, and maps were wanting. Our old types of maps and atlases failed to present the true nature, life, economics, and problems of the various parts of the world. In response to increased demands, a new school of cartography is developing with great promise for a renaissance of this art. In view of these changes, this book has been thoroughly revised. As we now look more to the future than to the past, the section on the history of cartog- raphy has been shortened. Global problems brought new interest to map projections, which are discussed in more detail. The greatest changes, how- ever, are in the second part of the book. The chapter on topographic and military maps has been enlarged, and an entirely new chapter has been added on the use of airplane photography in mapping. Airplane photoreading has also been treated in a separate chapter. A chapter on surveying methods has been added at the demand of geography students. With all these changes the book was enlarged by more than one third of its former length, and the number of illustrations is half again as many as before. The large double- column size helps the readability of the book. The author received much assistance in the preparation of this edition. Part of the chapter on geographic names was written by Dr. Meredith F. Burrill; the rotation method for oblique projections is quoted from Richard E. Harrison; the chapter on airplane photography was read and corrected by Major Edward S. Wood, Jr.; much of the medieval history of maps is the work of Dr. Dana Durand. All the laborious work of inserting, proofreading, indexing, etc. was done by Mrs. Donald M. Smith. Various government agencies, too numerous to mention here, were most helpful in supplying data for the new chapters. Although the book was originally designed for use as a college text, it also proved to be of interest to a large circle of readers among the general public. The main purpose of this book is not so much to train topographic draftsmen in the technicalities of their profession as to help toward the deeper under- standing of the broader aspects of this complex art. The purpose is to train leaders rather than followers. Erwin Raisz Cambridge, Mass. May , 1948 vii Preface to the First Edition Maps constitute an important part of the equipment of modern civilization. Several million dollars 5 worth of maps are published every year in this country alone and their production gives a livelihood to thousands of persons. Maps are in the hands of school children and college students, railway passengers, motorists, and aviators. They are necessary to the statesman and the general, the historian and the economist, the teacher, the engineer, the merchant, and the salesman. The production of maps is bound to grow with the growth of the population and its interest and activities; yet, when we look for literature on the science and art of map making, we find that sur- prisingly little has been written. Especially is this true of the United States. Most of the American books, such as those of Reed, Finch, Stuart, Deetz, and Ridgway, are written from the point of view of the practical draftsman. There are a number of works on map projections; of special importance are the publications of the Coast and Geodetic Survey. We find also a few treatises on historical cartography. Finally, there are some excellent books for use in military schools. There is, however, no American book which collects the scattered material in a manner satisfactory to the student of geography in our colleges. The cartographic literature of Great Britain is rather more copious. The works of Reed, Hinks, Winterbotham, Debenham, and some others are very good. Much has been written for students in military schools, to whom cartography is an important subject. Most of the books, however, include the subject of surveying, which, in the present writer’s opinion, can be better treated in separate works. More important is the cartographic literature of Germany. Several German universities offer excellent courses in cartography; and there are admirable textbooks by Zoppritz, Zondervan (Dutch), Geissler, and others. Max Eckert’s “Die Kartenwissenschaft,” in two large octavo volumes, is the most extensive treatise on the subject. The French, Spanish, Italian, Swedish, and Polish literature is important also, especially in the field of historical cartography. Clearly, there is room for additions to the literature on map making in the English language, particularly as addressed to an American public. The field of cartography is a wide one. Although it has definite contacts with such varied studies as history, mathematics, and art, it comprises within itself a well-rounded course, without trespassing upon other branches of geographical science and without taking in the special subject of surveying. Every department of geography in our institutions of higher learning should include a distinct course in cartography, and there should be a liter- IX X PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION ature on the subject adequate and appropriate to the needs of both teachers and students. To promote this aim is the chief purpose of the present work. The author is indebted to Profs. Vernor C. Finch, George B. Cressey, and Derwent S. Whittlesey for encouragement and professional advice in the preparation of this book. He is also grateful to Dr. Hamilton Rice, Director of the Institute of Geographical Exploration, Harvard University, who gave a generous allowance of time and advice to the author. Norman S. Burdett, E. A. Ackerman, Mrs. Margaret Curtis, and Elmer Harp, Jr., read parts of the manuscript and made many valuable suggestions. Chapter IB, which deals with the important topographical surveys of the world, was checked by Ena Yonge of the American Geographical Society; titles and quotations were also checked with the help of the extensive card catalogue of the American Geographical Society. Clara Egli of the Library of Congress made many important corrections in Chap. 4, dealing with the history of American cartography. Mrs. Grace Smith, Dr. Mary Catherine Welborn, and Anne Moran helped not only with typing but also with the phrasing of the manu- script. Walter G. Webster inked in many of the author’s sketches. The author wants to express his gratitude to publishers and periodicals that gave permis- sion to use their illustrations; their names are included in the legends to the illustrations.

James, “man may know very exactly the nature of the fabric near by, but the general design is beyond his range of vision. In order to reduce the larger patterns of the face of the earth to such proportions that they can be comprehended in a single view, the geographer makes use of a map . 55 In these words he states the essen- tial problem of cartography, or the making of maps. Let us imagine that our ants have conceived a desire to know the general layout of the rug and that they have assigned some of their number the task of measuring the various patches exactly and have given some others the task of collecting these measurements and of drawing up the results so that they can be viewed as a whole. Examination of this drawing will reveal a pattern of which they were ignorant before, and no doubt some wise ants will propose various theories to account for the nature and final meaning of this pattern. How much easier and simpler is the problem of these ants in regard to the rug than is ours in regard to the earth on which we live ! A man is a million times smaller in comparison with the earth’s surface than is an ant compared with the largest of rugs, and the richest oriental carpet has a pattern much less complex than that of the earth. The process of revealing the earth’s pattern has three phases. The surveyor measures the land, the cartographer collects the measurements and renders them on a map, and the geographer interprets the facts thus displayed. Closely related to this process is the work of the geologist, whose study of the rock structures provides information that is essential to an understanding of the surface pattern. This book deals primarily with the work of the cartog- rapher — the maker of maps. The other phases, such as surveying and geog- raphy, have a rich literature of their own. Definition and Classification of Cartography . The purpose of cartography is to collect and analyze data and measurements of the various patterns of the earth and to represent them graphically on such a reduced scale that the elements of this pattern can be made clearly visible. For revealing the earth s pattern, the chief instrument of the cartographer is a map; however, other tools, such as relief models, globes, bird’s-eye views, cartograms, etc., are also legitimate subjects of a treatise on cartography. A map is, in its primary conception, a conventionalized picture of the earth’s pattern as seen from above, to which lettering is added for identifica- tion. The word “picture,” however, is used here in a wider sense. A map represents what is known about the earth rather than what can be seen from any altitude. Some maps are abstracted and conventionalized to such a degree that the original notion of a picture is hardly recognizable. In many xiii xiv INTRODUCTION special maps only a single aspect of the pattern is retained, as is the case in a rainfall map. Moreover, maps commonly exhibit many features that are in themselves not visible, such as political frontiers, lettering, parallels, merid- ians, etc. Nor is a map necessarily restricted to the earth’s surface, for we have maps of the sky, moon, etc., and also maps of subsurface geology. But in either case a large-scale horizontal pattern is shown reduced to smaller scale. In studying a map and in producing it, the following items should be considered: (1) the scale; (2) the system of projection, i.e., the framework of coordinates upon which the map is drawn; (3) the content of the map as expressed by symbols, for example, the symbols for roads, cities, mountains, and other features; (4) the lettering; (5) the title, border, and other elements of the make-up. Maps may be classified with reference to their scale and to their content, as follows: 1. General maps a. Topographic maps drawn on a large scale, and presenting general informa- tion b . Chorographic maps, representing large regions, countries, or continents on a small scale (Atlas maps belong to this class.) c. World maps 2. Special maps a. Political maps b. City maps c. Communications maps, showing railway lines, automobile routes, etc. d . Scientific maps of various sorts e. Economic and statistical maps j. Maps used in art, illustration, and advertising g. Charts used for navigation and flying h. Cadastral maps, drawn on a large scale to show land ownership Cartography — Science and Art . The cartographer is both a scientist and an artist. He must have a thorough knowledge of his subject and model, the Earth. In representing it in different ways he must omit more or less, accord- ing to the scale and purpose of his map. This means that he must have the ability to generalize intelligently and to make a correct selection of the essen- tial features to be shown. These features are represented by lines, patterns, and colors, the effective use of which requires more than knowledge of the subject — it requires artistic judgment. A Course in Cartography. What should be included in a college course in cartography, as distinguished from geography and the other sciences that provide the cartographer with his material? The purpose of such a course is to qualify the student to give a clear and correct graphic expression of his ideas. To do this well he must adhere to certain cartographic principles and tradi- tions, which can best be learned by a historical approach. The cartographic art is, of course, progressive, but it is also very conservative. Changes in the familiar picturing of the Earth are made step by step and with caution. INTRODUCTION xv The student should know the commonly used projections and be able to construct them. The mathematics of projection, however, will be of little practical value to him. The course should enable him to select his symbols intelligently, with special regard to the modern methods of representing relief. Laboratory exercises should teach him good composition, handling of tools, lettering, and fine drawing. If he wishes his work to be published, he should know the methods by which maps are reproduced. The preparation of the various special maps and of globes and models is the subject of more advanced study (usually in a second term). What other courses should a prospective cartographer take? Collecting data, analyzing them, and more or less predigesting them requires a thorough knowledge of geography. Without this knowledge he will not be a cartog- rapher but just a topographic draftsman. To represent the earth’s pattern skillfully, a cartographer should have some basic courses in fine arts, or at least in engineering drawing. Some knowledge of both plane and spherical trigonometry helps in understanding map projections. As cartography and surveying are closely related, a course in both plane and geodetic surveying is also recommended. Courses in geology, geomorphology, climatology, and oceanogaphy will round out the cartographer’s education. It is said that a cartographer is 50 per cent geographer, 30 per cent artist, 10 per cent mathe- matician, and 10 per cent everything else. There is no limit to the demands upon a cartographer’s knowledge. The author, in his practice, had to find out such diverse matters as the kind of sails the ships had in which Orellana descended the Amazon; the fact that the name Hamada el Hamra implies that its flat and rocky surface is red in color; and the elements and dimensions of an average airport. Erwin Raisz Note to Instructors. A set of laboratory exercises is suggested at the end of the book. In the beginning of the course, while the lectures are on the history of maps, the laboratory hours are best utilized in teaching lettering and the use of drawing instruments, to the study of which the first exercises are dedicated. BOOK ONE General Cartography PART ONE: THE HISTORY OF MAPS chapter i: Manuscript Maps The history of maps is older than history itself, if we think of history as beginning with written records. The making of maps antedates the art of writing. This can be inferred from the fact, attested by many travelers, that various primitive peoples who have by no means reached the stage of writing have developed the ability to draw maps. It is a common observation of explorers in all parts of the world that a native, when asked the way to a certain place, will take a stick and draw on the ground a sketch of the road, perhaps adding twigs or pebbles to mark locations. In- variably these will be true maps, i.e to scale as seen from above. Apparently map making is an inborn aptitude of mankind. Living as hunters and warriors, and having to move about a great deal, such peoples may often find a knowledge of directions and distances a life-or-death matter, and many of them have developed a certain system in making maps and charts. Islanders’ Sea Charts, Perhaps the most interesting of such primitive works are the charts made by the Marshall Islanders. These charts consist of shells attached to a framework made of the midribs of palm leaves. 1 Anthropologists were for a long time puzzled by these curious structures before they found them to be charts used in navigation. The straight network (see Fig. 1) represents the open sea; the curved lines show the wave front approaching islands; 1 Lyons, H., The Sailing Charts of the Marshall Islanders, Geog, Jour., Vol. 72, pp. 325-328, 1928. and the islands themselves are marked by shells. The use of these charts ceased about the middle of the last century, when they were supplanted by European charts, and the Fig. 1 Chart of the Marshall Islanders. The islands are represented by shells ; the framework is partly for support, partly to show the prevailing curvature of the wave fronts. ( Courtesy of Geog. Jour., 1928.) present islanders know very little about them. These charts illustrate the point that the products of primitive peoples are not necessarily simple, for their manner of representation is much more complex than that of modern charts. Eskimo Maps. Much has been written about the map-making ability of the Eskimos. Figure 2 shows a map of the Belcher Islands, drawn with pencil by a 3 4 THE HISTORY OF MAPS Hudson Bay Eskimo . 1 The work done by this unschooled man of nature, without any kind of surveying instruments, compares surprisingly well with our best hydrographic charts of the same region. This map is especially remarkable because the area that it represents comprises several thousand square miles. Similar maps covering even larger areas are described by Boas . 2 Fig. 2 Eskimo map of the Belcher Islands in Hudson Bay. The length of the archipelago is over 100 miles. (■ Modified from Geog . Rev., 1918.) Many travelers have found the Eskimo maps superior to those of the same regions made by white men. As to this we may quote from a letter written by the noted Arctic explorer, Vilhjalmur Stefansson: . . . These Eskimo maps are likely to be good if you interpret them rightly. Here are some of the points: They are more likely to have the right number of curves in a river and the right shape of the curves than the proper distance scale. They are most likely to emphasize the things that are of importance to themselves ; for instance, portages they have to cross are of more significance to them than mountains that stand to one side. . . . Primitive men are likely to confuse the time scale with the mileage scale— after a 10-day journey of say 6 hours each day, they are likely x Flaherty, R. J, The Belcher Islands, Geog. Rev., Vol. 5, p, 440, 1918. 2 Boas, F., The Central Eskimo, Bur. Ethnol., 6th Ann. Reft., 1884-1885, p. 6. to dot these camps at equal intervals, although, because of better going, they may have made twice the average distance one day and half the average another. Indian and Aztec Maps. The map- making skill of the American Indians is often praised, but in fact the Indian maps are crude affairs and do not equal those of the Eskimos. The maps prepared by the Aztecs are interesting and are available in great num- bers. Unlike the Eskimos, the Aztecs were more concerned with recording historic events than with details of topography. The marking of rivers, forests, fields, and temples is entirely naturalistic. Little figures on the villages represent their names. In general the maps are highly decorative. It would carry us too far to record the map-making activities of the various Asiatic and African peoples. The student is referred to B. F. Adler's 3 “Maps of Primitive Peoples .' 5 Fig. 3 Aztec map showing the wanderings of a tribe. Roads are often decorated with footprints. Note the canoe and paddle. We conclude this branch of the subject with the narrative of a traveler who arrived at the Ahaggar in the Sahara and asked the 3 Adler, B. F., “Maps of Primitive Peoples, 55 St. Petersburg, p. 350, 1910. Abstracted by H. de Hutorowicz in the Bull Am. Geog . Soc., Vol 43 pp. 669-679. MANUSCRIPT MAPS 5 old Tuareg chief the way to Timbuktu. The old chief did not say a word. He covered part of the ground before him with gravel to represent the “reg,” or great gravel flats of the Sahara. On this he piled small ridges of sand, representing the “sifs,” or elongated sand dunes of the desert. The stony plateaus he indicated by flat stones. Soon a relief model of the region was rising before the traveler’s eyes, perfect not only in direction and distance but also as to the nature of the country. No explanation was needed. Through the universal language of cartog- raphy the traveler learned his way better than by any number of words. Babylonian Maps. The oldest known map, now on exhibition in the Semidc Museum of Harvard University, was dis- covered in excavating the ruined city cf Ga Sur, about 200 miles north of Babylon. The excavators found there a baked clay tablet showing a river valley, which may be that of the Euphrates, with mountains indicated in fish-scale fashion on either side. The river flows through a three-lobed delta into a lake or sea. North, east, and west are indicated with inscribed circles, indicating that maps were aligned in the cardinal directions then as now. The tablet is so small that it can be held in the hollow of one’s hand. Though broken, it is remark- ably fresh-looking, and the clearness of the minute cuneiform characters would hardly suggest its venerable age of 4,500 years. There are in the British Museum many similar tablets, showing in a primitive way estates, towns, or even the whole of Baby- lonia. Their importance to us is not in any cartographic merit but in the evidence they give of the great antiquity of the map- making art. There is, however, a Babylonian con- tribution to cartography that is still pre- served : the division of the circle into degrees. These ancient peoples used a numerical system based on twelve, as ours is based on ten, and this duodecimal system of theirs is directly responsible for our division of the circle into 360 degrees, of each degree into 60 minutes, and of each minute into 60 seconds. The ancient Semitic culture culminated in the commercial activities of the Phoeni- cians of Tyre and Sidon and of that yet greater colony of Carthage.

That the Phoenicians, who drew much of their culture from Babylonia, developed maps to suit their needs seems highly probable. No Phoenician maps have survived, but it is probable that the chart made by Marinus of Tyre about a.d. 120, of which Ptolemy tells us, embodied the early Phoenician material. The influence of these early navigators upon Greek cartog- raphy was perhaps greater than we know. The Babylonian conception of the uni- verse figured a disk-shaped Earth floating 6 THE HISTORY OF MAPS in the ocean, with the vault of heaven arching above it, and the firmament over all. This notion was accepted by the Greeks and Romans, as well as by the Israelites, and through the Scriptures it was carried over to Christian Europe of the Middle Ages. Egyptian Land Surveys. The surveying of land undoubtedly began in the great organized empire of the Nile Valley and delta. The enormous expenditures of the Pharaohs and the priesthood were met principally by taxes on the land, payable usually in grain. For purposes of taxation the land was carefully measured and registered, and the boundaries marked. Ramses II (1333—1300 b.c.) initiated a systematic land survey of the empire. The results must have been recorded, and there is reason to believe that they were put down Fig. 5 Ancient Chinese map showing China as the Middle Kingdom and all other countries as small outlying islands. 1.

Centuries later the Greek scientist, Eratosthenes, made use of early Egyptian measurements. The few Egyptian maps that have sur- vived, such as the rough map of a Nubian gold mine (now in the Turin Museum), are of minor interest from the point of view of cartographic history. Early Chinese Maps. In cartography, as in many other things, the Chinese developed as independently of the Western peoples as if they had been inhabitants of another planet. Cartography was flourishing in China when it was at its lowest ebb in Europe during the Middle Ages. China had been mapped in detail before any Europeans visited that country. Since ancient times it has been one of the duties of each governor and prefect to prepare a complete geographic description of his lands and waters, usually accompanied by maps. There are old maps available in the archives of many cities. This rich material has been only superficially examined, and important discoveries are to be expected from future studies. t The earliest reference to a map in Chinese literature is from 227 b.c. Especially after the invention of paper (ca. a.d. 100) local maps were made in all parts of the empire. A correlation of many local maps was carried out fly Pei Hsiu, the real father of Chinese cartography, who lived from a.d. 224 to 273. It no longer exists, but the ac- companying text has survived. In this Pei Hsiu lays down certain principles of cartog- raphy, as follows: 1. Rectilinear divisions, a network by which to state relative locations 2. Orientation, to show correctly the direction from one place to another 3. Accurate indication of distances 4. Indication of higher and lower alti- tudes MANUSCRIPT MAPS 7 5. Attention to the right and left angles or bends of the roads Evidently Chinese map making had even at this early period attained a certain scientific standard. In the use of the network Pei Hsiu was ahead of the cartographers of the West. His network, however, is not comparable to our drawing of meridians and parallels, for the Chinese conceived the earth as a flat surface with China in the middle. In the period after Pei Hsiu, Chinese map makers gradually covered the entire terri- tory from Persia to Japan. Noteworthy is the wooden map of Hsieh Chuang (a.d. 421-466) which could be taken apart province by province — the ancestor of the jigsaw-puzzle map. The most important map maker of this later period is Chia T an (a.d. 730-805), who made a map about 30 feet square, covering more than the Asiatic continent. We may assume that the ideas of the Chinese were rather vague about the outlying regions; and it would be highly interesting to see their conception of the Western world. Unfortunately, this map did not survive either. There is, how- ever, a stone tablet in existence from the twelfth century, 1 which is interpreted as a portion of the map of Chia Tan. This stone slab shows with fair accuracy the north- eastern bend of the Hwang Ho and the Chinese walk Under the succeeding dynasties the use of maps became more and more widespread, Fig. 6 The oldest known Chinese map is a stone tablet engraved in a.d. 1137, probably based on Chia Tan’s map of 801. The map shows the Great Wall crossing the Yellow River. ( After Hosie.) and when the Jesuit fathers came to China in the sixteenth century they found enough material to produce an excellent atlas of the empire. From this time on, the maps of China were influenced by Western cartog- raphy, but even the present maps of some remote parts of China are based more on material inherited from the past than on actual instrumental surveys. Greeks The foundation of our present system of cartography was largely laid down by the ancient Greeks, who advanced it to a height not reached again until the sixteenth century. They recognized the spherical shape of the earth, with its poles, equator, and tropics; they developed our longitude- latitude system; they designed the first projections; and they calculated the size of the earth. Ionian Geographers. Most of what we know of Greek cartography has been trans- mitted to us through the writings of Herodotus and Strabo. There we learn about the early Ionian geographers: An- aximander of Miletus (611? — 547? b.c.), who made a map of the “whole circuit of the Earth, every sea and all rivers,” and Hecataeus (ca. 500 b.c.) of the same city, who improved the map of his countryman 1 Soothill, W.

Hecataeus regarded the earth as a flat disk, around which the waters of the oceans flow. The world known to the Greeks in the fifth century b.c. extended from the Indus River to the Atlantic Ocean, with more limited knowledge of the north and south. They had a vague idea about the Caspian Sea, in spite of their contacts with the Persian Empire. It would be highly inter- esting to find a contemporary map made in Persia; the well-organized empire of Cam- byses and Darius probably produced good maps. The geographers of the fifth and early fourth centuries b.c. taught that the oeku- mene — the habitable world — was more or less oblong in shape, twice as long from east to west as from north to south. Our terms “latitude” and “longitude” are survivals of this conception. In the early fourth century b.c. a new idea was introduced — the spherical form of the earth. Who the originator of the idea was we do not know. The attribution to Pythagoras or to Parmenides is now discredited. 1 The idea itself was derived not so much from astronomical observations as from philo- sophical considerations. The sphere is the most perfect of all forms; hence, the earth, the masterwork of the gods, must be a sphere. Later observations, however, cor- roborated this idea so well that about 350 b.c. Aristotle was able to formulate the six arguments to prove that the earth was actually a sphere. The obliquity of the earth’s axis was recognized and correctly measured. The conception of the equator, 1 Hejdel, W. A., “The Frame of the Ancient Greek Maps,’ 5 American Geographical Society, New York, 1937. 141 pp. poles, and tropics was established, and the earth was divided into hot, temperate, and frigid zones as we know them today. It is a high tribute to the faith of the ancient* Greeks in science that this theory of a spherical earth, so contrary to common sense, was accepted at so early a period. Practical geographical knowledge was ex- panded by the bold seamen of Greece. Particu- larly interesting is the voyage of Pytheas of Massilia (Marseilles). So far as we know he was the first Greek to reach Britain. There he heard of a land 6 days north where the three funda- mental elements, Water, Earth, and Air, lose their identity and merge into each other — a poetic description of the misty, icy coast of Norway. This land he called “Thule,” and for 1,500 years it appears as the Island of Thule on almost every map of the world. Eratosthenes. Eratosthenes of Cyrene (276-196 b.c.) was the head of the Library Fig. 7 Eratosthenes calculated the Earth’s size cor- rectly within 14 per cent. The map of the ockumcne is a reconstruction. 10 THE HISTORY OF MAPS of Alexandria, the highest institution of learning of that time. He undertook to measure the earth. As the tradition goes, there was a well in Syene (Aswan), to the bottom of which the sun’s rays penetrated only on June 20-22. This means that Syene is located on the Tropic of Cancer. As the distance of Syene from Alexandria was known from the early Egyptian land surveys to be 5,000 stadia, assuming that Alexandria is directly north of Syene, all that Eratos- thenes had to do was to measure the angle of the noonday sun on June 21. The inclination of the sun’s rays to the vertical in Alexandria was found to be one- fiftieth of the circle (a little over 7°). There- fore a meridian of the earth must be 50 times 5,000, or 250,000, stadia — about 28.000 miles. The measurement is remark- ably accurate (within 14 per cent), espe- cially since neither is Syene on the Tropic of Cancer but somewhat north of it, nor is Alexandria on the same meridian with Syene but 3° west of it ; nor is the distance 5.000 stadia but, rather, 4,530; the angle was not measured correctly either, but the four errors compensated each other remark- ably well. Unfortunately, however, the measurement of the earth was repeated by Posidonius about one hundred years later. He used the distance from Rhodes to Alexandria; and for calculating the difference in arc he used the altitude of the star Canopus. His measurements were probably more accurate than those of Eratosthenes, but his errors did not compensate, and his result was later interpreted to be 18,000 miles for the earth’s circumference, a figure one-quarter too small. While 1° was equal to 700 stadia by Eratosthenes, according to Posidonius 1° was equal to 500 stadia. It was this later value that was accepted by Ptolemy and was carried over to the geographers of the fifteenth century. It is no wonder that Columbus mistook America for Asia, since he underestimated the size of the earth. The fact that we call our Indians by this name can be traced back to the measurement of Posidonius. Eratosthenes also made a map of the habitable world, with seven parallels and seven meridians. This map has been lost, but it has been described in sufficient detail so that its restoration can be attempted. It gives all the rich geographic information gathered by Alexander the Great and his successors. Taprobana Island, a misplaced Ceylon, makes its debut here and has been given on maps for more than a millennium. The short-cutting of Africa and India in the south was the result of the misconception that the equatorial waters are too hot to be navigated. Hipparchus, the astronomer, criticized the irregular network of Eratosthenes and pro- posed a parallel-meridian system of even intervals. On his proposed maps he divides the habitable world into 11 equal-spaced parallels, the location of which he describes in detail. For measurement of longitude he proposed to make simultaneous observations of the moon’s eclipses. This was an ingenious method, indeed, but, practically, very little was done in that time. The various measurements of the earth raised a curious problem. The known dimensions of the oekumene were too small to fit this immense sphere; it hardly covered a quadrant of it. Such an unbalanced world was contrary to the Greek sense of sym- metry. Crates, on his globe, solved the prob- lem by drawing three more balancing continents — an anticipation of the Americas and Australia. Here was born the concep- tion of the Antipodes or the great southern continent, the Terra Australis. It took 1,700 years for this legendary continent to shrink to the size of Antarctica. Ptolemy. The culmination of Greek cartography is associated with the name of Claudius Ptolemy of Alexandria, a.d. 90 to 168. We know very little of the man MANUSCRIPT MAPS 5 U himself, but his work had a greater influence on cartography and on geography in general than that of any other single figure in his- tory. Primarily an astronomer and mathe- matician, he showed relatively slight interest in the practical and human problems of geography. His famous “Geographia” has eight volumes. The first volume is devoted chiefly to theoretical principles, including a discussion of globe construction and the technique of map projection. Books II to VII contain a list of some 8,000 place names with latitudes and longitudes to determine their position. Very few of these 8,000 loca- tions were based on scientific observation; the coordinates obviously have been taken from older maps or itineraries. The most important is the eighth volume, which contains his discussion of principles of cartography, mathematical geography, pro- jections, and methods of astronomical ob- servation. He also gives detailed instruction as to how a map of the world should be con- structed. He describes two projections, both modifications of the conic projection. The text of Ptolemy’s “Geographia” in most manuscripts was accompanied by a map of the world and 26 detailed maps. Whether Ptolemy himself prepared them is not known, but in their original form they date from classical times and constitute the first general atlas of the world. The Ptolemy map as we know it today certainly was aug- mented later, and according to Bagrow it represents Byzantine work of the eleventh century. Figure 9 shows the world map of Ptolemy. Degrees of latitude and longitude are marked by a scale on one side, and the system of “climata” on the other. Climata are parallels marking the increase in the length of the longest day from the equator (12 hours) to the Arctic Circle (24 hours). The known world for Ptolemy extended through 180° of longitude from a prime meridian (0°) through the legendary the Globe of Crates Fig. 8 Reconstruction of the globe of Crates, showing the balancing conti- nents. Fortunate Islands (Canary Islands?) to China (Serica, the “silk land 55 ). The map is oriented to the north and shows the equator and the tropics, the latitude of the tropics being deter- mined as 23°51'. To us, accustomed to precise surveyed maps, Ptolemy’s work may seem crude. Nevertheless, if we consider the limitations of travel in antiq- uity, we can only admire the genius of the Greek mind that it displays. In the eastern and southern sections its defects are naturally most conspicuous. Thus the Deccan Peninsula is shrunk almost out of existence, whereas Ceylon (“Taprobana”) is enlarged far beyond its true proportions. Most peculiar is the form of Africa. As far south as the equator it is approxi- mately correct, but below that line, instead of contracting to a point, it flares out in both directions. Toward the west the map breaks off abruptly; but toward the east, Africa is con- nected with Asia; and in this way the Indian Ocean is made into an enclosed basin. The grounds for this mistaken conception are un- known. In all probability it contributed to the long delay in attempting to reach Asia by circumnavigating Africa. Ptolemy’s most fundamental error, however, is his underestimate of the earth’s size, an error that helped strengthen Columbus’ belief that he would reach Asia by sailing toward the west. Accepting the figure of Posidonius (1° equals 12 THE HISTORY OF MAPS 500 stadia), and applying it to the distance Ptolemy marks the culmination of cartog- measurements at his disposal, he concluded, as raphy in the ancient world. Henceforth we have seen, that Europe and Asia extended there was a steady decline. Although the over one-half the circuit of the globe.

Note that almost the entire Earth is part of the Roman Empire. Compare this map with the ancient Chinese map, Fig. 5. is reflected in the stubby form of Italy, which made it possible to show the Italian provinces on an enlarged scale. Moreover, about four-fifths of the area of the map was devoted to the Roman Empire alone. India, China (“Seres 55 ), Scythia, and Sarmatia (Russia) are shrunk to small outlying regions on the periphery. It is amusing to reflect that the almost contemporary Chinese maps show China occupying most of the map and the rest of the world grouped around it as a cluster of unimportant islands (see Fig. 5). Such was the Roman world map. At least so it has been reconstructed, for no original has survived. We may have some confidence in the reconstruction, however, for it is based upon data in the medieval world maps, which have been shown to be based on Roman originals. Moreover, we have a number of good textual descriptions by the great classical geographers, such as Strabo and Pomponius Mela, to aid in the reconstruction. One example of Roman cartography actually has survived, the so-called ‘‘Peutinger Table 55 (Fig. 11). Although copied by a twelfth- century monk, it seems to be an exact duplicate of an original from the fourth century, probably the work of a certain Castorius. The Peutinger Table is not a map in the true sense of the word but a cartogram showing the imperial highways, drawn on an enormously elongated outline of the world (21 feet long but only 1 foot high). There is no pretense of showing the whole world or even its major parts in correct proportion. It is merely a graphic compendium of mileages Fig. 11 The Peutinger Table shows the roads of the world on a scroll 21 feet long and only 1 foot high. In the section above the lower black strip is the Mediterranean Sea, and the upper black strip is the Adriatic Sea. ( Modified from Konrad Miller , “Die Peutinger sche Tafcl” Stuttgart , 1929.) THE HISTORY OF MAPS and military posts throughout the empire, drawn up on a convenient scroll. As such it is extremely rich in data. It gives the names of more than 5,000 places and has long served as one of the major sources of our knowledge of Roman geography. Fig. 12 St. Beatus in 776 patterned the Roman map to fit Christian theology. Note the enormous Holy Land and the Paradise with its four rivers. The out- lines of the lands were simplified for more regular and decorative aspect. The Middle Ages Completely dominated by Christian su- pernaturalism, the medieval map maker made no serious attempt to show the world as it actually is. Instead, he followed an ideal pattern in his own mind, concentrating on artistic and symbolical expression. For the geographic content of his map he relied almost exclusively on the circular world map, the Orbis Terrarum of the Romans. Even this, however, had already undergone modifications, which had diminished its geographical accuracy. As early as the fourth century it had been Christianized by the great church father, St. Jerome, who made a map in which he exaggerated the Holy Land beyond all real proportions. In the eighth century a Spanish monk named Beatus prepared an interesting ver- sion of the old Roman map. Later scribes who copied it paid slight respect to its geographical contents. Even the oval shape of the .map itself was frequently distorted, sometimes to a rectangle, sometimes to a circle. The typical world map of the Middle Ages remained a disk, as it had been for the Romans. In its most extreme form it is known as the “T-in-O” (Orbis Terrarum), or the “wheel” map. In this schematization Asia was usually shown occupying the upper half of the O, with Europe and Africa more or less equally dividing the lower half. Fig. 13 The divine perfection and simplicity of the T-in-O map (Orbis Terrarum) appealed to the medieval mind. MANUSCRIPT MAPS 15 Jerusalem was generally placed in the center following the Biblical text: “This is Jeru- salem: I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.” 1 Nothing could have pleased the medieval mind more than the divine harmony displayed by this map. Not only did God create the world in perfect sym- metry but he also made it in the form of the Latin monogram of its name. There also existed during the Middle Ages another type of world map, based upon the conception of the earth as a sphere. Although this type has survived chiefly in the form of simplified carlograms (such as the so-called “Macrobius” maps), it is important because it kept alive not only the knowledge of the earth’s sphericity but also the division into zones, which the Greeks had developed (see Table II). Medieval maps were produced in fairly large numbers from the eighth to the middle of the fifteenth century. More than 600 maps have now been discovered. The vast majority of these are extremely simple, often showing little more than the mere T-in-O outline. A lew examples that have come down to us contain an astonishing wealth of detail. The two finest specimens arc the Hereford and Ebstorf maps, both prepared toward the end of the thirteenth century, the period when the Gothic style in archi- tecture was at: its peak. Hereford and Ebstorf Maps. Perhaps the most impressive feature of these mappae mundi is their size. The Hereford map is more than 5 feet in diameter, and the Ebstorf map more than 13 feet. Each is conceived in terms of Christian symbolism. On the Hereford map the figure of Christ presides in majesty at the top of the disk, as at the Day of Judgment. The Garden of Paradise is placed in the east, and the entire map is richly adorned with Christian iconog- raphy, the Ark of Noah, the Tower of Babel, 1 Ezdc. 5:5. etc. The illustrations are not confined, however, to Biblical lore. The outlying sections of the earth, particularly a thin strip of land along the southern edge of Africa (which was incorrectly labeled “Europe ’ 5 by the cartographer!), are peopled with satyrs, griffins, and other mon- strosities such as the quaint figure of a man who is shading his single-eyed head with an enor- mous single foot held in the air. On the Ebstorf map the general symbolical concept is somewhat •different. The world is depicted as the body of Christ, whose head, hands, and feet protrude beyond the circular frame of the map itself. Matthew Paris. It is quite true that even in these elaborate monuments the medieval cartographers were doing little more than perpetuating the geographical knowledge of the Romans. Nevertheless, from the thirteenth century on small amounts of new information began to be shown. Indeed, the Hereford map surprises us by its extremely inaccurate representation of England. But an earlier cartographer, the English chroni- cler, Matthew Paris, had already drafted a map of Great Britain, in which the general outline and the location of individual towns arc distinctly recognizable (see Table II). Besides ranking as one of the finest produc- tions of the cartographer’s art in the early Middle Ages, the Matthew Paris map also indicates the emergence of a new interest in the appearance of the world as it actually is. This interest, which had been dormant for nearly a thousand years, was still weak, but, as we shall see, it was to grow rapidly in intensity. Arabic Cartography. During the period when Western cartography was little more than decorative illustration of theological texts, the Moslem world carried on the tradition of classical antiquity and, in some respects, even advanced beyond it. It is not surprising that the Arabs, who possessed a remarkable gift for astronomy, mathe- matics, and geometry, should also have been 16 THE HISTORY OF MAPS TIME CHARTS OF HISTORICAL CARTOGRAPHY Aiacrobius , Z.one maps StadLa.sm.us # Soiling directions Marcianus, List, of cartographers ll.

Even their religion, with its principle that every mosque must face toward Mecca, favored a knowledge of the location of places. They also had access to the text of Ptolemy’s “Geographia,” which had disappeared in the West. The principal achievements of the Arabic geographer were directed along lines laid down by the Greeks. Improving on the method of the ancients, they recalculated the length of a degree and arrived at a very accurate result. They constructed celestial globes and studied the problem of projec- tions. Maps were regularly used for geo- graphical instruction in the schools. These maps have a tendency to force the outlines of land into geometrical patterns, distorting them sometimes beyond recognition. Edrisi Map. The most important work of Arabic cartography was the world map of Edrisi, prepared in 1154 at the court of Roger II, the Norman king of Sicily. Through the enlightened patronage of King Roger, Edrisi was able to draw not only from Moslem but also from Christian Portolan At the same time that the ecclesiastical cartographers depicted an imaginary world, a new type of map emerged, surpassing in accuracy everything that had preceded it. This group of maps, the so-called “portolan charts,” appears to have been created by the admirals and captains of the Genoese fleet during the second half of the thirteenth century. The oldest surviving specimen, the so-called “Pisan Chart,” is still relatively imperfect, but by 1300 an accurate outline had been perfected and was copied almost without modification for the following three centuries. As late as 1620 it was still re- garded as adequate for the purposes of practical navigation in the Mediterranean. sources. The map was based on a rough, rectangular projection. The Asiatic part of the map is very rich in information. It represents correctly the Caspian and Aral Fig. 14 These cartograms were used in medieval Arabic school maps. seas, which were misrepresented in antiq- uity. In the shape of Africa we find the influence of Ptolemy, although Africa and China are not connected. The map is oriented with the south on top — a common feature of Islamic maps. Charts The origin of the portolan charts is still a debated question. There can be little doubt, however, that they are based on a survey by compass, which instrument came into gen- eral use about this time. Numerous specimens of portolan charts have survived, particularly from the six- teenth century. The great majority are made on a single sheepskin. They show approximately the same area: the Mediter- ranean and Black Seas with great accuracy, and the Atlantic Ocean to Ireland very poorly. They are oriented according to the magnetic needle, which at that period must have shown a declination of 10 or 11° west of the true north. The lettering is confined Fig. 15 The portolan charts represent the high point of medieval cartography. Their accuracy is in great contrast with the fanciful maps of the “Middle Ages .’ 5 largely to harbors, capes, and other coastal features. The land surface is left blank or decorated with coats of arms, flags, and pictures of kings. Occasionally, however, rivers and a few inland cities are shown, usu- ally with no greater accuracy than on the contemporary ecclesiastical maps. Perhaps the most striking feature of the portolan charts is the elaborate system of compass roses and rhumb lines (lines of compass directions) which crisscross their entire surface. Usually one or two central com- passes are shown, each with 16 peripheral compasses with 32 lines of varying color radiating from each. They appear to have been drawn after the outline of the map was finished, and were probably intended to help the navigator in setting his course. Whether they were really of any practical assistance is by no means certain. Catalan Atlas. The portolan tradition reached its height in the work of a family of Catalonian Jews who worked in Majorca at the end of the fourteenth century. Its greatest monument, the Catalan Atlas of 1375, differs from the ordinary portolans in that it has been expanded into a sort of world map. Following the text of Marco Polo, it depicts eastern Asia, the Deccan Peninsula, and the Indian Ocean far better than any of the earlier maps. Prepared originally as a gift for King Charles V of France, the Catalan Atlas is now cherished as one of the finest treasures of the Biblio- theque Nationale in Paris. The fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are generally regarded as the period of deca- dence in the portolan tradition. Never- theless, many beautiful specimens have survived, especially the work of the Sicilian school of Olives and Homem. chapter 2: The Renaissance of Maps Never in history did man’s conception of the earth change more rapidly than around 1500. Compare the circular world maps that were still produced after the middle of the fifteenth century with the almost modern Ribero map (1529), and we see a different world. What brought about this change? Rediscovery of Ptolemy. Three major events contributed to the renaissance of cartography. The first of these was the rediscovery of Ptolemy’s “Geographia,” which was translated into Latin about 1405. This event must be viewed as a product of the attempt made by Italian humanists to recover as much as possible of the Greek and Roman legacy. It is true, of course, that Ptolemy’s “Geographia” had never been totally lost. It had been preserved by the Arabs, and through them part of its sub- stance had been introduced in indirect form into the West during the Middle Ages. Nevertheless, the recovery of the complete work, especially the maps, gave a tre- mendous stimulus to the development of cartography. During the fifteenth century it was transcribed in numerous superb manuscripts, two of which are now pre- served in American libraries (the Ebner Codex in the New York Public Library and the Wilton Codex of the Huntington Library in California). In the last quarter of the fifteenth century a number of printed editions, which contained maps engraved on either wood or copper, were issued. Copies of these are naturally much more numerous than the manuscripts and may be consulted in the libraries of many American cities. The Errors of Ptolemy’s Map. Such was the authority of this newly recovered classi- cal work that armchair cartographers were ready to discard much of the sound in- formation that had been added to the world map since antiquity. Ptolemy’s elongated shape of the Mediterranean, which, as we have seen, rested on an underestimate of the length of a degree, threatened to oust the remarkably accurate outline of the portolan charts. Ptolemy’s distortion was reproduced on the majority of sixteenth-century maps. Mercator reduced its length to 53 , and it was still further corrected by the great astronomer Kepler in 1630. It was not until the map of Delisle, published in 1700, that the Mediterranean appeared in its true length of 42°. Among other Ptolemaic errors which influenced cartographers during the Renais- sance we may cite the outline of a great river which flowed across the Sahara Desert. It must be pointed out, however, that Ptolemy’s errors sometimes led to fortunate results. Thus, it has been shown that his underestimate of the earth’s size was a decisive factor in convincing Colum- bus that Asia could readily be reached by sailing westward. Tabulae Modernae. Finally, we must recognize that not all cartographers were content to be slavish copyists of the Ptole- maic models. From the first appearance of the Ptolemaic maps it was apparent to scholars that they stood in need of modern- ization. This was particularly true of place names, which had, of course, become com- pletely changed during the centuries. Con- sequently, we find new maps, the so-called cc Tabulae Modernae,” included in many of the manuscripts as supplements to the regular Ptolemaic maps. The earliest of these was a map of Scandinavia, prepared by a Dane named Glavus, who had visited Rome in 1425.

Harvard University, CQ/wbridjG .Mass, U.S of the Renaissance 22 THE HISTORY OF MAPS as far as his coordinates extended, Clavus broke through the limits of the classical map to include Norway, Iceland, and even southern Greenland, which he had per- sonally visited. It was the first extension of the cartographic horizon beyond the north- ern limits of the ancient world. In the following generation (about 1425 to 1460), additional “Tabulae Modernae” were prepared, which showed Spain, France, Italy, and central Europe. These works were frequently reproduced in Ptolemy manu- scripts, and also served as models for the earliest printed maps of the Renaissance. They may be said to stand at the very head of modern scientific cartography. Printing and Engraving. The second event that stimulated the progress of cartog- raphy was the invention of printing and engraving. Hitherto all maps had to be drawn by hand, expensively and labori- ously. In some places, as in Venice, there were map factories where large staffs of draftsmen were engaged in copying maps; even so, their expense necessarily limited their use to royal courts, naval officers, and to some of the universities. The average man had almost no contact whatsoever with maps. From the flaming descriptions of maps given by some of the medieval writers we may see that their production was re- garded as little short of miraculous. With the introduction of printing and engraving, thousands of copies could be obtained from a single plate, and the price of the maps sank to a fraction of what it had been before. The earliest maps were woodcuts, but very soon copper engravings took their place and remained in universal popularity for 300 years. In preparing maps of this type, lines and letterings were carved with a graver or burin into a polished copper plate h^- reverse, mirrorlike fashion. Ink was rubbed into the grooves; the plate was wiped clean and then pressed against a slightly dampened sheet of rag paper. Color- ing was added by hand. Map engraving became a lucrative business, and the big establishments of Amsterdam and Venice employed hundreds of workmen. The Great Discoveries. The third and perhaps most far-reaching event inductive to a renaissance of cartography was that of the great discoveries. The age of the great discoveries was itself made possible by a number of inventions. We have already noted the influence of the compass. Equally important was the development of a better type of sailing vessel, particularly the Flemish karak and the Portuguese caravel. These were three-masted, decked ships with the sails I'igged in such fashion that the vessel could be managed even in adverse winds. Henceforth it was no longer neces- sary to hug the coasts as in the old galleys; it was also unnecessary to carry an enormous amount of provisions for the oarsmen, a circumstance which had usually made it difficult for the earlier galleys to go more than a week without landing. The caravels could be provisioned for months and were ready to sail anywhere in the seven seas. It is largely because of this fact that in the following centuries the known world more than doubled in size; and this, in turn, produced the most far-reaching effects on history. The first of the important discoveries were those made by the Portuguese along the coast of western Africa. They were recorded piecemeal in contemporary maps of the portolan type. They also appear on the globe constructed by Martin Behaim of Nuremberg in 1492, the oldest terrestrial globe in existence. In the same year, Colum- bus actually reached some islands about 70° west of Spain. Seemingly this confirmed Ptolemy’s conception of a small earth. In the following years, however, Pinson and Cabral found extensive lands located only 23 THE RENAISSANCE OF MAPS 30 or 40° west of Spain, and south of the equator; and Sebastian Cabot discovered islands lying only 45° west of Spain in the latitude of England. None of these had been recorded on BehainTs globe. Juan de la Cosa. The cartographers of that time did their best to reconcile the new discoveries with the Ptolemaic tradition. The four maps in Fig. 16 show strikingly the development of this attempt. Juan de la Cosa’s map is the most famous of the time (1500). (Some authorities think the map is of later date.) Juan de la Cosa was probably not the owner and mate of the Santa Maria , the flagship of Columbus on his first voyage but a seaman recorded on the admiral’s second voyage. His map records the landfall of Cabral in Brazil, Cabot’s voyage to Canada, and Vasco da Gama’s route to the Indies. Waldseemiiller. The first map that shows both North and South America clearly separated from Asia was prepared in 1507 by an Alsatian cartographer named Martin Waldseemiiller. It is a stupendous work (4-g- by 8 feet, printed on 12 sheets), very rich in detail, and executed in a fine Ger- man Renaissance style. Except for the new discoveries, the map is based mostly on Ptolemy. It is constructed, however, on a new and interesting projection, resembling that of Bonne. One of the most far-reaching effects of this map was that for the first time the name “America” appears on it. Im- pressed by the account of the Florentine traveler, Amerigo Vespucci, Waldseemiiller placed the name c ‘America” on the southern large island. In an accompanying pamphlet he writes: “I do not see why any one may object to name it Amerige— that is, Ame- rigo’s land— from Americus, the discoverer, a man of sagacious mind ... or America, since both Europe and Asia derived their names from women.” The name “America” was not indeed accepted for some time; its final acceptance must be attributed to Apianus and to Mercator, who applied the name to the northern continent as well. Diego Ribero. On Sept. 8, 1522, a badly worn ship arrived at Seville with 1 8 men on Fig. 16 Geographical conceptions changed more rapidly in the first quarter of the sixteenth century than ever before or ever since. 24 THE HISTORY OF MAPS board. Great was the astonishment of the people to learn that these were the sole survivors of the proud fleet which 3 years before had left under Admiral Magellan with the purpose of circumnavigating the world. This feat had now been accom- plished, and with it the Ptolemaic system of geography was overthrown. America was put in its proper place on the globe; the Straits of Magellan were marked ; and the vast immensity of the Pacific Ocean was recognized. One of the first maps showing this new conception of the world is the chart of Diego Ribero (1529). Ribero was a Portuguese in the service of the Spanish king and, as royal cosmographer, kept up to date the Padron Real, the standard map of the admiralty. The Padron Real itself is lost, but Ribero’s chart is a close copy. The outlines of the world on this map are remarkably modern. The map, like all the Spanish charts of the period, is executed in the traditional portolan style. A comparison of this map with the Cosa map shows a change in the geographic concepts of the world that is unparalleled in history for such a short period. Globe’s. The first known terrestrial globe that survived was made by Martin Behaim in Nuremberg and finished in 1492, the year of the discovery of America. There is no trace of America on it ; it shows entirely the geography of Ptolemy, with additions based on the Portuguese discoveries. Martin Behaim was for some time in the service of the Portuguese king and took part in voyages to West Africa. His globe is 20 inches in diameter and artistically delin- eated, with ample descriptions and notes. He fills the ocean south and cast of Asia with a great number of islands, which reach well out into the region where America should be located. The globe is now in the Ger- manic Museum in Nuremberg. The most famous globe maker of this period was Johannes Schoncr of Nurem- berg. Two of his globes from the years 1515 and 1520 show a South American strait even before Magellan 5 s voyage. This, however, was little more than a happy guess. More- over, on the southern side of the strait we find the enormous Terra Australis, that great imaginary southern continent which figured so prominently in all the maps of the sixteenth century. Globes at this time became popular. A favorite pose of contemporary portraits is a man solemnly measuring a globe with a drawing compass (see Fig. 19). The Italian School. In the first half of the sixteenth century Italian map makers were very productive. The Italian Renaissance {Courtesy of the Encyclopaedia Britannica .) Fig. 17 The Behaim Globe of 1492. THE RENAISSANCE OF MAPS 25 reached its peak at that time, and Italian artists ranked first in all arts, and also in cartography. The earlier maps of the Italian school were mostly rendered in portolan style, with rhumb lines and compass roses. In the later maps and charts, however, regu- lar projections were introduced. The most active among the Italian map makers was Battista Agnese of Venice. His beautifully drawn and colored manuscript maps can be seen in many museums of Europe. He was among the first to give the proper delineation of Lower California. The most important cartographic monument of this period is the Lafreri Atlas (Rome, 1556- 1572). This atlas contains a miscellany of printed maps prepared by the best cartog- raphers of the age, Gastaldi, Bertelli, Zaltieri, etc. Copies of the Lafreri Atlas are rare and highly prized. Great advancement has been made in the realistic delineation of mountains. Superb are the maps of Crescendo Sorte of Brescia, in which the scenery of the Piemonte is drawn in bird 5 s-eye-view manner. The Cosmographiae. Among the most popular books of the Renaissance were the so-called “cosmographiae. 55 These were textbooks of geography, astronomy, history, and natural sciences, described in regional order and illustrated with maps and figures. One of the earliest and most popular of these manuals was the “Cosmographia 55 of the older Apianus. Petrus Apianus (1495-1554) — his name was Latinized from Peter Biene- witz— was professor of mathematics in Ingolstadt, Bavaria, and one of the foremost The Dutch School Situated amid three great powers of Europe— France, England, and Germany — and subject to Spain, the greatest sea power of that time, the small Netherlands became the market place of Europe. Through its cosmographers of his time. He invented the stereographic projection and is credited also with the so-called “Apianus projection. 55 This projection, which consisted of hori- zontal parallels and arcuate meridians, has been revived in Germany in recent years. Apianus 5 “Cosmographia 55 appeared in 1524 and speedily became one of the most Fig. 18 Instruments for measuring land were used ' in the early Renaissance. ( From Apianus , “Cosmo- graphia” 1524.) popular textbooks in its field. At least 15 editions are known, and it was translated into five languages. Later editions were augmented by Gemma Frisius, a Dutch cosmographer who introduced the basic principles of triangulation. More voluminous was the ec Gosmo- graphia 55 of Sebastian Munster. Published at Basel in 1544, Munster's compilation was the main source book of information for half a century. The maps, indeed, were rather primitive woodcuts, and the text abounded in fabulous stories; but its importance in disseminating knowledge was great. of Cartography thriving commercial cities passed the mer- chants and sailors of all nations, and the Dutch were able to get firsthand informa- tion from every part of the world. After the Netherlands gained their independence at THE HISTORY OF MAPS the turn of the century, the Dutch them- selves became an active sea-faring and colonizing nation. The central position of the Netherlands, the industry and artistic ability of the people, and their interest in distant lands made the Dutch first-class map makers. In no other period in the history of cartography can we find such prolific production of high-grade maps as in the golden age of Dutch cartography , which began in the middle of the sixteenth century and lasted over a hundred years. Mercator. The father of Dutch cartog- raphy was Gerardus Mercator (1512-1594), as his name was Latinized from Gerhard Kremer. He studied in the University of Louvain, and one of his teachers was Gemma Frisius, the noted cosmographer. He became a maker of globes and instru- ments in Duisburg and in this connection began to make maps. Later he settled in Louvain, where he became the founder and head of one of the most important carto- graphic houses of that age. The chief merit of Mercator was the Fig. 19 Mercator (left) and Hondius were among the greatest cartographers of the Renaissance. The cross-staff on top of the frame was used for measuring latitude at sea. liberation of cartography from the influence of Ptolemy. He compiled his material from all available sources; he examined critically the older maps and read the records of sailors and travelers; and he traveled widely himself. He became famous by his map of Europe of 1554, in which he reduced the length of the Mediterranean Sea to 53°, a correction of Ptolemy’s map. At present Mercator is best known for the Mercator projection. This is a system of horizontal parallels and vertical meridians where the relation between the two is true on any part of the map. This is the only projection in which the lines of compass directions appear straight, and for this reason it is well adapted for navigation. Mercator designed this projection for his large chart of the world in 1569. Ortelius. Mercator did not publish any great atlases in his lifetime, but he en- couraged his friend, Abraham Ortelius, to prepare one, and the “Theatrum Orbis Terrarum” was published in 1570. This is regarded as the first modern atlas of the world, preceding in publication the equally famous Italian Lafreri Atlas. It has 53 plates engraved in copper, beautifully executed, and colored by hand. In the accompanying essay Ortelius listed 87 geographers and cartographers whom he had used as references in this work. It is characteristic of the rapidly increasing interest in the subject that the 1587 edition of the same atlas has 108 plates and lists 137 references. Mercator’s Successors. Mercator’s own atlas was published in 1595, after his death, by his son, Rumold. His establishment was taken over by his son-in-law, Jodocus Hondius (1563-1611), a cartographer of renown himself. The great traditions of the house were carried on by his son, Henricus, and his son-in-law, Jan Janszoon (1596 1664). Janszoon’s “Nieuwe Atlas” had THE RENAISSANCE OF MAPS 27 Fig. 20 The Western Hemisphere from Ortelius’ “Theatrum Orbis Terrarum. 55 This much-reduced copy gives but little indication of the beauty of the colorful original. Note the large Terra Australis. over 400 plates wonderfully engraved and colored. His works were surpassed only by the rival establishment of the Blaeus in Amster- dam. The founder of the house, Willem Janszoon Blaeu (1571—1638), was a man of scientific standing and a friend and student of Tycho Brahe, the great Danish astrono- mer. He was given the title “Cartographer to the Republic 55 and was invested with the right to examine all records of seamen, to improve upon his maps. His “Atlas Novus 55 of 1634 grew to six large volumes. His work was carried on by his sons, Jan and Willem, and his grandson, Cornelius. Their “Atlas Major 55 grew into 12 large folio volumes and was translated into several languages. Their establishment was destroyed by fire in 1672, and those plates which could be salvaged were bought by De Wit, one of the later Dutch cartographers. Later Dutch Cartographers. By the end of the seventeenth century dozens of establishments were publishing maps, atlases, and globes, mostly in Amsterdam, and all Europe was flooded with their products. Even at the present time, for a few dollars one can buy original imprints of old Dutch maps. Among the more prolific publishers we may mention the Allards (Carolus and Aberon), the Donckers (Justus and Cornelius), the Schencks (Pieter and Pieter, Jr.), the Valks (Gerald and Leonard), the Visshers (Nicholas and Nicholas, Jr.), and the later Janszoons (Nicholas and Carl). Hundreds of atlases of folio size were published, but few of them achieved the excellence and beauty of the Blaeu the history of maps and Janszoon maps. The maps had to be cheaper to meet competition; quality gave place to quantity; and the supremacy held by Dutch maps soon passed to France. In the publishing of sea charts, however, the Dutch still retained their supremacy during the early eighteenth century. Later they were superseded by the English. General Characteristics of the Dutch Renaissance Maps. The early Dutch maps represent the culmination of the art of cartographic rendering. The maps of later ages may be more accurate, but in the art of cartographic expression we still can learn from Janszoon and the Blaeus. Each sheet was a well-composed unit; land and sea, title, lettering, and decoration were har- moniously distributed. A more legible type of lettering was introduced by Mercator. Characteristic are the so-called “swash” lines, masterful strokes of the pen, which were often used to decorate otherwise empty surfaces. The title, scales, and descriptive material are usually collected into decora- tive frames called “cartouches,” often adorned by animals and products of the country. These attempts are not always fortunate; the artist probably never left Holland, and his conceptions of tropical regions, as, for instance, African kings living in Dutch palaces, are often very naive. .Orientation to north was far from universal. If it fitted the page better, the map has been turned in any direction; and the north direction was shown by decorative compass roses. The most objectionable feature of Dutch maps is in their indiscriminate use of in- formation. To show large empty spaces did not help to sell the map, and commercially inclined artists were more than willing to fill the land with any kind of informa- tion or to extend the known detail into the unknown, a common practice in olden times. “So geographers, in Afric maps With savage pictures fill their gaps, And o’er unhabitable downs, Place elephants for want of towns.” 1 Mention should be made of the Dutch city maps. The great city atlas of Braun and Hoefnagel, “Civitates Orbis Terrarum,” depicted cities with most masterful detail. Ortelius regarded this atlas as equal in merit to his own. The French Cartography of the Renais- sance. The waves of the Great Awakening reached France in the middle of the six- teenth century. In cartography, however, the French long retained some medieval features. The early French maps were rendered in the portolan tradition, but with more finesse, very much like mural paint- ings. The charts of the cartographers of the Dieppe school, somewhat in the style of mural paintings, are among the most beautiful maps ever made. Somewhat less decorative are the maps of the “enlumi- neurs” of the late sixteenth century (see Time Chart, Table III). The further development of French car- tography was strongly influenced by the work of the Sanson family. The founder of the house was Nicolas Sanson d 5 Abbeville (1600-1667), who, himself of Flemish origin, was under the influence of Dutch map makers. He was assisted and succeeded by his sons, Adrien and Guillaume; by his son-in-law, Pierre Duval; by his grandson, Gilles Robert de Vougondy; and by his great-grandson, Didier Robert de Vou- gondy, one of the most influential car- tographic dynasties of all times. The Sansons were prolific producers of. maps; they pub- lished several atlases, maps of the postal roads and the rivers of France, and many historical maps. Closely connected with the 1 Swift, Jonathan, “On Poetry, A Rhapsody/’ THE RENAISSANCE OF MAPS 29 Sansons was Alexis Hubert Jaillot. He bought the plates for his atlases from Guillaume Sanson and added much of his own work. Jaillot also edited the most important geographic work of this period, cc Le Neptune Frangois 55 (1693), in collabo- ration with Jean Dominique Cassini and many other noted cartographers of that time. In general the maps of the Sanson house resembled the Dutch maps, but usually manifested a more scientific attitude. Deco- rations are far less frequent, and exten- sive notes of geographic information are common. The English School. Notable carto- graphic work was done in England in the time of Queen Elizabeth. The English maps of this period are very similar to the Dutch in style, but greater detail and less sense of proportion make them seem more crowded. The pioneer of English cartography is Christopher Saxton (1542-1608?). His chief contribution is an atlas of county maps of England, published in 1579. His work was authorized by Queen Elizabeth and is one of the first detailed surveys of the country. The nature of his survey we may learn from his passport: “All shieres . . . shall be assisting ... to see him conducted into any towne, castle or hill to view the coun- trey, and he may be accompanied with II or III honest men such as do best know the countrey. ... 55 ATI ANTIS INS UL A. Fig. 21 Sanson’s map of America, which was conceived as the legendary lost Atlantis. Note that California is shown as an island, although on the earlier Ortelius map it was shown correctly. All five Great Lakes are shown. The map is in the sinusoidal projection. 30 THE HISTORY OF MAPS An important English map is the chart of the world of 1599, which is occasionally found bound into Hackluyt’s work and which is now very rare. It is probably the work of Edward Wright, a friend of Hackluyt and author of “Certain Errors in Navigation. 55 The map is in Mercator projection; it shows the results of Drake’s voyages and the discoveries along the Northwest and Northeast Passages. It is one of the best maps of its age. This is the map to which Shakespeare refers in “Twelfth Night 55 : “He does smile his face in more lines than there are in the new map with the augmentation of the Indies. ... 55 Another interesting work is John Ogilvie’s atlas of road strip maps. This idea, to show roads in the form of furls, was first used by Matthew Paris in the time of the Crusades and has often been employed since. Figure 22 is interesting because it shows how Ogilvie 5 s survey was carried out. We see the figure of the surveyor on horseback, and his apprentice with a perambulator measuring distances. At the end of the seventeenth century, English charts became widely used. Notable is Halley’s magnetic chart of 1683, one of the first charts of this kind. Cartographic curiosities are the beautiful tapestry maps of Sheldon, naturally more decorative than informative. Other Nations. The earliest “basic” maps of many countries were produced in the Renaissance, e.g., those of Austria and Hungary by Lazius, around 1620, of Russia by Herbcrtstein, and of Scanclia of Oleus Magnus, which is one of the most richly decorated maps of the period. The detailed map of Bavaria by Philip Apianus is notable because it is claimed to be based on triangulation.

THE RENAISSANCE OF MAPS 31 : A ri 1 v v rrm VIRGINIAN SEA • Fig. 23 John Smith’s map of Virginia, 1608, is based on a compass survey made from canoes. Note the small crosses marking the limits of the actual survey. The greatest cartographer of the later Renaissance is P. Vincenzo Cloronelli (1650- 1718) of Venice, who especially excelled in globes. His 10- and 15-foot globes, prepared in Paris for Louis XIV, evoked much com- ment. lie founded the first geographical society, the “Argonauts,” in Venice. Of particular interest to us are the “Virginia” and “New England” maps, based on the surveys of Gapt. John Smith. The maps themselves were not drawn by the great colonizer. The Virginia map is based on compass sketches made from canoes, considering which it is remarkably accurate. The map has crosses to mark the limits of actual survey; beyond these every- thing is “by relation.” This seems to be the first “relative reliability” map. The New England map has an accurate shore line, but most places are misnamed. Equally fundamental are the maps of Champlain, in which the great navigator delineated the St. Lawrence River and the intricate coast line of eastern Canada. chapter 3: The Reformation of Cartography The fundamental changes between the seventeenth-century Dutch school and the eighteenth-century French school of car- tography can perhaps best be understood by comparison of two maps. Figure 24 shows Africa of d’Anville of 1747! Gone are the monsters, elephants, lions, and swash lines; a cartouche around the title is the only decoration. The map looks empty; the regions of which nothing is known are left Fig. 24 D’Anville’s Africa illustrates the reformation of cartography. Its scientific accuracy and omission of all doubtful data is in contrast with the decorative map of Janszoon, which is shown in the lower left. £ Africa as delineated by Janszoon in 1628: Africa is divided into kingdoms with well- defined boundaries and is full of cities, rivers, and lakes, even in the Sahara Desert. Monsters, elephants, lions, or swash-lined lettering fill the space. At this time the actual knowledge of Africa’s interior was practically nil. How somber in comparison appears the blank; where information is doubtful, a note to that effect is given. The traditional large river of the Sahara Desert is still present, but a note states that it is by the authority of Ptolemy and Edrisi and that there is in- formation available that the river flows east instead of west, as is actually the case of the Niger. Accuracy, clearness, and attention to detail mark the French map in 32 THE REFORMATION OF CARTOGRAPHY 33 contrast to the older maps of the Dutch in spite of new discoveries, as long as the school. maps could be sold.

At sea the old cross-staff and portant. Information was obtained where backstaff were replaced by the octant and it was available most inexpensively — by the sextant. Longitude measurements were copying other maps. Old plates were used, no longer a feat in higher astronomy. The Fig. 25 The reformation of cartography dates from this map of 1696. The original was laid out on the floor of the Paris Observatory and embodies the new longitude observations of the Academy under J. D, Cassini. ( After reproduction from W. L. Clements Library) THE HISTORY OF MAPS chronometer, invented by Harrison, en- abled seamen to read their longitude as easily as their latitude. On land the system of triangulation was perfected by William Blaeu who actually triangulated a part of the Netherlands coast. For measuring angles the old diopter was still much in use, but at the end of the century it was replaced by the telescopic theodolite. Longitude Measurements of the Acad- emy. The reformation of cartography was introduced by the longitude measurements of the French Academy at the end of the seventeenth century. These longitudes were measured by simultaneous observations of the occultations of Jupiter's satellites at various places all over the world. The result was a new map of the world, which was laid out by Jean Dominique Cassini on the floor of the Paris Observatory in 1682 — one of the fundamental maps of history. One of the curious results of these measurements was that France appeared to be much smaller than it was delineated by Sanson; it is said that Louis XIV remarked to Cassini that his measurements took away from France more than the King had added by all his wars of conquest. Delisle and His Successors. The outstanding cartographer of the early eighteenth century was Guillaume Delisle. His chief merit was the elimination of many errors which had crept into cartography and which had been copied so often that they were accepted as truths. He reduced the size of the Mediterranean to its actual length, thus breaking completely with the Ptolemaic tradition. He also corrected the map of California. Lower California was shown correctly as a peninsula by Mercator and his contemporaries. Later, however, California was shown as an island on all the late seventeenth- century maps. Delisle reestablished its peninsu- lar form in 1700, based on the overland voyage of Father Kino. His map of North* America of 1700 was the best of its period. We have already mentioned the work of Jean Baptiste Bourguignon dAnville (1697—1782). His maps of the continents made the world realize how little it knew of the interiors of Asia, Africa, and the Americas. His remarkably rich atlas of China was based on the extensive surveys of the Jesuit missionaries. The most important atlases of this period were made by Gilles and Didicr Robert de Vougondy; their general atlas was used the world over; it is particularly noted for its “Preface Historique,” in which the history of geography is recorded in 33 folio pages. Mention should be made of the famous atlas of charts, “Hydrographic Franqaise,” the greatest collection of marine charts hitherto made and published. The work was organized by J. N. Beilin, who ranks equal to d'Anville and Delisle as a leader of this great period of cartography. English Cartograp"
