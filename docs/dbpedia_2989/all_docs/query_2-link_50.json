Thus, in all topographic and in many thematic maps, the representation of relief is the foundation for all the remaining contents of the map. The proper rendering of terrain is one of the primary tasks of cartography. From time immemorial the most capable mapmakers have sought solutions to this problem. Good terrain representation is crucial to the quality of a map. Nevertheless, this highly rewarding aspect of cartography is very often poorly handled or neglected entirely. The fault lies to a certain extent in the high demands it places on artistry and draftsmanship, and in economic factors. Yet a further reason for its neglect is inadequate instruction, i.e. a shortage of specialist training programs and well-informed teachers. Most crucial of all, however, is the absence of adequate textbooks. In 1965 my textbook Kartographische Geländedarstellung appeared in German, published by de Gruyter Publishers, Berlin. For the first time in this field a modern training manual had appeared with the express purpose of filling this gap in instruction. The training offered in this work, which draws on experience and tests from all corners of the globe, is as relevant and valid today as when the book first appeared. The author takes great pleasure in the thought that his book is now available in English, and it is to be hoped that it will prove useful to all persons with a specialist interest in maps. First and foremost, this book is directed to cartographers, the actual designers of maps; but it should also interest topographers, geodesists, surveyors, photogrammetric engineers, geographers and scientists as well as teachers of cartography and geography and, finally, anyone with a love of good maps. It is the author's hope that this comprehensive and easily accessible guide to the ways of rendering terrain properly in maps, and in particular the large number of instructive illustrations, will help to improve the quality of maps in the future. Its objective is to make maps more reliable, easier to read, and easier to understand. As in many other fields of science and technology, attempts have been made in mapmaking, too, to simplify or expedite production by calling upon electronics and the computer. As this has likewise effected the representation of relief, a few guidelines to this new field have been added in the English edition. Electronics can aid the production of maps at certain stages in the production process. However, it is not the task of electronics or other\n\nVI\n\nPreface to the English Edition\n\nproduction techniques to determine what maps should contain or what form these contents should take, and certainly not to lower the quality of tried and tested forms of representation. Production is a means to an end, not an end in itself. He who mistakes the goal will never find the path. The main task of this book is to point the way to the right goal. It offers guidelines to a proper rendering of terrain in maps of all types and scales, whether drawn along traditional lines or produced by electronic means. Thus it is hoped that this work will be valuable foundation and guide, not only for mapmakers working with pencil and scribing tool, but also for those working with computers. It was no easy matter to bring the German of the original edition into proper English without losing some of the original meaning, for research and methodology, and the terminologies of both, differ from country to country. However, a quick comparison of the text with the numerous illustrations should make the work understandable to readers everywhere. The author wishes to offer his heartfelt thanks to all of those who took part in the work of translation. To begin in chronological order, three persons in particular should be singled out from the great number of persons involved, most of them unknown to me. The first person to make my work known in translation in the U S A was probably my former pupil, Mylon Merriam of Washington DC. This led to many further translations, most of them intended for internal use in American government agencies. Later, Michael Wood of the University of Aberdeen in Scotland began a translation but this version was unfortunately never published. The present translation owes its existence most of all to Dr. H. Steward of the Graduate School of Geography, Clark University in Worcester, Mass. The latter's enthusiasm for the German edition of the book was such that his untiring efforts to overcome every linguistic, editorial and other relevant obstacle led him to the successful conception of this book. He and his assistants merit my very special thanks. I also wish to extend thanks once again to my former pupils and colleagues mentioned in the preface to the German edition. Some of the multicolor tables were produced free of charge by the Federal Office of Topography, Wabern-Berne. For this, too, the author extends his gratitude. Special thanks are also due to de Gruyter Publishers, Berlin, who never once lost patience during the lengthy period of publication. Above all I would like to thank my wife Viola for her unswerving and always excellent assistance. Erlenbach / Zurich January 1982\n\nEduard Imhof\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe making of maps is one of man's longest established intellectual endeavours and also one of his most complex, with scientific theory, graphical representation, geographical facts and practical considerations being blended together in an unending variety of ways. Moreover, these factors of age and complexity have also encouraged its practitioners and commentators to produce a copious body of literature for the enlightenment of their colleagues and map-users. However, despite these outpourings, there are very few works within the discipline of cartography which could be termed \"classics\"; i.e. those writings which are not only landmarks when they appear, but remain of interest, relevance and inspiration, even with the passage of time. Such a work is Professor Eduard Imhof's masterpiece on relief representation, Kartographische Geländedarstellung. Within this volume, Professor Imhof brings together the thought and experience of over half a century in a unique display of analysis and portrayal. In general, he serves as an outstanding example of the need for a cartographer to combine intellect and graphics in solving map design problems but the range, detail and what can only be termed the \"scientific artistry\" of his solutions are in a class by themselves and certainly no other cartographer has presented the results of his labors in such an extended fashion within, in the broadest sense of the expression, a teaching context. The locale of his examples is mostly the terrain of his native Switzerland but his approach to the problem is of universal significance. Thus, despite still-continuing investigations into the theoretical bases of cartographic relief and the ever-ramifying influence of photogrammetry and computer manipulations alongside the newer fields of perceptional research, Professor Imhof's book retains its uniqueness as a focus, a summary and a synthesis of the many factors involved in this perennial map-making task. The desirability of having an English language version of this volume was apparent upon publication and an early attempt was made by the, then, United States Army Map Service. This ceased in 1967 when the Army manuscript was passed to an English publisher (Methuen). Further work was then performed upon it by Mr. Michael Wood of the Geography Department, University of Aberdeen, and this was eventually passed to the original copyright owners, Walter de Gruyter of Berlin. New translation and editing was then performed by Dr. Reiner Rummel, Dr. Romin Koebel and Dr. Harry Steward, all at that time\n\nVIII\n\nIntroduction\n\nassociated with Ohio State University. Acknowledgements of the final work rest with all of the above rather than with any one individual. It should be noted that complete equivalence of the surprisingly large vocabulary of cartography between English and German is often difficult to achieve (see, for example, International Cartographic Association's Multilingual Dictionary of Technical Terms, which represents a still-uncompleted task) to say nothing of the associated areas in geography, geology, technology, and so on. Nevertheless, Professor Imhof's forthright commentary and style of analysis comes over well and backed by his incomparable illustrations forms an exercise in cartographic communication now rightly available to a wider audience.

Already this map shows mountains; portrayed from the side, as they would be seen when looking up from a valley. Such lateral portrayals appear, again, in the maps of medieval monks, and in PortoIan charts and in copies of lost Ptolemaeic and Roman maps. They were generously employed during the Renaissance, when cartography began to flourish, and they prevailed in many subsequent maps up to the end of the 18th century. Even today we still occasionally come across this easily understood graphic form. Thus, a method of representation, corresponding directly to the natural appearance of the terrain, to the rise and fall of the profile of the land, was maintained throughout the centuries. In these early days, there existed neither the requirement nor the technical capability for depicting mountains more precisely and in plan form. In their figurative details, maps were pictures of scenes, as were other representations of the landscape. They may even have been the earliest landscape sketches, with little pictures of cities, castles, monasteries, forests and mountains shown juxtaposed or even overlapping upon a planimetrie representation of the Earth's surface. To begin with, mountains on the oldest maps were merely hinted at, or included as watershed symbols or as decorative filling for empty spaces. Despite such representational constraints, remarkable variations and developments can be detected in the early cartographic portrayals of mountains; not only in the individual symbols themselves but also in their arrangement. In the maps of medieval monks we find every conceivable style and variation of the Gothic era; with heart-shaped, lancet-shaped, leaf-shaped, and arch-shaped mountain symbols. In 1910 Joseph Roger made a fine study (270) of such portrayals. However, the most common form of early cartographic mountain illustration remained the 'molehill': the simple, uniform, side view of a regularly rounded dome. (Figure 1). Even in the earliest maps these mountain symbols were arranged in rows. In each case they were turned, either perpendicular to the axis of the valley — from right to left — or up and down with respect to the plane of the image. (Figure 2). This can be seen even in the Babylonian earthenware plate map, mentioned above. In late medieval maps, we occasionally find symbols shaped like piles of stones, layered slabs or tablets. An impressive example of the latter appears in a map of the western Alps, in\n\n2\n\nHistorical Developments\n\na manuscript Ptolemy atlas, stemming from the year 1454, now in the Austrian National Library in Vienna. (Figure 7). Noteworthy here is what is, perhaps, the first use of lines defining the form of the slope, with the incorporation of imaginary oblique illumination. As a result of the inaccurate copying of maps and atlases, the rows of mountain silhouettes often became fused and overlapped; sometimes into brown or green tinted or hachured bands or rounded ridges. (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Amassing of rows of mountain symbols to form bands and rounded ridges.\n\nFigure 4. Mountain symbols, all placed upright*\n\nFigure 5. Areal grouping of mountain symbols, in the form of fish scales.\n\nFigure 6. Shadow hachuring and variations in the size and shape of mountain symbols. 16th Century.\n\nIn the 15th century, the arrangement, shown in Figure 2, gradually went out of use. Thereafter, individual mountain symbols were orientated according to the direction of view of the observer, without regard to the direction of the axis of the chain. (Figure 4). This constituted a significant advance in graphic technique. Areal agglomerations of the symbols, to indicate extended mountain masses, were also created to supplement the earlier indivi-\n\nHistorical Developments\n\n3\n\ndual symbols or rows of symbols. In this way the fish scale representation, shown in Figure 5, came into being. In addition to the domeshaped molehills, cone-shaped and, later, jagged pointed mountain outlines appeared. Modifications were then made to their shapes and sizes and, in this way, higher and lower ranges could be distinguished. Also, following the rules of perspective, the symbols in the foreground (at the bottom of the picture) were often made larger than those in the background (at the top of the picture). The symbols were often supplemented by lines suggesting form and shadow drawn mainly in the direction of slope. At this time the predominant custom was established of placing the shadow on the right-hand side, giving the impression of light from the left. (Figure 6). This is as far as graphic forms had developed by the end of the 15th century. The spiritual revival of the Renaissance period, however, soon demanded maps with more detail and on larger scales. An interest in the features of the natural environment was now awakening. In the 16th century, topographic survey methods, with compass, measuring chain and measuring cart, were to replace simple reconnaissance and elementary compilations, prepared from travellers' tales. Astronomical position determination and property survey had, of course, already been developed in ancient times. Now, however, baselines were measured for the purposes of producing maps, and from their end points, suitable landmarks, such as church steeples, were intersected graphically by observing the angles between the directions. Then, from the points constructed in this way, further observations were made to new positions. Also, a more realistic representation of landforms was to appear in maps when natural scientists and artists became interested in mountains. The earliest and most beautiful examples of this development are the maps of Tuscany, drawn by Leonardo da Vinci in 1502-1503 (Figure 8) (206). For the first time they show relief forms individually and continuously related, as if seen in an oblique, bird's-eye view. Leonardo's maps stand head and shoulders above the other maps of the time, as accomplishments of an artistic and technical genius. It was half a century before maps followed which contained symbols designed to approximate the natural shapes of mountains. Good examples of this type were Jost Murer's Karte des Zürichgaues (Map of the Canton of Zürich) (1566), at a medium scale of 1:56,000 (Figure 9) and Philipp Apian's (Philipp Bienewitz) Bayerische Landtafeln (Bavarian Maps) (1568), at a scale of about 1:144,000. In their graphic character, both these map series are outstanding examples of the art of the woodcut, which was brought to its peak in Southern Germany by Albrecht Dürer, Hans Holbein the Younger and others. They excel in the expressive power and clarity of their linear forms. From the point of view of historical development, the maps of Leonardo, Murer and Apian are of particular interest, with respect to topography. It is true that, in their maps, they continued to show mountains and mountain chains in the side view, as before. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, they were no longer uniform; no longer merely standardized shapes or symbols; they are now appearing graphically differentiated. Earlier maps gave the misleading impression of ubiquitous level ground and valley floors, devoid of any landforms, lying between isolated mountain symbols, the shapes of valleys and gently undulating ground not being shown. Now, however, the entire terrain was portrayed cohesively. Forests and the outlines of cultivated fields aided the impression by providing structure. The side views of extensive features were superseded by an oblique bird's-eye view. Slope lines and shadow hachures increased the three-dimensional impression.\n\n4\n\nHistorical D e v e l o p m e n t s\n\nAs a rule, the earliest printed maps — those of the 15th century — were woodcuts. Soon, however, copper engraving grew to be a strong rival to this graphic technique. In 1477, an edition of the Ptolemy Atlas, printed in Bologna, was engraved in copper. It was, in fact, the first printed edition of this atlas to appear anywhere. In 1576 a map prepared by Thomas Schöpf, showing the areas of the Authority of Berne at a scale of 1:130,000, was the first map to be engraved in copper in Switzerland. This followed the wood-cut prints of maps by Tschudi, in 1538, Stumpf, in 1548, Murer, in 1566 and others. The finer, smoother and\n\nA s pfi»r, i. 0Í\n\nm\n\nιΛΟΒτ®* :\n\n*\n\nWf Ί Ρ Γ\n\nTftyrf\n\nI I\n\nligifj\n\nFigure 7. T h e W e s t e r n Alps.

The character of maps was radically altered by this new graphic technique. However, with the improvement of content often came a deterioration of drawing skill; overrefinement and loss of clarity were the outcome. Schöpf's map lies far behind Murer's splendid woodcut in graphic and artistic quality. The greatest achievement to emerge from the great voyages of discovery and topographic progress of the 16th century was Mercator's World Atlas (1585). This atlas went into several new editions in the centuries which followed, and it also set the fashion for the topographical maps of the 17th century. In the art of terrain representation, however, Mercator contributed nothing which was substantially new.\n\nFigure 8. Leonardo da Vinci's map of Tuscany, 1502-1503, at half original scale. Relief features individually depicted and continuously related. Original in the Royal Library at Windsor.\n\nGeographic research and the techniques of trigonometric and topographical survey lead to further progress in the 17th and 18th centuries but this development did not follow a steadily ascending course, being characterized by great successes and failures. This may be inherent in the peculiar dual nature of cartography; it being a technology as well as an art. The technology progressed steadily; sometimes quickly, sometimes more slowly. The art, on the other hand, while occasionally reaching astonishing heights through the accomplishments of a few individuals, always sank back into the depths once more. A high point in the history of terrain representation was the Züricher Kantonskarte (Map of the Canton of Zurich), (1667), at a scale of 1:32,000, by Hans Conrad Gyger (1599—1674). (Figure 10), (88 and 126). With improved surveying equipment, by using graphic triangulation over considerable distances and by diligently surveying in detail, Gyger created, over a period of 30 years, some outstanding topographic base maps. So fine\n\n6\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nero» rê\n\n'Ι\n\n-,\n\n,\n\nM\n\nFigure 9. Jost Murers' map of Zürich Canton, 1566. Scale approximately 1:56,000.

Accuracy and density of surveyed points had forced his mountains into planimetrie form. For the first time in the evolution of maps the whole relief was deliberately depicted in the plan view. What is more, his map measuring about 5 square meters is an inspired work of art, presenting an outstanding vertical view of the landscape, rich with natural colors and three-dimensional realism. It is, in fact, the earliest 'relief map' in existence. This gem of Swiss cartography did not influence the mapmakers of the time, as it was kept hidden away as a military secret. Even had it been available, it could not have been reproduced by existing techniques. It took 200 years for Gyger's map to be superseded, in Switzerland, by maps of greater accuracy. In spite of the work of Leonardo, Murer, Apian, Gyger and others, terrain cartography remained unchanged until well into the 18th century, with its uniform and standardized side and oblique views of mountains. Only haltingly and invariably through the pressure of more accurate surveys did a planimetrie representation of mountains make an occasional appearance in maps. In the 18th century, the French were leaders in the field of cartography. France's political power and her military requirements accelerated development. Mathematics and physics reached the highest levels of development. The telescope, already in existence in the 17th century, was used in the national surveys. Improvements were made in the methods of geodetic survey and calculation, triangulation, and trigonometric, barometric and precise\n\n8\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nlevelling. Copper engraving reached its highest stage of development. The first modern national triangulation was completed in 1744 by César-François Cassini de Thury who was also responsible for launching its aftermath, the 1:86,400 scale \"Carte géométrique de la France\", (Geometric Map of France) published in 184 sheets between 1750 and 1815 and completed by his son Jacques-Dominique Cassini de Thury. (14 and 15). Although this, the most important map series of the 18th century brought no progress in terrain representation, it did pave the way for a planimetrie depiction of hills and mountains, through the accuracy of its other planimetrie detail. Thus we find, in the 18th century, the most varied of cartographic forms and stages of development existing side by side. New seeds, however, had been planted which later in the 19th century were to bear ripe fruit. The wholesale transition from side and oblique views of mountains to the planimetrie form for complete coverage of Switzerland took place in the maps of the Napoleonic military topographer Bacler d'Albe just before 1800, and in the so-called \"Meyer Atlas\", a 16 sheet series of Switzerland at a scale of 1:108,000. This series was surveyed and drawn by the Alsatian engineer, Johann Heinrich Weiss (1759-1826) and Joachim Eugen Müller (1752-1833) of Engelberg (Switzerland) for Johann Rudolf Meyer (1739-1813) of Aarau. Meyer then published these maps between 1786 and 1802. (Figure 12). This was one of the last undertakings of private topographic mapping. Increases in scale, in density of content and improvement in accuracy subsequently inflated costs and labor requirements to such an extent that, in the 19th century, basic topographic mapping could only be handled, as a rule by state institutions.\n\nFigure 11. A section of N. S. Cruquius' map of the Merwede river bed at original size (joint estuary of the Maas and Waal rivers). Scale 1:10,000. Published in Leiden in 1730. One of the earliest isobathic charts. The isobaths were constructed from soundings taken at low tide in July 1729.\n\nHistorical Developments\n\n9\n\nLet us turn again to the cartographic forms of terrain representation. With the transition to the planimetrically correct image an entirely new problem was presented to the mapmaker. At this time there was no means whereby mountains could be observed from above and so their true appearance was unknown. The then current reproduction process of copper engraving essentially limited suitable originals to line drawings in one color. On the other hand, the demands of geometry and content increased. This must be clearly realized if the developments of that time are to be understood. Thereafter, these developments followed various paths. The outline or mountain profile symbol had already been elaborated in the case of the side view and to an even greater extent in the case of the oblique bird's-eye-view by the addition of hachures. Normally, with these symbols, hachures were drawn down the line of steepest gradient, since the line of slope is an excellent indicator of form. This arrangement of hachuring was now also retained in the plan view symbol. Thus, all sloping areas were depicted by hachures showing lines of slope; the level parts of the terrain being, however, left unmarked. The steeper and more rugged a slope, the heavier and denser the hachuring. \"Wherever I can't go, let there be a blot\" were the instructions of Frederick the Great to his Prussian military topographers. The direct graphic imitation of familiar visual views of mountains was replaced by the fictitious convention \"the steeper, the thicker and darker the pattern of hachuring\". Examples of this technique of mountain representation appear in the above-mentioned Atlas der Schweiz by J. R. Meyer (Figure 12). In the \"high Alpine\" sections of this atlas, the\n\nFigure 12.

Terrain representation by irregular random hachuring.\n\n10\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nhachuring is cluttered and confusing and any realistic three-dimensional impression is lacking. It is to the credit of the Saxon military topographer, Johann Georg Lehmann, that he brought order into this hachuring chaos. In the year 1799 he developed a system of slope hachuring (187 and 188). Subsequently he put this system to the practical test in various topographical maps, an example of which is shown in Figure 13. In Chapter 10 there is a detailed description of this system. Here only the salient points are considered. Lehmann drew each hachure line in the direction of the line of slope, as had many of his predecessors. He broke these hachures into sections, so that a fairly even spacing could be maintained over every part of the map where slopes lay in different directions. These individual sections, the so called \"slope hachures\", were arranged in such a way that their end-points (upper and lower) lay on what were assumed to be contour lines with regular vertical intervals. Gentle, almost flat, terrain received long hachures, and the steep terrain, short hachures. The thickness of the hachure lines was varied in proportion to the angle of slope, so that steep gradients appeared dark from the accumulation of heavy hachures, and gentle slopes with fine hachures appeared lighter. A hachuring system such as this permitted the easy identification of both the direction of slope, and the transition from level ground to steep gradients. It could be drawn and engraved by all cartographers in a uniform, objective and non-arbitrary way. This hachuring technique was applied, in many varied ways, in most of the topographic map series of Europe. It became the common method of depiction in the last century and continues to appear in numerous maps until the middle of the 20th century.\n\nFigure 13. \"Drawing of a high and steep mountain region viewed and illuminated vertically\".

Section of the map shown here at original scale. Terrain representation by means of hachuring using the principle \"the steeper, the darker\".\n\nHistorical Developments\n\n11\n\nIn France, Switzerland and to a certain extent in Italy, developments took a different turn towards the end of the 18th century and during the first half of the 19th century. Here, too, the technique of copper engraving led to the introduction of hachuring. Predecessors of hachures appear in French bird's-eye-view maps (oblique views), in which mountain shapes were clearly defined by outlines, slope lines and by lighting from the left. It was reasonable, also, to retain \"left-illumination\" for hachures in planimetrie representations. For this impression, the sections of the slope lines were drawn very finely, on the illuminated slopes of the mountains — normally the north-west sides - and very heavily on the shaded slopes. This produced a three-dimensional impression, reminiscent of obliquely lit terrain models and was especially effective for mountain regions with many valleys and sharp ridge crests. One of the earliest examples of this type was the \" C a r t e topographique de l'île de Corse au 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 e \" which appeared in 1824. The next evolutionary step was the combination of this shaded, three-dimensional grading of the thickness of the lines with Lehmann's arrangement of hachures, and thus the so-called 'shadow hachure' was created. The most significant example of a map with shadow hachures was the \"Topographische Karte der Schweiz 1 : 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 \" , (Topographie map of Switzerland 1 : 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 ) or the so-called \" D u f o u r k a r t e \" , (Dufour map) (Figure 14) which appeared between 1842 and 1864. This map series, of 24 sheets, is considered to be the finest and clearest map of any high mountain region to have appeared in the last century. The method of shadow hachures was in use until the middle of our century as the representational style of many national and private maps, and it has largely superseded slope hachures in small scale maps. This is confirmed by its use in the outstanding terrain engravings appearing in the 8th Edition ( 1 8 8 8 - 1 8 9 1 ) and 9th Edition ( 1 9 0 0 - 1 9 0 5 ) (Figure 152) of Stielers Handatlas, and in Vogels Karte des Deutschen Reiches (Vogel's M a p of the German Empire) (1891—1893) at 1:500,000. The terrain drawing in the latter was executed by Hermann Habenicht ( 1 8 4 4 - 1 9 1 7 ) , Carl Vogel ( 1 8 2 8 - 1 8 9 7 ) and Otto Koffmahn ( 1 8 5 1 - 1 9 1 6 ) , (91, 113 and 309). The advantages and disadvantages of slope hachures and shadow hachures were discussed passionately for decades by map critics of the last century without influencing the practice of cartography in one direction or the other. While maps of both types were dominating the scene side by side for almost one hundred years, a new graphic and topographic form developed. This was the contour and depth contour, which has become quite an indispensible element in cartography today, and finally banished the hachure technique almost completely. For a long time mariners have had need of maps which facilitated the identification of shallow waters. For this reason the figures for depth soundings were included on their maps. It was a very short step from such depth-sounding maps to the depth contour map or isobathic chart. One merely had to connect adjacent points of equal depth. The clarity and usefulness of the maps were thus increased by limiting the information to lines of equal vertical interval, each one representing a particular depth. The earlist representation of isobaths discovered so far is found in a manuscript map, dated 1584, of the surveyor Pieter Bruinss. This map, quite astonishing for its time, shows a 7-foot depth line off Het Spaarne, near Haarlem (70). Later, in Rotterdam in 1697, manuscript isobathic charts were produced by Pierre Ancelin showing the Meuse with depth contours from 5 to 5 feet. Similar attempts followed in France and again in Holland. In 1725, Luigi de Marsigli issued his \"Histoire physique de la m e r \" (Physical History of the Sea), and attached to this work was a \" C a r t e du Golfe du L i o n \" which had depth contours.\n\n12\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nSoon after, in 1730, there appeared the famous copper engraved isobathic chart of Nicolaas Samuel Cruquius, showing the stream bed of the Merwede. (Figure 11). Philippe Buache followed him, in 1737, with his map of La Manche (the English Channel, between southern England and France). In 1771 du Carla created the first contour map of an imaginary island — and finally, in 1791 Dupain-Triel compiled the first contour map of an existing land surface, that of France. (Illustrations of the earliest contour and depth contour maps are found in Reference 50). Contours were thus already known, as the hachuring techniques, described above, were being developed. Naturally, they did not come into general practice until topographic surveys had made sufficient progress and this did not occur before the beginning of the 19th century. The contour is also primarily ficticious in character. It does, however, possess the extraordinary advantage of recording and conveying, in a satisfactory manner, the geometric form of the terrain, elevations, differences in elevation, the angles and directions of slopes, and so Further advances led to methods of representation which are still in use today and, hence, they will be discussed, in detail, in a number of the chapters of this book, historical references being made where necessary. For this reason, developments which have taken place since the middle of the last century are given here in outline only. In the course of the last hundred years, greater and greater demands were made on the content, accuracy and hence on the scale of maps. The classical surveying methods of the\n\nFigure 14.

First of all photogrammetry, and especially aerial photogrammetry provided the necessary increases in speed and accuracy. These new methods, developed from about 1920 provided data primarily in the form of contours. For some considerable time before this, however, another technical innovation had radically transformed the external appearance of many maps. In the year 1796, Alois Senefelder had invented lithography in Munich, but it is only since 1825, or, more generally, since 1840, that it has been employed in the reproduction of maps. This technique made possible, or, at least, facilitated the production of multicolored maps. Now, as a result, hachures could be contrasted more clearly with the other elements of the map by printing them in brown while, with brown, black and blue contours, the various types of ground surface (earth, rock, glacier) could be distinguished. Lithography soon brought about the replacement of hachures by shadow or shading tones and made it possible to print area tones in color. Hence, in the second half of the 19th century, a wide variety of maps appeared with regional area coloring, with hypsometric tints and with naturalistic and symbolic landscape tints. Multi-color printing permitted every possible combination of the individual elements described. Contours had been combined with hachures as early as about the middle of the 19th century. First example: J.M. Ziegler's (1801—1882) topographic map of the cantons of St. Gallen and Appenzell, published at 1:25,000, in 1849-1852. The combination of contours and oblique hill shading, a form of representation which enjoys great popularity today, is found in Swiss topographic maps as far back as 1864 and 1865. Examples appear in an official map of the canton of Lucerne, at 1:25,000, and in an excursion map of the Medelser Group, at 1:50,000 published by the Swiss Alpine Club. Soon, contours, hachures or shading were also to be combined with hypsometric tints. The finest achievements of these printing capabilities were the so-called \"Reliefkarten\", developed in Switzerland from about 1870. They incorporate combinations of contour lines, rock drawing, shading — which achieves its three-dimensional effect from the assumption of a lateral light source - and natural, \"aerial perspective color tones.\" In the last century the topographic mapping of the large European countries was accomplished primarily by military personnel who were assigned to the task, and thus often by inexperienced topographers. For that reason simple graphic rules were preferred. Most national map series comprised hundreds or even thousands of map sheets, which had to be as standardized as possible. However, standardization or uniformity in maps, often persisting for decades, did little to further the progress of graphic methodology. In Switzerland, on the other hand, the federalism of small states and the demands of Alpine hikers led to a large diversity of solutions. Here, artistically talented topographers and lithographers, such as Rudolf Leuzinger (1826-1896), Xaver Imfeld (1853-1909), Fridolin Becker (1854-1922) and Hermann Kümmerly (1857-1905) were free to release their energy and skills. Thus, in the 19th century, Switzerland became a field of experimentation in the cartographic representation of the terrain, with emphasis on three-dimensional effects and the greatest possible similarity to nature. This situation was also partly derived from the diversity and beauty of the Swiss landscape. Development has continued for some time now. What had been accomplished was expanded, theoretically and practically; and new paths were taken. In many respects, today, we are in the middle of a revolution in cartographic terrain representation. The objects of this revolution and what has gone before will be discussed in the chapters which follow.\n\n14\n\nHistorical Developments\n\nReferences: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 36, 42, 43, 45, 49, 50, 64,70, 87, 88, 9 0 , 1 1 3 , 1 2 2 , 126, 127, 129, 130, 146, 148, 149, 171, 177, 182, 184, 187, 188, 189, 191, 206, 209, 214, 219, 226, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 269, 270, 279, 284, 285, 299, 305, 310, 319, 320.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\nTopographic surveys form the basis of all terrain cartography or, for that matter, any cartography at all. In topographic survey there is an intermingling of survey technique and representation. The topographer is surveyor and cartographer at one and the same time. Questions, for instance, of contour intervals, of the introduction of intermediate contours, of spot heights, and so on, are of as much concern to the survey as to the design of the image. Despite such a close connection, it is not the purpose of this book to go into the details of survey methods. A few points of information, however, may not be out of place; for even those cartographers who are not themselves topographers, map compilers or specialists in map design, for instance, require some knowledge of survey methods, and above all of the achievable survey accuracies. All respectable cartographic work presupposes a certain critical analysis of the base maps being employed, their content, reliability and peculiarities. Questions concerning the generalization of contour lines, for example, can only be discussed profitably oricé%urvey accuracy has been considered.\n\nA. Methods of topographic survey All recent topographic surveys present the form of the earth's surface through spot-heights, certain edge or major form lines, but primarily by contours. We will return in later chapters to deal with these modes of expression in detail. At this stage, spot heights, contours and contour interval are assumed to be familiar concepts.\n\n1. Plane-table survey or plane-table tacheometry Plane table survey, also known as plane table tacheometry, is the classical method of topographic land survey. In this case the topographer bases his work on a triangulation net which is already in existence. This system of permanently marked and accurately deter-\n\n16\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\nmined ground control is densified, as a rule, by graphic triangulation of detail, or traversing. The positions and heights of other control points are determined from the initial point using plane table and alidade, by sighting and plotting directions, by observing vertical angles and by measuring distances optically; these are then plotted on to the plane table sheet. With reference to these points, the contour lines are drawn directly from nature. A good topographer chooses, in the first instance, points which lie at breaks in the slope and points of inflexion so that the portion of ground situated between every three to four adjacent points has as little curvature as possible. In this way, uncertainties arising from estimation are significantly reduced. In the large-scale survey of moderately steep terrain, survey points are frequently selected on certain contour lines; that is, these lines are directly sought out. In the last century, the topographic maps of most European countries were surveyed mainly with the plane table; for that reason they are, even today, often called \"plane-table sheets.\" The most common survey scales at that time were 1:50,000 and 1:25,000. Around the middle of the last century, for example, only about 2 to 3 points were surveyed per square kilometer for the 1:50,000 scale mapping (115 and 116) of many parts of the high mountain regions of Switzerland. The detailed formation of the contour pattern was accomplished by visual interpolation. But demands on the map and on its accuracy increased with the passage of time. This also gave rise to an enlargement of the survey scale and in the number of surveyed points. In many places today, mapping is carried out at scales of 1:10,000 or 1:5,000, and for special purposes even 1:1,000 and 1:500. In these latter two cases, sometimes up to four points are surveyed per 100 square meters, giving about 40,000 points per square kilometer. The quality of plane table surveys depends, however, not only on the number, the intelligent selection, and the accuracy of surveyed points on the ground, but also, in large measure, on the topographer's gift for observation and understanding and experience of land forms. Such individual capabilities were especially significant earlier, at the time of small survey scales with a low density of surveyed points, and many maps of the 19th century reflect the characteristic \"signature\" of the maker. Today, in general, the plane table method has been largely overtaken by photogrammetry. In many cases, however, it still manages to hold its own. It offers the inestimable advantage of direct visual contact with the terrain; although because of this it finds its widest application in testing the content of, and supplementing, photogrammetric surveys. Furthermore, it is still a rational method for the survey of smaller areas.\n\n2. Tacheometrie survey Theodolite- and compass-tacheometers of various types are the instruments used. The process is for that reason called theodolite- or compass-tacheometry. It differs from the plane table method in that the survey data are not kept in graphic form, but initially noted in field books. In particular, the directions to surveyed points are kept numerically rather than graphically. The numerical tables thus obtained along with a detailed field sketch provide the drawing office with the material for the graphic construction of the map. Contour lines are drawn up by interpolation between the surveyed terrain points and with the guidance of the sketch. The lack of a direct visual check on the ground is a disadvantage here. The field sketch must, therefore, be made with the greatest care. Furthermore, the method demands particularly skillfull selection of the points to be surveyed.\n\nA. Methods of topographic survey\n\n17\n\nThere are differing opinions as to which of the methods, plane-table method or tacheometrie, is better. The latter may well appear more economic and less dependent on weather; the former, however, gives rise to more reliable, accurate, and above all, more characteristic terrain images.\n\n3. Levelling On the basis of a previously established plan, or on a net of rectangular coordinates laid out on the ground, the elevations of all horizontal control points are determined by levelling. With the help of a field sketch and the levelled spot heights, the contours are then interpolated as in tacheometry. Often aerial photographs are also used for plotting the spot heights. Levelling is limited, almost exclusively, to small areas of flat, gently undulating land, and to very large scales; but in these circumstances it leads to good results.\n\n4. Photogrammetry By this term we understand mapping by the taking of, and measuring from, photographs of the terrain. Photographs from suitably located ground stations or from aircraft can be used. In the first case, we speak of terrestrial photogrammetry, in the second case of aerial photogrammetry. In terrestrial photogrammetry, one usually selects two survey stations, close to one another and at approximately the same elevation, surveyed both horizontally and vertically. Then photographs are taken along parallel lines of sight and approximately transverse to a line joining the two stations. Thus, both photographs show essentially one and the same piece of terrain. When observed stereoscopically such a pair of photographs produces a spatial threedimensional model. The photographic instrument employed is the photo-theodolite. Aerial photogrammetry utilizes, as its name implies, air-photographs, which, for the most part, are vertical images but also can be convergent or oblique. Special cameras are installed in the survey aircraft to take the pictures. During flight, strips of overlapping aerial photographs are usually taken. The photo scale is dependent on the desired accuracy, the scale of the maps, and on the equipment available for plotting. Flying height is a function of the image scale, the principal distance of the camera and the range of the aircraft available. The photographic scales for civilian purposes lie between about 1:3,000 to 1:100,000, the corresponding flying heights between 500 meters and 9,000 meters above the ground. Large photographic scales provide for the production of plans and those at a scale from about 1:20,000 to 1:100,000 are for the production of topographic maps. Further information on air-photography and its qualities are discussed in Chapter 3. The plotting of the photographs - terrestrial as well as aerial - is done with special equipment in the office. In the plotter, the two photographs of the same piece of ground, the so-called \"photo-pair\", are brought into the same spatial positions, relative to each other, that they had when the photographs were taken, and then the air-base (the distance between the two points from which the photos were taken) is reduced according to the desired scale of the map. Simultaneous observation of both images in a stereoscope produces a realistic model of the terrain. This model can be enlarged or reduced, and rotated around three axes perpendicular to one another. Such adjustment for a desired scale and a desired position\n\n18\n\nThe Topographie Foundations\n\nallows the coordinates of a sufficient number of points in the model to be brought into agreement with the coordinates of the same points as they were obtained in the field by geodetic survey. For each common overlap in a photo-pair, the position and elevation of at least two points and the height of one additional point must be known, or more generally speaking, seven independent elements are required. T o avoid having to determine too many orientation points, special methods were developed for aerial photogrammetry. These are designated aerial triangulation or aerial traversing. When the stereo model has been adjusted in the plotting instrument, it is scanned with a floating mark, and the planimetry of the movement of the floating mark is transmitted to a plotting table. The vertical movement of the floating mark can be locked in any position while its horizontal movements remain free. If the terrain model is then scanned in the correct way with the vertical movement locked, the floating mark traces a contour line. Photogrammetry gives us the entire extent of all terrain lines, terrain edges, stream lines, contour lines, roads, railroads, etc. that are visible in both images of a photo-pair. The details thus obtained are therefore, as a rule, more accurate and more characteristic than features surveyed point by point and interpolated by way of plane-table and tacheometrie methods. The gain in quality is so marked that the photogrammetric contour lines are called \"objective\" or \"exact\", in opposition to the \"subjective\" contour lines of the plane table. Such a comparison of values is not completely to the point however. Even photogrammetric plotting must — at least for the present — rely upon the human senses. These senses, however, are always limited in their efficiency both in stereoscopic viewing and in guiding the floating mark. Both processes are encumbered by personal errors. In addition, errors arise through thick ground cover and for other reasons. Consequently, photogrammetric contour lines are, in certain cases and to a certain degree, objectively and subjectively inaccurate. We will return to this subject in Section B8 of this chapter. The need to check and supplement photogrammetric mapping by topographers in the field cannot be avoided. Many things can only be properly recognized and evaluated on the ground and from another viewpoint. On the whole, however, photogrammetry has led to extraordinary progress in topographic mapping from the qualitative as well as the quantitative and economic points of view. Aerial photogrammetry places completely new survey material of extensive, inaccessible and, as yet, poorly mapped regions in the cartographer's hands in the shortest possible time. It changes our knowledge of the earth's surface in a fundamental way. Terrestrial photogrammetry, an early development, has been widely overshadowed by aerial photogrammetry today. However, it still has its uses in special cases, as for example in the surveying of steep alpine slopes, and for various purposes not related to topography.\n\nB . Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\nThe results of the topographic survey of terrain surfaces are expressed cartographically by spot heights, by the planimetry of certain edge lines (drainage lines; edges of rocks, etc.), but, above all, by contour lines showing heights and depths. The question of the accuracy or reliability, or more generally, the quality of these elements must be considered.\n\nΒ. Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\n19\n\nSpot heights, edge lines and contour lines will be treated separately within this question, their measurement and their graphic reproduction being carried out employing different accuracies.\n\n1. Positional and height accuracy of surveyed points The spatial position of a point, obtained by survey and calculation, can be expressed by the horizontal coordinates x, y, and by the elevation h in a three-dimensional, rectangular coordinate system. On a map, χ and y are indicated by their graphic location; the elevation by the added spot height value. The positional error, that is, the deviation of the mapping result from the actual ( \" t r u e \" ) location of the point, is likewise referred to these three coordinate directions or distributed among them. These three actual or \"true\" errors εχ, ey, and εΗ are, strictly speaking, never known, since it is never possible to measure any quantity with absolute accuracy. Instead of the true values, certain control values or adjusted values obtained from a large number of measurements of the same desired magnitude quantity. These are called the most probable values. They can also be the results of measurements taken with significantly higher accuracy (better instruments and methods of survey although usually with increased costs). Under certain circumstances, the accuracy or reliability of any survey result can be increased by measuring the questionable values a number of times. For similar and independently observed individual measurements their arithmetical mean, A, is taken to be the most probable value (final result). Both the individual measurements l p l 2 , l 3 , etc. as well as their mean value A are considered to be more accurate the smaller the \"scatter\" of the individual survey results ( l „ l 2 ,etc.). As a measure of quality or reliability, and at the same time as mark of certification for the surveys, the so-called \"mean error\" is selected as a rule. The mean error ml of an individual measurement I is defined (transcribed according to its significance) by the formula:\n\nIn this case, the terms are: e t = true error of the individual measurement I, etc. η = number of individual measurements A s already mentioned, however, the true errors e are not known to us. We therefore use a substitute or approximation formula for the calculation of m^ This is\n\nHere we have, Vj = difference between an individual measurement I and the arithmetic mean A of all measurements. η = number of individual measurements (as above). This formula is arrived at by way of certain knowledge (not discussed here) of the theory of errors in the field of mathematical statistics. It yields approximate (best possible) values for m l — and it is used therefore for calculating the average error.\n\n20\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\nThe arithmetic mean A of the measured values l 2 ,1 3 etc. is obviously all the more accurate, (i.e. its mean error M A is smaller) the more exact the individual measurements I,, l 2 , l 3 , etc. are (its mean error m l is smaller). Furthermore, the greater the number η of individual measurements, the more accurate the result. The accuracy of A however does not increase in proportion to the number of individual measurements, but rather more slowly, since it grows only at a rate proportional to the square root of the number of measurements. These relationships are expressed by the following formula: V5 For combined measurement and calculation operations, analogous formulae are operative but the accuracy calculations are then considerably more complicated. The mean errors m and M only express (and this is re-emphasized) measures of the accuracy or reliability of quantities. They allow us to see approximately how large the accidental deviations of the survey results may be. A large v, that is, the difference between the arithmetic mean A and an individual measurement I can be double or even triple the mean error m l despite careful measurement, without any gross error being involved. Only when ν is larger than 3 m t is a gross error suspected and the measurement involved disqualified, i.e., eliminated. In order to be able to estimate the accuracy of today's plans and maps, the following has to be considered. a) In printed plans and maps, the positional accuracy of a point is dependent on the survey accuracy (see below) and on the accuracy with which the position, surveyed in the field, can be reproduced by the plotting and printing processes. The smaller the scale, the less the importance which is attached to errors in survey as opposed to errors in graphic reproduction. Thus, in maps of scales of 1:25,000 and smaller, which were based on surveys using modern photogrammetric methods, the mean drawing and scribing error (about 0.2 mm) is often larger than all survey and technical errors put together. b) In judging the surveying accuracy, we must distinguish between absolute and relative positional and height accuracies of the points. The absolute accuracy of a point, as a rule, is expressed by the mean errors of its three coordinates in a system of coordinates on which the survey in question is based. The relative accuracy, in contrast, deals with the position and elevation of adjacent points with regard to one another. Errors, found at all points under consideration as a whole, are ignored here. Since determination of position is independent of the determination of height as a rule, mean errors of position and height are given separately. The tables below give, for easily identifiable points, the mean errors in position and height as they can be attained today in properly conducted geodetic, photogrammetric and topographic surveys (p. 21-22). As already stressed, amounts of individual errors may reach up to three times the amount of the mean error without being referred to here as a gross error. If a plan at 1:10,000 has a mean height error of m H = ± 0.4 meters, individual points on the plan may show errors of up to about 1.2 meters. As the tables show, the height errors of spot heights in plane table and tacheometrie methods are, in general, smaller than those obtained by photogrammetry. For the latter method, however, they are, as a rule, more or less constant across the entire area surveyed. In plane table and tacheometrie methods, on the other hand, they increase somewhat with increasing distance from given triangulation points.\n\nΒ. Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\n21\n\n1.

Horizontal position errors are of little significance here. A careful determination and plotting of the elevations of stream junctions, crossroads, etc. are of special interest. Generally, points on roads can be surveyed more accurately by aerial photogrammetry than points in the open fields. Occasionally, systematic errors appear, that is, those which render all values incorrect in the same way. These include the so-called datum error. If the initial height of a survey is given an incorrect value, the error is carried over to all elevations. If the map as a whole is uniformly in error in such a fashion, no disadvantages result from it in regional use. A known example of this is provided by the Swiss Map Series of the last century. It shows the total surface of Switzerland as about 3.26 meters too high. Gross errors, that is, those which amount to more than three times the mean error, are usually the result of confusing terrain points or measuring and collimating marks, or they can be traced to booking errors or other mistakes. They are to be counted among the sins of many a topographic beginner. In good topographic plans and maps, gross errors are seldom to be found, since the experienced topographer will, through visual control alone, discover and eliminate such trouble spots which do not fit properly into their surroundings. In summary, it is established that modern, correctly conducted surveys furnish spot heights which are generally adequate for cartographic requirements. Horizontal errors of position in survey are usually smaller than the unavoidable inaccuracies in drawing. The spot heights, at least in surveys at the scale 1:10,000 or larger, are accurate generally to within 1 or 2 meters.\n\n2. The accuracy of edge lines Edge lines, such as drainage lines, shorelines, terrace edges, rock edges, edges of ditches, moraine ridge lines, etc. are topographic guidelines. They provide the topographer with an aid in constructing arrays of contour lines, but they are also of special significance for the map user. They are normally established on the basis of a large selection of surveyed points, or are determined photogrammetrically with greatest care. In photogrammetric surveys, edge lines generally achieve almost drawing accuracy standards. They seldom deviate from the correct position by more than about 0.3 to 0.6 millimeters depending on the scale. As a result of such accuracies, the lines are usually very true to character.\n\nΒ. Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\n23\n\nUsing point-by-point survey with plane table or tacheometer, the edge lines are plotted by visual estimation which may then, of course, lead to large errors in form and, in large-scale plans, to local displacements of several millimeters.\n\n3. The examination of contour lines For decades, geodesists and topographers have been concerned about the lack of a good method for the testing of accuracies, or, more generally, of the examination of the quality of groups of cartographic contours. They have sought a method which is sufficiently simple, covers all the essential aspects, and which renders the results of these examinations with appropriate clarity. However, the ideal solution has yet to be found and any attempt to expand on the matter falls outside the scope of a book on cartography. We will attempt only to sketch out some of the paths which have been followed up to now, and to outline special aspects of the problem. The problem is as follows: we wish to compare, with one another, two different, and, as a rule, extremely complex surfaces which cannot be expressed by mathematical formulae. One of these surfaces is the actual surface of the earth's surface, i.e. a part of it, reduced mentally to the scale of the map to be studied. The other surface is formed by the contour image of the corresponding map which is to be studied. As a result of mapping deficiencies, these two areas do not match each other exactly. We wish to be able to judge the nature and extent of these variations. The first of these surfaces is never exactly known to us since even the most precise comparative or test survey is always accompanied by smaller or larger errors. The second surface, apart from inherent mapping errors, is never completely defined. The bands of contour lines form a lattice with intermediate spaces. Between each two consecutive contour lines, the position of the surface is uncertain unless we presume a straight-line slope gradient, an assumption which is, in general, less probable, the greater the contour interval. How can we compare an incompletely defined surface with an area which itself cannot be determined exactly? For better or worse, we employ approximate or partial examinations with the comparison of individual elements or aspects. We limit ourselves, so to speak, to random checks. We can, for example, survey several selected test areas in differing terrain at very large scale with very small contour interval and the greatest possible accuracy. Accuracy must, in this case, be so improved that the results of the survey can be considered as the true contour map of the test area being used. This contour line image is then compared with the contours to be checked. Such a method has proven to be very costly, so that up to now it has been used only occasionally for methodical experiments. (We are not referring here to investigations of historical maps in which older maps are checked in this manner by comparing them with corresponding modern, more accurate surveys.) The labor and cost involved are not the only disadvantages of such techniques of testing. There are still others. One special difficulty appears in what follows: The differences between the image to be checked and the control image should not be evaluated quantitatively, for dimension only, but also for nature and quality. This is illustrated with the help of Figure 15.\n\n24\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\ncontrol contour K-K a false contour A-A another false contour B-B\n\nFigure 15. Two different false\n\nHours and a control contour.\n\nThis figure shows the same section of a contour line three times. The control contour K-K is assumed to be free of error in shape and position (within drawing accuracy). Although containing errors, the contour A-A fits well to the main form of the contour KK, with little deviation although all the small details are omitted. The incorrect contour B-B, on the other hand, shows considerable deviation from the broad form K-K, but is very accurate in the smaller details. Which, then, is more important? Which of the two virtues is more valuable? Which of the transgressions should be more sharply condemned? This is a matter of judgment from one case to another, which can be answered only with due consideration of the main purpose for which the map will be used. As a rule, the more true-to-form arrangement is better suited to the hiker, the mountaineer, the soldier, and above all the geomorphologist, while the line with good positional accuracy is better for the construction engineer and the survey technician. In contrast to most geodetic considerations, concepts of error and quality in the topographic-cartographic field can be ambiguous, not always being satisfied by measureable quantities. The critical examination depends on quantities and qualities of various types, and is therefore not free of a certain degree of subjectivity. This arises also from a further characteristic of many cartographic contour lines. Many contour lines, particularly in boulder strewn areas, highly dissected regions, rocky regions, Karren, glacier surfaces, areas of dunes, etc., would appear confusingly complex if the highest possible accuracies of technical survey and drawing were applied. In such instances the contour line images are often slightly simplified during survey. On what basis, then, should checks be made in cases like these? Should one employ the most objective precise form possible for comparison; or its more subjective, simplified form, adjusted for cartographic clarity? If the concept of a \"check\" means the same as the determination of quality or of usefulness, then it is only reasonable to select the simplified form. The solution of a mathematical problem is either right or wrong, but the solution of a problem in cartography is, within certain limits, only good or bad! No matter how ingeniously devised, the value of any formula for testing accuracy will be reduced by such factors as the incompleteness of controls, the series of simplifying assumptions, subjective judgments, the influence of map purpose and above all, in the acceptance of essential or merely desired simplifications of the contour line image in the first place. The simplest and best check, and probably the only one which contains all essential aspects, is derived from well designed control measurements or control surveys in combination with\n\nΒ. Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\n25\n\ncareful visual comparison of map and ground. The person conducting the test should be an experienced topographer and a good observer and, moreover, he should also pay attention to the geomorphological context. Before we turn to the various types of errors, two things must still be made clear. a) It is occasionally claimed that the accuracy of contour lines is independent of the contour interval. Theoretically and often also practically, (think of isolated contour lines in flat plains or of the photogrammetric plotting process), this is indeed, largely true. On the other hand, one cannot overlook that in surveys of steep terrain, even in photogrammetric plotting, the contour lines are drawn more carefully, positioned more accurately, and are more finely detailed, the smaller the contour interval chosen. Good or bad surroundings are not without influence. A plane-table topographer, moreover, never treats lines individually and independent of each other, he is always aware of surface form and thus of complete contour groupings. In any case, the evaluation of cartometric accuracy is dependent upon the contour interval. Terrain surfaces and slope profiles, even the elevation of spot heights, can be read more accurately from the map the smaller the contour interval. b) A difficulty, more theoretical than practical in character, exists, in many places, of the coordination of points when two corresponding contour line images are compared. Imagine a section of a contour located in both the control map and the map under investigation (Figure 16). Both maps are brought into coincidence with the aid of their coordinate grids or of known control points. Identical points on contour lines can only be matched with reliability at inflection points on lines (A, A ' ) and when they can be clearly located by ground features like, for example, path (Β, B'). No other points will suffice. In certain techniques of investigation, it is assumed, for the sake of simplicity, that the corresponding points lie on perpendiculars to the contour lines, that is, on vertical trajectories. Points of intersection of such trajectories with the two contour lines would thus designate corresponding points. This may be the case. In quite a few places, however, buildings or terrain features indicate that this is not always true. In the immediate vicinity of sharp bends in the contour lines, there are no vertical trajectories at all.\n\nFigure 16. Identical points on an incorrect contour line and a control contour line.\n\n26\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\n4. Types of errors in contour lines Errors are divided into those of a geometrical nature and those arising from origin and local grouping discussed briefly below: a) Errors in the geometric components. Every kind of possible error in contour lines haunt the literature of topography. For example: positional errors height errors errors in shape direction errors curvature errors errors in lengths slope errors Up to the present, primary interest has been in height errors in contour lines. Also this concept is often to be found in official tolerance regulations, but it is, however, pointless and the cause of much confusion. Contour lines are fictious, auxiliary lines assumed to lie at certain elevations. They form, so to speak, measuring scales. Their elevations are fixed and expressed in the map by the numbered contour lines and the contour interval. Contour lines in the flat, two-dimensional map, like any other cartographic line, can be wrong solely in position. Only on the surfaces of poorly stamped three-dimensional terrain models and on the working model used for plotting by the photogrammetrist do the contour lines run up and down like roller coasters. However, the reasons for the above criticism of this concept are more likely to have arisen from a confusion of words and meanings than from faulty reasoning. In other words what is said is not what is meant! Thus, \"height error in the contour line\" does not mean this but rather \"error in the height of any ground point obtained from the contour map.\" This can be shortened to \"heighting errors of contours\" but this obscures the fact that error can only exist in the planimetry. This is true even in the special case of an incorrect datum level. Even the datum error only affects the correctness of the position of the contour lines. One can only speak of height errors in the contour lines if the numbered contours are wrongly labelled. The translation of the ominous \"height error f h of the contour\" to the corresponding positional error fjCor vice versa) is now, of course, very simple, since the following relationship exists: fh — = tan α fi Here α is the slope angle at the point under observation. Errors of shape, direction error, curvature error, and error in lengths of the contour lines are the direct consequences of positional errors. The contour line consists, as it were, of a continuous sequence of an infinite number of infinitely close adjacent points. If all points are positioned correctly, the shapes, directions, curvatures, and lengths of line sections are free of error. From the horizontal errors of close, adjacent points on a contour line, all other errors can be derived. As a rule, errors of shape refer to the smallest structural details while positional errors are thought rather to stem from the geometric position of individual points on the contour line\n\nΒ. Accuracy in surveying terrain surfaces\n\n27\n\nwithin the framework of the whole map. The positions of points on a section of the contour line can, when viewed as a whole, completely satisfy the accuracy requirements but, nevertheless, the same line section can still' be considered poor, i.e. in those instances when the smallest details do not reflect the character of the natural shapes as, for example, when finely detailed, rugged karst formations or dissected rock surfaces (clints) are represented by smoothed contours. The errors in the lengths of contour lines can be considered locally or totalled for an entire zone of contours. In the latter instance, the sum total of the lengths of the lines is compared with the corresponding total derived from a more accurate control survey. Such a comparison is not always conclusive, but the result often indicates the richness or lack of detail present in the contour line image being investigated. Checking the lengths of contour lines may often provide a simple additional test but it is never sufficient in itself. Slope or gradient errors or horizontal errors between contours arise similarly from the positional errors of individual contour points or contour sections. They appear in poor quality plane-table sheets, normally as a result of inadequate observation and careless interpolation during survey. They can, in addition, also occur, in photogrammetric plotting through careless contour drawing or through the concealment of the ground by vegetation, snow, shadows, etc. In general, however, errors in this context are rare. One single contour line cannot show slope error. The concept of slope or gradient error is always made with reference to a group of contours. Errors in the lengths of contour lines and slope angles are directly related to one another. If convex or concave contour lines, or very irregular contour lines are stretched out and smoothed, horizontal intervals between contours increase for reasons which are obvious. The slope angles become, correspondingly, smaller. It is very important to take this phenomenon into consideration. Most topographic maps of alpine country from the second half of the last century make very steep inclines appear too flat as a result of their oversimplified contour lines. Likewise, contour maps at scales smaller than 1:100,000 make precipitous slopes appear too flat, the outcome of a generalized stretching of the contours. b) Types of errors in contour lines according to origin and local distribution. As we established while considering errors of spot heights, surveyors distinguish between gross errors, systematic errors and random errors. As was indicated in Section Β 1 of this chapter, gross errors are the result of inattention, confusion, incorrect booking, etc. An error is classified as 'gross' when it exceeds three times the mean error. As a rule, gross errors in contour lines can be detected and eliminated by careful comparison of the map and the ground. Their existence often indicates the presence of an inexperienced topographer, but they are rarely found in the work of experienced professionals and they will not be considered here. Systematic errors are those which distort a group of measurements in the same direction and often by the same or approximately the same amount. They are often difficult to recognize, especially if they occur only in rather small areas. Systematic errors do not, as a rule, apply to individual contour points, but rather to small or large areas. Normally, they are the result of height errors or positional errors in basic survey points (primary or secondary) or errors of orientation. In photogrammetry, they are produced by incorrect identification or mistakes in the determination of secondary points, also by inaccurate orientation of\n\n28\n\nThe Topographic Foundations\n\nthe plotting models. Such errors lead to regional shifts of elevation (\"datum errors\") and to shifts in position of entire sections of the picture. A datum error can be recognized in all the height errors over an area by their biased sign and thereafter eliminated. In contrast, a systematic error, which only appears regionally, is not easy to recognize as such. Sometimes, it is also visible through a comparison of the contour image with a corresponding control contour. The detection of systematic errors is of all the greater importance because they may be systematically distorted (shifted or twisted) while remaining true to individual or detailed forms (Figure 15). If a systematic error covers the entire map, as would a datum error for example, the local usefulness of the map is only slightly reduced. Accidental errors can never be completely avoided; they are associated with any survey and production process. In general, when a large number of independent measurements are made of the same quality, they are distributed symmetrically about the (unknown) true value. Large accidental errors occur less frequently than smaller ones. Only the accidental errors follow the laws of normal distribution (laws of probability) which underlie any determination of \"mean\" errors. It will always be necessary to check whether or not gross errors are t"
