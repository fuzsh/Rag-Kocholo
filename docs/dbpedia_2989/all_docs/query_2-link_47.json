Its objectives since the fbvindation in 1852 are to collect and disseminate geographical information by discussion, lectures, and publica- tions; to establish in the chief city of the United States a place where may be ob- tained accurate information on every part of the globe; and to encourage such exploring expeditions as seem likely to result in valuable discoveries in geography and the related sciences. The Society publishes the Geographical Review, a quarterly magazine issued in January, April, July, and October, and a series of Special and Research Publications of comprehensive scope. Tlie library is one of the largest geographical libraries of the world; in addition to the usual functions it maintains a Research Catalogue and issues the periodical Current Geographical Publications, Besides its modem cartographical material the Society possesses a valuable collection of atlases of the sixteenth, seven- teenth, and eighteenth centuries. Travelers, men of science, and others properly accredited are welcome at the rooms of the Society and may freely use the collections. Four gold medals are awarded by the Society: the Cullum Geographical Medal, the Charles P, Daly Medal, the Samuel Finley Breese Morse Medal, and the David Livingstone Centenary Medal (founded by the Hispanic Society of America). The Society has also for many yean promoted studies relating to questions of wide public interest; for example, settlement in the pioneer belts of the world, the problem of the white man in the tropics, the bearing of geography on international relations, the historical geography of the United States, polar exploration and geography. The Society is also engaged in the development of new techniques and instmments de- signed to increase the efficiency and reduce the costs of surveying and mapping; and it has long been at work on a great standard map of the Americas from the Mexico- United States border to Cape Horn. This map, in 107 sheets, which is now completed and under revision, is a project of direct utility to scientists, businessmen, and govern- ment officials concerned with Latin America. The qualifications for Fellowship in the Society arc an interest in exploration and travel, in the spread of geographical knowledge, and in the advancement of science. A Felldw is entitled to the use of the hbrary, reading, and map rooms; to admission to all lectures and exhibitions; to the Geographical Review; mi to occasional books and maps distributed by the Society. Annual Fellowship dues, Sio.oO; Sustaining Fellowship dues, $25.00 pet year; U& Fellowship, $200.00; Patron, $1,000.00; Benefactor, $5,000.00.

G.Joerg 695 The Geographical Review VOLUME XXXIX i Geography in This Crowded World ♦ WITH striking frequency the crises of man’s existence have been met and solved by forces seemingly created to await in obscurity the circumstantial moment that would call them forth to their supreme test. At least the shadow of a parallel can be found today as geography rises to cope with the ap- proaching struggle between increasing world population and fixed or dimin- ishing world resources. Geography, one might almost say, has been lying in wait for this moment. Humanity has reached the point, in its long journey toward maturity, where it now makes demands, not upon the resources of a region or of a continent, but upon the productive capacity of the entire earth. World population, which doubled in the last century, is expanding by giant leaps. Food production in the more crowded areas is insufficient to feed the con- tained groups, and the mass movement of foods from the abundant areas of the earth into the crowded sectors has been organized on a permanent basis. Lands that even recently were slated for withdrawal from cultivation are being put back into forced production, and no country can honestly say that it is banking its resources for the future. Hunger is not new to the world, for starvation areas have always existed. Formerly relief was obtained by migration into new and undeveloped areas — there was always somewhere to go, and the settlers of a new land usually welcomed followers. A principal task of the modern period of settle- ment has been to report on the new lands discovered by exploration, and to inform correctly the groups about to set forth toward them. Geography was the service arm of the great movements of civilized man about the earth. The movement of people to new lands has now slowed almost to a halt. Lesser adjustments continue, to correct errors or in answer to the changes of tech- nocracy, but the main effort is over. The world is all but filled, title deter- mined, “welcome” signs down, the land strictly posted against further trespass. What comes next? The movement of food to people. The transportation January, ig4g NUMBER 1 CopyH^ht, t^4g, by the American Geographical Society of New York of perishables is approaching perfection. Bananas come out of the tropics in floating incubators; the citrus fruits travel in refrigerated cars from their home in the subtropics to the zone of the hard winters or jump across the equator to beat the seasons; grains are moved dry, and livestock on the hoof Preserva- tion becomes important, to halt the ripening (or deteriorating) process, either as an aid to transportation or for storage into the lean seasons. The resources of the entire earth are thus brought into direct and usable relationship with the inhabitants of the entire earth. What now’? Man is a determined and possessive animal. Will he run through the visible supply of his resources in reckless disregard of the after- coming generations, counting on their ingenuity to wiggle out of the tough spots in which they may be left? Will nations deliberately overpopulate, to justify their “right” to a larger share of the earth’s area, or to stock-pile a consumable product in case of war? Will the crowded nations, unable longer to maintain or resettle their excess humanity, persuade their more moderate neighbors to break into their agricultural savings and distribute largess out of blind pity? These things are possible, and, in the consternation of the first view, they seem likely enough to happen. Whatever steps may be taken to prevent or mitigate this “final exploita- tion, the spiralling draft upon the world’s resources,” they must be taken with a sharp awareness of the many elements that contribute to the life and livelihood of man, not simply one or two. The list is long, and therein lies the danger of failure. We have, for example, the physical sciences — geodesy, geophysics, geology, geomorphology, hydrography, oceanography, glaci- ology, meteorology, climatology. Can any of these be left out? Indispensable, too, are the natural sciences — pedology, botany, forestry, agriculture, zoology, anthropology, ethnography, ecology, demography, medicine. But man’s actions and reactions lie deep at the core of the matter; therefore the social sciences — ^linguistics, history, political science, military science, regional planning, sociology, economics. Important all, but so large in number and in scope as to deaden the comprehension. What usable form can they be given? Mere summation of the parts produces little more than con- fusion. Clearly, these complex elements must be so handled that the result is an integrated and purposeful answer to the question of man and the land. No one by declaration can furnish this answer. It hinges upon a Workable method. Geography appears to possess that method. Once merely a descriptive science, geography has advanced to the infinitely more difficult task of analyzing as a whole the elements that distinguish place from place, and from 2 there into synthesis of earth patterns. “We have the unique ability to see patterns,” writes Wilson. “We must recognize our primary interest as being the discovery, identification, analysis, and synthesis of earth patterns.” And vital to the method is that master tool, geography’s perfection, the map. Speed is essential. We cannot wait for history to develop its predictions from parallel situations — there is no parallel for a crowded world. For- tunately, the method of geography is not based so much upon historical precedent as it is upon induction and deduction, the only way in which re- lated facts can be extracted from available materials to yield a contemporary view. Although history and geography often deal with the same materials, one might say that they constitute the two coordinates expressing the exist- ence of man, history being the long view and its axis time, geography the broad view, the instantaneous view sideways as we drop down through time. The seriousness of the emergency has been disputed. Vogt’s warning has been answered by agriculturists who point the way to higher yields per acre of soil. Yet gains in yield mean only postponement, not victory; for in the long run the creature of biology absorbs all that botany has to give, and if that creature is man with his tools of cultivation, he may end up by stripping rather than increasing the productive capacity of the earth. The time to meet the challenge is now, and it is not too late. Much work has already been done by geographers on the elucidation of earth patterns and their meaning for mankind. Gillman’s “Vegetation-Types Map of Tanganyika Territory” is an example; it is a step toward the goal of detennining the conditions for harmony between man and his supporting environment in East Africa. McBride’s “Land Systems of Mexico” offers another apt example, for does not the ownership of land stand squarely at the center of the problem? But the work McBride has done for Mexico and also for Chile needs to be carried further and extended to the rest of Latin America and to other lands as well. Too often in geography the work has been of a sampling or demonstration nature, without the power to continue after the pilot attempt. Consecutive studies toward a directed goal, as pursued by Bowman and Sauer, are exceptions. The Society believes that the development of the basic framework of geographical research in America ranks in importance with any of the other great research programs of the era. We are now engaged in exploring the possibilities of programs of continuing research. Several policy-making dis- cussions were held during the past year, and a progress report will be rendered at the Annual Meeting of the Society in January. Richard U. Light 3 Man and the Land and the Third Freedom ‘‘Freedom from want'* is a way of defining the goal of the “Road to Sur- vival,\" the resultant of the fundamental equation resources/man. On this criterion William Vogt finds Africa the poorest of the Out of Africa continents. “It possesses the lowest carrying capacity per Something Neu) ^ . ii r • • u » square mile ; nearly all or it is marginal tor agriculture. In other words, the renewable resources of Africa are most seriously in need of conservation. “One of the best clues to lands suitable for man’s use,\" says Mr. Vogt, “is given by the native vegetation.\" The value of this clue has been attested by the Society’s pioneer study “The Vegetation and Soils of Africa,\" by H. L. Shantz and C. F. Marbut. Their book, published in 1923 and long out of print, is still in demand. The need now is for newer and more detailed studies, such as Clement Gillman’s vegetation-types map of Tanganyika Territory. With his unrivaled knowledge of the country, Mr. Gillman was acutely aware of the “ecological imperatives\" and of the need for informed “ecological trusteeship\" in a land where the ecological balance is of the utmost delicacy. What happens when the balance is dis- turbed — by the introduction of such a new mode of land utilization as groundnuts cultivation, for instance? The question whether the much pub- licized groundnuts scheme is “sound — or dangerous\" is being asked by many well-informed persons, recently by Dr. H. E. Desch in the Crown Colonist (Nov., 1948). Each new project undertaken in the tropics reveals the extent of our geographical ignorance. In his address to the British Association last September, Lord Rennell, speaking on “Social Geography with Special Reference to Africa,\" singled out Clement Gillman as an out- standing example of the pioneer in colonial geography. The World^s Dilemma Put Fairfield Osborn’s “Our Plundered Planet\" alongside “Road to Sur- vival,\" and you have two books by scientists written in language that every- one can understand: no one, therefore, should be unaware of the world’s dilemma — the wastage of our renewable re- sources. Casting further light, sometimes of a critical nature, on the arguments of these prophets of “doom unless . . is a large and fast-growing literature. Our survey of some recent examples is far from, exhaustive, but it does suggest the complexity of a problem that involves the total environment everywhere. And in the reviews section J. Russell Smith adds his forceful word on the natural-resources situation in countries about the Caribbean. There is Mexico, where the rate of population increase. 4 having become one of the most rapid in the Western Hemisphere, creates an urgent situation. The complexity of this situation is implicit in Henry Sterling’s analysis of “Rural Mexico’’ — the need for understanding a total environment in which man himself is the most complicating factor. China: Land of Famine We are especially grateful to Mr. Vogt for his chapter entitled “As Mankind Thinketh,’’ a warning against confusing the verbal and the actual, the ideo- logical name and the thing itself. As an example he cites the confusion over “land,’’ which “partially explains why thousands of unfortunate refugees are being dumped into tropical countries that do not have nonverbal land capable of feeding their own people.” Or take the case of China’s Far West: the sparseness of popu- lation in Sinkiang, only six to the square mile, seems a direct invitation to the teeming millions of the Great Plain. So it is regarded by many Chinese officials, but Chang Chih-yi, who has investigated the possibilities of land utilization and settlement in Sinkiang, demonstrates that if natural resources is substituted for area in the population/ area ratio the land is already well filled. Internal colonization is not to be looked upon as a solution for over- population in the East. Must we then find with the Neo-Malthusians a “grim satisfaction” in the flood and famine checks that still take their toll from China’s people? UNRRA thought differently when it undertook the restoration of the Yellow River to the channel from which it was diverted in 1938 and thus reclaimed two million acres of good farmland. Oliver J. Todd, who probably knows more about the Yellow River than any other living engineer, directed the work to successful completion in spite of difficulties created by the civil war. He too envisages the far larger program needed for permanent relief from the threat of flood and famine, in which program economic, political, and social causes of disaster must also be overcome, as Walter H. Mallory so effectively pointed out in the Society’s “China: Land of Famine.” His concluding paragraph on over- population is as trenchant a statement as any in “Road to Survival” or “Our Plundered Planet.” The most pressing single problem in Japan is food production. As we note elsewhere, Lieutenant Colonel Hubert G. Schenck, chief of the Natural Resources Section of SCAP, emphasizes the need for long- range planning: “Indifference toward national economic planning is a luxury Japan can ill afford, but Japanese science and technology have never been in a position to attack the problem on a practical basis.” This is particularly true of the country’s fisheries, the prin- cipal source of animal proteins in the Japanese diet. In “A Program for 5 Boundary Troubles Japanese Fisheries” Ada Espenshade focuses attention on “the problem of providing as much protein food as possible for the Japanese — in the long- range future as well as in the immediate future.” “Bandit” Nature exacts a toll from political man. On a large scale or small he stakes out arbitrary limits to his own particular sphere — and pays for it. Within a single boundary Idaho contains two distinct and separated terrains, north and south; the outlooks of the users of those terrains are different also. In conflicts of interests over such matters as taxes, institutions, and highways the people of the state are paying for Nature’s sectionalism. For geographers the concept of total and constantly changing environment is of deepest significance. Every aspect of form and process is a subject for study. Meltwater sapping of the headwall of a cirque has its effect on the total environment no less than erosion of loess and deposit of silt in the Yellow River delta; the creation of nivation hollows by chemical weathering in the Cascades is as much a geographical fact as the formation of alkaline soils in the deserts of Tarim. Gordon Manley has no doubt about the final importance of the work of snow and ice in the total environment. “For around the North Atlantic the extent of the ice is ultimately far more significant than a few peevish politicians with such playthings as bombs!” The last word is the Earth’s. It was a Chou philosopher who said, “There is no bandit so remorseless as Nature.” G. M. W. In the Last Analysis 6 A VEGETATION-TYPES MAP OF TANGANYIKA TERRITORY CLEMEN T GlLLMANf To know what is, is vital for discussing what ought to be. The manuscript map and text were received at the American Geographical Society in November, 1946, a month after the death oj the author. He died ivhile flying from Dar es Salaam to Moshi, engaged, as ever, in ''making notes on the journey T The January, 1947, number of the Geographi- cal Review contained a brief appreciation of the work of Clement Gillman, of whom a contemporary said, \"In a sense he was Tanganyika.'* The map crowns a career devoted to geography and East Africa — to vanquishrnent of \"splendid ignorance\" by unassailable facts. But if Gillman was constantly warring against the legend or obsession of \"Africa's untold wealth,\" his efforts were in themselves constructive; besought to lead to a \"sounder optimism based on the search after knowledge which sees hope for Man, even in semTarid Africa, through his adapting himself to an inexorably stern Nature without further wanton destruction, by learning and facing the facts.\" T his map has been a long time in the making. The author began the purposeful accumulation of material in 1913 and continued during all his surveys in the Territory. The publication of his population map of Tanganyika in the Geographical Review in 1936 gave him the urge to assemble the vegetational data, and further stimulus came in 1940 when an Interterritorial Pasture Research Conference at Nairobi appointed a com- mittee to draw up a classification of East African vegetation types. By the end of 1943 the plan had been fomiulated, and the author was entrusted with the preparation of the map for Tanganyika Territor) . To do justice to the large amount of available source material, a first draft was executed, in 1944-1945, on the scale of i : 500,000 in 25 sheets or part sheets of the standard size of 4° squares. It was hoped to publish the final map on the millionth scale; meanwhile, for practical reasons, the scale was reduced to I : 2,000,000 (Pi. I, facing p. 36). The Classification Committee’s draft report of July, 1943, stated: We set out to classify vegetation by vegetation and not by anything else that may or may not be closely correlated with it. In leaving out questions of successional status we classify vegetation not by what it perhaps used to be, nor by what it will become according to some current theory, but by what the surveyor finds. In other words, the classification and the map built thereon are strictly physiognomic. Within the limits of scale and reliability the map provides the essential factual basis for further ecological and geographical investiga- tions, as well as for checking the tenability of theories derived from classifi- 8 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW cations. This is all the more desirable in a region where comparatively recent and often large-scale differential movements of the earth’s crust have resulted in a highly variegated pattern of dovetailing geological, climatic, edaphic, and hydrological conditions, changing frequently from place to place and often imperfectly known. Thus this conscientious mapping of the directly observable physiognomic vegetation types will, it is hoped, increase our knowledge of such less easily observable features as climate, soils, and, to a certain extent, subsurface hydrology, the least known of all. Difficulties of Compilation To enable the reader to gauge the usefulness of the map for his particular purpose, some of the difficulties inherent in its compilation must be briefly mentioned. Although the most recent topographical maps used for plotting the vegetation are distinct improvements over the older editions, they are uneven in quality and in parts can only be styled “rough approximations.”^ Our knowledge of the vegetation itself is likewise patchy, and the areas on the map that are based on a proper, ad hoc, vegetation survey are regrettably few and small. However, a careful scrutiny of the available source material has permitted the attaching of relatively “high reliability” to about 55 per cent of a map that can, and does, claim only reconnaissance status. Where land poorly known vegetationally is surrounded by better-known areas possessing identical topographical features, topographical interpolation was thought permissible. Such regions and others for which only older observa- tions exist were classed as of “medium reliability” — about 25 per cent. The rest of the map, even though mere intelligent guesses are few, can claim only “low reliability” (20 per cent). In a country where shifting of population often leads to marked changes in population density within comparatively short periods of time, one must beware of accepting vegetational observations made 20 or 30 years ago without a check, which, admittedly, has not everywhere been possible. The author knows of many large tracts of land formerly intensively cultivated that have reverted to bush or woodland, and forests and woodlands that have recently disappeared, or are in process of disappearing, under the onslaught of man and his fires. If checks can be made, there may be the difficulty, perhaps more apparent than real, of fitting the old terminology into the new, especially if the earlier observer was a layman with his own peculiar glossary. Furthermore, the personal equation enters in; and subjective in- ^ Aerial mapping of large areas in Tanganyika Territory is in progress.

VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 9 terpretation is intensified by the fact that the more open African grassy woodlands or wooded grasslands change in their physiognomic aspect with the season/ Finally, due consideration must be given to the unavoidable difficulty of deciding what to omit among even well-known factual features during the process of reduction to a map scale that does not permit the use of all available material. Vegetation Types The vegetation of the greater part of Tanganyika Territory belongs to the intricate mixture of wood- or bush-land with grassland characteristic of the tropics with alternating dry and wet seasons. The distribution of these two competing elements within a climate ranging from semihumid to semi- arid is primarily determined by edaphic variations of soil and hydrological conditions and by the use, or misuse, that man makes of them. Small parts of the Territory lie in climatically or edaphically more humid or more arid regions, so that any classification intended to cover the whole range of observable types must include evergreen forests and deserts. In deciding on the nomenclature the Classification Committee has rightly given preference to plain English words, has avoided unnecessary tautologies such as “ever- green rain forest,” and has strictly abstained from the use of such terms as “savanna,” “steppe,” and “veld,” since legitimate doubt may arise as to whether such importations from the languages of lands harboring their prototypes are correctly used out of their proper setting. Similarly, East African vernacular words, such as miombo and nyika, have been avoided. The scheme adopted shows eight main physiognomic vegetation types: (i) Forest, (2) Woodland, (3) Bushland and Thicket, (4) Wooded Grassland, (5) Grassland, (6) Permanent Swamp Vegetation, (7) Desert and Semidesert, (8) Vegetation Actively Induced by Man. During the compilation of the map it became necessary to introduce two intermediary types in order to fit in observational facts, one between (1) and (2), the other between (2) and (3/4). The many subtypes listed had to be practically ignored, either because their distribution was far from suf- ficiently known or because, where known, it could not be represented on a small-scale map. For Grassland and Induced Vegetation only, two major subtypes in each were considered essential to bring out interesting features, and under Thickets three geographically or economically important sub- * See, for example, the picturesque description of the miombo woodland in B.

Fig. 6— Mist Forest remnant, northwest comer of high block of Usambara (38° 20' E., 4° 30' S.). 12 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW types of regional extent are shown separately. Inasmuch as this is a new classification, in many ways diverging considerably from old-established practice, it seems essential that a short description of the main types should be given, based largely on the Classification Committee’s own definitions. 1. Forests are continuous stands of trees, many of which may attain a height of 50 meters or more, with crowns touching or intermingling, often freely interlaced with lianas. Epiphytes (orchids, ferns, and giant mosses) are frequent in the wetter types. The canopy usually consists of several dis- tinct stories. Most of the trees are in full leaf the year round, but in some types deciduous trees dominate. The floor is either covered with herbs and shrubs (sometimes including carpets of cryptogams—ferns. Lycopodium, Sela^inella) or bare where the tree canopy excludes light. Grasses, if present, are comparatively localized and inconspicuous. The main subtypes are rain forest; lowland and upland dry (or “mist”) forest, the latter often clad in lichens; deciduous forest; ground- water and riverine fringing forest; and swamp forest, either fresh-water or saline (mangrove forest). A characteristic physiognomic feature, especially of the drier upland types, is a fire-created grass and bracken land that eats into the edges of the virgin forest and, forming constantly growing grassy glades, tends to dis- solve the forest; the penultimate stage of this process is a dominating grass- land containing ever shrinking islands of gnarled forest remnants. The map attempts to bring out this characteristic and economically important and dangerous features by pale yellow patches inside the black forest areas and by black dots on the yellow of the surrounding grassland. 2. Woodland is land with an open cover of trees the crowns of which do not form a thickly interlaced canopy and which, as a rule, are leafless for some period in the year. Scattered evergreen shrubs may be present but are not conspicuous. Grasses and herbs form the dominant ground cover. Epi- phytes are rare, though there may be lichens.^ This type assumes such different forms floristically under the control of different combinations of the edaphic and climatic factors that probably the best subdivision will be according to dominating genera, such as Brachystegia, Isoberlinia, Afrormosia, Acacia, Combretum, and Uapaca. A subtype characterized by bamboo {Oxytenanthera ahyssinica) thickets as a dominant ingredient is found throughout the large woodland area south of 8° S., and also on the high ground bordering the Lake Tanganyika trough on the east. * The more important synonyms are Steppenwald, Trockenwald (Engler); “dry forest” (Shantz); Hrachystegia deciduous savannah forest” (Henkel); Savannenwald (Schimper); Buschwald (Vageler); “open woodland” (Tansley and Chipp).

Bushland and Thicket is land carrying a more than 50 per cent cover of densely growing shrubs or small trees; the trees and bushes may be ever- green or deciduous, spiny or nonspiny. The bushes have no clearly defined boles and may be from one to ten meters high. Tall trees may be present, either in clumps or widely scattered, but do not of themselves form a con- tinuous canopy over the main bush cover; climbers are common. In the evergreen subtypes epiphytes are present. Herbs, both ephemeral and suc- culent, and dwarf grasses may form part of the ground cover in deciduous bushland. Thickets are close assemblages of coppicing virgate bushes. The baobab (Adansonia digitata) is a conspicuous dominant in parts of the de- ciduous thornbush.\"^ Three thickets of regional extent are shown on the map. The so-called ‘‘Itigi Thicket,** astride the railroad near the eastern edge of the Central Plateau, covers 5000 to 6000 square kilometers. It is a dense, fully closed thicket of coppicing shrubs, 2.5 to 5 meters high, obviously to be explained by edaphic differences. This thicket, which was first mentioned by Burton,^ forms an important natural barrier against tsetse fly. The “Msua Thicket,’* also astride the Central Railway, in its coastal sector west of the Ruvu Valley, covers some 800 square kilometers. It is a strange type of “semi-thicket low forest” composed of numerous tree species and abundant succulent or spiny shrubs and creepers, in places lichen-covered. It is probably maintained by mists that penetrate from the sea through the wide depression of the Ruvu Valley. The succulent Euphorbia Thicket, widely distributed on the slopes of the northern high blocks (Usambara and Pare), seems to be a well- established secondary growth where forest has been destroyed on slopes too steep or too stony for the development of grassland. 4. Wooded Grassland is land covered with glasses and other herbs, gen- erally perennial, with trees and bushes, either evergreen or deciduous, grouped or scattered, occupying less than 50 per cent of the ground. The grasses dominate the aspect, but the woody species are always conspicuous. Perhaps more than the others, this type has suffered in interpretation from the “personal factor” and the seasonal changes of aspect. On the other hand, it has proved a useful omnium-gatherum for accommodating some doubtful subtypes near the border line between the prevailingly woody and prevail- ingly grassy types by a not too rigid adherence to the “less than 50 per cent” of the definition. Thus, as presented on the map, this main type includes a * Synonyms for this formation are Lauhwerjende Dornbuschsteppe , Trockenes Buschgeholz (Engler); “thorn-bushland” (Warming); Strauchsteppe (Volkcns); “thorn forest” (Shantz). s R.

Grassland is land covered with grasses and other herbs, sometimes with evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs, widely scattered or in small isolated groups, occupying not more than 10 per cent of the ground. Two subtypes have been adopted for the map, based on a hydro-topographical subdivision: Valley Grassland, due to seasonal flooding; and Ridge and Slope Grassland, not due to seasonal flooding. In the latter have been included the High Altitude Grassy Scrub Formation, of upper Kilimanjaro for example.'^ 6. Permanent Swamp Vegetation consists of grasses, reeds (mostly papyrus), and rushes, and sometimes ferns, their stems rising out of the free water accumulated on the surface either from perennial flooding or from an out- cropping ground-water table. Forests growing on similarly swampy land are shown as swamp or ground-water forests. 7. Desert and Semidesert. Vegetation is nonexistent, as in permanent or temporary salt pans or on rock and ice (alpine desert of Kilimanjaro), or is so thinly scattered that the aspect of the land is dominated at all seasons by the color of the soil. The plants may be low bushes or stunted trees, mostly spiny or thorny; succulent climbers; bulbous or tuberous succulents; and thinly scattered, mostly ephemeral grasses. The comparatively small areas carrying saltbush (usually Suaeda monoica exclusively), though of a denser physiognomic type and therefore included under Bushland by the Classifica- tion Committee, have on this small-scale map been grouped with the semi- desert to which they belong geographically. 8. Actively Induced Vegetation. This concept was introduced at the author’s suggestion in order to do justice to the physiognomic aspect of the highly mixed and constantly changing vegetation pattern presented by cultivated crops and their rotational shifts, pastures, the interspersed remnants of the original vegetation, and the great variety of scattered small areas of secondary growth. The concept, if accompanied by an adequate textual description, * In its main characteristics the term is probably synonymous with Engler’s Busch- und Baum- grassteppe and Shantz’s “acacia-tall grass savana,” but it also includes part at least of the latter’s “high grass-low tree savana’’on the humid side of its normal distribution and his “acacia - desert grass savana” on the arid side. Likewise it covers well what is commonly referred to as “park land/’ “open bush/’ and “orchard (Obstgarten) steppe.’’ 7 Synonyms for Valley Grassland are offene Grassteppe (Englcr), “tall grass’’ (Shantz); for Ridge and Slope Grassland, Hochweideland (Englcr), a very misleading term, “mountain grass’’ (Shantz); for High Altitude Grassy Scrub, Hochgebirgssteppe (Englcr), “alpine meadow’’ (Shantz), “Moor-Grassland’’ (Classification Committee). VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 19 should prove a satisfactory and scientifically correct way to indicate on a small-scale map the complexities introduced into a country’s vegetational aspect by the activities of man. The tenn thus denotes a physiognomic type of vegetation produced by the direct or indirect influence of man’s present occupation of the land; it does not include vegetation types that are the re- Fig. 17 — Semiarid vegetation in the Mkomazi gap between the southern Pare and the west Usum- bara mountains. (Photograph by P. J. Greenway.) suit of former human occupation, which are allotted to the physiognomic type they resemble in the present stage of natural or artificial rehabilitation. On a I : 2,000,000 map only the larger areas of induced vegetation can be shown — areas where human occupation is sufficiently dense, extensive, and concentrated to alter the appearance of the vegetation as a whole. The typical forms due to the bush fallowing of a more or less scattered population do not, as a rule, materially alter the aspect of the landscape, except, perhaps, when seen from high in the air; they are of an ephemeral nature and are, in any case, far too small for representation. Because the introduction of this type has led to a good deal of controversy, and because actively induced vegetation is of considerable interest to the geographer, the following physiognomic descriptions of three of the six established subtypes will help to elucidate the application of the term.

These are the 'well-known “culti- vation steppes,” a term now considered misleading. The prevailing topog- raphy is flat or gently rolling ground interrupted by inselbergs. As much of the fallow land — from 20 to 90 per cent — is used for pasture, the general aspect is that of secondary grassland through which the villages or kraals are scattered. Here and there this grassland is interrupted by bush, regenerating or still uncleared, and by the strips of natural grassland occupying the sea- sonally inundated shallow valleys or depressions. Between the bare rock outcrops of the remnant hills are denser bush and thickets, or even woodland remnants, frequently deteriorated by browsing goats. Soil erosion is usually far advanced, and resulting barren sand flats are an integral part of the land- scape. Where this type of induced vegetation has been formed from de- ciduous bushland with the baobab as a dominant, these giants remain as conspicuous relics.^ The only permanent cultivations are the evergreen hedges of Euphorhia tirucalli around villages and cattle kraals, clusters of evergreen mangoes along the former Arab trade routes and the German administrative network, or small banana groves around an occasional seepage spring at the foot of a remnant hill. There are, of course, intermediate stages in the de- velopment of this type of induced vegetation, during which it takes on a patchier appearance — either on lands freshly occupied or after partial ex- haustion of fertility and withdrawal of population. Highland Massed Rural Settlements. These correspond to the Hochweiden of the German authors, a completely misleading term. The general aspect varies considerably with topography, native methods of tilling and grazing, and length of occupation. Smaller or larger remnant islands of forest, belts of secondary bracken and shrub, secondary bushland, often including euphorbia stands, and grassland form the ingredients of the frequently shifting pattern of the cultivated land. Banana groves and, in places, vegetable gardens are conspicuous; elsewhere, as on Kilimanjaro and in Bukoba, permanent coffee crops make the pattern more durable. Or again, grassland, whether primary or the result^ of former occupation by man, makes the background for the present-day, mostly scattered agriculture. Small groves of native reforesta- tion, chiefly wattle, and the red or white scars of overeroded slopes complete the picture. Coastal Foreland Settlements. These are usually comparatively narrow strips ® See, for example, the description by P. J. Qreenway in “The Vegetation of Mpwapwa, Tan- ganyika Territory,” /owrrt. of Ecology, Vol. 21, 1933, pp. 28-43.

This settlement type is characterized by extensive coconut-palm plantations and by such other evidences of long-continued outside influence (Asian and Portuguese) as mango and other fruit trees. The subsidiary, shifting cultivation of grains, pulses, and tubers is disappearing in the physi- ognomy of the dominating permanent arboreal cultures. In addition to these and other types of vegetation induced by indigenous peoples, the map also shows vegetation induced by aliens on their farms, plantations, experimental stations, and mines. Many of the areas are exag- gerated to make them visible. The boundaries of the distribution of the baobab are also shown (inset. Pi. I). It is of much scientific interest and is not everywhere readily explain- able. This first fairly accurate presentation, the result of many years of research and observation, may help to clear up points that are still doubtful. Complexes and Catenas Different vegetation types, often widely different, occur nearly every- where in close conjunction or juxtaposition, a fact that raises a problem for small-scale map reproduction. The solution is to give such “complexes’’ or “intrazonals” separate, if only symbolic, notation to preserve the minor yet significant intermixtures in the general picture. Moreover, this “complex” notation permits fairly detailed generalized representation of such facts as rapid alteration of geological or edaphic conditions under a uniform climate, or historical developments in the immediate past under the influence of man and fire. The method used is as follows: The ground color is that of the dominating type, and the significant intrazonals are shown by circles or dots in the color of their type; the relative frequency of the “minors,” where known, is indicated by the closer or wider spacing of the dots. Extensive, use was made of these complexes on the large-scale original draft, but technical difficulties in reduction have prevented their full repro- duction on the 1 : 2,000,000 scale. The present map thus shows only two such complexes, the forest-grassland interrelations already described (p. 12), and an Induced Vegetation complex (red dots) on the Ridge and Slope Grassland (yellow background) in the areas where human occupation, or rcoccupation, of the latter is scattered, as on the highlands around the north end of Lake Nyasa. However, the student of the map may find it useful to know the prevailing intrazonals in the other main vegetation types: VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 25 In Woodland: Fringing forest, inselberg vegetation, bushland, wooded grassland, thickets of “hardpan” types, grassland, induced vegetation. Bushland: Fringing forest, woodland (near margins), wooded grassland, grassland, in- duced vegetation. Wooded Grassland: Fringing forest, bushland, grassland, palm stands, induced vegetation. Grassland: Fringing forest, thickets, wooded grassland, seasonal swamps, induced vege- tation. Permanent Swamp Vegetation: Swamp forest, thickets on termite mounds. Semidesert: Saltbush scrub, grassland, palm stands. Although these complexes are as a rule not predictable from a general contemplation of ground conditions, there is another type of complex that can be predicted if the relief is known. This is the “catenary complex” or “catena.” The concept corresponds closely to that of the catena of soil science and is similarly caused by changes in the controlling factors according to their relative position on the relief.^ The following may serve as a succinct definition: A catena is a distributional sequence of vegetation types de- termined by a given set of regularly repeated physiographic and/or hydro- graphic conditions (with their effect on soils), the arrangement of vegetation types being a function of local differences in topography that are constantly repeated over the catenary area. It will be seen that a “catena” is therefore not a category of classification as main types or subtypes are, for between one zone of the catenary complex and the next there is usually some prin- cipal classification line; it is merely a device to permit a more correct repre- sentation of the vegetational facts on a small-scale map than the usual misrepresentation that results from showing only a single dominant type. Most of the catenas established during this study are of sufficiently wide extent to offer no difficulties in representation (in the form of “pajama stripes”) even on a i : 2,000,000 map. In fact, one of them, the Central Plateau Catena, covers about 100,000 square kilometers, one-ninth of the country’s surface. As the geographer will no doubt be interested in these “transzonal,” topography-determined vegetational complexities, a detailed description of the three catenas included on the map seems warranted.

Charac- teristic, localized ingredients in this monotonous pattern are termite-mound and other thickets (in all three vegetation belts); patches of more open bushland or woodland on “hardpan’* soils; patches of short grass on out- cropping limonitic crusts; scattered baobabs along the valley edges (east of the Congo-Wembere divide); on the remnant hills a mixture of more luxuriant woodland thickets, tufted grass, and bare rock; and, finally, the small, shifting areas of native cultivation, both those under occupation and those that have reverted to secondary growth, and the regenerating thin- nings left by the railroad fuel contractors. Where shallow ground water is present, it is often indicated by stands of Borassus palms. The relative width of the three belts composing this catena varies of course with the density of the drainage pattern of the wide, shallow black-clay depressions [mbugas), but the woodland belt is always the broadest and the marginal bushland the narrowest. The uniform catena pattern is interrupted by the few major drainage arteries; though intermittent, they retain sufficient ground or sur- face water in the dry season to support a permanent vegetation of bush fringes (frequently evergreen) or even fringing forest, and, where the scale permits, they should be distinguished on the map. Ugogo and Masailand Catenas On all the high blocks and some of the low blocks that lie in the rain- shadow area of the eastern highland arc, within a range of 50 kilometers in the south and as much as 250 kilometers in the north, one observes a charac- teristic and often minute dovetailing of two vegetation types. The distribu- tion here of Brachystegia Woodland and deciduous thornbush is clearly determined by the topographical exposure to moisture as expressed by both aspect and altitude. It is this changing exposure that provides the constantly repeated topographical element to which the catena concept is applied. It should be noted, however, that the Ugogo Catena- is not merely a variety of the marginal and merging type Woodland/Bushland Intennediary but a proper catenary juxtaposition of pure woodland and pure bushland. On the semiarid Masailand peneplain runoff in many parts is insufficient to carve distinct stream beds and merely collects in the numerous localized, shallow depressions of the mature surface, from which it quickly evaporates in the dry season. The alternation of these “rain ponds,” or “pans,” with VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 29 panless ground constitutes the repeating topographical and hydrographical basis for the Masailand Rain-Pond Catena — a sea of dominating thornbush with irregularly distributed islands of grassland usually surrounded by a narrow fringe of wooded grassland. Tectonic Controls The checkered pattern of the vegetation of the Territory is due pri- marily to the geologically recent shattering of the earth’s crust in East Africa. The result of that shattering is a jumble of differentially displaced blocks. High blocks, troughs, and peneplain remnants, either still untouched by the present erosion cycle or already being carved up, at differing altitudes and often in close juxtaposition, form the main elements of the tectonic picture. In the north a large focus of recent volcanism and at the head of Lake Nyasa a smaller one add to the variety. This tectonic arrangement and its influence on vegetation can be roughly outlined thus (the reader is advised to follow the description on the physiographic and geologic maps*®): From the volcanic giants of Kilimanjaro and Meru in the north an almost continuous arc of high blocks trends south-southeastward toward the coast for 250 kilometers; in the immediate hinterland of Tanga it turns sharply to the southwest to run, bulging slightly southeastward, more than 700 kilometers to the north end of Lake Nyasa, where it ends in the southern volcanic focus. At about 150 kilometers from the lake an offshoot roughly following the 3 5th meridian comprises the high blocks of Ubena-Ukinga (Livingstone Mountains) and Songea-Matengo near the Portuguese border. On its whole extent of more than 1000 kilometers the arc drops in well- pronounced scarps to a much lower coastal hinterland of varying width — 40 kilometers at Tanga, 440 kilometers in the latitude of Lindi. This prac- tically uninterrupted step acts as an ideal condenser for the moisture brought in from the Indian Ocean, chiefly by the northeast trade wind on its short E.

Note. 30 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW northern sector and by the southeast trade wind on its much longer southern one. In the southwest corner local condensation of the moisture produced by evaporation from Lake Nyasa seems to replace to a large extent the high-block condensation of the moisture brought by the trade wind, which, at this distance from the coast, must be greatly reduced. Normal annual precipitation above 1250 millimeters — frequently 2000 millimeters or more — is the rule, and consequently the natural vegetation of the upper reaches of this highland arc is evergreen forest. The arc itself is the hydrographic axis feeding all the Territory’s main drainage basins to the south and east of the Great Rift Valley shatter belt, which itself has no outlet to the sea. At the scarp foot, between the arc and the isolated outliers of Mahenge and Uluguru, are the tectonically determined depressions of the Kilombero and the Wami. The vegetation pattern of the prevailingly alluvial land is composed of wide grasslands of the valley subtype that harbor occasional large permanent swamps and countless minor ones and are fringed by wooded grasslands that merge outwardly into the woodlands of the sur- rounding higher ground. A similar trough borders the southwestern foot of the northern sector of the highland arc in the shape of the great Pangani depression, mostly rain-shadow land with prevailingly eluvial soils, swampy in the immediate vicinity of the river but elsewhere carrying typical semiarid vegetation types, including small areas of semidesert. Adjoining the high-block axis of condensation on the west and north- west lie the much lower tectonic tilt blocks that in Tanganyika Territory take the place of the true Great Rift Valley of Kenya. This vast wedge- shaped rain-shadow region, narrow in the south and widening northward through Ugogo into Masailand, has a mean annual rainfall of only 500 to 750 millimeters. The prevailing vegetation is semiarid bush and wooded grassland -with occasional patches of pure grassland of the ridge and slope subtype. On the west the agglomeration of relatively low blocks is again bounded by higher ground. In the north the well-marked scarps of the “Great Rift Wall” rise locally to such heights that, with the superimposed still higher “giant caldrons” of the Ngorongoro district, they create a sec- ondary belt of relatively high precipitation and evergreen forest, mostly “mist forest.” In the south more easily graded escarpments lead to the surface generally referred to as the “Central Plateau,” where the gently undulating topography of a vast peneplain remnant dominates the landscape. The rainfall is between 800 and 1200 millimeters, and the peneplain is the typical home of Brachystegi a-Othcr Species Woodland, which, along with the peneplain, stretches far west across the Tanganyika and Nyasa troughs into Katanga, Northern Rhodesia, and Angola. VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 31 In the northwrest corner of the Territory is the shallow tectonic basin of Victoria Nyanza. The evaporation from this vast sheet of water, driven by heavy rainfall, ranging from 1500 to 3000 millimeters. Little is left today of the former “evergreen forests*’ that resulted from these conditions. A dense population with an economy based largely on coffee, maintains extensive areas of actively induced vegetation. What remains of the forests is almost exclusively of the swamp or ground-water subtype. Farther away from the lake shores rainfall decreases to the west and south and woodland, bush, and wooded grassland become the dominating vegetation types. Between about 3\"\" and 6''3o' S. the peneplain of the Central Plateau dips gently westward, until, roughly along the 31st meridian, it abuts against the step of the arc of high blocks marking the eastern edge of the Lake Tangan- yika rift valley in Kobondo, Uha, and northern Ubende. The postpene- planation cycle of erosion determined by the new Lake Tanganyika base level has cut, and is cutting, deeply incised valleys in the mostly unmeta- morphosed elastics of these plateaus, tending to reduce them to isolated blocks. Topographically and hydrographically the terrain differs greatly from the gently undulating peneplain surface on the old basement schists and granites of the Central Plateau, as yet untouched by the new cycle. Along the line of contact between these two morphological types lies a fairly broad belt of recent or present-day alluvial fill. This triple change of topography results in the corresponding change of vegetation types shown on the map: in the east the Central Plateau Catena; in the middle large permanent swamps, seasonally inundated grasslands, and wooded grasslands covering in the ag- gregate some 9000 square kilometers; and in the west the “closed Brnchystegia Woodland,” only irregularly interrupted by the more open vegetation or the fringing bush or forest of the valley bottoms. Only in the highest parts of this region does one still find remnants of evergreen forest, the home of the chimpanzee, now mostly become secondary, fire-created grassland or scrub. From 6\"^ 30^ S. to 9° S. the tectonic pattern is dominated by the Lake Rukwa rift trough. Vegetationally this is a typical rain-shadow area, its aridity somewhat mitigated by the rather ample runoff from the bordering high blocks: southern Ubende in the north, Ukimbu in the east, Ufipa in the west, and Umalila in the south. The runoff sustains some fair-sized perennial swamps, but because of the exceptionally powerful evaporation in what is probably the hottest part of the Territory it fails to keep the basin of Lake Rukwa permanently filled. The northern two-thirds of the “lake” are periodically dry and then carry only a sparse semidesert vegetation. In the great rectangle of southeastern Tanganyika, between the Ruvuma River and 9° S. from the foot of the great inland scarps to the sea, tectonic 32 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW disturbances, though locally recognizable, are regionally far less pronounced, with the result that the vegetation pattern is monotonously uniform: Brachystegia Woodland, with its marginal intermediaries toward bushland, reigns supreme over the broad sedimentary ridges and across the minor valleys of these plateaus built largely of Mesozoic and Tertiary clastic rocks. The rainfall ranges from 800 to 1100 millimeters. Only the larger drainage channels and the numerous deeply scooped-out headwater erosion bays show the usual more open vegetation types or, in favorable positions, fringes of denser bush or even Forest/ Woodland Intermediary types. On some of the plateau blocks near the coast with a rainfall probably somewhat higher these intermediaries occasionally cover larger areas. The Brachystegia-Other Species Woodland Whereas the tectonic control of the vegetation pattern has to be carefully read into thp map with the aid of topographical and geological maps, the vast extent of the Brachystcgia-Othev Species Woodland, locally referred to simply as rniornbo, almost immediately catches the eye. In two major units, one in the northwest with a substantial outlier in the Central Province and one in the southeast, measuring respectively about 220,000 and 240,000 square kilometers exclusive of the enclosed miombo-free areas, this vegeta- tion type covers a total of 460,000 square kilometers, or nearly one-half of the Territory’s land surface! These two great lobes are separated by a miombo-free corridor, 500 kilometers long and widening from 60 kilo- meters in the southwest to 120 kilometers in southern Masailand. Thence the miombo-free regions stretch across the whole of northern Tanganyika from the coast to the east shore of Lake Victoria and across the Kenya border. Comparison with the geological and soil maps finds that miombo woodland is present on nearly every mapped geological formation or soil type, the only exceptions being certain limestones, both old and new, that produce heavy clay eluvia, certain Karroo shales that likewise weather into heavy clay^, and the heavy clayey alluvia of the inundation plains, all three forming heavy and badly drained soils; the too well or too rapidly drained soils of certain Pliocene duricrusts (coincident with the Itigi Thicket);'^ and the terra rossas of the karstic Pleistocene coral limestones of the coast. To talk of ‘'miombo soils” is grossly misleading. The most plausible explanation of the absence of miombo from the northern regions of the \" See Mr. Gillman’s discussion in G. Milne: A Soil Reconnaissance Journey through Parts of Tanganyika Territory December 1935 to February 1936 [edited by C. Gillinan]. Jtjwrw. of Ecology, Vol. 35. 1947, pp. 192-265; reference on p. 225. — Edit. Note. VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 33 Territory fits in vvrell w'ith the idea that miombo woodland is a function primarily of climate — more precisely, of rainfall distribution. This peculiar vegetation type apparently requires a rainfall of 800 to 1200 millimeters without the well-marked pause in midsummer that characterizes the regions under the influence of the northeast trade wind. Miombo-free islands within this miombo climate are due to locally unfavorable edaphic conditions pro- duced by hydrological rather than chemical differences of the soils. As the home of the common tsetse fly (Glossina rnorsitans) the Brachy- Other Species Woodland is, perhaps excusably, regarded with dis- favor by the administrator and the economic “planner.’’ It would seem a profitable task for the geographer to assist not only toward a better under- standing of its extent and present economic limitations but also toward a scientifically correct improvement of these lands that must inevitably be looked upon as the chief reserves of the future. Forest Remnants Of equal, or perhaps even greater, urgency is the threat to the country’s water resources through the destruction of the evergreen forests on the main watersheds. The vegetation map brings out instructively the pitifully small remnants of forest by the use of solid black for an “eye opener” — and many of the black patches had to be exaggerated to make them visible at this small scale. The geographer should never tire of pointing out, with all the scientific emphasis at his command, the important interrelations between the small still-forested uplands and the vast foot plains. The plains can remain, or again become, the home of a stable peasantry only if the forests are protected against the rapacious inroads of the mountain dwellers and if their rehabili- tation is energetically furthered without delay in the many areas where deterioration is advanced. Alien Plantations and Native Land Occupation Another salient point on the map, rectifying a commonly held exaggera- tion, is the insignificance of the alien plantations and farming settlements, not only when compared with the total surface, on which these tiny specks of land — colored bright red for emphasis — literally almost disappear but even when contrasted with the extent of native land use. However unpalat- able this fact may be to the politician and the land speculator, the geographer studying the vegetation map cannot fail to draw the inevitable conclusions and follow them up with his warning voice ! 34 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW BBi 1 Hi^h rainfall cultvatton WBi 2 AHu vial plains and fan settlement 3 a Cutbvation steppe Semi cultivation steppe 4- Highland savana settlement 5 Coastal hinterland settlement 6 a Densely scattered i 6 b Widely scattered > Dry forest and scrub 6c Concentrated I ^7 Nomadic occupation dZ] 8 Uninhabited ^ Boundary of tsetse infested country Fig. 3i~This map is reproduced from the article “A Population Map of Tanganyika Territory” (Ceogr. Ret'., Vol. 26, 1936, p. 356) in order to correct a misapprehension affecting the map and also the tabic on p. 3 57. The large areas in the western part of the Southern Province shown as “uninhabited” or occupied by a “widely scattered population” were attributed to the absence or only sporadic oc- currence of permanent domc.stic water. At the time of writing the author, having no personal knowledge of these regions, w'as forced to rely on the scant available older literature. He later had the opportunity for extensive exploration of the Ruvuma basin, which revealed comparatively ample permanent streams and compelled him to account for the sparsity of population on historical grounds (see reference in footnote 12). This new vegetation map presents nothing factually new regarding the distribution of the native agricultural and pastoral activities of Tanganyika Territory. For it merely repeats, this time in bright colors, the visually less impressive picture of the author’s population map. However, to the serious VEGETATION MAP OF TANGANYIKA 35 student it may become a useful tool for checking, with the aid of the vege- tation pattern, the conclusions arrived at earlier regarding the inter- dependence between the Territory’s population and the hydrographic patterns/^ APPENDIX I— COMPARISON WITH EARLIER MAPS It may be useful to compare this map on the comparatively large scale of i : 2,000,000 with such earlier attempts on smaller scales as those of Engler (1910)^^ and Shantz (1923).^'* On Engler’s map there are four main errors, (i) The extent of the Hochweiden is far too wide. In any case, the term is misleading, as some of the earlier writers had recognized (see, for example, Tropenpfanzer Beihefte, Vol. 6, 1905, p. 325); it is now replaced by Ridge and Slope Grassland. (2) The ojffene Grassteppe obviously includes many of the “cultivation steppes” (another term no longer tenable) now classed with Actively Induced Vegetation. The distribution of these “steppes” in the days of Engler’s authorities differs considerably from that of today, so that comparison of the old and new maps provides welcome informa- tion regarding the shifting of human activities. Note particularly the large extent of open ground stretching for 200 kilometers northwest of Tabora, which has today mostly reverted to woodland and is replaced on the present map by an open, elongated oasis, centered on Tabora. The large triangular patch of Grassteppe bounded by the 36th meridian and the parallel of 6° S. is definitely wrong, for most if not all of this ground forms, and presumably always has formed, part of the great Masai Thornbush. (3) The long strip of Salzsteppe in the Wembere depression is now more correctly included in seasonally flooded Valley Grass- land. (4) The extent of Forest, of both types, on the Uluguru Mountains above Morogoro is far too large even for those early days; today it is only a narrow crescent-shaped remnant between two large areas of Actively Induced Vegetation. Shantz repeats Engler’s errors i and 3. It is therefore all the more difficult to under- stand why he has, quite erroneously, replaced Engler’s correctly shown vast area, some 240 square kilometers, of Brachystc^ia Woodland (Trockenwald) between 9° S. and the Por- tuguese border with “acacia-tall grass savana.” Another serious error is f:)und in central and eastern Masailand, between the Pangani River and 37° E., where Shantz calls “acacia- desert grass savana” what in reality is mostly dense, thorny, deciduous bush. For the admittedly highly variegated vegetation pattern of the coastal hinterland be- tween 6° and 11° S. Engler coined the obviously fame de mieiix term Parkartiges Gelwlz des Kustenlandes; Shantz shows “thorn forest”; Koegel, the compiler of the vegetation map in the 1933 edition of Meyers Grosser Hand-Atlas, gives “lower tropical rain forest,” a term that unfortunately has gone into several modern school atlases.

APPENDIX II-NOTE ON SOURCE MATERIALS The basic source materials were the author’s own field books and travel diaries covering his railway and hydrographic surveys from 1913 to 1946, during all of which ample and continuous notes were made on the vegetation of the country traversed. The following approximate summary figures will show the extent of these traverses, which covered, at varying density, most parts of the Territory: I. On foot: Railway alignments 2,500 km.

TODD A FTER nearly nine years at large, meandering over a broad belt of /A good farmland, the Yellow River has again been put under control. -/ JL With the aid of staff, funds, and critical materials furnished by UNRRA, this latest task of harnessing the floods of China’s most unruly stream took a little more than a year, beginning in early 1946. The main flow was turned back into its old course in mid-March, 1947; the work of cutting off seepage and completing waterproofing of the main diversion dam lasted several weeks longer. The project was given top priority because of the effect it would have on the world’s food supply and the prompt aid it would give China in her postwar emergency. It was carried out under difficulties because of the chaotic conditions in which China found herself at the close of World War II. Effect of 1938 Diversion China’s millions had been hungry for eight years; for the Great Plain, with its more than 50 million people, must produce normal grain crops to prevent famine. This vast area has been built up by deposits spilled over the banks of the Yellow River. The deposits that reach the delta and the sea in average years total an estimated 22 billion cubic feet, or some 500,000 acre- feet — if all the flow is held within the diked course.^ China’s increasing population has always settled on every acre of this land as rapidly as it could be reclaimed. Estimates made in northern Shantung in 1920 by American missionaries in Tehsien (Techow) showed a density of 1200 to 1500 people to a square mile in rural areas. They are not importers of food, with the exception of a few luxuries in small quantities. It is because of this crowding and the need for full crop production that a major change in the course of the Yellow River has an immediate effect on the food supply of large numbers. Such was the case in June, 1938, when the south main dike was cut at the village of Huayuankou (flower-garden mouth), about eight miles east of the Peiping-Haiikow Railway bridge where the alluvial fan spreads out from the high loess bluffs of Honan. The cut was made to block the advance of the Japanese Army after its capture of Kaifeng. Already, how- ^ O. J. Todd and S. Eliassen: The Yellow River Problem, Trans. Amer.

No. 6 , 1926, pp. 50-51- -0 40 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW ever, thousands of farmers had fled to western Honan and Shensi, abandoning huge tracts of good farming lands that were soon to be inundated. The topography of the country about the point of diversion is such that no natural divide prevents the Yellow River from flowing southeast to join the Hwai west of Pengpu, as happened in the 1938 diversion. A similar break in the south dikes of the Yellow River less than 10 miles east of the Huayuan- kou break of 1938 occurred in 1887, when neglect and insufficient stone pro- tection caused the failure. Though the Chinese tackled the job of rediversion at once, it took two seasons to get the flow back into the old channel. But the long war lasting from 1937 to 1945 prevented any such prompt check on the river’s most recent rampage. In 1944, when China urgently asked the assistance of the United Nations, it was asserted that here was an opportunity to increase the world’s food supply by an estimated two million tons annually through rehabilitation of nearly two million acres of good farmland that had been partly or entirely taken out of dependable production. There was also the need of relieving Shensi and western Honan of the burden of feeding the refugee farmers and returning them — six million of them — to their old lands. But first the Yellow River must be thrown back into its old course, the flooded area drained, and the tributaries of the Hwai River cleaned of the new mud and sand deposits carried into them from the Yellow River basin during the years that “China’s Sorrow” had been trespassing over another river’s territory. In the past 42 centuries the Yellow River has followed 15 main channels for long distances, nine of them widely divergent.^ The many mended breaks along the present channel are indicated by loop dikes all along the eastern Honan, Hopei, and western Shantung stretches of the main dike system. Breaks have also occurred in Shantung east of the Tientsin-Pukow Railway. That between Putai and Litsing in 1921 is the most notable; it was not entirely mended until the summer of 1923. Another major dike break, at Linpuchi in western Shantung in 1935, let the entire river flow through regions just west of the Grand Canal; this breach was healed in the spring of 1936. Remnants of major diking systems nearly as far north as Tehsien, Shantung, and extending south into the region of Suchow, Kiangsu, tell part of the river’s history. After the Chinese had held the river to one main course for five centuries (1324 to 1851-1852), with its mouth near Haichow on the Yellow Sea, it was not considered practical to throw it back into the heavily silted channel abandoned when a dike break occurred in 1851 near Lanfeng, Honan.

A substantial diking system maintained this new course with only temporary interruptions up to the time of the man-made breach of June, 1938, at Huayuankou. For the present at least, this seems to be the logical channel for the discharge of this principal artery of North China. Nature and Habits of the River In the early autumn of 1945 I was invited to represent UNRRA as chief ‘‘adviser’* to the Yellow River Commission, working with that organiza- tion, the National Conservancy Commission of China, and CNRRA (China Relief and Rehabilitation Administration), as well as with UNRRA, which was appointing me and to which I would regularly report. The Yellow River was an old friend; the invitation to wrestle again with its dragons was entic- ing; I accepted, drew up tentative plans for diversion based on the sketchy information available, and ordered equipment and supplies to be shipped from Portland, Oreg., for delivery to Shanghai before February, 1946. Long familiarity with this river had taught that silt loads might be, for a time, as high as 40 per cent of the flow by weight, though such concentra- tions were rarely found farther downstream than Tungkwan, at the great elbow in Shensi Province where the muddy Wei Ho comes in from the west bringing the silty flow from the King River. Both streams rise in the heart of the region with heaviest silt overburden. During the work of irrigation development for the Wei-Pei region of Shensi in 1931-1932 the China International Famine Relief Commission found that the King River had mud loads carrying 48 per cent by weight in solids. Investigations on the Fen Ho near Taiyuan, Shansi, showed 23 per cent of solids by weight at flood time. According to the Yellow River Commission a small tributary of the Yellow River in western Shansi near Liu Lin had a silt content of 33 per cent during the summer freshets in 1935. But in the low- water season in the winter and early spring one can swim in the Yellow River without getting muddy; the silt content then is less than i per cent. The rainy season is in the summer, usually beginning in late June and ending in mid-September. It rarely lasts more than three months in the Yellow River basin. On the Great Plain average annual rainfall is little more than 20 inches in the north, but it increases toward the south. However, the main watershed of the Yellow River to the west of the Great Plain has an average annual rainfall of only about 12 inches, and in Mongolia it is con- siderably less. Data are few, and the figures adopted are combined from reports considered the most dependable. Although in the early 1920*8 American engineers had placed maximum Fig. j-Building large earth dike at west end of closure strurture at Huayuankou, Fig. j-Wheelbarrow coolies moving earth to build closure dike at Huayuankoii, Honan, April, i%(i, June, 1946.

This is approximately one-third of the estimated maximum flow of the Mississippi or the lower Yangtze. But the heavy silt load adds enormously to the trouble of control- ling the Yellow River. And in the matter of discharge it should be stated here that the minimum flow of the river at the Peiping-Hankow Railway bridge, the head of the great alluvial fan, is estimated at about 5000 cubic feet a second. This extreme fluctuation in flow suggests a comparison with the Colorado. Very little winter precipitation falls on the Yellow River water- shed, so that the melting of snow is of minor importance in river stage; but when it does come, in late March or early April, the so-called '‘peach blossom” flood occurs in Honan and Shantung. This early-spring rise rarely brings a discharge above 75,000 cubic feet a second. Then the river drops back rapidly to low-water stage until the advent of the summer rains. All river engineers in China know these habits, and the “river police” responsible for dike maintenance plan their work according to the season. They know when to expect mud and rain and when the dust storms arc"
