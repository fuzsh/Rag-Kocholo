        "text": "Austen St. Barbe Harrison was a British-born architect. While British, Harrison spent most of his career overseas, and mainly in the Middle East. His works include the British Representative's Residence, Amman, the High Commissioner's Residence, Jerusalem, the Rockefeller Museum, Jerusalem, 1935, and Nuffield College, Oxford.\n\nHarrison maintained a deep passion for the East, especially for Palestine. His buildings defined the architectural image of the period of the British Mandate in Palestine.\n\nPhoto by Dimitri Papadimos: Greece, Katounia\n\nHarrison was born in Kent in 1891. His upper-middle-class family pushed him to pursue a career in the military. After attending Sandhurst, he was commissioned as a Lieutenant in the British Army and found himself in the trenches at the 1917 Battle of Passchendaele, near Ypres in Flanders, Belgium, during the Great War. The horror of what he saw convinced him that he wanted no part of either the military nor the war. Harrison resigned his commission and serve as stretcher bearer for the remainder of the campaign..\n\nGreece\n\nIn 1919 Piet de Jong a British architect of Dutch descent educated in Leeds, joined the East Macedonian Reconstruction Service in order to rebuild towns destroyed during the Balkan Wars. De Jong and his close friend Austen St. Barbe Harrison worked under Thomas Mawson, a British landscape architect who was invited by the Greek government to assist Ernest Hebrard in the planning of Thessaloniki after the great fire of 1917.\n\nThe humanitarian endeavor was complemented with motorcycle escapades through Macedonia and visits to Mount Athos and Istanbul. In these travels, de Jong and Harrison became particularly interested in archaeology and Byzantine monuments. Harrison assisted the ephor of Byzantine antiquities in excavations around Thessaloniki and requested permission from British School director Alan Wace to conduct a survey of Hagia Sophia in Veroia. With the fall of Venizelos's government in 1920, the Reconstruction Service collapsed. The urban designs were finally executed in 1930, when Venizelos returned to power. Harrison left Greece in 1922 to take the position of chief architect of public works in Palestine.\n\nPalestine (1923-1937)\n\nHis next position (from 1923 onwards) was as Chief Architect to the Department of Public Works in the civil administration of British Palestine, which led to him designing various edifices in places such as Jerusalem and Amman. As the Chief Architect in Palestine from 1923 to 1937, Harrison planned many public buildings in Jerusalem and other parts of the country, most prominent among them the Rockefeller Museum and Government House, formerly the residence of the British High Commissioner and today the U.N. headquarters in Jerusalem.\n\nEgypt & England\n\nIn 1937 he left Palestine, before the Rockefeller Museum opened its doors to the public.He lived and worked in Egypt and Cyprus, After a donation to the University of Oxford from Lord Nuffield, Harrison next was appointed as architect for the newly established Nuffield College, Oxford, but the donor rejected his first plans for the college (which were heavily influenced by medieval Mediterranean buildings and traditional Arab design) and refused to allow his name to be associated with them, saying that they were \"un-English\". Harrison modified the design so that the college looked like \"something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture\", as Nuffield wanted. Harrison's rejected design has been described as Oxford's \"most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s\". Nuffield College seems to have been the only building in Britain that he designed; his other work included the University College of the Gold Coast (today's University of Ghana), and a report (in 1945) on the planning of Valletta, Malta.\n\nCyprus\n\nWhile living in Cyprus in the 1950s, Harrison befriended the writer Lawrence Durrell and helped Durrell who was struggling to support his family as a teacher. One of the fruits of Durrell's writing is his book about Cyprus, Bitter Lemons, that is dedicated to Harrison.\n\nAusten St.Barbe Harrison, architect of Government House and the Rockefeller Archeological museum, took as his younger partner the Cyprus resident architect Pierce Hubbard; the fruitful outcome of whose collaborationis seen most spectacularly, neither in Jerusalem nor in Cyprus, but in West Africa, in the campus of the University of Ghana, at Legon.\n\nOn the 10th of March 1948 a company is established in Cyprus in the name of HARRISON, BARNES AND HUBBARD . Buildings attributed to this partnership are the Nicosia Teacher's Training College (today University of Cyprus) and the University College of the Gold Coast (today the University of Ghana).\n\nThe University of Ghana was founded as the University College of the Gold Coast on August 11, 1948 as an affiliate college of the University of London, which supervised and awarded its degrees. It attained full university status in 1961. The university was created by ordinance from the work of the West African Commission of the Asquith Commission on Higher Education in the Colonies under the chairmanship of Rt. Hon. Walter Elliot. Designed by Austen Harrison, Thomas Scot Barnes & Robert Pearce Hubbard.\n\nAthens. Death.\n\nHarrison subsequently moved to Athens. There he lived with his adopted family of Dimitri Papadimos, photographer, whom he had met in Cairo in the 1930s and who was \"war photographer\" for the Greek Forces that fought by the side of the Allies during the Second World War. Dimitri's wife Liana (or Eleni Frangia, as she was known in the all-female resistance organisation SPITHA, active during the occupation of Greece by Nazi Germany), and their son Ioannis (Yani). He died at the Papadimos family home in 1976.\n\nHarrison maintained a deep passion for the East, especially for Palestine. His buildings defined the architectural image of the period of the British Mandate in Palestine."
