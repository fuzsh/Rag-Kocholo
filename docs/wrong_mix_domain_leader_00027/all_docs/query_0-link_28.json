        "text": "What went into the creation of the Parthenon? Who lived in the Tower of Babel? Why do we still care about the buildings, cities, and art of the ancient past? This course offers an introduction to the art, architecture, and material culture of the ancient world in Western Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean worlds. We will explore a diversity of powerful things and monuments from Egyptian pyramids and Near Eastern palaces, to the 'classical' art of Greece and Rome. This course offers a survey of the art of the ancient Mediterranean world. We will explore important architectural monuments, artifacts and works of art from Mesopotamia, Egypt, prehistoric Aegean and the Eastern Mediterranean, Greece and Rome, through visually rich, chronologically structured lectures. The intention is to give students a well-rounded background in the art, visual culture, architecture and archaeology of the Western Asian and Eastern Mediterranean worlds. The course starts with the monumental stone-henge like ritual architecture of the Near Eastern Neolithic, and stretches all the way to the late antique-early Islamic Jerusalem and Byzantine Istanbul/Constantinople. The survey will highlight monuments such as the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, Assyrian Palaces, Minoan palaces and frescoes, Egyptian pyramids and mortuary complexes, the Acropolis and the classical city of Athens, Ephesus, Alexandria and Pergamum, ceremonial capitals of the Persian empire in Persepolis and Pasargadae, cities and victories of Alexander the Great, Hellenistic altar of Zeus from Pergamum, Mausoleum of Halicarnassus and the Seven Wonders of the World, Republican and imperial monuments in Rome, Pompeii, and the great North African cities of the Roman Empire and finish with Istanbulâ€™s Hagia Sophia."
