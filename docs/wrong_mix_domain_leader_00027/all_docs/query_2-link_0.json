        "text": "They do great work, but this email from the Institute of Directors in New Zealand caught my eye when it showed up in my inbox just now. The truncation of their name has a certain ring to it in our current economic climate.\n\nSome pretty whack things happening in the world at the moment and a bit like the Talking Heads song, Once in a Lifetime you may ask yourself, well how did I get here? The answers are all here - the 'enshittification of everything' refracted through the history of a single town/city - Palo Alto; from the genocidal clearances of the indigenous people; to the mad race to build railways, radar, nuclear bombs and the personal computer. All told in a racy, gossiping style that sustains you to end of this three month, 720 page read. Honestly, if you want to figure out how we got here - this is the bomb. Hachette Book Group\n\nLoved this new New Zealand documentary on the legacy of Christchurch architects Sir Miles Warren and Maurice Mahoney. It's packed with gorgeous gems of Kiwi understatement, the '74 Commonwealth Games, men in walk shorts and more than a few heroes in the rise, fall and rise of the Christchurch town hall. This assured film traverses the interior anatomy of an enduring partnership, social change in NZ and the making of our urban form and is def worth catching. Rick Harvie Jane Mahoney Jonathan Hewlett WARREN AND MAHONEY\n\nHella proud of my son Felix de Jong de Jong for gaining admission to the Bar as a barrister and solicitor last Friday. Slightly bemused by the arcane rituals, expensive horse hair wigs and being gently asked to move on after we tried to grab prime seats in the defendent's dock, but it was a hugely rewarding day. Felix, Melanie and I were bursting with joy from a tough journey taken and reaching a crossing point in our respective lives. We were also made to feel special by Taina Henderson, one of the bosses at Felix's new work at Henderson Reeves Lawyers who have given him such a stimulating yet safe start to working life. It was all quite intense, and after drinks, our family repaired to the Auckland Domain to decompress on a sunny Auckland evening. Perfect.\n\nThe diving platform erected on the Auckland waterfront by Red Bull this week is seriously high. The top board comes in at 27 metres and these human gannets hit the water at 85km per hour, punching down to to about five metres in the Waitemata harbour. Just caught this on a work break...\n\nIslands of light - awesome to gather in the pre-dawn yesterday morning with the team at TGH and others who have developed the new Ruakura Inland Port. 10+ years in the making, we were on hand to see the first goods train roll into the port between what managed to be a full moon and a full sunrise at the same time. Cold as hell and coffee def needed, but a peak moment shared with great people!\n\nHuge package of new thinking and work here on the changing demands of stakeholder capitalism and need for organisations to build social capital - from my colleague (and Group MD of Baldwin Boyle) - Kylie Taylor. Kylie's perspective is informed by three decades working at the highest level across the Asia-Pacific region and by the calibre of guests she's lined up for these conversations. Reducing emissions to tackle global warming is understandably a huge focus for leadership teams everywhere right now, but 'social warming' - the increasingly kinetic, tech-driven interactions between groups (which impact on businesses) are a rapidly emerging evil twin which we ignore at our peril."
