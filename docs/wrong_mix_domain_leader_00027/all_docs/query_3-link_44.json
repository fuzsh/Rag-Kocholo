        "text": "The aim of this study was to compare left ventricular (LV) volumes and regional wall motion determined by PET with those determined by the reference technique, cardiovascular MRI.\n\nMethods: LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV), LV end-systolic volume (LVESV), and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) were measured and regional wall motion was scored in 38 patients with chronic coronary artery disease by both gated (18)F-FDG PET and MRI. A 9-segment model was used for PET and MRI to assess regional wall motion.\n\nResults: Good correlations were observed between MRI and gated PET for all parameters (r values ranging from 0.91 to 0.96). With PET, there was a significant but small underestimation of LVEDV and LVEF. Mean +/- SD LVEDV, LVESV, and LVEF for MRI were 131 +/- 57 mL, 91 +/- 12 mL, and 33% +/- 12%, respectively, and those for gated PET were 117 +/- 56 mL, 85 +/- 51 mL, and 30% +/- 11%, respectively. For regional wall motion, an agreement of 85% was found, with a kappa-statistic of 0.79 (95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.89; SE, 0.049)."
