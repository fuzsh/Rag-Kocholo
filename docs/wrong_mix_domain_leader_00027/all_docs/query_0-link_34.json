        "text": "NET ZERO STATEMENT &\n\nCARBON REDUCTION PLAN\n\nProjective Group\n\nPublication Date: July2023\n\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan details Projective Group’s organisational carbon footprint (baseline year FY22) and confirms our commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2040.\n\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan will be updated annually and published on Projective Group’s website. The plan has been approved by the Projective Group board, and is owned by CEO, Stefan Dierckx, demonstrating clear leadership commitment to emissions reduction.\n\n‘Projective Group’ is the branding used when referring to all companies owned by the privately owned company Projective Holding NV, a company registered at De Kleetlaan 5A bus 4 1831 Diegem, Belgium. The companies trading within Projective Group havebusiness operations in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.\n\nFor more information about our business, please visit our website:\n\nwww.projectivegroup.com\n\nOur commitment to achieving Net Zero\n\nIn September 2023 Projective Group committed to achieving Net Zero emissions across our operations and supply chain by 2040 -10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement.\n\nWe are signatories to The ClimatePledge, and by association became a member of the UNFCCC’s Race to Zero Campaign.\n\nBaseline emissions are a record of the greenhouse gases (GHG) that have been produced in the past and were produced prior to the introduction of any strategies to reduce emissions. Baseline emissions are the reference point against which emissions reduction can be measured.\n\nSummary baseline year emissions:\n\n3,345.8 Total ton CO2e\n\n6.0Ton CO2e per FTE (based upon 588FTE at 31 December 2022)\n\nFugitive emissions are not deemed material for Projective Group (PG)\n\nPG is not involved in the transformation of raw materials\n\nPG does not consume any steam, heating or cooling\n\nNot applicable for PG\n\nPG does not produce, sell or transport any products\n\nWe currently lack capability to include waste management in the scope of our baseline calculation\n\nEmissions reduction targets\n\nWe are working on the supporting data to define interim emissions targets, and quantify the contribution of specific initiatives against these targets.\n\nPlanned Carbon Reduction Projects\n\nCompleted Carbon Reduction Initiatives\n\nProjective Group are in the process of defining, assessing feasibility and prioritising a number of Carbon Reduction Initiatives.\n\nTo date:\n\nIn September 2023 Projective Group committed to achieving Net Zero emissions by 2040.\n\nWe set a Baseline Emissions year (FY22), acting as a reference point against which emissions reductions can be measured.\n\nWe have committed to Measure and report annually on our Carbon Footprint in accordance with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard, Revised Edition 2015.\n\nPlanned Carbon Reduction Initiatives\n\nWe are currently in the process of defining, assessing feasibility and prioritising Carbon Reduction Initiatives in line with the three areas of action we have agreed to follow as a signatory to The Climate Pledge:\n\nWe are currently in the process of defining, assessing feasibility and prioritising Carbon Reduction Initiatives in line with the three areas of action we have agreed to follow as a signatory to The Climate Pledge:\n\nInitiatives under consideration:\n\nTake steps to refine our emissions calculation methodology, closing material gaps, and improving the accuracy of our data collection approach.\n\nUnderstand the requirements of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and consider submitting our carbon reduction plan to this initiative.\n\nCarbon elimination: Implement decarbonization strategies in line with the Paris Agreement through real business changes and innovations, including efficiency improvements, renewable energy, materials reductions, and other carbon emission elimination strategies.\n\nInitiatives under consideration:\n\nIncorporate energy efficiency and sustainability considerations in landlord discussions (e.g., improvements to office energy efficiency, office refurbishments, and the choice of new offices).\n\nSwitch to renewable energy across all our offices and implement further energy efficiency measures wherever possible.\n\nImplement a company-wide Travel Management Policy (and related technical solutions providing emissions data) to effectively measure and manage the environmental impacts of business travel and reduce carbon intensive travel where appropriate.\n\nDevelop and deliver bespoke and targeted sustainability training to our people.\n\nEducate, engage and empower our colleagues to lead by example and drive change both in their day to day lives and through the client work we deliver.\n\nWork with suppliers to promote and improve environmental performance, defining minimum standards for environmental sustainability for all our suppliers through the evolution of a Supplier Code of Conduct.\n\nExplore the impact of switching data centres and servers to renewable energy or migrating to net zero cloud options.\n\nConduct a global commuting and working from home survey to develop and expand our Scope 3 emissions calculation and explore ways to limit the impact of emissions from travelling to work.\n\nCreate a sustainability approach for internal events, considering potential offsetting, and integrating ESG principles into the decision-making process around travel, purchasing, food, energy and waste.\n\nCredible offsets: Neutralize any remaining emissions with additional, quantifiable, real, permanent, and socially beneficial offsets to achieve net zero annual carbon emissions by 2040.\n\nInitiatives under consideration:\n\nNear term: Offset business travel emissions from our 2022 annual offsite, and future group-wide offsite events.\n\nLong term: Seek solutions to compensate residual emissions (i.e. emissions remaining after implementation of all technically and economically feasible opportunities), through the purchase of carbon credits, in line with the group’s net zero 2040 commitment.\n\nDeclaration and Sign Off\n\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan has been completed in accordance with PPN 06/21 and associated guidance and reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans.\n\nEmissions have been reported and recorded in accordance with the published reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans and the GHG Reporting Protocol corporate standard7and uses the appropriate Government emission conversion factors for greenhouse gas company reporting. For our analysis we used ADEME, DEFRA, and EEA sources to calculate our carbon footprint. These are recognized and recommended as reliable sources of greenhouse gas emission factors by various national and international organizations, including governments.\n\nScope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have been reported in accordance with SECR requirements, and the required subset of Scope 3 emissions have been reported in accordance with the published reporting standard for Carbon Reduction Plans and the Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.\n\nThis Carbon Reduction Plan has been reviewed and signed off by the board of directors of Projective Group.\n\nStefan Dierckx, Chief Executive Officer\n\nDate: 7/13/2023\n\nReference Information\n\nPolicy Name: Carbon Reduction Plan\n\nPolicy Responsibility: Will Thomas\n\nKey Contacts: Will Thomas, Dries Boonen\n\nPolicy Version: 1.0\n\nApproved by: Stefan Dierckx,Koen De Smet, Laurent Zintz\n\nDate of approval: June 2023\n\nNext revision: June 2024"
