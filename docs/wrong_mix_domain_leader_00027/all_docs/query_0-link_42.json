        "text": "üéôÔ∏è New podcast | How can we embed nature into economic decision making? üê¶üìà In this episode, Sophia Greacen delves into the highlights of our April event, where leaders from across business, finance, government and civil society gathered to explore how we can integrate the principles of the Dasgupta Review into economic decision-making. Featuring insights from Prof. (Dr) Anusha Shah, president of Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) and Michael Mainelli, the Lord Mayor of the City of London (City of London Corporation), this episode is a must-listen for those wondering how nature is already being embedded into leadership roles in business and government. Links to listen in the comments üéßüëá #DasguptaReview #Leadership #Biodiversity #Economics\n\nThis morning, we published the #LondonClimateResilienceReview, an independent report to the Mayor of London looking at how well-prepared London is for more frequent and severe #heatwaves, #floods, #storms, #droughts, #wildfires and other #climate risks. https://lnkd.in/e9ih3Gzi We are entering a new era. In 2024, even as El Ni√±o fades, we are set for another record-breaking year of deadly heatwaves, wildfires and storms. In the last year, floods in the UK have upended lives and battered local economies. The Mayor of London took a world-leading step by calling for an independent review of London‚Äôs climate resilience. The health and security of Londoners and the health of the national economy are inseparable. This is a reset moment for efforts to increase the UK‚Äôs stability in the face of global climate disruption. As the new government takes action to end the cost-of-living crisis, protecting the lives and livelihoods of working people from extreme weather is non-negotiable. We spoke to individuals, communities and organisations including the NHS, Transport for London, London Fire Brigade, the Metropolitan Police, Borough Councils, the GLA, UK government, NGOs, the financial services sector, sports and cultural institutions as well as representatives of vulnerable groups. We have made 50 recommendations for action to get ahead of climate risks in London and other cities around the world. You can read the full report, press release, reactions and our interim report here: https://lnkd.in/e9ih3Gzi George Leigh Johanna Sutton Mayor of London London Climate Change Partnership (LCCP) London Sustainable Development Commission #ClimateResilience\n\n#ICE East Midlands Regional Visit It was great to hear about the brilliant nature-based projects, partnerships, and solutions to the real fluvial and coastal flooding impacts in the region. Did you know that over 20% of the area is in Flood Zone 2 and over 400,000 people are in flood risk areas? This massively impacts both urban centres and nationally important agriculture land. NbS for Communities Over lunch, speakers Janice Bradley MBE, Bryony Harrison, Ian Nicholson, and Alex McDonald showcased examples of partnerships in the East Midlands region ‚Äì Moors for the Future Partnership, Mansfield SuDS, and Stamford North to name a few. Key takeaway is the importance of trust and understanding of stakeholders‚Äô motivations to solve for local flooding problems. Also in her keynote speech, Prof. (Dr) Anusha Shah stated that ‚Äúno team, region, or country has all the solutions‚Äù, but we can all work together and share learnings. #EMMAs Congratulations to all the awardees at the East Midlands Merit Awards. It was great to meet colleagues, fellow early careers and ICE committee, and project teams. The night was completed by wonderful storytelling from explorer Benedict Allen, and his inspiring stories about learning from indigenous people for his literal survival. A big thank you to ICE regional director Jo Barnett MCIPR and her team for arranging the visit, as well as to regional chair James Kirkham for hosting both events. Looking forward to more inspiring events like this!

IWED is celebrated on 23 June every year around the world to honour women in engineering. It focuses on raising the profile of women who are changing the field of engineering one degree at a time. An initiative by IABSE's President, you will find in this banner inspiring messages from the Presidents and Chair of four international associations: Dr. Tina Vejrum (IABSE), Prof. (Dr) Anusha Shah Shah (ICE), Ms. Ines Ferguson (EFCA), Ms. Catherine Karakatsanis, (FIDIC), and Dr Michele Kruger Pr Eng (FIDIC). When we embrace equity, we embrace diversity and inclusion, to help drive success for all. Join IABSE, ICE, EFCA and FIDIC in this endeavour, and tag your female colleagues to celebrate the IWED!

He designed canals, bridges, watermills, lighthouses, piers, dams, steam engines and pumping engines for coalfields and harbours. As a centre of engineering excellence since 1821, Heriot-Watt University is proud to celebrate this important anniversary. We were founded as the world's first Mechanics' Institute in 1821 and the ‚ÄòWatt‚Äô in our name is James Watt, the 18th century Scottish engineer and inventor. A wealth of civil engineering history and artefacts is hosted on our Edinburgh Campus at the ICE Scotland Museum, a collection of items owned by the Scotland Region of the Institution of Civil Engineers: https://lnkd.in/dcpQ_mQ3 And this September, Heriot-Watt‚Äôs School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society is planning to host a seminar celebrating John Smeaton‚Äôs 300th anniversary. Professor Muhammed Basheer, Executive Dean of the School of Energy, Geoscience, Infrastructure and Society, said: ‚ÄúToday, we celebrate a true pioneer of civil engineering, John Smeaton, whose technical genius has left an indelible mark on our world. \" ‚ÄúAt Heriot-Watt University, we take immense pride in our rich heritage of engineering excellence that dates back more than 200 years. As the world's first Mechanics' Institute, we honour the legacy of engineers like Smeaton and our own namesake, James Watt.‚Äù Smeaton was born in Leeds on 8 June 1724. His achievements include helping to develop modern concrete and pioneering a new design of lighthouse at the Eddystone Lighthouse, built on a rock out to sea south west of Plymouth. In 1771, Smeaton also founded the first engineering society in the world, the Society of Civil Engineers, which still meets today. Happy 300th birthday John Smeaton."
