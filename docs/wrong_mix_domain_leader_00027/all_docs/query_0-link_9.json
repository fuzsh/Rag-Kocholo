        "text": "Series V: Piet de Jong' s Watercolors of the Pylos Frescoes\n\nBiographical Note\n\nPiet de Jong was born in 1887 and died on April 20, 1967. He was of Dutch origin, but he was born and brought up in Yorkshire, England. He trained as an architect and began to practice architecture in Leeds in Yorkshire before the WW I. Piet de Jong first came to Greece immediately after the First World War as a member of an architectural commision working under the Greek government in Macedonia. It was in Greece that he met his wife, Effie, who came from Scotland but who had been working in Greece since before the war. Through her it seems he was brought into touch with the British School of Archaeology at Athens, and he served as architect and draughtsman on the BSA’s excavations directed by Alan Wace at Mycenae in the 1920’s. At the same time through the British School he came to work for Sir Arthur Evans at Knossos. He also worked at Sparta and Perachora. During WW II he was employed in making precision tools in a factory in London. From 1947 until 1952 he served as Curator for the British School of Archaeology at Knossos. He later worked for many American excavations: at Eutresis with Hetty Goldman, at the Athenian Agora, at Prosymna, Zygouries, Nemea and Pylos with Carl W. Blegen, and at Lerna and Kea with Jack L. Caskey.\n\nContents\n\nThere are 86 watercolors of the Pylos frescoes by Piet de Jong in the ASCSA Archives.
