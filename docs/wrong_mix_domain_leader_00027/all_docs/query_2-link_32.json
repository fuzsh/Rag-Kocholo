Once the relevant documentation has been prepared, the donations are packaged and shipped by RX Crossroads (U.S.A.), Gerinnungs Zentrum Rhein-Ruhr (GZRR) (Germany), or De Jong Special Services (Netherlands).\n\nAs part of the donation process, the WFH will review the utilization of donated product. This is a crucial step, as we need to understand the true need for donations and the distribution infrastructure status. Therefore, we have created an online database to facilitate reporting and processing of submitted reports.\n\nTo learn more about the WFH Humanitarian Aid Program, click here.\n\nThe information on the WFH website is provided for general information purposes only.

He believed that patient organizations could be much more effective—and do more to represent the interests of people living with bleeding disorders—if they worked together. The first WFH Congress was held in Copenhagen, Denmark, on June 25, 1963, and was attended by representatives from 12 countries. Now, the WFH and our global network of national member organizations (NMOs) represent the interests of people with hemophilia and other inherited bleeding disorders in 147 nations."
