        "text": "An exciting, rewarding year has unfolded for faculty and students in the Classics Department.\n\nIn July, Jack Davis' 1998 book, \"Sandy Pylos,\" was presented, in its Greek translation, in Pylos. And in early November, a team from the department shared its first public presentation of this season's results from an ancient site in Albania.\n\nThere, in limited digging in September, evidence of earlier religious activity than previously thought was revealed, producing the most significant finds to date.\n\nIn this month's Q&A, Davis discusses the impact of the department's ongoing work in Albania, and the ties between UC and the American School of Classical Studies in Athens.\n\nQ) Your 1998 book, \"Sandy Pylos,\" traced Pylos' archaeological history and that of the surrounding region. Why did you take on such an effort at that point in your life and career, and what was the reaction from readers and peers? And as an author and scholar, what was the significance for you of \"Sandy Pylos\" being presented this summer  in its Greek translation  in Pylos?\n\nA) In writing this book the intent was to turn things on their head a bit. Usually archaeological projects publish detailed results first in scholarly papers, then write general books. We were trying to do the reverse  so that we could quickly reach a wide audience, and particularly, a general audience, rapidly. The book also served to force me and members of my team to think synthetically. I could not be more delighted that it has been translated into Greek. Only in this way can our work be of real service to the people who live in the area where we worked; our \"research\" is their \"history\"!\n\nQ) Next July, you'll assume the director's role at the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. For the third time, a UC professor has been named to this post  what are some of the duties, demands and rewards of the job, and how will the directorship complement your role and work at UC?\n\nA) As director, it will be my job to oversee some 100 employees, to facilitate the programs of dozens of faculty researchers from more than 200 universities, and to contribute to the education of several dozen graduate students enrolled at the top programs in Classics in the United States.\n\nIn addition, I will be responsible for general oversight of the administration of the Gennadios Library, the top research library in the world that is devoted to modern Greek history. My service as director sends a message to the world of Classical archaeology that UC remains a principal player and continues to be committed to supporting a first-rate program in Classical archaeology.\n\nQ) How meaningful and critical are the ties between the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and UC?\n\nA) Our department's history has been intertwined with that of ASCSA since 1927, when Wil Semple, the first head of Classics, created an archaeology program here and hired the assistant director of ASCSA, Carl Blegen, to head it. ASCSA is the only institution authorized to intermediate between American universities and the Greek government and, as such, plays a significant role in all research in Greece.\n\nOur students generally spend a year or more in Athens as its students, and the training they receive there forms a significant component in their education. We almost always have two to three students there, generally supported by Fulbrights or other fellowships that they win in competition. In addition, every program of archaeological research that we have undertaken has been conducted under the auspices of ASCSA.\n\nQ) What finds from this past season's work in Albania are of particular importance, given discoveries of the past? How overwhelming is the work> And what do students gain from public presentations of findings, such as the Nov. 1 event in Blegen Library?\n\nA) The most important thing is that we documented the use of the sanctuary already as early as the mid-7th century B.C. At the same time, our discoveries for the first time documented Greek presence this early along the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, in Albania.\n\nThe work is overwhelming! We usually say that it takes three years to publish results from one year in the field. It must be a team effort, and we try to involve our students in the effort insofar as possible. Public presentations are a significant part of their education.\n\nQ) On Nov. 13, you were in Athens to make remarks at the Benaki Museum's exhibit of artworks by archaeological illustrator Piet de Jong. UC, which has one of the world's largest collections of de Jong's work, has loaned artworks for the exhibition. What is important and distinctive about de Jong's work, especially in terms of ongoing work by UC researchers, and how good is the UC collection?\n\nA) His illustrations are works of art; his career was inextricably tied to that of Carl Blegen. From my remarks for the Nov. 13 opening:\n\n\"The present celebration of de Jong's illustrations is a splendid occasion for us to reflect on what we have lost since earlier days of Greek archaeology. His work for (Carl) Blegen was part of a synergy that existed between Cincinnati and the Agora Excavations of ASCSA. De Jong depended for his livelihood on commissions: in 1953 he wrote to Blegen that '...Pylos is the only source of work likely to give me sufficient employment to justify the expenses of coming out ... If you could supply me with 3 months work, then I should come out somewhat earlier ... and there might be things in the Agora to do, though I think I cleaned them out pretty thoroughly this year.'\n\n\"But de Jong's contracts and friendships also cut across national and linguistic boundaries to include much of the archaeological community in Greece: from Levi at Phaistos, to Platon in the Heraklion Museum, to Wace at Mycenae, to Blegen  not to mention dozens of other collaborations with giants of our field at Knossos, Halai, Eutresis, Yiriza, Sparta, Perachora. Vathypetro, Lerna, Nemea, Tegea, and Gordion. \"At a time when our scholarly worlds often seem fractured by competition and other disharmonies, de Jong's single-minded and selfless devotion to his calling may be a worthy model for us all.\""
