        "text": "Fantastic 5 days at the #unwaterconference2023 in New York! Last couple of days met so many amazing people with a common agenda of helping bring the world to value #water, mitigate #climatecrisis, use #watercircularity in harmony with nature and in a socially equitable way. What's not to like about all this?! Day before attended a hugely popular event on 'Turning the tide on Water Reuse' at the New York Times office New York Times Events, superbly chaired by Stephen Dunbar- Johnson, President International, NY Times (found that we have a common friend, small world!!) with speakers from the UNDP, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Veolia Water Technologies and others. Dinner that evening with my Arcadis family was fun as usual, heard about how Arcadians were leading and participating at various events at the conference and making a difference by sharing knowledge and by planning the next action needed to take the conversations forward and convert them into projects on ground. So proud of the team!!! Ended the week by chairing a hugely inspiring session on 'Public Private Participation on Enabling Innovation'. It was organised by the wonderful Braulio Eduardo Morera from the 50L Home Coalition. It was great to share the panel with innovators Sarah Musiker, Aaron Tartakovsky, Ben Stapleton and Tara Helms. It's been a truly rewarding trip, learned a lot, made some meaningful connections and met in person my Arcadis global team and many in my network who I had been collaborating with but had not met in person. Huge thanks to everyone who made this trip possible! Now it's time for action on ground....
