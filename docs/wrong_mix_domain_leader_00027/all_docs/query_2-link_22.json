        "text": "5. Museum Study of Animal Bones\n\nby Paul Halstead (University of Sheffield) and Valasia Isaakidou (University College London)\n\nThis year we worked three weeks in Chora Museum, longer than in previous years, but were not allowed to work seven days per week as last year, so the available study time was not increased. This year we identified and recorded two further contexts from the Belvedere area studied in 2001:\n\nMB Belvedere W13 South end B1, 2, 3, 19, 20, 21, 25, 32\n\nBelvedere (W13) B4, B5, B24, B32 Between Wall F & G.\n\nWe also studied and recorded a series of groups of bone from PNW, with labels of variable precision:\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 1\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 1?\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 1/8.8 10.6.58 GP\n\nâbox PNW 1958 Trench 1/8 9.6.58â + âPNW Trench 11 7.6.58 Depth 0.80-0.95 S 107â\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 2\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 3\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 5\n\nâbox PNW 1958 Trench 8 e[k to]u okhetouâ + âbox PNW 1958 Trench 16 okhetosâ\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 8 5.6.58 P 60 S 106\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 8A 6.5.58 P 63 S 103\n\nPNW Trench 9 Tmima A Depth 1.00-1.30 zembilia 1-6, 130, 131, 184. 10.6.58, 11.6.58, 23.6.58\n\nPNW 1958 Trench 11 (Nobis paper label for bear and boar metapodials âPNW Trench 11 07.06.58â)\n\nPNW 1958 Trench 11 [sic!]\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 11 Depth 0.55-0.80 6.5.58 P 58 S 101\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 12\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 14\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 16\n\nbox PNW 1958 Trench 20 21.6.58\n\nbox PNW 1958 kukliko ktisma 17.6.58\n\nNobis paper label for âlion boneâ: âPNW 1958 Trench 10â.\n\nFinally, we started recording a group of contexts from the Petropoulos area:\n\nâPetropoulos Trench 1 with early Middle Helladic sherds like Lerna V (Caskeyâs)â wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos NE edge wall hunt from dark sandy earth in drainâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos NE edge wall hunt bones with late sherdsâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos NW edge wall hunt MW bones with or earlier than stonesâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos MW NE edge removing stones above steps and cleaning in front of wall mixed earthâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos Belvedere MW wall hunt NE edge NE of wall mixed black some earlierâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos MW NE edge wall hunt whitish earth above stones mostly Mycenaeanâ wooden label\n\nâPetropoulos 5 June Trench MW C . . . . part of skull MR p85â wooden label.\n\nThe same general observations can be made from this yearâs work as were made last year: the material is strikingly more mixed anatomically, taxonomically and taphonomically than the big groups of burnt bone studied in 2000; by far the commonest taxa are pig and sheep; and red deer continue to be the commonest wild animal. Ultimately, it will be interesting to explore whether taxonomic composition changes through time. We continue to record butchery marks in some detail, and this year acquired a digital camera capable of capturing such features as close-up images; we hope to clarify whether methods of butchery differed between the burnt sacrifice groups and other bone refuse.\n\nThree discoveries made this year are of particular note. First, we have now located some bone fragments identified to lion and bear by Nobis; these had been removed from their original contexts, but Nobisâ notes on their provenance survive. One of his bear bones is plainly a correct identification and the second may be; his lion bone is more doubtful and, together with the uncertain bear, we have taken photographs for checking with reference material in UK.\n\nSecondly, one of the PNW contexts studied this year (box PNW 1958 Trench 11 Depth 0.55-0.80 6.5.58 P 58 S 101) contained several pieces of burnt cow bone, from the same body parts (mandible, humerus, femur) identified in the burnt sacrifice deposits. In addition, two such fragments were also found in âbox PNW 1958 Trench 1?â and one each in âbox PNW 1958 Trench 1/8 9.6.58 + PNW Trench 11 7.6.58 Depth 0.80-0.95 S 107â and PNW Trench 9 Tmima A Depth 1.00-1.30 zembilia 1-6, 130, 131, 184. 10.6.58, 11.6.58, 23.6.58â. We have been able to join the single fragment from the mixed group from trenches 1/8 and 11 with a piece from the larger group of burnt bone from Trench 11; these two fragments are derived from the unfused diaphysis of a right proximal femur of cow and this in turn matches very plausibly an unfused right proximal epiphysis from the â?PNWâ burnt bone studied in 2000. Thus we now have a very probable source for the hitherto most poorly provenanced of the burnt sacrifice groups.\n\nIncidentally, it is now clear that most of the bone housed in the Chora storeroom was more precisely provenanced than were some of the burnt sacrifice groups; these had evidently been stored separately, presumably because their interest and/or fragility had been recognised at the time of excavation. This arguably strengthens the grounds for believing that the burnt bone groups located in the storeroom can indeed be matched with those mentioned in the site publication and excavation notebooks.\n\nThirdly, research on bone contexts has led Stocker and Davis to argue that the âS2/West Chasmâ burnt sacrificial group had, prior to the wall-robbing that created the âWest Chasmâ, originally been part of the burnt bone deposit on the floor of the Archive Room. Accordingly, we went back to these two deposits this summer and eventually found a physical join between two fragments, confirming the Stocker-Davis hypothesis and so clarifying the provenance of a second burnt sacrifice group.\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that the need to search for physical joins betweens contexts of uncertain provenance has been a major cause of slow progress in this study. This time-consuming activity has paid real dividends, however, most obviously in 2002 with the PNW and S2 burnt groups, but also in 2001 with several of the more enigmatically labelled bone groups from MB Belvedere.\n\nThe reorganization work by Stocker has revolutionized the state of the Chora storeroom and it is now clear that the assemblage is considerably larger than estimated in 1998 and, of course, commensurately more valuable. Material remaining to be studied includes the following groups;\n\nEBW 1961\n\nEBW 1965\n\nEBW Trench VIII 17/7/60\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-1\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-4 (â65 ext)\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-5\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-6\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-10\n\nJP 1964 Trench 64-11\n\nLagou\n\nLagou I\n\nLagou I Palace period - Pre-Palace period\n\nLagos (removed from barrel 1998)\n\nLong Corridor 25 + various palace rooms\n\nPNW 1959\n\nPNW various: PNW 1963 GP (top layer)\n\nTrench S5\n\nVarious areas pulled from sherds 2002\n\nWGK4 CKK 1962\n\nTogether these amount to 6 large, 5 medium and 7 small boxes. On the twin assumptions (1) that Stocker and Davis succeed in assigning a sufficiently precise date and context on all this material to justify study and (2) that we continue to work in Chora Museum for 2-3 weeks each year, we estimate that completion of this study will take at least two, and probably three, further seasons.\n\n11. Hunting Scenes in the Frescoes\n\nby Freya Evenson (University of California at Los Angeles)\n\nIn her 1969 publication of the wall paintings from the Mycenaean palace of Pylos, M. Lang suggests that there are two distinct hunting scenes present in the fresco material: a fragmentary scene from the collapsed area in and around Room 27 (the pithos storage area); and a larger, more complete scene from a large room on the second floor above the small megaron, Hall 46. My current restudy of this material, undertaken with the kind permission of the University of Cincinnati, brings to light new information that changes our interpretation of these two interesting scenes, and makes possible a new reconstruction of the large scene from the room above Hall 46.\n\nThe fragmentary fresco material from Room 27, with its high quality of fine surface plaster, striking Egyptian Blue background, and fine detail work was likely part of the previous decorative program of the palace and was not on the walls at the time of the final destruction at the end of the LH IIIB period. In technique, color and style the Room 27 material is identical to the thousands of fragments discovered in a large plaster dump outside the palace (called the plaster dump of the northwest slope) which were most likely also from this earlier decorative program, stylistically dated to the LH IIIB period as well. Lang argues that this earlier material was used, after its fragmentation and removal from the walls, as wall and ceiling fill to provide an even surface for the new plaster layer. Nevertheless, Lang argues that the highly fragmented material from Room 27 belongs to a single, coherent scene involving hunters with spears (cat. no. 34a,b,cH27), horses (cat. no. 10C27), dogs and a wild boar (cat. no. 11C27).\n\nMy aim in restudying the Room 27 material was twofold: first I wanted to see first hand the fragments that Lang published, since the photographs are too murky to distinguish the scene she proposes; and second I hoped to find the other fragments belonging to this scene that Lang mentions but does not catalogue or photograph in order to more fully understand the hunting scene. I was successful in both counts, finding, in addition to the catalogued pieces, four additional male figures, the head of an animal (?), and the legs and a hoof of another horse. A further curious piece may be part of a wheel of a chariot.\n\nIt seems however that these fragments and those catalogued by Lang do not make up a hunting scene but rather a scene or scenes of warriors either in procession or preparing for battle. The first reason for this conclusion is that the âboarâs eyeâ fragment (cat. no. 11C27) is of a larger scale than the human figures and thus, given that these fragments were all found in a secondary use context, it is unlikely that this fragment belongs to the same scene. Second, the human figures themselves are less convincing as hunters than as warriors, especially if the prey, the boar, is removed from consideration. Three of the seven human figures wear shaggy cloaks, a garment associated in iconography more with warriors than hunters who typically wear tight tunics and kilts (cf. the hunting scene from above Hall 46 at Pylos). One wears a plain cloak (cat. no. 34cH27) while another wears a white kilt with red polka-dots and border decoration, a more elaborate costume than would be expected in a hunting scene. Two of the figures are recognized by their legs and feet only, one wearing the typical boots (âgreavesâ) of Mycenaean hunters as in the scene from above Hall 46 at Pylos, but the other leg and foot (cat. no. 34bH27) are depicted unshod. Third, the horse hooves indicate that there was a procession of horses (cat. no. 10C27 shows the tail of a second horse in front of the horse whose hoof is preserved) that moved from right to left, while at least one horse, in a fragment which Lang did not photograph, moves in the opposite direction. While horses may be associated with hunting as at Tiryns, the presence of horses moving in two opposite directions is more suited to a processional scene. Furthermore, the stances of the male figures and the horses are static; even the spears carried by the men are held vertically against the body as if they were not intended for use. These observations, together with the fact that the fragments were found in secondary use and not in their original context, make the identification of the scene as a hunt unlikely.\n\nThe large and complex hunting scene from the room above Hall 46 is, on the other hand, quite clearly just that: hunters with dogs attack at least one deer while companion panels show a procession of men bearing cauldrons and a feast most likely following the successful hunt. Lang has more extensively published this scene with black and white and color photographs and drawings by Piet de Jong. In de Jongâs reconstruction, the hunting scene is divided into panels of dark brown and light brown background where hunters holding spears move left accompanied by large black and white hunting dogs (cat. nos. 17,19,20H43 and 12,13C43). A lone hunter from the light background turns and faces to the right, poising to spear a stag who is running left towards him across the wavy zone-change line (cat. no. 16H43). These central opponents are, in de Jongâs reconstruction, the only figures who strike active poses, the other hunters and dogs moving in processional form across the panels. This staid composition is striking when compared to the hunting scenes from Tiryns and Orchomenos, where not only the prey but also the hunting dogs are depicted in flying gallop, their mouths open and their heads turned to bite their quarry.\n\nIn restudying the fragments from this scene, it became clear that de Jong left out many relevant pieces in his reconstruction that actually change the character of the scene. Most importantly, there are several animal fragments that neither de Jong nor Lang included which must belong to the hunting scene, and show that there were probably more deer and certainly more dogs involved in the hunt than represented in the publication. In particular, one fragment shows either the front or hind legs of an animal most likely in flying gallop against a light brownish yellow background. The treatment of the legs with markings for hair and the knobby knees are so similar to the well preserved stag (cat. no. 19H43) that it seems most likely that the animal is another deer belonging to this scene, and the fact that it is on the light, rather than the dark background suggests that the hunt took up a larger area in the painting than previously published. Another fragment of the torso of a similar animal, this time on a dark brown ground, and a small fragment with the leg of one white animal overlapping the haunches (?) of a tan one on a yellowish brown background indicate that as many as four, and possibly more, deer may be depicted, and, as in the fragment just mentioned, one may be attacked by hunting dogs as in the Tiryns and Orchomenos boar hunt scenes.\n\nThat there were several hunting dogs actively pursuing the deer is indicated by a well preserved but unpublished fragment showing the hindquarters of a dog in flying gallop. This dog, depicted with a white body accentuated by brown hairs, is moving left, the same direction as the original deer, but is on the lighter background. Perhaps he is associated with the legs of the deer also in flying gallop on light ground.\n\nThis dog in pose and style is quite different from the large dogs being led stately by the hunters as in cat. nos. 12,13,14C43 and I argue that those static dogs actually belong to a separate panel, depicting perhaps the procession of hunters and dogs to the area where the hunt is to take place. In this panel, as in the hunting scene proper, the background color alternates between a light yellowish brown and a darker brown, separated by wavy zone-change lines. Hunters and, I would argue, hunting dogs are represented in at least two registers processing left. In Piet de Jongâs reconstruction drawing, the hunters are in several registers but the large black and white dogs are reconstructed just in the top register, being led by one of the hunters. It appears however that the large fragment (cat. no. 12C43) which shows the hind part of a black dog in front of a white dog (who also wears a collar and is therefore probably led by the hunters) on light background also shows the curl of a tail of another black dog on a lower register just below the upper black dog. De Jong reconstructs this second black tail as part of the wavy zone-change line, which is visible behind the white dog, but in order to make this reconstruction, he had to change the angle of the fragment and bend the zone-change line too much to the left to be convincing. It is more likely that the dogs, as the hunters, were depicted on several registers and were led by the hunters painted in front of them.\n\nSeveral more hunters can also be identified as belonging to this scene, or to the panels of cauldron bearers from the same room. One fragment which preserves the upper border of the hunting scene shows the incised and painted shaft of a hunterâs spear passing over a wavy zone-change line. The angle of the spear indicates that the hunter was most likely moving left, and the light background, though poorly preserved, may put this hunter in the same panel with the shield bearer of cat. no. 18H43. Two further fragments show the boots of hunters moving left, one on a light background, the other over what appears to be the white zone in the middle of a wavy zone-change line. In style and size these boots compare more to the cauldron-bearers than the hunters, who are slightly smaller, but within each scene there is enough variation in proportion to make the assignation difficult.\n\nAs a result of the restudy of the fragments of the hunting scene from the second story room above Hall 46 the following reconstruction is offered: first, a group of hunters leading hunting dogs arranged in two or three registers move steadily to the left over both a dark and light background; second, the hunt itself is represented with more energetic stances where hunters aim at deer in flying gallop while dogs surround the prey and drive them towards the hunters; and third, hunters leave the hunting area leading their dogs (cat. no. 21H48) and perhaps carrying the spoils of the hunt to a separate location where they are joined by others bearing cauldrons and where a feast takes place.\n\nThe fact that the fragments were from an upper floor room of unknown but probably large dimensions makes the placement of the scenes on the walls difficult, but it is worth noting the distribution of the fragments within the lower rooms in which they fell. Fragments from the cauldron bearing scene and one of the newly discovered hunterâs boots comes from Room 48, to the south of Hall 46, while the processional hunters and hunting dogs come from Room 43, to the north of Hall 46. The deer and dogs of the active part of the hunting scene come from both Room 43 and Hall 46. This arrangement allows the tentative placement of the processional scene on the northwest wall of the room, the cauldron bearing scene on the southeast wall, while the hunting scene itself was between these two, either on the northeast or the southwest walls of this upper room.\n\nThe restudy of the hunting scenes from the Mycenaean Palace of Pylos has added to our understanding of Mycenaean hunting iconography in general and has changed the interpretation of the Pylos scenes in particular. Though admirably published by Lang in 1969, the important material from Pylos is in need of new investigation, especially as more comparative data are now available from other Mycenaean centers, and new techniques of conservation and photographic reproduction allow for non-destructive yet accurate reconstruction.\n\nIn my restudy of the hunting scenes from the Mycenaean Palace of Pylos, I examined the fresco fragments housed in the apotheke and vitrines of the Hora Archaeological Museum in Hora, Messenia. In the publication of the wall paintings from the palace (Lang 1969), hunting scenes were reported from Room 27 and from the complex of rooms in and around Hall 46, the âQueenâs Megaronâ of the Palace of Nestor, and so for this study I examined all the fragments from rooms 27, 43, 46 and 48 in order to locate the published material and any other fragments that may belong to these scenes.\n\nThe entire material from Room 27 was located in the apotheke and was placed in newly constructed drawers to better preserve the fragments. The material from Room 43, 48 and Hall 46 was more dispersed, located in both old and new drawers in the apotheke (by the end of the study period, most of the material in the old drawers was cleaned and stored in newly constructed drawers) and in vitrines 11 and 12 in the second room of the Hora Archaeological Museum. All fragments used in this study were cleaned by professional conservators, photographed by the staff photographer and examined by me to be included in my doctoral dissertation âHunter and Hunted in the Bronze Age Aegeanâ."
