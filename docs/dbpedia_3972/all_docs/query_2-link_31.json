        "text": "Six men have been sentenced to two to five years in jail in France over a scandal involving almost €2m (£1.8m) in kickbacks from a 1990s arms deal.\n\nThree ex-French government officials and three others were found guilty of participating in the \"Karachi affair\" - a submarine deal with Pakistan.\n\nThe deal involved secret commissions that allowed funds to return to France.\n\nSome of the money was allegedly used to fund ex-French Prime Minister Édouard Balladur's failed presidential bid.\n\nMr Balladur, now aged 91, and his then-Defence Minister François Léotard, have also been charged and face trial at the criminal court in Paris in the coming months.\n\nBoth men deny any wrongdoing.\n\nMonday's convictions are the first in a long-running investigation into the scandal.\n\nWho has been jailed?\n\nOne of the former government officials sentenced on Monday was Nicolas Bazire, who was Mr Balladur's former campaign manager and best man at ex-French President Nicolas Sarkozy's wedding to supermodel Carla Bruni in 2008.\n\nThe court said that Mr Bazire, who was ordered to spend three years in prison, \"knew perfectly well\" that illegal funds had appeared in Mr Balladur's campaign accounts.\n\nRenaud Donnedieu de Vabres, a former adviser to Mr Léotard, was also ordered to spend three years in jail.\n\nThierry Gaubert, a former aide to Mr Sarkozy - who was then the budget minister in charge of sales and commissions - got a two-year prison sentence.\n\nThe remaining men convicted in Paris were former defence contractor Dominique Castellan, who was also handed two years, and two so-called Lebanese middlemen, who were sentenced to five years.\n\nThe Lebanese businessmen, Ziad Takieddine and Abdul Rahman El-Assir, refused to appear at the Paris court and warrants have been issued for their arrest, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nWhat's the 'Karachi affair'?\n\nInvestigations into the so-called \"Karachi affair\" began after 11 French engineers were killed in a Karachi bombing in 2002.\n\nPakistani authorities blamed Islamist militants, but there were suspicions that the car bombing, which wrecked a bus, was an act of revenge after then-French President Jacques Chirac ordered the payments of secret arms deal commissions to stop.\n\nMr Balladur is alleged to have earlier approved payment of the commissions to intermediaries in the sale of three submarines to Pakistan, and that from them so-called \"retro-commissions\" came back to France to fund his 1995 presidential bid.\n\nThe kickbacks are estimated to have cost 13m francs, or almost €2m.\n\nMr Sarkozy has faced legal scrutiny over the Karachi affair. He has denied any connection to the deal.\n\nA lawyer representing the victims of the deadly Karachi bombing praised the French court's decision on Monday.\n\nOlivier Morice said that \"if the families had not lodged a complaint, there would not have been this judgment\", adding that families were now waiting for the trial of Mr Balladur and Mr Léotard."
