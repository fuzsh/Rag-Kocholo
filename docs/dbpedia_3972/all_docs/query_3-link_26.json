        "text": "Charles de Gaulle might have been horrified by the spectacle: two members of a party founded to preserve his legacy scratching each other's eyes out over the presidency.\n\nBut the Paris Mayor, Jacques Chirac, and Prime Minister Edouard Balladur have been going at it hot and heavy by French standards as the first round of the presidential elections on Sunday approaches.\n\nMr. Chirac, 62, the front-runner in the public opinion polls, is favored to come in first on Sunday. He is also favored to win an anticipated runoff vote on May 7, whether his opponent in that round is 65-year-old Mr. Balladur or the Socialist candidate, Lionel Jospin, who is 57.\n\nWith 30 to 40 percent of the voters still undecided, anything is possible. But with the 78-year-old Socialist incumbent, Francois Mitterrand, ill with prostate cancer and playing no role in the campaign, most of the attention has focused on the internecine struggle in the conservative camp.\n\nThis is Mr. Chirac's third run at the presidency; it is Mr. Balladur's first. It is not a pretty picture, two old friends locked in combat over an office Mr. Chirac thought Mr. Balladur had conceded when he became Prime Minister two years ago. The appointment was part of a division of spoils after their neo-Gaullist Rally for the Republic party and its allies won parliamentary elections.\n\nSo intense has the battle been that Charles Pasqua, the tough Interior Minister and Mr. Balladur's biggest supporter in the Cabinet, said the campaign had been \"disgusting.\"\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
