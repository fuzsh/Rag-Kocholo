        "text": "When Socialist candidates win big in Europe, stock markets usually nose-dive, but the Paris Bourse bucked that historical tide and rose strongly today, the day after France's Socialist President, Francois Mitterrand, won election to a new seven-year term.\n\nWhat is more, the French franc -which many economists feared might plunge following a Mitterrand victory - rose slightly against both the dollar and the West German mark in European trading today. Later, in New York, the franc was up slightly against the dollar and down a bit against the mark.\n\nIt was a far cry from 1981, when the French stock market fell 20 percent in two days and the franc plummeted after Mr. Mitterrand's election. At that time, he ran on a joint platform with the Communist Party that called for sweeping nationalizations and a huge increase in social spending.\n\n''Seven years ago the Socialists proposed a new type of society and put into question the free-market policies we lived under,'' said Thierry Huon, an analyst with Rondeleux Oudart, a French brokerage. ''Today, however, the stock market didn't fall because President Mitterrand has not promised much to his Socialist backers except to impose a tax on great fortunes.''\n\nFrom 1981 to 1983, Mr. Mitterrand's Government adopted a go-it-alone radical program of nationalizations and pump-priming that aimed to reduce France's unemployment rate, which remains high to this day. That strategy led to inflationary pressures and trade-deficit problems and ultimately to a crisis of confidence for the franc.\n\nIn response, Mr. Mitterrand's Government took a distinct right turn -to the dismay of his left-wing supporters. His economic approach went from being Socialist to being Social Democrat as it began focusing more on reducing inflation and encouraging investment.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
