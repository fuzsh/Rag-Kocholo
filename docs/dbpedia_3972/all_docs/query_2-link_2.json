        "text": "(born 1929). Socialist President François Mitterrand named Édouard Balladur of the Gaullist Rally for the Republic (RPR) prime minister of France on March 29, 1993. Balladur headed the “cohabitation” government after the conservative parties’ victory over the Socialists in the National Assembly elections of March 21 forced Mitterrand to choose a right-wing head of government. The former finance minister took office at a time when the economy of France was in recession and unemployment was quite high. Many of the measures taken by Balladur in his attempts to improve the economic picture (including a tax increase) might have made him immediately unpopular with the French populace but, amazingly, they did not. He continued to enjoy high popularity ratings until he decided to run for the presidency of France in 1995 against Jacques Chirac, a fellow member of the Gaullist RPR. Chirac ultimately won that election.\n\nBalladur was born on May 2, 1929, in Izmir (Smyrna), Turkey, into a wealthy banking family, and he grew up in Marseille after the family relocated to France in 1935. He received diplomas in law and political science, in addition to a degree from the prestigious École Nationale d’Administration. In 1957 Balladur began his public career when he joined the diplomatic service as an official in the Council of State. During the years 1964–68, he was an adviser to Prime Minister Georges Pompidou. He then served as deputy secretary-general (1969) and as secretary-general (1974) during Pompidou’s presidency. In 1977 Balladur left public service to become chairman of Générale de Service Informatique. He held the post until 1986. From 1980 to 1986 he was also president of Compagnie Européenne d’Accumulateurs. He left the private sector in 1986 to enter the National Assembly and become minister of economy, finance, and privatization in the cohabitation government of Prime Minister Jacques Chirac. It was Chirac who promoted Balladur for the position of prime minister in 1993, and Balladur’s decision to run against Chirac for the presidency in 1995 was seen as tantamount to treason by some. However, when Chirac and Balladur split the conservative vote, Balladur threw his support behind Chirac, who then won the runoff election."
