        "text": "The Hard Core: The Franco-German Relationship and Agricultural Crisis Politics in the European Union\n\nDouglas Webber\n\n© Douglas Webber, December 1998\n\nEuropean University Institute, Working Paper RSC No 98/46\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThis paper analyses two series of conflicts over agricultural and agricultural trade policy in the European Union (EU), the first surrounding the creation of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the early 1960s and the second the reform of the CAP and the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations in the early 1990s. It argues that, in each case, the stance(s) taken by the French and German governments were decisive for the outcome of the conflicts: where both governments opposed a given project, it was blocked; where both supported it, it was approved; where the two governments were divided, the outcome - until such time as they found a modus vivendi - was crisis and deadlock. Explanations of the conflicts and their outcomes based on alternative models or images of EU politics are discussed, but rejected. Franco-German conflict-mediation and the 'pre-forming' of multilateral decisions through bilateral bargains between Bonn and Paris are not ubiquitous in the EU. However, these practices have been and are still often followed to resolve major crises in the union and are by no means limited to the 'high-political' treaty negotiations typically analysed by intergovernmentalist theorists of EU politics and integration. The multilateralisation of Franco-German bargains may be facilitated by the fact that the two states often represent 'opposed poles' in the union, so that a bilateral Franco-German agreement is likely to lie close to the median position of the member states as a whole.\n\nI. Introduction (1)\n\n1. Models of EU politics\n\nThe growing volume of social scientific inquiry into the European integration process and the politics of the EU (European Union)(2) in recent years has produced a growing number of models or images which purport to explain, or to capture the essence of, this process, to identify the most powerful actors in it, and/or to explain patterns of policy decisions or choices.\n\nRoughly seven models may be identified. The first and oldest of these, the neo-functionalist model, argues that the application of supranational problem solutions in certain economic sectors creates inexorable pressures for their extension to others, so that integration 'spills over' from one sector to others. It predicts, as private actors transfer their loyalties from national to supranational political organs, the waning of national governments and the gradual emergence of legitimate and powerful supranational political institutions capable of developing autonomous policies and imposing them on actors in the member states.\n\nA second model, which displays \"important affinities\" with neo-functionalism, is transaction-based integration or transnational exchange theory (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 300). This model departs from the observation that political integration (supranational governance) has advanced further and more rapidly in some policy domains than in others. Differences in the level of supranational governance between policy areas or sectors are a function of differences in levels of cross-border transactions and communications: \"As transnational exchange rises, so does the societal demand for supranational rules and organizational capacity to regulate\" (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 306). Policy areas can be located on a continuum from intergovernmental to supranational governance depending on the value of three variables: transnational society (\"non-governmental actors who engage in intra-EU exchanges - social, economic, political\"), EU organisations (\"governmental structures, operating at the European level, that produce, execute, and interpret EC rules\") and EU rules (\"the legal, and less formal, constraints on behavior produced by interactions among political actors operating at the European level\") (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 304). Although intergovernmental decision-making is \"ubiquitous\" in the EU and \"present even at the the far right-hand pole\" of the continuum, the model predicts increasing levels of supranational governance as transnational society develops. The three variables above, being \"constitutive of supranational politics ... must move together, and disjunctures that do occur in movement are short-lived\" (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 305). Transnational exchange theorists concur with neo-functionalists in observing the operation of a 'spill-over' process: \"Once fixed in a given domain, European rules ... generate a self-sustaining dynamic that leads to the gradual deepening of integration in that sector and, not uncommonly, to spillovers into other sectors\" (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 299).\n\nThe third is the intergovernmentalist model, which developed from the realist stream of international relations theory and in which the dominant actors in the EU remain the governments of the member states or, as in Moravcsik's analysis of the origins of the Single European Act, the governments of the three big member states - France, Germany and Britain (Moravcsik 1991) (3). In the realist tradition, international organisations, such as the EU, are dominated by their biggest members because they are dependent on the latter for resources. Major EU decisions, according to Moravcsik (1991), are essentially lowest common-denominator bargains struck between these three states, whose governments are at pains at protect their sovereignty; the integration process, far from being smooth and unilinear as the neo-functional model seems to imply, is typically slow, contingent and potentially reversible. One other study of the origins of the Single European Act attributes the dominant role of the big member states - in this case, just France and Germany - to their ability to pull along' other member states with them either by threatening explicitly to implement their proposals bilaterally if they should not be accepted by other member states or by offering them side-payments to compensate for the otherwise possibly negative effect of their proposals on the other states or both (Garrett 1992: 543-547). In his analysis of the Single European Act, Moravcsik also identifies side-payments as the principal mechanism whereby big member states 'bought' the compliance of small member states in the act and argues that France and Germany secured British acceptance of the project by threatening otherwise to create a 'two-track' Europe which would have left Britain \"without a say in the details of the new agreements\" (Moravcsik 1991: 25-26, 36). A fourth model is that of multi-level governance. Proponents of this model accept that member-state governments remain the \"most important pieces of the European puzzle\" (Marks et al. 1996: 346), but maintain that decision-making competencies are shared by actors at different levels, that supranational institutions exercise an independent influence on policy outcomes, that national governments no longer have a monopoly of the representation of the interests of national groups vis-à-vis EU institutions and that, moreover, the integration process has, to a significant degree, eroded national sovereignty.\n\nA fifth model - or rather group of models - may be labelled institutionalist (see, for example, Scharpf 1988; Bulmer 1993 and 1994; Garrett 1995; Garrett and Tsebelis 1996; Moser and Schneider 1997). Institutionalist models ascribe the balance of power between different actors in the EU and policy patterns to institutional structures or arrangements, which may include informal 'rules of the game' as well as formal legislative or decision-making procedures. In as far as institutional structures vary across issue-areas, so, too, will the balance of power between actors and policy patterns, making it impossible to make general statements about these questions for the EU as a whole. Up until the revision of voting practices in the Council of Ministers through the Single European Act in the late 1980s, institutionalist interpretations of the EU (see, for example, Scharpf 1988) typically came to similar conclusions to those reached by intergovernmentalist theorists inspired by international relations realism, namely that the EU was firmly in the grip of the national governments, albeit, unlike some realists, they did not explicitly make any differentiation between the member states in terms of their capacity to shape or veto EU decisions.\n\nThe sixth model identifiable in the literature is that of epistemic communities, networks of \"professionals with recognised expertise and competence in a particular domain and an authoritative claim to policy-relevant knowledge\", sharing the same normative and principled beliefs, the same causal beliefs, the same notions of validity and a \"common policy enterprise\" (Haas 1992: 3). Other things being equal, in a political system like that of the EU, which is subject to less democratic control and scrutiny than national political systems, there is likely to be a higher propensity for such groups of 'experts' to hijack the policy process, at least on 'low-political' issues, and to secure the adoption of policies that are more than just the lowest common denominators of member states' preferences. This is alleged to explain in part why, in the areas of health and safety at work and environmental policy, more than merely incremental policy changes have been possible (Eichener 1996: 276).\n\nA seventh, related model or image of the EU political system is that of bureaucratic politics (Peters 1992). According to this model, EU politics is depoliticized, decentralised and sectorally fragmented. Beneath the level of the European Council, the dominant actors in the policy process are not elected politicians, but rather officials from national government departments and the Commission directorates-general (DGs): much of what happens depends on \"bureaucratic interaction and bargaining\" (Peters 1992: 121) In this conception, government departments or Commission DGs are \"quasi-autonomous actors with their own goals\" and policies the product of \"loosely organized and flexible policy communities\" (Peters 1992: 115, 117). These 'policy communities' cluster around the functionally differentiated councils of ministers, whose policies are not centrally coordinated to the same extent as national government policies, since there is no EU government or 'Cabinet'. 'Policy communities' are one kind of policy network, distinguished from other kinds of networks by the high level of their insulation, close and stable relations of mutual interdependence between their members, and stable membership (4). They make for stable public policies (Richardson 1996: 6).\n\nIn the period of relative stagnation of the institutional development of the EU from the mid-1960s to the late 1980s, intergovernmentalism became the dominant paradigm among scholars of the integration process. However, during the last decade, as, with the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, this process was 're-launched', intergovernmentalism has been increasingly contested as a model of EU governance. The multi-level governance model is, in effect, nothing other than a critique of intergovernmentalism, which is criticised for its failure to account not only for the new dynamic of the integration process, but also, in its more or less exclusive focus on treaty negotiations, for 'everyday' EU policy decisions that are more than the lowest common denominator among the preferences of (all or a subset of) the member states' governments.\n\n2. Approach\n\nMeanwhile, though, the reputation of the intergovernmentalist model may have become worse than is merited. The present contribution was conceived as a test of the plausibility of the intergovernmentalist model with regard to two series of conflicts over agricultural and agricultural trade policy in the EU, one covering the first half of the 1960s, when the CAP (Common Agricultural Policy) was created and the other the first half of the 1990s, when the hitherto most radical reform of the CAP was adopted and, in the GATT Uruguay Round, the EU was put under intense pressure by its trading partners to reduce its level of agricultural protection. However, not only do I find other models unconvincing when applied to EU agricultural politics, I also make a bolder argument than is normally encountered in intergovernmentalist interpretations of the EU, namely that the outcomes of the major agricultural (trade) policy conflicts in the EU in both the early 1960s and the early 1990s can be explained largely in terms of the preferences and interaction of the French and German governments.\n\nThe bilateral relationship between Bonn and Paris is, in its intensity, unique among the EU member states, if not in the wider world as well (de Schoutheete 1990: 109). The two governments expend considerable resources discussing and trying to coordinate their positions on EU issues - whether at formal bilateral meetings of government ministers and leaders, such as those foreseen by the Elysée Treaty, at the 'breakfast' meetings of the German Chancellor and the French President at European Council summits and other informal contacts of the heads of government of both states, in the COREPER (Committee of Permanent Representatives), where the French and German EU ambassadors cooperate closely, or through the day-to-day contacts of French and German civil servants in Bonn, Paris and Brussels (5). Media coverage of EU affairs often assumes, argues or implies that France and Germany and their bilateral relationship have a major - positive or negative - impact on the union. Collectively, the two states are often identified as the 'motor' or 'engine' of the integration process. Nonetheless, few political scientists have explored systematically the nature of the relationship and its impact on the EU. The relative neglect of this topic is difficult to explain in as far as, at least to the extent that the French and German governments do coordinate their positions on EU issues, their combined resources, in terms of the proportion of the votes that they wield in the EU Council of Ministers, the magnitude of their contribution to the EU budget, and the size of their economies, might be expected to enable them to exercise a very significant influence on EU decisions.\n\nThe former French president, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, summed up the role that, in his view, the Franco-German relationship played in the EU in the statement that \"where Germany and France are in agreement, Europe [i.e., the integration process] advances; where Germany and France are divided, Europe marks time\" (quoted in Schmidt 1990: 288). This observation does not encompass all possible scenarios, in as far as it does not admit the possibility of the two states agreeing to oppose a given initiative or integration project. In the following analysis, I test three propositions:\n\nThat when Germany and France have the same stance or have resolved their conflicts on any given issue, their position becomes the common position of the EU;\n\nThat when the two states oppose any major policy proposal, it is defeated; and\n\nThat when and as long as they are divided over such a proposal, the EU decision-making process is deadlocked.\n\nAgricultural and trade policy constitute ideal cases for testing these hypotheses because they belong to the policy areas where the national governments have forfeited the most decision-making competences to the EU and where, correspondingly, the neo-functionalist dynamic should be most easily observable (see Schmitter 1996: 125-26). Other things being equal, if the variant of the intergovernmentalist model proposed here provides a satisfactory explanation of the outcome of these conflicts, it should be no less useful for explaining outcomes in policy areas which are less strongly 'Europeanised' than agriculture and trade.\n\nTwo sets of conflicts, some thirty years apart, are investigated in this study. An analysis of conflicts that occurred in the EU's early history alone might yield misleading conclusions. In particular, they might be biased against the neo-functionalist model, as it is unlikely that the supranational institutions would have supplanted the national governments as prime objects of political loyalty and principal actors in the EU so soon after its foundation. However, if an analysis of the conflicts in the first half of the 1990s reveals that (a subset of) national governments are still the paramount actors in Brussels, this is hard to reconcile with neo-functionalist expectations, since one may reasonably expect the 'spill-over' process central to the neo-functionalist model to have made a substantial impact over a period of some three decades. Rather, by underlining the continuing centrality of national governments in the EU, despite the integration process having entered its fifth decade, such a conclusion vindicates the intergovernmentalist model. Comparing the outcomes of conflicts from two different stages of the EU's history also facilitates an assessment of the impact of the expansion of the EU's membership and changes in voting rules and customs that took place in the interim period.\n\nThis focus on substantive policy, as opposed to 'constitutional', conflicts in this analysis is designed to pre-empt a major criticism that is or may be made of the intergovernmentalist model, namely that its proponents are too exclusively pre-occupied with the analysis of the big intergovernmental conferences and treaty, or treaty revision, negotiations, such as those that led to the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, and that they therefore oversee the fact that 'everyday' Brussels politics follows a very different decision-making logic (see, for example, Garrett and Tsebelis 1996: 293). To the extent that this analysis confirms the intergovernmentalist model of EU governance, this indicates that the logic of intergovernmentalism is by no means confined to the big intergovernmental conferences where each member government has a legally-entrenched right of veto and the supranational institutions are not represented.\n\nIn one respect, however, the sample of conflicts is arguably biased in favour of the intergovernmentalist model. All of the issues analysed were more or less strongly contested; in some cases, member governments went as far as threatening to veto proposed EU decisions. To the extent that, by their having provoked intense political controversies, these issues are atypical among those that reach the EU agenda, the findings of this study cannot be generalised to the EU policy process as a whole. However, if the intergovernmental model is confirmed by the analysis of these politically relatively explosive conflicts in the EU's history, this is still an important finding, as it suggests that, whenever the political stakes are or are seen to be extremely high (and not only at the intergovernmental conferences where the big 'constitutional' issues are tackled), it is indeed the - or at least some - national governments rather than supranational organs that wield the greatest political power in Brussels.\n\nThe following section focuses on the 'landmark' decisions surrounding the creation of the CAP in the first half of the 1960s; the third looks at the decisions concerning CAP reform and agricultural trade liberalisation taken between 1990 and 1993. At the end of each section, I discuss why other models of EU governance do not account for the observed decisions as well as the 'Franco-German leadership' model. In the conclusion, I compare and discuss the findings from my analysis of the two series of conflicts, assess whether and to what extent the Franco-German relationship in EU agricultural politics might differ from that in other policy spheres and EU governance patterns in agricultural (trade) from those in other sectors, and make an attempt to explain why these two states have been able to exercise a determining influence on 'landmark' agricultural (trade) policy decisions in the EU.\n\nII. The creation of the CAP\n\nThe CAP was created by a series of decisions stretching from 1960 to 1965, of which the most important were those relating to the organisation of the common agricultural market(s) in 1961/62, a common cereal price in 1964, and the joint financing of CAP expenditure, which became enmeshed - disastrously - with the scheduled transition from unanimous to qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers, in 1965/66. In the conflicts over all these issues, France and Germany were pitted against each other; in all of them, the two states were or belonged to the most important protagonists. The first conflict appears to have been mediated bilaterally between the French and German council delegations; the second was mediated by the Commission arbitrating essentially between France and Germany; in the third, Franco-German differences were not reconciled and the young Community was plunged into a deep crisis (6).\n\n1. The conflict over the organisation of the common agricultural market 1961-62\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the multiplicity of interventionist agricultural policies in the member states, the idea of including agriculture in the Common Market was controversial from the outset. No other international organisation had hitherto been able to subordinate agriculture or agricultural trade to international disciplines and previous schemes for liberalising or expanding agricultural trade in Europe had come to nothing (Freisberg 1965: 15; Küsters 1982: 173; Milward 1992: 284-306). The conflicts between the six were not mediated until February 1957, shortly before the signing of the Rome Treaty. Even then, the agricultural policy articles of the treaty were kept general and vague - any attempt to formulate them more precisely could have endangered the success of the intergovernmental negotiations (Küsters 1982: 356) (7). In general, the member states with competitive agricultural sectors - notably France and Holland - supported a common agricultural market and policy, while those with weak agricultural sectors, first and foremost Germany, opposed them. There was, however, on the German side, a division of opinion between the Economics Ministry, which wanted to expose German farmers to more intense competition, and the Agricultural Ministry, which, like the DBV (Deutscher Bauernverband - German Farmers' Association), resisted the abandonment of national protectionism, at least after a change in the Agricultural Minister in 1959. Chancellor Adenauer, for his part, was exposed to diametrically opposed pressures. On the one hand, given the negative stance of the farmers' lobby, he feared that a 'Europeanisation' of agricultural policy could cost him critical electoral support (8). On the other, for geopolitical, foreign policy reasons, he attached enormous importance to maintaining good and close relations with France and to promoting the European integration process (Küsters 1982: 320-28). In the final phase of the Treaty of Rome negotiations, to which his talks with the then French Prime Minister, Mollet, gave a decisive impetus, Adenauer decreed that these objectives take precedence over differences on concrete policies (Küsters 1982: 322-23, 328).\n\nFor France, by contrast, a common agricultural policy became a sine qua non of its participation in the common market, the only means, so it was thought, of balancing the advantages that would accrue to Germany through free trade in manufactured goods (Couve de Murville 1971: 313-14; Marjolin 1986: 299-300). Without the promise of such a policy, the Rome Treaty, according to Couve de Murville, would never have been ratified by the French Parliament, where the Gaullist MPs in any case opposed the treaty because of the alleged 'weakness' of its agricultural provisions (Couve de Murville 1971: 313-14; Marjolin 1986: 318). De Gaulle himself, after his return to power, made it clear that he would keep France in the EU only if a common agricultural policy were realised: this was one of the messages that he gave to Adenauer at their meeting at Colombey-les-Deux-églises in 1958 (Maillard 1995: 153-54; also Peyrefitte 1994: 67) (9). Holland, with its very efficient and export-oriented agricultural sector, was equally insistent upon the integration of agriculture in the common market, although, given its strategy of building up an agricultural sector based on importing cheap animal foodstuffs, it preferred a more liberal agricultural regime than did France (Küsters 1982: 350-51; Tracy 1989: 251; Lindberg 1963: 224).\n\nIn the first major conflict that erupted over agricultural policy after the creation of the EEC, Holland and Germany were actually the principal protagonists, with France assuming a more minor role than was later to be the case (Freisberg 1965: 41-42; Hendriks 1991: 46-47). The issue at stake, which provoked the first 'marathon' council meeting, was whether the dismantlement of agricultural trade barriers between the six member states should be accelerated at the same pace as the reduction of industrial tariffs. Holland demanded synchrony in the reduction of trade barriers between industry and agriculture; only Germany opposed this demand. The \"violent controversy\" that erupted between Bonn and The Hague threatened to destroy the young Community, until, despite a Bonn Cabinet decision opposing such a development, the German government caved in and accepted the simultaneous reduction of agricultural trade barriers (Freisberg 1965: 41). According to one source, German opposition was weakened by disunity within the delegation between the Economics and Agricultural ministries - an early manifestation of what was to prove a recurrent phenomenon in Brussels agricultural negotiations (Freisberg 1965: 42).\n\nThe fundamental decisions over the organisation of the agricultural common market emerged from a series of no fewer than 45 council meetings staged between December 1961 and mid-January 1962 (10). The Commission's proposals, given its right of initiative under the Rome Treaty, formed the basis of the negotiations, but were evidently developed in close collaboration with the national governments and agricultural interest groups (Lindberg 1963: 237). The Commissioners themselves had been divided over the nature of a common agricultural policy, especially over precautions to be taken against possible over-production (von der Groeben 1983: 105-09). In the period from 1958 to 1962, in as far as the Commission did not adopt its proposals unanimously, there was reportedly a stable 'pro-CAP' majority consisting of the two French and two German commissioners as well as the Dutch Commissioner for Agriculture, Mansholt. According to one of the French Commissioners of the era, the German Commissioners supported moves towards a common agricultural policy because of Adenauer's resolve to do nothing to alienate Bonn from Paris (Marjolin 1986: 307-08). The Franco-German solidarity thus displayed in the Commission was not as evident, however, in the Council or in the SCA (Special Committee for Agriculture), the organ for the deliberation of agricultural policy issues between the Commission and the member states created in 1960, where negotiations proved \"extraordinarily difficult\" and the Commission had an especially tough job trying to reconcile the French and German demands (von der Groeben 1983: 146). The launching of the CAP became extricated with the transition to the second phase of the common market, which was to begin on 1 January 1962, provided all member states agreed. On this occasion, not only the Netherlands, but also France insisted that they would veto the beginning of the second phase unless agreement was reached on the creation of the common agricultural policy. For De Gaulle, the realisation of the CAP was indispensable to the solution of the 'peasant problem' in France, which, against the background of widespread rural unrest in France in the early 1960s, he regarded as a potential \"second Algerian question on our own soil\" (as quoted in Peyrefitte 1994: 302; see also Hendriks 1989: 77) (11). He attached especial importance to the common financing of such a policy, for otherwise, in his view, faced with increased competition from firms in other EU member states, French industry would be too heavily burdened with the cost of supporting French agriculture (Peyrefitte 1994: 302; Peyrefitte 1997: 266, 372-373; to Adenauer Akten 1964: 1257). De Gaulle told Adenauer in May 1961 that the EU would be imperilled if French demands for the integration of agriculture into the common market were not met. He repeated the message in early December 1961 and once again shortly before Christmas, as the talks over the launching of the CAP in Brussels were temporarily interrupted (Hendriks 1991: 48-49; Maillard 1995: 172-73)(12) .\n\nThe linking of the two projects by the Dutch and French governments placed the German government in a quandary. On the one hand, it remained fearful of the electoral-political repercussions of any concessions it might make on agricultural policy. For this reason, it was important for it to delay any decision on the launching of the CAP beyond the federal elections of September 1961. On the other hand, it supported industrial trade liberalisation, closer political integration and especially the enlargement of the Community to include Britain, while, at the height of the Cold War, it was also concerned to maintain good and close relations with France, whose stance on the Berlin crisis Adenauer appreciated more than the British or American. In as far as the German delegation had a joint negotiating strategy or objective, it was to play for time and to delay the introduction of a common agricultural policy for as long as possible (von der Groeben 1983: 147). As usual, there were, though, considerable conflicts of opinion between the Agricultural and Economics ministries. For the latter, a critical consideration was that an agreement over the launching of the second phase of the common market, according to its calculation, would have a positive impact on the British entry issue (Müller-Armack 1971: 232-33). The Agricultural Minister also supported British EU entry, but more ambivalently, fearing negative repercussions rfor German cereal prices (Akten 1963: 366-67). He and his ministry wanted to protect the system of import quotas through which Germany imported cheap agricultural produce from non-EU member states in product segments where there was no substantial domestic production and which constituted the heart of its own administrative powers (Freisberg 1965: 92, 95). They were also hostile to the harmonisation of cereal prices implied by the Commission's proposals and insisted that alleged 'distortions of competition' in agriculture between the member states be eradicated before the introduction of a common agricultural policy (Freisberg 1965: 79) (13).\n\nItaly, which was interested in opening up European markets for fruit, vegetables and wine, sided with France and Holland in the negotiations, although it was less favourable to trade liberalisation for other products and critical of some aspects of the Commission's proposals (von der Groeben 1983: 148; Lindberg 1963: 264, 267). According to von der Groeben, Belgium, partly because it wanted to keep the integration process going, also allied itself with France and Holland; according to another, both Belgium and Luxembourg aligned themselves with Germany, but were \"undependable allies\", on whose support the Germans, by implication, could not necessarily count (Freisberg 1965: 91) (14). The Germans' resistance to the creation of the CAP was, at any rate, the strongest. Their delegation was instructed to 'give up' as little as possible in the agricultural area and to gain as much as possible in economic and political terms (quoted in Hendriks 1991: 50). However, without firm allies and internally divided, and after the EU 'clock' had been stopped to permit continued negotiations at the New Year, the German side eventually acquiesced in the introduction of a common agricultural policy in mid-January 1962. The last obstacle to an agreement - relating to the financing of the policy - was overcome in bilateral negotiations between the heads of the German and French delegations (Lahr 1981: 354; Couve de Murville 1971: 317) (15). The only apparent - and, as was later to transpire, temporary - victory that the German delegation took from the negotiations was the rescinding of the Commission proposal to shorten the transitional period to a full agricultural common market by three years to 1967 (Freisberg 1965: 105). It sacrificed the quota system for imports from non-EU member states dear to the Agricultural Ministry: ultimately, Adenauer and the government attached greater importance to maintaining good relations with France (Die Zeit article quoted in Freisberg 1965: 95). By contrast, the French delegation was by and large successful in achieving its aims: not simply vis-a-vis Germany, but also vis-a-vis the Commission, whose competences - for example, in fixing common prices - were reduced to a minimum to the benefit of the Council and whose principal role seems to have consisted in mediating between the delegations (Freisberg 1965: 97, 100-02; Marjolin 1986: 320) (16). Commission members sceptical about the agreement - such as von der Groeben, who judged it to be much less 'market-oriented' than the Commission's original proposals - felt compelled to accept it so as not to endanger the transition to the second stage, which had to be approved unanimously by the Council, and thus not to jeopardise the integration process itself (von der Groeben 1983: 150-55). The Germans hoped - wrongly, as it turned out - that the German concessions on agriculture would be honoured by the French government's acquiescence in British entry to the EU (Müller-Armack 1971: 232) (17).\n\n2. The battle over the common cereals price 1964\n\nThe implementation of the CAP required the setting of common prices for agricultural products, of which the most important, in political as well as economic terms, given the strong influence exercised by cereals farmers in the farmers' organisations, was cereals. Between the milestone decisions on the CAP of January 1962 and December 1964, when a common cereal price was adopted, the EU and the Franco-German relationship endured a number of crises, most notably that unleashed by De Gaulle's rejection of the British entry application in January 1963. Despite the latter, De Gaulle and Adenauer agreed the Elysee Treaty foreseeing close Franco-German cooperation, including on EU issues, the same month. However, a preamble added to the treaty by the German Bundestag substantially devalued its significance, disillusioning De Gaulle, and Adenauer, who had sponsored the treaty against considerable domestic opposition, stood down as Chancellor later the same year, to be replaced by the 'Atlanticist' Erhard (18). A German Foreign Office memo prepared for Erhard on his accession to the Chancellorship contained a lengthy list of issues where the French and German governments were in conflict with each other, ranging from the NATO, relations with the US, nuclear weapons strategy and the 'constitution' of the EU to numerous EU policy issues, including agricultural ones (Akten 1963: 1113). Both Erhard and the Foreign Office viewed De Gaulle as striving to construct a 'small' EU under French domination (see Akten 1963: 942 and Akten 1964: 135). For his part, De Gaulle, less than a month after the approval of the Elysee Treaty, complained that, on EU issues, the French and German governments almost always had opposing positions (Akten 1963: 615).\n\nAfter De Gaulle's veto of British EU entry, the German Agricultural Minister, Schwarz, strongly opposed Germany making any further unilateral concessions to France at the expense of German farmers (Akten 1963: 365-68). For the same reason, the German Foreign Minister, Schröder, pursued a strategy of 'synchronisation' in Germany's relations with France in the EU, whereby Germany would make concessions only in return for simultaneous French ones. In practice, Bonn insisted that it would bend to French pressure for further progress on the CAP only if France were to cooperate in launching the Kennedy Round of GATT trade liberalisation negotiations. Between these sets of two issues, there was, he argued, an non-negotiable interdependence (Akten 1963: 1637). The CAP and the Kennedy Round were linked in the EU's 'work programme' in May 1963. However, this did not prevent a fresh crisis breaking out between the two governments as the French accused the German agricultural minister of reneging on a pledge allegedly made by Erhard not to oppose the adoption of a common milk price before the end of 1963 (Akten 1963: 1611-14). Again, the battle in the EU was fought primarily between France and Germany and again Paris insisted that a failure of the CAP negotiations would have the \"most serious consequences \" and affect the \"whole future of European integration\" (Couve de Murville Akten 1963: 1628-29). Finally, the two sides reached a compromise on the lines foreseen in May - whereby, however, the German conceded the adoption of concrete CAP regulations in exchange for French agreement to a negotiating mandate for EU participation in the Kennedy Round, which was not to begin until some time in 1964.\n\nCereals, however, constituted a much tougher political proposition - and, in Germany, as Erhard told De Gaulle, an especially \"neuralgic point\" (Akten 1963: 1459). Cereal prices in the member states diverged widely: for soft wheat, the Italian price was the highest, the German and Luxembourg prices were only slightly lower, and the French price was lowest of all, slightly lower than the Dutch. The Belgian price fell roughly halfway between the German and French prices. It was at this level - \"in the middle, between the French and the Germans\" (Mansholt 1974: 110) , at DM 425 per ton - that, in November 1963, the Agricultural Commissioner proposed to set the common price.\n\nInitially in favour of a rapid decision on cereal prices (Akten 1963: 1458), and despite the council's resolution in December 1963 to adopt a common cereals price by April 1964, Erhard quickly changed his mind and pledged to resist any such decision, at least during 1964 and 1965, when, in September, federal elections were due to be staged in Germany (19). The German Bundestag approved this stance in March 1964. In January 1962, the Council had decided, at the same time as it adopted the decisions laying the foundations of the CAP, that a common cereals price could be adopted only unanimously before the end of the second stage of the common market in December 1965, but thereafter by a qualified majority vote. Although the German government could expect to secure a price closer to German preferences while its support was required for a common price to be adopted, the option of postponing the adoption of a common price until Germany's opposition was irrelevant may have been politically more attractive, since the government could then have told German farmers and their organisations that it had done its best for them, but had been outvoted. This was the strategy that Adenauer at least was accused of having followed so long as he was Chancellor (Freisberg 1965: 139).\n\nUnder other circumstances, this option could also have been appealing for the member states with lower cereals prices than the German, including France, as a price adopted by a qualified majority was likely to be lower than one which required German consent. Already in autumn 1963, De Gaulle, however, pushed Erhard to acquiesce in a common cereal price as quickly as possible; otherwise, he told the German Chancellor, there would be no Franco-German agreement over the Kennedy Round and the EU itself would be jeopardised (Akten 1963: 1459). De Gaulle's tactics may have been motivated by his wish, later manifested in the 'empty-chair crisis', to thwart the scheduled transition to qualified majority voting. The Foreign Minister, Couve de Murville's, statement that, on an issue like the common cereals price, a big member state such as Germany could not be outvoted, points in the same direction (Freisberg 1965: 163-64). After the German Agricultural Minister had blocked a cereal price decision in April, the Agricultural Council decided in June that a decision must be taken by December. After, in May 1964, De Gaulle had told the permanent secretary in the German Foreign Office that \"France is not in a hurry\" over the cereal prices issue, Bonn was encouraged to believe that it might be possible to postpone a decision beyond the 1965 German elections after all (Akten 1964: 1161-62). By October, however, the French president had changed his mind again. If the CAP was not implemented according to the agreed schedule, he had his press spokesman declare, France would cease to take part in the EU (Akten 1964: 1187). This prospect was so terrifying, according to one observer, that it caused consternation among the other member states (Freisberg 1965: 164; von der Groeben 1983: 235). The threat seems in retrospect not to have been a mere bluff, although the German Foreign Office considered it more likely that the French government would prevent any progress in the Kennedy Round negotiations than withdraw from the EU altogether (Akten 1964: 1188-89) (20).\n\nThe French tactic of 'upping the stakes' in the cereal price conflict raised the pressure on the German government and heightened the dilemma Erhard faced. On the one hand, it was clear that, if Germany did not acquiesce in a common cereal price, France would block a successful conclusion of the Kennedy Round as well as German proposals for closer European political integration, if not destroy the EU altogether as well (Freisberg 1965: 164-66). The dangers posed by this scenario to the Franco-German relationship motivated the 'Gaullists' in the CDU/CSU, led by Adenauer, to put pressure on Erhard to cede on the issue. On the other hand, to cave in to French pressure risked incurring dangerous domestic political consequences: the alienation of the DBV, a revolt by the farmers in the CDU/CSU Parliamentary party, a decline in farmers' support for the CDU/CSU at the upcoming federal coalitions and a crisis in the governing coalition. In October 1964, at the same time as De Gaulle threatened to take France out of the common market if there was no agreement on a common cereal price, Erhard's coalition partner, the liberal FDP, threatened to withdraw from the coalition if the government were to give in to French pressure (Freisberg 1965: 171). Moreover, there was no prospect that another member state would rescue the German government from its dilemma by taking over its role as principal opponent of a common cereals price. Italy had just as strong an interest in resisting the Commission's proposal, but it began to signal its preparedness to agree to a compromise on the issue in November 1964, threatening to leave the German government completely isolated among the six (Freisberg 1965: 133-34, 153; Akten 1964: 1361).\n\nAs in the conflict over the foundations of the CAP, France, supported again by Holland, was the principal force for agricultural policy integration among the six and Germany the principal opponent. As in 1961/62, the German government found itself exposed to pretty well diametrically opposed foreign and domestic pressures. As in 1961/62 also, it found itself divided, with the Agricultural Ministry defending the interests of its domestic clientele, as defined by the DBV, and the Foreign Office pushing for a German 'climb-down', in exchange of which it hoped to be able to secure concessions for Germany on other issues, including the Kennedy Round (Akten 1964: 1359-61). Again as in 1961/62, the Chancellor, forced to mediate between conflicting intra-governmental positions and concerned to promote a successful conclusion to the Kennedy Round, prioritised foreign policy over domestic political considerations (Osterfeld 1992: 122). Erhard sided with the Foreign Office (Akten 1964: 1199-1200; 1394-96), bypassed his own Agricultural Minister and began to negotiate with the chairman of the German Farmers' Association over the possible terms of German acquiescence in a common cereals price. The farmers' leader, in the light of the government's repeated pledges to prevent a cut in German cereals prices, demanded a high price for his association's acquiescence in a government climb-down: roughly DM 1 billion of additional national agricultural subsidies, almost all of which Erhard ultimately granted. Shortly before the decisive Council meeting, the German government too signalled that it would no longer oppose the adoption of a common price. However, it did not want to accept any per tonne soft wheat price lower than DM 440.\n\nThe council negotiations turned into a confrontation primarily between the German and French ministers and were characterised by the most extreme tensions that the Agricultural Commissioner had ever witnessed at an international conference (Mansholt 1974: 110, 114). With the talks at an impasse, the council asked the Commission to formulate and propose a 'package deal', which Mansholt and his advisers drew up in a Brussels restaurant with the aim of offering something attractive to each of the delegations, not least to the French and German (21). Mansholt put forward the package, which contained the same cereal price that the commission had proposed originally, on a 'take-it-or-leave-it' basis; the council accepted it. The leader of the German delegation who accepted the deal was the Economics Minister - at the time the package was accepted, the German Agricultural Minister was back in Bonn. Aided by his farmer supporters in the CDU/CSU Parliamentary party, the Agricultural Minister tried to persuade Erhard to reverse the German acceptance of the package, but to no avail. Before acquiescing in the deal, the Economics Minister Schmücker had consulted the Chancellor and obtained his approval. Both the Agricultural Minister and the DBV had been temporarily shut out of the German decision-making process - Schmücker had been instructed that, if necessary, Erhard's agreement with the farmers' association had to be sacrificed in favour of \"European solidarity\" (Hendriks 1991: 53; Freisberg 1965: 181-83). For the Italian, Luxembourg and German cereal farmers (who also obtained national subsidies) the losses implied by the common price were 'sweetened' by the provision of temporary EU subsidies (22). Otherwise, however, the only concessions that the German delegation obtained were slight increases in the common prices for rye and hops compared with the Commission's proposal and a one-year delay in the implementation of the common cereals prices - to 1967 (Tracy 1989: 262; Freisberg 1965: 183). Schmücker declared in the decisive council meeting that the German government expected in exchange for its acquiescence in a common cereal price concessions from the other member states in the \"expansion of economic and political cooperation\" (Akten 1964: 1396). Concretely, this probably meant that it sought French and other member states' support for the initiative for closer political cooperation between the Six that Erhard had launched in November 1964 (Osterfeld 1992: 123).\n\n3. The financing of the CAP & the 'empty-chair' crisis 1965-66\n\nThe crises over the CAP in the years 1961/62 and 1964 were resolved in the first case through bilateral Franco-German mediation and in the second through the intervention of the Commission as an 'honest broker' between conflicting, primarily French and German preferences. Confronted in the first case with a joint Franco-Dutch, and in the second case with a French, ultimatum, and after fighting long rearguard actions, the German government chose on both occasions to make major agricultural policy concessions in favour of overarching foreign policy objectives, such as the maintenance of a close Franco-German relationship. The crisis that blew up in connection with the financing of the CAP in 1965 differed from the previous two in as far as Franco-German differences were not mediated, the French government chose to confront the other member states over the EU's future constitution, and the dispute plunged the EU into a deep crisis, the like of which did not recur - rather as a farce - until the very short-lived British 'boycott' of the EU over the 'mad cow disease' in 1996.\n\nAccording to the January 1962 council decision, a new formula for the financing of the CAP, which was initially funded by variable contributions from the national exchequers, was to be agreed by the end of June 1965 (23). At the cereal price meeting in December 1964, the council asked the Commission to make proposals for a new formula by April 1965. The Commission's proposals were worked out by a small group of officials working with Mansholt (Newhouse 1972: 254). In retrospect, it seems that the Commission was emboldened by the success of its mediation efforts in the cereals price negotiations (Le Monde 1993: 56-57). The proposals, by giving the EU direct control over revenues from import duties and thus increasing its financial autonomy vis-a-vis the member states and by expanding the budgetary powers of the EP (European Parliament), would have substantially strengthened the EU's supranational character and so were bound to antagonise the French government. The Commission had been divided over whether to play the role of a 'mediator' and make modest proposals or to play the role of 'motor' of the integration process that the member states, including, at least in agricultural policy, France, had so far accepted (von der Groeben 1983: 269; Marjolin 1986: 343). Given the nature of the proposals and as De Gaulle himself recognised, the majority of the Commission clearly calculated that the French government would be prepared to sanction a widening of the EU's powers in exchange for a CAP financing regulation that would be in France's financial interests and that, in this way, Gaullist resistance to a stronger EU could be circumvented (Newhouse 1972: 254; Freisberg 1965: 199; Peyrefitte 1997: 296-297; Willis 1968: 343) (24).\n\nThe French government was all the more hostile to the proposals because of the Commission's failure to consult the member states about them and the fact that they had been presented to the EP before the Council. It immediately rejected them (see Peyrefitte 1997: 281-285). Opinion among the other member states was more nuanced. In contrast to the French government, the German liked the 'integrationist' components of the package, but disliked the proposals concerning the financing of the CAP, to which it would be a net financial contributor. Following Foreign Minister Schröder's 'synchronisation' strategy, the German government was again reluctant to make anything more than short-term concessions to France over the CAP before France had made concessions to it over the Kennedy Round. which was still in progress (Freisberg 1965: 120; Groeben 1983: 272; Newhouse 1972: 255). De Gaulle had also angered Bonn by rejecting its proposal for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the Six to consider its plan for closer political integration - contrary to a pledge that Erhard believed De Gaulle had made following Germany's acceptance of a common cereal price (Osterfeld 1992: 184-185). For the German government, Schmücker told the Council of Ministers in May 1965 that it would the CAP financing proposal only in exchange for progress in \"other areas of the Common Market\" (Akten 1965: 1104).\n\nOf the other member states, Belgian and Luxembourg supported France so as not to endanger the integration process, while, without being as hostile to the proposals as the French government, both Italy and Holland wanted to make some changes in them - not all of them the same ones that France wanted (von der Groeben 1983: 273). Italy, as the country which had done most poorly out of the already existing CAP financing arrangements, was actually to become France's strongest opponent in the ensuing council negotiations (Newhouse 1972: 255-56; Peyrefitte 1997: 289).\n\nThe Franco-German relationship continued to be beset by the same issues and conflicts that it plagued it, at the latest, since the British entry application crisis in January 1963. At the regular Franco-German summit meeting a few weeks before the decisive council meeting, the two governments failed to reconcile their differences over the Commission's proposals (see Akten 1965: 1039-1044). Essentially, the French side insisted that the financing regulation be adopted by the end of June, as agreed in January 1962, and the Germans that this deadline be extended, because the issues on which they sought concessions from France were too complex to be resolved in the time left. If the French government wanted an agreement on the CAP budget within the month, this could not be for the five-year period it demanded (25). The consultations between the governments were complicated by poor coordination between the Bonn ministries and evident differences between Erhard and Schröder, as to the right strategy to pursue vis-à-vis Paris (Manfraß 1972: 329; Peyrefitte 1997: 260-61; Osterfeld 1992: 206-207) (26). A serious clash in Brussels appeared, however, to have been averted, when, just prior to the scheduled council meeting, fresh talks between leading foreign ministry officials of the two governments produced a bilateral agreement. A German memorandum suggested that they had agreed to limit the expansion of the European Parliament's powers proposed by the Commission, and at least to postpone the direct transfer of revenues from import duties to Brussels. The German Foreign Office understood that Paris would not insist on a definitive resolution of the CAP budget at the forthcoming council and that, in continuing negotiations, it might acquiesce in an initial one-year agreement on the issue (Newhouse 1972: 263; Akten 1965: 1102). Hence it did not anticipate that the meeting would lead to a Franco-German confrontation.\n\nAs is well known, the council meeting instead ended in an éclat and was followed by a six-month-long French boycott of the EU institutions. The offical French version of the meeting blamed the German delegation for the meeting's collapse. According to this account, the Germans reneged on the pre-summit bargain reached by the two foreign ministries, first by rejecting a French proposal to detach the agricultural policy components of the Commission's package from the institutional-political components and to deal with the former first and then, following a corresponding Bundestag resolution, by supporting an extension of the powers of the European Parliament. Informally, French officials blamed the crisis on - roughly in this order - the Commission, which eschewed a mediating role and refused to modify its original proposals, and the Italians and Dutch, who insisted on treating the proposals as an indivisible whole (Newhouse 1972: 266-67; Willis 1968: 344) (27). Worried that they were likely to become an ever bigger contributor to the CAP budget, the Italians were prepared to accept only a very temporary agreement on the policy's financing (Vaïsse 1997: 586). The precipitate declaration of the meeting's failure by Couve de Murville, president of the council at the time, astonished the other delegations, which had reckoned with a continuation of the negotiations. According to Mansholt, an agreement would have been possible if the French government had wanted one (quoted in Freisberg 1965: 204). The German delegation argued that progress had been made in the talks and that, if the 'clock' had been stopped as in 1961-62, an agreement could have been reached in 10 to 14 days (Akten 1965: 1109). Bonn surmised that \"new instructions from the élysée\" (i.e. De Gaulle) had prompted Couve de Murville to disregard the pre-council Franco-German bargain and declare the meeting to have failed (Akten 1965: 1114). In retrospect, it indeed seems very probable that the alleged German 'betrayal' of France in the meeting was used as a pretext to justify the French government's action and that, as Mansholt and others supposed, the aim of the French boycott was rather to curtail the powers of the Commission and thus to stifle a strengthening of the supranational character of the EU (quoted in Freisberg 1965: 204; see also von der Groeben 1983: 277; Manfraß 1972: 329; Newhouse 1972: 270; Lahr 1981: 428-29; Akten 1965: 1114, 1271). This was certainly the ghist of De Gaulle's later - both private and public - remarks on the boycott (Peyrefitte 1997: 296; Tracy 1989: 263) (28). The 'empty-chair' crisis boiled down essentially to a battle between France, on the one hand, and the other five member states and the Commission, on the other, over the EU's future constitution rather than over the financing of the CAP, which became a subordinate issue. Among the five, Belgium and Luxembourg adopted a more conciliatory stance towards French demands, Italy played a mediatory role within the group and Holland and Germany, where, after the September 1965 elections, Erhard and Schröder were still in their respective offices, took tougher positions (Newhouse 1972: 274). The German government calculated that, for economic reasons, France could not afford to leave or destroy the EU and decided in favour of taking a \"relaxed\" attitude towards the boycott, sticking to its bargaining position hitherto and opposing especially resolutely any French demands to change the Rome Treaty (Akten 1965: 1113-17 and Document No. 314; Vaïsse 1997: 578) (29). Any sign of weakness towards De Gaulle, argued the German ambassador in Paris, would be likely to raise the cost of the concessions that the five would have to pay to secure France's return (Akten 1965: Document No. 280). In the negotiations that finally resolved the crisis in January 1966, Schröder was the principal player on the side of the five. The so-called(30) 'Luxembourg Compromise', which ended the French boycott, documented the disagreement over what to do in the event of major conflicts in the EU rather than resolving it: neither side made any irrevocable concessions to the other. On the financing of the CAP, the agreement reached corresponded fairly closely to the French government's aspirations (Marjolin 1986: 352; Newhouse 1972: 276). There were no changes in the treaty of the kind that De Gaulle wanted to secure at the outset of the conflict. However, in practice, to the extent that unanimous voting on fundamental issues remained the norm in the EU during the following two decades, the French government also won the struggle over the constitution of the EU (31).\n\n4. Discussion\n\nThe creation of the CAP in the first half of the 1960s was a politically highly charged process, in which each new policy step unleashed a crisis and France and Germany repeatedly found themselves in opposing camps. In the first two cases portrayed here, the conflicts between France and Germany were mediated and landmark decisions adopted; in the third, the crisis remained unmediated, plunging the young community into a crisis which was defused only by an 'agreement to disagree' after a six-month stand-off between France and the other member states as well as the EU institutions.\n\nWhat is most striking about the cases is the extent of the divergence of the initial French and German positions and, more so, the extent to which the conflicts were dominated by their antagonism. In the first two conflicts, the two countries (whereby France was supported strongly by Holland) represented the two poles, the most extreme positions on the political spectrum, among the member states; in the third, the cleavage ran rather between France, on the one side, and all the other member states, including Germany, on the other. In the first two cases, once the conflict between France and Germany was settled, so, too, practically, was the conflict within the Community as a whole. When, as in the third case, France and Germany could not reach a modus vivendi, a resolution of the conflict between the Six was not possible either. Thus, the big battles over the creation of the CAP in the first half of the 1960s seem to confirm the hypotheses that when Franco-German divisions on a major agricultural policy issue have not been overcome, the EU is deadlocked and that when they have been settled, the Franco-German position is taken over by the EU as a whole. As there was no case of both states opposing an important agricultural policy proposal, the hypothesis that, in these circumstances, the proposal will fail altogether can be neither confirmed nor refuted.\n\nHow plausibly can, by contrast, other models of EU governance account for the pattern of outcomes of the crises concerning the creation of the CAP? The neo-functionalist model emphasizes the centrality of supranational institutions. Of these, however, only the Commission itself played a significant role in these conflicts. As the neo-functionalist theorist, Lindberg, himself points out, the EP (European Parliament) and the ESC (Economic and Social Committee) were marginal to the process by which the founding CAP decisions were taken in 1961/62 (Lindberg 1963: 252-260). Equally, the COPA (Comité des Organisations Professionelles Agricoles), the umbrella association of the national farmers' organisations, whose foundation the Commission had encouraged, had no observable impact on the decisions. Nothing suggests that these organs played a more important role in the battles over the common cereal price and the financing of the CAP later on. The neo-functionalist case rests wholly on the role in these events played by the Commission. However, although, in the case of the 1961/62 decisions, Lindberg highlights how closely the final package corresponded to the Commission's original proposals, it seems clear, reading between the lines of his analysis, that the proposals were tailored with a view to their political feasibility. The Commission did secure the adoption of its proposal concerning the common cereals price, but the fact that this was set halfway between the existing French and German prices suggests that, here too, considerations of political feasibility influenced the Commission's stance more strongly than any 'autonomous' Commission ideas as to the 'best' common price (32). In the 1965-66 conflict with France, the Commission, with its bold proposals, seems to have suffered a comprehensive defeat that braked the integration process for the following two decades. All this is not to say that the Commission was not a critical actor in these conflicts, least of all in the 1964 one, but its role was that of a mediator, arbitrator and broker rather than an autonomous supranational agency and when it became too ambitious, as in 1965, it was cut down to size.\n\nThe transnational exchange model does not aspire to explain what \"specific rules and policies\" are adopted in the EU, although the proponents of the model subscribe to the intergovernmentalist view that the larger member states, because they command \"greater resources\", tend to exercise greater influence on policy outcomes than the small (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 310, 314). In general, the model predicts that political integration will take place fastest in sectors which exhibit the highest levels of cross-border transactions (trade). That is why the EU has moved further towards supranational governance in issue-areas relating to the internal market than, for example, in foreign and security policy (Stone Sweet and Sandholtz 1997: 308-309). However, given that agriculture was a sector where there had been very high trade barriers and relatively limited inter-state trade in Europe before the 1960s, the model can not easily explain why political integration should have started earlier and proceeded faster in this sector than in others. Although Stone Sweet and Sandholtz (1997: 311) qualify their overall argument to the extent that they expect integration to \"occur most readily in policy domains included in the Treaty\", a claim with which the rapid integration of agricultural policy can be squared, this begs the questions of why provision was made in the treaty for a common policy for agriculture, but not for many other sectors, and why a common policy was realised a great deal more quickly in agriculture than in other sectors for which the treaty foresaw common policies (33). Of course, it might be argued that the CAP was engineered by two member states - Holland and France - that wanted to be able to sell their surplus agricultural production on other West European markets and that, at least indirectly, the CAP was the product of pressures exerted by 'transnational society' (in this case, export-oriented farmers in the two countries). But the member states whose agricultural sectors were less competitive were equally hostile to agricultural trade liberalisation, so that what has to be explained in the conflict over the foundation of the CAP, and what the transnational exchange model can not account for, is why the former group of member states got the better of the latter.\n\nThe multi-level governance model likewise fails to deliver a plausible retrospective interpretation of the political struggle over the foundation of the CAP. Although the Commission played an important agenda-setting role, given its exclusive right of policy initiation according to the Treaty of Rome, the competence to make decisions lay fairly and squarely in the council, that is to say, it was shared between the national governments and not between national and supranational actors. There is no powerful evidence of the Commission - and much less of other supranational organs - having exercised an independent influence on council decisions. The available literature does not enable a judgement to be made over the extent, if any, to which national interest groups bypassed their own governments in trying to influence the outcome of the conflicts. Lindberg reports that the Commission actively tried to integrate agricultural interests into the process of developing the original CAP. However, it is apparent that the Commission encouraged the formation of a European-level farmers' organisation (COPA), presumably to have a single interlocuteur for agricultural policy issues and to avoid the need itself to have to aggregate the interests of the different national farmers' organisations (Lindberg 1963: 237-238). The national farmers'organisation most hostile to the CAP, the German, clearly - and rationally, given the unanimity decision-making rule in the council - concentrated its efforts to prevent or shape the CAP on its own national government: it was not with Hallstein or with Mansholt, but with Erhard that the DBV chairman negotiated over the common cereal price. Finally, at this early stage of the integration process, national sovereignty had not been eroded to the degree where threats by national governments - or at least France - to withdraw from the organisation were no longer credible. De Gaulle's threats to leave the EU unless the CAP was adopted were both meant and taken seriously.\n\nAn epistemic communities-based explanation of the foundation of CAP would have to identify a network of professional experts and show that it had dominated the decision-making process. In the case of agricultural policy, this could only be the profession of agricultural economists. However, the agricultural economists have always been sidelined in the EU agricultural policy-making process. Far from having been the policy's architects, they have typically been critics of the CAP and its 'economic irrationality'. To this extent, there are no similarities between this policy area and others in which scientific experts have been observed to exercise a strong influence on EU policy choices. The bureaucratic politics/policy community model also appears inappropriate. It would hardly be plausible to argue that, in the first half of the 1960s, a tight, closed network of national agricultural ministry and Commission DG VI officials dominated CAP decision-making. The conflicts surrounding the foundation of the CAP were not resolved at the level of the civil service; they could be settled only by politically responsible ministers. And, although an arguably important first step towards the formation of a 'closed' agricultural policy community had been taken with the creation in 1960 of the SCA to prepare the Agricultural Council meetings (in place of the COREPER), the Agricultural Ministers were far from being a law unto themselves at the time that the landmark CAP decisions were reached. The decisive negotiations took place in 'Jumbo' council meetings attended not only by agricultural, but also by other (typically economics and foreign) ministers. It is by no means clear that, in France, with its relatively tight process of inter-ministerial coordination, the Agricultural Minister Pisani always had the last word on agricultural issues when there were inter-ministerial conflicts: in the 1965-66 crisis, for example, he seems to have been surprised by and unhappy with the French negotiating tactics and decision to withdraw from the EU organs (see above and Newhouse 1972: 269). The looser inter-ministerial coordination process in Germany enabled Pisani's German counterpart to operate more autonomously of other ministers and the Chancellor (Peyrefitte 1997: 248). But the German agricultural minister also seems to have been sidelined in the 1965 crisis, in which the dominant Bonn actor was rather the foreign minister Schröder. In the cereals price conflict, he was bypassed in critical phases - by Erhard negotiating directly with the DBV president and the Economics Minister accepting the cereal price agreement with Erhard's backing while he was absent from the negotiations. Altogether, one has the strong impression that French and German behaviour in these three 'high-political' conflicts was strongly shaped by overriding foreign (as well as agricultural) policy priorities determined more by the foreign ministers, the German Chancellor and the French president than by the agricultural ministers themselves.\n\nThe primacy of the national governments in the disputes over the foundation of the CAP observed here is compatible with an interpretation based on the institutionalist model. However, whilst the subsequent evolution of the CAP is explicable in terms of this model, in as far as the policy, once launched, could be reformed only with the support of all member governments (see Scharpf 1988), the institutionalist approach can not easily account for the fact that the CAP was launched at all (34). Given the unanimity voting requirement, the German government could have vetoed the start of the policy - why did it not do so? One hypothetical explanation is that, because of its strong initial opposition to the proposals in the first two conflicts and because it could not be outvoted and was therefore in the strongest bargaining position, it was able to mould the policy in its interests and thus had no reason ultimately not to accept it (35). This interpretation is difficult to square with the facts that the common cereal price was set not at the German level, but halfway between the German and French levels and that, quite clearly, important German actors, notably the DBV and the Agricultural Ministry, would have preferred to have no common agricultural policy at all. The CAP, in its original guise, corresponded much more closely to French than to German (agricultural) interests.\n\nIt might be possible to reconcile an institutionalist interpretation with what happened by arguing that there was a cross-issue trade-off between France and Germany whereby France obtained the CAP in exchange for conceding industrial trade liberalisation to Germany and that issue-linkage thus circumvented a German veto of the CAP (36). To the extent that the 1961-62 CAP decisions fell at the same time as that to make the transition to the second stage of the common (industrial) market and both France and Holland insisted that they would veto the latter unless the CAP was launched, there was indeed such a trade-off, although the available literature does not show whether fear of the collapse of the common industrial market was in fact the main motive for the German government's ultimate acquiescence in the CAP's launching. The simultaneous agreement of common milk, meat and rice prices and a negotiating mandate for the Commission for the Kennedy Round at the end of 1963 may seem to have been a Franco-German trade-off. However, Erhard's acquiescence in these common prices appears rather to have been a response to the pressure exerted on him by the Francophile current in the CDU/CSU led by the former Chancellor Adenauer (Schwarz 1994: 886) (37). In any case, in as far as there was such a trade-off on this issue, it reflected the normal pattern in Franco-German relations - which was for Germany to make concessions to France in the present in the subsequently disappointed hope or expectation that France would make concessions to it on other issues later. Thus, Germany received no simultaneous concession from France when it agreed to the common cereal price. Rather, it conceded the common price in exchange for the other member states - it meant, of course, France - agreeing to closer \"economic and political cooperation\" (see above) in the future. In other words, Foreign Minister Schröder's 'synchronisation' strategy repeatedly failed (38). The main reason for this failure must be seen in the divisions in the German government over the relative priority of maintaining good relations with France and the Chancellor's propensity, in case of conflict, to arbitrate in favour of France on EU issues (see below).\n\nA second possible objection to the institutionalist model is that it makes no distinction per se between the member states in terms of their veto power and capacity to shape EU decisions (39). Could Luxembourg, for example, really have resisted the launching of the CAP as Germany did - or persuaded or coerced Germany into acquiescing in it as France did? Hardly. In fact, like Germany, Luxembourg and Italy were opposed to the Commission's cereals price proposal, but they gave up their resistance to it much earlier than the Germans. At the same time, it is questionable (although not certain) whether any state other than France could have cajoled Germany into finally accepting the CAP and the common cereals price (40). Of the other member states, France was the one that could most credibly threaten to withdraw if the CAP was not launched (i.e., the one that could most credibly claim to survive without it) and the one to which Germany attached the greatest importance to maintaining a close bilateral relationship (i.e., the one which, as an opponent, could most damage German interests). Although the three conflicts portrayed here were not exclusively Franco-German battles, the first two were conducted primarily between these two states, although important interests of the others were also at stake, while the 1965-66 crisis divided France from all the other member states, including Germany.\n\nIn contrast to the institutionalist model, intergovernmentalism, at least in Moravcsik's incarnation, does distinguish between the 'big', more powerful member states (France, Germany, and, since 1973, the UK) and the 'small', less powerful remaining ones. Critical EU decisions, however, represent the lowest common denominator of the preferences of the big three (in the first half of the 1960s, the big two), unless two of the three can credibly threaten the third that they would, if necessary, pursue a given integration project without it (and the third state fears that its exclusion would negatively affect its interests). The CAP decisions in the early 1960s amounted, however, to more than the 'lowest common denominator' of French and German preferences, between which there was hardly any common ground: the French side got a great deal more of what it wanted than did the German. This outcome can not be attributed to France's having brandished a credible threat of 'excluding' Germany from the CAP, since German participation was indispensable to the project - Germany was the biggest prospective foreign market for French agricultural produce and the biggest prospective contributor to the budget of the CAP, the purpose of which, for De Gaulle, was to socialise the cost of supporting French agriculture across the member states. It was not by threatening Germany with 'exclusion' that the French government was able to secure such a favourable outcome of the CAP conflicts, but rather by threatening itself to 'exit' from the EU if the CAP was not launched. Thus, the outcomes of the CAP conflicts are entirely compatible with Moravcsik's intergovernmentalist model if this is amended to include the possibility of more radical than'lowest-common-denominator' solutions being achieved by the threat of 'exit' rather than 'exclusion'.\n\nThe question that remains to be answered is why, in the first two conflicts portrayed here at least, the German leaders of the day submitted to the French exit threats and made major, more or less unilateral concessions to Paris that were strongly contested by an important domestic constituency of the CDU/CSU, namely German farmers. Why, in other words, was it ultimately more concerned than the French to avert a crisis, in the worst-case scenario the collapse of the EU? On account of its size, its legitimacy as a World War II Allied power, and its membership of the UN Security Council, France was the strongest political and military power of continental Western Europe. For De Gaulle, the EU was useful in as far as it could be used as a lever for maximising French influence on European and world affairs and a vehicle for making Europe more independent of the United States. But it was not indispensable, least of all if it could not be put in the service of these goals and encroached on French sovereignty. For West German leaders, the EU was intrinsically extremely valuable. Through its integration in the EU, the Federal Republic, following World War II, could aspire to achieve its \"international comeback\" and greater national sovereignty (Schwarz 1992: 43, 40). The closer economic and political integration of Western Europe facilitated by the EU helped to bolster West German security in the Cold War, which, in the early 1960s, was at its height. Moreover, the EU provided an appropriate multilateral framework for the consolidation of the Federal Republic's relations with France - partly because a close Franco-German relationship was and would be more acceptable to the smaller West European states when it was multilaterally embedded than otherwise (41).\n\nFor Adenauer, forging and maintaining a close relationship with France was, like promoting European integration, an extremely important foreign policy goal in itself. In EU affairs, according to a French Commissioner of the era, he was resolved to \"do nothing that could estrange him from Paris\" (Marjolin 1986: 307) (42). He was prepared to play junior partner to De Gaulle: because of the Third Reich, Germany could not play a leading foreign policy role in the foreseeable future, he told the French ambassador in Bonn. France had therefore to take over this role and Germany could bring its power to bear and foreign policy ideas to fruition only indirectly via France (Akten 1963: 622; also Schwarz 1994: 747; Lacouture 1993: 335) (43). His principal motive in trying to tie France and Germany together as firmly as possible - as in the élysée Treaty - was to try to avert a revival of the kind of anti-German Franco-Soviet alliance that had been formed before World War I and that De Gaulle had in fact tried to resurrect with Stalin in the 1944 Franco-Soviet pact (Akten 1963: 175; Schwarz 1994: 467, 815, 895). In the last year or so of his Chancellorship, Adenauer also moved closer to France for fear that the US might betray (Federal) German interests (as he interpreted them) in direct talks with the Soviet Union over Berlin and in the hope that De Gaulle would take a tougher stance against the Soviets (Schwarz 1994: 814). In aligning himself more closely with De Gaulle, however, Adenauer alienated himself from the majority of the CDU/CSU, not to mention the other main parties, which prioritised the relationship with the United States and strongly supported British EU entry (Schwarz 1994: 720-722, 763-765). Adenauer's increasing political isolation was illustrated by the struggle over the ratification of the Elysée Treaty. His successor, Erhard, and the German foreign minister since 1961, Schröder, wanted a wider and more liberal Europe than De Gaulle and attached higher priority to the relationship with the United States than with France (44). Erhard showed De Gaulle \"the cold shoulder\" (Osterheld 1992: 388); he disagreed with almost every item of the French president's foreign policy (Willis 1968: 324).\n\nThese disagreements did not prevent Erhard making a \"decisive contribution\" to settling the cereal price dispute - \"largely at our urging\", according to the French foreign minister (Couve de Murville 1971: 263 and quoted in Peyrefitte 1997: 278; Osterheld 1992: 141; Vaïsse 1997: 553). By this time, however, Franco-German relations had already deteriorated seriously; in 1965, as De Gaulle set out to destroy the EU's supranational vocation, they grew even worse. For Paris, Bonn \"really did the minimum to avoid a rupture\" at the June council meeting and nothing to facilitate a settlement of the conflict between France and the other member states in the ensuing crisis (Couve de Murville 1971: 263). For Bonn, the crisis was precipitated exclusively by France, whose boycott represented a \"naked treaty infringement\" (Lahr 1981: 430).\n\nThe divergent paths taken by De Gaulle and Couve de Murville, on the one hand, and Erhard and Schröder, on the other hand, on these issues of 'high politics' could only damage the two governments' capacity to resolve their conflicts over agricultural policy, since this capacity was heavily dependent - especially on the German side - on the respective leaders' and foreign ministers' subordination of sectoral to longer-term macro-political priorities. If the resolution of the conflicts over agricultural policy had been left entirely in the hands of the French and German agricultural ministries, the CAP would presumably never have seen the light of day - the bureaucracy in the Bonn ministry was hostile to the EU (Freisberg 1965: 92-96). The Economics Ministry's attitude to the EU and the Franco-German relationship was ambivalent (see Müller-Armack 1971: 225-241) (45). In Bonn, the strongest supporters of the European integration process and a close Franco-German relationship were to be found at the highest echelons of government: in the Foreign Office and the Federal Chancellor's Office. From the outset, the French and German foreign offices evidently tried to coordinate their positions on EU issues. Without their \"close\" cooperation, according to the French foreign minister, the creation of the CAP and the abolition of tariff barriers between the member states would hardly have been possible (Couve de Murville 1971: 242). Notwithstanding this, relations between the foreign ministers became more strained after Schröder acceded to the office in Germany and especially after De Gaulle's veto of the British entry bid. Although Schröder defended the élysée Treaty, he thought that Franco-German rivalry was inevitable and that Germany was not suited to being France's junior partner (Kusterer 1995: 201) (46). He advised Erhard not to agree to the common milk, rice and meat prices in 1963 (Schwarz 1994: 886), then pressed him to accept the common cereals price in 1964, then was held responsible by the French at least for the tough stance taken by the German government in the 1965-66 crisis (Peyrefitte 1997: 249, 286-287) (47). In 1965, there was no longer any major political actor on either side of the Rhine with both the political will and political authority required to avert a crisis. Indeed, on this occasion, exceptionally, the clash between the highest echelons of the two governments over institutional issues seems to have been more intense than that between the agricultural ministers over farming issues.\n\nIII. The GATT Uruguay Round and the CAP Reform 1986-1993\n\nAfter the 1965-66 crisis and the 'Luxembourg Compromise', unanimous voting was institutionalised in the Council of Agricultural Ministers. This practice actually benefited the German minister, who wanted the highest guaranteed prices and was primarily responsible for their being set well above world market levels (Tracy 1989: 269-270). The Commission, whose members had accepted the \"bad compromises\" of the 1960s so as not to endanger the overall integration process, was reduced or confined to the role of an 'honest broker', searching for the lowest common denominator between the member states and unable to bring about major changes in the CAP (von der Groeben 1983: 300-302; Tracy 1989: 265) (48). The Commission's weakness and the importance of French and German attitudes in CAP politics were exemplified in the conflict over the Mansholt Plan, whose aim was to modernise European agriculture by creating a smaller number of larger, more productive farms. Among the member states, France and Germany most strongly opposed the plan, which, after a struggle lasting several years, was finally adopted, but in an extremely diluted form that bore little resemblance to the original proposal, in 1972 (Pinder 1991: 83-85). The guiding hands of the French and German governments were likewise evident in the permanent arrangements for financing the CAP adopted in 1969. These were reportedly based on a broader agreement reached between the French President Pompidou and the German Chancellor Brandt that also embraced the issue of British entry into the EU (Gerbet 1990: 94; Brandt 1993: 454). Germany became by far the biggest net contributor to the CAP budget. Helmut Schmidt, German Chancellor from 1974 to 1982, wanted to reform the CAP and tried, but, by his own admission, had \"only minimal success\" (Schmidt 1990: 190). His scope to push for and secure major changes in the policy was limited by his dependence on a coalition partner, the FDP, which provided the Agricultural Minister and did not want to antagonise German farmers, and by his fear that any attempt to do so would cause \"serious irritations\" in the Franco-German relationship, which, in his view, became and remained closer during his Chancellorship than it had been even in the times of De Gaulle and Adenauer (Schmidt 1990: 143, 172) (49). During the 1970s and 1980s, German farmers and their organisations made their peace with the CAP and developed into ardent defenders of the policy, which was viewed very critically, on the other hand, by business interests and the Economics Ministry, which had originally hoped that the Europeanisation of agricultural policy would erode Germany's tradition of agricultural protectionism. In the Agricultural Council, France and Germany formed a \"strong mutually protective alliance\", whereby France supported the high internal prices demanded by Germany and Germany the export subsidies consequently required by France to be able to sell its agricultural produce on the world market (Moyer 1993b: 11).\n\nFor two reasons, one internal and the other external to the EU, reform of the CAP finally became a serious political issue in the second half of the 1980s. First, the policy, with its tendency to produce growing produce surpluses, gradually grew so expensive that it threatened to 'break' the EU budget. Second, important trading partners of the EU began to exert pressure on the EU to change a policy which was held responsible for disturbing world agricultural markets - and enabling EU exporters to gain a growing share of them. With a view to curbing EU subsidisation of its agricultural exports, the US and the agricultural-product-exporting states that later coalesced in the 'Cairns Group' insisted that agriculture be put on the agenda of proposed new GATT trade liberalisation negotiations. In the absence of an agreed multilateral framework for agricultural trade, the EU had to reckon with the possibility of the CAP being attacked through the GATT disputes procedure and, for fear of provoking a spiral of trade wars, being forced gradually to dismantle it. Among the EU member states, only France resisted the launching of a new GATT round (50). It agreed finally to agricultural trade at least being discussed in the round, apparently because it \"wanted to avoid a major break with Germany\" of the kind that its veto of a new GATT round would have precipitated (Odell 1993: 247). The German delegation at the opening round of the conference honoured the French government's preparedness to compromise by supporting its demands concerning the round's agenda (Odell 1993: 247).\n\nThe conflicts over the Uruguay Round and CAP reform took place in an EU that had twice as many member states as it had had at the time of the CAP's creation in the early 1960s and in which, beginning in the mid-1980s, more extensive use was being made of qualified majority voting in the council, so that the capacity of single member states to block the Brussels decision-making process was reduced. In the case of the Uruguay Round, the Commission was supposed to negotiate with other GATT member states on the basis of a negotiating mandate adopted by the Council of Ministers and to consult the '113 Committee', a body consisting of high-level civil servants from the member states' trade and economics ministries, foreseen in the Rome Treaty and designed to oversee the Commission's conduct of trade negotiations with third countries. Any agreement reached by the Commission required the council's approval. Normally, the council could decide by a qualified majority, but the range of issues covered in the Uruguay Round was so great that it was uncertain whether a new treaty required qualified majority or unanimous support in the council. Although the Commissioner for External Relations and the Commission DG I had overall responsibility for the conduct of the negotiations and reported to the General Affairs Council, talks on agricultural trade were conducted for the Commission by the DG VI, headed by the Agriculture Commissioner, who reported to the Agricultural Council.\n\nThe successive enlargements had increased the diversity of agricultural interests in the EU. France and Germany no longer occupied the two most extreme positions on agricultural and agricultural trade issues. Rather than from Germany, the strongest support for a reform of the CAP and agricultural trade liberalisation came from Britain, which has a very small and relatively productive agricultural sector, followed by Holland and Denmark, both of which have very competitive, export-oriented agricultural sectors and could survive well with a more liberal and less expensive agricultural policy. The strongest supporters of the status quo was France and Ireland. As in the 1960s, the German government was divided on these issues and its position in Brussels poorly coordinated. On the one hand, the Economics Ministry was extremely critical of the CAP and wanted the EU to make extensive concessions on agricultural trade in order to secure a Uruguay Round agreement. On the other hand, the Agricultural Ministry opposed major changes in the CAP and was very reluctant for the EU to make agricultural trade concessions in the GATT talks. If, at this level, its position coincided closely with that of the French government, on concrete issues there were important differences, which had their roots in the greater inefficiency and weaker world market orientation of German, compared with French, agriculture. On the issue of how production ought to be curbed that lay at the heart of the CAP reform debate, the German minister opposed price cuts, which the French government supported, and instead supported administrative measures to take land out of production ('set-aside'), which his French counterpart opposed. On the issues of market-opening (increasing imports of foreign agricultural produce into the EU) and 're-balancing' (imposing tariffs on hitherto duty-free imports of foreign agricultural produce in exchange for reducing tariffs on imports of produce on which duties were already imposed), there was little difference between the positions of the two agricultural ministries, which were against market-opening and for 're-balancing'. However, compared with Bonn, Paris was more prepared to contemplate cuts in the subsidies paid to EU farmers, while Bonn was more amenable to cuts in subsidies for exports beyond the EU - from which French farmers benefited much more extensively than their German counterparts.\n\nOn top of these differences, there was a profound divergence in attitudes of civil society in the two countries towards trade liberalisation and the importance of the protection of agriculture. In Germany, the DBV was the only relevant organised interest that opposed trade liberalisation. Via the Economics Ministry and the Chancellor, organised business interests tried to exert their influence to ensure that the Uruguay Round did not collapse on conflicts over agricultural trade. All the relevant political parties - from the moderate right to the Greens on the left - basically supported trade liberalisation. In France, the situation was reversed. The political Left and Right were divided over the Uruguay Round between strong liberalisation opponents and moderate supporters. The principal peak organisation of business, the CNPF (Confédération Nationale du Patronat Français - French National Employers' Confederation) was split between liberal and protectionist member associations; the trade unions were also split. The farmers' associations, on the other hand, were united in their hostility to agricultural trade liberalisation. Public opinion on trade liberalisation, especially agricultural trade liberalisation, was predominantly hostile, pressing the government to stand firm and to risk, if necessary, the talks' collapse.\n\n1. The failure of the Brussels talks 1990\n\nVery little progress had been made in agricultural trade liberalisation talks by autumn 1990, shortly before the Brussels GATT summit at which, originally, the round had been scheduled to finish. Up to this point, the Brussels Commission had negotiated on the basis of an 'overall approach', practically an informal mandate, worked out between the Commission and the Dutch council presidency in 1985 and so called to \"pacify the French\" (interview). In September 1990 the Commission finally proposed a formal mandate, which it asked the Agricultural Council to approve (51). Numerous agricultural ministers found the Commission's proposals to be too radical. The council met on no fewer than seven occasions to discuss them. Only Britain, Holland and Denmark gave the proposals their full support (Agra Europe, no. 1410, 12 October 1990: E/4). The strongest opposition to them came in the first two meetings from the German minister, Kiechle, who, under pressure from DBV, was particularly worried about the implications of 'tarification', the conversion of physical and other non-tariff barriers to agricultural imports to the EU into normal tariffs (interview). The intensity of Kiechle's opposition, or at least the 'cover' that he enjoyed from Chancellor Kohl, may be explained by the fact that federal elections, the first in the united Germany, were to take place in early December: \"The last thing that Chancellor Kohl wanted to do in such circumstances was to alienate the farming lobby within the Christian Democratic party\" (Paemen and Bensch 1995: 178; interviews) (52). Encouraged by the German stance, the French minister added his voice and opposition to Kiechle's. The formation of this Franco-German alliance, which was supported by Ireland, explained why so many meetings were required for the council to approve a mandate, one which was finally \"much watered-down\", compared with the Commission's proposal, and provoked a \"barrage of criticism\" among the EU's negotiating partners (Paemen and Bensch 1995: 178; Moyer 1993a: 107-111; Agra Europe No. 1410, 12 October 1990: E/4-5; no.1411, 19 October 1990: P/3 and E/1; no. 1413, 2 November 1990: P/1; and no. 1414, 9 November 1990: P/1-2). Kohl is alleged to have instructed the German delegation in the decisive meeting to support the French demands \"to the hilt\" (Frankfurter Rundschau, 7 November 1990). Given the extreme divergence between the positions of the EU, which was prepared to offer agricultural subsidy cuts of no more than 15 per cent, and the US, which demands cuts of 75 to 90 per cent, the failure of the Brussels summit was practically a foregone conclusion (53).\n\n2. The CAP reform\n\n1992 Fiscal pressures prompted the first attempts to reform the CAP in the 1980s. In 1988, as the CAP threatened to 'break' the EU budget, a so-called 'stabilisers package' was adopted, foreseeing reductions in support prices if production exceeded agreed limits. According to Patterson, more radical measures were prevented by the French and German governments, in particular by their respective leaders' apprehension that they would be sanctioned by farmers in pending elections if they were to acquiesce in a thoroughgoing CAP reform (Patterson 1997: 147-149) (54). The package failed to break the CAP's spending dynamic, so that, already by 1990, the issue of what to do to curb spiralling CAP costs was back on the EU agenda.\n\nAgricultural Commissioner MacSharry actually published first proposals for a fresh reform of the CAP on the day the Brussels GATT summit opened. The timing was no coincidence. Despite official denials and despite the internal, fiscal pressures for changes in the CAP, the \"broad thrust\" and, especially, the timing of the reform were dictated primarily by the pressures exerted on the EU in the Uruguay Round (interview; Paemen and Bensch 1995: 194). First discussions about a new, more radical reform took place in the Commission DG VI in early 1990. Subsequently, DG VI conceived and drafted the proposals \"in consultation with the important member states\" (interview). Between MacSharry and Delors, there appears to have been consensus over the aim of the reform, which was intended to safeguard the European \"agricultural model\" by keeping small farmers on the land, while, especially by reducing European surpluses, making the CAP more compatible with the \"imperatives\" of international trade (interviews; Ross 1995: 107-115) (55). MacSharry's ideas were discussed and approved by the Commission in 1991: essentially, for cereals at least, they involved much more radical price cuts than had ever previously been proposed (35 per cent), in combination with the introduction of direct payments to smaller farms in place of price support and making such payments conditional upon land being taken out of production ('set aside'). In the Agricultural Council, the ideas were received correspondingly positively by countries with mainly small farms, including Portugal, Spain, Italy and "
