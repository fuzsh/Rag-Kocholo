        "meta_description": "The subject file ‘The “Franco-German duo” and Europe as seen in cartoons (1945–2013)’ uses French and German press illustrations to explore the joint action of successive French Presidents and German Chancellors as the driving force of European integration. This file has been compiled to mark the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Élysée Treaty on 22 January 1963, which sealed the historic reconciliation between the two countries. It offers a humorous, quirky interpretation of this important historical period in which a united Europe began to take shape, and reflects on more than 50 years of Franco-German cooperation.",
