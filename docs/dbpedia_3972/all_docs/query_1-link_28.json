        "text": "In May 2021, the French media commemorated the fortieth anniversary of François Mitterrand's 1981 presidential victory which, after twenty-three years of opposition, signalled the return to power of the French left. Left-leaning commentators, as well as their counterparts on the right, predictably recited the popular narrative that the socialist government headed by Pierre Mauroy (1981–4) executed a dramatic economic ‘U-turn’ on 23 March 1983, when François Mitterrand publicly endorsed an austerity plan better known as the tournant de la rigueur. The programme had been designed by his economic advisers and Jacques Delors, Minister of Finance at the time. It was the translation of Mitterrand's commitment, notably to the German government, to take the necessary steps to improve the value of the franc relative to other currencies in the European Monetary System (EMS).Footnote 1 Two days earlier, at a meeting of the eight members of the EMS in Brussels, West Germany agreed to the devaluation of the franc against other EMS currencies by only 2.5 per cent, although the Germans revalued the mark upward by 5.5 per cent.Footnote 2 On 25 March, in exchange for this German concession, Delors outlined a set of ten additional austerity measures – the first of which had been introduced in June 1982 – whose central goal was to reduce domestic demand by 65 billion francs.Footnote 3\n\nIn the collective memory of the left, especially among its more radical strands, the tournant de la rigueur represented a brutal betrayal of Mitterrand's voters by the French Socialist Party (PS). The PS failed to uphold its previous commitment to a break with capitalism, or at least to promoting an economic alternative that would deliver France from austerity and mass unemployment. One reason for the persistence of this view is that the PS had been a repeat offender on this front. The Jospin government (1997–2002) carried out numerous privatisations, while the Hollande presidency (2012–17) cut business taxes and imposed labour market flexibility.Footnote 4 Regarding the tournant de la rigueur, a long article in the radical leftist online newspaper Mediapart offers a telling example of this narrative by claiming that ‘25 March 1983, constitutes one of the founding acts of neoliberalism à la française’.Footnote 5 Commentators and intellectuals on the right shared the view that the 1983 plan de rigueur was a decisive turning point in the economic and political history of contemporary France. From their perspective, however, the decision reflected a belated but nonetheless welcome awareness of ‘economic realities’:\n\nMost English-language publications in the social sciences have echoed these narratives. Two recent studies of twentieth-century European history demonstrate the extent to which international scholars have continued to adhere to commentators’ and participants’ views of the tournant de la rigueur. Konrad Jarausch has endorsed the leftist view that ‘the rapid failure of his socialist program . . . forced Mitterrand to join the neoliberal camp, albeit rather reluctantly.’Footnote 7 On the opposite side of the political spectrum, Ian Kershaw notes that the economic policies implemented in France, West Germany and Italy in the 1980s cannot be defined as neoliberal. Yet he has offered a similar narrative to the French right. Kershaw thus contends that the combination of Keynesian relaunch and nationalisation was ‘an unmitigated failure’ that compelled Mitterrand to undertake a dramatic economic reversal between June 1982 and March 1983.Footnote 8 Despite their differences, these two historical accounts support two widespread beliefs about this decision-making process. Both depict a callous reversal of economic policy from relaunch to rigueur that illustrated the general conversion of elected socialist politicians, in-office experts and senior civil servants from Keynesianism to what many scholars define as ‘neoliberalism’. However alluring this interpretation may be, this article argues that the proximity between scholarly literature and memories of the tournant de la rigueur ought to elicit a response from researchers interested in the period.\n\nSymbols greatly matter in politics and it is true that the political dimension of the government's decisions in March 1983 was crucial. The French began to realise that the economic crisis and mass unemployment were likely to have an impact on their daily lives for a long time.Footnote 9 Leftist intellectuals who had continued to support the values of libertarian protest that emerged in the ‘roaring 1960s’ were bitterly disillusioned. The philosopher and psychoanalyst Félix Guattari blamed Mitterrand for appointing ‘a piecemeal management team whose language differences with Reagan's “Chicago boys” should not conceal the fact that it leads us to the same kinds of aberrations’.Footnote 10 Far from isolated, this sort of public reaction revealed that the second austerity plan brought what had been a largely hidden agenda into the light of day.Footnote 11 In terms of French economic policy, however, I argue that the 1983 austerity plan did not constitute a sudden shift, let alone a neoliberal turn inspired by the Reagan and Thatcher administrations.\n\nAs an analytic construct, the concept of neoliberalism helps us to better understand the key transformations of capitalism and the state between the 1970s and the present, although it is increasingly a subject of debate between what may be viewed as two scholarly camps. Some contend that neoliberalism is both excessively ambiguous and ideologically charged. They consider the construct to be ‘the linguistic omnivore of our times, a neologism that threatens to swallow up the other words around it’,Footnote 12 suggesting that its high degree of flexibility – ‘a rubber word’ according to the French historian Pierre Rosanvallon – should wholly disqualify it.Footnote 13 Several scholars have challenged such a radical epistemological conclusion, however. Instead of calling for the downfall of neoliberalism as an analytical category, they emphasise its utility, provided that it is defined precisely – which was rarely the case before the 2010s.Footnote 14 Recent literature on the subject focuses on the varieties of neoliberalism.Footnote 15 It insists particularly on its resilience as an intellectual and political project that enabled it to overcome significant crises, including the 2007–8 financial shock.Footnote 16 This vast body of work has also underscored the ability of this multifaceted concept to unite ambiguous political alliances with ideologies ranging from Reagan's ‘new social conservatism’Footnote 17 and Trump's radical right populismFootnote 18 to Western European social democracy since the 1980s.Footnote 19 The utility of the concept extends even to communist regimes, as demonstrated by the influence of American neoclassical economics on several Hungarian ‘reform economists’ in the early years of the Cold War and the crucial case of contemporary China.Footnote 20\n\nA definitive response to this major historiographical debate is clearly beyond the scope of this article. This does not suggest that the present author rejects neoliberalism as a suitable analytical tool for studying the transformations of capitalism and the state in Western Europe after the 1970s. Some major realms of public policy have undoubtedly been influenced by a set of ideas that originated in various intellectual strains linked to the concept, including German Ordoliberalism and the ‘American schools of new economic liberalism’.Footnote 21 Nevertheless, in the French case, and more widely in the history of Western European social democracy, I contend that it would be wrong to attempt to grasp the 1980s as a single entity. In the early years of the decade, the concept of neoliberalism failed to encompass the inner dynamics of the economic policy achieved by the Mauroy government.\n\nThis is not to imply that nothing of importance took place. Mitterrand's choice to maintain France within the EMS officialised the resignation of socialist elites (both politicians and experts) to privilege pro-market recipes in the management of macroeconomic and monetary policies. In the last months of Mauroy's term as prime minister, his economic advisers as well as their counterparts belonging to the Mitterrand and Delors cabinets increasingly claimed that the choice of austerity was the sole available alternative.Footnote 22 But this process of naturalisation of economic issues did not begin in 1983, which was still a time of hesitation and contradictions, even in the wake of the decisions made in March. Moreover, the set of economic measures implemented under the Mauroy government appeared far from the recipes for the United Kingdom promoted by Margaret Thatcher. Monetarism failed to penetrate inside the cabinets and administration, whereas most of Thatcher's economic advisors belonged to this intellectual strain – albeit different types of monetarists cohabited within her cabinet.Footnote 23 Nor did a ‘think-tank archipelago’ emerge at this time that strove to disseminate neoliberal ideas within French Socialist Party (PS) circles.Footnote 24 Similarly, the economic role of the state via the nationalisation of banks and industries was diametrically opposed to Thatcher's primitive politics and mass privatisations and deregulation. The growing porosity between public and private actors in France developed later in the 1990s.Footnote 25 Finally, until Mauroy's resignation, socialist elites kept effective links, however complicated, with trade unions and the French Communist Party (PCF), while one of the major neoliberal traits of Thatcher's policies was clearly its unconditional ‘enthusiasm for combating the unions’.Footnote 26 As shown below, the model most admired inside cabinets as well as among top civil servants in the finance ministry was not the UK – relentlessly called an anti-model – but West Germany.Footnote 27 In sum, rather than a U-turn, the tournant de la rigueur should be seen as a progressive curve, which implies it belongs to a broader chronology that began in late 1981 and ended with the appointment of Laurent Fabius as prime minister in July 1984. The notion of a turn to ‘austerity with a human face’ coined by Eric Hobsbawm is probably the most subtle scholarly expression to attempt to grasp the spirit of these changes.Footnote 28\n\nDispelling widespread beliefs about the tournant requires the use of key works on the subject, as well as long-standing personal research on the history of French socialism and its relationship to capitalism, European social democracy and the state from the Second World War to the present. This article relies on important literature on the Mitterrand years, as well as archival, print and oral sources.Footnote 29 By the late 1990s, several economic and political historians, later joined by a few political scientists, sociologists and a handful of heterodox economists, had demonstrated that March 1983 was not the cornerstone of the neoliberalisation of French capitalism, if neoliberalism is defined as a set of policies intended to ‘encase [markets], to inoculate capitalism against the threat of democracy, to create a framework to contain often-irrational human behaviour’ and to shape an international economic order ‘as a space of competing states in which borders fulfil a necessary function’.Footnote 30 Archival research played a crucial role in this reconsideration, notably thanks to the gradual declassification of governmental and administrative records. Historians have relied on a growing body of new information to re-examine the chronology and underlying logic of the Mauroy government's economic policies, illustrating that the concept of neoliberalism fails to account for changes between late 1981 and March 1983. They contend that the tournant de la rigueur should be understood primarily, although not exclusively, as a political and symbolic shift rather than an abrupt neoliberal conversion initiated by French socialist elites.\n\nWith a few remarkable exceptions,Footnote 31 this alternative view has largely been ignored outside specialised academic circles that publish principally in French. Most English-language scholarship continues to defend the argument of a brutal neoliberal U-turn. Proponents of this interpretation have generally disregarded the existence of a twenty-year-old critical historiography of this event. This article examines how and why the prevailing narrative of the ‘brutal U-turn’ (whether neoliberal or not) became rooted in the scholarly imagination despite the existence of a convincing critical historiography. It also pleads for the disentanglement of scholarly work from the overdramatised accounts of political figures and commentators.\n\nThe article begins by outlining the mechanisms that show how the narrative of an abrupt economic U-turn came to dominate public and scholarly discourses. The second section supports the contention that this interpretation of the tournant influenced a vast body of English-language scholarship that describes the decisions made in March 1983 as a decisive moment in the conversion of French socialism to neoliberalism. The third section examines the deconstruction of this mainstream view by critical francophone historiography and calls into question histories of the event that have neglected primary sources."
