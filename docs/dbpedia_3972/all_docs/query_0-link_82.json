        "text": "Symbolically Francois Mitterrand’s first day as president, on May 21, 1981, was richer than those of his predecessors.1He met with the outgoing president at the Élysée Palace. He laid a wealth at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier beneath the Arc de Triomphe. He delivered his inaugural address. He hosted the official reception for five hundred or so people. In all this, he followed the ceremonial path previously trod by de Gaulle, Pompidou, and Giscard. He departed from them by officially ending the day’s ceremonies with a pilgrimage to the Pantheon to honor France’s past and some of the nation’s leading statesmen, scientists, philosophers, and soldiers who are entombed there. Mitterrand deepened his visit’s symbolism by the people he chose to accompany him. Among the bevy of far-left political and labor union leaders were such international cultural icons as Carlos Fuentes, Elie Wiesel, Arthur Miller, William Styron, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. Mitterrand descended alone into the crypt to pay homage and leave a red rose before the tombs of three leaders: the socialist Jean Jaures, the anti-Nazi resistance fighter Jean Moulin, and the abolitionist Victor Schoelcher. As he ascended smiling to the nave, an orchestra played Beethoven’s Ode to Joy, the European Community’s official anthem, then the Marseillaise, with world-renowned tenor Placido Domingo singing the lyrics."
