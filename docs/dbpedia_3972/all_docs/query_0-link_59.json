        "text": "Polls currently show that Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, President of the Rassemblement National, will be the two favored candidates for the first round. Interestingly, they show the same voting intentions today as the finalists of 1981 (Giscard and Mitterrand): 28-26%. How voters from across the political spectrum will position themselves regarding Macron and Le Pen in the second round will be crucial for determining who will win the election. This projection is still difficult to make, as no other parties from either the Left or the Right have officially confirmed their candidates. The Right is likely to go through a period of high tension if its \"natural\" candidate, Xavier Bertrand, a former member of Les Républicains - should he be selected as their official candidate - doesn’t top his 15% of voting intentions. If this is the case, the Right is likely to implode into two groups: those who will want to rally around Macron and those who will want a big Right-wing alliance including the far-Right’s Rassemblement National. France’s upcoming regional elections (in June 2021) will help clarify what the likely trend will be, especially if the Rassemblement National wins in one or several of the larger regions. All in all, if many Left-wing voters refuse to rally with Macron, and if there is a growing appetite for Les Républicains voters to rally behind Le Pen, then she could win.\n\nScenario #5 teaches us that the election can be played out - in fact, it is mostly played out - two or three months before the election. That is why polls conducted before this timeframe have limited predictive value.\n\nAn early defeat\n\nScenario #6: in 1995, the candidate was actually the prime minister in cohabitation, Edouard Balladur (not the president, François Mitterrand). Like for President Giscard in 1981, Balladur was the given winner for a very long time, in both the first and second rounds of elections. As in 1981, he faced competition from a rival from his own camp, Jacques Chirac. But this time, the rival was ahead and eliminated him in the first round. And just like in 1981, the all-changing crystallization occurred at the end of February, three months before the final vote.\n\nA re-election\n\nOf course another scenario remains possible: that of the re-election of the incumbent. How feasible is this? Can Macron stay in power for a second (and final) term?\n\nThe most recent polls on the prospects of a second round suggest a head to head between Macron and Le Pen with Macron winning 54% of the popular vote. Macron’s talk will be to hold onto all of these votes. If not, he might not be perceived as a strong enough alternative to Le Pen.\n\nIf Macron wants to be re-elected, a few conditions would need to be met:\n\nAs said, Macron’s level of popularity (or relative unpopularity) would have to remain the same as it is now, or maybe even increase, especially if France manages to avoid a fourth wave of coronavirus.\n\nCurrent Right-wing candidate Xavier Bertrand’s attempt at a \"triangulation\" would need to fail, leaving Macron all the space he needs to garner the Right-wing vote.\n\nThus covering the Right-wing space, he would then need to bank on Right-wing voters not casting their vote in favor of Marine Le Pen, in both the first but especially in the second round. This may explain why he is insisting on security issues at the moment.\n\nIn the event that he does face Marine Le Pen in the second round, the number of no-shows and blank votes would need to be low. Left-wing voters would especially need to show up in the second round to vote against Le Pen.\n\nA solid prediction cannot be made at this stage. The feasibility analysis has at least the advantage of shedding light on the possible conditions for one of the three most probable scenarios to occur. At 54-46%, the gap between Macron and Le Pen is much tighter than it has ever been in the past. Though this is not yet the predominant scenario, the \"Le Pen\" threat certainly does exist.\n\nCopyright: Eric FEFERBERG / AFP"
