        "text": "Having focused on international financial issues and European integration as deputy and later head of international affairs at the French Treasury from 1981 to early 1986, I was back to taking charge of domestic economic policy. In March of 1986, I was appointed chief of staff for Finance Minister Edouard Balladur.\n\nAfter the Bretton Woods system of fixed exchange rates collapsed, Giscard d'Estaing and Helmut Schmidt led European efforts to introduce in 1979 the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a system designed to keep exchange fluctuations among the region's currencies within a set range. In 1980, France had a budget surplus but consumer price inflation was much too high, nearly double the rate in Germany. Our goal was to foster progressive disinflation by more solidly anchoring the French currency."
