        "text": "In early June, about 200 million voters across Europe turned out to elect members of the European Parliament. For politicians and pundits, these polls are a bellwether for national sentiment. In France, the National Rally received 31 per cent of the vote, more than double that of President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist Renaissance Party. “They mobilised anger over fuel duties,” says Monash University’s Ben Wellings, of the so-called “gilet jaunes”, or yellow jacket, protests as well as over “immigration, terrorism and security, and relations between French Muslim communities and secular visions for France.” A protest vote against a sitting government is common in these elections, says Romain Fathi, a senior lecturer at ANU, “but the scale of this slap in the face is definitely unprecedented”.\n\nAs the humiliation of the Renaissance Party sunk in, Macron called a snap election that surprised the French public and even members of his government, propelling some 250,000 people into anti-far-right protests in several cities, carrying posters that read, “Young people hate the FN” (Front National) and “Liberty for all, Equality for all and Fraternity with all.”\n\nSaid Macron: “France needs a clear majority to move forward with serenity and harmony.” He is just over two years into a five-year term, and the vote will not decide his presidency. The election is a decision on the make-up of the French parliament – the 577 seats of the National Assembly. Parliamentary elections need to be held every five years, but the president can call them once a government has sat for at least 12 months.\n\nTo understand why Macron called the election, it’s worth rewinding to 2022. Macron had won a second (and final) presidency, and two months later, his party contested a parliamentary election where his governing coalition, Ensemble, which included Renaissance and several other parties, lost its majority. His prime minister, Elisabeth Borne, was forced into a situation of using a special constitutional power, Article 49.3, that enables a government to bypass a logjam in parliament. “It has upset the French a lot because it means that the government is acting alone,” says Fathi. Borne resigned in January after the passage of controversial immigration laws that strengthened the government’s power to deport some foreigners.\n\nMacron then appointed Gabriel Attal, 35, who is France’s youngest modern prime minister, in an attempt to boost the party’s popularity and fight off rising populism ahead of the European elections. Those elections, however, were the final blow, leaving Macron with more disruption in the parliament and emboldening his critics, says Simon Tormey, a professor of European politics at Deakin University. “Macron is in his second term, and there is no third term,” he says. “What you’ve got is a lame duck, and that is what Macron hates. He is a chancer, a buccaneering figure with swagger, wanting to get stuff done.”\n\nMacron calculated the election would return his parliamentary majority, says Tormey. “That reintroduces [his] mandate and legitimacy.” Aurelien Mondon, a senior lecturer at the University of Bath, described Macron’s move as “incredibly risky”. “It is likely to normalise the far right further, whether they win or not, as they will most likely set the agenda in the campaign. Rather than a savvy move, I would qualify that as the actions of a petulant child.”\n\nMacron called the snap election an opportunity for “clarification”. The ANU’s Fathi says parties on Macron’s moderate left and right have been playing political games with the far left and far right. “It’s been extremely difficult for Macron to find allies with the moderate left and the moderate right.” Calling an election, says Fathi, was intended to divide them and make the moderate parties pick a side.\n\nNews of the election initially caused chaos in the conservative Republican Party when its leader, Eric Ciotti, advocated an alliance with Le Pen, leading party heavyweights to attempt to oust him. However, Macron appears to have been relying on dividing the left, too. Instead, the left united under the banner of the New Popular Front, which includes former president Francois Hollande, who made a surprise comeback for this election.\n\n“Opening up the possibility of government to your main political rivals is sailing close to the wind, politically,” says Monash University’s Ben Wellings. If Macron’s gamble fails, Le Pen’s National Rally could take control of the parliament, in which case Macron would have to share power with a government formed by his opponents. The French call this “cohabitation”, a situation where the president and the prime minister are from opposing political sides (more on that below).\n\nIn France, the president and prime minister share the duties of government, with the president ultimately having the upper hand. Macron has broad powers over foreign policy and national defence, can dissolve parliament (as he has just done) and chooses the prime minister, although his pick does need the confidence of the National Assembly. “The prime minister comes from the majority,” says Fathi.\n\nSurprisingly, the prime minister does not have to be a sitting member of parliament; about a quarter since the time of Charles de Gaulle, who ushered in France’s Fifth Republic in 1958, have not been MPs. A president cannot, technically, sack a prime minister but can strongly suggest that they step down; typically, if a prime minister is struggling to lead the government, he or she will be asked to resign.\n\nCohabitation first occurred in the 1980s when president Francois Mitterand’s socialists lost the parliament to a centre right led by Jacques Chirac. “There were United Nations summits where the French prime minister would fly in his own prime-ministerial aircraft to represent France, and the president would do the same in his own different aircraft,” says Fathi. “In a way, the weirdest thing was the French were quite happy because half of the French felt represented, and so did the other half.”\n\nMitterand was forced into cohabitation again from 1993 to 1995, this time with conservative politician Edouard Balladur. Chirac’s turn again, this time with Lionel Jospin from 1997 to 2002, followed a snap election – after his government was weakened by protests against pension reform and plans to reduce France’s deficit – that Jospin’s socialist government won.\n\nShould Macron be obliged to appoint Bardella, what might their “cohabitation” look like? “An incredibly tense one,” suggests Ben Wellings.\n\nWhere does Le Pen’s party fit in France today?\n\nBardella is the first person to lead the National Rally party who is not a member of the Le Pen family. It was founded in 1972 as Front National by Jean-Marie Le Pen, a former member of the French Foreign Legion who had served in Vietnam and Algeria. A far-right organisation, it grew out of a neo-fascist movement called the Ordre Nouveau (New Order), which was broadly based on “the defence of the West, a fear of mingling and of otherness, and the search for a ‘third way’ between communism and capitalism”, writes Grégoire Kauffmann in the journal Pouvoirs.\n\nLe Pen had some electoral success as a member of the National Assembly and the European Parliament and ran unsuccessfully for president five times. But he would be best known for his unsavoury views as a Holocaust denier, defender of French colonialism and opponent of Muslim immigration. By 2011, he had largely run his race, and in 2012, leadership of the National Front passed to his daughter, Marine, who endeavoured to “detoxify” the party and make it more acceptable to mainstream voters.\n\nDistancing herself from her father’s views, in 2015, she went so far as to expel him from the party and, in 2018, renamed the party National Rally. Yet, the underlying values remained, says Michel Eltchaninoff, French philosopher and author of the investigative biography Inside the Mind of Marine Le Pen.\n\n“She has been distancing herself from her father for years and even got angry with him,” Eltchaninoff tells us from France. “By softening her speech, by speaking in allusions, she managed to convince a good part of the French that her party no longer had anything to do with the violent and racist National Front of yesteryear. Nobody, or almost no one, at the National Rally is caught in the act of racism or homophobia. But these impulses still exist, silently for the moment, in the party and its electorate.”\n\n‘She wants to reassure and show that she is comfortable among the people – but against the elites.’\n\nPhilosopher and author Michel Eltchaninoff on Marine Le Pen\n\nThese days, Le Pen presents herself more as a motherly cat lover than a far-right warrior, especially after standing down as party chair in 2022 to make way for Bardella. “She shows her love of pets, she uses humour,” says Eltchaninoff. “She wants to reassure and show that she is comfortable among the people – but against the elites.” In June, the National Rally cut ties with a candidate after discovering he had written an antisemitic post on social media in 2018.\n\nIt is widely believed that Le Pen’s decision to promote Bardella to party leader and to stand down from official party leadership herself (while remaining a potent public figurehead) was to clear the way for her own tilt at the presidency in 2027.\n\nYounger voters, says Ben Wellings, are one of the groups that the far right, radical right and hard right appeal to across Europe. “Young people disaffected with the political system and its abilities to address the various crises with which Gen Z is faced. The other group is middle-aged women, whom Le Pen symbolises.” For his part, Bardella has disavowed the party’s unpalatable past: what, he has asked, would he know about World War II? “I was born in 1995.”\n\nBehind the window dressing, though, says Eltchaninoff, the National Rally’s ideological affiliation “remains that of the extreme right”. “It is based on the idea that the indigenous people are threatened by foreigners who want to conquer the country, by an internal fifth column (the Muslims), and by elites ready to sell the body and soul of the country to these foreign forces. Like the representatives of the far right, she presents history as a plot against ethnic French people and politics as a fight against enemies ready for anything.”\n\nAnd where does he think Bardella fits into this picture? Eltchaninoff says: “Ideologically, he is more right-wing than Marine Le Pen. He discreetly adheres to the theory of the ‘Great Replacement’, which considers that the elites organise the replacement of the French by Muslim immigrants. Above all, he is very clever and politically plastic.”\n\nBardella has also been given an easy ride in some quarters, says the University of Bath’s Aurelien Mondon. “Unfortunately, much of the media and those who should scrutinise these politics have taken these actors at their word. This is why we have seen the rise of euphemistic terms such as populism, which are not only less accurate but allow for the normalisation of the far right.“\n\nAs for actual policies, the party initially opposed Macron’s controversial raising of the pension age from 62 to 64 in 2023, then appeared to walk this back after criticisms that reversing the change would have a dire effect on the French economy. However, in the lead-up to this election, Bardella has said he would introduce a repeal of the age increase by September, according to Le Monde. Other economic policies include a lower value-added tax on electricity and gas bills from 20 per cent to 5.5 per cent. Says Fathi: “What he says is empty, unrealistic, unfunded on any economic reasoning, but it is simple language that is understood by people who were previously disconnected from French politics.”\n\n‘If I am prime minister, I will pass in the first weeks an immigration law that will facilitate the expulsions of delinquents and Islamists.’\n\nJordan Bardella\n\nThe party’s position on immigration mirrors views Marine Le Pen has expressed for the past decade. “If I am prime minister,” Bardella says, “I will pass in the first weeks an immigration law that will facilitate the expulsions of delinquents and Islamists.” The party also plans to exclude undocumented migrants from state benefits and introduce a “double border” with Europe. He tells a radio talkback caller [translated from French]: “I want to assure everyone today, our fellow countrymen of foreign birth, or foreign origin, who work, who pay their taxes, who pay their contributions, who respect the law, who love our country, have absolutely nothing to fear.”\n\nCould Bardella really become prime minister?\n\n“Some French people, tired of their leaders, want to embark on this unpredictable adventure, a bit like Trump’s voters in 2016 or like Brexit supporters,” says Eltchaninoff. “The unknown is exhilarating and exciting. At the same time, the National Rally embodies order: merciless fight against delinquency, against immigration, against leftists, against liberals.”\n\nTo actually become prime minister, Bardella needs to either gain an absolute majority in the National Assembly or form alliances. He has said he would prefer to govern alone. Ahead of the June 30 poll, professor Philippe Marliere of University College London anticipated a chaotic situation where no party received an absolute majority. If the National Rally falls short by a narrow margin, the party might be able to negotiate with other parties to form a government.\n\nA close result could also force Macron’s party to negotiate a coalition that would return it with diminished power. Or, the left-wing alliance could theoretically succeed. “The union on the left could pay off and, depending on their campaign, they may bring people out of abstention,” Mondon said ahead of June 30.\n\n“Macron thought that by dissolving parliament, the nation would return him a majority,” said Marliere. “I’m pretty sure this has failed. It won’t work.” Macron had been holding hopes a “silent majority” of voters would prove to be against political extremes; he still hopes to rally more support for the next, and final, round of voting this coming weekend.\n\nFrench polling happens over two rounds: unless a candidate receives a clear majority in their electorate in the first round, the top candidates move to a second round. This will be on July 7. “Shortly thereafter, it will be clear whether France has a far-right government, a hard-left government, or a government of moderates united against both extreme sides of the political spectrum,” says Romain Fathi. “Given France’s traumatic experience of the Second World War and the collaboration of its far-right Vichy government with the Nazis, some French people who did not vote on Sunday may well head to the polling booth on July 7 to prevent the far right from winning these legislative elections and forming government.”\n\nMarliere says the election is the most dramatic he’s seen in his lifetime. If National Rally were to form a government, it would be the first time the French people had elected a far-right party during this republic. “That’s why it’s historic.”\n\nThis Explainer was first published on June 23 and has been updated to reflect developments following the June 30 poll."
