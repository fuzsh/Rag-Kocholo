        "text": "No matter which candidate wins this spring's French presidential elections, French foreign policy is likely to remain what it has been for three decades: proudly European and prepared to keep Anglo-Saxon influences at arm's length.\n\nAll of the three leading contenders, two conservatives claiming direct political lineage from the famously difficult de Gaulle and a Socialist hoping to inherit the mantle of President Francois Mitterrand, have been saying more or less the same things.\n\nThe campaign has been dominated by domestic concerns like unemployment, so foreign policy has not been an issue.\n\nIt was only Thursday that the front-runner, Mayor Jacques Chirac of Paris, a conservative, finally outlined his foreign policy platform in a speech to guests and the press. On relations with the United States, Mr. Chirac's position is not much different from that of his fellow conservative, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, or the Socialist contender, Lionel Jospin.\n\nThe first round of voting will take place on April 23, and a runoff between the two most successful contenders will decide the winner on May 7.\n\n\"It is of course in France's interest to consolidate Franco-American friendship despite the periodic, and in general superficial, frictions that we experience in our relations with our oldest ally,\" Mr. Chirac said.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
