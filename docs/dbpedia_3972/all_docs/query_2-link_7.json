        "text": "France's former PM Édouard Balladur has been acquitted in a corruption trial over a submarine deal with Pakistan in the mid-1990s.\n\nMr Balladur, 91, had faced charges of using commissions from the deal to fund a failed presidential bid in 1995.\n\nFormer defence minister François Léotard was given a two-year suspended sentence and fined €100,000 ($120,000) for complicity in misusing assets.\n\nSix men were jailed over the case last year.\n\nInvestigations into the so-called Karachi affair began after 11 French engineers were killed in a bombing in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi in 2002.\n\nPakistani authorities blamed Islamist militants, but there were suspicions that the attack was an act of revenge after then-French President Jacques Chirac ordered the payments of secret arms deal commissions to stop.\n\nBoth Mr Balladur and former minister Léotard, who were charged in 2017, had denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLast June, three former French government officials and three others were sentenced to between two and five years in jail over their involvement in the Karachi affair.\n\nThey included Mr Balladur's former campaign manager, a former adviser to Léotard and a former aide to France's ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy, who was then the minister in charge of sales and commissions."
