        "text": "PARIS — It’s nice to be elected French president. But it doesn’t amount to much if you don’t have a majority in parliament to implement your program.\n\nThe scenario looks increasingly likely this year. Two of the top three contenders for the presidency don’t have a well-oiled party machine to help them win the parliamentary elections due in June, one month after the presidential vote. And the third might only be able to count on a divided party.\n\nThat makes the June elections as important — if not more important than — the higher-profile presidential contest. Particularly in the case of the two insurgents running strong this year a split result in the two polls would leave a hobbled new executive at the Élysée Palace, possibly paralyzing the French political system.\n\nFar-right leader Marine Le Pen heads a party, the National Front, that has always struggled to win elections on a national scale. In spite of its constant rise over the last few years, it has only two deputies in the 577-member National Assembly.\n\nUpstart Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister, broke ranks with the Socialist Party. In April last year, he created what he still calls a “movement,” En Marche, which has never fielded candidates in any election, local or national.\n\nAs for François Fillon, the candidate from mainstream conservative party Les Républicains, he may look like the only one who can count on a big, professional machine experienced in managing elections. But Fillon — currently embroiled in allegations he used public funds to pay family members for fake jobs — could find it difficult to unite a party whose divisions were exposed by the battle for the presidential nomination last year. If elected, he may face a group of rebellious conservative MPs, and lack the authority to implement his hard-right platform.\n\nCohabitation frustration\n\nThe French constitution is an odd hybrid of the presidential and parliamentary systems usually seen in Western democracies. On one hand, the president is elected by popular vote — which makes them the nation’s true political leader. On the other hand, the prime minister selected by the president must be supported by a majority in parliament.\n\nThis spells trouble when voters choose a parliament in opposition to the president. It reduces the head of state to a figurehead, akin to northern European monarchs or ceremonial presidents such as those of Germany or Italy. In those times, the prime minister holds most of the executive powers, save for those governing foreign policy and defense, which the constitution puts specifically in the president’s domain.\n\nThis awkward power-sharing arrangement has its own word in the French political lexicon: cohabitation. It has happened three times in postwar history — first from 1986 to 1988, when Socialist President François Mitterrand had to live with Jacques Chirac as prime minister. From 1993 to 1995, Mitterrand had to deal with another conservative premier, Édouard Balladur. And finally, from 1997 to 2002, President Chirac had to contend with Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.\n\nNeedless to say, none of the interested parties later remembered the cohabitation experience as a happy one.\n\nThe risk this time is limited by the proximity of both elections, said Bruno Cautrès, a political scientist and pollster at CEVIPOF, the research center at Sciences Po university. In 2000, a constitutional reform shrank the presidential mandate from seven to five years, in order to limit the possibility of both branches of government pulling in different directions.\n\n“The idea was that it was unlikely that voters would change their minds within a few weeks and deny their elected president a parliamentary majority,” he said.\n\nThat could be different if Le Pen wins the presidency — an unlikely scenario for now — and shocked French voters then rush to the polls to elect a parliament tasked with curbing her powers, noted a senior official from Les Républicains.\n\n“I don’t see how she can get a majority of MPs in parliament unless a significant chunk of our guys decide to join her,” he added.\n\nMainstream alliance\n\nThe French majority voting system, with two rounds, allows parties to strike deals in the week before the runoff. A tacit or overt alliance between the left and the mainstream right has in the past managed to deny the National Front much of a presence in the lower house.\n\nLe Pen has previously indicated she has no objection to the cohabitation system. Asked in 2014 what she would do if her party won a parliamentary election that François Hollande was rumored to be considering, she replied that she was ready to work under the Socialist president. “He will inaugurate, he will commemorate, he does that very well. He will bend, or resign,” she said.\n\nWhether she would be so relaxed about cohabitation if she were the one reduced to inaugurating and commemorating is another matter.\n\nMacron, for his part, is intent on making sure he gets a cooperative parliament and has devoted a lot of attention to the matter in the last two months, said an aide.\n\nFirst, he wants En Marche — his eight-month-old movement — to field candidates in every electoral district. He has also put out the message that he wants to “renew” parliament, and called for people from “civil society” — i.e. non-professional politicians — to apply online if they want to run. Candidates will then be chosen by an independent commission. Finally, Macron has warned sitting MPs from left or right who want to rally behind his banner that En Marche would not feel bound to endorse them in the June election.\n\nThat last bit has been greeted with skepticism. “Say you’ve got a good MP with a strong chance of being reelected who wants the En Marche label, you’re not going to mess around with that and tell him thanks but no thanks,” said a Socialist Party official sympathetic to Macron’s ideas.\n\n“A weak president unable to govern in a hostile faceoff with an atomized parliament? You’re talking major chaos” — Socialist official"
