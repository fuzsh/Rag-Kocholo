        "text": "True, Raffarin heads a government that will be able to do more or less what it likes over the next five years, thanks to the centre-right’s whopping parliamentary majority. But the real second-in-command in President Jacques Chirac’s new, blue France is Alain Juppé, a provincial mayor who is not even a minister.\n\nMost experts agree that Juppé masterminded the Right’s stunning victory in this year’s parliamentary and presidential elections and he is without doubt Chirac’s most trusted confidant.\n\n‘For the first time in the Fifth Republic, the couple who hold and exercise power is not the president and the prime minister, but the Chirac-Juppé duo,” French journalist Hervé Gattegno recently wrote in centre-left daily Le Monde.\n\nGattegno said Bordeaux mayor Juppé was Chirac’s eminence grise and France’s “shadow prime minister”. In fact, the eminence grise tag is not entirely appropriate, as Juppé is one of France’s best-known politicians.\n\nIn 1993 he was appointed foreign minister in the ‘cohabitation’ government that saw centre-right Prime Minister Edouard Balladur sharing power with socialist President François Mitterrand.\n\nThen, in 1995, a newly elected President Chirac asked Juppé to form a government.\n\nJuppé’s two years as premier were his political nadir. His efforts to reform France’s creaking pensions and social security system sparked nationwide strikes and successive polls revealed him to be the country’s most unpopular premier in nearly 50 years.\n\nIn a bid to reassert his government’s political authority, Chirac decided to call snap parliamentary elections in 1997.\n\nHe gambled that the silent majority in favour of Juppé’s reforms would be bigger than the noisy minority protesting against them in the streets.\n\nHe was wrong. A coalition of the socialist, communist and green parties won the poll, condemning Chirac to five years of cohabitation and political impotence.\n\nAfter the disaster of 1997, it was clear that Juppé needed to go away and reinvent himself.\n\nAside from the unpopularity of his planned pension reforms, his stint as prime minister also highlighted the fact that he lacked the human touch.\n\n“His intellectual faculties seemed inversely proportional to his social skills,” one commentator wrote.\n\nJuppé came across as brilliant but cold. A finely-calibrated calculating machine, rather than a man of the people. And apparently such criticisms were not new.\n\nIn the early 1970s Juppé’s fellow students at France’s fabled finishing school for bureaucrats, the Ecole Nationale de L’Administration, christened their classmate ‘Amstrad’, a reference to one of the era’s best-known makes of computer.\n\nWith the Right in opposition Juppé decided to devote himself to his duties as the mayor of Bordeaux, a post he had held concurrently with the prime ministership since 1995.\n\nHe still runs the south-western city and insists his involvement in local politics has helped him get back in touch with his human side.\n\n“What I have learned from running a city is that this job is made up as much from personal contacts, from discussions and from participation in local life as it is from taking decisions about dossiers,” he said recently.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether the new Juppé is really more cuddly and relaxed than his 1997 self.\n\n“He hasn’t changed all that much,” said one sceptical former minister recently. But it is undeniable that the ex-premier has made a huge effort to brush up his presentation skills. In the run-up to the presidential elections Juppé was an almost nightly fixture on\n\nFrench television.\n\nAnd far from coming across as rigid, he alternated between cheery bonhomie and political tub-thumping with apparent ease.\n\nHe even came up with one of the campaign’s most memorable and controversial sound bites. Questioned about the graft and kickback scandals still dogging Chirac, he accused the socialists of “shit stirring” for trying to include such issues in the pre-election debate.\n\nHis annoyance at the question also had a certain personal resonance as Juppé himself has been linked to some of the Chirac scandals.\n\nBut Juppé’s rising public profile ahead of, and particularly since, the two elections have also revealed his declarations about being content with life at the Bordeaux mairie to be somewhat hollow.\n\nNo one is under any illusions that Juppé’s ultimate ambition is to run for the presidency when Chirac’s term ends in 2007.\n\nThe incumbent has already made it clear that he will not stand for re-election then and that Juppé would be his favourite successor.\n\nThe decision to appoint Raffarin rather than the younger and fiercely ambitious Nicolas Sarkozy as the new prime minister also has Juppé’s fingerprints all over it. Sarkozy would almost certainly have used the Hôtel Matignon as a springboard for a presidential bid, but Raffarin has already made it clear he has no plans to run for the top job.\n\nJuppé was also one of the prime movers behind the efforts to unite France’s disparate right wing parties under the banner of the newly created Union Pour la Majorité Présidentiel (UMP).\n\nAfter the 1997 election defeat the French right was torn apart by political infighting and Juppé and Chirac both reached the conclusion that creating a single umbrella party would be the only way of ensuring their camp could remain a credible political force.\n\nSo far, the gamble seems to have paid off. Since the elections the UMP has had an iron grip on the French Parliament.\n\nAnd the new party also appointed its first president last month: a certain Alain Juppé.\n\nSuch meticulously planned political manoeuvring on so many fronts certainly suggests the old Amstrad Juppé has not vanished entirely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut be that as it may, France’s fickle electorate seems to have decided it likes the mayor of Bordeaux once again.\n\nThe man who not so long ago was the Fifth Republic’s least popular prime minister now scores some of the highest approval ratings of any of the country’s political big hitters.\n\nWhen it comes to European issues, Juppé is both well-known and respected in EU capitals.\n\nHis stints as both foreign minister and premier revealed an ability to play the EU horse-trading game with considerable skill and they were preceded by a spell as an MEP in the mid 1980s.\n\nJuppé’s European vision very much mirrors the line set out by both Chirac and former French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin over the past two years.\n\nHe favours the creation of a Europe of nation states, not a single federal state. He would like to see a clear European constitution and believes the EU should not enlarge beyond the continent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, as far as France’s EU policy goes, a Juppé presidency would not signal a major change of direction.\n\nWhen not working, the married father of three listens to classical music, reads and visits the cinema.\n\nHis aides insist he also tries to keep fit and jogs when he can.\n\nIn 1996 he said he did not want to stay in politics forever and that his dream would be to “live on a Greek island” or “go salmon fishing in Ireland”.\n\nBut that was eight years ago, when winning the keys to the Elysée Palace seemed unthinkable.\n\nToday one gets the impression that Juppé’s dreams involve the rather shorter trip from Bordeaux to number 55, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, Paris.\n\nAdvertisement"
