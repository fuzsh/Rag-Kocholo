        "text": "In recent days, his bid has been endorsed by several politicians normally seen as Chirac loyalists. These include Alain Juppe, a former prime minister, who praised Sarkozy’s “capacity for action”.\n\nChirac is not attending the congress, but Villepin made a brief appearance during the morning and shook hands with Sarkozy.\n\nAbout 78,000 supporters have been crammed into an exhibition centre on the Paris ring-road for the congress, with Edouard Balladur, another former prime minister, and other party elders delivering tributes to the new candidate.\n\nThe candidate plans to move quickly after receiving the support of the party.\n\nOn Monday, he will set up campaign headquarters in central Paris and then leave for Normandy on the first of regular twice-weekly speaking engagements in the provinces.\n\nThe first round of the presidential election takes place on April 22, with a second round two weeks later between the two front-runners if no candidate gets an overall majority."
