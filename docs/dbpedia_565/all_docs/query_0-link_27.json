        "text": "12 September 2018, Sydney, Australia\n\nIt was my holy day.\n\nA day of ritual.\n\nA day of sport.\n\nFour hours before designated kick-off my brother Chris would clomp around the house in his polished footy boots, ball under his arm.\n\nI’d be dressed in my green-and-gold tracksuit with my netball skirt over the top.\n\nI had a shiny tracksuit for every day of the week.\n\nAnd my parents wonder why I never married.\n\nI slept with a copy of Joyce Brown’s Netball the Australian Way under my pillow, hoping it would stimulate dreams of netball greatness that would rub off on me.\n\nAll my hopes and aspirations were linked to the netball court - for one hour every Saturday, that rectangle was my place of worship.\n\nEvery game was part of the grand plan. Part of what I thought was my destiny to represent the real green and gold.\n\n“You’re gonna play for Australia, Angie”, my brother would say.\n\n“I know”.\n\nIf I had to describe the look I’d say “Karate Kid in a pleated skirt”.\n\nI was nine and I was invincible.\n\nMany years later under the sandstone arches of the University of Adelaide, I discovered my other religion - feminism.\n\nMy eyes were opened to the power imbalance between women and men, and the ongoing fight for equal rights, opportunities and respect.\n\nI found my voice and started using it for things that really mattered: Reclaim The Night marches through the streets of Adelaide, speaking out against violence; energetically arguing against sexism, double standards and inequality.\n\nIt didn’t feel all that radical back then; it just felt right.\n\nHow could women not want equality, equal pay and opportunities, control over their own bodies, better work conditions, better access to childcare, a world without rape and sexual harassment, and the right to feel safe inside and outside of their homes?\n\nBy the time I left uni, I felt empowered.\n\nI wasn’t going to put up with sexism and double standards.\n\nI would call out inequality and misogyny at every opportunity, and make the world a better place.\n\nThen I landed in sport.\n\nWhere you can experience sexism, double standards, inequality and misogyny all before lunchtime.\n\nIt was 1997 - and some sports weren’t even aware of the existence of women.\n\nAs I say in my book - Breaking The Mould, Taking a Hammer to Sexism and Sport - if sport were a cake, the filling would be chest hair.\n\nI knew I was entering a male-dominated profession.\n\nIn the sporting “Game of Thrones” men hold sovereign power; they make the rules and call the shots.\n\nOver the years, my love of sport has been severely tested, and on more than one occasion I’ve felt like walking away.\n\nBut I never did.\n\nAnd I’m glad I stuck around because things are changing.\n\nI’ve spent 20 years of my life observing the Australian sporting landscape as a sports journalist, presenter and now documentary-maker.\n\nThat’s 20 years of seeing women athletes undervalued, underpaid and ignored.\n\n20 years of watching girls drop out of sport because there isn’t a pathway.\n\n20 years of invisible female role models.\n\n20 years of news editors telling me that no one cares about women’s sport.\n\n20 years of watching men with mediocre talent get all the good jobs. That’s personal.\n\n20 years of not always feeling like I belong.\n\nBut the Australian sporting landscape is changing.\n\nThe past three years have changed the conversation about women and sport.\n\nNo longer is the word ‘equality’ an afterthought.\n\nEquality has become central to the whole discussion.\n\nWhere it belongs.\n\nUntil now, it’s always been about the business case for change – the men in charge of sport have argued the business case for including women - when it should be the starting point.\n\nIn my book, I argue the moral case for equality and diversity is more compelling than the business case.\n\nGirls deserve the same opportunities and pathways as boys in sport. That should be our starting point.\n\nSo after 20 years, I can finally say the future is bright.\n\nClearer pathways are opening up for girls in sport - in a range of sports.\n\nFemale sporting role models are more visible.\n\nCricket, netball and the footy codes are creating a more competitive landscape for women and pushing all sports to do more for girls and women - facilities, pay, conditions, sponsorship, respect and recognition.\n\nIt’s no longer good enough to say “we want to be the sport of choice for girls and women” and do nothing - these sports actually have to do something.\n\nAnd if they don’t understand this is now a matter of equality they’re going to be left behind.\n\nThe train has well and truly left the station.\n\nI will briefly mention AFL Women’s here.\n\nI don’t think I’ve ever been brief about AFLW but I will try - it’s my favourite topic.\n\nAFLW is the most important thing to happen in sport in my lifetime.\n\nWhy?\n\nAustralian football is our indigenous game, our national game. It’s in our blood.\n\nFor a hundred years, writers, playwrights, filmmakers, poets and artists have depicted men in football – the embattled coaches, presidents, CEO’s, committeemen and the under-performing gun recruit – much-loved storylines that have shaped our sporting and cultural identity.\n\nAlan Hopgood, David Williamson, Bruce Dawe, Martin Flanagan – men telling stories about men.\n\nWomen have been excluded on and off the field, despite having a deep love for the game.\n\nA lot of us grew up kicking the footy in the street, the backyard and the local park - in my own little world boys existed for the sole purpose of kick to kick.\n\n(I sometimes think I should have stuck to that general rule).\n\nThe path to the AFLW has been a long one. Its players are, in many ways, modern day suffragists - brave women who stared down convention and won.\n\nDebbie Lee, Peta Searle, Lisa Hardeman and others, who fought for respect and a national competition long before it was fashionable to do so, were mocked, ridiculed and abused for fighting for equal rights.\n\nIt’s because of these brave women we now have an elite national competition – (you know that thing that men have had for ages?).\n\nThe AFLW Movement (and it is a movement) is changing society.\n\nIt sends the message to women and girls that it’s ok to play this game. It’s ok to be physical.\n\nIt says don’t get drawn into the feminine stereotype that’s been constructed for you - you can create your own version of what it means to be feminine, what it means to be a girl.\n\nSport is changing for the better.\n\nWe’re finally looking at both men and women and celebrating their differences.\n\nWomen’s sport is physically different to men’s but that doesn’t make it any less strategic or passionate – in fact, you could argue relying less on brute force puts more of an emphasis on tactics and strategy making it more of a spectacle.\n\nWe’re seeing less sexploitation of women athletes. This practice still goes on but it’s not as common as it was back in the old Matildas nude calendar days.\n\nAnd casual sexism is being called out and this is really important because we know there’s a link between casual sexism, which demeans women, and the sorts of attitudes that give rise to violence against women.\n\nBut please don't think for a moment we’ve made it.\n\nDespite the advances there’s still a way to go.\n\nWomen athletes are still striving for equal pay, they still don’t have access to the same opportunities and resources as their male counterparts. A sportswoman’s worth is still based on her attractiveness or sex appeal, sexist ‘jokes’ and ‘throwaway lines’ are still part of the landscape and women continue to be underrepresented in positions of power, including the media.\n\nSo how can the new sporting landscape help end violence against women?\n\nFirstly, sport is our national obsession.\n\nSport is accessible - it reaches boys, men, girls and women.\n\nAnd sport is at its best when it’s connected to something much bigger.\n\nThis is why it can drive positive change in attitudes and behaviours.\n\nThere is a huge body of respected research to show that gender inequality drives violence against women. That disrespect towards women and rigid gender stereotypes are key drivers of this unacceptable violence.\n\nSport is starting to understand the link between sexism and violence against women, and its using its power and influence to change the story.\n\nPrevention work is about far more than simply raising awareness and putting one woman in the board room or on a sports panel show.\n\nIt’s about changing culture, changing the rules by which we play, and changing the environments we operate in.\n\nIt’s about working hard to ensure a level playing field is a reality for players, staff members, volunteers, fans and anyone connected to the clubs.\n\nIt’s about extending the principles of equality and fairness beyond the field into the boardroom, the coach’s box, the stands, the change rooms, and the media.\n\nIt’s about sporting organisations setting the standard of zero tolerance for sexism, discrimination and violence against women.\n\nFor sports leaders and role models, it’s about stamping out sexism and inequality – setting the tone, and the example, for others to follow.\n\nIt’s about creating inclusive, equitable, healthy and safe environments for men and women, boys and girls.\n\nI can’t tell you how excited I was when I heard AFLW players speak out against the crappy idea of a 6-week regular season next year. As someone who watches cultural change in sport closely this was a significant shift. The players have found their voice, just as the mighty Matildas did in 2015 when they demanded better pay and respect.\n\nOr how excited I was when Richmond superstar Jack Riewoldt sat on stage at the season launch and spoke about re-defining masculinity. We would never have heard that 20, 10, 5 or even two years ago.\n\nOr how excited I was when jockey Michelle Payne told the doubters to get stuffed.\n\nThis is cultural change.\n\nWomen in sport can’t just sit back and wait for things to happen organically… because we know how that plays out for women.\n\nOrganic is good when it comes to fruit and vegetables… but when it comes to social change, organic doesn’t cut it.\n\nWe need action.\n\nWe need intervention.\n\nWe need acts of courage.\n\nWe need leadership.\n\nIt’s not the job of sport alone to end violence against women.\n\nBut sport provides a platform to promote women’s participation and opportunities, challenge gender stereotypes and roles and encourage respectful and equal relationships.\n\nIt has to be a team effort, and if we all work together, sport can help change the story that ends in violence against women.\n\nRest assured, I will keep going.\n\nI’m feeling invincible again.\n\nThank you\n\nTo donate to Our Watch,\n\nTo purchase Ang’s book, ‘Breaking the Mould’.\n\n7 June 2018, Melbourne Cricket Club, MCG, Melbourne, Australia\n\nIf you drive through the Tasmanian midlands from Launceston to Hobart, as you pass through a clump of houses called Cleveland, you will see, on the left, Joe Pike’s paddock. This is where my father saw his first games of football as a child in the years immediately following World War 1. My grandfather, a railway ganger who could write no more than his name, was the backbone of the Cleveland Football Club. These were the years before electricity, before radio, and so my father’s earliest football memories were sitting around at night listening to his father and older brothers talk about the difficulty of getting a team because so many of the local lads had died at Gallipoli or on the Western Front. But when Cleveland got a team together, they played in Joe Pike’s paddock. So that’s where it starts for me, what I like to call my footy dreaming.\n\nCleveland had something else. It had the memory of a champion. George Challis was a mathematics teacher who played football on the wing and was renowned for his speed and accurate passing. Challis had been one of Tasmania’s best at the national carnival of 1911, and one of Carlton’s best in the 1915 grand final when they overcame Collingwood. Within 12 months, Sergeant George Challis was blown to pieces in France. Nothing whatsoever of him remained but a large gravestone stands in his memory in the small churchyard opposite Joe Pike’s paddock. What have I got from football? Memories, lots of them.\n\nIn the aftermath of World War 1, a young returned solder who had been gassed and wounded and lost two brothers in the slaughter took up land outside Latrobe on Tasmania’s north west coast. My grandfather Patrick Flanagan followed Latrobe, having lived in the district since he was a boy. The story my grandfather told was that one day the returned soldier turned up at the cattle sales and had a kick with some of the local blokes and was persuaded to have a game with Latrobe. His name was Ivor Warne-Smith. He would later win two Brownlow medals with Melbourne and, as chairman of selectors, be the power behind the throne during the 1950s and ‘60s when Norm Smith’s Melbourne side won five premierships.\n\nMy grandfather only went to Hobart once in his life. That was to see Warne Smith lead the North West Football Union against the hated TFL, the Hobart-based association that thought it was the VFL and sought to rule accordingly. Warne Smith was injured early and the Union lost - or that was how the story came down to me 60 years later. That’s a long time for a story to travel, but something about the Australian game, some innate power it possesses, has been able to propel stories with rare power. That is also the reason why the pre-match entertainment before the Dreamtime at the G game may be the most powerful message Aboriginal Australia sends non-Aboriginal Australia this year.\n\nMy mother’s family, the Learies, were farmers in the green hills up behind Devonport. They were musical people but they had footy stories, too. Before World War 1, when a 20-year-old member of the clan lay dying from what was then called a leaking heart, his brother went to the grand final between Ulverstone and Devonport with two carrier pigeons, one to send home a score at half-time, the other to send home a score at the end of the game.\n\nMy father, who was born in 1914, said that when he was a boy Victorian football results were just a paragraph in the Tasmanian papers. Everyone followed Tasmanian football. The biggest club in his world as a child was Campbell Town, 20 kilometres to Cleveland’s south. All his life Dad followed Tasmanian football. He never went to a single AFL or VFL game. I always said he didn’t barrack for an AFL team but when the Swans surged to that great premiership victory in 2005 I was amazed to find he wanted them to win. Why? Because of Laurie Nash.\n\nDad left Launceston High School just as the Great Depression hit. He later survived the war-time atrocity remembered as the Burma Railway, but he said that in some ways the Great Depression was worse. In the Great Depression, he said, “you saw whole families go under”. One of the few bright spots in that bleak reality was Laurie Nash. If the word genius can be applied to sport, it could probably be used in relation to Nash. He would open the bowling for Australia and offer to bowl bouncers back at Douglas Jardine’s English team during the Bodyline crisis. In Launceston football, he played for the City club under captain-coach Roy Cazaly. There were State premiers in 1930 and ’32 - in 1933, he joined South Melbourne, playing centre-half back against the wind and centre-half forward with it, and was a member of the Swans’ famous Foreign Legion premiership team of that year.\n\nThe City club, now called South Launceston, can trace its heritage back to the 1870s through the Cornwall club. In 2013, the AFL ushered South Launceston from the Statewide league and replaced them with a so-called “franchise” – the franchise folded within two years. In the same year, the AFL foisted a name change upon the North Hobart Football Club which can date its heritage back to 1881. A club which had made a cumulative profit of $300,000 in the preceding 10 years made a loss of $100,000 over the next four years, lost three quarters of its paying members and was headed, like the Tasmanian tiger, for extinction until, last year, when a group of determined North Hobart people won back control of their club. They now have no debt and some of the best juniors in the State. Go North!\n\nPeople ask me who I barrack for - I barrack for the game. An American who lived in this city for some years once wrote me a letter which began: “You seem an intelligent man. Why do you write so much about football?”. Because it’s the culture I’m from. Footy’s a language I can speak. I also happen to believe Australian football is, by world standards, a great game – that it is, in fact, Australia’s great athletic invention. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the creator of Victorian detective Sherlock Holmes, watched the 1920 VFL grand final between Collingwood and Richmond and declared that the Australian game was the most athletic of all the football codes. It is a game of courage and daring, of strength and physical grace. I was enchanted when I discovered it as an 11-year-old growing up in Burnie on Tasmania’s north-west coast. Five of the boys I played with or against went onto to play in the VFL/AFL. Between them, the two Burnie clubs. Burnie and Cooee, easily won the bulk of the premierships in that third of the island. I was therefore shocked to learn earlier this year that, unable to field a team, Burnie had followed Devonport in withdrawing from the Tasmanian Statewide League.\n\nPopular sports like Australian rules football are constantly re-born in the eyes of children – in my case, between the ages of 11 and 13. I was 11 when the game captivated me. I was 12 when I listened – on a plastic transistor held against a steel girder to better the reception – to the classic 1967 grand final between Geelong and Richmond. That same year, I also saw the Tasmanian State final between North Hobart and Wynyard which ended with the goal posts being pulled down by Wynyard supporters to prevent North Hobart full forward Dicky Collins shooting for goal, Wynyard supports having judged that he marked the ball after the siren. When I spoke earlier this year at a function in Hobart celebrating the re-birth of the North Hobart Football Club, Dicky Collins attended and brought the ball – the ball he was holding when the goalposts were pulled down. The umpire, a man with the marvellously symbolic name of Pilgrim, never got to blow his whistle to end the match. The game is still being played, I like to say, out in the football dreamtime....\n\nI have to thank football for the stories it has given me. Hundreds if not thousands of them. Here are a few that come to mind. Liam Jurrah. I say in all seriousness that it is doubtful that ay professional sportsman playing in a major league anywhere in the world vaulted a bigger cultural gap than Liam Jurrah did to play AFL football. He may also come to be seen in the history of the game as Albert Namatjira as seen in the history of Australian art. My second story would be the Israeli-Palestinian AFL Peace Team. What was so moving about the Peace Team was that, through the medium of Australian football, two of the most conflicted groups on earth actually bought into the idea that they were one. The Israeli assault on Gaza in 2014 eventually tore them apart but, even so, one of the Israelis bravely continued the work. And, thirdly, in Tom Wills I found a character who is to me, like Ned Kelly, a figure who straddles a fault-line in the national psyche, who is best understood in the way that earthquakes are understood, the product of vast forces, mostly unseen, that suddenly erupt through an individual who may only be partially aware of what’s going on. Tom Wills, like Ned Kelly, is a big story in the continuing drama of what it means to be Australian. My fourth story is driving from Melbourne to Darwin with Michael Long, crossing this great land of ours from south to north with someone who was known every time he stepped out of the car. My fifth is the Bulldogs coming from nowhere to win in 2016. I could go on....and on....and on...\n\nI knew Tasmanian football in Tasmania was in serious trouble four years ago when I went to Hobart and the sports report on the evening news led with soccer – not EPL or A league but local soccer. Tasmanian soccer had replaced Tasmanian football as the dominant sporting story. This is not unrelated, I believe, to the fact that Tasmania has had only a single draft pick in the past two years. The power of Tasmanian football as a dreaming is much diminished. Four years ago, when I started asking around, I found to my disbelief that the Tasmanian Statewide League had been unable to secure a financial sponsor. Clubs were struggling to get sponsors for individual players. This was at a time when, back here in Melbourne, the AFL was congratulating itself on the fact it had secured a record sum for broadcasting rights to the game. How, I asked, could this be happening at the one time, such extremes of poverty and wealth within the one game, the one culture?\n\nThe answer is that the game has evolved into two very different cultures. Those at the top talk in terms of branding and product and market share, the language of corporate culture. The culture at the bottom was best described by Glenorchy Football Club president John McCann when he said two years ago that the ecosystem of Tasmanian football was sick. He was right on two counts - he was right that it was sick, and he was right that the grassroots game, that growth of more than 150 years, is best understood as an eco-system. The AFL and those around them talk about “the industry”. If football is an industry, it is at the most basic level a primary industry, but everywhere I go in Australia, I hear the same – that industry is struggling. And so tonight in moving this toast, can I say to all those who love the game and particularly to those who are responsible for its future – Ignore Grassroots Football At Your Peril.\n\nTo the Australian game!\n\nThank you very much. Thank you Richie (Dick Ebersol), long time friend. I had a lot to say but that (Antonio) Inoki guy (who spoke in Japanese) said the same stuff I was going to say. I was back there saying, ‘What’s he doing? He stole my stuff.’\n\nAnyway, I wasn’t always a great player. People say, ‘You can talk the way you do because you were always a great ballplayer.’ Well, I wasn’t. Signed for a very modest $3000 bonus with the Braves. Which aggravated my old man because he didn’t have that kind of money to put out. But the Braves took it. And from there, I went on, was with the Braves twice actually. they didn’t believe I was as bad the first time, the second time I proved it . St Louis Cardinals where I showed up for every game, which i think showed great team spirit. And those I didn’t show up for I always tried to catch on the radio.\n\nI played for the St. Louis Cardinals, where I won a world championship in 1964. Bing Devine was the general manager of the Cardinals at that time. He asked me to do him a favor that would really help the club. I said, ‘Sure, I’m a team guy.’ He said, ‘We want to inject you with hepatitis. That will allow us to call somebody up to take your spot.’ I said, ‘Can I sit on the bench?’ He said, ‘Yeah, we’ll put a plastic thing around you. Maybe you can go over and shake hands with some of the Yankee players and infect them.’ We went on to win the World Championship that year.\n\nActually, the first sport I tried when I was a youngster was football. My dad didn’t know a lot about sports but he wanted me to do what all the other kids were doing. He gets me this football. We were passing it and trying to kick it. I couldn’t throw it. He can’t throw it. We were really getting aggravated and stuff like that. Then a nice-enough neighbor came over and put some air in it, and it made a huge difference.\n\nActually, I took an interest in wrestling, in high school. I wasn’t a very big guy. I was about 5-11. I weighed, I don’t know, maybe 75, 80 pounds. A couple guys used to wear my supporter as a wristband. I came from a family that didn’t have a lot of money. My mother made my supporter out of a flour sack. Little specks of flower came dropping out of it. In the front, it said ‘Pillsbury’s Best.’\n\nTonight, I wore my Hall of Fame ring from wrestling. They gave everybody one from the WWE, thank you very much. All the other wrestlers got a diamond. I got a zircon. And theirs is not adjustable like mine. At the awarding of the championship rings the following year, that’s what every player’s dream is, a world championship. I remember opening night in St. Louis, 1965, they’re presenting the rings and they threw mine out in left field. I found it and put it on. Nobody else got theirs thrown. They had to hand it to them (shrugs).\n\nI set a lot of records. I never stole a base in the major leagues. I never attempted to steal a base in the major leagues. I showed up for every game, which I thought showed great team spirit. The ones I didn’t show up for, I always tried to catch on the radio.\n\nMeeting (NBC Sports and Entertainment Chairman) Dick Ebersol a long time ago. Midnight Special. Saturday Night Live. All those shows through Richie I participated in. When he called me about wrestling, I didn’t really want to do it. I was doing baseball Spring training was when Wrestlemania III was going to take place in Detroit. I kept telling him no but he came out there and we finally agreed to do it, and it was one of the best things I’ve ever done in my life.\n\nI remember going to Los Angeles to do the promotion stuff. It was Hulk Hogan, (Andre) the Giant, (Bobby) the Brain (Heenan), Jake ‘The Snake’ Roberts, who coincidentally said, ‘Uke, why don’t you take a picture with Damian?’ I said, ‘Who’s Damian.’ He said, ‘He’s in the bag.’ I said, ‘So am I. Give me a couple more beers.’ So he took the snake out and I put him around me. He said, ‘Don’t worry. He’s big and he's strong.’ He got his tail around my leg and I’m holding him and I’m looking at Jake and he’s got this huge scar right here (on his chest). I said, ‘What is that?’ He said, ‘That’s where Damian bit me.’ I said, ‘Oh, what a great time that must be. I hope he bites me, too.’\n\nI remember the one thing with Jake with Donald Trump’s wife, Ivana. He put that snake down at her feet and she left Wrestlemania so fast, she just left Donald there and she ain't seen him since, I guess.\n\nWe did the promotional stuff. I got to work with Mary Hart. Beautiful lady, great sport and all that. When we go to Detroit to do the show, I’m having the time of my life. And when the Giant came out and choked me, and let me go, I didn’t know he was going to do that. I really didn’t. I was supposed to talk about Vanna White. He didn’t care about Vanna White. He wanted to kill somebody. When he choked me and let me go, now if the camera stays on, you see me on top of Andre. Oh yeah. Vince McMahon was screaming, ‘Get off him. He’s got a match.’ I got him in a step-over toe hold, I don’t really know what it was. It wasn’t all Andre. I remember later on, when I was changing underwear (laughter)… I wasn't going to let that guy get away with that.\n\nAs I said earlier, some of the greatest times I’ve had in sports, entertainment, anything else, was to be around Richie, Vince McMahon and all these wrestling greats. The old-timers back there, back when I wrestled, I think got more interested in wrestling, when I was 8 or 9 years old, my mother started taking in wrestler’s laundry to make a couple extra bucks. I remember taking Dick ‘The Bruiser’s’ tights and putting them on. They were tight, nice. He came in the booth one day. I was doing play by play, imitating Dick ‘The Bruiser.’ (Gruff voice) Swing and a miss, struck him out. One day he came in and said, ‘Let’s see if you think you’re funny now.’ He was a football player with the Green Bay Packers, Dick ‘The Bruiser.’ All the wrestlers that came to Milwaukee in those years wrestled at the (indistinguishable) Hall. I started becoming a wrestling fan. I got a kick out of that. I still do today. Unbelievably strong, athletic. It reminds me of myself when I was younger.\n\nWhen I look back, I was a right-handed-hitting, strikeout artist. Sooner or later, I was going to hit .200. It tied me with another sports great, Don Carter, one of our top bowlers. To have been a member of baseball team, to broadcast baseball today, to mess around with television shows and movies and all of this stuff, and tonight especially to be here with you. When I walked in here tonight and looked around, I said, ‘Man, this pace is jam packed.’ I know it will be tomorrow, too, for Wrestlemania. I'll be there, too.\n\nAnyway, I wanted to thank you for your time tonight and patience. To all the members of the WWE, like I said before, great athletes, unbelievable entertainment. I don’t know how you guys do it, I really don’t All the body punches you take. That’s why I didn’t want to play and get hurt. Getting a hit once a month was OK. Hitting .200, that was OK. If you did more, they’d expect more of you. One hit a year, let’s leave it at that. Anyway, thank you very much for your time. Thank you.\"\n\n27 July 2003, Cooperstown, New York, USA\n\nThank you, Joe, thank you very much. And thank you ladies and gentlemen. And my congratulations to Hal (McCoy / winner of the J.G. Taylor Spink Award in 2003), Gary Carter, Eddie Murray, and to all of the members of the staff of the Hall of Fame, thank you very much. This has been a wonderful, wonderful time.\n\nI, in deference to Hal McCoy, was asked to quit many times.\n\nI was born and raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Actually, I was born in Illinois. My mother and father were on an oleo margarine run to Chicago back in 1934, because we couldn't get colored margarine in Wisconsin. On the way home, my mother was with child. Me. And the pains started, and my dad pulled off into an exit area, and that's where the event took place. I remember it was a nativity type setting. An exit light shining down. There were three truck drivers there. One guy was carrying butter, one guy had frankfurters, and the other guy was a retired baseball scout who told my folks that I probably had a chance to play somewhere down the line.\n\nI remember it being very cold. It was January. I didn't weigh very much. I think the birth certificate said something like ten ounces. I was very small. And I remember the coldness on my back from the asphalt. And I was immediately wrapped in swaddling clothes and put in the back of a '37 Chevy without a heater. And that was the start of this Cinderella story that you are hearing today.\n\nI did not have a lot of ability as a kid, and my dad wanted me to have everything that everybody else had. I think the first thing that he ever bought me was a football. And I was very young. He didn't know a lot about it, he came from the old country. I mean, we tried to pass it and throw it and kick it, and we couldn't do it. And it was very discouraging for him and for me. Almost, we almost quit. And finally we had a nice enough neighbor, came over and put some air in it, and what a difference.\n\nI got a lot of my ability from my father. As a lot of these other guys did. My father actually came to this country as a soccer player. He didn't play, be blew up the balls is what he did. And they didn't have pumps in those days. And to see a man put that valve in his mouth and insert it into a soccer ball, and blow thirty pounds of air. And then have the ability to pull that thing out without it fracturing the back of his mouth was unbelievable. You had to see his neck and his veins popping. It was unbelievable. How proud I was as I watched him do it time after time.\n\nMy first sport was eighth grade basketball. And my dad didn't want to buy me the supporter johnny, you know, to do the job. So my mother made me one out of a flour sack. And the tough thing about that is, you put that thing on, you whip it out of your bag in the gym. You know all the guys are looking at it. And you start the game. The guy guarding you knows exactly where you're going since little specks of flour keep dropping out. And then right down the front it says 'Pillsbury's Best.'\n\nI signed a very modest $3,000 bonus with the Braves in Milwaukee, which I'm sure a lot of you know. And my old man didn't have that kind of money to put out. But the Braves took it. I remember sitting around our kitchen table counting all this money, coins out of jars, and I'm telling my dad, 'Forget this, I don't want to play.' He said, 'No, you are going to play baseball. We are going to have you make some money, and we're going to live real good.' My dad had an accent, I want to be real authentic when I'm doing this thing. So I signed. The signing took place at a very popular restaurant in Milwaukee. And I remember driving, and my dad's all fired up and nervous, and I said, 'Look, it will be over in a couple of minutes. Don't be uptight.' We pull in the parking lot, pull next to the Braves automobile, and my dad screwed up right away. He doesn't have the window rolled up far enough and our tray falls off and all the food is on the floor. And from there on it was baseball.\n\nStarting with the Braves in Milwaukee, St. Louis, where I won the World's Championship for them in 1964, to the Philadelphia Phillies and back to the Braves in Atlanta, where I became Phil Niekro's personal chaser. But during every player's career there comes a time when you know that your services are no longer required, that you might be moving on. Traded, sold, released ,whatever it may be. And having been with four clubs, I picked up a few of these tips. I remember Gene Mauch doing things to me at Philadelphia. I'd be sitting there and he'd say, 'Grab a bat and stop this rally.' Send me up there without a bat and tell me to try for a walk. Look down at the first base coach for a sign and have him turn his back on you.\n\nBut you know what? Things like that never bothered me. I'd set records that will never be equaled, 90% I hope are never printed: .200 lifetime batting average in the major leagues which tied me with another sports great averaging 200 or better for a ten-year period, Don Carter, one of our top bowlers.\n\nIn 1967 I set a major league record for passed balls, and I did that without playing every game. There was a game, as a matter of fact, during that year when Phil Niekro's brother (Joe) and he were pitching against each other in Atlanta. Their parents were sitting right behind home plate. I saw their folks that day more than they did the whole weekend.\n\nBut with people like Niekro, and this was another thing, I found the easy way out to catch a knuckleball. It was to wait until it stopped rolling and then pick it up. There were a lot of things that aggravated me, too. My family is here today. My boys, my girls. My kids used to do things that aggravate me, too. I'd take them to the game and they'd want to come home with a different player. I remember one of my friends came to Atlanta to see me once. He came to the door, he says, 'Does Bob Uecker live here?' He says, 'Yeah, bring him in.' But my two boys are just like me. In their championship little league game, one of them struck out three times and the other one had an error that allowed the winning run to score. They lost the championship, and I couldn't have been more proud. I remember the people as we walked through the parking lot throwing eggs and rotten stuff at our car. What a beautiful day.\n\nYou know, everybody remembers their first game in the major leagues. For me it was in Milwaukee. My hometown, born and raised there, and I can remember walking out on the field and Birdie Tebbetts was our manager at that time. And my family was there: my mother and dad, and all my relatives. And as I'm standing on the field, everybody's pointing at me and waving and laughing, and I'm pointing back. And Birdie Tebbetts came up and asked me if I was nervous or uptight about the game. And I said, 'I'm not. I've been waiting five years to get here. I'm ready to go.'\n\nHe said, 'Well, we're gonna start you today. I didn't want to tell you earlier. I didn't want you to get too fired up.'\n\nI said, 'Look, I'm ready to go.'\n\nHe said, 'Well, great, you're in there. And oh, by the by, the rest of us up here wear that supporter on the inside.' That was the first game my folks walked out on, too.\n\nBut you know, of all of the things that I've done, this has always been number one, baseball. The commercials, the films, the television series, I could never wait for everything to get over to get back to baseball. I still, and this is not sour grapes by any means, still think I should have gone in as a player. Thank you very much.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding. No, this conglomeration of greats that are here today, a lot of them were teammates, but they won't admit it. But they were. And a lot of them were players that worked in games that I called. They are wonderful friends, and always will be. And the 1964 World's Championship team. The great Lou Brock. And I remember as we got down near World Series time, Bing Devine, who was the Cardinals' general manager at that time, asked me if I would do him and the Cardinals, in general, a favor. And I said I would. And he said, 'We'd like to inject you with hepatitis. We need to bring an infielder up.' I said, 'Would I be able to sit on the bench.' He said, 'Yes, we'll build a plastic cubicle for you because it is an infectious disease.' And I've got to tell you this. I have a photo at home, I turned a beautiful color yellow and with that Cardinal white uniform. I was knocked out. It was beautiful, wasn't it, Lou? It was great.\n\nOf course, any championship involves a World Series. The ring, the ceremony, the following season in St. Louis at old Busch Stadium. We were standing along the sideline. I was in the bullpen warming up the pitcher. And when they called my name for the ring, it's something that you never ever forget. And when they threw it out into left field. I found it in the fifth inning, I think it was, Lou, wasn't it? And once I spotted it in the grass man, I was on it. It was unbelievable.\n\nBut as these players have bats, gloves…I had a great shoe contract and glove contract with a company who paid me a lot of money never to be seen using their stuff. Bat orders…I would order a dozen bats and there were times they'd come back with handles at each end. You know, people have asked me a lot of times, because I didn't hit a lot, we all know that, how long a dozen bats would last me? Depending on the weight and the model that I was using at that particular time I would say eight to ten cookouts.\n\nI once ordered a dozen flame-treated bats, and they sent me a box of ashes, so I knew at that time things were moving on. But there are tips that you pick up when the Braves were going to release me. It is a tough time for a manager, for your family, for the player to be told that you're never going to play the game again. And I can remember walking in the clubhouse that day, and Luman Harris, who was the Braves' manager, came up to me and said there were no visitors allowed. So again, I knew I might be moving on.\n\nPaul Richards was the general manager and told me the Braves wanted to make me a coach for the following season. And that I would be coaching second base. So again, gone.\n\nBut that's when the baseball career started as a broadcaster. I remember working first with Milo Hamilton and Ernie Johnson. And I was all fired up about that, too, until I found out that my portion of the broadcast was being used to jam Radio Free Europe. And I picked up a microphone one day and my mic had no cord on it, so I was talking to nobody. But it's such a wonderful, wonderful thing today to be here. And one of my first partners was mentioned earlier, Merle Harmon, and Tom Collins, he's here today. All of those who I have worked with from Merle to Lorn Brown to Dwayne Mosley, Pat Hughes, who now works for the Chicago Cubs, and my current partner today, Jim Powell and Kent Summerfeld. My thanks to all of you.\n\nTo my good pal Bob Costas out there. Thank you, Bobby. All of the network people, that has been as much a part of broadcasting for me as anything. The days with ABC and 'Monday Night Baseball' with the late Bob Prince and Keith Jackson and Al Michaels and my great pal, Don Drysdale. All of those people have played such a big part in me being here today. Dick Ebersol, the head of NBC Sports. All of them are a big part of what I am. My family is seated over here. I love them very much.\n\nUlice Payne is here, the president of the Brewers. The commissioner of baseball is a guy that gave me my start. He said, 'I want to bring you back to Milwaukee.' And I said, 'I'll come.' And here I am, 33 years later. Thank you, Al. I call him Al, Bud Selig. Wife Sue is here. To all of my Brewer family, Wendy, Laurel Selig… Wendy Selig-Prieb, Laurel Prieb. Tony Migliaccio, one of my great friends. Mike LaBoe, all my people. Jon Greenberg, I didn't even know you were here. You took care of Hal McCoy, what the hell's going on. But all of these people play such a big part in all of our lives.\n\nAnd to all of you baseball fans around America and any place else, for your letters, your thoughts, your kindness, for all of these years, it's been a great run, but number one has always been baseball for me. No matter what else I ever did, baseball was the only way I wanted to go. I thank you very much for your attention today, thank you for having me, and congratulations to everybody here. Thank you very much everybody, thank you.\n\n14 October 2016, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne, Australia\n\nOpening oration at Sports Writers Festival. Tim Cahill features at Melbourne Town Hall tonight (18 October, 8pm) Tickets.\n\nSPORT & POLITICS: THE ADAM GOODES CASE RE-CONSIDERED, ONE YEAR ON.\n\nfor Doug Vickers\n\n1.\n\nIn the 19th century, Karl Marx famously declared that religion was the opiate of the people.\n\nIn the 21st century, it seems fair to ask - is sport the opiate of the people? Is sport the Great Distraction?\n\nThe poet TS Eliot said “humankind cannot bear too much reality”. I happen to believe that’s true. Is sport now the principal means by which many of us insulate ourselves from reality? I think the answer to that is probably yes.\n\nSomeone once said that sport is the most important thing in the world that doesn’t matter. At one level, I agree - but at the same time I never forget Nelson Mandela saying that sport has more power than governments to change social attitudes. That is true also.\n\nFurthermore, sport has the power to illuminate aspects of our society and our social past that otherwise remain hidden.\n\nMy point is that sport - by which I mean popular sports that attract mass audiences - swing or pivoton a series of paradoxes so that often, in public arguments arising from sport, when others are absolute in their opinions, I find myself thinking. “Yes, but….”\n\n2.\n\nPeople have suggested thetheme I should address today is “Should sport ever be political?” I am tempted to reply – is sport ever not political? It’s the story behind the creation of the modern Olympics. It’s the story behind the 1936 Olympics in Hitler’s Berlin. It’s the story behind the State-sanctioned systematic doping instituted by Vladimir Putin’s regime in Russia and the turmoil since that was discovered, both the banning of Russian Olympians and Paralympians from the Rio Games and the subsequent hacking and release of the medical records of athletes who did compete. These are dark disturbing stories but the special magic of sport is that it also throws up bright, uplifting stories, too.\n\nOne of the best sports stories of my adult lifetime was the 1995 Rugby Union World Cup final between South Africa and New Zealand played in South Africa just at the time when people on the political extremes in that country were on the verge of initiating a full-on civil war. That story is expertly told in “Playing the Enemy” by John Carlin, one of my half dozen favourite books on sport. It was in John Carlin’s book that I found Mandela’s quote that sport has more power than governments to change social attitudes. Who am I – who is any one among us? – to argue with Nelson Mandela on that score?\n\nBut just as the theme of politics and sport is universal, it also has to be understood locally. Right now in Melbourne, as Eddie McGuire found out to his cost, you’d be a fool if you thought the views of women don’t matter in footy debates. Personally, in seeking to balance the views of the two sexes, I like the Aboriginal idea of men’s law and women’s law. That is, there are two ways of seeing the world, two separate codes. They are not identical, but they have certain assumptions in common and need to co-exist. In Australian football, this gets complicated since when I say I’m talking about football I usually mean men’s football. There is now also women’s football. And men’s football, throughout the length and breadth of the land, is hugely dependent upon the women working as volunteers around the clubs and not merely selling pies and cordial - as presidents, board members, commission members, secretaries, treasurers….. It’s a political fact that Australian football has to listen to the voices of women if it wants to have a future.\n\nIn 2000, a Dutch journalist writing a book on the great sporting events of the world attended the AFL grand final and tracked me down to ask two questions. This was one of them: “The average percentage of women at premier league soccer matches in Europe is 13 per cent. With your game, it is 48 per cent. Why?” My answer is that women always seem to have been a big part of the game. The reason for this, I think, is that during the game’s adolescence, the period between 1858 and 1880, Australian football was basically free entertainment in the parks. Among the crowd which circled these games, there was neither a Members’ pavilion nor a ladies Pavilion. No-one could be prevented from attending since there no fences, everyone mixed as one.\n\nThe best account of an early match was provided by an English journalist who merely signed himself as the Vagabond. He saw Carlton play Melbourne at the Carlton ground in 1879. He describes the women he sees in the crowd, the lack of distinction between men and women, and between people of different religions and class. The Vagabond judged the game to be unruly and violent. He ultimately asked if it was to the detriment of civilized values and concluded that it was, thereby giving expression to an idea which has never really gone away and regularly re-surfaces, particularly during controversies about player behaviour.\n\nSocial and political debates conducted through the medium of sport are like historical stews. Sport is like a mask that people can hide behind and sound off so that many of the views that are expressed contain prejudices against women, prejudices against men, class prejudices, racial prejudices and prejudices against sport itself. One of the most radical and refreshing changes of our time has been young women flooding into sports that were previously regarded by some as the embodiment of male aggression and violence. If anyone wants further evidence of continued change in the culture of Australian football, it was surely Jobe Watson returning to Essendon after a year of exile and introspection in a cap with theword FEMINIST written on it.\n\nBecause sport is in everyone’s face all the time in this culture, everyone thinks they know about it. Often, people who don’t like sport have opinions on sport which, when boiled down, come back to the fact that they don’t like Sam Newman or Shane Warne or some other cartoon character from the world of tabloid media, or they don’t like the fact that the endless shows on radio and television given to analysing sport serve to prevent people considering everything else that’s happening in the world. Well, yes, it’s hard to argue with that. But, as I said before, it is also true that sport can be socially illuminating. An example of this can be seen right now on the walls of the Ian Potter Gallery in Carlton. Put together by Melbourne artist Grant Hobson, the exhibition is about the Koonibba Football Club, the oldest surviving Aboriginal football club in Australia.\n\nCentral to the exhibition are 11 black-and-white portraits taken in 1939 at Koonibba, on South Australia’s Eyre Peninsula, as part of an investigation mounted by the Adelaide and Harvard universities. During the 1930s, there were intense discussions among academics, politicians and civil servants about what to do with Aboriginal people of mixed race or what was then called the \"half-caste problem\". Proposed solutions included eugenics or what was then termed \"breeding out the colour\". The 1939 photographs taken at Koonibba were like mugshots, the subjects being photographed from the front and side-on. The notes with the portraits, which artist Grant Hobson and a Koonibba elder found in the archives of the Adelaide museum, contained skull and facial measurements plus descriptions of skin and eye colours. If you track the history of the ideas of racial superiority underlying the 1939 expedition back into the 19th century, you’ll find they mutated with Darwin’s theory of evolution to produce the notion that there was a missing link between apes and human beings. Aboriginal people were portrayed as “the missing link”. The strength and durability of this idea was displayed this year when a young woman, a Port Adelaide supporter, threw a banana at Eddie Betts.\n\nHowever, what the self-styled “scientists” from Harvard and Adelaide universities didn’t appear to note when they visited Koonibba was that, beneath their threadbare clothing, nine of the 11 men they photographed were wearing Koonibba football guernseys. These were members of one of Koonibba’s most successful teams ever, remembered to this day as the Koonibba Invincibles. Famous AFL names associated with the Koonibba Football Club are Burgoyne, Betts and Wanganeen. Aaron Davey (Melbourne) and Alwyn Davey (Essendon) are grandsons of Koonibba’s Dick Davey. Daniel Wells (North Melbourne & Collingwood) and Graeme Johncock (Adelaide) are connected to Koonibba. Put simply, I would not have learned the Koonibba story, if it were not for sport. There is so much about my country I wouldn’t know, if it were not for sport. There is so much about the world I would not know, were it not for sport.\n\n3.\n\nI now want to move to the biggest political issue in Australian football in recent times – the Adam Goodes affair of 2015. Before I do so, however, I want to make a few observations about contemporary politics. This is an age in which people are losing faith in democratic politics. This happened before, in the 1930s, most disastrously in Germany. Our belief in democracy being able to produce suitable social ends is being questioned by people on both the left and right. Into this state of political paralysis walks sport with its ready-made mass audience and its central place in to the entertainment industry.\n\nSport ideally is not about politics but in this culture sport provides one of the simplest and quickest ways of making a political point. What this gives rise to are debates about sport which are not really about sport, or are about sport and so much more. Outside football, non-Aboriginal Australians – and by that I specifically mean non-Aboriginal Australians of all races, colours and creeds - display little active interest in Aboriginal Australia. We all know this to be true – it’s our secret shame. It’s in this atmosphere that Adam Goodes gets called a monkey. It’s in this atmosphere that he points to a 13-year-old girl – by his own account, reacting to the voice, not knowing she is 13 – and she is marched from the stadium. After weeks of being booed, Goodes does a war dance and throws an imaginary spear into the crowd…. .\n\nThe main article I wrote about the Adam Goodes affair was actually about Chris Lewis, the last Aboriginal player to be booed as vehemently – in fact, far more vehemently – than Goodes was. In 1991, as West Coast built to its first ever premiership, Lewis established himself as one of the most promising young players in the competition. The following season, he copped full-on old-style racism and fought back – literally. He got the reputation of being a “dirty” player but his side of the case, his defence, wasn’t being put. He became the game’s outlaw. Its black outlaw. I defended him – the only journalist, as I recall, to do so – and we have maintained a relationship ever since. Chris Lewis has a warrior spirit but he told me when he was 21 that he’d “meet anyone half-way” and his life shows that he has been true to this belief. He has plenty of reasons to be racist, but isn’t. That, I thought, was the point of the article but you wouldn’t have known it from the responses I got. In fact, I don’t remember a single response – and there were a lot - which dealt with what I thought the article was about.\n\nI was sent racist abuse about Chris Lewis which was unchanged from what was said about him in the early 1990s. I had expected that. It was the other responses I hadn’t expected. For example, an Indian gentleman contacted me, demanding Adam Goodes’ mobile number. I had written a story on the Indian gentleman’s guru when she visited Australia some years earlier; he had been deeply impressed by the fact that I had accurately reported what she was saying about how to control our lives with positive thinking. He now advised me that, if he had Goodes’ number and the number of a senior figure in the Swans’ administration, he would advise them how to cure the problem with positive thinking.\n\nI didn’t have Adam Goodes’ number and I would not have handed it out without his permission. Under the circumstances, my chances of getting that permission would have been nil. In the wake of my failure to provide him with Adam Goodes’ number, the Indian gentleman contacted me again saying that I should look deep into my heart and examine the racist feelings I harboured towards Aboriginal people. Why did the Indian gentleman deduce that I possessed racist feelings towards Aboriginal people? Because I had failed to give him Adam Goodes’ number so that he could solve the problem – or so he thought - with positive thinking.\n\nAnother reader – an articulate young man who was an avid Swans and Adam Goodes fan - wrote in accusing me of trying to create a historical scenario in which Michael Long was “the good guy” and Adam Goodes was “the bad guy”. I had tried to make the point that Adam Goodes represented something different, something new, at least to non-Aboriginal Australians. I’d just spent 13 years trying to writing a book with Michael Long, trying to see his story as he did and not as whitefellas do. In race politics, things are always changing. I said Michael Long was like Martin Luther King, Adam Goodes was like Malcolm X. I didn’t say Malcolm X was a bad guy, I didn’t say Michael Long was a good guy. But between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X there is, or was, a difference.\n\nAnd Adam Goodes was different. I’d first noticed it reading his essay in the AFL’s official history published in 2008. Adam Goodes said things Aboriginal people don’t normally say to a non-Aboriginal audience. He called himself a half-caste. Aboriginal people, as a rule, never use the term “half-caste” - the Koori singer Archie Roach told me it made him feel like people were talking about cattle. In his 2008 essay, Goodes also wrote about his formative years. If I learnt one thing from my 13 years trying to write a book with Michael Long, it was how big the Stolen Generation, and the vast cultural divide it made for, is in the families descended from the stolen. Goodes’ father is a white man. His mother is Stolen Generation who grew up with minimal knowledge of her culture. At school, he copped it from white kids for being black and from black kids for being white.\n\nI know of no other famous Australian story which starts at that point – the narrator being someone who’s an outsider in both worlds, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal! As I understand the story of his life, his understanding of his Aboriginality starts after he gets to the Swans and falls under the influence of Michael O’Loughlin.\n\nDuring 2015, I didn’t write about Adam Goodes as if I knew him because I didn’t. We met once but I came away with the feeling that I hadn’t really met him. I think he’d say that too. We were polite with one another. I certainly don’t believe I would have won Adam Goodes’ respect then or now by writing an article that implied I know him better than I do. That’s why the article I wrote about the Goodes affair was actually about Chris Lewis. I know Chris Lewis. I could discuss the matter with him. I read the article to him before I filed it. He struggled with it but agreed to let me send out his message another time. Chris Lewis, Aboriginal warrior, will meet anyone half-way. Isn’t that what it’s all about? Meeting others half-way?\n\nBy now the Indian gentleman was texting me daily saying, “You must denounce racism! You must denounce racism”. I thought he was seriously misreading the cultural politics at play. The Adam Goodes affair was my first confrontation with I call Trumpism. A lot of people were making pious calls for the AFL to act. A characteristic of Trumpism is that the old sources of cultural authority are suddenly without authority. Limp, ineffective. To the people who became intent on booing Adam Goodes no matter what, Gillon McLachlan, or what he is perceived as representing, was one of the reasons they were booing. To those same people, I was irrelevant, if in fact they had any idea who I was. I wrote that the only people who could stop the booing were the players. The Indian gentlemen went nuts. “They are only boys!” he cried. No, the players are young men who make adult choices about risk and injury for all to see on the football field and, commensurate with the skill and bravery they show in doing so, they win the broad respect of their audience.\n\nBulldogs CaptainBob Murphy led the way, writing an article in The Age in which he called the boos being directed at Goodes “blows to the soul”. I still wonder why more indigenous players didn’t stand up at the time. If Cyril Rioli, Sean Burgoyne and Bradley Hill had fronted a TV news camera and said to Hawthorn fans, “We represent you, you represent us. Each time you boo Adam Goodes, you’re booing us too”; if that had happened – and if, as a bonus, some of their whitefeller team-mates stood with them like the Melbourne players stood with their indigenous team-mates at that time – then, I reckon, there would have been a different conversation in the crowd between those doing the booing and the many non-Aboriginal people of all races and backgrounds who were opposed to it.\n\nI had some sympathy with those who said booing has always been part of the game. It has. The football codes go back to medieval street games and street theatre. They’re about heroes and villains. They’re about booing and cheering. A football stadium is not a church. Proceedings are not conducted in an attitude of reverence. So, yes, I believe booing has always been part of the game. But I mean those words literally – booing is part of the game but there are moments when games cease to be games.\n\nIn the 2000 Grand Final, Michael Long hit Melbourne player Troy Simmons with a hip and shoulder to the head and upper body which knocked Simmons senseless. I had spent quite a bit of time that year helping a young man who had broken his spine in a skiing accident adjust to life in a wheelchair. When Michael Long collected Troy Simmons, I saw how that same accident could occur on the football field and, for a long moment, feared that it had. The game ceased to be a game to me. I didn’t watch any more, I didn’t care who won. Michael Long is someone I have deep respect and affection for, but this was something I had to discuss with him in the course of doing our book together.\n\nWell, booing is part of the game but the game can cease to be a game and for me the booing of Adam Goodes did cease to be a game. It wasn’t just Adam Goodes who believed there was a racist element to the booing, virtually the whole of Aboriginal Australia did and lots of other people besides. Each week, more people felt the hurt being caused but still the booing went on. The beautiful Australian game became the ugly Australian game.\n\nEssentially, what happened was that a debate or discussion we should be having as a nation but never do – the relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australia – had surfaced through the medium of the national game. Did Goodes being Australian of the Year have anything to do with it? In my opinion, without doubt, as became clear when figures like Alan Jones and News Limited columnist Miranda Devine entered the fray arguing (1) that the booing had nothing to do with Goodes being Aboriginal, that (2) they didn’t like the way he played but, (3) they didn’t like things he said as Australian of the Year - when he spoke as an Aboriginal Australian.\n\nI found the debate around the Goodes affair confused and confusing. A traffic jam of a debate. For example, the issue of war dances. A war dance is a war dance. As Goodes said after he threw his imaginary spear, it’s a challenge. The New Zealand haka is the great war dance of world sport. But there are very clear rules about the performances of the haka, as there was nearly an all-in brawl after the Irish rugby team decided to counter it by moving forward and standing inches from the faces of the All Blacks as they were delivering it. And the challenge of the haka is never issued to the crowd – always to the other team. When I wrote this during the Goodes debate, a reader wrote in saying that I was therefore anti-Goodes. I would like to have asked the reader - have you ever seen serious crowd misbehaviour at a sporting event close-up? I have, both attending soccer matches in Scotland and England in the late 1970s when there was a spirit of barely controlled violence all around you, and on my first visit to the MCG in 1971 to see a one-day match, when the place was awash with alcohol and police lost control of whole sections of the crowd.\n\nThe journalist I thought who wrote best about the Goodes affair – by which I mean with the greatest penetration and insight – was Stan Grant. When I met Stan Grant earlier this year at the Sydney Writers’ Festival, I said to him that the Goodes affair was both simple and complex. He agreed. Grant’s book, “Talking to my Country” - an extremely important Australian book, in my view – explains the complexity of Grant’s own journey as a man with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal heritage and how the tensions this has created in his life all came into focus for him during the Adam Goodes saga. One of the things Stan Grant’s book caused me to realise is that the Adam Goodes affair wasn’t merely about how non-Aboriginal Australians see Aboriginal Australians - it was also about how non-Aboriginal Australians were being called upon to see Aboriginal Australians as they’d never seen them before!\n\nWould I like to talk to Adam Goodes? Of course. Have I got lots of questions to ask him? Maybe too many for a man walking a difficult and intensely personal path. But at this year’s Sydney Writers’ Festival I heard that he had withdrawn permission for his biography, written by sportswriter Malcolm Knox, to appear. My understanding is that he wants to retire from the public gaze, as is his right. I am sorry about what happened to Adam Goodes but I am in no doubt he will be vindicated by history. In 25 years, probably less, he will be a huge figure in the history of the game.\n\nThe AFL is routinely abused for having failed to eliminate racism. Two years ago, at the launch of the Long Walk, I sat with Michael Long on a panel while a television journalist said to him that the Adam Goodes affair was proof that he, Michael Long, had failed. You haven’t abolished racism, he cried. This is a culture which provides huge public platforms for the likes of Donald Trump, Pauline Hanson and Andrew Bolt. Does anyone seriously believe that half a dozen sports stadiums around Australia are somehow going to be rendered immune from their combined effect? The AFL can no more eliminate racism than it can end war. What the AFL can do is legislate for events which occur in its domain. have laws and enforce those laws, and thereby serve as a social model. Michael Long single-handedly revolutionised the cultural values of the game in 1993; that consensus held until the Goodes affair. We are now, historically speaking, entering new socio-political territory.\n\nRecently, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick chose to sit rather than stand during the US National Anthem at a preseason game in protest against the treatment of black people and people of colour in his country. While I was preparing this speech I was asked, “Could that happen here?” Yes. And if it doesn’t happen here, something like it will happen in some other country around the world. I don’t believe the human frailties and weaknesses on display in the Goodes case are peculiar to any particular race or nationality. I take my faith from a dedication the great Aboriginal leader Patrick Dodson wrote for The Call, my book on Tom Wills: “The struggle never ends. The reward is the people you meet along the way”.\n\nI have tried to talk today about what happens when matters of national import arise through the medium of sport. I’ve also tried to frame the Goodes saga in a different way and untangle some of the knots that were drawn so tightly at the time. Another aspect of the relationship between politics and sport is the way people seize upon sport as a means of acquiring money and power. This happens in dictatorships, and by different means and to a lesser degree it happens in democracies. A famous Australian comedy was written about it called Strictly Ballroom. But there is little amusing about world bodies like FIFA and the IOC in which the most corrupt bodies and individuals have a history of flourishing shamelessly at the expense of the rest. I won’t talk about that in detail because you have another journalist speaking at this conference who is eminently more qualified to do so – David Walsh, the man who pursued cyclist Lance Armstrong for doping. These are serious subjects which deserve the serious discussions a forum such as this can provide.\n\nBut, whatever scepticism I have about the IOC, I still believe in the Olympic ideal. I still support the idea of young athletes from all over the world meeting every four years. I am in awe of the Paralympics. Ultimately, for better or worse, sport reflects human nature. One of my favourite sports stories happened one hundred years ago when the great armies in World War 1 ceased fighting on Christmas Day, met in no-man’s land, began kicking a can – maybe someone had a ball – and, in the mist of unprecedented human carnage, soldiers from both armies began playing with one another. One of those who disapproved intensely was Adolf Hitler. Why? Because he was a homicidal maniac and he understood intuitively that men who played together were less likely to kill one another. And, so, we are confronted with a struggle that never ends – sport is endlessly corruptible and there is a battle that has to be fought on that count. But sport, like hope, is constantly born anew and it is a fact that good things grow from it. And so I conclude today by saying: Play on.\n\nSee Tim Cahill tonight. (18/10/16, 8pm)"
