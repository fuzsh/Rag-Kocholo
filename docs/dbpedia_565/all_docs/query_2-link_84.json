        "text": "One is a triple Crichton medallist, captain and coach of the Essendon Football Club; the other is one of the greatest full backs the game has ever seen. On July 19, the Dick Reynolds Club will be celebrating the achievements of these two Bomber champions – Barry Davis and Dustin Fletcher - at our annual cocktail party.\n\nHosted by Tony Charlton it promises to be a memorable evening. As part of the night Barry Davis will be inducted into the Essendon Football Club Hall of Fame. The Dick Reynolds Club and guests will also acknowledge and celebrate Dustin Fletcher’s recent 250-game milestone.\n\nRecruited from Essendon High School, Barry Davis debuted for the Bombers in Round 2 1961. It was the beginning of an impressive career that spanned 218 games and included two Premierships.\n\nWearing the number 32 guernsey, the superb half back flanker and then ruck rover, captained Essendon in 1970 and 1971 before becoming vice captain to Des Tuddenham in 1972. Ranked 15 in the Champions of Essendon, Davis won the best and fairest award in 1968, 1969 and 1971 and was runner-up in 1972.\n\nAt the tender age of 17, Dustin Fletcher joined the Dons in 1993 and immediately made an impression. Taking on some of the game’s greatest full-forwards, Fletcher received not only the Essendon Best First Year Player award, but also the AFL Player's Association Best First Year Player.\n\nHe quickly became an integral part of the Essendon back line, fitting into the role of full back where he has held down the position with class for over 250 matches. Winner of the 2000 Crichton Medal, an All-Australian selection and a member of the year 2000 winning Grand Final side was the highlight of Dustin’s career."
