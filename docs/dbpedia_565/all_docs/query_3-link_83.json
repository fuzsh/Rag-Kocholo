The club was formed by the McCracken family in their Ascot Vale home \"Alisa\" adopting the name of the local borough. While the exact date is unknown, it is generally accepted to have been in 1872.

Zach Merrett is the current club captain.\n\nQuick Facts Names, Full name ...\n\nClose\n\nEssendon is one of Australia's best-known and most successful football clubs.[2] It has won 16 VFL/AFL premierships, which, along with Carlton and Collingwood, is the most of any club in the competition. The club won four consecutive VFA premierships between 1891 and 1894, a feat unmatched in that competition's history. Essendon also hold the distinction of being the only club to win a premiership in their inaugural season (1897). It has struggled to achieve significant on-field success in the 21st century, however, having won its last premiership in 2000 and last final in 2004.\n\nDuring the early-to-mid 2010s, the team was the focus of an investigation by the AFL and independent regulatory bodies into their alleged use of illegal substances during the 2012 season, which led to 34 players receiving two-year suspensions, a $2 million fine, and disqualification from the 2013 finals series (among other penalties). No Essendon player ever returned a positive sample for any banned drug at any point in the investigation.\n\nThree Essendon players—John Coleman, Bill Hutchison, and Dick Reynolds—and one coach, Kevin Sheedy, are classified as \"Legends\" in the Australian Football Hall of Fame."
