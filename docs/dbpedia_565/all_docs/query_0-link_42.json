Turner Classic Movies does just that with a New Year’s Day marathon featuring eight of the first nine titles from the original era of Godzilla flicks (only King Kong vs. Godzilla is missing, sadly). Note that these are the original Japanese versions, with English subtitles. The lineup kicks off with the one that started it all: 1954’s Gojira (Godzilla), which depicts Godzilla at his second-most terrifying (the Godzilla in last year’s Godzilla Minus One managed to top this one in ferocity and brutality) as he embarks upon his initial devastation of Tokyo. After that comes Godzilla Raids Again (1955), the second and last black-and-white entry in the franchise. It introduces the monster Anguirus, and while he and Godzilla become besties in later movies, they engage in deadly combat here. Next are two 1964 movies that are among the high points of the early Godzilla era: Mothra vs. Godzilla, in which fierce mom Mothra battles to defend the egg carrying her larval offspring from Godzilla, and Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster, which sees one of Mothra’s kids trying to convince Godzilla and winged monster Rodan to help her save Earth from the space monster King Ghidorah. Ghidorah and Rodan are back with Godzilla in the next film, Invasion of Astro-Monster (1965), and for a time all three are under alien control in a plot to conquer Earth. Then comes Ebirah, Horror of the Deep (1966), which pits Godzilla against a giant crustacean on a South Seas island, and Son of Godzilla (1967), which is set on another remote island and introduces Godzilla’s adopted son, Minilla. The lineup concludes with 1968’s Destroy All Monsters, which features a who’s who of some of Toho’s most memorable early kaiju creations, 11 in all (led by Godzilla, of course), who eventually come together to help defeat King Ghidorah and more alien invaders.\n\n“Elementary” Marathon\n\nStart TV, beginning at 8am\n\nElementary, the procedural crime drama that ran on CBS from 2012-19, begins airing in its regular time slot on Start TV afternoons Mondays-Sundays.

That long history began 100 years ago this month, in fact; the company known as Columbia Pictures, based off an existing company that had begun in New York City in 1918, was founded on Jan. 10, 1924. You can enjoy many of the movies Columbia has produced over the past century each Wednesday night this month when Turner Classic Movies airs lineups devoted to Columbia titles from two decades per night. Up first is a look at highlights from the studio’s first two decades, the 1920s and ’30s. It begins with the legendary screwball comedy It Happened One Night (1934), which was the first of only three movies in Hollywood history to win all five major Oscar categories: Best Picture, Best Director (Frank Capra), Best Actor (Clark Gable), Best Actress (Claudette Colbert) and Best Screenplay (Robert Riskin). After that comes the TCM premiere of 1934’s Woman Haters, the first comedy short starring what would become one of Columbia’s most beloved and enduring acts: the Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Jerry “Curly” Howard were billed under their own names at the time of the film’s release, since the Stooges had yet to be professionally known as the Stooges at that point). A couple of more acclaimed early comedies from Columbia follow: The Awful Truth (1937), starring Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, and You Can’t Take It With You (1938), another Best Picture-winning classic from Best Director winner Capra.
