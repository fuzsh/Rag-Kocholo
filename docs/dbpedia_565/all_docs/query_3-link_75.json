        "text": "In 2004 the EFCPP&OA approached the EFC with a proposal to jointly develop a past players foundation trust to assist past players who were suffering financial hardship and were not able to maintain their normal living standards. The EFC agreed to this proposal and the EFC Past Players Foundation Trust was formed, with each group donating $25,000 to initiate the fund. The topping up of this fund, on a year by year basis, was provided by profits generated by the Dick Reynolds Club functions, however, since the Association has now taken over the running of the DRC, the EFC have agreed to top up the fund each year within certain guidelines. Since the start of the EFC Past Players Foundation Trust, in excess of 30 past players and their immediate families have been assisted and will no doubt require further funds in the future.\n\nIn 2015 the Association decided to increase the balance of the fund over a five year period by donating $10,000 per year which together with income derived from the DRC Annual Golf Day, should see the fund with a minimum balance of $150,000 by the end of 2020.\n\nWe would always welcome any assistance from supporters should they wish to contribute to the fund, by contacting Barry Capuano on [email protected]\n\nThe EFCPP&OA are extremely grateful to the EFC for their continued support of this important program.\n\nThe current Trustees of the EFC Past Players Foundation Trust are Ray Horsburgh, Greg Brown and Barry Capuano.\n\nThe EFC initiated the presentation of Debut Jumpers for all living past players of the Club in 2003.\n\nThe Debut Jumper represents an historical and performance record of each individual. The reference to Debut actually refers to the number that the player was registered with the VFL/AFL, and as only 1,150 players (to the end of 2017) have represented the EFC since the formation of the VFL in 1897, it is easy to understand why the recipients so highly regard these presentations, particularly as this is unique within the AFL industry.\n\nOther information on the jumper includes: Years played, games played, playing number and any milestones, e.g. playing in a premiership team, best & fairest etc.\n\nOf the 1,163players who have represented the EFC to the end of 2019 (excluding the 33 still playing):\n\n116 (10.4%), played only one game. 41.7 Games is the average number of games played by all past players. The average playing careers of past players is 3.7 years.\n\nIn 2008 the EFCPP&OA became directly involved with organizing Debut Jumper presentations, and as part of this program is actively attempting to locate every living past player to ensure that their jumper is presented as soon as practical.\n\nThe intent of the Debut Jumper program was to present the jumpers to players at least three (3) years after their retirement from AFL football.\n\nDuring 2015, the Association presented a Discussion Paper to the club regarding the development of a past player welfare and assistance program, seeking their assistance in utilizing club facilities to help in developing this program. The intent of this program is to develop a wide range of networking opportunities available to past players following their playing days, and could cover any field available to them through our own member base, Coterie group members and various major supporters of the club, including club Sponsors. This program, named the Top Mark Network, is now fully operational and we believe that this program will be of great benefit to all past players and will lead the way in the AFL competition.\n\nThe Association now has a work station at the club, which enables a close working relationship with club staff in developing this program."
