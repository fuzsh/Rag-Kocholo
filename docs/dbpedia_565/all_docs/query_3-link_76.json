        "text": "**KEVIN SHEEDY’S BEST BOMBERS TEAM OF PLAYERS HE COACHED **\n\n1981 - 2007\n\nB: Gavin Wanganeen, Dustin Fletcher, Paul Weston\n\nHB: Bill Duckworth, Neale Daniher, Mark Thompson\n\nC: Michael Long, Leon Baker, Merv Neagle\n\nHF: Terry Daniher, Roger Merrett, Tim Watson\n\nF: Paul Salmon, Matthew Lloyd, Mark Harvey\n\nFOLL: Simon Madden, James Hird, Darren Williams\n\nInter: Scott Lucas, Mark Mercuri, Gary O’Donnell, Glen Hawker, Jason Johnson, Paul Vander Haar\n\nA couple of surprises, but it’s hard to argue against many of the inclusions though. For me the most unlucky person is Darren Bewick. It is also evident that no one since 2007 other than Jobe would go close to getting a spot in this team.\n\nI think Sheeds can leave Jobe out given he didn’t play much good footy until after 2007.\n\nRioli probably didn’t have the tenure.\n\nSmoking Joe stiff. His longevity and 2 flags is probably a better career with lesser highs than JJ who was an All Australian and a 2 time BnF winner.\n\nI knew I would miss one ;-( I need to wear glasses when posting at night…\n\nIt’s still instructive that only one player good enough to make that side was recruited in the last 12 seasons of Sheedy’s reign, and for the first however many of Dodoro’s time as recruiter.\n\nWould there be any non father-son players since 2007 that would get selected into a “best of the last 42 years” side?"
