        "text": "The Essendon Football club turns to a \"outsider\" to take charge\n\nSpeed, Agilty, and youth is the three main key's for the new Essendon coach, who goes by the name Haydo, and Haydo only. The Essendon football club would like to formally announce that they needed a change in their football club. Things were going down hill at windy hill with Matthew Knights, as he struggled to inspire his team in such big events such as the Anzac day matches.\n\nThe department of the Football Club decided that a new coach was on hand, and they decided on someone new, fresh and mysterious.\n\n'Haydo' has never played AFL football, but did have a good 10 year junior football career where he played some good football on a wing, and a stint at Full Forward for various clubs. The Essendon Board, wanted a fresh new change at the club and they believe that someone who hasn't been involved with footy, could be the way to go... \"Yeah of course we think Haydo can do the job, hence the reason we hired him, He has a big task on his hands, but we think, as a football club in all, that Haydo will do us the world of good, and lead us to sucess.\n\nThe 2009 Football season is about to commence after the Bombers were thrashed in the NAB Cup to the Western Bulldogs. Collingwood won the NAB Cup competition over the Port Power, by 75 points.\n\nAfter just three weeks, Haydo and his men have got to know each other, and are starting to form a wonderful player coach relationship.\n\n\"It's been a good few weeks on the track, and we are learning something totally different from Haydo. The game plan we are learning is hard to work out, but when we execute it on game day, it will pay off, said Essendon Defender, Adam McPhee.\"\n\nThe Coach came out to a press conference just minutes ago, and this is what he had to say... \"I've enjoyed my first couple of weeks here at Windy Hill, and i know that we are going to go far this year. Of course we are aiming for the finals, but anything above that is just a bonus. Also, i've come to realize that this time of the year our Captain, and Vice Captain and Leadership is named. So i will be quick. Our Captain will be Matthew Lloyd. Vice Captain will be Adam McPhee and Deputy Vice Captain will be Mark McVeigh. The 6 players named in the leadership group are as followed 1. Dustin Fletcher, 2. Angus Monfries, 3. Brent Stanton, 4. Scott Lucas, 5. David Hille and 6. Jobe Watson\n\nThe Essendon team is gearing up ready for their Round 1 clash against the Kangaroos on the Monday night, the 24th of March at the Telstra Dome. Here is the Senior list for the Bombers this season.\n\nAdam McPhee\n\nAlwyn Davey\n\nAndrew Lovett\n\nAndrew Welsh\n\nAngus Monfries\n\nBachar Houli\n\nBrent Prismall\n\nBrent Stanton\n\nCale Hooker\n\nCourtenay Dempsey\n\nDarcy Daniher\n\nDavid Hille\n\nDavid Meyers\n\nDavid Zaharakis\n\nDustin Fletcher\n\nHayden Skipworth\n\nHeath Hocking\n\nHenry Slattery\n\nJason Laycock\n\nJason Winderlich\n\nJay Nash\n\nJay Neagle\n\nJobe Watson\n\nJohn Williams\n\nKyle Reimers\n\nLeroy Jetta\n\nMark McVeigh\n\nMatthew Lloyd\n\nMichael Hurley\n\nMichael Still\n\nNathan Lovett-Muarry\n\nPaddy Ryder\n\nRicky Dyson\n\nSam Lonergan\n\nScott Gumbleton\n\nScott Lucas\n\nTayte Pears\n\nTom Bellchambers\n\nTyson Slattery\n\nRookies\n\nBryce Carroll\n\nChristian Bock\n\nJarrod Atkinson\n\nKade Klemke\n\nRhys Magin​\n\n​"
