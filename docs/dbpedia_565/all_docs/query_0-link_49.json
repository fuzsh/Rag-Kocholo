        "text": "By Tony De Bolfo\n\nBetty Austin has seen fit to right the wrongs about her late father. In doing so she’s made available some terrific images and documents to perpetuate the memory of Alex Doyle, Carlton’s 53-game player through the Depression years.\n\nFor some time it’s been incorrectly reported that Alex embarked on a career as playing coach of Tasmanian football club Cananore on the completion of his playing career at Princes Park.\n\nNot so says Betty. To Cananore’s chagrin, the deal fell through when Carlton refused Alex a clearance.\n\nInstead, she says her father maintained a long-term involvement with the game in and around the Melbourne metropolitan area, as he committed his energies to his employer, the Fire Brigade.\n\nThe son of John and Elizabeth Doyle, Alex was one of three siblings born in the Victorian wheat district town of Murtoa on July 29, 1904. He was but an infant when his father was transferred to Yackandandah with the railways and later Horsham, where Alex plied his craft as a junior footballer.\n\nThough he would ultimately complete almost four decades of service with the Metropolitan fire Brigade, Alex initially pursued carpentry as his trade and made his mark on Princes Park in more than one manner. As Betty says: “He once told me that he built the picket fence around Carlton . . . whether that was true or not I don’t know, but what I do know is that he was a pretty good carpenter”.\n\nAlex represented the Wimmera with great distinction on a number of occasions during football’s equivalent of cricket’s country week. In 1926, he took part in a kicking competition then sponsored by The Sporting Globe and convened by its football writer “Jumbo” Sharland. Alex thought he’d taken the chocolates with a drop kick measuring 72 yards five inches, only to be trumped by Echuca’s fabled Chinese footballer Les Kew-Ming with a 75-yarder.\n\nBy now, Alex’s feats were prompting intense interest amongst the inner city clubs Collingwood, Essendon, Hawthorn and of course, the good guys. The following handwritten letter, penned by the then Carlton Secretary and all-time great Carlton footballer Horrie Clover in December 1926, attests to this fact.\n\n“Mr. Doyle,\n\nDear Sir,\n\nHaving heard many favorable reports of your outstanding ability on the football field I have much pleasure on behalf of the Carlton Club in extending to you a cordial invitation to join our Club for next football season.\n\nTrusting that you will give this matter your earnest and favorable consideration and hoping that you will favor me with a reply at your earliest convenience.\n\nI am, yours faithfully,\n\nHorrie Clover\n\nSecretary.”\n\nFor whatever reason, Alex opted to delay his introduction to VFL football and it wasn’t until late 1928 that he resolved to commit to Carlton, together with Horsham’s Frank Gill and Warracknabeal’s Charlie “Snowy” Parsons.\n\n“Of course it was around about this time that everybody was looking for work and all these people had written to Dad not only to place him as a footballer but to offer him a job as well. This played a big part in Depression times,” Betty says.\n\nThe following letter to Alex, penned on a Carlton letterhead dated September 6, 1928, sets the scene at time when coin was still being cast about despite the dire economic circumstances.\n\n“Dear Sir,\n\nI am instructed by my committee to advise you that Messrs Crone and Clover reported that they interviewed you in Horsham during the week and were successful in inducing you to throw in your lot with us next season.\n\nI can assure you that we are congratulating ourselves in securing your services and I am sure that you will not regret the step you have taken and we think a few men of your stamp will help us to be the premier league side for season 1929.\n\nWe have not broadcasted the fact that you have signed up with us, not even to our Committee, until the commencement of next season.\n\nIf you should be approached by other League clubs for your services next season be careful not to sign up with them because if you do you will disqualify yourself not only for playing with Carlton but also Melbourne football owing to the fact that you have signed up with more than one club. I would suggest if you are approached (and I am certain you will be especially if you play in Melbourne in Show Week) to tell those who approached you that you are going to Carlton next season.\n\nI am looking forward with pleasure to meeting you in Melbourne at that time.\n\nOn behalf of my Committee I desire to thank you for signing up with us and I hope that your association with the Carlton Football Club will be a successful one as well as a profitable one.\n\nHoping that I shall have the pleasure of meeting you in the near future.\n\nYours faithfully,\n\nPJ Cain\n\nSecretary\n\nPS. To keep yourself free from complications you will have to refuse any offers of money that might be made to you by other League Clubs.”\n\nAlex took up lodgings as a boarder at No.52 Garton Street in the shadows of the Legends Stand. In time he would meet his future wife “Nellie” Lannge who lived with her family in the house next door.\n\nHe fronted for the first night of training under the watch of resident Senior coach and lifelong friend Dan Minogue at the Carlton ground at 4.45pm on the afternoon of Tuesday, March 12, 1929. So began what was to prove a brief but beautiful friendship for player and club which would take in 53 senior matches over three seasons through The Great Depression.\n\nWearing the No.19 now proudly sported by Eddie Betts, Alex pitted his skills against the likes of Melbourne’s Ivor Warne-Smith and St Kilda’s Colin Watson, the two greatest adversaries he ever confronted.\n\nHe won the hearts and minds of all Carltonians from bottom to top and a glorious certificate of appreciation, signed by President David Crone and Secretary Newton Chandler acknowledges the high regard in which Alex was held.\n\nBut luck would not run with the Carlton teams in which he featured, with both the 1929 and ’31 outfits falling six points agonizingly short of Richmond and Geelong in the respective preliminary finals of those years.\n\nRemarkably, Alex also fronted up for Wednesday League games during the late 1920s early 30s. in those days, games comprised teams from the Air Force, Victoria Police, Yellow Cabs, Red and Checker Cabs, Post and Telegraph, Railways, the Victoria Market, Waterside Workers and of course, the fire brigade.\n\n“The football was good and attracted quite a following as well as a lot of newspaper interest,” a brigade scribe later reported.\n\n“To say the games were rugged and the boys were fractious is an understatement, so much so that with all the fights it was inevitable the competition had to fold up and fold up it did.\n\n“The brigade were in the Wednesday League for years and withdrew for a number of reasons, mainly because the brawls and bad language had brought the competition into bad odour.”\n\nBy then, Alex’s future as a fireman was already assured. In January 1932, after accepting an invitation to contest a vacant employment position within the brigade, Alex won the role.\n\nThirty-five years later, he would receive a letter from the brigade carrying a seal of recognition for 35 years service.\n\nAlex’s commitment to the MFB didn’t curtail his football involvement though. Rather, it enhanced it. In seasons 1933 and ’34, for example, he represented the then VFA club Preston whilst headquartered at the North Melbourne brigade and in 1935 he took up a position as Essendon’s reserve grade coach. A stint with the Oakleigh brigade came later, during which time Alex hooked up with the local football club as a selector.\n\nOf course, Alex’s wife “Nellie”, son John and daughter Betty dutifully followed husband and father from station to station and as Betty said: “Wherever we moved with the fire brigade he got involved with footy”.\n\nFor years until his retirement, Alex maintained his passion for the great Australian game and for the old dark Navy Blues. Failing eyesight eventually put paid to his attendance at Carlton games and his final years were spent quietly at a home in East Doncaster.\n\nAfter suffering a heart attack, Alex died in nearby Box Hill Hospital on January 21, 1973. He is buried in Springvale Cemetery with his beloved wife who survived him by some six years.\n\nToday, Alex’s legacy lives on through Betty – a greater Carlton supporter there never was – together with his many grandchildren and great grandchildren, many of whom will be there come March 29 to cheer Chris Judd and the boys on.\n\nAnthony Koutoufides\n\nCareer: 1992 – 2007\n\nDebut: Round 13, 1992 vs Adelaide\n\n985th Carlton Player\n\nGames: 278\n\nGoals: 226\n\nLast game: Round 17, 2007 v St Kilda\n\nGuernsey No. 43\n\nHeight: 190cm\n\nWeight: 99kg\n\nDOB: 18 January, 1973\n\nPremiership Player: 1995\n\nLeigh Matthews Trophy AFLPA MVP: 2000\n\nBest and Fairest: 2001, 2005\n\nAll Australian: 1995, 2000\n\nLeading Goalkicker: 1997\n\nCaptain: 2004-06\n\nAnthony Koutoufides will no doubt be remembered for many things; Carlton Captain, his famous super-build, his ability to play in a number of positions and thrive, his outstanding fairness out on the field, his pay-packet, his ability to pick up and hold the ball with one hand, and for being a mildly spoken nice guy. But above all, “Kouta” will go down in history as a Club legend.\n\nThe 191cm right-foot star in the #43 guernsey came to the Blues via a zone selection, a form of recruiting replaced by the draft (he was recruited from Lalor, he also played at East Thomastown). Although it took a few seasons for Kouta the utility to take his place, Kouta began to dominate on the wing over 1994 and 1995 and he was unlucky not to win the Norm Smith Medal in our GF win of 1995. He came 2nd in the Club Best & Fairest in 1999, third in 2000 while he won All-Australian selection plus the Players Association MVP award, and then won the Club Best & Fairest in 2001 and 2005.\n\nKouta was unstoppable in 2000, including a run of games mid season in which we would dominate.\n\nIn later years he would play occasional key position roles, including 6 from Full Forward one day, plus rucking in his early days when we needed some mobility. Perhaps of most interest to the historians is Kouta’s change in game from strong marking midfielder to insider clearer, as Ratten’s demise and Kouta’s knees required a change in position.\n\nKouta’s influence was so important to the Blues that the Blueseum has utilised a ‘story by games’ of Kouta’s career, which highlights wonderful games of Kouta’s career from 1992 to 2007, and can be accessed here.\n\nFor a true understanding of Kouta’s potential in many roles across the ground, look no further than his ‘Stat Shot’ in side the Blueseum. From key position player, to midfielder, to extractor, to bit-part player as his age increased, you can see Kouta the player excelling in different areas of the game – from goals, to marks, to clearances, to tackles. His importance to the team in various roles would simply not decline as the years did – Kouta was / is a champ in many different areas of the game.\n\nThere was also Kouta’s fair share of injuries, with two major knee injuries in 2000 and 2001 plus a hamstring tendon injury that delayed his debut as captain in 2004. The 2000 knee injury was incurred in a mid-air collision with Bomber Johnson in Round 20 injuring his Posterior Ligament, not to mention our finals chances. The 2001 injury was even more longer term, and caused after Tiger Matthew Knights fell across his knee in the dour 2001 Semi-Final loss. Of course, Kouta tried to return early, playing 3 games with a mattress tied to his leg in Rounds 15-17 of 2002, before re-hurting the knee against the Swans and finishing his season early.\n\nThere are so many memories to Kouta’s play that it is hard to pick out the best. The 1999 Preliminary Final where Kouta was dominating at all parts of the ground simultaneously – think about that for a second – was as awesome a game of footy you will see from any one player.\n\nBy Tony De Bolfo\n\nChris Pavlou, who blissfully committed more than 50 years of his life to Carlton as a senior footballer, runner, recruiter, coach, past players President and board member, died yesterday after a brave battle with cancer.\n\nHe was 72.\n\nChris died peacefully in the company of his family at his home in Frankston, the place from which he was recruited to the club way back in 1958.\n\nHe is survived by his wife of 47 years Mary, son Anthony, daughters Trish and Louise, and three grandchildren. Funeral arrangements are to be detailed in Tuesday’s Herald Sun.\n\nThe Chris Pavlou story had its origins in Foster, not far from where the rolling hills meet the Gippsland coastline, where he was born on August 18, 1939. Chris’s father hailed from Cyprus and his mother from Ithaka, his parents having migrated to Australia in 1922 and ’34 respectively.\n\nIn 1947, after the Pavlous relocated to Frankston to run a fish and chip shop, Chris was enrolled in the local Frankston state school and together with his older brother Con and younger brother George leant assistance to their parents on the premises. Later, Chris followed Con to the Frankston Football Club, turning out with the Under 17s at the tender age of 15.\n\n“As a 15 year-old I didn’t really know much about football to be honest with you, because being of ethnic background I was with my parents working in the shop,” Chris said in a final interview with this reporter recently. “Football wasn’t really a priority because I had to work a bit.”\n\nIt was around this time that Chris pledged his passionate support to Carlton, which would linger until his last breath.\n\nWhy Carlton?\n\n“Well I had a fight with my brother when Carlton was playing Essendon for the ’47 premiership,” he said. “Of course, Carlton won, but my brother wouldn’t let me listen to the radio, he was pushing me aside.\n\n“Now Frankston wore the same colours as Essendon and we loved Frankston, but he wouldn’t let me listen to the footy . . . and it was a close game with Stafford kicking the goal for Carlton to win by a point, so I had a go at him and said ‘I’m going to barrack for Carlton from now on’.”\n\n“The next day Mum went and bought me a Carlton jumper so I put that on and supported them ever since . . . and they’ve been my life really. For 51 years Carlton has been my life.”\n\nIt was at Frankston that Chris’s footballing talents were first identified by the late Carlton premiership player and coach Jim Francis.\n\n“Jim Francis happened to live at Long Island in a holiday home at Frankston,” Chris recalled, “and he came along to watch us at training.\n\n“I don’t know what prompted him to do that . . . whether he was going for a walk along the beach . . . but he headed up to the Frankston footy ground, saw us playing and having a kick, and the next thing I knew he asked me if I’d like to have a run at Carlton.\n\n“At that time Carlton were looking for small, quick players. There was Bruce Williams from Morwell, Marty Cross, Johnny Heathcote, Barry Smith and myself – and ‘Handsy’ (Ken Hands) had this idea of getting some pace into the team. There was quite a handful of young quick players who helped get the ball rolling with pace . . . ”\n\nChris couldn’t believe his luck. “I just got such a buzz to be invited to Carlton – to go to the Carlton Football Club to play – because I barracked for Carlton,” he said.\n\n“I couldn’t believe I had the opportunity to have a run around. I remember walking into the clubrooms and seeing Ken Hands, John Nicholls and Bill Milroy and I’m saying to myself ‘What am I doing here?’.\n\nChris also remembered Carlton as an accommodating club regardless of creed or religion.\n\n“We just accepted eachother as footballers and friends,” he said. “There was no animosity between us in being Italian or Greek and there were a lot of the Aussie boys there.\n\n“Vasil Varlamos didn’t get there until 1960, but my cousin, John Defteros was there in the under 19s at Carlton. He was about the only Greek connection I had, but in saying that, there were a lot of Greek supporters. A whole group of them used to gather around the wing at Princes Park to cheer the Greeks along.”\n\nVasil, the 44-game Carlton half-back flanker and perhaps Chris’s dearest friend from his playing days, said “Chris was a first generation Australian of Greek origin just like me, so that was a connection and we became very close”.\n\n“As a player he was fast and he started out as a rover, but he wasn’t strong enough around the packs so they put him on a wing. In ’61 he was probably one of the best wingmen in the League because he beat all the top wingers he played on, Brian Dixon included,” Vasil said.\n\n“He used to line up on a wing on Johnny James’ side of the ground and he played with such enthusiasm. He’d tell you if you did something right and I always remember his encouragement.”\n\nIn many respects, Chris’s playing career ended before it began. Completing his senior debut in the second round match of 1958 (he earned Allen Aylett as his maiden opponent against North Melbourne at Princes Park) Chris’s 31-game tenure as a rover and wingman ended in the 14th round of 1961, when in a match against Footscray at the Western Oval, he cannoned into the fence, sustaining a serious knee injury which he further aggravated after hobbling to the forward pocket.\n\nChris was 22 at the time, but would never again don the No.35 dark Navy Blue guernsey . . . and it hit him hard.\n\n“It upset me that much because I was on the verge of something. I wish I could have played a couple more years, just to see where it had have ended up,” he said.\n\n“We made the Grand Final in 1962, then Barassi came, then the great years of 1968 and 1970 . . . I didn’t get the opportunity to do those things and I often ask myself ‘How would I have gone?.”\n\nIn the aftermath of this personal setback, Chris embarked on what would be a five-year coaching career with East Launceston through the early 1960s, during which time he completed a playing comeback – only to suffer another serious knock to the knee.\n\nBut Chris was Carlton to the core and such was the depth of his admiration for the place and the lifelong friendships forged with men like George Armstrong, Jack Wrout, Ken Hands, Jack Carney and Bert Deacon that Chris inevitably returned to the mainland to renew club ties.\n\nAppointed Under 19s coach in 1973, Chris was afforded the rare opportunity to develop burgeoning Blues of the calibre of Peter Francis and the inaugural Norm Smith Medallist Wayne Harmes (whom Chris actually recruited) and “Harmesy” was one of a number of former players to visit Chris in recent weeks.\n\nTwenty years later, Chris was rewarded with Life Membership of the Carlton Football Club – only to further his commitment to the cause by championing the past players for 12 years and contributing at board level for almost two years through those dim dark days of the early 21st century.\n\nWhich came as no real surprise to those like Vasil Varlamos, who said of his former teammate: “I have never known anybody to love a football club like Chris”.\n\nAnthony Pavlou said today that “Dad’s wish was to spend one more Christmas with his family”.\n\n“He fought the hard battle to make Christmas and he achieved that,” Anthony said.\n\n“Of course he loved Carlton too, but the Pavlou family days at the football, cheering on the mighty Blues, will never be quite the same without him, for that was part of our ritual every week.\n\nNovember 1st: Leo Brereton Happy 75th Birthday!\n\nCareer : 1957 –62\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1957 vs Hawthorn\n\nCarlton Player No. 707\n\nGames : 72\n\nGoals : 129\n\nGuernsey No. 6\n\nLast Game: Preliminary Final, 1962 vs Geelong\n\nHeight : 174cm\n\nWeight : 70kg\n\nDOB : 1 November, 1936\n\nLeading Goalkicker: 1960\n\nRecruited from the Murray River town of Cohuna, Brereton was a small, nippy rover with excellent goal sense.

Perhaps best remembered for the myth that grew from his nickname, Wow was a heavily-tattooed giant at 200 cm and 102 kg – but one whose forbidding appearance hid a surprisingly gentle nature off the field.\n\nNovember 4th: Luke Livingston\n\nCareer : 2002 – 2006\n\nDebut : Round 4, 2002 vs Port Adelaide, aged 19 years, 168 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 1052\n\nGames : 46\n\nGoals : 2\n\nGuernsey No. 4\n\nLast Game : Round 11, 2006 vs West Coast, aged 23 years, 219 days\n\nHeight : 190 cm (6 ft. 2 in.)\n\nWeight : 92 kg (14 stone, 7 lbs.)\n\nDOB: 4 November, 1982\n\nLuke Livingston was taken at Pick No. 4 in the 2000 National Draft, the draft selection Carlton received from St Kilda as part of the trade for then club favourite Aaron Hamill. There were high expectations that Livingston, at 190cm, would become a star key position player for the Blues. Livingston was drafted from the Bendigo Pioneers U/18’s, with Kerang being his junior club.\n\n‘Livo’ was given the prized number 4 guernsey worn by Hamill, but made famous by our long-serving, dual Premiership captain, Stephen Kernahan. He played the first half of 2001 in the VFL, but then suffered a knee injury, followed by a life-threatening bowel disorder. He therefore had to wait until 2002 to make his debut, in round 4. This was also the year after Full Back of the Century Stephen Silvagni retired, leaving a void in defence that would be impossible to fill. Luke played 17 games in his first year – mainly at full-back, against some the best full forwards in the competition. He was young and inexperienced, and on a steep learning curve.\n\nNovember 5th\n\nDavid McKay\n\nCareer : 1969-1981\n\nDebut: Round 3, 1969 v Footscray\n\nCarlton Player No. 809\n\nGames: 263\n\nGoals: 277\n\nLast Game: Grand Final, 1981 v Collingwood\n\nGuernsey No. 43\n\nHeight: 191cm\n\nWeight: 92kg\n\nDOB: November 5, 1949\n\nPremiership Player: 1970, 1972, 1979, 1981\n\nJudged Best on Ground: 1970 Grand Final\n\nFondly remembered as one of the most consistent and spectacular high marks of his era, David “Swan” McKay was a Carlton star for twelve years, and a key member of four Premiership teams.\n\nRecruited from Newlyn, near Ballarat in central Victoria, McKay arrived at Princes Park in 1968 as a raw-boned 19 year-old. Coach Ron Barassi liked what he saw, and quickly realised that the laconic, easy-going country kid had the makings of something special when he played his first senior game for the Blues in 1969 in a back pocket, wearing the number 43 guernsey that he would retain throughout his career. At 191cm and 92 kg he had the ideal build for a key position, but was forced to wait for a regular place in a strong Carlton team, until the Blues were beaten by Richmond in the ’69 Grand Final. Early in the next season, McKay was given a chance at centre half-back, and took to it “like a swan to water.”\n\nTerry Board\n\nCareer : 1965 – 1968\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1965 vs Hawthorn, aged 19 years, 163 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 769\n\nGames : 41\n\nGoals : 42\n\nLast Game : Round 18, 1968 vs Collingwood, aged 22 years, 285 days\n\nGuernsey No. 24\n\nHeight : 173 cm (5 ft. 8 in.)\n\nWeight : 73 kg ( 11 stone, 7 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 5 November, 1945\n\nAn honest, hard-working rover from the famous Western District club South Warrnambool, Terry Board played his first game for the Navy Blues round 1, 1965, against Hawthorn at Glenferrie Oval. That achievement however, was completely overshadowed by the parallel debut that day of ex-Melbourne champion Ron Barassi, who had sensationally been appointed captain-coach of Carlton during the off-season.\n\nOn that pivotal Saturday afternoon, a record crowd of 36,000 packed into the Hawks’ headquarters, and saw a disciplined Carlton side come out on top by six goals, with Board more than handy in the role of second rover. Working in tandem with Adrian Gallagher, Terry kicked two majors, and gave every indication that he would be a handy acquisition. From then on, he went on to tally up 16 games and 20 goals for the year, and his future looked bright.\n\nNovember 6th: Gordon Collis\n\nCareer : 1961 – 1967\n\nDebut : Round 2, 1961 vs Fitzroy, aged 20 years, 167 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 739\n\nGames : 95\n\nGoals : 40\n\nLast Game : Preliminary Final, 1967 vs Geelong, aged 26 years, 313 days\n\nGuernsey No. 17\n\nHeight : 187 cm (6 ft. 1 in.)\n\nWeight: 84.5 kg (13 stone, 4 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 6 November, 1940\n\nBrownlow Medal 1964\n\nClub Best and Fairest 1964\n\nCarlton Hall of Fame 1987\n\nGordon Collis was a gifted key position player whose injury-hit career at Carlton was highlighted by one magnificent season in 1964. Overall, the Blues achieved very little that year, but Collis was hailed as the game’s outstanding key defender when he was an emphatic winner of the most prestigious individual award in the game; the Brownlow Medal.\n\nNovember 7th: Mark Athorn\n\nCareer: 1992 – 1993\n\nDebut: Round 1, 1992 vs Brisbane\n\nCarlton Player No. 975\n\nGames: 30\n\nGoals: 6\n\nGuernsey No. 25\n\nLast Game: Grand Final, 1993 vs Essendon\n\nHeight: 178cm\n\nWeight: 76kg\n\nDOB: 7 November, 1967\n\nLook up the word ‘journeyman’ in the AFL Dictionary is a picture of Mark Athorn, sitting next to other 4-clubbers such as Stuart Wigney, Adrian Fletcher and Phil Carman. Athorn, who wore the number 25 for the Blues, played 17 games for the Dogs, 21 for Fitzroy and 15 for the Swans before coming to Carlton at the end of 1991, he had originally started out with Essendon U/19’s.\n\nGeoff Southby\n\nCareer: 1971- 1984\n\nDebut: Round 1, 1971 v North Melbourne\n\n825th Carlton Player\n\nGames: 268\n\nGoals: 31\n\nLast game: Round 20, 1984 v North Melbourne\n\nGuernsey No. 20\n\nHeight: 188cm\n\nWeight: 86kg\n\nDOB: 27 October, 1950\n\nBest and Fairest: 1971, 1972\n\nVice-Captain 1974, 1981-83\n\nVictorian Representative Player\n\nTeam of the Century: Back Pocket\n\nPremiership Player: 1972, 1979\n\nMost of the current Carlton faithful agree that Stephen Silvagni was deservedly named as the AFL’s Fullback of the Century. However there are plenty of Blues’ supporters of a more mature vintage willing to argue that Geoff Southby could just as easily have been given the nod. That’s how good this rangy, mop-haired, consumate defender was.\n\nFrom Bendigo League club Sandhurst, Southby arrived at Carlton in late 1970 as a 20 year-old, and was revelation from his first practice game. At 188cm and 87kg he was the perfect build for a key defender of that era. Wearing the number 20 guernsey, he forced his way into the reigning Premiership team for round one of 1971, and a star was born.\n\nSouthby had stopped playing footy in his mid teens (U/15’s) and concentrated on his first sporting love – baseball! He was coaxed back into playing footy by mates at the hostel he was staying at in Melbourne whilst studying. He didnt take long to make his mark by winning the best and fairest with amateur club Powerhouse FC in 1969, and then at Sandhurst in 1970. In 1972, after his first two years at VFL level, he had won best and fairests in his last four seasons of football, an extraordinary effort in anyone’s language.\n\nBeautifully balanced and with wonderful reflexes, Southby was a strong mark and a gloriously long kick. But his defensive instinct and coolness under pressure were perhaps his greatest attributes. He invariably made the right decision to mark, or to punch the ball away, and he always seemed to have that split-second longer to dispose of the ball – as all champions do. Indicative of his impact at Princes Park, he won Carlton’s Best & Fairest in his first season as the Blues missed the finals, then won the same award again in 1972 as Carlton crushed Richmond in the Grand Final. It was Carlton’s eleventh VFL Premiership.\n\nBy 1973, Geoff was firmly established among the elite of the competition. He had refined his game to become more attacking whenever possible, and his soaring torpedo punts were a real offensive weapon. Such was his influence that at times some opposing teams actually placed a defender at full-forward in an attempt to nullify him!\n\nFollowing their defeat in ’72, Richmond were burning for revenge when they met Carlton again in the 1973 Grand Final. Led by ruckman Neil Balme, the Tigers went head-hunting on a day when an act of sheer football bastardry occurred that has never been forgiven. Southby was crashed to the ground by an elbow to the head that he didn’t see coming, and the resulting concussion was so severe that he was a passenger for the rest of the day. In fact it was well into the next season before he fully recovered. Richmond won the flag, but lost all respect.\n\nA teaching colleague of mine and an avid Geelong supporter, declares that Southby was the best fullback he ever saw. He remembers the first day he saw Southby at Kardinia Park when he stood the great Doug Wade and mastered him with a cool efficiency that was to become his trademark. My colleague is still appalled by Neil Balme’s unprovoked and cowardly attack upon one of football’s fairest and best players.\n\nThankfully, by 1975 Geoff was back to his brilliant best and was selected in the Victorian State team for the third time. Carlton made the finals in ’75, ’76 & ’78 without progressing past the semi-finals, before new captain-coach Alex Jesaulenko led a resurgent Blues outfit into the 1979 Grand Final against Collingwood. When Wayne Harmes‘ desperate slide and swipe at the ball in the dying minutes of that game led to a Ken Sheldon goal and a famous victory, Carlton had won its twelfth flag and Geoff Southby his second Premiership medal.\n\nPeter Bosustow\n\nCareer : 1981 – 1983\n\nDebut: Round 1, 1981 vs Richmond, aged 23 years, 152 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 888\n\nGames : 65\n\nGoals : 146\n\nLast Game: Round 21, 1983 vs North Melbourne, aged 25 years, 296 days\n\nGuernsey No. 4\n\nHeight : 183 cm (6 ft. 0 in.)\n\nWeight : 85 kg (13 stone, 5 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 27 October, 1957\n\nPremiership Player 1981, 1982\n\nClub Leading Goalkicker 1981 (59 goals)\n\nIn the summer of 1980-81, Peter “The Buzz” Bosustow arrived at Princes Park for pre-season training – and a relatively short, yet unforgettable career was cleared for lift off. Peter was the son of Bob Bosustow, who came from WAFL club, Perth to play 20 games for Carlton in seasons 1955 and ’56. So it was that when Bob‘s 183 cm, 85 kg son began to dominate the WAFL competition in the late 1970’s, the Blues had the inside running for his signature. After flying him to their round 9 Sunday game against Essendon in Sydney, the Blues signed him under the Father-Son rule then in place.\n\nBosustow simply gatecrashed a strong Carlton squad that just two years previously had won the flag, and in 1980 should have made it two in a row. Under new coach David Parkin the Blues were hell-bent on claiming our 13th Premiership in 1981, and had assembled a team that was the envy of every other club in the competition. Parkin‘s coaching style demanded discipline in all aspects of the game, but to his credit he realised that in The Buzz he had a rare talent. One that flourished under less restraint; that responded to a personal challenge, and that more often than not could wrest the initiative from any rival with just a quarter or two of football magic.\n\nOften unstoppable as a free-running half-forward, Bosustow was a freakish mark, a brilliant ground-level player and a deadly snapshot at goal. The highlight tapes of seasons 1981 to ’83 are filled with his exploits, including awards for Mark of the Year and Goal of the Year. Bosustow himself talks about his great mark here .\n\nLegend has it that the Buzz promised Mark Maclure that he would give him a ride in his new car before he took his 1981 screamer. He was a crucial part of our glorious 1981 and ’82 Premiership double, and our Leading Goalkicker with 59 goals in 1981. People flocked to see him in action, and he was one of the brightest stars of his era.\n\nIn only his second game – during the second quarter of Carlton’s Round 2, 1981 match against Hawthorn at Princes Park, Carlton was kicking to the scoreboard end. ‘Buzz’ marked on the wing, chip-passed to Wayne Johnston and sprinted hard to create the loose man. His opponent – Hawthorn’s tough man Robert Dipierdomenico – ran in to block him, but Bosustow crashed through the beefy Hawk with a punishing, legitimate shirtfront, right in front of the old press box. A resounding crack was heard (to the roar of an adoring throng) and Dipper’s season was prematurely ended by a broken sternum.\n\nThe Round 21 game against North Melbourne would turn out to be a last hurrah for the Buzz. He was reported for striking North Melbourne defender John Law, and subsequently rubbed out for four weeks. This meant that he could only have played again that year if Carlton had made the Grand Final – but it was not to be. In what turned out to be a prophetic statement, a clearly upset Bosustow mentioned after his tribunal appearance that “I am absolutely shattered, when the sentence was delivered I thought my career in Melbourne was all over”. He was just 26 years old, and at the peak of his career.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player pics and bios.\n\nKen Hands: HAPPY 85th BIRTHDAY!\n\nCareer : 1945 – 1957\n\nDebut : Round 5, 1945 v St Kilda, aged 18 years, 205 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 606\n\nGames : 211\n\nGoals : 188\n\nLast Game: Semi Final, 1957 v Hawthorn, aged 30 years, 309 days\n\nGuernsey No. 1\n\nHeight : 185 cm (6 ft. 1 in.)\n\nWeight : 85 kg (13 stone, 5 lbs)\n\nDOB : 26 October, 1926\n\nPremiership Player : 1945 & 1947\n\nBest and Fairest : 1953\n\nCaptain : 1952-1957\n\nCaptain of Victoria : 1957\n\nCarlton Coach : 1959 – 1964\n\nCarlton Hall of Fame: 1988\n\nTeam of the Century\n\nAnother of the pivotal figures in the proud history of the Carlton Football Club, Ken Hands left an indelible mark on, and off the field at Princes Park. A two-time Premiership player, state representative, Best & Fairest winner and inspirational captain, Hands played 211 games and kicked 188 goals in twelve seasons beginning in the last months of World War II. Later, he became embroiled in a long and bitter wrangle with Jim Francis, while both were bidding to coach the Blues.\n\nTo the chagrin of Geelong Football Club, Carlton recruited Hands from right under their noses in 1944. As the conflict in Europe and the Pacific drew to a close, the 17 year-old key forward was playing impressive football for amateur side Geelong Scouts. The Cats had had Ken in their sights for months, but it was Carlton who pounced first with a firm offer – including the prestige of wearing guernsey number 1 for the Blues. In his senior debut in round 5 of the ‘45 season, against St Kilda – Carlton won a tough match by 11 points. Hands took some strong marks and kicked two goals at centre half-forward. When the siren sounded after that match, Carlton coach Percy Bentley knew that he had something special in the long-striding, 185 cm, 85 kg youngster.\n\nCarlton lost the first three games of 1945, before a late-season revival brought ten wins in the last eleven matches. The Blues went into the finals in third place, but with some advantage, because the final series was to be played at Princes Park, while the MCG was being used as a transit camp for US forces bound for the war in the Pacific. Carlton struck top form at the right time, beating North Melbourne and Collingwood in successive weeks to earn a shot at South Melbourne in the Grand Final. Our Preliminary Final win over Collingwood was a hard, often spiteful clash, and a real portent of things to come. Bruised and battered, Carlton won on heart alone. For this reason, the fresher South Melbourne team went into the decider as warm favourites.\n\nA ground record of almost 63,000 spectators packed into Princes Park on that Grand Final day. At just 18 years of age, and playing his eighteenth senior match, Hands faced the biggest challenge of his blossoming career at centre half-forward. As expected, the physical intimidation wasn’t long in coming. Carlton were in front by 11 points when the match erupted in the second quarter. “I had taken a mark about fifteen yards out and kicked a goal,” Hands explained later. “While the ball was being taken back to the centre, Jim Cleary knocked me out cold. He must have done a good job because I didn’t actually feel it. In those days you only had a nineteenth man and ours was already on, so I had to keep playing. But I don’t remember anything until about ten minutes before the end of the game, when Perce Bentley, who was in the coaches box just behind the goals, whistled me to drop back into the goal square and I suddenly realised it was raining. That game was quite an initiation, and I’m still paying the price for it – I lost a tooth.” In fact he lost two teeth – to go with his broken nose and split lip!\n\nSeemingly oblivious to the battle raging around him, Ken ended the game with three goals in Carlton’s 28-point victory. Infamously remembered as the “Bloodbath” Grand Final, in all, ten players (including Hands) were reported after the match. Eight were found guilty, and suspended for a total of 68 weeks. Hands was one of the two acquitted.\n\nThat tempestuous debut season helped forge Hands into a tough, team-oriented performer. Always a well balanced ball-handler, he was a superb mark for his size and a long, accurate kick – particularly when drop-kicking on the run. He became a leader by example, and while no heavyweight, he was a willing protector of his smaller team-mates. In 1947 he won his second Premiership medal when Carlton beat Essendon after an epic Grand Final struggle. Essendon had nine more scoring shots than the Blues, but rover Fred Stafford snapped a glorious goal with just 44 seconds left on the clock to give Carlton victory by one point.\n\nJohn Gill: HAPPY 70th BIRTHDAY!\n\nCareer : 1962 – 1967\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1962 vs Geelong, aged 20 years, 177 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 745\n\nGames : 88\n\nGoals : 38\n\nLast Game : Round 13, 1967 vs Hawthorn, aged 25 years, 268 days\n\nGuernsey No. 12\n\nHeight : 180 cm (5 ft. 11 in.)\n\nWeight : 80 kg (12 stone, 7 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 26 October, 1941\n\nBest First Year Player 1962\n\nJohn Gill was a player with an impressive football pedigree. The nephew of Frank Gill (Carlton’s champion full-back of the 1930’s), he was also the older brother of 1968 and 1970 Carlton Premiership player Barry Gill. After completing an impressive debut season in 1962, John should have gone on to play 100 games or more for the Navy Blues – had injury not brought a premature end to his VFL career at the age of only 25.\n\nGill was recruited from Casterton in Western Victoria, and wore guernsey number 12 for the Navy Blues for the first time at senior level in a landmark clash against Geelong at Princes Park in round one, 1962. The Cats’ boom WA recruit, Graham ‘Polly’ Farmer, also made his long-awaited debut that afternoon, only to wreck a knee in the first few minutes of the game. However, Farmer stayed on the field, and limped to a forward pocket, where he kicked four goals and led his team to a big win over Carlton by 39 points.\n\nGill played out that match on a half-forward flank, where his determination and straight-ahead style stood out. From then on, he held his place in the side right through the year, as the Navy Blues battled through to fourth place on the ladder. Three desperately hard-fought finals ensued; a two-point Semi Final win over Melbourne, a famous draw with Geelong in the Preliminary Final, and a dramatic five-point victory over the Cats in a highly-controversial replay. Not surprisingly, those three epics took their toll, and on Grand Final day the valiant Navy Blues were never really in contention against Essendon, losing by six goals. Gill finished his maiden season with 19 matches and twelve goals to his credit, and was a popular winner of Carlton’s Best First Year Player award.\n\nFrom the highs of 1962, the Navy Blues fell into a slump over the following three seasons, before the coaching coup of the century brought former Melbourne champion Ron Barassi to Princes Park in the summer of 1964-’65. Earlier that same year, John and Barry Gill were reunited on the football field when they played together for the first time as Blues, against Hawthorn at Glenferrie Oval in round 2.\n\nUnder Barassi, John Gill developed into a tenacious, hard-working half-back. He was encouraged to seize the initiative, and became adept at wrong-footing opponents by often playing on as soon as he took one of his strong marks. By 1967, Carlton was once again looming as a finals contender, and Johnny had become an asset in defence or attack. Then disaster struck in the opening game of the season, when he tore a knee cartilage in Carlton’s huge win over Fitzroy at Princes Park.\n\nSidelined for a month, John eventually returned to the side for a handful of games with his knee heavily strapped. But his customary zip was missing, and another knock on the same leg in round 13 against Hawthorn did further damage. Over the next six months, while Barassi’s Blues climbed back toward the top of the VFL ladder, Gill was under constant medical treatment. Sadly, it was all in vain, and on doctor’s advice he retired at the end of that year.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player pics and bios.\n\nIan Collins\n\nCareer : 1961 – 1971\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1961 vs St Kilda, aged 18 years, 173 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 737\n\nGames : 161\n\nGoals : 49\n\nLast Game : Round 22, 1971 vs Collingwood, aged 28 years, 308 days\n\nGuernsey No. 19\n\nHeight : 175 cm ( 5 ft. 9 in.)\n\nWeight : 73.5 kg (11 stone, 8 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 24 October, 1942\n\nPremiership Player 1968\n\nCarlton Hall of Fame (2001)\n\nPresident: 2003 – 2006\n\nA courageous, uncompromising back pocket in the Blues’ 1968 Premiership team, Ian Collins went on to serve as Secretary-Manager and President through some of Carlton Football Club’s most successful, and later, most turbulent times.\n\nAfter rejecting overtures from St Kilda and Melbourne, Collins arrived at Princes Park in 1960. He was widely regarded as a ready-made league footballer following an impressive junior career at his home town of Sale in Gippsland, from where he had starred in various representative teams as a quick and skilful centreman or half-forward flanker. At 175 cm and 74 kg he struggled at first to cement a regular place in a team not short of smaller, pacey types, until he was tried as a back pocket in his second year. Almost immediately, he made the last line his territory, and began forging a reputation as a courageous and difficult opponent in the number 19 guernsey.\n\nIn 1962 Carlton made the finals after many years in the football wilderness, and played Geelong in the Preliminary Final for the right to meet Essendon for the flag. In a willing, sometimes spiteful encounter, Collins suffered a broken jaw and a split tongue. Carlton won the match, so Collins was determined he would be playing the following week. Somehow, he managed to conceal the severity of the injury, and was far from our worst performer. Essendon, however proved too good.\n\nSix years on, Carlton met the Bombers again for the 1968 Premiership, and turned the tables to claim our first flag in 21 seasons. Collins was solid as always on a great day when wingman Garry Crane was the Blues’ best in a hard-fought three point win. Alongside Collins at full-back as usual was Wes Lofts, and the duo were a daunting proposition. Later, Lofts served as the Blues’ Chairman of Selectors for many years, and he and Collins forged a strong partnership at board level.\n\nCollins might well have collected a second Premiership medal if he had not suffered a serious achilles tendon tear that cost him the entire 1970 football season. While it was a severe blow to his sporting aspirations, the forced holiday did have an upside, in that “Collo” was at least able to complete his tertiary studies in accountancy. The skills he acquired were to prove more than handy when he announced his retirement from league football following the 1971 final series. He was 29, with 161 games and 49 goals to his credit. He spent the following season of 1972 as captain-coach of VFA club Port Melbourne (where one of his players was his former coach at Carlton, Ron Barassi), then hung up his boots for good to prepare for bigger things.\n\nIn 1981 Collo was appointed Secretary-Manager of the Carlton Football Club, a position he filled with distinction for twelve years. In this time the Blues won three more flags. In 1993 he became the AFL Director of Football Operations, and in 1999 was appointed CEO of Stadium Operations Ltd, responsible for the AFL’s showpiece Docklands Stadium (Telstra Dome). He was elected to the Carlton Hall of Fame in 2001, and awarded an Order of Australia for his service to the game.\n\nPeter Sartori\n\nCareer : 1987 – 1991\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1987 vs Hawthorn, aged 22 years, 154 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 941\n\nGames : 57\n\nGoals : 114\n\nLast Game : Round 24, 1991 vs Richmond, aged 26 years, 310 days\n\nGuernsey No. 18\n\nHeight : 195 cm (6 ft. 4 in.)\n\nWeight : 92 kg ( 14 stone, 7 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 24 October, 1964\n\nAnother in a long list of VFL/AFL footballers in the category of “could have been anything, but for injury,” West Australian Peter Sartori spent eight seasons with Carlton and Fitzroy between 1987 and 1994, yet managed only 77 games all up. A tall ruckman-forward, he had rare ability and all the physical attributes needed, but sadly, his body let him down with monotonous regularity.\n\nSartori was just 17 when he played his first senior match for Swan Districts, and 18 when he suffered his first major injury – a ruptured kidney – which kept him out of the Swans’ 1982 Premiership side. When he did eventually return to the field however, he clicked into rare form. His marking skill, versatility and intuitive reading of the play made him a driving force in both of the Swans’ follow-up flag victories in 1983 and ’84. By 1986 he had represented WA twice, won his club’s Best and Fairest award, and well and truly caught the eye of just about every AFL club.\n\nCarlton won the contest for his signature, and Sartori came to Princes Park to augment a growing contingent of star forwards with WA origins – a group that would eventually include Peter Bosustow, Ross Ditchburn, Warren Ralph, Jon Dorotich, Richard Dennis and Earl Spalding. Yet competition for places was fierce, as the club also had Stephen Kernahan, Simon Minton-Connell and Warren McKenzie on its books at the time.\n\nSartori was assigned guernsey number 18, and made his debut for the Blues in round 1, 1987, against Hawthorn at Princes Park. His first half-dozen games were rather unremarkable, before he strained a hamstring to cut short his progress, and didn’t return to the seniors until late in the season. Then, in only his eighth game, the big Sandgroper showed what he was capable of when he and his captain, Stephen Kernahan went on a rampage against Geelong at Kardinia Park, and kicked a massive 15 goals between them. ‘Sticks’ booted eight, and Sartori contributed seven in a display of forward power that had Carlton supporters in rapture.\n\nThat joy lasted for only a fortnight – until the first week of the finals. After a torrid year, the Blues had claimed the minor premiership, and met Hawthorn in what proved to be the defining match of the season in the second Semi Final. Trailing by 15 points at the main break, Carlton stormed home to win by that same margin – but at a cost. Sartori’s hamstring tore again, and his year was prematurely ended. He had kicked one goal on the day, and set up two others with skilful palming of the ball to Johnston and Naley. The Johnston goal came from a clever flip over the back of the pack to the Dominator, who goaled with a right foot snap. In the following quarter at the main scoreboard end, Sartori deftly palmed the ball to Naley in heavy traffic, and his clever snap brought up another telling goal. Both of those scores were the direct result of clever ruckwork by the big West Australian, and showed that it was a much-underrated facet of his game. However, that was all academic in the end, because he could only watch on in frustration two weeks later, when his team decisively beat the Hawks yet again in the Grand Final.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player profiles and pics.\n\nCraig Bradley\n\nCareer : 1986 – 2002\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1986 vs Hawthorn, aged 22 years, 159 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 931\n\nGames : 375\n\nGoals : 247\n\nLast Game : Round 19, 2002 vs Port Adelaide, aged 38 years, 291 days\n\nGuernsey No. 21\n\nHeight : 182 cm (5 ft. 11 in.)\n\nWeight : 81 kg (12 stone, 11 lbs.)\n\nDOB : 23 October, 1963\n\nPremiership Player : 1987, 1995\n\nCarlton Legend\n\nCarlton Hall of Fame : 1995\n\nBest and Fairest: 1986, 1988, 1993\n\nAll Australian: 1986, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997\n\nCaptain: 1998-2002\n\nTeam of the Century: Wing\n\nInternational Rules Series vs Ireland : 2000, 2001 (captain), 2002\n\nOff the field, Craig Bradley was a somewhat quiet, unassuming character who never hungered for the spotlight. But when the umpire’s whistle blew for a game of Australian football, he became a consummate professional whose outstanding ball-winning ability, accurate disposal, punishing non-stop running and longevity in the game made him one of the all-time greats. “Braddles” captained the Blues for three years, won two AFL Premierships, and picked up almost every possible honour in a stellar career that spanned 17 seasons and a record 375 games for the Carlton Football Club.\n\nHe began his football journey at Pooraka in outer-suburban Adelaide, where his father was coach of the Under-19 team. Craig was a standout junior footballer, and in 1981 he was recruited by SANFL club Port Adelaide. At the same time, Essendon also made a big pitch for his signature. The Bombers were very intent on getting him to Windy Hill, but Bradley wasn’t then ready to make the big move interstate.\n\nEssendon redoubled their efforts after Bradley’s sensational debut year for Port Adelaide, which culminated in the Magpies’ 51-point demolition of Glenelg in the Grand Final. Playing on a wing, but roaming the length of the ground, 17 year-old Bradley was one of his team’s best. He followed up by winning Port’s Best and Fairest in 1982, before departing for England later that year, as a member of the Australian Under-19 cricket team. Cricket was Braddles’ other great sporting passion, and he would eventually play two Sheffield Shield games each for South Australia and Victoria, before giving the game away to further his football ambitions.\n\nBecause of his cricketing commitments, Bradley missed most of the 1983 pre-season with Port, but it made little difference, because he had another dominant season for the Magpies and was named All Australian for the first time. Two more Port Adelaide Best and Fairests followed in 1984 and ’85 – with the latter complemented by All Australian honours again.\n\nIn that year of 1985, four South Australians were named as All Australians; Bradley, Stephen Kernahan, Peter Motley and John Platten – and to the chagrin and envy of every other VFL club (especially Essendon) the first three all signed to play with Carlton. In the following year that trio of stars took to VFL football like they were born to it, and a time of bubbling confidence began for the Old Dark Navy Blues.\n\nBraddles wasted little time in announcing his arrival into the upper echelons of our national game by playing in the 1986 Grand Final in his debut season at Princes Park; the same year he won his first Carlton Best and Fairest award in a tie with Wayne Johnston. The Blues lost heavily to Hawthorn on Grand Final day, but twelve months later bounced back to snatch the 1987 flag from the Hawks in Bradley’s 47th senior match.\n\nBy then, he was already a budding champion whose amazing stamina was too much for almost every opponent. He simply ran his taggers into the ground, and he was as effective in the last minutes of a game as he was at the start. He won two more Carlton Best and Fairest awards in 1988 and 1993, and by the end of his superb career had been an All Australian six times.\n\nAged 32, he picked up his second Premiership winner’s medallion in 1995 when the unstoppable Kernahan-led Blues demolished Geelong in a one-sided Grand Final, but those who thought he might retire after that triumph were right off the mark. He still had his zip, his footy smarts and his brilliant foot skills, and he had transformed himself from a purely attacking weapon into an equally-effective sweeper across half-back. And to cap off a memorable season, he became one of only a handful of players to be inducted into the Carlton Hall of Fame while still playing out their career.\n\nIn 1997, at the age of 34, Bradley won the Sunday Age Footballer of the Year award. ”It’s not the end of the world when you reach 30,” he said in a blunt response to those who kept asking how long he intended going on – to his considerable annoyance.\n\nAfter being named All Australian yet again that year, he answered all those sorts of questions when he was appointed captain of his beloved Blues in 1998 – after the retirement of his great mate ‘Sticks’ Kernahan. Braddles led the Blues into another Grand Final in 1999, but the Wayne Carey-inspired Kangaroos proved just too good.\n\nJason Saddington\n\nCarlton Career: 2006 – 2008\n\nDebut: Round 3, 2006 v Sydney (Carlton)\n\nCarlton Player No. 1 092\n\nGames: 20 (Overall 162)\n\nGoals: 6 (Overall 47)\n\nLast game: Round 20, 2008 v Port Adelaide\n\nGuernsey No. 9\n\nHeight: 193cm\n\nWeight: 94kg\n\nDOB: 23 October, 1979\n\nJason Saddington was picked up by Carlton in a trade for a 4th round draft pick with the Sydney Swans. Given the Number 9 guernsey, ‘Saddo’ was released by the Swans after being in the Harbour City for 9 years. He was originally drafted pick 11 in 1997. He was a Rising Star nominee in 1998.\n\nAt 193cm, and with 142 games of AFL experience, there was a hope that Saddington could hold down a key defensive post at Carlton, or in the least, provide a buffer of strength and learning before our young defenders could stake a permanent claim.\n\nSaddington made his debut for Carlton in Round 3, 2006 against his former team, kicking a goal but spending much of the game at interchange. ‘Saddo’ would only manage to play a further 5 games for the Blues in 2006, having to battle readjustment to AFL football and a continuing troublesome knee, which would require further work and his season would end prematurely, surely disappointing the player and the Club.\n\nSaddington would play his first game for 2007 in Round 7 as a late replacement for Bret Thornton, who succumbed to a shin injury. Saddington was a key player in defence with 12 marks. One week later, Saddington would bring up his 150th AFL game against the Kangaroos at Carrarra – 8 for the Blues and 142 for the Swans.\n\nJason’s season seemed to improve under new coach Brett Ratten, who allowed him to play occasionally as a loose man in defence where he chopped off numerous opposition attacks and created play out of the backline. Overall he would play 12 games in 2007, and would find himself on occasion later in the season as the most senior (by age) Blue out there.\n\nWith a move to youth in 2008, many supporters may have thought his time at Carlton was up, but our lack of tall defenders saw Saddington get a surprising call-up to play in the Round 19 66-point victory over reigning Grand Finalists Port Adelaide. Saddington was given the job on young forward Justin Westhoff and managed to keep him to only one goal. Saddington was also selected the week after, but it would be his final AFL / Carlton game, with him retiring at the end of the season.\n\nSaddington finished with 162 games, a great effort from a popular player.\n\nSaddington won the Northern Bullants ‘Laurie Hill Trophy’ for their best and fairest player in 2008 and was an assistant coach and an valuable player when the ‘Ants were runners up in the 2009 grand final. Saddington headed back to NSW at the end of 2009, he signed with the Balmain FC for the 2010 season.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player pics and bios.\n\nDan Beauvais\n\nCareer : 1945\n\nDebut: Round 8, 1945 vs Geelong, aged 24 years, 232 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 607\n\nGames : 4\n\nGoals : 5\n\nLast Game : Round 12, 1945 vs Melbourne, aged 24 years, 260 days\n\nGuernsey No. 17\n\nHeight : 187 cm (6 ft. 1 in.)\n\nWeight : 86 kg ( 13 stone, 8 lbs.)\n\nDOB: 20 October, 1920\n\nDan Beauvais had a brief 4-game career at Princes Park in 1945 – one of the most tumultuous years in history. It was the year when World War II finally ended with the atomic bombing of two Japanese cities, and when the Carlton football club won a famous, controversial seventh VFL flag in the ‘Bloodbath’ Grand Final victory over South Melbourne.\n\nOne of ten young men to wear the Old Dark Navy Blue for the first time in 1945 was Dan Beauvais, a 24 year-old from Jeparit who did well when he came off the bench and kicked two goals in Carlton’s good win over Geelong at Kardinia Park in round 8.\n\nBeauvais was rewarded with a place in one forward pocket the following week (alongside Lance Collins and Ron Hines) and put through another three majors during Carlton’s 9-point loss to Footscray at Princes Park. After this sixth loss of the year, the Blues were languishing in ninth place on the ladder, well out of finals contention.\n\nHowever, a shock win over second -placed North Melbourne at Arden Street in round 10 revived the Blues spirit, especially when Collins returned to form at full-forward and kicked six terrific goals. Beauvais didn’t trouble the scorers that afternoon, but was still a little unlucky to lose his place in the side when the versatile Ken Baxter returned from injury the next week, and Carlton at home beat South Melbourne by six points.\n\nBeauvais spent just that one week in the seconds before he was recalled as 19th man for round 12 against Melbourne. He sat on the pine throughout the game, even as Melbourne rattled home, kicking 4.1 to Carlton’s 2.1 in the last quarter at Punt Road. The Blues held on to win by 1 point, and moved to within 8 points of the top four.\n\nEven so, Beauvais was apparently dissatisfied with his progress at Carlton, and soon afterward decided to switch clubs to Hawthorn. Carlton wanted him to stay, and the matter dragged on for some weeks until Dan was eventually released. Thereafter, while the Blues continued climbing the mountain toward the finals and eventually succeeded, Beauvais joined the Hawks, and played another seven matches before retiring in 1946.\n\nPeter Jones\n\nPlaying Career : 1966 – 1979\n\nDebut : Round 16, 1966 Aged 19 years 297 days\n\n790th Carlton Player\n\nGames : 249\n\nGoals : 284\n\nLast Game : Grand Final, 1979 Aged 32 years 344 days\n\nGuernsey No. 28\n\nHeight : 198 cm (6’6″)\n\nWeight : 109 kgs (17.2)\n\nDOB : October 20, 1946\n\nPremiership Player: 1968, 1970, 1972, 1979\n\nBest and Fairest: 1973\n\nB. J. Deacon Memorial Trophy -Best Clubman Award : 1978\n\nVictorian Representative: 1977\n\nCarlton Hall of Fame (1988)\n\nHe was part actor, part comedian and an all round quality footballer. Peter ‘Percy’ Jones is one of the truly unique characters in the long history of the Carlton Football Club. His unbounded enthusiasm on the field – and his legendary exploits off it – endeared the lanky Tasmanian to generations of Blues’ fans.\n\nJones joined Carlton from North Hobart in 1966. He was a 20 year-old, 194 cm ruckman with considerable promise, however a serious car accident soon after his arrival – in which he injured both legs – was a portent of things to come. Happily, he recovered in time to play the last three games of the year and showed enough for new coach Ron Barassi to retain him.\n\nBy 1968 ‘Percy’ had settled into the senior team as understudy to John Nicholls. He found his niche in a forward pocket, where his strong marking and accurate kicking was invaluable. And it was about then that his obvious joy at every Carlton goal – whether it be kicked by himself or a team-mate – began to be noticed. As soon as a Blues players’ shot for goal was on its way, Percy would be clapping and cheering – even if it was obviously going to miss. And his Charlie Chaplin-like bewilderment when a free kick was awarded against him was hilarious. He was a handy part of both the 1968 and 1970 Premiership teams, then the Jones legend really started rolling.\n\nIn August 1971 at the Junction Oval in St Kilda, Carlton were playing Fitzroy in a game crucial to The Blues’ finals chances. The match started in sunshine, but just after the half-time break a thick fog rolled over the ground from nearby Port Phillip Bay. It was so dense that players only a metre or so apart couldn’t see each other. They relied on their ears more than their eyes, while the time keepers caught only glimpses of the players and had to rely on the emergency umpire to relay the few additional scores. Late in the quarter, the ball came bouncing past Percy, who had dropped back into defence. ‘There it is!’, he shouted – and a Fitzroy opponent pounced on the ball and goaled. Carlton lost an extraordinary game, and missed that year’s Finals by two points!\n\nPercy was quickly forgiven however, when he proved his blossoming talent with a dominant display against a powerhouse Richmond in the 1972 Grand Final. The Tigers went in as hot favourites after drawing with, then beating Carlton in the second semi. The Blues then had to win a tight Preliminary Final against St Kilda, while Richmond had a week off. John Nicholls had replaced Barassi as Carlton’s coach and decided on a bold strategy in the decider. He made eight positional changes, including placing himself at full-forward and handing Percy the daunting task of first ruck. Then he told the Blues to attack at all times and to ignore the inevitable defensive errors and turnovers.\n\nThe plan and the switches worked brilliantly, and Carlton won by 27 points in the highest-scoring Grand Final ever. Jones was superb all afternoon, rucking unchanged to dominate the Tigers’ big men, while Nicholls himself bagged six goals. If there had been a Norm Smith medal available that day, Percy would have won it. With his confidence boosted, ‘Perce’ was consistently good throughout 1973 and deservedly won the Blues’ Best & Fairest award. On the field, his exuberance was at its height. The Carlton faithful loved his antics while he drove the opposition to distraction.\n\nOn one famous occasion, he played on after a mark in the goal square. But as he tried to guide the ball on to his boot, he missed – and kicked the goal post! On another, he lit a firecracker in the Carlton Social Club while Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was watching a game – and terrified the PM’s minders. Late in his career, he was struggling to keep up in a pre-season training run when a tram appeared, and Perce hopped on board. He might have gotten away with it, too – except that Carlton’s fitness adviser at the time saw him get off!\n\nJones’ career culminated with the 1979 Premiership. By then aged almost 33 and somewhat in the shadow of future captain Mike Fitzpatrick, Perce responded to his captain-coach Alex Jesaulenko, who challenged the big bloke to show his doubters that he wasn’t a spent force. Perce gave his all that day; more than holding his own in the ruck as the Blues knocked over Collingwood by five points – thanks to some last-gasp brilliance by Wayne Harmes.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player pics and bios.\n\nMartin Cross\n\nCareer : 1961 – 1963\n\nDebut : Round 1, 1961 vs St Kilda, aged 21 years, 178 days\n\nCarlton Player No. 738\n\nGames : 36\n\nGoals : 36\n\nLast Game: Round 13, 1963 vs St Kilda, aged 23 years, 288 days\n\nGuernsey No. 23\n\nHeight : 175 cm (5 ft. 9 in.)\n\nWeight : 72.5 kg (11 stone, 6 lbs.)\n\nDOB : October 19, 1939\n\nMartin Cross had a relatively short, but interesting career with Carlton in the early nineteen-sixties, during which he played in a couple of the most controversial matches in club history. A lightly-built, elusive rover from North Ballarat, he averaged a goal a game in his 36 appearances for the Blues, and was 20th man in the 1962 Grand Final. After leaving Princes Park, he returned to playing and coaching in the bush, and became an Ovens & Murray League legend.\n\nPrior to joining Carlton, Cross played 96 senior games with North Ballarat, beginning in 1956 at the age of 17. Four years later he was invited to Princes Park, where he wore guernsey number 23 when he made his senior debut against St Kilda at the Junction Oval in the first round of the 1961 season. Also on debut that day were future club President Ian Collins, and another star full-forward for the Blues in Tom Carroll. Carlton recovered from a poor first quarter to beat the Saints by 10 points, with Carroll kicking the first five goals of his all-too-short career.\n\nMartin featured often throughout his first year, and added to his value by being dangerous around the goals. After hauls of four majors in round 3 against Footscray, and three in round 8 against Richmond, he made the competition as a whole sit up and take notice when he booted eight goals to rout South Melbourne at Princes Park in round 15 – although even that super effort was overshadowed by the infamous clash between rival ruckmen John Nicholls of Carlton, and Ken Boyd of South Melbourne. Boyd king-hit Nicholls off the ball, and later admitted doing so to a newspaper reporter. He was charged by the VFL, found guilty, and never played at the top level again.\n\nCross found the going harder in his second year, when he was asked to play more often as a wingman or half-forward flanker, and his goal-kicking fell away. However, Carlton improved markedly from eighth place in 1961 to fourth in ‘62, and set themselves up for a tilt at another flag by edging out Melbourne in the first Semi Final. Martin warmed the bench in all four of Carlton’s finals matches – including our highly controversial victory over Geelong in the Preliminary Final replay, and the following week’s Grand Final clash against Essendon. Fit and well-rested, the Bombers won the 1962 flag by 62 points over the wrung-out Blues.\n\nCarlton slipped down the ladder again in 1963, and by round 13 our chances of making the finals again were all but shot. Cross played only his fifth game of the season that afternoon, and no doubt trudged off the Junction Oval in a gloomy mood after St Kilda whipped a lethargic Carlton team by 41 points. Although he saw out the season at Princes Park, that game against the Saints turned out to be Martin’s last for Carlton – but he was far from finished with the game.\n\nDuring the next 21 years, Cross played 160 games for Myrtleford Football Club and coached them to an Ovens & Murray League Premiership in 1970. Between 1972 and 1975 he coached the Dederang Bombers in the Tallangatta and District League, before returning to the O&MFL with North Albury.\n\nHe coached the Hoppers to a famous victory in the 1984 Grand Final against Wodonga, and lifted them back into another flag decider against Lavington two years later. On that occasion however, Lavington were far too good.\n\nAll up, Cross coached 378 home and away games, and 14 finals at his three clubs. The longest-serving coach in Ovens & Murray League history, he remains a household name in the Riverina.\n\nPeter Brown\n\nCareer : 1976 – 1980\n\nDebut: Round 12, 1976 v Collingwood\n\nCarlton Player No. 860\n\nGames : 35\n\nGoals : 38\n\nLast Game: Round 12, 1980 vs Collingwood\n\nGuernsey No. 41\n\nHeight : 184cm\n\nWeight : 85kg\n\nDOB : 19 October, 1958\n\nPremiership Player: 1979\n\nPeter Brown was recruited to Carlton in 1976 as an 18 year-old from the tiny central Victorian town of Campbell’s Creek. At 184 cm and 85 kg, it was hoped he might develop into a key forward.\n\nBrowny found the going tough early in his career, then fortuitously struck his best form late in the 1979 season when he provided a real target at full forward. He held his place for the Grand Final, and justified his inclusion as Carlton beat Collingwood by 5 points.\n\nHis form tapered off again in 1980, so after 35 games and 38 goals in the number 41 guernsey for the Blues, Brown was cleared to St Kilda, where he managed another 20 games in two seasons. Peter Brown ended up being cleared to VFA club Coburg for the 1983 season, after a season with the Coburg Lions he was cleared to opposing VFA club Weribee for the 1984 season.\n\nThanks to the Blueseum for player pics and bios."
