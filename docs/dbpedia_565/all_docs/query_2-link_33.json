        "text": "Former Essendon captain, three-time best and fairest and three-time premiership player, Barry Davis was last night inducted into the Essendon Hall of Fame at the annual Dick Reynolds Club cocktail party. He is just the 16th person to be inducted.\n\nDavis, a superb half back flanker and then ruck rover arrived at the Bombers from Essendon High School and debuted in Round 2 1961, starting his career as a half forward.\n\nIt was the beginning of an impressive 12-year career that spanned 218 games and included two Premierships.\n\nWearing the number 32 guernsey, Davis captained Essendon in 1970 and 1971 before becoming vice-captain to Des Tuddenham in 1972. He had also been vice captain in 1969.\n\nDavis was a footballing perfectionist; mild-mannered, unassuming and well behaved on and off the field. He was cool under pressure and had a good combination of pace and strength with outstanding natural talent. Not only was he a brilliant mark but one of the best kicks in the game.\n\nAs part of one of Essendon's greatest ever half back lines with Alex Epis and Ian Shelton he starred on the half back flank in the 1962 premiership win and again in the 1965 premiership victory.\n\nDavis returned to the club in 1978 as senior coach, holding the post until 1980, making his exit after saying he would vacate the position if the Bombers failed to make the finals.\n\nHis career honours included Best First Year Player (1961), Most Consistent Player (1966), Best Team Man (1967), EFC Life member (1970), Team of the Century (1997), Champion of Essendon 2002 (Ranked 15), Runner-up Brownlow Medallist (1969, 1971) and AFL Hall of Fame Inductee (1997).\n\nBarry Davis â€“ The Facts\n\nBorn: 15.09.1943, Clifton Hill\n\nRecruited from: Essendon High School\n\nFirst EFC Game: vs St Kilda, Rd 2 1961\n\nLast EFC Game: vs St Kilda, Elimination Final 1972\n\nEFC Games: 218\n\nEFC Goals: 63\n\nPremiership player: 1962 ,1965\n\nGrand Final appearances: 1962,1965,1968\n\nFinals appearances: 12\n\nEFC Captain: 1970-71 (40 games)\n\nEFC Vice Captain: 1969,1972\n\nEFC Coach: 1978-80\n\nEFC Best & Fairest: 1968, 1969, 1971\n\nTop 5 EFC best & fairest finishes:1968 -1972\n\nTop 5 Brownlow medal finishes: 1969, 1971\n\nVictorian Representative: 1967-1972\n\nCareer Brownlow votes: 96"
