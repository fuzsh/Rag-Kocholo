        "text": "While the Association officially formed in 1973, the traditions of player welfare and unity date as far back as 1911, when the VFL was forced to legalise match payments.\n\nCore issues that related strictly to players continued to accumulate as the years progressed, leading to many attempts to formally create a footballers’ union. Although many were unsuccessful, the momentum was building.\n\nOf course, there were sections of the public who viewed the notion of unionists as trouble-makers, thus lessening the impact of the players’ collective.\n\nIn 1944 another attempt was made when Frank Reid, a former secretary of Essendon and a life member of the VFL, led the push for an organisation of past and present players and called it the Victorian Footballers’ Club. The aim was to promote social welfare and the economic advancement of its members.\n\nIn 1955, the Australian Football Players’ Union was formed following Glasgow-born Tom McNeil’s attempts to establish a players’ union, but they were eventually refused registration due to the VFL, VFA and Essendon Football Club opposing the application.\n\nPayment models have always been a point of contention, and that was brought to a head in 1970 when Essendon players proposed a scheme of standardised payments, based on the number of years of service."
