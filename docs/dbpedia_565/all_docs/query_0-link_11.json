        "text": "Essendon Football Club is today mourning the sad passing of Bombers legend Ian ‘Bluey’ Shelton.\n\nAfter a long battle with illness, Shelton passed away surrounded by family on Wednesday morning at the age of 81.\n\nThe Bombers great played as a centre half-back for 91 games in his six seasons with Essendon between 1959 and 1965, winning two premierships (1962 and 1965) during his established career.\n\nShelton was also named best first-year player in 1959, claimed the Outstanding Services Award for the Bombers in 1962 and was appointed Essendon vice-captain in 1965.\n\nAfter being awarded life membership of the Essendon Football Club in 2005, Shelton was formally inducted into the Bombers’ prestigious Hall of Fame in 2019.\n\nHailing from Avenel in country Victoria, Shelton sparked the interest of local VFL recruiters while playing senior football for Avenel in the 1950s.\n\nRecruited to Essendon, Shelton had to overcome early permit and injury problems in his first year for the Bombers in 1959, but after five years in the system, he missed the 1964 season because of a serious eye injury suffered at the family farm, which led to fears he would lose his sight.\n\nBut Shelton made a miraculous recovery to become a major part of the 1965 premiership side as the Bombers’ vice-captain. Retiring from the VFL at 25, Shelton took up a captain-coach role at Seymour before ending his football career with Avenel, back where it all began.\n\nPaul Doran, Mark Harvey and Xavier Campbell during a trip to visit Ian Shelton (right) in Avenel in February.\n\nPresident Paul Brasher said the club was mourning the loss of a Bombers champion.\n\n“It is with deep sadness we learned of Bluey’s passing on Wednesday morning, and we extend our sincere condolences to Bluey’s wife Marj and their family,” Brasher said.\n\n“In a relatively short career, Bluey’s contribution to the red and black was significant and his on-field achievements were both many and varied. Bluey was known for his strength and courage and was idolised by many for his feats.\n\n“It is a sad day for the Essendon Football Club and Bluey will be greatly missed.”\n\nWhen Shelton was inducted into the Bombers’ Hall of Fame in 2019, Essendon champion Kevin Sheedy revealed the boy from Avenel was the reason behind Sheedy growing up as an Essendon supporter.\n\nEssendon Hall of Fame inductee Ian ‘Bluey’ Shelton chats with Kevin Sheedy at the 2019 Crichton Medal.

He is an incredibly inspirational player and even though he had a short career, his impact was profound,” Sheedy said.\n\n“I wore the number 10 because of him and I never changed my number. When I moved into a coaching role, I always gave players that I thought would be very good players the number 10.\n\n“To me, Bluey was the one person that Essendon needed to protect its wonderfully skilled team.”\n\nEssendon’s players and staff will wear black armbands on Saturday night against Hawthorn in honour of both Ian ‘Bluey’ Shelton and Dr Bruce Reid, who sadly passed away in late October last year.\n\nRest in peace, Bluey."
