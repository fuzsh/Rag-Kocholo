        "text": "‘Don’t you dare say anything until you calm down, we’ll talk about this then,’ said Barry Davis.\n\nAnd instead of delivering one of his infamous ‘sprays’, football’s messiah Ron Barassi backed off.\n\nHis captain Barry Davis was the purest of champions, competitive, skilled, super fit… and a born diplomat. The issue was soon settled.\n\nA three-time VFL/AFL premiership player, Davis led North Melbourne to its first ever premiership in 1975. The image of him being embraced immediately afterwards by a grateful Barassi is one of footy’s most-endearing images.\n\nThis tribute by Barry’s brother Ken comes 60 years after Davis first walked into Windy Hill – home of the electrifying John Coleman – beginning one of the most illustrious careers of all.\n\nA member of both the Essendon and North Melbourne’s Teams of the Century, Davis was player, team-man, captain,coach, motivator, mentor and family man… he was truly Born to Play.\n\nTim Watson, one of his mentors, has provided the foreword to this $50 hardback which has been produced in a limited edition of 500.\n\nWe think this will be one of the most important new ‘AFL’ books to appear for the Father’s Day-Christmas market.\n\nWe expect copies by September.\n\nDo pre-order now.\n\nThere is also a collector’s edition available signed by Barry, Tim and old teammates"
