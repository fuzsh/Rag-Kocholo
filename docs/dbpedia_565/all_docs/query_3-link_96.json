        "text": "Questions have been asked of Essendon’s development under Brad Scott despite the club splashing a surplus of cash in multiple areas.\n\nThere’s a worrying feeling of deja vu at the Bombers after dropping six of their last eight games in a similar repeat of last year’s fade out – Scott’s first year as coach – that has the club currently outside the top eight.\n\nShould that remain, the 2021 campaign under Ben Rutten would be the last year Essendon has played finals\n\nWatch every game of every round this Toyota AFL Premiership Season LIVE with no ad-breaks during play on Kayo. New to Kayo?

In 2021 Rutten took this team to finals with a percentage of about 110 – the club’s best percentage since 2003.\n\n“Right now it has the fourth-worst percentage in the AFL ... it’s a really strange position to be in given we don’t think they’re going to play finals.”\n\nTo emphasise a feeling of “the same olds,” Landsberger showed vision from 2014 when then Essendon coach Mark Thompson challenged the club’s development.\n\n“When, when, when are you going to change?,” a fired up Thompson said at a press conference after a loss to Richmond.\n\n“When is it going to happen where you take yourself from an average team to a team that consistently plays finals and you can handle the stage and you look the same every week? When, when, when?\n\n“Because they do it in patches; it’s not as if they can’t play.\n\n“What makes the team fluctuate? That’s what I’m trying to unlock.”\n\nLandsberger responded: “Tell me that could not have been Brad Scott after the loss against St Kilda, it’s extraordinary to listen to.”\n\nFellow Herald Sun reporter Jay Clark believes Scott will use the next four rounds to decide which players will – and won’t – take the club forward to contend for its 17th flag.\n\n“I think Brad Scott is going to take a massive Bunsen burner and spotlight to this list over the next four weeks. He’ll be gaining data and looking at which players can take Essendon to a top four berth and premiership,” he said.\n\n“He is brutal Brad Scott and a straight shooter. I think these next four weeks will make or break careers at the Essendon Football Club.\n\n“But there is a sense of familiarity and deja about all this.”"
