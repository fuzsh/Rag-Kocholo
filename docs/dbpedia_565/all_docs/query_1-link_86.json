        "text": "Born to Play: The Barry Davis Story\n\nby Ken Davis\n\nKenPiesse Football & Cricket Books\n\nISBN: 9780992522896\n\nFew footballers were as scrupulously fair or as sporting as the iconic Barry Davis, now in his mid-70s and still as passionate about sports as he ever was.\n\nHe is ‘gobsmacked’ that his brother Ken has written his full-length biography, a delightful trip down nostalgia lane for any Essendon and North Melbourne fan.\n\nWhen he was helping to sort through his Mum’s possessions on her passing years ago, he was amazed that most of her cupboard space was taken by scrapbooks, detailing every game, every clipping, every photograph ever taken of him in his celebrated 15 years as one of the champions of the VFL.\n\n‘Why would you bother?’ he said.\n\nHis younger brother Ken said: ‘I’ll take those’ and it has formed the basis of a nostalgic re-visit into the life and times of footy in the ‘60s and ‘70s.\n\n****\n\nThis tribute by Barry’s brother Ken comes 60 years after Davis first walked into Windy Hill beginning one of the most illustrious careers of all.\n\nA member of both the Essendon and North Melbourne’s Teams of the Century, Davis was player, team-man, captain, coach, motivator, mentor and family man… he was truly Born to Play.\n\n‘Barry Davis is the most complete footballer I have ever seen,’ –JACK CLARKE\n\nTo celebrate the forthcoming release of Born to Play: The Barry Davis Story, in a limited edition hardback, you have the opportunity to purchase the book by contacting Ken Piesse at [email protected] for the special offer of $50 post free.\n\nTo return to the www.footyalmanac.com.au home page click HERE\n\nOur writers are independent contributors.
