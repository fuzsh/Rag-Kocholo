        "text": "Description\n\nBORN TO PLAY: The Barry Davis Story ($60.00 including postage anywhere in Australia)\n\nWe are pleased to advise of the availability of a book entitled ‘Born to Play’ which traces the life of Essendon and AFL Hall of Famer Barry Davis.\n\nThe book is written by Barry’s brother Ken and is edited by renowned sports author and journalist, Ken Piesse.\n\nBarry, now in his late 70’s reflects fondly on his 10 years as a player and 3 years of coaching at the Bombers. A dual premiership player, 3 time Crichton medallist and Runner up in 2 Brownlows Barry was not only highly skilled but also scrupulously fair.\n\nA member of both Essendon and North’s Team of the Century, we commend this book to you. You will enjoy the story of a pure sportsman who excelled in so many domains."
