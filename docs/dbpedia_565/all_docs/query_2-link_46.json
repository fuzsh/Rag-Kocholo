General manager of football Todd Viney paid tribute to Greenwood for his service to the game and the Kangaroos. \"Hughie has been a real leader on and off the field during his time here,\" Viney said. \"It‚Äôs a credit to him that he will leave the game knowing he has impacted so many of his teammates along the way.\"\n\nNorth Melbourne trio Harry Sheezel, George Wardlaw and Colby McKercher have been recognised for their outstanding seasons with selection in the AFL Players‚Äô Association 22under22 team. Sheezel, 19, received the most votes across the board in this year's team, making 93 per cent of fans' teams, and has been voted as this year‚Äôs vice-captain. North Melbourne is one of only three teams to have three or more representatives in this year's team, along with Hawthorn and Fremantle.\n\nOur AFL Women's program has been bolstered by the returning Vikki Wall and recruit Bl√°ith√≠n Bogue, following the conclusion of their overseas commitments ‚òòÔ∏è Star forward Wall is no stranger to Arden Street, having quickly become one of the Kangaroos' most important players after she joined the side midway through 2022. Bogue joins her new teammates after starring for Gaelic club Fermanagh in their All-Ireland Junior Final triumph over Louth at Croke Park earlier this month.\n\nLiam Shiels has announced his retirement from the game after 16 seasons across two clubs. The 33-year-old will line up for his 288th and final game on Saturday afternoon at UTAS Stadium against his former club, Hawthorn. \"I've been lucky enough to do what I love for the last 16 years and I'm so grateful for the opportunity to play out my last couple of years at the North Melbourne Football Club,\" Shiels said. \"I've only been here two years but it feels like I've been here much longer. I've made some lifelong friends which I'm so grateful for. Thank you for the opportunity.\"\n\nBailey Scott has signed a two-year contract extension on the eve of his 100th AFL game, ensuring he will remain at North Melbourne until at least the end of 2026. A father-son selection, Scott arrived at Arden Street via pick No.49 in the 2018 AFL Draft. The hard-running 24-year-old was named the club‚Äôs Best Young Player in 2020, before earning back-to-back third place finishes in the Syd Barker Medal voting in 2022 and 2023. In 2024, Scott was appointed to the side's leadership group for the first time and has featured in every game this season, averaging more than 20 disposals off half-back and on the wing.\n\nJUST ANNOUNCED: 35-time ARIA nominated Australian alt-rock band Eskimo Joe are set to headline the DrinkWise North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast.
