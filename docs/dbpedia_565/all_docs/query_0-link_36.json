He took office on September 1, 2006, 24 years after he joined the league where he held numerous football and business operations roles prior to being elected Commissioner.\n\nCommissioner Goodell's priorities have focused on improving all aspects of the game for fans, players, and the clubs, while successfully growing the popularity of the NFL and its 32 teams around the world. In 2022, the NFL played its 100th international regular season game and its first regular season game in Germany. Global fan interest in the NFL has soared on all platforms, including the largest domestic audiences in television history, as well as enormous growth in digital and social media engagement.\n\nUnder Commissioner Goodell's leadership, the NFL has focused on improvements to player health and safety, benefits for retired players, the league's personal conduct policy, social responsibility programs, diversity in hiring practices, revenue sharing, stadium development, fan experience, media innovation, international development, officiating and rules changes. These enhancements have increased the quality, safety and enjoyment of the game.\n\nCommissioner Goodell has guided the league to two 10-year transformative Collective Bargaining Agreements that secured labor peace for a generation with landmark agreements in 2011 and 2020.

In 1977 he made his first mark as a professional athlete, winning the 800m at the European Indoor Championship. After a string of world records, Coe won his first Olympic medal in 1980 at the Moscow games, taking gold in the 1,500m. His second gold came in 1984 at the Los Angeles Olympics.
