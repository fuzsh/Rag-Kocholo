        "text": "by The Oracle\n\n\"The world's spinning madly, it drifts in the dark\n\nSwings through a hollow of haze,\n\nA race around the stars, a journey through\n\nThe universe ablaze with changes.\"\n\nFrom \"Changes\" by Phil Ochs\n\nA couple of years ago I wrote about how I really love this time of year. There's a distinct change in seasons as we drift from winter into spring and suddenly we're into sunny days and warm weather. In the blink of an eye, it's summer time and the living is easy.\n\nIt's easy for most us but not for those in charge of managing an AFL playing list. You need only look around at the frenzy in the media, around offices and workplaces, in pubs and bars and on the internet surrounding the myriad of trade and draft stories that abound at this time of year. There is so much argy bargy allegedly going on that if you believed all the rumours, then every AFL football manager would be going bonkers just trying to keep pace with his own club's player movements.\n\nIt's a good thing however, that those with their fingers on the pulse (i.e. the football club managers) only need to deal in fact and not fiction because for every trade fact that emerges at this time of the year, there are dozens of tales that are no more than unsubstantiated rumours with little or no chance of coming to fruition. Most of them are figments of mischievous imaginations or, as Confucius once said,\n\n\"Man who think too much about player trades, get warts on hands.\" Amen.\n\nStill, there have been a few interesting trade possibilities to emerge over the past month or so and these are the ones that seem to have a basis of fact in them. Players mentioned as being on the move are Luke Power (Brisbane Lions), Daniel Motlop (Kangaroos), Jimmy Bartel (Geelong), Lance Whitnall (Carlton), Byron Pickett (Port Adelaide), Jonathan Hay (Hawthorn), Brendan Fevola (Carlton), Graham Polak (Fremantle), Shannon Grant (Kangaroos), Paul Medhurst (Fremantle) and Nathan Eagleton (Western Bulldogs). They are players who are either out of contract or have asked or been asked to move on and appear set to move elsewhere. Then there is the Melbourne contingent...\n\nI'm one of those who doesn't like it when I hear claims made that one of our favoured sons is about to pack his bags and head off to some other club. We have the highly publicised situation involving Adem Yze whose contract is being renegotiated as we speak; a club champion who some believe should be offered as trade bait in order to snare a much needed big name, perhaps a hard inside midfielder or a tough key position player. Clint Bizzell and Daniel Ward are in contract but are also said to be in the trade mix while the club has already agreed to part ways with Steven Armstrong. And other names are certain to be added to the list of those who will soon depart.\n\nOne interesting name being bandied about is that of Shane Woewodin who left the club in controversial circumstances in late 2002 - a victim of the club's then salary cap woes. Now they say he could be back. Stranger things have happened in football.\n\nI'm not frightened of the possibility that one or more Demon stars may be playing elsewhere in 2006 and beyond. In fact, change has become such an inevitable fact of life in football that sometimes I wonder why it still manages to frighten people.\n\nFormer Carlton and Hawthorn premiership coach David Parkin always used to say that he aimed to have at least five fresh faces in his team at the start of every new season - even with his premiership sides. He knew that changes must happen for teams to advance from year to year - whether the fans liked it or not!\n\nFor every face that disappears from the club scene, another new one will emerge to replace it. Following the Nick Stevens and Jade Rawlings sagas of 2003, clubs have come to realise that if you want to get quality, you have to give away some quality. Trading is no longer about one club screwing the other and that's how it should be.\n\nAfter yet another disappointing year full of false hope, our football department has the obligation to ensure that the result of changes through trading and drafting will be a stronger list than the one that represented the Demons in 2005; that the deficiencies of the season are covered either by natural improvement of the existing players or by the introduction of new recruits. The club can't afford another fade out like the ones that haunted it at the end of the last two playing seasons.\n\nThis is the time to make decisions that will influence the club's future and that means changes to the playing list, possibly to the coaching mix and certainly changes in the style of game the team plays. Inevitably, that means we need new faces and the need to offload some of the old ones.\n\nIt is no accident that Sydney, West Coast, Adelaide and St. Kilda comprised the top four in 2005. The Swans' premiership team included some handy players picked up over the years in trades, Jason Ball, Paul Williams, Craig Bolton, Barry Hall, Nick Davis and, of course, Darren Jolly for who they gave up a first round draft pick twelve months ago. The Eagles and the Crows also bolstered their lists over the summer to catapult them to the top at the end of the home and away rounds. A couple of years ago, St. Kilda lost Peter Everitt and Barry Hall who might have been considered indispensable by some supporters at the time but their trading ultimately resulted in a stronger St. Kilda.\n\nAnother reason why we shouldn't fear change is that there are a lot of hidden gems out there in draft territory while others are out there waiting for a change of scenery to achieve personal improvement in their game.\n\nSo the next weeks and months promise to be fascinating and this is how it all will unfold:-\n\nThis coming week, the various club scouts have gathered for the AFL draft camp at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra to assess the young hopefuls in anticipation of the National Draft.\n\nNext week, the real trade frenzy begins with a weeklong exchange period when players (and draft selection positions) will be bought and sold in the trade market. It will be a nerve-wracking time for some and there is little doubt that we will see some of our old favourites moved on in the process. More change.\n\nAnd the exchange period will pave the way for the 26 November draft lottery in which Melbourne's first choice currently sits at pick 12. We won't know the final order of the draft until after the exchange period.\n\nAnd after that, mid December will bring the Pre-Season and Rookie Drafts, where lists can be further topped up with recycled or previously rejected players and some trainee youngsters.\n\nThis is the list that Neale Daniher currently has at his disposal but you can be sure that by the end of December there will be changes:-\n\nMELBOURNE FOOTBALL CLUB - PLAYING LIST (SEASON 2005):\n\nSENIOR LIST:\n\nSteven Armstrong, Matthew Bate, Daniel Bell, Clint Bizzell, Nathan Brown, Cameron Bruce, Nathan Carroll, Aaron Davey, Lynden Dunn, Ryan Ferguson, Simon Godfrey, Brad Green, Chris Heffernan, Ben Holland, Cameron Hunter, Mark Jamar, Chris Johnson, Paul Johnson, Travis Johnstone, James McDonald, Brock McLean Brad Miller, Brent Moloney, Shannon Motlop*, Michael Newton, Alistair Nicholson, Phil Read, Guy Rigoni, Jared Rivers, Russell Robertson, Nick Smith, Colin Sylvia, Daniel Ward, Paul Wheatley, Matthew Whelan, Jeff White, Luke Williams, Adem Yze.\n\nVETERAN LIST:\n\nDavid Neitz.\n\nROOKIE LIST:\n\nBrendan Van Shaik, Matthew Warnock.\n\n* replaced Troy Broadbridge (deceased)\n\nCENTRE STAGE - THE AFL NATIONAL DRAFT CAMP\n\nPART ONE\n\nThe big time footballers are now off centre stage for a few months. Many are enjoying well-earned rests after a long, hard season of sweat and toil. The winners (Sydney) are grinning and the rest are, well, you know what the rest do, don't you?\n\nFor the next two or three months football's centre stage will be occupied by the club's football departments, list managers and recruiters - the people in charge of deciding which new faces are to be introduced into the fold by way or trades and the drafts.\n\nThese people also fulfil the role of the grim reapers of football in that they must decide which footballers are surplus to their clubs' requirements and then tell them that their time there has come to an end. A few of those players might claw their way back onto the scene through trading, a small number get back in the drafts but the majority are left on the football scrap heap. Their days are over. They must leave centre stage for good to make way for youth.\n\nThe spring and the early summer are devoted in the main to the young and the football action moves to Canberra today where the seventy-three of the very best young footballers from around Australia will attend the 2005 AFL Draft Camp at the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra. The purpose of the camp is to assess the elite of the country's under 18 age footballers ahead of the National Draft, which will be held this year on 26 November. A further 112 players will also be tested early next month at half-day screening camps held in each capital city.\n\nThe players who earned their invitations have, of course, been under the scrutiny of the AFL scouts for years, in most cases from their very early teens. The majority have played in under age competitions like the TAC Cup in Victoria or junior age teams in the other states. A few, particularly in South and Western Australia have already played at senior level. Most of the elite footballers were on display representing their states in the National Under 18 Championships and some have already attracted the attention of recruiting scouts and discerning club supporters on the lookout for the next \"big thing\".\n\nWhat they're all looking for are players who will go on and play the game at the highest level, at the highest standard and for a long time. The 200 game plus player. What are the attributes of these elusive youngsters?\n\nPrior to the national titles, a Herald Sun article set out the 14 key performance indicators that AFL talent scouts use to rank players. I'll reproduce it here as a guide to the many factors used as benchmarks in assessing young players -\n\n1. Kicking ability - Nathan Buckley, Nigel Lappin\n\n2. Marking ability - Jonathan Brown, Warren Tredrea\n\n3. Handpassing/vision-awareness - Simon Black, Scott West\n\n4. Clean hands - Andrew McLeod, Luke Power\n\n5. Ball-winning ability - James Hird, Nick Riewoldt\n\n6. Pace - Jason Akermanis, Chris Judd\n\n7. Endurance - Shane Crawford, Cameron Ling\n\n8. Recovery and agility - Matthew Scarlett, Chris Johnson\n\n9. Durability - Jared Crouch, Adam Simpson\n\n10. Leadership and self-discipline - James Hird, Nathan Buckley\n\n11. Aggression, intensity and second efforts - Glenn Archer, Mark Ricciuto\n\n12. Football character - Robert Harvey, Matthew Lloyd\n\n13. Competitiveness - Barry Hall, Aaron Hamill\n\n14. Football smarts - Brent Harvey, Paul Hasleby\n\nThe article went on to point out the things that the talent scouts are not looking for and they are players who -\n\n1. Turn the ball over through poor kicking\n\n2. Lack sufficient pace\n\n3. Have off-field issues that will hold them back\n\n4. Don't always keep their head over the ball\n\n5. Don't play a specific position\n\nThe top division of the National Championships was won again this year by the Victorian Metropolitan side and its captain Marc Murphy was the dominant player of the week and his three outstanding games won him the Larke Medal for best and fairest player in the series. WA skipper Andrew Swallow was the runner-up in the medal.

[Not eligible for the 2005 Draft]\n\nThe majority of these players will be in Canberra this week for the draft camp which involves not only physical and psychological testing in several different areas but also interviews with club recruiting managers. Traditionalists might argue that the worth of a player should be determined by what he does on the football field but past history shows that the way the players prepare themselves and perform at the draft camp will have a major bearing in the ultimate decision making process that leads to the drafts.\n\nPART TWO\n\nThe general consensus among those \"in the know\" is that this year's crop of young talent is nowhere near as strong as it has been in the really big draft years such as 2001 when Luke Hodge, Luke Ball, and Chris Judd, Graham Polak, Xavier Clarke and Ashley Sampi went 1,2,3,4,5 and 6, Jimmy Bartel was taken at 8, Nick Dal Santo at 13, Lewis Roberts-Thompson at 27, Ashley Hansen at 38, Brad Miller and Paul Medhurst at 55 and 56 respectively and Adam Schneider was taken by the Swans at 60. A handy youngster by the name of Gary Ablett Junior was snaffled up in this draft as a father son selection.\n\nThere are good drafts and there are bad drafts and, as we can see from the example of 2001, not all of the cream is at the top of the draft. One only has to look at the 2005 premiership team to discern this as fact. Before this season, Sydney has been at around middle of the road for some time so it hasn't really had many early selections. To find those in Sydney's record, you have to go right back to the 1998 National Draft when the Swans picked Nic Fosdike at 3 and Jude Bolton at 8. A year earlier, they picked a gem at number 43 in Adam Goodes who went on to win a Brownlow Medal in 2003. In 1999 Ryan O'Keeffe was selected at 56 while they picked up Luke Ablett and Amon Buchanan in 2000 at numbers 24 and 52 respectively. The following year the Swans again did well with mid to low range picks when they snared Lewis Roberts-Thomson (29) and Adam Schneider (60). Sean Dempster was a father son selection in 2002 with pick number 34.\n\nBut it wasn't only in the draft where the Swans recruited well; they did some very nice things in their dealings with other clubs. The team last Saturday contained six players who were picked up from other clubs, five of them - Jason Ball (1999), Paul Williams (2000), Barry Hall (2001), Nick Davis (2002) and Darren Jolly (2004) - in trading as well as Craig Bolton who was picked up from the Lions in the pre-season draft of 2003. Injured former skipper Stuart Maxfield who has now retired was also recruited in this manner from Richmond.\n\nBut that's not all. The premiership side contained three former rookies in Brett Kirk, Tadhg Kennelly and Paul Bevan with Kennelly being an international rookie selection from Ireland.\n\nThe reward for the Swans' success in terms of the drat is that their first pick before trading is the last selection in the first round at number 19 sitting behind the three clubs - Carlton, Collingwood and Hawthorn - that have priority picks 1, 2 and 3 and then the first round selections begin in reverse order to ladder position. Based on their recent recruiting record and the perceived shallowness of this year's draft pool, this might not worry the Swans at all.\n\nThis year, it appears that while the top four or five picks are virtually given as being of reasonably high quality, the next group could be picked from any one of up to thirty players. If the perceived strength of the draft is weak, this will have an impact on the way clubs trade during next week's trade week because they will be more inclined to trade earlyish selections in order to find the player who meets their specific needs.\n\nThe AFL scouts will nevertheless look closely at what happens during the draft camp because they have the opportunity to look at players close up under testing conditions. The 73 attendees arrived yesterday for the 12th national draft camp so there is a growing data bank available for them to be able to make observations on how the players at this camp compare with those who have gone before them.

Some of them have already been pencilled in for selection. Most will be picked up in the national or the rookie drafts. Some are young enough to go back to the drawing boards and try again next year. A few who miss out, will go into their state competitions where a small number might get another chance in the future and some will never make it to centre stage.\n\nPART THREE\n\nTwo large groups converged on Canberra this week to take part in the AFL's annual three day draft camp. The first group comprised the 73 players invited to take part in the testing with a view to becoming AFL draft choices either at the November National Draft or in the December Pre season and Rookie Drafts. The other group was even larger - estimated at around 100 and this is the group representing the sixteen AFL clubs.\n\nThere is no question about it; this week is critical to most of the youngsters invited to the draft camp. Those 100 people from the AFL clubs includes most of the coaches and recruiting managers and the event will give them an opportunity to crystallise their views on many of the players coming under consideration for the drafts. As Kevin Sheehan, the AFL's National Talent Manager, recently pointed out to the media, some of the potential early draft picks have already been determined.\n\n\"Some of the names people are talking about include Patrick Ryder from East Fremantle, a youngster called Travis Varcoe from South Australia, from Central Districts, Victorian Marc Murphy from the Oakley Chargers and one from country Victoria, Xavier Ellis - they're some of the leading candidates,\" he said.\n\nOf course, you don't have to wait for the AFL National Draft to involve yourself in the AFL National Draft speculation.

The mock draft is not set in stone and will be reviewed a few times before the November Draft with the next one due on October 11.\n\nPART FOUR\n\nThe AIS at Canberra is emptying out for the weekend as the AFL scouts and seventy footballers head back home at the conclusion of the 12th National Draft Camp. Over the past four days, the hopefuls have been put through the hoops and undergone an interesting series of tests to determine their physical attributes and mental capabilities with an eye to determining whether they have the makings of elite footballers.\n\nIn the old days, you just used to ask whether a bloke could get the ball and if so, how good was his disposal but today we're looking for athletes who can play a bit of football so things are a little different. Actually, that's not entirely true because many of the tests that the players have undergone really do indicate a lot about each individual - aspects such as speed, agility, reflexes, strength and endurance. You have to have all of these in differing proportions if you want to make it to the big stage in the sport.\n\nThey even test height and weight and the interesting part is that the official results often indicate different personal statistical data for many players than those published in the competition records. Colin Wisbey has noted elsewhere that he is highly sceptical of some of the height and weight details of some players. The draft camp tests will set the record straight. The tallest participant in the 2005 camp was Sandgroper Max Bailey who stands at close to 206 cm. while Queenslander Jesse White had the biggest impact on the scales at 98.5 kg.\n\nThe AFL produces a list of the top 10 -12 in each testing category but it's damn hard finding out how the lesser performers went in each of them. I suppose they don't want to embarrass some of the youngsters who haven't performed as well as they should. Apparently, one participant a few camps ago produced such dismal results that he fell right out of consideration and, as a consequence went from being a top 20 draft chance to the point where he missed out altogether.\n\nThe camp tests players for their aerobic and anaerobic capacities. Those who excel in the latter group are usually the speedsters while the former are the endurance athletes - the stayers. Occasionally, an athlete is strong in both areas but such people are a rare breed. The outstanding youngsters in the speed stakes were Matt Laidlaw of the Oakleigh Chargers and East Perth's Jarred Oakley-Nicholls who sizzled through the 20 metre sprint and also performed well in at least one other category. The outstanding endurance athlete was Sturt's Tom Rischbieth who excelled in breaking the camp record for the infamous beep test and then demolished the previous 3km time trial record by over half a minute. As a consequence the footydraft experts lifted the South Australian Under 18 vice captain into their revised mock draft rankings to number 26 with a red bullet. Laidlaw's ranking was also up in today's revision. Dandenong Stingrays on baller Nathan Jones enjoyed a marked rise in the mock draft up to number 7 but that had little to do with the draft camp and more related to his slashing 38-possession performance in the TAC Cup Grand Final. Jones finished sixth in the time trial, a minute behind Rischbieth.\n\nThe shock of the camp was on Friday when the Canberra weather cleared to a fine day and they brought out the footballs. Suddenly, the prospective draftees were going through the paces doing some training drills and most of the prospective early choices stood out including Marc Murphy and Xavier Ellis who are tipped to go 1, 2 in the national draft. Neither had been outstanding in the other testing (Murphy is nursing a minor knee problem) but they looked good out there on the ground. Melbourne football manager Craig Cameron came on radio and nominated his top five draftees - Murphy, Ellis and East Fremantle trio Josh Kennedy, Patrick Ryder and Mitchell Clark, all of who measure in excess of 195 cm. They will be challenged by one of the no shows of the camp in Central Districts' Shannon Hurn who is otherwise engaged at the weekend in the SANFL Grand Final.\n\nThe other important phase of the draft camp process is the player interviews. Many a draft choice has turned on the impression a particular player has given under these conditions. Clubs place a high priority on the character of youngsters coming into the system. You just can't afford to draft ratbags these days. Mind you, the entire development system usually weeds them out well before any invitations are sent for events as prestigious as the draft camps.\n\nAt week's end, the various club scouts will consult together with their football departments and coaches. They will have a good idea of the direction they anticipate will be taken in the draft and, in many cases, will make decisions to seek better draft choices or offload them in the trade period. It's just one of those aspects that makes the trade week so very interesting.\n\n12th National AFL Draft Camp Results\n\nHeight\n\nMax Bailey (West Perth) - 205.8cm Robert Warnock (Sandringham) - 204.5cm Angus Graham (Calder Cannons) - 200.3cm Andrew Banjamin (Geelong Falcons) - 200.0cm James Wall (Calder Cannons) - 198.5cm Trent West (Gippsland Power) - 198.2cm Mitchell Clark (East Fremantle) - 198.1cm Patrick Ryder (East Fremantle) - 195.7cm Andrew Ainger (Oakleigh Chargers) - 195.7cm Wayde Mills (Southport) - 195.1cm Josh Kennedy (East Fremantle) - 195.1cm Michael West (Redlands) - 195.1cm\n\nMass\n\nJesse White (Southport) - 98.5kg Max Bailey (West Perth) - 93.0kg Alipate Carlile (Murray Bushrangers) - 92.9kg Angus Graham (Calder Cannons) - 92.6kg Josh Kennedy (East Fremantle) - 92.3kg Mitchell Clark (East Fremantle) - 91.3kg Trent West (Gippsland Power) - 89.8kg Austin Lucy (Suncoast Lions) - 89.7kg Daniel Stanley (Geelong Falcons) - 89.5kg Tim Looby (Murray Bushrangers) - 88.8kg\n\nAgility\n\nJarred Oakley-Nicholls (East Perth) - 7.97 Courtney Dempsey (Morningside) - 7.99 Stephen Owen (North Ballarat) - 8.02 Todd Grima (Northern Bombers) - 8.11 Andrew Swallow (East Fremantle) - 8.12 Richard Douglas (Calder Cannons) - 8.17 Matt Riggio (Peel Thunder) - 8.18 Rhan Hooper (Mt Gravatt) - 8.19 Marc Murphy (Oakleigh Chargers) - 8.21 Nick Lower (Norwood) - 8.23\n\nVertical Jump - standing\n\nDarren Pfeiffer (Norwood) - 72cm Matt Laidlaw (Oakleigh Chargers) - 70cm Wayde Mills (Southport) - 70cm Garrick Ibbotson (East Fremantle) - 68cm Nate Roffey (Mt Gravatt) - 68cm Brad Kelleher (Eastern Ranges) - 67cm Andrew Swallow (East Fremantle) - 66cm Daniel Stanley (Geelong Falcons) - 66cm Dale Thomas (Gippsland Power) - 66cm Alan Toovey (Claremont) - 65cm Austin Lucy (Suncoast Lions) - 65cm Angus Graham (Calder Cannons) - 65cm\n\n20-metre Sprint\n\nMatt Laidlaw (Oakleigh Chargers) - 2.83sec Jarred Oakley-Nicholls (East Perth) - 2.85sec Nate Roffey (Mt Gravatt) - 2.92sec Andrew Swallow (East Fremantle) - 2.92sec Grant Birchall (Devonport) - 2.93sec Nick Lower (Norwood) - 2.93sec Dale Thomas (Gippsland Power) - 2.93sec Sam Elliott (South Adelaide) - 2.94sec Austin Lucy (Suncoast Lions) - 2.94sec Alan Toovey (Claremont) - 2.94sec\n\nShuttle Run (Beep Test)\n\nTom Rischbieth (Sturt) - Level 15.8 Travis Casserley (Swan Districts) - 15.2 Robert Eddy (Gippsland Power) - 14.9 Sam Iles (Clarence) - 14.6 Kristin Thornton (Peel Thunder) - 14.6 Matt Riggio (Peel Thunder) - 14.6 Alan Toovey (Claremont) - 14.6 Ryan Jackson (Northern Knights) - 14.5 Wayde Mills (Southport) - 14.3 James Wall (Calder Cannons) - 14.3\n\n3km time-trial\n\nTom Rischbieth (Sturt) - 9:30 Daniel Dzufer (Suncoast Lions) - 10:06 Wayde Mills (Southport) - 10:12 Robert Eddy (Gippsland Power) - 10:19 Matthew Thomas (Sandringham) - 10:22 Nathan Jones (Dandenong) - 10:31 Travis Casserley (Swan Districts) - 10:22 Ryan Jackson (Northern Knights) - 10:34 Haydyn Kiel (Southport) - 10:41 Sam Iles (Clarence) - 10:42"
