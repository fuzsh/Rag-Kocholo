        "text": "Former Essendon coach Des Tuddenham’s hard-nosed approach to coaching remains divisive, with one brutal training session still sticking in the mind of past players.\n\nEpisodes three and four of The Bombers: Stories of a Great Club will screen on Fox Footy on Tuesday night (7:30pm AEST), all leading up to the eighth and final episode - a one-hour special - in November.\n\nEpisode three will focus on Tuddenham, who joined the Bombers as captain / coach in 1972 and, despite not managing to lead the side to a flag, managed to engineer some more respectable performances than what the side had dished up in the prior couple of seasons.\n\nCatch all the ICC T20 World Cup action live & exclusive to Fox Cricket, available on Kayo. New to Kayo? Start your free trial today!\n\nIn 1975, however, Tuddenham’s methods became too much for some of his teammates and charges when, after an 80-point loss to Carlton in Round 14, he demanded they crawl on hands and knees around the training oval twice.\n\nFormer Bomber Barry Davis recalls, playing for North Melbourne at the time, recalls, “They had to get down on hands and knees and go right around the whole 400 metres, twice.”\n\n“You think the players enjoyed that? I don’t think so.”\n\nGeoff Pryor remembered the incident, noting, “He asked us to crawl around the oval.”\n\n“I thought there was very little benefit in trying to do that. What it reflected was the deep feeling ‘Tuddy’ had and the frustration.”\n\nAnother former player, Ken Fletcher, told the historian Dan Eddy that Tuddenham, “lost every single player for the way he treated us that day”.\n\n“And if everyone had not got down and done it, then no-one would’ve played the next week. None of us liked doing it, but we all did it. It was really degrading.\n\n“The most degrading thing I have ever done in my life, in fact.”\n\nTuddenham himself admits the move was “one of those spontaneous decisions that you make”, born of a performance in which the side conceded 14 goals in a quarter to the Blues.\n\n“I was angry and I couldn’t sleep all night. I got to the ground and said ‘Right, you’re on your hands and knees, crawl halfway today and lets get going again, that was a pathetic performance’,” he said.\n\n“But then I said go down and get a couple of slabs of beer and let the players open up and I sat back and let them fire at me, which was good.\n\n“They won the next four games!”"
