        "text": "Disgraced former North Melbourne player Tarryn Thomas could be thrown an AFL lifeline, after his career was ended on the eve of the 2024 season.\n\nThomas had lunch with St Kilda list manager Graeme Allen in Carlton on Tuesday, according to 9News chief football reporter, Tom Morris.\n\nThe two met on Lygon Street, with St Kilda confirming that the lunch did take place.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLIVE UPDATES: Follow all the action from day 12\n\nREAD MORE: Commentators' hilarious reaction to Arisa Trew's golden run\n\nREAD MORE: Closing ceremony boycott after 'scandalous' call\n\nThe club told 9News that Allen \"has a lot of lunches, and this was just another one\".\n\nOn the eve of the 2024 season, the Kangaroos axed the troubled player after he was initially suspended by the league for 18 matches for alleged inappropriate behaviour towards women.\n\nThomas spent much of the 2023 season also bouncing from controversy to controversy.\n\nNow, Thomas has again been linked to another rival club.\n\nIt comes after Geelong and Essendon were among clubs who expressed interest in Thomas' footballing abilities earlier in the season.\n\nHowever, back in May, the Saints stood arm-in-arm with North Melbourne before their round eight match, taking a stance against domestic violence.\n\nMeantime, Thomas is due in court on November 21.\n\nThe AFL also moved to clarify their stance on Thomas' eligibility in the league, as he awaits his court hearing.\n\n\"Thomas is not eligible to play in any level, until the outcome of the court case, in which termination of his elibility will be formely decided,\" Morris confirmed the AFL told him."
