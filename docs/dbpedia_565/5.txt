This year Essendon has been covering its past superstars and honouring a Bomber Legend for each home game.

While the term can be thrown around in the footballing world, there is no doubt that this week’s Legend is fitting of the title.

Barry Davis is one of the greatest players to ever grace the club. After impressive stints around the ground, he found himself as one of the league’s greatest rovers, dominating the field and proving himself one of the best kicks in the game.

Sadly he became one of Essendon’s biggest losses after moving to North Melbourne in 1973 due to the short-lived 10-year rule, after which his immediate impact drew breakthrough success.

By the end of his career Davis had captained both clubs, won three premierships – two at Essendon in 1962 and 1965, and one captaining North Melbourne’s first ever flag-winning side in 1975 – represented Victoria from 1967 to 1972 and won five best and fairest awards.

After taking the reins as senior coach of the Bombers, helping set up a side that would eventually lead one of the club’s greatest eras, Davis’ accolades continued.

He slots into both of Essendon and North Melbourne’s Teams of the Century and is the club’s 15th Champion of Essendon.

This week he joined Rohan Connolly for a chat about his journey through football, and you can see it in the video above and hear the full interview via the podcast below.
