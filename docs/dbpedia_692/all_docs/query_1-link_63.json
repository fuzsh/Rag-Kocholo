        "text": "DEBRA ANN BYRD\n\nDebra Ann Byrd is the Founding Artistic Director of the Harlem Shakespeare Festival, as well as, an award winning classically trained actress, scholar and producer who was recently named Writer-in-Residence at the Shakespeare Birthplace Trust, Artist-in-Residence Fellow at the Folger Institute, an A'Lelia Bundles Community Scholar Arts Fellow at Columbia University, a Virtual Artist-in-Residence at The Center at West Park, and Artist-in-Residence at Southwest Shakespeare Company, where she recently reprised the role of Othello, winning her the 2019 Broadway World Phoenix Award for Best Lead Actress. In addition, Byrd is an emerging playwright who recently completed her new critically acclaimed solo show BECOMING OTHELLO: A Black Girl’s Journey.\n\nDebra Ann received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Acting from Marymount Manhattan College and completed advanced studies at Shakespeare & Company, The Public Theater’s Shakespeare Lab and The Broadway League’s Commercial Theatre Institute.\n\nHer career as an actor, producer, scholar, arts manager and business leader has been recognized with many awards and citations, including the NAACP Shirley Farmer Woman of Excellence Award, the LPTW (League Lucille Lortel Award, and the Josephine Abady Award for Excellence in “Producing works that foster diversity.”\n\nShe is the 2021 recipient of the prestigious Sidney Berger Award presented to her by the Shakespeare Theatre Association for her work as leader of a Shakespearean theater throughout the world.\n\nTORN OUT THEATER\n\nIN ASSOCIATION WITH\n\nTHE CENTER AT WEST PARK\n\nPRESENTS\n\nANTIGONICK\n\nFRIDAY, AUGUST 20 AT 8:00PM (DOORS AT 7:30PM)\n\nSATURDAY, AUGUST 21 AT 3:00PM (DOORS AT 2:30PM)\n\nTHERE IS NO ADVANCE TICKETING. ALL SEATS ARE FIRST-COME-FIRST-SERVED.\n\nTorn Out is thrilled to present Antigonick, Anne Carson’s adaptation of Sophocles’ famous tragedy Antigone.\n\nAfter over a year of physical isolation, come celebrate intimacy, connection, and the devastating importance of human touch.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nTORN OUT THEATER, founded in August 2016, is a home for theater projects that push the boundaries of how we see the human body and what we assume about modern sexuality. Alice Mottola and Pitr Strait, co-founders, believe that everyone's body tells a story, sometimes many stories. By adapting classic texts and devising unique audience experiences, Torn Out attempts to navigate a culture where private and public blur together, where the shocking and common trade places, and where magic is real.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, Mottola was approached by the Outdoor Topless Pulp Fiction Appreciation Society about directing a nude production of Shakespeare's The Tempest. After developing the core concepts of this world, finding a way for nudity and Shakespeare to blend together seamlessly, she invited Strait, longtime friend and collaborator, to join her as co-director. Together, they brought a performance like no one had ever seen to Central Park. A cast of brave and proud actors, dancers, and musicians played to overflowing crowds, leaving sorcery, beauty, and wonder in their wake.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, coverage of the performance circled the globe, igniting controversy and conversation. Thousands of people debated the role of the nudity in art and in society, the politics of reinventing classic plays, and the differing perceptions of male and female bodies. Seeing the power of theater to bring simmering tensions to the surface, where they could be confronted and explored, Mottola and Strait decided to form a company dedicated to starting more difficult conversations.\n\nWELCOME TO IMAGI*NATION: PART 2\n\nDIRECTION & CHOREOGRAPHY BY CARMEN CACERES\n\n(In Collaboration with the dancers)\n\nCO-DIRECTION & DRAMATURGY BY LAUREN HLUBNY\n\nOCT 21 AT 7:30PM\n\nFREE WITH REGISTRATION\n\nSUGGESTED DONATION OF $10 - $40\n\nWelcome to Imagi*Nation: Part 2 is a multimedia interactive performance that begins at the conflict of two fictional neighboring nations. While the audience participates in a socially distant interactive experience, the performers will enter into a series of challenges that will result in multiple possible outcomes. As the characters are searching for a way to survive, the audience will experience the motivations and consequences of migration.\n\nThis production will feature performances by Carmen Caceres, Israel Harris, Lauren Hlubny, Mallory Markham-Miller, Sofia Baeta, & Sofia Bengoa.\n\nUnderstudy: Lydia Perakis\n\nLighting Design: Nicole Sliwinski\n\nThe evening will run approximately 60 minutes total, including a 20-minute talk-back with the artists following the performance.\n\nABOUT THE ARTISTS\n\nCARMEN CACERES (SHE/HER) is a dance artist, originally from Buenos Aires, Argentina.
