        "text": "Description\n\nDiscover the revolutionary new Artist’s Way tool, from \"the Queen of Change\" (New York Times)\n\nIn her internationally bestselling book, The Artist’s Way, Julia Cameron shared with her millions of readers the three main tools needed to unlock creativity. Now, in her revolutionary new book, Living the Artist’s Way, Cameron finally reveals the vital fourth Artist’s Way tool that she relies upon daily to find creative inspiration: writing for guidance.\n\nOver the course of six weeks, readers learn the radical new skill needed to take their creativity and their creative work to the next level: how to connect with the intuitive power within themselves and trust the answers they receive. For followers of the Artist’s Way program and newcomers alike, this exciting new guidebook will teach readers how to find greater happiness, productivity, and creative inspiration.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nHailed by the New York Times as “The Queen of Change,” JULIA CAMERON is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought creativity into the mainstream conversation—in the arts, in business, and in everyday life. She is the best-selling author of more than forty books, fiction and nonfiction; a poet, songwriter, filmmaker and playwright. Commonly referred to as “The Godmother” or “High Priestess” of creativity, her tools are based in practice, not theory, and she considers herself “the floor sample of her own toolkit.” The Artist’s Way has been translated into forty languages and sold over five million copies to date.\n\nPraise for Living the Artist's Way: An Intuitive Path to Greater Creativity\n\n\"Cameron’s lovely prose is grounded in a keen awareness of her inner and outer worlds, which are described so vividly that the reader comes to feel like one of her many 'intimates.' Artists and others looking to tap into their intuition will find plenty of wisdom here.\" —Publishers Weekly\n\n\"Sometimes, when we feel stuck or afraid, we look to others for guidance. In Living the Artist's Way Julia Cameron shows us that the guidance we seek actually comes from somewhere deep within and is available at any time. This wise and encouraging book is a series of invitations to connection, creative confidence and commitment to the writing path. Accept those invitations and a whole world will open up for you.\" —Beth Kempton, bestselling author of Wabi Sabi"
