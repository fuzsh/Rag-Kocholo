        "text": "The Stanley Drama Award is given by the Wagner College Theatre for an original, unpublished full-length play or musical or thematically related set of one-act plays that has not yet been professionally produced.\n\nSince 1957, the Stanley Award has been given at least 60 times. Twice — in 1964, and again in 1969 — the Stanley Award was given to two playwrights for two different plays. In 1987, no award was made and all finalists were carried over to following year. And in 1995, we have no record of the Stanley Drama Award being given, no reference can be found online to a 1995 Stanley winner, and our business office has no record of any payment being made for the Stanley Award prize.\n\nThe Stanley Drama Award was originally given as part of the New York City Writers Conference, a 10-day program held each summer at Wagner College for aspiring fiction writers, poets and playwrights from 1956 through the late 1960s. Though a playwriting award was given at the inaugural conference, it was not until the conference’s second year, 1957, that the award was named for benefactor Alma Guyon Timolat Stanley of Dongan Hills, Staten Island.\n\nWINNERS OF THE STANLEY DRAMA AWARD\n\n2020 Truth Be Told, William Cameron 2019 Some Other Verse, Carl L.

Oliver\n\nALMA TIMOLAT STANLEY\n\nMrs. Stanley was the widow of Robert C. Stanley, former board chairman of the International Nickel Company of Canada Ltd. She was known as a patron of cultural and educational groups on Staten Island and elsewhere in New York City.\n\nA Staten Island Advance article of June 7, 1962 announced that Mrs. Stanley was to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Tampa, to be conferred by former Wagner College President David M. Delo. According to the Advance,\n\n… she has established scholarship programs at Wagner College, Stevens Institute of Technology and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nShe is a patroness of the Metropolitan Opera, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Stratford (Conn.) Shakespearean Festival.\n\nMrs. Stanley has been active in the Island’s Red Cross chapter since its inception in 1917, and has been a leader in the work of the Society for Seamen’s Children.\n\nFollowing Mrs. Stanley’s death on Jan. 6, 1971, an Asbury Park Press article recounted her support of the Visiting Nurse Association of Staten Island, adding that “Mrs. Stanley was active in many Staten Island community groups and was named Woman of Achievement by the S.I. Advance in 1963, Woman of the Year by the Soroptimist Club in 1961, [and] received the Distinguished Citizen’s Award from Wagner College in 1953.”\n\nSupport for the Stanley Drama Award after Mrs. Stanley’s death was continued by the Stanley-Timolat Foundation and Mrs. Stanley’s son, Robert C. Stanley Jr.\n\n1957 Stanley Drama Award winner:\n\nWilliam I. Oliver\n\nThe inaugural Stanley Drama Award was announced in the flyer for the 1957 New York City Writers Conference as well as in a mailing from NYCWC director Gorham Munson. A few details:\n\nCandidates could not submit themselves for the award. “A candidate must be proposed by a teacher of drama, a producer or director, a play agent, a playwright or a play reviewer.”\n\n“The candidate must attend the full session of the NYC Writers Conference [July 16-25] and carry out the duties of a Fellow [though those duties were not enumerated].”\n\nThe drama workshop leader that year was H.R. Hays.\n\nThe winner would receive a $500 prize, plus living and travel expenses for attendance at the conference. The winner’s play would “be produced on the closing nights [that is, the last three nights of the conference] by the Corn Cob Theatre, the summer theatre of the Staten Island Theatre Workshop, under the direction of Vincent Zangara.”\n\nSubmission deadline was May 1; the winner was to be announced by June 1.\n\nWhether the announcement date was missed, or just the press release, it was not until June 20 that the college announced the first winner of the Stanley Drama Award: “William I. Oliver, a graduate student at Cornell University. The award-winning play is ‘To Learn to Love,’ a three-act study of young sailors in the Canal Zone. Mr. Oliver attended the Drama Department of Carnegie Institute of Technology, has worked in the Cornell University Theatre for the last four years, and has been a director of a summer theatre.”\n\nWilliam I. Oliver spent the majority of his career (starting in 1958, the year after winning the Stanley Award) as a professor of drama at the University of California at Berkeley. Following his death in 1995, the U.C. Faculty Senate published this obituary written by his colleagues Travis Bogard, Henry May and Warren Travis:\n\nWilliam I. Oliver, Dramatic Art: Berkeley\n\n1926-1995\n\nProfessor Emeritus\n\nThe distinguished theatrical director, William I. Oliver, died suddenly on March 17 in San Jose, Costa Rica, where he was teaching and directing at the University of Costa Rica's School of Dramatic Arts. He leaves his wife, Barbara, and three children, Michael, Anna, and Soren.\n\nA retired professor of Dramatic Art at the University of California, Berkeley, Oliver was born in Panama City, Nov. 6, 1926, the son of Methodist teaching missionaries, Walter and Anna Skow Oliver. He was educated at Methodist schools in Panama City and the Canal Zone. During the second World War, since he was equally fluent in Spanish and English, he served there as a translator in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn 1946, he left the Canal Zone and entered the theatre department of the Carnegie Institute of Technology’s School of Fine Arts in Pittsburgh to study acting. He played two summer seasons at Woodstock, N.Y., opposite such stars as Lillian Gish. In 1950, he married a fellow drama student, Barbara Marsh, and together they moved to North Dakota to head the Fargo/Moorhead Community Players.\n\nIn 1953, the Olivers left North Dakota for Cornell University, where he studied for the Ph.D. For his doctoral dissertation he translated and wrote critical assessments of Federico Garcia Lorca and Lope de Vega.\n\nHe joined the faculty of the Department of Dramatic Art at Berkeley in 1958 and served as a teacher, director and administrator until his retirement in 1991. He taught stage direction, dramatic literature and criticism in classes that were distinguished by his lively and inquiring mind.\n\nHis work as a stage director with departmental students included many memorable productions, among them Ben Jonson’s “Bartholomew Faire,” the Jacobean melodrama “The Changeling” (with a young Stacy Keach), “Hamlet,” “Peer Gynt,” “Danton’s Death,” e. e. cummings’ “him,” Sartre’s “The Devil and the Good Lord,” O’Neill’s “Ah Wilderness!” and Giraudoux’s “Electra.” The wide range of his play selection was increased as he worked in the popular U.C. summer theatre, the Old Chestnut Drama Guild, where he directed standard classics such as Noel Coward’s “Fallen Angels,” Clarence Day’s “Life with Father,” Pinero’s “The Amazons” and Philip Barry’s “Holiday” and “The Animal-Kingdom.”\n\nHis directorial energies were often employed beyond the university theatre. He staged short plays for San Francisco’s One-Act Theatre Company and Berkeley’s Aurora Theatre, where he also appeared as an actor, playing with Barbara Oliver in “The Gin Game.”\n\nIn both Latin and South American companies, his talents as a critic and as a stage director are well-known. In 1966, he traveled to Santiago, Chile, where he taught at the University of Chile and directed ITUCH, the national theatre, in the Chilean premiere of Peter Weiss’s “Marat-Sade.” In Mexico City in 1974, in addition to classes at the School of Fine Arts, he directed Arthur Schnitzler’s “La Ronde.” He went three times to Costa Rica, where he both taught and staged productions, including Wilder’s “The Skin of our Teeth,” Euripides’ “Orestes” and Shakespeare’s “The Comedy of Errors.” During his fourth visit, he was preparing Albee’s “Seascape” in his own translation.\n\nHe was for several years a judge and critic at the prestigious El Paso Chamizal Festival of Golden Age Theatre, and in 1991 he was invited to present a paper in Cadiz at the first conference on educational theatre to be held in Spain.\n\nAs a translator, he was prolific, moving plays and novels and works of criticism from and to Spanish with ease. As a dramatist, he was the author of a trilogy on Spanish themes, “The Antifarce of Sir John and Leporello,” “The Masks of Barbara Blomberg” and “Dumbshows of the King.” The first two were premiered at Berkeley, the third was published in Spanish in a special edition, commemorative of the 500th anniversary of Columbus’s voyage.\n\nIn his teaching, as in his directing, Oliver displayed astonishing energy, insight and imagination. He had a penchant for long walks with his Scotty dog along Mendocino beaches, but his true happiness was found at rehearsal, facing a lighted stage, director’s script in hand, at once goading and inspiring his students, whether professional or amateur, to performances that often surprised the doers with the unexpected range and depth he elicited from them. In his work the lights of theatrical pleasure, thought, and emotion burned bright. He has left a darkened stage behind him.\n\n1958: Josh Greenfeld\n\nOn June 6, 1958, the Staten Island Advance announced that “the 1958 Stanley Award goes to Josh Greenfeld of Manhattan for his play ‘Hear That Sweet Laughter’ … [which] centers around a restaurant owner in a city ‘northern in size, southern in influence.’ The author … studied playwriting under Kenneth Rowe at the University of Michigan and John Gassner of Yale.”\n\nOn July 6, the Staten Island Advance announced, “A group of actors from within the Dongan Hills Players will present ‘Hear That Sweet Laughter’ ... tomorrow at 8 p.m. in the Coach House of the Richmond County Country Club. The play will be given as a dramatic reading with scenery and props. The director is Robert H. Nutt of Dongan Hills. ... The author, Josh Greenfeld of Manhattan, won the $500 Stanley Award for his work.”\n\nThe July 9 issue of the Sea Hawk Daily, the NYC Writers Conference newsletter, introduced “Josh Greenfeld of New York City as this year’s Stanley Award Fellow,” mentioning that his “play is under option to Aldrich, Bowman & Shurtleff, off-Broadway producers. Mr. Greenfeld is a free-lance magazine writer, often writing on sports. In the June Esquire he had an article on Fangio, world champion automobile racer.” [And a bit of NYCWC trivia: The Sea Hawk Daily was written by Wagner alumnus Paul Zindel ’58 M’62 H’71, himself an aspiring playwright. He produced the newsletter in return for his tuition to the NYCWC.]\n\nThe New York Age of July 12, 1958 included a brief, “Actors Sought For ‘Sweet Laughter’ ”: “Casting is now in progress for ‘Hear that Sweet Laughter,’ a comedy-drama of Negro life by Josh Greenfeld. Winner of the 1958 Playwriting Award of the New York Writers’ Conference, it will be produced by the firm of Alden Aldrich, Ross Bowman and Michael Shurtleff. Actors who are interested should contact the producers whose offices are at 117 West 13 Street. Rehearsals begin in August with a late September opening planned.”\n\nA year later, the April 9, 1959 issue of the Wagnerian, Wagner College’s student newspaper, reported that Greenfeld had won a grant of “$110,000 from the Ford Foundation. The money will be used to finance the production of this play in the fall of 1959. Mr. Greenfeld retitled his play, ‘Clandestine on the Morning Line.’ ”\n\n“Clandestine” was published in 1961 by Dramatists Play Service, which noted that “the premiere production … was given by the Arena Stage, Washington, D.C. The play was selected for presentation under the Ford Foundation’s Program for Playwrights in 1959. The production was directed by Alan Schneider.”\n\nThe online Lortel Archive notes that “ ‘Clandestine on the Morning Line’ [was] produced by Actors’ Playhouse, 100 Seventh Ave. South, New York — opened Oct. 30, 1961, for 24 performances — directed by Allen Davis, starring James Earl Jones (won 1962 Obie Award, Best Actor) and Rosetta LeNoire.”\n\nAnd, finally, Wikipedia provides the following biography for Josh Greenfeld:\n\nJosh Greenfeld (born 1928) is an author and screenwriter mostly known for his screenplay for the 1974 film “Harry and Tonto” along with Paul Mazursky, which earned them an Academy Award nomination and its star, Art Carney, the Oscar itself for Best Actor. Greenfeld also wrote “Oh, God! Book II” and the TV special “Lovey” and is the author of several books about his autistic son, Noah Greenfeld.\n\nThe trilogy, “A Child Called Noah,” “A Place for Noah,” and “A Client Called Noah,” detail the effects that Noah’s disabilities place on the Greenfelds and the extraordinary lengths that the family went through to find the very best care available for their son. His wife, Fumiko Kometani, is a Japanese writer and has won the Akutagawa Prize, Japan's most prestigious literary award; she too wrote about their son and his developmental disability. His older son, Karl Taro Greenfeld, a special contributor to Portfolio and Details, wrote his own story of growing up with Noah entitled “Boy Alone: A Brother's Memoir.”\n\nAmong Greenfeld's plays are “Clandestine on the Morning Line,” “I Have a Dream,” “The Last Two Jews of Kabul,” “Whoosh!,” and “Canal Street.” His novels include “O for a Master of Magic,” “The Return of Mr. Hollywood,” and “What Happened Was This.”\n\nIn 1968, Greenfeld signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.\n\nGreenfeld attended Brooklyn College; he received a B.A. from the University of Michigan and an M.A. from Columbia University.\n\n1959: Gene Radano\n\nThe June 15, 1959 issue of the Staten Island Advance featured the headline, “Mafia Story Wins 1959 Stanley Prize.” The story reads: “Gene Radano of 209 East 87 St., Manhattan, is the winner of the 1959 Stanley Award for his play, ‘The Apple Doesn’t Fall,’ it was announced today at Wagner College. … This year’s prize-winning play deals with the impact of the Mafia on Italian-Americans living in New York City.”\n\nThe same day’s New York Times says,\n\nThis year’s winner of the Stanley Playwriting Award is Patrolman Gene Radano, a warrant officer attached to the Lower Manhattan Magistrates Courts. …\n\nMr. Radano, who is 41 years old, was born in East Harlem and lives at 209 East Eighty-seventh Street. He is the father of two daughters and two sons. Mr. Radano has been a member of the Police Department since 1946.\n\n“The Apple Doesn’t Fall” is a contemporary play, dealing with the impact of the Mafia on an Italian family in Manhattan. …\n\nBesides “The Apple Doesn’t Fall,” Mr. Radano has written six other plays, none of which has been produced on Broadway.\n\nThe following month, on July 13 (during the NYC Writers Conference), the Times followed up with another story:\n\nThe program for the 1960 NYC Writers Conference noted that Radano’s “The Apple Doesn’t Fall” has been “optioned for Broadway production but has not to date opened.”\n\nThe following year, the Aug. 17 issue of the New York Daily News reported that a new play by Radano, “The Opening of a Window,” was in rehearsals for an opening at the Off-Broadway Theatre Marquee, 110 E. 58th St., on Sept 21. The story, titled “Cop’s Play to Open,” said,\n\nIf “all the world’s a stage,” then it stands to reason that playwrights can come from any place. One of the newest playwrights, Gene Radano, is a member of New York City’s Police Department. …\n\nA member of the force since 1946, Radano has been writing since 1943. To avoid criticism of “moonlighting” — working at another job while in the department — he will be on vacation for a month, beginning this week, when rehearsals begin.\n\nOn Sept. 1, 1961, the New York World-Telegram ran a more substantial story about Radano:\n\nRadano was also the author of two books, “Walking the Beat: A New York Policeman Tells What It’s Like on His Side of the Law” (World, 1968) and “Stories Cops Only Tell Each Other” (Stein & Day, 1974).\n\nKirkus Review panned “Walking the Beat,” which was evidently a fictionalized account but marketed as non-fiction:\n\nAlthough pegged as non-fiction, and the author swears he heard it all, this hazy view of the heroes of the precinct lacks the immediacy and veracity of authentic interviews or straight-forward reporting. Curiously defensive, the author, who is obviously not a cop himself, clips and pastes “case” episodes and dirty stories, unfunny and out of context. Some of the unhappy lot consists of inter-station house politics, unfair pressure from superiors, civic and judicial stumbling blocks to the follow through on arrests. The whole sticky business is seen as through the eyes of Paul, a rookie, and he is painfully initiated into the politics, the hopelessness of it all, the pecking order. Fascinating material is diluted and mangled by sensationalism of the quavering, supra-masculine, bogus Hemingway variety. Hopped up homage to the “police farce” and the long-suffering men in blue.\n\n1960: George Hitchcock\n\nA June 1960 Wagner College press release (date unspecified) announced that George Hitchcock of 2808 Laguna St., San Francisco, had won the 1960 Stanley Award for his play, “The Busy Martyr.” The play was nominated by Arnold Colbath, a drama professor at Catawba College in Salisbury, N.C., where “The Busy Martyr” had been staged on May 6, 7 and 8. The release said that “a production of the play is also planned during the fifth session of the New York City Writers Conference from July 12-22.”\n\nThe press release acknowledged the advice given to the Stanley judges by Richard Watts Jr., drama critic for the New York Post.\n\nThe release also named three plays for honorable mention:\n\nJoe LeSueur, “A Cool Wind over the Living.” Part of the New York School of poetry and longtime roommate and sometime lover of Frank O’Hara, LeSueur is perhaps best remembered for his posthumously published memoir, “Digressions on Some Poems by Frank O’Hara” (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 2003). “A Cool Wind” was taped for the second season of WNTA’s highly acclaimed series, “The Play of the Week” (air date March 27, 1961).\n\nNishan Parlakian, “Plagiarized.” Parlakian taught drama, speech and English literature at John Jay College and was a renowned authority on Armenian theater as well as a playwright. “Plagiarized” was one of several of his plays that were produced and published.\n\nGloria Demby Maddox, “Black Monday’s Children.” Bernard L. Peterson’s “Early Black American Playwrights and Dramatic Writers” includes an entry on Maddox: “Former student playwright at Fisk University, where she was also a member of the Fisk Stagecrafters. … After graduating from Fisk in the late 1940s, she became director of the Theatre of Wee Folks in Selma, Ala.” According to Peterson, an early version of “Black Monday’s Children” was produced as a one-act play in the 1940s by the Fisk University Stagecrafters. A copyright for “Black Monday’s Children: A Play in Three Acts,” by Gloria Demby Maddox, was filed on Aug. 17, 1959.\n\nThe July 14, 1960 issue of the Seahawk Daily said, “George P. Hitchcock, the Stanley Fellow in Drama, lists as his occupation: writer; stage director. He has contributed frequently to the literary quarterlies and little magazines, and is himself associate editor of the San Francisco Review. Scenes from ‘The Busy Martyr’ will be presented by the Dongan Hills Players on July 21.”\n\nHitchcock had a remarkable career before winning the 1960 Stanley Award, and an even more noteworthy life after it. Here is Hitchcock’s extraordinary obituary, written by William Grimes, published in the Sept. 4, 2010 issue of the New York Times:\n\nGeorge Hitchcock, whose poetry magazine, Kayak, born in the cultural ferment of the 1960s, was one of the most distinctive, eagerly read literary journals of its time, died on Aug. 27 at his home in Eugene, Ore. He was 96.\n\nHis death was confirmed by the poet Robert McDowell, an editor of “One Man Boat: The George Hitchcock Reader” (2003).\n\nMr. Hitchcock, a former actor, playwright and political organizer, founded Kayak in 1964 and for the next 20 years ran it as a one-man show. He designed the magazine, edited it, printed it, illustrated it and organized the collating parties where its pages were stapled together, slipped into mailing envelopes and stamped.\n\nWith great ingenuity, he created Kayak’s archly cruel rejection slips: Victorian engravings depicting a beheading, or a mountain climber slipping into a crevasse, with a brush-off caption appended.\n\nHe was, as he liked to say, Kayak’s dictator. “A kayak is not a galleon, ark, coracle or speedboat,” read the motto printed with each issue. “It is a small watertight vessel operated by a single oarsman. It is submersible, has sharply pointed ends, and is constructed of light poles and the skins of furry animals. It has never yet been successfully employed as a means of mass transport.”\n\nAlthough he leaned toward surrealism and the dreamlike style of the deep imagist school, Mr. Hitchcock included a wide variety of poets, publishing the early work of Philip Levine, Raymond Carver, James Tate and Charles Simic.\n\n“He was the pre-eminent maverick independent magazine publisher,” said Howard Junker, the editor of Zyzzyva: The Journal of West Coast Writers and Artists. “He was open in his tastes, unflagging in his energies, knew everyone and kept the thing going against all odds.”\n\nGeorge Parks Hitchcock was born on June 2, 1914, in Hood River, Ore. He attended the University of Oregon, where he was a reporter on the school newspaper, and received a bachelor’s degree in 1935.\n\nAfter school he worked as a reporter for The Western Worker in San Francisco and as the sports editor of The People’s Daily World, for which he wrote a sports column under the byline Lefty. He also became friends with Kenneth Rexroth, who encouraged his interest in poetry.\n\nWhen the United States entered World War II, he enlisted in the Merchant Marine, which sent him to the South Pacific and put him to work as a cook and waiter.\n\nAfter the war he traveled throughout California trying to organize dairy unions. He later taught at the California Labor School.\n\nIn the 1950s, while working as a landscape gardener, he began writing plays and acting with two San Francisco repertory companies, the Interplayers and the Actor’s Workshop.\n\nDuring the Oregon Shakespeare Festival in 1957, the House Un-American Activities Committee summoned him to testify in San Francisco, where he delivered what may well have been his finest performance.\n\nWhen asked to state his profession, he answered: “I am a gardener. I do underground work on plants.” He then refused to answer questions about membership in the Communist Party, “on the grounds that this hearing is a big bore and waste of the public’s money.”\n\nThe director of the Shakespeare Festival demoted him to spear-carrying roles.\n\nPhysically imposing — a hefty 6-foot-4 — Mr. Hitchcock cut a flamboyant, dandyish figure. “He reminded me of those bigger-than-life character actors in Hollywood movies, like Wallace Beery and Charles Laughton, or like Vitamin Flintheart, the ostentatiously dressed and extravagantly posturing character in Dick Tracy comic books,” the poet Morton Marcus wrote in his memoir, “Striking Through the Masks.”\n\nIn 1958 Mr. Hitchcock became an editor of The San Francisco Review, which had published his two-act play “Prometheus Found.” Soon after the review ceased publication in 1963, Kayak was born.\n\nIt made an immediate impact. Mr. Hitchcock had a strong personality, visual flair and keen eye for writing talent. The long list of poets and writers who found a home in his pages included W. S. Merwin, Anne Sexton, Robert Bly, Margaret Atwood and Hayden Carruth. Criticism, reviews, the occasional prose piece and Mr. Hitchcock’s collages rounded out the content.\n\nKayak enjoyed fights. It set up in opposition to revered publications like The Kenyon Review and The Hudson Review, and nourished a spirited contempt for what it saw as the overly intellectual poetry of writers like Robert Lowell and Richard Wilbur.\n\nCreatively frugal, Mr. Hitchcock acquired an offset press from the Pacific Steamship Line that had been used to print menus and learned to run it himself. He printed one issue on paper that the Army had rejected for target-practice use.\n\nKayak operated outside the world of foundation grants and government support, although the National Endowment for the Arts, unsolicited, gave the magazine two grants. Mr. Hitchcock used most of the money to publish books by Mr. Simic, Carver, Carruth and others. He used $500 to create a prize for the best poem about Che Guevara.\n\nIn 1970 Mr. Hitchcock moved the Kayak operation to Santa Cruz, Calif., where he had been hired to teach playwriting and poetry at the University of California, Santa Cruz. In 1984 he rang down the curtain, and Kayak ended its run after 64 issues.\n\n“Any more, and it would risk seeming an institution,” Mr. Hitchcock said. “After that, ossification and rigor mortis.”\n\nAn early marriage ended in divorce. He is survived by his longtime companion, Marjorie Simon; a sister, June Harman of St. Helena, Calif.; a son, Stephen, of Carbondale, Ill.; two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.\n\nMr. Hitchcock was rather cavalier about his creative brainchild and its influence. “In 1964 I found most American poetry magazines extraordinarily boring,” he told the magazine Caliban in 1986. “I thought that Kayak might relieve the tedium, c’est tout.”\n\n1961: Ernesto Fuentes\n\nThe 1961 Writers Conference was the first to involve Wagner College English professor Willard Maas. A minor poet who had not published in years, Maas was nonetheless well known in New York City for his experimental filmmaking as well as the wild parties he threw in his Brooklyn Heights penthouse apartment with his wife, experimental filmmaker Marie Menken. Maas and Menken were the real-life inspirations (if it can be called that) for the lead couple in Edward Albee’s “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” (See the Winter 2013-14 issue of Wagner Magazine, pages 18-23.)\n\nIn the April 13, 1961 issue of the Advance, the first results of Maas’s wide network of celebrity contacts were made evident: the judges for the 1961 Stanley Drama Award included “Molly Kazan, dramatist and wife of movie director Elia Kazan; playwright Edward Albee, and Dr. John Hruby, chairman of the drama division of Wagner College and director of the school’s Varsity Players.” Instructors for the conference were Albee, novelist Saul Bellow and poet Robert Lowell.\n\nA June 14 press release announced the Stanley winner as Ernesto Fuentes for “La Loca.” Fuentes, born in Artemisa, Cuba and a graduate of the Municipal Dramatic School in Havana, had lived in the U.S. since 1950. His street address was 282 E. 35th St., Brooklyn.\n\nThe press release also “announced that the play will be produced on the Wagner campus July 20-22 by the Hilltop Summer Theatre.”\n\nA separate press release dated June 13, announcing auditions, called the play “a drama of passion and violence … set in a South American country in modern times.” The venue for the campus staging would be the Main Hall auditorium. The release also said that Fuentes “has written five plays, two of which have been optioned for professional production.”\n\nAn extremely clever June 30 press release had Willard Maas’s fingerprints all over its prose:\n\nAttention all goats interested in acting\n\nThere is a small but important acting role for a goat in the Hilltop Summer Theatre production, “La Loca,” according to the director, Dr. John Hruby.\n\nIf you are interested in appearing in the production, to be presented on the Wagner College campus July 20-22 as part of the New York City Writers Conference, submit your application to the director.\n\nThe role, as described in the script, requires that you be a good listener, inasmuch as the leading lady confides in you quite often.\n\nGarbage and tin cans will be supplied to keep you happy, Dr. Hruby said. He added that temperamental goats need not apply inasmuch as he’s having enough trouble dealing with another of the performers: a stage-struck rooster.\n\nA July 12 press release from the college was supplemented with original reporting, probably by theater critic Jack Reycraft, when it ran in the July 15 issue of the Staten Island Advance:\n\nThe following week, however, after Reycraft had actually seen the production, he wasn’t nearly so generous:\n\nInterestingly, “La Loca” apparently has both a “before” Stanley Award story, and an “after” story.\n\nIn the May 27, 1959 edition of Dorothy Kilgallen’s syndicated column, “The Voice of Broadway,” she said, “Ernesto Fuentes, an unknown Cuban playwright, has had his first drama, ‘La Loca,’ accepted by Roger L. Stevens for fall production. The plot revolves around the Cuban revolution as it affected families in the Oriente Province. Some years ago, author Fuentes was a dishwasher in a New York restaurant.”\n\nKilgallen’s column, first published in 1938, ran in more than 140 newspapers nationwide.\n\nA Wagner College press release of June 14, 1961, confirmed that “La Loca” “was at one time optioned by producer Roger L. Stevens, but the option expired due to production conflicts.”\n\nRoger Lacey Stevens was an American theatrical producer, arts administrator and real estate executive. He was the founding chairman of both the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts (1961) and the National Endowment for the Arts (1965).\n\nOn March 5, 1968, seven years after “La Loca” won the Stanley Award, a new copyright was filed for the play, with a revised name: “La Fiesta, a play in three acts by Ernesto Fuentes. … Appl[ication] states prev[iously] reg[istered] as La loca.”\n\nAnd five years after that, on Oct. 18, 1973, the Columbia University newspaper, the Spectator, published an advertisement: “Columbia Players presents Ernesto Fuentes’ LA FIESTA November 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 8:00 p.m., Wollman Auditorium.”\n\n1962: Terrence McNally\n\nThe first press release on file for the 1962 Stanley Drama Award competition, dated March 26, announced the judges: playwright Edward Albee, actors Geraldine Page and Kim Stanley, producer David Susskind and Wagner drama professor John Hruby. The release added, “A staged reading of the winning script will be given as part of the conference’s annual meeting.”\n\nThe following day, an article in the Staten Island Advance also named the instructors for the 1962 NYC Writers Conference: dramatist Edward Albee, poet Kenneth Koch and novelist Kay Boyle.\n\nThere were a couple of irregularities in the 1962 competition.\n\nFirst: Though Stanley Drama Award submissions were supposed to be plays “that [have] never been produced professionally,” Terrence McNally’s submission, “This Side of the Door,” had been produced by Richard Barr on Jan. 1, 1962 at the Cherry Lane Theater as part of Barr’s Playwrights 1962 series, directed by Martin Fried and featuring Estelle Parsons and William Traylor — several months before its submission for the Stanley Award.\n\nSecond: For the second year in a row, Edward Albee was one of the Stanley Award judges. Albee, however, should probably have recused himself from the judging that year because he and McNally had been romantically involved since 1960.\n\nAside from those irregularities in choosing the 1962 Stanley winner, there is no denying that it was the first time the award had gone to a playwright with a major career ahead of him. The award winner was announced in a press release dated July 7.\n\nThe release said, “This year’s winner, Terrance McNally [sic], a resident of Manhattan, graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Columbia University in 1960. During his senior year he wrote the school’s varsity show entitled, ‘A Little Bit Different.’ He has also been a stage manager for the player’s workshop at the Actors Studio in Manhattan.”\n\nRichard Stayton, in a 1992 Los Angeles Times Magazine story on an upcoming revival of McNally’s “It’s Only a Play,” gave a painfully frank description of McNally’s first drama:\n\nHis first serious attempt at playwriting occurred in his early 20s and was a one-act titled “This Side of the Door.” That rough beginning might have ended his playwriting career.\n\n“It’s the only play I’ve ever written that was so autobiographical I found it painful to watch,” he says. “I put that play away. I don’t know where it exists.”\n\nIn fact, a crudely typed original script of “This Side of the Door” exists in the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center. To read it is to find very little evidence of the later, mature McNally. In it, an alcoholic, abusive, failed salesman rages at his “fairy son”: “Want to hear about my problem?” the father drunkenly asks. “I was born with a perpetual, perennial, eternal and life-ever-after hard-on.”\n\nThough McNally said “he put that play away” [referring to “Door”], the Gale study guide for his play, “Master Class,” says that, “after revisions, [‘This Side of the Door’] became ‘And Things That Go Bump in the Night’,” which premiered on February 4, 1964 at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis and ran on Broadway in 1965 for 16 performances — a two-week run.\n\nFour runners up won “awards of distinction” in the 1962 Stanley Drama Award competition:\n\nGene Radano, the 1959 Stanley winner (evidently, the later Stanley Award rule against submissions by previous winners had not yet been imposed)\n\nHerbert Schapiro of New Brunswick, N.J. His obituary ran in the Oct. 31, 2014 issue of the New York Times:\n\nHerb Schapiro, a writer and teacher whose idea to create a stage play from the collected essays of poor city kids resulted in a hit musical, “The Me Nobody Knows,” died on Oct. 17 at his home in Brooklyn. He was 85.\n\nHis son, Mark, said the cause was complications of non-Hodgkins lymphoma.\n\nCalled “a dark and lovely rock-folk musical” by the New York Times critic Clive Barnes when it opened at the Orpheum Theater Off Broadway in May 1970, “The Me Nobody Knows” tells the stories, largely in their own words, of a dozen children, mostly black or Puerto Rican, and what it was like for them to grow up poor in New York City.\n\nMr. Schapiro called it a “ghetto ‘Under Milk Wood,’ ” referring to the Dylan Thomas drama peopled by the inhabitants of a Welsh fishing village.\n\nIn December of that year, the show moved uptown to Broadway, where it ran for nearly a year, joining “Hair,” the celebrated musical with which it shared a contemporary score and immersion in the culture of young people.\n\nCamille Atherton of Brooklyn. According to a pair of published obituaries, Camille Marie Atherton, 86, a resident of Gresham, Oregon, died Thursday, May 20, 2010. Atherton was born and raised in Chicago, but she later moved to New York in 1952 to advance her career and raise her family. She lived there until 1999. Atherton received her bachelor’s degree from the New School in New York City, then her master’s degree from Hunter College, becoming a rehabilitation counselor for the state of New York. For pleasure, Camille was an amateur playwright, gardener and gourmet chef. She was divorced. She moved to Oregon in 2001.\n\nAugusta Walker, then of New York. Her obituary, written by Baltimore Sun staff writer Jacques Kelly, ran in the Oct. 11, 2000 issue of that paper:\n\nAugusta Walker, 86, novelist, playwright, yoga devotee, Waverly resident\n\nAugusta Walker, a novelist, playwright and yoga devotee, died Thursday of cancer at Genesis Eldercare Long Green Center. She was 86 and had lived on Greenmount Avenue in Waverly.\n\nMiss Walker wrote four novels, including a much-praised 1954 work, \"Around a Rusty God.\" The novel, a tale of a boy who raised goats, was translated into several languages and was condensed by Reader's Digest.\n\nMarjorie Snyder, a critic for the Boston Herald, said the book had \"the simplicity and beauty of a fable; a delicate tale with universal appeal and ineffable charm.\"\n\nMiss Walker wrote \"The Eating Valley\" in 1956, \"A Midwest Story\" in 1959 and \"A Back-Fence Story,\" published in 1967.\n\nIn 1954, her short story, \"The Day of the Cipher,\" won the O. Henry Award for the best short story of the year. It had been published in the Yale Review.\n\nIn 1992, when she was 78, she won the Baltimore City Artscape Award for her play, \"Herbert's Major Breakthrough,\" which depicts a husband smashing through the walls of the apartment he shares with his wife. As he knocks down a wall with a sledgehammer, he wants to know \"what's really out there on the other side!\"\n\nIn 1974, when high New York rents troubled her, Miss Walker moved to Mathews Street in Baltimore, where she had a backyard vegetable garden with a grape arbor.\n\n\"She was a resourceful woman who lived off the garden all summer,\" said David Diorio, a friend and publisher of Icarus Press in Towson. \"She made her own clothes and went to the Goodwill. Money was not important to her. It was her spiritual search that was the important thing in life.\"\n\nMr. Diorio said Miss Walker traveled through the neighborhood on the bus. She wheeled groceries in a wire cart.\n\n\"Very few [people] really knew about her earlier success as a novelist,\" Mr. Diorio added.\n\nSeveral times a week, Miss Walker walked to the Siddha Yoga Center in the Marylander Apartments at University Parkway and St. Paul Street to prepare it for classes and vacuum its floor.\n\nShe became interested in the teachings of mystic philosophers while on a fellowship in England in the 1950s. She was a follower of the Armenian mystic George I. Gurdjieff.\n\n\"You never got the sense that life had treated her poorly,\" said Alice MacArthur of Washington, a friend. \"She was a vigorous person, intelligent, kind, quiet. But she spoke her mind.\"\n\nBorn on a farm outside Cincinnati, Ohio, Miss Walker received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.\n\nShe taught at Lingnan University in China until 1950, when she was forced to leave by the Communist regime. She later studied for a doctorate in comparative literature at Columbia University.\n\nA memorial service for Miss Walker will be at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Stony Run Friends Meeting House, 5116 N. Charles St.\n\nShe had no immediate survivors.\n\n1963: Adrienne Kennedy\n\nAdrienne Kennedy submitted the script for her one-act play, “Funnyhouse of a Negro,” in her application for Edward Albee’s playwriting workshop at the 1962 NYC Writers Conference. In that year’s contest for the Stanley Drama Award, however, Kennedy was passed over in favor of a script by Albee’s then-boyfriend, Terrence McNally. Kennedy submitted “Funnyhouse” again for the Stanley in 1963 — and won. It also won a 1964 Obie Distinguished Play award for its production by the East End Theater in New York, which opened in January of that year, and has been translated into several languages from English. In 1964, “Funnyhouse” was published, in full, in the Wagner Literary Magazine, No. 4 — a publication edited by Willard Maas, director of the NYC Writers Conference in 1963. It was also later published by the theatrical publisher, Samuel French.\n\nAccording to an April 8 press release, the judges for the 1963 Stanley Award were actor Shelly Winters, playwright Edward Albee, Living Theatre co-director Julian Beck, and Wagner College drama professor John Hruby.\n\nHere is the introductory biography to her Wikipedia entry:\n\nAdrienne Kennedy (born Sept. 13, 1931) is an African-American playwright. She is best known for “Funnyhouse of a Negro,” which premiered in 1964.\n\nKennedy has been contributing to American theater since the early 1960s, influencing generations of playwrights with her haunting, fragmentary lyrical dramas. Exploring the violence racism brings to people's lives, Kennedy's plays express poetic alienation, transcending the particulars of character and plot through ritualistic repetition and radical structural experimentation. Much of her work explores issues of race, kinship and violence in American society, and many of her plays are “autobiographically inspired.”\n\nIn 1969, New York Times critic Clive Barnes wrote, “While almost every black playwright in the country is fundamentally concerned with realism — LeRoi Jones and Ed Bullins at times have something different going but even their symbolism is straightforward stuff — Miss Kennedy is weaving some kind of dramatic fabric of poetry.” In 1995, critic Michael Feingold of the Village Voice wrote, “with [Samuel] Beckett gone, Adrienne Kennedy is probably the boldest artist now writing for the theater.”\n\nKennedy is noted for the use of surrealism in her plays, which are often plotless and symbolic, drawing on mythical, historical, and imaginary figures to depict and explore the African-American experience.\n\nThe second part of Adrienne Kennedy’s 1963 Stanley Award-winning package was “The Owl Answers,” a one-act experimental play. Wikipedia summarizes the play:\n\nIt premiered in 1965 at [Lucille Lortel’s] White Barn Theatre in Westport, Connecticut one year after Kennedy's most well-known piece, the Obie Award-winning “Funnyhouse of a Negro.” Though written as a companion piece to “Funnyhouse of a Negro,” “The Owl Answers” is most commonly produced with another of Kennedy’s one-acts, “A Beast’s Story.” This production of two one-acts was named “Cities in Bezique” when it appeared Off-Broadway. [It premiered in January 1969 at the Public Theater.]\n\nIn “The Owl Answers,” an African-American girl dreams of establishing a heritage and imagines she is applying to bury her father in Westminster Cathedral. Historical figures scorn her, doubting the possibility of a black girl having that heritage. She argues that her father was white and her mother was his family’s cook. As a child, she had to enter through the back door when she wanted to visit her father.\n\nThe setting of the play shifts between the New York City subway, the Tower of London, a Harlem hotel room, and Saint Peter’s. Each setting utilizes the structure of a subway car and is filled with the sounds of the subway. Themes include identity, mortality, memory, and race relations.\n\nAccording to a July 12 brief in the Berkshire Eagle (Pittsfield, Mass.), the judges named Timothy M. Sheldon of Hawthorne House, Devon Road, Pittsfield, for an award of distinction in the Stanley Award competition. In 2003, the Berkshire Eagle ran Sheldon’s obituary:\n\nTimothy M. Sheldon, 65, of 46 Bartlett Ave. and Tophill Farm, Devon Road, Lee, died Sunday, June 22 while undergoing surgery at Berkshire Medical Center. He had been selected as Pittsfield’s poet laureate in April by the city’s Cultural Council and presented with an plaque by Mayor Sara Hathaway on April 30.\n\nHe was planning poetry programs for the Pittsfield schools and for public speaking and reading engagements during his two-year tenure, and had recently presented the mayor with a sheaf of new poems.\n\nBorn in New York City on April 15, 1938, son of Kenneth P. and Lorna Lowes Sheldon, he attended Haverford College in Pennsylvania and later received his master of fine arts degree from Yale Drama School. He had been a longtime resident of Lee, and also had lived in Montana, Kansas City, Mo., and Boston, and had spent a summer in Nigeria.\n\nHe was a 20-year veteran of the Army Reserve.\n\nMr. Sheldon was employed at Home Depot and Bousquet Ski Resort in Pittsfield. He was a contributor and editor for Animal Life Magazine. He frequently read his work to audiences at the WordPlay gatherings at Papyri Books in North Adams and at the Poetry Group in Springside Park in Pittsfield.\n\nHis verse play, “Rose Hill,” was broadcast on National Public Radio by WGBH-FM in Boston in 1974 and 1975 in 24 hourly episodes. His most recent drama, “The Poetry Show,” will be presented later this year by the Berkshire Writers Room. One of his poems appears in this week’s issue of Berkshires Week.\n\nWhile at Haverford, he began a friendship with Peter Rockwell, whose father, Norman Rockwell, used Mr. Sheldon as a model for two of his paintings: the window-washer cover for the Saturday Evening Post of Sept. 17, 1960, and an Army Reserve poster for which, in 1983, Mr. Sheldon was interviewed on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” He was a member of the National Rifle Association, a nature photographer and an author.\n\nHe leaves his former wife of 24 years, Rosemary Sheldon of Lee; a stepdaughter, Rochelle O’Gorman of Lee, and a stepson, Mark Caruso of Ponte Vedra, Fla.\n\n1964: Megan Terry + Joseph Baldwin (dual)\n\nIn 1964, the Stanley Drama Award was given to two playwrights for two dramas submitted entirely on their own: Megan Terry of Manhattan for “Hothouse” and Joseph Baldwin of Lincoln, Neb. for “Thompson.”\n\nAccording to a June 15 story in the Advance, the judges for the 1964 Stanley Drama Awards were Arnold Weinstein, author of “The Red Eye of Love” and head of the NYC Writers Conference drama workshop; Michael Smith, associate editor and drama critic of the Village Voice; Wagner drama professor John Hruby, and English professor J.J. Boies, Writers Conference coordinator.\n\nJoseph Baldwin, ‘Thompson’\n\nDuring the 1964 NYC Writers Conference, John Hruby directed a production of Joseph Baldwin’s “Thompson” in the Main Hall auditorium, played by veterans of the Staten Island amateur stage.\n\nFrom the Nebraska Authors website: Joseph B. Baldwin, born 1918-05-18 Tazewell, Tenn., died 1994-12-27 Lincoln, Neb. Joseph Baldwin was a renowned poet and playwright whose work appeared regularly in College Verse, Sou’wester, Prairie Schooner, and Southwestern Review. His one-act play, “Engine 8444,” was inspired by his lifelong love of trains and was performed in New York City in 1974 and on the Nebraska Television Network in 1979. Baldwin earned his B.A. in English at the University of Texas, and an M.A. and Ph.D. in speech and dramatic arts from the University of Iowa. He worked as a professor of speech, dramatic arts and theatre arts at the University of Nebraska, Lincoln. In addition to “Thompson” and “Engine 8444,” his titles include “Almost Too Many,” “Bachelor of the Year,” “The Finer Things: A Farce in One-Act” (1961), “The Waiting Game,” “He and She,” “At Last, He Said No,” “Snow for the Lovers” and “Committees Forever: A Comedy in One Act” (1963).\n\nJoseph Baldwin’s article, “Producing New Plays in the University Theatre,” was published in the Educational Theatre Journal, Vol. 7 No. 1, March 1955, pp. 22-26. Use this link to download a PDF of the article.\n\nMegan Terry, ‘Hothouse’\n\nDuring the 1964 NYC Writers Conference, Arnold Weinstein led a staged reading of Megan Terry’s “Hothouse” on the Guild Hall terrace, read by “professional actors of the Off-Broadway stage.”\n\nFrom Megan Terry’s Wikipedia profile: Megan Terry (born July 22, 1932, as Marguerite Duffy) is an American playwright, screenwriter, and theatre artist having produced more than 50 discrete works for theatre, radio, and television. She is perhaps best known for her avant-garde theatrical work from the 1960s where, as a founding member of New York City’s Open Theater, she developed an actor-training and character-creation technique known as “transformation” that she used to create her 1966 work, “Viet Rock,” the first rock musical and the first play to address the war in Vietnam.\n\nFrom the Broadway Play Publishing website: Megan Terry’s plays include “Breakfast Serial,” “Calm Down Mother,” “Keep Tightly Closed in a Cool Dry Place,” “Hothouse,” “Ex-Miss Copper Queen on a Set of Pills,” “The People vs Ranchman,” “Goona Goona,” “Mollie Bailey’s Traveling Family Circus: Featuring Scenes from the Life of Mother Jones,” “Pro Game,” “Body Leaks,” “Sound Fields” and “Objective Love.” She has published over 45 plays. Most have been translated and produced worldwide. She has won a number of major writing awards, including a Guggenheim Fellowship and an Obie Award for “Approaching Simone.” She was elected to lifetime membership by the College of Fellows of the American Theatre, installation at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C., in recognition of “distinguished service to the profession by an individual of acknowledged national stature.” In 1992 she was named Nebraska Artist of the Year. Ms. Terry is photographer and co-editor of “Right Brain Vacation Photos: New Plays and Production Photographs, 1972–1992.” Ms. Terry has a degree from the University of Washington, certificates in acting, directing and design from the Banff School of Fine Arts in Banff, Alberta, Canada, and was awarded the Yale-ABC Fellowship: Writing for the Camera at Yale University. She has had a long association with the Omaha Magic Theatre in Omaha, Nebraska, as playwright in residence, photographer, performer and musician.\n\nFrom the website, enotes.com: In her play, “Hothouse,” inspired by her relationships with her mother and grandmother, Terry explores the expectations society places on female behavior. While admiring her treatment of feminist themes, some critics faulted Terry's reliance on autobiographical material. [Note that this website, as well as Wikipedia's bibliography, gives 1974 as the date for “Hothouse,” though Terry won the Stanley Award for “Hothouse” in 1964.]\n\n1965: Lonne Elder III\n\nThe 1965 Stanley Drama Award went to Lonne Elder III, “formerly of Jersey City,” for his play, “The Ceremonies in Dark Old Men.”\n\nA brief published in the June 26 issue of the Newark Evening News said,\n\nComposer-playwright Rick Besoyan and actress Blanche Yurka judged the competition ...\n\nA professional actor since 1954, Elder was in the original presentation of “A Raisin in the Sun.” “Ceremonies” is his second full-length play. The young Negro writer’s first major theatrical work, “A Hysterical Turtle in a Rabbit Race,” won a $3,000 award from the John Hay Whitney Foundation.\n\nThe introductory biography for Elder’s Wikipedia profile says,\n\nLonne Elder III (Dec. 26, 1927 – June 11, 1996) was an American actor, playwright and screenwriter. Elder was one of the leading African-American figures who aggressively informed the New York theater world with social and political consciousness. He also wrote scripts for television and film. His most well-known play, “Ceremonies in Dark Old Men,” won him a Drama Desk Award for Most Promising Playwright and was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize. The play, which was about a Harlem barber and his family, was produced by the Negro Ensemble Company in 1969. In 1973, Elder and Suzanne de Passe became the first African Americans to be nominated for the Academy Award in writing. [They were nominated for] Best Adapted Screenplay ... for the movie “Sounder,” starring Cicely Tyson, Paul Winfield, and Kevin Hooks.\n\nLater in the Wikipedia entry on Elder, it specifically addresses “Ceremonies”:\n\nIn 1965, “Ceremonies in Dark Old Men” was given a reading at Wagner College on New York’s Staten Island. The reading of the play propelled him to a fellowship in screenwriting at the Yale University School of Drama in 1966 and 1967, and won him several other financial awards. ...\n\nThe Negro Ensemble Company’s [1969] “Ceremonies in Dark Old Men” was one of the most meaningful theatrical events of the late 1960s, a culmination of Elder’s meditations on the black family unit in a hostile American society. Edith Oliver from The New Yorker stated in her review, “Ceremonies is the first play by Lonne Elder III to be done professionally, and if any American has written a finer one I can’t think what it is.” James Baldwin wrote, “ ‘Ceremonies in Dark Old Men’ is the most truthful play I have seen in a long time. Everyone connected with it deserves a prize, especially the author, Lonne Elder III.”\n\n“Ceremonies” garnered positive reviews, and was the runner-up for the 1969 Pulitzer Prize in drama, along with several other drama awards. The play deals with a 1950s Harlem family—Russell B. Parker, a barber (portrayed by Ward in the original production) who spends most of his time reminiscing about his glory days as a vaudeville dancer, his two unemployed sons, who live on the edge of the law, and his daughter, who resentfully supports the family.\n\nElder said in the New York Times: “I wrote to write, out of my guts and my heart, I wanted to cause some kind of wonder in the minds of people. I don’t rant or rave about the terror of our racist society. It is never directly stated, it is just there.”\n\nBy the time it was revived in 1985, the New York Times noted, “the play had become a contemporary classic.” The subsequent productions of the play nurtured the stage careers of several prominent actors, including Denzel Washington, Billy Dee Williams, Keith David, and Laurence Fishburne. A profound influence on the works of August Wilson and films such as “Crooklyn” and “Boyz in the Hood,” “Ceremonies” remains the definitive black American family drama and the blueprint for how to tell that story.\n\n1966: Albert Zuckerman\n\nThe 1966 Stanley Drama Award went to Al Zuckerman for his play, “To Become a Man.”\n\nIn the author’s profile from “Writing the Blockbuster Novel,” first published by Macmillan in the mid-1990s, his publisher said,\n\nAlbert Zuckerman has been a literary agent and book doctor to some two dozen blockbuster novels. He is the founder of Writers House, a firm that represents hundreds of leading writers in all categories. Author of two published novels, winner of the 1964 [sic] Stanley Drama Award, former writer for three television series, Zuckerman has also taught playwriting at the Yale School of Drama. He lives in New York with his wife and still takes on projects by new authors.\n\nA donor story published on the Yale Giving website gives a little more detail of Zuckerman's background:\n\nThe impeccably preserved Victorian-era townhouse on West 26th Street in New York City is where Yale School of Drama alumnus Albert (Al) Zuckerman ’61 MFA, ’62 DFA has based his notable business for more than thirty-ﬁve years. Al is the founder of Writers House, one of the largest literary agencies in the world. Writers House represents writers and illustrators of ﬁction and non-ﬁction, for both adult and juvenile readers. Books are everywhere at Writers House: one can’t turn one’s head without being confronted by the works of best-selling, prize-winning authors: Ken Follett, Erica Jong, and Stephen Hawking; as well as numerous Nobel Prize, National Book Award, and Pulitzer Prize recipients.\n\nBefore immersing himself in the world of books, Al was an ambitious young playwright. After graduating from Princeton, he served in the U.S. Navy and then went to work for the State Department. One of Al’s plays, published in Best Short Plays of 1956, became the impetus for his application for admission to Yale School of Drama.\n\n“Going to Yale was a life changing experience,” Al declares. “The inﬂuence of John Gassner, then head of the playwriting department, was transformative. Gassner taught me everything: how to build a scene, how to construct a character.” Upon graduation, at Gassner’s invitation, Al stayed on to teach ﬁrst-year playwriting. “I came to the realization that I could help other writers.” He has been doing just that ever since.\n\nZuckerman died in 2011.\n\n1967: William Parchman\n\nAn April 7 press release announced that the judges for the 1967 Stanley Drama Award would be George C. White, president of the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theatre Foundation, and Ben Tarver, co-author of “the current off-Broadway musical hit ‘Man with a Load of Mischief.’ ”\n\nThe 1967 competition was still part of the NYC Writers Conference program, and a formal production of the winning entry was held in conjunction with the conference in July. Wagner English professor Jack Boies was identified as the NYCWC director.\n\nA June 13 press release announced the selection of seven Stanley Award finalists:\n\nClaris Nelson, New York City — Her plays include “Rue Garden” (Cafe Cino, 1962), “Medea” (Cafe Cino, 1962), “Neon in the Night” (Cafe Cino, 1964), “The Girl on the BBC” (La MaMa, 1965), “Passing Fancy” (London: Samuel French, 1994), “To the Land,” “A Road Where the Wolves Run” (Circle Rep, 1972) and “The Clown: A Fantasy” (1967). In later life, under the name Claris Erickson, she was an actor in the Circle Repertory Company.\n\nA.R. Gurney Jr., West Newton, Mass. — His Wikipedia entry summary reads, “Albert Ramsdell Gurney Jr. (Nov. 1, 1930 – June 13, 2017), as pen name A.R. Gurney (sometimes credited as Pete Gurney), was an American playwright, novelist and academic. He is known for works including ‘The Dining Room’ (1982), ‘Sweet Sue’ (1986/7) and ‘The Cocktail Hour’ (1988), and for his [1990] Pulitzer Prize-nominated play ‘Love Letters.’ His series of plays about upper-class WASP life in contemporary America have been called ‘penetratingly witty studies of the WASP ascendancy in retreat.’ ”\n\nBruce Kessler, New York City — Among his plays are “Son of Fricka” (La MaMa, 1963), “The Collapse” (La MaMa, 1964), “Not Entirely Non-Descript but Persephone in the Sun” (La MaMa, 1969). He is referred to in “Playing Underground: A Critical History of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway Movement” as one among “other, largely forgotten La Mama playwrights.”\n\nDavid Watmough, Vancouver, B.C., Canada — His Wikipedia bio reads, “David Arthur Watmough (Aug. 17, 1926 – Aug. 4, 2017) was a Canadian playwright, short story writer and novelist. Watmough was born in London, England, and attended King’s College London. He has worked as a reporter (the Cornish Guardian), a ‘Talks Producer’ (BBC Third Programme) and an editor (Ace Books). He immigrated to Canada in 1960, to Kitsilano in Vancouver, British Columbia, where he lived for 40 years with his partner, ex-Californian Floyd St. Clair (1930–2009), an opera critic and, from 1963 till his retirement in 1996, a University of British Columbia French professor. He became a Canadian citizen in 1967. Watmough lived from 2004 to 2009 in Boundary Bay and before his death had been living at Crofton Manor, a Vancouver assisted-living facility. In 2008 he published his autobiography, ‘Myself Through Others: Memoirs’.” The only one of his works written in 1967, according to his Wikipedia selected bibliography, is “Names for the Numbered Years: Three Plays.”\n\nRobert Kornfeld, New York City — The Riverdale Press ran an extended obituary on Sept. 1, 2010: “Robert Kornfeld, a successful playwright, photographer and journalist, who was responsible for creating the Riverdale Historic District, died while recovering from pneumonia at the Allen Pavilion in Inwood on Aug. 23. He was 91. ... He wrote numerous plays, including ‘The Art of Love,’ ‘The Celestial’ — which opened at the governor’s mansion in Wisconsin — and ‘Passage in Purgatory,’ produced off Broadway and in Shanghai. ‘The Gates of Hell,’ considered by many to be Mr. Kornfeld’s best, had an extended run at the Theater for the New City in the East Village.” For the rest of his amazing obituary, go to https://bit.ly/2MJ19JL.\n\nWayne F. Maxwell Jr., New York City — The author’s bio in his 2005 children’s book, “The Little Blue Lamb,” says, “The late Wayne F. Maxwell Jr. was born in Kansas, raised in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and graduated from Tulsa University’s theater department. His talents as an actor-director-playwright were seen On- and Off-Broadway, Los Angeles, and London’s West End. He loved children and wrote lovingly for them while waiting for calls for stage and film work.” A description of the Wayne F. Maxwell Jr. papers, housed in the University of Tulsa’s McFarlin Library, says, “The Wayne F. Maxwell Jr. papers consist of the typescripts and/or photocopied typescripts of five plays, two screenplays, five short stories, and several untitled poems written by Wayne F. Maxwell Jr., a University of Tulsa speech major (Class of 1954), actor, director, and playwright. Some of Maxwell’s plays were written and produced while he was a student at the university. Further information about Maxwell and his activities with the University of Tulsa theatre may be found in The Kendallabrum, 1951-1955.”\n\nWilliam Parchman, Mineola, N.Y. was finally named as the winner of the 1967 Stanley Award for “The Prize in the Crackerjack Box.” — Parchman was one of four playwrights to receive a $3,500 grant in 1968 under the Eugene O’Neill Foundation-Wesleyan University fellowship program, sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. His play, “The Mocking Bird,” was performed in July 1969 at the Playwrights Conference sponsored by the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theater-Foundation in Waterford, Conn.\n\n1968: VENABLE HERNDON\n\nThe 1968 Stanley Drama Award went to Venable Herndon for “Bag of Flies.”\n\nVenable Herndon was born on Oct. 19, 1927 in Philadelphia and died Dec. 8, 1999 in New York. He was the son of Hunter Venable and Isabelle Kearney (Flaig) Herndon.\n\nIn 1969, the year after winning the Stanley Award, Herndon won the Writers Guild Award for his screenplay of “Alice’s Restaurant,” written with director Arthur Penn.\n\nAccording to the website, Prabook.com, Herndon earned his high school diploma from Lawrenceville School, 1945; his bachelor’s degree from Princeton University, 1949; and his master of arts degree from Harvard University, 1951. From 1951 to 1967, he worked as an advertising copywriter for the Gimbels and Bamberger’s department stores, and as an account executive for Hicks and Greist Advertising, New York. He worked as a studio screenwriter from 1967 to 1974 for United Artists, Paramount and Columbia films. From 1975, he taught in the dramatic writing program at New York University.\n\nFollowing Herndon’s death, the Princeton Alumni Weekly published “Memorial: Hunter Venable Herndon ’49”:\n\nVen died Dec. 8, 1999, of acute Leukemia. He was 72. He came to Princeton from the Lawrenceville School and majored in modern languages, graduating with high honors. He was a member of Cloister Inn. He served in the Army.\n\nAfter graduation Ven became a playwright and screenwriter as well as a teacher of those arts at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. He was still active in teaching there until just before his death. His best known screenplay was his 1969 collaboration with the director Arthur Penn on “Alice’s Restaurant.” The movie starred Arlo Guthrie and was based on Guthrie's song of the same name. He was also the author of a book about the life of James Dean.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Sharon Anson, and a daughter, Isabelle Molinaro. The class extends its deepest sympathy to them both.\n\nPlaybill published an obituary by Kenneth Jones, “NYU Dramatic Writing Professor Venable Herndon, 72, is Dead,” on Dec. 15, 1999:\n\nVenable Herndon, a playwright, biographer and screenwriter who taught in New York University's dramatic writing program, died Dec. 8 in Manhattan. He was 72 and the cause of death was acute leukemia.\n\nAn associate professor of screenwriting in NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Mr. Herndon earned his bachelor’s in French literature at Princeton and his master of fine arts in comparative at Harvard, and penned such plays as “Until the Monkey Comes ... ” (staged in New York, Chicago and Berlin), “Bag of Flies” and “Independence Night.”\n\nHis screenplays include “Alice's Restaurant” (directed by Arthur Penn), “Too Far to Walk” (for Otto Preminger), “Uncle Sam's Wild West Show” (for Paul Mazursky) and more.\n\n“He came here originally to teach in the film school, which he started doing in 1975,” said Mark Dickerman, chair of the NYU Tisch dramatic writing program. “He was always considered a screenwriting teacher, though he certainly had intense and important relationships with playwrights. He was a terrific dramaturg, and students sought him out. Venable would say things aloud that most human being don’t. He was always controversial, provocative and outrageous.”\n\nBoth playwrights and screenwriters would make the trek to Mr. Herndon’s NYU office (the door always was open) for advice about work, Dickerman told Playbill On-Line. “He was very blunt, but he had such affection for the person whose work he was talking about that, as blunt as he became, people never objected,” Dickerman said. “Venable got people to think in vital ways about themselves, which he thought was important if they were going to be good writers. He became a habit for people. Once you were Venable-ized, that was it.”\n\nIn addition to his dramatic writing, Mr. Herndon was founder and editor of the literary journal, Chelsea Review (1958-1966) and penned a biography, “James Dean: A Short Life.”\n\nHe is survived by wife Sharon Anson and daughter Isabelle Molinaro of Manhattan.\n\n1969: Bernard Sabath + Yale Udoff (dual)\n\nTwo winners were named for the 1969 Stanley Drama Award, the last time dual winners were named:\n\n“A Happy New Year to the Whole World Except Alexander Graham Bell,” Bernard Sabath\n\nTwo one-acts: “The Club” and “The Little Gentleman” by Yale Udoff\n\nOther than the names of the winning plays and playwrights, we have no information on file for the 1969 Stanley Awards.\n\nBernard Sabath, ‘A Happy New Year to the Whole World Except Alexander Graham Bell’\n\nA manuscript of “A Happy New Year” is housed in the University of South Florida Library. Described as “a play in five scenes,” the play is about how “Samuel Clemens turns down Alexander Graham Bell’s appeal to invest in his new invention, the telephone.”\n\nSabath was fascinated by Mark Twain. A second play written in 1969 was titled, “The Man Who Lost the River: A Play About Sam Clemens.”\n\nIn December 1985, Chicago Tribune critic H. Lee Murphy wrote about two more Mark Twain plays written by Bernard Sabath, giving more information about the playwright’s interest in the author of “Tom Sawyer” and “Huckleberry Finn”:\n\nThe playwright Bernard Sabath has been absorbed by Mark Twain ever since Sabath’s own boyhood years ago in a small town upriver from Twain’s hometown of Hannibal, Mo. Now, in the sesquicentennial of Twain’s birth, Sabath is finding new forums in which to indulge his affection.\n\nNew York’s Circle in the Square Theatre recently announced that it will produce Sabath’s “The Boys In Autumn,” a memory-filled meeting of Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn when they have grown into old age, circa 1924. The play will star George C. Scott and is tentatively set for a late spring opening. It has been a while coming, since a 1981 production in San Francisco starring Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas got no Broadway offers.\n\nCloser to home, the Theatre of Western Springs [in suburban Chicagoland] is presenting the Midwest premiere of Sabath’s companion piece titled “Hannibal Blues,” which centers on a single reappearance by Tom’s first sweetheart, Becky Thatcher, in Hannibal, also in the 1920s.\n\nThe 52-year-old Sabath, an instructor for years at Northwestern University before a recent migration to Sarasota, Fla., to try his hand full time at playwrighting, finished “Blues” in the late 1970s. But the show has had just a single major showing, by the StageWest Repertory Co. last year in Springfield, Mass.\n\n“I guess I’ve always been fascinated by the Mississippi River and Mark Twain,” Sabath said in an interview last week. “You have to know his characters pretty well before you can bring them up to date.”\n\nA visit to last week’s opening in Western Springs found “Hannibal Blues” a curious consideration of the adult Becky. Long gone are the innocent pigtails and white lace frocks. This cynical visitor is a firebrand of a tomboy, wearing a man’s fedora and hiking boots and projecting a hard-bitten feminist outlook that might give any modern-day activist cause to blanch. Her untethered independence is punctuated by recitations from Emile Coue, a French exponent in the 1920s of a distinctive type of positive thinking. Most of the rest of her dialogue could have been penned by the radical philosopher Ayn Rand.\n\nThere isn’t much of a plot here. Becky falls and injures herself while exploring the same cave where she and Tom became lost years before and ends up spending an evening with a God-fearing Roy Fulton and his son Ben. As Becky sits on the clapboard front porch, her tales of big cities and the jazz bands she has known pose quite a contrast to Hannibal’s humble agrarian setting. At first wide-eyed, the elder Fulton is ultimately liberated by the conversation, driven to a telephoned reconciliation with his runaway wife in California.\n\nThe stories aren’t particularly colorful, and the characters seem somehow indistinct even at the end of two hours. Nonetheless, the cast never falters. A lanky, angular Terry Fanning, who has been acting with this group for a decade, invests Becky with a noble pridefulness that balances her less-sympathetic rebellious side. Noel Smith drawls his way through the part of Roy Fulton, while Mark Jolicoeur exhibits a fine adolescent awakening as son Ben. Ted Kehoe’s direction is attentive to the backwoods trappings of the play.\n\nWhen “The Boys in Autumn” was staged in April 1986 at the Circle in the Square, New York Times critic Frank Rich was not impressed. (And no mention was made of George C. Scott playing in the production.)\n\nRich wrote, “While this [Broadway] season never did produce any cutthroat competition for the honor of best play, the worst play sweepstakes is being bitterly contested right up to the final hour. ‘The Boys in Autumn,’ a terminally innocuous speculation about Huckleberry Finn and Tom Sawyer in middle age, almost makes one long for ‘The Boys of Winter,’ a Vietnam war drama that had been the prize 1985-86 turkey until this point. ... Mr. Sabath has ... given the men lurid secrets that reduce two of the most beloved characters in our cultural heritage to extras in a Harold Robbins novel.”\n\n“Autumn” was later staged at Honolulu’s Hawaii Theatre, in June 2010, featuring “Wheel of Fortune” host Pat Sajak as the adult Tom Sawyer. It is not clear whether or not the production was ironic in intent.\n\nYale Udoff, two one-acts: ‘The Club’ & ‘The Little Gentleman’\n\nYale Udoff, a successful playwright and screenwriter, was at the beginning of his career when he won the 1969 Stanley Drama Award for his two early one-act plays, “The Little Gentleman: A Domestic Fantasy in One Act” and “The Club.”\n\nIn his November 2005 review for Backstage magazine, Dave DePino writes:\n\nIn ‘The Little Gentleman,’ surreal and darkly comedic, we meet cute-as-a-button 2-year-old Ronald [played by an adult actor], who speaks perfect English, with an English accent. His mother is more concerned with gifts from her husband and battling with her mother about her own upbringing than with realizing that her child needs special attention. Aunt Sylvia arrives, adding to the dysfunction and giving Ronald a good look at the sad family he’s been born into.\n\n“The Little Gentleman” has been published three times — twice in collections, and once in a magazine:\n\n“Best Short Plays 1971,” ed. Stanley Richards (Phila., Pa.: Chilton Book Co., 1972)\n\n“9 Modern Short Plays: Outstanding Works from Stage, Radio and Television,” ed. David A. Sohn and Richard H. Tyre (Bantam Books, 1977)\n\nLiterary Cavalcade magazine (March 1972)\n\n“The Little Gentleman” was staged at least twice, according to the playwright: once in the Pacific Resident Theatre in Venice, Calif., in February 2005; and again in November 2005 at the Laurelgrove Theatre in Hollywood, Calif. For the Laurelgrove Theatre production, “The Little Gentleman” was staged together with another Udoff one-act play, “Nebraska,” under the umbrella title, “States of Mind.”\n\nThe second half of Udoff’s two-part Stanley Award-winning submission, “The Club,” is set in a steam room, where a group of Jewish men in their 60s nervously wait for their secret agreement to take place. An old Italian joins them, threatening their stability, and bringing their agreement to fruition. [Synopsis provided by the author on his website, yaleudoff.com.]\n\nUdoff received his greatest critical acclaim for his first full-length stage play, “A Gun Play,” which premiered at the Hartford (Conn.) Stage Company in early 1971. New York Times theater critic Mel Gussow gushed, “Its author, Yale M. Udoff, is a discovery. … I suspect that even more will come later.” And when the play moved to New York’s Cherry Lane Theatre that October, Times theater critic Clive Barnes wrote, “There is a cold and fine madness to … ‘A Gun Play.’ … It is to be recommended, largely for itself but also partly for the very evident promise of Mr. Udoff. When you are seeing his second and third plays, it will be agreeable to recall that you saw his first.”\n\nUdoff had many writing credits following “A Gun Play,” but none that met with such critical acclaim. Among those credits are the screenplays for Nicolas Roeg’s confusing “Bad Timing/A Sensual Obsession” (1980) and “Eve of Destruction,” starring Gregory Hines.\n\nBorn in 1935, Udoff is a graduate of Michigan State University, attended Georgetown Law School, and served as an infantry officer in the United States Army. His wife, Sally Shulamit Udoff, died in 2010. Yale Udoff died July 19, 2018.\n\nFor more details about Udoff’s work, visit the playwright’s website, yaleudoff.com.\n\nYale Udoff died July 19, 2018 in Burbank, California. He was 83.\n\nStewie Griffin and ‘The Little Gentlemen’\n\nRonald, the titular character in Yale Udoff’s “The Little Gentleman” is described in the play’s stage notes as “a child somewhere between the ages of one and three. … He speaks with a British accent. The fact that he is being portrayed by an adult actor should not be used to burlesque the dramatic situation.”\n\nTo those familiar with the Fox Television animated series, “Family Guy,” this description will remind them of one of the recurring characters, Stewie Griffin, an (initially) evil baby genius. Stewie speaks in an Oxbridge accent, though it’s never entirely clear how many other characters can understand him except for the family dog, Brian; the baby and the dog are the most intelligent members of the family.\n\nWe wrote to Udoff on Aug. 17, 2018, asking if he had ever heard of any connection between Ronald and Stewie. Unfortunately, unbeknownst to us, Udoff had died four weeks earlier. His associate, Alicia Beach, did reply to our email, however, saying, “While Yale is no longer with us to answer your query, what I can say is that I did hear such speculation from Yale directly.”\n\nA search on the Internet for questions about the origin of the Stewie character on “Family Guy” disclosed not one but two claims of possible plagiarism — but neither involved “The Little Gentleman.” The two similar characters at issue are Barry Ween, created by Judd Winick, and Jimmy Corrigan, created by Chris Ware. Both characters appeared in graphic novels named for them.\n\nOf the two similar characters, only one was first published before the first broadcast of “Family Guy” — and that character is the least similar to Stewie.\n\nStewie first appeared in the 15-minute “Family Guy” pilot, which aired after the Super Bowl on Jan. 31, 1999.\n\nChris Ware’s “Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth” first appeared in Acme Novelty Library #5, published in the spring of 1995. While several images of Jimmy reproduced from the graphic novel series do bear a striking resemblance to Stewie Griffin, the truth is that Jimmy Corrigan is portrayed in the novel mostly as an adult with little resemblance to Stewie. Here’s the “incriminating” comparison most often presented on the Web:\n\nJudd Winick’s character, Barry Ween, actually bears a closer resemblance, both graphically and in character traits, to Stewie Griffin. In “The Big Book of Barry Ween, Boy Genius,” we find a boy of about 10 with a head shaped similar to Stewie’s, the sideways football. Like Stewie, Barry is a genius, probably smarter than anyone else in the world; and, like Stewie, he has a penchant for high-technology devices, especially weapons. Here is a comparison image:\n\nThe problem with allegations of plagiarism of Barry by Stewie, however, is timing: Winick’s character did not make his first appearance until several weeks after the first airing of the “Family Guy” pilot. “The Adventures of Barry Ween, Boy Genius, Vol. 1” was published in March 1999. “Barry Ween” was almost surely already in production when the “Family Guy” pilot first aired, so it is virtually certain that Barry was not copied by Stewie — but neither is it conceivable that Stewie could have been copied from Barry, who had not yet appeared in print.\n\nAnd neither Barry Ween nor Jimmy Corrigan bear any resemblance to Yale Udoff’s character, Ronald, in “The Little Gentleman.” The only thing we can learn about the dual origin controversies related to the Stewie character in “Family Guy” is that certain features of fictional characters seem to recur without necessarily arising from plagiarism.\n\n1970: RICHARD LORTZ\n\nJudges for the 1970 Stanley Drama Award competition were announced — for the first time, NOT in conjunction with the (now defunct) NYC Writers Conference. “Guest judge” was Wagner alumnus Paul Zindel ’58 M’62, whose new play had just opened Off-Broadway, “The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds.” (It won the 1971 Pulitzer Prize as well as an honorary Wagner doctorate for Zindel.) The other judges were Lowell Matson, chairman of the college’s new Department of Theatre and Speech, and English professor J.J. Boies, director of the competition. The submission deadline was May 11.\n\nA July 27 press release announced the six finalists for the 1970 Stanley Drama Award:\n\nLewis Colca, Manhattan, “Buzzards Bay,” “a 1970 version of high comedy.” According to the Granville (Ohio) Sentinel, the Welsh Hills Players of Newark, Ohio, presented the premiere of “Buzzards Bay” on March 20, 1973.\n\nGerry Carroll, Los Angeles, “Bruce,” “a historical drama of Robert Bruce of Scotland.” “Bruce” was one of the plays developed in 1971 at the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's National Playwrights Conference.\n\nBronson Dudley, Manhattan, “Leftovers,” “a satiric fantasy with musical interludes.” A memorial blog about Dudley said, “Bronson was an actor and playwright. ... None of his plays hit it big, but he had a successful early career as a dancer on the stage and a late career as a character actor in TV and films. His most memorable film role was Bill in Steve Buscemi’s 1996 ‘Trees Lounge.’ ... Bronson was born January 27, 1920 and died Shrove Tuesday, February 20, 2007.” According to a New York Magazine theater schedule, “Leftovers” was staged in July and August 1972 by the New York Theater Ensemble, 2 E. 2nd St., Manhattan. Three years later, according to New York Times writer Phyllis Funke, “Leftovers” was staged in an innovative production by the Writers in Residence company in Great Neck, Long Island. Funke said the one-act play “deals with the meeting between an aging actress and an aspiring young playwright, both of whom need to talk.”\n\nCraig Clinton, Woodmont, Conn., “A Lamentable Disposition,” “an ‘absurd’ play.” In its 1971-72 season, Playwrights Horizon in Manhattan staged Clinton’s “A Shared Thing/Lunch Hour”; the following year, “Lunch Hour” was staged at the Manhattan Theater Club, 321 E. 73rd St. Today, Clinton is professor emeritus in the theatre department at Reed College in Portland, Oregon, which he joined in 1978. He says, “My primary interests in theatre are in the areas of directing and playwriting. Undergraduate studies at Antioch College and San Francisco State [B.A. 1967, M.A. 1969]. Graduate study at Yale Drama School and Carnegie Mellon University [Ph.D. 1972]. Publications include pieces on Tennessee Williams, Trevor Griffiths, William Inge, and Tom Stoppard.”\n\nM. Sullivan, Pittsburgh, Pa., “Matilde,” “a series of three related one-acts.” Mary Eileen Sullivan, writing under the pseudonym L.M. Sullivan, also published “Cinder Box: An Illusion in One Act With Marches, Dances, a Limerick & Canzonets,” with co-authors Joseph Meyer & Rebecca Red-Shaw, 1970; “Happy House: A Play in Two Acts,” 1972; and “Baron’s Night, or Catch as Catch Can,” in “New Plays By Women,” ed. Susan LaTempa (Berkeley, Calif.: Shameless Hussy Press, 1979).\n\nRichard Lortz, Manhattan, “Three Sons,” “a drama based on the prodigal son story.”\n\nOn Aug. 18, Wagner announced that Richard Lortz had won the Stanley Award for “Three Sons,” “which has as its central theme the return of the prodigal son.” The press release went on to say:\n\nA native of New York City who also maintains a home in Belle Harbor, Long Island, Mr. Lortz holds a degree in creative writing from Columbia University and has had two novels published both here and in England, “A Crowd of Voices” and “A Summer in Spain.” In the 1950s he wrote many television plays for such CBS-TV series as “Suspense,” “Danger” and “The Web,” and had another play, “The Journey With Strangers,” produced off-Broadway in 1958. Currently, his play, “The Others,” a supernatural drama, is being filmed in England by Carter De Haven and Eric Winter with the screenplay written by Gillian Freeman, scenarist for “Leather Boys” and “One Cold Day in the Park.” Another play, “The Juniper Tree,” will be produced at the new Sybil Thorndike Theatre in London this season.\n\nIn addition to writing, Mr. Lortz paints, and has exhibited his paintings in several one-man shows. Represented by Mary Dolan of the Gloria Safier Agency, he presently works in an editorial capacity for Media Horizons, publishers of trade magazines. …\n\nDr. Lowell Matson, chairman of the Department of Speech and Theatre at Wagner College … will direct a full production of “Three Sons” at Wagner in October using a professional cast.\n\nWhen it was premiered in October 1970 on the Wagner College Theatre stage, “Three Sons” was retitled “Of Sons and Brothers.”\n\nOn April 6, 1971, a Wagner College press release announced that “Of Sons and Brothers” was “scheduled to premiere on Broadway in the coming fall season. … The drama will go into rehearsal in the late summer under the direction of Alan Schneider, known for his direction of Edward Albee plays and as director of ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf.’ The drama was optioned for Broadway production at its opening night on the Wagner campus. … Lortz’s drama centers on the Biblical prodigal son story but the action takes place in a West Side laundromat.”\n\nNothing appears to have come of Schneider’s planned Broadway production of Lortz’s prodigal-son drama — but the following year, Lortz’s “Voices” opened on April 3, 1972 at Broadway’s Ethel Barrymore Theatre. It ran for just one week — eight performances. Perhaps mercifully, no reviews can be located.\n\nIn 1973, “Of Sons and Brothers” resurfaced, this time under the title, “Prodigal,” opening on Dec. 16 at the Circle Theater — later known as the Circle Repertory Theater — which, while located on Broadway was not a “Broadway” theater; because of the number of seats, it was considered “Off Off Broadway.”\n\nA Dec. 14 preview story by Staten Island Advance theater writer Elaine Boies (wife of Stanley Drama Award director Jack Boies) was titled, “Stanley Award Drama Did Better at Wagner.” (No bias, of course.)\n\nBy any name, [“Prodigal”] is a powerful reworking of the prodigal son theme into an emotionally charged contemporary family drama.\n\nThe playwright deals with love and compassion, jealousy, sin, penance, and expiation of guilt followed by further transgressions. It is a search for oneself, a search for one’s soul.\n\nWillie Nathan [the titular prodigal son] never finds it. Or does he?\n\nReturning to the fold — his family’s Laundromat — as mysteriously as he left it seven years ago, Willie dredges up conflicting passions among his parents and two brother.\n\nWillie has stolen from his father, and squandered $50,000. Is he to be forgiven, welcomed, accepted, or shunned and punished?\n\nLortz’s drama is laden with anguished family confrontations that hinge on Willie, the middle child, the “handsome prince,” the favored one who has learned to use his charm to con the world.\n\nHe returns home broken, spent, having wallowed in the dregs of depravity until he was born again of a new innocence — he says.\n\nSlowly, subtly, the playwright lets the audience become aware that it, too, is taken in by Willie’s magnetism. Is he a Christ figure — or a devil? Or simply a man who failed in his quest for the Grail? …\n\nAt Wednesday night’s preview, it was apparent that several roles, especially Willie, were seriously miscast.\n\nReticent though he is, the playwright had to agree that the 1970 Staten Island production was superior to what’s happening now.\n\nSalem Ludwig, who recreates the father role he originated at Wagner, and Judd Hirsch as Saul, the eldest son whose love is taken for granted, are superb. The others are wrong for their parts.\n\nLortz’s play is still there, simmering provocatively beneath the surface presented by the cast.\n\nTo find it, the critics will have to close their eyes and conjure up characters more appropriate to the playwright’s words. It’s a tough job.\n\nToo bad they never saw it at Wagner.\n\nClive Barnes reviewed the opening night’s performance at the Circle Theater for the Dec. 18 issue of the New York Times:\n\n“The Prodigal” … is a conventional family melodrama with Biblical overtones. It is set in a laundromat on Manhattan’s West Side and it concerns the return of Willie to the family home.\n\nWillie has been away for seven years. When he left he stole $50,000 as a personal going-away present, and on his travels he seems to have done everything from killing onward. His life sounds spectacularly decadent, but it is difficult to know whether the author means us to believe him or not.\n\nMr. Lortz’s language is as high‐flying as Icarus. There is validity to this story of three brothers: Saul, the hard‐working eldest brother who counts the petty cash and drives a white Cadillac; the thriftless but beautiful middle brother, Willie, prodigal and charming; and the youngest brother, Joey, planning a runaway but not, presumably, with any of the family fortune. Add a Jewish mother with chicken soup instead of blood in her veins, and a Jewish father strong on both justice and forgiveness, and you have the makings of a fairly stereotyped family ball game. The writing and dramaturgy never quite jell.\n\nWhy should the youngest brother go the way of the prodigal when he is so obviously different in temperament? Yet this incident is the only one that provides the play with its dramatic development as opposed to its characterization. The story of the prodigal is very predictable.\n\nThe big difficulty is Mr. Lortz’s lack of a way with words. This could change, and certainly he already understands how to build up an effective scene. But he must listen to the way people talk and react.\n\nThe permanent setting by Philip G. Gilliam tried to suggest both laundromat and living room and fell down somewhere between the washer and the sofa, and Marshall W. Mason's direction proved too declamatory, in a way that emphasized rather than minimized the playwright's ornate rhetoric.\n\nThe performances were good. I was particularly impressed with Judd Hirsch’s baffled, puzzled and bullying eldest brother, clumsily dealing with life’s most unfair proposition, that good guys finish last. Ted Leplat had a decently neat air of Dorian Gray sensuality as the spoiled prodigal.\n\nAll in all this was by no means an unrewarding attempt at a play, but it is an attempt essentially more notable for its real promise than its real achievement.\n\nOuch.\n\nRichard Lortz, born in New York on Jan. 13, 1917, died on Nov. 11, 1980 at the age of 63. A New York Times article said that he died “of a heart attack while visiting his physician in the Bronx.”\n\n1971: BERNARD ‘BEN’ ROSA\n\nA brief in the Wagner College alumni magazine announced that “Ben Rosa, a former construction worker turned playwright, is the winner of the 1971 Stanley Drama Award for his three-character play entitled ‘Obtuse Triangle.’ Rosa, who lives at 11 Waverly Place in New York City, will receive $500 and a showcase production of his script at Wagner College in the fall.”\n\nAside from the subtitle of Rosa’s play, “A Romantic Comedy in Two Acts,” preserved in the list of Stanley Award winners, nothing is known of Bernard “Ben” Rosa except his birth date — June 11, 1930 — and the date of his death, Jan. 17, 2010, in West Islip, Long Island.\n\n1972: MARVIN DENICOFF\n\nA July 21, 1972 press release announced the finalists for that year’s Stanley Drama Award:\n\nGene Boland, Los Angeles, “Nobody Sings Like Aunt Hagar’s Children.” Boland was a TV writer and actor in the late 1960s, most often referred to in material written about that period as, specifically, a black writer and actor. He was one of the first African Americans to write for network television series in the Sixties, including “Peyton Place,” “Julia” and “That Girl.” His acting credits include episodes of “Adam-12,” “Dragnet,” “T.H.E. Cat,” “Daktari” and “I Dream of Jeannie.”\n\nJohn L. ‘Jack’ Leckel, Cicero, Ill., “To Hang is to Dangle.” Leckel headed the theater program at J. Sterling Morton East High School in Cicero. Besides “To Hang,” he was the author of a number of plays with various university productions, including “Blue Is The Antecedent Of It,” “Department Store” (1973) and “Mustapha On Stilts.” He received local Emmy nominations for “As Adam, Early in the Morning,” a 1966 CBS Repertoire Showcase production co-authored with actor William Marshall, and “Nothin’ Like Us Ever Was.” His first novel, “A Warning Thunder,” is set in Louisiana immediately following the Civil War. His second novel, “A Brief Trip to the Moon,” is self-published on Amazon. Between 1979 to 2001, with co-author/illustrator Agnes M. Feeney, Leckel wrote several books about the history — and, sometimes, specifically the cooking history — of Illinois, including “The Great Chicago Melting Pot Cookbook.” In addition to these works, Leckel has published articles for educational journals. He earned his M.A. in theatre architecture from the University of Illinois at Urbana.\n\nWhitney Stine, Hollywood, Calif., “Maestro,” music by Fran Ziffer, lyrics by Martin Kalmanoff.\n\nWhitney Stine, born 1930, is best known as the author of \"I'd Love to Kiss You: Conversations With Bette Davis\" and \"Mother Goddam: The Story of the Career of Bette Davis.\" She is also the author of several other show-business books as well as a number of novels.\n\nFran Ziffer also wrote music for \"Three on a Bed: A Musical Satire,\" words by Horty Belson & Thomas Hill (1974), and for \"One Foot to the Sea\" (1953) and \"Dakota\" (1951) at the Originals Only Playhouse, Manhattan. Born in Baltimore, Md., Frances Ziffer Burgio of Allentown, Pa., formerly of New York City, died Thursday, Nov. 7, 1996.\n\nMartin Kalmanoff (1920-2007) was born in Brooklyn and studied piano and composition from the age of 7. He earned bachelors (1941) and masters (1943) degrees in music from Harvard. He began his career as a popular songwriter, sometimes writing his own lyrics, but mostly collaborating with either Atra Baer (his first wife) or Aaron Schroeder, though he often worked with other lyricists. Artists who recorded his songs included Sammy Kaye, Guy Lombardo, Connie Francis, Julius LaRosa, Vic Damone, Engelbert Humperdinck, Roy Rogers, Billy Butterfield and Elvis Presley. As his career progressed, Kalmanoff devoted most of his energy to operas and musicals; collaborators included Eugene Ionesco, William Saroyan, Eric Bentley and Lewis Allen. The Martin Kalmanoff papers are housed in the New York Public Library's Archives & Manuscripts department.\n\nMarvin Denicoff, Potomac, Md., who had submitted two plays for the competition: “Fortune Teller Man” and “Wilma’s Freak Show.”\n\nThe 1972 Stanley Drama Award went to Marvin Denicoff for “Fortune Teller Man.” The Sept. 26, 1972 Wagnerian said,\n\nDenicoff, who is director of information services for the Office of Naval Research in Washington, D.C., won this year’s $500 award for a play called “Fortune Teller Man,” a drama about a once-serious playwright who has been ruined by trying for years to fit himself to the formulae of Hollywood scriptwriting. …\n\nAccording to Denicoff, he has two careers: one in scientific research and one in writing. The former career, says the playwright, is what has supported the Denicoff household. For the Navy, Denicoff administers a basic research contract program in such fields as linguistics robotics, automata theory, pattern recognition, software development, etc.\n\nBut Denicoff, the writer, has also published many short stories over the years. They have appeared in a number of literary magazines, including Whit Burnett’s “Story Anthology.”\n\nBorn and raised in Philadelphia, Denicoff graduated from Temple University in 1949 with a degree in liberal arts. He did graduate work in literature and linguistics at Temple and Mexico City College. He worked at the Office of Naval Research from 1960 to 1983, when he helped found Thinking Machines Corporation, where he worked until 1996.\n\nIn 1985, Denicoff described to Fortune magazine writer Brian Dumaine a scheme for using computers to assist in writing plays:\n\nMarvin Denicoff, an artificial intelligence expert and an award-winning playwright, thinks a computer could help a dramatist write plays. In his vision, still very much on paper, the playwright would draft a scene and then set up a stage on his computer screen by drawing on a rich database of stock characters, sets, and costumes. He would then instruct his electronic actors to speak and move in any way he wished until he was satisfied with the scene. The playwright could also use a computer to show his finished play to potential investors.\n\nThe Aug. 31, 1972 press release announcing that Denicoff, 48, had won the Stanley Drama Award noted that “Fortune Teller Man” was the fourth play Denicoff had written. The others were “Wilma’s Freak Show,” also submitted for the 1972 Stanley, “A Cage for a Songbird” and “The Doctor is Sick.” No record could be found of any of these shows being produced.\n\nMarvin Denicoff died on July 1, 2013, at the age of 88. He was survived by his wife of 63 years and their four sons.\n\n1973: C. RICHARD GILLESPIE\n\nThe New York Times of Oct. 25, 1973 announced that C. Richard Gillespie of Baltimore had won that year’s Stanley Drama Award for his play, “Carnivori.”\n\nIn a September 2012 news story, the Baltimore Times said,\n\nC. Richard (Dick) Gillespie has his master and doctoral degrees in theatre from the University of Iowa. He started in the theatre as an actor, but found his life’s work in teaching and directing. In 1961 he founded the academic theatre program at Towson University (then Towson State Teachers College) and taught there for 37 years. During his career he directed more than 75 productions in educational, professional and experimental theatres. He has directed plays from the full literature of the theatre including the Greek, Shakespearean, Restoration, Medieval, Romantic, Oriental and Contemporary repertories. His last two productions at Towson were critically acclaimed interpretations of Tennessee Williams’ seldom-produced plays, “Clothes For A Summer Hotel” and “Something Cloudy, Something Clear.” For eighteen summers he directed summer productions in the Maryland Arts Festival. Dr. Gillespie is the author of two books: “Papa Toussaint,” a novel based on the last five years in the life of Toussaint Louverture the liberator of Haiti; and “The James Adams Floating Theatre,” the history of a show boat that sailed the Chesapeake Bay and the North Carolina sounds between the world wars and was the model for Edna Ferber’s novel, “Show Boat.” He has written several plays, one of which, “Carnivori,” won the Stanley Drama Award.\n\n“Carnivori,” written in 1971, was based on Gillespie’s experiences as an Army Signal Corps photographer during the Korean War. The play was produced at Baltimore’s Corner Theater.\n\nThe Baltimore Times story, above, was written about a performance of A.R. Gurney’s “Love Letters” in which Gillespie and his wife, Maravene Loeschke, were about to perform. Gillespie was then professor emeritus at Towson University, and Loeschke had recently been inaugurated as Towson’s president. Like her husband, Loeschke had an academic as well as a performing background in the theater.\n\nGillespie died on April 2, 2016 at the age of 85.\n\n1974: GUS WEILL\n\nThe 1974 Stanley Drama Award went to Gus Weill for his play, “The Son of the Last Mule Dealer.” Judges for that year’s award were George C. White III, president of the Eugene O’Neill Memorial Theatre Center, Wagner College Theatre head Lowell Matson and Wagner English professor J.J. Boies.\n\nAccording to Weill’s resume, published by Louisiana Public Broadcasting, “Son of the Last Mule Dealer” (written in 1969) was produced Off-Broadway, and by the Actors Studio. A May 1975 New York Times brief said that “Mule Dealer” would be produced the next spring (that is, in 1976) by Phil Osterman, but no further information about that production "
