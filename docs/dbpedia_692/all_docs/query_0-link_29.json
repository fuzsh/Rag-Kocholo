It begins with the 1930s, the decade when Eugene O’Neill was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature and American theatre came of age. This is followed by the decade of the country’s most acclaimed theatre, when O’Neill, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller were writing their most distinguished work, and a theatrical idiom known as ‘the American style’ was seen in theatres throughout the world. Its place in the world repertoire established, American playwriting has taken many turns since 1950. The aim of this series is to focus attention on individual playwrights or collaborative teams who together reflect the variety and range of American drama during the eighty-year period it covers. In each volume, contributing experts offer detailed critical essays on four playwrights or collaborators and the significant work they produced during the decade. The essays on playwrights are presented in a rich interpretive context, which provides a contemporary perspective on both the theatre and American life and culture during the decade. The careers of the playwrights before and after the decade are summarized as well, and a section of documents, including interviews, manuscripts, reviews, brief essays and other items, sheds further light on the playwrights and their plays. The process of choosing such a limited number of playwrights to represent the American theatre of this period has been a difficult but revealing one. In selecting them, the series editors and volume authors have been guided by several principles: highlighting the most significant playwrights, in terms both historical and aesthetic, who contributed at least two interesting and important plays during\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 13\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nxiv\n\nGeneral Preface\n\nthe decade; providing a wide-ranging view of the decade’s theatre, including both Broadway and alternative venues; examining many historical trends in playwriting and theatrical production during the decade; and reflecting the theatre’s diversity in gender and ethnicity, both across the decade and across the period as a whole. In some decades, the choices are obvious. It is hard to argue with O’Neill, Williams, Miller and Wilder in the 1940s. Other decades required a good deal of thought and discussion. Readers will inevitably regret that favourite playwrights are left out. We can only respond that we regret it too, but we believe that the playwrights who are included reflect a representative sample of the best and most interesting American playwriting during the period. While each of the books has the same fundamental elements – an overview of life and culture during the decade, an overview of the decade’s theatre and drama, the four essays on the playwrights, a section of documents, an Afterword bringing the playwrights’ careers up to date, and a Bibliography of works both on the individual playwrights and on the decade in general – there are differences among the books depending on each individual volume author’s decisions about how to represent and treat the decade. The various formats chosen by the volume authors for the overview essays, the wide variety of playwrights, from the canonical to the contemporary avant-garde, and the varied perspectives of the contributors’ essays make for very different individual volumes. Each of the volumes stands on its own as a history of theatre in the decade and a critical study of the four individual playwrights or collaborative teams included. Taken together, however, the eight volumes offer a broadly representative critical and historical treatment of 80 years of American theatre and drama that is both accessible to a student first encountering the subject and informative and provocative for a seasoned expert.

The country lived through the devastating terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001; major corporate bankruptcies; the collapse of the car industry; the deep economic recession; mass shootings; political and sex scandals. The unemployment rate rose above 10 per cent for the first time since 1983. Surveillance culture grew and intelligence gathering proliferated. Climate change led to environmental catastrophes, such as Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath. While the fear of a massive Y2K computer meltdown did not materialize on midnight of 1 January 2000, other fears soon entered the lives of many Americans: the fear of snipers near Washington, DC, and anthrax attacks, the fear of global terrorism, the fear of losing one’s home, the fear of losing a job, the fear of losing a loved one to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ‘The noughties’, as the British sometimes refer to the decade, was a period of great calamities and inventions. Indeed, this decade of major economic and political upheavals also featured many\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 1\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n2\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\ngroundbreaking technological discoveries, including the explosion of Internet-based culture. It was also a decade of great paradoxes: the period of conservative politics in the country coincided with a number of progressive changes toward social equality; globalism and the growth in social networking produced a sense of isolation – both national and personal – and anxiety over the loss of identity and originality. Was it ‘the lost decade’ of massive political and environmental disasters? The ‘digital decade’ of Facebook, Twitter and video games? The decade of the ‘look-at-me generation’, of reality TV and celebrity culture? This chapter explores the decade from these various perspectives and discusses key events and developments in the 2000s which include MM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nWar on a global scale The Great Recession Changing perspectives on gender and sexual identity Racial politics and religious intolerance Environmental concerns The rise of neoconservatism and the Tea Party Evolving definitions of ‘family’ The emergence of digital and social media\n\nSociety War on Terror It was, we were soon told, ‘the day that changed everything’, the 21st century’s defining moment, the watershed by which we would forever divide world history: before, and after, 9/11. Jon Henley, Guardian, 9 September 2011 On 11 September 2001, nineteen Islamic fundamentalists hijacked four US airliners. Two planes were crashed into the World Trade Center in New York City, collapsing the Twin Towers; one was crashed into the Pentagon, seriously damaging the building; and one that was targeted at the White House or the US Capitol instead crashed in a cornfield in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after passengers\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 2\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n3\n\ntried to stop the hijackers. The al-Qaeda organization, led by Osama bin Laden, was responsible. Nearly 3,000 people perished as a result of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The long-term effects included significant physical and mental health issues. In June 2007, New York City commissioned the World Trade Center Medical Group to analyse the short-term health effects of 9/11 and project the long-term care needs of people exposed at ground zero. The report, issued in 2009, found that 15,688 people that year received publicly funded treatment for World Trade Center-related health conditions. Furthermore, over 40,000 first responders and workers were screened or monitored for disease. In response to the 9/11 attacks, the US launched wars in Afghanistan and Iraq in 2001 and 2003, respectively, with the support of an international coalition. These would become the longest military conflicts in US history. In Iraq, US military fatalities exceeded 4,300 up to 2009. In Afghanistan, US combat deaths numbered 946 up to 2009. The immediate and long-lasting effects of the wars on the US military personnel deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq included post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), major limb amputations and self-inflicted wounds. In 2003, there were 977 cases of the PTSD diagnosis reported among the deployed personnel; by 2009, the number rose to 13,863. TBI cases reached 28,877 by 2009.1 As the country engaged in the War on Terror, various national security policies emerged, authorizing domestic surveillance as well as detention and interrogation programmes. The establishment of the Department of Homeland Security aimed to unify national security efforts. The National Security Agency (NSA) implemented the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) to intercept al-Qaeda communications, although the programme was later implicated in engaging in widespread domestic surveillance. Blackwater Security Consulting, a private security company, was contracted by the Federal government to conduct risky and at times controversial military operations in the wake of 9/11. During the 16 September 2007 Blackwater operation in Iraq, seventeen Iraqis were killed and twenty-four wounded when Blackwater operators opened fire in a traffic circle in central Baghdad.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 3\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n4\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nBOX 1.1: WAR ON TERROR The War on Terror, a phrase first used by President Bush on 20 September 2001, is an ideological concept that emerged after the 11 September attacks to fight terrorism. It also refers to the series of international military and diplomatic campaigns aimed at putting an end to international terrorism, largely associated with radical Islamist groups such as al-Qaeda, Hezbollah and Hamas. The War on Terror campaigns were launched by the US, with support from NATO and other allies, in the aftermath of the 11 September terrorist attacks. In addition to the Bush administration-led wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the War on Terror also involved covert military operations and new security legislation, as well as efforts to block the financing of terrorist organizations. There was widespread criticism of ‘War on Terror’ as an approach to combating global terrorism and strengthening national security. Critics argued that, instead, this concept promoted an ideology of fear and mistrust, both domestically and internationally.\n\nEconomy The decade’s economy in the US was plagued by a series of crises leading to a major economic decline, also referred to as the Great Recession. The decade began with the dot-com bubble bursting and ended with the meltdown of the financial system caused by the crisis in subprime mortgages. The development of the global economy prompted the outsourcing of US service and technology, which precipitated what Thomas Friedman called the ‘flattening’ of the world.2 The rise of China and India as world financial powers presented a challenge to the US economy, as the global balance of power began to shift toward the East.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 4\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n5\n\nDot-com bubble burst The period of the dot-com bubble (also referred to as the Internet bubble or information technology bubble), which began roughly in 1997, achieved its climax on 10 March 2000, when the NASDAQ stock exchange soared to over 5,100.00 in intraday trading. The bubble was created by a combination of rising stock prices, market confidence in future profitability of dot-com companies and easily obtainable venture capital. In April 2000, inflation reports triggered the collapse of the bubble. As a result, a large number of information technology companies ran out of capital and filed for bankruptcy. Many companies were subsequently liquidated or acquired. In March 2000, the market value of NASDAQ companies peaked at $6.7 trillion; in October 2002, it reached its bottom at $1.6 trillion.3\n\nCorporate and investment frauds The decade was marked by a significant rise in fraud involving major corporate organizations and accounting firms. These scandals stemmed from improper accounting practices: inflated revenues, overstated sales, understated earnings, misused or misdirected funds. 2001: Enron, a top energy company, and Arthur Andersen, one of the top five public accounting firms, were involved in corporate fraud that resulted in the bankruptcy of Enron and dissolution of Arthur Andersen. Shareholders lost more than $60 billion. 2002: WorldCom, a major telecommunications company, was caught in fraudulent accounting operations to maintain the price of its stock. As a result, the company filed for bankruptcy. According to investigators, the company’s total assets had been inflated by about $11 billion. 2002: Tyco, a manufacturer of electronic components and health care and safety equipment, also became engulfed in an accounting scandal when its CEO, Dennis Kozlowski, along with several other top executives, was exposed for selling shares of unauthorized stock for $450 million and smuggling these funds out of the country disguised as executives’ bonuses and benefits.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 5\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n6\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\n2008: Bernard Madoff, owner of an investment advisory firm and former chairman of NASDAQ, admitted to running a huge Ponzi scheme, as a result of which his investors had been defrauded of $18 billion. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was one of the largest investment frauds in Wall Street history.\n\nSubprime housing collapse and financial crisis In the first half of the decade, the housing market was thriving, housing values kept inflating and the phenomenon known as subprime lending began to emerge. Subprime and alternative mortgages with very low or no down payments and very low initial rates became available for people without steady jobs or with tainted credit histories who would not have qualified for regular mortgages in the past. These mortgages were then packaged into mortgage-backed securities and sold to investors. As the interest rates rose, the mortgage payments became increasingly higher, and the inflated housing prices went down. These people were unable to make their mortgage payments and were eventually crushed by debt. As a result, home foreclosures rose and the value of the mortgage-backed securities fell. As of September 2008, 25 million subprime and other mortgages were outstanding, with an unpaid principal of over $4.5 trillion. This led to the collapse of major investment banks, whose portfolios of loans were worth nothing. Some of these institutions had also been involved in fraudulent accounting practices such as deceitful transactions (in the case of Lehman Brothers). In late 2008, the Bush administration stepped in to mitigate the financial crisis by creating the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) to bail out failing financial institutions.\n\nEconomic downfall of 2008 As banks had no lending ability because of their loss of assets, consumers and businesses could no longer borrow money, which affected their spending and productivity growth. New houses did not sell. The amount of foreclosures became unprecedented. Unemployment rose and consumer spending went down. By the time the Obama administration reached the White House in January of 2009, the economy was in a deep recession. The US\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 6\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n7\n\nnational debt more than doubled (from $5,674,178,209,886.86 in 2000 to $11,909,829,003,511.75 in 2009) due in part to governmental efforts to mitigate the financial crisis. At the end of 2009, the US economy began to show some signs of recovery. A Pew Charitable Trusts report provides some relevant detail.4\n\nBOX 1.2: PEW CHARITABLE TRUSTS REPORT Income: US households lost on average $5,800 in income from September 2008 through to 2009. Government spending: Federal spending, due to government interventions to alleviate the financial crisis (Troubled Assets Relief Program), amounted to $2,050 for each household. Home values: The US lost $3.4 trillion in real estate wealth between July 2008 and March 2009, according to the Federal Reserve – $30,300 per household. The subprime mortgage crisis resulted in 500,000 more foreclosures than had been expected. Stock values: The US lost $7.4 trillion in stock wealth from July 2008 to March 2009, according to the Federal Reserve – roughly $66,200 per household. Jobs: 5.5 million more American jobs were lost during the financial crisis because of slower economic growth than had been predicted.\n\nThe economic crisis had major global repercussions. The US economy experienced significant decline in the growth of both exports and imports, which led to slowing production and employment cuts in the rest of the world.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 7\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n8\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nBOX 1.3: DEMOGRAPHICS In December 2009, the US population was 308.2 million. NonHispanic whites made up about two-thirds of the population.\n\nEducation The unsatisfactory quality of American elementary and secondary education continued to be a hot topic in political debates. To effect major changes in public education, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act into law in 2002. This reform focused on four principles: stronger accountability for results, increased flexibility and local control, expanded options for parents, and teaching methods that had been proven to work. In an effort to improve elementary and secondary education, the Common Core State Standard Initiative was announced on 1 June 2009 to provide consistent and clear expectations of what students must learn. Secondary education graduation rates increased. In 2009–10, 3,128,022 public school students nationwide received a high school diploma; this resulted in an Averaged Freshman Graduation Rate of 78.2 per cent.5 In post-secondary education, between 2000 and 2008 the proportion of adults aged twenty-four and older with a bachelor’s degree or higher increased from 24 per cent to 28 per cent. The proportion of adults with an associate degree rose from 6 per cent to 8 per cent, while the number of adults completing college education without receiving a degree remained 21 per cent. Although educational achievement continued to increase among all racial and ethnic groups, there were still considerable gaps. In 2008, 31 per cent of non-Hispanic whites and 50 per cent of AsianAmericans had completed college or graduate education, compared to only 13 per cent of Hispanics and 18 per cent of blacks.6 Between 1999 and 2009, published tuition for four-year colleges increased by 39.8 per cent from the previous year; for two-year colleges, tuition increased by 3.1 per cent.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 8\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n9\n\nCrime In 2002, the US incarceration rate reached the highest level in the world. The total number of prisoners continued to increase, from 6,437,400 in 2000 to 7,225,800 in 2009. While rates of violent crime declined (the homicide rate declined by nearly half, from 9.3 homicides per 100,000 residents in 1992 to 4.7 in 2011), crime involving federal offences and firearms slightly increased. In 2009, the number of people arrested on suspicion of federal offences reached 183,000, a significant rise from 140,000 in 2005. Firearm violence increased from 7.3 per cent of all violence in 2000 to 7.4 per cent in 2009; firearm homicides also increased from 1.7 per cent in 2000 to 2.7 per cent in 2009.7 Drug cases remained the most prevalent in terms of adjudication and sentencing. In 2009, five judicial districts along the US–Mexico border had more than 56 per cent of all federal arrests.\n\nBOX 1.4: TYPES OF CRIME New types of crime involved cybercrime and online bullying. Examples of cybercrime included hacking, theft of information in electronic form, email bombing, virus/worm attacks and Trojan attacks. The decade also experienced an increase in corporate fraud and a spike in mass shootings. The deadliest mass shooting occurred in April 2007, when a student at Virginia Tech killed thirty-two people and wounded fifteen others before shooting himself.\n\nIdentity politics While the gender inequality gap continued to decrease, issues such as lower wages for women, a small percentage of women in leadership positions and a declining number of women in the labour force persisted. In 2010, women in the US on average received 81 per cent of the salary of their male counterparts, compared to about 62 per cent in 1979. In 2009, only 24 per cent of chief executive officers (CEOs) in the US were women, and their\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 9\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n10\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nsalaries were 74.5 per cent of what male CEOs earned.8 While women’s participation in US labour during the previous decades had increased, between 2000 and 2010 it dropped from 60 per cent of representation to 46.7 per cent.9 LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) rights evolved in varying degrees by state. Starting in 2000, some states began to recognize civil unions between same-sex couples. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. By 2009, five states had passed same-sex marriage legislation. Many states outlawed discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Hate crimes also became punishable by federal law under the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009.\n\nBOX 1.5: PROPOSITION 8 Proposition 8, or Prop 8, was a California ballot proposition and a state constitutional amendment that defined marriage as a relationship between a man and a woman. Created by opponents of same-sex marriage, it was passed in 2008 during state elections, overturning previous legalization of same-sex marriages by the state. A federal court then ruled Proposition 8 unconstitutional in 2010.\n\nThe decade experienced remarkable achievements in race relations ranging from culture to politics. Colin Powell became the first African-American to serve as Secretary of State (2001); Halle Berry and Denzel Washington won the Academy Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor in the same year (2002); Condoleezza Rice became the first African-American woman to serve as Secretary of State (2005); Barack Obama became the first African-American to win the presidency (2008); Sonia Sotomayor became the first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice (2009). Despite these significant strides, racial and ethnic inequalities remained obdurate, especially in employment and income distribution, criminalization and immigration policies, and life expectancy.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 10\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n11\n\nTable 1.1 Unemployment rates by race/ethnicity in 2009 Asian-Americans\n\nWhites\n\nHispanics\n\nBlacks\n\n7.5%\n\n8.7%\n\n12.4%\n\n15.3%\n\nThe recession of 2008 hit African-American and Latina/o communities particularly hard. The 4-percentage-point gap between unemployment rates for whites and blacks in 2000 grew to nearly 7 percentage points by 2009. The unemployment gap between whites and Latina/os increased significantly as well.10 In the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, racial profiling and religious intolerance surged. A New York Times article reported in 2006 that ‘in the aftermath of Sept. 11, Arab Americans [had] a greater fear of racial profiling and immigration enforcement than of falling victim to hate crimes’.11\n\nEnvironment The alarming environmental changes raised concerns about the world’s irresponsible consumption of natural resources, prompting research groups, business corporations and politicians to think of new ways to make our planet a greener, cleaner and ecologically safer place. The topic of climate change and its negative effects received much attention both domestically and globally, especially after the melting of the Antarctic ice sheet and the recession of Arctic glaciers that occurred significantly faster than experts had predicted. Melting ice, drought, early springs and disappearing polar bears, among other species, were some of the disconcerting effects of the decade’s climate change. Climate change was also linked to devastating natural disasters such as the Southeast Asian tsunami in 2004 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Developing renewable energy sources and clean energy technologies became one of the principal goals of major environmental research and investment programmes. According to a 2009 United Nations Environment Program report, in 2008, $155 billion was invested globally in renewable energy, including hydropower and biofuels, a fourfold increase since 2004. While the US continued to lag in its effort to embrace green initiatives, politicians and\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 11\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n12\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nbusinesses paid more attention to environmental protection. During all three presidential elections in the period, environmental concerns became a significant element in presidential debates. To protect the country’s key natural resources, the Obama administration launched America’s Great Outdoors Initiative in 2010. Other global environmental concerns included overpopulation, the water crisis, oil and coal ash spills, nuclear waste disposal, endangered species, pandemics and superbugs, all rooted in environmental causes.\n\nPolitics A Republican held the White House for most of the decade. George W. Bush became the 43rd US president after the Supreme Court ruling in his 2000 election dispute with Democrat Al Gore and won re-election in 2004. Barack Obama, a Democratic senator from Illinois, won the 2008 election and became the first AfricanAmerican president in US history. National security drove domestic and foreign policies after the 9/11 attacks. As a result of the Homeland Security Act in 2002, the Bush administration formed the US Department of Homeland Security as ‘a concerted national effort to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, reduce America’s vulnerability to terrorism, and minimize the damage and recover from attacks that do occur’.12 The US foreign policy after the 9/11 attacks that relied on a strategy of ‘preemptive strikes’ to protect the security of the country is often referred to as ‘the Bush Doctrine’.13\n\nBOX 1.6: NEOCONSERVATISM Neoconservatives (at times referred to as neocons) rose to prominence during the Bush presidency and played a crucial role in promoting and planning the invasion of Iraq. Prominent neoconservatives in the administration included Vice President Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Paul Bremer. Neoconservatism advocates promotion of American interests in international affairs and adopts strategies such as the use of military force.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 12\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n13\n\nThe 2001 invasion of Afghanistan was followed by the 2003 Operation Iraqi Freedom. Its main mission, according to Bush, was ‘to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein’s support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people’.14 The wars in Afghanistan and Iraq became increasingly unpopular, especially after the dissemination of official findings that Iraq had no chemical or biological weapons of mass destruction before the invasion. The public discontent with the wars also stemmed from the spikes in violence in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as the rising numbers of US military casualties. In the meantime, the US grappled with the challenges of globalization, such as terrorism, growing environmental concerns and financial and economic crises. During the Bush administration, economic policies included the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008 to boost the economy and prevent the recession, and the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, commonly referred to as a bailout of the US financial system.15 In 2009, President Obama formed the Presidential Task Force on the Auto Industry to manage the financial bailout of car manufacturers Chrysler and General Motors. Following task force recommendations, which included fuel-efficient cars, the US government loaned $25 billion to the companies.\n\nBOX 1.7: THE TEA PARTY The Tea Party, which emerged as a grassroots political movement, consists of libertarian, populist and conservative activists. It sprang up in full force in early 2009 with multiple protests, including one at the US Capitol and National Mall, demanding reduction of government spending and taxes. (The Tea Party has also been called an ‘AstroTurf’ movement – a fake grassroots movement that actually was started and financed by elite groups.)\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 13\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n14\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nTimeline of major political events16 2000 George W. Bush won the US presidency after the Supreme Court ruling despite winning fewer popular votes than Al Gore. Hillary Rodham Clinton won a United States Senate seat from New York, becoming the first First Lady to win public office. 2001 11 September: The terror attacks on the US orchestrated by Islamic fundamentalists caused nearly 3,000 deaths. 18 September: The first anthrax attacks by mail against targets among journalists and government officials were reported. 7 October: In response to the 11 September attacks, the US military, and its United Kingdom ally, began the first phase in the War on Terror by launching an offensive against the Taliban and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. This war became the longest military conflict in US history. 26 October: Bush signed into law the USA PATRIOT Act. Its title stands for ‘Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism’. 2002 21 May: The State Department declared that seven nations sponsored terrorism: Iran, Iraq, Cuba, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and Syria. 2003 March: The US invaded Iraq, coordinating military operations with British, Australian, Polish and Danish ground troops. April: The US-led coalition seized control of Baghdad, driving Iraqi President Saddam Hussein from power. He was later arrested and executed on 30 December 2006. June to November: Amnesty International and the Associated Press reported that the US military and the CIA abused detainees at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. In 2004, the American Civil Liberties Union released documents obtained under the Freedom of Information\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 14\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n15\n\nAct that indicated that the US government authorized the use of torture (‘enhanced interrogation techniques’) against prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and in Afghanistan and Iraq. 2004 January: The CIA’s top weapons adviser in Iraq, David Kay, admitted that the country possessed no active weapons of mass destruction or related production facilities before the war – refuting the US justification of the invasion. In September, Kay’s successor as the CIA’s chief weapons inspector, Charles Duelfer, testified before Congress that Hussein had no chemical or biological weapons and no capacity to make nuclear weapons. 2 November: Bush won re-election over Democratic Senator John Kerry from Massachusetts. 2005 29 August: Hurricane Katrina’s storm surge overwhelmed levees in greater New Orleans, flooding 80 per cent of the city: the confirmed death toll was 1,836 and the total damage was estimated at $108 billion. Katrina, arguably the greatest natural disaster in US history, prompted heated public debates about the local, state and federal governments’ lack of preparation and mismanagement of relief efforts. 2006 In the mid-term elections, the Democratic Party won control of both the US House of Representatives and the Senate. This overwhelming victory was attributed to growing public discontent over the Bush administration’s Iraq policy. 2007 January: California Representative Nancy Pelosi became the first woman Speaker of the US House of Representatives. January: Bush announced a ‘surge’ of additional troops into Iraq to stop attacks against coalition forces and civilians. June: A terror plot to blow up jet fuel supply tanks and pipelines at JFK International Airport in New York was foiled.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 15\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n16\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\n2008 October: Bush signed into law the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act – a bailout of the US financial system. The $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program to purchase failing bank assets was the government’s response to the subprime mortgage crisis. November: Barack Obama overwhelmingly won the presidential election over John McCain. Obama became the 44th US president in January 2009. 2009 February: Obama signed into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, an economic stimulus package. April: Some 750 Tea Party protests emerged across the nation in response to government spending, such as the bailout of the banking and car industries that had begun during the Bush administration and expanded under Obama. October: Joblessness climbed above 10 per cent, signalling that the recession had deepened. December: Obama announced a ‘surge’ of 30,000 additional troops in Afghanistan to curb increased Taliban attacks.\n\nTerrorist attacks around the world 2001, 2002, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008,\n\n11 September: 9/11 terrorist attacks, US (2,996 killed) October: Bali bombings, Indonesia (202 killed) October: Moscow theatre hostage crisis, Russia (130 killed) November: Istanbul bombings, Turkey (57 killed) March: Madrid train bombings, Spain (191 killed) September: Beslan school hostage crisis, Russia (334 killed) July: London bombings, UK (56 killed) August: Yazidi communities bombings, Iraq (796 killed) November: Mumbai attacks, India (164 killed)\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 16\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n17\n\nEveryday life Family life The definition of family continued to expand, especially with the legalization of civil unions and same-sex marriages. Despite legal hurdles concerning adoption for same-sex partners, the percentage of gays and lesbians with adopted children increased. While only about 8 per cent of same-sex couples had an adopted child in 2000, this number rose to about 19 per cent in 2009. Both marriage and divorce rates continued to decline. Whereas in 2000, the marriage rate was 8.2 per 1,000 individuals, in 2009 it dropped to 6.8. In 2000, the divorce rate was 4 per 1,000 people; in 2009 it decreased to 3.5.17 Pregnancy rates declined, reaching their lowest level in twelve years in 2009: 102.1 per 1,000 women aged fifteen to forty-four. Pregnancy rates for women younger than age thirty dropped; rates for women thirty and older increased. Rates for teenage pregnancy dropped, reaching a historically low level in 2009. Also, the abortion rate in 2009 was at its lowest level since 1976. Birth rates slightly rose in the middle of the decade but dropped again by 2009: from 2008 to 2009, the number of births declined by 3 per cent.18 Life expectancy continued to increase gradually. In 2009, life expectancy was 80.9 years for white women, 77.6 years for black women, 76.4 years for white men and 71.1 years for black men.19\n\nWhat things cost From 2000 to 2009, the Consumer Price Index (the government’s inflation measure) as a whole rose by 24.5 per cent.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 17\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n18\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nTable 1.2 Consumer Price Index Product\n\n1999 price\n\n2009 price\n\nChange\n\nSlurpee, largest, 7-11\n\n$0.99\n\n$2.12\n\n114.14%\n\nGallon of petrol\n\n$1.30\n\n$2.56\n\n96.92%\n\nDisneyland (one-day adult ticket)\n\n$41.00\n\n$72.00\n\n75.61%\n\nAverage expanded basic cable (per month)\n\n$31.22\n\n$49.65\n\n59.03%\n\nBabysitting (per hour)\n\n$7–$10\n\n$10–$15\n\n50.00%\n\nBudweiser (six-pack of cans)\n\n$4.01\n\n$5.99\n\n49.38%\n\nCinema ticket\n\n$5.06\n\n$7.18\n\n41.90%\n\nAspirin (Bayer, 100-count)\n\n$3.47\n\n$4.81\n\n38.62%\n\nSugar, 5 lb.\n\n$2.13\n\n$2.90\n\n36.15%\n\nCheerios, one box\n\n$3.89\n\n$5.15\n\n32.39%\n\nStamp, US, first class\n\n$0.33\n\n$0.44\n\n33.33%\n\nCigarettes (Marlboro, per pack, California)\n\n$4.65\n\n$5.95\n\n27.96%\n\n$40.24\n\n$49.57\n\n23.19%\n\nMcDonald’s Big Mac\n\n$2.50\n\n$2.99\n\n19.60%\n\nCoca-Cola, 1 litre\n\n$1.14\n\n$1.34\n\n17.54%\n\n$18,900.00\n\n$20,398.00\n\n7.93%\n\nGallon of milk\n\n$2.88\n\n$3.05\n\n5.90%\n\nCoffee (Maxwell House, 34.5 oz.)\n\n$9.99\n\n$9.49\n\n–5.01%\n\n$329.00\n\n$301.00\n\n–8.51%\n\nMobile phone bill (average)\n\nWedding, average cost\n\nAverage domestic airfare Credit card average APR\n\n15.07%\n\n13.71%\n\nBatteries (4 AA, Energizer)\n\n$3.99\n\n$3.49\n\n–12.53%\n\n$1,499.00\n\n$999.00\n\n–33.36%\n\niMac desktop computer\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 18\n\n–9.02%\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n19\n\nOnline shopping grew rapidly, as products were being advertised via video ads on websites, contextual ads on search engines and text messages to mobile phones.20\n\nThe gadgets we purchased iPhone, Amazon Kindle, iPod, Garmin GPS, Wii Remote, TiVo DVR, Slingbox, Blackberry, XBox, Sony PlayStation 3/Blu-Ray, Sonos Multi-room Music System, Flip Video Ultra, Jabra Bluetooth earpiece, USB flash drive.\n\nHow much we spent According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics,21 in 2008 average annual expenditures per consumer unit (i.e. family) were as follows: Average annual expenditures $50,486 Food at home $3,744 Food away from home $2,698 Housing $17,109 Petrol and motor oil $2,715 Healthcare $1,976 Apparel and services $1,801 Personal care products and services $616 Education $1,046 Entertainment $2,835 Alcoholic beverages $444 Tobacco products $317\n\nHousing In 2008, homeownership was at 66.6 per cent, a decline from 67.2 per cent in 2007.

As of October 2009, nearly 16 million people in the United States were unemployed.\n\nAverage earnings In 2000, median household income was $53,164. By 2004, it fell to $51,174, then recovered to an extent by 2007 before it fell to an even lower level by 2010: $49,445.

For working-age adults, poverty increased by 1 per cent from 2007 to 2008.23\n\nWords that entered the vocabulary and were in common usage American Dialect Society’s Words of the Year: 2000: chad (from the 2000 US presidential election controversy, in reference to fragments hanging from paper ballots during the manual recount of votes in Florida) 2001: 9/11 2002: weapons of mass destruction (or WMD, in the Iraq War) 2003: metrosexual (an urban man concerned about his grooming and fashion) 2004: red state, blue state, purple state (from US elections) 2005: truthiness (coined by television comedian Stephen Colbert) 2006: plutoed (demoted or devalued, as was the former planet Pluto) 2007: subprime (a risky loan to someone with poor credit) 2008: bailout (a government rescue of a collapsing corporation) 2009: tweet (a short post sent via Twitter) 2010: app (application software) The word of the decade was google (used as a verb). Other popular words included Y2K, dot-com, blog, texting, sustainable, embedded. New phrases included climate change, financial tsunami, ground zero, war on terror, carbon footprint, cloud computing.\n\nTrends in smoking and drug abuse Smoking declined as a result of stricter regulations on tobacco advertising and restrictions in public places. Anti-smoking\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 21\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n22\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\ntobacco policies led to the significant price increase for tobacco products, which also contributed to the decline in smoking. The decade experienced unprecedented deaths from drug overdoses. Since 1980, overdose death rates increased five times. By 2009, drug overdose deaths had outnumbered deaths resulting from motor vehicle crashes. Prescription drugs, especially opioid analgesics, were increasingly involved in overdose deaths. During this period, opioid-related overdose deaths exceeded overdose deaths involving all illicit drugs such as heroin and cocaine. Rates of emergency room visits because of pharmaceutical misuse or abuse escalated dramatically.24\n\nCulture Corporate entertainment and technology continued to affect the development of culture. With a huge jump in broadband Internet (there were 77.4 million broadband subscribers in the US in December 2008) and an increased use of wireless networks, blogs, portals, intranets and wikis became common electronic dissemination methods for professionals, amateurs and businesses. Peer-to-peer technology such as Skype and file-sharing applications such as KaZaA and Limewire made cultural exchanges, communication and peer evaluation more effective. While the debate over the ethics of file-sharing continued, legal music download services such as iTunes and streaming services such as Spotify opened up new markets. Netflix began to provide online digital streaming in 2007 while it continued to rent DVDs to its subscribers through an online service: by 2009, its DVD collection had grown to include 1,000,000 titles and its subscriber base had exceeded 10 million users. Hulu (2007) and Amazon Instant Video (2008, initially called Amazon Video on Demand) also entered the market, providing instant streaming of selected films and TV shows. With the help of the latest technology, stand-up comedy achieved new popularity, reaching a wider audience across ages, races, genders and economic status. Comedians celebrated cultural idiosyncrasies and embraced technological innovations, employing various media. Performers such as Sarah Silverman, John\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 22\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n23\n\nLeguizamo and Dave Chapelle won public acclaim by confronting and subverting gender stereotypes and ethnic/racial assumptions. Dane Cook became one of the first comedians to maximize the potential of Internet marketing (such as MySpace), reaching a large young audience. Dan Whitney offered blue-collar comedy. Other noteworthy comedians included Chris Rock and Aziz Ansari.\n\nBOX 1.8: VIDEO GAMES The video game industry’s profits surpassed the profits of the film industry in 2004. With a constant advancement of video game consoles – PlayStation 2 (2000), Xbox 360 (2005) and PlayStation 3 (2006) – the quality of 3D graphics significantly improved. As video gaming increasingly became one of the cultural markers of the 2000s, criticism emerged about the games’ violent content (as in Grand Theft Auto and Super Columbine Massacre RPG) and addictive effect.\n\nFilm The decade’s top-grossing movies included Avatar (2009), The Dark Knight (2008), Shrek 2 (2004) and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003). Major trends encompassed the proliferation of science fiction and fantasy, the impact of technology on popular culture and the celebration of a superhero. The decade produced a considerable number of film sequels such as Pirates of the Caribbean and Shrek, as well as movies based on novels such as Harry Potter and The Da Vinci Code, demonstrating a continued trend toward the mass commercialization of the film industry. Notable highlights of the Academy Awards included: 2001: The ‘Best Animated Feature Film’ category was added; Shrek won the award. The decade experienced a surge of African-American winners in the categories of Best Actor/Actress and Best Supporting Actor/ Actress. Between 2000 and 2009, seven awards were presented\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 23\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n24\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nto African-Americans: Denzel Washington (Best Actor, Training Day, 2001), Halle Berry (Best Actress, Monster’s Ball, 2001), Jamie Foxx (Best Actor, Ray, 2004), Morgan Freeman (Best Supporting Actor, Million Dollar Baby, 2004), Forest Whitaker (Best Actor, The Last King of Scotland, 2006), Jennifer Hudson (Best Supporting Actress, Dreamgirls, 2006) and Mo’Nique (Best Supporting Actress, Precious, 2009). 2005: Ang Lee received the Best Director Oscar for Brokeback Mountain, a ‘gay cowboy movie’ about a sexual/romantic relationship between two men.\n\nBOX 1.9: FILM INDUSTRY RESPONSE TO 9/11 The film industry’s response to 9/11 included Spike Lee’s 25th Hour (2002), the television movie DC 9/11: Time of Crisis (2003), Oliver Stone’s World Trade Center (2006) and Paul Greengrass’s United 93 (2006). Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 (2004), a biting commentary on Bush administration politics in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, became the biggestgrossing documentary of all time. It won major film awards including the Palme d’Or at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival. Other documentaries that raised social consciousness in the decade included Moore’s Bowling for Columbine (2002), exploring the roots of gun violence in the US, and Al Gore and Davis Guggenheim’s An Inconvenient Truth (2006), pointing to the dangers of global warming.\n\n2009: The Hurt Locker received the Best Picture Oscar, and its director, Kathryn Bigelow, became the first woman to win Best Director. The film’s plot centres on the lives of American soldiers during the Iraq War. Other movies that won Best Picture from 2000 to 2009 were Gladiator (2000), A Beautiful Mind (2001), Chicago (2002), The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (2003), Million Dollar\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 24\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n25\n\nBaby (2004), Crash (2005), The Departed (2006), No Country for Old Men (2007) and Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The decade also featured increased representation of foreignborn actors and directors among the Oscar winners: Benicio del Toro (Best Supporting Actor, Traffic, 2000), Roman Polanski (Best Director, The Pianist, 2002) and Javier Bardem (Best Supporting Actor, No Country for Old Men, 2007). Notable films depicting foreign settings included Slumdog Millionaire, 2008 (Best Picture and Best Director – Danny Boyle), and The Pianist, 2002 (Best Actor – Adrienne Brody, and Best Director – Polanski).\n\nMusic The decade’s technological advances made a significant impact on music’s digital distribution, marketing and public access. Napster, a free online digital music-sharing website, operated from 1999 until 2001, closing because of copyright infringement (it later reopened as a paid membership website). With the downfall of Napster, the iPod (2001) and iTunes (2001) stepped in to appeal to the younger generation. Apple claimed that the iPod became the fastest-selling music player in history. Apple’s iTunes Music Store (2003) sold individual songs in digital format for less than a dollar and became the biggest music market and most convenient way for music distribution. With the launch of YouTube (2005), music sharing entered a new era: homemade music videos went viral, bringing overnight popularity to artists. Live concerts, however, continued to draw big crowds of music fans. Music began to cross cultures, with the influence of rap, hip-hop and pop around the world. The decade offered a variety of music genres; these genres included hip-hop (Eminem, Kanye West, Jay-Z), R&B (Alicia Keys, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Usher), Pop (Britney Spears; country style – Taylor Swift), electronic pop (Lady Gaga), pop (pop punk music – Blink 182; Emo music – Jimmy Eat World; garage rock – the Strokes, the White Stripes), jazz (Norah Jones) and others. The boy-band craze of the 1990s abated; Justin Timberlake (formerly of N’Sync) moved on to have a successful solo career as a singer and actor. The use of Auto-Tune technology (audio processor) and futuristic synthesizers changed the sound of pop music, popularized by the Black Eyed Peas with songs such as ‘I Gotta Feeling’. The\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 25\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n26\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\n‘mashup’ emerged as a musical form that juxtaposes several songs different in style. Children’s pop music had a strong presence, with movies, TV shows and artists such as the Cheetah Girls, High School Musical, Hannah Montana and the Jonas Brothers.\n\nBOX 1.10: THE GRAMMY AWARDS The Grammy Award recipients for Best New Artist were Christina Aguilera (2000), Shelby Lynne (2001), Alicia Keys (2002), Norah Jones (2003), the rock metal band Evanescence (2004), the pop rock band Maroon 5 (2005), John Legend (2006) and Carrie Underwood (2007). The 2008 and 2009 awards went to the British singers Amy Winehouse and Adele.\n\nNotable events in music include: 2001: A tribute concert for 9/11 aired on VH1 on 20 October, with performances by Paul McCartney, the Rolling Stones, Bon Jovi, the Who, Billy Joel and others. After Eminem’s album The Marshall Mathers LP drew backlash from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation, openly gay singer Elton John responded by performing with Eminem at the Grammy Awards in 2001. The message he sent was that he would ‘rather tear down walls between people than build them up’. 2002: American Idol – an American singing competition series based on the British series Pop Idol – became one of the most popular television shows. It is also noteworthy for its interactive feature: winners were selected by viewers voting through telephone, Internet and text messaging. Kelly Clarkson won the first season. 2003: ‘From the Big Apple to the Big Easy’ was a collaborative music event involving Madison Square Garden and Radio City Music Hall to raise funds for the Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Proceeds from the simultaneous benefit concerts reached $9 million;\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 26\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n27\n\nperformers included Elton Jones, Irma Thomas, Lenny Kravitz and Elvis Costello. 2009: Michael Jackson, the self-proclaimed ‘King of Pop’, died. His personal physician was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter for administering Jackson a massive dose of the anaesthetic propofol. After his death, Jackson became the bestselling albums artist of 2009.\n\nArt Technology permeated the decade’s art scene. The trends included multimedia installations created with new technology, virtual art tours of museums and galleries and the use of social media to spark conversations around the issues of contemporary art. Art critic Jerry Saltz, for instance, used Facebook as a platform to bolster critical debates. Museums’ efforts to become more accessible and target a new audience resulted in exhibitions displaying popular content: in 2000, the Guggenheim Museum in New York City held an exhibition of Giorgio Armani’s fashion designs; in 2002, the Brooklyn Museum organized a tribute to Star Wars.25 Artworks also explored the decade’s themes of self-conscious anxiety and isolation that emerged in response to globalization and the growing social interactivity. In addition to reflecting on issues of identity and self-reflections, contemporary art – often through site-specific installations – emphasized environmental concerns that persisted during the period. Furthermore, artists grappled with what it meant to be an artist during wartime. Dario Robleto’s ‘Caught in Man’s Amnesia’, for instance – ‘a collection of bullets made of melted and cast unused bullet casings from every American war’ – invited the viewer to contemplate ‘the notions of war, peace, memory, and salvation’.26 The art world reflected the decade’s economic bubble and its subsequent bursting: in 2006 and 2007, auctions sold artwork for outrageous prices; then in 2008, art sales sharply plummeted. During the economic bubble, the Neue Galerie in New York purchased a Klimt painting for $135 million (2006), and Damien Hirst’s ‘For the Love of God’, a human skull covered in platinum and encrusted in diamonds, sold for $100 million (2007).\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 27\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n28\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nNew and reconstructed museum spaces opened across the country. The reconfigured and enlarged Museum of Modern Art in New York City reopened in 2004. New York’s New Museum for Contemporary Art opened at a new location in the Bowery in 2007. Prominent collectors built their own museums: for example, the Rubell Family Collection in Miami (opened in 1996) and the Broad Contemporary Art Museum in Los Angeles (opened in 2008). In February 2003, the design competition to rebuild the World Trade Center was complete. Architect Daniel Libeskind won the award.\n\nBooks The decade’s bestselling novels were The Da Vinci Code (2003) by Dan Brown (about conspiracy in the Catholic Church), The Kite Runner (2003) by Khaled Hosseini (written by an Afghan writer and set in Afghanistan, it provides a global perspective to American readers), Twilight (2005) by Stephenie Meyer (the first in a series that won new popularity for the genre of vampire romance) and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (2007) by J. K. Rowling (the final book in the Harry Potter series).\n\nBOX 1.11: WRITERS’ RESPONSE TO 9/11 Writers began to tackle the subject of 9/11 by delving into the emotional impact of the terrorist attacks. Some of the books in this category included William Gibson’s Pattern of Recognition (2003), Jonathan Safran Foer’s Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (2005), Don DeLillo’s Falling Man (2007) and Joseph O’Neill’s Netherland (2008).\n\nAmong the Pulitzer Prize winners in the category of Fiction were The Quick and the Dead (2001) by Joy Williams, Blonde (2001) by Joyce Carol Oates, The Corrections (2002) by Jonathan\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 28\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n29\n\nFranzen, Evidence of Things Unseen (2004) by Marriane Wiggins, The March (2006) by E. L. Doctorow, After This (2007) by Alice McDermott, Tree of Smoke (2008) by Denis Johnson, All Souls (2009) by Christine Schutt and The Plague of Doves (2009) by Louise Erdrich. The decade experienced the trend of popularizing novels through other media such as film or musical theatre. Novels made into films included the Harry Potter series; the Twilight series; Where the Wild Things Are; The Chronicles of Narnia; The Da Vinci Code; Dr Seuss: How the Grinch Stole Christmas, The Cat in the Hat and Horton Hears a Who!; and The Lord of the Rings series. Remakes or adaptations of classics included Charlotte’s Web, A Christmas Carol and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Novels made into musicals included The Wild Party, Seussical the Musical, A Year with Frog and Toad, Wicked, The Color Purple, The Light in the Piazza and Little Women.\n\nSport Sports programmes and live events on television continued to draw a diverse viewership, although the audience that watched programmes that ranked in the top ten prime-time broadcasts was only at around 8 per cent between 2001 and 2008; in 2009, it jumped to 19.4 per cent.27 Trends in sport reflected the decade’s general concerns and developments. After 9/11, security significantly intensified at major sporting events, with more sombre moments dedicated to the military and patriotism. Increased globalization entered the sports arena, with the National Football League beginning to play games at Wembley Stadium in London, starting in 2007, and Major League Baseball playing two spring training games in China in 2008. The explosion of the Internet affected sport, as Fantasy Football websites made Fantasy Football one of the most important marketing tools for the NFL, while Twitter allowed sports commentators to debate online. Major League Baseball was put under the microscope when record-holders such as Barry Bonds and Mark McGwire were suspected of using performance-enhancing drugs. American football grew in popularity, for both the NFL and college teams.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 29\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n30\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nIn 2007, two African-American head coaches faced each other in the Super Bowl for the first time: Lovie Smith of the Chicago Bears and Tony Dungy of the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nBOX 1.12: 2004 SUPER BOWL ‘ WARDROBE MALFUNCTION’ In 2004, the Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake, turned controversial when a ‘wardrobe malfunction’ exposed Jackson’s breast (with a decorative nipple shield).\n\nCelebrity culture and fashion Because of the explosion of Internet culture, the lives of celebrities became increasingly more public. The public were obsessed with celebrities’ relationships, pregnancies, diets, nervous breakdowns and addictions. The celebrities whose tribulations attracted most public attention were Anna Nicole Smith, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan. Couples and love triangles also garnered media interest: Jennifer Lopez and Ben Affleck (‘Bennifer’); Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes; Cruise and ex-wife Nicole Kidman; Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie (‘Brangelina’); and Pitt and ex-wife Jennifer Aniston. The term ‘celebrity worship syndrome’ first appeared in 2003. Just as music was not dominated by any one genre, fashion also was eclectic: MM\n\nMM\n\nMM\n\nPopular designers included Alexander McQueen and Vera Wang. Popular fashion styles included ‘hobo chic’, gender bending, Ugg boots, faded and torn denim, and vintage-inspired clothing. Popular stores included Old Navy, H&M and Target.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 30\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n31\n\nBOX 1.13: QUEER EYE FOR THE STRAIGHT GUY Queer Eye for the Straight Guy, a reality TV makeover show, premiered in 2003. This represented the inclusion of openly gay personalities in popular culture and appropriated the stereotype that homosexual men have superior taste in both fashion and culture.\n\nMedia The proliferation of digital and social media outlets as well as online (on-demand) access to music, television shows and films characterized the decade. The rise of digital media resulted in the steady decline of printed books, magazines and newspapers. E-readers and online blogs continued to increase in readership and popularity. Online news outlets attracted aspiring journalists and writers who embraced digital platforms; as a result, digital journalism began to emerge. The Internet and other forms of digital media became major sources of information.\n\nTelevision and television journalism The way we watch television was transformed by DVR, online streaming, digital cable and video on-demand. DirectTV experienced significant growth, providing its viewers with increased access to global culture. TiVo, a digital video recorder (DVR), allowed the user to pause and rewind live TV. It also offered features such as ‘WishList’ searches or ‘Season Pass’ schedules, which could record every new episode of a television series. The advent of TiVo affected advertising: as viewers could skip through commercials, more companies invested in product placement, or embedded marketing, especially in reality TV. Reality TV became extremely popular. Among shows attracting large audiences were Survivor (receiving top ratings in 2001 and 2002) and American Idol (receiving top ratings in 2004 through\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 31\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n32\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nto 2009). Reality television categories included competition shows (Big Brother, Survivor), singing/dance/talent competition shows (Dancing with the Stars, American Idol), fashion-themed series (Project Runway, America’s Next Top Model), documentary or narrative-style shows (The Hills, The Real Housewives), game shows (Deal or No Deal, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire), cooking shows (Top Chef, Chopped) and makeover shows (The Swan, for instance, depicts women undergoing extensive plastic surgery). Emmy Awards were instituted to reflect the large popularity of reality television: these included Outstanding Reality Program (2001), Outstanding Reality-Competition Program (2003) and Outstanding Host for a Reality or Reality-Competition Program (2008). Television sitcoms and dramas that gained viewers’ popularity included Arrested Development, South Park (adult animation), The West Wing, The Sopranos, The Wire, Lost, The Office, Weeds, Mad Men, Dexter and Breaking Bad. The most popular television shows that provided commentary on current political events and affected public opinion were The Daily Show, a late-night comedy programme hosted by Jon Stewart; Saturday Night Live, a late-night live sketch comedy and variety show that started in the 1970s; and the Colbert Report, hosted by comedian Stephen Colbert. Other nightly news broadcasts included shows on the major broadcast networks ABC, CBS and NBC. According to the Pew Research Center findings, the difference in how the public received election news in 2000, 2004 and 2008 was considerable. In 2000, television news dominated and the Internet was ‘a relatively minor source for campaign news’, but in 2004, the Internet gained almost equal footing with news outlets such as ‘public television broadcasts, Sunday morning news programs and the weekly news magazines’. In 2008, the percentage of the population that received most of its campaign news from the Internet tripled from 2004 (from 10 per cent to 33 per cent).28\n\nRadio and newspapers Radio declined in popularity as more listeners used MP3 players and iPods to customize music while driving. To compete with digital media, many radio stations such as National Public Radio streamed their content over the Internet to allow online users to\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 32\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n33\n\ngain access to their programmes. New radio technologies included satellite radio and HD radio, providing a higher quality and wider reach broadcast programming than a standard radio broadcast. Newspapers suffered a major blow with the development of the Internet, especially as free sites such as Craigslist replaced much of the need for classified advertising. As circulation of printed newspapers declined, the number of online newspapers (some were free), newspaper blogs and Twitter accounts, online newspaper archives and online magazines grew exponentially.\n\nSocial media The social media explosion offered users new and effective ways to connect, interact, post comments, share ideas and multimedia content, stage ‘flash mobs’ and influence political events. Kaplan and Haenlein, in their article ‘Users of the World, Unite! The Challenges and Opportunities of Social Media’, identify the decade’s six different types of social media: collaborative projects, blogs, content communities, social networking sites, virtual game worlds and virtual social world. Social media technologies included Internet forums, wikis, blogs, podcasts, multimedia sharing, wallpostings, email and instant messaging, among others. A blending of technology and social interaction for the co-creation of value drove social media development.29\n\nBOX 1.14: SOCIAL NETWORKING Social networking accounted for 22 per cent of all time spent online in the US. Twitter processed more than one billion tweets in December 2009 and averaged almost 40 million tweets per day. Over 25 per cent of US Internet page views occurred at one of the top social networking sites in December 2009, up from 13.8 per cent a year before.30\n\nAs social media became more accessible, concerns grew about online bullying and the necessity of parental control. ‘Unfriend’ was the New Oxford American Dictionary word of 2009.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 33\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n34\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nTechnology and science Digital media Technological innovations during the first years of the century significantly transformed the ways in which we communicate, obtain information and present ourselves to the world. Inventions such as instant text messaging, Wikipedia, YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, among others, defined this decade as a digital age. The digital revolution both simplified and complicated our ability to process and analyse data. The instant availability of unlimited informational resources improved our daily activities, but also caused a great deal of confusion and frustration, as there was no longer a single voice of authority. Computers and gadgets began to rule our lives. Video games and social networking offered people the opportunity to create alternative realities and assume virtual identities.\n\nBOX 1.15: DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB The development of the World Wide Web marked the decade. Web 2.0 – a new phase in web technology – allowed users to interact with web content, collaborate with each other in a social media environment and generate new content. The user-generated movement became publicly acknowledged when in 2006 Time magazine named ‘You’ its Person of the Year. As Time magazine’s editor, Lev Grossman, explained, ‘It’s a story about community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It’s about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the millionchannel people’s network YouTube and the online metropolis MySpace.’31\n\nInformation technology enabled people to interact with the world with unprecedented efficiency and maintain their virtual\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 34\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n35\n\npresence through social media. Technological developments were also intricately connected to many political controversies, such as the post-9/11 culture of surveillance as well as the leaking of documents, photographs and videos over the Internet.\n\nTimeline of major technological developments 2000 GPS (Global Positioning System), the satellite-based system, originally developed by the Department of Defense, became available to civilian users. Toyota Motor Corporation introduced the Prius, an affordable hybrid car, to the US market. AT&T became the first US cellular company to offer instant text messaging for mobile phones. Sony released PlayStation 2, followed by Microsoft’s Xbox in 2001. These groundbreaking video game consoles sparked the development of the video gaming industry. Trek Technology and IBM began to market the first USB flash drives with a storage capacity of 8 MB, exceeding the capacity of floppy disks by more than five times. 2001 Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, Internet entrepreneurs and project developers, launched Wikipedia, a free-access, online, user-edited encyclopaedia. Despite debates over the accuracy of its content, Wikipedia remained the Internet’s most extensive and popular reference site. The launch of Wikipedia signified a new era of usergenerated content. Apple introduced the iPod, which instantly became the bestselling digital music player and a cultural icon, transforming the music industry forever. With the click of a mouse, consumers could buy and download music albums, rendering CD and record stores obsolete. Apple continued to update the model, expanding it to Shuffles, Nanos and finally the iPod Touch. While the original iPod could only hold 1,000 songs, the iPod classic model in 2009 had capacity for up to 40,000 songs.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 35\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n36\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\n2002 Replacing a two-way pager that became available in 1999, BlackBerry introduced a generation of mobile devices – the BlackBerry smart phone – allowing its users to send text messages, communicate via email, access the Internet, take photographs, make phone calls, and so on. It first won popularity among corporate executives but gradually became a mainstream gadget. Friendster was launched. Based on the ‘Circle of Friends’ technique for networking people in virtual communities, Friendster triggered the social networking revolution. It was the top online social networking service until 2004. 2003 Chris De Wolfe and Tom Anderson introduced MySpace, an online social networking service that quickly outgrew Friendster and, between 2005 and 2008, became the largest networking site in the world. Second Life, a user-centred online 3D virtual world, sparked the public’s obsession with creating virtual environments populated by avatars, the users’ virtual representation of themselves. 2004 Mark Zuckerberg, with his classmates and fellow students at Harvard University, launched Facebook – an online social networking service that eventually exceeded MySpace in popularity and became a major force driving the decade’s social networking. This advanced social networking service allowed users to engage in a variety of online activities such as posting status updates and photos, sharing videos, exchanging messages and receiving notifications. 2005 The launching of the video-sharing website YouTube gave an average person unprecedented power over social media. Any person could now record and share personal stories and performances, as well as broadcast social and political controversies. With the help of an inexpensive hand-held camera or a smart phone, anyone could become a virtual sensation.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 36\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n37\n\n2006 The online social networking service Twitter was launched to promote brief, instant and frequent communication. The service enables users to send and receive 140-character messages called tweets. Twitter brought brevity to social networking and increased the social and political impact of social media. Furthermore, to better facilitate student interactions in large lecture classes, Twitter was used as a learning tool in educational settings. As users were able to follow other users (not necessarily mutual friends), Twitter turned into a valuable information platform – but also a way to compromise one’s reputation. Nintendo launched Wii and Wii Sports, revolutionizing video gaming. Wii targeted a broader demographic by facilitating 3D participation in a video game: a person could play tennis or engage in a cardiovascular exercise while operating the controller. 2007 Apple released the touchscreen iPhone, whose consumer-friendly design as well as sizable memory and processing power made a significant impact on the smart phone industry. Mobile applications in smart phones – whether they are iPhones, BlackBerries, Android-powered phones or Palm devices – allowed people to perform a variety of tasks, such as playing a video game or accessing the Internet. Amazon introduced the Kindle, the first generation of e-book readers that enabled users to shop for, download, browse and read e-books and other digital media via Wi-Fi. 2008 The Retail DNA Test became available to the public, giving people access to their genetic profiles. Tesla Motors released the Tesla Roadster, the first highwaycapable battery-powered car. 2009 The solar shingle, a residential roof shingle in the form of a solar panel, became available on the market.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 37\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n38\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nBOX 1.16: TECHNOLOGICAL DEVICES Technologies and devices that were introduced in the 1990s but proliferated in the 2000s include Google Web Search, digital cameras, TiVo digital video recorders and DVDs. Toward the end of the decade, technological devices became smaller, more sophisticated and intuitive for users.\n\nScientific discoveries The human genome project An international scientific research project that explored the sequencing of human DNA to identify and map all human genes was completed in 2003. The project, which the US funded, is considered the world’s largest collaborative biological project. The project’s discoveries benefit multiple fields, including medicine, forensic sciences, agriculture and anthropology.\n\nStem cell research Stem cell research continued despite restrictions that President George W. Bush imposed in 2001 on federal funding of research on human embryonic cells. Scientists achieved significant breakthroughs in research that uses adult stem cells. In 2009, President Barack Obama issued an executive order on ‘Removing Barriers on Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells’. The decade’s stem cell research resulted in great success in treating spinal injuries and reversing blindness.\n\nNASA research In NASA research, major breakthroughs included the advent of orbital space tourism in 2001, with the first space tourist, American Dennis Tito, self-sponsoring his week-long stay in the International Space Station. In 2004, the Mars Exploration Rover Mission – an ongoing robotic space mission that includes two rovers – reached\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 38\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nINTRODUCTION: LIVING IN THE 2000s\n\n39\n\nthe surface of the planet Mars and communicated detailed data and images back to Earth. The mission found evidence of past water on the Martian surface. The Voyager I spacecraft entered the heliosheath, the outermost layer of the heliosphere, marking its first departure from the solar system. In 2005, with the discovery of Eris, an object in the Kuiper belt (an area beyond the solar system) larger than Pluto, Pluto was demoted to a ‘dwarf planet’. It had been considered a planet for 76 years. In 2009, the first Earth-like planet with a solid structure was discovered outside the solar system. Scientists also detected water ice on the Moon.\n\nMedical research The decade’s significant advances included the standardization of Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy, or combination therapy, for treating HIV/AIDS, as well as therapies for cancer treatment. The Food and Drug Administration approved 244 new drugs.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 39\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 40\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n2 Theatre in the 2000s Julia Listengarten\n\nBackground Mapping a landscape for the future of American theatre at the beginning of the twenty-first century, Ben Cameron – the executive director of Theatre Communications Group (TCG)1 at the time – identified challenges for theatre managers, artists and writers to address during the coming decade. He underlined the importance of serving broad communities by diversifying the audience base and identified theatre’s needs to create performance spaces to present experimental new work, to reassess the impact of technology on viewers and to commit to broader representation of traditionally marginalized groups. Asserting that ‘our audience increasingly operates from a visual, associative framework of perception’, Cameron urged practitioners to consider the implications of the increasingly developing Internet and image-driven culture for theatre, ‘long a teller of linear, narrative stories’. He acknowledged that American theatre had begun to tackle generational issues and had made significant strides in addressing racial concerns, but also said that ‘issues of gender, sexual orientation, and physical ability still tend[ed] to remain, unfortunately, on the peripheries of discussion’.2 As the country experienced devastating terrorist attacks, disastrous wars and financial meltdowns, as well as the incredible\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 41\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n42\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\ngrowth of digital and social media, Cameron’s call to re-examine the direction of American theatre resonated throughout the first decade of the 2000s. Theatre companies and practitioners looked for new ways to rethink financial and marketing strategies, increase activism locally and nationally, foster new artistic partnerships, collaborate with non-stage media and cultivate new audiences. These efforts continued into the next decade as theatre professionals, during roundtable discussions or through surveys that TCG facilitated in 2010 and 2011, pondered strategies to bring artists, institutions and communities together.3 This chapter aims to explore American theatre’s response to the unstable political, economic and cultural climate of the 2000s. While the following discussion addresses major developments on Broadway, Off-Broadway and in regional and experimental theatres, particular attention is paid to significant themes and trends that emerged from increased globalization, international conflicts, economic recession and national isolation. Some involved contention with identity and politics, expanded representation of marginalized voices, and moral and political relativism. Others concerned new methods of engagement with the audience, increased interdisciplinary and multicultural exchanges, and the effects of technological advancements on stage. Notably, the majority of these discussions and developments occurred across various types of theatre, often blurring the distinctions between commercial and not-for-profit organizations and encompassing traditional venues such as Broadway and regional theatres, as well as ensemble-based collectives committed to experimental work. In order to offer a wide-ranging perspective on American theatre during the decade, the chapter includes a discussion of new plays as well as a recognition of the growing importance of non-scripted, devised work created through groups’ collaborative processes. The goal of this study is to capture many facets of American theatre from 2000 to 2009: its dialogue with popular culture, questions about cultural assumptions of identity, integration of different art forms, and response to national and global concerns.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 42\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nTHEATRE IN THE 2000s\n\n43\n\nTheatre responds to 9/11 The 9/11 terrorist attacks resulted in thousands of lives lost, immense physical and financial devastation and fear of global terrorism, which drastically changed American society and had a tremendous impact on US culture. Downtown Manhattan theatre organizations near the World Trade Center were damaged and lost their homes. Theatre institutions in New York and around the nation faced financial disaster. Despite the initial shock that American theatres experienced with the rest of the country, many theatre communities stepped forward to give the public opportunities to unite and reflect. ‘Dark into Light, Light into Darkness: Atlanta Artists Respond’, at Atlanta’s Alliance Theatre Company, featured readings from classic plays and famous American speeches, including excerpts from William Shakespeare, John Steinbeck and Martin Luther King Jr. The text prepared by dramaturg Megan Monaghan for this occasion was subsequently performed in Philadelphia, Iowa City, Austin and Seattle. Additionally, theatre communities in New York City and elsewhere helped by organizing relief efforts and community dialogues. Starting on 22 October 2001, the Worth Street Theater Company held a free variety show every Monday evening, primarily intended for Ground Zero rescue crews. Titled The TriBeCa Playhouse Stage-Door Canteen,4 the show included performances by Broadway celebrities such as Adam Pasqual and Kristin Chenoweth. Donations collected at each performance benefited the Twin Towers Fund. Theatres made sensitive choices by cancelling or postponing productions whose subject matter could be a painful reminder of the tragedy. Five Broadway plays were cancelled in the week of 9/11: the Rocky Horror Picture Show; If You Ever Leave Me, I’m Going with You; Stones in His Pockets; A Thousand Clowns; and Blast! The McCarter Theatre in Princeton, New Jersey, cancelled a production of Richard Nelson’s The Vienna Notes – a political tale about a self-absorbed politician and his callous, ineffective response to a terrorist attack – explaining that ‘the context in which we would receive the play has changed drastically, and it would be insensitive of us to present the play at this moment in our history’.5 The Broadway revival of Stephen Sondheim’s Assassins at the Roundabout Theatre Company was postponed until the\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 43\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n44\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nspring of 2004. Zulu Time, a ‘techno-cabaret’ performance piece that Canadian theatre-maker Robert Lepage conceived to recreate unsettling experiences of air travel, was removed from the bill of the Quebec-New York 2001 multi-arts festival. One of the first shows that dealt with the 9/11 devastation, Reno’s A Rebel Without a Pause, opened in late October 2001 at La MaMa in the East Village. Reno, a comic monologist and feminist performer who lived a few blocks from the towers and experienced the unravelling of the tragedy first-hand, offered her own gut-wrenching memories of the day and contemplated her initial reactions filled with bewilderment and incomprehension. This both cathartic and witty performance was intensely personal but also included a ‘cheerfully scathing critique’ of President Bush and his administration.6 Filmmaker Nancy Savoca filmed Reno’s performance on 18 December 2001; the movie opened in May 2003. As film critic Stephen Holden observed, ‘There are no sacred cows in Reno’s cynical and absurdist take on terrorism and politics. Even Rudolph W. Giuliani is not exempt from comic scorn.’7 Just a few blocks from Ground Zero, the Flea Theater in downtown Manhattan responded twelve weeks after 9/11 with the staging of Anne Nelson’s The Guys. Prompted by Jim Simpson, the Flea Theater artistic director, Nelson – a first-time playwright – wrote a two-person play from her experience of helping a New York fire captain compose eulogies for firefighters. The production, starring Sigourney Weaver and Bill Murray, was subsequently staged in other American cities and abroad. In August 2002, Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins took the play to the Edinburgh Festival, where they offered three sold-out performances. Commenting on the play’s merit and the stars’ excellent performances, critic Michael Billington also noted the script’s ‘congratulatory and politically incurious’ nature.8 In 2002, the play was adapted into a film, and in 2006, it returned to the Flea Theater for a commemorative run on the fifth anniversary of 9/11. Although Christopher Shinn’s Where Do We Live never references 9/11 directly, this play traces the catastrophe’s impact on young New Yorkers living on Manhattan’s Lower East Side. Where Do We Live was produced in May 2002 at the Royal Court Theatre in London before making its way back to New York for the American premiere in 2004 at Off-Broadway’s Vineyard Theatre. In David Rimmer’s New York, which opened in New\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 44\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nTHEATRE IN THE 2000s\n\n45\n\nYork in April 2002 at Lotus for the Disaster Psychiatry Outreach, characters engaged in personal contemplations of the tragedy as they individually reflect on their own harrowing experiences in a psychiatrist office soon after 9/11. The Bomb, a controversial piece performed by the International WOW Company in March 2002 at the Flamboyán Theater on the Lower East Side, ‘wove together material dealing with the Second World War, the atomic age, and 9/11 to create a powerful meditation on modern violence and terror’, scholar Marvin Carlson observed.9 Pointing to the significance of this work in the aftermath of 9/11, New York Times critic Lawrence Van Gelder wrote that The Bomb ‘raised questions not just about the role of the United States in creating nuclear bombs but also about responsibility, good and evil, and mankind’s seemingly ineluctable propensity for waging war and wreaking mass destruction’.10 As the country struggled with anxiety over national security and the global implications of terror, theatre addressed concerns about the role of Western democracies in world politics but also pointed to the importance of personal responsibility and the tragic consequences of silence and denial. A few theatre works written or created before the attacks resonated in a post-9/11 world by challenging the audience to weigh difficult questions of blame, complicity and agency. Tony Kushner’s Homebody/Kabul (1999), which captures the cultural divide between the West and Afghanistan, premiered on 25 December 2001, at the New York Theatre Workshop. Subsequently, the Theatre Workshop presented the first American production of Caryl Churchill’s Far Away (2000); its opening, on 11 November 2002, perhaps intentionally followed the first anniversary of 9/11. Referring to these works as ‘the powerful achievements of the deepest kind of political theater’, critic Alisa Solomon wrote in the Village Voice that ‘Far Away – like Homebody/Kabul – is prophetic not so much in predicting catastrophe, but in exposing the devastation human beings have already wrought but failed to take responsibility for.’11 Multiple productions of Greek tragedies, specifically Medea (Milwaukee’s Chamber Theatre, the Pittsburgh Public Theater, the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga, California, Theatre de la Jeune Lune in Minneapolis and Classical Theater of Harlem in New York), compelled audiences to re-examine guilt, violence, retribution and suffering.\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 45\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n46\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\nAs the first anniversary of 9/11 approached and Americans began to grapple with the new post-9/11 reality, more intentional responses – sometimes subtle and indirect but more often explicit and full of heartfelt commentary – emerged in playwriting and performance. Craig Wright’s Recent Tragic Events (which premiered in September 2002 at the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington, DC, and was produced in September 2003 by Playwrights Horizons, an Off-Broadway company) concerned a blind date on 12 September 2001; it was called the first 9/11 comedy. Neil LaBute’s The Mercy Seat, which opened in December 2002 at New York’s Acorn Theatre and starred Weaver and Liev Schreiber, is also set on the day after the tragedy and taps into darker, morally ambiguous responses that a disaster of this magnitude may have triggered. The main character, Ben, worked at the World Trade Center but happened to be away with his mistress during the attacks. Thinking that his family might believe he died, he is consumed by an egotistical urge and contemplates eloping with his mistress and starting a new life. Schreiber, who portrayed Ben in the New York production, admired LaBute’s willingness to address ‘complicated and disturbing feelings around loss and grief and terror … in their ugly and naked glory’.12 Anthems: Culture Clash in the District, commissioned and produced in August 2002 by Arena Stage in Washington, DC, offers a different perspective on post-9/11 America, in which racial and ethnic hatred dramatically increased. Richard Montoya, one of the co-founders of the Chicano troupe Culture Clash – known for biting satire of cultural stereotyping and sophisticated humour – began his research for the piece while flying to Washington, DC, six days after the attacks. He remembered how challenging it became for him, a person of colour, to negotiate the nation’s airports a few days after the terrorist attacks. As he contemplated society’s understanding and perception of terrorism, he invited the audience to step away from the immediate post-9/11 shock, look deeper into the harsh realities that various communities faced from past terror and reflect on the country’s increasing sense of alienation and fear of the ‘other’. ‘Sometimes the face of terror comes in forty-one bullets in a vestibule, sometimes the face of terror wears a white sheet over its face … sometimes terror kills transgenders in southeast D.C.’ and ‘sometimes the face of terror looks like Timothy McVeigh’,13 he said, referring to the 1999 New\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 46\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nTHEATRE IN THE 2000s\n\n47\n\nYork police killing of Amadou Diallo, the Ku Klux Klan, a wave of hate crime in Washington and the 1995 Oklahoma City bomber. A year later, a number of other plays that premiered in the fall and winter of 2002 offered moving, intimate meditations and personal reflections on 9/11. Jonathan Bell’s Portraits, seven monologues in part inspired by real people and their stories of 9/11, was first produced in September 2002 at the Ridgefield Playhouse in Connecticut before moving to New York in 2003. The film version of Israel Horovitz’s 3 Weeks After Paradize aired on 11 September 2002, on the Bravo cable TV network. Written two months after the attacks, the one-person play – Horovitz’s response ‘from the heart and mind of a father worried about his children and the world they will inherit’14 – quickly won national and international attention. Also on 11 September 2002, members of the New York theatre community organized a three-day marathon, ‘Brave New World – American Theatre Responds to 9/11’, the first united artistic response to the tragedy. The event took place at Manhattan’s Town Hall where many theatre artists and playwrights embraced their artistic and social responsibility to contribute to the country’s healing process. More than 100 artists, recognized and emerging performers and writers, presented short plays, multimedia shows and music to remember the victims, reflect on the impact of the attacks on individuals and society and help the country heal. New works featured during the event included Edwin Sanchez’s Pops, about a young Hispanic man coming to terms with the death of his father, a bus boy at the Windows on the World restaurant in the World Trade Center; Jonathan Marc Sherman’s Ribbon in the Sky, a series of concurrent monologues of male and female twins who were born during construction of the Twin Towers; and Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens’s A Song for LaChanze, a tribute to the singer, whose husband was killed on 9/11.15 Among short works at the event was LaBute’s Land of the Dead, in which a woman has an abortion on the day her husband died in the attacks. On the first anniversary of 9/11, critic Christopher Rawson offered his insight into the complexity and enormity of theatre’s task in addressing the current physical and emotional devastation: ‘9/11 is no single traumatic event but a complex mix of reactions, issues and fears, running from personal loss to cultural sensitivity, from heightened security to altered funding.’16 This\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 47\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\n48\n\nMODERN AMERICAN DRAMA: PL AYWRITING 2000–2009\n\ntask was the focus of eleven playwrights whose reflections about ‘putting 9/11 on stage’ were published in the September 2002 issue of American Theatre magazine. Playwrights such as Herman Daniel Farrell III (in Justice) and Montoya (in Anthems: Culture Clash in the District) spoke of their search for a balance between art and activism. Others, such as Brian Jucha and Caridad Svich, discussed their decision to employ technology to ‘make sense out of [the] incomprehensible’.17 Working with Houston’s Infernal Bridegroom Productions, Jucha used transcripts of air traffic controllers’ communication with pilots of the 9/11 planes to create a performance text for his interdisciplinary dance-theatre piece We Have Some Planes. Svich based her collaborative project Return to the Upright Position on a series of responses to 9/11 by a dozen theatre artists who communicated them across cyberspace. Some writers shared their personal feelings and the ways they expressed them – ferociously through grief and outrage or quietly in a more delicate, elegiac manner. Honour Kane, the author of autodelete:// beginning dump of physical memory//, remembered: I watched helplessly as my neighbors to the south began to leap from the windows of those burning towers … A woman clawed her way upward as she plunged, trying so desperately to climb the sky. For months I couldn’t write. The horrors of that day were too human. It was the day narrative was lost. But my memory of that climbing woman kept haunting me. Finally, after time, I found a way through my work to see her safely home, send her onwards, upwards and amend her brutal end.18 Other artists, the Lebanese-American Najee George Mondalek and the Iranian Gita Khashabi, considered how their works (Me No Terrorist and Chadoor, respectively), which were written before 9/11, became transformed by the attacks and inadvertently offered new political meaning. As the decade progressed and the emotional pain along with the feelings of shock and disbelief gradually subsided, new plays and production work began to interrogate the social implications and political reverberations of the 2001 terrorist attacks. In Omnium Gatherum, written by Theresa Rebeck and Alexandra Gersten-Vassilaros and first presented at the 2003 Humana Festival at Actors Theatre of Louisville, Kentucky, a small group of\n\n9781472571472_txt_print.indd 48\n\n10/11/2016 14:45\n\nTHEATRE IN THE 2000s\n\n49\n\nintellectuals at a dinner party engages in a passionate dialogue about the ramifications of 9/11.19 Eve Ensl"
