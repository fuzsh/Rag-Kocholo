Diamond\n\nActor Bios\n\nCreative Team Bios\n\nGeneral Information\n\nPlayMakers Staff\n\nFriends of PlayMakers\n\nCorporate and Foundation Partners\n\nDesktop Computer Version of playbill available here\n\nDear Friends,\n\nHappy 2022!\n\nThank you for being here. Coming out of a complicated holiday season (I hope filled with more joy than stress), I am thrilled to welcome you back to the theatre with Lydia Diamond’s compelling family dramedy, “Stick Fly”. A huge hit on the theatre circuit when it premiered several years ago, its resonances in 2022 seem freshly profound in the midst of the national conversation about the impact of racism and equity on all of our institutions: marriage, family, education, community and on and on.\n\nAs we were planning this season, in conversation with PlayMakers company member and Artistic Associate, Kathy Williams, this title kept resurfacing. It’s a play near and dear to her heart and one that she has taught in her classes for many years. Her admiration and enthusiasm for the play was clear, and it created a perfect opportunity for her directorial debut in the Paul Green Theatre. It was also a wonderful opportunity to collaborate with a stellar design team and feature five of our fantastic third-year Professional Actor Training Program actors, allowing them the challenge and opportunity to showcase their talents alongside our estimable guest actor, Oscar Best, in the role of the family’s patriarch.\n\nI am so admiring of Kathy’s thoughtful work on this play, rich with the complexity of family dynamics, where so much of the drama—as is so often the case in life—lives in what is unsaid.\n\nI am happy to shout from the rafters, however, that this is the first of three plays this season written by superb female playwrights. Lydia is joined later in the season by Dipika Guha and her fittingly brilliant “Yoga Play” and Tracy Young with a riveting adaptation of Madeleine L’Engle’s “A Wrinkle in Time”. Three powerhouse playwrights (in the hands of three equally fabulous female directors!) offering richly diverse storytelling for our PlayMakers audiences. I hope you’ll join us for all of them.\n\nHere’s to a year ahead of health, clarity and fantastic theatre!\n\nWarmly,\n\nVivienne\n\nJump to: Letter from Viv | Support PlayMakers | Who We Are | Title Page | Program Notes | About Lydia R. Diamond | Actor Bios | Creative Team Bios | General Information | PlayMakers Staff | Friends of PlayMakers | Corporate and Foundation Partners\n\nIt is my pleasure to serve another year as the chair of the PlayMakers Advisory Council and welcome you back to the Paul Green Theatre stage for our 2021-22 season.\n\nOur five-show season was born out of the need to celebrate the healing power of human connection after a year that challenged us all. We believe that the theatre will have an important role to play in making sense of the complex world in which we find ourselves in. When I walk out of PlayMakers after a show, I always say how lucky we are to have a theater with such world-class performances right here in Chapel Hill. This season, I am grateful for the opportunity to experience PlayMakers’ signature variety of shows, live and in person once again!\n\nIn addition to an impressive lineup of powerful performances, PlayMakers continues its work serving the Triangle community and beyond. We are privileged to provide unique learning opportunities for K–12 classrooms and UNC students, creating new ways to engage with our local artists and advocates, and make the power and joy of theatre accessible to underserved communities.\n\nTheatre is and always will be a place for community. And it is up to us—the community—to ensure that PlayMakers continues to thrive. Gifts from patrons like you will be critical to our success as we navigate reopening after more than a year away from producing live theatre with in-person audiences. If you enjoy and believe in the power of the theatre as I do, I invite you to become a Friend of PlayMakers. Please make a tax-deductible contribution to the annual fund, pledge a monthly donation as a Sustainer, or offer a campaign gift to strengthen and sustain PlayMakers’ vision for the future.\n\nI truly believe that there has never been a more important time to support the arts. Join me in championing our local theatre—an organization that makes a difference in our community. As Joan Gillings often said, “You will sit a little taller in your theatre seat, knowing you made a difference, too.”\n\nThank you!\n\nWarmly,\n\nAmy Guskiewicz\n\nDonate\n\nPlayMakers Advisory Council\n\nAmy Guskiewicz, Chair\n\nBetsy Blackwell, Vice Chair\n\nDuncan Lascelles, Vice Chair\n\nJoanne Garrett\n\nDeborah Gerhardt\n\nBobbi Hapgood\n\nJanelle Hoskins\n\nBetty Kenan, emeritus\n\nStuart Lascelles\n\nRobert Long, emeritus\n\nGraig Meyer\n\nJulie Morris\n\nFlorence Peacock\n\nDiane Robertson\n\nWyndham Robertson\n\nCarol Smithwick\n\nJackie Tanner\n\nMike Wiley\n\nIn Memoriam\n\nWe Remember Joan Gillings\n\nPlayMakers Repertory Company and the Department of Dramatic Art mourn the extraordinary loss of our dear friend, Joan H. Gillings, who passed away in February surrounded by family at her home in Wrightsville Beach, NC.\n\nJoan was a lover of the arts and her dedication and support of our work was unparalleled. As a member of the PlayMakers Advisory Council for over 10 years, and its chair for 7, she worked closely with our staff on a multitude of projects including serving as chair for our annual PlayMakers Ball for many years, participating in our Producing Artistic Director search in 2015, and building lasting relationships with our students and faculty. Her transformational gift in 2017 has allowed us to expand opportunities for our students, support dynamic new work on our stages, and enhance performance and outreach offerings in our community. For Joan, her philanthropy and enthusiasm always came back to one thing – “the kids,” as she liked to call them – and her love for UNC can be felt and seen all over our campus. She brought an unmistakable joy and enthusiasm every time she entered our building and we aspire to carry that spirit forward in everything we do.\n\nWe are forever grateful to have known Joan and are honored to carry on her transformational legacy through our work in the building that bears her name. She will be sorely missed.\n\nJump to: Letter from Viv | Support PlayMakers | Who We Are | Title Page | Program Notes | About Lydia R. Diamond | Actor Bios | Creative Team Bios | General Information | PlayMakers Staff | Friends of PlayMakers | Corporate and Foundation Partners\n\nPlayMakers is…\n\n“One of America’s Best Regional Theatres” (American Theatre Magazine), PlayMakers Repertory Company is North Carolina’s premier professional theatre company, proudly in residence on the dynamic campus of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. The professional company was founded in 1976, growing out of a storied 100 year tradition of playmaking at Carolina. Our mission is to produce relevant, courageous work that tells stories from and for a multiplicity of perspectives. We believe that theatre can have a transformational impact on individuals and entire communities, and we are committed to the work of becoming an anti-racist organization whose work is accessible to all.\n\nAt the very heart of the PlayMakers experience is one of the nation’s last remaining resident theatre companies, made up of accomplished performers, directors, designers, artisans, and technicians, and supported by exceptional graduate students in UNC’s Department of Dramatic Art. Our company works side by side with guest artists from all over the world and our alumni include Pulitzer Prize, Tony®, Emmy®, and Grammy Award® winners.\n\nCreating Tomorrow’s Classics, Today\n\nProducing Artistic Director Vivienne Benesch is continuing PlayMakers’ tradition of producing vibrantly reimagined classics, large-scale musical theatre, and significant contemporary work, but is also broadening the company’s reach to become a home for new play development and a true hub of social and civic discourse in the region. Her first five seasons have already given life to ten important new American plays.\n\nA Hub of Engagement\n\nPlayMakers seeks to provoke thought, stimulate discussion and push the boundaries of the theatrical form in everything we do. Whether through our intimate @Play series, our mainstage offerings or our virtual line-up, we look for opportunities for direct, dynamic engagement between audiences, artists and thinkers. The Vision Series, post-show discussions and a host of unique engagement opportunities – including the continuation of last season’s online PlayMakers Keeping You Company – enrich our audience’s experience of the live arts.\n\nTheatre for the People\n\nPlayMakers Mobile is an initiative that seeks to contribute positively to the civic and social life of our region by taking world-class theatre out of our building and into the community. We create a streamlined production of a play each year and take it to schools, transitional housing facilities, and long-term treatment facilities around the Greater Triangle area. And best of all, it’s all free of charge. We look forward to getting back on the road as soon as we can do so safely.\n\nPassing the Torch\n\nPlayMakers’ award-winning Summer Youth Conservatory is the only professionally supported training program of its kind in the region. The Theatre Quest program provides camps to area middle school students, while the Theatre Intensive and TheatreTech programs allow Triangle high schoolers to apprentice directly with professional directors, choreographers, musical directors, and technicians, culminating in a professional quality production on the PlayMakers mainstage for the whole community to enjoy.\n\nEliminating Barriers\n\nWith a commitment to eliminating barriers for attendance when we host live events, PlayMakers offers All Access performances for our patrons living with disabilities, we offer accessible $20 tickets for all performances, and tickets reduced to just $10 for UNC students and $12 for all other students. Our Spotlight on Service program also offers complimentary tickets to local service organizations. This season, we are proud to offer complimentary tickets to front-line workers in honor of their ongoing service to the community. For more information, please contact prcboxoffice@unc.edu.\n\nOur Mission\n\nAs the premiere professional theatre company of North Carolina, PlayMakers Repertory Company strives to produce entertaining, relevant, and courageous work that tells stories from and for a multiplicity of perspectives and creates transformational impact in our immediate and extended communities.\n\nOur Vision\n\nProvoke\n\nRepresent\n\nCreate\n\nOur Values\n\nArtistic excellence and artistry\n\nEducation and training\n\nCommunity engagement\n\nAccess and equity\n\nFinancial health\n\nDiscovery and innovation\n\nCollaboration and communication\n\nCulture of support\n\nAntiracism Accountability Statement\n\nAt the heart of PlayMakers Repertory Company’s mission is the belief that theater has the power to transform individuals and entire communities. There is no more aspirational or urgent a use of that power than working to dismantle the systems of oppression, white supremacy, and racism that pervade American life and consume the American Theatre. PlayMakers continues to assess and evaluate our own practices in order to embed equitable, antiracist policies into strategic planning, our mission, and our operations.\n\nPlayMakers Repertory Company, and those of us who work here, commit to the following:\n\nTo work intentionally to create an antiracist culture in our company.\n\nTo continually educate ourselves on the ways in which we can combat racism locally and nationally as we move to create an inclusive, diverse, and equitable sense of belonging for every one of our constituents.\n\nTo demonstrate our values through action in our policies, practices, and procedures.\n\nWe are grateful to Black, Indigenous and People of Color artists and administrators within our local community as well as the larger theatrical community across the country for the resources they’ve expended, both in time and emotional labor. Their work lays an important foundation for us by articulating some of the harmful practices that must change immediately as well as identifying pathways for the long-term evolution that must follow. In that light, this document is the beginning of a response to the demands for change made by the anti-racist organization #WeSeeYouWhiteAmericanTheater.\n\nAs a professional theatre company embedded in, and inextricably linked to the Department of Dramatic Art (DDA) at the University of North Carolina–Chapel Hill, the path forward will be complex and singular. We will therefore be updating our action items and commitments continuously as our work evolves.\n\nWe at PlayMakers understand our responsibility not only to the artists, staff, and audiences with which we engage, but significantly, to the many students training here for a career in the theater.\n\nFor more information on our next steps, please read our full statement here.\n\nThese are not our first steps, and by no means our last. They are not perfect. And they are not enough. But they are steps forward. We invite you to come back to our website and our theater often and monitor our progress. We take our responsibility to this effort seriously and we welcome your involvement and assessment.\n\nLand Acknowledgement\n\nWe acknowledge that the Center for Dramatic Art is located on the unceded lands of one or more of Abiayala’s (the Americas’) original sovereign nations, the name(s) of which have not yet been affirmed. The unjust acquisition of these Indigenous lands came about through a history of racism, violence, dispossession, displacement, and erasure of cultures by settlers as part of the larger, land-centered project of settler colonialism.\n\nAs we look to the future, please join us in acknowledging and learning about the atrocities committed against these Nations and work with us towards inclusion, representation, and a better relationship with citizens of sovereign American Indian and Alaska Native nations.\n\nWhy is Land Acknowledgement important?\n\nThis statement is part of the continual interrogation of our own participation and complacency in colonial structures and a call for greater awareness, accountability, and intentionality in the work we do. As storytellers we are committed to learning and telling stories in ways that will have transformational impact in our immediate and extended communities.\n\nWe are excited by future partnerships with Native Americans and look forward to sharing this journey of knowledge and growth with you.\n\nLearn more: UNC American Indian Center\n\nJump to: Letter from Viv | Support PlayMakers | Who We Are | Title Page | Program Notes | About Lydia R.

Diamond | Actor Bios | Creative Team Bios | General Information | PlayMakers Staff | Friends of PlayMakers | Corporate and Foundation Partners\n\nby Jacqueline E. Lawton\n\nLydia Diamond is a brilliant and talented playwright. Her characters are bold, passionate, intelligent, and flawed. The worlds she creates are rich, complex, and engaging. Her dialogue is pointed and intelligent. She also has a sharp mind for comedy. Her plays include The Bluest Eye, The Gift Horse, Harriet Jacobs, The Inside, Smart People, Stage Black, and Voyeurs de Venus. She has received numerous awards including the African American Arts Alliance of Chicago Black Excellence Award, an Independent Reviewers of New England (IRNE) Award, an LA Weekly Theater Award, and a Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award.\n\nDiamond studied theatre at Northwestern University and discovered playwriting in her junior year. In an interview with Broadway Direct, she explained that through playwriting she found “an artistic outlet that was not predicated upon fitting myself into plays without characters who looked like me.” She found a sense of purpose and autonomy in writing plays. She goes on to say, “I could tell my own stories, populated with people who looked like me or the diverse array of people in my life.” The people in her plays are well-drawn, deeply human, and recognizable. Stick Fly is a perfect example of how Diamond writes characters we know or could know to help audiences better understand ourselves.\n\nStick Fly is set in 2005 on Martha’s Vineyard. In the play, we meet the wealthy and successful LeVay family at their summer house. This is a special family weekend because the LeVay sons have invited the women in their lives home to meet the family. Diamond was inspired to write Stick Fly because she wanted to write a comedic, well-made play that explored the themes of family, legacy, and generational conflict. She was particularly interested the dynamics of fatherhood. In an interview with Writers Theatre, Diamond explains:\n\n“I knew I wanted to explore fatherhood and what that meant—absent and present fathers, and how present fathers can maybe be absent and all of that—but I wanted it to be like a comedy.”\n\nDiamond also wanted to explore class and the Black experience. She was interested in the way that race informs wealth and power, and the impact of racism within the Black community by writing about a wealthy Black family, she overturns stereotypes, societal expectations, and sheds lights on part of Black history that many people do not know. In that same interview, Diamond shares:\n\n“I wanted to put in this house three classes of people and how that played out over the course of a weekend. I knew that I wanted them to be people who had been financially privileged for generations, so I knew it was either going to be Hilton Head or Martha’s Vineyard: two of the places in America where Black people have gone for a long time. But Martha’s Vineyard had an even richer history. I didn’t go to Martha’s Vineyard until shortly before the play had its Broadway premiere, and it was fascinating because it was the first time I’d been in a place where Black people could vacation and not be questioned. There’s a freedom there that was new for me.”\n\nThrough Stick Fly, we can see the power of Diamond’s skill as a storyteller. She weaves the themes of the plays into the characters and their relationships with each other. In the play, we meet Kent, the youngest son, who hasn’t quite figured out his path in life, but still hopes to impress his demanding, prominent, and well-respected father, Joe. Kent’s fiancée is Taylor, an intelligent and ambitious entomologist, who grew up middle class and feels out of place in wealth and prestige. Then there is Flip, the eldest son, who is a successful plastic surgeon and quite the charmer. He’s quite the package and has had all the advantages that wealth can afford, but he also has some growing up to do. Flip’s girlfriend, Kimber is a wealthy white woman, whose poise and confidence set her at ease in this world. On the other side of the financial spectrum is Cheryl, the daughter of the family maid, but her long-time association with the family gives her a sense of comfort that Taylor craves.\n\nDiamond has set the stage for a dramatic and dynamic weekend, and she does not disappoint. As the weekend progresses, the LeVay family secrets are revealed and the ties that bind are stretched to the seams. Like many families, the LeVays must learn how to come together, how to heal, and how to move forward. And as with most family gatherings, they find it’s best to keep the mojitos flowing!\n\nJump to: Letter from Viv | Support PlayMakers | Who We Are | Title Page | Program Notes | About Lydia R.
