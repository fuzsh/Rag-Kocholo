As playwrights, we have all struggled to approach a subject that we want to write about but can’t find our way into.

Together we’ll discuss some excerpts of physically exciting work pulled from plays, dance, physical theater, and contemporary circus, and then we’ll do some generative playwriting inspired by the examples. So if you want to experiment with new ways of revealing character, theatricalizing conflict, braiding movement techniques into your writing, or blurring the boundaries between theater, dance, and circus, this class is for you. (Don’t worry: no movement experience needed. No athleticism needed either. Just an open, curious mind.)\n\nOnline (via Zoom)\n\nNone\n\nL M Feldman is a queer, feminist playwright who writes theatrically adventurous, physically kinetic, ensemble-driven plays – usually about outsiders, often about searchers, always about the human connection.

Some are finding this a fabulous moment for artistic productivity, but others are finding creative output all but impossible right now. For those of us who are struggling to write, this can be a good time to turn our attention towards input, towards creative nourishment, towards a kind of sabbatical when we can pause and restock our artistic shelves. In this four-week class, PlayPenn fan favorite instructor L M Feldman will guide students through craft-based discussions of four stylistically diverse (and hopefully not-yet-known-to-you) new plays, to be announced prior to the start date. Each week will focus on one script (to be read at home in advance of each class), and will be paired with an in-class writing prompt to help gently spark some creativity again. Part book club and part writing workshop, this course invites its participants to take comfort in and inspiration from the rich world of contemporary plays; to embrace this time as a chance to replenish our own soil.\n\nOnline (via Zoom)\n\nStudents will purchase and read four scripts as part of their participation in this class; we’re eager to support playwrights and their work during this precarious time.

By examining excerpts from plays such Burn This, and Becky Shaw, and TV shows such as Fleabag and Mad Men, we will identify the strategic use of humor, adapting these strategies for our own work.
