This vocation for women is especially an American institution. In no other country are there so many who have obtained recognition in a field where the compensation is the same for women as for men. The New Theatre when opened made its bow to the public with a play from the pen of an American woman.\n\nMary Hunter Austin, the newest woman dramatist, has spent the greater part of her life in the West, and many of her plays deal with the border life.\n\nMargaret Mayo is another successful playwright, who was the author of \"Baby Mine\" and \"Polly of the Circus,\" two of the biggest New York successes. In private life Miss Mayo is the wife of Edgar Selwyn, a successful writer and playwright of distinction. He is the author of \"The Country Boy.\"\n\nKate Douglas Wiggin, whose writings we are all familiar with, dramatized her \"Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.\"\n\nCharlotte Thompson made a most successful dramatization of \"The Awakening of Helena Richie,\" in which Margaret Anglin starred.\n\nAnother successful playwright is the author of \"The Nest Egg\"—Anne Caldwell, who has been an actress, opera singer, musician, composer, magazine and newspaper writer.\n\nThe music of \"The Top of the World\" is her composition, position.\n\n​ Another talented writer of plays is Rida Johnson Young, who in five years has successfully produced \"Brown of Harvard,\" 'The Boys of Company B,\" \"Glorious Betsey,\" \"The Lottery Man,\" as well as two plays for Chauncey Olcott. One of the New York successes, \"Naughty Marietta,\" was written by her, Victor Herbert writing the music. Mrs. Young is the wife of Mr. James Young, leading man, who has appeared with E. H. Sothern. He was formerly a newspaper man on the staff of a daily newspaper of Baltimore, Md. Mrs. Young before her marriage was Rida Johnson.\n\nLottie Blair Parker is another successful professional woman, whose husband, Harry Doel Parker, attends entirely to the production and the leasing of her plays. \"Way Down East,\" written in 1897, is still being played throughout the country. \"Under Southern Skies\" is another one from her pen. Among others by this same author are \"A War Correspondent,\" \"The Lights of Home,\" a dramatization of \"The Redemption of David Corson,\" a number of one-act plays, and a novel entitled \"Homespun.\"\n\nMiss Alice Ives, the author of \"The Village Postmaster,\" has done every phase of literary work, art criticisms, music notes, deep articles for the Forum and similar magazines, as well as some light verse. She has written ten plays. \"The Village Postmaster\" was on the road for ten successive seasons. Miss Ives wrote a clever one-act play, a satire on women's clubs, introducing all the famous women characters of popular plays. She is the first vice-president of the Society of Women Dramatists, to which all these playwrights belong.\n\nThe pioneer playwright of her sex is Miss Martha Morton. Some dozen years ago, the New York World offered prizes for the cleverest scenarios to be submitted under assumed names. It was a general surprise when a woman secured one of the prizes. This successful person was Miss Morton. Some of the ​ most distinguished American actors have appeared in her plays, the best known of which are, \"Brother John,\" \"His Wife's Father,\" and \"A Bachelor's Romance.\" Miss Morton was the first vice-president of the Society of Dramatic Authors. Off the stage she is Mrs. Herman Conheim, and is one of the most popular dramatists in New York City.\n\nAnother successful prize winner, who ultimately made this her profession, was Mrs. Martha Fletcher Bellinger, a graduate of Mount Holyoke. The title of her scenario was \"A Woman's Sphere.\"\n\nMrs. Mary Rider Mechtold, also a college woman and successful winner of newspaper prizes, wrote her first plays when she was still a student at the Chicago University. She is the author of a clever play, \"The Little Lady.\"\n\nThe thousand-dollar prize offered by the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in England a year or two ago was won by an American woman, Josephine Preston Peabody. The contest for the best play in English verse dealing with a romantic subject was won by a graduate of Radcliffe. It is said that this college has long been famous for its unusually clever plays, in which its students take part.\n\nBeulah Dix is also a graduate of Radcliffe. She was author of \"Hugh Gwyeth.\" She collaborated with Evelyn Greenleaf in a number of successful plays, \"The Rose o' Plymouth Town,\" and \"The Road to Yesterday.\"\n\nAnother Radcliffe graduate, who has become a successful playwright, is Agnes Morgan, who wrote \"When Two Write History.\"\n\nAnother is Rebecca Lane Hooper. Miss Hooper not only stages these performances herself, but has often played comedy roles.\n\nThe exception to the rule of directors for theatrical performances, which are usually men, is Miss Edith Ellis, author ​ of \"Mary Jane's Pa,\" one of the most successful plays produced. She began her career as a child actress. She is one of the few successful stage managers, and has frequently strengthened lines in places and made a possible success from what seemed an inevitable failure.\n\nRachel Crothers is another who supervises much of the rehearsing of her own plays. She began her authorship of plays while a teacher in the Wheatcroft School of Acting. Among her plays are \"The Coming of Mrs. Patrick,\" \"Myself Bettina,\" and \"The Inferior Sex,\" which were written for Maxine Elliott. \"The Man on the Box\" was dramatized by Grace Livingston Furniss, who with the late Abby Sage Richardson dramatized \"The Pride of Jennico.\" Since then she has written a number of other plays, including, \"Mrs. Jack,\" \"The Colonial Girl,\" and \"Gretna Green.\"\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett writes her books and then dramatizes them. This she has done most successfully in the case of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" \"The Little Princess,\" \"A Lady of Quality,\" \"That Lass o' Lowries,\" \"The Pretty Sister of Jose,\" and \"The Dawn of a To-morrow.\"\n\nHarriet Ford has successfully dramatized many books, among them: \"The Gentleman of France,\" \"Audrey,\" and with Mr. Joseph Medill Patterson, she wrote the most successful play of last season (1910-1911), \"The Fourth Estate.\" This play brought forth more favorable comment and discussion from the press than any other produced.\n\nMiss Mary Roberts Rinehart has written three plays, two of which were in co-authorship, \"Double Life,\" \"The Avenger,\" and \"Seven Days.\" Her husband, Dr. Stanley Rinehart, contributed to \"The Avenger,\" and Avery Hapgood to \"Seven Days.\" This was one of the season's successes.\n\nTwo successful playwrights, Pauline Phelps and Marion Short, have formed a partnership and turned out a number of most successful plays. Miss Phelps, a country girl, deals ​ with life in the country, and Miss Short, with city life and its problems. Their greatest success is \"The Grand Army Man,\" in which David Warfield starred last season. They are also the authors of \"The Girl from Out Yonder,\" \"At Cozy Corners,\" \"Sweet Clover,\" the latter used largely for stock companies.\n\nAnne Warner's \"Rejuvenation of Aunt Mary\" is familiar to everyone.\n\nFrances Aymar Matthews, as well as being a successful dramatist, is a writer of poetry and books. One of her plays, \"Julie Bon Bon,\" was starred by Clara Lipman.\n\nAmong others that may be mentioned are : Cora Maynard, Kate Jordan, and Mrs. Doremus.\n\nMARY W. CALKINS.\n\nMiss Calkins is head of the Department of Philosophy and Psychology at Wellesley College. She was born in Hartford, Connecticut, in 1863, and is the daughter of Wolcott and Charlotte Grosvenor Whiton Calkins. Miss Calkins is a graduate of Smith College of the Class of 1885, where she received the degrees of A.B. and A.M. She has written several books on psychology and numerous monographs and papers on psychological and philosophical questions.\n\nVIDA D. SCUDDER.\n\nMiss Scudder is to-day professor of English at Wellesley College and a well-known writer on literary and social topics. She was born in Southern India, December 15, 1861, and is the daughter of David Coit and Harriet L. Dutton Scudder. She received the degree of A.B. at Smith College in 1884 and that of A.M. in 1889, graduated at Oxford and Paris, and was the originator of the College Settlement in New York City. She is the author of \"The Life of the Spirit in Modern English Poets,\" \"Social Ideals in English Letters,\" \"Introduction to the Study of English Literature\" and \"Selected Letters of Saint Catherine,\" and was the editor of Macaulay's \"Lord Give,\" and also of the introduction to the writings of John Ruskin, Shelly's \"Prometheus Unbound,\" works of John Woolman and Everybody's Library.\n\nHANNAH ADAMS.\n\nMiss Adams is believed to be the first woman in the United States to make literature a profession. She was born in Medfield, Massachusetts, in 1755, and died in Brookline, Mass., November 15, 1832. She was the daughter of a well-to​ do farmer, of good education and culture. In her childhood she was very fond of writing and a close student, memorizing the works of Milton, Pope, Thomson, Young and others. She was a good Latin and Greek scholar and instructed divinity students who made their home in her family. In 1772, her father losing his property, the children were forced to provide for themselves. During the Revolutionary War, Miss Adams had taught school and after the close of the war she opened a school to prepare young men for college, which was very successful. She wrote quite extensively. One of her books, \"A View of Religious Opinions\" appeared in 1784, and passed through several editions in the United States and was also published in England and became a standard work. In 1799 she published her second work, \"A History of England,\" and in 1801 \"Evidences of Christianity.\" In 1812, her \"History of the Jews\" appeared, being followed by \"A Controversy with Dr. Morse,\" and in 1826 \"Letters on the Gospels.\" She spent a quiet, secluded life, and it is said her only journeys were trips from Boston to Nahant and from Boston to Chelmsford. Notwithstanding the many books which she published, her business abilities seemed to have been very limited and in the last years of her life she was supported by an annuity settled upon her by three wealthy residents of Boston. She was buried at Mount Auburn, being the first person buried in that beautiful cemetery.\n\nLYDIA MARIA CHILD.\n\nLydia Maria Francis was born in Medford, Massachusetts, February II, 1802. Her ancestor, Richard Francis, came from England in 1636 and settled in Cambridge, where his tombstone may be still seen in the burial ground. Her paternal grandfather, a weaver by trade, was in the Concord fight. Her father, Convers Francis, was a baker, first in West Cambridge, then in Medford, where he first introduced the article of food still known as \"Medford crackers.\" He was a man of strong character and great industry. Though without much cultivation he had an uncommon love of reading and his anti-slavery convictions were deeply rooted and must have influenced his child's later career. He married Susanah Rand, of whom it is only recorded that \"She had a simple, loving heart and a spirit busy in doing good.\" They had six children of whom Lydia Maria was the youngest. While her brother Convers was fitting for college she was his faithful companion, though more than six years younger. They read together and she was constantly bringing him Milton and Shakespeare to explain so that it may well be granted that the foundation of Miss Lydia's intellectual attainments was laid in this companionship. Apart from her brother's help the young girl had, as was then usual, a very subordinate share of educational opportunities, attending only the public schools with one year at the private seminary of Miss Swan, in Medford. In 1819 Convers Francis was ordained for the first parish, in Watertcwn, and there occurred in his city, in 1824, an incident which was to determine the whole life of his sister. Doctor G. G. Palfrey had written in the North American Review, for April, 1821, a \"Review\" of the now forgotten poem of \"Yamoyden,\" in which he ably pointed out the use that might be made of early American History for the purpose of fictitious writing. Miss Francis read this article at her ​ brother's house one summer Sunday morning. Before attending afternoon service she wrote the first chapter of a novel. It was soon finished and was published that year, then came \"Hobomak,\" a tale of early times.\n\nIn juding of this little book it is to be remembered that it marked the very dawn of American imaginative literature. Irving had printed only his \"Sketchbook\"; Cooper only \"Precaution.\" This new production was the hurried work of a young woman of nineteen, an Indian tale by one who had scarcely even seen an Indian. Accordingly \"Hobomak\" now seems very crude in execution, very improbable in plot and is redeemed only by a sincere attempt at local coloring.\n\nThe success of this first effort was, however, such as to encourage the publication of a second tale in the following year. This was \"The Rebels; The Boston before the Revolution, by the Author of Hobomak.\" It was a great advance on its predecessor, and can even be compared, favorably, with Cooper's Revolutionary novels.\n\nIn October, 1828, Miss Francis married David Lee Child, a lawyer of Boston. In that day it seemed to be held necessary for American women to work their passage into literature by first completing some kind of cookery book, so Mrs. Child published in 1829 her \"Frugal Housewife,\" a book which proved so popular that in 1855 it had reached its thirty-third edition.\n\nThe \"Biographies of Good Wives\" reached a fifth edition in the course of time as did her \"History of Woman,\" and in 1833 Mrs. Child was brought to one of those bold steps which made successive eras of her literary life—the publication of her \"Appeal for that Class of Americans called Africans.\" It was just at the most dangerous moment of the rising storm of the slavery question that Mrs. Child wrote this and it brought down upon her unending censure. It is evident that this result was not unexpected for the preface to the book explicitly recognizes the probable dissatisfaction of the public. She says, \"I am fully aware of the unpopularity of the task I have undertaken; but though I expect ridicule and censure, I cannot fear them. Should it be the means of advancing, even one single hour, the inevitable progress of truth and justice, I would not exchange the consciousness for all Rothschild's wealth or Sir Walter's fame.\" These words have in them a genuine ring; and the book is really worthy of them. The tone is calm and strong, the treatment systematic, the points well put, the statements well guarded.\n\nIt was the first anti-slavery work ever printed in America and it appears to be the ablest, covering the whole ground better than any other. During the next year she published the \"Oasis,\" also about this time appeared from her hand the \"Anti-slavery Catechism\" and a small book called \"Authentic Anecdotes of American Slavery.\"\n\nWhile seemingly absorbed in reformatory work she still kept an outlook in the direction of pure literature and was employed for several years on \"Philothea,\" which appeared in 1836. The scene of this novel was laid in Greece, and in spite of the unpopularity that Mrs. Child's slavery appeal had created it went through three editions.\n\nIn 1841 Mr. and Mrs. Child were engaged by the American Anti-Slavery Standard, a weekly newspaper published in New York. Mr. Child's health being ​ impaired his wife undertook the task alone and conducted the newspaper in that manner for two years, after which she aided her husband in the work, remaining there for eight years. She was a very successful editor. Her management proved efficient while her cultivated taste made the Standard pleasing to many who were not attracted by the plainer fare of the Liberator. During all this period she was a member of the family of the well-known Quaker philanthropist, Isaac T. Hopper, whose biographer she afterwards became. This must have been the most important and satisfactory time in Mrs. Child's whole life. She was placed where her sympathetic nature found abundant outlet and earnest co-operation. Here she also found an opportunity for her best eloquence in writing letters to the Distant Courier. This was the source of \"Letters from New York,\" that afterwards became famous. They were the precursors of that modern school of newspaper correspondence in which women now have so large a share, and which has something of the charm of women's private letters.\n\nHer last publication, and perhaps her favorite among the whole series, appeared in 1867—\"A Romance of the Republic.\" It was received with great cordiality and is in some respects her best fictitious work. In later life Mrs. Child left New York and took up her abode in Wayland, Massachusetts. She outlived her husband six years and died October 20, 1880.\n\nALMIRA LINCOLN PHELPS.\n\nThere were but two among all the early distinguished literary women of America who had the honor of being members of the American Association for the advancement of science, and these two women were Maria Mitchell and Almira Lincoln Phelps,—one from the North and one from the South. Mrs. Phelp's father, Samuel Harte, was a descendant of Thomas Hooker, the first minister of Hartford and founder of Connecticut. She was the youngest child and was born in Berlin, Connecticut, in 1793, educated at Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and later married to Simeon Lincoln, editor of the Connecticut Mirror, in Hartford. She was early left a widow with two children. Finding the estates of both her husband and father insolvent, she took up the study of Latin and Greek, the natural sciences, art of drawing and painting, in order to perfect herself for the work which she had in comtemplation, namely, the education of the young. She was a student under Miss Willard for seven years. In 1831, she married Honorable John Phelps, a distinguished lawyer and statesman of Vermont. In 1839 she accepted a position at the head of the female seminary at West Chester, Pennsylvania. In 1841 she and her husband established the Patapsco Female Institute of Maryland. Pupils came to them from all parts of the West and South. In 1849 she was again left a widow. In 1855 her daughter's death so saddened her that she resigned her position and removed to the city of Baltimore. Her best known works are: \"Lectures on Botany,\" \"Botany for Beginners,\" \"Lectures on Chemistry.\" \"Chemistry for Beginners,\" \"Lectures on Natural Philosophy,\" \"Philosophy for Beginners,\" \"Female Students,\" \"A Fireside Friend,\" \"A Juvenile Story,\" \"Geology for Beginners,\" \"Translation of the Works of Benedicte de Saussure,\" \"Progressive Education,\" with a mothers' journal by ​ Mrs. Willard and Mrs. Phelps, \"Ada Norman, or Trials and Their Uses,\" \"Hours with My Pupils,\" and \"Christian Households.\" She probably had as much to do with the education of the young of this country as any woman, her works having been largely used in the schools.\n\nSARAH BUELL (MRS. DAVID HALE).\n\nAuthor and magazine editor, was born in Newport, New Hampshire. When a young girl, the first regular novel she read was \"Mysteries of Udolpho,\" which, noting it was written by a woman, awakened in her an ardent desire to become an author herself. Her first work, however, was a small volume of fugitive poetry ; then \"Northward,\" in two volumes. Her first novel was issued in 1827. Afterwards she was given charge of the editorial department of the Lady's Magazine, then published in Boston. In 1837 the Lady's Magazine united with the Lady's Book, published by Godey, in Philadelphia, and in 1841 Mrs. Hill removed to that city editing the double magazine. She has written a large number of books. The most notable of these are \"Sketches of American Character,\" \"Traits of American Life,\" \"Flora's Interpreter,\" \"The Lady's Wreath,\" a selection from the familiar poets of England and America; \"The Way to Live Well and be Well While You Live,\" \"Grosvenor,\" \"Alice Ray,\" a romance in rhyme; \"Harry Guy,\" \"The Widow's Son,\" a story of the sea; \"Three Hours or Vigils of Love,\" and other poems, and, finally, \"Woman's Regret.\"\n\nLYDIA HUNTLY SIGOURNEY.\n\nBorn in Norwich, Connecticut, September 1, 1791, and died in Hartford, Connecticut, June 10, 1865; was the daughter of Ezekiel Huntly, a soldier of the Revolution. It is said that she wrote verses at the age of seven. She taught a private girls' school in Hartford for five years, and in 1815 published her first volume \"Moral Pieces in Prose and Verse.\" In 1819 she became the wife of Charles Sigourney, a gentleman of literary and artistic tastes, a resident of Hartford. After her marriage she devoted herself to literature. She wrote forty-six separate works, besides two thousand articles, which she contributed to about three hundred periodicals. She was a favorite poetess in England and France, as well as in her own country. Mrs. Sigourney was always an active worker in charity and philanthropy. Her best known works are \"Letters to Young Ladies,\" \"Pocahontas, and Other Poems,\" and \"Pleasant Memories of Pleasant Lands.\"\n\nLUCRETIA MARIA DAVIDSON.\n\nLucretia Maria Davidson was born in Plattsburg, New York, September 27, 1808, and was the daughter of Dr. Oliver Davidson, a lover of science. Her mother, Margaret Davidson, whose maiden name was Miller, came of a good family and had received the best education that times afforded at the school of the celebrated Scotch lady, Isabella Graham, in New York City. The family of Miss Davidson lived in seclusion. Their pleasures were intellectual. Her mother ​ suffered for years from ill health. Miss Davidson was delicate from infancy. When eighteen months old, she suffered from typhus fever which threatened her life. Her first literary acquisition indicated her after course. Her application to her studies at school was intense. Her early poems were of great merit. While devoting her time and attention to her invalid mother, she wrote many beautiful poems, the best known of which is her \"Amir Khan\" and a tale of some length called \"The Recluse of Saranac.\" \"Amir Khan\" has long been before the public. Its versification is graceful and the story of orientalism beautifully developed and well sustained; as a production of a girl of fifteen it is considered prodigious. Many of her poems are addressed to her mother. \"The Fear of Madness\" was written by her while confined to her bed and was the last piece she ever wrote. The records of the last scenes of Lucretia Davidson's life are scanty. Her poetical writings which have been collected amount in all to 278 pieces of various length. The following tribute paid her by Mr. Southey is from the London Quarterly Review, whose scant praise of American productions is well known. \"In these poems (\"Amir Khan,\" etc.) there is enough of originality, enough of aspiration, enough of conscientious energy, enough of growing power to warrant any expectations, however sanguine, which the patron and the friends and parents of the deceased could have formed.\" Her death occurred August 27, 1825, in Plattsburg, New York.\n\nJULIA WARD HOWE.\n\nFew women of America enjoy greater fame than Julia Ward Howe, the author of the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\" She can be classed as an essayist, poetess, philanthropist, and public speaker. She was born in New York City, May 27, 1819. Her parents were Samuel and Julia Cuttler Ward. She included among her ancestors some of the descendants of the Huguenots, the Marions of South Carolina, Governor Sam Ward of Rhode Island, and Roger Williams, the apostle of religious tolerance. Her father being a banker and a man of means gave her every advantage of education and accomplishment. In 1843 she married Dr. Samuel Gridley Howe, and they spent some time abroad. In 1852 she published her first volume of poems; in 1853 a drama in blank verse, and during the war other works and patriotic songs. In 1867 while she and her husband were visitors in Greece they won the affection and gratitude of the people by aiding them in their struggle for national independence. In 1868 she took an active part in the suffrage movement. She preached, wrote and lectured for many years. She died in the summer of 1910, but her fame will ever be linked with the \"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\"\n\nLOUISA M. ALCOTT.\n\nNo name is more beloved among the girls of America of former days and present times than that of Louisa May Alcott, the author of \"Little Women,\" a book dear to the heart of every American girl. Miss Alcott was born in Germantown, Pennsylvania, November 29, 1832. Her parents were charming, cultivated people. Her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, became a teacher. He taught in ​ Boston for eleven years, Margaret Fuller being one of his assistants. The atmosphere of the Alcott home was always one of culture and refinement, though their life was one of extreme simplicity. Whittier, Phillips, Garrison, Mrs. Hawthorne, Emerson, Thoreau and Oliver Wendell Holmes were frequent guests. Louisa was the eldest child, full of activity and enthusiasm, constantly in trouble from her frankness and lack of policy, but enjoying many friends from her generous heart, and it has not been difficult to recognize the picture of herself in the character of Joe in \"Little Women.\" In this little home in Concord were enacted many of the scenes, sports and amusements pictured in Miss Alcott's stories. At sixteen she began to teach school, having but twenty pupils, and to these she told many of the stories which were later woven into her books. Her restless disposition gave her many occupations; sometimes she acted as a governess, sometimes she did sewing, and again writing. At nineteen she published one of her early stories in Gleason's Pictorial. For this she received five dollars. Later appeared \"The Rival Prima Donna,\" and though she received but ten dollars for this, the request from the editor for another story was more to her than a larger check would have been. Another story appeared in the Saturday Evening Gazette. This was announced in the most sensational way by means of large yellow posters which spread terror to Miss Alcott's heart. Finding, however, that sensational stories paid, she turned them out at the rate of ten or twelve a month. But she soon tired of this unstable kind of fame, and she began work upon a novel which appeared under the name of \"Moods\" but was not a success. At this time the Civil War broke out. She offered herself as a nurse in the hospitals and was accepted, just after the defeat at Fredericksburg. After a time she became ill from overwork and was obliged to return home, and in 1865 published her hospital sketches, which made it possible for her to take a rest by a trip to Europe. Here she met many of the distinguished writers of her day. In 1868 her father submitted a collection of her stories to her publishers who declined them, and asked for a single story for girls, which was the occasion for the writing of \"Little Women.\" It was simply the story of herself and her three sisters and she became at once famous. Girls from all over the country wrote her. When \"Little Men\" was announced, fifty thousand copies were ordered in advance of its publication. Among her other stories are those entitled, \"Shawl Straps,\" \"Under the Lilacs,\" \"Aunt Jo's Scrap-Bag,\" \"Jack and Jill,\" and the greatest after \"Little Women,\" \"An Old-Fashioned Girl.\" Most of her stories were written in Boston and depict her life in Concord. Miss Alcott's devotion to her sex made her a strong supporter of the women's suffrage movement, no one has done more for the women of her own generation than she. The pleasure which her books have given, and will ever continue to give, make her one of the most beloved of our American literary women. Miss Alcott died in Boston, March 6, 1888.\n\nMARY VIRGINIA TERHUNE.\n\nMrs. Terhune is more familiar to the public under the pen name of \"Marion Harland.\" She was born December 21, 1831, in Amelia County, Vir​ ginia, her father Samuel P. Hawes, having removed there from Massachusetts. In 1856 she was married to Rev. E. P. Terhune, and since 1859 has lived in the North, but her stories have dealt largely with Southern life. She wrote her book \"The Story of Mary Washington\" to get funds to aid in the effort to erect a monument to the mother of Washington, which was unveiled on May 10, 1894. She has been a most industrious writer. Among her works are \"Alone,\" \"Nemesis,\" \"The Hidden Path,\" \"Miriam,\" \"Husks,\" \"Husbands and Home,\" \"Sunnybank,\" \"Helen Gardner's Wedding Day,\" \"At Last,\" \"The Empty Heart,\" \"Common Sense in the Household.\" Her novel \"Sunnybank\" was very severely criticised by Southern editors, when it appeared soon after the Civil War. Mrs. Terhune's younger brothers were in the Confederate Army.\n\nMrs. Terhune has three children, with all of whom she has collaborated in literary work.\n\nELIZABETH STUART PHELPS WARD.\n\nMrs. Ward was born in Andover, Massachusetts, August 31, 1844, and inherited literary talent from both of her parents. Her mother was the writer of a number of stories for children, and her father, Rev. Austin Phelps, a professor of sacred rhetoric in the Theological Seminary of Andover, was the writer of many lectures which in book form have become classics and to-day are accepted text-books. At the age of thirteen Mrs. Ward made her first literary venture in a story which was accepted by the Youths' Companion. Her first novel, \"Gates Ajar,\" 1869, met with unprecedented success. In 1888, she married Rev. Herbert D. Ward, and with him has written several novels, the most important of which are, \"The Last of the Magicans,\" \"Come Forth,\" \"A Singular Life,\" and what she regards as her most important work, \"The Story of Jesus Christ,\" which appeared in 1897. Some of Mrs. Ward's books are, \"Ellen's Idol,\" \"Up Hill,\" \"A Singular Life,\" \"The Gipsy Series,\" \"Mercy Glidden's Works,\" \"I Don't Know How,\" \"Men, Women and Ghosts,\" \"The Silent Partner,\" \"Walled In,\" \"The Story of Avis,\" \"My Cousin and I,\" \"The Madonna of the Tubs,\" \"Sealed Waters,\" \"Jack, the Fisherman,\" \"The Master of Magicians,\" and many sketches, stories and poems for magazines.\n\nFRANCES HODGSON BURNETT.\n\nWas born in Manchester, England, November 24, 1849. Her father was a well-to-do merchant. He died when she was but ten years old. Soon after his death the family removed to Tennessee to reside with an uncle. They settled in Knoxville, but her uncle having lost everything by the war, they made their home in the country and experienced the greatest poverty. Her mother's health failed under these trying conditions, and she died about two years after. Frances Hodgson obtained a position as school teacher, receiving her pay in flour, bacon, eggs and potatoes. She had early shown much talent in story writing, and at thirteen she wrote quite a creditable story, which her sister insisted on sending to a publisher. The only difficulty in the way of accomplishing this was how to procure the necessary postage, and a basket of wild grapes was sold by these ​\n\nDISTINGUISHED WOMEN POETS.\n\n​ two girls to pay for the mailing of the manuscript to Ballon's Magazine. As the publisher did not wish to pay for the printing of the story, which he had complimented in his letter to Frances, it was returned and sent to Godey's Ladies' Book, and from this source she received her first remuneration. Later she became a regular contributor to Peterson's Magazine and the publication of \"Mrs. Carruther's Engagement\" and another story entitled \"Hearts and Diamonds\" fixed the author's vocation. In 1873, she married Swan Moses Burnett. They had two children, the heroes of \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" Mrs. Burnett's most famous story. The one named Lionel died in Paris, Vivian was the little Lord Fauntleroy of her story. \"That Lass o' Lowrie's,\" \"Pretty Polly Pemberton,\" \"The Fair at Grantley Mills,\" \"A Fair Barbarian\" and \"A Lady of Quality,\" are some of Mrs. Burnett's novels. Among her plays are : \"Little Lord Fauntleroy,\" \"The First Gentleman of Europe\" and \"A Lady of Quality.\" Her work has brought to Mrs. Burnett quite a handsome fortune. She now makes her home in England.\n\nSARAH ORNE JEWETT.\n\nWas born in South Berwick, Maine, on September 3, 1849. Her father was Dr. Theodore Herman Jewett, a physician, and her mother was the daughter of Dr. Perry of Exeter, also a prominent physician of that section of New England. Most of the characters and life of the people in her story have been taken from the simple New England life about the little village of Berwick. She frequently went about with her father on his errands of mercy and through these was enabled to gain much data for her stories. Her father was the hero of \"A Country Doctor\" from her pen. She first wrote short stories for the Atlantic Monthly, and it is said was but fourteen years of age when she wrote \"Lucy Garron's Lovers.\" Her first great success was \"Deephaven\" which appeared in 1877. Lowell and Whittier were among her friends and admirers as a writer. Whittier attended the Friends' meeting in Berwick, and it was here Miss Jewett met him. The old sea-faring life of these New England towns has been preserved to us by Miss Jewett. Her grandfather was a sea captain, and in his home she met and enjoyed the companionship and heard the tales of this old sea captain's friends. Miss Jewett died in 1909.\n\nMRS. BURTON HARRISON.\n\nWas before her marriage Constance Cary, of Virginia, and on her father's side she is descended from Colonel Miles Carey of Devonshire, England, who emigrated to America and settled in Virginia about the middle of the seventeenth century, and during the rule of Sir William Berkeley was one of the king's council. Her father, Archibald Cary, of Cary's Brook, Virginia, was the son of Virginia Randolph, who was the ward and pupil of Thomas Jefferson and sister of his son-in-law, Thomas Mann Randolph. Her mother was the youngest daughter of Thomas Fairfax, Baron of Cameron, who resided upon a large plantation in Fairfax, Virginia. It is said Mrs. Harrison inherits her ​ literary taste from her grandmother on her father's side, Mrs. Wilson Jefferson Cary, who was herself a writer, and whose father's writings exerted quite an influence over Thomas Jefferson. Mrs. Harrison's first story was written when she was but seventeen years of age. The Civil War brought an end to her literary aspirations and the loss of her home necessitated her mother and herself living abroad for some years. After her return to this country she married Burton Harrison, a prominent member of the New York Bar. Charles A. Dana was a great friend of Mrs. Harrison and gave her the agreeable task of editing \"Monticello Letters,\" and from this she gleaned the matter which was the basis of her story, \"The Old Dominion.\" Some of the stories that she has written are : \"Helen of Troy,\" \"The Old-Fashioned Fairy Book,\" \"Short Comedies for American Players,\" a translation; \"The Anglomaniacs,\" \"Flower-de-Hundred,\" \"Sweet Bells Out of Tune,\" \"A Bachelor Maid,\" \"An Errant Wooing,\" \"A Princess of the Hills,\" \"A Daughter of the South.\" Mrs. Harrison resides in New York, and is still busy with her pen.\n\nMARY N. MURFREE.\n\n\"Charles Egbert Craddock.\"\n\nFor several years of her early literary life both publishers and public were in ignorance of the fact that she was a woman. She was born at Grantsland, near Murfreesborough, Tennessee, in 1850, at the family home, which had been inherited from her great-grandfather, Colonel Hardy Murfree, a soldier of the Revolution, who, in 1807, had moved from his native state of North Carolina to the new state of Tennessee. Miss Murfree's father, William Law Murfree, was a lawyer, and her mother, Priscilla Murfree, was the daughter of Judge Dickinson. The family suffered greatly from the effects of the war. Mary Murfree had poor health but began to write of the people she found about her in the Tennessee mountains, and her novel, \"In the Tennessee Mountains\" appeared in the Atlantic Monthly and was supposed to have been written by a man. When Mr. Howells assumed the editorial chair in the Atlantic Monthly office he requested further contributions from Charles Egbert Craddock, and a series of excellent stories from her pen were published: \"Where the Battle was Fought,\" \"The Prophet of the Great Stony Mountain,\" \"The Star in the Valley,\" \"The Romance of Sunrise Rock,\" \"Over on Tother Mounting,\" \"Electioneering on Big Injun Mounting,\" \"A-Playing of Old Sledge at Settlement,\" \"Adnfting down Lost Creek,\"vhich ran through three numbers of the Atlantic, \"Down the Ravine,\" a story for young people. It was possible for Miss Murfree to cover her identity in her nom de plume, for her style of writing and even her penmanship were masculine and she appreciated the fact that, at that time, men in the literary world had a great advantage over women writers. No one was more surprised than her own publishers at the discovery that Charles Egbert Craddock was a woman. Her great skill lies in vitalizing the picturesque characters who are the subjects of her stories. ​\n\nANNA KATHARINE GREEN ROHLFS.\n\nWas born in Brooklyn, New York, on November II, 1846, and was thirty-two years of age when her famous story, \"The Leavenworth Case\" was published. Her father was a famous lawyer, and from him she is supposed to have gained the knowledge which she had in handling the details of this story. It was questioned for some time, although her maiden name, Anna Katharine Green, was signed to the story, whether it was possible that this story could have been written by a woman. She was a graduate of the Ripley Female College in Poultney, Vermont, and received the degree of B.A. In her early days she wrote poems, but her fame has come from her detective stories. \"The Affair Next Door,\" \"The Filigree Ball,\" and other stories from her pen are well known. In November, 1884, she became Mrs. Charles Rohlfs.\n\nMOLLY ELLIOT SEAWELL.\n\nMiss Seawell's uncle was an officer in the United States navy before the Civil War, and served in the Confederate Army with distinction during the entire war. From him she heard the tales of our early navy which gave her inspiration to write her nautical sketches. Some of these are \"Decatur and Somers,\" \"Paul Jones,\" \"Midshipman Paulding,\" \"Quarter-deck,\" \"Fo'c'sle,\" and \"Little Jarvis,\" the latter winning the prize of five hundred dollars for the best story for boys offered by the Youths' Companion, in 1890. She was a constant reader of Shakespeare, Rousseau and other writers. Byron, Shelley, Thackeray, Macaulay, Jane Austen, Boswell's \"Johnson\" all formed a part of her home education. In 1895, she received a prize of $3,000 from the New York Herald for the best novelette, \"The Sprightly Romance of Marsac.\" Her \"Maid Marian\" is a well-known and an amusing story of the Knickerbocker element of New York.\n\nAMELIA E. BARR.\n\nAmong the foremost of American writers is Amelia Barr. She was born in Ulverston, Lancashire, England, in 183 1. Her maiden name was Amelia Edith Huddleston. Her father was the Reverend Doctor William Henry Huddleston, and her first introduction into the literary field was when she served as a reader to her father. She was educated in Glasgow and in 1850 married Robert Barr, a Scotchman, and four years later they came to this country. They made their residence in several states, in New York, the South and West, finally settling in Austin, Texas. In 1867, the yellow fever was epidemic in Austin. Mr. Barr became famous through his work among the Indians and white settlers of this city. Doctors and nurses dying on all sides, he gave up his life in his unselfish devotion to poor suffering humanity. Mrs. Barr lost not only her husband but three sons in this terrible epidemic, and after it was over she returned to New York City. Her first literary venture was brought out through the kind personal interest of the editor of the New York Ledger, Mr. Robert Bonner, and was a story published in the Christian Union. She did all kinds of literary work, wrote ​ advertisements, circulars, paragraphs and verses. Her first great success came in 1885 in the publication of \"Jan Vedder's Wife.\" Three other books followed: \"Scottish Sketches,\" \"Cluny MacPherson,\" and \"Pawl and Christina,\" but none equalled \"Jan Vedder's Wife.\" \"The Bow of Orange Ribbon\" is a delightful picture of New York in provincial days, as is \"The Maid of Maiden Lane.\" One of her later books, \"The Lion's Whelp,\" a story of Cromwell's time, is considered one of her strongest books.\n\nMARY E. WILKINS FREEMAN.\n\nWas born in Randolph, Massachusetts, in 1862. Her father was a native of Salem, and was a descendant of Bray Wilkins of good old Puritan stock. Her mother was a Holbrook, one of the old families of Massachusetts. The family early removed to Brattleboro, Vermont, and with Mr. J. E. Chamberland she wrote \"The Long Arm\" for which they received a two thousand dollar prize offered by a newspaper. Like many other writers she was largely influenced by the people about her and associated with her early life and that of her family. Barnabas, one of the characters in her story, \"Pembroke,\" was drawn from Randolph. Losing her father and mother and sister, she returned to Randolph and took up her residence. Her story \"A Humble Romance\" was considered by Phillips Brooks the best short story ever written. In 1893, she wrote a play, \"Giles Corey, Yeoman\" a drama of the early Puritan days. \"The Heart's Highway\" is another of her stories of Colonial times, and \"The Portion of Labor.\" In 1902 she married Dr. Charles Manning Freeman, of Metuchen, New Jersey, where she now resides.\n\nALICE FRENCH.\n\n\"Octave Thanet.\"\n\nMiss French took a nom de plume to hide her identity, there being an unmistakably masculine tinge in many of her writings. Her real name is Alice French, she was born in Andover, Massachusetts, March 19, 1850. Her father was George Henry French, a man of important business connections and comfortable means. The family were descended from Sir William French who settled in Massachusetts in the seventeenth century, and one of his descendants took part in the Revolutionary War, receiving the name of the \"Fighting Parson of Andover.\" Miss French's grandfather on her mother's side was Governor Marcus Morton, and some of her ancestors were numbered among those who came to this country in the Mayflower. Miss French is a graduate of Vassar College. Her first story was printed in Godey's Magazine. Her story entitled \"The Bishop's Vagabond,\" published in the Atlantic Monthly, in 1884, was the beginning of her substantial literary fame. Her story \"Expiation\" is considered very strong, as is \"Knitters in the Sun \"\n\nKATE DOUGLASS WIGGIN (MRS. RIGGS.)\n\nHer family were people of prominence in church and politics and at the New England Bar. She was born in Philadelphia and educated in New England, ​ transplanted to California, and returned again to the Atlantic coast. Her first article appeared in St. Nicholas and was written at the age of eighteen. This she wrote while studying kindergarten work under the celebrated Marshall in California. After the death of her stepfather, she taught in the Santa Barbara College and organized the first free kindergarten west of the Rocky Mountains. Soon after the successful establishment of this work, she was married to Mr. Samuel Bradley Wiggin, a talented young lawyer. She gave up her work in the kindergarten but continued to give lectures. One of the stories written at this time was the story of \"Patsy,\" which she wrote to obtain money for the work in which was so much interested, to be followed by \"The Birds' Christmas Carol,\" written for the same purpose. After removing to New York, in 1888, she was urged to offer these two books to an eastern publisher, and Houghton, Mifflin and Company reprinted them in book form, and they met with remarkable success. \"The Birds' Christmas Carol\" has been translated into Japanese, French, German and Swedish, even being put into raised type for the blind. Her story \"Timothy's Quest\" met with great success as also \"Polly Oliver's Problem.\" Mr. Wiggin's death soon after they left San Francisco necessitated her taking up the kindergarten work in the East with great energy. She does much of her work at her old home in Maine, and many of the scenes and descriptions in the \"Village Watch Tower\" were taken from this neighborhood. In 1895 she married Mr. George Christopher Riggs, and has spent much of her time since then in England. \"Penelope's English Experience\" is a story of her own experiences among her English friends, as were those of \"Penelope's Irish Experiences,\" \"Penelope's Progress in Scotland\" which followed a period of her life in these countries.\n\nGERTRUDE ATHERTON.\n\nWas born in Rincon Hill, a part of San Francisco, in 1857. Her mother was the daughter of Stephen Franklin, a descendant of one of the brothers of Benjamin Franklin. His daughter was quite famous in California as a beauty. She married Thomas L. Horn, a prominent citizen of San Francisco from Stonington, Connecticut, and a member of the famous Vigilant Committee. The daughter Gertrude was educated in California and married George Henry Bowen Atherton of Menlo Park, California, a Chilian by birth. Her first story, \"The Randolphs of Redwoods,\" was published in the San Francisco Argonaut, but among her many stories perhaps the best known is \"Senator North.\" Her story of the life of Alexander Hamilton under the title \"The Conqueror\" is considered her best work.\n\nJOHN OLIVER HOBBES (MRS. CRAIGIE.)\n\nMrs. Pearl Mary Theresa Craigie was born in Boston, Massachusetts, November 3, 1867. Her mother's maiden name was Laura Hortense Arnold. Her father was John Morgan Richards, the son of Reverend Doctor James Richards, the founder of Auburn Theological Seminary, of New York. She received her early education from tutors, later studying in Paris, and then in London. She was an enthusiastic student of classical literature, and through the advice of Professor ​ Goodwin, she took up literature as a profession. In 1887, she was married to Mr. Reginald Walpole Craigie of a well-to-do English family. \"Rohert of Orange\" was one of her early and most notable books. Mrs. Craigie did some writing for the stage and one of her plays, \"The Ambassador,\" was considered very good. Her story \"Love and Soul Hunters,\" has not been excelled by any of her contemporaries.\n\nLILIAN BELL.\n\nWas born in Chicago in 1867, but spent her early years in Atlanta. Daughter of Major William Bell, an officer of the Civil War. Her grandfather, General Joseph Warren Bell, was a Southerner, but sold and freed his slaves before the war, brought his family North to Illinois. He organized the Thirteenth Illinois Cavalry. Her first literary work was \"The Expatriates.\" Probably her best known book is \"The Love Affairs of an Old Maid.\" In 1893 she married Arthur Hoyt Bogue of Chicago. They now make their home in New York City, where Mrs. Bogue is still engaged in literary work under her maiden name.\n\nRUTH McENERY STUART.\n\nMrs. Stuart was born at Avoyelles Parish, Louisiana, the daughter of a wealthy planter. Her family had always been slave holders and her life was spent on a plantation where she gained her familiarity and knowledge of the negro character. She was educated at a school in New Orleans where she remained after her marriage in 1879 to Alfred O. Stuart, a cotton planter, and her early life was spent near their plantation in a small Arkansas town. Her first story was sent by Charles Dudley Warner to the Princeton Review in which it appeared, and the second was published in Harper's Magazine. Her stories are of the la-ry life of the Creoles and the plantation negroes. They give a true picture of a peculiar race of people fast disappearing in the South. They are largely dialect stories. Since her husband's death Mrs. Stuart has resided in New York City and here most of her literary work has been done. \"Moriah's Mourning,\" \"In Simpkinsville,\" \"A Golden Wedding.\" \"Charlotta's Intended,\" \"Solomon Crow's Christmas Box,\" \"The Story of Babette,\" \"Sonny,\" \"Uncle Eph's Advice to Brer Rabbit,\" \"Holly and Pizen,\" are some of her well-known stories. Charles Dudley Warner says, \"her pictures of Louisiana life both white and colored are indeed the best we have.\"\n\nANNA FARQUHAR BERGENGREN.\n\nMrs. Bergengren was of Scotch-English ancestry, her people coming to America in Lord Baltimore's time and settling in Maryland, near Baltimore. She was born December 23, 1865, near Brookville, Indiana, her father being a lawyer, a member of Congress, and during her life in Washington, she obtained the material for her book called \"Her Washington Experiences.\" Her father's death made her determine upon a career for herself and she chose a musical education, but her health failed while studying in Boston, and she was ultimately ​ obliged to give up singing, in which she had already attained fair success. Her story \"The Singer's Heart\" expressed her professional ambitions. \"The Professor's Daughter\" was published in The Saturday Evening Post and was very popular. \"Her Boston Experiences\" appeared in a magazine and ultimately in book form. Her book, \"The Devil's Plough,\" is a story of the early French missionaries of North America. In January, 1900, she was married to Ralph Bergengren, a Boston Journalist, and has continued her literary labors.\n\nPAULINE BRADFORD MACKIE HOPKINS.\n\nMrs. Hopkins is a writer of historical fiction. For two years after her graduation from the Toledo High School she was engaged as a writer on the Toledo Blade. She soon abandoned this for a literary career, and most of her stories have appeared in magazines and newspapers. \"Mademoiselle de Berny\" and \"Ye Lyttle Salem Maide\" were, after most trying experiences with publishers, printed in book form. \"A Georgian Actress\" was written in Berkeley, California, where Mrs. Hopkins had gone with her husband, Dr. Herbert Müller Hopkins, now occupying the chair of Latin in Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut. Here she also wrote two novels of Washington life during the Civil War. Mrs. Hopkins was born in Connecticut in 1873. Her father, Rev. Andrew Mackie, was an Episcopal clergyman and a very scholarly man, from whom she inherited her literary talent.\n\nMARY JOHNSTON.\n\nThe publication of \"Prisoners of Hope\" brought, in 1898, a new star into the literary firmament, and instantly made Mary Johnston's name famous. At the time of the publication of her first novel Miss Johnston was but twenty-eight years of age. She was born in Buchanan, Virginia, November 21, 1870. Her great-great-great-grandfather, Peter Johnston, came to Virginia early in the Eighteenth Century and was a man of wealth and influence. He donated the land on which the Hampden Sidney College now stands, and Peter, his eldest son, rode in \"light-horse,\" Harry Lee's legion and was the father of General Joseph E. Johnston. Her family numbered among its members some of the most distinguished men of the early Virginia history. \"Prisoners of Hope\" was hardly more famous than her second book, \"To Have and To Hold.\" The latter established a record of sales among books unprecedented for any work by an American woman. Her latest novel is \"The Long Roll,\" a story of the Confederacy during the war.\n\nELLEN ANDERSON G. GLASGOW.\n\nMiss Glasgow is a Virginia writer who has become a member of the literary life of the New South. \"The Descendant,\" \"The Phases of an Inferior Planet\" and \"The Voice of the People\" are among her best works. She was born in Richmond, Virginia, April 22, 1874, and lived the greater part of her life at the family home. Her father was a lawyer, and the majority of her male ancestors were either lawyers, judges or men of literary tastes and talents.\n\n​\n\nBERTHA RUNKLE.\n\nOne of the most famous novels of the past few years was \"The Helmet of Navarre,\" and was written, when its author, Bertha Runkle, was a little over twenty years of age. One of the most remarkable facts in this connection is that the authoress had never seen the shores of France, in fact had seldom been beyond the boundaries of New York State. Miss Runkle was born in New Jersey, but in 1888 she and her mother moved to New York City. Her father, Cornelius A. Runkle, a well-known New York lawyer, was for many years counsel for the New York Tribune, and her mother, Lucia Isabella Runkle, had been, previous to her marriage, an editorial writer on the same paper, in fact she was the first American woman to be placed on the staff of a great Metropolitan daily. In 1904 Miss Runkle married Captain Louis H. Bash, United States Army. She is very fond of outdoor life and spends much of her time in such sports as golf, riding, driving and tennis.\n\nHARRIET BEECHER STOWE.\n\nIn the little town of Litchfield, Connecticut, on June 14, 1811, one of the most famous literary women, Harriet Beecher Stowe, was born. She was the seventh child of her parents Rev. Lyman Beecher and Roxanna Beecher. Her father was an eminent divine, but her early childhood days were filled with the privations of great poverty. When Harriet Stowe was but five years of age, her mother died and she went to live for a short time with her aunt and grandmother, until Mr. Beecher's second marriage. At twelve years of age she was sent to the school of Mr. John P. Brace, a well-known teacher, where she soon began to show a great love for composition, and one of her essays, \"Can the Immortality of the Soul be Proved by the Light of Nature,\" was considered quite a literary triumph, and won great admiration from her father who was ignorant of its authorship. Her sister Catherine went to Hartford, Connecticut, where her brother was teaching, and decided she would build a female seminary that women might have equal opportunities with men. She raised the money and built the Hartford Female Seminary, and Harriet Beecher at the age of twelve attended her sister Catherine's school. She soon became one of the pupil teachers. Mr. Beecher's fame as a revivalist and brilliant preacher took him to Boston, but his heart was in the temperance work and he longed to go West. When called to Ohio to become president of Lane Theological Seminary at Cincinnati he accepted, and perhaps we owe to this circumstance Harriet Beecher Stowe's famous book \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" In 1836, Harriet married the Professor of Biblical Criticism and Oriental Literature in that seminary, Calvin E. Stowe. At this time the question of slavery was uppermost in the minds of Christian people. In 1850 the Beecher family and the Stowes moved to Brunswick, Maine, where Mr. Stowe had accepted a professorship at Bowdoin College. The fugitive slave law was in operation and the people of the North seemed lacking in effort. Mrs. Stowe felt she must do something to arouse the people on this question, and we are told that one Sunday while sitting in church the ​ picture of Uncle Tom came to her mind. When she went home she wrote the chapter on his death and read it to her two sons, ten and twelve years of age. This so affected them that they burst into tears. After two or three more chapters were ready she wrote to Dr. Bailey, her old friend of Cincinnati days, who had removed his press to Washington and was editing the National Era in that city. He accepted her manuscript and it was published as a serial. Mr. Jewett of Boston feared to undertake the work in book form, thinking it too long to be popular, but Uncle Tom's Cabin was published March 20, 1852, as a book. In less than a year over three hundred thousand copies had been sold. Congratulations came from crown heads and the literary world. In 1853, when Professor Stowe and his wife visited England no crowned head was shown greater honor. Other books followed from her pen on her return to America, her husband having taken a position as Professor of Sacred Literature in the Theological Seminary at Andover, Massachusetts. Her other works are: \"Sunny Memories of Foreign Lands,\" \"Dread,\" an anti-slavery story; \"The Minister's Wooing,\" \"Agnes of Sorrento,\" an Italian story; \"Pearl of Orr's Island,\" a New England coast tale; \"Old Town Folks,\" \"House and Home Papers,\" \"My Wife and I,\" \"Pink and White Tyranny,\" but none has added to the fame of her great work, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\" This book has been translated into almost all the languages. The latter years of Mrs. Stowe's life was spent between her home among the orange groves of Florida, and her summer residence in Hartford, Connecticut. On her seventy-first birthday her publishers, Houghton Mifflin & Company, gave her a monster garden party in Newton, Massachusetts, at the home of Governor Claflin. Poets, artists, statesmen, and our country's greatest men and women came to do her honor, and when her life went out at Hartford, Connecticut, July 1, 1896, we lost one of the famous women of America.\n\nHELEN HUNT JACKSON.\n\nShe was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, October 18, 1831. Her father, Nathan W. Fiske, was a professor of languages and philosophy in the college of that town. When twelve years of age both her father and mother died, leaving her to the care of her grandfather. She entered the school of Rev. J. S. C. Abbott of New York. At twenty-one she married a young army officer, Captain, afterward Major, Edward B. Hunt. They lived much of their time at West Point and Newport. Major Hunt was killed in Brooklyn, October 2, 1863, while experimenting with a submarine gun of his own invention. After a year abroad and a long illness in Rome, she returned to this country in 1870. In her first small book of verses she was obliged to pay for the plates when they appeared, and it was only after years of hard work that she succeeded in her literary career. Her health becoming somewhat impaired, she moved to Colorado, and here in 1876 she married Mr. William Sharpless Jackson, a banker and cultured gentleman. They made their home at Colorado Springs, and it became one of the attractions of the place, her great love for flowers beautifying her surroundings. Here she wrote her first novels, \"Mercy Philbrick's Choice\" and \"Hetty's Strange History,\" also, later \"Ramona,\" but her strongest work was brought ​about through her intense interest and indignation over the wrongs of the Indians inflicted upon them by the white race. She advocated education and christianization of the race rather than their extermination. Leaving home, she spent three months in New York in the Astor Library gathering facts and material for her \"Century of Dishonor.\" When published she sent a copy to each member of Congress at her own expense to awaken interest in her favorite theme, and this resulted in her being appointed special commissioner with Abbott Kinney, her friend, to examine and report on the condition of the Indians in California. She went into the work with enthusiasm and energy and the report was most exhaustive and convincing. In the winter of 1883, she began to write her famous novel, \"Ramona,\" and we quote her own language when she says of it \"I put my heart and soul into it.\" The book enjoyed wonderful popularity not only in this country but in England. In June, 1884, a fall caused a long, severe and painful illness. She was taken to Los Angeles, for the winter, but a slow malarial fever followed and she was removed to San Francisco and on the evening of August 12, 1885, she died. Her two works \"Ramona,\" and \"The Century of Dishonor\" will ever preserve her name among the famous literary women of America. \"The Century of Dishonor,\" has placed her name among the up-builders of our nation. She was buried near the summit of Cheyenne Mountain, four miles from Colorado Springs, a spot of her own choosing, and which is to-day one of the shrines of America.\n\nTHE CARY SISTERS.\n\nThe Cary sisters stand out as the most prominent poetical writers of the state of Ohio. Alice Cary was born April 26, 1820, on the farm of her father, situated within the present limits of Mount Healthy, Ohio. In 1832, the family moved to a larger residence near their former home, and it was christened \"Clover Nook.\" Alice Cary had only the advantages of ordinary school education, but began early in life to contribute literary compositions, and at the age of eighteen, her first poetical adventure, \"The Child of Sorrow,\" to the Sentinel and Star, a universalist paper of Cincinnati. Gradually her reputation spread and she contributed to many papers, among them, the National Mirror of Washington, D. C, the editor of which, Dr. Bailey, was the first to consider her writings worthy of pecuniary reward. In 1848, her name appeared first among the female poets of America, and in 1850, a small collection of poems by Alice and Phoebe Cary made their first appearance. Horace Greeley and John G. Whittier were among the warm friends and literary admirers of the Cary sisters. In 1860, Alice moved to New York City, and on February 12, 1870, she died.\n\nPHOEBE CARY.\n\nWas born September 4, 1824, in the old homestead at Clover Nook, Hamilton County, Ohio. Her writings were noted for their sincerity and sweetness. Her gifts were hardly inferior to those of her sister, Alice, whom she outlived but one year and a half, dying July 31, 1871.\n\n​\n\nALICE WILLIAMS BROTHERTON.\n\nDaughter of Alfred Baldwin Williams and Ruth Hoge Johnson Williams, was born at Cambridge, Indiana, her parents removing to Cincinnati, Ohio, when she was quite young. Her education was received mainly from the grammar and high schools of Cincinnati. She was married October 18, 1876, to Mr. William Ernest Brotherton of that city. She has been a constant contributor to newspapers and magazines, a prominent college woman, and has devoted much time to essays and writings on Shakespeare, delivering lectures before women's colleges and dramatic schools.\n\nEDITH MATILDA THOMAS.\n\nWas born in Chatham, Ohio, August 12, 1854. Daughter of Frederick J. Thomas and Jane Louisa Sturges Thomas, both natives of New England, her great-grandfather being a soldier in the Revolutionary War. The family lived for a short time at Kenton, Ohio, and also at Bowling Green, where her father died in 1861. Soon after this, her mother and sisters moved to Geneva, Ohio, where Edith received her education at the Normal Institute. She taught for a short time in Geneva, but soon decided to make literature her profession. She had, while a student, contributed to the newspapers, and her first admirer was Helen Hunt Jackson, who brought her to the attention of the editors of the Atlantic Monthly and Century. In 1888, Miss Thomas moved to New York City, making her home on Staten Island, and has devoted her entire time to literature, being a frequent contributor to the prominent magazines of the day.\n\nALICE ARCHER SEWALL JAMES.\n\nDaughter of Frank Sewall, an eminent Swedenborgian divine, and Thedia Redelia Gilchrist Sewall, and was born at Glendale, Ohio, in 1870, where her father was in charge of a church. The family removed to Urbana, Ohio, that year, and Doctor Sewall became president of Urbana University. Here Alice received her early education. At sixteen, she studied in the art schools of Glasgow, Scotland, traveling later on the Continent. In 1899, her home was in Washington, D. C, and here she met Mr. John H. James, a prominent attorney of Urbana, Ohio, whom she married. As an artist, Mrs. James' work has received much favorable comment and honors from the New York Architectural League, the Philadelphia Academy of Art, the Chicago World's Fair, the Expositions of Atlanta and Nashville, and at the Salon, Paris. Her illustrative work is of a high order, and she has contributed designs to the Century Magazine, Harper's Monthly, and the Cosmopolitan. She is hardly less noted as a poet than as a painter, and has published several volumes of verses. She was the authoress of the \"Centennial Ode\" of Champagne County, Ohio.\n\nMARGARET JUNKIN PRESTON.\n\nDaughter of Rev.
