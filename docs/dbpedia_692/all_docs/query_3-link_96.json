Used all together, these tools become a marvelous medicine for healing whatever holds our creativity back. This class is for anyone who is yearning for a more creative life — “declared” artist or not. During this evening expect to learn these primary tools which will launch us into creative renewal which we so often reach for but rarely attain.\n\nNote: This program will now be offered online. It will be recorded and shared with registrants after each online program for three months (90 days).\n\nHailed by the New York Times as “The Queen of Change,” Julia Cameron is credited with starting a movement in 1992 that has brought creativity into the mainstream conversation—in the arts, in business and in everyday life."
