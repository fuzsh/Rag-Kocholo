Almost the most prodigious asset of a country, and perhaps its most precious possession, is its native literary product-when that product is fine and noble and endur¬ ing.\n\nplacement and treatment of authors who might properly be included in two or three volumes. In some instances a major figure will be included in separate volumes, but with different entries empha¬ sizing the aspect of his career appropriate to each volume. Ernest Hemingway, for example, is repre¬ sented in American Writers in Paris, 1920-1939 by an entry focusing on his expatriate apprenticeship; he is also in American Novelists, 1910-1943 with an entry surveying his entire career. Each volume includes a cumulative index of subject authors. The final DLB volume will be a comprehensive index to the entire series.\n\nMark Twain*\n\nThe advisory board, the editors, and the pub¬ lisher of the Dictionary of Literary Biography are joined in endorsing Mark Twain’s declaration. The literature of a nation provides an inexhaustible re¬ source of permanent worth. It is our expectation that this endeavor will make literature and its creators better understood and more accessible to students and the literate public, while satisfying the standards of teachers and scholars.\n\nWith volume ten in 1982 it was decided to enlarge the scope ol DLB beyond the literature of the United States. By the end of 1983 twelve vol¬ umes treating British literature had been pub¬ lished, and volumes for Commonwealth and Mod¬ ern European literature were in progress. The series has been further augmented by the DLB Year¬ books (since 1981) which update published entries and add new entries to keep the DLB current with contemporary activity. There have also been occa¬ sional DLB Documentary Series volumes which pro¬ vide biographical and critical background source materials for figures whose work is judged to have particular interest for students. One of these com¬ panion volumes is entirely devoted to Tennessee Williams.\n\nTo meet these requirements, literary biography has been construed in terms of the author’s achieve¬ ment. The most important thing about a writer is his writing. Accordingly, the entries in DIB are career biographies, tracing the development of the author s canon and the evolution of his reputation. The publication plan for DLB resulted from two years of preparation. The project was proposed to Bruccoli Clark by Frederick G. Ruffner, presi¬ dent of the Gale Research Company, in November 1975. After specimen entries were prepared and typeset, an advisory board was formed to refine the entry format and develop the series rationale. In meetings held during 1976, the publishe r, series editors, and advisory board approved the scheme for a comprehensive biographical dictionary of per¬ sons who contributed to North American literature. Editorial work on the first volume began in January 1977, and it was published in 1978. In order to make DLB more than a reference tool and to compile volumes that individually have claim to status as literary history, it was decided to organize volumes by topic or period or genre. Each of these freestanding volumes provides a bio¬ graphical-bibliographical guide and overview for a particular area of literature. We are convinced that this organization — as opposed to a single alphabet method—constitutes a valuable innovation in the presentation of reference material. The volume plan necessarily requires many decisions for the\n\nThe purpose of DLB is not only to provide reliable information in a convenient format but also to place the figures in the larger perspective of literary history and to offer appraisals of their accomplishments by qualified scholars. We define literature as the intellectual commerce of a nation-, not merely as belles lettres, but as that ample and complex process by which ideas are generated, shaped, and transmitted. DLB entries are not limited to “creative writers” but extend to other figures who in this time and in this way influ¬ enced the mind of a people. Thus the series en¬ compasses historians, journalists, publishers, and screenwriters. By this means readers of DLB may be aided to perceive literature not as cult scripture in the keeping of cultural high priests, but as at the center of a nation’s life. DLB includes the major writers appropriate to each volume and those standing in the ranks im¬ mediately behind them.

The dust jackets are a special fea¬ ture of DLB because they often document better than anything else the way in which an author’s work was launched in its own time. Specimens of the writers’ manuscripts are included when feasible. A supplement to DLB — tentatively titled A Guide, Chronology, and Glossary for American Litera¬ ture— will outline the history of literature in North America and trace the influences that shaped it. This volume will provide a framework for the study of American literature by means of chronological tables, literary affiliation charts, glossarial entries, and concise surveys of the major movements. It has been planned to stand on its own as a vade mecum, providing a ready-reference guide to the study of American literature as well as a companion to the DLB volumes for American literature.\n\nsel has been sought in deciding which minor figures to include and how full their entries should be. Wherever possible, useful references will be made to figures who do not warrant separate entries. Each DLB volume has a volume editor re¬ sponsible for planning the volume, selecting the figures for inclusion, and assigning the entries. Volume editors are also responsible for preparing, where appropriate, appendices surveying the ma¬ jor periodicals and literary and intellectual move¬ ments for their volumes, as well as lists of further readings. Work on the series as a whole is coordi¬ nated at the Bruccoli Clark editorial center in Co¬ lumbia, South Carolina, where the editorial staff is responsible for the accuracy of the published volumes. One f eature that distinguishes DLB is the illus¬ tration policy—its concern with the iconography of literature. Just as an author is influenced by his surroundings, so is the reader’s understanding of the author enhanced by a knowledge of his environ¬ ment. Therefore DLB volumes include not only drawings, paintings, and photographs of authors, often depicting them at various stages in their careers, but also illustrations of their families and places where they lived. Title pages are regularly reproduced in facsimile along with dust jackets for\n\nSamuel Johnson rightly decreed that “The chief glory of every people arises from its authors.” The purpose of the Dictionary of Literary Biography is to compile literary history in the surest way avail¬ able to us—by accurate and comprehensive treat¬ ment of the lives and work of those who contributed to it. The DLB Advisory Board\n\nx\n\nForeword Nineteen fifty-four ushered in a memorable period in Afro-American life. Brown v. The Board of Education paved the way not only for improve¬ ment in sociopolitical conditions, but also for a re¬ newed cultural consciousness among blacks. Within the next decade, the Montgomery bus boycott, stu¬ dent sit-ins, and the March on Washington would inspire a general climate of change and activism in American society that would affect Afro-American arts and letters. The surge of cultural spirit accom¬ panying political activity invigorated the creative writings of Afro-Americans and redefined the liter¬ ary work of black writers. In the post-1950s struggle for civil rights, opportunity, and equality, the liter¬ ature of modern Afro-Americans came of age. The writers included in this volume, whether they were born before or after World War II, all share in the redirected aesthetics of black recognition. They represent both a continuity with Afro-American artistic traditions and a forging ahead to new crea¬ tive territories. Mindful of the past, particularly the legacies of the New Negro Renaissance and its antecedents, these writers seized the immediate reality of their own times and in the process trans¬ formed the landscape of Afro-American writing. Afro-American poets and novelists, from the turn of the century on, have had their voices raised in the literary arena. Paul Laurence Dunbar, Lang¬ ston Hughes, and Richard Wright were household names long before reading or viewing audiences became aware of works by playwrights Theodore Ward and Louis Peterson in the 1940s and 1950s. Throughout the fifties Langston Hughes con¬ tinued to bring his dramas to the stage, but Peter¬ son’s Take a Giant Step in 1953 helped to focus se¬ rious attention on plays by Afro-Americans. Play¬ wright Alice Childress’s voice became synonymous with the efforts to bring black plays to black people and to integrate theater unions. The mid-1950s successes of Childress and Peterson gave way to Lorraine Hansberry’s phenomenal A Raisin in the Sun in 1959. Rightly considered a forerunner to black American drama, Hansberry stood at the pivotal point of the unprecedented changes that would soon occur in black representation on Amer¬ ican stages. When Hansberry’s play opened on Broadway to critical acclaim, it not only revitalized interest in plays about the experiences of blacks, but\n\nalso ended the decade with a promise of greater visibility for Afro-American playwrights. Drama evolved alongside poetry as a major genre for black writers. The stage world presented the opportunity for portable works with messages designed to engage audiences whose history in¬ volved a theater heritage ranging from early min¬ strel shows, musical revues, and church pageants to drama departments in black colleges, repertory companies, and community theater groups. Taking literature to the people, a main objective of poets coming to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s, also influenced the thinking of dramatists about their work. New black community theaters and profes¬ sional companies, such as the Free Southern Thea¬ ter in New Orleans, Black House in San Francisco, the New Federal Theatre and the Negro Ensemble Company in New York, evolved from the models of writing workshops, such as the Harlem Writers Guild, and public poetry readings, as well as from the traditions established by the Federal Theatre, Lafayette Theatre, Rose McClarendon Players, and the Harlem Suitcase Theater. Owen Dodson, Loften Mitchell, and Ted Shine are representative wri¬ ters who bridged the professional and collegiate drama communities, while Marvin X, Tom Dent, and Sonia Sanchez are indicative of playwrights who envisioned a particular kind of community theater. Fhe flood of creative outpourings in the 1960s that led to the black arts movement brought in its wake a new generation of dramatists who, together with prose writers and poets, provided some of the most influential voices in American literature. Dramatists Amiri Baraka and Ed Bullins joined poets of the stature of Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, and Don L. Lee (Haki Madhubuti) in bringing to their audiences works that were de¬ signed for popular more often than critical appeal. Their direct, confrontational messages led to radi¬ cally revised staging techniques. Fhe early sixties introduced, in number and variety, new dramatic forms to larger audiences. Ossie Davis’s comedy Pur lie Victorious and Adrienne Kennedy’s surrealistic Funnyhouse of a Negro, though distinctly different in concept and execu¬ tion, are examples of the theatrical productions that carried messages of a reality rarely seen outside\n\nxi\n\nDLB 38\n\nForeword\n\npartly responsible for their limited economic opportunities. While some other playwrights, such as Alice Childress, Charles Fuller, and N. R. David¬ son, Jr., created realistic dramas that drew upon the historical conditions of black American life, they too, like the more innovative dramatists of the 1960s and 1970s, invented on a level of sophisti¬ cated political thought and language. Although many of the playwrights of the 1960s and early 1970s were concerned with creat¬ ing theater for the people and with what Bullins called “street-corner theatre,” which took plays directly to ordinary working-class blacks, other playwrights in the seventies and eighties have com¬ bined this concern with an interest in reaching larg¬ er audiences through writing scripts for movies and television. Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun perhaps started the trend. It was followed by filmings of Baraka’s Dutchman, Elder’s Ceremonies in Dark Old Men and, more recently, Shange’s For Colored Girls. Maya Angelou, Charlie Russell, Bill Gunn, and Lonne Elder are a few of the writers who have contracted to write film scripts, Elder having also written episodes for popular television shows. Still other writers have, since the mid-seventies, worked primarily in the established New York literary com¬ munity. Shange’s searching drama of black women’s lives, for instance, has enjoyed major Broadway and off-Broadway productions. Writers who take advantage of such opportunities consis¬ tently suggest that an audience must be sought beyond those who read the texts. Their actions are a continuation of part of the philosophy espoused by the black arts movement that more than traditional means of expression should be used in taking the word to the people. What is apparent is that since the premiere of Lorraine Hansberry’s A Raisin in the Sun, black writers have had more diverse opportu¬ nities for disseminating their works, even though many of them, including Shine and Childress, have not yet achieved widespread recognition from the major productions of their works. Nurtured by a belief in the positive value of blackness, writers since the 1960s have directed their message to and about black people. Thus the drive toward integration and assimilation, which remained evident, gave way to a more prominent nationalistic, Pan-Africanist orientation among writers, who, in rejecting a western world view, sought a less oppressive and less decadent vision of the role of the artist and the function of art. Their themes address not only self-knowledge and group survival, but also love and celebration. In affirming self-worth and achievement, exponents of a black\n\nblack communities.\n\nHowever, James Baldwin’s Blues for Mr. Charlie and LeRoi Jones’s Dutchman, Slave, and The Toilet announced the penetrating artistic explorations of black life that would capture the imaginations of other black writers. Jones (Amiri Baraka) sets the tone for the decade with his exploration in Dutchman of the many, hidden psychosexual relationships between blacks and whites in America. His work throughout the sixties and seventies addressed the redefinition of blacks, of social roles, and of cultural institutions. The drama of black revolution, connected with Baraka, William Wellington Mackey, Jr., Ben Caldwell, and Ron Milner, emphasized a cultural nationalism that was part of the black arts move¬ ment of the 1960s. It assumed both a black audience and the necessity of the artist’s relationship to the black community; it advocated a cultural revolution in spirit, ideas, and art, which confronted and ex¬ pressed the needs and aspirations of black people. As Baraka was to observe in 1968, “The Revolu¬ tionary Theatre should force change, it should be change. If the beautiful see themselves, they will know themselves.” Of primary importance were nationhood and self-determination. The drama of black experience, or the theater of reality, associ¬ ated with Ed Bullins, Paul Carter Harrison, Melvin Van Peebles, and Ted Shine similarly involved an emphasis on character and theme, on black people and their concerns. Many playwrights sought to break down the barriers between the illusion of the stage and the reality of existence beyond the theater by allowing their characters to interact directly with members of the audience. Constructed more often than not to make whites in the audience uncomfortable, such techniques also illustrated the political dimension that so many of the writers of the 1960s considered crucial to their art. When Ted Shine’s Grand¬ mother Love steps to the apron of the stage in this 1969 production and asks who in the audience will be next in her scheme to poison racists and thereby make her “contribution” to the civil rights struggle, she effectively closes the gap between art and life. For some of the playwrights who continued in fairly traditional veins of staging, such as Douglas Turner Ward, Ossie Davis, and Lonne Elder III, marked changes in approach to subject matter de¬ fined their work. Ward and Davis border on the farce in their depictions of Southern race relations; outrageous and discomforting portrayals of whites evoked broad laughter in the blacks viewing the shows. Elder dared to suggest that black men, by the perversity of the moral choices they make, might be xii\n\nDLB 38\n\nForeword\n\nAlex Haley, continue the oldest literary tradition among black American writers — that of recording personal and communal biography. For Angelou, shaping a self in the tradition of Frederick Douglass and Booker T. Washington is the force that has sustained her through four installments of her autobiography. Murray and Haley draw upon their personal and family histories to make Gasoline Point, Alabama, and Henning, Tennessee, memo¬ rable places in the history of Afro-American litera¬ ture. Others such as Ntozake Shange have used autobiography as one basis for their creative works, while still others, such as June Jordan and Alexis Deveaux, have used biography as a means of celebrating their forebears or of asserting the place of black ancestors in history and insuring that their stories will not be forgotten, that the meaning of their achievements and their defeats will not be lost. Perhaps the most significant contributor to preserving the past of Afro-Americans is Alex Haley, whose Roots inspired a generation of w7hite and black Americans to discover family history, to value the oral tradition, and to tell the little known stories of ordinary, yet heroic people. Haley suc¬ ceeded in giving new life to the idea of heritage and roots; his saga published in 1976 is in many ways a culmination of some of the ideas of the black arts movement, such as the emphasis on the need for black pride and using history as one of the bases for that pride. Based on long and arduous research, Haley’s family history also relies on the conventions of fiction; it gives evidence of a tendency since the 1960s to combine genres and to create new forms, as Shange does with her choreopoems, For Colored\n\naesthetic have refused adherence to white stan¬ dards of beauty or language. As Larry Neal stressed in 1968, they proposed “a separate symbolism, mythology, critique, and iconology,” which empha¬ sized the cultural heritage and traditions of black Americans, particularly African survivals, blues and jazz rhythms, oral folk culture, and spiritual sensibilities. As a result, a number of modern writ¬ ers have turned to prose essays in order to explain their objectives and to iterate the theories defining their work. Neal, Kalamu ya Salaam, Baraka, Woodie King, and others have written essays assert¬ ing connections between the historical contribu¬ tions and value systems of blacks and the creative possibilities in black life. Albert Murray has investi¬ gated folk culture, and like Neal and Baraka, has written about the primacy of musical forms in crea¬ tive works by Afro-Americans. Other waiters such as Toni Cade Bambara, Arthenia Bates Millican, and James Alan McPher¬ son have worked mainly in short fiction, but they, like the majority of Afro-American writers since the sixties, have been influenced by the language and culture of blacks and have extended their short stories to encompass added possibilities for perceiv¬ ing and portraying the reality and truth of AfroAmerican life and history. Bambara adopts the folk speech of black Americans in Gorilla, My Love and consciously writes in “black English.” She is con¬ cerned with relationships between children and parents as wrell as with the effect of the environment upon adolescent development. Like Bambara, Mil¬ lican and McPherson provide unique glimpses into Afro-American life by dwelling on the insides of black communities w'ithin the United States, on black people interacting with each other in loving and protecting, as well as in shaping futures for themselves. Within the short fictional form, howev¬ er, Bambara in particular is as successful as the playwrights in bringing activism to the page, in closing the gap between politics and art. Prose writings proliferated in the decades since the 1950s, and just as dramatists were in¬ terested in creating a theater in their own image, so w7ere the writers of prose interested in literary crea¬ tions, relevant to black Americans. Autobiography and biography have become increasingly important as modes for expressing conceptions of sell and of the meaning of Afro-American history. Prose writ¬ ers, such as Maya Angelou, Albert Murray, and\n\nGirls and Spell #7.\n\nThe writers included here have made signifi¬ cant contributions to modern literature, but with a few notable exceptions (Baraka, Angelou, Bullins, McPherson) they have remained largely unknown to general readers and specialists alike. Their phe¬ nomenal output, frequently published by small presses and little magazines, deserves greater atten¬ tion from students of literature, and the writers themselves merit further acknowledgment from literary scholars. This volume, then, represents an initial effort to make these post-1955 writers and bibliographies of their works more accessible for further research and study. — Thadious M.

Four serial autobiographi¬ cal volumes have been published to date (in 1970, 1974, 1976, and 1981), covering the period from 1928 to the mid-1960s; more may be expected. She asserts in I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1970): “The fact that the adult American Negro female emerges a formidable character is often met with amazement, distaste and even belligerence. It is seldom accepted as an inevitable outcome of the struggle won by survivors and deserves respect if not enthusiastic acceptance.” And yet, Angelou’s own autobiographies and vivid lectures about her¬ self, ranging in tone from warmly humorous to bitterly satiric, have won a popular and critical fol¬ lowing that is both respectful and enthusiastic. As she adds successive volumes to her life\n\nSCREENPLAYS: Georgia, Georgia, IndependentCinerama, 1972; All Day Long, American Film Institute, 1974.

Both become articulators of the nature and validity of a collective heritage as they interpret the particu¬ lars of a culture for a wide audience of whites as well as blacks; as one critic said, Angelou illuminates “with the intensity of lightning the tragedy that was once this nation’s two-track culture.” As people who have lived varied and vigorous lives, they embody the quintessential experiences of their race and cul¬ ture. An account of the life and major writings of Maya Angelou is of necessity based largely on in¬ formation that she herself has supplied in her auto¬ biographies; where lacunae exist, they do so be¬ cause Angelou herself has chosen not to discuss certain periods of time, events, or people. “I will say how old I am [53], I will say how tall I am [six feet], but I will not say how many times I have been married,” she told an interviewer in 1981; “It might frighten them off.” Angelou’s odyssey — psychological, spiritual, literary, as well as geographical — begins with / Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, generally acceded to be the best of her four autobiographical volumes and the exclusive focus, to date, of serious critical attention. Marguerite Johnson (she did not become Maya Angelou until her debut as a dancer at the Purple Onion cabaret in her early twenties) was born in St. Louis on 4 April 1928 to Bailey and Vivian Baxter Johnson. When she was three and her brother Bailey was four, they were sent by their divorced parents to live in Stamps, Arkansas, which was, she said, the same as “Chitlin’ Switch, Georgia; Hang ’Em High, Alabama; Don’t Let the Sun Set on You Here, Nigger, Mississippi.” “High spots in Stamps were usually negative,” she observes, “droughts, floods, lynchings and deaths.” There Angelou remained for a decade, reared by her maternal grandmother, Annie (“Momma”) Henderson, who kept a country store and ruled her grandchildren with the same sense of “work, duty, religion,” and morality with which she ruled her own life. Observes Angelou, “I don’t think she ever knew that a deep-brooding love hung over everything she touched.” In Stamps Angelou learned what it was like to be a black girl in a world whose boundaries were set by whites. She learned what it meant to wear for Easter a “plain ugly cut-down [dress] from a white woman’s once-was-purple throwaway,” her skinny\n\nlegs “greased with Blue Seal Vaseline and pow¬ dered with the Arkansas red clay.” As a young child she expected at any minute to wake from “my black ugly dream” and find her “Nappy black hair” meta¬ morphosed to a long, blonde bob. She thought, then, that “God was white,” but wondered whether He would “allow His only Son to mix with this crowd of cotton pickers and maids, washerwomen and handymen.” She learned the humiliation of being refused treatment by a white dentist who would “ ‘rather stick my hand in a dog’s mouth than in a nigger’s.’ ” But she learned, also, that blacks would not only endure, but prevail. Momma, head of one of the few black families “not on relief” during the Depression, was an honest but shrewd business¬ woman who could turn aside the taunts of the “powhitetrash” and beat the bigoted dentist at his own game. From her Angelou learned common sense, practicality, and the ability to control one’s own destiny that comes from constant hard work and 4\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\ncourage, “grace under pressure.” She learned, sometimes forcibly, the literature of black writers: “Bailey and I decided to memorize a scene from The Merchant of Venice, but we realized that Momma would question us about the author and that we’d have to tell her that Shakespeare was white, and it wouldn’t matter to her whether he was dead or not. So we chose ‘The Creation’ by James Weldon John¬ son instead.”\n\nLabor School. Her informal schooling, in the “fourteen-room typical San Franciscan post-Earthquake” rooming house her mother ran in the Fillmore Dis¬ trict, was much more extensive. From her mother she learned “proper posture, table manners, good restaurants”; from her stepfather, how to play “poker, blackjack, tonk and high, low, Jick, Jack and the Game”; from the household, the ways of ship¬ yard workers, “much-powdered prostitutes,” and “the most colorful characters in the Black under¬ ground.” These people she accepted as honest in their own way. But she fled the hypocrisy of a summer vacation with her failed father and his nouveau bourgeois girl friend in their tacky trailer in south¬ ern California. Unable to return to her mother for a month, she lived in a graveyard of wrecked cars, many inhabited by homeless children whose own natural brotherhood “set a tone of tolerance for my life.” The book ends with her determined rush to¬ ward maturity. With the perseverance that fore¬ shadowed later civil rights work, she finally obtained a job, while still in high school, as the first black woman streetcar conductor in San Francisco. With equal determination to prove that she was a woman, she became pregnant and at sixteen was delivered of a son one month after graduation from Mission High School’s summer school in 1945. She has since been awarded honorary degrees by Smith College, Mills College, and Lawrence University, among others. The next installment of Angelou’s auto¬ biography, Gather Together in My Name (1974), seems much less satisfactory than the first. This may be in large part because here Angelou is less admirable as a central character than she was in / Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. Here, in instance after instance, she abandons or jeopardizes the maturity, honesty, and intuitive good judgment toward which she had been moving in Caged Bird. Her bold, headstrong temperament leads her to bluff her way into situa¬ tions dangerous to herself and her infant son, Guy; when she cannot learn enough quickly enough to escape she becomes dependent on others who too often exploit her naivete and good will—when she is not exploiting theirs. As Angelou anatomizes her exploits, it is hard to tell whether she intends this segment of her life story to be emblematic of the lives of all other unwed, undereducated black teen¬ age mothers, or for her misadventures to serve as a warning to others, or to demonstrate as she did in Caged Bird the survival and staying power of black women in adverse circumstances. The wit and\n\nBut the pride in herself this new knowledge engendered took a devastating fall when she was eight, during a brief stay in St. Louis with her beautiful mother, Vivian Baxter, “light-skinned with straight hair.” She was raped by her mother’s boyfriend, a taciturn “big brown bear” who was found “dropped . . . [or] kicked to death” shortly afterward. In court she had not revealed that she had permitted him to fondle her on two earlier occasions. Therefore she felt responsible for his murder (committed by her uncles), and she decided that “I had to stop talking.” Back in Stamps, where she was sent perhaps because “the St. Louis family just got fed up with my grim presence,” her bourgeoning pride dis¬ appeared for nearly five years, along with her speech. Both were restored by delicious afternoons, “sweet-milk fresh” in memory, of reading and recit¬ ing the world’s great literature with Mrs. Flowers, the educated “aristocrat of Black Stamps” who “acted just as refined as whitefolks in the movies and books and . . . was more beautiful”; “she made me proud to be a Negro, just by being herself.” She learned during this time the importance of self-expression, as well as communication, for “the wonderful, beautiful Negro race” survives “in exact relationship to the dedication of our poets (include preachers, musicians and blues singers).” She explained to an interviewer in 1981 that “there isn’t one day since I was raped that I haven’t thought about it... I have gotten beyond hate and fear, but there is something beyond that.” Her mul¬ tiple careers in the arts—singing, dancing, and writing—have become ways of transcending her personal hates and fears, as well as of proclaiming her black identity and pride. In 1940, after Angelou’s graduation at the top of her eighth grade, her fun-loving mother, now a professional gambler, moved the children from Stamps to San Francisco, imposing experience on innocence, disorder upon order. Maya’s subse¬ quent formal education consisted of attending George Washington High School in San Francisco throughout World War II, while concurrently tak¬ ing dance and drama lessons at the California\n\n5\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nPraise for Maya Angelou s\n\n1 know that not since the days of my childhood, when people in books were more real than the people one saw- every day, have I found myself so moved.\"\n\n-James Baldwin\n\n.full of laughter and tears, love and hate, failures and triumphs, and above all. understanding.”\n\n-John O.

At eighteen she had “managed in a few tense years to become a snob at all levels, racial, cultural and intellectual. I was a madam and thought myself morally superior to the whores. I was a waitress and believed myself cleverer than the customers I served. I was a lonely unmarried mother and held myself to be freer than the married women I met.” Seeking sanctuary in Stamps when her tenweek-old empire crashed brought no solace. She talked back to a “slack-butted” store clerk, and the threat of a reprisal by the Ku Klux Klan caused Momma Henderson to send Angelou back to San Francisco for safety. Then, rejected on the eve of her induction into the army because she lied on her application, she escaped into marijuana and sought solace in the dream that is an ironic leitmotif of Gather Together: “I was going to have it made—and no doubt through the good offices of a handsome man who would love me to distraction.” Her artificial high was replaced by a natural\n\npanache with which she narrates her picaresque tale prevent it from being a confessional; the writing of this volume itself may be the final exorcism of the flaws. Angelou is determined to leave her mother’s household, “take a job and show the whole world (my son’s father) that I was equal to my pride and greater than my pretensions.” As soon as she dis¬ covered that the Creole Cafe would pay $75 a week for a cook, “I knew I could cook Creole, whatever that was.” She learned quickly, and with equal haste fell in love with a customer: “When he opened the steamy door to the restaurant, surely it was the second coming of Christ.” When the affair ended after two months (he was engaged to another woman) Angelou decided to make a new life in San Diego, buttressed by $200 and her mother’s advice, unwittingly prophetic: “ ‘Be the best of anything you get into. If you want to be a whore, it’s your life. Be a damn good one.’ ” Angelou’s gradual initiation into prostitution began with a job as a nightclub waitress. There she\n\nt\n\n6\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\none as she became part of a nightclub dancing act, with R. L. Poole as her partner, manager, mentor, and intermittent lover: “As a dancer, my instru¬ ment was my body. I couldn’t just allow . . . anyone to screw my instrument.” The emergence of Poole’s drug dependent “old lady” ended their liaison, and Angelou fled again into a restaurant kitchen and daydreams of the perfect husband. Her romantic imagination, inspired by a naivete that never ripened into wisdom during the three-year span of Gather Together, endowed the dapper L. D. Tolbrook, “an established gambler who had Southern manners and big city class,” with the means for her salvation. Prepared to be “an old man’s darling,” deluded by her wish to marry, she too willingly rationalized the virtues of life as a prostitute earning money for him: “ ‘Prostitution is like beauty. It is in the eye of the beholder. There are married women who are more whorish than a street prostitute because they have sold their bodies for marriage licenses, and there are some women who sleep with men for money who have great integrity because they are doing it for a purpose.’ ” It took threats of violence from her brother, himself on the verge of drug addiction, to keep her from returning to the whorehouse after a week’s dismal stint. She tried a few more legitimate jobs, but survival “didn’t take hold.” She rejected the traditional options for black women: hustling (“I obviously had little aptitude for that”), working as a housemaid (“I would keep my negative Southern exposures to whites before me like a defensive hand”), or “wrestling with old lady Welfare (my neck wouldn’t bend for that).” Prepared to turn to hard drugs again because of an unrealistic romantic love, she was dragged from the edge of addiction’s abyss by her lover, who forced her to watch him shoot up in a sewerlike “hit joint for addicts.” She concludes her account of this sordid segment of her life with a plea for forgiveness which is devoid of moral reflection. She was seemingly neither sadder nor wiser: “As I watched the wretched nod and scratch, I felt my own innocence as real as a grain of sand between my teeth. I was pure as moonlight and had only begun to live. My escapades were the fumblings of youth and to be forgiven as such.” In the third volume of Angelou’s saga, Singin’ and Swingin’ and Cellin' Merry Like Christmas (1976), her actions finally began to match her aspirations for maturity, though intermittently, as she lurched and ultimately strode through the years from 19501955. At about twenty-two (Angelou is usually vague about dates) she married Tosh Angelos, an\n\nex-sailor “intelligent, kind and reliable.” And white. Her mother exploded in rage, anticipating “A hell of a wedding gift—the contempt of his people and the distrust of your own.” Although she experienced little of either, the fortress of bourgeois respectability for which she had longed soon became a prison, restrictive of her independence. Too free a spirit to remain fettered for long, she was divorced within three years and resumed her career as a dancer, entertaining cus¬ tomers as the first black dancer at a local bar with “a little rhumba, tango, jitterbug, Susy-Q, trucking, snake hips, conga, Charleston and cha-cha-cha.” Before long she attracted the notice of the much more skilled performers at the chic Purple Onion and was soon, to her amazement, offered a job there: “There whites were treating me as an equal, as if I could do whatever they could do. They did not consider that race, height, or gender or lack of education might have crippled me and that I should be regarded as someone invalided.” Stripped of these excuses for failure, Angelou had to succeed on her own. And she did. She turned down one of the lead roles in the Broadway produc¬ tion of House of Flowers to join the European touring cast of Porgy and Bess. She devotes over half the book to describing the tour—from Montreal to Paris, Zagreb, and Belgrade, from Greece to Egypt, Israel, and Italy: “Dancing and singing every night with sixty people was more like a party than a chore.” She loved the ambience of the tightly knit, black professional community; she loved the free¬ dom as well as the work, freedom from housework, “freedom from the constant nuisance of a small child’s chatter,” freedom from the mores of the bourgeois world she had only recently walked out on. But duty to her child, nine and miserable with¬ out her, drove her home. Guilt over her neglect of him nearly drove her to suicide, but love of life and of motherhood and of dancing drove her instead to resume her career. In The Heart of a Woman (1981) Angelou in¬ tertwines an account of seven years of her own coming of age (1957-1963) with the coming of age of the civil rights movement and the beginning of the women’s movement. Her enlarged focus and clear vision transcend the particulars and give this book a fascinating universality of perspective and psychological depth that almost matches the quality of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (in contrast to the shallower and more limited intervening volumes). Its motifs are commitment and betrayal.\n\n7\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nprogress and racial integration,” excoriating “white men, white women, white children and white his¬ tory, particularly as is applied to black people.” Through Killens and others she learned to ac¬ knowledge her kinship with blacks nationwide: “ ‘Georgia is Down South. California is Up South. If you’re black in this country you’re on a planta¬\n\nBy the time she was thirty, Angelou had made a commitment to become a writer. Inspired by her friendship with the distinguished social activist au¬ thor John Killens, she moved to Brooklyn to be near him and to learn her craft. Through weekly meet¬ ings of the Harlem Writers Guild she learned to treat her writing seriously: “If I wanted to write, I had to be willing to develop a kind of concentration found mostly in people awaiting execution. I had to learn technique and surrender my ignorance.” And, although it was difficult, she learned to toler¬ ate criticism, however harsh, and was accepted as a practicing member of a group of established writers that included John Henrik Clarke, Paule Marshall, and James Baldwin. Recognizing that “trying to overcome was black people’s honorable tradition,” Angelou resolved to overcome the problems in her writing until it met the exacting standards of her literary mentors. At the same time Angelou made a commit¬ ment to promote black civil rights. Her widening circle of black intellectual friends was “persistently examining the nature of racial oppression, racial\n\ntion.’ ” So when she met Martin Luther King she was prepared to accept his challenge: “We, the black people, the most displaced, the poorest, the most maligned and scourged, we had the glorious task of reclaiming the soul and saving the honor of the country.” With comedian Godfrey Cambridge she organized a benefit, “Cabaret of Freedom,” for King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference. She was starring “on the stage of life,” a “general in the army” of fighters against legal discrimination, and as a consequence was soon appointed by the veteran civil rights activist, Bayard Rustin, to suc¬ ceed him as the SCLC’s northern coordinator. Dur¬ ing her six months in office she was grateful for the interracial cooperation that was “new and old and\n\nDust jackets for the third and fourth volumes of what has been called “one of the more significant and important personal narratives of our time”\n\n8\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\ndynamic,” from children to adults alike, not only in Harlem but throughout the nation. The same dynamism pervaded the black support of commu¬ nists, from Castro’s Cuba to Russia. Angelou vividly captures the mood of the era with snatches of song, dialogue, and slogans that dynamically punctuate this book: “Castro never had called himself white, so he was O.K. from the git. . . and as black people often said . . . ‘Wasn’t no Communist lynched my poppa or raped my mamma.’ ‘Hey, Khruschev. Go on, with your bad self.’ ” Despite her increasing maturity as a writer and her effective advocacy of black civil rights, Angelou, in her early thirties, still retained the romantic notion of quiet suburban domesticity that had betrayed her repeatedly in her teens and early twenties and was to do so again. She, who by this time had performed with Odetta, and the revolu¬ tionary Clancy Brothers (“ ‘the shamrock Is forbid by law/to grow on Irish ground’ ”), and had gotten half of Harlem to demonstrate at the United Na¬ tions to protest Patrice Lumumba’s assassination, proposed marriage to a laconic bail bondsman she had met in a bar. As he plied her with engagement presents of stolen goods he had confiscated, she was preparing to “cook, clean house . . . and join some local women’s volunteer organizations.” In betraying her active, creative life, she could only betray her fiance. Indeed, she left him quickly for the bulky, impeccably suave Vusumzi Make, a South African freedom fighter who proposed to her instantly, claiming that their marriage would be “ ‘the joining of Africa and Africa-America!’ ” Although despite their good intentions they were never legally wed, Make’s initial adoration helped Maya, ever romantic, to feel exactly the way she wanted to, like “a young African virgin, made beautiful for her chief.” Make convinced her to accept a major theatrical role, as the White Queen in Jean Genet’s The Blacks, effectively countering her objection, “ ‘The play says given the chance, black people will act as cruel as whites,’ ” with, “ ‘Dear Wife, that is a reverse racism. Black people are human. No more, no less.’ ” They left New York in the same flutter of unpaid bills that pursued them to Egypt. While Make stumped the world for South African free¬ dom and shamelessly womanized on the side, Ange¬ lou violated an African prohibition against women working and got a job to help pay the bills. Make met her announcement that she was associate editor of the English language Arab Observer (another type of work she, typically, had to learn on the job) with a tirade that vilified her “insolence, independence,\n\nlack of respect, arrogance, ignorance, defiance, cal¬ lousness, cheekiness and lack of breeding.” “He was right,” Angelou concluded. But this marked the beginning of the end of their liaison, as he con¬ tinued to betray her sexually and she persisted in remaining true to her black American culture that ultimately could not bend to his African world view. Before a tribunal of the African diplomatic community she defended, “with openness and sass,” her decision to leave Make. The “African palaver” vindicated her and assured her an inde¬ pendent welcome in the African community. The Heart of a Woman, which has received consistent critical acclaim, ends with her arrival in Kwarne Nkrumah’s Ghana to enroll her son in the Universi¬ ty of Ghana, her commitment to black freedom—as well as her own—intact. From 1973 to 1981 she was married to Paul du Feu. In describing her development in her auto¬ biographies, Angelou gives generous credit to the influences of dominant women during her child¬ hood. I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings focuses on three impressive female role models: “Momma” Henderson, her powerful, enterprising, righteous, religious grandmother; Mrs. Flowers, beautiful, cultivated, and pridefully black; and her mother, the sexy, sassy, and savvy embodiment of black mores. The combined characteristics of these women became leitmotifs throughout the volumes of Angelou’s autobiography. Men, however, get little credit for who she is and how she got that way. During Angelou’s child¬ hood, adult black men were either absent (her father), weak (her crippled uncle), subservient to women (her uncle and her mother’s boyfriends), sexually abusive (the man who raped her), or lazy and hedonistic (her father when she met him again in her teenage years). Of the men she has romantic relationships with as an adult (to the point at which Heart of a Woman ends), the blacks are either stodgy (her bail bondsman fiance) or unwilling to make a long-term commitment (Make). The man who treats her with greatest respect and affection is white (Angelos, her first husband). But the primary disruptive factor in all these relationships is Angelou’s quest for self-identity, manifested through self-assertiveness and the selfexpression that come not only from her careers as a dancer, a singer, and a writer, but from being very good at these endeavors. As she matures, she be¬ comes more and more her own person. Through her own efforts and innate talent, which she mini¬ mizes in concentrating on the results, she succeeds early and spectacularly in these highly competitive\n\n9\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\nDust jacket for Angelou s 1978 book. In the title poem she ivrites, “You may trod me in the very dirt!but still, like dust, I'll rise.”\n\nfields in which many fail. Her enjoyment of the freedom, mobility, independence, and acclaim that success makes possible is evident from the zestful assurance with which she writes her autobiog¬ raphies. Angelou’s three slim volumes of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water fore I Diiie (1971, which incorporates many of the lyrics from the 1969 re¬ cording of The Poetry of Maya Angelou), Oh Pray My Wings Are Gonna Fit Me Well (1975), and And Still l Rise (1978), are of lesser stature than her autobio¬ graphical writing. Much of Angelou’s poetry, almost entirely short lyrics, expresses in strong, often jazzy rhythms, themes common to the life experiences of many American blacks—discrimination, exploita¬ tion, being on welfare. Some of her poems extol the survivors, those whose black pride enables them to prevail over the otherwise demeaning circum¬ stances of their existence. Thus in “When I Think\n\nAbout Myself” she adopts the persona of an aging domestic to comment ironically about the phe¬ nomenon of black survival in a world dominated by whites: “Sixty years in these folks’ world/The child I works for calls me girl/I say ‘Yes ma’am’ for work¬ ings’ sake./Too proud to bend/Too poor to break.” In “Times-Square-Shoeshine Composition,” the feisty black shoeshine boy defends, in dialect, his thirty-five-cent price against the customer who tries to cheat him out of a dime, his slangy remarks punctuated by the aggressive “pow pow” of the shoeshine rag. Other poems deal with social issues and prob¬ lems which, though not unique to blacks, are ex¬ plored from a black perspective. In “Letter to an Aspiring Junkie,” a street-smart cat cautions the prospective junkie to beware, “Climb into the streets, man, like you climb/into the ass end of a lion.” Angelou sympathizes with the plight of aban¬ doned black children, embodied in “John J,” whose\n\n10\n\nDLB 38\n\nMaya Angelou\n\n“momma didn’t want him,” and who ends up gam¬ bling in a bar with a “flinging singing lady.” Her superficial look at “Prisoners” shows them predict¬ ably experiencing “the horror/of gray guard men” — “It’s jail/and bail/then rails to run.” At her most irritating, Angelou preaches. In language and hortatory tone reminiscent of popular turn-of-thecentury poetry, she advises readers to “Take Time Out” to “show some kindness/for the folks/'who thought that blindness/was an illness that/affected eyes alone.” When Angelou’s lyrics deal with the common experiences of licit and illicit love, and of youth and aging, she writes from various female perspectives similar to those Dorothy Parker often used, and with Parker’s self-consciousness, but without her wit. For example, in “Communication I” the love¬ lorn damsel, impervious to her wooer’s quotations from Pope, Shaw, and Salinger, “frankly told her mother/‘Of all he said I understood,/he said he loved another.’ ” In mundane imagery (“The day hangs heavy/loose and grey/when you’re away”) a\n\ncomparable persona laments her lover’s evasiveness (“Won’t you pull yourself together/For/Me/ ONCE”). And she screams at the silent “Tele¬ phone,” “Ring. Damn you!” Her occasional vivid black dialect,(“But forty years of age . . . /stomps/ no-knocking/into the script/bumps a funky grind on the/shabby curtain of youth. . . . ”) enlivens ex¬ pressions that seldom rise above the banal. Her poems' seem particularly derivative and cloying when expressed in conventional language: “My pencil halts/and will not go/along that quiet path /1 need to write/of lovers false. ...” Angelou’s poetry becomes far more interest¬ ing when she dramatizes it in her characteristically dynamic stage performances. Angelou’s statuesque figure, dressed in bright colors (and sometimes, African designs), moves exuberantly, vigorously to reinforce the rhythm of the lines, the tone of the words. Her singing and dancing and electrifying stage presence transcend the predictable words and rhymes. In the early 1970s Angelou wrote a screenplay\n\ntaya Angelou Dust jacket for Angelou’s 1983 poetry collection.

Toni and her brother grew up with their mother in New York City (Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant, and Queens) and Jersey City, New Jersey. She attended various public and private schools in New York State, New Jersey, and the southern United States. She adopted the name Bambara in 1970 when she discovered it as a part of a signature on a sketchbook she found in her great¬ grandmother’s trunk. Reticent in most of her essays and interviews about specific biographical details of her life, Bambara chooses instead to give enlarged impressions of a few individuals and events from her early life which she feels most influenced her. In September 1973, at age 34, Bambara published an essay in Redbook explaining what she most appreciated about her mother, Helen. Typical of her tendency to enlarge reality as a means of em¬ phasizing an important point, Bambara began the essay with an anecdote narrated, in a distinctly Afro-American dialect, by a young girl who remem¬ bers the numerous occasions on which her mother visited her public school classroom to set the teacher straight on a few facts about Afro-American history and people. The mother would march in, plant herself firmly in front of the teacher, speak her mind loudly enough for the entire class to hear, and then march out. The scene mesmerized the chil¬ dren and terrified the apologetic teacher. The young narrator recalls the enormous pride which would well up in her own breast whenever her mother made her appearance. She could then walk home triumphantly, as her schoolmates expressed their awe and gratitude for her mother’s having fought their battle with the teacher. As the narrator says, “She was my mother, but she was everybody’s champion.” The anecdote, replete with humor which does not belie the seriousness of the point Bambara is making, leads into a discussion of those less dramatic but equally heroic stances, to Bambara’s way of thinking, that Helen Cade took in the course of raising her two children alone. Bambara remembers her mother as one who understood and respected her children’s need to get in touch with their private selves. Thus in the face of criticism from neighbors and friends who said she was over¬ indulging her two children, Helen Cade allowed them to feel they had the right “to be cozy with ourselves” and “to dialogue and poet with the me.” Bambara thanks her mother in this essay for nur¬ turing, rather than thwarting, her habit of taking private inventory, of examining her feelings: “ . . . she knew, I suspect, the value of the inner\n\nIn many ways Toni Cade Bambara is one of the best representatives of the group of AfroAmerican writers who, during the 1960s, became directly involved in the cultural and sociopolitical activities in urban communities across the country. Like James Baldwin, Imamu Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones), Nikki Giovanni, June Jordan, Sonia San¬ chez, and Alice Walker, she immersed herself in civil rights issues by lecturing to and helping to organize rallies within the black community, while at the same time using these experiences as the nucleus for her essays and creative writing. Like others of that era, Bambara wrote from a stance of near defiance—pushing the cultural assumptions of the larger American society aside to show her audience what she believed to be the distinguishing characteristics of Afro-American culture. Her fic¬ tion reflects the Afro-American idiomatic expres¬ sions, habits of interpersonal relationships, and, most important, its myths, music, and history. While some who rode the tide of enormous popu¬ larity during the 1960s passed on to virtual obscuri¬ ty in the 1970s, Bambara is one of the few who continued to work within the black urban com¬ munities (filming, lecturing, organizing, and read¬ ing from her works at rallies and conferences), pro¬ ducing imaginative reenactments of these experi¬ ences in her fiction. In addition, Bambara estab¬ lished herself over the years as an educator, teaching in colleges and in independent community schools in various cities on the East Coast. 13\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\nanced by as many if not more persons who have a genuine concern for other people. Her short stories and her novel dramatize this view to such an extent that even her toughest characters (as in “Playing with Punjab” in Gorilla, My Love) betray an under¬ lying sensitivity to life, and to their fellow blacks. Bambara published her first short story, “Sweet Town,” in Vendome magazine (as Toni Cade in January 1959). That same year she received her B.A. in Theater Arts/English and the John Golden Award for Fiction from Queens College. The Long Island Star awarded her its Pauper Press Award for nonfiction that same year. While enrolled as a graduate student of modern American fiction at the City College of New York, Bambara worked as a social worker for the Harlem Welfare Center for the year 1959-1960. She published her second story, “Mississippi Ham Rider,” in the Summer 1960 Massachusetts Review. In 1961 she studied at the Commedia del’Arte in Milan, Italy, and worked there as a free-lance writer. Between 1962 and 1965 she completed her master’s degree and worked as program director at Colony House in Brooklyn and as the recreational and occupational therapist for Metropolitan Hospital’s psychiatric division. Dur¬ ing those years she also took on various positions as either coordinator or director of local neighbor¬ hood programs, such as the Equivalency Program, the Veteran Reentry Program, the 8th Street Play Program sponsored by the Lower Eastside Tenants Association, and the Tutorial Program at the Hous¬ ton Street Public Library. After receiving her mas¬ ter’s degree Bambara taught at the City College of New York from 1965 to 1969 and served as direc¬ tor/adviser for the Theater of the Black Experience and as an adviser for various types of publications sponsored by the City College SEEK program, such as Obsidian, Onyx, and The Paper. It was during this same four-year period that more of her stories be¬ gan to appear in various journals and magazines, such as The Liberator, Prairie Schooner, and Redbook; however, Bambara insists that, for her, writing was at that time “rather frivolous ... it was something you did because you didn’t feel like doing any work.” Work in this sense meant teaching and advising at City College, coordinating programs at community centers, and participating in the numerous workshops and study groups focusing on the sociopolitical issues of the day—both the black liberation and women’s movements. Bambara was involved in them all during the 1960s, the decade when she says she came of age, and in 1970 she edited and published an anthology entitled The Black Woman, which was designed to show what\n\nlife.” The essay shows a daughter who in retrospect realizes how much inner resolve it took for her mother to defend her children’s right to be differ¬ ent and to be self-confident in following their inner urges. In a 1979 interview Bambara explained that in her mother’s household both she and her brother were expected to be self-sufficient, competent, and “to be rather nonchalant about expertise in a num¬ ber of areas.” No distinction was made, Bambara insists, between how a girl should think and behave and how a boy should think and behave — both of the Cade children were expected to be sensitive, caring people who took responsibility for them¬ selves and their own personal growth beyond the guidance which a working mother could provide. The family moved frequently, and as a child Bambara’s inquisitive nature led her out to explore each new neighborhood in which her family lived. “As a kid with an enormous appetite for knowledge and a gift for imagining myself anywhere in the universe, I always seemed to be drawn to the library or to some music spot or to 125th Street and Seventh Avenue, Speaker’s Corner, to listen to Garveyites, Father Diviners, Rastafarians, Muslims, trade unionists, communists, Pan-Africanists.” In reflecting on the types of persons she considered most fascinating at that time she says there were two types of women, other than her mother, in the various neighborhoods: the Miss Naomi types were those women who led a very exciting night life and who had “lots of clothes in the closet” and a shrewd method of dealing with men; the Miss Gladys types were the women who lived on the first floor of the tenement building, took part in the local gambling, and who, like the Miss Naomi types, were ready, willing, and able to give free advice on everything from “how to get your homework done” to which number you should play. These women, as Bam¬ bara describes them, cared about the young girls in the neighborhood and therefore took it upon them¬ selves to advise them on how to avoid those things which could be harmful, such as “those cruising cars that moved through the neighborhood patrolling little girls.” In Bambara’s view the Miss Naomis and the Miss Gladyses can be used in her fiction to “teach us valuable lessons of life” and to give a dimension to the stereotypes of black women which only another Afro-American could understand and depict. The basic implication of all of Toni Gade Bambara’s stories is that there is an undercurrent of caring for one’s neighbors that sustains black Amer¬ icans. In her view the presence of those individuals who intend to do harm to people is counterbal¬ 14\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\nvarious black women were thinking and doing about both the civil rights and the women’s move¬ ments.\n\ninteract with the male characters. Bambara found the production to be accurate historically, but also relevant to the social situation of the 1960s when much attention was placed on black prize fighters and their relationships with black and white women. In editing The Black Woman, Bambara cut across age, class, and occupational barriers to show that black women shared some of the same con¬ cerns about black men, social issues (such as educa¬ tion and housing), and their personal development as women. At the same time, however, the readings in the anthology show that black women were sharply divided along political lines with some arguing for a radical departure from every known form of black female behavior and others lament¬ ing that too many changes would jeopardize a woman’s emotional security. The main point though is that Bambara’s anthology provided an arena for black women’s opinions to be voiced en masse at a time when it was assumed that all blacks were preoccupied with racial equality. For Bam¬ bara, the struggle for black equality in America was important but not to be obtained at the price of neglecting any one member of the Afro-American community. In 1969 Bambara began teaching in the En¬ glish Department at Livingston College in New Jersey where she was to remain until 1974. During that time she became an associate professor at Livingston and in addition to her teaching duties, functioned as speaker of the faculty chamber, served on the Livingston Black Faculty Organiza¬ tion, and worked as the coadviser for the Harambee dancers, the Malcolm Players, and Sisters in Con¬ sciousness. In 1974, she received a plaque from the Livingston College black community for service. In 1971 Bambara edited her second antholo¬ gy entitled Tales and Stories for Black Folks. The col¬ lection had broad appeal in the black community, but Bambara had had an audience of high school and college students in mind. As she explains in her introduction, the major intention of the volume was to teach young blacks the historical value of one of their daily activities—telling stories. Bambara calls it “Our Great Kitchen Tradition” or the common experience most Afro-Americans have of hearing various family members tell stories about “the old times” or about the various experiences of indi¬ viduals within the family. She urges her readers to take these folktales seriously as valuable lessons on human behavior and as examples of living history. The first section of the collection consists of stories which Bambara said, “I wish I had read\n\nEssentially a collection of poetry, short stories, and essays by well-known writers (Nikki Giovanni, Kay Lindsey, Audre Lorde, Alice Walker, and Paule Marshall) and women students in the City College SEEK program, The Black Woman was a first of its kind in the United States, and Bambara, still writing under the name Cade, envisioned it as a response to all the male “experts” both black and white who had been publishing articles and con¬ ducting sociological studies on black women. Even the leading white feminists of the 1960s, Bambara felt, were not equipped to understand, much less to explain, the feelings and the situation of the black female. Hence, as editor Bambara selected items which she felt best reflected the thoughts and feel¬ ings of the many black women she had met while attending and participating in discussion clubs, work-study group meetings, and workshops both on college campuses and in local black communi¬ ties. While some of the poems and short stories aim to defuse and reject the popular myths and stereotypes of black women, other essays angrily challenge the traditional roles assigned to women by males within both the black community and the larger American society. In fact, one of the three essays Bambara contributed to the anthology, “On the Issue of Roles,” focuses on the fact that in many cases women working in black political action groups had not been allowed to participate on an equal footing with male workers in decision mak¬ ing. They had instead been relegated to “the unreal role of mute servant,” which was causing needless tension between black men and women who pre¬ sumably believed in the need to work toward social equality. She argued that the solution was to “let go of all notions of manhood and femininity and con¬ centrate on Blackhood.” Another of Bambara’s contributions to the anthology, “The Pill: Genocide or Liberation?,” outlines her opinion that birth control is not black genocide, but that it offers black women a means of becoming less vulnerable to black males’ idealistic notions of producing “warriors for the revolution.” The pill could help black women maintain control of their bodies and the peace of mind needed to take on new, social responsibilities. Bambara’s third contribution to the anthology was a reprint from Obsidian (October 1968). “Thinking About the Play ‘The Great White Hope’ ” evaluates the production in terms of its positive portrayal of black women and how they 15\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\nBambara’s fable “The Toad and the Donkey,” also in Tales and Stories, parallels Aesop’s “The Tor¬ toise and the Hare,” but Bambara’s version states that as a result of having lost the race to the slower toad, the donkey decided that he would never run a race again and “donkeys have been kind of stub¬ born about running ever since.” The obvious differ¬ ence between “The Three Little Panthers” and “The Toad and the Donkey” is that the latter does not contain a political message. It can be read for entertainment and as the type of folktale intended to explain the reasons why humans and animals behave as they do. Other stories Bambara included in this section of the anthology also avoid making political statements. The collection, therefore, offers a balance between readings which are enter¬ taining and those which are didactic. Most of the stories Bambara wrote as Toni Cade between 1959 and 1970, except for two tales in Tales and Stories for Black Folks, were published in October 1972 in what was to become her most wide¬ ly read collection: Gorilla, My Love. The stories in the collection focus on the relationships among Afro-Americans in both the urban North and the rural South. Eight of the fifteen stories in the collec¬ tion center on young children and adolescents as they move through their neighborhood learning about themselves while in the process of responding to their environment. Much of Bambara’s fiction is set outside of the home, on a sidewalk, in a movie theater, in a park or on an athletic field, in a local bar, or in a community center. Bambara’s charac¬ ters are rarely at odds with their geographical en¬ vironment, especially those described in the stories in Gorilla, My Love. They move through their im¬ mediate neighborhood comfortably familiar with the people and each building, street lamp, and fire hydrant they pass. Each of the characters in Gorilla, My Love exudes a street-wise sophistication, a confi¬ dence in “mother wit,” that helps him or her to intimidate immediate rivals. The most appealing story in Gorilla, My Love, and the best representative of Bambara’s style and technique, is the title story. Narrated in the first person by Hazel, a young girl who is completely fed up with “grown-ups messin over kids just cause they little and can’t take ’em to court,” the story describes the carelessness of adults who say things to Hazel and her brothers without realizing the effect of their words. The children are disappointed time and again because they expect adults to follow through on promises, no matter how long ago they were made. In each instance it is Hazel who shrewd¬ ly argues with adults, making them see just how\n\ngrowing up,” short stories by professional AfroAmerican writers such as Langston Hughes, Alice Walker, Pearl Crayton, and Ernest Gaines. Bam¬ bara included one of her own stories, “Raymond’s Run,” in this section also. The second half of the collection begins with Bambara’s “Rapping About Story Forms” which introduces her readers to the origins and characteristics of Afro-American fables. This section includes an English translation of a fable by the Senegalese Birago Diop and one by the Ghanaian James Aggrey, as well as several selec¬ tions written by students in a freshman composition course Bambara was teaching at Livingston College. Some of the students had been working with chil¬ dren in an independent community school, and Bambara had asked them to produce term papers that were useful to someone. As she explains it: “A great many of them took traditional European tales and changed them so as to promote critical think¬ ing, critical reading for the young people they were working with outside of the class.” As was the case with her first anthology, Bambara’s decision to in¬ clude student writings with those by older profes¬ sional writers shows her desire to give young writers a chance to make their talents known to a large audience. In addition, such a mixture in Tales and Stories for Black Folks would have helped her inspire young adults to read, to think critically, and to write. In following her own directives to her stu¬ dents, Bambara teamed with Geneva Powell, a black community worker from Newark, New Jersey, to write “The Three Little Panthers,” which she in¬ cluded in Tales and Stories for Black Folks. The story concerns three urban panthers who, having been sent on a survival mission in “the forest called the suburbs,” were continually harassed by antagonistic locals such as a rat, a vulture, a rabbit, an ostrich, an owl, and a fox. Refusing to conform to a suburban life-style, the only way they could have peacefully resided there, the panthers chose to return to their own neighborhood where they could work to sus¬ tain their own culture. While the obvious parallels to the original “Three Little Pigs” make the story predictable in terms of plot and dialogue, a cross burning, a bombing, and the panthers’ brandishing of guns when antagonists approach their house in¬ dicate the two authors’ preoccupation with the so¬ cial violence many blacks contended with during the 1960s and early 1970s. The story also obliquely criticizes those blacks who chose to be assimilated in order to live in American suburbs. Bambara and Powell imply that inner-city experience and en¬ vironment are potentially more fulfilling for blacks.\n\n16\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\nmuch they are responsible for the chaos their words create. Hazel is resolved to defend herself and her brothers from the carelessness of the adult world, but she is nonetheless a very loving and lovable character. Her fiesty nature enables her to triumph over her personal disappointments and to take on new challenges.\n\nshe has already made up her mind about what she will do and will not share her decision with her friends. The narrator is a much younger girl who sits on the sidelines listening to each woman state her philosophy of how to deal with men. She listens in the hope that when she “jumps into her woman stride,” she will not “have all this torture and crap to go through.” In this story Bambara focuses on a particular feature of the friendship among women: namely, the way in which intimate conversation with close friends (replete with confessions of past mistakes, hopes for future relationships, and les¬ sons learned) can help one to get over a personal crisis. This is what Bambara has termed “drawing the wagons in a circle,” a phrase she used to describe the protectiveness and sense of revitalization which can occur from such an encounter. Hence we see in this story that the inner resolve, the resiliency, and determination of her younger protagonists in Goril¬ la, My Love must be supplemented with the support of friends and family. When Gorilla, My Love was published, it re¬ ceived enthusiastic reviews. Lucille Clifton, herself a writer, said: “She has captured it all, how we really talk, how we really are; and done it with both love and respect.” Poet Mari Evans claimed that the stor¬ ies were “shavings off our Black experience—like chocolate. Bittersweet that is. . . .” And in a review published in the July 1973 edition of Black World June Jordan said in part that Bambara allowed her readers to turn away momentarily from issues of genocide, poverty, and other “alien factors” to “con¬ centrate on what we love and who loves us and how the family is and how the folks be managing, by our hilarious/sorrowing own self.” During the five-year span between 1972 and the publication in 1977 of her second collection of stories, The Sea Birds Are Still Alive, major events took place in Toni Cade Bambara’s life which were to have an effect on her writing. She visited Cuba in 1973 where she met with the Federation of Cuban Women as well as with women working in factories, on farms, in markets, and in parks. She was im¬ pressed, she said in an interview, with how Cuban women were able to resolve many class conflicts as well as color conflicts and to coordinate a mass organization. Their success at this, Bambara felt, “says a great deal about the possibilities here.” Another benefit she derived from her trip to Cuba was being made aware of how effective a creative writer can be in a political movement: “People made me look at what I already knew about the power of the word. ... I think it was in 1973 when I really began to realize that [writing] was a perfectly legiti-\n\nWhile the majority of the stories in Gorilla, My Love focus on the experiences of black women, many of the lessons they teach are universal. In one story, “Talkin ’Bout Sonny,” Bambara focuses on two males who struggle to cope with some very real but invisible force which threatens their mental sta¬ bility. The narrator, Betty Butler, is a social worker who is dating Delauney, a divorced father of two girls. The story is set in a local bar where Betty and Delauney are discussing their friend Sonny’s recent emotional collapse (“Something just came over me”) and stabbing of his wife. The narrator cannot understand the casualness with which Delauney is able to discuss the incident. As she reflects on her past observations of Sonny and Delauney, she real¬ izes that they are trying to contain a periodic rage, directed at no particular person, which they cannot fully explain. Delauney is at least able to describe the effect that the rage has on his and on Sonny’s behavior: “I can wake up not thinking anything in particular and all of a sudden it’s on me. A cloud of evil. A fit of nastiness takes over . . . that cloud of evil zooms in on you. . . . Fifty some odd days of pure shit jammed into one mad moment and boom — you plant a razor in your wife’s throat.” In short, Delauney knows he cannot help Sonny until he can help himself. Bambara seems to suggest that it is the overall pressure of living in modern society which triggers Sonny’s fits and Delauney’s evil moods, but there are questions raised in the story which are left unanswered; for example, now that Betty sees how precarious Delauney’s grip on his emotional state is, will she continue to be involved with him? Will she be able to live with the fear of what he might do to her or to his own daughters one day? “Talkin ’Bout Sonny” is one of Bambara’s more sobering stories in Gorilla, My Love as it is unrelieved by her usual moments of comic relief. Another important story in Gorilla, My Love is “The Johnson Girls.” Unlike the situation in “Talk¬ in ’Bout Sonny,” a character who is going through an emotional crisis (her boyfriend has left town without indicating that he is coming back) is sur¬ rounded by a group of her closest female friends, each of whom offers a plan of action to bring him back. While Inez obviously needs to have her friends around her and is listening to their advice,\n\n17\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\nsame community who opposed his power. The story focuses on Graham’s wife, Virginia, who, with their infant son in her arms, is on the way to visit her husband in jail. Flashbacks explain how she first met Graham and fell in love with him and his ideals. Basically a very quiet but hardworking and devoted woman, Virginia took on large responsibilities in community projects. After Graham’s arrest she realizes that her personal strength and the strength of their relationship is being put to a test, especially when she sees that much of what they had worked for has gone to ruin. By the end of the story Virgin¬ ia has paid a visit to the minister and vented her rage against what he had done, so that when she walks into the jail to see her husband, she is all the more determined that their work will continue and their marriage will endure. While the message Bambara wants to deliver is very clear, her tech¬ nique of juxtaposing time past with the present moment strains one’s patience in following the plot. Too many unexplained passing references are made to people and past incidents. Bambara received mixed reactions to “The Organizer’s Wife.” There were women who felt that the title was an insult, and other readers who said they would have liked to see Virginia leave town and her child die to show that she could not live or raise a child under a system which had separated her from Graham. In response to these suggestions Bambara argued, “What kind of a message would that have been? ‘The Organizer’s Wife,’ written in 1975 and set in 1975, is a love story, layer after layer. Lovers and combatants are not defeated. That is the message of that story, the theme of the entire collection, the wisdom that gets me up in the morning, honored to be here. It is a usable truth.” The title story of the collection, “The Sea Birds Are Still Alive,” is noteworthy because it fo¬ cuses on the people of Southeast Asia and allows us to see how Bambara portrays an ethnic group other than her own. The story is set aboard a boat which is transporting people caught up in the war to a larger city. As the narrator moves along the deck of the boat we see a country peasant, an old school¬ teacher, two women on their way to market their crafts, a soldier, refugees, and several foreigners (a female French news correspondent and an Amer¬ ican businessman), all of whom are thinking about the effect of war on their lives. The central charac¬ ters are a young girl and her mother who have been tortured by the imperialist forces, but who had been able to resist by chanting to themselves: “Nothing, I’ll tell you nothing. You’ll never break our spirits. We cannot be defeated.” Once in the city, the little\n\nmate way to participate in struggle.” Bambara visited Vietnam in the summer of 1975 as a guest of the Women’s Union. On this trip, she says she was impressed by “the women’s ability to break through traditional roles, traditional ex¬ pectations . . . and come together again in a mass organization that is programmatic and takes on a great deal of responsibility for the running of the nation.” She summed up her Vietnam experience by saying: “I got a certain amount of miseducation behind me and got a more serious kind of selfeducation. I got more deeply into community orga¬ nizing.” Hence, after having relocated with her daughter, Karma, to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1974, Bambara became more involved in those communi¬ ty activities which she had begun there before her trip to Southeast Asia. Concurrent with her teaching duties as writer-in-residence at Spelman College from 1974 to 1977, Bambara became a founding member of the Southern Collective of African-American Writers, and the Neighborhood Cultural Arts Center, Inc. She was also Director of the Pomoja Writers Guild, a founding member and officer of the Conference Committee on Black South Literature and Art, and an associate/aide of the Institute of the Black World. She was also the Designer and Program Coordinator of the Arts-inthe-Schools Project sponsored by CETA. The effect of Bambara’s travels abroad, her relocation to Atlanta, and her work in so many community art groups can be seen in the stories published in The Sea Birds Are Still Alive (1977). One notices that at least five of the stories are set outside of an urban center; the title story is in Southeast Asia. The characters in many of these stories move across greater geographical distances than did those in her first collection, and their immediate concerns are not so much with their personal rela¬ tionships as with their involvement in art groups, community centers, or sociopolitical organizations. “The Organizer’s Wife,” “The Apprentice,” “Bro¬ ken Field Running,” “The Sea Birds Are Still Alive,” and “The Long Night” all focus on the need for people in a community to organize and keep a spiritual faith in their efforts even during periods of major setbacks and “low consciousness.” In line with her belief in the inherent resiliency of a people involved in social struggles, all of the central charac¬ ters in these stories are combatants who have the strength not only to resist, but to inspire others in their circle to continue the fight. In “The Organizer’s Wife,” Graham, the com¬ munity leader, has been arrested by local author¬ ities after being reported by a minister from the\n\n18\n\nDLB 38\n\nToni Cade Bambara\n\ngirl will be put to work, but she, like some of the little girls in Gorilla, My Love, has shown throughout the story a capability to survive, despite her size. The emphasis in the story is on resistance rather than on despair, and it dramatizes Bambara’s belief in “the power of words, of utterances” to nourish one through trying situations.\n\nthermore, the reader seldom can determine where he is in time or place. The tale from whence the title comes is perhaps most frustrating in this regard.” Mary Helen Washington extolled two of Bambara’s stories, “Medley” and “Witchbird,” as excellent dra¬ matizations of the contemporary black American woman; however, she criticized all of the other stor¬ ies for displaying too much political ideology: “The trouble with deliberately creating models is that they slip all too easily out of character (who they are) into being mouthpieces for the writer’s ideology (who the writer would like them to be). It’s not that politics does not belong in the realm of art, but that some of the models Bambara offers are too predict¬ able (e.g. Naomi in ‘The Apprentice’).” Bambara herself commented to an interview¬ er that she felt that the stories in The Sea Birds Are Still Alive were too long: “To my mind, the six-page story is the gem. If it takes more than six pages to say it, something is the matter. So I’m not too pleased with the new collection, The Sea Birds Are Still Alive. Most of these stories are too sprawling and hairy for my taste, although I’m very pleased, feel perfectly fine about them as pieces. But as stories they’re too damn long and dense.” In several interviews and in an essay (“What It Is I Think I’m Doing Anyhow”), Bambara empha¬ sizes her preference for the short story as both a convenient tool for use in the classroom and in lecture engagements (she refers to them as “port¬ able”), and as an easier art fo"
