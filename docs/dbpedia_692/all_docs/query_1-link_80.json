        "text": "WARNING: This review contains spoilers for a 45-year old movie that you really should already have seen by now.\n\nI was obsessed with Alien for years before I ever saw it.\n\nThe film came out in the summer of 1979, the year I turned fourteen. I remember the remarkably effective ads on TV, featuring an unearthly egg, cratered like the moon (and looking nothing like the eggs seen in the movie, by the way) starting to hatch, accompanied by that immortal tagline: In space no one can hear you scream. Woo! Cue the tingling of the spine.\n\nAnd then I read issues of Omni magazine that featured articles and photos from the movie, showcasing designer H.R. Giger’s viscid creations: the ancient spacecraft shaped like a malformed horseshoe, slick corridors that seemed like the inside of a shark’s intestines, and the glutinous podlike eggs. There were no images of the alien* itself, of course, to limit spoilers, but what I could see was enough to get me hooked. This vision of spaceship that seemed more organic than mechanical was a kind of science fiction far removed from “Star Trek” and Star Wars.\n\nBut of course I could not see it then. At that time, I only went to the movies if someone in the family took me, and none of them was irresponsible to take me to a hard-R-rated horror flick, revolutionary visuals or no. And I wasn’t ready to see it, really; I was a bit too susceptible to the effects of horror movies and television. When I was a few years younger, I would eagerly watch “The Night Stalker” on TV, and then have to spend the night in my parents’ bed because I was too terrified to be alone. Later, after watching John Carpenter’s Halloween, edited and sanitized for TV though it was, I could not sleep a wink afterwards. So, even at 14, I was self-aware enough to know that I was not yet mentally prepared to see whatever horrible things the alien did to people.\n\nAt least, not on celluloid. In the local bookstore, I found a comic adaptation of the movie (by comic legends Archie Goodwin and Walt Simonson, though their names were unfamiliar to me at the time), which I paged through with eager hands. Later, I borrowed the book of film’s novelization, by Alan Dean Foster (the king of SF movie novelizations in the late seventies and eighties; he must have written about thirty of them), which prissily omitted all the profanity but kept all the slime and blood. These were poor substitutes for the actual movie, to be sure, but they kept me turning the pages.\n\nIt was not until my college years that I finally saw the film itself and, miraculously, it did not disappoint. Naturally, by that point I knew the plot backwards and forwards, down to the order that the crew of the space freighter Nostromo get picked off by the alien, but for the first time I could appreciate Ridley’s Scott’s masterful direction, with the suspense slowly ratcheting up through the first half as the crew land on a forbidding planet, investigate the derelict spacecraft, and then begin nosing among those alien pods, before turning up the horror factor as the alien goes on its killing spree. The visual design is key, not just with the organic derelict craft, but also with the Nostromo itself, whose interiors range from claustrophobic corridors to sterile medical labs to vast storerooms, all of which come across as sinister and unsettling places.\n\nAnother element that I could only appreciate by seeing the movie was the quality of the cast. This must be one of the best ensemble of actors to appear together in a horror film: Tom Skerritt, John Hurt, Ian Holm, Yaphet Kotto, Harry Dean Stanton, Veronica Cartwright, along with a little-known actress named Sigourney Weaver.\n\nWeaver’s Ripley, the film’s sole survivor (aside from Jones the cat) of the alien’s rampage, would become the character primarily associated with the Alien franchise — so much so that it’s hard to watch the movie and not see her as the heroine, whose survival is a foregone conclusion. However, she’s not actually played that way through most of the film. From the start, it’s Skerritt, playing the ship’s captain, who dominates the scenes and drives most of the action. Indeed, of all the cast, Ripley at first seems the most minor of characters. Certainly, Weaver was the least known of all the cast in 1979. In her early scenes, Ripley is officious and overly by-the-book, hardly what you’d call an action hero. But Alien is not an action movie.\n\nIn subsequent films of the franchise, Ripley is an action hero, most notably in James Cameron’s follow-up Aliens. There is much discussion in fan pages and movie review of which is better, Scott’s or Cameron’s movie, and more often than not (in the reviews I have seen) the consensus is that the latter is better, and the reason is often given that Cameron and Weaver made Ripley a true female action hero, a kick-ass woman armed to the teeth who could spit bullets and drop one-liners with the same panache as Stallone or Schwarzenegger.\n\nI have to say that my own preference for Alien over Aliens is actually for pretty much the same reason. I find the flawed, everywomannish Ripley of the first movie far more interesting than the blaster-toting badass of the second. Not, I hasten to add, because I have any objection to having female action heroes, but because I generally find “ordinary” protagonists more interesting than superheroes. (I never really cared much for those Stallone and Schwarzenegger movies, either.) In the latter part of Alien, right up through the end, Ripley is half-insane with fear, muttering to herself hysterically as she sets the Nostromo’s self-destruct sequence and runs for the escape pod. There’s no grandstanding “Get away from her, you bitch!” moment, and this makes the climax far more terrifying, and more real, than that of Aliens.\n\nI don’t want to give the impression that I disliked Cameron’s film; I think he did a great job of creating a sequel that respected the original but was not a simple retread. If it’s a bit more cartoonish in plot and characterization, it’s nonetheless engaging and entertaining. The same could not be said for any of the following sequels, Alien3 and Alien Resurrection. As for Scott’s 21st Century prequels, Prometheus and Alien Covenant, the less said the better. Not only are they filled with characters who make one stupid decision after another, but they provide answers to mysteries better left unsolved, with answers that are pretty stupid, as well.\n\nAlien really works best if you ignore the excess baggage of the extended franchise and watch it as audience watched it in 1979: a simple and economical tale of a truly nasty boogeyman in a spacebound haunted house.\n\n*Somewhere along the line, it became the norm in fandom to call the aliens “xenomorphs,” which I think is a ridiculous word, ugly in all the wrong ways. The term is never used at all in the first movie, so I will not do so here.\n\nStanley Kubrick’s 2001: A Space Odyssey can be considered the Citizen Kane of science fiction, in that it features a revolutionary visual style (a style matched with a bit of bravado, as if the director were saying “Look what I can do!”) that had an outsized influence on the movies that followed it. And, like Kane, it was controversial when it came out, and remains so to this day, with many people considering it arty and pretentious.\n\nThere’s no question that 2001 can be a difficult film to watch. It moves at a deliberate pace, not willing to speed up to satisfy those with short attention spans. The long and seemingly endless shots of spacecraft in motion can try the patience of the most ardent fan. When the movie was released in 1968, such sequences were intended to instill a sense of awe in the audience, giving them glimpses of space and future technology far beyond what had been seen in earlier sf films — though, even then, many viewers got restless waiting for something to happen. (Supposedly, Rock Hudson walked out of the premiere screening, muttering “What is this bullshit?”) In this day and age, when any hack moviemaker has access to technology far beyond that available to Kubrick and special effects director Douglas Trumbull, a modern viewer might well wonder what the big deal is. And where are the damned aliens already?\n\nObviously, given the fact that I’m including 2001 in my Ten Best list, I think the movie is still a big deal. I first saw it on TV when I was about fifteen. Catching the broadcast a small television, broken up by ads, is not of course the ideal way of seeing any movie, let alone 2001, which depends on its visuals for much of its power. Certainly, I didn’t fully appreciate the film until I saw it years later on the silver screen. But even on first viewing, I grasped that this was a very different kind of science fiction movie — or movie of any kind — than any I’d seen before. It was a story told elliptically, with images rather than words, with important elements (like those damned aliens) completely unseen, existing only in negative space.\n\nSoon after seeing the movie, I read Arthur C. Clarke’s novelization. Clarke was of course instrumental in the creation of the movie, which was inspired by his short story “The Sentinel.” Yet I found the book disappointing; it lacked the radical power of the film. And I realized that this was because the novel was (of course) told with words, which by their very nature make meaning explicit. In Kubrick’s film, as opposed to Clarke’s novel, the words are restricted to the dialog, which is mostly mundane and trivial. The movie’s meaning is implicit — which makes watching it both more difficult and more rewarding than reading the novel.\n\nI don’t want to fault Clarke too much. He remains one of the great sf writers of the mid 20th Century, with Childhood’s End being a classic that has not faded with age. And it must be said that his 2001 is far better written than your average movie novelization. But his narrative by its very nature takes away the very thing that makes 2001 the classic that it is. It’s like the Cliff’s Notes for the movie. (And don’t get me started on 2010: The Year We Make Contact, in which Clarke felt it necessary to explain exactly why the computer HAL went on a rampage. Some mysteries are better left as mysteries. Did Leonardo need to tell us why the Mona Lisa was smiling?) If you haven’t seen the movie yet (and why haven’t you?) wait until after you’ve done so to read the novel. In fact, wait a few weeks, or months, and let the movie percolate through your mind for a while before you pick up the book.\n\nI said before that 2001 has been an influential movie, and that is certainly true in so far as its design and visual effects. But really, I would argue that it hasn’t been influential enough. There have been very few movies since (certainly not mainstream ones) that have engaged their audiences with such a distinctive visual, non-verbal style. (Offhand, for American films, I can think of David Lynch’s Eraserhead and Terence Malick’s The Tree of Life. I may be the only person on Earth to have actually liked the latter. Or seen it, for that matter.) On the whole, 2001 was a giant step forward in the possibility of film, and it’s a pity that so few have followed up on it.\n\nLooking over what I have written here, I realize I’ve said precious little about the movie itself. Perhaps that’s just as well. The movie resists any kind of pat summary (“Oh, it’s about the evolution of humankind, the danger of artificial intelligence, and the pleasures of eating a decent meal!”) and seems lessened by any attempts to describe it.\n\nSee the movie on as large a screen as possible. Allow yourself to fall into its slow and inexorable rhythm. If you don’t get it, or you find it pretentious twaddle, then watch it again. Notice the themes that cross the various segments of the movie: Food. Tools. Murder. Intelligence. Sleep. Growth. Wonder. Things that link all of humanity from primitive hominids to angelic star-children. For all the starkness of its scenes in deep space, the movie is rich with meaning and life.\n\nAnd I dare you not to be moved when HAL sings “Daisy Bell.”\n\nThis if the first of a series of posts about my ten all-time favorite science fiction movies. Note that I do not claim that these are the best sf movies (though I think all of them are legitimately great), but the ones that, for whatever reason, push my particular buttons. I’ll be treating them in chronological order.\n\nI love 50’s science fiction movies, despite the fact that many if not most of them are terrible. Made in a decade that had a stick up its butt, they tend to suffer from a severe case of stodginess, with earnest humans (nearly always men) confronting menaces from beyond, either here on Earth or in what was then called “outer space.” Even the best sf movies from the decade — The Day the Earth Stood Still, Forbidden Planet, The Thing from Another World, It Came from Outer Space, and so on — carry this weight of stodginess with them. The tentacles of irreverence that were poking into the corners of popular culture — in, say, Mad magazine, “The Ernie Kovacs Show,” and the songs of Little Richard — never got their grasp on the Hollywood studios churning out endless movies about square-jawed heroes punching aliens in the face.\n\nInvasion of the Body Snatchers (from 1956) is the best sf movie of the decade not because it transcends that stodginess, but because it makes the stodginess work for it. Set in the small California town of Santa Mira, where everyone is white and middle class and totally square (the cast of characters includes children and adults, but no teenagers or twentysomethings), the movie depicts what happens when the residents are replaced one by one by alien pod people who are absolutely identical to the originals, except for being even more stodgy (having no emotions, desires, or dreams). While it was almost certainly not in the creators’ minds, one can see the pod invasion as an illustration of what Fifties conformity culture might be if carried to extremes.\n\nThe two protagonists, Dr. Miles Bennell (Kevin McCarthy) and his old flame Becky Driscoll (Dana Wynter) at first glance are as stiff and formal as everyone else in town. Miles is never without a coat and tie (except for the scenes when he’s in a bathrobe) and Dana swans about in a fancy strapless dress as she goes about her daily routine. But, significantly, they’re both divorced, an unexpected characterization for a time when divorce was considered morally questionable. And they’re both likeable people, generally interested in helping their friends and neighbors, which starts the plot rolling as they investigate what is starting a seeming outbreak of mass hysteria, when these friends and neighbors start insisting that their loved ones have been replaced by imposters. Soon enough, Miles and Becky find themselves surrounded by hostile creatures bearing the faces of their friends.\n\nThe direction, by Don Siegel (who would go one to direct the Clint Eastwood flicks Dirty Harry and The Beguiled, among others) is quite effective, considering the clear limitations in the budget. Body Snatchers starts off as a creepy mystery (what’s the cause of this seeming hysteria?). Then it becomes a horror movie, as Miles and Becky, and their friends Jack and Theodora (played by King Donovan and Carolyn Jones — yes, Morticia Addams) find first a blank, featureless body that slowly becomes a copy of Jack, and then (in a truly unsettling scene) a set of giant seed pods that disgorge frothy duplicates of all four of them in a truly unsettling scene. The final act of the movie is an exercise of true paranoia, as Miles and Becky realize they are the only two left in town who have not been assimilated, and try to escape with their souls intact.\n\nThere are many who prefer Philip Kaufman’s remake of 1978, which does have a lot to recommend it, including Donald Sutherland’s deft performance as the lead, Leonard Nimoy as a pop psychiatrist, and a lot of gooey visuals. (There were additional remakes in 1994 and 2007 which I didn’t see; I’m not sure anyone did.) Set in urban San Francisco, Kaufman’s version has a different feel and overall theme than the original (urban alienation vs. rural assimilation). I find myself preferring the simplicity and directness of the original; it’s far more terrifying to have your friends, rather than complete strangers, turn into soulless imposters.\n\nThe 1956 version is generally faithful to Jack Finney’s novel, but has (surprisingly for a Hollywood film) a more depressing ending. In the book, Miles and friends are able to defeat the aliens, and the pods end up leaving Earth. In the original cut of the movie, Miles is the only one in Santa Mira to escape the pods, and he ends up running up and down a freeway, raving like a maniac: “They’re coming! You’re next! You’re next!” The studio would not allow that to stand, however, and Seigel was forced to add a framing device in which Miles tells his story to a skeptical doctor (While Bissell, who appeared in half the sf movies coming out of Hollywood in the 50s), as word comes in that an overturned truck has spilled giant seed pods all over the highway. (Which is still a far cry from the book’s happy ending.)\n\nEver since the movie was released, there has been debate about its meaning. Do the pod people symbolize Communist infiltrators? Or McCarthyite demagogues? Siegel insisted that there was no political meaning, but of course no one had paid any attention to that. Honestly, the concept of friends and family taken over by an alien hive mind can be adapted for any age and political outlook; you could just as easily say the pod people are MAGA-ites, or the Woke. Conformity is in the eye of the beholder, I suppose.\n\nRegular visitors to my website, of whom I have none, will have noticed that (a) I haven’t posted anything in the better part of a year, and (b) I did recently make a slight change to the site banner, replacing the phrase “Playwright at Large” with “Writer at Large.” Behind that, my friends, lies a story.\n\nI have noted in a previous posts that being a playwright during a pandemic is not easy. The truth is, it’s no cakewalk being a playwright even when there isn’t a virus keeping people out of enclosed public spaces. Even before Covid-19 rang down the curtains on theaters everywhere, I had reached something of an impasse in my playwriting career. The only full-length play of mine that was getting any productions was Absence, and that hadn’t gotten any traction since its Italian revival in early 2019. I found that I was even having difficulty getting my shorter plays produced. I found it harder and harder to come up with ideas for writing plays, short or long. Not to put too fine a point on it, the magic had gone out of my dramatic writing.\n\nThe year-long shutdown of live theater thus seemed an opportune moment to reassess my writing career. I found that I still had the urge to write, but that urge was not pointing to the writing of plays. Rather, I found myself steering (or maybe being steered) back to my first love, fantastic fiction.\n\nWhen I first had the urge to become a writer, back in my early teens, it was not my aspiration to be a dramatist. No, what I dreamed of was to be a writer of fantasy and/or science fiction. (These were broadly referred to as “speculative fiction,” a term which always sounded awkward to me.) From an early age, I read a ridiculous amount of fantasy: I loved the work of J.R.R. Tolkien (of course), Lewis Carroll, Lloyd Alexander, Alan Garner, and many others. As I entered my teens, my tastes grew to include science fiction from soft to hard: Isaac Asimov, Philip José Farmer, Frank Herbert, and Philip K. Dick. I particularly liked the work of those authors who danced on the edge between the two categories, like Harlan Ellison and Gene Wolfe. I decided that I was going to be an f/sf writer myself.\n\nAnd yet that didn’t happen. Or at least it took a long time. I would start writing stories but get bogged down almost as soon as I started. Over the years, I would put my ambition away for a while and pursue some other vocation, but somehow I would always come back to writing. I felt like a writer, even if I wasn’t doing any of it.\n\nAbout twenty years ago, I finally put some effort into writing a few stories, and managed to complete some of them. I sent them out to various publishers, and they were promptly (well, sometimes not so promptly) rejected. And quite understandably; they were terrible. I wasn’t ready to be an s/sf writer yet, it seemed.\n\nI changed gears then, and tried writing for children. I wrote two books, one a comic fantasy and one a comic sf tale, that I thought were quite good. I sent them out to agents who did not share that opinion.\n\nIt was about then that I wrote my first short play, “The Little Death.” I brought it before the community theater group with whom I’d been working as an actor, and offered to direct it as part of their group of summer one-acts. (The was in 2005.) To my amazement, the board accepted it, and to my further amazement it did quite well. Having finally gotten some positive feedback on my writing, I plunged into my career as a playwright, getting many short plays produced at festivals, getting my M.F.A. in playwriting at Boston University, and then finally getting a production of my full-length play Absence at the Boston Playwrights’ Theatre in 2014. I seemed to have made it.\n\nBut I had not made it. Absence got a few more productions, but none of the other full-length plays of mine got any traction, and as noted above I started having less and less success with my short plays.\n\nAnd so I returned to my first love, fantastic fiction. (Wait, I said that already.) I started working on short stories, and quickly found the genre that worked for me: Darkly comic fantasies. (Perhaps not surprisingly, as most of my best plays fall under that category. A major exception is Absence which, being a serious tale about a woman suffering from dementia, is something of an outlier in my work.)\n\nI found, when rereading what I’d written, that I rather enjoyed it, and so began submitting my work to various print and online magazines with hope. For a long time, that hope seemed baseless; I kept receiving rejection after rejection. Well, that’s par for the course for a fledgling writer, I suppose. It didn’t help that there must have been thousands of fledgling writers around the world who similarly found themselves stuck at home with nothing better to do than pound out stories and send them off, so that the slush piles must have been even bigger (and slushier) than usual.\n\nAnd then one day the metaphorical sun rose on my new career: my novelette “On Milligan Street” had been accepted by the e-magazine GigaNotoSaurus.org, and would (will) be published by them on September 1. (Cheers and applause from the audience.)\n\nIt’s taken me forty years, but I’ve at last become an f/sf writer."
