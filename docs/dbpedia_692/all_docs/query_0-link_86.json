Their “mentor” is an abrasive, charismatic country singer/songwriter named Kyle Samperson. He humiliates some for their songwriting, personally offends some and clashes about politics with others. By the time Kyle turns up dead in Act Two, everyone has a motive for killing him. Snowed in, without internet or phone, the other characters size each other up and wonder whodunit.\n\nJudy Klass, Playwright, A. J. Campbell Producer Katy Blake, Director Clint Aphin as Brice Laurie Canaan as Roberta Lane Wright as Charlie Jack E. Chambers as Kyle Kathy Kerns as Martha Sophia Sutton as Tiffany Judy Jackson as Denise Alyssa Borg as Liz Robert Beard as Ed\n\nJudy Klass Bio:\n\nEight of Judy’s full-length plays have been produced onstage, including Country Fried Murder. Another full-length murder mystery of hers, Cell, was in a mystery festival in Kentucky, got nominated for an Edgar and is published by Samuel French/Concord:\n\nhttps://www.concordtheatricals.com/p/836/cell-klass\n\nMost of her plays are dramas and comedies. Thirty-six of her one-act plays have been produced onstage, many with multiple productions, all over the US, and a few have gone up in the UK and Ireland. Three will be produced in Canada in 2022. Three of her short plays are published, each as a stand-alone script, by Brooklyn Publishers. Others have appeared in magazines and in anthologies like Seven Hills Review and The Art of the One-Act. During the pandemic, Judy got involved more with podcasts, Zoom plays and streaming platforms; two of her short plays, A Different Kind of Strong and Tourists in Dystopia, are on The Shelter Plays platform: https://www.theshelterplays.com/current-productions Judy is from NYC and New Jersey, and she now lives in Nashville (since, like the characters in this play, she does write country songs!) and she teaches at Vanderbilt University.\n\nhttp://www.judyklass.com\n\nhttps://newplayexchange.org/users/5340/judy-klass\n\nAuthor’s Note: I wrote this play with a mystery festival in mind, but that festival disappeared during the Recession, and mystery plays can be hard to place. I am delighted, ten years later, to see Country Fried Murder produced at last, here at the Shawnee Playhouse. I have made it into a period piece, set in 2006, since it is of that moment – but there are parallels and connections between that moment and this one. I have one request to make of audience members. As with any mystery – after seeing the play, please don’t tell people whodunit!\n\nAbout the Quarantine Players\n\nProduced by A. J.

He makes up his mind to take the most “noble” course of action—whether Mari likes it or not. Part madcap comedy, part menstrual health PSA.\n\nThe play with an Iguana has a Sequel by Liz Dooley\n\nSince the last… adventure, Arthur the iguana has done everything in his power to research human biology so he doesn’t make any more big mistakes. Armed with his newfound information, he sets out to protect Mari from a new threat: himself. But was she ever really in danger? And is she actually any safer now? Part madcap comedy, part menstrual health PSA—part two. Followed by a talkback with the cast and writer/\n\nDirected by Monica Cross\n\nMonica Cross is a playwright and theatre maker in Gainesville, FL. She earned her Master of Letters and Master of Fine Arts from Mary Baldwin University (formerly Mary Baldwin College) in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and her Bachelors of Arts from New College of Florida in 2010. Her plays include “Cyrano on the Moon” (Tampa International Fringe Festival 2017, Minnesota Fringe Festival 2018, and Femme Fatale Play Festival 2020 on Zoom), Wonder of Our Stage (winner of The Players New Play Festival 2018, The Players Summer Sizzlers Series 2019), and The Aria of Julie d’Aubigny (Semifinalist O’Neill New Play Conference 2021 and American Shakespeare Center’s Shakespeare’s New Contemporaries 2021). She is a board member for the Acrosstown Repertory Theatre, where she heads their Homegrown Local Playwrights’ Showcase, and spearheaded their Sunday Sci-fi Serials project online in 2020. This is her third time directing for Quarantine Players. She is a proud member of the Dramatists Guild of America and her work can be found on the New Play Exchange.\n\nDirector’s Statement:\n\nSometimes we put on plays because they have an important message, sometimes we put on plays because of their sheer entertainment value, but it is always an absolute delight to work on a play with both. “This Play Has an Iguana for a Protagonist” and “The Play With the Iguana Has a Sequel Now” are absolutely that! Liz Dooley finds a way to discuss the stigma and misinformation around discussions of menstrual health through the perspective of a pet iguana named Arthur. As Mari, Arthur’s Human, points out: as a reptile, it’s a stretch to assume an iguana would automatically know what a period is. So this play does an outstanding and hilarious job of explaining menstruation in a way that would be appropriate for your closest reptilian friend. Dooley highlights how avoiding topics that we might feel are “awkward” leads the way for misinformation to creep in and take hold. So check out “This Play Has an Iguana for a Protagonist” and “The Play With the Iguana Has a Sequel Now” to set the record straight. Also, we have puppets!\n\nAbout The Playwright, Liz Dooley\n\nLiz Dooley is an asexual- and female-identifying theatre artist based in Atlanta.

A wife’s betrayal has consequences. Treachery, however, benign sometimes ends in tragedy. And the truth… well who really knows what good can come of it? Brandon is having an affair with Annie, Arthurs wife. Arthur comes home from work one day to find his younger brother and wife alone again in the apartment. Has he always had his suspicions? Later that week, Arthur escorts his young wife to an on-stage production of his new work about a younger brother having an affair with the older brother’s wife…and someone gets murdered.

Written by Emma Goldman-Sherman.\n\nFrom the director: Whorticulture is a play that confronts the dark truth of being raised a girl within rape culture. Throughout the process, I had the privilege of working with a team of three phenomenally smart and talented women on a play that is not only empowering but also challenging and complex. It is rare to find a play in the theatrical canon written just for women, let alone one that so deftly handles themes of sexual violence, abuse, and survival while still maintaining a strong sense of humor.\n\nEmma Goldman-Sherman has distilled what being a young woman is like in the age of social media. She affirms the pain of growing up against a backdrop of the male gaze while also upholding the strength of young women to endure and to grow. The dizzying journey from childhood to womanhood is captured completely by Goldman-Sherman, who never shies away from the harsh and violent realities of life. What she captures at the heart of the play is the irreparable harm of sexualizing girls in childhood, a specter that hangs over the life of every woman. The rise of the #MeToo movement in 2017 shook the foundations of America’s media culture, and brought sexual harassment and violence to the forefront of the national conversation. It has become increasingly difficult to ignore allegations of abuse and harm, a reckoning that was a long time coming in Hollywood and beyond.\n\nThe #MeToo movement asks us to interrogate celebrity culture and those we look up, as well as investigate the ways sexualization and patriarchy have harmed our own lives. Women’s voices, and the voices of all those harmed by sexual violence, are now taking center stage, as we begin a collective effort to reframe the ways in which rape culture has been able to shape our narratives. Whorticulture, like Framing Britney Spears and Allen V. Farrow, explores power, our understandings of familial abuse, and how young people articulate trauma and pain. I am incredibly thankful to Emma Goldman-Sherman, AJ Campbell and the Quarantine Players for programming this work in 2021 and equally as grateful to the team at The Tank for giving it a second life. I’d also like to thank the team at Theatrical Intimacy Education, whose training in theatrical intimacy was invaluable to me during this process. This show was made by an all woman creative team and cast who were hard-working, generous, and remarkable. When we sat together and interrogated the ways in which the play spoke to us, not one of us could remember a time before we held hostage by the male gaze. Rape culture is pervasive and sinister, and it is the work of all of us to fight for a better future. To all survivors of sexual violence: you are seen, you are heard, and you are believed. Thank you. Sophia Menconi – Director\n\nThis is the story of a couple that has broken up who gets caught at a resort during a storm and now has no choice but to face the ghosts of the past relationship. Both come clean in a hilarious, high-stakes autopsy of their failed relationship.\n\nOriginal Concept by Matthew Garlin & Samantha Davekos\n\nWriting Supervision by Rebecca Greene\n\nDIRECTOR’S NOTES\n\nSometimes (maybe most of the time) a first love, that one that got away, leaves an indelible mark that shapes all future relationships. Matthew Garlin gives us a deep dive into one such relationship when David and Jessica are forced to share a hotel room during a storm. As these two rehash their four-year relationship, we see not only why they didn’t work but also why they did. In their reminiscing, I think audiences will find reflections of their own romantic past. Those times when you fell hard and fast and got a little scared of it; those times when you thought you were a clear communicator only to find out the message the other person was getting was complete gibberish; those times when you realized that you had hurt someone just as much as they had hurt you. These are the moments that shape and define us from that point forward, and as we watch Jessica and David come to terms with the “what was” and the “could have been,” we are invited to reflect on our own relationships and how they shape who we are now.\n\nHope you enjoy the show!\n\nMonica Cross\n\nDirector\n\nOne-Time\n\nMonthly\n\nYearly\n\nMake a one-time contribution to help keep our good working going.\n\nMake a monthly contribution\n\nMake a yearly contribution\n\nChoose an amount\n\n¤5.00\n\n¤15.00\n\n¤100.00\n\n¤5.00\n\n¤15.00\n\n¤100.00\n\n¤5.00\n\n¤15.00\n\n¤100.00\n\nOr enter a custom amount\n\n¤\n\nYour contribution is appreciated.\n\nYour contribution is appreciated.\n\nYour contribution is appreciated.\n\nSubmitSubmitSubmit\n\nA.

Gary lives with Eytan, who was Kay’s high school best friend; now Eytan and Kay hate each other. Eytan and Gary write humorous songs which Gary sings as a character called Ovaria Strange. Kay considers drag to be misogynist: a caricature of women – a kind of minstrel show. Eytan considers Kay a humorless feminist spouting tiresome theory and jargon, ridiculously teaching African-American studies when she’s white, (which is also a kind of minstrel show, he argues), though Kay is married to Curtis, who’s black, and Eytan has a problem with Kay teaching Women & Gender Studies when (he contends) she’s too uptight and homophobic to talk to college kids about gender.\n\nDirected by Lori Muhlstein\n\nProduced by A. J. Campbell, Quarantine Players\n\nMusical Director Mikayla Trimpey\n\nMusical Arrangement: Matthew Scarborough\n\nOur Cast\n\nSara Lucchini\n\n(Kay) Sara Lucchini is an East Coast native who migrated West to the sun and sea of San Diego 8 years ago. She last performed on stage in La Jolla Playhouse’s WOW Festival with Blindspot Collective’s Hall Pass, and has been grateful for the opportunities to continue to perform safely via Zoom in Quarantine Player’s Spooky Saturday, Wildly Successful Theatre Company’s Guilty Party, and others. Sara looks forward to returning to the stage and wishes everyone safety and sanity in the meantime!.\n\nTrevor Butler\n\n(Curtis) Trevor Butler is an alumnus of the School at Steppenwolf in 2014, and the Conservatory of Performing Arts at Point Park University in 2016. Being grateful is an understatement for him making his debut with The Quarantine Players as Curtis in The Politics of Fabulousness. AJ Campbell is a treasure of a producer, Lori Muhlstein is a prayer of a director, and Judy Klass is a blessing for this heaven-sent play he’s been gifted to be a part of.\n\nCameron Lee Conlan\n\n(Gary and Ovaria Strange) Cameron Lee Conlan has been performing since the age of twelve when he starred as Lysander in his school play. Since then he has trained in musical theatre, Shakespeare, improv and stand-up comedy. Some of his credits include Dauntless in “Once Upon a Mattress”, Jack in “Into the Woods”, Iago in “Othello”, Frank-n-furter in “The Rocky Horror Show”, Rooster in “Annie” along with stand up appearances in NYC at the Greenwich Village Comedy Club, Broadway Comedy Club, and performing in the “YAS Queer Comedy Fest”.\n\nMichael K. Young\n\n(Eytan) Mike is very happy to be working with the Quarantine Players in The Politics of Fabulousness. He really enjoys playing an argumentative asshole in this show, a part he plays all too often in real life. Mike has decades of improv theatre experience and has performed with a number of community theaters in Virginia. Mike has previously been seen in Diamonds to Die For, Dead Tuesday, Fatal Error, Glengarry Glen Ross, and Urinetown The Musical.\n\nDirector’s Notes\n\nI was drawn to this play because while it explores the necessary and critical issues of our time, it all comes down to the need for family, acceptance, understanding, and love. These are things basic to every human experience and the characters in this play are no exception. It also shows us that like people, relationships are complicated and flawed and sometimes don’t work out the way we hope. You’ll learn a lot from the dialogue, you’ll be touched by the humanity of the people (and wonderful acting by our players), and thoroughly entertained by Ovaria Strange. Thank you Judy and Quarantine Players for entrusting me to direct this reading. Thank you, Cameron, Sara, Mike, and Trevor for your talent to bringing it to life.

After years of failed fertility treatments and then finding out they are not eligible to be adoptive parents due to Della’s medical history, both embark on their own individual quests to achieve the goal they both believe will bring them the true fulfillment and the happiness they’ve been missing. Each keeps their plan secret from the other- but the hidden costs of their journeys eventually overwhelm their relationship. The consequences of their choices come to fruition and leave them longing for another, less treacherous path.\n\nJACOB DANIEL SINCLAIR\n\nDIRECTOR’S NOTE:\n\nWhat would you do for the person you love most? This is the central theme for couple Della & Jim Young in this new play by Emily McClain. I was drawn in by this seemingly simple, yet complicated, question that drives these two characters and the decisions they make. As humans, we tend to block out threats to our own self when it comes to family or the loved ones we hold most dear; almost as if we are invincible. Unfortunately, invincibility is not achievable. But the beauty of Emily’s play is that it asks us to think about what love and compassion really is for each other: Is it selfish? Selfless? Without fault? Does it makes us blind to what’s directly in front of us? As Della & Jim struggle to have the life and family they’ve both been craving – putting themselves in positions that risk both of their lives, what emerges is the human need to find happiness. Pure and unfiltered happiness. In this brutally honest and comedically-dark re-imagining of THE GIFT OF MAGI, Emily has created a rich cast of characters who, tragically, fight for their life with deep ferocity, who struggle to see the dangers ahead of them, who will go as far as possible to have the life they want for their love – come to to find that maybe they’ve gone too far.\n\nJACOB DANIEL SINCLAIR (Director) Previous credits include HAMLET (Edinburgh Fringe Participant), Freak Show (also writer), Life is a Dream.

The Quarantine Playres are a scrappy theater start-up who is in a position to break all the rules. We were told we can’t put out new work all the time. Yes, we can you just have to treat playwrights like we matter, make them part of the process and value our input.\n\nWe are your source for new plays from amazing playwrights. Each week we choose a new play to read for you. We are diffferent because we involve the playwright in every step of the process. Most of our writers will attend all the rehersaals and provide feedback along the way. We don’t just honor playwrights by waiting till their work goes into the Public domain so we don’t have to pay them. We prefer our playwrights to still have their pulise.\n\nLet’s make theater together."
