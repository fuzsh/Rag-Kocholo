Her books, published by Riverhead Books, include a novel, If You Lived Here, You’d Be Home By Now, which the Los Angeles Times named one of the best books of 1997, Depth Takes A Holiday: Essays From Lesser Los Angeles, and Aliens In America. The latter is based on Loh’s solo Off Broadway show which ran at Second Stage Theatre in New York in summer, 1996. Loh has also been featured at the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, the HBO New Writers Project, and on NPR’s “This American Life.” She is also a regular commentator on NPR’s “Morning Edition,” a show which coincidentally has used segments from Pianovision as buttons.\n\nCurrently, Loh is most musically active as a composer for film. She composed and performed on the score for Jessica Yu’s 1997 Oscar-winning documentary Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark O’Brien, and is scoring Ms. Yu’s next documentary on HBO of the Living Museum.

In “Self Promotion” (March 1988), an assistant flung $1,000 in autographed $1 bills over her as she performed before a stampeding crowd. “Spontaneous Demographics” (September 1987) featured Loh playing a piano abord a flatbed truck in a concert for rush hour commuters on the Harbor Freeway.\n\nAliens in America (Second Stage, 1996)\n\nBad Sex with Bud Kemp (Second Stage, 1998)\n\nSugar Plum Fairy (Seattle Repertory Theatre, 2003)\n\nA one-woman show about an ungainly 12-year-old girl who longs to dance the role of Clara in “The Nutcracker.”\n\nLanguage Will Be Used (Mark Taper, 2004)\n\nThis is not for the faint of heart.
