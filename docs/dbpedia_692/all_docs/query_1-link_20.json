Each of the producing theaters demonstrated superlative ethical standards in supporting the livelihoods and careers of writers.\n\nWriters Alliance Grants are an innovation on DGF’s previous theater program, which has supported theaters for 50 years. Writers Alliance Grants are awarded in celebration of working relationships that align deeply with DGF core values. These grants reflect DGF’s commitment to ensuring writers’ contributions to theater are respected and to changing the national conversation about how writers are treated by the institutions that produce their work.\n\nApplicants were selected via committee on the strength of their contracts, the artistic merit of the project for which they are requesting funding, and the organization’s commitment to the production of new works and voices.\n\n“After 55 years of giving to nonprofit theaters, our Board has restructured our former Theater Grant program into the Writers Alliance Grants. These awards honor our commitment to nonprofit theaters and give direct funds to the writers enriching their communities across the country.

Mr. Hager succeeds former Vice President, award-winning composer, lyricist, and playwright Carol Hall (Best Little Whorehouse in Texas). “First, Kevin Hager said ‘Yes!’ to DGF and now he’s saying ‘Yes!’ to accepting the duties of Vice President of the Board. I can think of no greater member of our organization to work with, side by side, as DGF heads into its most exciting phase yet.” – Andrew Lippa, President\n\nServing on the Board of Directors since 2010, Mr. Hager serves as the Chair of the Board Development and Succession Committee.“We are so fortunate to have Kevin join our Board’s leadership cabinet. He brings years of experience in strategy and results in nonprofit management and a deep passion for the theater. We know he will help take DGF to the next level in achieving our ambitious goals.” – Rachel Routh, Executive Director\n\nKevin Hager is currently the Managing Director of Understood.org and Vice President and Chief Digital Officer of the National Center for Learning Disabilities (NCLD). In these roles he oversees all fundraising, communications, and online strategy and engagement. He led successful efforts to significantly increase total fundraising for the organization while simultaneously diversifying funding streams and increasing unrestricted revenue. Working with several of the top website, social media, PR, and strategic planning experts in the country, he led the process of creating a comprehensive, forward-thinking plan to scale the organization’s brand and more effectively engage key audiences. This resulted in the creation of a new, fully-funded, online strategy and engagement department overseen by Mr. Hager.\n\nPrior to his work at NCLD, he managed the creation of the Center for Service Learning at the University of Kansas. Mr. Hager then moved into political campaigns, serving as the press secretary for a DCCC “Top 10 Race” and ultimately as campaign manager for a large municipal campaign before moving to New York to serve as the development director of DoSomething.org.\n\nDGF Special Event: Dear Evan Hansen\n\nSOLD OUT!\n\nJoin us on May 31st to see Tony nominated, Golden Globe and Academy Award winning musical theater duo Benj Pasek and Justin Paul‘s hit Broadway musical Dear Evan Hansen!
