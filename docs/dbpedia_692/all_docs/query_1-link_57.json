        "text": "LETTER FROM OUR ARTISTIC DIRECTOR\n\nSussing out the truth in a pile of lies seems to be a national hobby these days. We are in a moment of uncovering, of chasing the truth—and the truth runs really fast sometimes. It’s necessary to question, to uncover the reality that has been lurking under the surface, and to reconcile our own complicity in these lies. But beware, our familiar lies have a beguiling comfort making the truth the unfamiliar, the unknown—and the unknown is unsettling. How do we move forward if there isn’t agreement on the truth?\n\nI love this play for its surreal ingenuity, its bonkers nimbleness, and the loving way it chases the truth. Kate Cortesi reveals a relationship at the moment of change, a friendship that is deeply loving and deeply flawed. This delicious beastie called Is Edward Snowden Single? is full of Kate’s unflinching, hilarious and heartfelt pursuit of truth. Once we know the truth, perpetuating lies is a choice to hurt others in our world.\n\nWe are also chasing the unknown these days—actually, we are living in the unknown. COVID has laid bare many questions of its own, and the impact is enormous on human lives, not to mention livelihoods. For Theatre artists—the questions of how exactly to pivot (ugh, that word) to virtual performances, as well as the unknown of when performances will return to the stage loom large. There are so many Theatre artisans, craftspeople, designers, technicians, staff and creators that are not working due to the pandemic. I miss you and I miss the skills and experience you bring to this craft.\n\nI am grateful for the chance I had to be in a virtual room with some amazingly intrepid folk, and I look forward to the day when we can be together again in an actual room. My respect and admiration for my collaborators has grown tenfold throughout this process. The actors you see on screen have had to wear many hats—literally and figuratively. They have had to assume more roles than the ones you see them play on your screen—I thank you, Isabella, Becca & Eric for upending your lives to bring these characters to life. I thank the amazing production team that discovered answers to questions that had never before been on our horizons, I thank the Jungle staff with whom invention becomes the everyday, and I thank you—our audience, our families, our community. Your support of new work is necessary and appreciated. Here’s to making the unfamiliar familiar, and here’s to chasing the truth.\n\nCHRISTINA BALDWIN\n\nInterim Artistic Director\n\nLETTER FROM THE PLAYWRIGHT\n\nQuestion: What do oat milk espresso beverages, public bathroom quickies, and Rosa Parks all have in common?\n\nAnswer: They’re in my play Is Edward Snowden Single? And yeah, it’s a stretch.\n\nBut—a powerful stretch!—a life-bolstering stretch!—hopefully?—like one you’d feel in an excellent yoga class. (As opposed to one that causes bridges to tumble into the sea.) But instead of stretching your body, this play wants to stretch, well, everything else: your mind and your heart; your sense of humor and moral certitude; maybe even your assumptions about what a night at the theater can be. And now, in the winter of 2020, the play’s virtual reality is a reach I didn’t anticipate but one I gladly join you in making. Christina Baldwin’s astonishing screen adaptation has expanded our way of coming together in this art form.\n\nEdward Snowden demands real elasticity from its actors, as well. Two leading women embody nineteen different roles in a workplace morality tale that lurches, slows, drops and loops at the whiplash tempo of a rollercoaster. Sometimes the actors play a scene “straight.” Other times they co-narrate for the audience, bickering about what comes next. And then there are the love scenes with Edward Snowden himself, who may or may not be an adorable puppet.\n\nAs the play’s author, I cop to being stretched beyond my comfort zone writing the script. Aiming to create something that feels bit like stand-up, a bit like a drinking game, and a bit like going to confession, I often got lost in the wilderness of those early drafts. Is this bombastic piece playing too fast and loose? But wouldn’t slowing it down kill it? And are these dumb jokes funny, or just… dumb? Because, in this play, while silliness abounds, our ultimate project is deadly serious. Okay, maybe not quite deadly. Unless you count the death of the soul as mortal stakes. Which, for what it’s worth, I do.\n\nOf all the play’s elastic contortions, this stretch between silliness and utter seriousness is perhaps the riskiest. Thank you for trying it at home.\n\nNext year, in the room together.\n\nKATE CORTESI\n\nPlaywright\n\nOur Values\n\nSTORIES MATTER\n\nBecause we believe in the power of live theater to interrogate and celebrate our shared experience, we create work that helps our audience make meaning of the world and deepen connections with each other.\n\nARTISTRY IS A HABIT OF ATTENTION\n\nBecause we believe that exquisitely crafted theater makes us feel more alive and calls to our highest potential, we pursue beauty in our work by practicing care and attention to detail in all that we do.\n\nA PLAY ISN’T COMPLETE WITHOUT AN AUDIENCE\n\nBecause we see our audience as our final collaborators, and because we believe meaningful encounters demand intimacy, we strive to make the Jungle a place where all are welcome and everyone is home.\n\nA GREAT THEATER CARES FOR ITS PEOPLE\n\nBecause the work we make and share depends on human time, labor, and love, we are committed to being good to one another. This means we challenge one another creatively, value each other’s time and talent, and collaborate in a spirit of good will and abundance."
