        "text": "Students select two tutorial courses each semester from a wide range of options. A tutorial is a weekly meeting of one or, very occasionally two students, with the tutor responsible for a particular area of study. The tutorial is a creative and flexible teaching method that enables the teacher to adapt a course to the precise requirements of a particular student, and to give that student individual attention and supervision.\n\nAt the weekly meeting with each tutor, the student normally presents a formal essay, based on reading in primary and secondary sources. The tutor will point the student to the most important books and articles relevant to a topic, while also encouraging initiative and judgement in their selection.\n\nThe preparation and writing of an essay is a time-consuming and exacting process, so the student must be prepared to devote the greater part of each week to this work. The purpose of this exercise is not merely to test a student’s ability to amass facts, but to develop powers of critical analysis so that they can identify and interpret significant information and present facts and conclusions in a clear and precise form.\n\nBrowse the comprehensive list of tutorials currently available.\n\nAmerican Studies\n\nArabic\n\nArabic\n\nTutorials are available in both Modern Standard Arabic and Classical Arabic. The nature of the tutorial will depend on the level and needs of each individual student.\n\nNote that Arabic is offered only at intermediate and advanced levels, not for beginners or near-beginners. You will be asked to clarify your linguistic skills during the admissions process.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nChinese\n\nChinese\n\nTuition in Chinese can be arranged to accommodate a wide range of needs and interests.\n\nNote that Chinese is offered only at intermediate and advanced levels, not for beginners or near-beginners. You will be asked to clarify your linguistic skills during the admissions process.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassics\n\nAlexander the Great in Manuscript Arts from the Medieval to the Early Modern Periods\n\nThis tutorial course is going to dwell on a single figure—Alexander the Great, or Iskandar Maqdūnī (the Macedonian) as he is known in Persian—in select manuscripts produced across Central Asia and Central Europe in the medieval (1000-1500) and early-modern (1450-1750) periods. Alexander was significant in different ways to different dynasties administering different regions and in different eras. Different versions of his biography had different appeal, and at different times. By associating themselves with the hero, different rulers emphasized different facets of Alexander in their patronage of manuscripts.\n\nIn addition to being a part of popular culture and common knowledge for millennia, Alexander’s recounted exploits have particularly resonated with royals and nobles sitting in English through Indonesian courts. The course highlights a few select illustrated texts—produced between the 13th through 16th centuries—in Greek, French, Latin, Armenian, Turkish, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. It is essential to consider each text within its own tradition, but placing them together also allows for a broader geographic and chronological scope that can also produce interesting comparisons of cross-cultural and trans-imperial significance.\n\nSessions will explore the interplay of a narrative’s ancient (often imagined) past taking place in the Greek Empire (ca. 4th century BCE), with the accreted layers of time periods in which the illustrated text is produced, read, or seen. Dwelling on Alexander’s reception in various courts and dynasties professing Christian and Islamic confessions (Franco-Flemish, Italian, Byzantine, Mongol, Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, Abu’l-Khairid [Uzbek]), the course challenges the binaries of east and west, Christianity and Islam, through the universal appeal of the famous world conqueror. It will be of interest to students of literature, art history, religious history, culture and translation studies, medieval and early modern cultures, European and West/Central/South Asian history.\n\nSample Topics\n\nAlexander as interpreted in the oldest texts and contexts: Greek, Syriac, Latin language sources, Biblical and Qur’anic versions.\n\nNew Persian and Old French—European Medieval traditions (13th-14th centuries) and early Persian literary versions (in the Shahnama, ca. 1010)\n\nAlexander in the Byzantine and Mongol realms (13th-14th centuries.\n\nAlexander in the Islamicate (Ottoman, Iranian, and Central Asian) realm (15th century), Turkish and Persian versions.\n\nAlexander in the Islamicate (Ottoman, Iranian, and Central Asian) realm (16th century), Turkish and Persian versions.\n\nWhy Alexander? The appeal of superheroes.\n\nTrip to the Weston Library to view manuscripts ((European and Turco-Persianate copies of the Alexander Romance).\n\nTrip to British Library in London to view Old French Alexander manuscripts owned by Henry VIII, and Persian manuscript versions.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAncient Greek\n\nAncient Greek is offered at every level, including beginners. It involves the study of grammar, syntax and readings from classical Greek literature. The precise nature of the tutorial will depend on the skills and needs of each individual student.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAthens, Sparta, Persia\n\nThis course explores the history of the Greek states - especially Athens and Sparta - during the fifth century BCE. This was a period of political rivalry and experimentation within Greece, and a series of confrontations and/or negotiations with the massive might of the Persian Empire. This period is deeply engaging in itself, and has exercised a perennial fascination in subsequent thought, not least because of the historical writings of Herodotus and Thucydides.\n\nSample topics\n\nThe polis\n\nThe Persian Wars\n\nPersians and Greeks\n\nThe Delian League and the Peloponnesian War\n\nComedy, tragedy and Athenian politics\n\nHistoriography: Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon\n\nArt and architecture\n\nEconomic life\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAugustus to Hadrian\n\nThis course explores the history of the Roman Empire from the first emperor, Augustus (died 14AD), until Hadrian (117-138AD). It considers political, social, cultural and economic questions, as well as foreign wars and diplomacy, during the height of the Empire’s power and prestige. Sources include writings by Tacitus, Suetonius, Josephus and Pliny (read in translation), complemented by material evidence such as Trajan’s column, Hadrian’s wall, and the buried city of Pompeii.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassical Art and Architecture\n\nOne of the most enduring legacies of the Classical Age was the contribution to art and architecture made by the Greek, Hellenistic, and Roman worlds. This course brings together the full range of visual and material culture that survives from these periods to examine an array of themes, set against the wider historical and archaeological context of continuity and change in the Mediterranean basin and beyond.\n\nIn these tutorials a range of artistic media may be studied, including statuary, relief sculpture, funerary monuments, mosaics, wall paintings, painted vases, jewellery, gems, coinage, and buildings. The uses of image, expressions of identity and power, and cultural influence and change are just a few of the themes which will be explored through an examination of the styles and traditions seen to have developed in the use of these materials.\n\nIn particular, buildings are some of the most impressive and best preserved ‘artefacts’ from the ancient world, and whose design was highly symbolic of the society within which they were built. From palaces, temples, and public buildings such as stoas, fora, basilicas, and bathhouses, to domestic buildings, the technology, materials, styles, ornament, and functions of Classical architecture provide substantial insight into ancient daily life, class structures, identity, and the culture of display.\n\nThe Ashmolean Museum (in central Oxford, five minutes’ walk from St Michael’s Hall) has a world-class array of artefacts which can be seen first-hand and might be brought into tutorial discussions, including in particular their collection of painted vases, and also the contents of the Cast Gallery, which houses plaster copies of many important sculptural monuments from the period.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassical Latin\n\nThis course involved the careful study of grammar, syntax and readings from classical Latin literature. It is possible to take this at any language level, including beginner. Students’ level will be assessed as part of the pre-arrival process.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassical Philosophy\n\nThis course charts the development of classical western philosophy from the Athenians to Augustine of Hippo, exploring the principal writers in their intellectual and historical context. At the core of this course is reading key works in translation. The cornerstones of the western intellectual tradition are scrutinised in terms of the specific questions they address, and read as part of a continuing narrative in philosophical culture.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nPlato, Republic, Symposium\n\nAristotle, Nicomachean Ethics, Politics\n\nPlotinus, Enneads\n\nProclus, Elements of Theology\n\nMarcus Aurelius, Meditations\n\nLucretius, De rerum natura\n\nAugustine, Confessions, City of God\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassical Political Thought\n\nThis course covers the political thought of the ancient world, from Classical Athens to the Roman Empire. This period saw the formulation of fundamental elements in political thought: the state, justice, citizenship, notions of democracy, aristocracy and monarchy, and the concept of politics in itself. At the end of the period, Augustine of Hippo integrated elements of classical political thought into his Christian theology. Key thinkers are explored with reference to their historical and intellectual context.\n\nSample topics\n\nPlato, The Republic\n\nPlato, The Laws\n\nAristotle, Politics\n\nEpicurean political thought\n\nCicero’s political thought (On Duties and other texts)\n\nSeneca’s political thought\n\nAugustine, The City of God\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassical Religion\n\nThis course explores the religions of the ancient Greeks and Romans. It considers religious myths, beliefs and practices in the context of the history and cultures of the classical world. Readings include some of the most powerful texts produced in the ancient world, including those by Homer, Virgil and Ovid (in English translation).\n\nSample Syllabus:\n\nAncient religion: an overview\n\nThe gods in Homer\n\nGreek tragedy and the divine\n\nLyric poetry and divine inspiration\n\nPhilosophers and religion\n\nThe Aeneid and Rome’s gods\n\nOvid: the Metamorphoses and the Fasti\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nClassics Special Topic\n\nIt is sometimes possible to arrange teaching in classics beyond the tutorials listed. This provides the opportunity to explore a subject in classics in depth, through one-to-one tutorials and writing weekly essays.\n\nThis will usually be of interest to students who have already taken classes in classics, and have a specific interest that they wish to pursue, and/or a specific requirement that they need to fulfil.\n\nPlease note that this is subject to agreement by both the programme and the applicant’s home institution. Applicants should contact the Senior Tutor directly to discuss this possibility.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGreek Epic\n\nThe earliest texts of Western literature were created in performance by illiterate bards, and yet they offer richness and complexity in their storytelling, characterisation and moral outlook. The Iliad explores the tragedy and glory of being a hero, with martial frenzy, but also pathos and forgiveness. The Odyssey responds to the Iliad and contrasts with it, incorporating fantasy, folktale and realism, and building up to the dramatic climax of Odysseus’s revenge against the suitors of his wife Penelope.\n\nTexts:\n\nThe Iliad\n\nThe Odyssey\n\nSample topics:\n\nDivine spectators and domestic dramas on Olympus\n\nForeshadowing, flashbacks and the structure of the Iliad\n\nGods, heroes and morality\n\nMortal women and goddesses\n\nThe heroism of Hector and Achilles\n\nThe epic simile and formulaic structures\n\nStories and story-tellers in the Odyssey\n\nThe Trojan War in history and archaeology\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGreek Historical Writing\n\nThe most influential ancient Greek historians are studied from a literary perspective, with the emphasis on the presentation of their narrative and the characters in it. Thucydides and Xenophon were writing about their own time, while Herodotus’ epic ‘Histories’ explores the Persian wars in the light of the distant past, with many suggestive parallels between past and present.\n\nTexts\n\nHerodotus, Histories Book 3\n\nThucydides, The History of the Peloponnesian War Book 3\n\nXenophon, Anabasis Books 1-4\n\nSample topics:\n\nLeaders and leadership in historical narrative\n\nThe function of digressions in history-writing\n\nHistorians’ understanding and presentation of war\n\nReligious issues and the depiction of the gods\n\nThe use of speeches in historical narrative\n\nHistorians’ concept of research and their presentation of their sources\n\nThe extent to which women are a marginalised group in historical narrative\n\nThe treatment of foreign cultures by Greek historians\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation.

However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGreek Lyric\n\nThe lyric poetry of the Greek city-states of the Archaic period embraces a great variety of styles, with performance ranging from the public realm to the intimate setting of the symposium. The poems address themes from the very personal and intimate to the great questions which face the state.\n\nTexts:\n\nSemonides, Sappho, Alcaeus, Theognis, Solon and Anacreon from M.L. West, Greek Lyric Poetry\n\nPindar Olympian 1 and Pythian 1\n\nSample topics:\n\nSemonides portrayal of women in Fragment 7 in the context of its time\n\nThe personal and introspective nature of Sappho’s poetry\n\nSappho and Alcaeus’ use of Homeric themes\n\nTheognis on men, gods and morality\n\nSolon’s political poetry\n\nAnacreon’s use of style, structure and form to convey experiences\n\nThe theme of excellence in Pindar’s victory odes\n\nPindar’s use of myths\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGreek Tragedy\n\nGreek tragedy is a genre that exemplified the artistic achievement of Athenian democracy in in the fifth century BCE, from the victory over the Persians at Marathon to the Peloponnesian War. The plays were performed to the citizens of this radical democracy and engaged with themes which were at the heart of the state. However, they went beyond politics to address fundamental questions about ethics, religion, and the gods. In the Frogs Aristophanes makes fun of Aeschylus and Euripides, but he makes a serious point, too: it is through watching plays and thinking about them that men become better citizens.\n\nTexts:\n\nAeschylus, The Oresteia\n\nSophocles, Oedipus the King, Antigone\n\nEuripides, Medea, Electra\n\nAristophanes, Frogs\n\nSample topics:\n\nThe theme of justice in the Oresteia\n\nMortals and gods in the plays of Euripides\n\nThe role of the chorus in Greek tragedy\n\nThe theme of leadership in Greek tragedy\n\nWomen in the family and state\n\nThe individual, family and the state\n\nThe mythical past and fifth-century Athens\n\nThe audience’s expectations of tragedy in the Frogs\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nLatin Literature of the First Century BCE\n\nThis course examines Latin literature in the first century BCE, universally regarded as a high point in Roman culture, with authors such as Lucretius, Cicero, Catullus, Virgil, Horace, Propertius. Major themes include the influence of preceding Greek literature, the place of women in society and texts, questions of politics, patronage and power, and the relation between Latin literature and philosophy and religion. The ‘book’ both as a technological and artistic fact is also an important area of interest in the period. These key authors also of course provoke study of more purely literary matters: questions of style, imagery, symbolism, allegory, convention, originality and so on.\n\nSet texts:\n\nLucretius, De Rerum Natura 1\n\nCicero, Pro Archia\n\nCatullus, 64 and 68\n\nVirgil, Eclogues\n\nHorace, Odes 3\n\nPropertius 4\n\nTopics:\n\nThe Eclogues and the politics of their time\n\nLucretius: poetry and philosophy\n\nWhat Cicero’s Pro Archia tells us about the value of poetry in his society or about being a Greek in Rome\n\nThe role of the poet in these texts\n\nThe landscapes and people of Italy in literature of the 1st century BC\n\nThe moral outlook of these texts\n\nCatullus’ use of myths\n\nDifferent approaches to love\n\nNote that there is no language requirement for this course: texts are studied in translation. However, for students with the required language skills it is also possible to study these texts in the original. Please contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nNew Testament Greek\n\nThis course covers the grammar, syntax and vocabulary of New Testament Greek. It is possible to take this at any language level, including beginner. Students’ level will be assessed as part of the pre-arrival process.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nRepublic to Principate\n\nThis course examines the history of Roman state and society from the final decades of the republic to the establishment of Augustus’s regime. This was a period of tremendous social, political and military confrontations, as the republic overcame external opponents, while consuming itself in internal conflict. It also saw tremendous intellectual creativity, and students are able to explore writings (in translation) by public figures such as Cicero, Caesar and Sallust.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nRoman Historical Writing\n\nThis course explores history as a literary genre and examines its presentation of events and characters through description and speeches. Caesar wrote about his own experiences campaigning in Gaul, and his presentation of these events was intended as much to further his ambitions as to provide an account for posterity. Sallust and Tacitus drew on sources to record events from the past, but the present time and its political controversies were never far from their minds.\n\nSet texts:\n\nLivy, Book 1\n\nTacitus, Annals Book 15\n\nCaesar, The Gallic War Book 7\n\nSallust, The Jugurthine War\n\nSample topics:\n\nThe treatment of myths and the distant past\n\nThe presentation of war in Roman historians\n\nAttitudes towards foreign people and cultures\n\nHistorians’ presentation and treatment of their sources\n\nHistorians’ use of rumour and hearsay and their presentation of conspiracy\n\nThe presentation of different social classes\n\nThe presentation of the role of women in historical events\n\nThe characterisation of protagonists\n\nHistorians’ attitudes to political questions\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nVirgil's Aeneid\n\nVirgil’s ‘Aeneid’ describes the epic journey of the Trojan hero Aeneas to found a new race in Italy. The epic owes much to the Iliad, Odyssey and other literature, but also reflects the concerns of Augustan Rome. Aeneas’ doomed love-affair with Dido in Book 4 is an emotional climax, while Aeneas’ visit to the ghosts in the Underworld looks forward to the eventual greatness of Rome. The gods are constantly present, as they are involved in forging the destiny of the Romans.\n\nSample topics:\n\nMasculine and feminine points of view\n\nThe poet’s use of characterisation to tell his story\n\nReligion and the gods\n\nThe role of cities\n\nThe presentation of death and the significance of the Underworld\n\nTrojan, Roman and Greek culture and values\n\nThe structure of the epic\n\nThe morality of war\n\nThere is no language requirement for this tutorial: all texts are taught in English translation. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it can be taught through the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nComparative Literature\n\nEpic Tales of Rivalry. Non-European Encounters in Iberian Epic Poetry and New World Plays (1500‒1700)\n\nThe early modern Spanish and Portuguese literary traditions contain a wealth of epic poems inspired by the classical Greek and Latin epics of the likes of Homer, Virgil and Ovid and by recent historical events related to crusade, conquest, and empire building. There are also a number of Spanish and Portuguese plays by Gil Vicente, Miguel de Cervantes, Lope de Vega, Ricardo de Turia and Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz that deal with the relationship between the Iberian Peninsula and the Spanish and Portuguese colonies in India, Africa, and the New World. Collectively, these works explore aspects of cultural exchange and conflict that arose from the encounters of conquistadors, pioneers and governors with other cultures, races and religions. By choosing to study a selection of these texts, students will explore how early modern Spain and Portugal related to the peoples that they encountered, and they will discuss the multiple perspectives held on issues relating to crusade and conquest. The module aims to challenge some of the long-standing assumptions made about colonization and empire building and re-evaluates the texts through a postcolonial lens where appropriate.\n\nSample topics:\n\nRace and Religion in Luís de Camões’s Os Lusíadas.\n\nConfrontation between the Portuguese and Ottaman Empires in Jerónimo Corte-Real’s Segundo cerco de Diu.\n\nPatriotism and Sympathy in Alonso de Ercilla y Zúñiga’s Araucana.\n\nPortrayals of the Indigenous in Pedro de Oña’s Arauco domado.\n\nThe Exploits of Hernán Cortés in Gabriel Lasso de la Vega’s Mexicana.\n\nNon-European Encounters in the Final Voyage of Sir Francis Drake in Lope de Vega’s La Dragontea.\n\nEuropean Quarrels in a New World Context in Lope de Vega’s Brazil restituído.\n\nMedieval Religious Conflict in Gaspar García Oriolano’s Murgetana.\n\nAllegory and Symbolism in Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s El divino Narciso.\n\nA good number of the texts to be studied are available in English translations and, therefore, knowledge of Spanish and Portuguese is not a prerequisite for the course. However, if you do have the relevant language skills then it should be taught using the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nIntroduction to Middle English\n\nThis course studies selected verse and prose in Middle English, from the later middle ages. These can include ‘Patience’, ‘Pearl’, ‘Sir Gawain and the Green Knight’, ‘Piers Plowman’, ‘Saints’ Lives of the Katherine Group’ and ‘Ancrene Wisse’.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nIntroduction to Old English\n\nThis is an introduction to Old English language, including grammar, syntax and vocabulary, using readings from the corpus of Old English poetry and prose.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nMiddle High German\n\nThis course studies the language of Middle High German, though medieval texts such as the ‘Parzifal’. Students must have at least high intermediate modern German before taking this course. The precise nature of the tutorial will depend on the skills and needs of the individual student.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nOld French\n\nThis course studies the language of Old French, though medieval texts such as the ‘Chanson de Roland’. Students must have at least high intermediate modern French before taking this course. The precise nature of the tutorial will depend on the skills and needs of the individual student.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nSocial and Sexual Transgressions in Late Medieval and Early Modern European Literature (1200‒1700)\n\nThe literature of late medieval and early modern Europe is replete with social and sexual transgressors who have often been overlooked by scholars. This course explores a range of characters on the margins of social and sexual acceptability in order to re-evaluate preconceptions held about matters of gender, sexuality, and social roles in the period 1200–1700. It places particular emphasis on issues of homosexual desire, sexual trickery and seduction, and progressive female characters and writers. Students may choose to study a selection of literary texts in the areas of prose, the short story, poetry, and drama.\n\nSample topics:\n\nSaints and Sinners in Alfonso X’s Songs of the Virgin Mary.\n\nSexual Escapades in Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron.\n\nThe Outspoken Wife of Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales.\n\nForthright Women in Gil Vicente’s Farce of Inês Pereira.\n\nSexual Seduction and Trickery in Juan Ruiz’s The Book of Good Love.\n\nGo-Betweens and Sorceresses in Fernando de Roja’s Celestina.\n\nTransgenderism and Transvestism in António Ferreira’s Bristo.\n\nSexual Misbehaviour and Deceptions in Marguerite de Navarre’s Heptameron.\n\nHomosexual Desire in Richard Barnfield’s The Affectionate Shepherd and Cynthia.\n\nThe Female Rogue of Francisco López de Úbeda’s The Lives of Justina.\n\nSwindlers and Tricksters in Francisco de Quevedo’s The Swindler.\n\nImmorality Exposed in Francisco de Quevedo’s Dreams and Discourses.\n\nFemale Agency in María de Zayas’s Amorous and Exemplary Tales.\n\nThe Strong-Willed Nun of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s The House of Trials\n\nThese texts are available in English translations. However, if you do have some of the relevant language skills then the course can also be taught using the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nEconomics\n\nEnglish and American Literature\n\nBritish Children's Literature\n\nThis tutorial examines British children’s literature from its origins in early printed books through to the present day. The study of children’s literature serves as a testing ground for important questions about the acts of imaginative empathy demanded by literature, and the ethics of authorial influence. It also allows us to interrogate the assumptions we make about children and childhood, especially as connected to innocence, playfulness, naivety, freedom and creativity. We will explore primary texts in detail, and analyse some of the critical frameworks which help us to negotiate the relationship between adult and child, including narratology, postcolonial theories and feminist critiques.\n\nThere are three interrelated possible strands to our work in this tutorial. We may explore the origins of children’s literature in fairy tales and folklore (including in translation) and the development into print; the notion of ‘childhood’ as a concept, especially in the period between Locke and Rousseau; and the mature genre of children’s literature which makes up a canon of modern classics. Throughout we will interrogate themes of universal importance to the study of modern literature such as familial relationships; travel and displacement; interaction with the natural world; friendship; adolescence and coming-of-age; magic and mythology; education and psychological development; religion and morality.\n\nSample texts might include:\n\nJohn Locke, Some Thoughts Concerning Education (1693)\n\nIsaac Watts, Divine and Moral Songs for Children (c. 1715)\n\nWilliam Blake, Songs of Innocence and Experience (c. 1789)\n\nJohn Ruskin, The King of the Golden River (1841)\n\nLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland (1865)\n\nRobert Louis Stevenson, Treasure Island (1881)\n\nOscar Wilde, The Happy Prince (1888)\n\nRudyard Kipling, The Jungle Book (1894), Just-So Stories (1902)\n\nBeatrix Potter, The Tale of Peter Rabbit (1902)\n\nFrances Hodgson Burnett, A Little Princess (1905)\n\nKenneth Grahame, The Wind in the Willows (1908)\n\nRosemary Sutcliffe, The Eagle of the Ninth (1954)\n\nRoald Dahl, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (1964)\n\nPhilip Pullman, Northern Lights (1995)\n\nProhibited combination: this tutorial cannot be taken alongside the Inklings tutorial or seminar.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nBritish Travel Writing\n\nThis tutorial explores the rich seam of British travel writing from the eighteenth century to the early twentieth century. This was a period when changes in transport technology, political circumstances, and cultural attitudes, allowed people from the British Isles to travel as never before: within Britain, across Europe, and the wider world. The genre of travel writing flourished in these circumstances. Notable examples include Lady Mary Wortley Montagu Turkish Embassy Letters (1716-1718), Samuel Johnson, A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland (1775), Charles Darwin, The Voyage of the Beagle (1839). Travel also became a major preoccupation in fiction, for instance with Jonathan Swift, Gulliver’s Travels (1726), or Joseph Conrad, Heart of Darkness (1899).\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nChaucer\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer (c.1340-c.1400) was the most important author to write in Middle English. This course delves into works from all periods of his life, ranging across genre and style, including celebrated classics such as ‘Troilus and Criseyde’ and ‘The Canterbury Tales’, as well as less familiar writings. Chaucer’s style, his politics, his erudition, and his comedy are explored within the contexts of fourteenth-century literary culture. Close readings of individual texts are built into a consolidated survey of his lasting achievement and the legacy he bequeathed to future generations of writers.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nThe early dream visions\n\nselected prose writings\n\nTroilus and Criseyde\n\nThe Legend of Good Women\n\nThe Romance of the Rose\n\nThe Canterbury Tales\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nChivalric Literature\n\nDuring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, chivalry developed as a distinct set of sensibilities within the western European elite. Chivalric values were martial, Christian, noble, and masculine. They did not remain static, but over time became increasingly highly elaborated, more courtly, and more intensely Christian. These social and cultural attitudes were formulated, explored and at times critiqued in the epic and romance vernacular literature of this period, in particular the Arthurian cycle, and the Matter of France. This course explores that literature in social and cultural context.\n\nSample Topics\n\nLa Chanson de Roland\n\nMarie de France, Lais\n\nChrétien de Troyes, Arthurian Romances\n\nRaoul de Cambrai\n\nWolfran von Escehenbach, Parzival\n\nGottfried von Strassburg, Tristan\n\nThe Poem of The Cid\n\nThe Lancelot-Grail Cycle\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nComedy\n\nThe course explores the many types, styles and intentions of comedy in the western European literary tradition, from the earliest Greek and Roman examples of the genre, through the transformations made in the Renaissance by Shakespeare, to the ‘classical’ variants found in Jonson and Molière. Individual works are studied for their own merits as well as the light they shed on the evolution of comedy as a force in culture.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nAristophanes, Clouds, Lysistrata\n\nMenander, The Girl From Samos\n\nPlautus, Miles Gloriosus\n\nTerence, The Eunuch\n\nShakespeare, The Comedy of Errors, Much Ado About Nothing\n\nJonson, Volpone\n\nMolière, The Miser\n\nIntroductory Reading:\n\nBevis, M., Comedy: A Very Short Introduction.

This course will consider some of the major themes and authors of the period from around 1980 to the present day, but can be focused on any aspect that interests tutor and student.\n\nSample themes\n\nRealism and modernism\n\nPostmodernism\n\nHyperrealism\n\nSelf and society: family, class, art, politics, sport\n\nFeminism, queer theory, gender and sexuality\n\nScience, technology, and ethics\n\nRace, ethnicity, nationality, and culture\n\nHistorical fiction\n\nInternationalism/Multiculturalism/Post-Colonialism\n\nHistory and trauma\n\nThe primacy of narrative/imagination\n\nSample works\n\nPeter Ackroyd: Hawksmoor\n\nMartin Amis: London Fields, Time’s Arrow\n\nJG Ballard: Crash\n\nPat Barker: The Ghost Road (from The Regeneration Trilogy)\n\nJulian Barnes: Flaubert’s Parrot\n\nAS Byatt: Possession\n\nAngela Carter: The Bloody Chamber\n\nJonathan Coe: What a Carve Up!, The House of Sleep\n\nMargaret Drabble: The Gates of Ivory (from The Radiant Way Trilogy)\n\nRussell Hoban: Riddley Walker\n\nAlan Hollinghurst, The Swimming Pool Library\n\nKazuo Ishiguro: Never Let Me Go; The Unconsoled\n\nDoris Lessing: The Good Terrorist\n\nPenelope Lively: Moon Tiger\n\nHanif Kureishi: Buddha of Suburbia\n\nIan McEwan: Black Dogs, Atonement\n\nWG Sebald: Rings of Saturn\n\nMuriel Spark: A Far Cry from Kensington\n\nGraham Swift: Waterland: Shuttlecock; Ever After\n\nJeanette Winterson: The Passion; Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit\n\nFilms\n\nPatrick Keiller: London; Robinson in Space; Robinson in Ruins\n\nMike Leigh: Naked\n\nStephen Frears: My Beautiful Laundrette\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nCourtly Love\n\nThis course delves into the Medieval European convention of courtly love, or amour courtois, as it was first labelled by Gaston Paris in the nineteenth century.\n\nSample Syllabus\n\nAndreas Capellanus, On Love\n\nThe Romance of the Rose\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, dream visions: Book of the Duchess; Parliament of Fowls\n\nGiovanni Boccaccio, Il Filostrato (translated approximately as “laid prostrate by love”).\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, Troilus and Criseyde\n\nChristine de Pizan, The Letter of the God of Love.\n\nChrétien de Troyes, Yvain, the Knight of the Lion; Lancelot, the Knight of the Cart.\n\nGottfried von Strassburg, Tristan and Isolt\n\nPetrarch (Francesco Petrarca), Il Canzoniere (The Song Book)\n\nModern construction of medieval Courtly Love tropes: C. S. Lewis, The Allegory of Love\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nDrama\n\nThis is creative writing course for those who want to write drama. The student works closely with the tutor on producing dramatic writing, with special emphasis on designing plots, planning structure and executing dialogue for plays. Some study of the history of dramatic composition is included, although the focus is on the nurturing and development of the student’s own skills and capacity to produce original work.\n\nSample Syllabus:\n\nThe weekly syllabus is determined by the student’s own submitted samples of writing. Each week a new submission is required – either a stand-alone play or section of a longer dramatic work-in-progress, or possibly a reflection on the practice of writing drama. The tutor’s detailed feedback then provides the basis for the following week’s assignment.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nEighteenth-Century Fiction\n\nThe emergence in the eighteenth-century of a new form of writing known as the novel was perhaps the most significant and distinctive change in modern English literature. Now often taken for granted as a pre-eminent literary mode, the early novel by contrast was a source of debate and anxiety about issues of morality, propriety, sentimentality, and about the dissemination of the literary arts for mass consumption.\n\nEighteenth-century fictional prose writing served as a testing ground for experimental new modes, from autobiography, narratives of slavery and servitude, religious conversion testimonies and confessional writings, to bawdy, comedies of manners, erudite theology, natural philosophy, and what we now recognize as the fully-fledged modern novel. Changing conceptions of literary authority as well as innovative narrative and rhetorical techniques allowed British authors to develop new modes of fiction which reflected the experience of a vastly expanded readership across the English-speaking world.\n\nThe course explores the first practitioners of the novel, examining their experimental fictions in wider literary and cultural contexts. It also explores the sources and influences which contributed to the development of the early novel.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nDefoe, Robinson Crusoe, Moll Flanders\n\nSwift, Gulliver’s Travels\n\nRichardson, Pamela\n\nHenry Fielding, Joseph Andrews, Tom Jones\n\nSarah Fielding, David Simple\n\nSmollett, Peregrine Pickle\n\nSterne, Tristram Shandy\n\nBurney, Evelina\n\nWollstonecraft, Mary: A Fiction\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nEighteenth-Century Poetry and Drama\n\nThe dramatic modes, styles and intentions of the long eighteenth century are properly initiated in the years following the Restoration of 1660. As the Augustan era moved into the age of sensibility and pre-romanticism, the poets and playwrights of the eighteenth century responded to the evolving manners and concerns of their age with wit, style and charm, sometimes lyric, sometimes satiric, producing some of the most memorable literature in the English language.\n\nSample Topics\n\nVanbrugh, The Provok’d Wife\n\nCongreve, The Way of the World\n\nGay, The Beggar’s Opera\n\nPope, The Rape of the Lock, Essay on Man\n\nThomson, The Seasons\n\nJohnson, The Vanity of Human Wishes\n\nSheridan, The Rivals\n\nGray, selected verse\n\nCollins, selected verse\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nEnglish Renaissance Literature\n\nThe English Renaissance is a term that has traditionally been applied to literature produced in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, although this course considers writing from the wider early modern period (c.1485-1688) written both in English and in contemporary translations from continental literature. Discussions about the poetic imagination, about identity (including gender identities, religious and political identities, and the relationship between self and group identity), and about the social and cultural impact of the literary and dramatic arts loom large across the period. Authors to study might include William Shakespeare, Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe, Henry VIII, Aphra Behn, John Milton, Andrew Marvell, Francis Bacon and others.\n\nSample genres\n\nSonnets from Wyatt to Milton; lyric verse; pastoral; formal verse satire; epic, epyllia.\n\nRomance; pamphlets; essays; travel (and fantasy) writing; literary criticism; political philosophy; translations.\n\nExploring renaissance drama in all its variety. In the words of Shakespeare’s Hamlet: “Tragedy, comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical, historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or poem unlimited.”\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nEnglish Special Topic\n\nIt is often possible to arrange teaching in English beyond the tutorials listed. This provides the opportunity to explore a field in depth, through one-to-one tutorials and writing weekly essays.\n\nThis will usually be of interest to students who have already taken classes in English, and have a specific interest that they wish to pursue, and/or a specific requirement that they need to fulfil.\n\nPlease note that this is subject to agreement by both the programme and the applicant’s home institution. Applicants should contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this possibility.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGothic Nature\n\nThe rise of gothic fiction in the latter part of the eighteenth century was part of a cultural and artistic revaluation of traditional conceptions of our relationship to the natural world. As Augustan notions of an ordered and benevolent Nature were challenged by the political realities of British life, including population growth, expansion of urban environments and greater awareness of global geographies, the natural world was increasingly figured as a place of sublime and even supernatural power. This course uses eighteenth and nineteenth century notions of the sublime as a starting point for exploring British writers’ vexed connections to a landscape which inspires both awe and horror.\n\nSample Topics may include\n\nTheories of the sublime from Addison to Kant\n\nRomantic sublimity and the Alps\n\nHabitations and hauntings: Graveyards, ruins and ‘eternity’ in the poetic imagination\n\nThe Gothic wilderness in the novels of the Brontes\n\nThe sublime city\n\nTurner and Thomson, Young and Blake: Illustrating the Romantic Landscape\n\nHorror and dystopia in the natural world\n\nSpots of Time: The psychology of the Gothic landscape\n\n‘Natural Supernaturalism’: Uncanny Landscapes\n\nGothic medievalism and the British Isles\n\nGothic landscapes and the monstrous feminine\n\nEcogothic: politics of Gothic Nature\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nIntroduction to Middle English\n\nThis course studies selected verse and prose in Middle English, from the later middle ages. These can include ‘Patience’, ‘Pearl’, ‘Sir Gawain and the Green Knight’, ‘Piers Plowman’, ‘Saints’ Lives of the Katherine Group’ and ‘Ancrene Wisse’.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nIntroduction to Old English\n\nThis is an introduction to Old English language, including grammar, syntax and vocabulary, using readings from the corpus of Old English poetry and prose.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nJane Austen\n\nDespite her relatively short life, the six major novels written by Jane Austen, between 1775 and 1817, have secured her standing as one of the most significant and best loved of English novelists. This course situates her work within the wider historical and literary contexts, making reference to the Gothic and epistolary traditions, Romanticism, the French Revolution, and Mary Wollstonecraft’s proto-feminism. It complicates assumptions about Austen’s politics, encouraging students to read her as a subversive and innovative author, and asks questions about her style. In addition to the novels, this course also looks at Austen’s earliest work, which was unpublished in her lifetime, and her more recent cultural legacies.\n\nSample Topics\n\nNorthanger Abbey\n\nPersuasion\n\nSense and Sensibility\n\nPride and Prejudice\n\nMansfield Park\n\nEmma\n\nSanditon\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nMedieval English Drama\n\nThe world of the medieval English stage meshes humour, violence, music, oratory, academic debate, and visions of human tenderness in pursuit of artistic, theological and ethical aims in both the spiritual and material realms. Although critically neglected, English drama before Shakespeare is sophisticated, self-reflexive and creatively meta-theatrical. Before the construction of professional theatres, plays were performed in spaces - both public and private - which were not exclusively “theatrical” but also domestic, religious, legal and commercial. Dramatic performances exploited the boundaries between art and social context, drawing the audience into the world of the play whilst foregrounding its irony and unreality. The course will explore early drama in all its variety: morality and miracle plays, mystery cycles, liturgies, farces, masques, mummers, minstrelsy and more!\n\nCore texts:\n\nYork Mystery Plays, ed.

Fletcher (Cambridge University Press)\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nMedieval English Mystics\n\nSome of the most profound and extraordinary spiritual works of the middle ages were written in England during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. A combination of often horrifically troubled times, the desire for new forms of religion and a new immediacy of relation with God, and socio-economic and literary change contributed to the complex and fascinating picture; but these mystics were very remarkable individuals in their own right, and advocated very different approaches to Christian living and experience. This course therefore exploresnot only of their writings, but also of the context in which they arose.\n\nSample Syllabus\n\nLiterary & Historical Contexts\n\nRichard Rolle’s Fire of Love\n\nRolle’s English Writings and Wider Influence\n\nThe Cloud of Unknowing\n\nDionise Hid Divinite and Other Cloud-related Treatises\n\nWalter Hilton, The Scale of Perfection\n\nJulian of Norwich, A Revelation of Love\n\nMargery Kempe and her Book\n\nIntroductory Reading\n\nWatson, N., ‘The Middle English Mystics’, in Wallace, D.

These are studied alongside major works in the European tradition, such as Old French and Middle High German Arthurian romances, in order to achieve the broadest possible coverage of the subject and its suggestive interrelations.\n\nSample Syllabus:\n\nSir Gawain and the Green Knight;\n\nChrétien de Troyes, Arthurian Romances;\n\nHartmann von Aue, selections\n\nGottfried von Strassburg, selections\n\nThomas Malory Morte Darthur\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nMedieval Travel Writing\n\nThis course examines examples of travel writing from various medieval European languages. Medieval people travelled widely, for a variety of reasons: trade, diplomacy, religious pilgrimage, the lure of the unknown. Some wrote fascinating accounts of their travels and adventures. These narratives are accompanied by accounts of purely imaginary voyages, and of fantastical peoples, kingdoms and marvels.\n\nSample Topics\n\nThe Travels of Sir John Mandeville\n\nMarco Polo, Travels\n\nThe Travels of Ibn Battuta\n\ntravel writings of Petrarch\n\npilgrimage narratives\n\nIntroductory Reading.\n\nAgapitos, P.A. and L.B.

This course studies the poetic modes and genres which established his reputation to include lyric, masque, tragedy and epic, and seeks to put this achievement in literary and historical context.\n\nSample Topics\n\nLycidas\n\nSamson Agonistes\n\nNativity Ode\n\nIl Penseroso\n\nL’Allegro\n\nComus\n\nAreopagitica\n\nSonnets\n\nParadise Lost\n\nParadise Regaine\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nModern British Drama\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century, theatre dominated the performing arts and encompassed a great variety of forms. Rapidly evolving stage technologies, and the development of film, radio and television have fundamentally changed the role of theatre in society and the kinds of works written for it. We will explore the nature of these changes and examine the unique aesthetic power of live performance. We will also consider television and radio drama, which (especially in the first thirty years of the BBC) was often intended to be live and not recorded.\n\nThis course consists of six broadly chronological strands and the course can be tailored to draw exclusively or mainly from one strand or be a combination of several.\n\nStrand A. Early twentieth-century theatre\n\nFor example:\n\nJM Synge: Playboy of the Western World\n\nRC Sherriff: Journey’s End\n\nModernist theatre: TS Eliot, Murder in the Cathedral\n\nAuden and Isherwood, The Dog Beneath the Skin; The Ascent of F6.\n\nChristopher Fry: The Lady’s Not for Burning\n\nNoel Coward: Private Lives; Blithe Spirit\n\nStrand B. The theatre of the Absurd\n\nFor example:\n\nSamuel Beckett: Waiting for Godot, Krapp’s Last Tape; Happy Days\n\nTom Stoppard: Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead; Travesties\n\nHeathcote Williams: AC/DC\n\nHarold Pinter: The Room; The Birthday Party\n\nDavid Hare: Slag\n\nStrand C. The post-war stage and musicals\n\nFor example:\n\nJoe Orton: Loot\n\nJohn Osborne: Look Back in Anger\n\nDavid Storey: Home\n\nSimon Gray: Butley\n\nHarold Pinter: The Caretaker, ‘Night’, No Man’s Land, etc\n\nPeter Shaffer: Equus; Royal Hunt of the Sun\n\nLionel Bart: Oliver\n\nStrand D. Television drama\n\nFor example:\n\nArmchair Theatre, The Wednesday Play, Play for Today\n\nKen Russell: Debussy; Always on a Sunday; Dante’s Inferno\n\nKen Loach: Cathy Come Home\n\nMike Leigh: Meantime\n\nDennis Potter: The Singing Detective\n\nStrand E. Theatre since 1990\n\nFor example:\n\nKeith Waterhouse: Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell\n\nTom Stoppard: Arcadia\n\nCaryl Churchill: A Mouthful of Birds; Serious Money\n\nDavid Hare: Skylight\n\nSarah Kane: Blasted; Cleansed\n\nMark Ravenhill: The Cut\n\nJez Butterworth: Jerusalem\n\nMike Bartlett: Earthquakes in London\n\nStrand F. The role of theatre\n\nFor example:\n\nPeter Brook, The Empty Space\n\nHoward Barker, ‘Arguments for a Theatre’\n\nShakespeare, the RSC, the British Council and the National Theatre\n\nStudent theatre\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nNarrative\n\nThis is a creative writing course for those who want to write fiction. The student works closely with the tutor on composing prose narratives in either short or longer formats, with weekly writing assignments. Some reflection on the nature of fiction-writing is included, although the focus is on the nurturing and development of the student’s own skills and capacity to produce original work.\n\nStudents who have already taken creative writing classes in prose will be asked to take this tutorial as ENAM 0021 Advanced Narrative. This will allow them to be assessed on a different basis to those with little or no experience of creative writing.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nNineteenth-Century Fiction\n\nThe nineteenth century was the period in which the English novel came of age, rising to unheard-of prominence as a means of scrutinising the era in all its evolving facets, and running the full gamut of comic to tragic in the process. While in many sense the novel was dominant, publishing strategies were fluid. Novels were published in periodical form, as well as single volumes, while short stories and other fictional forms also flourished in this era. Students can take the opportunity to examine these forms in addition to the novel.\n\nSample Syllabus:\n\nAusten, Pride and Prejudice\n\nScott, Heart of Midlothian\n\nGaskell, North and South\n\nThackeray, Vanity Fair\n\nEmily Bronte, Wuthering Heights\n\nDickens, Great Expectations\n\nEliot, Middlemarch\n\nHardy, Jude the Obscure\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nNovels on Screen\n\nThis tutorial explores the adaptation of nineteenth-century fiction in twentieth and twenty-first century cinema. The earliest forays into film were made while Queen Victoria was still on the throne and a striking number of these early experiments are adaptations of Victorian novels. Through the course of the nineteenth century, the novel had become a (or perhaps even the) culturally dominant art form of its day. As the century came to a close and film began to develop alongside its more venerable and established forebear, the two forms became entangled in surprising and mutually illuminating ways. This interrelationship was profound and has informed thinking about both genres at least since 1946 when Sergei Eisenstein noted a “‘genetic’ line of descent” between the two and insisted that “from the Victorian novel […] stem[s] the first shoots of American film esthetic”. In this course, we will consider how film interacted with the novel and, as it became increasingly dominant, how this shaping influence began to work in both directions.\n\nAdaptation offers an approach to filmmaking in which cinema and the novel come into especially close contact and, as such, this will provide the focus for our investigation. This course will consist of eight tutorials, each pairing a novel with at least one cinematic adaptation. Possible topics include:\n\nDavid Lean’s Dickens: Great Expectations (1860/1946)\n\nLewis Carroll and a proliferation of Alices\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray and Stanley Kubrick: Barry Lyndon (1844/1975)\n\nDream and Disillusion: Michael Winterbottom, Jude (1996) and Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure (1895)\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (1897): from Nosferatu to Coppola\n\nMaking it Modern: Jane Austen’s Emma (1815) and Clueless (1995)\n\nH.G. Wells and Sci-Fi: The Invisible Man (1897/1933)\n\nFrom Page to Radio to Screen: The War of the Worlds (1897/1936/1953)\n\nConrad’s The Heart of Darkness (1899) and Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nNeo-Victorianism and Layered Adaptation: Fingersmith (2002) and The Handmaiden (2016)\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nOld English Literature in Translation\n\nThe canon of Old English Literature comprises the earliest corpus of texts in the English literary tradition. This course studies a wide selection of translated texts in verse and prose forms, from the foundational epic achievement of Beowulf through to shorter lyrics, secular as well as sacred poetry, and historical prose narratives.\n\nSample Topics\n\nBeowulf\n\nThe Wanderer\n\nThe Seafarer\n\nThe Dream of the Rood\n\nThe Battle of Maldon\n\nriddles and minor forms\n\nselections from the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\n\nBiblical translations\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nPoetry\n\nThis course is intended for those who want to write poetry. The student works closely with the tutor on composing poetry on a weekly basis. Some reflection on the nature of poetic composition is included, although the focus is on the nurturing and development of the student’s own skills and capacity to produce original work.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nPoetry of the Victorian Era\n\nThe course explores the development of English Poetry in the Victorian era, from its beginnings in the wake of the Romantic movement, through a variety of modes, types and genres, up to the fin-de-siecle. Poets are read both for intrinsic literary merit and for an appreciation of the wider culture of the time.\n\nSample Topics\n\nScott, Lay of the Last Minstrel\n\nTennyson, In Memoriam, Idylls of the King\n\nRobert Browning, The Ring and the Book\n\nElizabeth Barrett Browning, Aurora Leigh\n\nChristina Rossetti, Goblin Market\n\nHopkins, selected verse\n\nHardy, selected verse\n\nWilde, The Ballad of Reading Gaol\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nRomanticism\n\nDuring the latter decades of the eighteenth century and opening years of the nineteenth, the broad cultural movement known as Romanticism swept artists and writers into a new kind of collective sensibility. British Romanticism has been viewed as a reactionary or revolutionary ‘movement’ - political as well as artistic in nature - which united its core protagonists in an overturning of classical and enlightenment values: redirecting their literary energies to an exploration of the heart, not the mind; to experience, rather than explanation; and to the relationship of human creativity to the natural world. Increasingly, however, critics have begun to point towards the immense variety and complexity of the ideologies as well as the artistic techniques used by the writers who fall under the umbrella of Romanticism, and to critique the notion of a unified Romantic philosophy. Students of this course set themselves to work at the heart of this impassioned critical field, studying the canonical British Romantic writers alongside a host of troublingly heterodox contemporary material in order to explore the phenomenon of Romantic literature in all its plurality and complexity. Each Romantic writer has a unique voice, but all were drawn into the quest to convey human experience through the imperfect medium of the written word.\n\nIt is possible to tailor this course to focus on ‘Romanticism and the Environment’: the tutorials might include Romantic depictions of the city, Romantic travel writing, poetic responses to the enclosure acts, the Lake District and the Romantic sense of place, aesthetics of ruin and epitaph, seas and seafaring as a Romantic trope, ‘sharrawaggi’ and orientalism in Romantic conceptions of nature, Gothic landscapes, preromantic aesthetics in the writing of Cowper and Thomson, and the pastoral and georgic traditions. We will encounter twentieth and twenty-first century critical reflections on Romanticism and the natural world and on Romanticism and the historical development of ‘environmentalism’ from writers including George Monbiot, Simon Jarvis, Timothy Morton and others.\n\nSome Sample Topics\n\nWriting the self and developing narratives in texts including Wordsworth’s The Prelude, Cowper’s The Task and De Quincey’s Confessions of an English Opium Eater\n\nRomanticism as a manifesto: Wordsworth and Coleridge, Lyrical Ballads\n\nRomantic supernaturalism and the gothic: including Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Keats’s La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Byron’s The Giaour\n\nRomantic engagement with a literary past: Byron, Don Juan; Hellenic influences in Keats and Shelley, Blake’s Milton, selections of Romantic criticism on Shakespeare\n\nThe Keats-Shelley circle\n\nRomantic prose: Scott, Heart of Midlothian; Mary Shelley, Frankenstein\n\nSymbolism and revelation: Blake, Songs of Innocence, Songs of Experience\n\nRomanticism, pastoral and environmentalism\n\nRuskin, Blake and the Romantic vision of nature’s disharmony in the visual arts\n\nRomantic history: Burke, Carlyle and Gibbon\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nShakespeare I: Histories and Comedies\n\nThe course presented a detailed study of Shakespeare’s most important history plays and comedies. Close textual analysis of the individual dramas, in terms of structure and thematic content, was allied to a survey of their wider role in the entire Shakespearian corpus and to the history of English literature at this crucial phase of its development.\n\nSample Topics\n\nRichard II\n\nRichard III\n\nHenry IV (1 and 2)\n\nHenry V\n\nThe Taming of the Shrew\n\nA Midsummer Night’s Dream\n\nTwelfth Night\n\nAs You Like It\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nShakespeare II: Tragedies & Romances\n\nThe course presents a detailed study of Shakespeare’s most important tragedies and romances. Close textual analysis of the individual dramas, in terms of structure and thematic content, is allied to a survey of their wider role in the wider Shakespearian corpus, and in the history of English literature at this crucial phase of its development.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nRomeo and Juliet\n\nJulius Caesar\n\nHamlet\n\nOthello\n\nKing Lear\n\nMacbeth\n\nThe Winter’s Tale\n\nThe Tempest\n\nIntroductory Reading:\n\nMcEachern, C., ed., The Cambridge Companion to Shakespearean Tragedy.

Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 1998\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nThe Country House\n\nThe country house is more than the sum of its bricks and mortar. In the British imagination it has represented everything from the height of cultural and political capital, to the decline and fall of old social structures. Through readings of literature, this module will introduce students to the chequered story of the country house in relation to British history. We will read poems presenting country houses as pastoral retreats from political upheaval in the seventeenth century, and in contrast, texts showing the vast array of labour and trade that sustained the luxury of eighteenth century mansions. The course links together the literary presentation of rural seats with the aesthetic and moral principles that have governed their construction and appreciation. Students can read Jane Austen’s Mansfield Park in light of Edward Said’s Culture and Imperialism, and look at the symbolic functions of stately homes in the wake of war in Evelyn Waugh’s Brideshead Revisited. By setting patriotic texts alongside satires and critiques, the course will introduce students to some of the diverse cultural arguments that stately homes have provoked, which continue to be relevant today.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nThe Inklings\n\nC.S.

Tolkien and Charles Williams were at the centre of the Inklings, a group of friends who met every week in Oxford between the early 1930s and the 1950s to read one another their latest writings, to share ideas, and to enjoy good food and drink. This course was a detailed investigation of the Inklings, their work and the contribution it made to literature, philosophy and religion.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nThe Printing Revolution\n\nBefore the Internet, there was the printing press. Exploited by some as an engine of reform, and condemned by others as the end of knowledge itself, ‘the art of artificial writing’ had revolutionary consequences for Europe. From its arrival in the 1440s, we find entrepreneurs using fonts to imitate manuscripts, but in numbers never attainable by the scribes that preceded them. During the Reformation, the technology was put to ideological ends by both establishment and anti-establishment authors. Printing also left its mark on language and literature: in the earliest English printed books we find editors grappling with a multiplicity of dialects that eventually becomes standardized, while some poets actively shunned the medium, seeing it as inherently prone to error. This course includes an introduction to the practical study of books as objects: how they were made, and how we interpret the variety of fonts and marginalia found in them. Students will have the opportunity to work with the rich resources on offer both through the Bodleian libraries and within our own collection of early printed books and manuscripts in the Feneley Library.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nTragedy\n\nThe course explores the nature and forms of tragedy – one of the foundational literary modes of western culture since antiquity. From the earliest statements about tragic theory as set down by Aristotle and embodied in Greek drama, to a reconsideration of tragedy during the English and French Renaissance, key examples of the form are studied in order to ascertain the meaning of tragedy and the various ways in which it sought expression.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nAristotle, Poetics\n\nAeschylus, Oresteia\n\nEuripides, The Trojan Women\n\nSophocles, Theban Plays\n\nWebster, The Duchess of Malfi\n\nShakespeare, Romeo and Juliet\n\nCorneille, Le Cid\n\nRacine, Phèdre\n\nIntroductory Reading:\n\nDraper, R., Tragedy: Developments in Criticism.

The works of individual novelists are closely examined from the perspective of content, structure and style, and are assessed in terms of the larger developments in culture and society in which they played a role.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nJoseph Conrad\n\nE.M. Forster\n\nVirginia Woolf\n\nD.H. Lawrence\n\nEvelyn Waugh\n\nGeorge Orwell\n\nKingsley Amis\n\nIris Murdoch\n\nWilliam Golding\n\nAnthony Burgess\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nJeannette Winterson\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nTwentieth-Century British Poetry\n\nThe course ranges widely among the riches and complexities of British poetry in the twentieth century. In the modern age the variety of modes and types in which poets found their individual voices expanded to a vast degree, responding in manifold ways to the crises, tribulations and landmarks of the period. Poets are studied for their own particular nuances and characteristics, and for their larger contribution to modern British culture.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nThomas Hardy\n\nThe Poetry of the First World War\n\nA.E. Housman\n\nT.S. Eliot\n\nW.B. Yeats\n\nW.H. Auden\n\nJohn Betjeman\n\nDylan Thomas\n\nPhilip Larkin\n\nTed Hughes\n\nSeamus Heaney\n\nBenjamin Zephaniah\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nViking Literature and Culture\n\nThis course explores the legacy of Viking literature, ranging from mythology to heroic legend, and includes an analysis of wider history and culture through readings of Old Norse and Icelandic texts in translation. Topics include the Poetic Edda, skaldic poetry, the world of Snorri Sturlson, the legendary sagas and the Icelandic family sagas.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nWomen & Literature in the English Renaissance\n\nThis course examines women writers of the English Renaissance, placing them in a wider European context, and studying them in their roles as translators and adaptors of a wide range of humanist texts, alongside their roles as poets, dramatists and political polemicists. The course provides an opportunity to study the manuscript and print culture of a distinctive group of writers too often excluded from early-modern literary studies.\n\nAristocratic writing, especially that surrounding the English court, is one setting for the growth of female authorship. The works of Anne Askew, Margaret Tyler and Mary Sidney were celebrated (and defended) within their period, as well as appreciated by later readers. Many of these writings are surprising in their authorial confidence: their writing is invested in a presentation of female influence, erudition and poetic skill, and enters fully into the literary and political debate of their male counterparts. We will cover poetry, prose, allegory, fantasy, philosophy, theology and drama. The utopian fictions of Mary Wroth and Mary Sidney reward attention as early examples of the genre we now call ‘science fiction’, as well as being read as Christian allegories and as radical political treatises. Further radical discussions surrounding the morality of female authorship came to head in a series of controversies in which women, often publishing pseudonymously and anonymously, defended themselves from the ridicule and hostility of male pamphleteers.\n\nThe study of women writers gives us a unique vantage point from which to approach the print culture and reading habits of the English Renaissance.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nWomen & Literature in the Middle Ages\n\nThis course brings together diverse genres and texts in order to examine how women were represented in Western European Medieval Literature, and particularly to introduce a rich array of writing by women. The place of women in European society throughout the Middle Ages was often in direct relation to biblical texts, which frequently emphasised primacy of men over women, and balanced understanding of femininity between the absolute archetypes of Eve and the Virgin Mary. Nonetheless some women exercised remarkable degrees of power in religious, political and domestic realms, both working within and against legal limitations. Women often made practical choices between marriage and taking the veil as a nun or anchoress, but in some cases and alternative way seems to have been found, such as the extraordinary travelling life of Margery Kempe. Women’s writing is frequently composed in the vernacular, whether French, Middle English, German, etc, and often that which survives is written by wealthier or noble individuals. As required this course may also incorporate historical and archaeological sources in order to better trace the lives of ordinary women, who frequently lived and died without leaving a textual record.\n\nThis course explores a mixture of genres, which might include hagiography, life-writing, mystical spiritualism, lyrics, letters, homilies and dream vision, ranging across poetry, prose and, if desired, drama. Texts will be read in translation from Anglo Norman, French, Middle English, and Latin, with some opportunity to get to grips with the original language in consultation with your tutor.\n\nSample Syllabus\n\nA selection of anonymous Marian devotional lyrics\n\nMarie de France, Lais\n\nAncrene Wisse\n\nThe Katherine Group and the Wooing Group\n\nThe Life of Christina of Markyate\n\nThe Paston Letters\n\nMargery Kempe, The Book of Margery Kempe\n\nChristine de Pizan, The Book of the City of Ladies\n\nJulian of Norwich, Shewings or Revelations of Divine Love\n\nGuillaume Lorris/Jean de Meun, Roman de la Rose (likely paired with Christine de Pizan, Epistre au Dieu d’Amours)\n\nGeoffrey Chaucer, The Wife of Bath’s Prologue and Tale; The Clerk’s Tale; The Merchant’s Tale; The Miller’s Tale\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nWomen & Literature, 1660-1800\n\nEighteenth-century Britain has traditionally been thought of in terms of a male monopoly over cultural and political power, yet it was also a time in which increasing literacy and the availability of cheap print brought new voices – and especially those of women – to prominence. The period saw the creation of circulating libraries, the rise of sentimental and Gothic novel-writing, and the appearance of the first female actors. This course looks at both celebrated and neglected female writers of poetry, prose and dramatic works. It explores the ways in which women participated in the literary sphere, and the ways in which they created new spaces for themselves in discussions of politics, religion, art, philosophy and science. We will also engage with their strategies for the presentation of traditionally ‘feminine’ ideals such as domesticity, maternity and motherhood, chastity and fidelity. The course allows us to place contemporaneous and modern criticism alongside close readings of women’s writing from the period of the civil war to the aftermath of the French Revolution.\n\nKey authors include the poet, dramatist and political radical Aphra Behn; the aristocrat, pioneering traveller and social commentator Mary Wortley Montagu; the immensely popular poet and member of the Bluestocking group, Hannah More; playwright and abolitionist Fanny Burney; Scottish pastoral writer Joanna Baillie; intellectual and prominent dissenter Anna Laetitia Barbauld; educationalist and novelist Maria Edgeworth; gothic pioneer Ann Radcliffe; fervent nationalist poet Felicia Hemans; and the passionate and politically-astute Mary Wollstonecraft, one of the most controversial literary figures of her time. We will also spend time reading the poetry, letters, autobiographies and diaries of lesser-known women whose works reward critical attention.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nFilm and Media Culture\n\nCinema and Society in Twentieth-Century Britain\n\nThis tutorial explores British cinema and society during the twentieth century. Cinema became enormously popular in the first half of the century; it both shaped and responded to changing social and cultural attitudes. This course draws on films from a range of genres, including comedy, action, and documentaries. These provide a stimulating opportunity to explore themes such as social change, attitudes to gender and sexuality, nationhood, the British empire, and the impact of the World Wars. This tutorial is also allows students to examine the methodological challenges of using film as a historical source.\n\nSample Films:\n\nWar Women of England (1917)\n\nA Day in the Life of a Munitions Worker (1917)\n\nFires Were Started (1943)\n\nA Canterbury Tale (1944)\n\nMadonna of the Seven Moons (1945)\n\nThe Dambusters (1955)\n\nAlfie (1966)\n\nDarling (1965)\n\nA Passage to India (1984)\n\nBilly Elliot (2000)\n\nThis is England (2006)\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nNovels on Screen\n\nThis tutorial explores the adaptation of nineteenth-century fiction in twentieth and twenty-first century cinema. The earliest forays into film were made while Queen Victoria was still on the throne and a striking number of these early experiments are adaptations of Victorian novels. Through the course of the nineteenth century, the novel had become a (or perhaps even the) culturally dominant art form of its day. As the century came to a close and film began to develop alongside its more venerable and established forebear, the two forms became entangled in surprising and mutually illuminating ways. This interrelationship was profound and has informed thinking about both genres at least since 1946 when Sergei Eisenstein noted a “‘genetic’ line of descent” between the two and insisted that “from the Victorian novel […] stem[s] the first shoots of American film esthetic”. In this course, we will consider how film interacted with the novel and, as it became increasingly dominant, how this shaping influence began to work in both directions.\n\nAdaptation offers an approach to filmmaking in which cinema and the novel come into especially close contact and, as such, this will provide the focus for our investigation. This course will consist of eight tutorials, each pairing a novel with at least one cinematic adaptation. Possible topics include:\n\nDavid Lean’s Dickens: Great Expectations (1860/1946)\n\nLewis Carroll and a proliferation of Alices\n\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray and Stanley Kubrick: Barry Lyndon (1844/1975)\n\nDream and Disillusion: Michael Winterbottom, Jude (1996) and Thomas Hardy’s Jude the Obscure (1895)\n\nBram Stoker’s Dracula (1897): from Nosferatu to Coppola\n\nMaking it Modern: Jane Austen’s Emma (1815) and Clueless (1995)\n\nH.G. Wells and Sci-Fi: The Invisible Man (1897/1933)\n\nFrom Page to Radio to Screen: The War of the Worlds (1897/1936/1953)\n\nConrad’s The Heart of Darkness (1899) and Apocalypse Now (1979)\n\nNeo-Victorianism and Layered Adaptation: Fingersmith (2002) and The Handmaiden (2016)\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nThe Middle Ages in Cinema\n\nThis tutorial explores cinematic depictions of the middle ages, mainly in European and North American film. It draws on the burgeoning scholarly literature in this field, to explore the complex interplay between cinema and ‘the medieval.’ This includes thinking about the interaction between films and other forms of artistic expression: many relevant films are adaptations of plays or novels (‘The Lion in Winter’, 1968; various versions of Mark Twain’s ‘A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court’).\n\nMedieval topics have captured the imagination of film makers since the early years of cinema, as seen for instance in Carl Theodore Dreyer’s tremendously influential silent film La Passion de Jeanne d’Arc (1928). Perennially popular topics for cinematic treatment include King Arthur, Robin Hood, and the Crusades. (On the latter, compare Kingdom of Heaven (2005), with the 1963 Egyptian film Salladin the Victorious). They range from cerebral films such as The Seventh Seal (1957) to swashbucklers such as The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938) or El Cid (1961). Central elements include depictions of gender and sexuality, Christianity, and Orientalism. Humour is also an important theme, for instance in Monty Python and the Holy Grail (1975), and Les Visiteurs (1993).\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nFrench\n\nFrench\n\nTuition in French can be arranged to accommodate a wide range of needs and interests. For example, a stress can be laid on French for academic purposes, or on conversational French depending on what is required.\n\nNote that modern languages are offered only at intermediate and advanced levels, not for beginners or near-beginners. Use the same course code for both levels, you will be asked to clarify your linguistic skills during the admissions process.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nOld French\n\nThis course studies the language of Old French, though medieval texts such as the ‘Chanson de Roland’. Students must have at least high intermediate modern French before taking this course. The precise nature of the tutorial will depend on the skills and needs of the individual student.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGender, Sexuality, and Feminist Studies\n\nGender & History\n\nThis course explores gender and modern history. Recent scholars have increasingly made a gendered reading of history; this course samples and assesses the success of these approaches while exploring the nature, development and contestation of societies’ gender norms, leading models of change, and key methodological issues. Issues include work, political change, religion, culture and sexuality, with a focus on the modern world.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGender and Sexuality in Medieval Europe\n\nThis course explores questions of gender and sexuality in western Europe during the middle ages, from around the fall of the western Roman Empire in the fifth century, until the fifteenth century. Christianity was a perennial element shaping attitudes and practices, but was a complex package, constantly re-interpreted in changing historical circumstances. Gender and sexuality need to be located in economic, cultural and social context. This course draws on primary sources (in English translation), ranging from Augustine of Hippo to Christine de Pizan, informed by the work of modern scholars such as Peter Brown, Julia H.M. Smith, and John Boswell.\n\nSample topics:\n\nAugustine of Hippo\n\nBetter to marry than to burn?\n\nMonasticism and clerical celibacy\n\nSame sex desire\n\nMasculinities\n\nWomen’s writing\n\nSex, gender, and medieval orientalism\n\nThe Virgin Mary\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nGender and Sexuality in Modern Britain\n\nSince the late eighteenth century, Britain has seen profound changes in attitudes and practices surrounding gender and sexuality. For example, the social and legal status of women has altered dramatically, attitudes to same-sex relationships continue to shift, the insights of feminism have had a profound intellectual impact, while masculinities have been examined time and again. These changes have interacted with other trends, including religious life, social class, economic activity, and Britain’s relationship with the empire and the wider world. This tutorial examines these changes through sources including polemics, history, fiction, film, and theoretical writings. These range from Mary Wollstonecraft’s ‘A Vindication of the Rights of Women’ (1792), to modern British cinema.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nSocial and Sexual Transgressions in Late Medieval and Early Modern European Literature (1200‒1700)\n\nThe literature of late medieval and early modern Europe is replete with social and sexual transgressors who have often been overlooked by scholars. This course explores a range of characters on the margins of social and sexual acceptability in order to re-evaluate preconceptions held about matters of gender, sexuality, and social roles in the period 1200–1700. It places particular emphasis on issues of homosexual desire, sexual trickery and seduction, and progressive female characters and writers. Students may choose to study a selection of literary texts in the areas of prose, the short story, poetry, and drama.\n\nSample topics:\n\nSaints and Sinners in Alfonso X’s Songs of the Virgin Mary.\n\nSexual Escapades in Giovanni Boccaccio’s The Decameron.\n\nThe Outspoken Wife of Geoffrey Chaucer’s The Canterbury Tales.\n\nForthright Women in Gil Vicente’s Farce of Inês Pereira.\n\nSexual Seduction and Trickery in Juan Ruiz’s The Book of Good Love.\n\nGo-Betweens and Sorceresses in Fernando de Roja’s Celestina.\n\nTransgenderism and Transvestism in António Ferreira’s Bristo.\n\nSexual Misbehaviour and Deceptions in Marguerite de Navarre’s Heptameron.\n\nHomosexual Desire in Richard Barnfield’s The Affectionate Shepherd and Cynthia.\n\nThe Female Rogue of Francisco López de Úbeda’s The Lives of Justina.\n\nSwindlers and Tricksters in Francisco de Quevedo’s The Swindler.\n\nImmorality Exposed in Francisco de Quevedo’s Dreams and Discourses.\n\nFemale Agency in María de Zayas’s Amorous and Exemplary Tales.\n\nThe Strong-Willed Nun of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz’s The House of Trials\n\nThese texts are available in English translations. However, if you do have some of the relevant language skills then the course can also be taught using the original texts: contact the Senior Tutor to discuss this.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nWomen & Literature in the English Renaissance\n\nThis course examines women writers of the English Renaissance, placing them in a wider European context, and studying them in their roles as translators and adaptors of a wide range of humanist texts, alongside their roles as poets, dramatists and political polemicists.

Alexander was significant in different ways to different dynasties administering different regions and in different eras. Different versions of his biography had different appeal, and at different times. By associating themselves with the hero, different rulers emphasized different facets of Alexander in their patronage of manuscripts.\n\nIn addition to being a part of popular culture and common knowledge for millennia, Alexander’s recounted exploits have particularly resonated with royals and nobles sitting in English through Indonesian courts. The course highlights a few select illustrated texts—produced between the 13th through 16th centuries—in Greek, French, Latin, Armenian, Turkish, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian. It is essential to consider each text within its own tradition, but placing them together also allows for a broader geographic and chronological scope that can also produce interesting comparisons of cross-cultural and trans-imperial significance.\n\nSessions will explore the interplay of a narrative’s ancient (often imagined) past taking place in the Greek Empire (ca. 4th century BCE), with the accreted layers of time periods in which the illustrated text is produced, read, or seen. Dwelling on Alexander’s reception in various courts and dynasties professing Christian and Islamic confessions (Franco-Flemish, Italian, Byzantine, Mongol, Ottoman, Safavid, Mughal, Abu’l-Khairid [Uzbek]), the course challenges the binaries of east and west, Christianity and Islam, through the universal appeal of the famous world conqueror. It will be of interest to students of literature, art history, religious history, culture and translation studies, medieval and early modern cultures, European and West/Central/South Asian history.\n\nSample Topics\n\nAlexander as interpreted in the oldest texts and contexts: Greek, Syriac, Latin language sources, Biblical and Qur’anic versions.\n\nNew Persian and Old French—European Medieval traditions (13th-14th centuries) and early Persian literary versions (in the Shahnama, ca. 1010)\n\nAlexander in the Byzantine and Mongol realms (13th-14th centuries.\n\nAlexander in the Islamicate (Ottoman, Iranian, and Central Asian) realm (15th century), Turkish and Persian versions.\n\nAlexander in the Islamicate (Ottoman, Iranian, and Central Asian) realm (16th century), Turkish and Persian versions.\n\nWhy Alexander? The appeal of superheroes.\n\nTrip to the Weston Library to view manuscripts ((European and Turco-Persianate copies of the Alexander Romance).\n\nTrip to British Library in London to view Old French Alexander manuscripts owned by Henry VIII, and Persian manuscript versions.\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAncient and Medieval Political Thought\n\nThis course explores the development of western political thought from its Greek foundations through to the late Middle Ages. A historical overview of the progress of central political concepts is allied to a close reading of particular authors, with reference to the ways in which political thought related to broader philosophical, cultural and religious concerns.\n\nSample Topics:\n\nPlato, Republic\n\nAristotle, Politics\n\nCicero, De Re Publica, De Legibus\n\nAugustine, City of God\n\nJohn of Salisbury, Policraticus\n\nThomas Aquinas, Summa Theologiae\n\nDante, De Monarchia\n\nMarsilius of Padua, Defensor pacis\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAnglo-Saxon England\n\nThis course covers the period from end of Roman Britain in early fifth century, to the Norman Conquest of 1066. For much of this era the written sources are slim (if intriguing and hugely suggestive), and in recent years a great deal has been learnt from reading them with archaeology and material culture. Notions of England and Englishness, as a cultural and political entity, developed from a series of social, economic and religious factors. Notable among these were the conversion to Christianity, and the impact of Scandinavian raiding and settlement.\n\nSample Topics\n\nCatastrophe, Collapse, Continuity: the End of Roman Britain\n\nConverting the English: Bede and history\n\nSplitting Skulls and Heroic Drinking? Kingship and Hegemony\n\nThe Viking Impact\n\nAlfred: Wisdom, Resistance and Greatness\n\nMaking England: the Triumph of Wessex?\n\nReforming the Church\n\nThe Last Century of England?\n\nIntroductory Reading\n\nBeowulf (many translations)\n\nBede, Ecclesiastical History of the English People. (many translations)\n\nAsser, Life of King Alfred – the best translation is in Keynes, S., & Lapidge, M. (trans.), Alfred the Great. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1983\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nArchaeological Method and Theory\n\nThis tutorial is an introduction to archaeological method and theory. How do archaeologists work? What methods did they employ traditionally, and how have recent developments in remote sensing techniques such as LiDAR revolutionised field exploration? How do archaeologists then ‘translate’ the mass of data gathered in the field into a coherent story about the past, and how have such theoretical and interpretative frameworks changed over time? Can archaeological theory really help us to elucidate the past, or does it tell us more about contemporary trends in philosophy? This course provides an overview of archaeological investigation practices as well as the main developments in theoretical thinking that have taken place since the middle decades of the 20th century, and will provide students with a critical understanding of archaeological method and theory necessary to understand the discipline.\n\nSample reading\n\nBarker, P.

This was a period of political rivalry and experimentation within Greece, and a series of confrontations and/or negotiations with the massive might of the Persian Empire. This period is deeply engaging in itself, and has exercised a perennial fascination in subsequent thought, not least because of the historical writings of Herodotus and Thucydides.\n\nSample topics\n\nThe polis\n\nThe Persian Wars\n\nPersians and Greeks\n\nThe Delian League and the Peloponnesian War\n\nComedy, tragedy and Athenian politics\n\nHistoriography: Herodotus, Thucydides and Xenophon\n\nArt and architecture\n\nEconomic life\n\nView in the Course Database.\n\nAugustine of Hippo\n\nThis course examines the life and thought of one of the giants of Western Church, Augustine of Hippo (died 430). Born into a landowning family in Roman Africa, Augustine had the upbringing of his class, including a period as a member of the Manichean sect, various relationships, and a glittering career as a professor of rhetoric. After a mystical experience and under the influence of Bishop Ambrose of Milan, Augustine converted to Catholic Christianity, becoming a bishop within ten years just as the Roman Empire was noticeably disintegrating. His surviving works cover a huge range from doctrinal theses, sermons and Biblical exegesis to attacks on heretics and his Confessions (which has been hailed as the first Christian autobiography). The subtlety, power and timing of his writing ensured that Augustine was profoundly influential in every age of the Western Church from his day to this.\n\nSample Syllabus\n\n‘Christian Autobiography’: The Confessions\n\nLiving the Christian Life: Augustine’s Rules\n\nPhilosophy and True Happiness: The Happy Life\n\nExpounding the Gospel: Homilies on the Gospel of St John\n\nTeaching the Preachers: On Christian Doctrine\n\nRefuting Heresy: Against the Donatists\n\nLoyalties: The City of God against the Pagans\n\nHipponiensis: The Long Shadow of Augustine\n\nIntroductory Reading\n\nChadwick, H., Augustine.
