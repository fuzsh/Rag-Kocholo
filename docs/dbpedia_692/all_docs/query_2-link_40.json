        "text": "Born Tomáš Straüssler in 1937 in what would soon be Nazi-occupied Czechoslovakia, Tom Stoppard and his family lived in Singapore and India before settling in England in 1946. Although he would go on to write thrillingly (and notoriously) intellectual plays, the young Stoppard was bored by school and left at 17 to work as a journalist. When he was 21, Stoppard saw Peter O’Toole play Hamlet, and decided that he was interested in writing for the stage.\n\nOver the next eight years, Stoppard completed several radio plays and even a novel (Lord Malquist and Mr. Moon) before his first success on stage: the dazzling 1966 comedy Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, in which two minor characters from Shakespeare’s Hamlet take center stage. The play debuted at the Royal National Theatre in 1968, transferred to the West End and then to Broadway, where it won Tony and New York Drama Critics awards for Best Play. Stoppard has continued to write award-winning plays over the course of his career, plays that vary in tone from highly literary and comic (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead; The Coast of Utopia), to experimental and musical (Every Good Boy Deserves Favour), to scientific (Hapgood; Arcadia), or more overtly political (Indian Ink; Rock ‘n’ Roll). Stoppard is also a successful screenwriter whose work includes Anna Karenina, the BBC mini-series Parade’s End, co-writing Terry Gilliam’s Brazil and sharing writing credit on 1998’s Academy Award-winning Shakespeare in Love.\n\nStoppard has received an impressive array of accolades over his career, including five Tony Awards, a Drama Desk Award, and a Laurence Olivier Award in addition to his Oscar for Shakespeare in Love. In 1997, Queen Elizabeth II knighted Stoppard. Receiving the high honor at Buckingham Palace was a touching experience for Stoppard, who fondly speaks of the event: “I have felt English almost from the day I arrived, but the knighthood puts some kind of seal on that emotion.”\n\n(As of May 2013)\n\nMatt Torney is entering his fifth season as Associate Artistic Director at Studio, where he has previously directed If I Forget, Translations, The Hard Problem, MotherStruck!, Hedda Gabler, Jumpers for Goalposts, The New Electric Ballroom, and The Walworth Farce.
