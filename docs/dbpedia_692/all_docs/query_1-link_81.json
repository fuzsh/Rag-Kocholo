        "text": "Abraham Joshua Heschel (1907–1972) Polish-born, German-educated theologian and philosopher. Deported by the Nazis in 1938, he made his way to the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York, where he taught until his death. He worked to revive mystical, prophetic, and active dimensions of Jewish piety and practice, stressing experience and personal response in spirituality. He was a leader in American civil rights and anti–Vietnam War activism. (December 23)\n\nAelred of Rievaulx (c.1110–1167) English Cistercian monk and abbot of the monastery of Rievaulx, who regarded deep human friendship as an essential element of spiritual life and closeness to God. (January 12)\n\nAgnes Sanford (1897–1982) American Episcopal laywoman who restored the practice of healing prayer to mainline churches. (February 21)\n\nAlexandrian Washerwoman (4th century) To the desert fathers and mothers, the founders of monasticism in the 4th and 5th centuries, an anonymous ordinary woman praying ceaselessly at her work represents the holiness of all that is ordinary and routine. (July 29)\n\nAndrei Rublev (c. 1365–c.1430) Russian Orthodox monk and icon painter. He worked as an assistant and disciple to Theophanes the Greek, and eventually painted images for prayer that synthesized Theophanes’ work with purified Russian folk traditions, creating an iconography that was intimate and human.\n\nAnne Frank (1929–1945) Young German Jewish girl whose extraordinary diary, written while in hiding from the Nazis, expressed an unshakable faith in the fundamental goodness of humanity, her unapologetic fears and frustrations with the people she lived with in confinement, her longings and desires, and her great hope for a future she knew she might not ever see. (June 12)\n\nAnne Hutchinson (1561–1643) English Puritan poet, teacher, and theologian who was banished from Massachusetts Bay Colony for teaching that God could be known through intuition and experience. After this, she and her husband joined Roger Williams in Rhode Island, helping found there a community more open to freedom of conscience.\n\nBacchus and Sergius (4th century) Roman soldiers who were martyred for their Christian faith. The ancient veneration of these two men offers gay Christians, and those who love and support them, a ray of hope by showing how the Church openly honored two people of the same gender in a loving relationship. In their relationship as Sergius and Bacchus found courage for the choice they were called to make as witnesses to their faith. (October 7)\n\nBarnabas (1st century) A Levite Jew, a man of learning and generosity and one of the first post-resurrection apostles, deeply respected by the disciples. His trust in the authenticity of Paul’s conversion led to their acceptance of this former persecutor. He was the first apostle to embrace the evidence of God’s grace in the hearts of Gentile converts to the Way. (June 11)\n\nBartolomé de las Casas (1474–1566) A young Spanish adventurer who accompanied Columbus on his second voyage, he received large New World land holdings and native slaves. He was so moved by their suffering that he became a priest, freed his slaves, and finally came to a moral rejection of slavery in any form. As a Dominican monk and eventually a bishop, he argued against slavery before theologians, politicians, and King Phillip II of Spain. Las Casas was the first Christian theologian to argue that enslaving fellow humans was sin, always and under any circumstances. (July 17)\n\nBlack Elk (1872–1957) A holy man of the Oglala Sioux, visionary, mystic, and Catholic convert. He showed forth through his life and teaching God’s radiant and powerfully healing presence in all of nature.\n\nCaspar David Friedrich (1774–1840) German Romantic painter whose awesome landscapes and seascapes express the profound mystical presence of God in the dark side of existence. (May 7)\n\nCesar Chavez (1927–1993) The son of Mexican migrants to California, he devoted his life to organizing farm workers. His movement gave migrant workers bargaining power, restoring dignity to this poor and dispossessed population. A man of religious faith and commitment to nonviolence, he embodied his “deepest belief that only by giving life do we find life, that the truest act of courage . . . is to sacrifice ourselves for others in a totally nonviolent struggle for justice.” (April 23)\n\nCharles Darwin (1809–1882) English naturalist whose On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859) and The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex (1871) offered an evolutionary understanding of the development of life on earth, challenging conventional interpretations of creation and inviting whole new ways of thinking of living beings, humanity, and God through process, system, and change. Darwin was a deacon in the Church of England. (April 19)\n\nCharles Wesley (1757–1834) Anglican priest, hymn writer, and, with his brother, John, founder of the Methodist movement in the Church of England. Their innovative mission to the working poor offended Church authorities in England’s rigid class structure by teaching the royal and priestly dignity of the least Christian, through an emphasis on feeling and experience. (March 3)\n\nChiune Sugihara (1900–1986) Japanese diplomat in Lithuania during World War II who defied government policy and issued as many visas as he could to save thousands of Jews fleeing annihilation by the Nazis. (July 31)\n\nChristine de Pisan (1365–1431) French writer and single mother whose witty theological polemic tweaking clergy attitudes towards women was the first writing of its kind available to a wide audience.\n\nDante Alighieri (1265–1321) Florentine poet whose towering three-part work, The Divine Comedy, takes us on his soul’s journey. He begins wandering blind and in despair in Il Inferno and concludes in Paradiso with an extraordinary vision of the dancing saints encircling “the love which moves the sun and other stars.” (September 13)\n\nDesmond Mpilo Tutu (b. 1931) Tutu was the first African to serve as Bishop of Lesotho, Bishop of Johannesburg, and Archbishop of Cape Town. Awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1984 for his staunch resistance to apartheid, he later headed South Africa’s Truth and Reconciliation Commission, as always counseling forgiveness rather than revenge for past injustice. The only saint still living when his likeness was placed on St. Gregory’s walls.\n\nDonaldina Cameron (1869–1968) Founder of Cameron House in San Francisco’s Chinatown, this Scottish Presbyterian social worker defied Chinese gangs and crime lords, corrupt police, and complacent politicians to rescue girls kidnapped from China to San Francisco for sale as prostitutes and slaves.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt (1884–1962) A woman of privilege who as First Lady chose to draw near to suffering, seeing and listening to people’s experience of being poor or dispossessed to enlarge her compassion. She used her access to political power as a means to offer them dignity and relief. (November 7)\n\nElla Fitzgerald (1927-1996) American chanteuse who overcame a tortured childhood, including desperate poverty and time as a prostitute, to become a singer of enormous grace and joy.\n\nEmily Dickinson (1830–1886) American lyric poet whose spare, distilled forms, jazz-like rhythms, and fiercely personal voice vastly influenced modern poetry. Raised in an intellectual Puritan family at a time when Transcendentalism was becoming a force, she explicitly abjured a declaration of faith while in college and ceased churchgoing as she withdrew from public life. But much of her work revolved around her passionate struggle with God, putting her in the company of earlier masters like John Donne and George Herbert.\n\nEsther John (Qamar Zia) (1929–1960) Teacher and missionary to Indian women, she was converted to Christianity by reading the 53rd chapter of Isaiah. She kept her faith secret but eventually ran away from home, afraid her family would force her to marry a Muslim husband, going north to the Punjab, where she worked in a mission hospital. She became a teacher and evangelized in the local villages, teaching women to read and working with them in the cotton fields. She was found murdered in her bed. (February 2)\n\nFlorence Nightingale (1820–1910) Unitarian, sometime Anglican, accused of “eclectic religious beliefs.” The leading figure in the development of modern nursing practice through her pioneering work in the Crimean War, she recruited and trained women to serve in places of disease and violence where Victorian sensibilities taught that “gentle ladies ought not to go.” Among her recruits were Anglican nursing sisters from the Sisters of Saint Margaret. (August 13)\n\nFrancis of Assisi (1182–1226) Italian mystic and church reformer who sang God’s work in all of nature—sun, moon, plants, animals, life, and death— and in the passion of Christ. His vernacular hymns, popular processions, and the first Christmas crèche were among his sensual and intuitive church reforms that appealed to people’s imagination, hope, and delight. Following one story of his peacemaking with animals, Francis is painted with a wolf. (October 4)\n\nFyodor Dostoievski (1821–1881) Russian novelist and mystic who came to faith while imprisoned for youthful revolutionary writings. His grandiose and addictive nature was slowly transformed and healed by his vision of Christ and the love of his second wife. He wrote prophetically of the bloodshed that principled “lovers of humanity” would wreak on the world by rejecting God and God’s love expressed through people. His vision of fundamental goodness in ordinary people made him hope for universal salvation. (January 28)\n\nGandhi (1869–1948) Martyred Indian spiritual leader; activist for peace and reconciliation between Muslims and Hindus. Inspired by Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount, this Hindu teacher of peace took on the British Empire to free India by means of a nonviolent moral conflict.

(March 17)\n\nPaul Erdős (1913–1996) Erdos lived as an itinerant mathematical angel, traveling constantly, unexpectedly showing up on other mathematicians’ doorsteps when they found themselves stuck while developing exciting new theories.

He lived very simply, depending on friends to tend his needs.\n\nPaul of Tarsus (1st century) Author of nearly half the New Testament. Paul, though personally a strict moralist and attracted to simple answers and clear, comprehensive order, struggled in his writings to include his startling vision of God’s unreserved embrace of all humanity in Christ.

They helped one another carry on challenging visionary work despite hostile scrutiny from their own communities and the Inquisition. (October 15)\n\nTheosebia (4th century) Wife of Gregory of Nyssa.
