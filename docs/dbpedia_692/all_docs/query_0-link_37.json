These men, in the pages of whose published letters and impressions are embedded many pleasing aspects of Boker's temperament and character, were Bayard Taylor, Richard Henry Stoddard, and Charles Godfrey Leland, the latter known familiarly in American literature as \"Hans Breitmann.\" These four, in different periods of their lives, might have been called \"the inseparables\"—so closely did they watch each other's development, so intently did they await each other's literary output, and write poetry to each other, and meet at Boker's, now and again, for golden talks on Sundays. Poetry was a passion with them, and even when two—Boker and Taylor—were sent abroad on diplomatic missions, they could never have been said to desert the Muse—their literary activity was merely arrested. One of the four—Stoddard—often felt, in the presence of Boker, a certain reticence due to lack of educational advantages; but in the face of Boker's graciousness—a quality which comes with culture in its truest sense,—he soon found himself writing Boker on matters of style, on qualities of English diction, and on the status of American letters—a stock topic of conversation those days.\n\nBoker was a Philadelphian, born there on October 6, 1823,—the son of Charles S. Boker, a wealthy banker, whose financial expertness weathered the Girard National Bank through the panic years of 1838-40, and whose honour, impugned after his death, in 1857, was defended many years later by his son in \"The Book of the Dead,\" reflective of Tennyson's \"In Memoriam,\" and marked by a triteness of phrase which was always Boker's chief limitation, both as a poet and as a dramatist.\n\nHe was brought up in an atmosphere of ease and refinement, receiving his preparatory education in private schools, and entering Princeton in 1840. On the testimony of Leland, who, being related to Boker, was thrown with him in their early years, and who avows that he always showed a love for the theatre, we learn that the young college student bore that same distinction of manner which had marked him as a child, and was to cling to him as a diplomat. Together as boys, these two would read their \"Percy's Reliques,\" \"Don Quixote,\" Byron and Scott—and while they were both in Princeton, Boker's room possessed the only carpet in the dormitory, and his walls boasted shelves of the handsomest books in college.\n\n\"As a mere schoolboy,\" wrote Leland, \"Boker's knowledge of poetry was remarkable. I can remember that he even at nine years of age manifested that wonderful gift that caused him many years after to be characterized by some great actor—I think it was Forrest—as the best reader in America…. While at college … Shakespeare and Byron were his favourites. He used to quiz me sometimes for my predilections for Wordsworth and Coleridge. We both loved Shelly passionately.\"\n\nIn fact, Leland claims that Boker was given to ridicule the \"Lakers;\" had he studied them instead, he would have added to his own poetry a naturalness of expression which it lacked.\n\nHe was quite the poet of Princeton in his day, quite the gentleman Bohemian. \"He was,\" writes Leland, \"quite familiar, in a refined and gentlemanly way, with all the dissipations of Philadelphia and New York.\" His easy circumstances made it possible for him to balance his ascetic taste for scholarship with riding horse-back. To which almost perfect attainment, he added the skilled ability to box, fence and dance. He graduated from Princeton in 1842, and the description of him left to us by Leland reveals a young man of nineteen, six feet tall, whose sculptured bust, made at this time, was not as much like him \"as the ordinary busts of Lord Byron.\" In later years he was said to bear striking resemblance to Hawthorne. His marriage to Miss Julia Riggs, of Maryland, followed shortly after his graduation, in fact, while he was studying law, a profession which was to serve him in good stead during his diplomatic years, but which he threw over for the stronger pull of poetry, whose Muse he could court without the necessity of driving it hard for support. Yet he was concerned about literature as a paying profession for others. On April 26, 1851, he wrote to Stoddard: \"Alas! alas! Dick, is it not sad that an American author cannot live by magazine writing? And this is wholly owing to the want of our international copyright law. Of course it is little to me whether magazine writers get paid or not; but it is so much to you, and to a thousand others.\" The time, until 1847, was spent in foreign travel, but it is interesting to note, as indication of no mean literary attainment in the interim, that Princeton, during this period, bestowed on him the degree of M.A., for merit in letters.\n\n1848 was a red-letter year for Boker. It witnessed the publication of his first volume of verse, \"The Lessons of Life, and other Poems,\" and it introduced him to Bayard Taylor and to R.H. Stoddard. Of the occasion, Taylor writes on October 13, to Mary Agnew:\n\nYoung Boker, author of the tragedy, \"Calaynos,\" a most remarkable work, is here on a visit, and spent several hours to-night with me. He is another hero,—a most notable, glorious mortal! He is one of our band, and is, I think, destined to high renown as an author. He is nearly my own age, perhaps a year or two older, and he has lived through the same sensations, fought the same fight, and now stands up with the same defiant spirit.\n\nThis friendship was one of excellent spiritual sympathy and remarkable external similarities and contrasts. One authority has written of their late years:\n\nIn certain ways, he and his friend, Bayard Taylor, made an interesting contrast with each other. Here was Boker [circa 1878] who had just come back from diplomatic service abroad; and here, too, was Taylor, who was just going abroad as minister to Berlin. Both were poets; they were fellow-Pennsylvanians and friends; and they were men of large mould physically, and of impressive presence; yet they were very dissimilar types. Boker, though massive and with a trace of the phlegmatic in his manner (perhaps derived from his Holland ancestors, the Bôchers, who had come thither from France, and had then sent a branch into England, from which the American family sprang), was courtly, polished, slightly reserved. His English forefathers had belonged to the Society of Friends, as had also Taylor's family in Pennsylvania,—another point in common. But Taylor's appearance, as his friends will remember, was somewhat bluff and rugged; his manner was hearty and open.\n\nLaunched in the literary life, therefore, Boker began to write assiduously. \"Calaynos,\" the tragedy referred to by Taylor, went into two editions during 1848, and the following year was played by Samuel Phelps at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, May 10. From the New York Tribune office, on May 29, 1849, Taylor wrote:\n\nYour welcome letter came this morning, and from the bottom of my heart was I rejoiced by it. I can well imagine your feeling of triumph at this earnest of fame…. I instantly hunted up the London \"Times\" and found \"Calaynos\" advertised for performance,—second night. I showed it to Griswold, who was nearly as much surprised and delighted as myself. Of course he will make good mention of it in his book. It will sell immensely for you, and especially just now, when you are coming out with \"Anne Bullen\" [sic.]. I shall not fail to have a notice of it in to-morrow morning's \"Tribune.\"\n\nSome authorities state that it was given by Phelps without Boker's consent. Another, who examined Boker's manuscripts, in possession of the poet's daughter-in-law, Mrs. George Boker, records that Barrett made cuts in the play, preparatory to giving it, Boker, even, revising it in part. The American première was reserved for James E. Murdoch, at the Philadelphia Walnut Street Theater, January 20, 1851, and it was revived at the same playhouse in April, 1855, by E.L. Davenport. As Stoddard says of it, one \"should know something—the more the better—about the plays that Dr. Bird and Judge Conrad wrote for Forrest and his successors, about Poe's 'Politian', Sargent's 'Velasco', Longfellow's 'Spanish Student'.\"\n\nHis choice of subject, in this, his first drama, indicated the romantic aloofness of Boker's mind, for he was always anxious to escape what Leland describes him as saying was a \"practical, soulless, Gradgrind age.\" In fact, Boker had not as yet found himself; he was more the book-lover than the student of men he afterwards became.\n\n\"Read Chaucer for strength,\" he advises Stoddard on January 7, 1850, \"read Spenser for ease and sweetness, read Milton for sublimity and thought, read Shakespeare for all these things, and for something else which is his alone. Get out of your age as far as you can.\"\n\nThese young men were not quickly received, and they regarded the utilitarian spirit of the time as against them. To Stoddard Boker once confessed: \"Were poetry forged upon the anvil, cut out with the axe, or spun in the mill, my heaven, how men would wonder at the process! What power, what toil, what ingenuity!\"\n\nBoker's correspondence with Stoddard began in a letter, dated September 5, 1849, announcing overtures made by the London Haymarket Theatre for his new tragedy, \"Anne Boleyn,\" which he was contemplating sending them in sheets. \"I have also the assurance,\" he announces, \"that Miss Cushman will bring it out in this country, provided she thinks her powers adapted to it.\"\n\nBoker's pen was energetic, and it moved at a gait which shows how fertile was his imagination. \"The inseparables\" cheered the way for each other in the face of official journalistic criticism. Taylor declared \"Anne Boleyn\" far in advance of \"Calaynos,\" prophesying that it would last. \"Go ahead, my dear poet,\" he admonishes, \"it will soon be your turn to damn those who would willingly damn you.\" Together these friends were always planning to storm the citadel of public favour with poetry, but Boker seems to have been the only one to whom the theatre held out attraction. By August 12, 1850, he was sending news to Stoddard that \"The Betrothal\" would be staged the following month. In good spirits, he writes:\n\nThe manager is getting it up with unusual care and splendour. Spangles and red flannels flame through it from end to end. I even think of appearing before the curtain on horseback, nay, of making the whole performance equestrian, and of introducing a hippopotamus in the fifth act. What think you? Have you and your miserable lyrics ever known such glory? If the play should take here, you benighted New-Yorkers will be illuminated with it immediately after it has run its hundredth night in the city which is so proud of its son.\n\nThis was the second of his pieces to be given performance, \"Anne Boleyn\" never seeing the boards. \"The Betrothal\" was produced at the Philadelphia Walnut Street Theatre, on September 25, 1850, and opened in New York, on November 18 of the same year. Taylor wrote to its author, on December 4: \"I saw the last night…. It is even better as an acting play than I had anticipated, but it was very badly acted. I have heard nothing but good of it, from all quarters.\" It was Elizabethan in tone, quite in the spirit of that romantic drama practised by such American authors as Willis, Sargent and others. How it was received when presented in London, during 1853, is reflected in Boker's letter to Stoddard, dated October 9, 1853:\n\nI have read the Times notice of the \"Betrothal.\" It is honey to most of the other newspaper criticisms…. Notwithstanding, and taking the accounts of my enemies for authority, the play was unusually successful with the audience on that most trying occasion, the first night…. The play stands a monument of English injustice. Mark you, it was not prejudice that caused the catastrophe; it was fear lest I should get a footing on their stage, of which \"Calaynos\" had given them timely warning.\n\n\"The Widow's Marriage,\" in manuscript, and never published, was accepted by Marshall, manager of the Walnut, and is noted by Boker, in a letter to Stoddard, October 12, 1852, the chief handicap confronting him being the inability to find someone suited to take the leading rôle. Stoddard's own comment was:\n\nWhether [it] was ever produced I know not, but I should say not, for the part of the principal character, Lady Goldstraw, is one which no actress whom I remember could have filled to the satisfaction of her creator. The fault of this character (me judice) is that it is too good to be played on a modern stage. It ought to have been written for antiquity two hundred years ago.\n\nBoker was right when he referred to himself as \"prolific\" at this time. He already had produced, in 1851, according to markings on the manuscript, a piece called \"All the World a Mask,\" and he had written \"The Podesta's Daughter,\" a dramatic sketch, issued, with \"Miscellaneous Poems,\" in 1852. Toward the end of this year, he completed \"Leonor de Guzman.\"\n\n\"Her history,\" he writes to Stoddard, on November 14, \"you will find in Spanish Chronicles relating to the reigns of Alfonso XII of Castile and his son, Peter the Cruel. There are no such subjects for historical tragedy on earth as are to be found in the Spanish history of that period. I am so much in love with it that I design following up 'Leonor de Guzman' by 'Don Pedro'. The present tragedy, according to the judgment of Leland, is the very best play I have written, both for the closet and the stage. Perhaps I am too ready to agree with him, but long before he said it I had formed the same judgment.\"\n\nThis tragedy was performed at the Philadelphia Walnut Street Theatre, on October 3, 1853, and at the New York Broadway Theatre, on April 24, 1854. Boker wrote to his friends, showing his customary concern about an actress skilled enough for the rôle of his heroine. When, finally, for the Philadelphia première, Julia Dean was decided upon, he thus expressed his verdict to Stoddard, after the opening performance: \"Miss Dean, as far as her physique would admit, played the part admirably, and with a full appreciation of all those things which you call its beauties.\"\n\nDuring these years of correspondence with his friends, Boker was determining to himself the distinction between poetic and dramatic style.\n\n\"Seriously, Dick,\" he writes to Stoddard, on October 6, 1850, \"there is, to my mind, no English diction for your purposes equal to Milton's in his minor poems. Of course any man would be an intensified ass who should attempt to reach the diction of the 'Paradise Lost', or aspire to the tremendous style of Shakespeare. You must not confound things, though. A Lyric diction is one thing—a Dramatic diction is another, requiring the utmost force and conciseness of expression,—and Epic diction is still another; I conceive it to be something between the Lyric and Dramatic, with all the luxuriance of the former, and all the power of the latter.\"\n\nHe must have written to Taylor in the same vein, for, in a letter from the latter, there is assurance that he fully understands what a slow growth dramatic style must be. But Boker was not wholly wed to theatrical demands; he still approached the stage in the spirit of the poet who was torn between loyalty to poetic indirectness, and necessity for direct dialogue. On January 12, 1853, he writes to Stoddard:\n\nTheatricals are in a fine state in this country; every inducement is offered to me to burn my plays as fast as I write them. Yet, what can I do? If I print my plays, the actors take them up, butcher, alter and play them, without giving me so much as a hand in my own damnation. This is something beyond even heavenly rigour; and so I proceed to my own destruction, with the proud consciousness that, at all events, it is my own act. À propos, have you ever read the English acting copy of my \"Calaynos\"? A viler thing was never concocted from like materials.\n\nWhether or not the play, \"The Bankrupt,\" preceded or followed the writing of \"Francesca da Rimini\" in 1853, we have no way of determining; but it would seem that it progressed no further in its stage career than in manuscript form, it being the only play on a modern theme attempted by Boker. Then, it seems, he was hot on the trail of the Francesca love story told in Dante, and used by so many writers in drama and poetry. It is this play, conceded to be his best, which is included in the present collection, and which calls for analysis and history by itself.\n\nTaylor's collection of \"Poems at Home and Abroad,\" dedicated to Boker in 1855, suggests that the two must have continually talked over the possibilities of gathering their best effusions in book form. Did not Taylor write, as early as June 30, 1850, \"You must come out in the Fall with a volume of poems. Stoddard will, and so, I think, will I. You can get a capital volume, with your 'Song', 'Sir John', 'Goblet', and other things…. The publishing showmen would of course parade our wonderful qualities, and the snarling critics in the crowd would show their teeth; but we would be as unmoved as the wax statues of Parkman and Webster, except that there might now and then be a sly wink at each other, when nobody was looking.\" The two friends had been separated for some time, while Taylor wandered over the face of the globe, writing from Cairo, in the shadow of the pyramids, and exclaiming, in Constantinople (July 18, 1852), \"There is a touch of the East in your nature, George.\"\n\nIn 1856, Boker prepared his two volumes of \"Plays and Poems\" for the press. He had won considerable reputation as a sonneteer, and this was further increased by the tradition that Daniel Webster had quoted him at a state dinner in Washington. As yet he was merely a literary poet, and a literary dramatist whose name is usually linked with that Philadelphia group discussed in Vol. II of this collection.[A]\n\nWriting of the Philadelphia of 1868, Leland says:\n\n[It was] \"the Philadelphia when 'Emily Schaumbeg' was the belle and Penington's 'store' was the haunt of the booklover, when snow fell with old fashioned violence, and Third Street was convulsed by old-fashioned panics, when everybody went mad over Offenbach, when one started for New York from the Walnut Street Ferry, when George Boker was writing his dramas and George Childs was beginning to play the public Maecenas.\" Oftentimes the sturdy figure of Walt Whitman could be seen walking on Broad Street, while Horace Greely, buried in newspapers, travelled aboard a boat between New York and Philadelphia.\n\nIt was the Civil War that not only turned Boker's pen to the Union Cause, but changed him politically from a Democrat to a staunch Republican. In fact, his name is closely interwoven with the rehabilitation of the Republican party in Philadelphia. He often confessed that his conscience hurt him many times when he realized he cast his first vote for Buchanan. \"After that,\" he is quoted as having said, \"the sword was drawn; it struck me that politics had vanished entirely from the scene—that it was now merely a question of patriotism or disloyalty.\" His \"Poems of the War,\" issued in 1864, contained such examples of his martial and occasional ability as the \"Dirge for a Soldier,\" \"On the Death of Philip Kearney\" and \"The Black Regiment,\" besides \"On Board the Cumberland\" and the \"Battle of Lookout Mountain.\"\n\nAbout this time, there was founded the Union League Club, with Boker as the leading spirit; through his efforts the war earnestness of the city was concentrated here; from 1863-71 he served as its secretary; from 1879-84 as its President; and his official attitude may be measured in the various annual reports of the organization. But even in those strenuous days—at the period when the Northern spirits lagged over military reverses, and at the time when the indecision of General McClellan drew from him the satiric broadside,—\"Tardy George\"—privately printed in 1865—Boker's thoughts were concerned with poetry. His official laureate consciousness did not serve to improve the verse. His \"Our Heroic Themes\"—written for the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa—was mediocre in everything but intent, recalling what Taylor wrote to him: \"My Harvard poem, [he had read it in 1850 before the same fraternity] poor as it is, was received with great applause; but, alas! I published it, and thus killed the tradition of its excellence, which, had I not done so, might still have been floating around Harvard.\"\n\nIn 1869, Boker issued \"Königsmark, The Legend of the Hounds and other Poems,\" and this ended his dramatic career until his return from abroad, and until Lawrence Barrett came upon the scene with his revival of \"Francesca da Rimini\" and his interest in Boker's other work, to the extent of encouraging him to recast \"Calaynos\" and to prepare \"Nydia\" (1885), later enlarged from two acts to a full sized drama in \"Glaucus\" (1886), both drawing for inspiration on Bulwer's \"The Last Days of Pompeii.\"\n\nPresident Grant sent Boker to Constantinople, as U.S. Minister (his appointment dated November 3, 1871)—an honour undoubtedly bestowed in recognition of his national service. Here he remained four years, \"and during that time secured the redress for wrongs done American subjects by the Syrians, and successfully negotiated two treaties, one having reference to the extradition of criminals, and the other to the naturalization of subjects of little power in the dominions of the other.\" A reception was tendered him on December 22, 1871, by members of the Union League Club, and among those present were Bayard Taylor, Col. George Boker, of the Governor's staff, and son of Boker, and Dr. Charles S. Boker, his brother. Among those who spoke were Robeson, Secretary of the Navy, and Cameron, U.S. Senator from Pennsylvania. Congratulatory letters were received from Bryant, James T. Fields, Stoddard, Lowell, Longfellow, Aldrich, Curtis, and Stedman. On this occasion, Taylor said: \"I know the ripeness and soundness of his mind, the fine balance of his intellectual qualities.\"\n\nOn December 24, 1871, Boker wrote to Leland:\n\nThe scarcest thing with me just now is time. I might give you a shilling at a pinch, but a half hour is an article which I do not happen to have about me…. By the way, your rhapsody over the East in \"M.K.\" [\"Meister Karl\"] had something to do with my acceptance of the Turkish Mission; and if you have been lying, I shall find you out, old boy.\n\nBoker's enthusiasm for Turkish scenery was unbounded, but his difficulties as a diplomat were due to his ignorance of the tongue, and his distrust of interpreters. But by the time his Government was ready to transfer him to another post—that of Minister to Russia (January 3, 1875)—he was heartily sick of his wrangling with the Crescent, and glad, as he wrote Leland, \"to shake the dust of this dismal old city from my shoes, and prepare my toes for a freezing at St. Petersburg.\" He echoed his distaste in later years by writing: \"I hate the East so profoundly that I should not return to it if there were no other land in which I could live.\" This promotion to the Russian court—it was a Russian, Ignatieff, who characterized him as \"of true diplomatic stuff\"—was made in 1875, and he remained there two years.\n\n\"While in Russia,\" we learn, \"he was the only one of our Ministers at foreign courts who was able to checkmate Spain in her controversy with us about the Virginius. He baffled the Spanish Ambassador at St. Petersburg, and influenced Gortschakoff to send a despatch to Madrid, which caused Spain to apologize to the United States; thus averting serious complications.\"\n\nDiplomatic life was not wholly distasteful to him; he possessed social distinction which made him popular at both courts, so much so, indeed, that the Czar cabled to Washington, when a change of administration brought Boker's tenure of office to a close, asking if it were not possible to have him retained. He had had his difficulties at the Porte, as Lowell had had at Madrid. But his artistic nature responded quickly to the picturesqueness of his surroundings. \"Within a mile of me,\" he writes Leland from Turkey,—\"for I am now living at Therapia upon the Bosphorus—there is a delicious encampment of the black tents of a tribe of Gypsies.\" While he was in Russia he was continually supplying Leland with information about gypsies.\n\nHe went to Egypt, at the invitation of the Sultan, and—as though recalling Taylor's longing, in 1852, when he was in Cairo, to have Boker with him—took a trip up the Nile, with Leland, whom he had invited to accompany him. Under the palm trees at Misraim, he had his first meeting with Emerson. The varied foreign travel had broadened his taste, and he was quickly responsive to what he saw. Writes Leland:\n\nI have been with him many times in the Louvre, the great galleries of London and St. Petersburg, and studied with him the stupendous and strange remains of Egyptian art in the Boulak Museum and the Nile temples, but never knew anyone, however learned he might be in such matters, who had a more sincere enjoyment of their greatest results. I remember that he manifested much more interest and deeper feeling for what he saw in Egypt than did Emerson, who was there at the same time, and with whom I conversed daily.\n\nOn January 15, 1878, Boker withdrew from diplomatic life, returning to the United States, where he resumed literary work, his chief interest in the stage being revived by his association with Barrett. His home in Philadelphia—one of the literary centres of the time,—bore traces of his Turkish stay—carpets brought from Constantinople, Arabic designs on the draperies, and rich Eastern colours in the tapestried chairs. His experience was obliged to affect his writing, if not in feeling, at least in expression. I note in his \"Monody,\" written at the time of the death of his friend, the poet, T. Buchanan Read (1822-1872), such lines as \"the hilly Bosphorus,\" and \"… For the hills of Ancient Asia through my trembling tears glimmer like fabrics….\" As early as 1855, he had written for the U.S. Gazette and North American, an article on Read comparing his \"New Pastoral\" with the poetry of Cowper and Thompson. But Read to-day is familiar because of his \"Sheridan's Ride.\" We are told that Boker had a work-room where he delighted in designing metal scrolls.\n\nThere was a slight revival of public interest in his poems, which necessitated the reprinting of several of his books.\n\n\"The last time when I saw him,\" Stoddard recalls in 1890, \"was at the funeral of Taylor, at Cedarcroft, a little more than ten years ago. We rode to the grave, on a hillside, and we rode back to the house. And now he has gone to the great majority!\" Boker died in Philadelphia, January 2, 1890. \"He takes place with Motley on our roll of well-known authors,\" George Parsons Lathrop has written, \"and it is even more remarkable that he should have cultivated poetry in Philadelphia, where the conditions were unfavourable, than that Motley should have taken up history in Boston, where the conditions were wholly propitious.\"\n\nIt is by \"Francesca da Rimini\" that Boker is best remembered. In a letter to Stoddard, March 3, 1853, he writes:\n\nYou will laugh at this, but the thing is so. \"Francesca da Rimini\" is the title. Of course you know the story,—everyone does; but you nor any one else, do not know it as I have treated it. I have great faith in the successful issue of this new attempt. I think all day, and write all night. This is one of my peculiarities, by the bye: a subject seizes me soul and body, which accounts for the rapidity of my execution. My muse resembles a whirlwind: she catches me up, hurries me along, and drops me all breathless at the end of her career.\n\nAnd soon this was followed by the letter so often quoted, showing the white-heat of his enthusiasm:\n\nNow that \"Francesca da Rimini\" is done,—all but the polishing,—I have time to look around and see how I have been neglecting my friends during my state of \"possession.\" Of course you wish to know my opinion of the bantling; I shall suppose you do, at all events. Well, then, I am better satisfied with \"Francesca da Rimini\" than with any of my previous plays. It is impossible for me to say what you, or the world, will say of it; but if it do not please you both, I do not know what I am about. The play is more dramatic than former ones, fiercer in its display of intense passions, and, so far as mere poetry goes, not inferior, if not superior, to any of them. In this play I have dared more, risked more, than I ever had courage to do before. Ergo, if it be not a great triumph, it will certainly be a great failure. I doubt whether you, in a hundred guesses, could hit upon the manner in which I have treated the story. I shall not attempt to prejudice you regarding the play; I would rather have you judge for yourself, even if your decision be adverse. Am I not the devil and all for rapid composition? My speed frightens me, and makes me fearful of the merits of my work. Yet, on coolly going over my work, I find little to object to, either as to the main design or its details. I touch up, here and there, but I do little more. The reason for my rapid writing is that I never attempt putting pen to paper before my design is perfectly mature. I never start with one idea, trusting to the glow of poetical composition for the remainder. That will do in lyrical poetry, but it would be death and damnation to dramatic. But just think of it!—twenty-eight hundred lines in about three weeks! To look back upon such labour is appalling! Let me give you the whole history of my manner of composition in a few words. If it be not interesting to you, you differ from me, and I mistake the kind of matters that interest you. While I am writing I eat little, I drink nothing, I meditate my work, literally, all day. By the time night arrives I am in a highly nervous and excited state. About nine o'clock I begin writing and smoking, and I continue the two exercises, pari passu, until about four o'clock in the morning. Then I reel to bed, half crazy with cigar-smoke and poesy, sleep five hours, and begin the next day as the former. Ordinarily, I sleep from seven to eight hours; but when I am writing, but five,—simply because I cannot sleep any longer at such times. The consequence of this mode of life is that at the end of a long work I sink at once like a spent horse, and have not energy enough to perform the ordinary duties of life. I feel my health giving way under it, but really I do not care. I am ambitious to be remembered among the martyrs.\n\nThis letter is not only significant of Boker's method of workmanship; it is, as well, measure of his charm as a letter writer. For, in correspondence with his close friends, he was as natural with them, as full of force and brightness, as he was in conversation. We find Taylor thanking him at one time, when in distress over family illness and death, for his sustaining words of comfort; we find Leland basking in the warmth of his sheer animal spirits. To the latter, Boker once wrote:\n\nDear old Charley, you are the only man living with whom I can play the fool through a long letter and be sure that I shall be clearly understood at the end. To say that this privilege is cheerful is to say little, for it is the breath of life to a man of a certain humour.\n\nThe \"Francesca\" note, therefore, is typical of Boker's enthusiasm. When Stoddard read the play, we wonder whether he saw in it any similarities to Leigh Hunt's poem on the same subject? For once he had detected in Boker's verses the influence of Hunt. There are critics who claim Boker had read closely Hugo's \"Le Roi s'Amuse.\" But there is only one real comparison to make—with Shakespeare, to the detriment of Boker. His memory beat in Elizabethan rhythm, and beat haltingly. The present Editor began noting on the margin of his copy parallelisms of thought and expression in this \"Francesca\" and in the plays of Shakespeare; these similarities became so many, were so apparent, that it is thought best to omit them. The text used is not based on the manuscripts left by Boker, nor has it been compared with the acting copy made, in 1855, for E.L. Davenport, as has already been done elsewhere in print. I have preferred to use the text finally prepared by Boker for his published plays, this being the one which met with his approval. In 1882, Lawrence Barrett, with the aid of William Winter, prepared an acting version of \"Francesca,\" and it was this which Mr. Otis Skinner used, when he revived the piece in 1901.\n\nA notice in The New York Tribune for 1882 suggests that when E.L. Davenport first essayed \"Francesca da Rimini,\" in 1855, it was in one-act. I can find no corroboration of this statement. The play-bill here reproduced specifically announces a five act tragedy, and it is to be inferred that the form of the play, as given at the Broadway Theatre, New York, September 26, 1855,[B] was the only one used by him. Winter claims that as Lanciotto, Davenport was \"unimaginative, mechanical, and melodramatic,\" and that the whole piece \"proved tedious.\" This is strange, considering the heroic and romantic characteristics in Davenport's method of acting. It may be that he attempted Boker's play because of his interest in the development of American drama. He had assisted Mrs. Mowatt in her career as playwright, and, during his full life, his name was identified with Boker's \"Calaynos,\" George H. Miles's tragedy, \"De Soto, the Hero of the Mississippi,\" and Conrad's \"Jack Cade.\" But the concensus of opinion is that Boker's \"Francesca da Rimini,\" as given by Davenport, was a failure.\n\nAn examination of the cast in the Davenport program with the cast as it was when Boker issued the play, indicates that the text must have been considerably changed, and certain characters omitted, when, at the suggestion of Winter, Lawrence Barrett promised to revive it during the summer of 1882. The scholarly turn of Barrett's mind must have made him ponder it well during a trip he made abroad at the time, and Boker, meanwhile, must have been cutting the cloth to suit the actor's ideas. Barron, one of Barrett's biographers, claims that \"Mr. Barrett saw great possibilities in the work, and with his practical assistance the play was suitably changed, new situations were effected, a more picturesque colouring was given the scenes and story, and all that was repellant in the too close following of Dante [!] was removed.\" The play was given by Barrett, at Haverly's Theatre, Chicago, on September 14, 1882, Otis Skinner playing Paolo, and Marie Wainwright appearing as Francesca. In Winter's estimate of the performance, we find the dominant characteristics being \"moderation\" and \"balanced growth.\" He says of Lanciotto: \"Alertness of the brain sustained it, at every point, in brilliant vigour, and it rose in power, and expanded in terrible beauty, accordingly as it was wrought upon by the pressure of circumstances and the conflict of passions.\"\n\nThe memory of this must have affected the interpretation of Mr. Skinner, when, as Lanciotto, in his revival of the piece at the Chicago Grand Opera House, August 22, 1901, with Aubrey Boucicault as Paolo, Marcia Van Dresser as Francesca, and William Norris as Pepe, he met with such success. \"D'Annunzio gives us the soldier and the brute,\" he wrote me in 1904. \"Boker's hero is an idealist—almost a dreamer.\" The fact is, Boker was recalling his memories of Othello and Richard III, if not of Hamlet, as Skinner suggests. In another respect did the Barrett performance affect the later revival. The portrayal of Pepe, by Norris, was based on what he called \"the James tradition,\" Louis James having, as Winter wrote, \"a laughter that is more terrible than malice.\"\n\nLawrence Barrett's interest in the American drama was never very pronounced. He sought Boker's \"Francesca da Rimini,\" as he sought W.D. Howells' \"Yorick's Love\" (given at Cleveland, Ohio, October 26, 1878), because the rôles therein suited his temperament. Between him and Boker, there was some misunderstanding of short duration, about royalties, but this was bridged over, and Boker's final attempts at playwriting were made for him. The reader is referred to Vol. 32, n.s. Vol. XXV, no. 2, June, 1917, of the Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, for statements as to Boker's \"profits\" from the stage.\n\nAfter Otis Skinner's revival of \"Francesca da Rimini,\" it was played for a while by Frederick Ward and Louis James in association (1893) and by Frank C. Bangs in 1892.\n\nHosts of dramas have been written on \"Francesca da Rimini,\" and every poet has essayed at one time or another to surpass Dante's incomparable lines. Music scores have glorified this passionate love story, while marble and canvas have caught the external expression of it. In its portrayal, actual history has taken on legendary character, and so \"Francesca da Rimini\" now ranks as a theme with the history of Lancelot and Guinevere, of Tristan and Isolde. It has become the inspiration for Maeterlinck in \"Pelléas and Mélisande,\" who has viewed the Italian passion through a mirage of mysticism.\n\nInto \"The Divine Comedy,\" the account of Francesca and Paolo is dropped, keen, sensitive and delicate, as though the poet, a friend of those concerned, wished to cover the hard fact of illicit love in an ecstacy of human feeling. Dante, the supreme master of his age, the incomparable lover of Beatrice, differentiated this tragedy from countless incidents of like character which marked his age. Had the story been preserved only in the form recorded by Boccaccio, it would have been lost in its minor details of history; whereas Dante has glorified it.\n\nBy the very fact that Dante places the two lovers in the circle of the Lustful, it is clear that he realized the enormity of their sin. The theory that his friendship with Guido Novella, the nephew of Francesca, made Dante refrain from entering fully into the incident, will not hold, when it is remembered that the cantos of the Inferno were written in 1300, seventeen years before the poet reached Ravenna, and accepted the hospitality of the Polenta house. Dante's infinite compassion is, therefore, the cause for the compressed poetry of this famous passage.\n\nDante's Francesca lines have been infinitely translated. Longfellow is conscientious; Byron chafes to be freed of the original Italian, and his lines are irksome; Rossetti sees and feels, but he is laboured. Dante, infinitely translated, remains supreme.\n\nThe poems on this ideal love legend are of infinite variety. Tassoni describes Paolo, the warrior, consumed with ravishing love, \"shrunk with misery;\" he fails to reach the youthful passion, and is as mediævally chivalric as is Chaucer in \"The Knightes Tale\" of Palamon and Arcite. Leigh Hunt resorts to stilted narrative and description.\n\nByron once thought to write a drama on this subject; had he done so, Silvio Pellico might have had a formidable rival. More or less, all the playwrights have gone to Italian history, and the more exact they became, the more gross the situation. F. Marion Crawford fell on this rock of accuracy, when he wrote his Francesca play for Mme. Sarah Bernhardt.\n\nSilvio Pellico, who wrote the first drama on \"Francesca da Rimini\" known to modern playgoers, lived his early life in an intensely religious atmosphere, and suffered imprisonment later because of his patriotic tendencies; it is not surprising, therefore, to find in his play—first a national appeal that was to win it applause from all Italy, and then, more important still, a purity of tone that struggled most nobly against an inevitable, passionate end. Paolo is the one who, after some scruples, succumbs; Francesca is infinitely conscious that she is a wife; Giovanni is suspicious. It would seem that Pellico's play is the first that realized the theatrical possibilities of the story; research has brought to light no play manuscript previous to his.\n\nIn the handling of his details, Pellico's incongruities and artificialities are many. Paolo returns from knightly deeds in Asia, to find his father dead—the Malatesta Verucchio who died in 1312, twenty-seven years after Giovanni committed the murder; therefore Pellico gives to the deformed brother the power that history does not wholly accord. The dramatist would avoid the indelicacy he finds in the reading incident, recounting it only in a situation during which Francesca holds aloof in a wild effort to stifle her love. Throughout the play, there is this ruthless twisting, in a desire to conceal wrong and unpardonable sin.\n\nTurning to Uhland's fragmentary ideas, which even he himself was doubtful whether he could handle, an atmosphere confronts us as mediævally German as the \"Der arme Heinrich\" of Hartmann von Aue, which was the inspirational source for Longfellow's \"The Golden Legend.\" Uhland shows heaviness in conception, and a conventionality, thoroughly at variance with the tragedy's original passion. Romantic as he is, he has robbed the story of its warm southern nature, and has thrown his Dante aside to deal with false situation. He seems willing to let fact and spirit go. Paolo is a knight who tilts and worships a glove. Uhland thinks, and he is not alone in his belief, that Francesca had been promised to Paolo before Giovanni was wedded to her; yet if Paolo's marriage with Orabile, in 1269, is to be recognized as correct, historically, logical deductions from dates would discountenance the statement. Neither have I found commentaries to support the theory that Paolo was older than Giovanni, as Uhland sets forth in his play. The servant in Boccaccio here becomes a jealous lover. It is interesting to note the variations of this counter-element in the many play versions of the story—the element that urges Giovanni's suspicion to quick action—the dramatic force of Pepe in Boker; the disappointed motherhood and embittered love of Lucrezia in Stephen Phillips; the inborn savagery of Malatestino in D'Annunzio; the innocent unconsciousness of Concordia in Crawford, which finds similarity in a scene in Maeterlinck's \"Pelléas and Mélisande\" between father and little son. Further, in Uhland, a distorted glimpse of a colourless reportorial figure of Dante, gathering material for his poem, is as meaningless as it is unnecessary for atmosphere.\n\nStephen Phillips, in his Francesca drama, ignores altogether Italian temperament; save for the fact that he occasionally mentions the Tyrant of Rimini, Pesaro and Florence, and that he adheres to historic names, there is more of the English hamlet romance in the piece, than Italian passion. And that cannot be said of Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet.\" Perhaps one may claim for Phillips some of the simplicity of Dante, but there is not the humanity. Undeniably, the English poet is happy in phrase and imagery, but his genius is not so dramatic as it is poetic; he has some of the great lyrical feeling of Tennyson, and he has that which distinguishes the poet from the dramatist—the power to describe situation. One cannot deny the appeal of his girl-Francesca, nor the beauty of many of his haunting lines; but no warm impression of the situation is gained, and the characters are peculiarly inactive at inopportune times. Mr. Phillips's talent was predominantly undramatic; he was too much the poet to allow his feeling to be guided by historical material. Yet, as acted, the play was charmingly simple.\n\nOn the other hand, D'Annunzio, in his drama, saturates himself with the history of Italy. In bulk, his play has not the slightest claim to simplicity; the main object of the dramatist seemed to have been to overweight the scenes with the licentious and rude Italy of the thirteenth century; extraneous side-issues burden the progress of the plot. Yet D'Annunzio has taken care that this does not affect his central theme. On the stage, the scenes appear cumbersome, and the action moves slowly; but, after analyzing the book, it may be claimed for this \"Francesca da Rimini,\" that it reflects the age in which the tragedy occurred. Much artistic construction is shown in the contrast of the Polenta and Malatesta families, and, repellent as he is at times, D'Annunzio has moments of great poetic fervour; his fire swings forth in many of Francesca's speeches, that alternate with the languor of her symbolic nature.\n\nThat his drama on Francesca was definitely constructed for theatrical effect, was openly avowed by Marion Crawford. At the beginning of the French version made for Mme. Bernhardt, he placed material that showed his intention of dealing with fact in the manner of a novelist, and regardless of the sweetness of Dante. To him, Concordia is fourteen, since he considers 1289 as the date of the tragedy, and, with his details from Boccaccio's commentary, he has coarsened Francesca, making her bitterness full of the spleen that could only accompany maturity. A striking point is to be noted in the strong vein of Catholicism that colours many of the speeches.\n\nPaolo's wife, Orabile, moves through the D'Annunzio play with only slight mention—to show the husband's avoidance of her—to draw attention to her deep-rooted aversion to Francesca. Mr. Crawford also brings her on the scene, and has Paolo the cause of her death, wittingly distorting history, since Orabile died many years after the murder of her husband.\n\nThe only American drama on the subject is that by Boker; it is a peculiarly contradictory piece of work, since, from the standpoint of the stage, it is essentially and effectively dramatic, while as literature it is imitative of the Elizabethan style. Boker's poetic imagery is distinctly borrowed, and his choice of words disappointingly colloquial. Yet, over and above the mere story, he has succeeded in portraying a strong character in his Pepe. The historical setting of the play is slight, yet sufficient to localize the piece, and his dramatis personæ are faithfully distinct in outline, though at times devoid of consuming passion.\n\nPhillips as a dramatist has the fault of being diffuse; Boker's style is prosaically plain. Were it not for over-elaboration, D'Annunzio's play might supplant all others because of its spirit. Could we take from Phillips his simplicity, from D'Annunzio his Italian intensity, and from Boker his proportion, and could we add these to Crawford's realization of situation, toned away from his melodramatic tendencies, an ideal drama on \"Francesca da Rimini\" might be constructed.\n\nBut the revitalizing power that was given Shakespeare, has been bequeathed to none who have followed Dante. The one beauty of the Francesca story is the simple element that permeates the dark motive. The genius required to deal with it lies in this: to make one conscious of the tragedy in a touch that recalls the beauty of spring.\n\nIt is strange that no other poet than Dante has succeeded in catching this beauty. No poet, writing directly on the theme, has the subtle feeling which may be compared with that of the Italian. Richard Le Gallienne is infinitely superior to Hunt; Lowell and Gilder beyond the lesser poets,—but all fade before the master. They treat of the vision of Hell, with its whirling wind; of the two in close embrace; there is the kiss that ends the reading of a self-same love; there is the flash of a dagger that joins them eternally in death. These are the themes for the songs. The artists have done with brush and pencil, what the poets have tried in sonnets and verse. But it is Dante who dominates them everyone.\n\nTo me, after tracing in part the development of this Italian tragedy, there remains the charm of Dante's simplicity, and were one to ask, who, among the moderns, have partially reflected his passion, I should turn to Keats' insatiable thirst for beauty in his sonnet, \"A Dream, After reading Dante's Episode of Paolo and Francesca,\" and his account of it in a letter to George and Georgiana Keats (February 14, 1819), and to Carlyle's appreciation of tragedy and love, in \"The Hero as a Poet.\"\n\nBoker's \"Francesca da Rimini\" will stand largely because, in structure and in directness, it is strikingly effective for the stage.\n\n[Footnote A: Duyckinck recalls that, in 1862, R.T. Conrad's\n\n\"Devotional Poems\" were published, edited by Boker.]\n\n[Footnote B: We find a record of Mrs. John Drew having, as Francesca, supported Davenport when the play was taken to Philadelphia.]\n\nBROADWAY THEATRE\n\n* * * * *\n\nLESSEE MR.

I prithee, Rene, charm our ears again\n\nWith the same song you sang me yesterday.\n\nHere are fresh listeners.\n\nRENE. Really, my good lord,\n\nMy voice is out of joint. A grievous cold—\n\n[Coughs.\n\nPAOLO. A very grievous, but convenient cold,\n\nWhich always racks you when you would not sing.\n\nRENE. O, no, my lord! Besides, I hoped to hear\n\nMy ditty warbled into fairer ears,\n\nBy your own lips; to better purpose, too.\n\n[The NOBLEMEN all laugh.\n\nFIRST NOBLEMAN. Rene has hit it.

I'm laughing at the world.\n\nIt has laughed long enough at me; and so\n\nI'll turn the tables. Ho! ho! ho! I've heard\n\nA better joke of Uncle Malatesta's\n\nThan any I e'er uttered.

Poor fops,\n\nWho've slept in down and satin all your years,\n\nWithin the circle Lanciotto charmed\n\nRound Rimini with his most potent sword!—\n\nFellows whose brows would melt beneath a casque,\n\nWhose hands would fray to grasp a brand's rough hilt,\n\nWho ne'er launched more than braggart threats at foes!—\n\nGirlish companions of luxurious girls!—\n\nDanglers round troubadours and wine-cups!—Men\n\nWhose best parts are their clothes! bundles of silk,\n\nScented like summer! rag-men, nothing more!—\n\nCreatures as generous as monkeys—brave\n\nAs hunted hares—courteous as grinning apes—\n\nGrateful as serpents—useful as lap-dogs—\n\n[During this, the NOBLEMEN, &c., steal off.]\n\nHa!\n\nI am alone at last! So let me be,\n\nTill Lanciotto fill the vacant room\n\nOf these mean knaves, whose friendship is but breath. [Exit.\n\nSCENE II.\n\nThe Same. A Hall in the Castle. Enter MALATESTA and LANCIOTTO.\n\nMALATESTA. Guido, ay, Guido of Ravenna, son—\n\nDown on his knees, as full of abject prayers\n\nFor peace and mercy as a penitent.\n\nLANCIOTTO. His old trick, father. While his wearied arm\n\nIs raised in seeming prayer, it only rests.\n\nAnon, he'll deal you such a staggering blow,\n\nWith its recovered strength, as shall convert\n\nYou, and not him, into a penitent.\n\nMALATESTA. No, no; your last bout levelled him. He reeled\n\nInto Ravenna, from the battle-field,\n\nLike a stripped drunkard, and there headlong fell—\n\nA mass of squalid misery, a thing\n\nTo draw the jeering urchins. I have this\n\nFrom faithful spies. There's not a hope remains\n\nTo break the shock of his great overthrow.\n\nI pity Guido.\n\nLANCIOTTO. 'Sdeath! go comfort him!\n\nI pity those who fought, and bled, and died,\n\nBefore the armies of this Ghibelin.\n\nI pity those who halted home with wounds\n\nDealt by his hand. I pity widowed eyes\n\nThat he set running; maiden hearts that turn,\n\nSick with despair, from ranks thinned down by him;\n\nMothers that shriek, as the last stragglers fling\n\nTheir feverish bodies by the fountain-side,\n\nDumb with mere thirst, and faintly point to him,\n\nAnswering the dame's quick questions. I have seen\n\nUnburied bones, and skulls—that seemed to ask,\n\nFrom their blank eye-holes, vengeance at my hand—\n\nShine in the moonlight on old battle-fields;\n\nAnd even these—the happy dead, my lord—\n\nI pity more than Guido of Ravenna!\n\nMALATESTA. What would you have?\n\nLANCIOTTO. I'd see Ravenna burn,\n\nFlame into heaven, and scorch the flying clouds;\n\nI'd choke her streets with ruined palaces;\n\nI'd hear her women scream with fear and grief,\n\nAs I have heard the maids of Rimini.\n\nAll this I'd sprinkle with old Guido's blood,\n\nAnd bless the baptism.\n\nMALATESTA. You are cruel.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Not I;\n\nBut these things ache within my fretting brain.\n\nThe sight I first beheld was from the arms\n\nOf my wild nurse, her husband hacked to death\n\nBy the fierce edges of these Ghibelins.\n\nOne cut across the neck—I see it now,\n\nAy, and have mimicked it a thousand times,\n\nJust as I saw it, on our enemies.—\n\nWhy, that cut seemed as if it meant to bleed\n\nOn till the judgment. My distracted nurse\n\nStooped down, and paddled in the running gore\n\nWith her poor fingers; then a prophetess,\n\nPale with the inspiration of the god,\n\nShe towered aloft, and with her dripping hand\n\nThree times she signed me with the holy cross.\n\nTis all as plain as noon-day. Thus she spake,—\n\n\"May this spot stand till Guido's dearest blood\n\nBe mingled with thy own!\" The soldiers say,\n\nIn the close battle, when my wrath is up,\n\nThe dead man's blood flames on my vengeful brow\n\nLike a red planet; and when war is o'er,\n\nIt shrinks into my brain, defiling all\n\nMy better nature with its slaughterous lusts.\n\nHowe'er it be, it shaped my earliest thought,\n\nAnd it will shape my last.\n\nMALATESTA. You moody churl!\n\nYou dismal knot of superstitious dreams!\n\nDo you not blush to empty such a head\n\nBefore a sober man? Why, son, the world\n\nHas not given o'er its laughing humour yet,\n\nThat you should try it with such vagaries.—Poh!\n\nI'll get a wife to teach you common sense.\n\nLANCIOTTO. A wife for me! [Laughing.\n\nMALATESTA. Ay, sir, a wife for you.\n\nYou shall be married, to insure your wits.\n\nLANCIOTTO. 'Tis not your wont to mock me.\n\nMALATESTA. How now, son!\n\nI am not given to jesting. I have chosen\n\nThe fairest wife in Italy for you.\n\nYou won her bravely, as a soldier should:\n\nAnd when you'd woo her, stretch your gauntlet out,\n\nAnd crush her fingers in its steely grip.\n\nIf you will plead, I ween, she dare not say—\n\nNo, by your leave. Should she refuse, howe'er,\n\nWith that same iron hand you shall go knock\n\nUpon Ravenna's gates, till all the town\n\nRing with your courtship. I have made her hand\n\nThe price and pledge of Guido's future peace.\n\nLANCIOTTO. All this is done!\n\nMALATESTA. Done, out of hand; and now\n\nI wait a formal answer, nothing more.\n\nGuido dare not decline. No, by the saints,\n\nHe'd send Ravenna's virgins here in droves,\n\nTo buy a ten days' truce.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Sir, let me say,\n\nYou stretch paternal privilege too far,\n\nTo pledge my hand without my own consent.\n\nAm I a portion of your household stuff,\n\nThat you should trade me off to Guido thus?\n\nWho is the lady I am bartered for?\n\nMALATESTA. Francesca, Guido's daughter.—Never frown;\n\nIt shall be so!\n\nLANCIOTTO. By heaven, it shall not be!\n\nMy blood shall never mingle with his race.\n\nMALATESTA. According to your nurse's prophecy,\n\nFate orders it.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Ha!\n\nMALATESTA. Now, then, I have struck\n\nThe chord that answers to your gloomy thoughts.\n\nBah! on your sibyl and her prophecy!\n\nPut Guido's blood aside, and yet, I say,\n\nMarry you shall.\n\nLANCIOTTO. 'Tis most distasteful, sir.\n\nMALATESTA. Lanciotto, look ye! You brave gentlemen,\n\nSo fond of knocking out poor people's brains,\n\nIn time must come to have your own knocked out:\n\nWhat, then, if you bequeath us no new hands,\n\nTo carry on your business, and our house\n\nDie out for lack of princes?\n\nLANCIOTTO. Wed my brothers:\n\nThey'll rear you sons, I'll slay you enemies.\n\nPaolo and Francesca! Note their names;\n\nThey chime together like sweet marriage-bells.\n\nA proper match. 'Tis said she's beautiful;\n\nAnd he is the delight of Rimini,—\n\nThe pride and conscious centre of all eyes,\n\nThe theme of poets, the ideal of art,\n\nThe earthly treasury of Heaven's best gifts!\n\nI am a soldier; from my very birth,\n\nHeaven cut me out for terror, not for love.\n\nI had such fancies once, but now—\n\nMALATESTA. Pshaw! son,\n\nMy faith is bound to Guido; and if you\n\nDo not throw off your duty, and defy,\n\nThrough sickly scruples, my express commands,\n\nYou'll yield at once. No more: I'll have it so! [Exit.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Curses upon my destiny! What, I—\n\nHo! I have found my use at last—What, I,\n\nI, the great twisted monster of the wars,\n\nThe brawny cripple, the herculean dwarf,\n\nThe spur of panic, and the butt of scorn—\n\nbe a bridegroom! Heaven, was I not cursed\n\nMore than enough, when thou didst fashion me\n\nTo be a type of ugliness,—a thing\n\nBy whose comparison all Rimini\n\nHolds itself beautiful? Lo! here I stand,\n\nA gnarléd, blighted trunk! There's not a knave\n\nSo spindle-shanked, so wry-faced, so infirm,\n\nWho looks at me, and smiles not on himself.\n\nAnd I have friends to pity me—great Heaven!\n\nOne has a favourite leg that he bewails,—\n\nAnother sees my hip with doleful plaints,—\n\nA third is sorry o'er my huge swart arms,—\n\nA fourth aspires to mount my very hump,\n\nAnd thence harangue his weeping brotherhood!\n\nPah! it is nauseous! Must I further bear\n\nThe sidelong shuddering glances of a wife?\n\nThe degradation of a showy love,\n\nThat over-acts, and proves the mummer's craft\n\nUntouched by nature? And a fair wife, too!—\n\nFrancesca, whom the minstrels sing about!\n\nThough, by my side, what woman were not fair?\n\nCirce looked well among her swine, no doubt;\n\nNext me, she'd pass for Venus. Ho! ho! ho! [Laughing.]\n\nWould there were something merry in my laugh!\n\nNow, in the battle, if a Ghibelin\n\nCry, \"Wry-hip! hunchback!\" I can trample him\n\nUnder my stallion's hoofs; or haggle him\n\nInto a monstrous likeness of myself:\n\nBut to be pitied,—to endure a sting\n\nThrust in by kindness, with a sort of smile!—\n\n'Sdeath! it is miserable!\n\n[Enter PEPE.\n\nPEPE. My lord—\n\nLANCIOTTO. My fool!\n\nPEPE. We'll change our titles when your bride's bells ring—\n\nHa, cousin?\n\nLANCIOTTO. Even this poor fool has eyes,\n\nTo see the wretched plight in which I stand.\n\n[Aside.]\n\nHow, gossip, how?\n\nPEPE. I, being the court-fool,\n\nAm lord of fools by my prerogative.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Who told you of my marriage?\n\nPEPE. Rimini!\n\nA frightful liar; but true for once, I fear.\n\nThe messenger from Guido has returned,\n\nAnd the whole town is wailing over him.\n\nSome pity you, and some the bride; but I,\n\nBeing more catholic, I pity both.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Still, pity, pity! [Aside. Bells toll.] Ha! whose knell is that?\n\nPEPE. Lord Malatesta sent me to the tower,\n\nTo have the bells rung for your marriage-news.\n\nHow, he said not; so I, as I thought fit,\n\nTold the deaf sexton to ring out a knell.\n\n[Bells toll.]\n\nHow do you like it?\n\nLANCIOTTO. Varlet, have you bones,\n\nTo risk their breaking? I have half a mind\n\nTo thresh you from your motley coat!\n\n[Seizes him.\n\nPEPE. Pardee!\n\nRespect my coxcomb, cousin. Hark! ha, ha!\n\n[Laughing.]\n\n[Bells ring a joyful peal.]\n\nSome one has changed my music. Heaven defend!\n\nHow the bells jangle. Yonder graybeard, now,\n\nRings a peal vilely. He's more used to knells,\n\nAnd sounds them grandly. Only give him time,\n\nAnd, I'll be sworn, he'll ring your knell out yet.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Pepe, you are but half a fool.\n\nPEPE. My lord,\n\nI can return the compliment in full.\n\nLANCIOTTO. So, you are ready.\n\nPEPE. Truth is always so.\n\nLANCIOTTO. I shook you rudely; here's a florin.\n\n[Offers money.\n\nPEPE. No:\n\nMy wit is merchandise, but not my honour.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Your honour, sirrah!\n\nPEPE. Why not? You great lords\n\nHave something you call lordly honour; pray,\n\nMay not a fool have foolish honour, too?\n\nCousin, you laid your hand upon my coat—\n\n'Twas the first sacrilege it ever knew—And\n\nyou shall pay it. Mark! I promise you.\n\nLANCIOTTO. [Laughing.] Ha, ha! you bluster well. Upon my life,\n\nYou have the tilt-yard jargon to a breath.\n\nPepe, if I should smite you on the cheek—\n\nThus, gossip, thus—[Strikes him.] what would you then demand?\n\nPEPE. Your life!\n\nLANCIOTTO. [Laughing.] Ha, ha! there is the camp-style, too,\n\nA very cut-throat air! How this shrewd fool\n\nMakes the punctilio of honour show!\n\nChange helmets into coxcombs, swords to baubles,\n\nAnd what a figure is poor chivalry!\n\nThanks for your lesson, Pepe.\n\n[Exit.\n\nPEPE. Ere I'm done,\n\nYou'll curse as heartily, you limping beast!\n\nHa! so we go—Lord Lanciotto, look!\n\n[Walks about, mimicking him.]\n\nHere is a leg and camel-back, forsooth,\n\nTo match your honour and nobility!\n\nYou miscreated scarecrow, dare you shake,\n\nOr strike in jest, a natural man like me?—\n\nYou curséd lump, you chaos of a man,\n\nTo buffet one whom Heaven pronounces good!\n\n[Bells ring.]\n\nThere go the bells rejoicing over you:\n\nI'll change them back to the old knell again.\n\nYou marry, faugh! Beget a race of elves;\n\nWed a she-crocodile, and keep within\n\nThe limits of your nature! Here we go,\n\nTripping along to meet our promised bride,\n\nLike a rheumatic elephant!—ha, ha! [Laughing.\n\n[Exit, mimicking LANCIOTTO.\n\nSCENE III.\n\nThe Same. A Room in the Same. Enter LANCIOTTO, hastily.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Why do these prodigies environ me?\n\nIn ancient Rome, the words a fool might drop,\n\nFrom the confusion of his vagrant thoughts,\n\nWere held as omens, prophecies; and men\n\nWho made earth tremble with majestic deeds,\n\nTrembled themselves at fortune's lightest threat.\n\nI like it not. My father named this match\n\nWhile I boiled over with vindictive wrath\n\nTowards Guido and Ravenna. Straight my heart\n\nSank down like lead; a weakness seized on me,\n\nA dismal gloom that I could not resist;\n\nI lacked the power to take my stand, and say—\n\nBluntly, I will not! Am I in the toils?\n\nHas fate so weakened me, to work its end?\n\nThere seems a fascination in it, too,—\n\nA morbid craving to pursue a thing\n\nWhose issue may be fatal. Would that I\n\nWere in the wars again! These mental weeds\n\nGrow on the surface of inactive peace.\n\nI'm haunted by myself. Thought preys on thought.\n\nMy mind seems crowded in the hideous mould\n\nThat shaped my body. What a fool am I\n\nTo bear the burden of my wretched life,\n\nTo sweat and toil under the world's broad eye,\n\nClimb into fame, and find myself—O, what?—\n\nA most conspicuous monster! Crown my head,\n\nPile Cæsar's purple on me—and what then?\n\nMy hump shall shorten the imperial robe,\n\nMy leg peep out beneath the scanty hem,\n\nMy broken hip shall twist the gown awry;\n\nAnd pomp, instead of dignifying me,\n\nShall be by me made quite ridiculous.\n\nThe faintest coward would not bear all this:\n\nProdigious courage must be mine, to live;\n\nTo die asks nothing but weak will, and I\n\nFeel like a craven. Let me skulk away\n\nEre life o'ertask me. [Offers to stab himself.\n\nEnter PAOLO.\n\nPAOLO. [Seizing his hand.] Brother! what is this?\n\nLanciotto, are you mad? Kind Heaven! look here—\n\nStraight in my eyes. Now answer, do you know\n\nHow near you were to murder? Dare you bend\n\nYour wicked hand against a heart I love?\n\nWere it for you to mourn your wilful death,\n\nWith such a bitterness as would be ours,\n\nThe wish would ne'er have crossed you. While we're bound\n\nLife into life, a chain of loving hearts,\n\nWere it not base in you, the middle link,\n\nTo snap, and scatter all? Shame, brother, shame!\n\nI thought you better metal.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Spare your words.\n\nI know the seasons of our human grief,\n\nAnd can predict them without almanac.\n\nA few sobs o'er the body, and a few\n\nOver the coffin; then a sigh or two,\n\nWhose windy passage dries the hanging tear;\n\nPerchance, some wandering memories, some regrets;\n\nThen a vast influx of consoling thoughts—\n\nBased on the trials of the sadder days\n\nWhich the dead missed; and then a smiling face\n\nTurned on to-morrow. Such is mortal grief.\n\nIt writes its histories within a span,\n\nAnd never lives to read them.\n\nPAOLO. Lanciotto,\n\nI heard the bells of Rimini, just now,\n\nExulting o'er your coming marriage-day,\n\nWhile you conspired to teach them gloomier sounds.\n\nWhy are you sad?\n\nLANCIOTTO. Paolo, I am wretched;\n\nSad's a faint word. But of my marriage-bells—\n\nHeard you the knell that Pepe rang?\n\nPAOLO. 'Twas strange:\n\nA sullen antic of his crabbed wit.\n\nLANCIOTTO. It was portentous. All dumb things find tongues\n\nAgainst this marriage. As I passed the hall,\n\nMy armour glittered on the wall, and I\n\nPaused by the harness, as before a friend\n\nWhose well-known features slack our hurried gait;\n\nFrancesca's name was fresh upon my mind,\n\nSo I half-uttered it. Instant, my sword\n\nLeaped from its scabbard, as with sudden life,\n\nPlunged down and pierced into the oaken floor,\n\nShivering with fear! Lo! while I gazed upon it—\n\nDoubting the nature of the accident—\n\nAround the point appeared a spot of blood,\n\nOozing upon the floor, that spread and spread—\n\nAs I stood gasping by in speechless horror—\n\nRing beyond ring, until the odious tide\n\nCrawled to my feet, and lapped them, like the tongues\n\nOf angry serpents! O, my God! I fled\n\nAt the first touch of the infernal stain!\n\nGo—you may see—go to the hall!\n\nPAOLO. Fie! man,\n\nYou have been ever played on in this sort\n\nBy your wild fancies. When your heart is high,\n\nYou make them playthings; but in lower moods,\n\nThey seem to sap the essence of your soul,\n\nAnd drain your manhood to its poorest dregs.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Go look, go look!\n\nPAOLO. [Goes to the door, and returns.] There sticks the sword, indeed,\n\nJust as your tread detached it from its sheath;\n\nLooking more like a blessed cross, I think,\n\nThan a bad looking omen. As for blood—Ha, ha!\n\n[Laughing.]\n\nIt sets mine dancing. Pshaw! away with this!\n\nDeck up your face with smiles. Go trim yourself\n\nFor the young bride. New velvet, gold, and gems,\n\nDo wonders for us. Brother, come; I'll be\n\nYour tiring-man, for once.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Array this lump—\n\nPaolo, hark! There are some human thoughts\n\nBest left imprisoned in the aching heart,\n\nLest the freed malefactors should dispread\n\nInfamous ruin with their liberty.\n\nThere's not a man—the fairest of ye all—\n\nWho is not fouler than he seems. This life\n\nIs one unending struggle to conceal\n\nOur baseness from our fellows. Here stands one\n\nIn vestal whiteness with a lecher's lust;—\n\nThere sits a judge, holding law's scales in hands\n\nThat itch to take the bribe he dare not touch;—\n\nHere goes a priest with heavenward eyes, whose soul\n\nIs Satan's council-chamber;—there a doctor,\n\nWith nature's secrets wrinkled round a brow\n\nGuilty with conscious ignorance;—and here\n\nA soldier rivals Hector's bloody deeds—\n\nOut-does the devil in audacity—\n\nWith craven longings fluttering in a heart\n\nThat dares do aught but fly! Thus are we all\n\nMere slaves and alms-men to a scornful world,\n\nThat takes us at our seeming.\n\nPAOLO. Say 'tis true;\n\nWhat do you drive at?\n\nLANCIOTTO. At myself, full tilt.\n\nI, like the others, am not what I seem.\n\nMen call me gentle, courteous, brave.—They lie!\n\nI'm harsh, rude, and a coward. Had I nerve\n\nTo cast my devils out upon the earth,\n\nI'd show this laughing planet what a hell\n\nOf envy, malice, cruelty, and scorn,\n\nIt has forced back to canker in the heart\n\nOf one poor cripple!\n\nPAOLO. Ha!\n\nLANCIOTTO. Ay, now 'tis out!\n\nA word I never breathed to man before.\n\nCan you, who are a miracle of grace,\n\nFeel what it is to be a wreck like me?\n\nPaolo, look at me. Is there a line,\n\nIn my whole bulk of wretched contraries,\n\nThat nature in a nightmare ever used\n\nUpon her shapes till now? Find me the man,\n\nOr beast, or tree, or rock, or nameless thing,\n\nSo out of harmony with all things else,\n\nAnd I'll go raving with bare happiness,—\n\nAy, and I'll marry Helena of Greece,\n\nAnd swear I do her honour!\n\nPAOLO. Lanciotto,\n\nI, who have known you from a stripling up,\n\nNever observed, or, if I did, ne'er weighed\n\nYour special difference from the rest of men.\n\nYou're not Apollo—\n\nLANCIOTTO. No!\n\nPAOLO. Nor yet are you\n\nA second Pluto. Could I change with you—\n\nMy graces for your nobler qualities—\n\nYour strength, your courage, your renown—by heaven,\n\nWe'd e'en change persons, to the finest hair.\n\nLANCIOTTO. You should be flatterer to an emperor.\n\nPAOLO. I am but just. Let me beseech you, brother.\n\nTo look with greater favour on yourself;\n\nNor suffer misty phantoms of your brain\n\nTo take the place of sound realities.\n\nGo to Ravenna, wed your bride, and lull\n\nYour cruel delusions in domestic peace.\n\nGhosts fly a fireside; 'tis their wont to stalk\n\nThrough empty houses, and through empty hearts.\n\nI know Francesca will be proud of you.\n\nWomen admire you heroes. Rusty sages,\n\nPale poets, and scarred warriors, have been\n\nTheir idols ever; while we fair plump fools\n\nAre elbowed to the wall, or only used\n\nFor vacant pastime.\n\nLANCIOTTO. To Ravenna?—no!\n\nIn Rimini they know me; at Ravenna\n\nI'd be a new-come monster, and exposed\n\nTo curious wonder. There will be parade\n\nOf all the usual follies of the state;\n\nFellows with trumpets, tinselled coats, and wands,\n\nWould strut before me, like vain mountebanks\n\nBefore their monkeys. Then, I should be stared\n\nOut of my modesty; and when they look,\n\nHow can I tell if 'tis the bridegroom's face\n\nOr hump that draws their eyes? I will not go.\n\nTo please you all, I'll marry; but to please\n\nThe wonder-mongers of Ravenna—Ha!\n\nPaolo, now I have it. You shall go,\n\nTo bring Francesca; and you'll speak of me,\n\nNot as I ought to be, but as I am.\n\nIf she draw backward, give her rein; and say\n\nThat neither Guido-nor herself shall feel\n\nThe weight of my displeasure. You may say,\n\nI pity her—\n\nPAOLO. For what?\n\nLANCIOTTO. For wedding me.\n\nIn sooth, she'll need it. Say—\n\nPAOLO. Nay, Lanciotto,\n\nI'll be a better orator in your behalf,\n\nWithout your promptings.\n\nLANCIOTTO. She is fair, 'tis said;\n\nAnd, dear Paolo, if she please your eye,\n\nAnd move your heart to anything like love,\n\nWed her yourself. The peace would stand as firm\n\nBy such a match.\n\nPAOLO. [Laughing.] Ha! that is right: be gay!\n\nPly me with jokes! I'd rather see you smile\n\nThan see the sun shine.\n\nLANCIOTTO. I am serious.\n\nI'll find another wife, less beautiful,\n\nMore on my level, and—\n\nPAOLO. An empress, brother,\n\nWere honoured by your hand. You are by much\n\nToo humble in your reckoning of yourself.\n\nI can count virtues in you, to supply\n\nHalf Italy, if they were parcelled out.\n\nLook up!\n\nLANCIOTTO. I cannot: Heaven has bent me down.\n\nTo you, Paolo, I could look, however,\n\nWere my hump made a mountain. Bless him, God!\n\nPour everlasting bounties on his head!\n\nMake Croesus jealous of his treasury,\n\nAchilles of his arms, Endymion\n\nOf his fresh beauties,—though the coy one lay,\n\nBlushing beneath Diana's earliest kiss,\n\nOn grassy Latmos; and may every good,\n\nBeyond man's sight, though in the ken of heaven,\n\nRound his fair fortune to a perfect end!\n\nO, you have dried the sorrow of my eyes;\n\nMy heart is beating with a lighter pulse;\n\nThe air is musical; the total earth\n\nPuts on new beauty, and within the arms\n\nOf girding ocean dreams her time away,\n\nAnd visions bright to-morrows!\n\nEnter MALATESTA and PEPE.\n\nMALATESTA. Mount, to horse!\n\nPEPE. [Aside.] Good Lord! he's smiling! What's the matter now?\n\nHas anybody broken a leg or back?\n\nHas a more monstrous monster come to life?\n\nIs hell burst open?—heaven burnt up? What, what\n\nCan make yon eyesore grin?—I say, my lord,\n\nWhat cow has calved?\n\nPAOLO. Your mother, by the bleat.\n\nPEPE. Right fairly answered—for a gentleman!\n\nWhen did you take my trade up?\n\nPAOLO. When your wit\n\nWent begging, sirrah.\n\nPEPE. Well again! My lord,\n\nI think he'll do.\n\nMALATESTA. For what?\n\nPEPE. To take my place.\n\nOnce fools were rare, and then my office sped;\n\nBut now the world is overrun with them:\n\nOne gets one's fool in one's own family,\n\nWithout much searching.\n\nMALATESTA. Pepe, gently now.\n\nLanciotto, you are waited for. The train\n\nHas passed the gate, and halted there for you.\n\nLANCIOTTO. I go not to Ravenna.\n\nMALATESTA. Hey! why not?\n\nPAOLO. For weighty reasons, father. Will you trust\n\nYour greatest captain, hope of all the Guelfs,\n\nWith crafty Guido? Should the Ghibelins\n\nBreak faith, and shut Lanciotto in their walls—\n\nSure the temptation would be great enough—\n\nWhat would you do?\n\nMALATESTA. I'd eat Ravenna up!\n\nPEPE. Lord! what an appetite!\n\nPAOLO. But Lanciotto\n\nWould be a precious hostage.\n\nMALATESTA. True; you're wise;\n\nGuido's a fox. Well, have it your own way.\n\nWhat is your plan?\n\nPAOLO. I go there in his place.\n\nMALATESTA. Good! I will send a letter with the news.\n\nLANCIOTTO. I thank you, brother. [Apart to PAOLO.\n\nPEPE. Ha! ha! ha!—O! O! [Laughing.\n\nMALATESTA. Pepe, what now?\n\nPEPE. O! lord, O!—ho! ho! ho! [Laughing.\n\nPAOLO. Well, giggler?\n\nPEPE. Hear my fable, uncle.\n\nMALATESTA. Ay.\n\nPEPE. Once on a time, Vulcan sent Mercury\n\nTo fetch dame Venus from a romp in heaven.\n\nWell, they were long in coming, as he thought;\n\nAnd so the god of spits and gridirons\n\nRailed like himself—the devil. But—now mark—\n\nHere comes the moral. In a little while,\n\nVulcan grew proud, because he saw plain signs\n\nThat he should be a father; and so he\n\nStrutted through hell, and pushed the devils by,\n\nLike a magnifico of Venice. Ere long,\n\nHis heir was born; but then—ho! ho!—the brat\n\nHad wings upon his heels, and thievish ways,\n\nAnd a vile squint, like errant Mercury's,\n\nWhich honest Vulcan could not understand;—\n\nCan you?\n\nPAOLO. 'Sdeath! fool, I'll have you in the stocks.\n\nFather, your fool exceeds his privilege.\n\nPEPE. [Apart to PAOLO.] Keep your own bounds, Paolo. In the stocks\n\nI'd tell more fables than you'd wish to hear.\n\nAnd so ride forth. But, cousin, don't forget\n\nTo take Lanciotto's picture to the bride.\n\nAsk her to choose between it and yourself.\n\nI'll count the moments, while she hesitates,\n\nAnd not grow gray at it.\n\nPAOLO. Peace, varlet, peace!\n\nPEPE. [Apart to him.] Ah, now I have it. There's an elephant\n\nUpon the scutcheon; show her that, and say—\n\nHere's Lanciotto in our heraldry!\n\nPAOLO. Here's for your counsel!\n\n[Strikes PEPE, who runs behind MALATESTA.\n\nMALATESTA. Son, son, have a care!\n\nWe who keep pets must bear their pecks sometimes.\n\nPoor knave! Ha! ha! thou'rt growing villainous!\n\n[Laughs and pats PEPE.\n\nPEPE. Another blow! another life for that! [Aside.\n\nPAOLO. Farewell, Lanciotto. You are dull again.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Nature will rule.\n\nMALATESTA. Come, come!\n\nLANCIOTTO. God speed you, brother!\n\nI am too sad; my smiles all turn to sighs.\n\nPAOLO. More cause to haste me on my happy work.\n\n[Exit with MALATESTA.\n\nPEPE. I'm going, cousin.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Go.\n\nPEPE. Pray, ask me where.\n\nLANCIOTTO. Where, then?\n\nPEPE. To have my jewel carried home:\n\nAnd, as I'm wise, the carrier shall be\n\nA thief, a thief, by Jove! The fashion's new.\n\n[Exit.\n\nLANCIOTTO. In truth, I am too gloomy and irrational.\n\nPaolo must be right. I always had\n\nThese moody hours and dark presentiments,\n\nWithout mischances following after them.\n\nThe camp is my abode. A neighing steed,\n\nA fiery onset, and a stubborn fight,\n\nRouse my dull blood, and tire my body down\n\nTo quiet slumbers when the day is o'er,\n\nAnd night above me spreads her spangled tent,\n\nLit by the dying cresset of the moon.\n\nAy, that is it; I'm homesick for the camp.\n\n[Exit.\n\nACT II.\n\nSCENE I. Ravenna. A Room in GUIDO'S Palace. Enter GUIDO and a CARDINAL.\n\nCARDINAL. I warn thee, Count.\n\nGUIDO. I'll take the warning, father,\n\nOn one condition: show me but a way\n\nFor safe escape.\n\nCARDINAL. I cannot.\n\nGUIDO. There's the point.\n\nWe Ghibelins are fettered hand and foot.\n\nThere's not a florin in my treasury;\n\nNot a lame soldier, I can lead to war;\n\nNot one to man the walls. A present siege,\n\nPushed with the wonted heat of Lanciotto,\n\nWould deal Ravenna such a mortal blow\n\nAs ages could not mend. Give me but time\n\nTo fill the drained arteries of the land.\n\nThe Guelfs are masters, we their slaves; and we\n\nWere wiser to confess it, ere the lash\n\nTeach it too sternly. It is well for you\n\nTo say you love Francesca. So do I;\n\nBut neither you nor I have any voice\n\nFor or against this marriage.\n\nCARDINAL. 'Tis too true.\n\nGUIDO. Say we refuse: Why, then, before a week,\n\nWe'll hear Lanciotto rapping at our door,\n\nWith twenty hundred ruffians at his back.\n\nWhat's to say then? My lord, we waste our breath.\n\nLet us look fortune in the face, and draw\n\nSuch comfort from the wanton as we may.\n\nCARDINAL. And yet I fear—\n\nGUIDO. You fear! and so do I.\n\nI fear Lanciotto as a soldier, though,\n\nMore than a son-in-law.\n\nCARDINAL. But have you seen him?\n\nGUIDO. Ay, ay, and felt him, too. I've seen him ride\n\nThe best battalions of my horse and foot\n\nDown like mere stubble: I have seen his sword\n\nHollow a square of pikemen, with the ease\n\nYou'd scoop a melon out.\n\nCARDINAL. Report declares him\n\nA prodigy of strength and ugliness.\n\nGUIDO. Were he the devil—But why talk of this?—\n\nHere comes Francesca.\n\nCARDINAL. Ah! unhappy child!\n\nGUIDO. Look you, my lord! you'll make the best of it;\n\nYou will not whimper. Add your voice to mine,\n\nOr woe to poor Ravenna!\n\nEnter FRANCESCA and RITTA.\n\nFRANCESCA. Ha! my lord—\n\nAnd you, my father!—But do I intrude\n\nUpon your counsels? How severe you look!\n\nShall I retire?\n\nGUIDO. No, no.\n\nFRANCESCA. You moody men\n\nSeem leagued against me. As I passed the hall,\n\nI met your solemn Dante, with huge strides\n\nPacing in measure to his stately verse.\n\nThe sweeping sleeves of his broad scarlet robe\n\nBlew out behind, like wide-expanded wings,\n\nAnd seemed to buoy him in his level flight.\n\nThinking to pass, without disturbing him,\n\nI stole on tip-toe; but the poet paused,\n\nSubsiding into man, and steadily\n\nBent on my face the lustre of his eyes.\n\nThen, taking both my trembling hands in his—\n\nYou know how his God-troubled forehead awes—\n\nHe looked into my eyes, and shook his head,\n\nAs if he dared not speak of what he saw;\n\nThen muttered, sighed, and slowly turned away\n\nThe weight of his intolerable brow.\n\nWhen I glanced back, I saw him, as before,\n\nSailing adown the hall on out-spread wings.\n\nIndeed, my lord, he should not do these things;\n\nThey strain the weakness of mortality\n\nA jot too far. As for poor Ritta, she\n\nFled like a doe, the truant.\n\nRITTA. Yes, forsooth:\n\nThere's something terrible about the man.\n\nUgh! if he touched me, I should turn to ice.\n\nI wonder if Count Lanciotto looks—\n\nGUIDO. Ritta, come here. [Takes her apart.\n\nRITTA. My lord.\n\nGUIDO. 'Twas my command,\n\nYou should say nothing of Count Lanciotto.\n\nRITTA. Nothing, my lord.\n\nGUIDO. You have said nothing, then?\n\nRITTA. Indeed, my lord.\n\nGUIDO. 'Tis well. Some years ago,\n\nMy daughter had a very silly maid,\n\nWho told her sillier stories. So, one day,\n\nThis maiden whispered something I forbade—\n\nIn strictest confidence, for she was sly:\n\nWhat happened, think you?\n\nRITTA. I know not, my lord.\n\nGUIDO. I boiled her in a pot.\n\nRITTA. Good heaven! my lord.\n\nGUIDO. She did not like it. I shall keep that pot\n\nReady for the next boiling.\n\n[Walks back to the others.\n\nRITTA. Saints above!\n\nI wonder if he ate her! Boil me—me!\n\nI'll roast or stew with pleasure; but to boil\n\nImplies a want of tenderness,—or rather\n\nA downright toughness—in the matter boiled,\n\nThat's slanderous to a maiden. What, boil me—\n\nBoil me! O! mercy, how ridiculous!\n\n[Retires, laughing.\n\nEnter a MESSENGER.\n\nMESSENGER. Letters, my lord, from great Prince Malatesta.\n\n[Presents them, and exit.\n\nGUIDO. [Aside.] Hear him, ye gods!—\"from great Prince Malatesta!\"\n\nGreeting, no doubt, his little cousin Guido.\n\nWell, well, just so we see-saw up and down.\n\n[Reads.]\n\n\"Fearing our treachery,\"—by heaven, that's blunt,\n\nAnd Malatesta-like!—\"he will not send\n\nHis son, Lanciotto, to Ravenna, but\"—\n\nBut what?—a groom, a porter? or will he\n\nHave his prey sent him in an iron cage?\n\nBy Jove, he shall not have her! O! no, no;\n\n\"He sends his younger son, the Count Paolo,\n\nTo fetch Francesca back to Rimini.\"\n\nThat's well, if he had left his reasons out.\n\nAnd, in a postscript—by the saints, 'tis droll!—\n\n\"'Twould not be worth your lordship's while to shut\n\nPaolo in a prison; for, my lord,\n\nI'll only pay his ransom in plain steel:\n\nBesides, he's not worth having.\" Is there one,\n\nSave this ignoble offshoot of the Goths,\n\nWho'd write such garbage to a gentleman?\n\nTake that, and read it. [Gives letter to CARDINAL.\n\nCARDINAL. I have done the most.\n\nShe seems suspicious.\n\nGUIDO. Ritta's work.\n\nCARDINAL. Farewell!\n\nFRANCESCA. Father, you seem distempered.\n\nGUIDO. No, my child,\n\nI am but vexed. Your husband's on the road,\n\nClose to Ravenna. What's the time of day?\n\nFRANCESCA. Past noon, my lord.\n\nGUIDO. We must be stirring, then.\n\nFRANCESCA. I do not like this marriage.\n\nGUIDO. But I do.\n\nFRANCESCA. But I do not. Poh! to be given away,\n\nLike a fine horse or falcon, to a man\n\nWhose face I never saw!\n\nRITTA. That's it, my lady.\n\nGUIDO. Ritta, run down, and see if my great pot\n\nBoils to your liking.\n\nRITTA. [Aside.] O! that pot again!\n\nMy lord, my heart betrays me; but you know\n\nHow true 'tis to my lady. [Exit.\n\nFRANCESCA. What ails Ritta?\n\nGUIDO. The ailing of your sex, a running tongue.\n\nFrancesca, 'tis too late to beat retreat:\n\nOld Malatesta has me—you, too, child—\n\nSafe in his clutch. If you are not content,\n\nI must unclose Ravenna, and allow\n\nHis son to take you. Poh, poh! have a soul\n\nEqual with your estate. A prince's child\n\nCannot choose husbands. Her desires must aim,\n\nNot at herself, but at the public good.\n\nBoth as your prince and father, I command;\n\nAs subject and good daughter, you'll obey.\n\nFRANCESCA. I knew that it must be my destiny,\n\nSome day, to give my hand without my heart;\n\nBut—\n\nGUIDO. But, and I will but you back again!\n\nWhen Guido da Polenta says to you,\n\nDaughter, you must be married,—what were best?\n\nFRANCESCA. 'Twere best Francesca, of the self-same name,\n\nMade herself bridal garments. [Laughing.\n\nGUIDO. Right!\n\nFRANCESCA. My lord,\n\nIs Lanciotto handsome—ugly—fair—\n\nBlack—sallow—crabbed—kind—or what is he?\n\nGUIDO. You'll know ere long. I could not alter him,\n\nTo please your taste.\n\nFRANCESCA. You always put me off;\n\nYou never have a whisper in his praise.\n\nGUIDO. The world reports it.—Count my soldiers' scars,\n\nAnd you may sum Lanciotto's glories up.\n\nFRANCESCA. I shall be dutiful, to please you, father.\n\nIf aught befall me through my blind submission,\n\nThough I may suffer, you must bear the sin.\n\nBeware, my lord, for your own peace of mind!\n\nMy part has been obedience; and now\n\nI play it over to complete my task;\n\nAnd it shall be with smiles upon my lips,—\n\nHeaven only knows with what a sinking heart!\n\n[Exeunt.\n\nSCENE II.\n\nThe Same. Before the Gates of the City. The walls hung with banners, flowers, etc., and crowded with citizens. At the side of the scene is a canopied dais, with chairs of state upon it. Music, bells, shouts, and other sounds of rejoicing, are occasionally heard. Enter GUIDO, the CARDINAL, NOBLEMEN, KNIGHTS, GUARDS, etc., with banners, arms, etc.\n\nGUIDO. My lord, I'll have it so. You talk in vain.\n\nPaolo is a marvel in his way:\n\nI've seen him often. If Francesca take\n\nA fancy to his beauty, all the better;\n\nFor she may think that he and Lanciotto\n\nAre like as blossoms of one parent branch.\n\nIn truth, they are, so far as features go—\n\nHeaven help the rest! Get her to Rimini,\n\nBy any means, and I shall be content.\n\nThe fraud cannot last long; but long enough\n\nTo win her favour to the family.\n\nCARDINAL. Tis a dull trick. Thou hast not dealt with her\n\nWisely nor kindly, and I dread the end.\n\nIf, when this marriage was enjoined on thee,\n\nThou hadst informed Francesca of the truth,\n\nAnd said, Now daughter, choose between\n\nThy peace and all Ravenna's; who that knows\n\nThe constant nature of her noble heart\n\nCould doubt the issue? There'd have been some tears,\n\nSome frightful fancies of her husband's looks;\n\nAnd then she'd calmly walk up to her fate,\n\nAnd bear it bravely. Afterwards, perchance,\n\nLanciotto might prove better than her fears,—\n\nNo one denies him many an excellence,—\n\nAnd all go happily. But, as thou wouldst plot,\n\nShe'll be prepared to see a paragon,\n\nAnd find a satyr. It is dangerous.\n\nTreachery with enemies is bad enough,\n\nWith friends 'tis fatal.\n\nGUIDO. Has your lordship done?\n\nCARDINAL. Never, Count Guido, with so good a text.\n\nDo not stand looking sideways at the truth;\n\nCraft has become thy nature. Go to her.\n\nGUIDO. I have not heart.\n\nCARDINAL. I have. [Going.\n\nGUIDO. Hold, Cardinal!\n\nMy plan is better. Get her off my hands,\n\nAnd I care not.\n\nCARDINAL. What will she say of thee,\n\nIn Rimini, when she detects the cheat?\n\nGUIDO. I'll stop my ears up.\n\nCARDINAL. Guido, thou art weak,\n\nAnd lack the common fortitude of man.\n\nGUIDO. And you abuse the license of your garb,\n\nTo lesson me. My lord, I do not dare\n\nTo move a finger in these marriage-rites.\n\nFrancesca is a sacrifice, I know,—\n\nA limb delivered to the surgeon's knife,\n\nTo save our general health. A truce to this.\n\nPaolo has the business in his hands:\n\nLet him arrange it as he will; for I\n\nWill give Count Malatesta no pretext\n\nTo recommence the war.\n\nCARDINAL. Farewell, my lord.\n\nI'll neither help nor countenance a fraud.\n\nYou crafty men take comfort to yourselves,\n\nSaying, deceit dies with discovery.\n\n'Tis false; each wicked action spawns a brood,\n\nAnd lives in its succession. You, who shake\n\nMan's moral nature into storm, should know\n\nThat the last wave which passes from your sight\n\nRolls in and breaks upon eternity! [Exit.\n\nGUIDO. Why, that's a very grand and solemn thought:\n\nI'll mention it to Dante. Gentlemen,\n\nWhat see they from the wall?\n\nNOBLEMAN. The train, my lord.\n\nGUIDO. Inform my daughter.\n\nNOBLEMAN. She is here, my lord.\n\nEnter FRANCESCA, RITTA, LADIES, ATTENDANTS, etc.\n\nFRANCESCA. See, father, what a merry face I have,\n\nAnd how my ladies glisten! I will try\n\nTo do my utmost, in my love for you\n\nAnd the good people of Ravenna. Now,\n\nAs the first shock is over, I expect\n\nTo feel quite happy. I will wed the Count,\n\nBe he whate'er he may. I do not speak\n\nIn giddy recklessness. I've weighed it all,—\n\n'Twixt hope and fear, knowledge and ignorance,—\n\nAnd reasoned out my duty to your wish.\n\nI have no yearnings towards another love:\n\nSo, if I show my husband a desire\n\nTo fill the place with which he honours me,\n\nAccording to its duties, even he—\n\nWere he less noble than Count Lanciotto—\n\nMust smile upon my efforts, and reward\n\nGood will with willing grace. One pang remains.\n\nParting from home and kindred is a thing\n\nNone but the heartless, or the miserable,\n\nCan do without a tear. This home of mine\n\nHas filled my heart with two-fold happiness,\n\nTaking and giving love abundantly.\n\nFarewell, Ravenna! If I bless thee not,\n\nTis that thou seem'st too blessed; and 'twere strange\n\nIn me to offer what thou'st always given.\n\nGUIDO. [Aside.] This is too much! If she would rail a while\n\nAt me and fortune, it could be endured. [Shouts, music, etc., within.\n\nFRANCESCA. Ha! there's the van just breaking through the wood!\n\nMusic! that's well; a welcome forerunner.\n\nNow, Ritta—here—come talk to me. Alas!\n\nHow my heart trembles! What a world to me\n\nLies 'neath the glitter of yon cavalcade!\n\nIs that the Count?\n\nRITTA. Upon the dapple-gray?\n\nFRANCESCA. Yes, yes.\n\nRITTA. No; that's his—\n\nGUIDO. [Apart to her.] Ritta!\n\nRITTA. Ay; that's—that's—\n\nGUIDO. Ritta, the pot! [Apart to her.\n\nRITTA. O! but this lying chokes! [Aside.]\n\nAy, that's Count Somebody, from Rimini.\n\nFRANCESCA. I knew it was. Is that not glorious?\n\nRITTA. My lady, what?\n\nFRANCESCA. To see a cavalier\n\nSit on his steed with such familiar grace.\n\nRITTA. To see a man astraddle on a horse!\n\nIt don't seem much to me.\n\nFRANCESCA. Fie! stupid girl!\n\nBut mark the minstrels thronging round the Count!\n\nAh! that is more than gallant horsemanship.\n\nThe soul that feeds itself on poesy,\n\nIs of a quality more fine and rare\n\nThan Heaven allows the ruder multitude.\n\nI tell you, Ritta, when you see a man\n\nBeloved by poets, made the theme of song,\n\nAnd chaunted down to ages, as a gift\n\nFit for the rich embalmment of their verse,\n\nThere's more about him than the patron's gold.\n\nIf that's the gentleman my father chose,\n\nHe must have picked him out from all the world.\n\nThe Count alights. Why, what a noble grace\n\nRuns through his slightest action! Are you sad?\n\nYou, too, my father? Have I given you cause?\n\nI am content. If Lanciotto's mind\n\nBear any impress of his fair outside,\n\nWe shall not quarrel ere our marriage-day.\n\nCan I say more? My blushes speak for me:\n\nInterpret them as modesty's excuse\n\nFor the short-comings of a maiden's speech.\n\nRITTA. Alas! dear lady! [Aside.\n\nGUIDO. [Aside.] 'Sdeath! my plot has failed,\n\nBy overworking its design. Come, come;\n\nGet to your places. See, the Count draws nigh.\n\nGUIDO and FRANCESCA seat themselves upon the dais, surrounded by RITTA, LADIES, ATTENDANTS, GUARDS, etc. Music, shouts, ringing of bells, etc. Enter MEN-AT-ARMS, with banners, etc.; PAGES bearing costly presents on cushions; then PAOLO, surrounded by NOBLEMEN, KNIGHTS, MINSTRELS, etc., and followed by other MEN-AT-ARMS. They range themselves opposite the dais.\n\nGUIDO. Ravenna welcomes you, my lord, and I\n\nAdd my best greeting to the general voice.\n\nThis peaceful show of arms from Rimini\n\nIs a new pleasure, stranger to our sense\n\nThan if the East blew zephyrs, or the balm\n\nOf Summer loaded rough December's gales,\n\nAnd turned his snows to roses.\n\nPAOLO. Noble sir,\n\nWe looked for welcome from your courtesy,\n\nNot from your love; but this unhoped for sight\n\nOf smiling faces, and the gentle tone\n\nIn which you greet us, leave us naught to win\n\nWithin your hearts. I need not ask, my lord,\n\nWhere bides the precious object of my search;\n\nFor I was sent to find the fairest maid\n\nRavenna boasts, among her many fair.\n\nI might extend my travel many a league,\n\nAnd yet return, to take her from your side.\n\nI blush to bear so rich a treasure home,\n\nAs pledge and hostage of a sluggish peace;\n\nFor beauty such as hers was meant by Heaven\n\nTo spur our race to gallant enterprise,\n\nAnd draw contending deities around\n\nThe dubious battles of a second Troy.\n\nGUIDO. Sir Count, you please to lavish on my child\n\nThe high-strained courtesy of chivalry;\n\nYet she has homely virtues that, I hope,\n\nMay take a deeper hold in Rimini,\n\nAfter the fleeting beauty of her face\n\nIs spoiled by time, or faded to the eye\n\nBy its familiar usage.\n\nPAOLO. As a man\n\nWho ever sees Heaven's purpose in its works,\n\nI must suppose so rare a tabernacle\n\nWas framed for rarest virtues. Pardon me\n\nMy public admiration. If my praise\n\nClash with propriety, and bare my words\n\nTo cooler judgment, 'tis not that I wish\n\nTo win a flatterer's grudged recompense,\n\nAnd gain by falsehood what I'd win through love.\n\nWhen I have brushed my travel from my garb,\n\nI'll pay my court in more befitting style.\n\nMusic. Exit with his train.\n\nGUIDO. [Advancing.] Now, by the saints, Lanciotto's deputy\n\nStands in this business with a proper grace,\n\nStretching his lord's instructions till they crack.\n\nA zealous envoy! Not a word said he\n\nOf Lanciotto—not a single word:\n\nBut stood there, staring in Francesca's face\n\nWith his devouring eyes.—By Jupiter,\n\nI but half like it!\n\nFRANCESCA. [Advancing.] Father?\n\nGUIDO. Well, my child.\n\nFRANCESCA. How do you like—\n\nGUIDO. The coxcomb! I've done well!\n\nFRANCESCA. No, no; Count Lanciotto?\n\nGUIDO. Well enough.\n\nBut hang this fellow—hang your deputies!\n\nI'll never woo by proxy.\n\nFRANCESCA. Deputies!\n\nAnd woo by proxy!\n\nGUIDO. Come to me anon.\n\nI'll strip this cuckoo of his gallantry!\n\n[Exit with GUARDS, etc.\n\nFRANCESCA. Ritta, my father has strange ways of late.\n\nRITTA. I wonder not.\n\nFRANCESCA. You wonder not?\n\nRITTA. No, lady:\n\nHe is so used to playing double games,\n\nThat even you must come in for your share.\n\nPlague on his boiling! I will out with it. [Aside.]\n\nLady, the gentleman who passed the gates—\n\nFRANCESCA. Count Lanciotto? As I hope for grace,\n\nA gallant gentleman! How well he spoke!\n\nWith what sincere and earnest courtesy\n\nThe rounded phrases glided from his lips!\n\nHe spoke in compliments that seemed like truth.\n\nMethinks I'd listen through a summer's day,\n\nTo hear him woo.—And he must woo to me—\n\nI'll have our privilege—he must woo a space,\n\nEre I'll be won, I promise.\n\nRITTA. But, my lady,\n\nHe'll woo you for another.\n\nFRANCESCA. He?—ha! ha! [Laughing.]\n\nI should not think it from the prologue, Ritta.\n\nRITTA. Nor I.\n\nFRANCESCA. Nor any one.\n\nRITTA. 'Tis not the Count—\n\n'Tis not Count Lanciotto.\n\nFRANCESCA. Gracious saints!\n\nHave you gone crazy? Ritta, speak again,\n\nBefore I chide you.\n\nRITTA. 'Tis the solemn truth.\n\nThat gentleman is Count Paolo, lady,\n\nBrother to Lanciotto, and no more\n\nLike him than—than—\n\nFRANCESCA. Than what?\n\nRITTA. Count Guido's pot,\n\nFor boiling waiting-maids, is like the bath\n\nOf Venus on the arras.\n\nFRANCESCA. Are you mad,—\n\nQuite mad, poor Ritta?\n\nRITTA. Yes; perhaps I am.\n\nPerhaps Lanciotto is a proper man—\n\nPerhaps I lie—perhaps I speak the truth—\n\nPerhaps I gabble like a fool. O! heavens,\n\nThat dreadful pot!\n\nFRANCESCA. Dear Ritta!—\n\nRITTA. By the mass,\n\nThey shall not cozen you, my gentle mistress!\n\nIf my lord Guido boiled m"
