        "text": "Virginia Woolf: Biography\n\nVirginia Woolf, born Adeline Virginia Stephen, is considered one of the most important modernist authors of the 20th-century. Today Woolf is well-known for pioneering the stream of consciousness approach, but in her own time, her narrative approach was unconventional. She embraced nonlinear timelines and a holistic perspective that varied drastically from the Victorian literary norms of the time.\n\nIn addition to her fiction, Woolf wrote essays on the politics of power, women's experience, social change, and artistic theory. She was a member of the artistic and intellectual Bloomsbury Group and founded Hogarth Press with her husband. Woolf wrote nine books in her lifetime, as well as essays, a biography, short fiction pieces, a drama, diaries, journals, and letters.\n\nWoolf was born to an affluent English family in 1882. Her mother, Julia Stephen, was famous for being a model for Pre-Raphaelite painters, and her aunt, Julia Margaret Cameron, was one of the most important British portraitists of the 19th century. Julia Stephen later wrote a book, Notes from Sick Rooms, detailing her experience as a nurse, and a collection of children's stories, which she read to her children. Woolf's father Leslie Stephen was an English author, biographer, critic, historian, and mountaineer.\n\nBoth Woolf's mother and father had been married and widowed before, so Woolf had four half-siblings. After they married for the second time, Woolf's parents had four children: Vanessa, Thoby, Virginia, and Adrian. Woolf and her seven siblings all lived together under one roof, but the Stephen children were closer to one another than to their older half-siblings.\n\nAlthough Vanessa acted as a mother figure to Virginia, the two were artistic rivals, Vanessa being a painter and Virginia a writer. In 1891, Vanessa and Thoby started the Hyde Park Gate News, a newspaper detailing the life of the Stephens family, but young Virginia soon became the main contributor and ran the paper until 1895 when their mother died.\n\nThe Stephen children enjoyed a mostly happy, upper-middle-class childhood, migrating every year from their London home at 22 Hyde Park Gate to their summer home at Talland House in Cornwall. The children loved their time at Cornwall, as it signified freedom and adventure to them. Woolf and her siblings were educated by her parents in their London home, where they had open access to their father's private library.\n\nWoolf spent much of her free time reading the books in her father's collection. Both of Woolf's parents were traditional in the sense that they condemned formal education for women. However, writing was considered a respectable profession for women, and her father was a writer himself, so he encouraged Woolf's abilities.\n\nAlthough Virginia and Vanessa were not allowed to continue their education, the Stephen boys went to Cambridge. Thoby introduced his literary and artistic college friends to his sisters, eventually leading to the formation of the Bloomsbury Group.\n\nThe easy-going nature of Woolf's life abruptly changed after her mother's death in 1895. Woolf was only 13, but losing her mother caused her to sink into a state of depression, triggering a nervous breakdown. Her mental state only worsened when her half-sister and her father died within 7 years of her mother.\n\nIn 1904, Woolf attempted suicide for the first time by jumping out of a window. She survived, Vanessa moved the family out of their childhood home to the Bloomsbury section of London, and Woolf found a way to cope with her depression through writing.\n\nAt Bloomsbury, the Stephen siblings hosted weekly gatherings of radical young thinkers. Following Thoby's death and Vanessa's engagement to English art critic Clive Bell, the group was transformed into the Bloomsbury Group, where artists and literary thinkers alike met to discuss their works and ideas.\n\nThe intellectuals and creatives at the Bloomsbury Group challenged Woolf to publicly express herself through her writing. In 1908, Woolf began writing anonymous reviews for the Times Literary Supplement and started her first novel, which she called Melymbrosia. When Leonard Woolf, whom Woolf had met at a dinner in 1904, returned from the colonial service that had sent him out East, he proposed to Woolf and the two married in 1912.\n\nIn 1913, Woolf completely revised Melymbrosia, changing the title to The Voyage Out. The publication of The Voyage Out was delayed until 1915, after Woolf attempted suicide in September 1913. Following her recovery, Woolf was able to keep her depression mostly at bay for years.\n\nIn 1917, Woolf and her husband founded the Hogarth Press, a printing press that they themselves used frequently to publish their own works. Woolf went on the publish Night and Day (1919), Jacob's Room (1922), Mrs. Dalloway (1925), To the Lighthouse (1927), Orlando: A Biography (1928), The Waves (1931), and The Years (1937). Her final novel, Between the Acts, was published posthumously in 1941. She also wrote nonfiction essays on the oppression of women in her society, literary history, social justice, and other topics.\n\nIn 1922, Woolf was courted by the aristocratic Vita Sackville-West, and although both were married to men, they began a sexual relationship that peaked between 1925 and 1928. Sackville-West was also a writer and used Hogarth Press to publish her works, which saved the Woolfs' business from bankruptcy.\n\nDuring their lifetimes, Sackville-West was considered the more famous writer, although now Woolf is more renowned. Woolf based one of her greatest works, Orlando, off of Sackville-West. Sackville-West's son called it, \"the most charming love letter in literature,\" saying,\n\nThe effect of Vita on Virginia is all contained in Orlando, the longest and most charming love letter in literature, in which she explores Vita, weaves her in and out of the centuries, tosses her from one sex to the other, plays with her, dresses her in furs, lace and emeralds, teases her, flirts with her, drops a veil of mist around her.\"¹\n\nTheir romantic relationship fizzled out in the 1930s, but the two remained friends until Woolf's death in 1941.\n\nAt a time when homosexual relationships were typically viewed as taboo, Woolf and Sackville-West didn't hide their relationship and even with the lesbian connotations, Woolf's Orlando and A Room of One's Own sold very well. What do you make of this? What effect, if any, do you think being surrounded by radical thinkers in the Bloomsbury Group had on Woolf's relationships?\n\nVirginia Woolf: Death\n\nWoolf had struggled with depression since the death of her mother in May of 1895. Just as she was coming out of the depressive episode caused by her mother's death, the successive losses of her half-sister Stella Duckworth in 1897 and her father in 1904 precipitated a nervous breakdown.\n\nWoolf attempted suicide for the first time when she was 22 by jumping out of a window, but fortunately the window wasn't high enough off the ground to do any serious damage. Her sister, Vanessa, took over motherly roles of caring for Woolf and moved the family to London in the bohemian Bloomsbury section.\n\nDepression and what is now thought to be a bipolar disorder plagued Woolf for the majority of her life. From 1910 to 1913 she was hospitalized several times for minor suicide attempts, having to stay intermittently at Burley House, a private institution for women with nervous disorders, on \"rest cure therapy.\"\n\nIn September of 1913, Woolf's manic-depressive thoughts that she was unloved by her siblings and husband, as well as a failure, caused her to attempt suicide once more, this time very seriously. She took 100g of barbital, a sedative used for central nervous system depression. She would have died if her stomach hadn't been pumped. It took until August of 1914 for Woolf to be considered fully recovered. She spent much of her life looking for a cure for her mental health issues, and finally started to feel better in the summer of 1914.\n\nIn 1940, her mental health deteriorated once again due to several factors. For one, World War II was a constant stress on Woolf's mental state. She struggled to write when writing seemed to insignificant due to the war. As writing was the chief factor in staving off Woolf's depressive episodes, not being able to write due to feeling its futility in the face of WWII was disastrous to her mental health and made her feel like a failure.\n\nWoolf's family's London homes were destroyed during the Blitz that year. Her biography of Roger Fry didn't receive the praise she had anticipated and finishing Between the Acts left her exhausted and weak. On March 28, 1941, Woolf decided to end her life. She filled her pockets with rocks and walked into the River Ouse near her home. Her body was not found until April 18. Her final novel, Between the Acts, was published posthumously later that year.\n\nHow does Woolf's treatment of mental health differ from other authors who wrote about similar topics?\n\nVirginia Woolf Quotes\n\nI would venture to guess that Anon, who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often a woman.”\n\n― Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own\n\nA Room of One's Own is often viewed as Woolf's feminist critique of female oppression in a patriarchal society by keeping women trapped in subordinate roles. This quote reflects that sentiment well, arguing that women have never gotten the recognition or respect they deserve in their writing. Although Woolf was given an education (albeit informal) and her writing was encouraged, the same could not be said for all women in the early to mid-20th century.\n\nWoolf had an advantage because her father was a writer and actively encouraged her writing. However, other women throughout history were deterred from writing, and even when they did write, they would not publish the work under their own name for fear of not being taken seriously. Women had far fewer opportunities than men, and their work was generally not as well-respected.\n\nMany women either published under a male pseudonym (e.g., Charlotte Brontë under the name Curer Bell) or published anonymously. Woolf herself had some experience with anonymity, as all of her reviews for the Times Literary Supplement had to be anonymous, a tradition that held until 1974. In this quote, Woolf essentially argues that women contribute much more to society and literature than they are given credit for.\n\nLock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind.”\n\n― Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own\n\nAgain, Woolf equates education with freedom. With her vibrant literary education at home, her parents taught her to read and write and gave her access to a plethora of books. Woolf used those skills to get through life: she turned to reading to combat her depression, owned a successful printing business with her husband, published novels and essays, and met with other literary geniuses.\n\nHer childhood education allowed Woolf to do all these things as a woman. Instead of being a housewife and a mother, Woolf had the education she needed to thrive in spheres that women were traditionally kept from. Her education gave her the freedom to break free of societal constructs that she found limiting.\n\nIn many ways, this sense of freedom links to the principles of modern feminism, in that women have the same capacity and potential for success as men but have been systematically held back from being able to achieve it.\n\nVirginia Woolf - Key takeaways\n\nVirginia Woolf was born in 1882 to an upper-middle-class English family.\n\nHer siblings were deeply influential to her: sister Vanessa was an artist who challenged Virginia creatively; her brother Thoby introduced her to his college friends and founded the Bloomsbury Group; Adrian lived with Virginia after Thoby died; and Vanessa got engaged.\n\nVirginia Woolf's most famous works include Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, and Orlando.\n\nWoolf married Leonard Woolf and the two founded Hogarth Press together.\n\nWoolf struggled with depression all her life and eventually killed herself in 1941, after putting rocks in her pockets and walking into the river Ouse."
