        "text": "In this episode, I share some very cool techniques for you to Get into that Elusive Creativity Zone consistently, and if you are in the Creativity Zone consistently, your creative output is going to soar! Check this out and change your life!\n\nBio:\n\nPlaywright/ Screenwriter, Director and Producer Sarah T. Schwab\n\nInitially developed for the stage, the film Sarah wrote and produced “A Stage of Twilight” stars Karen Allen and William Sadler. This film is a love story set in the final chapter of Cora and Barry's lives. The film premiered in a limited theater run this March and is now available to stream on demand on Amazon, Vudu, Vubiquity/Verizon Fios, Hoopla, Charter/Spectrum, Comcast/Xfinity, and Cox.\n\nSarah is an active member of the Playwright/Directors unit at the Actors Studio in New York City and has previously won Best Director in an English Language Feature Film at the Madrid International Film Festival in 2020 for her first feature film, “Life After You.” Sarah was also honored in 2022 with the Best Emerging Director award at the Woods Hole Film Festival for \"A Stage of Twilight.” In 2023, “A Stage of Twilight” won the Filmmaker Award at the Sonoma International Film Festival.\n\nIn this awesome episode, I interview Playwright, Director and Producer, Freedom Farlow Cooke! She talks about her writing workflow, her new play which is being produced in Philadelphia in June, and both Freedom and I, invite you to direct some of your own work for it will change your life. Check out this episode. Freedom is a fantastic creator and she has a lot of wonderful insights to share!\n\nMore about Freedom:\n\nBio\n\nPlaywright - Freedom Farlow Cooke\n\nI have written several plays (a number of which have been produced) that relate to social issues within the African American community. I have also received a grant for my short film entitled “AMELIKA.”\n\nI write because it allows me to tell stories that are not only relatable, but encourage others to explore their own perspectives of thought.\n\nPlaywriting is a gift that allows the audience to view stories through the lens and imagination of others, a wonderful journey into unique life experiences told through beautiful and compelling stories. While some stories have been told, many have yet to be explored - so anytime I can be a conduit to bridge the gap, I am willing to write!\n\nIn this very cool episode of The Playwriting Podcast, I talk about how to make BIG and congruent choices in your work, so that you are not a mediocre playwright! Wow! Tough love! But heck, wimpy choices create wimpy plays, and yes, you have to risk being over the top, in order to land on the precipice called BIG and PERFECT. Do you have the Beach Balls to make some big choices and take a risk? You only live once, so what are you waiting for?\n\nAnd in this process of talking BIG Choices…\n\nI talk about WITCHLAND which Manhattan Rep is producing and bringing to stunning life.\n\nWhat better than a play about and EVIL WITCH in a town maybe poisioned by Nuclear waste?\n\nSound like the perfect play to make some big choices!\n\nCheck this out!\n\nListen online at the button below.\n\nAnd get your tickets to Witchland at the link below opening April 5th in NYC!\n\nhttps://witchlandplay.com/get-tickets/\n\nIn this exciting episode, I talk about editing, and I offer my 10 Editing Questions again as a means of editing your work as you write and editing your first draft, second draft and more. Editing is often tedious but it is one of the most important things you can do to refine your play. And with my 10 Editing Questions (Below) - Wow! Editing your play will be more effective and faster than you have ever experienced before!\n\nMy 10 Editing Questions:\n\nThese questions are like filters to refine your play and make it more concise.\n\nAnd concise is good.\n\n1. Is there a clear problem & action related to the problem that needs to be solved in each scene? If not, fix it.\n\n2. Does this scene top the scene before? If not, fix it.\n\n3. Are your characters saying too many words? Do they need to say three sentences when they could say the same thing in one sentence?\n\n4. Do your characters speak in clear and distinctly different ways? If not, how can you make them consistently different?\n\n5. Are your characters telling stories that don’t have a dramatic event attached to the telling of the story? If not, cut them or make them two sentences tops. I’m serious. (A story with a dramatic event attached could be a Coming Out story, or a Break Up story.)\n\n6. Are the characters saying too little? Is it clear what is happening in each EVENT?\n\n7. Are you telling BACK STORY to the audience that is not intrinsically told during a dramatic action moment in the scene? If not, fix it!\n\n8. Is the scene too long? Could it be a page or two shorter and still convey all the important information and ACTION that will propel this play to its dramatic conclusion?\n\n9. Is the scene too short? Are the actions and events in this scene big enough?\n\n10. Do you need this scene? Does this scene top the scene before, and propel the dramatic action of the play? If you answer yes to this - keep the scene. If no, cut it!\n\nIn this episode, I talk about how you can take IDEAS from plays, film and TV and make those ideas your own and put them into your plays. This is not plagiarism, for you are not taking lines, just concepts and adapting them for your own amazing uses. I talk about FROM SCRATCH on Netflix that steals from Chekhov in an incredible and amazing way, but if you don’t know The Three Sisters as well as I know it, you would never see it. (BTW, FROM SCRATCH is one of the best TV series I have ever seen. It is brilliant and so beautifully constructed, and acted. Bravo!). And then I talk about all the ways you can take these concepts and ideas to improve your playwriting. This one is fun!\n\nIn this episode, I talk about the opportunities for playwrights in this very Brave New Normal. The Theatre world has been disrupted by the pandemic, making now the perfect time to connect with theatres and producers and Theatre ANGELS, to get your play produced.\n\nI talk about Powerhouse by David Harms which we are producing OFF-BROADWAY in October and I talk about the wild process of reaching out to Agents to find Name Talent for the lead, and how that process too has changed because of this pandemic. Then I tell a quick Zen story, and invite you to use this time to get your plays produced! This nutty new time is filled with opportunity if you look at this world as it is and not as you think it was. Don’t miss this one. Super Fun!\n\nMy old pal, Professor Albert is back and he has hijacked the podcast again to talk to playwrights all over the world about creating specific characters, and to demonstrate his intense acting abilities in the process.\n\nAren’t you tired of Ken Wolf on this podcast telling you that you need to do this and you need to do that to propel your playwriting career to the next level? Now you can listen to Motivational Music Superstar Professor Albert as he tells you that you need to do this, and you need to do that to propel your playwriting career to the next level. And then for the first time on this podcast, Professor Albert shares a hypnosis meditation so that you can write better characters and also, become one with the universe! Don’t miss this exciting episode!\n\nIn this episode, I rail about how often writers will play with new ways to TELL a story at the expense of creating a clear context, so that the people watching will actually UNDERSTAND what is going on! I see it in movies, TV and alas, in plays.\n\nThen I talk about the importance of creating a clear context and how it will ultimately be the foundation on which to build your play. And as usual, I tell a cool story to illustrate all.\n\nThen, I talk about Powerhouse by David Harms, the Off-Broadway show we are producing opening next October in Midtown Manhattan. I talk about working on the script and how my intention is to create a perfect rehearsal draft for this play.\n\nAnd lastly, I offer up really good reasons why you need to take one of my Master Academy Zoom Courses: The Playwright’s Reading, or Rewriting Your Play, and I share the wonders of a great playwright website and how we will build it for you.\n\nAll this in under 18 minutes. What fun!\n\nIn this episode, I talk about FEAR, our old Pal who often comes a callin’ when we are moving forward in our lives and doing new things.\n\nI take you through a process to challenge your FEAR and find a better emotional answer, so you can move forward in your playwriting career with new clarity and passion, and BE MORE.\n\nBecoming a working playwright is not just about writing a great play. You need to become FEARLESS and relentless and connect to theatres, producers, agents and more.\n\nAnd to do that, often, you have to change how you think.\n\nWow, a podcast about playwriting that is not about playwriting…\n\n…and it is.\n\nCheck this out. Do the work. Change your thinking and get your work out into the world!\n\nIn this episode, I talk about Amsterdam’s Orange Theatre Company’s Short Zoom Theatre Film - FEVER DREAMS, which was one of the most exciting and creative Zoom presentations that I have ever seen! (It is a part of Manhattan Rep’s Stories Film Festival in May. Don’t miss it!)\n\nIn this amazing Zoom Film there was a Big Problem, Big Events happening in the story (AND ON THE COMPUTER!) It was so well rehearsed and filled with INSANE PASSION!!\n\nI outline these FOUR STEPS to take your PLAY to the next level. How can you go further with your work? And get your work out into the world as we move into this NEW RENAISSANCE OF THEATRE! Don’t miss this!\n\nIn the episode, I ask the BIG QUESTION: Do you want to join the REVOLUTION?\n\nDo you want to be part of tomorrow’s theatre, a vibrant and passionate community of artists writing plays that make a difference? Do you want to be a part of this NEW AGE of live storytelling? Are you willing to do the work to write like you have never written before to help transform this BRAVE NEW WORLD?\n\nAs storytellers, we have more power to create a shift in consciousness than all the politicians in the world. Playwrights are magicians and miracle makers. (Yes, you are!) So are you ready to create some miracles with your work? Are you willing to be bigger, bolder, more passionate and work harder than ever before to create some transformational plays for this New Age? How can you with your storytelling skills be a part of the solution as we return to live theatre?\n\nAh yes, that is the question!\n\nIn this episode, I interview Broadway Producer, Ken Davenport, about the road back for Broadway and for theatre opening around the world. This interview is inspiring and sheds some glorious light at the end of a very long and dark tunnel. Ken talks about what is happening now, and what the process moving forward might look like as theatre reopens!

And I talk about this website How To Write Plays.com.\n\nHere are the 10 Editing Questions to refine your first draft:\n\n1. Is there a clear problem & action related to the problem that needs to be solved in each scene? If not, fix it.\n\n2. Does this scene top the scene before? If not, fix it.\n\n3. Are your characters saying too many words? Do they need to say three sentences when they could say the same thing in one sentence?\n\n4.
