In contrast to the early novels and autobiographies, however, Asian American drama made its debut with the spotlight firmly on the lives and struggles of Asians in North America. In what might be considered the earliest Asian American dramatic works in the United States—Confucius, Buddha, and Christ—which Sadakichi Hartmann wrote between 1889 and 1897, the playwright attempted to transform the American theater of the late Victorian period by employing a fusion of poetry, music, and mystic elements. Ling-ai (Gladys) Li, the first Asian American woman playwright on record, focused on the conflict between two sets of equally compelling values from the cultures of America and China in The Submission of Rose Moy (1924). Coincidentally, or perhaps not so coincidentally, their works together started a tradition still evident today in Asian American dramatic literature, namely, challenging the limitations of established theater conventions and directing popular attention to issues and experiences that might otherwise be ignored or marginalized. But the continental U.S. theater was not ready for Asian American plays when they first appeared. Although Li wrote and reportedly produced her first play without incident in Hawaii, Hartmann’s scripts never saw production. Instead, he saw the inside of Charles Street Jail in Boston because his Christ was deemed “vicious and salacious according to American ideas,” and all its copies were confiscated.1 He was fined $100 for violating the community’s sensibilities. Yet Asian American drama as a literary canon has been composed and produced for domestic consumption. From the commercially successful productions, such as M. Butterfly by David Henry Hwang and Tea by Velina Hasu Houston, to staged readings of scripts unheard of outside the field, the wide-ranging themes like\n\nx\n\nPREFACE\n\nidentity struggles, cultural adjustment, immigration stigma, racism within, and the joys and hardships of diasporan experience as well as the possibilities and limits of multiethnicity continue to be appreciated by the multicultural audience more than by a homogeneous crowd. The diverse voices that Asian American plays present not only have enriched the American stage, but also have delineated the struggles of all Americans in an ever-changing racial landscape. However, an overview of ethnic drama yields an unfortunate fact. While Asian American literature has come into full efflorescence in the past two and a half decades, Asian American drama has yet to receive the kind of critical attention it warrants. Its production is discussed primarily in the theater reviews of newspapers; its writers are known only to the scholars, producers, and acting professionals of ethnic and academic theaters; and most of its scripts remain unpublished despite the warm reception of their productions. This reference book is intended to serve as a versatile vehicle for exploring the field of Asian American drama from its recorded conception to its present stage. The selection of playwrights and performance artists for this volume is based on a combination of recommendations from theater scholars, the existing record of publication or production, and a playwright’s ethnicity. While the first two criteria are more or less self-evident, the ethnicity test deserves explanation. The intent of this book is to reflect the demographics of the diverse Asian American communities in North America, but in an era when ethnicity is becoming increasingly a matter of personal choice rather than heritage, neither geography nor nationality helps define what constitutes “Asian American.” Playwrights of the Pacific islands would be excluded if the term were defined geographically; the latest talents of Asian immigrants would be ignored if the term were delimited by citizenship; and it would go against everything this undertaking stands for if the term were prescribed by a playwright’s percentage of “Asian blood.” This dilemma exposes the very fallacious nature of defining artists, and humanity, by race. While the best-defined racial labels must be mutually exclusive in theory, they will be the least accurate in reality. Yet an all-inclusive category is not feasible because of space constraints. With the recognition of “Asian American” as a bureaucratic and editorial convenience rather than a precise racial category, this volume has thus included fifty-two established and emerging American playwrights and performing artists of origins from India, Pakistan, Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, Korea, and China in order to articulate a presence that has been traditionally appropriated for the tourist gaze in the collective mind of North American audiences. As a reference tool, this book is designed to provide a comprehensive but practical resource to educators and scholars engaged in teaching and researching Asian American drama and to students and theater practitioners interested in reading and producing new plays. The fifty-two entries—one for each playwright—are arranged alphabetically. Each entry consists of four sections: Biography, Major Works and Themes, Critical Reception, and Bibliography. At the end of the book, a general Selected Bibliography compiles, separately, both the primary and secondary sources for further reading.\n\nPREFACE\n\nxi\n\nThe Biography within each entry is a succinct narrative that places the accomplishments of a playwright in a cultural context. Major Works and Themes is an interpretive description of plays that highlights recurring themes and plots. Critical Reception is an overview that provides the most up-to-date critical assessment of the playwright under discussion. Bibliography is a compilation that lists both the published and unpublished works of the playwright, their selected production history, and sources of critical studies. Although each entry makes no claims to being definitive, it does strive to be comprehensive enough for advanced scholars and general readers alike in their inquiry into each playwright. The selected production history of an entry serves a dual purpose. On the one hand, it gives credit to the crucial role of theaters to playwrights like that of publishers to authors; on the other, it documents the vitality and struggles of Asian American plays. The successful development of Asian American drama would not have been possible without the establishment of Asian American theaters across the nation. The East West Players in Los Angeles (1965), the Kumu Kahua Theatre in Hawaii (1971), the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco (1973), the Northwest Asian American Theatre in Seattle (1976), the Pan Asian Repertory Theatre in New York (1977), the New WORLD Theater in Amherst (1979), and Theater Mu in Minneapolis (1992), to name just a few, have all helped create a permanent space on the American stage for Asian America. Although many of them were founded primarily as alternatives to mainstream-dominated venues for Asian American acting professionals, the circuitous trail they blazed has not only galvanized Asian American playwriting to emerge, but has also provided the continuity of that asserted presence in flesh and blood. The postcolonial gaze of Asians is being transformed into an appreciative eye for their cultures and hopefully an eventual embrace of their humanity. While the selected production history credits and honors these theaters and professionals, it is not meant to be complete or comprehensive, but illustrative of the vivacity of Asian American drama in its efforts to reach a larger audience. On behalf of all the contributors, I wish to acknowledge the playwrights and performance artists for their patient cooperation. My gratitude also goes to all the contributors. Their dedication to Asian American dramatic literature, commitment to original research, and attention to detail have made this reference volume a reality. Appreciation is due as well to Professor Emmanuel Nelson of the State University of New York at Cortland and Dr. George Butler of Greenwood Press for their trust and support throughout the project. In its completion, I must pay special tribute to Roberta Uno, Josephine Lee, and Jie Tian for their field-tested expertise, professional guidance, and generous assistance. NOTES 1.

She is of Japanese, Chinese, Spanish, and Scots descent. Aoki studied dance and majored in community studies at the University of California at Santa Cruz, graduating with a B.A. (with honors) in 1976. An Asian American actress, singer, and musician, Aoki grew tired of the stereotypical roles available to her; during the 1970s and 1980s, she became a founding member of the Asian American Dance Collective and the Asian American Theater Company. She then studied commedia with the Dell’Arte Players as well as Noh and Kyogen (Japanese classical theater) with Yuriko Doi’s Theatre of Yugen and later traveled to Japan to work with Noh master Nomuro Shiro and Kyogen master Nomura Mansaku at Chusonji Temple. Aoki also cofounded SoundSeen, an “extraordinary, if short lived, zen-jazz-performance ensemble” (Hurwitt, “Brenda” 266). Since 1988, Aoki has concentrated primarily on solo performance. She and her partner, composer/musician Mark Izu, are the artistic directors of First Voice, a San Francisco–based nonprofit arts organization dedicated to the “music and stories of people caught between cultures, speaking in their own voice” (“About Us”). Currently, Aoki is a member of the Theater-arts faculty at the University of California at Santa Cruz.\n\nMAJOR WORKS AND THEMES Eclecticism, individuality, and diversity are the hallmarks of Aoki’s work. Her plays are inspired by Japanese folktales and her own autobiography and delve into the themes of secrets, betrayal, danger, passion, love, forgiveness,\n\n2\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nand family. In regard to theatrical form, Aoki’s work “is a distinctive melding of dance, music and theatre from both Western and Japanese dramatic traditions” (Perkins and Uno 14). Obake! Some Japanese Ghosts (or Obake! Tales of Spirits Past and Present) (1988) is a unique synthesis of Asian, Asian American, and autobiographical storytelling. Aoki presents five distinct vignettes here: “Black Hair,” the story of what happens when a samurai deserts his devoted wife; “Dancing in California,” adapted from Hisaye Yamamoto’s short story “Miss Sasagawara,” which tells of a Japanese American ballerina’s struggle to maintain her sanity while interned during World War II; “Havoc in Heaven,” a retelling of the Monkey King’s epic battle; “The Bell of Dojoji” (an adaptation of Noh and Kabuki plays), in which a woman’s passion transforms her into a snake; and “Grandpa,” based on Aoki’s recollections of her Chinese immigrant grandfather. The Queen’s Garden (1992) is an autobiographical work that describes Aoki’s adolescence on the fringes of Asian and Pacific Islander gang life in Long Beach. It explores her romance with gangster Kali, her inability to escape her past, despite graduating from college and moving north, and her desperate but futile attempts to save Kali from his destiny. Kali’s entanglements in drugs and crime foretell a tragic firestorm at the play’s end. Random Acts of Kindness (1992) continues Aoki’s autobiographical musings. It is a story of a single woman solo performer, “consumed with worries about aging and her own ethnopolitical relevance . . . beset by Christian fundamentalist protesters who suspect that her Japanese children’s songs might be satanic incantations” (Hurwitt, “Brenda” 266). Mermaid Meat (1997) is a fantastic and sensuous tale of love, betrayal, and forgiveness that melds Aoki’s unique brand of storytelling with live symphonic accompaniment. Drawing upon the Japanese folkloric belief that one can gain eternal life by eating mermaid meat, Aoki embellishes the story, creating what she calls “nouveau myth”: an old fisherman reels in a mermaid from the sea, and they fall in love (Telephone interview). They live happily together with the fisherman’s daughter for many years, until the day the daughter notices herself aging. In a moment of insanity, she cuts a slab of flesh from the back of the mermaid and devours it; meanwhile, a giant turtle comes forth to rescue the wounded mermaid and return her to the sea. The final scene depicts the daughter’s great remorse and the mermaid’s forgiveness, a powerful vision of transformation and love. Aoki returns again to autobiography in Uncle Gunjiro’s Girlfriend (1998). This one-woman show explores Aoki’s discovery of and reactions to her family’s secret: the 1909 interracial marriage of her granduncle, Gunjiro Aoki, to Gladys Emery, daughter of the archdeacon of San Francisco’s Grace Cathedral. Fleeing angry mobs and the anti-miscegenation laws hastily passed to prevent their union, Gunjiro and Gladys settle in Seattle. The piece documents their family’s persecution through World War II, when the widowed Gladys and her children hide in the Sierra to avoid internment. Thematically, Uncle Gunjiro’s\n\nBRENDA WONG AOKI\n\n3\n\nGirlfriend, like much of Aoki’s work, explores how family secrets and shame haunt generations of a family, and how the act of uncovering and reclaiming family history offers healing as well as a means to honor and celebrate one’s past. Aoki is currently writing a novel based on this play. CRITICAL RECEPTION Recently anthologized, Aoki’s work has received considerable acclaim. In 1992, The Queen’s Garden garnered four Dramalogue awards for Best Performance, Best Writing, Best Original Music, and Best Lighting as well as a San Diego Critics Circle Award; likewise, both of Aoki’s two spoken-word CDs, Dreams and Illusions: Tales of the Pacific Rim (1990) and The Queen’s Garden (1999), have received the National Association of Independent Record Distributors (NAIRD) Indie Award for “Best Spoken Word Album of the Year.” Mermaid Meat received an American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) special award in 1998. Nancy Churnin describes Aoki’s storytelling talents in The Queen’s Garden as “formidable” and “extraordinary” (“Memories” F1), and Cheryl North proclaims Mermaid Meat to be “impressive” (1). However, Robert Hurwitt notes that the ambitious scope of Uncle Gunjiro’s Girlfriend undermines its effectiveness: “Too many characters, too many themes and too many performance styles compete for our attention” (“Tale” D1). By virtue of her mixed heritage and through the content and the formal aspects of her solo work, Aoki has been heralded as the literal embodiment of multicultural American theater. An iconoclastic, daring American playwright whose work continues to astound, Brenda Wong Aoki consistently redefines the concept of Asian American cultural fusion.

She graduated with a B.A. in fine arts from the University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee in 1972. After graduation, she moved to northern California and felt a connection with this place that hosts rich and diverse cultures and people from different backgrounds. Since then, the San Francisco Bay Area has been home for Barroga and a prominent stage for her career as a playwright. Barroga started playwriting in 1979 as a personal response to her father’s passing. Later she explored her own Filipino heritage and a broad range of cultural, political, racial, and ethnic issues in her plays. In two decades, she has written more than fifty plays, including five that have been broadcast on cable television. Her work has been published, anthologized, and produced nationwide. Today, Barroga plays an active role in many theater groups in northern California and in the nation: the Dramatists Guild, Theater Bay Area, Marin Theater Lab, Quarry (A.C.T.), New Works Forum (formerly Playwright Forum), TheaterWorks, and Teatro Ng Tanan. Since the 1990s, Barroga has been teaching playwriting in colleges, universities, and theater groups. She has taught playwriting for California State University at Monterey Bay and Colorado College and for theater groups such as Pintig Group in Chicago, Peninsula Civic Light Opera in San Mateo, Teatro Ng Tanan, and the Asian American Theater Workshop in San Francisco, as well as for numerous Bay Area high schools and universities. A playwright and teacher, Barroga is also a producer, director, and literary manager. In 1983, Barroga founded the Playwright Forum in Palo Alto, California. She has served as literary manager for the Oakland Ensemble Theater.\n\nJEANNIE BARROGA\n\n7\n\nSince 1985, she has been the literary manager/spectrum artist of TheaterWorks in Palo Alto. Barroga has directed and produced many plays, including When Stars Fall for the Playwright Forum, Bubblegum Killers at TheaterWorks and Il Teatro in San Francisco, Kin at the Asian American Theater Company in San Francisco, Horner Performance Center in Portland, and El Teatro Campesino in San Juan Baustista, and Kenny Was A Shortstop for Brava! Women for the Arts in San Francisco. Assisting Amy Gonzalez, Barroga directed Voir Dire by Joe Sutton at TheaterWorks in Palo Alto, as well. Barroga’s accomplishments have placed her on grants panels, won her commissions, and garnered her numerous awards. They include the Maverick Award from the Los Angeles Women’s Festival, the Joey Award from TeleTheatre, the Tino Award from TeleTheatre, and Work of Excellence from Cupertino, as well as awards from the Bay Area Playwrights Festival Ten-Minute Play Contest and the Inner City Cultural Center Short Play Competition in Los Angeles. MAJOR WORKS AND THEMES Barroga writes with passion, perseverance, and a blend of stylistic innovations. Her plays are an ardent quest into the self, the Filipino American experience, and American national identity. They embrace the personal and the public, individual lives and public history, and spheres personal, cultural, and political. Intergenerational conflict, the tension between tradition and assimilation, ethnic culture, and mainstream culture are the focus of Barroga’s earlier plays. Eye of the Coconut (1986) epitomizes the classic conundrum through the stories of a Filipino American family in Milwaukee. Dad, who came from the Philippines as a child to pursue a career as a musician, is confronted with three teenage daughters who have minds and dreams of their own. They prefer to date Caucasian men rather than Filipino men, for example. Their preference inevitably intensifies the struggle of assimilation their parents themselves are encountering. In Rita’s Resources (1995), Barroga uses highly symbolic devices to capture the reality of the Filipino immigrant family in Milwaukee of the 1970s and the illusion of the pursuit of the American dream. As symbols of the American dream and materialism, the Statue of Liberty, the car, Big Bird, and the spaceman present a contrast to the plight and challenges of Rita, the Filipino American seamstress. Barroga’s plays also move beyond the tale of assimilation to portray immigrant groups’ quest for identity, truth, and understanding. Her recurrent use of newspaper reporters as the main characters in her plays is a bold device. Her Asian American female characters are active, inquisitive, conscious, and awake, quite the opposite of Asian females stereotyped as geishas, ornaments, prostitutes, or submissive human beings. They are engaged in a search for meaning of personal, cultural, and historical magnitude, sometimes in angry, confounded, tormented, and emotionally charged states. In Talk-Story (1992), Dee, a Filipino\n\n8\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nAmerican heroine, is a copy girl striving to be a newspaper columnist in order to uncover new angles and write stories featuring her father and uncle in the Philippines and in California. Cora in Kenny Was a Shortstop (1990) is a newspaper reporter who covers the story of a young Filipino killed in a gang accident. In the process, she also uncovers hidden angers and resentments of Kenny’s mother as well as her own painful memories. Barroga’s exploration of the complexity of politics, race, and ethnicity in America unfolds more deeply in Walls (1989), a play inspired by Jan Scrugg and Joel Swerdlow’s book To Heal a Nation. Vi, a Chinese American reporter, probes the controversial and entangled issues centered around the Vietnam War Memorial and challenges the war of indifference and prejudice on race and ethnicity. The play reflects multicultural America. Barroga creates in the play racially diverse characters—five Asian Americans, three African Americans, and six Caucasians—in representative roles as patriotic veteran, army nurse, protester, and others who were wounded or victimized. In touching and powerful ways, the play acknowledges the traumatic history of the war, probes divisions arising from it, and examines the power of politics over art, the victimization of white and ethnic Americans, and the building of “walls” of division and separation. Despite her use of walls as a metaphor denoting multiple levels of separation and gap between mainstream Americans and ethnic Americans, Barroga urges the necessity to break down the walls and presents her hope and vision for healing, reconciliation, and understanding. CRITICAL RECEPTION Productions of Jeannie Barroga’s plays have drawn critical attention from theater reviewers in the mainstream media, ethnic newspapers, and magazines published in English, as well as more serious examination recently from scholars in academic institutions. Theater reviews written for the mainstream media can hardly be counted as rigorous studies of Barroga’s plays. The reviewers demonstrate some understanding of the issues and struggles of the characters. However, they seldom achieve an insight, depth, or empathetic understanding that is satisfying. The reviews are impressionistic and episodic, revealing little about the characters, the plays, or the playwright. They can be read as phantasmagoria—mainstream America holding a mirror to ethnic America and startled to discover a foreign and unfamiliar assemblage, very much unlike their own, and not knowing what to make of it except labeling it as wild, comic, and absurd. Criticism from theater reviewers centers on the plays’ structural and character development. In a Seattle Times article, Wayne Johnson praises the Northwest Asian American Theatre production of Eye of the Coconut as “boisterous” and “spirited” (E9). Laurie Winer of the Los Angeles Times writes of the anthologized Talk-Story as a “thin work.” While Winer acknowledges that Dee, the heroine of the play, has “personality and integrity,” she questions the internal logic of the character and her actions and terms one of the most passionate\n\nJEANNIE BARROGA\n\n9\n\nspeeches of Dee as “impossible to imagine” (42). In his review for the San Francisco Chronicle, Steven Winn comments that characters in Eye of the Coconut are “unmotivated” “synthetic emblems” lacking “an authentic human ring” (C7). Theater critics seem to urge plausible actions and dialogue to achieve unity in artistic creation. In the San Francisco Examiner, Robert Hurwitt sees Eye of the Coconut as evidence of the harm sitcoms have done to theater. He sees the performance as “generally ringing from underdeveloped to amateurish mugging” (C1). In his review for the Village Voice, Luis H. Francia deftly captures the conflicts and central issues of the play Rita’s Resources as revolving around the racially divided America of the early 1970s and the disappointments in the character’s quest for the American dream. Yet he questions the play’s artistic creation and views the play as “largely predictable” and the portrayal of the family’s world and the larger American society as “sketchy” and “more uttered than shown” (90). Ethnic newspapers published in English—A. Magazine, Filipino Reporter, The Filipino Express, International Examiner, the Asian Reporter, AsianWeek, and Filipinas Magazine—offer another source for the reception of Barroga’s plays. Devoid of derogative perceptions like those in the mainstream media, the reviews in ethnic periodicals center on the themes, productions, and casts of the plays. However, they are brief and are more factual than critical or analytical. In the academic arena, a generation of scholars and writers has become conscious of new ethnic and women’s literature. These scholars collect, publish, study, and teach less represented writers as a deliberate effort to expand boundaries and lift new artistic creation out of the shadow of silence, denial, and misunderstanding. Jane T. Peterson and Suzanne Bennett dedicate a biobibliographical entry to Jeannie Barroga in Women Playwrights of Diversity. Roberta Uno at the University of Massachusetts is outspoken and bold in voicing the sensibilities and experience of Asian American women playwrights. She places Barroga’s Walls among the best dramatic literature written by Asian American women since the 1970s. In her introduction to Unbroken Thread: An Anthology of Plays by Asian American Women (1993), Uno powerfully and convincingly argues for a place for Asian American theater and justifies “the ongoing battle by Asian Americans to interpret their own images in both the popular media and the stage” (3). Uno sees the plays and performances as a thread, “a cultural continuum” and a “continuing sense of cultural connection” that “marks the dynamic response of Asians in America” (8–9). In 1997, Barroga’s Talk-Story was anthologized in another important collection, But Still, Like Air, I’ll Rise: New Asian American Plays, edited by Asian American playwright, activist, and scholar Velina Hasu Houston of the University of Southern California. Though the collection is not an analytical study of Barroga’s play, Houston offers rich historical, social, and cultural contexts in which to view new Asian American plays. Her primary goal is to redress a critical history that is written from “the heterosexual, patriarchal, Euro-centric\n\n10\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nperspective” that “presents itself as unchallengeable, immortal, and righteous” (Houston xv). She claims the playwrights of Asian descent residing in the United States as a liberating force: “They lift stereotypes to the wind, broaden the perspectives of ethnic identities of color, and flood people’s understanding, in the hope of greater ethnic tolerance” (Houston xvi). Josephine Lee, associate professor of English at the University of Minnesota, devotes the first scholarly and critical attention to Barroga’s Walls in her book Performing Asian America: Race and Ethnicity on the Contemporary Stage. Lee discusses the performance of race and ethnicity on the stage, the varying perceptions of Asian American performance, and the value of constructing race and ethnicity in theater and American culture. She speaks of the exploration of “Asian Americanness” as necessary not only in forming a “pan-ethnic identity” but also in the “formation of alliances across racial, gender, and class lines . . . to combat racism, sexism, poverty, and systematic discrimination that hurt society as a whole” (209). While Lee acknowledges the complexity in the portrayal of racial, social, cultural, and personal differences in Walls, she sees the value of the play in particular as “helping to define relationships among dominant and minority cultures . . . and envision situations in which some understanding can take place” (210).

Cutter\n\nBIOGRAPHY Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing, China, on October 5, 1947, to a Chinese mother and a Dutch American father. Berssenbrugge grew up in Massachusetts and received a B.A. from Reed College in 1969 and an M.F.A. from Columbia University in 1973. She has lived and/or worked in New Mexico, Rhode Island, Ohio, Massachusetts, Oregon, New York, and numerous other locations. It is not surprising, then, that one strong theme of her drama is cultural and geographical crossings—from the past to the present, from China to the United States, and from the world of the parents to the world of the children. Berssenbrugge has authored one play but is known primarily for her poetry and her collaborations with visual artists such as Kiki Smith and Richard Tuttle. She has won numerous awards, including the American Book Award (1980, 1984), National Endowment for the Humanities awards (1976, 1981), the Before Columbus Foundation Book Award (1980), and the Asian American Writers’ Workshop Annual Literary Award (1997). Her poetry has been featured in journals such as East-West Journal, Partisan Review, American Rag, and River Styx and has frequently been anthologized. Her only play, One, Two Cups, highlights themes of her work as a whole and articulates dilemmas that are central for many Asian American women writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston.\n\nMAJOR WORKS AND THEMES Ian Hamilton calls Berssenbrugge “a philosophical poet” who questions “being and language simultaneously” (43). The same can be said of Berssenbrugge’s poetry and drama in general. Her poetry blurs the boundaries between\n\nMEI-MEI BERSSENBRUGGE\n\n15\n\nvisual art and words, between music and language, and between self and other. For example, one of her books, Mizu, tells a Japanese folktale about a boy who disappears underwater; the book is structured as an accordion and unfolds to almost fourteen feet so that the poem itself becomes visual art. Berssenbrugge has also collaborated with choreographers and has had her poems set to music, once again undermining boundaries between “different” art forms. A poem such as “Sphericity,” written just before and after the birth of Berssenbrugge’s daughter Martha, blurs gradations between “self” and “other”: “The time of having her becomes an absorptive surface, instead of when the person was alive/ . . . As if a person being was like hearing” (Sphericity 26). Like Berssenbrugge’s poetry, One, Two Cups (1974) experiments with form and with the blurring of boundaries and borders. This densely lyrical, abstract play questions identity through the merging of the three principal characters, Lily, Lillian, and Leilani, and questions language and storytelling through its musings on this very subject: “They put the stories inside you, wrapped in cloth. But then the threads began to rot away, and the stories and the rags lie jumbled in the bottom of the jar” (68). At times it is difficult to tell who is speaking to whom, or whether the dialogue is actually enunciated to another person. In her “remarks,” Berssenbrugge herself says that sometimes the speaker is a voice and not a character; she also comments that perhaps neither mother should speak (51). Furthermore, the characters of the two mothers (Lillian and Emily) are deliberately blurred into the characters of the two daughters (Lily and Leilani). The play also shifts from a contemporary time period in the United States to Beijing in the 1940s and back to what seems to be the United States. These shifts and blurrings underscore the play’s major theme: the confusion of identity between mothers and daughters and the difficulty of hearing the stories of the past that actually construct us in the present. Like Maxine Hong Kingston’s mother in The Woman Warrior, these mothers are difficult to know, difficult to hear. Yet their voices are crucial since it is precisely the stories of the mothers in the play that create the daughter/author: “What is this but being switched on us as if we were invented by them and without their consulting us?” (One, Two Cups 51). We are “invented” or created at least in part by the past—and by the stories of our relatives in the past even when they remain unarticulated. We must therefore struggle to hear these allusive and elusive voices. CRITICAL RECEPTION Berssenbrugge’s poetry has been reviewed favorably and frequently. For example, Jackson Mac Low states that “calmly and convincingly she leads our attention from confidence of passion or attention itself to ice crystals, gulls, fireworks, or apple trees and to very specific qualities of perception, especially vision . . . in poetry that always speaks equally about ‘the world’ and ‘herself.’ ” Rosemarie Waldrop calls Empathy a “dialogue of an extremely fine-tuned in-\n\n16\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\ntelligence with the world” and argues that it “is not just a fine book. It is an event. An important event.” To date, however, Berssenbrugge’s drama has received no critical attention.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Works by Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge Drama One, Two Cups.

Her parents lived and initially met among the congested streets of Chinatown in nearby San Francisco. The local church provided a social connection for them and proved formative, in Chan’s estimation, of much of their community’s cohesiveness. While her parents came of age in a relatively bilingual environment, she spent her youth in the suburbs speaking English along with a smattering of Cantonese. However, during my interview with her, she discussed at length her family trips to Arizona. If the southwestern landscape looms large in her writings, it may well be her early experiences in that region that contribute to its significance. For Chan, such early travel enhances her knowledge of and insight into the interracial dynamics that help construct Chinese identities in the United States. Chan studied literature at Yale University and subsequently became a YaleChina teaching fellow, which enabled her to teach English at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the mid-1980s. Such experience apparently proved valuable, for she currently holds a position at the Marin Academy, where she teaches various courses in English literature and creative writing to high-school students. In the period between these positions, Chan worked as a dramaturge and literary manager at the Magic Theatre in San Francisco (1988–91) and helped with Berkeley Repertory’s production of Maxine Hong Kingston’s The Woman Warrior at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. In spite of Chan’s involvement with the theater and her composition of choreopoems in college, she did not write her first play until the age of twentynine, as part of the prerequisite for entering graduate school. Chan received her\n\nEUGENIE CHAN\n\n19\n\nM.F.A. in dramatic writing from New York University in 1993. Her awards include winning the Mixed Blood versus America Playwriting Contest (1994) and a New York University graduate achievement award in screenwriting and playwriting (1993). Her screenplay Willy Gee! was a 1997 CineStory Competition finalist as well as a semifinalist for the Nicholl Fellowship. MAJOR WORKS AND THEMES Chan’s corpus consistently engages the intersecting issues of class, religion, sexuality, gender, and ethnicity. By setting the majority of her dramatic productions in the western or southwestern United States, she exposes the oftencontradictory affiliations that help to construct Chinese identities in the “American” landscape. Her works thus deal with the specific material and fantastic relationships among Chinese immigrant, Latino, and native American populations. Characteristic of Chan’s writings, Novell-Aah! (1993) examines the position of two Chinese women in a world structured by men, particularly in the realm of male fantasies materialized through popular culture. The women in the play seem capable of nothing more than reproducing the milieu of cliche´s established by the narrating voice-over of El Locutor as they await the presence of a man to activate their lives. The one-act’s conclusion, however, finds the women establishing a relationship with one another; female homoeroticism offers an alternative to the futile and endless wait for a man. Departures and arrivals, of course, mark the immigrant experience also. Chan most explicitly explores the comings and goings that buttress contemporary concerns such as migrancy, diaspora, and borders in Emil, a Chinese Play (1994). Using the device of the mother-daughter dyad along with the absent father and pseudoincestuously driven relative (a cousin, whom the audience may view as an actual member of the protagonist’s clan or the son of an “uncle” or “auntie”— paper or otherwise), this drama bears a certain intertextual resemblance to some of Chan’s other works, but in this play, the stage suggests movement. The title character, a “foreign” man from “South America,” begins his journey in Miami through the South, the Midwest, and Disneyland, eventually arriving in San Francisco’s Chinatown. In a cinematic type of construction, the scenes in the first half of the piece crosscut between Emil and a young Chinese woman named Maggie (the daughter of the mother/daughter pair). The three principal characters come together and split apart in the space of Chinatown through the theatrical devices of a comic panorama of the United States in act 1 and a bizarre love triangle in act 2. Mother and Maggie alternate investment in Emil. The love story provides a unique vision of interracial romance. From food to offspring to chopsticks, Emil, a Chinese Play interrogates what constitutes the boundaries of “Chinese” and the forces invested in constructing a “Chinese” lineage. A more rustic landscape sets the stage for Willy Gee! (1994), a Depression-\n\n20\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nera tale of a Chinese family in California. Perhaps the closest piece to a history play, this work interrogates the Chinese mythology of the American West. Lily and Augustine Gee run a brothel, with grandma and their adolescent son Willy on the premises. Exposing the hypocrisy of the white “Anglo” establishment, the screenplay comically shows the entrepreneurial ingenuity of a Chinese family in the midst of racial and religious misunderstanding. At the center of the narrative, Willy comes of age and works toward a better understanding of his peers, his family and their business, and his own sexuality. Chan’s full-length play Rancho Grande (1997) opens in “a desert expanse in the American Southwest.” Mixing Spanish, English, and Chinese, the protagonist Mamie begins with a narrative variant of the Chinese Mid-Autumn Festival (zhongqiu jie). The folktale informs the audience specifically about the role of women and coming of age in the lives of a Chinese family of sojourners, but Chan complicates the very notion of home for this nonnuclear familial unit. In addition to interacting with two deities that seem infused with Chicano and Native American influences as much as Chinese ones, Mamie develops cognizance of her sexuality and its attendant expectations in and through the absence of her father. To confuse this scenario even further, Mamie’s brother, Sammy, queerly identifies with his sibling, in whom he displays an incestuous interest, as well as his father, who is mostly absent from home. This tension between and within gender characterizes the bulk of Chan’s dramatic storytelling. Given her proclivity for producing work concerned with generations of gendered Asians, audiences may expect perplexing parental figures and meandering men to recur as figures and themes throughout many of Chan’s productions. In the short film Paradise Plains (1993), Chan again addresses the topic of incest. This time, the relationship occurs between an uncle and niece. Although Chan does not deal at all with Chinese characters in this film, she said in my interview with her that an Asian American play is anything that falls “within the imagination and experience” of a writer who might identify with such a label. Chan thus expands the boundaries imposed by a theater of cultural nationalism in favor of a more expansive definition of the term “Asian American.” In so doing, she helps add a new chapter in Asian American theater history by moving beyond the conventions established in the 1960s and 1970s to a more fluid conception of Asian American identity and concomitant cultural production. The screenplay Athena Adrift (1997) also uses Chinatown as a setting. However, this scenario invokes Chinatown as an ambivalent space. Living with her mother Flora and her brother Nelson, Athena longs to find romance. While she dreams through the literature that she teaches—be it through the words of Sor Juana or a Bronte¨—her quixotic fantasies eschew a Chinese cultural connection, much to the chagrin of her mother, whose own suitor is a wealthy Chinese entrepreneur. The play explores the dynamics of heterosexual relationships of different generations and across racial lines. Nelson engages in an affair with a South American named Cleopatra, while Athena’s dating attempts find her in bed with a Japanese-identified Italian. By the end, Athena must negotiate her\n\nEUGENIE CHAN\n\n21\n\nown relationship to her Chinese heritage both emotionally and professionally. Her final confrontation with her obnoxious and mysterious admirer takes her through San Francisco into Chinatown’s crowds. The brief piece Sticks and Stones (1999) comments on gender and sexual difference in a slightly different way. This work stages the attempts of two characters (“Girl” and “Boy”) to communicate with one another. Moving from their verbal misfires, the pair eventually finds some sort of connection through one another’s corporeality. A similar theatrical device seems to inform the oneminute drama Esmerelda (1997). This pithy monologue presents the physical processes of a woman’s waiting for someone who never arrives. Chan’s current project Snakewoman (2001) is a taiko percussion piece. The story concerns a half woman, half snake with three breasts and three children (one black, one white and one lemon), whose fathers are gods. This latest work continues Chan’s exploration of the diverse myths and fantasies that impinge on any conception of reality. Central to all of Chan’s works, issues of family, gender, and identity continually resurface in a variety of contexts. Family, in particular, is a well-worn trope in Asian American drama. Chan’s remarkable ability to affirm and interrogate Chineseness in a multiethnic landscape both enriches and problematizes any attempt to claim cultural membership and thus refigures old familial models of ethnicity. In other words, Chan’s writings attest to the complicated material and psychic affiliations that render the term “Asian American” both meaningful and highly contentious.

Born in Berkeley, California, on February 25, 1940, Chin graduated from the University of California at Berkeley. At an early age, he moved to Oakland to realize “big ideas.” He was the first Chinese American brakeman on the Southern Pacific Railroad, an experience that he masterfully sketches in various works of fiction and drama. Chin also takes pride in being the first Asian American playwright to have a play produced at the American Place Theatre in New York in 1972, when Asian American writing as literature had hardly been heard of, not to mention recognized. Chin became a playwright by chance. In 1970, he went to Maui, Hawaii, where he worked with friends in construction. When the East West Players in Los Angeles held a playwriting contest, Chin, prompted by an urge to get off the island, wrote The Chickencoop Chinaman in six weeks, won the $500 contest, and left the island. Then Chin met Randy Kim, a Chinese/Korean American actor who made his writing “fast, fun, and sharp,” and with Kim in mind he wrote his second play, The Year of the Dragon, which was also staged at the American Place Theatre (Davis 86). In 1988, Chin published a collection of short stories under the title The Chinaman Pacific & Frisco R.R. Co., which received the American Book Award from the Before Columbus Foundation. In the early 1990s, Chin turned his creative energy to writing novels, publishing Donald Duk in 1991 and Gunga Din Highway in 1994. Chin’s novels were influenced by writers such as the renowned African American novelist Ishmael Reed as well as by classical Chi-\n\nFRANK CHIN\n\n25\n\nnese writers like Luo Guanzhong and Shi Nai’an, respective authors of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin, and Sun Tzu, whose Art of War is a must read for all Chinese military academies and many U.S. military institutions. Indeed, Chin’s thinking on social, cultural, intellectual, and racial issues has benefited from these masterpieces. To say that Chin emulates the black revolutionaries of the 1960s is to underestimate the shaping power of Chinese classics. Chin is a controversial figure in the Asian American literary and cultural communities. Some have recognized him as the “Godfather” of Asian American writing (The Big Aiiieeeee! 529); others have called him an acrimonious critic. In any case, Chin has contributed to almost every major literary genre as playwright, novelist, essayist, critic, and editor. He was first editor of the groundbreaking Asian American anthology Aiiieeeee!, second editor of The Big Aiiieeeee!, and author of such widely cited essays as “This Is Not an Autobiography” and “Come All Ye Asian American Writers of the Real and the Fake,” though he is primarily regarded as a playwright and a novelist. MAJOR PLAYS AND THEMES The themes that Chin explores in his plays, novels, stories, and essays all concern Asian America, which he handles in such a way that they do not seem to be intended to please any one particular group or another. In his plays, Chin writes about historical, social, and intellectual issues relevant to Chinese and Asian American cultural heritages, expressing concerns over race relations, racial stereotyping, identity, family, history, and Hollywood. The Chickencoop Chinaman (1971) is noteworthy for being the first play by an Asian American produced at New York’s American Place Theatre, where it opened on May 27, 1972, and closed on June 24 “after a limited engagement of 33 performances” (Willis, vol. 28, 129). The play follows one main story line: The search for a father figure starts the play, and the failure to find one concludes it. The dramatic plot involves major U.S. races: Caucasian, Native American, black, Asian, and in-between products of interracial marriages; it explores issues such as assimilation, the social and political predicament of Asians in the United States, their cultural and racial identities, and their struggle to debunk racial stereotypes, especially of Asian men, who are believed to make “lousy fathers.” Complicating these issues are the endangered condition of the Asian American family and the persistent presence of racial violence on and prejudice against minority groups and individuals. In the play, the viewer/reader cannot find a complete, unbroken family that symbolizes unity and happiness. Tam Lum, a writer and filmmaker whose first name is often mocked for its resemblance to Tampax and the Anglo name Tom, flies out of Oakland, California, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in search of the father of Ovaltine Jack the Dancer, a former lightweight champion, for his documentary film, only to find that Charley Popcorn is not Ovaltine’s father but a\n\n26\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nformer boxer trainer who now runs a porno movie house, and who is a “bigot . . . nothing but a black racist when it comes to yellow people” (42). Even though Tam is looking for someone else’s father, he misses a real father and is himself not a good father because he is divorced from his Caucasian wife and his two children do not miss him. He tells Lee, the Eurasian girl who lives in Kenji’s apartment, “Chinamans do make lousy fathers. I know. I have one” (23); he even insults Lee with an ethnocentric observation: “I reminded you of your Chinese husband” (23). Thus the manhood of Chinese American males is drawn into question. Kenji, a research dentist and Tam’s longtime Japanese American friend, is not married to Lee but plays the role of a surrogate father to Lee’s son Robbie. Robbie claims that he has several fathers, though he knows not which one is his biological dad. Tom, Lee’s former Chinese husband, wants to be Robbie’s father and remarry Lee, but neither seems genuinely interested in returning to him. When the curtain finally falls on the audience, one is made to realize that the search for a father figure results in no hit, thus exposing the lack of manhood in Asian American males. Robbie is a male child under twelve, but he talks like a man. He has no innocence and cooks for all the adults under the roof of Kenji’s apartment. Tam, who went out of his way to Pittsburgh to locate Ovaltine’s father, in the end finds himself cooking in Kenji’s kitchen, too, while thinking about the ears his grandmother had for trains. Asian American men’s habitual use of the kitchen as a terrain of work, Chin seems to imply, results from the mainstream culture’s emasculation of them—thus Chin’s satirical portrayal of their loss of manhood. Another theme closely interwoven with the loss of Asian American manhood in the play is Chin’s concern with American racism and race relations. Representing white American racism is the Lone Ranger, who, with his faithful Indian companion Tonto, shoots Tam in the hand, calls himself “the law” and Asians “honorary white,” tells them to be “legendary obeyers of the law, legendary humble, legendary passive,” and directs them to go back to Chinatown to preserve their culture (37). The Lone Ranger offers Helen Keller as a compact model for all minorities (36). Tam sarcastically sums up this racist mentality: “Helen Keller overcame her handicaps without riot! She overcame her handicaps without looting! She overcame her handicaps without violence! And you Chinks and Japs can too” (11). Tam’s anger at racist America affects his perceptions of all races, including people of his own Chinese race such as Tom and the part-Chinese Lee. Tom is writing a book called Soul on Rice about Chinese American identity. He insists that he is not prejudiced against Chinese, that he is assimilated and accepted in white America, and that Lee is non-Chinese. Tom’s assimilationist attitude causes Tam to accusingly call him an “ornamental Oriental”: “You wanted to be ‘accepted’ by whites so much, you created one to accept you. You didn’t know Lee’s got a bucket of Chinese blood in her? At least a bucket? . . . You wanted a white girl so bad, so bad, you turned her white with your magic\n\nFRANK CHIN\n\n27\n\neyes. You got that anti-Chinaman vision” (59–60). On the other hand, Lee appears to be more egalitarian in her views of race relations—she has married Chinese, white, and black; now she is living with a Japanese and claims that she is on her way to Africa. Lee is not as race sensitive as Tam, nor is she as biased as Tom; she does not seem perfectly comfortable with her mixed identity, nor does she know what to do with it; hence the purposelessness of her life and her inability to acquire an identity that fits her. Also salient in The Chickencoop Chinaman is the role that language plays in defining identities. In Tam’s dialogue with the Hong Kong Dream Girl during his flight to Pittsburgh, the latter narcissistically believes that she has rid herself of her Hong Kong accent when speaking English, hoping that she sounds and will be considered Americanized. Like Tom, the Hong Kong–born stewardess yearns for assimilation and acceptance, though Tam offers her no such affirmation. On the other end of the linguistic spectrum, however, Tam’s and Kenji’s ebonic accent due to growing up in Oakland’s black ghettos confuses black men like Charley Popcorn. In fact, Tam’s black speech offends Popcorn because Popcorn never dreams that a Chinaman like Tam can speak his language, which causes him to mistake him for a black man on the phone, a mistake that is not corrected until the two actually meet in person at Popcorn’s porno movie house. It is obvious in Chin’s play that language can help both make and break one’s cultural identity, and that it bears little on the formation of identities. Tam and Kenji can fluently use different accents to sound like Helen Keller, like blacks or whites, but they are Americans of Asian descent. As Elaine Kim asserts, culture is not passed down through the blood (68). Chin’s second play, The Year of the Dragon, was also first produced at the American Place Theatre, where it opened on May 22, 1974, and closed on June 15 after thirty performances (Willis, vol. 30, 98). In January 1975, PBS aired the play as a ninety-minute television drama, with George Takei in the leading role (Kurahashi 73). Like Chin’s novel Donald Duk, the play unfolds its events on the Chinese New Year of the dragon, and like his first play, this one treats the Chinese American family from inside San Francisco’s famous Chinatown, though it looks more gloomily into the disintegration of the family. The drama revolves around several significant events occurring to the Eng family during the New Year: Pa Wing Eng’s imminent death; the arrival of China Mama, Pa’s Chinese wife; the return of the daughter Mattie (Sis) with her white husband Ross on a tour promoting her cookbook; the completion of little brother Johnny’s probation for possessing a gun; and the central character Fred Eng’s last tour of Chinatown. The play ends with Pa’s expected death and Fred’s continuation as a Chinatown tourist guide. The play is close to what may be called a modern tragedy, not unlike Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman, which also centers on the family and father/son relationships and features the death of the father. The most tragic dimension of Chin’s play is not the expected and even anticipated death of the tyrannical father, but rather the disintegration of the Chinese American family as a result\n\n28\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nof societal and political circumstances beyond their control. Pa Eng is a bigamist and brings his Chinese wife over for the mere sake of dying Chinese. His American Chinese wife, Hyacinth, has no control over her husband’s decisions or her children’s (one of them, Fred, is not her biological son), but she seems capable of finding release from her stress by hiding in the bathroom, the only quiet spot in her Chinatown apartment. China Mama, though physically present, remains motionless and speechless for the majority of the duration of the play. Her dramatic name symbolizes the remote, ancient China that the Eng family has left behind and that is now brought back by the tyrannical wish of the dying father. Mattie, who wanted to be just people and not Chinese and married a white guy to live her philosophy, is assimilated into the mainstream culture in Boston, and now she wants her family to move out, too. Johnny, on the other hand, hates white people and refuses to leave Chinatown because that is where he feels at home. Fred, stuck between these two positions, sacrificed his youth and his dream to become a writer by helping Mattie out of Chinatown; now he wants to do the same for Johnny by trying to prevent him from becoming a tourist guide like himself and urging him to marry a white girl while he is young. But Johnny turns out to be a Chinatown tourist guide despite Fred’s opposition. Pa Eng’s death wish for Fred to become Chinatown’s mayor is shattered; Mattie presumably returns to Boston; Fred and Johnny both work as tourist guides in Chinatown. Fred in the end “appears to be a shrunken Charlie Chan, an image of death” (141). Elaine Kim’s reading of Jeffery Paul Chan’s “Auntie Tsia Lays Dying” seems pertinent here: “Chinatown is a ‘fraud,’ a place of death where listless celibacy and sterile incompleteness are thinly veiled by a cheap facade for tourists” (73). The fact that Fred hates his job and swears so much indicates that he feels confused about his identity: Chinese or American, neither or both? His father wants him to be Chinese and responsible; indeed, Fred has been responsible and even filial, despite Pa’s accusation of him otherwise. In contrast, his American Ma seizes opportunities to remind him, “Don’t forget you’re ‘Chinese of American descent’ ” (92). As a result, Fred has to struggle in this “catch-22” situation—after his father’s death he is expected to take care of both his biological China Mama and his American Ma, being forced by familial circumstances to be both Chinese and American. He understands his American mother perfectly, but he cannot even say a word and make sense to his Chinese mother. Out of frustration and anger, Fred tells China Mama: “I’m not Chinese. This ain’t China. Your language is foreign and ugly to me, so how come you’re my mother?” (115). Through disclaiming China Mama, Fred dissociates himself from China and its culture. But because the woman is his biological mother and now a U.S. citizen, she constitutes a new burden to Fred, so his never-stable identity is made even more insecure by this responsibility. The problematic identity issues are further dramatized in Mattie’s willingness to assimilate through interracial marriage. Mattie left Chinatown not to return\n\nFRANK CHIN\n\n29\n\nuntil fifteen years later, and now she calls Boston with Ross her home, not Chinatown with her folks in it. Fred enlightens his white brother-in-law about assimilation: “It’s the rule not the exception for us to marry out white. Out in Boston, I might even marry me a blonde” (85). This marrying out, to Chin, contributes to the disintegration of the Chinese American family, and ultimately to the extinction of Chinese American culture. It is an end result of assimilation, an issue that Chin drives home in his novel Gunga Din Highway, in which he relentlessly attacks Chinese Americans who take the highway of assimilation for white acceptance. Chinatown, for good or bad, betokens Chinese American culture, and for Fred it is “as real as China,” but if he steps out of its customary boundaries, he fears that he will become nobody (116). Chinatown itself is also in the process of disintegrating, however, because the people who inhabit and represent this coop are dying out. Pa Eng, for example, as Chinatown’s mayor, is sick and decrepit, losing not just health but also respect and control. When Fred answers no to his recurrent question “You my son yes or no?” Pa hits him and then collapses. Fred not only beats on his dead body but calls him “ ‘Mayor of Chinatown’ Flop” (140). Chinatown therefore is also a flop and should be abandoned, but fear of becoming a nobody outside it propels Fred to pathetically continue his existence as a tour guide in Chinatown for its performance value. CRITICAL RECEPTION Critical discourse on Frank Chin’s work varies from gender to gender. An investigation of the reception of his plays is inseparable from critics’ perceptions of his work in other genres. However, Chin’s views on Asian American history and culture and on specific issues such as family, assimilation, and racism were first formed and expressed in his two plays under discussion here. Reviews of The Chickencoop Chinaman are mixed. Jack Kroll views the play as an addition to “the roster of alienation coming out of our theatre and fiction,” though he is disappointed about the play’s roughness (55). “This first play needs more work—the basic emotional tone of hysteria is too unmodulated, the action is too thin, and awkward structure wrenches the play in and out of fantasy. But there is real vitality, humor and pain on Chin’s stage” (55). Responding to Betty Lee Sung’s charge reported in Dorothy Ritsuko McDonald’s introduction to Chin’s plays that the audience did not enjoy the play and kept dwindling, Joseph S.M. Lau writes that the reason for the dwindling was that “no one could possibly finish watching the play without feeling scathed. . . . Language offends as much as the smell of Wing Eng’s long turd” (101). Chin is unpopular because, according to Lau, “the work of a writer suffering from self-contempt naturally makes unpleasant reading. . . . In a solitary way, however, Chin has fulfilled the essential moral obligations of a negative serious writer” (104). David Leiwei Li offers a more sympathetic reading: Chin’s play “exemplifies his tenacious drive to combat the discursive modes of domination that encode\n\n30\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nthe object position of the minority. . . . Chin wages war against the hegemonic exercise of power in the form of language” (215). Though Li is critical of Chin’s partial blindness to “the multiplicity of contemporary Chinese American reality,” he lauds Chin’s sense of responsibility as a writer. “There is little question that Chin is everywhere motivated by this sense of moral integrity” (221). Erik MacDonald reads The Chickencoop Chinaman as Chin’s effort to “create a location and a politics of identity amid a world that both shatters his identity and tries to provide instead a ready-made ‘Chinese American’ character” (142); in the end, “Chin discards the icons offered to the Asian Other, disemboweling the language, and thus apparently places Tam at once both inside and outside his society” (149). Elaine Kim views Chin’s work more critically, as an attempt “to reassert male authority over the cultural domain and over women by subordinating feminism to nationalist concerns,” and therefore “Chin’s indisputable status as pioneering advocate for Asian American literature and culture is undermined by his insistence on a system of binary oppositions that denies women an autonomous selfhood” (75). King-Kok Cheung agrees and considers Chin’s work as an effort to redefine “both literary history and Asian American manhood” (234), though she finds it disturbing that Chin “should lend credence to the conventional association of physical aggression with manly valor” (237). The Year of the Dragon has garnered similarly mixed receptions. Clive Barnes finds Chin’s second play an exploration of identity: how Chinese or how American is the Chinese American? Barnes appreciates Chin’s fascination with bicultural and generational issues, “especially if we think of his play in the terms of that American melting pot that never seems to be properly heated and never seems to be properly stirred” (39). Like some reviewers of The Chickencoop Chinaman, Barnes finds gaps and a lack of energy in the new play. Jim Moore, though not impressed with the performance of some actors, praises the play’s sophisticated presentation of Chinatown life: “It’s an angry, biting, funny, despairing play about real, invisible people struggling to escape stereotypes. Chin’s version of America’s Chinatowns is utterly convincing” (19). Dan Sullivan also faults the play for lacking a beat and being “a bit choked by all the stories Chin wants to tell”; nonetheless, Sullivan finds that Chin’s “Chinatown from the inside is much more interesting than it is from the bus” and that the play is “easily the strongest full-length script East/West has done” (17). Yuko Kurahashi views the play as Chin’s attempt to reclaim Chinese American manhood as well as a criticism of the assimilation of Chinese Americans. Chinatown thus is a contested battleground. Chin’s view of Chinatown is twofold: “Chin regards Chinatown as the center of Chinese American life, which preserves ancient Chinese culture and traditions. On the other hand, he also views Chinatown as a product of American racism” (73). Therefore, neither leaving Chinatown nor remaining there is a desirable and winning option. As David Leiwei Li points out, Chinatown is treated as “a special hegemonic creation of the Chinese American sociogeographic space,” but the drama does not\n\nFRANK CHIN\n\n31\n\nfocus on “Chinatown as an exotic setting but on the burden and dilemma it poses as an existential space for the Chinese Americans there” (217). Even though Li construes Fred’s rebellion as “an act of resistance to the authoritarian father figure of the dominant” (218), the rebellion is not productive, for Fred in the end chooses to stay in Chinatown and becomes a Charlie Chan, who constitutes the most favorite target (created out of the white imagination) of Frank Chin’s scathing barrages of verbal attacks in almost all of his writings—novels, stories, essays, interviews, and last, but also the most important, his plays.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY Works by Frank Chin Drama “Act I of The Chickencoop Chinaman.” Aiiieeeee!

Sugano\n\nBIOGRAPHY Ping Chong was born on October 2, 1946, in Toronto, Canada, but grew up in New York City’s Chinatown. After high school, he went on to study filmmaking and graphic design at Pratt Institute’s School of Visual Arts. From 1964 to 1966, Chong started his theatrical career with Meredith Monk’s House Foundation, where he collaborated with Monk on several major works, including The Travelogue Series and The Games, for which they shared an Outstanding Achievement in Music Theatre Award in 1986. Chong’s first independent theater work was Lazarus, which was produced at the Lee Nagrin Studio in New York City. Since that time, he has created dozens of works for the stage, several of which have won prestigious awards, including Humboldt’s Current, which won an Obie Award in 1977, A.M./A.M.—The Articulated Man, which won a Villager Award in 1982, Kind Ness, which won a USA Playwrights’ Award in 1988; and Brightness, which garnered two 1990 Bessie awards. In 2000, Ping Chong received an Obie Award for Sustained Achievement from the Village Voice. Ping Chong and Company was formerly called the Fiji Theatre Company, which Chong founded in 1975 to explore performances that combine contemporary theater, multicultural issues, movement, and art. It is difficult to categorize Chong’s works, as they are all, to some degree, multimedia projects on wide-ranging and eclectic subjects. In 1990, Ping Chong created Deshima, the first of a series of performance works that explore East-West relations. In 1992, at New York City’s Artists’ Space, Chong created Undesirable Elements, an ongoing series of performance pieces that explore the effects of culture, history, and ethnicity on the lives of people in different communities. Chong created\n\n34\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\ndifferent versions of the show for Chicago, Cleveland, Minneapolis, Seattle, Rotterdam, and Tokyo. Deshima was followed by Chinoiserie (1995) and by After Sorrow (1997). His two latest shows are Pojagi, which is about Korean history, and Truth and Beauty (1999). In 1998, Chong further demonstrated his versatility when he collaborated with set designer Mitsuro Ishii and puppet artist Jon Ludwig to create Kwaidan, a puppet-theater work based on three Japanese ghost stories by Lafcadio Hearn. Chong’s other multimedia projects include directing television specials— Paris with Meredith Monk for KCTV in Minneapolis and Turtle Dreams for WGBH in Boston, which won the Grand Prize at the Toronto Video Festival. His other original video works include I Will Not Be Sad in the World and Place Concrete for both WNET and WGBH. Chong has also created many video installations for museums and galleries: In the Absence of Memory (Hartford, Connecticut), Tempus Fugit (Marquette University), A Facility for the Containment and Channeling of Undesirable Elements (New York City), and Testimonial (Venice). Even though he has created dozens of plays, multimedia works, and performance works, Chong’s published theatrical works include only Kind Ness, Snow, and Nuit Blanche. MAJOR WORKS AND THEMES As indicated earlier, Ping Chong’s dramatic work is difficult to categorize and to describe because it combines performance art, multimedia installations, dance, and conventional theater. His influences, hence, are many, and his works are filled with allusions to history, philosophy, science, religion, and popular culture. It is unfortunate that just three of his dozens of performance works are available in print. Much of the performance’s effect may be diminished on the printed page anyway, because of the technical and choreographic nature of his work, but the three printed plays will receive most of the attention in this entry. Chong’s first major dramatic production was Nuit Blanche: A Select View of Earthlings (1981), which premiered at New York City’s La Mama in 1981. This play, like all of Chong’s, takes advantage of various media to give a cosmic view of colonial oppression and imperialism around the world. In Nuit Blanche’s eleven scenes, the audience is treated to a dramatic lens that yields a cosmic view of earth and zooms in on specific, yet paradoxically generic, locations: a South American estancia, a prehistoric cave, the Carolinas, and an undesignated third-world location. The audience moves through an ever-accelerating chronology as well. Scenes 1–5 encompass six years in the 1800s; scenes 6–8 take in a few days; the last three scenes take place in a matter of hours. The first scene begins with a fund-raiser who is “handling” the (imaginary and real) audience with flattery and with dire descriptions of the world’s extreme needs. Scene 2 presents a slide sequence of earth from space. Scenes 3–5 concern colonialism, classicism, and slavery on an unnamed South American plantation. Scene 6 is a slide sequence of a prehistoric cave with a soundtrack of bat sounds.\n\nPING CHONG\n\n35\n\nScene 7 leaps into the 1960s in the Carolinas, but the issues (with different characters) still involve the effects of slavery in the South. Scene 8 recalls the slides of earth from scene 2, but the last three scenes take place in a third-world resort in a country on the verge of revolution. As in the previous two locations, these scenes reveal the colonial attitudes of tourists through mundane conversations and interactions. The last scene (11) depicts in dumb show how consumerism and colonialism are destroying indigenous cultures. Kind Ness (1986) premiered in Boston and New York. Unlike Nuit Blanche, Kind Ness takes place in American suburbia of the 1960s and 1970s. Chong parodies American popular culture to reveal the ludicrousness of cultural constructs and the exploitation of intelligent animal life. The striking first scene is a slide show of paired disparate ideas with a humorous narration that contrasts images that are “like and . . . not alike. . . . What is harmonious and what is dissonant” (5). The rest of the play follows the loves and changes in five children and one precocious gorilla, named Buzz, as they grow up together through grade school and high school. Throughout the play, Buzz is taken to be one of the human group of friends, even though he speaks in his own primate language. The scenes take the audience through common school experiences—dances, dating, and learning about ethnic, physical, and class differences. There are two slapstick routines (scenes 4 and 7) that satirize popular American notions about colonialism and the great White Bwana, a scene that alludes to Buzz’s jungle roots. The last scene takes place in a zoo where Buzz and Daphne, now married, visit a captive gorilla and make ironic comments about his ungainly size and appearance. The couple wrongly believes that they understand the differences between themselves and the primate in captivity. Snow (1988) leaps forward and backward in time, beginning and ending in postwar Berlin (1946), but also covering World War I’s western front, Meiji Japan, seventeenth-century France, prehistory, nineteenth-century Massachusetts, and suburban Minnesota of the 1980s. If the play can be characterized, it seems to be, much like Nuit Blanche, a tone poem or meditation. Snow considers how all people of all different cultures and time periods are linked by life’s certainties: everyone’s struggle for survival interspersed by occasional acts of mercy. As in Chong’s other plays, there is a mix of media: projected images of snow and music that link the various scenes. The first scene reveals the grimness of postwar survival and the random oppression of the occupying Russian army. Scene 2 introduces Meiji Japan and the appearance of the Yuki Onna (“Snow Demon”) who sucks life out of the living. In most scenes, the falling snow reminds the audience of this common thread that connects all people of all times, all subject to the inclement weather and to death. An exception appears in scene 6 (near the middle of the play, the end of act 1) when seventeenth-century French nuns find and care for an abandoned baby boy, but the other scenes remind us that such grace derives from others’ profound suffering. Scene 7, the beginning of act 2, takes place at Mt. Chocorua in 1992 (four years in the audience’s future) and portrays a meeting of census takers. Each\n\n36\n\nASIAN AMERICAN PLAYWRIGHTS\n\nmember reports, some humorously so, on the number of surviving indigenous peoples, location by location. In the last three scenes (9 through 11), the figure of Death takes the place of the snow and makes timely appearances, showing the mundanity and banality of each situation. The play ends with snow falling, a boy’s narration recounting epic events in world history, concertina music, and a parade of people. As in Nuit Blanche and Kind Ness, Chong problematizes the survival of humanity and endangered species, as well as universal notions of otherness that both describe and perpetuate human suffering. CRITICAL RECEPTION Critics have responded to Ping Chong in a variety of ways: first, as a multivalent performance artist/director; second, as an Asian American; and third, as an avant-garde metaphysical playwright. In the first category, audiences have noted his training as a cinematographer, his collaborations with choreographer Meredith Monk, and his penchant for stylized visual-effect performance art rather than “conventional” theater. Noel Carroll observes: “Chong embellishes the themes of loneliness and alienation by utilizing several distinct techniques. . . . Even a normal movement like walking is de-familiarized” with an actor pacing across the stage repetitively, and “[a] familiar pose such as resting an arm on a table is alienated by sustaining it for a very long time” (Carroll, “Earthlings,” 74–75). Several of the numerous interviews with Chong mention his ethnic identity and his development as an artist. Many theater reviews have noted his jolting visual effects and the multicultural themes of his work. It is apparent that his body of work accentuates ideas of “culture and the other” (Chong, “Notes” 63). But Chong is careful to add that his work is not just “ethnic,” or Asian American. “I’m addressing an American audience, whoever they might be. . . . The basic issue of how our culture deals with another is primal, basic” (Chong, “Notes” 64–65). That intercultural relationship is another important key to appreciating Chong’s work. His plays reveal cultural tensions—a relational push and pull—that exist in all relationships and all cultures. That effect is largely responsible for his being classified as “a postmodern playwright of a dreamlike bricolage” (Moynihan 105). In his plays, characters converse, but do not actually respond to each other: scene changes also indicate radical shifts in perspective and t"
