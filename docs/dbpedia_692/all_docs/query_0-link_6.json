        "text": "You really need to move to New York. You’ve heard that, right? I don’t live in New York City; is my playwriting career doomed? Sometimes, it seems that way—or at least seems as though others feel that way. Recently, on a panel of six playwrights, the five before me all introduced themselves, “I’m First […]\n\nA fellow Dramatist Guild rep posed this question to me, in view of the ugliness that followed my blog post about the egregious guidelines set forth by Words Players in Rochester, Minnesota. It gave me pause, because the hate heaped on this small theater company became extreme, and some saw us, the playwright community, […]\n\nYears ago, I emailed the amazing EM Lewis (SONGS OF EXTINCTION, THE GUN SHOW) and asked her how, as a not-fresh-out-of-college, female, late-starting playwright not living in New York City, she’d managed to get her work noticed. Typically, she was very generous in her reply and said, among other things, that each year, she […]\n\n(Click here to read other posts in this series) Gratitude journals and their more public cousins—gratitude Facebook posts—have become mindful ways to connect with what is good in our lives. I’ve never done one, but it occurred to me a while back that doing a 365 Grateful for playwriting might illuminate a year’s worth […]\n\n(Click to read #365GRATEFULPLAYWRIGHT: A YEAR OF WHAT MAKES IT ALL WORTHWHILE/JANUARY PART ONE) Gratitude journals and their more public cousins—gratitude Facebook posts—have become mindful ways to connect with what is good in our lives. I’ve never done one, but it occurred to me a while back that doing a 365 Grateful for […]\n\nIn trying to choose a title for this blog post, I started out with something like “Why Women Need To Submit,” and realized just how awful that sounded. But in the context of play submissions—something I advocate fiercely—there is something worse: according to informal polls and at least one study, women submit fewer plays […]\n\nI make a lot of submissions. More than a few hundred a year, as anybody who knows me can attest. And submitting that much–no surprise–yields results in the form of readings, workshops, and productions, as I’ll recap at the end of next month. But before I do that, i.e. before I subject myself to […]\n\n(Reprinted from the November issue of The Dramatist) The Buffalo Infringement Festival, which celebrated its eighth year in 2013, is a wonderfully illustrative example of the constant creation and collaboration that defines the Buffalo theater scene. Though the Festival comprises art installations, dance, music, media, puppetry, and more, theater has always been an […]\n\nIf you don’t know what RIPP: Real Inspiration for Playwrights Project, please click here to get some context before reading. I have a feeling not everyone is doing this, as I keep getting emails from playwrights wanting to send me their plays or asking how to get produced which, again, is not the point of RIPP […]\n\nSo this is the biggest news: the world premiere of Seeds begins March 1 at Road Less Traveled Theater. I’m so excited for this and I’m so impressed with the work of director Kristen Tripp Kelly, and cast Todd Benzin, Diane Curley, Kelly Jakiel, Pam Mangus, and Diane DiBernardo. Just amazing. My daughter has been […]"
