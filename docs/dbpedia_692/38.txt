Julia Cameron has had a remarkable career, which in turn has given remarkable help to others. She is best known for her hugely successful books on creativity, including The Artist’s Way, which has sold more than two million copies worldwide, and her follow-up best-sellers The Vein of Gold, Walking in this World, and The Right to Write.

A poet, playwright, fiction writer, essayist, and theologian, Cameron has extensive credits in film, television, and theater. As a filmmaker, Cameron collaborated with her former husband, Martin Scorsese, on three films. As a playwright, her work has graced such stages as Princeton’s McCarter Theatre and The Denver Center for the Performing Arts. As an award-winning journalist, her work has appeared in the New York Times, Rolling Stone, the Washington Post, and other publications.

Julia Cameron is not only an active artist and journalist, she is also an active teacher, leading workshops internationally that have inspired thousands of people to pursue their creative dreams. As she writes in The Artist’s Way: “While there is no quick fix for instant, pain-free creativity, creative recovery (or discovery) is a teachable, trackable spiritual process. Each of us is complex and highly individual, yet there are common, recognizable denominators to the creative recovery process.” She has taught The Artist’s Way workshops in such venues as the Smithsonian, the New York Times, Omega, Esalen, and Wisdom House.

Other books in Julia Cameron’s extensive bibliography include: The Creative Life: True Tales of Inspiration;Heart Steps: Prayers and Declarations for a Creative Life; Blessings: Prayers and Declarations for a Heartful Life; Transitions: Prayers and Declarations for a Changing Life; The Complete Artist’s Way, a trilogy containing “further adventures along the trail;” and Floor Sample, a memoir.
