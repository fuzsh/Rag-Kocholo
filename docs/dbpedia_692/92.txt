Julia Cameron (b. 1948) is an American artist and author famous for her 1992 self-help book The Artist’s Way. Her artistic philosophy is founded on a belief that creativity is bred from self-confidence, personal development, and divine influence (rather than from the human ego). Cameron, who was once married to Martin Scorsese, is a prolific writer who has authored over three dozen books, plays, and film scripts.

“The creative process is a process of surrender, not control… Mystery is at the heart of creativity. That, and surprise.”

-Julia Cameron, American artist, from The Artist’s Way, 1992
