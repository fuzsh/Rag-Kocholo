        "text": "Holidays and reading go together like suntans and sunscreen, flights and delays, passports and control. And while bookshops may be vanishing from high streets across the globe, they are still fixtures at most major airports.\n\nThis sacred pairing of book and holiday is nothing new; it’s not even modern, according to British academic Anthony Bale. As he writes in his fascinating study of medieval holiday habits, A Travel Guide to the Middle Ages (2023): “To travel was to read, to read was to travel.” This thought is echoed, albeit in more florid terms, by Shannon Reed in another new bestseller, Why We Read: “Reading gives you the world.”\n\nThat sentiment applies as much today as it did in 1400. So here are some of 2024’s most promising titles to whet the holiday-goer’s appetite, to be read while on the road (or in the air) or consumed over the course of an entire break (in the case of the heftier tomes).\n\nSlipping into travel mood\n\nAnthony Bale’s aforementioned A Travel Guide to the Middle Ages could be subtitled “Around the Medieval World in 1,000 Years”. Drawing on early incarnations of guidebooks (or Ars apodemica) and first-hand accounts by pilgrims, vagrants and wayfarers (famously, The Book of Marvels and Travels, by Sir John Mandeville), Bale transports the 21st century reader to a boat sailing from Venice to Cyprus, a trek across the Holy Land, an epic journey to Khanbaliq, in Mongol China, and even to some imaginary destinations: the Fountain of Youth, the Island of the Amazons, and Caldihe, where sheep (apparently) grow on trees.\n\nCaptain James Cook’s third and final voyage of exploration, from England to Hawaii (1776-1779), is a contender for one of history’s most famous journeys. Or should that be infamous? This is the challenge Hampton Sides sets himself in The Wide Wide Sea: to weigh the swashbuckling thrills of Cook’s expedition against criticisms of its covert imperial purpose (to find the priceless Northwest Passage linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans). At the centre of the controversy is Cook himself, whose achievements have been “passionately contested” in recent years: was he a principled, daring explorer (returning Mai, a young Ra’iatean, to his homeland)? Was he the catalyst for centuries of colonial damage? Was he simply unwell, whether in body or mind? Sides wisely eschews any revisionism and lets the stories speak for themselves, leaving final judgments to the reader.\n\nEchoes, however faint, of Cook’s voyages might also be heard in Welcome to Glorious Tuga, an escapist, if superior, romance by Francesca Segal. Her heroine, 29-year-old Charlotte Walker, sails 11,000-odd kilometres to the remote island of Tuga de Oro, hiding a long-held family secret, harbouring a crush on a fellow traveller and armed with a grant to study tortoises. Enter a cast of delightfully eccentric locals, who combine indigenous traditions with time-frozen relics of British culture. Hilarity ensues, à la P.G. Wodehouse.\n\nTwo classic novels propelled by travel celebrate centenaries in 2024. Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain takes the idea of getting away from it all to absurd lengths. The story begins with a three-week holiday in the Swiss Alps that is transformed into an increasingly uncanny sojourn at a sanatorium for tuberculosis patients. Mann’s masterpiece has variously been read as a comic, if disturbing, allegory of human disintegration, an appraisal of pre-war Europe and a cry of existential despair. Take your pick.\n\nLike The Magic Mountain, E.M. Forster’s A Passage to India doesn’t qualify as a holiday novel exactly, but it sure is a journey. Briton Adela Quested travels to Chandrapore, India, to meet a prospective husband, only to find herself embroiled in an explosive sexual assault trial, in which a Muslim doctor is wrongly accused of raping her. Race, imperialism, sex and religion: maybe not everyone’s idea of a long weekend, but the tale makes for an immersive mental getaway.\n\nShort chapters for planes, trains …\n\nTarnished perhaps by the ease of at-home entertainment these days, I have survived long flights in recent years by purposefully burying my nose in a book, rather than losing myself in a binge-watch on my phone screen at cruising altitude.\n\nAfter a little trial and error, I have found the works best suited to this purpose tend to be A) short or B) divided into snappy, self-contained chapters. The challenge of unearthing such books would, I imagine, excite Shannon Reed, whose Why We Read responds to the question implicit in the title in 38 quirky, personal and easily digestible ways. Reed’s answers include: “Because she was forced to” (Thomas Hardy’s Tess of the d’Urbervilles), “Because she was paid to” (books with vampires), “Because she was grieving her father” (Harry Potter audiobooks), “Because reading’s fun” (George Saunders’ Lincoln in the Bardo) but mainly, to reiterate, “Because reading gives you the world.”\n\nWhat we read might sum up Adam Smyth’s brilliant The Book-Makers, which distils the printed book’s near 600-year historical span (since Gutenberg) into 11 deftly written chapters. Each concentrates on an individual to illuminate a particular bibliographical theme. So “Printing” is personified by the splendidly named Wynkyn de Worde, a Dutch (or possibly German) publisher working in 16th century London’s Fleet Street, while Nancy Cunard, Gilded Age It girl-turned-fearless-lefty-radical, embodies “Small Presses”.\n\nCharles Taylor’s new book explores “the human need for cosmic connections”, which might explain its title: Cosmic Connections. For Taylor, this means awareness of the world as being “shot through with joy, significance, inspiration”, while “cosmic” refers to aspects of nature, or “wilderness”. Cue 16 lean but still-meaty chapters on Romantic poets old and new (but not Duran Duran), such as Keats and Shelley, Hopkins and Rilke, Baudelaire and T.S. Eliot. These are writers who “generate in the reader the felt sense of a reality higher and deeper than the everyday world around us”.\n\nFew literary forms are better suited to being read in fits and starts than poetry, even when the poem in question extends towards book-length: witness Sidetracks, by one of China’s most acclaimed contemporary poets, Bei Dao (also known as Zhao Zhenkai). Ten years in the writing, its 178 pages comprise a verse memoir, whose digressive form reflects Bei Dao’s itinerant life: from Young Pioneer in Beijing to exiled artist living variously in Europe and the United States.\n\nBooks for loungers (or anyone with time on their hands)\n\nSmoke and Ashes, by Indian novelist Amitav Ghosh, is a learned and deeply personal book about opium: not, I hasten to add, about taking opium, so much as opium as a sociopolitical catalyst. Combining memoir, travel, history and politics, 18 essays provide a non-fiction companion to Ghosh’s extraordinary Ibis trilogy, which stars a motley crew of sailors transporting poppies between British India and British-run Canton. The historical basis for the trilogy, Ghosh argues, was obscured for centuries, until China’s meteoric rise reorganised the geopolitical map between East and West, and that between itself and Ghosh’s homeland.\n\nIn Frostbite, Nicola Twilley relates the 150-year history of refrigeration, which, in 2012, Britain’s Royal Society anointed the most important invention in the history of food and drink. Starting with 19th century ice harvests and cold cellars, Twilley pursues the development of “manufactured cold” to the present day, whether this means in the humble domestic fridge or the vast ice warehouses that keep the 21st century global food system from melting down.\n\nIt seems strange to add the moon to our list of easily overlooked phenomena, but how many of us take this extraordinary celestial body for granted? One exception is Rebecca Boyle, whose Our Moon makes a bold attempt to measure the satellite’s impact on Planet Earth, whether that involves tides and time, evolution and culture, warfare and technology or our past and future. Juggling science, religion, art and technology, Boyle squeezes three vast stories into a few hundred pages: how the moon was made, how the moon made us and how humans returned the favour. “The Moon says nothing for itself, but it says plenty about us. We project our dreams and our fervour onto its mottled surface and it serves as a mirror, both figuratively and literally.”\n\nOne could, if desired, say something similar about the written word, especially after reading David Bellos and Alexandre Montagu’s Who Owns This Sentence? In the beginning, humans made the word. Then the word made humanity. For the past 200 years, humans have protected it, largely through copyright. The story begins, almost idealistically, with writers trying to gain some control over their printed works, essentially through a monopoly awarding them a royalty. The situation today is decidedly different, argue Bellos and Montagu: “Most copyrights of commercial value now belong not to artists, but to corporations.” See Sony Music Entertainment’s purchase of Bruce Springsteen’s back catalogue for an estimated half a billion US dollars. (Only a few hundred years ago, Springsteen’s oeuvre would have been owned by God.) But even this feels like old hat compared to the encroachment of AI, which is currently making mincemeat of all copyrighted material without paying so much as a cent.\n\nBy turns adored and reviled, Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn may be literature’s equivalent of Captain Cook’s last voyage. Its status as a masterpiece of both children’s and comic writing has been diluted in recent decades by examinations of Twain’s racial stereotypes and racist language. Percival Everett’s extraordinary new novel James remixes all this – Twain’s genius, the book’s shortcomings and its controversy – by telling the original story from the perspective of Jim, the enslaved foil to Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn.\n\nNo one writes quirky, unsettling yet sympathetic fiction quite like modern Japanese novelists. Butter, by Asako Yuzuki (translated by Polly Barton), manages to fold in a chef-turned-serial-killer, an offbeat relation­ship between two women and an obsessive love of food (and possibly violence), before decorating the lot with a portrait of misogyny. The fact that the resulting tale was inspired by the real-life Kanae Kijima (known as The Konkatsu Killer) only adds a dash of bitter spice.\n\nKaliane Bradley’s debut novel The Ministry of Time has doubtless been repeatedly compared to The Time Traveler’s Wife (2003), by Audrey Niffenegger, largely because both feature history-bending romances. And while a love story is the emotional heart of Bradley’s book, it is not the be-all and end-all. Graham Gore (Arctic explorer and Royal Navy commander, 1809-1847) escapes the 19th century via a magical portal and lands in a recognisable present. This classic fish out of water is taught to swim by his “bridge” (or handler), who like Bradley herself is the daughter of a Cambodian refugee. Sparks fly, comic to begin with, as Gore weighs his world against our own, establishing whether carrots still exist, marvelling over modern toilets and goggling in disbelief that 9 million people can live in London alone. The joy of Bradley’s book is how it converts this banter into an intelligent comparison of different cultural moments. Love teaches Gore what it means to be an immigrant; our heroine-narrator gains understanding of less enlightened eras. Wonderful.\n\nUntil August is the “lost”, last novel by Colombian Nobel Prize winner Gabriel Garcia Márquez. Written when he was showing signs of dementia, the book wasn’t just abandoned; it was deemed unworthy of publication by none other than Márquez himself. Our heroine is Ana Magdalena Bach, who once a year gives herself over to a one-night stand soon after laying flowers on her mother’s grave. What the plot lacks in heft is compensated for by the prose, which is lively and exuberant. Granted, Until August is no One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967), but it bears comparison with works by all the pretenders. Katherine Min’s The Fetishist starts like a crime noir – young woman seeks revenge on the man she believes killed her mother – and continues as a gloriously wild noir farce, as her best-laid plans spin madly out of orbit and three damaged people confront the meaning of their existence. Given Min’s untimely death in 2019, The Fetishist is, sadly, the last book by a serious talent.\n\nDolly Alderton is also seriously talented, albeit in the closely observed, bittersweet vein of Sally Rooney or David Nicholls. Andy, the hero of Good Material, is that near-clichéd, modern Peter Pan who dreams of being a stand-up comedian and dates a woman, Jen, who is far too good for him. Waking up one day to find himself dumped and desolate, Andy tries something he ought to have done years earlier: see things from Jen’s point of view. With tenderly hilarious results.\n\nOn the beach\n\nOnce you arrive at your holiday destination, the dated definition of the classic beach read goes something like bonkbuster for the ladies, spy thriller for the gents. In these supposedly progressive times the order could be reversed, or dispensed with.\n\nEvery crime-fiction fan ought to love the Charlie Parker series by Irish master John Connolly. Mixing old-school whodunnit hooks with old-school gothic eeriness, The Instruments of Darkness, the 21st investigation for this peerless private eye, sees him trying to solve yet another impossible case: that of a child allegedly murdered by his mother and whose body cannot be found. Parker is helped by his bickering sidekicks Angel and Louis (if in slightly diminished roles), encounters super­natural forces and finally meets a woman who can see dead people – just like Parker himself. What sets the book apart is Connolly’s prose, which combines humour, horror and a dash, dare we say, of poetry."
