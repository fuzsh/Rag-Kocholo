        "text": "Main Births etc\n\nNew Ulm is a city in Brown County, Minnesota, United States. The population was 13,522 at the 2010 census.[6] It is the county seat of Brown County.[7]\n\nLocated in the triangle of land formed by the confluence of the Minnesota River and the Cottonwood River, the city is home to the Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, the Hermann Heights Monument, Martin Luther College, Flandrau State Park, and the August Schell Brewing Company. New Ulm is the episcopal see of the Roman Catholic Diocese of New Ulm.[8]\n\nU.S. Highway 14 and Minnesota State Highways 15 and 68 are three of the main routes in the city.\n\nHistory[]\n\nThe city was founded in 1854[9] by German immigrants Christian Ludwig Meyer, Alois Palmer, Athanasius Henle, and Franz Massopoust. The city was named after the city of Neu-Ulm in the state of Bavaria in southern Germany.[10] Ulm and Neu-Ulm are sister cities, with Ulm being situated on the Baden-Württemberg side and Neu-Ulm on the Bavarian side of the Danube river. In part due to the city's German heritage, it is a center for brewing in the Upper Midwest, home to the August Schell Brewing Company.\n\nIn the Dakota War of 1862, the city was attacked and burned by Taoyateduta (Little Crow) and his Dakota Sioux warriors.[11]\n\nOn July 15, 1881, New Ulm was struck by a large tornado that killed 6 and injured 53.\n\nDuring World War II, German POWs were housed in a camp to the immediate southeast of New Ulm, in what is now Flandrau State Park. In 1944 a New Ulm family was fined $300 for removing a prisoner from the camp, housing him and taking him to church.[12]\n\nThe Brown County Historical Society[]\n\nThe Brown County Historical Society, located at 2 North Broadway houses 3 floors of exhibits and one of the largest archives in the state. It contains over 5,500 family files, microfilm of census, naturalization, church, cemetery and birth and death records as well as business and history files. [1]\n\nDefender's Monument[]\n\nLocated at Center and State Streets, Defender's Monument was erected in 1891 by the State of Minnesota to honor the memory of the defenders who aided New Ulm during the Dakota War of 1862. The artwork at the base was created by New Ulm artist Anton Gag. The monument has not been changed since its completion (except for being moved to the middle of the block).\n\nHermann Monument[]\n\nMain article: Hermann Heights Monument\n\nThe Hermann Monument in New Ulm dominates the Minnesota River valley from a hill overlooking the city. Inspired by a similar monument called Hermannsdenkmal near Detmold, Germany, this figure served as a symbol for members of the Sons of Hermann, a fraternal organization of German Americans. In 1885, the 362 Sons of Hermann lodges across the country committed themselves to the construction of a monument representing their cultural heritage. Through the efforts of Minnesota’s 53 Sons of Hermann lodges, the monument was built in New Ulm, home to many German immigrants. The sculptor chosen for this project was a German sculptor from Ohio, Alfons Pelzer.\n\nA delegation from New-Ulm visited Ulm in 2009 and actually went up to the Teutoburger Forest and Detmold in the North of Germany to commemorate the 2000 year anniversary of the Varus battle, when Arminius, a chieftain of the Germanic Cherusci defeated a Roman army in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.\n\nGerman Bohemian monument[]\n\nA monument to German-Bohemian immigration to America is located in New Ulm. It was erected in 1991 by the German-Bohemian Heritage Society to honor the German-Bohemian immigrants who arrived in this area of the US, most by way of a boat landing on the Minnesota River some 150 yards to the east. The immigrants came mostly from small villages, with the largest number from the village centers of Hostau, Muttersdorf, and Ronsperg. Most of the immigrants were Catholic farmers who spoke a Bohemian dialect of German.\n\nInscribed in granite slabs around the base of the monument are the surnames of over 350 immigrant families. Many of these names are still prominent in the region. As more and more immigrants arrived, not all of whom could farm, they settled in the city of New Ulm and some of the small communities to the west and north.\n\nThe bronze statue that rests on top of the granite base was designed and sculpted by Leopold Hafner, a German-Bohemian sculptor who now lives near Passau, Germany.\n\nThe monument is located at 200 North German Street and is open year-round.\n\nCulture[]\n\nNew Ulm has been referred to as the City of Charm and Tradition.\n\nGlockenspiel in Schonlau Park[]\n\nNew Ulm's glockenspiel is one of the world's few free-standing carillon clock towers. It stands 45 feet high, and its largest Bourdon (bell) weighs 595 pounds while the total weight of the bells is two tons. The bells chime the time of day in Westminster style.\n\nMinnesota Music Hall of Fame[]\n\nIn 1962, it was first suggested by the governor that Minnesota develop a museum or Hall of Fame to honor the rich music heritage Minnesota has to offer.\n\nIn 1990, New Ulm offered its old library building for the hall of fame site. Owing to the area's ethnic music heritage, the New Ulm was chosen. The Minnesota Music Hall of Fame, Inc. was established with categories reflecting the wide variety of Minnesota's musical heritage.\n\nThe museum has displays of music memorabilia for musicians and groups from around the state, including Prince, Judy Garland, Bob Dylan, and local artists Whoopee John Wilfahrt and The Six Fat Dutchmen. The Hall of Fame and museum is located at First North Street and Broadway. In summer the museum is open from Memorial Day through Labor Day each Thursday, Friday and Saturday from 10:00 am until 4:00 pm\n\nEach year in October the museum holds a gala to induct new members into the Hall of Fame, known locally as Minnesota's Grammys.\n\nPolka capital of the nation[]\n\nMusic was always a part of life in New Ulm, especially with the arrival of the musically-inclined German-Bohemians in the 1870s. However, New Ulm took a major leap to national prominence in the 1920s.\n\nWhoopee John Wilfahrt’s successful career opened the door to what became known as “Old-Time” music. After him, other local bands such as those led by Harold Loeffelmacher, Babe Wagner, Elmer Scheid and Fezz Fritsche kept New Ulm well-known around the state and region. They even produced nationally popular recordings.\n\nWith the opening of George’s Ballroom and the New Ulm Ballroom and the start of KNUJ radio station in the 1940s, New Ulm billed itself as the \"Polka Capital of the Nation\". [2] For years New Ulm's famous Polka Days were known worldwide by polka lovers. The festival was held each year in July. Polka Bands played on Minnesota Street and people danced and drank beer until well past midnight.\n\nFestivals[]\n\nLocal events held annually in New Ulm have celebrated the German culture through food, music, and beer. New Ulm's Oktoberfest has been celebrated the first two weekends in October since 1981.[13] Bock Fest, often scheduled concurrently[14] with the local festivities for Fasching, has been celebrated since 1987 at the August Schell Brewing Company.[15] The current summer festival, Bavarian Blast, was created as a recent re-interpretation of New Ulm's longstanding festival, Heritagefest.\n\nIn popular culture[]\n\nNew Ulm was the setting and filming location of the 1995 independent film The Toilers and the Wayfarers, directed by Keith Froelich. The city was a filming location for the 2004 documentary American Beer. It is also the setting of the 2009 comedy New in Town, starring Renée Zellweger and Harry Connick Jr., although the movie was actually filmed in Selkirk, Manitoba.\n\nGeography[]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 10.26 square miles (26.57 km2), of which, 9.92 square miles (25.69 km2) is land and 0.34 square miles (0.88 km2) is water.[1] The Minnesota River and the Cottonwood River flow past the city on their way to the Mississippi River.\n\nDemographics[]\n\nHistorical populations Census Pop. %± 1860 635 — 1870 1,310 106.3% 1880 2,471 88.6% 1890 3,741 51.4% 1900 5,403 44.4% 1910 5,648 4.5% 1920 6,745 19.4% 1930 7,308 8.3% 1940 8,743 19.6% 1950 9,348 6.9% 1960 11,114 18.9% 1970 13,051 17.4% 1980 13,755 5.4% 1990 13,132 −4.5% 2000 13,594 3.5% 2010 13,522 −0.5% U.S. Decennial Census\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. Census Bureau released a report showing New Ulm has 65.85% of population with German ancestry, more per capita than any other city in the U.S.\n\n2010 census[]\n\nAs of the census[2] of 2010, there were 13,522 people, 5,732 households, and 3,511 families residing in the city.
