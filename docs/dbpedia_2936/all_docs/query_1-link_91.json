        "text": "Many people leave their homeland and travel and settle in different countries. Many do this because of persecution, famine, hunger, war, etc. Once they reach the country, immigrants and refugees have to face many problems. Before you read the challenges, read the list of the top 5 countries with the worst migration policies here.\n\nSome of the major challenges faced by immigrants are mentioned here â€“\n\nPrejudice\n\nIn most countries, it has been seen that immigrants face discrimination. Most countries' residents do not like immigrants entering their country and using up their resources and, most specifically, their job opportunities. Also, the fraud in immigration is increasing, and how to beware about it.\n\nRaising Children\n\nChildren of immigrants have to face a lot of problems too. The challenges that such students have to face can be depressing and lead to panic disorders and anxiety. Research shows that these students have to struggle more in schools and colleges.\n\nDifference in Culture\n\nYour social customs and rituals may or may not match with that of the native people of the country. The cultural rituals important for you can be really annoying for them. Therefore, both parties need to keep an open mind.\n\nIssues with Transportation\n\nIt is difficult for an immigrant to get a driver's license. Also, immigrants get little options with other means of transport as well. Also, most immigrants find traveling very costly. They usually face auto-related problems because of the age of their vehicle.\n\nAccess to Medical Services\n\nEveryone must have access to medical facilities. Immigrants get a lower rate of medical insurance coverage and poor services too. This can be due to fear of deportation or financial issues. Many cannot participate in basic healthcare programs due to discrimination.\n\nHousing\n\nFinding an affordable, safe, and decent house in a foreign country is challenging for any immigrant. Most immigrants are jobless and cannot afford house rent. Finding a house in another country for you is extremely difficult, and you need to keep more safety for your house.\n\nLack of Employment Opportunities\n\nImmigrants do face discrimination in their jobs. Many immigrants are excluded from important posts and projects even though they are capable. They are offered comparatively lower salaries and, in some cases, humiliated or bullied too.\n\nLanguage Problems\n\nIt is of utmost importance that you can communicate with the other person. If you cannot talk in their language, if they do not understand you, you can neither work for them nor learn or understand anything about the country.\n\nSumming Up"
