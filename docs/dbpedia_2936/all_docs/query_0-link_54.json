There was always some newcomer from Wales, looking for a stake in America, who had left his family in Wales. Usually he was a distant kinsman, but whether a blood relation or not, we regarded all Welshmen as belonging to our clan. Our house was small, but we crowded into the corners and made room for another. His food and bed were free as long as he stayed. We helped him find a job, and then he thanked us for our hospitality and went out of our house with our blessings upon him. This form of community life was the social law in all the cottages of the Welsh. It was like the law of tobacco among Americans.\n\nFrom a structural “housing perspective,” boarding reflected pressures within the local housing market created by a mismatch of the supply of shelter suitable for single men and the labor demands of the mill. The practice was not limited to the towns: in the countryside, a few rural farm families took in boarders, who included hired farmhands and laborers working in coal mines, salt works, the railroad, and even the urban iron mills: Davis, Iron Puddler, 73.\n\nTWO: Apollo’s Uneasy Transition from Iron to Steel\n\nTHREE: The McMurtry, Olmsted, and Eliot Plan for Vandergrift\n\nFOUR: Settling the Vandergrift Peninsula\n\nFIVE: The Steel Strike of 1901\n\nSIX: Growing Pains for a “Model Town”\n\nEpilogue"
