        "meta_description": "In the last thirty years, Italy has undergone an anthropological revolution: from a country of emigration that exported millions of emigrants around the world, it has reversed its vocation and has become a country of immigration. The presence of the newcomers on the Italian territory has not always been welcomed and integration has been problematical on diverse levels. In this article I explore how the rhetoric of the State, its laws and the media have portrayed the newcomers under the negative label of a “biblical exodus” or as a “mass invasion” (Portelli, Dal Lago) and have ineffectively managed the process of integration (Dal Lago, Parati). In order to counterbalance this inhospitable rhetoric of the State, I examine the construction of migrant’s narrative identity through the writings of some Italophone authors (Methnani, Ebri and Scego) who started to discuss issues of representation in their works and to reflect on the rapidly changing Italian society. In their works these authors “talk back” (Parati) to the host society entering a dialogic process (Bakhtin) whose mandate is to subvert prejudices and problematize the very notion of Italian national identity.",

        "text": "Italy and migrations\n\nsanare actually means to restore someone’s health; in this case, the implementation of the new law was intended to heal the country. This terminology, borrowed from the rhetoric of sickness, is based, in this context, on the assumption that becoming a country of immigration involves a contamination with the body of the country. By calling the law a sanatoria, the nation is characterized, and in the legal text it is narrated, as a diseased body - a metaphor that in the age of AIDS, does not fail to attract people’s attention. (Parati, 1997, 119)\n\n6While migrants are excluded and objectified in Italian legal and media narratives, they are seeking a way to challenge these narratives and replace them with their own. They started writing either journalistic articles or fiction, and have found a particular hospitable venue in literature, because, as Graziella Parati pointed out, “literature embodies here the only alternative to specific parameters in public representations. Literature initiates a discourse in which the migrant is not only the ‘foreigner’ that appears in the law, but also a speaking subject beyond the role of cipher in numerical immigration quotas” (Parati, 2005, 174). Migrant writers “critique and revise particular narratives embedded in law, and the identities and institutions these narratives enable” (Parati, 2005, 178). In doing so, they “talk back” to the Italian public, the media and the State and initiate a process in which they become the subjects producing the discourses on Italy, Italians, Italian-ness and on themselves while creating a dialogue and exchanging with the Italian public.\n\nMigrant writings in Italy\n\nfor many writers, estranged from their initial cultures as migrants or exiles, writing itself provides a home: the stories they tell offer cohesion for their fragmented identities. In a similar vein, migrants who write in Italian today express the same feeling of urgency and necessity, the same insistence on the value of writing as a bridge between cultures: “the place where we exchange our experiences, and each of us meets the other”, says Tahar Lamri, an Algerian writer living in Italy. (Chambers and Curtis, 2008, 394)\n\n8Autobiographical writing however, is just one component of the more complex and fascinating Italophone migrant literature. In fact, aside from autobiography, writers have begun exploring different fictional issues with very individual literary styles. Nowadays, categorizing Italophone migrant writers is a very difficult task because they are heterogeneous when compared to migrant writers in France or England, whose place of origin is mostly these countries’ former colonies. In Italy, they are: Romanians, Somali, Tunisians, Moroccans, Albanians, Iranians, Russians, Brazilians, Togolians and others. As Julio Monteiro Martins, a Brazilian writer, explains:\n\nKomba-Ebri Imbarazzismi\n\nIgiaba Scego Salsicce and Rhoda\n\n13Igiaba Scego came to the attention of the public in 2003 when she won the Eks&Tra prize in 2003 for her short story “Salsicce”. The story is relatively simple: on a warm day in August in Rome, a young woman, an alter ego of Igiaba, decides to go the local butcher’s and buy a couple of salsicce, sausages. Nothing too strange except for the fact that our gentle buyer is Italian but also Muslim: “The strangeness was not in the bought object but in the subject, the buyer. Me, myself. I. I am a Sunni Muslim” (Scego, 2005, 24). Her action is compelled not so much by the curiosity of trying something prohibited in her own religion and common for Italians as the desire to sample something that will make her belong to her own country. She asks herself, first of all, how to cook the sausages and then: “If I eat these sausages, one by one, will people understand that I am Italian as they are?” (Scego, 2005, 26). Monica Hanna has written that “food and eating are tropes often related to notions of cultural incorporation, access, and integration. It is significant that the narrator cannot bring herself to ingest the sausages that she believes will prove her repudiation of her Muslim and Somali identities in favor of an Italian one. She refuses to accept a simple assimilation requiring negotiation” (Hanna, 2004). The salsicce are a challenge to define her position in the country and her role as a different kind of citizen. She writes:\n\nThe anxiety I am feeling comes from the Bossi-Fini and the fact all the extracomunitari will be fingerprinted. And what should be my role? Would I be an extracomunitaria, a potential crime perpetrator whose fingerprints the Italian state would take in order to prevent a crime not yet committed (but supposed to be perpetrated sooner or later)? Or an Italian to whom the state given the benefit of the doubt even if I might have been a previous offender and a habitual criminal? Italy or Somalia? Doubt. Fingerprints or no fingerprints? Terrible doubt. (Scego, 2005, 26)\n\n14Igiaba will try to force herself to eat the sausages, a cultural trope on Italian food, but vomits them because “she struggles with restrictions and categorizations . . . she identifies not only as a racialized Black woman, but also as an Italian, as a migrant, and as a member of a larger group affected by racism” (Hanna, 2004, 75). Her story is very powerful and challenges the preconceived message the Bossi-Fini law gave Italian society. What does it means to be Italian today? How is Italian identity challenged by the law? How does the law impose what a person is or is not? Igiaba does not fit in but she feels she belongs to both of her countries. She therefore makes a long list of what defines her: she feels Somali when she drinks cardamom tea and cinnamon, when she prays five times a day towards Mecca, when she puts on her dirah, etc. At the same time she feels Italian when she eats sweets for breakfast, when she visits museums, monuments and exhibitions, when she talks with her friends about sex, men and depression, when she watches movies with Marcello Mastroianni, and other Italian actors, and more. Igiaba (both fictional and real) is an Italian citizen who feels betrayed by her own state and decides to define herself with her own words, rejecting the definition given by law.\n\nwas well integrated. She tried to understand people. She talked with them, she discussed with them and sometimes she fought with them. But she never ceased to look for a comparison. She tried to understand their culture and she explained hers with sweet and precise words. She was always at the center of a constant exchange. My aunt and I didn’t even try to make an effort. We were not as integrated as she was. (Scego, 2004, 119)\n\n16The decision not to integrate and the choice of becoming a marginal, a prostitute, leads to exclusion from Italian society. Unable to accept her cultural and sexual difference (she remarks numerous times that she is not a lesbian, “that horrible word” [Scego, 2005, 163]), she prefers self-annihilation in prostitution because, like a Pirandello character, she can become one or a thousand Rhodas in a complex multiplication of identities; without having to choose one, she can become simply nobody. When she discovers that she is sick with AIDS, she asks for her aunt’s help to move back to Mogadishu in order to spend the time she has left with her family in her own country.\n\n17What is unique in Scego’s novel is that each chapter in the book is subdivided into small chapters, each of them named after the character narrating his or her own history. This is a particularly important narrative strategy because it enables the voices of all characters to be read and to be heard, especially the mysterious voice of Rhoda, the enigmatic character around whom all the action revolves. Four polyphonic voices (Barni, Aisha, a young man named Pino who fell in love first with Rhoda and then with Aisha, and Rhoda herself) narrate together Rhoda’s actions, her life and their own. The reader knows from the beginning that Rhoda has already passed away, not because of her illness but through the dreadful violence of a group of criminals in Mogadishu. But she is still present as a ghost voice, the haunted who becomes the haunter for those still living, the key to their lives and destiny. All the characters are constantly questioning themselves about the choices Rhoda made in her life, trying to solve the mystery of her departure. Searching for Rhoda is synonym of the quest for a social, national and personal identity, but it won’t elucidate Rhoda’s decisions. She left a void, which needs to be filled with words, even if they are not hers. This challenge resonates in all Scego’s works: she writes with a certain irony about the struggle for identity in “Salsicce” and in Rhoda she is critical of gender and ethnic roles. Language in the novel becomes the site of a power struggle, where migrants, and especially women, strive to find their voices. First of all Italian, the language of the host country. Barni went to Italian schools in Mogadishu and was very good in her Italian class. But when she emigrated to Italy,\n\nbecause she kept hearing all the time “you blacks, don’t know how to speak Italian”, Barni ended up to believe it. Dante, Ariosto and Leopardi abandoned her and their place was taken by awfully conjugated verbs. Everything in her language became approximate and confused. And she ended up becoming that stereotype of the immigrant woman which society (or, even better, the media) wanted to see in her. (Scego, 2005, 156).\n\n18Language becomes the battleground where roles need to be overturned. Aisha, Rhoda’s sister, is the positive agent of change in Scego’s novel: she chooses to talk, to explain and to speak, while she explains to Rhoda: “Sister, if Italians do not understand us, we have to explain to them who we are, what we do and where we go. We have to let them know our dreams, our expectations. We have to talk about our past, we have to include them in our future and we have to let them share our present” (Scego, 2005, 73). This discourse strategy is fundamental to counterbalance narratives coming from the media, from the state and from Italian society, it obliges all the characters involved to open up a dialogue and to work on the issue. Scego’s novel accomplish to portray different points of view on what integration is and provides the Italian public with the migrants’ point of view on the issue, something they are not aware of.\n\nConclusions\n\n19Both writers are able to challenge the media’s discourse and the text of the laws describing them as objects, quotas but not as subjects. Literature becomes here “the signifier of cultural hybridization contained in weaker texts that reject policies and politics of exclusion” (Parati, 2005, 57). Through writing and through their personal voices, they become active agents of (multi)cultural change through literature, a cognitive system informed by power relationships where the struggle for a new rhetoric of hospitality can be carried out. Language be it from the media or from a novel is never neutral. We have to remember how important language was for the Greeks in order to define who was a stranger. The xenos, the stranger, was someone coming from outside the polis but close to Greek culture, while the barbaros was the person culturally from outside Greece not speaking the language. The stranger was not an enemy, as the rights of all xenoi were granted under the right to absolute hospitality offered by Zeus, the father of all gods. In modern societies the meaning of the word has changed and now carries a negative charge, as migrants are treated as strangers. The word hostis, instead of indicating someone coming from outside who was treated with equal rights, become the hostile, and hospitality was expressed by derivatives of the word hospes. Today this term signifies both the person who is hosting and the person hosted. For French linguist Emile Benveniste,\n\nA hostis is not a stranger in general. In contrast with the peregrinus, who lived outside the boundaries of the territory, hostis is “the stranger in so far as he is recognized as enjoying equal rights to those of the Roman citizen. This recognition of rights implies a certain relation of reciprocity and supposes an agreement or compact. Not all non-Romans are called hostis. A bond of equality and reciprocity is established between this particular stranger and the citizens of Rome, a fact which may lead to a precise notion of hospitality. (1973, 77)\n\n20Hospes is a double-edged word used in all Latin languages (in Italian ospite, in French hôte, in Spanish huésped) that signifies both the host and the guest, while in Germanic languages there are two distinct words to indicate the person who offers hospitality and the one who receives it. The root of the word used in English and German comes from the Gothic stem Ghast, the guest (the German Gast and Gast-geber and the English host and guest). As Benveniste explains, the semantic drift occurred when Rome was transformed from a civitas into a powerful nation:\n\nWhen an ancient society becomes a nation, the relations between man and man, clan and clan, are abolished. All that persists is the distinction between what is inside and outside the civitas. By a development of which we do not know the exact conditions, the word hostis assumes a “hostile” flavor and henceforward it is only applied to the “enemy”. As a consequence, the notion of hospitality was expressed by a different term in which the ancient hostis nevertheless persists, but in a composition with *pot(i)s: this is hospes <*hostipe/ot-s. (Benveniste, 1973, 78)\n\n21These paradoxes lie at the heart of the concept of hospitality because the hospes, the guest and the host, is at the same time hostis, but always in the condition of becoming a stranger, a wayfarer in need of hospitality. Derrida is the thinker who actively put his thoughts against the rhetoric of the state into practice, taking side with the sans-papiers against the French government and the Debré-Pasqua legislation, which transformed migrants and anyone who offered them hospitality into criminals to be punished by the law. In De l’hospitalité, Derrida makes the distinction between an absolute law of hospitality and a conditional one:\n\n22There is an antinomy at the heart of the concept of hospitality, he declares:\n\nThe antinomy of hospitality irreconcilably opposes The law, in its universal singularity, to a plurality that is not only a dispersal (laws in the plural), but a structured multiplicity, determined by a process of division and differentiation: by a number of laws that distribute their history and their anthropological geography differently. (2000, 78)\n\n23This tension makes us aware that hospitality is an absolute which perhaps can never be perfectly achieved but can become a practice in our society. Literature can become the site where it is produced and discussed because, as Valeria Pompejano points out, “hospitality produces the continuous redefinition of a discourse in which cultural elements are constantly put though an incessant process of re-conjugation within the stimuli of actuality” (2004, 9).\n\n24Derrida named a part of his seminar on hospitality “Pas d’hospitalité”. In French pas can be a step, a movement towards hospitality, towards the other, or it can be a negation, a denial, as in “no hospitality”. We can’t decide what his phrase really means because it is un-grammatical. We are faced with the opacity of language and thought and can’t decide what it can express. It is this pas that constricts us in our dual conception of hospitality that is always confined and expressed in language. To think about hospitality and how it is produced, can make us aware of the limitations of our representation of the Other and how this is negotiated by the media, the law and fiction writing. As Iain Chambers noted in a passage which I quote in its entirety,\n\nWhen the imaginary of the West no longer lies elsewhere, at the edges of the map, in the margins of history, culture, knowledge and aesthetics, but migrates from the periphery to take up its home in the contemporary metropolis, then our story, the language we inhabit, implodes under the pressure of these new and urgent coordinates. . . . But if, as Benjamin and Heidegger insisted, we dwell in language and its limits are the limits of our world, then to meet others within its fabric, is to stretch it, double it, interrogate and remake it. It leads to a highly charged practice when we encounter diverse worlds, histories, cultures and experiences within an apparent communality. It is a meeting, a putting yourself on the line, that is invariably accompanied by uncertainty and fear. . . . It is perhaps also necessary to acquire the habits of listening: to open our language, our domesticating principles to the unforeseen consequences of conversation, dialogue, even incomprehension. This may merely serve to register the unequal distribution of economic, cultural, and symbolic powers. Yet in signifying limits we already expose ourselves to the possibility of an opening. For we are thrown into that ambiguous space in which differences are permitted a hearing, in which both speakers and the syntax of conversation run the risk of modification. (Chambers, 1994, 29-31)\n\n25It is in this search for dialogue that the concept of hospitality expressed through literary discourse can help us understand the world and the migrant in a different way, on perhaps on more uncertain foundations, while encouraging us to listen to the hospes knocking at the door—not because he or she will arrive in the future, but because they are already here, in our homes."
