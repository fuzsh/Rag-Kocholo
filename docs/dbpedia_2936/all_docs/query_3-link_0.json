        "text": "1997 American film\n\nThe Toilers and the WayfarersDirected byKeith FroelichWritten byKeith FroelichProduced byKeith FroelichCinematographyJames Frank TittleEdited byKeith FroelichMusic byChan PolingDistributed byCMV Laservision\n\nRelease date\n\nCountryUnited StatesLanguagesEnglish\n\nGerman\n\nThe Toilers and the Wayfarers is a 1997 LGBT dramatic film written and directed by Keith Froelich. It was released on 14 March 1997.\n\nThe film is set and filmed in New Ulm, in southern Minnesota.\n\nPhillip and Dieter nearly suffocate hiding their gay sexual identity in the face of puritanical small town Midwestern U.S. values. Joined by a mysterious German relative, the three misfits escape to the big city searching for a place to belong.\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of Dieter, a 16 year old German boy who lives in USA. Dieter's childhood friend, Phillip, is gay and has feelings for him. One day while having a play fight on the side of a creek, Phillip kisses Dieter. Dieter responds by being disgusted and runs away, which makes Phillip leave town heartbroken. In the meantime, Udo moves from Germany to USA to live with his aunt Anna. Udo and Dieter become friends, to the dismay of Dieter's parents. Udo is shown to be a lazy bum, upsetting his aunt and the neighbours alike. When aunt Anna dies, Udo quits his job and buys a stolen car with the inherited money. Udo wants to take Dieter on a trip in his new car, but Dieter's father intervenes. Mad at Udo and thinking that the two boys are too close, he forbids Dieter from seeing him and spanks the boy. Later, we see Dieter at Udo's house hiding from his conservative family. The two boys decide to embark on a trip to the big city, however as soon as they get there police takes notice of their car. Udo and Dieter end up on foot and decide to only speak English so as to not spark interest among city people. They manage to get another cheap car but it breaks down soon. The mechanic is a nice man who speaks German and takes a liking to the boys, as he wasn't allowed to speak his native language in school and as he has no children of his own. While in the city Dieter find Phillip in a cafe and realises how much he missed him. Phillip is happy to see his friend and shows Dieter the perks of a big town, together with the place where he lives. Dieter is shocked to find out that Phillip prostitutes himself to obtain money, even though Phillip seems content with this and even suggests to Dieter that he could try to as well and stay with him in the city. The boys spend days together and the old flame between them reappears, this time Dieter accepting his feelings for Phillip. Later we see Phillip sick and Dieter on the street searching for clients. Unbeknownst to him, a police officer offers him money in exchange for services and arrests him. At the police station, the lieutenant contacts Dieter's parents who do not want him home. Dieter risks being taken to juvenile prison. He uses his right for a phone call to call Udo and warn him to leave the city before police forces find his address. Udo returns to the kind mechanic whom allows him to live with him and his wife until his life is sorted. Dieter tricks the officers into showing them the address and manages to escape and return to Phillip. The two embrace and make love. On final, Dieter leaves Phillip, who is still sick, and flees to New York. While waiting for his train he meets a stranger who gives him advice to return to his motherland. The two play tables in the train station as the end credits roll.\n\nMatt Klemp as Dieter\n\nRalf Schirg as Udo\n\nAndrew Woodhouse as Phillip\n\nJerome Samuels as Helmut\n\nJoan Wheeler as Anna\n\nMichael Glen as Lt.
