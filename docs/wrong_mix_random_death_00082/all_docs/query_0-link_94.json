        "text": "How to Marry a Viscount, by Alyxandra Harvey. This amazing best friends relationship story, took this romance book to a whole other level. So let me say this. To the beautiful writer who wrote this Unforgettable book. Thank you Ms. Alyxandra Henry for writing a fun and entertaining book.\n\nThere are few great moments in the book that has convinced me to read more of your books. To the readers, I have to tell you that I’m so in love with the lead character Henry. Uh! I just couldn’t get enough of the man. The man just steels all my tingly feelings, wraps them into a bow and gifts them back to me.\n\nI mean it’s the many naughty things that he does to Tamsin that had me panting for air, because he stole that too. If you recall before, I compared a certain Dukes fingers to Fred Astaire’s tap dancing. Lord almighty, this man, Henry is a master with his fingers and his tongue. I can’t forget the tongue yaw. The writer did an intoxicating description of these many scenes.\n\nOh God, I need a drink! The first few pages moved with exciting scenes that captivated my attention. The many battles between the special couple has them banging their heads against the wall. There are moments of action where Henry shows off his special skills in fighting. Tamsin refuses to let Henry have all the fun.\n\nShe uses her remarkable skills of being a brilliant sleuth. I definitely enjoyed the many funny moments in the story, mostly about Tamsin and her artifacts. Never mind about the ghost she consults with, It’s the skull and the doll that got me. Poor Harvey didn’t have a clue of what he was getting himself into, after walking back into Tamsin’s life. I loved the amazing relationship between these two.\n\nFrom the moment the two met, Tamsin takes the reins and races around the streets of London, with poor Henry running after her. Their romance takes up a little later in the book, but when it does these two light the fire in the bedroom and other clandestine places. The many characters that join Tamsin and Henry in their quest for peace, you will love. The two close friends, Priya and Persephone are like two Generals going into battle to protect their friends. They give new meanings to a girls best friend.\n\nWith the dangers that lurks behind each door and or ally, Henry makes it his sole mission to protect his best friend Tamsin. You know there were many times in the book, I questioned Henry in my head. “ I say sir, do you actually believe that you do not have strong feelings for this woman? How many times do you need to be knocked over the head until you realize it? I then continue on with the book.\n\nNot only are there awesome friends in this story, there are sinister people who are always out to do no good. Bring in the meetings at dawn and a doctor on call. I have to ask you this though. How is it possible to have a third in a dual? I guess the real question is, does said person even know that he is the third?\n\nWell anyway, we have vindictive family members and so called fathers causing chaos and havoc all around them. Little do these people know that they have crossed hairs with the most exceptional hero of them all. With her beauty, smart thinking, quick wit and engaging charm, Tamsin fears no one! I give this writer and this book two snaps and a, “Jack get down from that tree before you fall on that man.” “ Never mind.”\n\n“ It’s only Lord Eaton.” “Carry on.” Until next time my fellow readers… read on!\n\nOkaaaaaay I think we’ve all been waiting for this one, right? We’ve caught glimpses of Tamsin and Henry throughout the previous two books and I’ve been so ready to watch this go down! I’ve always been curious about Tamsin given her particular interest and I really wasn’t disappointed by how feisty she is and how she can hold her own.\n\nThe romance between she and Henry? Idiots in love. Literally that exact AO3 kind of tag because I so wanted to screech at them! When they do get there though, it’s so satisfying and very steamy!!\n\nI feel like Tamsin is the most Cinderella of them all given her situation, although her stepsister did pleasantly surprise me and I sighted yet another ship that I can fervently hope for!\n\nThere’s also a bit of a mystery going on which was fun and a wee bit more fast paced than the previous one, there’s also perhaps a little bit of a love interest for Priya?! Which I was super excited about because I NEED a Priya book, however I believe this is the last one in the series? Which makes me sad, although everything’s wrapped up well between the main 3 Cinderella’s and there’s perhaps a set up for a sequel series?!\n\nI have to say, it was pretty satisfying to watch Eaton FINALLY get his comeuppance and there was a nice little surprise in there with it too! Much as I loved Tamsin, this was perhaps not my favourite of the books. It did seem a little rushed in places, and I was hoping for things to be a little more drawn out between Tamsin and Henry given the few interactions between them in the previous two books BUT it was another brilliant book in the series and I had fun with it!\n\nThanks to Dragonblade Publishing for sending me a free e-ARC of this book via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.\n\nI wasn't sure what to rate this book, because objectively, it's probably a three-star read. The writing and plot weren't great, but they also weren't terrible. And to be honest, it's one of the most ridiculous books I've ever read. But in the best possible way, which is why I'm giving it four stars.\n\nThis book follows Tam and Henry, two childhood friends who are madly in love with each other, but refuse to admit it. Tam is dealing with the mystery of why someone is breaking into her house and stealing precious objects, and Henry is trying to avoid his father's men, who are trying to kill him. On top of this, there are a whole host of other side plots.\n\nThis is the third book in a series, and not having read the first two, it did take me a while to figure out who was who - and to be honest, I'm still not entirely sure what the Cinderella Society is. The romance was okay, but since the story starts with the two characters already in love with each other, we don't really get to experience them falling for each other.\n\nThe mystery element definitely had me intrigued, but to be honest, I think the reason I enjoyed this book was just how strange it was. The characters had unique interests, they do ridiculous things to get out of their predicaments, and it was just a lot of fun seeing them go through life.\n\nThis review feels a bit all over the place because, to be honest, I have no concrete reason for why I liked it as much as I did. But in the end, I did end up having a great time with it, and sometimes, that's all that matters.\n\nHow to Marry a Viscount by Alyxandra Harvey is a Regency romance about two people who grew up together. They had been part of a unit, taking care of one another. The Cinderellas, a group of young women, were part of the friendship, as children, and now. Most of them were married now. Tamsin Bell, daughter of the Duke of Chester, lived by herself in a small house that belonged to her father. Her stepmother didn’t really want her at the family home, which was OK by Tamsin. Right now, however, someone was in the house. She had not planned to be home right now, hence the burglar felt safe. She chased him out but discovered Vasilisa was gone. She was a poorly made doll, but she was the only thing left to remind Tamsin of her mother. Henry Talbot, Viscount Stirling, was home after years of being away. He had retired from the navy, prepared to take up his life in England. He had not let the Cinderellas he was home: it had been six days. He was drawn to Tamsin’s house and happened to be there as she chased away the thief. She was thrilled to see him and angry it had been so long. She convinced him to come along to the ball she was going to, as “protection.” He loved her, but he couldn’t keep her safe so he denied that love.\n\nHenry’s father was a piece of work: always sending thugs after him to make him strong. It was ridiculous, and dangerous. There would be danger for Tamsin if the old duke realized how much she meant to Henry. He hated the ball: too loud, too crowded, to much activity. He was glad he was there to protect Tamsin from Lord Eaton, who was a groper and an ass. Tamsin’s father demanded she come to his home for lunch the next day, where he revealed that he had signed a contract for her hand in marriage: Lord Eaton. She told him flat out, “no,” and started planning. The marriage would never take place. Tamsin was a strong and determined woman, as were the other Cinderellas, and there was no doubt she would win. They were excellent characters, perfect for one another. The story was entertaining, especially Tamsin’s exploits. Laugh out loud, sometimes. Henry was just as determined as she to protect her, but not as her husband. It was an entertaining story.\n\nI was invited to read a free e-ARC of How to Marry A Viscount by Dragonblade, through Netgalley. All thoughts and opinions are mine. #Netgalley #Dragonblade #AlyxandraHarvey #HowToMarryAViscount\n\n4 stars\n\nAn entertaining story. I think it would have been useful for me to have read the previous stories in this series. The series is called the Cinderella Society and Tamsin has some aspects of that stort. She has a step mother that has persuaded the father to send Tamsin to a house of her own and a couple of step sisters. The mother's thinking was that Tamsin out shone her own daughters and was making it difficult for them to form matches. The step mother persuades Tamsin's father to marry her off to Lord Eaton, a rake who Tamsin dislikes. Henry, Tamsin's childhood friend returns from the Navy and helps Tamsin after a break in. There's a couple of mysteries and other of Tamsin's friends help out. I didn't solve the mystery which was good as it showsa the theft's weren't obvious. There was a lot of sexual passion with Henry so it's anything but a clean story for those that care about that. I'd be interested in Priya's story and might look out for the earlier ones.\n\nI voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book. All thoughts and opinions are my own.\n\nI received a copy of this from Netgalley and this is my freely given opinion.\n\nThis is book three of the Cinderella Society, and the story has been hinted at in the previous books; this is a friends to lovers/unrequited childhood love story. Tamsin is the daughter of a duke, and a spinster. Because her stepmother barely tolerates her and appears to resent any attention she gets, and her father is neglectful and steered by his wife, Tamsin has been rather neglected and pushed aside, to the extent where she was pushed out of her family home, and is set up in her own residence. She is a society darling, but also has some quirks, such as her belief in ghosts and the paranormal, evidenced in her collection of goods. But she is also a kind hearted romantic and is a spinster because she is in love with her childhood friend, Henry.\n\nCaptain Henry Talbot had recently been saved by the Cinderellas when framed for treason, and instead is now known as a war hero. He had spent years away with the navy to escape his psychotic father who was abusive towards him as a child and now continues to test Henry by sending villains to attack him. He loves Tamsin as well, but hides this as he is fearful that his father's twisted attentions would put her in danger.\n\nHowever, danger dodges Tamsin in other ways, including her being a target of a thief, and her father arranging a terrible match for her with the hated Lord Eaton, the same Earl that has caused trouble for the Cinderella's before.\n\nTamsin and Henry team up to solve the mystery of the thefts, with the help of some of their fellow Cinderella's, and other friends, and to save her from the attentions of the hated Eaton, they marry. Henry is still fearful of her being hurt by his father, and hides the depth of his love, but they are able to at least indulge in some of their desire for each other.\n\nThis is a bit angsty, but I love the story of their childhood love for each other, and how that grew as they grew. I also love the reappearance of some of the other Cinderellas and how they support and love each other too. It is such a contrast, their made up family and how they love and support each other, versus the dysfunction of some of the real family relationships. On saying that, I do like the hint that perhaps Tamsin's half sister Carnation, may be a Cinderella in the making as well, and am curious about the story of Priya and her history and what is in story for her.\n\nIn general, a very enjoyable addition to the series.\n\n3.75 stars out of 5\n\nI received an Advance Reader Copy from the publisher, via NetGalley. This in no way impacted on my view.\n\nLady Tamsin Bell may be the daughter of a Duke, but following her mother's death and father's remarriage, her father doesn't care about her any more. She's had the freedom to live how she wants for a long time now, but the one thing she wants, the one person she loves, is out of her reach. Captain Henry Talbot may no longer be accused of treason, but he still feels he's not good enough for the vibrant Lady Tamsin. Even so, he will do whatever it takes to keep her safe, and when he home is broken into, and her stepmother proclaims she will be marrying a notorious creep by the end of the week, Henry can't allow that to happen.\n\nAfter seeing both Tamsin and Henry in the previous books, it's always been clear the two were made for each other. Their story was bound to be feisty and chaotic, and I was not disappointed by How to Marry a Viscount. There's intrigue, and love, and romance, and friendship, all bound together by a wonderful cast of characters - both old and new. I was hooked by the story of the missing artefacts, and to see the wicked earl hopefully get his comeuppance. This was a great ending to the series, and though I haven't read any of Alyxandra's series, I'm looking forward to her next historical romance!"
