        "text": "A distinction between an earlier and later Charles Taylor might split between Charles Taylor the political activist versus Charles Taylor the intellectual.[1] Certainly the nature of the writing going on in a political tract like The Pattern of Politics (1970) is at removes from intellectual forays into the malaise of modernity or to the crisis of the self and identify. I won’t attempt to square what an earlier Taylor says with a later Taylor.\n\nBut Taylor’s politics were local enough in the 1960s to make a book he wrote during that time pertinent to what I want to say about The Trotsky, a film shot entirely in Montreal and engaged in its own way with “radical” Canadian politics. I do not seek to apply a Taylorian reading to the film than to suggest that the film itself is a reading of this particular political text of Taylor’s—that the movie ingests and thereby depicts some of its most pertinent lessons.\n\nSo even if a later Taylor does not square with an earlier Taylor, what The Trotsky attempts is to make something like the politics of polarization matter once again, which is to say it attempts to reclaim some of the lessons put forward in The Pattern of Politics. One could also say this film attempts to reclaim the dialectic, in particular the notion which holds conflict between clearly opposing viewpoints as the lynchpin of social change. How the film reinterprets the dialectic will be considered here.\n\nThe premise of the film, that a Montreal teenager, Leon Bronstein (Jay Baruchel), believes himself to be the living embodiment of Leon Trotsky reincarnated suggests it is not beyond the pale to think about things like having another’s soul occupy one’s body, and from there, to consider whether the ontological reality of film facilitates a discussion of reincarnation (another’s soul trapped in a body eerily present to us) or rather, something like the reverse (a different body occupying another’s soul).\n\nI raise these examples in consideration of the ontological differences between what Cavell calls, simply, the “actor” (stage actor) and the “performer” (screen actor).\n\nThe [stage] actor’s role is his subject for study, and there is no end to it. But the screen performer is essentially not an actor at all: he is the subject of study, and a study not his own. (That is what the content of a photograph is—its subject.) On a screen the study is projected; on a stage the actor is the projector. An exemplary stage performance is one which, for a time, most fully creates a character. After Paul Scofield’s performance in King Lear, we know who King Lear is, we have seen him in the flesh.\n\nAn exemplary screen performance is one in which, at a time, a star is born. After The Maltese Falcon, we know a new star, only distantly a person. “Bogart” means “the figure created in a given set of films.” His presence in those films is who he is, not merely in the sense in which a photograph of an event is that event; but in the sense that if those films did not exist, Bogart would not exist, the name “Bogart” would not mean what it does. (28)\n\nIf it’s true that an actor on screen, when he plays a character, imbues that character with something of his persona, so that there is no Rambo, say, without Sylvester Stallone, and, subsequently, no role for Sylvester Stallone to play without invoking or imbibing a bit of Rambo in it, then the creation of a film star means the creation of a persona, which functions something like a sign, with its own cluster of clues and associations.\n\nThe individuality of the screen actor is either lost or heightened, depending on how you view things. Lost in that there is no appearance or presence the actor can (now or ever) have without calling to mind the medium he works in. Heightened in that something of what he is is (fundamentally) more open to the senses; the screen actor is more transparent to us, which, also, can be a way of cloaking things. But sometimes, once we appear on screen, just as once we utter language, we are committed persons.\n\n(To rehash ground already travailed by Cavell, let me say that theatre actor, say, Ian McKellen, does not transfigure who we understand Richard III to be. McKellen interprets the character; another could interpret differently, but we imagine the character, Richard III, to be a stable entity. But the screen actor does not interpret his role. He inhabits it so there is no role without the actor. Conventionally speaking, one does not “interpret” Rambo.)\n\nIt is not unwise to suppose that a film director is aware of his inheritance in the actors and actresses he has sovereignty over, particularly Jacob Tierney, a man well versed in the histrionics of what we might nowadays call 1960s (Canadian) “counterculture,” auteuring a film explicitly aimed at the youth of Canada.\n\nWhether or not Pierre Trudeau is a galvanizing figure for today’s youth or not, those who are curious to know him are likely to know him through Colm Fiore. I don’t mean that Fiore’s persona trumps Trudeau’s. Indeed, Fiore interprets Trudeau the way a stage actor interprets a character; he does not invent him; others will come along with different interpretations. But for a generation at least (or for a generation of Canadian youth interested in 1960s Canadian counterculture), and perhaps simply by appearing to us as Trudeau on screen, Fiore’s persona will invoke or be caught up with Trudeau (though not vice versa). Fiore is, in a sense, a reincarnation of Trudeau.\n\nIn casting Fiore as a rather ineffective (mostly comedic) villain in The Trotsky, I believe Jacob Tierney is offering a critique of Trudeau in this film, so a critique of the Liberal brand of consensus-politics that undercuts the rough and tumble world of adversarial intellectual pursuit—known (and derided) most famously as that darling artifice beloved (not solely) by Marxists: the dialectic. I am not exactly saying that this movie redeems the intellectual worth of this historical trope (which has largely gone out of favour). Perhaps it begs the (philosophical) question of where exactly its worth (if any) lies: in the affirmative declaration of philosophical strength or the passive acceptance of forces (precisely) out of our control. I will come back to this.\n\nWe can begin, in good form, by looking more closely at the character played by Colm Fiore, who I believe acts as an inheritance for Jacob Tierney, bringing with him a cultural currency that could be put to good use considering the manner of film Tierney is making. The question then is, does Tierney, in fact, put this inheritance to good (or any) use? Is he aware that he has cast a version of Trudeau in his film?\n\nAppealing to “vulgar” intentionality stifles aesthetic criticism so even if you (or Tierney) answers no, I am going to argue that Tierney, at the very least, forces us to consider what type of leader Trudeau is and then, not by presenting Colm Fiore in this film as a version of what Charles Taylor calls Trudeau in his book (i.e., the NYL, or “New Young Leader”), but by presenting another version of the NYL in Leon Bronstein—say a polar opposite version to Trudeau, one who is more genuinely what we expect an NYL to be, beyond the (mere) image.\n\nFirst, here is Charles Taylor’s critique of Trudeaumania:\n\nThe vast literature of Trudeaumania is mainly concerned with the surface changes which are easily accomplished and easily identified. It focuses almost narcissistically on the dramatic shifts in image which accompany the rise of a new star … One of the main roles of this new leader is to represent or “personify” something. Trudeau stands for all the changes of contemporary Canada represented by a certain group of people: the young, successful innovators of the post-war era …\n\nDiefenbaker provides the archetype in many people’s minds of the old-style politician who is attuned to yesterday’s issues and uses a rhetoric which has no meaning to the urban young. But Diefenbaker is only one kind of old-style political figure. There is another type of politician who is also thought to be obsolete. This is the wheeler-dealer … the consensus-maker who operates, by means of ambiguous statements and compromises to avoid offending the largest number of people possible. Politicians like [the consensus maker] are thought to specialize in the skilled parliamentary answer, which, while seeming to address itself to the question, really says nothing. Their past-mastery of the policy of minimum action somehow answers the cry for movement but actually leaves as much as possible undisturbed. Lately, these political arts have fallen almost entirely into disrepute. The young believe this way of operating is a formula for lack of action.\n\nAgainst this the NYL – the New Young Leader – is said to be attuned and responsive to the issues which preoccupy young urban dwellers. He is said to have the courage to dispense with the double-talk and circumlocution of the Old Guard who, as Harbron says, “couch every public statement and every private thought in cautious verbiage.”\n\nAll this may have little relation to reality, but it is the myth rather than the reality of the NYL that we are examining here; and this myth firmly rests on the consensus view of politics. Those who promote the NYL make up the highly successful new élite. Harbron’s “lawyers, professors, businessmen, some of Ottawa’s junior bureaucrats” are not at all at odds with the structure of our society. What they look for in the NYL is the crystallization and expression of a consensus.\n\nThis is why his goals must remain without real content. He expresses “changes,” “innovation at our highest political level,” everything except a clear program of reform, which he contemptuously dismisses as “old fashion promises.” But this is more than mere equivocation, because the role of the leader is to remain flexible and pragmatic, to respond to the problems as they arise. To do this, the embodiment of the supposed new technological élite must be an exponent of the main thesis of consensus politics: that politics is the domain of problems and solutions, and not of the confrontation of fundamental opinions. He must embody the end of ideology.\n\nWhat is wrong with the old wheeler-dealer is not that he creates a consensus with his careful schemes and hedgings, but rather that he is an ineffective agent of it. He is “hung up” on the consensus-making problems of yesteryear, so that he can neither see clearly the problems of today nor grasp the imaginative solutions which are needed. He suffers from taboos and inhibitions which may have been politic in the past but which have become obstacles today. He is, therefore, carefully soothing the susceptibilities of an aging and declining constituency instead of appealing to a new and growing one.\n\nAt the same time, if the NYL is courageous in eschewing the language of equivocation, he speaks out not to break the consensus but to present more effectively the goals that are hidden in the gobbledygook of the traditional politician or bureaucrat. In short, the NYL is supposed to be discovering and articulating the demands of the society. He “personifies all the exciting changes in our society.” But does he?\n\nFrom the standpoint of a politics of polarization, this kind of reasoning is utter nonsense. What is totally missing in the argument is any inkling that there are important and fundamental structural conflicts in our society which make any claim to consensus specious. It is impossible for one person to represent the demands of the whole. (6-8)\n\nNow obviously Colm Fiore’s character (Henry Berkhoff) in The Trotsky is not a version of the NYL, not meant to be nor to recall the image of Pierre Trudeau (Colm Fiore’s persona aside). What Henry Berkhoff is meant to convey is certainly something of the “old-style political figure,” if not exactly a “wheeler-dealer,” then certainly someone who is out of touch with the youth, employing old style remedies to curb (what he perceives to be) age-old problems.\n\nHe sics his “demonic concubine” Ms. Davis on students on day one of classes; her old school British-marm-accent is over the top and complements the rather arbitrary and quaint charges she levels at students. Muddy shoes and no-shirt-tuck seem to be offenses taken from a bygone era. Harping on piercings is a bit more fitting, if somewhat clichéd. But if clichés involve a lack of imagination, then clichéd speech and acts are in order here because what Tierney is trying to get across is precisely the blandness of bureaucracy, the lack of confrontation.\n\nHenry Berkhoff doesn’t have a vision of what he wants his school to be. Instead, he operates (as he sees it) in a vacuum between boredom and apathy. The reason he denies that the problem with youth today could be one of boredom (favouring instead the interpretation of apathy) is because if this were so, the onus would be on him to conjure up or conceive of a vision that would pull students out of boredom. Whereas the “fight” against apathy is not a fight at all, not confrontational. Nothing is at stake.\n\nBerkhoff is able to implement a supposed program of discipline and punishment not by virtue of his (or Ms. Davis’s) iron will but because, for students, there is no alternative. Leon refers to them both as “fascists,” which may simply allude to the fact that all Berkhoff does is offer up the same prescriptive dogma from a time gone by. He is more a disciplinary relic than an adversarial man. He himself does not inspire conflict, the sort required for real change to happen. Only Leon Bronstein does this.\n\nListen to Berkhoff’s hackneyed phrasings as he admonishes Leon for his display of solidarity with Skip:\n\nThis has been a troubled arts school for many years now. Pot, sex, graffiti, piercings. You see what I’m getting at? I am here to discipline the students, usher in a new era of responsibility and obligation to this place. Now you can certainly make that harder for me. Heck, you already have. But you won’t stop me. So the choice is yours. You can spend your final year of high school in a war you can’t win against a man who’s lived far longer and knows far more than you. Or you can just float by and wreak havoc next year on someone’s poor unsuspecting university. What’s it going to be?\n\nTo which Leon replies: “I think the choice is obvious.” If this sounds confrontational, it is because Leon has made confrontation his prerogative. Berkhoff is happy to let things just “float by.” According to Taylor, it is not by virtue of (differing) philosophies that we distinguish the old-style wheeler dealer from the NYL, but by virtue of effectiveness. That is, the NYL is simply the better consensus maker, more in tune with the “correct” forces in society to be placated. Placation, however, like the old-style politician, is still his prerogative. So Colm Fiore in this movie is not Pierre Trudeau personified (i.e. “persona”-fied), but something like Pierre Trudeau exposed. That is, both Trudeau and Berkhoff came into power on the promise of radical change; both offer up instead “the same old shit.”[2]\n\nSo in what way is Leon Bronstein a more genuine NYL? In one sense he isn’t an NYL at all. Taylor uses the term pejoratively; part of what makes a NYL is precisely his disingenuousness. A “genuine” NYL is a contradiction in terms, one that couches political measures or manoeuvres designed to maintain the status quo in the guise of supposedly radical change.\n\nBut no one in this film is offering radical change except Leon Bronstein, and he certainly does not couch his feelings. (Berkhoff is not a radical, hence no need for couching.) As far as the political landscape depicted in the film goes, the liberal consensus-maker is squeezed out. If the film is indeed a critique of so-called “consensus-politics,” it is so by virtue of omission because no character in the film actually embodies the ethos of the liberal politician. The value of such omission is that is allows polarization to happen, to have the stakes presented (clearly) as well as the possibility of choice.\n\nHow to make the case then that the film offers a critique of a character it does not even depict? One way might be to say that the liberal consensus model of politics, however effective (or ineffective), is certainly not the stuff of drama—that conflict (necessarily) is. Posing the question this way is an indirect way of critiquing the liberal brand of consensus politics, particularly if one expects the stuff of politics to be dramatic—that is, to involve real stakes. So why should conflict work so well on film but not in life?[3]\n\nThere are obvious psychological reasons, like the fact that when watching film, we are absent from the conflict whereas in life, the possibility of being harmed – physically, psychically – is prevalent. But effective consensus politics is more than simply a means of papering over the treacheries of real life. The need to believe is pertinent—that is, must be exploited by the liberal politician. This is what Taylor reminds us the “cult of the NYL” taps in to—the people’s “yearning to be in contact with something meaningful” (112), and then, their desire to participate in the structures surrounding this so-called “significant reality,” principally through the act of voting (113).\n\nHere are two ways Leon Bronstein breaks with the traditional model of the NYL. First, Leon himself does not seek out connection with a significant reality. He already knows he is the reincarnation of Leon Trotsky. The movie does not depict him claiming, or even doubting/disinheriting this inheritance, but merely the consequences of his knowing. This is a significant departure from the traditional model of the NYL who himself does not believe in anything. He may mediate a connection to some higher reality, but he takes no trouble to articulate what this reality consists of; whereas Leon Bronstein’s point of departure is precisely his belief.\n\nNor is it is not true that Leon wins others to his cause. In fact, the film’s final conversion of Leon’s fellow school mates is not initiated by Leon, but by Tony, his chief lieutenant. Attempting to convince a sceptical gathering of fellow students that it is in their best interest to express solidarity with Leon, Tony does not berate them with dogma; he merely forces them to face the abyss and then to choose. If Leon and Tony eventually inspire others to believe in the meaningfulness of another reality, it is not because they has given them the tenets of Marxism to behold, but because the students become convinced of the value (either banally or profoundly) of a voice—symbolized in this film with the achievement of a Union, i.e., a political mechanism that allows students to have a say in the day-to-day running of affairs that should concern them. So only someone clear in his/her own convictions (Tony too is admirably clear in his desire simply to prove Berkhoff wrong) can pave the way for conviction in others—not conviction to take up another’s cause, but to participate and to speak out for oneself.\n\nSecond, I take it of utmost significance that the film does not portray the act of voting and is selective in its commentary on what sorts of rebellion are in order, which is to present other means of claiming oneself and one’s community. The film does depict the signing of a petition, which proves ineffective; also, a school walk-out, equivalent perhaps to a strike, which also peters out.\n\nIs Tierney commenting on the effectiveness of petitions and strikes by showing us their futility in this film? Does this mean we should forgo petitions and strikes to achieve the change we want? This film is saying that rebellion, or acts of rebellion, can also be standardized, can become clichéd, hence rendered ineffective. Simply to take up a ready-made remedy is not an effective means for change; what is required is the conviction behind the remedy so that standing up in acts of defiance is not a political act with any meaning unless accompanied by convictions. And the best way to prove one’s convictions, to avoid the blasé rebellion that comes with staged political acts would be to take up more arresting measures, as though there is no reason to be taken seriously otherwise, which means we have no voice otherwise. This is dangerous territory, particularly when one begins taking hostages (i.e., breaking the law) in the name of one’s convictions.[4]\n\nThe dramatic hostage-taking of Berkhoff, accompanied by frenzied text-messaging to get students to rally in solidarity with Bronstein’s crazy act of defiance – and then, in spur-of-the-moment fashion – not only says something about the value of improvisation but also, about the types of rebellion that are, perhaps not in order, but (now?) necessary.\n\nI turn now to a consideration of the dialectic, and how I take this film to inherit and transfigure what is meant by the term. Leon provides a brief aside (to Alexandra) on how he views the “Great Dialectic,” or “the Grand Narrative,”[5] before going on to paraphrase Eagleton’s distinction between moral and moralistic thinking.[6]\n\nThe dialectic must “breathe” in the new century, he says, “by allowing for things which Karl Marx, frankly, had no opinion on.” This is less a disinheritance of Marxism than a reminder that Marx cannot save us, that the rational application or understanding of his theories is not now what is lacking. Indeed, rather than provide heavy handed pedagogic interpretation of how Leon understands the functioning of the dialectic, the film, marvellously, depicts it—that is, allows us to see it, in the form of cue cards pinned up on Leon’s wall.\n\nTHE “GRAND NARRATIVE” OF LEON’S LIFE APPEARS TO US SANS HUMAINS.\n\nTHE CAMERA BEGINS ITS VERTICAL PAN.\n\nTHE DIALECTIC PASSES …\n\n… BEFORE OUR EYES.\n\nThe content of the cards is less the remarkable feature than the fact that Leon Bronstein has the gumption, or feels required to, detail and display his convictions if not for all to see then, at the very least, for himself. How are we to interpret this display?\n\nOne way would be to say that just because everything is all clear in the mind of Leon Bronstein, it is merely a matter of convenience or formality for him to make his inner thoughts and aspirations outer, that without the cue cards Leon would be no less confident of the trajectory of his life. But another interpretation would be that the cards act as cover for the possibility that he is still capable of losing his way or his thread, so despite giving himself over to the “Grand Narrative,” some type of existential dread compels him to compose reminders and to detail checkpoints. Do these cards act as a symbol of his faith or his lack of faith? Are we to believe, as Leon seems to, that his fate is hermetically sealed, or is there room, indeed, for improvisation (even too much improvisation)?\n\nThere is certainly ample evidence that Leon feels the dialectic of his life could go awry, most notably the two dream sequences—the first in which he is cut loose by his mother and father, the second, by his ostensible surrogates, Frank McGovern (his mentor/attorney) and Alexandra, his desired object of affection. That Leon appears unchanged, as a baby, in both, suggests that he feels no less vulnerable with his new found family than his old one.\n\nThe fear is of betrayal certainly, but what Leon fears is that he has not the will nor ability nor voice to transform his new found family, that they will, instead, regress to reoccupy tired moralistic roles and positions of a time gone by. In such a case, having failed in his mission to convert them, Leon will most definitely feel cut loose, as though he is the weak link in the chain of events that is supposed to happen (which then, of course, doesn’t—all thanks to him). These dream sequences remind us that Leon is a free individual.\n\nYet this sense of simultaneous belief and non-belief is one source of anguish and frustration with the dialectic for some because being certain of the ends but wary of the means ought to put the ends in question to begin with. The dogmatic refusal to do so is what others find frustrating.[7]\n\nThis is what Alexandra feels when she levels her brutal charge against Leon, that he feels things because he thinks he’s supposed to. But it is also true that Leon manages to seduce her by feeling precisely the way he does and certainly not by manipulating Alexandra, but by being about as open and honest about his intentions as anyone possibly could be.\n\nAlexandra is not worried that she is being taken for a ride but that Leon is taking himself for a ride, playing out a mere fantasy in which she happens to be entwined. But to claim one’s desire is necessarily to act out a sort of fantasy, and a union of souls is a union of fantasies, hence a discovery of fantasies—an other’s and one’s own.\n\nHow or what mediates these fantasies is always difficult to know beforehand. It would be far more sinister if Leon held his beliefs close to his chest, or was simply unaware of them, instead playing out the game of seduction in more conventional fashion without first being honest with himself.\n\nBut this arguably describes the dialectic of most romantic pursuits. What is exceptional about Leon is that he has already discovered his fantasy; he is begging Alexandra to consider what hers is and whether it is compatible with his. What he offers her is the power to choose (too directly some might say), but in the end, in this case anyhow, it works (not for Leon and Alexandra, I mean, but for us).\n\nSo what (exactly) is our source of attraction to the Trotsky? Is it because he has all the answers? Hardly. Even Leon has the temerity to doubt his own conclusions. Is it because he doubts? The most immediate reason to me is because he dares to infuse the otherwise rational functioning of the dialectic with romance, which may make him less authoritative in some people’s eyes, but certainly more human in our eyes. That is, he demands that the dialectic act first and foremost in accordance with, or in response to, his feeling and intuition. This infusion of romance is key to this film’s interpretation of the dialectic, particularly in lieu of the following commentary on Hegel by Professor Dart:\n\nHegel highlighted that the Enlightenment tradition was superior to the Classical tradition, but the Enlightenment had a tendency to fragment in three directions. There was the rationalist wing of the Enlightenment that turned to science, reason and the empirical way as the yellow brick road into the future. There were the romantics that dared to differ with the rationalists, and the romantics held high the way of poetry, the arts and intuition.\n\nThen, there were the humanists. It was the humanists that attempted to see the best in the romantics and rationalists yet question their limited approaches to knowing and being. It was the humanists within the Enlightenment that attempted to synthesize the best of the rationalist and romantic traditions and raise both to a higher level through such a synthesis.\n\nThis bit of prose captures nicely the interpretive tripartite I have been setting up, if we take Leon as stand-in for the “romantic,” Berkhoff, the old-style politician, as stand-in for the “rationalist” in his pursuit of pragmatic, though unimaginative, solutions. And because we noted earlier that the film manages to squeeze out the Liberal consensus-maker, it seems, then, that the film has abandoned some measure of its possible humanity, or what Dart takes the humanist function to be—precisely the negation or subduing of conflict, and then (according to Dart) in the name of facilitating the unfolding of the dialectic, i.e., by letting forces clash (thesis vs. antithesis) and finding a third way (synthesis).[8]\n\nYet this third way consensus making must choose the manner in which the unfolding must take place and for someone armed only with a rational understanding of how the dialect functions, it is easy to see, right off the bat, where the asymmetry lies. But how to articulate (or formulate, say in non-rationalist manner), how the romantic aspect of the dialectic functions?\n\nIt seems clear to me that one can only bring one’s convictions, can only perform this aspect of the unfolding, and here is from where Leon’s charm is primarily derived. As mentioned earlier, Leon Bronstein is something like what a NYL is supposed to be, and this because he is armed only with his convictions, has not surrendered to the dialectic but claims it as his own. He isn’t taking charge of history. He is allowing another more significant reality to work its way through him and so is participating in that reality, not by virtue of rational weighing of costs and benefits, but through sheer belief, the stuff that stirs passions. The NYL is obviously supposed to do this, but under the auspices of technocratic wisdom. Leon Bronstein has abandoned the technocratic, rationalistic portion of the dialectic and made the romantic side his raison d’etre.\n\nIn concluding, I’ll begin with some words from Jacob Klapwijk’s careful survey of the dialectic in the twentieth century, Dialectic of Enlightenment, first published in Dutch in 1976 but only recently appearing in English (2010). Klapwijk unapologetically defines the “dialectic as an expression of belief” (91) and notes how Horkheimer and Adorno “claim that ‘freedom in society is inseparable from enlightenment thinking’” (qtd. in Klapwijk, 91) without recourse to “rational justification” (91)—that is, as an axiomatic starting point.\n\nKlapwijk deals intimately with the internal contradictions of the rationalist approach where a rational understanding of the historical process of unfolding is supposed to liberate us, but instead, traps us, because a world left to its own rational process of unfolding leaves little room for its subjective interpretation. He elaborates further:\n\nWe have seen that the word ‘dialectics’ has many [often contradictory] meanings. There is no reason to reject the notion of dialectic in itself. But we are forced to conclude that within the Hegelian and Marxist traditions the word has grown into a hidden faith regarding the inevitable course of history. History is characterized as developing via oppositions and at this moment necessarily leading to an ominous reversal of [the promise of] reason.\n\nSome readers may perhaps feel that this is the point at which to break off the discussion with these “dogmatic Marxists.”\n\nBut, for one thing, there is the question of whether a philosophical discussion ought to ever reach that point. And, apart from that, we should ask whether the desire to cut the discussion off does not equally betray a dogmatic prejudice, a belief in the so-called self-sufficiency of reason and in the closed logical nature of scientific debate. Leszek Kolakowski, a Polish Neo-Marxist … has disputed this self-sufficient status of reason. He once remarked that scientific reason is constantly turning into a myth within Marxism, the myth of “immaculate reason” and “scientific ideology.” This is indeed a glimmer of new light within Marxist circles. The only question is whether philosophy outside Marxist circles is also willing to criticize this pretended self-sufficiency.\n\nThus I do not think the Frankfurt School philosophers should be reproached for the fact that their critical theory depends on an attitude of faith and ultimate commitment. The reproach is that their theory has not been sufficiently critical to acknowledge this pre-theoretical starting point. Thus theoretical reason pretends to be a force all its own, and faith in the dialectic becomes a self-evident dogma, although it is ignored.\n\nAnd in fact, strange though it may sound, this hidden dogma begins to show mythical traits, just like Kolakowski noticed. For if myth, in the original sense of the word, is a belief in the mysterious forces of nature that are imbued with an immanent spirit, where does that leave the modern belief in the hidden advance towards an automated world driven along by “the immanent logic of history”? (94-95)\n\nIt is more than coincidence that Taylor labels the cult of Trudeaumania “mythic” (8). Considered against the above, the belief in liberal consensus-politics betrays a mythic devotion to technocratic wisdom—taken in positive light, perhaps, by those outside of Marxist circles, and in a negative light by those within them. Both deny the role of faith in their respective accounts for the dialectic however. The only “third way” that remains is a return to belief.\n\n“Every human being,” Klapwijk says, “is obliged to face a choice—one that impinges prior to any philosophical reflection—namely the unavoidable need to choose between what I would like to call a mythical faith and a personal faith” (96). He notes also that “there is reason to be fearful,” but “also reason to be confident” (97). The mythical faith is the blind adherence to the rational unfolding of history. A personal faith requires a belief that the betterment of human beings is possible through the dialectic, even if the means of achieving this are beyond rational calculation or articulation.\n\nWhat The Trotsky shows is that Canada is not a nation (like America) to be discovered, but a nation to be claimed—not by looking to a shared past to find clues to guarantee our survival, but by pursuing common goals and interests in the present, hence to share in an imagined future together. This is also the philosophical undercurrent of Taylor’s The Pattern of Politics, which expresses this internal dialectical tension of Canada:\n\nThe mere belated acceptance of difference is not enough to provide the real basis of unity in this country. It will remove some of the sources of friction, but it will not create a strong sense of common fate and common belonging – in other words, an identity that will also unite Canadians. Divided as we are by language, culture, tradition, provenance, and history, we can only be brought together by common purposes; our unity must be a projective one, based on a significant common future rather than a shared past …\n\nThe seeming paradox of our situation is that really meaningful unity can only be attained by another kind of division. But this is no real paradox. People of different regions, backgrounds, languages, and cultures can only come together around some common project; and if this is meaningful, and not some magic consensus-dream in which everyone can project what he wants, then it is bound to inconvenience somebody and thus raise opposition. The great transcontinental railroads were, in their day, great bones of contention. (131, 34)\n\nIf it is our lot as Canadians to express ourselves in common purpose, what we require is a common voice and the political apparatus to achieve this. Furthermore, we require the faith and courage necessary to withstand not only the myriad number of clashes and confrontations, but the subsequent burden of choice, which means we will, sometimes, choose incorrectly. Logic or planning or what have you might fail us; but we cannot waver in our belief.\n\nSome will say that this film is too light to command the sort of seriousness I am demanding of it here. But it is precisely the lightness of the film that makes its message effective. That is, there is no redeeming the more humane qualities of the dialectic through seriousness, lest the author or auteur in question be labelled an ideological firebrand by (liberal) intellectuals. One way to cut through the sort of cynical critical hit-jobs in making a case (once again) for the value of the dialectic, to make a claim for seriousness, is precisely by denying a claim to seriousness, by appealing, say, to the whims and imagination of youth.\n\nThe film is as serious or as light as those viewing the film are willing to make it. Should we be taking a film like The Trotsky seriously? The film has its convictions to be sure; part of what makes the film appealing is its ability to state them. How else (nowadays) to issue the sort of clarion call left-leaning critics have been issuing as early as the 1940s (Horkheimer and Adorno) or, in Canada, the 1970s (Charles Taylor)?\n\nComedy might be one way. Seriousness is no longer given; it too has to be claimed. Part of what this film demands is participation—a claim to community. The Trotsky is as likely to fall by the wayside as it is to spark a revolution. If it has (up to this point) fallen by the wayside, can a critical effort such as this one add anything at all to the film’s promise?\n\nNotes\n\n[1] This is the tack taken by Ronald Beiner in his critique of Taylor. Though he does not explicitly use the terms “earlier” or “later,” he does make a useful distinction: “Taylor himself counts as a social critic only when he writes a book like The Pattern of Politics, not one like the Sources of the Self.” Beiner says Taylor, in Sources of the Self, abandons a stance of “wide justification” in his refusal to justify his belief in the dialectic, thus (merely) providing a “deep[er] description” of its unfolding. What allows Taylor to be a more effective social critic in The Pattern of Politics, Beiner notes, is his direct engagement with “fellow citizens within the horizon of the concerns shared by [his] specific national community.” While Beiner takes Sources of the Self to task for posing as philosophical thought without engaging in social criticism, he does not discuss whether The Pattern of Politics should be read as serious philosophy, as an example of the “wide justification” he desires. See Beiner 453.\n\n[2] This is obviously an interpretation, Taylor’s to be precise, for certainly the film does not attempt to salvage or smear the legacy of Trudeau. Famous Canadian Hegelian David MacGregor offers a rival interpretation. Commenting on The Pattern of Politics, he says “Charles Taylor dismissed \"Trudeaumania\" as an American copycat operation, more form than substance. Trudeau would never “rattle the teacups\" of the establishment, the philosopher claimed. Twenty years later Taylor would accept the invitation of the Business Council for National Issues to trash ‘Meech rejectors’ and other wayward souls while Trudeau’s principled opposition to the Meech-Charlottetown garroting of Canada would upset the teacups of bankers and corporate leaders across the country.” Yet the tension noted by MacGregor’s is still between image and substance, merely with the roles reversed. What The Trotsky does ask us to consider is this duality—between image and substance. See MacGregor.\n\n[3] It would not be crazy to suppose that the trajectory of the movie should work towards curing Bronstein of his ailment, so that the movie’s climax should revolve around his conversion back to reality, to a world where answers are not so easily forthcoming and where the simple pragmatism of the Berkhoff’s of the generally characterizises the lay of the land. This film makes a case for what Raoul Eshelman calls “performatism,” for performing one’s conviction—here in order to achieve not personal but political ends. Eshelman claims that the “performative” work of art claims its founding principles or narrative slant right off the bat; the unfolding of the narrative work merely documents the consequences of these choices. Certainly Leon Bronstein’s belief provides the ontological apparatus for the internal logic of this film to unfold. See Eshelman.\n\n[4] Here I am heartened by a segment of Cavell’s reading of Capra’s Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. The simultaneous comic value and horror of Deeds’s willingness to punch the lights out of others prompts the following timely reflection, words pertinent also, I would say, to the simultaneous comic value and horror we feel when Leon takes his principal hostage: “Exercising the right to speak not only takes precedence over social power, it takes precedence over any particular form of accomplishment; no amount of contribution is more valuable to the formation and preservation of community than the willingness to contribute and the occasion to be heard…it leaves your voice your own and allows your opinion to matter to others only because it matters to you. It is not a voice that will be heard by villains. This means that to discover our community a few will have to be punched out, made speechless in their effort to usurp or devalue the speech of others—one interpretation of Deeds’s repeated violence, punching men in the jaw. It is a fantasy of a reasonably well ordered participatory democracy. It has its dangers; democracy has; speech has.” See Cavell, Cities 207.\n\n[5] The “Grand Narrative,” then, as an account, simply, of how things came to be. The idea behind studying the dialectic, of course, is that with enough patience and endurance, one can begin to uncover or unearth the “logic” of the times gone by (geist), hence decode how it is that the dialectic is set to unfold in future.\n\n[6] Eagleton’s distinction is between rigid, implacable dogma (moralism) and the sort of morality that comes via a layered and subtle engagement with “an intricately woven texture of nuances, qualities and fine gradations.” See Eagleton 144.\n\n[7] A prominent critic in this vein is Karl Popper, whose Poverty of Historicism (1957) takes dead aim at Marxists, in particular their insistence that “all history is the history of class struggle.” Posed as a hypothesis, Popper notes, the idea is compelling. But ultimately, as theory, the premise is untestable. Though in the book he opts for a political agenda of “piecemeal social engineering,” he still advocates the “necessity of adopting a point of view” though always with a mind to its potential falsification. See Popper 58, 140.\n\n[8] This terminology may be a bit purple or imprecise. I use it figuratively.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBeiner, Ronald. \"Hermeneutical Generosity and Social Criticism.\" Critical Review 9.4 (1995. Print): 447-64.\n\nCavell, Stanley. Cities of Words.

But the parallels between the two are related less to content than to form. That is, my claim here will be that both use their respective mediums (i.e., theatre, cinema) to depict tragedy, but that the latter’s medium can only transfigure what we take tragedy to be, hence inherits, in a way, tragedy from theatre.\n\nAnd the conduit through which tragedy passes on to cinema is a technology, as cinema is encompassed by what Marshall McLuhan calls “typography.” That is, in placing King Lear at the beginning of a discussion of “typographic” man (or woman) and cinema at the other, McLuhan, at the very least, invites speculation that cinema can inherit something of whatever it is we take King Lear to be doing. After that, it is merely a matter of making the case that JCVD is the right piece of cinema to bring this intuition to bear, which then does become a matter, or consideration, of content.\n\nA working “definition” of tragedy (which suits my purposes) can be taken from Eagleton:\n\n[Modern] society is awash with admirable ideals, but structurally incapable of realizing them … . Since this stalled dialectic between an impotent idealism and a degraded actuality is inherent to the … social order, and incapable of being resolved by it, it might well be termed tragic. (208)\n\nThe formulation of the above definition that I will pursue is that society today is awash with answers but incapable of posing the (right) questions. This is a legacy of hyper-fragmentation, that takes us from a “modern” view of tragedy (above) to the “postmodern.”\n\nTragedy, that privileged preserve of gods and spiritual giants, has now been decisively democratized – which is to say, for the devotees of gods and giants, abolished … Tragedy, however, did not vanish because there were no more great men. It did not expire with the last absolutist monarch. On the contrary, since under democracy each one of us is to be incommensurably cherished, it has been multiplied far beyond antique imagining. (94)\n\nThis multiplication of tragedy leads to sensationalism, as though for something to register as tragic, it must first be sensationalized, which, in a way, denies it the status of tragedy. It isn’t that tragedy has disappeared in our age; we simply don’t perceive it anymore, hence are silenced in a way. This in itself is tragic. What lengths are we willing to go to, then, in attempting to register a tragic pathos? Does a direct-to-camera monologue suffice?\n\nI will have more to say about sensationalism. For now, I note that tragedy occurs when we find that our lives do not, somehow cannot, square with the very ideals we live our lives to achieve in the first place. Again, we have our lives, our ideals, but are (structurally?) incapable of realizing them. Whether and how things go wrong (and/or how things go right) we can only know in hindsight. Cinema can remind us of this.\n\nIn making my case for tragedy, I am not saying anything new about tragedy. (I am certainly not out to formulate a “theory” or “definition” of tragedy.) What I am saying is that cinema, through its unique depiction of passage, is best suited, as an art form, to depict what Eagleton takes to be tragic today—i.e., our structural inability to achieve our ideals. And a movie like JCVD stands on the vanguard of what we might consider to be tragic (popular) art in our time.\n\n1. Il n’a jamais tapé sur les arabs/ He never hit Arabs\n\nThis is as good a reason as any to document the life of an action star, that of Jean Claude Van Damme, whom director Mabrouk el Mechri praises not by presenting an apriori vision of this action star’s assumed strength, but rather, the (his) aposteriori acquisition of knowledge through experience and suffering.\n\nMoreover, it is highly doubtful that Jean Claude Van Damme, in life, plotted the trajectory of his career to ensure he never hit Arabs. Yet here we are—or, rather, there he is, on screen before us, in the hands of a brilliant French-Tunisian director, starring in a film that bears his name. The curiously eponymous title, which uses the star’s stage, and not real, name risks this film’s claim to seriousness, as though the reference to JC implies the unfolding of a story of biblical proportions.\n\nYet the reference, in calling attention to the King of Kings, also suggests that JCVD appears before us a mere mortal King—not as ‘King of Kings,’ but as, say, King VD, or King Van Damme, a character who shares more in common with a tragic Shakespearean King than any sort of Biblical one, prophet or otherwise. That is, JCVD may have more to do with the King Lear narrative than any traditional Bible story. Have we moved beyond false claims to seriousness?\n\nKing Lear certainly has crosses to bear. The reason I think it worth mentioning this play alongside this movie is not because JCVD is a retelling or reimagining of the Lear tale (the way The Lion King is said to mirror the Hamlet tale) but, say, a reincarnation of Lear’s themes—mostly a thematization of a particular relationship to knowledge—say, our knowledge of the world. That is, in a world where answers are not so easily forthcoming, knowing the answers before hearing the question becomes much more urgent.\n\nFor Lear, this means staging the love test, appropriating the answers he wants in hopes of circumventing or dodging potential answers he cannot bear. For JCVD, this means philosophizing after the fact, expounding on “awareness,” so that if parallels exist between JCVD and King Lear, it is because each operates from opposite ends of the philosophical pole. King Lear fights uncertainty, or the unknown, before things go wrong; JCVD fights off the unknown only after things go right. Both flirt with madness.\n\nJust as JCVD philosophizes in hindsight, we are likely to read King Lear in hindsight. I have mentioned elsewhere that the tragic resonances of King Lear are lost when we bring our knowledge of Lear’s “madness” or “guilt” to the play before actually reading (or seeing) the play.[1] Without prior knowledge of the basic artifices of the King Lear narrative (a luxury or benefit more likely to us today because of our ahistorical position to the play, so to indulge in the type of historicism so common nowadays is to further douse the impact of (its) tragedy), we would have every reason to suppose King Lear innocent until proven guilty.\n\nExactly when (or if?) we discover he is guilty (or mad), then, becomes a crucial turning point in the play. Playing again on opposites, JCVD takes pains to paint its hero as guilty until proven innocent. The theatrical trailer, for example (at least the one that appears as an extra on my DVD) suggests that the movie is about, or depicts, a JCVD driven (because of legal fees and scandal) to desperation, hence to hold up a bank. This is an example, albeit rare, of a trailer working in tandem with, and with an eye to, the particular aesthetic effects the movie seeks to carry out.[2]\n\nWe know for certain, when JCVD knocks at the rear entrance of the post office to a star struck security guard, that he is, in fact, innocent of the crime the first thirty-three minutes (roughly) suggest he is guilty of perpetrating, either alone or in collaboration with others. Can we forgive a director for deceiving us so? We may take issue with El Mechri’s selective directing, or we may say, more dangerously, and with the benefit of hindsight, something like: “Of course we were fooled by the narrative; that was the point!” But what was the point exactly? To fool the audience? What is the lesson or moral (if any) to be drawn from this particular staging and sequence of events?\n\nWe all know that our knowledge of the world is limited, never perfect, so that to make conclusions or inferences about the world as we go along, as it passes before our eyes, is not ideal but something like the best we can do under the circumstances. Hence we need not be scandalized at all by our initial presumption of JCVD’s guilt; in fact, it is the director’s responsibility, if he cares at all about objective truth/reportage, to show us both sides.\n\nThis El Mechri does beautifully, retelling the opening scenes in Schaerbeek (when Van Damme pulls up in front of the video store and poses for pictures with its proprietors before entering the post-office/bank) entirely, but from the other side of the camera axis line, a cinematographer’s faux pas because to do so is to ruin or break up narrative continuity, to disorient the audience.\n\nAgain we could reply: “Breaking up the continuity was the point!” But why? Because it was a cool thing to do? Or perhaps to reveal how easy it is to believe we have the whole story when we have only been shown half a story. But we only know we witnessed half the story once the other half is shown. Otherwise, the first half is itself the world, makes up all we know it to be. So the question in this story, like Lear, is when do we decide that JCVD is guilty because whenever that is, it is obviously much too early.\n\nMoreover, once we are shown that he is, in fact, innocent, we are likely to forget 1) that moments earlier we were calling for his blood and 2) the particular events and sequence of events, or types of evidence shown that had us jumping the gun in the first place.\n\nIf hindsight has us claim JCVD’s innocence all along, in King Lear (in the opposite register), hindsight causes us to bluff Lear’s guilt or madness all along, as though we knew, from the outset, that something was amiss the moment Lear reveals his “darker purpose.”\n\nMeantime we shall express our darker purpose.\n\nGive me the map there. Know that we have divided\n\nIn three our kingdom, and ’tis our fast intent\n\nTo shake all cares and business from our age,\n\nConferring them on younger strengths while we\n\nUnburdened crawl toward death. (1.1.34-39)\n\nLear’s “darker” purpose is to divide his kingdom among his three daughters “that future strife/ May be prevented now” (1.1.42-3). Yet the relevant entendre is noted by Marshall McLuhan.\n\nWhen King Lear proposes “our darker purpose” as the subdivision of his kingdom, he is expressing a politically daring and avant-garde intent for the early seventeenth century … His “darker purpose” would have been recognized at once as left-wing Machiavellianism by an Elizabethan audience. … Whereas the role of the feudal monarch had been inclusive, the king actually including in himself all his subjects, the Renaissance prince tended to become an exclusive power centre surrounded by his individual subjects.\n\nAnd the result of such centralism … was the habit of delegation of powers and the specializing of many functions in separate areas and individuals. In King Lear, as in other plays, Shakespeare shows an utter clairvoyance concerning the social and personal consequences of denudation and stripping of attributes and functions for the sake of speed, precision, and increased power. (11-12)\n\nMachiavellianism here meaning the divorce from an archaic world of “roles” (14) to an increasingly modern one based on specialism. Such rapid fragmentation and division of powers does not lead to the fragmentation of sense perception (and the increased stress on visual (i.e., written) technology over aural (i.e., oral)). Rather, the technology of moveable type, which both centralizes power and disseminates specific roles through print, initiates this fragmentation of the senses. Technology, in McLuhan’s world, leads.[3]\n\nWe have reason to doubt King Lear’s motives right off the bat if we, like Elizabethan audiences, are up on our Machiavelli. But lacking this knowledge, how do we decide when Lear is not to be trusted, that revealing a “darker purpose” means anything other than revealing that which was simply unknown previously, hence darker? I am not going to speculate here when it is precisely that we ascertain Lear’s madness because whatever answer I come up with is always subject to interpretation.\n\nYet speculation is worthy here, particularly in light of McLuhan’s reading of the play which seems to place the tragedy of King Lear somewhat beyond our star, as if lacking the novelty and aversion to Machiavelli Elizabethan audiences were privy to, we now find ourselves estranged from the play, unable to perceive it the way we were/are supposed to, the way Shakespeare may have wanted us to. So why do we keep reading King Lear? Is Lear still tragic today? And what has any of this to do with JCVD, a movie which I claim sustains, for contemporary tastes, tragic impulses?\n\nThe reason I think McLuhan is relevant is because his book on The Gutenberg Galaxy, which presents an account of man on his way to becoming “typographic,” begins with a discussion of King Lear. Part of my objective in this paper will be to trace out some of McLuhan’s thinking and then to consider where he leaves us and why JCVD is as good a figure as any to stand at the opposite end of a Gutenberg galaxy that begins with Lear.\n\nMcLuhan also invites a consideration of media, and he has some startling things to say about cinema. And though he never articulates the making of typographic man as having anything to do with, or encompassing, a tragic worldview, something of this sentiment makes up not only part of what I believe makes Lear tragic (today), but JCVD as well.\n\n2. La réponse avant la question/ The answer before the question\n\nAt least three of the four title cards which appear in the film highlight awkward philosophical phrasings which we are to understand have been uttered at some point not by JCVD but by Jean Claude Van Damme in real life. In drawing attention once again to these remarks – which many in Belgium, if not Europe, are likely to feel are best put to rest – the film is asking us to take a second look now that the original sensation these phrasings caused (concomitant with Van Damme’s past drug use) has subsided.\n\nAmazingly, the hostages in the bank have both the good fortune and the audacity to play a clip of some of Jean Claude’s real life philosophical transgressions in the presence of JCVD himself! When the little boy, after seeing the clip, puts the question, “C’est quoi ‘aware’?” he is hushed by his mother only to receive a reply in English from JCVD: “It’s okay.”\n\nDespite the fact that such an answer may indeed be colloquial in French, that the response is in English suggests it is not with European or even Belgian audiences whom JCVD/Van Damme is seeking, in this film, to (re)gain standing. Rather, he is making his particular plea to America, or to his American fans. So American audiences are given certain answers about JCVD before the question is posed. What is the question exactly?\n\nThe little boy poses one, but none of us (North) Americans are in any position to answer because without the answers in advance, the question simply does not make sense. What do we know about what JCVD does or doesn’t know about being aware? This discussion was given heavy air time in Europe, not America.[4] If these sorts of transgressions have become household notorieties only in Europe, why would JCVD care to risk whatever standing he may have with an American audience? Europeans may know better than to ask; JCVD is saying, however, that it is still okay to ask.\n\nIf we were to ask ourselves this same question, could we come up with not necessarily a better, but any sort of answer? The question may prompt us to think of an answer. But what is the boy is asking exactly? Is he asking what being “aware” is? Or is he asking what JCVD means when he says “aware”? How we answer the question depends on how we interpret the question. Europeans might answer differently than Americans. For Europeans, the answers already exist. But for Americans, they may not, hence require more time and consideration before answering. JCVD still has standing in America and is still willing to pose the question (of “awareness”) there.\n\nThe only time we hear the philosophical phrase (“La reponse avant la question”) is during JCVD’s direct-to-camera soliloquy.\n\nThis movie is for me. There we are, you and me. Why did you do that? Or why did I do that? You made my dream come true. I asked you for it. I promised you something in return, and I haven’t delivered yet. You win, I lose.\n\nUnless, the path you’ve set for me is full of hurdles, where the answer comes before the question. Yeah, I do that. Now I know why. It’s the cure, from what I’ve seen here. It all makes sense. It makes sense to those who understand.\n\nJCVD’s astonishing reach out to his audience, executed under certain ontological presumptions, invites commentary from Stanley Cavell, who, writing on the ontology of film, discusses theatre’s relation to cinema:\n\nThe depth of the automatism of photography is to be read not alone in its mechanical production of an image of reality, but in its mechanical defeat of our presence to that reality. The audience in a theatre can be defined as those to whom the actors are present while they are not present to the actors. But movies allow the audience to be mechanically absent. (25-26)\n\nWhen we watch King Lear, we understand him to be in our presence, or you could say, in our present, his drama unfolding before our eyes; we are not in his. Also, a King standing before your eyes can claim to be present. An image of a person or King who appears to us onscreen, however, has no presence. What we see is a moment in time already in the can, dead to us.\n\nWhile we are absent to both the screen actor and the stage actor, we find ourselves at a further remove from the screen actor because neither is he in our present. Is JCVD, in pleading with us as he does across the medium of film, making a sort of ontological mistake, demanding too much of his medium?\n\nBut JCVD never says, or claims to be, in our presence; he says this movie is for him. This could mean that through this movie, he is trying to make sense of things, to put pieces of his life together. But this movie does not exactly depict moments of his (past) life; rather it depicts moments surrounding a single event: a bank heist.\n\nTo think of JCVD as a biopic, or even a sort of retrospective, is erroneous. JCVD is happening in the present—not in ours but in JCVD’s, so that he finds himself present to himself. He is in his own presence. And how this movie works as a reversal of Cavell’s claim, in its attempt to present JCVD as truly present to us, is by showing us a character, dead to us but alive to his own presence hence relaying that presence to us “as if by mirrors” (Bazin qtd. in Cavell 26).[5] This is how JCVD pulls off its wild attempt to cross genres, staking its claim as a piece of cinematic theatre.\n\nSo present to us, what can this mean? That we did indeed make him who he is today, that “we” made his dream come true? Yet our absence from JCVD has not been compromised, only rerouted. JCVD’s dream is obviously not to appear in this film, but to appear in movies in general, to have a movie career. But he is far less present to us in those movies than he is in this one. We certainly did not make his dream come true, unless his dream all along was to be consumed, to remain distant from his audience, from others. But why would anyone pursue a life of fame if their dream all along was to remain separate from others?[6]\n\nIf his dream all along was to discover some sort of intimacy with the world, and, upon discovering that such intimacy is not forthcoming (by appearing in movies), then the problem of intimacy becomes unsolvable for the time being—unless clearing the hurdles to achieve said intimacy represents some sort of spiritual test.\n\nThat is, if it no longer makes sense to pose questions about the possibility for intimacy with the world (after pursing a life of fame as a movie star), then the answer cannot simply be that such intimacy is impossible. That would be unbearable. Rather, extending the problem – by proposing answers that at least allow the question to make sense, that hold out hope that the question is ultimately answerable – may be the only solution.\n\nHow does one achieve said intimacy? By being “aware.” We wouldn’t pose intimacy as a question otherwise. But as an answer, this merely begs the question: “what is ‘aware’?” So we have an answer before the question. Subsequent questions no longer address the problem of intimacy and seek instead to expose the ridiculousness of the answer in a way that presupposes that no answer is possible; hence to ask the question (of intimacy) is itself ridiculous.\n\nSo indeed, it all makes sense to those who understand. Now he truly understands why he does that. If it is our lot to live without the intimacy of the world we desire, it only makes sense to extend the life of the question—not by asking the question and coming up with answers we cannot bear but by presupposing answers that show that the question is (still) relevant. This is a humanistic gesture.\n\nPresuming that answers come before questions, so we would never risk asking questions we could not answer is implied in McLuhan’s famous motto that “the medium is the message,” taken to mean, of course, that what we talk about is not nearly as important as the conditions which mediate the way we talk, or the manner in which we go about posing questions, in the first place. So the answers we want are locked up in the means we use to communicate.\n\nMcLuhan is certainly not the first to put form ahead of content. Yet he is unique in posing “technology” or “media” (rather than language, religion, nation, class, commerce, or, more recently, gender, sexuality, or culture) as making up or mediating the sorts of answers we are likely to come up with.\n\nBut why choose “media” or “technology” to discuss tragedy in this paper? One answer would be that whatever it is we want to say about “tragedy,” we know or wish it to exist, or be taken up by, drama; and the medium which we nowadays employ (mostly) to depict drama is the cinema. Here is McLuhan on cinema:\n\nThe invention of typography, as such, is an example of the application of the knowledge of traditional crafts to a special visual problem … The mechanization of the scribal art was probably the first reduction of any handicraft to mechanical terms. That is, it was the first translation of movement into a series of static shots or frames.\n\nTypography bears much resemblance to cinema, just as the reading of print puts the reader in the role of the movie projector. The reader moves the series of imprinted letters before him at a speed consistent with apprehending the motions of the author’s mind. (124-25)\n\nIf the making of typographic man began in the Renaissance just after the invention of the Gutenberg printing press, and if King Lear documents some of the psychic travails that occur when we find ourselves removed from a tribal communal order (marked by permanence and static art) to one which depicts passage, as our thoughts begin to move in linear progression over pieces of moveable type—then a consideration of “media” is enough to account for a continuity between King Lear and cinema, to say the least.\n\nAnd since both King Lear and cinema are in the business of staging drama, then both, at the very least, have the opportunity to stage or say something tragic. We are generally in agreement about plays like King Lear; but what about the cinema?\n\n3. Time and the hour runs through the roughest day/ Le temps et les heures passent a travers la plus mauvaise journée.\n\nThe quotation taken from Macbeth (1.3.146) may boost my claim that it is profitable to read JCVD as a reincarnation of a tragic Shakespearean King, though it seems I have chosen the wrong one. But Macbeth is a King who has the audacity, or is afforded the opportunity, to ask questions before imagining what the answers might look like—a risk he is willing to take because he is in the presence of seers who can give him answers immediately.\n\nMacbeth himself cannot infer the (or any) causal chain of events that would take him to the crown; hence he has no reason to covet it. Now obviously lots of people still covet lots of things despite being unable to imagine a specific chain of events leading to possession. But to lack such imagination is to deny desire a particular expression; imagining the means of obtaining possession is the first step to expressing desire. Macbeth is in the unique position of having his desires expressed for him. Nor does having the answers prove all that beneficial to him. What Macbeth shows is how we fumble with apriori knowledge or assumptions about ourselves, which might be to show how awkward we are, fatally so, with our desires.\n\nEarlier I mentioned how JCVD takes care to extend the life of a question which is, for the time being, unanswerable. But what do we make of Jeff’s (his agent) much more crass expression of the same sort of faux-philosophy? JCVD, after pleading with him for a studio gig, drowns out his voice momentarily and then resumes the conversation with an interjection: “I lost my daughter.” Jeff doesn’t skip a beat, responding with, “You’re gonna get over that. Hey, remember Shakespeare. Time and the hour. Through the longest day. Everything passes. You gotta believe me here man. Life goes on. Especially in this town.”\n\nIf the question in this case can be formulated as something like, “why me?” – expressing helplessness – then what Jeff seeks to do is extend the life of the question because immediate answers are not available. JCVD does the same thing in coming up with answers that, unfortunately, end up presupposing the wrong question (“why me?” instead becomes “what is aware?”).\n\nThe difference between Jeff and JCVD’s responses is that Jeff’s response is a dismissal of the question while JCVD’s is an acknowledgment of its seriousness, however awkward the reply. That is, Jeff’s catchall phrases are used when there is nothing left to say; to utter them is to remove the weight of the present for the time being. It is, simultaneously, of no consolation whatsoever to say simply “life goes on,” in iambic pentameter or otherwise.\n\nJCVD’s terse response is the only one warranted: “Stop it,” he says, forgoing conversation and even (this sort of) consolation. JCVD at least acknowledges the reality of the present by situating his answer in being, or awareness. Jeff forgoes an answer altogether, reminding his interlocutor to look past the failure of the present and instead to an uncertain future, which may yield better fortunes. So is the passage of time a blessing or a curse?\n\nA brief consideration of time is pertinent here and the following discussion, taken from George Poulet’s remarkable studies on human time, gets at the heart of the dilemma, if less at a definitive answer. Commenting on human perception of time in the late-nineteenth century, Poulet first quotes nineteenth century French poet Maurice de Guérin:\n\n“Nature admits me to the most remote of its divine abodes, the starting point of universal life; there I detect the cause of motion, and I hear in all its freshness the first chant of souls.”\n\nNineteenth-century time seems essentially a continuous motion which can only be understood in its trend away from its original cause: it is a becoming which is always future. Reality is no longer, as in the Aristotelian becoming, the thing completed, but the very genetic process by which cause engenders effect. I exist and I participate in the existence of things only insofar as I experience their generation. Speaking of this inner experience which allowed him to understand the personality of the people, Michelet writes: “I understood it. Why? Because I was able to follow it in its historical origins and watch it come out of the depths of time.” (Poulet’s emphasis, 32)\n\nThe introduction of causality into human affairs—that is, isolating causes from effects and tracing out the implications of both, is the sort of denudation McLuhan discusses in The Gutenberg Galaxy. Here Poulet, Guérin, and Jules Michelet document a way to eternity in isolating the first cause, as though once discovered, we will have all the apriori knowledge we need to reclaim being and duration from a process of change, flux and passage.\n\nUnderstanding here, of nature’s causes, is liberating and celebrated as a significant spiritual achievement. Yet the backlash to this sort of “generative law,” expressed here as well by Jules Lequier, is also forthcoming:\n\nIn order to conceive [the generative law], the mind must exile itself from time to enter into a kind of negative eternity. From this point, it may again be possible for it to move onward once more into some sort of time, but this time is purely scientific, made of determinations and effects; it is not the time of the human being: “At one point in this vast world animated by a continual motion that is continually transformed, where from instant to instant nothing occurred expect that which had its origin in a former state of things, I saw myself, beyond my memories, in my origin: me, this new-born me, this strange me which began by being, I saw deposited unbeknownst to itself at a point in the universe: mysterious germ destined to become with the years what its nature and its complex environment required.”\n\nIn these words of Lequier, lived experience of cosmic duration ends up in the thought of an existence in which everything is dealt out in advance: a dead duration; a diagram of time. (33)\n\nBeing, housed in a first cause which can be known through scientific discovery or, less dramatically, through cause and effect, is both a blessing and a curse. A blessing in that our lives are suddenly ours to discover, with the means now to discover, or trace out, their causes. Yet a curse because the method of discovery itself is never in question; who can argue with causality?\n\nAll answers are forthcoming if we simply follow the process because “everything is dealt out in advance.” When we find that the answers we need are not available, when our lives don’t square with the narrative others insist is true, what is required is further supplication to form—to trace out our origins more carefully. Answers are not to be found in the present, but in the infinitely long and inexhaustible past.\n\nForm then becomes time, or passage, which is said to heal all wounds. When JCVD suddenly realizes that life is not unfolding, has not unfolded, as he expected, the only answer Jeff can give is for him to allow life to keep unfolding, which isn’t exactly a pessimistic answer. But why should JCVD believe that passage of time will heal his particular wounds this time around? To do so would be a way of denying the world. It is, rather, passage he seeks to understand, as though this knowledge will save him.\n\nHe makes a plea for it: “What’s going on here?” He isn’t given a straight answer but is taken for a ride: “I’ve never done bad by you! I’ve always done the right thing by you.” Jeff expresses as much amazement and incredulousness at the present state of things as JCVD; he doesn’t know any better why or how things went wrong. It’s quite likely that Jeff has done everything by the book; but he has no appetite for philosophy. Rather than question first principles, initiate something of the examined life, he simply reiterates the answers: “You’re an international fuckin’ movie star … You work all the time. You’re well protected.” All of which is true. So what exactly is JCVD’s problem?\n\nTwo reasons to view this film with suspicion and to insist, further, that it does not warrant the type of seriousness I am claiming for it here are 1) Jean Claude Varenberg has had his time in the spotlight as Jean-Claude Van Damme. For the critic to applaud his crass attempt to cash in on his failure when indeed the fates have (finally) tossed failure his way after a life of so much sex and drugs would be to abandon the sort of critical seriousness required to stave off philosophical charlatans and opportunists. That is, Jean Claude Van Damme, having exhausted the currency of his persona, now comes before us as JCVD. Do we owe him any sympathy?\n\n2) To indulge in actually granting JCVD the sympathy he is after is to immerse ourselves in critical shadenfreude, so that what we take to be aesthetic pleasure in watching the film is actually our critical faculties basking in the misfortune of another. Is a man who falls on hard times after taking for granted too easily the good only deserving of a) critical suspicion or b) critical patrimony?\n\nOne way to answer both criticisms would be to say, immediately, that it is not clear that JCVD is seeking to come to terms with his misfortune, but rather, his good fortune. His soliloquy goes on:\n\nI saw people worse off than me. I went from poor to rich and thought, why aren’t we all like me? Why all the privileges? I’m just a regular guy. It makes me sick to see people who don’t have what I’ve got. Knowing that they have qualities, too. Much more than I do! It’s not my fault if I was cut out to be a star. I asked for it. I asked for it, really believed in it. When you’re thirteen, you believe in your dream. Well, it came true for me.\n\nIt seems likely that JCVD’s foray into philosophy, however strained, initially began when trying to come to terms not with any grave personal loss, but personal gain—or, rather, other people’s loss, those less deserving of such loss and more deserving of (his sort of) fame.\n\nIf this sounds Pollyannaish to some, or if some balk at the idea of apologizing for one’s success (because where would it end?) what such (critical) postures risk is a denial of the (contingencies of the) world in order to affirm an authority and understanding over it which may yet be undeserved. Is the sort of existence, one tied so intimately to contingency, worth affirming? Each individual must answer.\n\nJCVD discovers an answer. Rather than go back and try to ascertain, for oneself, the first cause (risking ridicule either because 1) questioning first principles is something one just doesn’t do or 2) it is no longer reasonable to suppose that an articulation of first causes is enough to achieve the type of spiritual standing in the world Van Damme seeks), Van Damme chooses to remain silent. That is, when the reporter asks him near the end of the film, just after he has been convicted of extorting funds from the Belgian state, “Do you agree with the court’s verdict?” he refuses to answer.\n\nJCVD AT HIS ZENITH\n\nJCVD IS TEMPTED TO AFFIRM HIS FAME AND FORGO HIS EXISTENCE\n\nJCVD REMAINS SILENT AND CLAIMS HIS EXISTENCE\n\nJCVD shrugs off the question, affirming his existence through silence. He forgoes explaining his actions to a sensationalist press more interested in obtaining answers which presuppose that JCVD has fallen from grace. This obviously fits in with a stale narrative of spiritual collapse followed by rebirth (JCVD says: “The snake, Adam and Eve. I don’t buy it anymore”).\n\nJCVD is “reborn” in a way, but the reason the media cannot make headway this time around is because JCVD can never hope to articulate the particular conditions of his new found consciousness.[7] The answers he has found would not make sense to them.\n\nThe first principle he has discovered is that there is no answer, certainly not to the meaningless questions the media continues to ask as cover for the meaningful questions they refuse to ask (for which there are not, or may not be, easy answers). If the climate is not suitable to say or voice what he now holds in his heart, to remain silent is both to extend the life of the particular question posed here and to acknowledge the question’s failure. Is this a sort of spiritual hedge?\n\nThe sheer beauty of JCVD’s descent down the staircase depicts the spiritual standing he has acquired. Appearing before us in the manner of an American movie star, his glamour is tainted by the sensationalist reminders that he is indeed heading off to prison. Yet JCVD has achieved the knowledge, if less the intimacy, of the world he craves. He has learned not to make himself known to the world, but to survive it for the time being—if not exactly by concealing himself, then by not exactly exposing himself (needlessly) either.\n\n(One gets the feeling that he no longer requires jail time to, say, sort things out metaphysically, but to figure out how to teach others what he has learned. When we see him in prison, he has assumed the role of a teacher, of the martial arts—beginning, that is, where his education began.)\n\nBut what exactly are the moral implications of silence? I take it as crucial that JCVD finds a way to register his silence publicly, so that to remain silent without some manner of public engagement would be to invite silence as cover for moral cowardice. What does one need in order to register silence publicly? Obviously a certain standing or authority, the sort it may take a lifetime to achieve because no one can teach silence as any sort of moral stance, especially in a democracy.\n\nThe test then is to use standing to refuse or deny the need to be made or turned into a spectacle. This is a tacit admission that conditions at present are not favourable to speech, only to spectacle. Remaining silent is to extend the life of the question while rebuking the quality of the question. This clear moral stance is a reinterpretation of the “turn-the-other-cheek” motif hence a version of the good word, however silent. The temptation to presume we know the answers in advance – the “cure” to some, no doubt, for what they see – is ultimately an attempt to answer a question no longer profitable to pose.\n\n4. Pierre qui tombe sur un œuf. Oeuf se casse/ Stone falls on egg. Egg breaks.\n\nThis final philosophical parable (at least one version of it) is uttered by the man in the leather jacket, the movie’s nihilistic arch villain, who presupposes an answer of death to all problems posed, philosophical or otherwise.\n\nWhen the three thugs realize that no one on the outside knows they are holding JCVD as hostage on the inside, the thirty-year old (Jean François Wolff) suggests they use JCVD as ransom, to ask for something like a million dollars.[8] The man in the leather jacket quickly overturns this idea saying “So the hostages can go to the cops once we’re out?!”\n\nObviously the original plan was simply to rob the bank/post-office quick and dirty; hostages were never part of the equation. Once they become part of the equation, however, it remains to be seen what sort of solution could prevent the hostages from ever ratting out the lot of them, save for killing every one of them.\n\nLater the man in the leather jacket insists that they start killing hostages in order to gain the “upper hand.” But seeing as exit under the conditions he has articulated is impossible (i.e., in wanting to prevent any of the hostages from ever speaking to anyone), what could possibly constitute an upper hand remains wholly unclear. This disturbing lack of faith in negotiation and dialogue, and the ease with which the man in the leather jacket is willing to massacre innocents (for apparently no good strategic reason) gives this film a particularly sinister feel.\n\nTo announce to the world that they have JCVD hostage seems the most expedient way out of this mess of contingencies. Yet after balking at the chance to escape, they then consider using JCVD as ransom for things they have difficulty formulating in the first place. We are never quite sure who is in charge. When they finally come up with their demands, they insist that JCVD be the one to voice them. It obviously helps that those on the outside believe JCVD is perpetrating the crime; the thugs may simply be improvising.\n\nBut their improvisation less reveals their cunning than their incompetence; what it shows is their willingness to forgo their own authority, as though only a man of JCVD’s stature could make demands in the first place.\n\nHere I am reminded of an exchange between King Lear and Kent, when the latter, disguised as Caius, offers his supplication to Lear as a means of silencing himself:\n\nLEAR: Dost thou know me, fellow?\n\nKENT: No sir, but you have that in your countenance which I would fain call master.\n\nLEAR: What’s that?\n\nKENT: Authority (1.4.24-27)\n\nMcLuhan reads both Kent and Cordelia as victims in a world where roles are undermined by specialists, so lacking roles, they suddenly find they lack the authority to act, hence the authority to speak. Cordelia’s remark to “love and be silent” foreshadows the particular authority and standing she is able to command in the reader’s mind as the play unfolds.\n\nBut in the immediate present, Cordelia clearly does not remain silent; her standing suffers for it. She is pressed to speak and pledges to love according to her bond, no more nor less. Her remarks are immediately sensationalized by the court. Kent comes to her defence; both are banished. Yet their silence has been registered in the public arena. It remains up to them to now figure out how, or if, to act, because if actions can sometimes speak louder than words, so too can silence speak louder than acts. The lesson, that is, is to love and be silent, not to act and be silent.\n\nWhat does any of this have to do with JCVD? The inability for the petty thugs to make themselves known, or heard, in any way to the police they are negotiating with reduces their standing in the world. Their silence is an attempt to gain an authority without risking, or ever having risked, their own skins.\n\nAnd why would they want to? One doesn’t have to look very far to see why. One merely has to look at JCVD—particularly the JCVD we are presented with in the film’s first thirty-three minutes, the one who is presumed guilty until proven innocent. And it doesn’t help merely to say that these particular individuals actually are guilty. The more pertinent question is to ask why they choose – or why, say, increasingly, men of a certain generation and temperament and locale – choose not to take such risks. Even JCVD can sympathize with this.\n\nFilm scholar Barna William Donovan gets at the heart of a male withdrawal from public life:\n\nMen often do not like to publicly address their problems. Interestingly, on the one hand, they watch the morality plays of the action film because it gives voice and shape to their nebulous problem in the world today. Yet, on the other hand, the very language and value systems of these films reinforce the silent models of masculinity, all performed by action stars who wed their public personas to similar images of stoic, uncomplaining toughness. (5)\n\nI will return to a consideration of gender. For now, let me say that a genre of movies which seeks to “voice” silence in this way – that is, in resorting to violence or swift justice or what have you – does indeed suggest that actions speak louder than words. I less cite this illuminating passage to suggest a propensity for males to remain silent breeds interest in action movies than to suggest, conversely, that violence is bred of silencing.\n\nThe sensationalizing of speech, of words, first leads to their failure, hence to the attraction of actions which are said to speak louder than words. When these actions prove inadequate, however, we are left feeling that we have created, or at least further reinforced, the conditions of our own silence. What other response is there than (further) silence? Further violence?\n\nWhen we first hear JCVD at his child custody hearing, near the start of the film, his defence attorney is conspicuously absent. JCVD is forced to pipe up in his own defence. He interjects repeatedly, through a series of jump cuts, as the plaintiff’s attorney begins listing off movie titles which JCVD has starred in during his film career.\n\nEventually, JCVD relents, asking to use the restroom while the pile-on continues. Though the exchange ends comically, JCVD has been effectively silenced. And what is he silenced by? His actions, or, more specifically, his action movies. The DVDs pile up before the judge as some sort of index of (his) moral depravity, and from this, we (or the court, or both) are to assume that he is unfit to be a father.\n\nThe assumption would be that violence breeds violence, or that Van Damme has a history of violence. Is this a form of sensationalism or a reasonable inference? But another sort of suggestion – also scandalous, sensational – is the one made at the beginning of the film, referring to 9/11, where it is suggested that Osama bin Laden got the idea to hijack planes by watching a 1980s Chuck Norris action film (Delta Force, 1986). “Haven’t you ever had an idea just to realize you’ve seen it before?”\n\nWhich is to suggest, either reasonably or unreasonably, that America suffers from its own history of violence, of sensationalizing it, even though no one in the American mass media would care to sensationalize this sort of claim. Indulging or engorging in JCVD’s trials and tribulations, either fictional (in America) or non-fictional (in Europe), is the sort of violent bloodsport all of us play by proxy.\n\nPerhaps this is, and has always been, the function of civil society, so that action movies (as the case has been made) actually purge us of our violent tendencies rather than exacerbate them. But the violence in question here is not the sort carried out on or against corporeal bodies, but the sort carried out on our psychic experience of the world where we understand that we cannot claim or make claim to certain words because we risk causing a sensation.\n\nWhy should things be sensationalized at all? Is it because otherwise we risk asking ourselves questions for which we do not have answers, or, worse, that the answers we come up with we would find unbearable, as though if we go back far enough along the causal chain of events, we will not find a first cause around which to organize being, but an endless regress exposing not only the meaninglessness of our failures, but of our successes as well?\n\nWhat does a French-Arab video store owner know about why he consumes, or peddles (or both) American action films which portray Arabs unflatteringly? His answer – dismissive of the question, that “action films need bad guys” – is both an acknowledgement of a problem at hand and a simultaneous disowning or disavowal of the fact that he has thrived from peddling violence.\n\nI don’t mean he needs to be held to account. I mean the question no longer makes sense, cannot be posed in any serious way because we have no answers, as though addressing the human propensity for violence, for the time being, has been put beyond the reach of language.\n\nLet me here say a few words about mothers, and what I take this film to be saying about mothers. What is conspicuously absent from this film is a strong female lead or supporting role. We do, however, see JCVD’s mother; she pleads with her son not to separate a female hostage from her child. There is an ominous standoff between the man in the leather jacket and JCVD, concerning their relationships to their mothers and, finally, a fatal standoff between the man in the leather jacket and Arthur, the buffoonish security guard who ends up shooting the man in the leather jacket in the forehead after he makes a vulgar comment about his (Arthur’s) mother.\n\nSo despite the absence of women, mothers are very much present in this film—present that is, through their silence, as though our mothers or the memory of our mothers haunts this film. I don’t want to get into a gendered debate about tragedy because it is quite clear to me that taken in the male or female register, what is happening in this film, tragically, is the systematic silencing of both men and women.\n\nYou may say women are held silent from the outset of the film, while men are silenced as the film progresses, which says that the further pacification or feminization of men in (American) cinema has clipped now even its action stars, no longer able to act nor speak. So men too are forced to love and be silent, a stance less expressing female subjectivity than survival. This systematic loss of subjectivities is tragic.\n\nMelanie Klein’s notion – that the infant secretly desires to return to his/her mother’s wombs – is inverted in this movie.[9] That is, the characters in this movie have already returned to the womb: they are inside the bank; what they desire is a way out, to be reborn.\n\nFurthermore, if we think of the raising of the curtain as signalling a rebirth, the first hostage to be let out is not the son but the mother. The mother, subsequently, pleads to go back, as if to start over or again; what she pleads for is a second chance. The desire here (even if a “feminine” desire, males are no less likely to suffer it) is not to withdraw from the world but to give birth or have one’s birth again, divorced from a particular history, under safer passage, as if times are too treacherous now.\n\nThese sorts of re-imaginings – an emergence into the world to start over, having erased the indignities and humiliations of the past – is the sort suffered by JCVD in his imagined exit from the bank, raising his arms to the cheering throngs and pumping his fist in an act of triumph. Yet once the frames of reality begin passing before us again, we can only bear witness to the shame and humiliation of (re)birth, knowing that no one chooses when or what sort of world they are born into.\n\n5. The invention of cinema\n\nPresupposing the answers before the question is the sort of stance taken to ensure the question makes sense. It does not mean we have the answers, but insists the answers are before us, so all one has to do is merely pose a (logical) question and we then follow the steps to reach the intended effect. Otherwise, why pose the question at all?\n\nHere is a final quotation from McLuhan, sketching out somewhat the topography of his Gutenberg galaxy. He is commenting on our discovery of the alphabet and why it is easy now to understand the ramifications of its invention. He begins by discussing not the “discoveries” made (about a given technology and the power it affords us) but the “method of discovery,” or the “method of invention” itself. Indeed, he notes that the “great discovery of the nineteenth century was the discovery of the method of discovery” (45).\n\nThe method of invention … is simply to begin with the solution of the problem or with the effect intended. Then one backtracks, step by step, to the point from which one must begin in order to reach the solution or effect. Such is the method of the detective story, the symbolist poem, and of modern science.\n\nIt is, however, the twentieth century step beyond this method of invention which is needed for understanding the origin and the action of such forms as the wheel or the alphabet. And that step is not the backtracking from product to starting point, but the following of process in isolation from product. To follow the contours of process as in psychoanalysis provides the only means of avoiding the product of process, namely neurosis or psychosis. (45)\n\nSo we have process and product, or, as I see it, questions and answers. To begin with the product we want and backtrack to find the questions suitable to ask is to make process subservient to human needs, desires and wants. We pose the answers, then look for the right sort of questions to ask and this is the method of discovery in the nineteenth century.\n\nThis is true discovery, when we start from nothing and find something. But what happens, inevitably, when we cannot get all the answers we want, when we cannot isolate and identify the causal chain of events that will lead to the product we desire? Or what, as McLuhan says above, if we get some products we do not desire, like neurosis or psychosis? Do we abandon the process?\n\nThe question seems ridiculous, nonsensical, not worth asking. But psychosis still exists. We can follow the contours of process and attempt to circumvent certain effects of process for the time being, but not for eternity. In allowing process to take place, psychosis (for example) is always possible so we have run into a limitation of process, and not because process cannot address something that is, but because process creates something that never was.\n\nIs the violence of cinema a “psychosis” of cinema, so that if cinema is destined to depict passage, process, it is destined to depict certain products of that process not to our liking (such as violence)? And how do we reverse this trend? By following the contours of process perhaps, but this is ultimately defeating because the medium itself demands action. But surely not all action on film need be violent action?\n\nHere is a bit by Noel Carroll discussing medium-specificity, which, at its boldest, predicts where and what subject matter a given medium of art is liable to be successful dealing with, based on preset ontological limitations and/or capabilities of the medium itself.\n\nThe doctrine [of medium-specificity] is … seductive for critics-at-large and ordinary audience members … because it gives them the means to account for why some films fly and others flop. Those that excel are cinematic – that is, they engage in and exploit the distinctive properties of the medium. Those that are insolvent can often be explained away on the grounds that they have failed to take advantage of the special resources and distinctive capabilities of film, often by stumbling into the realm of the medium of an adjacent artform (usually theatre).\n\nThus, someone might claim that the doctrine of medium specificity explains why Hitchcock’s film Psycho is superior to his The Paradine Case. The latter, with all its palaver, crossed over into the domain of theatre, whereas Psycho – remember the shower-sequence montage – is pure cinema (cutting, that is to say, editing, every inch of the way). (His emphasis, 38)\n\nMedium-specificity is not the last word for Carroll. He recognizes many magnificent moments have been captured on film that are both palaver and shot continuously. But something of the promise of cinema is denied when people speak (too much), as if to reflect on life while living life is not our lot to do.\n\nHere is precisely why JCVD is tragic: JCVD reminds us that our lives only make sense to us after they have been lived, and, even then, in such a way that compromises our understanding of what we take process (a life) to be. The action star is attractive because he forgoes a life of dialogue, a life of posing questions, and commits to a life of process, as though one with it, taking the ultimate stance against contingency.\n\nFurthermore, the best way for us to assert our dominance in face of being unable to obtain the answers we want is to pretend that we understand, or are on our way to fully understanding, the particular unfolding of process, which is to hide from the burden of asking questions that may yield no answer or answers we do not expect—in short, to hide from the burden of discovering the world, or being blindsided by it. This line of reasoning suggests it already (fully) exists (somewhere, elsewhere).\n\nPutting our trust in process means we cannot speak to, or are no longer the authors of, our own narratives—that the narrative of our lives is being written elsewhere. We can only uncover our lives; we have no say or stake or authority in its makeup. It is not simply that as the action unfolds, we cannot be fully aware of what we are getting into. Rather, we have no means or right to ask what we are getting into, to demand certain answers and not others. We watch action movies which need bad guys, but beyond that, there is simply nothing else to ask.
