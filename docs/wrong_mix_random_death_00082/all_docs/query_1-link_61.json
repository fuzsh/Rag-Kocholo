Barnum was heavily involved in the business and political circles of his community, became an advocate for temperance after abstaining from alcohol, and built a name for himself which should be recognized and acknowledged beyond his association with the big top and showmanship. Robert Wilson places Barnum's overall life and times in perspective, considers the controversies he sparked throughout his life, and reviews his convictions and moral and ethical foundations. The result is a powerful survey that should be part of not just biography holdings, but any serious American history collection.\n\nThe Philosophy Shelf\n\nBlade Runner 2049 and Philosophy\n\nRobin Bunce and Trip McCrossin, Editors\n\nOpen Court\n\nwww.opencourtbooks.com\n\n9780812694710, $19.95\n\nBlade Runner 2049 and Philosophy: This Breaks the World adds Volume 127 to the Popular Culture and Philosophy series, designed to involve philosophers and non-philosophers alike in the major questions raised in popular culture. Philosophers from different backgrounds and belief systems here provide insights into the classic movie Blade Runner 2049 and its original, examining the nature of reality, ethics, equality, and knowledge of destination in a world of AI and artificial beings. The lively discussions require knowledge of these movies and a basic interest in philosophical questions, but readers with such a background will find much food for thought in these lively considerations which will prove equally engrossing for college-level discussions by film and philosophy students alike.\n\nThe Technology Shelf\n\nHandbook of Radar Scattering Statistics for Terrain\n\nFawwaz T. Ulaby and M. Craig Dobson\n\nArtech House\n\nwww.artechhouse.com\n\n9781630817015, $199.00\n\nHandbook of Radar Scattering Statistics for Terrain is a basic recommended reference for radar and remote sensing engineers, and has been reissued with updated new software for the latest data analysis specs. The original appeared in 1989, so quite some time has passed and technological changes march on. This update has been completely revamped and includes new appendices of reference material for new software, a focus on Python- and MATLAB-based software uses, and connections between the statistics of the original book and the update presented in this edition. The software was previously sold separately, but its bundling into this book package creates an invaluable reference.\n\nThe General Fiction Shelf\n\nDead Man Dreaming\n\nUday Mukerji\n\nAdelaide Books\n\nwww.adelaidebooks.org\n\n9781950437634, $19.60\n\nPhysician, heal thyself! David is a successful senior resident physician on the cusp of success when everything is threatened by his positive test for Huntington's chorea, which sends him on a downward spiral as he struggles with health issues, losing his love, and redefining his life. How characters handle what circumstance gives them - even life-threatening diseases - is one mark of a good read if the story is done right. Dead Man Dreaming is particularly thorough and poignant in its discussions of life, death, and the choices that lie in-between. It's a solid, absorbing read highly recommended for readers interested in the foundations of choice in navigating the pitfalls of life and medical challenges - one that superbly examines the foundations of good choices that stem from bad situations.\n\nNo One's Home\n\nD.M. Pulley\n\nhttps://www.dmpulley.com\n\nThomas & Mercer\n\nwww.apub.com\n\n97815420401546, $15.95\n\nNo One's Home is the item of choice for anyone who enjoys a good haunted house story, and tells of a couple new to town who seek a fresh start. Of course, they buy an old mansion rumored to be haunted and find themselves in over their heads, but the most compelling part of this story is its focus on not just the house's notorious history and its haunted side, but how secrets from the past tie into family tensions to move in dangerous directions. Readers who enjoy the rare ghost story that focus on psychological suspense over blood-letting will find No One's Home is more satisfyingly literary and compelling that much of the modern competition.\n\nThe Mystery/Suspense Shelf\n\nA Killer Edition\n\nLorna Barrett\n\nBerkley Prime Crime\n\nwww.penguinrandomhouse.com\n\n9781984802729, $26.00\n\nA Killer Edition provides a fine Booktown Mystery that tells of a bookstore owner whose time is freed up by her assistant.
