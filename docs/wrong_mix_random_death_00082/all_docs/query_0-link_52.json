        "text": "Author: Heathcote Pursuit\n\nBevan Harris becomes Billy Bevan (1887-1957)\n\nAbove: Billy Bevan without makeup, in 1923.\n\nThe 5 second version\n\nBorn in Orange in New South Wales in 1887, Billy Bevan (William Bevan Harris) is hardly a forgotten Australian actor. He has been credited with over 260 appearances in Hollywood movies made between about 1916 and 1952, and his success there has been very well documented.\n\nHe was 25 years old when he arrived in North America in 1912, with a good reputation as an amateur in Australia. His arrival in the US was courtesy a contract with Nellie Chester‘s Pollard’s Juvenile Opera Company. This, and his subsequent experience as a vaudevillian in the US refined his skills. He first appeared in films in 1915 or 1916, but really made a name for himself working for the Mack Sennett studio after 1919. With the advent of sound he took supporting and bit character roles – often playing a cockney.\n\nHe moved to Escondido in San Diego County in the early 1930s, and increasingly took an interest in farming and conservation. He died there in 1957.\n\n(This article does not list all of his many films, but links to some that are online can be found in the references)\n\nAccounts regarding the birth of William Bevan Harris are sometimes inconsistent, although we know he was born in Orange, New South Wales, a provincial city about 250 kilometres west of Sydney in 1887. However, further confusing matters – he did not settle on the stage name of Billy Bevan until late 1914. In the meantime, he had used the stage names Bevan Harris in Australia and later Willie Bevan while with Pollards. See also Note 1 below.\n\nNot withstanding his later success in Hollywood, his early life was firmly rooted in regional New South Wales. His father was Robert Harris, at the time of his birth a manager at Lindsay’s Brewery Co in Orange. His mother was a local Orange girl – Marion Jane Torpy, the oldest daughter of local politician James Torpy. Robert and Marion Harris can be traced living in Orange as late as 1904.\n\nVarious sources suggest Bevan attended the University of Sydney, but if he did, he failed to complete any study, as his name (or any combination of it) does not appear in its database of graduates and similar claims of University study were made of his contemporary Leon Errol. Rather, it appears he had been bitten by the performance bug and was appearing on stage even before he moved to Sydney.\n\nBevan Harris on stage in Australia\n\nFrom mid 1909, Bevan Harris appeared in musical comedies with the Petersham Choral Society, a Sydney amateur group. These included Ermine and San Toy. Dated and offensive though readers today might find San Toy, (a “Chinese musical” of English origins), Bevan was a hit as Li, one of the central characters, and his “grotesque antics” kept the audience “convulsed with laughter.”\n\nBy early 1911 Bevan was working in Melbourne, while appearing with the Melbourne Comic Opera Society at the Princess Theatre, in the musical comedies Olivette, and then Miss Hook of Holland. Judging by the very short runs and wide variety of appearances, it would seem he was not yet a professional, although he was developing an enviable reputation as a comic. He may well be the same William Bevan Harris who was listed in Melbourne electoral roles of the time – working as a clerk by day and living in a boarding house in Powlett Street, East Melbourne.\n\nIn July 1912, Bevan Harris signed a contract with Nellie Chester to perform with a reconstituted Pollard’s Opera Company tour of Canada and the United States. Nellie Chester had previous experience running Pollard’s Lilliputian Opera Company tours of North America with her older brother Charles Pollard, until 1909. This tour, it would be the last, was designed to address new Australian labour laws restricting the age children could leave to perform overseas, which was in turn a direct result of Arthur Pollard’s disastrous 1909 Tour of India.\n\nWillie Bevan with Pollard’s Juveniles in North America\n\nThe SS Makura arrived in Vancouver in late August 1912, with Bevan and about 25 Australian performers on board. Newspaper reviews show that this new company followed Pollard’s well-travelled performance route – east across Canada and sometimes into the northern states of the US, and then back to Vancouver again. The repertoire included familiar, popular musicals – The Mikado, The Belle of New York, Sergeant Brue, The Toy Maker and La Belle Butterfly. Not surprisingly, the cities the troupe visited welcomed a return of a Pollard’s company, even if they all seemed a little older. There were complicated explanations provided to newspapers regarding how the troupe had “grown up.” The truth was it was now illegal for girls under 18 or boys under 16 to leave Australia to perform in such troupes. Teddy McNamara was nineteen years old, while Bevan was the oldest of the troupe, aged twenty-five – although he claimed to be 22.\n\nThe new troupe comprised a mix of experienced Pollard performers – Teddy McNamara and Eva Pollard – while newcomers included “Queenie” Williams and Bevan. But significantly, they were all no longer pre-teens, or “Lilliputians.” Although all Australians, and mostly from Melbourne, they were now all older, experienced but still juvenile performers. The choice of Willie Bevan as a stage name at this time might relate to a need to sound like a younger performer. Reviews of the Pollards performances were generally positive, and Bevan was noted as a clever comedian, but the focus of publicity was on Queenie and Teddy McNamara.\n\nBevan stayed with the company for fourteen months, making his departure after a tour of Alaska in late 1913. The Pollards tour of North America was, to that time, his most intensive experience on stage. He then joined a series of stock companies – reportedly the Isabelle Fletcher Company in Vancouver, then Lewis and Wolf in Arizona and the Trimble Players in California. And briefly in mid 1914, he joined forces with other Australian expats Daphne Pollard and Alf Goulding for A Knight for a Day at the Morosco Theatre in Los Angeles.\n\nBilly Bevan making Movies\n\nSometime in late 1915, Billy Bevan drifted from vaudeville to working in films. It is quite likely Henry Lehrman, the head of L-KO Studios (standing for Lehrman Knock Out) had seen him and was the one who offered him work. His earliest films include Dad’s Dollars and Dirty Doings, Lizzie’s Shattered Dreams, Lizzie’s Lingering Love, A Bold Bad Breeze, Phoney Friends and False Teeth and Gertie’s Gasoline Glide. His appearances in these early films appear to be in bit and supporting roles – such as a brief appearance as the Minister in Gertie’s Gasoline Glide. Historians Kalton C Lahue and Sam Gill describe these L-KO films as “rapid-fire slapstick,” but they were also highly derivative – of established vaudeville stage acts – and of other films. Lehrman himself was typical of the “colourful” showmen who inhabited the early world of comedy cinema.\n\nAfter films at other studios, Bevan began working for Mack Sennett in mid 1919. Brent Walker’s 2010 survey of the Mack Sennett studios lists Bevan’s known films, and also explains that he took “short term contracts… by choice.” This allowed him to maintain control of his career – he could freelance when feature films took his fancy. It is beyond the scope of this article to review Bevan’s significant output of films for Sennett, however it would seem Steve Massa’s summary of his work is apt. Most often he was either a “comic everyman that everything happened to… [or] a roguish, practical joker who caused misfortunes to befall others.” Some of the Bevan’s Sennett classics are now easily accessible online (many are listed below) and include Butter Fingers (1925), Super-Hooper-Dyne-Lizzies (1925) and Wandering Willies (1926). The walrus moustache and perpetually raised eyebrows were a trademark.\n\nBevan’s shift to character work in feature films appears to have been incremental, and coincided with the arrival of sound. In part, this must have been because he was financially secure and no longer needed as much work. Most importantly though, he was also pursuing other interests. (See below) However, studios still had a need for solid reliable character actors, and this became his speciality – as butlers, policemen, bus and train conductors, porters, taxi-drivers and doormen. And when interviewed by the Australian press in 1939, Bevan explained “This is the highest paying business in the world… Of course one fine morning, like every other actor, I’ll wake up and though I may not know it, I’ll have done my last day’s work in pictures.”\n\nAs an Australian-born actor he was sometimes called upon to morph himself into a cockney role in Hollywood’s sentimental British films of the 1930s and 40s. The list of Hollywood films about Britain or the British Empire that featured Bevan includes Journey’s End (1930), Cavalcade (1933), The Lost Patrol (1934) Last Outpost (1939) and Another Dawn (1939), in addition to several of Universal’s Sherlock Holmes films – Pearl of Death (1944) and Terror by Night (1946). Interestingly, he also appeared in small roles in two of Hollywood’s awful Australian “Bushranger films” of the 1930s – Stingaree (1934) and Hal Roach’s Captain Fury (1939). His final screen appearances were in 1952.\n\nBilly Bevan on the land.\n\nBevan’s interest in farming and the land is quite well documented by Brent Walker and others. He had purchased land at Escondido in California in the mid 1920s, and established a citrus and avocado farm, eventually moving there permanently and only returning to Hollywood (about 160 kms to the North west) to work on films. He was very active in the local community, taking a leading role in the Escondido soil conservation district, and the local fish and game association. In these, his interests paralleled those of his father Robert Harris, back in Australia. For most of his later life, Robert Harris had worked for Goldsbrough, Mort & Co, a large Australian agricultural firm, which through various amalgamations exists today as Elders Limited. Even if estranged or just separated by distance, when Harris died in North Sydney in June 1927, his headstone at Macquarie Park cemetery noted it had been “erected by his son William Bevan Harris, Hollywood USA.” Bevan’s mother Marion moved to the US in 1916 and appears to have stayed. She died at Bevan’s home in 1945.\n\nBevan married his first wife Leona Roberts (Kohn) in 1917. Two daughters were born of the union. Coincidentally, Leona’s actress sister, Edith Roberts, travelled to Fiji and Australia in 1928 to appear in Norman Dawn’s The Adorable Outcast, aka Black Cargos of the South Seas\n\nBilly Bevan died quite suddenly at his Escondido home, Rancho La Lomita, in November 1957. He was survived by his second wife Betty and his two daughters by Leona, who had predeceased him in 1952.\n\nNote 1 – Billy Bevan’s name\n\nThe birth certificate for William Bevan Harris states the child is listed as not named, presumably because his parents had yet to agree on a name. However, the name William Bevan does appear – in a different script and fainter handwriting – on his birth record, while later documents also confirm this was his name. In addition to the varying stage names already noted, and causing more confusion to historians today, on his 1918 US naturalisation declaration he seems to indicate he was using the name William Bevan – without Harris.\n\nNick Murphy\n\n29 June 2023\n\nReferences\n\nText\n\nKalton C Lahue & Sam Gill (1970) Clown Princes and Court Jesters.

Courtesy Australian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne.\n\nThe Five Second Version\n\nLate in life and living in London, former actor and playwright Enid Hollins became an occasional correspondent with English papers – making suggestions about writing for the stage and correcting details of the past – including the fact that she had been the first actress to play the lead role in a production of GB Shaw’s The Millionairess in the English language.\n\nFew Australians or New Zealanders have made the transition from actor to playwright in their own country, let alone another country, as Enid Hollins did. Notable for some great successes acting on the Australian and New Zealand stage in the mid 1930s – she travelled to London in 1939. After war work and appearing in rep in the UK, she turned to writing for the stage and radio in the early 1950s. The tragic death of her husband in 1956 changed her circumstances and brought her career to a sudden end, although she wrote again for radio in the mid 1960s. She managed a publicity agency in London and died there in 1980.\n\nEnid Naumai Hollins was born in Christchurch, New Zealand in June 1904. Her parents were George Frederick Hollins, a public accountant, and Jean nee Annan. Sometime in her first few years, the family relocated to Melbourne Australia. Previously associated with the Salvation Army, George and Jean moved address in Melbourne regularly. During Enid’s schooling they lived at the very grand Queen’s Coffee Palace (a residential temperance hotel) at 1 Rathdowne Street Carlton.\n\nEnid completed her schooling at Methodist Ladies College in Kew, Melbourne in 1921 and on leaving, threw herself into amateur theatre. She directed several productions for the MLC Old Collegian’s Drama club, including Alfred Sutro’s The Desperate Lovers in 1928, apparently the comedy’s first Australian outing.\n\nOn stage in Australia\n\nBy late 1928 she had found work as a professional, a supporting role in the cast of the “clean and wholesome” comedy When Knights Were Bold at the Palace Theatre in Melbourne. If she ever had any doubts, this experience probably convinced her the stage was the place she wanted to be. Leading the company were English players working in Australia – including Compton Coutts(1886-1935) and Campbell Copelin(1901-1988), alongside Australians Nancye Stewart(1893-1973) and Agnes Dobson(1904-1987). And in May 1929, she landed a role as “a Movie Vamp” in Frank Neil’s(1886-1940) production of the farce Ladies Night in a Turkish Bath. A short engagement to visiting English musician Harold Lyons meant she briefly considered plans to travel to London to marry. But she did not marry Lyons.\n\nCensus and voter rolls show she turned to clerical work to get through the worst of the Depression, which is not so surprising, given how dire the economic situation was in Australia. Over the next few years she appeared in amateur theatre again – and can be found in cast lists for productions at Kelvin Hall. She was also closely associated with producer-director Brett Randall(1884-1963) and the Little Theatre (at St Chad’s, in Martin Street, South Yarra). In April 1935 she married fellow actor Jack Wiltshire at the Little Theatre, with considerable publicity.\n\nIn 1935, seven years after her first appearances on the professional stage, she emerged again as an actor to be noticed. Through her membership of the Power House Dramatic Club, which performed at the Garrick Theatre, she appeared in Sorry You’ve been troubled, and London Wall, and received good reviews. In early 1936, she had a major breakthrough when Producer-Director Gregan McMahon(1874-1941) chose her for the leading role in George Bernard Shaw‘s The Millionairess. Shaw had given the rights to Greghan McMahon, in recognition of his long standing support and this was the play’s first English-language performance.\n\nWhile the play was not regarded as Shaw’s best, Enid’s strong performance was well received. Table Talk reported\n\n“The acting was dominated … by the magnificent performance of Enid Hollins as the disappointed heiress whose father has only left her a beggarly 30 millions instead of the 200 millions he promised her. This young actress, who has been recruited from the amateur ranks, handled her exceedingly difficult role with ease and confidence, and despite the fact that she was on the stage, and the central figure in it, practically from curtain rise to curtain fall, never once did she show the slightest sign of strain, or reveal herself as anything but perfectly at home in the part.“\n\nBy the end of March 1936, she was appearing in a production of an Emlyn Williams mystery thriller – Night Must Fall, which toured through east coast Australian theatres, and then through New Zealand. In the leading role as “baby-faced Dan” the murderer, was Lloyd Lamble(1914-2008), who recalled his affair with Enid in a rather unkind anecdote, in his memoirs. Another New Zealand tour followed, with comedies like Fresh Fields added to the repertoire. Enid’s JC Williamson’s contract notes her modest weekly salary in March 1936 as £7 10 shillings.\n\nEnid was now established as a regular on the Australian and New Zealand stage – performing for Brett Randall in “pleasant comedies” such as Ivor Novello‘s Full House, and appearing in full blown JC Williamson musicals like Over She Goes – and touring again. She began divorce proceedings against Jack Wiltshire in early 1939. Then, with a great deal of fanfare, she departed Australia in April 1939, bound for London on the SS Monterey and via the US. She arrived in London in June.\n\nThe very thorough US manifest for the Monterey records Enid’s above average height of 5’9″ (175 cms). She had brown eyes and brown hair, and an “olive” complexion.\n\nWorking in Britain\n\nIf the Depression delayed Enid’s career on the Australian stage, the outbreak of the Second World War did the same to her in Britain. Like so many who had arrived from around the Empire before the war, Enid felt duty bound to contribute to the British war effort. In 1941 she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service, the women’s branch of the British Army, working in Signals. In the same year she married Neil Smith, an officer in the Royal Army Ordinance Corps.\n\nAfter demobilisation, she returned to the stage again to perform in repertory, but only a few years later she outlined the challenge for Australian actors seeking work in Britain – a challenge that she herself had faced. In a short and very pointed article carried by Melbourne’s Herald newspaper, headed “warning to young actors”, she wrote\n\n“There isn’t an Australian actor or actress who doesn’t want to come to England. Yet how many of them have the least idea of what they are coming to? In Great Britain the theatrical profession is very overcrowded. During the war many new people entered it to entertain troops and workers in industry.” Work in repertory companies was vital she explained: “The Australian who comes here — and they come in droves—rarely gets a London engagement… Agents simply will not look at you without repertory experience and this you must find for yourself.”\n\nIt would seem her antipodean successes counted for little.\n\nEnid was not the only Australian actor to find post-war Britain hard going and it is not surprising that she turned to writing. Dorothy Alison(1925-1992), who had arrived in London in 1949, did three years of office work in London while waiting for stage work, while Betty McDowall(1924-1993), who arrived in 1951, described working as an actor in London as “tough as hell”. Enid must have been pleased that her play Consented Together, won a £100 prize in a playwrights competition in August 1950. The play centred around a contemporary theme, an aspect of British marriage laws – that prohibited a woman from marrying her divorced husband’s brother.\n\nIt is worthy of note that in early 1950 Enid thanked two production companies for feedback on her work. Perhaps it was intended to attract attention, but as she named them publicly – Linnit & Dunfree and Laurence Olivier Productions, it is quite likely to be true. Writing experience in Australia had already been hinted at before she departed. She had written short stories under a nom de plume according to one report, although further details of this remain elusive.\n\nOver the early 1950s, Enid’s plays were often performed at the Gateway Theatre at 103 Westbourne Grove W2 (in the Notting Hill district) and sometimes she also directed these. One of London’s small club theatres, it survived on subscriptions and very low overheads. It was also sometimes responsible for original or avant-garde plays being staged, and seems to have been one of the locations where female writers could get their work performed. Enid’s final appearance as an actor at the Gateway seems to date to 1952, when she appeared in the new play Worm I’ the Bud, giving “an excellent cameo-study of a not very wise but kind and deservedly privileged servant.”\n\nMother is a Darling, the play Enid was best known for, first appeared in March 1951 at the New Theatre in Bromley, south of London. Former silent actress Bessie Love took the leading role of the mother – Mrs Lander – in the three act family or “drawing room” comedy. The humour revolved around her three young daughters “tackling the business of running a home and [managing] their scatterbrained mother.” A year later – in January 1952, Frenchie and the Lily, “a modern love story about two young delinquents” ran at the Gateway. In the cast of these productions were a mix of up and coming actors, including a few Australians – like Vincent Ball, fresh from his RADA course and looking for opportunities.\n\nEnid also wrote for radio. Her 60 minute play The Huntress appeared on BBC radio in December 1951, The Brother in February 1952. Her radio play Passport to Yesterday, a thriller, was performed in 1954 – in Britain, South Africa and Australia. The tale of an English girl who wakes up on a beach but does not know who she is or how she got there, it was filmed for television in 1959, under the title Girl on the Beach, with a young Maggie Smith taking the lead role.\n\nThe tragic drowning of her husband while holidaying in Spain in 1956 wrought a great change in her life. Enid turned to managing his publicity agency – Portman Services Ltd. Under her management the business was a success, although how she felt about leaving her theatrical career we do not know. In 1966-7 she returned to writing for radio – a series of dramatizations with the title Scandal! for the BBC, in collaboration with British writer Fiona McConnell.\n\nExcept for her one published script, we have little surviving today to help inform us of the nature of her written work. The newspaper reviews were mixed, and none of her plays were produced in major West End theatres. One 1952 writer noted a lack of consistency in her writing in its review of Frenchy and the Lily. It described the play as excellent at times, “but at other [times] it descended to the depths of the very poor.” Yet her best known piece – Mother is a Darling – toured widely in British rep and was generally well received, later being performed in Australia. HFW Deane and Sons published it in their Deane’s Series of Plays in 1954. We also know her writing was deemed good enough for radio and television productions and yet we know that at the time these media were desperate for content.\n\nThrough the 1950s and 60s, Enid maintained occasional correspondence on theatre matters with newspapers. In a letter to The Stage in 1964 regarding complaints of a lack of industry support made by fellow female scriptwriter Jean Rennie, she dismissed the complaint and remarked that “When a script comes back to me I know I have only myself to blame.”\n\nEnid maintained membership of Actor’s Equity and the Writer’s Guild all her life. She also took to styling herself Enid Neil-Smith, perhaps in remembrance of her husband. Her politics were firmly of the left, as were Neil’s, both were active members of the Labour Party – determined to improve life in post-war Britain.\n\nEnid Hollins died at her London home in 1980. She had no children. Her older brother Stanley had also appeared on the stage in Australia in the 1930s, but had long since turned to other interests. Enid returned to Australia at least once, for a long and anonymous holiday, in early 1964.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nMay 2023\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nClaudia Funder at the Australian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne, Australia.\n\nStacey Coenders, Archivist at MLC, Kew, Victoria, Australia.\n\nReferences\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nAustralian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne\n\nNational Library of New Zealand, Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa, Papers Past.\n\nNational Library of Australia, Trove\n\nState Library of Victoria\n\nBritish Newspaper Archive\n\nAncestry.com\n\nVictoria, Births Deaths & Marriages\n\nNew Zealand, Births Deaths & Marriages\n\nProQuest Historical Newspapers\n\nText\n\nStephen Alomes (1999) When London Calls.

She was one of a string of young Australian women from middle class backgrounds, who made their way to the new world of international theatre and film production, armed with serious training in elocution and the dramatic arts. She arrived in the US in late 1928, and performed on stage in Canada and in the US, before appearing in her first credited film role in 1932. Following more stage and radio performances in the US and wartime service as an entertainer, she returned to Australia in the late 1940s to perform on tour and to see her father and sister.\n\nFinis notably avoided the publicity usually associated with actors of the era, despite her long career on the US stage and having appeared in (at least) a dozen Hollywood films. She disappeared completely from public life soon after her return to the US from Australia. She died in New York in February 1979, aged 68.\n\nBorn in Western Australia in January 1911, Finis Ernestine Barton was the second daughter of Ernest William Barton, a ship’s officer working for the Melbourne Steamship Company, and Minnie Mary Barton nee Leitch. Some time during the First World War, the family moved across the Australian continent to Sydney. At least some of Finis’ activities as a teenager are recorded by contemporary documents, including that the family lived in McMahon’s Point on Sydney’s north shore, and that she attended North Sydney Girls’ High School. By late 1923, she was also featuring as a star student at Grace Stafford’s school of elocution and dramatic arts in Sydney. Reportedly, she was also a capable horse rider.\n\nAs Desley Deacon has written, in the early part of the twentieth century, elocution in Australia was not “just a private accomplishment for girls and young women. Instead it legitimized public performance and encouraged ambition…it inculcated discipline and taught colonial girls marketable skills.” Enid Bennett, Judith Anderson, Sylvia Bremer and Dorothy Cumming had all arrived in the US during the First World War with well honed elocution skills thanks to a thriving tutoring industry in Australia. To this list could be added others, like Marcia Ralston, who had also gained training in Australian radio in the mid 1920s. Radio experience was also the case with Finis Barton, who had appeared on Sydney radio station 2BL with the very popular children’s host, “Uncle” George Saunders.\n\nThere was however, a sudden and unexplained change to Finis’ circumstances when her mother Minnie packed up and left for San Francisco, in September 1927. About a year later, in November 1928, 17 year old Finis sailed to San Francisco on the SS Makura to visit her, on a temporary visa “for pleasure.” Not surprisingly, Finis stayed on in Los Angeles with her mother, who was a tall, blue eyed Australian with a scar over her left eye, and who by 1929 had become assistant manager at the newly built Chalfonte Apartment Hotel at 720 South Normandie.\n\nThe 1930 US census listed Finis as a “dancer in movies.” What these movies were is now unknown – presumably she was appearing in film chorus-lines, as her IMDB entry states. However, in 1931 she made a breakthrough – first in performances with the “Hollywood Playmakers” in Los Angeles, and then professionally with the British Theatre Guild in Vancouver – performing in comedies based on works by the likes of PG Wodehouse and AA Milne. With her in this company for a time was fellow West Australian Marjorie Bennett. By May 1932, Finis was back in Hollywood having been cast in a supporting role in the Tom Mix film My Pal, the King. Universal Studio’s publicity department went into the usual overdrive with creative stories – reporting she “was a find,” had been elected a “Miss Australia” in 1931, and they almost certainly arranged for popular artist Willy Pogany to paint her portrait at the same time. The “Australian Motion Picture Guild” reportedly welcomed her at one of their monthly meetings at the Biltmore hotel.\n\nBy mid 1932 and with the advent of sound films, Finis was noted for her “captivating voice and manner” and she was now usually introduced to newspaper and magazine readers as a “beautiful new ingenue.” This flattering label was regularly applied to young women who had just arrived in Hollywood, amongst them other Australians like Jocelyn Howarth (aka Constance Worth) and Mary Maguire. One could argue the films she made over the next four years were a typical underwhelming mix of secondary and uncredited roles in B (secondary film) productions, that were so often the lot of these young women. There is a sense, however, that Finis was selective with her work. Most notably, she kept up appearances on stage during the period 1932-1936, at the same time she appeared in films. The plays she appeared in during the 1930s reflect the typical popular fare of the era – farces and comedies, like Ian Hay’s The Middle Watch, performed at the Music Box (now Fonda) Theatre in May 1934. But there were also roles in dramas, like Ibsen’s Hedda Gabler, performed in March 1933, also at the Music Box.\n\nFinis moved to Vancouver again for the first five months of 1934, appearing for the “International Players,” in a string of light comedies such as Scrambled Wives and Believe Me Xantippe. Doubtless also thanks to her speech training, she began to appear on radio in the mid 1930s. She had married William J Ryan in Hollywood in June 1933, but in 1934 in Canada she met actor Blair Davies, who became her second husband in mid 1936.\n\nTypical of her film roles of this era is Sensation Hunters (1933). In this, Finis played the very minor role of sister to the cad Hal Grayson, who briefly takes an interest in the leading character, Dale Jordan. The Grayson family would have been quickly recognised by cinema audiences as self absorbed snobs – suitable foils for the down-to-earth, hard working Dale, who triumphs in the end.\n\nAbove: Finis (as Miss Grayson) teases her brother Hal while dancing with him in Sensation Hunters – in the scene shown at right above.\n\nFinis’s last films were made in 1936, two of these being with Australian born J.P McGowan. McGowan had already been in the US for thirty years and had enjoyed a long career as an actor and director. But Australian readers should avoid the temptation of thinking the experienced McGowan might have been lending the 25 year old Finis “a helping hand” in getting leading roles. There is really no evidence this happened at all during Hollywood’s golden years – and it only occasionally happens in the 21st century.\n\nAbove: Finis (as Dale) tricks the wicked Matt Stevens (J.P McGowan) in Stampede (1936) in the scene shown at right above.\n\nThe two films with McGowan were her last. Her loss of interest in film work may have been because she was disappointed in some of the reviews she received. For example, in 1936 Variety recorded that she made “no impression” as the heroine of Secret Patrol. However, this writer tends to the view that after giving it a try, she probably made a conscious effort not to pursue film work in Hollywood – because it was famously so frustrating and ultimately unrewarding. Janet Johnson, Margaret Vyner, Carol Coombe and Gwen Munro had all walked away from Hollywood in the mid 1930s for this reason. But there was no public commentary about this – as with so much of her life, we are forced to rely on a handful of official documents and newspaper accounts.\n\nFinis now threw herself back into stage and radio work. The featured photo at the top of this article dates from 1937, when she became a featured star of the Columbia radio workshop.\n\nIt is also from this time that Finis began to use the stage name Virginia Barton. Yet again, the change was accompanied by none of the awkward publicity that might be expected. No explanation was provided, she just started appearing under her new stage name – touring the US east coast and Canada in popular comedies like Bachelor Born, Mr and Mrs North and Meet the Wife, sometimes in the company of Blair Davies. The 1940 US census recorded the couple living at the King Edward Hotel in Manhattan. However, in October 1944 US newspapers reported she was to be part of a USO troupe taking comedies to US forces overseas. The United Service Organisation provided a huge program of entertainment for US forces in World War Two, and still exists today.\n\nVirginia Barton was one of a number of actors enticed back home to take leading roles on stage tours in post-war Australia. As with Mercia Swinburne, Molly Fisher and Fred Conyngham, the return home meant a chance to see family as well as enjoy as an attractive contract. On her return to Australia in late 1946 to perform in the comedy Life with Father, the enthusiasm of local press was such that she was finally forced to provide greater details of her life. She spoke with great modesty about her performances with the USO that had taken her to entertain US forces around the world – England, Europe, Africa and South America. The thought of any actor performing Blithe Spirit and Bachelor Born on Ascension Island in the South Atlantic in wartime is extraordinary, and yet it appears she did this too.\n\nA starstruck Australian journalist for The Australian Women’s Weekly could not help but comment on her beauty, her voice and her endearing personality: “Virginia Barton, a honey-blonde… has a delicate, winning grace and charmingly modulated voice that should make her an ideal… always triumphant mother of Life With Father. You could tell, that first day, that the children of the cast are going to adore her. She pays them the compliment of talking to them as adults, is gentle and kind in helping them follow stage directions. And she’s very, very pretty. During her… absence from the land of her birth Virginia Barton has forgotten quite a lot of things,[but] has acquired a gentle, only just noticeable American accent.\n\nVirginia Barton returned to New York in August 1947. She married again, in Connecticut in June 1951, to Ferdinand Wolf, a New York attorney. Now aged 40, she appears to have decided to leave acting behind for good. Of her later life sadly we know little – although there is evidence of regular travel to the Caribbean. Records seem to suggest that as late as 1960 she was still not a US citizen, travelling with Australian travel documents.\n\nShe died in New York on 17 February 1979.\n\nNICK MURPHY\n\nApril 2023\n\nFurther Reading\n\nText\n\nDesley Deacon (2013) Australasian Journal of Victorian Studies.

Baby Ivy Ward, Rosheen Glenister, Miriam Battista and Baby Lorna Volare are names unknown to us now and yet in the 1910s and 1920s they were much in demand by producers, popular with audiences – and their parents were well paid. Lorna Volare was a child from Australia whose parents had moved to the US in 1915. Lorna appeared in her first film at age four and a half, only a few months after the family settled in New Jersey.\n\nLorna Volare was born in Benalla, a country town about 200 kilometres north east of Melbourne, Victoria on 10 October, 1911. However, there is little likelihood that Lorna ever had much memory of Benalla, or of Melbourne, as she left Australia before she turned four.\n\nFred Volare and the pianolas\n\nLorna’s father Fred Volare was a piano tuner, salesman and musician from England. He was born George Frederick Voller in London, and arrived in Australia in the first years of the twentieth century. Perhaps the new spelling of his surname as Volare helped create an exotic musical persona or maybe the change of name helped him start a completely new life, either way he quickly made a name for himself in Australia.\n\nFred travelled the length and breadth of Victoria tuning pianos and selling the new and very popular invention – the pianola. Four months before the birth of Lorna, in June 1911, he had married Helen McIntrye, a nurse – who came from a very large farming family of Port Campbell, in Victoria’s west. A son, Erling Frederick, was also born of the marriage in June 1914.\n\nIn early 1915, Fred and Helen made the dramatic decision to move to the US. This appears not to have been a whim, because they sold up all their belongings and their large home at 245 Williams Road Toorak with an announcement they were soon moving to the US. The advertisements listed their worldly goods for sale, confirming they were living a comfortable middle class life – apparently all thanks to Fred’s work selling pianolas. They sailed on the RMS Niagara, arriving in Vancouver on April 10, 1915, in transit for New York.\n\nBy 1920, US records show the family were living on Lake Avenue, Scotch Plains near Westfield in New Jersey. Fred, who was now described in documents as a “factory manager” and “piano expert”, worked at the Aeolian Piano and Pianola Company factory in nearby Garwood, New Jersey, only a few miles from their home.\n\nLorna the “three year old”\n\nThe earliest film appearance by Lorna seems to have been in Ransom, a film starring Julia Dean, made in late 1915. Unfortunately, the film is now considered lost, as are most of Lorna’s 14 other films.\n\nThe only account of how four year old Lorna from Australia ended up in films survives in the pages of The Green Book Magazine. The story given here was that a group of actors on the Niagara saw Lorna playing on the decks and suggested (to her parents) that she should try acting. Perhaps this is true, but it is so very similar to every other “actor discovery” story that the modern reader would be wise to treat it with caution. It is worth remembering that the decision for four year old Lorna to act was made by Fred and Helen, who must have approved of and organised her performing. The typical story of a child being “discovered” by someone else meant parents could claim they were harnessing a child’s natural ability – rather than exploiting them by pushing them onto the stage.\n\nContemporary newspapers made much of Lorna’s youth. Until late 1916, US reports inaccurately gave her age as three, while some also made a point of mentioning her film salary as $100 per week, a significant sum – which was mentioned so often it may be true. If she earned this, it was her parents who collected.\n\nAt this time, the Gerry Society (New York’s Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children) was very active in campaigning against child actors, something Fred and Helen must have been aware of. However, it appears the society had much more of a concern about the morality of children being on the stage, than they did about children appearing in film. On one occasion Lorna Volare and other juvenile actors were the subject of legal action during a Chicago run of Daddies in November 1919, because the play violated Illinois State law, but otherwise her childhood acting career seems to have been remarkably unhindered by the Gerry Society. Also see Note 1 below.\n\nLorna the actor\n\nSome of Lorna’s appearances were in quality film productions. For example, she appeared in supporting roles in three films made in New York by the hugely successful actress-producer Norma Talmadge in 1917. These included The Law of Compensation and two of her “Select Pictures,” The Moth and The Secret of the Storm Country. Clearly Talmadge had confidence in Lorna’s abilities as she personally cast some roles. In the same year Lorna also appeared in A Man and the Woman, directed by pioneer director Alice Guy and her husband Herbert Blaché, almost certainly made at their Solax Studios at nearby Fort Lee in New Jersey.\n\nAs with so many reviews of child performers, reports of Lorna’s acting in films tended to be effusive. Motion picture directories also contributed to the stereotype of the time by describing her physical attributes – “golden brown hair, large blue eyes.” More considered were commentaries on her theatre performances. In October 1917 she appeared in a short run of the play The Claim, at New York’s Fulton theatre, “a drama of Western life.” One newspaper ran a large photo and reported on “Youthful Lorna Volare, whose years number barely five, but whose histrionic and emotional ability amazed first night audiences on Broadway last week.” But Lorna’s big breakthrough came in September 1918 when she appeared on stage in David Belasco’s production of Daddies.\n\nDaddies was a great success – it ran for 340 performances in New York. The comedy was about four bachelors who are induced to adopt war orphans, and 7 year old Lorna played one of them. Theatre magazine noted her “accent betrays no locale proving her diction is faultless.” The Billboard labelled Lorna “the star of the cast,” while a reviewer for The Brooklyn Daily Eagle wrote that Lorna performed “with a skill and sense of values that is remarkable in a child.”\n\nDavid Belasco thought Lorna was a “marvellous child actor... “I have only known one child who equalled her. That was little Maude Adams. Maude had the same charm, the same bright mind, the same odd little ways that were all her own.” A happy home environment was vital to her continuing success, he thought. However Belasco was less confident that a married woman could be a success on stage. Firmly channeling his own nineteenth century upbringing, he warned, a woman “cannot serve two masters.”\n\nLorna continued to appear on stage, including in a tour of Daddies. She also appeared in one final film made in 1921- His Greatest Sacrifice, with popular player William Farnum. She was now ten years old and hardly able to still be presented as “baby Lorna” by this time and therein lay the problem for all child actors – what to do once they started to grow up.\n\nIn Lorna’s case, almost as quickly as she had arrived on the screen, by the end of 1923, she was gone.\n\nLorna in later life\n\nFrom 1924, Lorna attended secondary school at Westfield High School, near her home. We know a little of Lorna’s school years because her High School yearbook has been digitized – a project of the Ancestry genealogical organisation. Her 1929 entry indicates she was involved in drama at school, had a “charming accent” (doubtless the result of parenting and elocution) and had an amazing biography. It appears she then went on to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.\n\nLorna was associated with several New Jersey theatre groups in the 1930s, as a performer and director. In December 1937 she married W Kenneth Ostrander, a journalist. They married at the family home, while the talented Fred Volare played the Wedding March. The couple remained in New Jersey and raised two children, living near Fred and Helen, for the next twenty years. Lorna also shared her parents’ interests – after the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, she joined their efforts with the local branch of the British War Relief Society. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, she joined the war industry, working at an engineering firm and encouraging other women to do the same. Her wartime efforts were impressive – fund-raising, civil defence activities and even encouraging the collection of scrap metal.\n\nLorna Ostrander died in Arizona in 1998. She was never interviewed about the experience of being a child star of the silent era, and had long since been forgotten by Australians.\n\nNote 1: The Gerry Society\n\nThat the Gerry Society served a reforming function seems without doubt. However, the eccentricities of the society at the start of the twentieth century can be gauged from Elbridge T Gerry‘s own commentary in 1890, when he asserted there were three classes of theatres – 1) reputable – “Where legitimate drama is exhibited,” 2) semi-reputable, which were still often vulgar, and 3) disreputable, with their audiences composed of the “lowest and most degraded class of society.” Despite this, Cullen, Hackman and McNeilly note how inconsistent the society was in applying their rules in relation to individual acts. For example, they were apparently not concerned about a young Fred Astaire dancing, but hounded Buster Keaton’s family. The Pollard Lilliputian Opera Company, comprising children from Lorna’s home town of Melbourne, never performed on the US east coast because of the Society’s presence.\n\nThe New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children exists today, with a very contemporary child protection mission.

Photo by May and Mina Moore, Sydney. The Stage Pictorial, April 1913. Via State Library of Victoria\n\nThe 5 second version\n\nBorn in Richmond, an inner suburb of Melbourne Australia in 1892, Ivy Schilling (spelled Shilling after 1914) became a hugely popular dancer on the Australian and British stage. Vibrant, good looking and energetic, her acrobatic and audacious style of dance was enthusiastically received. Her reputation as a typical “Australian girl” was also fed by clever publicity, including claims of her outstanding athletic prowess. She was photographed numerous times, won various competitions and often provided commentary on a wide range of topics. From 1914 she worked in Britain, then making a triumphant return to Australia in 1921. She commenced a tour of the US in the 1922, however a serious injury appears to have brought her dancing to an end almost immediately. By the mid 1920s she was living in Hollywood, associating with some leading figures including actor Enid Bennett and Producer Charles Christie. After a private visit to Australia in 1928 she returned to England for good. In 1932 she married an Australian-born surgeon, retiring from public life. She died in England in 1972.\n\nIvy growing up\n\nIvy May Schilling was born in George St, Richmond, an inner suburb of Melbourne, on August 4, 1892, the third of four children of Julius Schilling and Louisa nee Baldrock. Her father was described as a baker on her birth certificate, but by the 1910s he was listed in directories and electoral roles as a carrier. Ivy’s German grandfather had arrived in Melbourne at the end of the goldrush era on the ship Persian, in March 1862. The family had prospered, and by 1915, the Schillings lived at a comfortable home at 5 Raglan St, Saint Kilda East.\n\nAs was usual for working class children of the era, Ivy left school at about age 13, at the end of 1905. By this time she already had a reputation for giving entertaining performances. The National Library of Australia’s Michelle Potter notes the contemporary newspaper story that Ivy had pleaded with her mother to be allowed to learn to dance, although there are numerous examples of other talented working class children being encouraged to try the stage by their parents, as an alternative to the inevitable factory work or an apprenticeship.\n\nIvy quickly became one of the leading students at Jennie Brenan’s dance school. As Historian Janet McCalman has pointed out, Jennie Brenan was to develop a close association with JC Williamson’s, the Australian theatre monopoly, which soon meant exciting opportunities for young dancers like Ivy.\n\nIvy dances with JC Williamson’s\n\nBy 1910, 18 year old Ivy was a prominent dancer in the JC Williamson’s Pantomime company, performing throughout cities in Australia and New Zealand – in various pantomimes including Jack and Jill and Aladdin.\n\nIvy’s breakthrough appearance appears to have been in the comic opera Our Miss Gibbs, in Sydney in September, 1910. Teamed with Fred Leslie (1882-1965), she appeared in La Danse du Vaurien -a combination of Apache and acrobatic dancing. The couple evoked “thunders of applause” from the audience and great reviews from newspapers. Fred Leslie remained her partner, off and on, for at least seven years.\n\nIvy saves a drowning surfer\n\nTowards the end of Our Miss Gibb’s Sydney run, Melbourne’s Punch could tell its readers that audiences had “gone mad” over Ivy. “She is the best girl dancer yet found in Australia… who belongs to the athletic cult and practices assiduously with the heavy dumbbells and the parallel bars…” And indeed she quickly developed a reputation as a health-conscious, outdoorsy, sports-loving Australian girl.\n\nAt the end of the nineteenth century and beginning of the twentieth century, Australians were sometimes represented in literature as superior variations of the “British type.” For example, a character in E W Hornung’s 1890 book A Bride from the Bush speaks of “the typical Australian…[as] one of the very highest if not the highest development of our species.” Emerging actors were sometimes popularised because they appeared to fit this representation – and being physically active and loving the outdoors were key elements of the stereotype.\n\nIn March 1911, newspapers reported that Ivy, then performing in Sydney, had saved Tommy Walker, a well known surfer, who had been “seized by cramp” while swimming at Manly beach. “Taking the 10 stone lad under her arm… [Ivy] brought him back to the sands and safety… Miss Schilling, after her fine performance, resumed her dip in the surf as if nothing had happened,” reported Sydney’s Sun It was a good story, but suspiciously it coincided with newspaper articles showing Ivy’s modelling physical culture (as above) and with her success in the West Pictures’ Sirens of the Surf – a competition and short film. Shown as part of a mixed theatre program, the short film profiled a number of female Australian swimmers and was directed by Franklyn Barrett. Theatre audiences could then vote for their favourite siren, and not surprisingly, Ivy won.\n\nThe story of Ivy in the surf was revisited in 1912, when the ever-helpful Sydney Sun reported she had bumped into a shark while swimming at Manley. Clearly keen to keep up public interest in her, a week later she contributed the (then revolutionary) view that Australian girls should be allowed to play football. If she really believed this, she was a century ahead of her time, as women’s football did not begin in Australia until the 21st century.\n\nIvy Schilling, the genius?\n\nIn 1913, the Sun’s theatre critic, “Playgoer,” gave voice to the extraordinary enthusiasm some felt about 21 year old Ivy, and the need to find suitable roles in Australia for such a talent, lest she disappear overseas. Under the heading “Is Ivy Schilling a genius?” the following appeared;\n\nAs a dancer Miss Schilling has a genius, a temperament remarkably her own and remarkably vivid. Whenever she has had the proper opportunity… she has been – electrical, unique…. I have not seen a dramatic power like hers in any other recent Australian dancer. I saw Miss Schilling in some production (heaven knows which, of them) in a “Danse du Vaurien” … and the splendid expressiveness of that dance is not to be forgotten. I saw her again, revealed by Mr. Fred Leslie, in a dance which he called’ the ‘Juno Kata,’ placed more or less incongruously in… musical comedy. Here she was once more superb… What we want for Australian dancers, when rare temperaments like that of Miss Schilling… is opportunity — opportunity for their own development, and opportunity to make themselves understood by the public…. They need -sympathy, appreciation, comprehension; and, above all, a chance..\n\nIn June 1913, Ivy gained another sort of publicity when she was named as one of the co-respondents in the “society divorce” of Walter Oswald Watt and Muriel Maud Watt. While the case attracted much press attention, it appears to have had no negative impact at all on Ivy’s career.\n\nNewspaper reports aside, the most convincing evidence of Ivy’s booming popularity at this time can be found in her surviving JC Williamson’s contracts, now held in the Australian Performing Arts Collection in Melbourne. In April 1911, Ivy was contracted at £7 a week, with a guaranteed 45 weeks work. In April 1912 this was boosted to £9 per week and in April 1913 it was boosted again to £12 a week. In her final JC Williamson’s contract of 1914, she was offered £17 per week for the part year she was to work. By comparison, in 1907 the Australian “basic wage” was set at £2 and 2 shillings. Thus Ivy was extremely well paid for a 19 year old.\n\nIvy also owed at least some of her success to having teamed with Fred Leslie, an experienced dancer and choreographer, ten years her senior. Several of her highly successful turns are known to have been choreographed by him, although given their success as a partnership over a long period of time, a degree of collaboration also seems likely.\n\nIn 1913, JC Williamson’s launched a major revue that opened in December 1913 – called Come Over Here. Not all reviewers were enthusiastic about this piece of “overcrowded entertainment” – but Ivy and Fred Leslie’s turn in “the Spider Web dance” was universally well received. A very young Robert Helpmann (1909-1986) saw the show in Adelaide, and was enthralled by the dance.\n\nAfter a paired-down version opened for a season in Melbourne, and despite the very generous rate of pay she was on, Ivy Schilling did what so many hopeful Australian performers did. She packed up and headed to London, departing on the Otranto in late June 1914.\n\nShe provided one final interview for the Australian press that expressed her high hopes. Perth’s Daily News reported: “Ivy Schilling is a tonic. She is so full of optimism, She sat on her bunk on the R.M.S Otranto this morning, and talked more than hopefully of her prospective tour of England. ‘I have been wanting to see the outer world for a long time… I was born in Melbourne— never been outside of Australasia’ “\n\nIvy in England, 1914-1921\n\nDespite not having a pre-arranged contract in London, and arriving only a few days before the outbreak of war, Ivy found work quite quickly in the patriotic themed vaudeville show Europe, that opened at the Empire. Fred Leslie had arrived only a few weeks after Ivy, and the couple introduced the popular “Ju-jitsu” dance they had performed in Australia. By December 1914 the couple were appearing in Birmingham, where the dance was described as “the most astonishing piece of dancing likely to be witnessed…for some time.” Compared to the experiences of so many, Ivy’s transition to working in London was remarkably smooth.\n\nIvy dropped the spelling of her surname “Schilling” for the more British sounding “Shilling” on arrival – of course she was not the only Australian of German origins to do this at the time. The family of Australia’s leading General of the First World War, John Monash, had done the same.\n\nIvy’s success on the British stage is well documented. She appeared in British producer Alfred Butt’s production of Irving Berlin’s first musical – Watch Your Step, at the Empire Theatre in 1915, followed by a long run in the musical Betty at Daly’s Theatre. Looking back several years later, she complained that much of 1915 was spent “playing parts and singing” and it was not until 1916 that she was given dancing parts again in Three Cheers. Dancing in this revue was again choreographed by Fred Leslie and he also featured as Ivy’s partner. Variety reported that her dances with Fred Leslie became “the talk of London.”\n\nShe appeared in a short film in 1919 – one of the Around the Town series that now appears to be lost.\n\nShe continued to provide public commentary and posed for endless photos. In 1920 her comment that Jazz was “stupid and vulgar” gained her some attention. More importantly however, by 1920 she commented on the growing popularity of picture shows. She observed that during the war, audiences of soldiers on leave helped to fill live theatre shows. British theatre historian J P Wearing notes that during London performances of Shanghai in 1918, which was headlined by the newly arrived Australian Dorothy Brunton (1890-1977), in addition to featuring Ivy, Australian soldiers on leave shouted the greeting “Coo-ee” from the stalls.\n\nHowever, by 1920 tastes had changed. Since the war’s end, Ivy thought London people had “gone crazy over picture shows… so much so that a number of well known theatres had been sold and turned into picture houses.” Of course, it was an observation many performers were making at the time.\n\nIn September 1920, Ivy arrived back in Australia on the SS Orsova, with a contract to perform for the Tivoli circuit. As Michelle Potter notes, the contract covered her passage from England and allowed for an extraordinary salary of £100 per week She received a grand welcome home and journalists clamoured to interview her: “Australia always admired her ability and England has endorsed that opinion” announced Table Talk, approvingly. She appeared with Vera Pearce in Robert Greig’s production of the musical Maggie, followed by a tour in the operetta The Lilac Domino, followed by some variety at the Tivoli.\n\nIn 1921 she teamed with Harold or Leon Kellaway (1897-1990) who would later join her in the US.\n\nAlso while in Australia, she took a cameo role as a dancer in Raymond Longford and Lottie Lyell’s feature The Blue Mountains Mystery. When the film was released in the UK, Ivy’s name was prominently listed – she was the best known of the cast for British audiences. Unfortunately, this “society drama” is another lost Australian film.\n\nIvy arrived back in Britain in November 1921, Kellaway arrived on another ship at about the same time.\n\nIvy in the US, 1922-1928\n\nAfter some work in England, in August 1922, Ivy travelled to New York. She had been contracted by producer George Choos (1879-1961) for his new revue The Realm of Fantasy. After an awkward moment with her visa, Ivy started performing in the show with her partner Leon Kellaway – first in Connecticut and then, very briefly, in New York. But, after only a few days she left the show and was replaced. US papers gave no indication as to why.\n\nHowever, soon after this, Australian newspapers reported rumours of Ivy as having suffered some serious but unspecified injury and finally, a correspondent for Melbourne’s Table Talk saw her in New York, in early 1923. This paper reported that although Ivy was “much thinner… she was expecting to start work again, as her leg was nearly right.” For someone who knew how to generate publicity for good effect, Ivy’s silence about the dance injury she sustained suggests it was much more serious than ever acknowledged.\n\nMost significantly, there does not appear to be any evidence she danced professionally again.\n\nAfter a brief return to England in 1923, Ivy went back to the US, but this time, it was reportedly to pursue a film career in Hollywood.\n\nIvy ended up staying in Hollywood for about five years, although there is no evidence she appeared in any films. There is also no indication how she supported herself in the comfortable bungalow she lived in at 1424 Orange Grove Avenue. Reports show she mixed in with the large British film colony, and with Australians – becoming a close friend of Enid Bennett, and her sisters Marjorie and Catherine. By 1925, she was also associated romantically with Canadian-born producer Charles Christie (1882-1955). In April 1925, Photoplay reported that a wedding announcement for the couple was expected “any day.” It would be easy to dismiss these stories as the usual creative Hollywood gossip, however shipping manifests show Ivy and Charles travelling back to the US on the SS Paris in October 1925, after a holiday in Europe together, including a visit to London’s Piccadilly Hotel. This seems to confirm a close personal association.\n\nIvy retires from the stage\n\nHowever, Charles Christie and Ivy did not marry. In mid 1928 she left California for a trip to Australia, accompanying Enid Bennett’s mother on the voyage. Ivy explained later that her trip was a personal one to see family, although there was considerable speculation she would perform again. She returned to London on the Otranto in late 1928 and from then on, made England her home.\n\nIn January 1932, Ivy married Australian-born Harley Street surgeon, John Ryan, in London. She announced she was retiring, although she had not been active on stage for ten years. What she really meant was that she was retiring from public life. She died in London on April 8, 1972, following a stroke.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nFebruary 2023\n\nReferences\n\nSpecial Thanks\n\nClaudia Funder, Australian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne.\n\nAustralian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne\n\nSee collection photo of Leon Kellaway – aka Jan Kowsky.

He made over 600 film and TV appearances between 1915 and 1962. Many of those made after the coming of sound were as an uncredited player. Australian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne.\n\nSnub Pollard, born Harold Fraser in North Melbourne, Australia, in 1889, enjoyed a very long career on stage and in the US cinema.(See more about his professional life here) At the height of his success as a film comedian, he returned to Australia on a two month visit in 1923. He was well established at the Hal Roach studio, and told an Australian newspaper that he had a contract with Roach until 1927. Everything seemed to be going well. He was newly married, financially secure – to such an extent he could spend £2000 on a new house in Carlton for his mother.\n\nMost of his letters home, surviving at the Australian Performing Arts Collection in Melbourne, are addressed to his brother George or to his nephew, also named Harold, who lived in Portarlington, a pretty seaside town south of Melbourne. The collection of letters mostly date from after this visit home, from the 1930s -1950s, by which time he was appearing in supporting or uncredited roles. His letters give no hints about his change in fortunes – the transition from being a major silent screen comedian of the early 1920s to jobbing extra is never mentioned. The correspondence is too late to cover the mid 1920s when Snub left Roach and set up his own production company, which then failed. However, there are other insights to be had from reading his correspondence.\n\nThis writer has often wondered how strongly expat Australians working in Hollywood and Britain identified with their new cultural contexts and whether they maintained any sort of Australian identity. The evidence in the correspondence is that although Snub became a US citizen, he still regarded himself as an Australian and Australia as “home”. When he watched US newsreel footage showing the catastrophic 1939 bushfires near Melbourne, he said he felt homesick, when he went swimming or enjoyed the hot weather he thought it was because he was Australian. He said he read Australian newspapers at the RKO studios to keep up with the news.\n\nSnub’s trip home in 1923 remained a powerful memory. The very joyful time spent with brother George and his family at Portarlington seems to stayed with him for the rest of his life.“…Portarlington has a warm spot in my heart” he wrote. Even as late as 1949, he expressed his desire to visit again, “then we will all go swimming together” but soon after he complained that there were now no longer direct ships between California and Australia, “so that’s that” – meaning it was too much effort to travel to Vancouver to catch one.\n\nAs might be expected, the topics covered in his letters include the mundane, like the weather in Los Angeles and how the seasons in California are the opposite to Australia’s, the opening of the baseball season, and comments about horse racing – a shared family interest that went back to Snub’s father. He also loved receiving family photos and regularly asked for more. He often listed the other family members he had just written to – it’s clear he took his family correspondence seriously.\n\nOnly sometimes does professional news feature in Snub’s letters, but several observations can be made from what he wrote. Westerns seem to have given him greatest pleasure; he mentions appearing in films with cowboy stars like Bob Steele and Tex Ritter and occasionally he mentioned the film titles by name. However, he worried that these Westerns might not be shown in Australian cinemas and therefore his family may not see them. Although he did not say so, these Westerns were second features, made quickly and on small budgets, usually with a running time of 60 minutes.\n\nInterviewed in 1973, Tex Ritter seemed to suggest he had a role in Snub’s appearance as his sidekick in a dozen of his westerns made between 1936 and 1938. “I had seen Snub in his own little comedies when I was a kid. He was always one of my favourite comedians when I was growing up…I convinced them to put the old mustache back on him because a lot of people my age would remember him.”\n\nThe film Snub mentioned most often in letters sent during the period 1943-44 is the Pete Smith film Self Defence, one of a string of 10 minute comedy shorts made at MGM. Unfortunately, it appears to be lost, although other Smith shorts have survived. Snub makes the point in one letter that as an extra, he didn’t really know how good his part would be until he started work on the picture. This may explain why he appears to have little awareness of the significance of some of the films he appeared in – such as the now classic sci-fi film The Day the Earth Stood Still, in 1951 or the musical Singin’ in the Rain in 1952. In May 1948, he wrote of working on a Bing Crosby film for two weeks in San Francisco, although what this was seems difficult to identify now – possibly it was A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court.\n\nOne of the most significant matters alluded to by Snub was his involvement in the Screen Extras Guild, an association he joined in the later 1940s. He was on the board of directors of the Guild by March 1949 and remained so for at least ten years, in company with another Australian actor, perennial Hollywood butler William H O’Brien. While there is no evidence his politics were as radical as those of another famous Australian-born unionist in the US, Harry Bridges of the International Longshoremen’s Association, the activities of the SEG were designed to protect the rights of worker members who might otherwise easily be exploited. SEG’s efforts included demanding health and welfare benefits for extras and refusing compromising conditions to employment. Snub’s first travel in a commercial aircraft was on SEG business in 1949. He wrote about the experience at some length and posted the United Airlines information packet home to his nephew.\n\nThe technology Snub often wrote about in the later 1940s was television – as he was beginning to be employed in TV shows and started to see his old comedies replayed. He seemed to have lived in hope that the new medium might see him making comedies again in his old makeup, and he wrote that he had some good proposals. Television in Australia was still being planned when he wrote to his nephew to explain how the exciting new medium worked: “you sure will like it. After dinner you go in your front room, turn on the television set and see all the pictures you want to, even Snub Pollard comedies.” “Yes television over here is great I see a lot of my old comedies…” Television began in Australia in late 1956, when to fill screen time, Australian TV stations no doubt turned to the readily available work of silent comedians like Snub.\n\nOf Snub’s personal life, the surviving letters tell us only a little. After the Second World War he lodged with old friends, including a director of some of his old comedies. He spent Christmas and festive occasions with friends and still received fan mail. He had married three times, but by 1944 could assure his family he was no longer married and by 1946 had apparently decided he wanted to stay single.\n\nOccasionally Snub sent small gifts home in a parcel – combs and pens. He also sometimes posted the comic sections of US newspapers to his nephew, and forwarded on postcards he had been sent by fans, that tickled his fancy. Several of these were fairly risqué for the time, and might tell us something about Snub’s own sense of humour.\n\nSnub Pollard did not return again to see his family, but stayed in California. Although he never stated it directly, there is a sense of regret about this in his letters. However, he had spent most of his life at a remove from his family – first travelling the world with the Pollard child performers, then with older ex-pollard players, and then in Hollywood, which had more than a sprinkling of former Australian vaudevillians amongst them. Snub worked almost to the time of his death in 1962.\n\nNOTE 1\n\nThe collection consist of postcards, photos, Christmas cards and letters, the majority are dated between 1939 and 1953. Correspondence from the war years are all postcards. The recipient of most is Harold Fraser, the son of Snub’s older brother George. The Australian Performing Arts Collection purchased this collection in the early 1990s. As noted, Snub wrote to all his family, and we must assume this is only a partial record.\n\nThanks\n\nClaudia Funder, Australian Performing Arts Collection, Melbourne, who convinced me to leaf through their Snub Pollard Collection.\n\nKevin Summers and Geoffrey Wright, whose patient persistence demonstrated that I was wrong and Snub Pollard did indeed appear as a taxi driver in The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)\n\nFurther Reading\n\nJohn Booker (2017) The Happiest Trails.

She was 68 years old and well and truly typecast.\n\nThe 5 second version.\n\nFlorence Edith Tempe Pigott was aged almost 50 when she arrived in the US in mid 1916, an unusually late start in life for an Australian actor interested in working overseas. She was born on a remote Queensland pastoral station in 1867 but had lived most of her early life comfortably in Brisbane. A teacher of elocution and long active in amateur theatre, she started professional work in about 1907. (See Note 1 below regarding her birth)\n\nTempe went on to be one of the busiest Australian actor exports of her generation. But when she died in California in 1962, her death certificate recorded very few details accurately. It listed her birthplace as England and gave her date of birth as 2 February 1884. Without family to correct details the real story of her remarkable career – with more than 70 film credits and numerous stage appearances, has been obscured. She was to be typecast for her entire Hollywood career. Speaking disparagingly of film producers, she once said ‘When they want a drunken fishwife, they know where to apply.‘\n\nAbove: Tempe Pigott, while performing in Melbourne in 1912.\n\nTempe’s remote Australian birth\n\nFlorence Edith Tempe Pigott was born at Auburn station, about 450 kms north-west of Brisbane, in the Burnett district in Queensland, on 2 February 1867. Tempe was therefore 84 years old when she appeared in her last recorded film in 1951 and about 95 when she died in 1962. (See Note 1 below regarding her birth)\n\nTempe’s father was pastoralist Peter J Pigott, her mother was Lydia nee Clarke, the daughter of well known Queensland architect Francis Clarke. While working life on pastoral leases like Auburn was hard, the profits to be made were significant. Pigott could afford to go on an extended trip to England and Ireland in the mid 1860s, but when his business partner J M Murphy died in an accident, he hurried home. The frontier of Tempe’s birth was also notoriously harsh and sometimes violent. Records of catastrophic clashes with Indigenous Australians do not mention Pigott or Auburn station, but they are found in nearby localities at this time. Another significant feature of life on properties like Auburn was its remoteness. Today, the nearest town is Chinchilla – comprising 6,500 people and about 100 kms to the south. However, when Pigott took up his lease at Auburn, Chinchilla did not exist, and Maryborough, 300 kms to the east was the nearest big town.\n\nLife in Brisbane\n\nPeter J Pigott died in November 1870 aged only 49, and soon after Lydia took her children back to Brisbane. In 1874 Lydia married William Horsley, a merchant and Brisbane broker. Brisbane was a growing city but in 1900 its population of 120,000 was still only a quarter the size of the other major east coast cities – Melbourne and Sydney. Consequently its theatre scene was smaller and opportunities for those keen to pursue the stage were limited. Tempe’s first recorded appearance in amateur theatre was in a charity performance of the comedy New Men and Old Acres, in June 1885.\n\nIn later interviews with journalists, Tempe revealed other aspects of her Brisbane life as a young adult. She said she was an accomplished tennis player, having become amateur women’s champion of Queensland. She was also a recreational rifle shooter, and had taken up women’s rowing. She also painted watercolours in her spare time. While electoral rolls for the early 1900s listed her as a typist, we also know she taught elocution in Brisbane, advertising her services in local papers in 1904 and 1905 – a 14 week course cost 25 shillings. By this time she was living at a rather grand, gothic style, private hotel called Riversleigh on Brisbane’s North Quay, although her mother and step-father lived only a few streets away.\n\nElocution and the theatre\n\nIn addition to making her own income, as the daughter of a successful pastoralist and step-daughter of a wealthy businessman, she would also have had a healthy degree of financial freedom and she certainly enjoyed connections with Brisbane’s elite. When 29 year old Tempe attended the Governor’s Ball in 1896, her attendance and attire was duly noted, and when she visited friends in Warwick or Gympie, the newspapers reported her “holidaying” in their social pages. Even when she returned to Australia in 1936 after 20 years in the US, she was still well enough connected to be invited to society events where “anecdotes of Hollywood were very much in demand” – these included afternoon tea with Sydney’s Lady Mayoress and friends.\n\nIn his study of selected character actors of Hollywood’s Golden Age, Axel Nissan respectfully describes Tempe as ‘the Eternal Landlady’ and that is indeed, the way we see her in many of her surviving films. It appears she began to appear in these types of roles while performing in Australia.\n\nAt some stage in 1907, Tempe started to appear in professional performances. The first was probably with the Lillian Meyers Company – touring Australian cities and towns with a variety of drama and comedies. Thanks to her skill in elocution, she increasingly took on important character roles. For example, in Hobart in January 1908, in a new play about the ever popular Kelly Gang, she took the supporting role of Ned Kelly’s Irish mother, Ellen. Ellen Kelly was still alive at the time, and the Kelly story still resonated so strongly with Australians that it had been made into a feature film only a few years before.\n\nBy 1911, she was now touring with the Hamilton-Plimmer-Denniston Company, in the comedy-drama Nobody’s Daughter, alternating with the comedy Lover’s Lane. In the latter, Tempe formed part of a “splendid gallery of portraiture” – which, after all, was the task of a character actor. Tempe’s role as the old Scottish nurse Christine Grant in Nobody’s Daughter received very good reviews.\n\nBy 1912 Tempe was in regular work on the Australian stage, often performing for Sydney’s Little Theatre, between longer seasons at larger east coast theatres. However we gain some sense of why better paid overseas work may have been attractive from her surviving JC Williamson’s contract for the patriotic play The Man Who Stayed at Home. Her July 1915 contract was for the very modest sum of £6 per week, the equivalent perhaps of $600 in 2021 money.\n\nIn late April 1916, the Sydney Little Theatre farewelled her after a final performance in Hindle Wakes.\n\nWork in the US\n\nIn May 1916, Tempe boarded the SS Sierra for the US. Her travelling companion was Marie Irvine, a Brisbane journalist. Although it was now wartime and the usual reporting about an Australian actor travelling overseas to take on the world was muted, her hometown paper, the Brisbane Courier reported “Miss Pigott ranks with the best artists the Australian stage possesses…This esteemed artist cannot possibly fail to make a name in America…” .\n\nThe passenger manifest makes it clear her destination was New York and she seems to have succeeded in finding work soon after arrival. From late 1916 Tempe can be found in the cast lists of several plays touring US cities. The first of these was Peg O’ My Heart – where she took the role of the English Mrs Chichester, who educates a young New York girl to be a lady, in return for a large portion of an inheritance – a Pygmalion style story. The next four years of effort on the US stage, including a short season of Perkins in New York in 1918, finally saw her in Los Angeles, performing at the Writer’s Club.\n\nLike so many of her contemporaries, the actual reasoning for Tempe’s move to the US had been a career and financial decision. And of Hollywood she said; “It was quite natural that I should gravitate towards Hollywood… More money may be made in a day in pictures than in a week on the stage; so, naturally, everyone is attracted to film work.” All the same, as this writer has indicated, there is some likelihood Tempe had inherited some additional financial security.\n\nHer first film was apparently the Famous Players Lasky’s The Great Impersonation, released in 1921, probably a lost film, although in interviews she nominated other films as her first, including Behold My Wife (1920).\n\nAlex Nissan, who seems to have gone to the effort of finding and watching much of her work, writes: “in films there has to be someone to open the door and say so and so is calling, or make a drunken spectacle of themselves in a pub… Such an actress was Tempe Pigott.“ All the same, definitive commentary about her thirty years of work in film is difficult, insofar as she sometimes played such minor character roles and her appearance is fleeting.\n\nThere is also the problem of mis-identification of Tempe, given that she was undoubtedly made up to look as aged and careworn as possible in many of her films. For example, the current version of the IMDB illustrates her profile with a photo that is arguably Dorothy Phillips made-up as an older woman.\n\nSome available examples of Tempe’s film work are linked in the references section below. Nissan notes that the earlier 1930s were a busy time for her, and she made the transition to sound films successfully, when so many did not. Commenting on this herself on her return to Australia in 1936-7, Tempe suggested this was partly thanks to her expertise in elocution. “So much depends not only on the voice but on the pronunciation.” The journalist reported that Tempe ” had a beautiful speaking voice, fine diction and an easy manner…” “Talkies came upon us so suddenly…and it was pathetic to watch the falling of so many of the stars. Many of the women, and the men, too, merely had beautiful faces; often they could not speak English at all. If they did, it was sometimes harsh English, which could never be corrected.” She had gone to some effort to avoid picking up an American accent, she said. As her surviving sound films illustrate, her voice skills were particularly notable in a variety of British accents.\n\nNot all of her screen appearances were fleeting. Her extended supporting role as one of the working class London women in the Gary Cooper vehicle Seven Days Leave (1930), gained positive reviews – the film is based on J.M. Barrie’s bitter-sweet play The Old Lady Shows Her Medals. Some of her shorter appearances are still of characters important in film narratives – such as nurse Mrs Corney, who steals the ring from Oliver’s mother in Oliver Twist (1933), thus setting in train the series of events that make the story.\n\nTempe’s voice can be heard in this example from Night Work (1930), where she plays Clara the nurse, determined to give young Oscar his castor oil, enlisting Mr Musher (Eddie Quillan) to help.\n\nTempe also appeared in a role of substance in the very successful 1933 Fox film Cavalcade, based on a play by Noël Coward. A film in the style of the Forsyte Saga and Upstairs Downstairs, it was one of a string of Hollywood films that romanticized all things English, while also celebrating the challenges and successes of family life. It won several Academy Awards – for best Picture, best Director (Frank Lloyd) and best Art Direction. Alongside Tempe was fellow Australian Billy Bevan, also playing a role that required a working class English accent – something Hollywood studios often called upon Australians to perform.\n\nTempe returned to Australia for a visit in August 1936. She stayed on for about seven months, living with her cousins (on her mother’s side) at their comfortable home at Sydney’s Darling Point. She was widely interviewed for radio and newspapers, and gave talks at society events. She gave at least one radio performance as Sairey Gamp (a character from Charles Dicken’s Martin Chuzzlewit) for ABC radio. She even expressed a hope that she might appear in an Australian film. But she didn’t. She returned to Hollywood in March 1937. Unfortunately, given her age, she was stopped on return to the US. She was an alien (a non-US citizen), and was given a class “B” medical certificate, probably because her age (stated to be 68 but really 70) might normally suggest she would be unable to earn a living. However, in the end, the US accepted her, perhaps after some assurances from her agent or a studio.\n\nDid she lose her “currency” in the time she was away from Hollywood? It is difficult to be certain, but her film ouput seems to have slowed on her return to Hollywood. Her 30 year film career finally came to a close with a tiny role in the 1951 Douglas Sirk crime drama Thunder on the Hill, when she was aged 84, and again playing an “old crone,” according to the cast list at the IMDB.\n\nTwo key documents we might expect would help cast some light on Tempe’s later life are at least partly erroneous. As Alex Nissan notes, the 1940 US census shows Tempe was a lodger in a house in the heart of Hollywood by this time, and had only earned $500 in the year before the census. But the document also gives her place of birth as England, and her age as 56. Her 1962 death certificate also stated she was an Englishwoman, born on 2 Feb 1884. In fact, she was 95 years old when she died. The certificate also reveals that she had broken her hip in a fall not long before her death.\n\nWe might view Tempe Pigott as another victim of Hollywood casting practices, however she also appears to have been quite conscious of what the studios required and was a willing participant in the transaction – and after all, she had returned to the US to do more of it in 1937. During her visit home to Australia she repeatedly said that Hollywood had a policy of “typing” actors. She alluded to an unnamed acquaintance who was only ever offered butler roles. Because of this practice of typecasting she would never be offered “a grand dame to play” . But this appears not to have concerned her, as such grand dame parts were “very thankless… You just sail about” she observed.\n\nTo the best of this writer’s knowledge Tempe did not marry and she had no children. US papers reported her death in California in 1962, but remarkable though her very long career was, her passing was completely overlooked in Australia. She really should not have been so easily forgotten in her country of birth.\n\nNote 1. The mystery of Tempe’s birth\n\nThere is no surviving Queensland birth certificate for Florence Edith Tempe Pigott, or if one exists, it has been mis-identified. While that was unusual in the Australian colonies, it is not unknown. But we know the details of her birth with a high degree of certainty from several other sources:\n\n1. When she arrived in the US on the SS Sierra on May 29, 1916, and again on the SS Monterey on March 22, 1937, she variously gave her date of birth as 1872 and 1869. She named her place of birth – Auburn Queensland – on the 1937 ship’s manifest.\n\nHowever, when she was born on 2 February 1867, her parents announced the birth of their (as yet unnamed) daughter in a prominent position in a number of major Australian newspapers, in New South Wales and Queensland, in February 1867.\n\n2. And on Tempe’s mother Lydia’s death certificate from 1912 (by now Lydia Horsley), her three surviving children from her first marriage to Peter J Pigott were clearly named, with their ages. This again confirms Tempe as the child born in 1867.\n\n3. Also of interest, Tempe’s younger sibling Madaline, born in October 1868, did not have a birth certificate issued until 1871, confirming that the family were not very observant of obligations to complete official paperwork – but perhaps their isolation was also to blame.(On Madaline’s birth certificate Tempe is listed as a 3 year old) And as noted, there is no death certificate for Tempe’s father, Peter J Pigott, who died on 2 November 1870, while seeking treatment for an unspecified ailment. The absence of a death certificate is unusual.\n\nNick Murphy\n\nDecember 2022\n\nReferences\n\nPrimary Sources\n\nAustralian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne.\n\nNational Archives of Australia\n\nAncestry.com\n\nQueensland; Births, Deaths & Marriages\n\nCalifornia, Department of Public Health\n\nLantern, Digital Media Project at the Internet Archive\n\nNational Library of Australia, Trove.\n\nNewspapers.com\n\nText\n\nQueensland Government Intelligence & Tourist Bureau.

Courtesy Australian Performing Arts Collection, Arts Centre, Melbourne.\n\nThe 5 second version\n\nLloyd Lamble (born Melbourne, Australia in 1914) is not a forgotten Australian actor. There are a number of biographies on line and in print, and several fulsome obituaries appeared when he died. Yet most make little mention of his 18 year career on the Australian stage and in radio before he moved to the UK in 1951, and there are also confusing claims about key events in his life. His British career saw him become what Brian McFarlane describes as a “sturdy, reliable character player.” His first film was a 1943 propaganda short. While the IMDB lists over 160 TV and film appearances – usually as an authority figure in a supporting role – it transpires that by the end of his life he was deeply dissatisfied with his career. He married three times and died at his home in Cornwall in 2008.\n\n* The first draft of his unpublished autobiography was entitled The Strutting and the fretting – which is a quotation adapted from Macbeth: “Life’s but a walking shadow, a poor player, That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more.”\n\nLamble in Melbourne\n\nLloyd Nelson Lamble was born in Melbourne, Australia on February 8, 1914, the youngest of four boys born to William Henry Lamble, a musician and secretary of the Musicians Union of Australia and Frances nee Potter. A promising soloist in his church choir, Lloyd won a scholarship to nearby Wesley College in Prahran, and on leaving school he found work as a “Junior Announcer” at Melbourne radio station 3DB, followed by a longer stint at 3KZ and then at 3AW, broken up by some work as a Dance Band singer. Bob Walker, 3KZ’s biographer, described the young Lloyd Lamble as “tall, good looking, with blond hair and rich of voice.” While at 3AW he moved into radio acting with the Lee Murray Radio Players, and not surprisingly, then found his way to the stage.\n\nHis accent was described by one radio listener as “jammy,” – which is archaic Australian slang for “posh”, a comment audiences regularly made of radio announcers of the era."
