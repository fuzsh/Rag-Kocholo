        "text": "Sonny Mehta, who has died aged 77, possessed a rare combination of impeccable literary taste and business acumen that made him one of the world’s most successful publishers.\n\nHe made his reputation at Pan Books in London before being headhunted in 1987 to run the venerable New York publishing house Alfred A Knopf, and remained in that job for the rest of his life.\n\nHis departure was widely lamented by the British book trade because, as the publisher Tom Rosenthal put it, “he is probably unique among editors in being able to handle the crudest commerce and the finest literature with equal skill.” Mehta was most often in the headlines for paying enormous sums to the great and good for their memoirs.\n\nHe forked out a record-breaking $15 million for Bill Clinton’s My Life, and paid $9 million for Pope John Paul II’s Crossing the Threshold of Hope and the same sum for Tony Blair’s A Journey, pointing out to bemused British journalists that the former prime minister was a lot more popular in the United States than at home.\n\nMehta rarely lost money on these prestige projects, but his métier was publishing fiction.\n\nThe bearded, inscrutable Mehta, in his 1980s uniform of black sweater, black jeans and sneakers, conducted his work from behind a fug of cigarette smoke in a cluttered office, with Scotch on the go most of the day.\n\nLaid-back and self-deprecating, “he can give the rather engaging impression that he is successful despite himself,” one interviewer observed.\n\nThe literary agent Ed Victor said: “I think of Sonny like a frog or lizard sitting on a rock, very still. Then his tongue comes out and grabs an important book and sucks it back.”\n\nMehta’s habit of lapsing into protracted silences and his air of detachment made him seem to some stand-offish, but he was an indefatigable attender of literary parties.\n\nFrom his earliest days in publishing he displayed the good editor’s gift for weighing up a book’s potential. He was lunching with Germaine Greer, a friend from his days at Cambridge, when she started to complain that her “dumb agent” had suggested she write a book on female subjugation.\n\nHe was equally canny in snapping up Bret Easton Ellis’s American Psycho (1991), which had been summarily dropped by Simon & Schuster on the eve of publication after campaigners were alerted to its graphic violence and alleged misogyny. In such circumstances bestsellerdom was probably assured, but Mehta’s involvement meant that the book was taken seriously by critics.\n\nUnlike many literary publishers he did not trust that masterpieces would sell on their own merits, and devoted as much of his attention to sales, marketing and even cover design as to editing the text. He turned Kazuo Ishiguro, unknown in the United States, into a snob hit through a carefully programmed tour of select book shops.\n\nConversely, he made Gabriel Garcia Marquez’s Love in the Time of Cholera into a US bestseller by publicising it as a love story and omitting mention of the Colombian author’s credentials as a Nobel laureate and master of magical realism.\n\nHis greatest humiliation, however, came in 2001, when Michael Crichton, whose Jurassic Park (1990) Mehta had steered to titanic success, defected to HarperCollins after 32 years with Knopf. This was especially wounding for Mehta because he prided himself on justifying the loyalty of his authors.\n\nHe had tried writing in his youth – “just enough of a go to make me realise, first, that I was not going to be able to do it myself, and second, to give me an insight into what it takes to be a writer.\n\n“From quite an early stage, therefore, I said to myself that that was what I was going to be – a publisher, but the kind who is interested first, second and last in his authors … Without being 100 per cent on the writer’s side, you may just as well not bother.”\n\nAjai Singh Mehta was born in New Delhi on November 9 1942, the son of Amrik Mehta and his wife Satinder.\n\nHis father was one of the first diplomats in the newly formed Indian Foreign Service and his peripatetic childhood encompassed spells in Prague, New York and Nepal, where an American diplomat nicknamed him Sonny.\n\nHe was educated at the Lawrence School in the foothills of the Himalayas, the International School of Geneva and Sevenoaks School in Kent.\n\nHe won an open scholarship to read English and History at St Catharine’s College, Cambridge, and upset his father by choosing to go into publishing rather than the Foreign Service.\n\nAs an Indian he was greeted with polite bafflement by the publishing industry – “I spent a lot of interviews being spoken to very slowly and distinctly” – but finally secured a job with Rupert Hart-Davis in 1965, before moving to Granada Books to set up the Paladin imprint.\n\nIn 1972 he joined Pan Books, revitalising the upmarket Picador brand and helping to launch the authorial careers of Ian McEwan, Graham Swift, Julian Barnes and Clive James, as well as enjoying commercial success with Jackie Collins and the Wicked Willie cartoon books.\n\nHe made Pan a great deal of money by signing up Douglas Adams’s Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy novels, although the author’s procrastination took its toll on Mehta.\n\nWhen he discovered that Adams had barely written anything of So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish, Pan’s lead book of the season, he booked a suite at the Berkeley hotel and stayed there supervising Adams for two weeks, doing his own work as best he could while the author hammered at the typewriter, and making sure he went to bed in good time.\n\nIt was a surprise appointment for somebody who had worked, in one commentator’s words, “with obscure distinction” in mass-market paperback publishing; but although Mehta had a rocky start with some of his authors and colleagues, Gottlieb’s instincts were proved to be sound.\n\nMehta revived Everyman’s Library and also took over the Vintage paperback imprint, which, like Knopf, was owned by Random House; he raised prices in the belief that people would pay more for better quality books, and Vintage duly became the most successful paperback publisher in the US.\n\nA bon vivant who had been arrested in 1986 for possession of cocaine while in Adelaide for a literary festival, he underwent an emergency heart triple-bypass in 1999.\n\n“I have nothing but regret that I cannot continue to behave the way I behaved all my life, and I can’t wait for a chance to behave immoderately again,” he complained later that year, reporting that he was down to two cigarettes a day, “to keep the memory alive”.\n\nMehta believed that any success in publishing was instinctive and unaccountable: “This business remains so fascinating because it is so dogged with uncertainty … I still find it as confusing as when I started. Merrily, we beat our heads against the wall.”"
