        "text": "Inside\n\nANYTHING GOES\n\nbackground and analysis by Scott Miller\n\nAnything Goes is widely considered one of the great classics of the American musical theatre, and yet most people seeing it â and working on it â donât really understand what it is. For too long, itâs been a staple of high school drama departments and community theatres, where this brilliant satire is treated like an embarrassment, like its script is nothing more than hobbled-together, low-brow humor, the service of great old songs and a boatload of tap dancing.\n\nOn the contrary, Anything Goes is a masterful mashup of musical comedy, gangster movie, screwball comedy, and social satire, because even in terms of form, anything goes. Its twin satirical targets remain as potent as ever, Americaâs habit of turning religion into show business and criminals into celebrities. Notably, there are two âcriminalsâ among the cast, Mooney and Billy, one masquerading as a preacher, the other a fake celebrity.\n\nFirst opening in a time when John Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, Al Capone, speakeasy hostess Texas Guinan, and evangelists Aimee Semple McPherson and Billy Sunday were all big national celebrities, this was potent, pointed satire; and the show is just as subversive today. Anything Goes fearlessly rips open the American psyche and spills it all out onto the stage. And letâs be honest, the American psyche hasnât changed that much since 1934.\n\nHear the Sweet Beat\n\nIt was a rough birth, but itâs having a great, weird, long life.\n\nIn November 1934, Cole Porterâs Anything Goes hit Broadway like a freight train, starring the powerhouse trio of Ethel Merman, William Gaxton, and the hilariously stoic, trembly-voiced comedian Victor Moore. It wasnât Porterâs first show â he had already written scores for See America First (1916), Within the Quota (1923), Paris (1928), Wake Up and Dream (1929), The New Yorkers (1930), Gay Divorce (1932), and Nymph Errant (1933) â but Anything Goes was his best. So many of the songs would become American standards, and the showâs success and popularity would never really diminish, particularly after the boost from the 1962 off Broadway revival.\n\nOriginally, the show was called Hard to Get, then Bon Voyage, written mainly by Guy Bolton, with jokes by P.G. Wodehouse (pronounced WOOD-house), and it told the wacky tale of a transatlantic crossing aboard a luxury liner, a wedding to be stopped, a disgruntled screenwriter concocting wacky disruptions (including a fake bomb), various romantic obstacles, and of course, mismatched lovers. (The first script was not about a shipwreck as some history books claim.)\n\nThe first composer that producer Vinton Freedley envisioned for the project was Jerome Kern, but Kern worked only with Otto Harbach and Oscar Hammerstein II at that time, and he wasnât interested. Freedley also considered George Gershwin, who was enmeshed in the creation of Porgy and Bess. Next on Freedleyâs list was Cole Porter.\n\nBut then the real life shipwreck of the Morro Castle, killing 132 people, hit the headlines two days before the show went into rehearsal, and Freedley decided making a musical comedy about a fake bomb on board a luxury liner was no longer a good idea. So Freedley introduced the director, Howard Lindsay, to the columnist and press agent Russell Crouse and asked them to write a new book.\n\nLindsay and Crouse would go on to become one of the most successful writing teams in the American theatre, writing Life With Father and the scripts for Red, Hot, and Blue, Call Me Madam, and The Sound of Music, among other shows. Their 1945 play State of the Union won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\nSo the new bookwriters fashioned a new story around Porterâs now completed score (maybe this is why the show has always been so easy to tinker with), reportedly retaining less than a dozen lines from the original script. This time, the story involved safer romantic hijinks aboard the same luxury liner. (The ship setting had to remain since sets were already built.) In this second version, the steamship S.S. American (as a proxy for America itself) functions like Shakespeareâs woods, a place with no rules, where people find out who they really are and âcorrectâ the mistakes theyâve made in the world of the City, a âfreeâ place where lovers de-couple and re-couple.\n\nThe bad boy hero Billy Crocker was named for a college buddy of Porterâs at Yale, who helped finance some of Porterâs early shows. Moonface Martin, aka Reverend Dr. Moon, was originally named Moon Face Mooney, but during the Boston tryout, an ominous message was personally delivered to the theatre from an eccentric mobster in New Jersey who was not pleased to share his name with a musical comedy character.\n\nAnything Goes ran 420 performances, the fourth longest run of the decade, and 261 performances in London in 1935. The New York Times called it âa thundering good show,â and âhilarious and dynamic entertainment.â The New York World-Telegram called it âa triumph,â and said, âYou just must see it.â The Boston Post wrote, âIt opened fast, it raced along; in liveliness and beauty, wit and humor, it weaved a spell of genuine enjoyment that far exceeds anything the stage has given us in many a season.â\n\nA film version was made in 1936, initially announced with Bing Crosby as Billy, Queenie Smith as Reno LaGrange (!), and W.C. Fields as Moonface. When it was released, Merman was back in her role, with Crosby as Billy, and Charles Ruggles as Moonie. The film included six of Porterâs songs and six songs by other writers. A shortened TV version was aired on NBC in 1954 with Merman, Frank Sinatra, and Bert Lahr, with some of the original score and other Porter songs added. A 1956 film version was made that had nothing to do with the show except the title and a few songs.\n\nThe show was revived off Broadway in 1962 with a revised script by Guy Bolton, moving the entire story onto the ship (cutting the opening bar scene), as well as cutting some lesser Porter songs, replacing them with better songs from other Porter scores. This third stage version ran 239 performances. Then it hit London again in 1969 but ran only 15 performances. The show returned to Broadway in 1987 for an impressive 804 performances, and London once more in 1989. The 1987 version sported a new script by John Weidman and Timothy Crouse (son of Lindsay Crouse), based on the original and restoring more of the original score, including some (less than stellar) previously cut songs. The show was revived again in London in 2002, directed by Trevor Nunn, and it returned to Broadway in 2011 in a version very close to the 1987 version.\n\nBecause of all these different versions of the show, there is no single definitive version. The 1934 script probably couldnât be produced today, and the 1934 score did have some less than brilliant songs. âWaltz Down the Aisleâ doesnât even approach the skill of âI Get a Kick Out of You.â So maybe itâs better that Anything Goes has changed over time. People today see productions of the â62 revival, and they assume the score was always packed with all those hits, but it wasnât. The show we know today is superior to the original. âFriendship,â âDe-Lovely,â âLetâs Misbehave,â âTake Me Back to Manhattanâ â none of those songs were in the show originally.\n\nBut maybe a constantly shifting score is exactly right for a show called Anything Goes. We say itâs a âclassic,â but really, itâs the revival thirty years later thatâs the classic. Whatever its circuitous path to our stage, itâs still a fierce satire that nails some of the crazier impulses in our culture today. And our culture in the 30s. And in the 60s, and 80s...\n\nThe Tinpantithesis\n\nMusical theatre âpuristsâ really like to have âdefinitiveâ texts for all the great musicals. Often that is represented by the first production of a show, but not always. Shows like The Music Man, Gypsy, Oklahoma!, West Side Story, and Fiddler on the Roof pretty much have their scripts and scores etched in stone. You donât fiddle with them.\n\nBut with other shows, like Show Boat, Cabaret, Hair, Pippin, and Anything Goes, there is no single definitive version. These shows have changed so much and so often, in foreign productions, tours, and revivals â even during their original runs â that you canât really point to one version of any of these shows as canonical. Some might argue strenuously for the original Broadway productions of Cabaret, Grease, and Pippin, but the showsâ authors would likely disagree.\n\nThese âevolvingâ shows, and Anything Goes in particular, bring to mind the game Exquisite Corpse (for which a song in Hedwig is named). According to Wikipedia:\n\nalso known as exquisite cadaver (from the original French term cadavre exquis), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g. âThe adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun.â as in âThe green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.â) or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed.\n\nThe substantially rewritten, patchwork 1962 off Broadway revival is simply better musical theatre than the original. The 1987 revival is a bit closer to the original, and was weaker for it.\n\nA stroll through the 1962 Anything Goes score is eye-opening...\n\nThe first song, âYouâre the Top,â is in the original 1934 Anything Goes score, and set up pretty much the same way, but itâs late in Act I, right before the finale. And âBon Voyageâ is in pretty much the same spot in every production (although the â87 revival added its counterpoint song, âThereâs No Cure Like Travel,â which had been cut in â34)\n\nThe â62 version quotes instrumentally the sailorâs chantey, âThere Will Always Be a Lady Fair,â but does not include the vocals from 1934 (and â87). The â87 production also stuck in âI Like to Row on the Crew,â one of Porterâs college songs from Yale.\n\nBut where the â62 version has âItâs De-Lovely,â with Billy and Hope on deck, the original version has them singing âAll Through the Night.â Though the two songs sort of accomplish the same thing, the tone couldnât be more different. Replacing the serious, aching emotion of âAll Through the Nightâ with the smartass playfulness of âDe-Lovelyâ is an interesting move. âItâs De-Lovelyâ is actually from Porterâs 1936 show Red, Hot, and Blue, featuring Ethel Merman as a hard-boiled manicurist (not kidding) named âNailsâ OâReilly Duquesne, singing to her square lawyer boyfriend Bob, played by Bob Hope. It was first written but not used, for the 1936 film Born to Dance.\n\nItâs interesting in the transfer from one show to the other, how the smartass, streetwise woman becomes the smartass, streetwise guy (Billy); and the innocent, âsquareâ guy becomes the innocent, âsquareâ woman (Hope).\n\nWhere the â62 version has Bonnie and the angels singing, âHeaven Hop,â in 1934 the song âWhere are the Men?â was in that spot originally. âHeaven Hopâ is actually from the 1928 Porter show Paris. Itâs a more interesting song here, if for no other reason, the crazy mashing up of religion and pop culture in the lyric, perfect for Renoâs Angels. The song was added to Anything Goes in 1962 for dancer Margery Gray, who was playing Bonnie. It was originally staged by choreographer Ron Field on roller skates, but the raked stage proved a problem for the skates. No other versions of the show used this song.\n\nâFriendshipâ is originally from the 1939 musical DuBarry Was a Lady. The original Anything Goes script has âYouâre the Topâ in this spot, with only Reno and Billy. In â62, Reno, Moonie, and Billy sing âFriendship;â but in the later revivals, only Reno and Moonie sing it.\n\nThe â62 version then moves âI Get a Kick Out of You,â from the beginning of the show to late Act I, Originally, Reno was singing about being in love with Billy; but in the â62 version, sheâs singing about being in love with Sir Evelyn. Thatâs much more interesting and much more plot-driven. Porter first wrote this song for the 1931 musical Star Dust, which never even went into rehearsal. Most of that score is lost, but this song made it into Anything Goes.\n\nEvery version of the show ends the first act with âAnything Goes,â but the original also added a short dialogue scene after the song in which Hope walks out on Billy (which happens before the song in the other versions), and a short reprise of âYouâre the Top.â\n\nBoth the original and the â62 version start Act II with âPublic Enemy Number One,â although the original is much longer.\n\nâLetâs Step Outâ was added halfway through the original run of Porterâs Fifty Million Frenchmen, under the title, âStepping Out.â This may have been just an attempt to juice the energy early in the second act. In the original, the audience had to wait fourteen pages to get to the second song of Act II. In the â62 version, there are two songs in that gap. The other is âLetâs Misbehave,â one of Porterâs real gems, which was also written for the 1928 musical Paris, but cut before opening. The song was sung by two characters who are actors, Vivienne Rolland and Guy Pennel, whoâve been working together but only now realize they are in love.\n\nBut then Porter wrote his huge hit, âLetâs Do It,â and that replaced âLetâs Misbehave,â which then sat in a trunk till it was rescued in 1962.\n\nâAll Through the Nightâ in the â62 version is essentially where a reprise of âAll Through the Nightâ was in 1934. Originally, it was followed by âBe Like the Bluebirdâ; in the revival it was preceded by âBe Like the Bluebird.â\n\nBilly and Hope both sing âAll Through the Night,â but almost entirely separate, not together; their union is not real yet, itâs in the future, so they canât musically âcoupleâ by harmonizing yet. Then again, they do sing the last two lines together (in octaves), so thereâs still hope for them. In the original 1934 production, neither of them sang the last verse, which went to the menâs chorus. The songâs harmonic progression is fascinating, winding its way through various tonalities, until the home key is almost lost â like Billy and Hopeâs love. And almost the entire melody is in half-steps, slowly descending chromatically, working against the dreamy lyric, until the end of the main phrase suddenly leaps up with optimism. Itâs a beautiful sound picture.\n\nThe â62 revival fixed some real problem with pacing and narrative structure. In the original production, we took a break from plot at this point for Reno to sing âBuddie Beware,â and for Hope to sing âThe Gypsy in Me.â But in the â87 revival, they gave âBuddie Bewareâ to Bonnie (oddly renamed Erma), and gave âThe Gypsy in Meâ to Sir Evelyn.\n\nIn the â62 version, this spot goes to Reno and the Angels for âTake Me Back to Manhattan,â which is really from The New Yorkers (1930), Porterâs very adult musical satire about a rich woman who falls in love with a bootlegger. âTake Me Back to Manhattanâ was that showâs full company finale.\n\nMost of the versions of Anything Goes end with a short medley of âYouâre the Topâ and âAnything Goes,â though the 1934 script just has a stage direction saying they reprise âAnything Goes.â\n\nThe â62 revival version didnât just add a bunch of Porter songs; it remade the score, cutting four songs from the original: âThere Will Always Be a Lady Fair,â âWhere Are the Men?â, âBuddie Beware,â and âThe Gypsy in Me.â The 1987 revival put these last two back in, along with a song cut from the original, âEasy to Love,â which was too rangy for the original Billy. The later revivals also added Porterâs mediocre âGoodbye, Little Dream, Goodbye,â first written for the movie Born to Dance but cut, then added and cut again from Red, Hot, and Blue, finally landing as the only song in Terrence Rattiganâs London play, O Mistress Mine.\n\nCole Porter was as prolific as the Tin Pan Alley writers, but went beyond them in terms of originality and artistry â and sexuality. None of them could have written the epic, sprawling âBegin the Beguine,â or lyrics as culturally insightful and acrobatic as âYouâre the Top.â Irving Berlin was a great songwriter, but he didnât write more than a small handful of great theatre songs. Porter wrote a ton.\n\nArguably the reason Anything Goes has stayed so popular so long is the top-to-bottom rehab done to it off Broadway in 1962, when they sort of made the perfect Cole Porter musical.\n\nIâve Been a Sinner, Iâve Been a Scamp\n\nA lot of musical theatre fans love Anything Goes, but consider it a guilty pleasure, the artsy equivalent of Mississippi mud cake, just a mindless, old-fashioned musical comedy confection. They register great surprise to hear it described as a sharp satire.\n\nBut it is.\n\nMusical comedy had dealt in gentle social satire since the beginning, but Anything Goes was the first successful Broadway musical comedy to build its story on two parallel threads of fierce, pointed, cultural satire. This time the plot came out of the satirical agenda, rather than the satire being just a fun side joke. Anything Goes was a dead-on satirical chronicle of That Moment... which also happen to be This Moment.\n\nMaybe weâre just too used to Anything Goes at this point, to see it as it once was. But this is a show that includes a mock religious hymn to a (supposed) murderer, skeet shooting with a machine gun, a love song that mentions snorting coke, and a parody religious revival meeting featuring a song with a slyly sexual hook line. If you doubt the double entendre of âBlow Gabriel, Blow,â this is the same songwriter who wrote in the title song, âIf love affairs you like with young bears you like...â That meant then what it means today. And notice in the scene leading up to the song, most of the confessions are sexual. Reno is presented as an explicitly sexual presence from the beginning.\n\nBut Reno is also a religious figure, and in âBlow, Gabriel, Blow,â she taps into the 1934 zeitgeist. During the Depression, many American believed that they were living through the âgreat tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.â (Matthew 24:21) So riffing on that, Reno and her angels (weâre probably supposed to assume this is one of their regular numbers) pray for the archangel to signal the end of the tribulations (Prohibition, the Depression) and announce with his trumpet the coming of Christ. Reno assures Gabriel sheâs ready to âtrim [her] lamp,â a Bible metaphor meaning sheâll work at and maintain her faith (to keep oil lamps burning brightly and consistently, you have to trim the wick back), that sheâs mended her ways (we can only guess what those ways included), that now, âIâm good by day and Iâm good by night.â Of course, that line assumes that Reno hasnât always been âgood by night.â\n\nBut these âsinnersâ arenât asking for forgiveness or anything; they just want to âplay all day in the Promised Land.â Itâs a remarkably crass take on the Book of Revelationâs thousand years of peace and righteousness. And all this to jazz music, until recently considered the devilâs music...\n\nIn one section, they all chant:\n\nSatan, you stay away from me,\n\nâCause you ainât the man I wanna see!\n\nIâm gonna be good as the day I was born,\n\nâCause I heard that man with the horn!\n\nDo ya hear it?\n\nOnce you really pay attention to this lyric, you realize this section is all about the End Times. They want to be good, because Jesus and Judgment Day are coming soon!\n\nOne of the more subtle jokes in the show is in this song, when the women take the melody and the men sing âSwing Low, Sweet Chariotâ in counterpart, also a song about angels taking âmeâ to heaven. Since this is the male passengers and crew singing this counter-melody, are we to read that as spontaneous, that religious fervor is taking them over? Since this is always a big, involved, full-company, Broadway musical comedy dance number, it lays on top of our fake revival meeting an even more cynical layer of comment â religion is literally show business.\n\nBut thereâs even more swimming around in Anything Goes. When the show opened in late 1934, Prohibition had ended just a year earlier, but the Depression rolled on, and the Dust Bowl kept destroying lives. The FBI was at the height of its notoriety, but the public loved some of the gangsters on the FBIâs Most Wanted list (which is the whole point of âPublic Enemy Number Oneâ). Importantly, the FBI â standing in for law and order in general â is not on board the S.S. American. In fact, they arrest the wrong guy at the beginning of the show, and leave the ship! Theyâre not up to the job. They canât/wonât protect us. Was this a comment on how hard it was for law enforcement to catch Americaâs celebrity criminals, John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, Bonnie & Clyde, et al.?\n\nOn the other hand, we find out early in the show that the FBI has caught Snake Eyes Johnson, which is in tune with the fact that every celebrity criminal mentioned above was shot and killed in 1934, just before Anything Goes opened.\n\nHere on the S.S. American, we are in Shakespeareâs metaphorical woods, away from laws and civilization, where two things will happen. First, love will get âfixedâ as our characters de-couple from the wrong partners and re-couple with the right partners. Second, with lots of liquor and very little âlaw,â these passengers are free to act on their impulses, to chase after various forms of vice, to be their ânaturalâ selves. And notice that the ship is called the âAmericanâ â this place of no rules and no law is 1930s America, where (until a year earlier) lots of Americans broke the law by drinking alcohol. When that many Americans broke the law, when they stopped believing in the institutions that failed them, America became functionally lawless.\n\nBy calling the ship the S.S. American, the showâs writers were underlining their social commentary. As a comic microcosm of our country, these passengers showcase the worst of the American inclination to make celebrities out of criminals and show biz out of religion, an inclination as prevalent today as it was in the thirties. But the satiric aim is more pointed than just those two overarching themes. So what else does Anything Goes satirize? A lot.\n\nEven though economists will tell you the 1929 stock market crash did not âcauseâ the Depression, it was still the starting pistol, and most people in 1934 believed rich Wall Street types were to blame. Notice that in Anything Goes we have two representatives of Wall Street â the drunken, horny, nearly blind Mr. Whitney, and the shit-disturbing rogue Billy Crocker. The name Crocker comes from the French for âheartbreak.â In this story Wall Street is decidedly undependable.\n\nThe real-life Richard Whitney had been the very famous president of the New York Stock Exchange and during the 1930s, he was famed for steering his clients through the treacherous waters of the Depression. But his success was a scam of the proportions of Enron and Bernie Madoff, and he was finally caught in 1938 when his firm collapsed. Still, as audiences watched Anything Goes in 1934, Whitney was the hero of the rich, so naming Billyâs boss Whitney â and making him a drunk â was a pretty subversive reference. According to Wikipedia:\n\nOn October 24, 1929, Black Thursday, Whitney attempted to avert the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Alarmed by rapidly falling stock prices, several leading Wall Street bankers met to find a solution to the panic and chaos on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange. The meeting included Thomas W. Lamont, acting head of Morgan Bank; Albert Wiggin, head of the Chase National Bank; and Charles E. Mitchell, president of the National City Bank of New York. They chose Whitney, then vice president of the Exchange, to act on their behalf.\n\nWith the bankersâ financial resources behind him, Whitney went onto the floor of the Exchange and ostentatiously placed a bid to purchase a large block of shares in U.S. Steel at a price well above the current market. As traders watched, Whitney then placed similar bids on other âblue chipâ stocks. This tactic was similar to a tactic that had ended the Panic of 1907, and succeeded in halting the slide that day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average recovered with a slight increase, closing with it down only 6.38 points for that day. In this case, however, the respite was only temporary; stocks subsequently collapsed catastrophically on Black Tuesday, October 29. Whitneyâs actions gained him the sobriquet, âWhite Knight of Wall Street.â\n\nThe Harcourts (and Mrs. Wentworth, in the â34 version) stand in for Americaâs âcafe society,â the 1% of 1934. In the original version of the show, the Harcourtsâ family business was in serious trouble and needed saving, which was the reason for the arranged marriage. Is it any wonder Billy and Hope both would like to escape this culture? According to an article on the PBS website:\n\nThe Great Depression was partly caused by the great inequality between the rich who accounted for a third of all wealth and the poor who had no savings at all. As the economy worsened many lost their fortunes, and some members of high society were forced to curb their extravagant lifestyles.\n\nBut for others the Depression was simply an inconvenience especially in New York where the cityâs glamorous venues â places to see and be seen â such as El Morocco and The Stork Club were heaving with celebrities, socialites and aristocrats. For the vast majority the 1930s was a time of misery, but for many American dynastic families, parties helped to escape the reality on the street and the grander the better.\n\nParties and trans-Atlantic cruises.\n\nMany stories of the Great Depression show us the shattered and disenfranchised turning to religion in their time of need. But church attendance grew during the Depression only about five percent. Notably, no one aboard the S.S. American in Anything Goes has that spiritual need, and so for these people religion becomes show business, entertainment, the latest fad. Though the content of âBlow, Gabriel, Blowâ is basically reverent, the songâs rowdy, fast, jazz music quickly and comically short-circuits any hint of real religion fervor. This is religion as drunken party.\n\nThe only genuine symbol of religion we see in the show is the comically clueless Bishop Dobson, whoâs banished from this community (i.e., mistakenly arrested) before the ship even sets sail; and all weâre left with is the fake religion of fake-minister âDr.â Moon, and the gambling âChristian converts.â Genuine religion (and conventional morality), the Baptist tent revivals and religious radio shows of the 1930s, are all missing from this place. Here there is no moral control â itâs Shakespeareâs woods.\n\nIn the 1930s, the 1960s, and also today, Dark Times bring forth the most pointed satire. Anything Goes opened halfway through the Depression, which also begat brilliant satires like Of Thee I Sing, Let âEm Eat Cake, and The Cradle Will Rock.. The 1962 revival opened at the start of one of the most divided, angry decades in American history. The 1987 revival opened on the infamous Black Monday, the day the stock market crashed again.\n\nNone of the showâs targets feel dated, because weâre struggling with all the same things now. Still today, religion is often repackaged as slick, high-budget show biz. When Americaâs evangelicals strongly support the womanizing vulgarian and sexual predator Donald Trump, religion in America is on life support. And still today, we make celebrities out of criminals, and depending where the various investigations lead, Trump may be the best illustration of that too.\n\nCole Porterâs songs have all the bite, the sophistication, and the smartass humor of Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg, but Porterâs songs often bite a little harder, his lyrics closer to how people talk, instead of always just building toward a funny rhyme. Like those of the great George M. Cohan, Porterâs lyrics sound like they could actually come out of the mouths of the characters. If his songs can often be transplanted from one show to another, thatâs only because many of his shows were about the same kind of people â smartass, subversive, sexual, clever, ironic, complicated, and contradictory. Just think for a second about all the characters in Anything Goes that have contradictory impulses.\n\nPorter wrote both in contemporary slang and in genuinely elevated, powerfully poetic language when the moment called for it. His songs can be emotionally shattering and they can be icily cynical, about the most intimate insecurities or the most macro satire. Porter and his co-writers were writing old-school musical comedy, but they were also chronicling our times â hen and now â most insightfully.\n\nThereâs an Old Australian Bush Song\n\nAlmost every song in Cole Porterâs Anything Goes score has a trick or a central joke to it.\n\nNow to be fair, thatâs not true of every song in the original 1934 production, which included some very conventional musical comedy songs, among its sharp satire. But with the 1962 revival, its deletion of those more conventional songs and the addition of quite a few Porter songs from other musicals â the â62 revival essentially created a Porter âgreatest hitsâ show, sort of like My One and Only. And with this new Frankenstein score, it really is true that almost every song brings some awesome surprises.\n\nMore so than most musicals, quite a few songs in Anything Goes (talking about the â62 version) are diegetic, meaning the act of singing is part of the action, and not just the language of the storytelling. In Anything Goes, the characters clearly know theyâre singing in âBlow, Gabriel, Blowâ and âPublic Enemy Number One,â âLetâs Step Out,â and âHeaven Hopâ (since they describe the dance in the lyric), âBe Like the Bluebirdâ (âan old Australian bush songâ which Moon says heâll ârenderâ for Billy); and arguably âYouâre the Top,â âFriendship,â and âAnything Goes.â The only songs that are definitely not diegetic are âAll Through the Night,â âI Get a Kick Out of You,â and maybe âDe-Lovely.â Certainly in âYouâre the Top,â âFriendship,â and âDe-Lovely,â they are at least joking and/or performing for each other, if not âsinging.â\n\nThereâs so much to this score that people donât recognize...\n\nâYouâre the Topâ is one of the theatreâs great list songs. Billy and Hope are ironically complimenting each other by comparing them to celebrities and trendy brand names â essentially turning Gandhi, Botticelli, and the Mona Lisa into consumer brands. And notice how often the lyric sets old European images (the Tower of Pisa) against the newest American images of the moment (cellophane), again a very subtle nod to the coming story, in which Hope has to choose between Old Europe (Evelyn) and up-to-date America (Billy).\n\nMore than anything, âYouâre the Topâ is just a big goof, but one with a pretty sharp satiric edge. Though itâs awfully subtle, it lays down one of the two central themes of the show, our American obsession with celebrity and consumerism. Itâs almost a love song, but it comically filters that love through the ironic lens of materialism and celebrity worship: I love you because youâre as wonderful as Ovaltine. And that irony supports the story here, since Reno has feelings for Billy, but Billy doesnât feel the same.\n\nâItâs De-Lovelyâ pokes fun at lyricists like Ira Gershwin and Yip Harburg, who made up crazy words in their lyrics, something Porter actually did a lot less. More often than not, when a Porter song does it, itâs because the characters are âplaying;â so the made-up words help define character and maybe story. Notice how organically the gimmick is used in this song â the first time, we hear two real words first (âitâs delightful, itâs deliciousâ) and then the made-up word (âitâs de-lovelyâ). The more we get into the song, the sillier the words get.\n\nBut Porter earns it all with his invention of the word tinpantithesis, in Hopeâs intro verse, a made-up word that towers above those of Gershwin and Harburg. Hope worries that her song/singing may be the opposite â the antithesis â of âmelody,â i.e., good music, pretty music. But itâs not just the opposite, sheâs warning him; itâs also kind of tacky and common. Itâs the Tin Pan Alley antithesis of good music, or in Porterspeak, the âTinpantithesis.â Thatâs awfully good writing, and particularly fun in the middle of a song about making up words. Ultimately Hope decides the embarrassment is not worth it, and sheâll âskip the damn thing and sing the refrain.â But by the time she makes this decision, she has already finished the verse â about whether or not to sing the verse. Thatâs incredibly âmetaâ for 1934 â sheâs literally singing about her singing.\n\nBut what many people miss is Hope is making a joke! Billy has been clowning around, and Hope decides to join the fun. Itâs the first time we see the âfunâ Hope; and the first time we really see that thereâs a Carefree Hope that Billy rode around the park with all night, in contrast to the Respectable Hope who has accepted her obligations dutifully. Which Hope wins the tug-of-war will tell us whoâll she marry. As if we donât already know.\n\nAlso interesting is the ethnic dialect humor, still part of American comedy in 1934 â âdâvallopâ (the wallop, as in âit packs a wallop,â i.e., a powerful effect), âde vinnerâ (the winner), âdâvoiksâ (the works, meaning âitâs everythingâ).\n\nâHeaven Hopâ makes fun of the pop songs that invented new dance âcrazesâ in the 20s and 30s, cataloging the moves in the lyrics. Even though this song isnât originally from Anything Goes, it fits surprisingly well here, since we have some angels hanging around.\n\nâFriendshipâ is one of three songs in the show in which characters are just playing, and consciously trying to amuse â even crack up â their friends, alongside âYouâre the Topâ and âItâs De-Lovely.â Itâs interesting that both Reno and Billy and are in two of those songs, and Billy is in all three; they are the âplayfulâ characters, from whom the other characters have to learn about joy before our story ends.\n\nâI Get a Kick Out of Youâ is much more intense than we usually recognize, maybe because we know it too well. But whatâs the central point of this song? I donât feel emotions and never have, but Iâm starting to feel something for the first time. Literally âeverything leaves me totally cold.â Thatâs quite an admission from the saucy, sassy, smartass speakeasy hostess. None of the usual thrills â alcohol, drugs, or adventure (flying in a plane) â can thrill her, only âyou.â And then right before the final verse, we find out her love is not returned. Wow.\n\nIn the original version, Reno starts the show with this, and itâs about her feelings for Billy. In the revivals, this song comes along late in Act I, and now itâs about Renoâs feelings for Evelyn. Itâs much stronger in terms of story structure when it comes later â here it reveals something weâre already suspecting, and it sets up one of the narrative threads that will get resolved in Act II.\n\nPorter loved to use the latest slang, but interestingly, kick meaning âsurge or fit of pleasureâ (often as kicks) goes back only to 1941, though the related meaning; âstimulation from liquor or drugsâ (the first two verses) goes back to 1844. Anything Goes opened in 1934. Did Porter put that later meaning into our language? Or are we reading that word differently than Porter meant it? Was he using that older meaning in a new way, suggesting that for Reno this feeling of love is a jolt of intoxication, not just a nice diversion...? Or does it feel that way to Reno because sheâs never felt anything before...?\n\nBy the time we get to the end of the act and the title song, almost every character has been thrown for a loop. Almost every characterâs world has been thrown out of balance. And everybody in the audience knows what that feels like. And then Reno says (sings) what we all know: Life is Fucking Crazy. Literally anything goes.\n\nThe title of the show and the Act I finale has gotten too familiar to us. The impact of the phrase, âAnything Goes,â has dulled over the years, maybe because itâs always associated with this âold musical.â But this lyric is incredibly well-crafted and tells us so much about that moment in our history, in the midst of great cultural changes. By the end of the song, we realize the title refers ironically both to the wild abandon of the 20s, and the unbelievable hardship and challenges of the 30s, yin and yang.\n\nThe end of the first act leaves us with a plot cliff-hanger (has Billy lost both hope and Hope?), a big, noisy, full-company dance number, but also a feeling of slight unease â our world really is that screwed up!\n\nAnd then off you go to intermission..\n\nâPublic Enemy Number One,â a satiric hymn, starts Act II with what feels like a one-joke throwaway, but itâs not. This song is the convergence of the showâs two main themes â the way Americans turn religion into show business and criminals into celebrities. In this song, they turn a (supposed) criminal into a celebrity, and then into a religious figure, in a satiric exaggeration of the publicâs love affair with real celebrity criminals of the 30s, like Bonnie & Clyde, John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, et al. The irony here is even thicker because the audience knows Billy isnât really a criminal â and inside the story, so do Moon, Bonnie, Reno, Hope, and the Angels.\n\nItâs also interesting to note that in 1934, the Anything Goes audience wasnât there to see if Billy and Hope got together in the end. They were there to see three top show biz celebrities, Ethel Merman, William Gaxton, and Victor Moore â and arguably by this point, Cole Porter himself was as big a celebrity. The audience was laughing at the onstage passengers being seduced by celebrity, but the audience had been seduced too...\n\nEven the seemingly innocuous âLetâs Step Outâ has the twin agendas of commenting on Bonnieâs âclassâ divide from the other passengers, as the moll of the countryâs most dangerous criminal; but she also rails against the gloom and seriousness of the Depression, after the wild years of the 1920s. Itâs weirdly synchronistic that the passengers sing the twisted, morally upside-down hymn âPublic Enemy Number Oneâ to Billy, believing him to be Bonnieâs boyfriend â just before Bonnie herself enters and chides them for their pointless solemnity. Unlike most of the passengers, she gets how crazy all of this is. She also knows that with Snake Eyes in the care of the FBI, sheâs safe now â so why not party and flirt?\n\nâLetâs Misbehave,â on the other hand, was a brilliant â62 interpolation. Evelyn didnât get a song in 1934, because he was more a device than a main character. In 1962, with more focus on the Evelyn-Reno romance, the two of them got âLetâs Misbehaveâ in Act II, where Evelyn starts to cut loose for the first time in his life, which helps the audience root for this relationship. In the â87 revival, Evelyn got âThe Gypsy in Meâ instead, which had belonged to Hope in â34. And while âGypsyâ is a fun number for Evelyn, âLetâs Misbehaveâ is much better at character, relationship, and plot advancement.\n\nWe donât just need to know Evelyn will loosen up; we need to know heâs found his primal animal side (âweâre merely mammalsâ), and also how perfectly he and Reno fit each other. Note that while Billy and Hope get songs about marriage (âDe-Lovelyâ) and chaste yearning (âAll Through the Nightâ), Evelyn and Reno get a song about carnality. Evelyn doesnât invoke Romeo and Juliet, or Abelard and Heloise; no, he invokes Adam and Eve â lovers in a state of pure nature, before morality, before judgment, before clothing. We are indeed in Shakespeareâs woods here, and Reno and Evelyn are de-coupling from the wrong partners and re-coupling here with the right partners.\n\nThatâs why weâre here, after all. Itâs sort of parallel to A Midsummer Nightâs Dream, if you think of the starry night sky, or maybe Cole Porterâs intoxicating score, as a substitute for Puckâs magic drops. The show works less well without âLetâs Misbehaveâ in that spot.\n\nâBlow, Gabriel, Blowâ runs head-on at one of the showâs two main themes, the turning of religion into show business. More on that laterâ¦\n\nâAll Through the Nightâ has a fairly conventional early musical comedy point â we can only be together in our dreams! In the â62 version, Billy and Hope sing exactly the same verses; in â34 the second verse was slightly altered. Though the lyric is fairly conventional, delivering no information we donât already have, dealing in awfully conventional images, the music is extraordinary.\n\nMusicals are more powerful, more impactful, more emotional than plays, because of the abstract nature of music, the non-verbal language of emotion. âAll Through the Nightâ lacks the irony of the rest of the score, but it works so well because the music tells us as much (or more) about Billy and Hopeâs feelings than the words do. Almost the entire main melody descends chromatically by half-steps, making the music feel like it doesnât have a home key, like the melody is just spinning out spontaneously, endlessly shifting back and forth between major and minor, happy and sad â and sinking ever further down into despair. Itâs anchor-less, restless, uneasy, but also hauntingly beautiful.\n\nThe original version of the show used âAll Through the Nightâ midway through Act I, as Billy and Hopeâs first song together. In that spot, itâs too serious, too sincere for this crazy romp of a show, but repositioned here in Act II (where there was originally only a short reprise), it works beautifully.\n\nâBe Like the Bluebirdâ is so crazy and so meta! Take a look at Mooneyâs intro verse:\n\nThereâs an old Australian bush song,\n\nThat Melba used to sing,\n\nA song that always cheered me\n\nWhen I was blue.\n\nEven Melba said this bush song\n\nWas a helluva song to sing,\n\nSo be quiet whilst I render it for you...\n\nThereâs so much thatâs funny about this. First, Mooney starts by invoking the famous Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba (for whom Melba Toast is named), who had just died in 1931. A âbush songâ is an Australian folk song (one famous example of this is âWaltzing Matildaâ). Itâs funny that this world famous opera singer would think this folk song is âa helluva song to singâ â does that mean itâs a great song or a hard song? After all, Mooney himself then sings it. And as we listen to it, we realize this is not an Australian bush song â itâs just a Cole Porter comedy number. But that intro turns the whole thing into a very wacky meta-joke. Also, Mooney is singing about himself singing here, just like Hope does in âDe-Lovelyâ\n\nAnd whatâs the lesson Mooney is trying to impart to Billy? Just to chill, to take life as it comes, to be more Zen. Again, what a funny lesson to come from this mediocre gangster whoâs nervous as a cat. The whole number is a big meta goof.\n\nâTake Me Back to Manhattan,â as good a song as it is, doesnât need to be here. They sing the same verse two and a half times, and it gives us virtually no information beyond that these New Yorkers would rather be in New York, instead of docking in London. On the other hand, it does sort of connect to the two interlocking love triangles â Hope has to choose between Evelyn (London) and Billy (New York), and we know Evelyn himself has chosen New York (Reno). In fact, everybody will choose New York... other than Reno, I guess...\n\nMaybe also, âTake Me Back to Manhattanâ reminds us that weâve been in Shakespeareâs woods all night, a place of freedom and magic, but now that everyone is finding their correct partners, they will have to return to the world of the City with their newfound wisdom.\n\nYes, Anything Goes is very silly and somewhat old-fashioned, but itâs also a lot more than that. This is a really well-constructed, satiric farce, and as you can see, these songs are much richer than they might appear.\n\nWeâre Merely Mammals\n\nToday, most people think Anything Goes is old-fashioned and family-friendly. But really, itâs a very adult show, and it was never meant to be family-friendly. After all, the title is Anything Goes! One verse of the title song even catalogs various sexual tastes that are newly acceptable...\n\nNot much about this show was conventional. The musical comedy had begun thirty years earlier by consciously rejecting tales of rich folks and royalty in operettas, in favor of stories of common people, immigrants, average working Joes and Janes. But as one of the only gentiles writing Broadway scores at the time, as a native of Peru, Indiana, as the heir to a considerable fortune, and as a relatively open gay man, Porter wasnât interested in immigrants or in common people. He had spent time in Paris alongside Ernest Hemmingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Pablo Picasso, and Gertrude Stein.\n\nSo Porter wrote his songs about smart, glamorous, rich, sophisticated, sexual people. His lyrics were dripping with French phrases, dirty jokes, references to high society names, new brand names, exclusive night clubs, trans-Atlantic cruises... and Americaâs complicated relationship with morality, after the debacle of Prohibition.\n\nAt its core, Anything Goes is a comic but pointed exploration of amorality and moral irony. The characters we like the most, our âheroesâ (Reno, Moonface, Billy) are the least âdecent;â and the most âdecentâ character (Sir Evelyn) is the antagonist (sort of).\n\nJohn Waters would be right at home here.\n\nReno stands in for America in the aftermath of the repeal of Prohibition in the early 1930s â going from moral purity (as an evangelist) under Prohibition to moral sin (as a nightclub singer) after the repeal. Her big song âBlow, Gabriel, Blowâ slyly, ironically suggests that America should ârepentâ for the sin of repealing Prohibition (or is it for the sin of enacting Prohibition?). Mooneyâs rise in social status aboard the ship mirrors the way gangsters and rum runners, now wealthy, became respectable members of âhigh societyâ after Prohibition was repealed.\n\nReligious references pop up throughout the show, usually revealing religious or moral hypocrisy. Reno is a former evangelist, now nightclub singer; her backup singers are called her âfallen angels;â thereâs a bishop who gets arrested, leaving his two Christian converts to fend for themselves; Moonface becomes the Reverend Dr. Moon; âPublic Enemy Number Oneâ is a parody of a hymn, worshiping celebrity rather than God; âBlow, Gabriel, Blowâ is essentially a revival meeting that sounds like a sex act, complete with phony confessions and repentance. And early in the show, Reno comically merges her two sides when she says to the hard-drinking Mr. Whitney, âCome, let us lead them beside distilled waters.â Religion, meet Speakeasy.\n\nUltimately, Hope (and Anything Goes) chooses love and authentic emotion over money, position, and obligation. America isnât totally lost, the showâs creators are saying. The romantic marginalization of Sir Evelyn by Hope is an echo of Americaâs marginalization of Europe after World War I. America was now the Super Power, and we didnât need Europe anymore. Hopeâs mother thinks they need Evelyn (no doubt the Harcourt fortune was decimated by the crash), but Hope doesnât agree. In fact, in the original production, Evelyn didnât even get his own song, even though he was a secondary lead. Both Hope and the show â and ultimately Evelyn â reject Britain in favor of America.\n\nThe showâs plot turns on such an odd love story â Reno loves Billy, who loves Hope, but Reno ends up with Hopeâs fiancÃ©, an explicitly heterosexual character who is subliminally coded as gay (he has a womanâs name and tells Moonface he has âhot pantsâ for him). Not your standard musical comedy plot â especially in 1934. Is Evelyn an ironic stand-in for the gay but married Cole Porter? The subliminally gay sidekick was a staple of the Astaire-Rogers movies, though here the character has been considerably fleshed out, and he gets a wife by the end. But does Renoâs cut song, âKate the Greatâ suggest that it will be an âopen marriageâ...?\n\nThe relationships in our story are like those in A Little Night Music, in which the characters start with the wrong partners and have to reshuffle before the evening is over. This weird mismatching may be easier to understand in the revivals, with âLetâs Misbehaveâ added in the 60s and âThe Gypsy In Meâ added in the 80s, explicitly giving Evelyn a hetero sex drive.\n\nThough Anything Goes trafficked in smart social satire, it was as horny as it was clever. Sex pervades the whole show (âBlow, Gabriel, Blowââ¦?), and it is made more explicit in âLetâs Misbehave.â But that title isnât as random as it sounds to us today. âMisbehaviorâ presented as fun rather than as sin was something fairly new in 1934. Samuel Schmalhausen, a popularizer of Sigmund Freudâs work, wrote in his 1928 book Why We Misbehave:\n\nStatic morality has been repudiated in favor of dynamic experience. Fear yields its sovereignty reluctantly to fun. Passionâs coming of age heralds the dawn of a new orientation in the life of the sexes. We may sum up the quintessence of the sexual revolution by saying that the center of gravity has shifted from procreation to recreation.\n\nSchmalhausen extolled the virtue of playful sex:\n\nSexual love as happy recreation is the clean new ideal of a younger generation sick of duplicity and moral sham and marital insincerity and general erotic emptiness. Sex as recreation is the most exquisite conception of lovers who have learned to look with frank delighted eyes upon the wonder in their own stirred bodies.\n\nA year later in 1929, satirists James Thurber and E. B. White wrote the book Is Sex Necessary?, in which they argued:\n\nDuring the past year, two factors in our civilization have been greatly overemphasized. One is aviation, the other is sex. Looked at calmly, neither diversion is entitled to the space it has been accorded. Each has been deliberately promoted. In the case of aviation, persons interested in the sport saw that the problem was to simplify it and make it seem safer. With sex, the opposite was true. Everybody was fitted for it, but there was a lack of general interest. The problem in this case was to make sex seem more complex and dangerous. This task was taken up by sociologists, analysts, gynecologists, psychologists and authors; they approached it with a good deal of scientific knowledge and an immense zeal. They joined forces and made the whole matter of sex complicated beyond the wildest dreams of our fathers. The country became flooded with books. Sex, which had hitherto been a physical expression, became largely mental. The whole order of things changed. To prepare for marriage, young girls no longer assembled a hope chest â they read books on abnormal psychology. If they finally did marry they found themselves with a large number of sex books on hand, but almost no pretty underwear.\n\nAnd thatâs what Porter was writing about, when he wrote âLetâs Misbehaveâ in 1928.\n\nThe World Has Gone Mad Today\n\nMany of Cole Porterâs lyrics are incredibly â even savagely â topical. The songs of Anything Goes reference the latest news, gossip, pop culture, and celebrity sightings of 1934, and yet in a way thatâs fully organic to the characters and story. Thereâs no question Reno Sweeney and Billy Crocker would be making jokes about this stuff.\n\nFrom our vantage point today, close to a century later, weâre apt to miss some of that wicked social satire, because so many of the original references are now obscure to us. So subsequent revivals have tinkered a lot with the lyrics to âYouâre the Topâ and âAnything Goes,â in particular, worried that contemporary audiences wonât get all the original references (they wonât), and as a result, exploring these lyrics sometimes requires a lot of digging.\n\nThis show brilliantly captures some of Americaâs craziest cultural impulses, most of which are very little different today from what they were in 1934. Anything Goes wasnât really telling a love story; it was telling the story of America awkwardly struggling with the huge social and technological changes that were transforming our nation from a rural culture to an urban one, and consequently a more diverse and socially liberal one; and from a social-status culture to one based on economic status.\n\nThough it was surely unintentional, one could argue that Reno marrying Evelyn is a clear metaphor for the way, for the first time in the 20s and 30s, Americans routinely combined âlow cultureâ and âhigh culture.â In fact that mashup essentially defines American musical comedy.\n\nToday, some frightened conservatives long to return to a mythical, nonexistent 1950s thatâs whiter, more Christian, and less complicated; and so too did folks in the 1930s fear the massive cultural changes reshaping America. This show, its title, and its title song are all about that.\n\nEvery version of the show starts the title song the same way.\n\nTimes have changed,\n\nAnd weâve often rewound the clock,\n\nSince the Puritans got a shock,\n\nWhen they landed on Plymouth Rock.\n\nIf today,\n\nAny shock they should try to stem,\n\nâStead of landing on Plymouth Rock,\n\nPlymouth Rock would land on them.\n\nItâs a double joke, built on the two meanings of land, and comically comparing the relative shocks of finding the New World, versus those same 17th-century pilgrims finding the wild nightlife of 1934 New York. Kinda sounds like a Bill & Ted sequel.\n\nThereâs actually a lot going on here. The times do change and when they do, some people fear that change, and they react by trying to turn us back to an earlier era (âweâve often rewound the clockâ), a time perceived to be more innocent, more faithful, more moral. With Ronald Reagan and some of the conservative movement today, the 1960s so freaked them out, that ever since then theyâve been trying to turn American back to the 1950s. The same thing happened in the 1920s and 30s.\n\nItâs telling that Porter invokes the Puritans â the symbol of social ultra-conservatism â as a comic measure of the wild times we find ourselves in ânow.â No, the Puritanâs likely would not have been big fans of speakeasies or The Ziegfeld Follies...\n\nAs the first verse of the song begins, we set up this comparison. Once upon a time, so long ago that the days are not just old, but âolden,â America was really moral. Except that the use of the archaic âoldenâ (Porter originally used âformerâ in that spot), and the extremity of just a âglimpseâ being shocking, gives the whole thing a layer of smartass irony. Whoâd want to live in âolden daysâ...?\n\nIn olden days a glimpse of stocking\n\nWas looked on as something shocking,\n\nBut now, God knows,\n\nAnything Goes.\n\nWomenâs modesty was a big issue as skirts got shorter, arms got bared, and dresses got more form-fitting. The androgynous, body-disguising, chest-flattening fashions of the 20s were gone. Throughout history, thereâs always been this weird impulse to hide womenâs bodies for fear men canât control their sexual urges (this is what the final scene of Grease is about). Itâs only now that weâre concluding itâs the men who need to control themselves.\n\nWeâve become numb to the title phrase of this song. Itâs just too ubiquitous, too embedded in our culture. But think about that phrase â anything goes, anything is okay, nothing is off limits, there are no rules, no norms, no constraints anymore.\n\nGood authors too, who once knew better words,\n\nNow only use four letter words\n\nWriting prose,\n\nAnything Goes.\n\nWhat was Porter talking about here?\n\nJames Joyceâs 1922 masterpiece Ulysses, was banned in England till 1930, and the United States Post Office reportedly burned any copies of the book they found. Finally, in 1933 (a year before Anything Goes opened), the case of Ulysses was re-opened, and the Supreme Court ruled that because the book was not âpornographicâ it could not be banned or censored.\n\nD.H. Lawrenceâs 1928 novel Lady Chatterlyâs Lover, about an aristocratic lady who has a sexual affair with her groundskeeper was also banned over its frank discussion of sex (and the importance of orgasm), and its frequent use of the words fuck and cunt. One U.S. Senator exclaimed, âIâve not taken ten minutes on Lady Chatterleyâs Lover, outside of looking at its opening pages. It is most damnable! It is written by a man with a diseased mind and a soul so black that he would obscure even the darkness of hell!â\n\nErskine Caldwellâs 1933 novel Godâs Little Acre was about a dysfunctional farming family in Georgia obsessed with sex and wealth. The novelâs sexual themes were so controversial that the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice asked a New York state court to censor it.\n\nIn 1934, Henry Millerâs semi-autobiographical novel of his sexual escapades in Paris, Tropic of Cancer, with its frequent use of the word cunt, was banned in the United States shortly after its first publication in France. The ACLU tried to sue the U.S. government, but lost its case. Finally, when the novel was published in 1961, sixty obscenity cases were brought in twenty-one different states. Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Michael Musmanno wrote that Cancer is ânot a book. It is a cesspool, an open sewer, a pit of putrefaction, a slimy gathering of all that is rotten in the debris of human depravity.â Porter wasnât kidding about four-letter words. This really was a sea change in popular literature.\n\nThe song âAnything Goesâ has three bridges, each with a different purpose. The first lists examples of âimmoralâ acts which lead, in the second bridge, to a general moral chaos, which leads, in the third bridge, to how crazy that chaos makes us all. Itâs an ironic jab at all the experts of the time warning about the dangers of Modernity.\n\nThe songâs first bridge lists a bunch of morally sketchy things that âyouâ (so interesting to put this in the second person!) might enjoy if you live a Fast Life, things which will no longer be off limits in our topsy-turvy culture...\n\nIf driving fast cars you like,\n\nIf low bars you like,\n\nIf old hymns you like,\n\nIf bare limbs you like,\n\nIf Mae West you like\n\nOr me undressed you like,\n\nWhy, nobody will oppose.\n\nWhen every night,\n\nThe set thatâs smart is\n\nIntruding\n\nIn nudist parties\n\nIn studios,\n\nAnything Goes.\n\nBefore we get to the content, letâs look at the craft here. The bridge has seven lines and five of them start with âif,â and six of them end with âyou likeâ â and in between an AABBCC rhyme scheme. Thatâs some really skillful writing. Then we return to the verse, and of those six lines, three start with âin,â and those same three lines all have an â-oodâ in the middle of the line. But also âsmart isâ makes a kind of subliminal rhyme with âparties,â and to top it all off, the last line of the bridge rhymes with the last two lines of the verse that follows it.\n\nIn terms of content, much of this lyric references current events. In 1930, twelve states still did not have any speed limits; it was an automobile wild west.\n\nThe âlow barsâ (i.e., speakeasies) of Prohibition were disappearing by the time Anything Goes opened, a year after the repeal of Prohibition. The reference is a joke on the two meanings of the word low. Here the word means disreputable, but also, literally lower in height. According to a 1946 Life magazine article, before Prohibition, bars were 46-47 inches high, but during and after Prohibition, so many more women were drinking that they lowered many bars to 43 inches.\n\nThe âold hymnsâ reference may be a joke about how many hymns were set to the music of drinking songs because those tunes were already popular. Why else would liking old hymns be subversive like the rest of the items in this list? Maybe the joke here is just that âyouâ like drinking in taverns, where they sing old hymns that have been converted into drinking songs.\n\nOf course, âbare limbsâ were still pretty new in womenâs fashion and still considered shocking by some. Mae West was still a new movie star in 1934, but she already had been writing plays, starring in them, and getting arrested for her playsâ âobscenity.â After the Hollywood Production Code was established in 1933, West simply perfected the double entente, with famous lines like âWhen Iâm good, Iâm very good, but when Iâm bad, Iâm better.â\n\nNudism / naturism spread throughout Europe in the 1920s and got to America in the 1930s, due in part to sociologist, political theorist, and liberal social critic Maurice Parmeleeâs 1931 book Nudism in Modern Life. Also, âthe set thatâs smartâ refers to the phrase âThe Smart Set,â meaning the cultural elite, usually fashionable and wealthy. It was also the title of a literary magazine that published from 1900-1930.\n\nThe songâs second bridge is more general than the first, more a catalog of the fallout. Here, the world is just screwed up, backwards, upside-down, disorienting...\n\nThe world has gone mad today\n\nAnd goodâs bad today,\n\nAnd blackâs white today,\n\nAnd dayâs night today,\n\nAnd that gent today\n\nYou gave a cent today\n\nOnce had several chateaus.\n\nWhen folks who still can ride in jitneys\n\nFind out Vanderbilts and Whitneys\n\nLack baby cloâes,\n\nAnything goes.\n\nNo revival has used those last four lines because no one would understand them today. Jitneys were independent taxi cabs or small buses, so the joke is that the middle-class folks who can still afford to take a cab, here in the middle of the Depression, would be shocked to find out that some of the richest Americans (in this case, the Vanderbilt and Whitney families) had lost nearly everything â due to the creation of income and estate taxes not too long before, the effects of the Depression, and the weirdly profligate spending of the Vanderbilts and others. The âbaby clothesâ might refer to Gloria Vanderbilt, who was a child at the time. The Whitneys went broke through corruption.\n\nThe third bridge of âAnything Goesâ returns to the second person â you â acknowledging everybodyâs feeling that the world has gone crazy and itâs making us all crazy. Much like right now. And notice this very early critique of the mainstream media...\n\nJust think of those shocks youâve got\n\nAnd those knocks youâve got\n\nAnd those blues youâve got\n\nFrom the news youâve got,\n\nAnd those pains youâve got\n\n(If any brains youâve got)\n\nFrom those little radios.\n\nAccording to the PBS website:\n\nFor the radio, the 1930s was a golden age. At the start of the decade 12 million American households owned a radio, and by 1939 this total had exploded to more than 28 million. But why was this âtalking telegramâ so popular? As technology improved radios became smaller and cheaper [hence the âlittleâ radios]. They became the central piece of furniture in the average familyâs living room, with parents and children alike, crowding around the set to hear the latest installment of their favorite show.\n\nNews broadcasts influenced the way the public experienced current affairs. When the Hindenburg airship exploded in 1937, reporter Herb Morrison was on the scene, recording the events to be broadcast the following day. But above all the radio provided a way to communicate like never before. Franklin Rooseveltâs âfireside chatsâ helped the population feel closer to their president than ever.\n\nThereâs yet another bridge section, with an early lyric that was written but not used in 1934, then restored for the 1987 revival:\n\nIf saying your prayârs you like,\n\nIf green pears you like,\n\nIf old chairs you like,\n\nIf backstairs you like,\n\nIf love affairs you like\n\nWith young bears you like,\n\nWhy nobody will oppose.\n\nAnd yes, âyoung bearsâ meant then what it means now; itâs a gay reference that a fair number of New York theatre-goers, âthe smart set,â probably had heard. âBackstairsâ was surely a reference to brothels or speakeasies. But what of these other lines? We know Porter loved to joke in code...\n\nIf saying your prayârs you like = Good Girls\n\nIf green pears you like = Young Girls, Virgins\n\nIf old chairs you like = Older Women\n\nIf backstairs you like = Hookers (or Servants?)\n\nIf love affairs you like\n\nWith young bears you like = Young Men\n\nWhy nobody will oppose.\n\nIn other words, Free Love. It does make a certain Porter-esque sense, both in terms of his writing and his biography. With that in mind, this sure does feel like Coleâs quirky take on âchacun Ã son goÃ»t.â And that may explain why it was cut in 1934...\n\nThis last version of the bridge was written by P.G. Wodehouse for the first London production, and itâs been used in all the revivals, because so much of the original 1934 lyric is unusable today.\n\nWhen grandmama whose age is eighty\n\nIn night clubs is getting matey\n\nWith gigolos,\n\nAnything Goes.\n\nWhen mothers pack and leave poor father\n\nBecause they decide theyâd rather\n\nBe tennis pros,\n\nAnything Goes.\n\nThatâs a fun little joke about married women running off to be lesbians, but this lyric is way too British for this show and these characters. Americans donât use the word âmateyâ because we donât use âmateâ to mean friend; and most Americans donât say, âgrandmama.â Also in America, âfatherâ and âratherâ do not rhyme. And Porter rarely inverted sentences as awkwardly as these first two lines. Still, this stanza does get at another cultural phenomenon of the 1930s.\n\nWhile the trend up to that point had been for the divorce rate to increase, that got interrupted in the early 1930s. Due to the Depression, many couples stayed together because they couldnât afford divorce. It wasnât until the unemployment rate went down that the increasing divorce rate trend continued. Unemployment was at its highest in 1933, and as the unemployment rate declined throughout the 30s, the divorce rate increased. At the same time, womenâs tennis greatly increased in popularity.\n\nThis cheat rhyme was written for the Act I finale of the 1962 revival:\n\nThey think heâs gangster number one,\n\nSo theyâve made him their favorite son,\n\nAnd that goes to show.\n\nAnything Goes!\n\nAnything, Anything, Anything Goes!\n\nBut âshowâ doesnât rhyme with âgoesâ! Another unused Porter lyric from 1934 has âAnd that plot twist shows...â which works better.\n\nMuch of the original 1934 lyric for âAnything Goesâ would just baffle todayâs audiences, with references to Mrs. Ned McLean (a socialite who was the last private owner of the Hope Diamond), Eleanor Rooseveltâs radio broadcasts sponsored by Simmons mattresses, extravagant Broadway producer Max Gordon, movie studio head Sam Goldwyn, Ukrainian movie star Anna Sten, actor and socialite Lady Mendl, and others.\n\nWhen Anything Goes first opened, the title song worked because it reinforced a feeling the audience already had â that the world is spinning madly out of control, and that sometimes that can be fun. (Or as Little Red might put it, âexcited and scared.â) As proof of the showâs thesis, the songs âAnything Goesâ and âYouâre the Topâ offer up example after example ripped from the headlines (and society pages) of 1934. Today when we see Anything Goes, all those examples suggest the craziness today, without literally referencing any of it. Crazy is crazy.\n\nIn 1934, Americans were grappling with the massive, disorienting changes our country was going through. It did feel to many American as if all the rules had been ripped up, that literally anything goes. Today we grapple with much the same thing, here in the early days of the Digital Age, at the start of huge demographic and social changes in America, when the very nature of truth is up for debate. Life today is just as crazy as it was in Reno Sweeneyâs America, maybe crazier. Today, all these references may serve only as metaphors, but still pretty potent ones.\n\nEvery element of this story is testament to this one idea, that anything goes. All the couples are wrongly coupled at first, the clergyman gets arrested and the gangster gets a cruise, the passengers deify a fake murderer, the real gangster is as nervous as a cat, the worldly-wise speakeasy hostess falls for the dorky Englishman... Everything is up for grabs. None of the rules apply. Weâre in Shakespeareâs woods. Anything goes!\n\nFlying Too High with Some Guy in the Sky\n\nThe richest song in the show is deceptive in the surface simplicity of both its music and lyrics. Renoâs emotionally naked torch song, âI Get a Kick Out of You,â is another of Anything Goesâ songs that weâve gotten too familiar with. Weâve stopped hearing these lyrics fresh.\n\nWeirdly, the song originally opened the show, revealing Renoâs secret crush on Billy. The 1962 revival moved the song to late Act I, and now itâs about Renoâs surprise at falling in love with Evelyn. Itâs so much stronger here, because these feelings are revealed to us now after weâve spent time with the charmingly smartass Reno for an hour. Thatâs much more potent structurally. When this song opens the show, it gives us a false first impression of Reno; but moved to later in the show, it reveals a deeper layer to Reno.\n\nâI Get a Kick Out of Youâ has this sinuous Latin line in the low reeds under the vocal intro, which says so much about this very sensual woman, but that line disappears after the intro, and the rest of the song was set, in 1934, to the standard Broadway foxtrot. But in â62 (our version), the main part of the song continues the Latin beat, though still without that reed line. Alongside the Latin syncopation, there are several moments of hemiola (long vocal triplets over an accompaniment in four), that make the beat momentarily ambiguous, just like Renoâs feelings.\n\nBut what exactly is Reno saying here? Sheâs literally saying that nothing in life gives her particular pleasure or happiness. She is (particularly if we assume Texas Guinanâs real life details) a professional cynic and smartass. Guinan, the model for Reno (and for Velma Kelly), greeted her speakeasy guests every night with âHello, suckers!â\n\nLook at this lyric â\n\nMy story is much too sad to be told,\n\nBut practically everything\n\nLeaves me totally cold.\n\nYep, thatâs the speakeasy hostess alright. And it really is sad. She feels nothing. This isnât the usual musical comedy leading lady. Hope seems more like our leading lady, but sheâs not; Reno is. She goes on:\n\nThe only exception I know is the case\n\nWhen Iâm out on a quiet spree,\n\nFighting vainly the old ennui,\n\nAnd I suddenly turn and see\n\nYour fabulous face.\n\nSheâs racing through life â racing around this ship â doing anything to stave off boredom (âthe old ennuiâ). Nothing thrills her. Nothing moves her. Except one thing â the face of the man she loves. Up until this time, Renoâs made a couple off-hand remarks about finding Evelyn cute, but this is Reno dropping the cynicism and honestly looking at her own emotions, maybe for the first time ever.\n\nSo why the goofball Sir Evelyn Oakleigh? He finds an undeniable joy in the adventure of life. Heâs almost childlike in his delight over learning new things. Quite likely, Evelyn is the first man Reno has ever met whoâs not a cynic. Imagine how different he is from the jaded criminals and bootleggers and chorines who no doubt make up the circle of Renoâs friends, none of them trustworthy, none of them ever emotionally open or honest â or delighted by anything.\n\nLike her underworld circle of friends, Reno has seen it all...\n\nI get no kick from champagne,\n\nMere alcohol,\n\nDoesnât thrill me at all...\n\nDonât miss the punch of those lines. Itâs one year after Prohibition is repealed, and Americaâs biggest speakeasy queen (again, if we blend Reno and Texas Guinan) is saying alcohol doesnât really do it for her. So she asks the obvious question â if literally everything leaves her cold...\n\nSo tell me, why should it be true,\n\nThat I get a kick out of you?\n\nEach verse takes an addiction (alcohol, drugs, and adrenaline) all of which do nothing for Reno.\n\nSome get a kick from cocaine,\n\nIâm sure that if\n\nI took even one sniff,\n\nIt would bore me terrif-\n\nically, too,\n\nYet I get a kick out of you.\n\nThe bridge expands on the title phrase â\n\nI get a kick every time\n\nI see\n\nYou standing there\n\nBefore me.\n\nI get a kick though itâs clear\n\nTo me,\n\nYou obviously\n\nDonât adore me.\n\nNotice the rhyme compounding, giving us a sense of momentum. We get the string of see, me, me, -ly, me, but also before me and adore me. And yet none of the grammar is awkward or strained. It still sounds like Renoâs voice.\n\nThe last verse follows the established pattern, but this time the music literally takes off with the lyric, and the multiple rhymes give us even more momentum...\n\nFly-\n\ning too high\n\nwith some guy\n\nin the sky...\n\nBut before the stanza is over, the music returns to earth, because thereâs no kick to be had there.\n\n...Is my i-\n\n-dea of nothing to do.\n\nBut I get a kick out of you.\n\nThe mood turns right in the middle of the âiâ rhymes (splitting the word âideaâ).\n\nRemember that passenger airplanes were really new at this point, and only rich folks could afford to fly â the first passenger jet, the Boeing 247, was introduced one year before Anything Goes debuted. And Lindberg had made his historic trans-Atlantic flight only seven years earlier.\n\nIs âsome guy in the skyâ a sly Porter reference to God and religion, especially since Reno is a former evangelist. We know Porter loved talking in code â just look at his bridges in the title song, cataloging fast living (âlow bars,â âfast cars,â etc.) and unconventional sexual tastes (âbackstairs,â âlove affairs with young bears,â etc.). One of the most interesting aspects of this song is how it changed when it was lifted out of context. In 1934, radio stations wouldnât play a lyric about cocaine, so Porter had to create the ever dangerous âbop type refrain.â But also, almost every pop singer rewrites the rhythm of the title phrase. Originally, Porter wrote that title phrase to a rhythm that almost no one sings correctly today. Most pop singers â and therefore, most women playing Reno, including Eileen Rodgers as Reno on the 1962 cast album â move the word âkickâ to the downbeat.\n\nThatâs not what Porter wrote. He placed the word âkickâ on beat 4, ahead of the downbeat, to give the word âkickâ a kick. Once you hear it the right way (which you will in our production), the other way sounds so wrong.\n\nPlease, Saint Peter\n\nAs yet another example of its âadult contentâ (as if âlove affairs with young bearsâ wasnât enough), Anything Goes skewers organized religion pretty aggressively throughout the show, often through very pointed satire.\n\nThe most obvious commentary on religion jump-starts the plot in the opening scene, as Bishop Dobson gets arrested in Moonfaceâs place. Why is that funny? Nobody can tell the difference between a bishop and a gangster. Welcome to 1934 America. Itâs the first of dozens of swipes taken at American institutions, but at religion even more often than the others. And like several others, itâs a swipe that stays with us all evening, because Mooney is dressed like a preacher till the very end. Throughout the show, Mooney repeatedly does immoral, illegal, and/or unethical things, and all as a clergyman. And no one notices.\n\nTwo of our three heroes, Reno and Mooney, have phony religious alter-egos. Reno is a âformer evangelistâ (i.e., con artist), now a nightclub singer whose songs have weirdly off-kilter religious imagery; Mooney is hiding from the Feds in the clothes of a minister, and soon heâs called âDr. Moonâ by everyone aboard. Mooney spends much of the first act running around the ship in full preacher drag, stealing things and brandishing his Tommy gun.\n\nReno talks in fake Biblical language periodically, showing us that she was once a religious figure, but also that they she didnât take it very seriously. She says to Mr. Whitney in the first scene, âIâve got four fallen angels holding up the bar. Come, let us lead them beside distilled waters.â When Mooney suggests blackmailing Evelyn, we get this Biblical-ish exchange:\n\nReno: Get thee behind me, Moonface. I kind of like the guy. Heâs different.\n\nMoon: But Reno, you promised Billy.\n\nReno: Thou almost persuadest me to shoot the works. You know, if you werenât a friend of Billyâs, Iâd unfrock you.\n\nIn (almost) quoting Luke 4:8, Reno jokingly equates Mooney with Satan â but also herself with Jesus. But sheâs also (almost) quoting, âThen Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian.â (Acts 26:28) This is someone with only a casual knowledge of Scripture, but enough for her purposes. And in comic counterpoint to her fake piety, the exchange ends with her threatening sex!\n\nAnd these two fake religious figures, Reno and Mooney, will lead the comic revival meeting in Act II. As the meeting climaxes, Reno once again mashes together religion with pop culture, in this case, the language of radio: âSign off with Satan and tune in with Heaven.â The language of the âBlow, Gabrielâ lyric is Religious Symbolism as a Second Language. This is an amateur, or more to the point, a religious outsider, leading this revival meeting â with the help of the fake-minister âDr. Moon.â Itâs obvious neither of them are really believers, and that doesnât seem to bother the crowd a bit. And by the way, why do we want Gabriel to blow his horn? The Bible says that âan archangel with the trumpet of Godâ will announce the Second Coming, and people have assumed thatâs Gabriel, particularly since Milton made that connection in Paradise Lost.\n\nSo are these drunk, hard-partying passengers really cheering on the Second Coming â and the Apocalypse? They are, but they have no idea thatâs what theyâre doing, because Reno and Mooney are first-rate con artists.\n\nBoth Reno and Mooney connect to other (not really) âreligiousâ characters. Reno has her âangels,â her backup singers, from whom we hear short, comic bits all evening, sometimes about their promiscuity. Do we assume they were also with her back when she was an evangelist, or are they just called angels as an ironic callback to Renoâs last gig?\n\nAnd Mooneyâs accidental sidekick Bonnie has her religious moment too, when she sings âHeaven Hop,â a comic coupling of the sacred and profane (i.e., religion and jazz). The song connects to one of the showâs two main themes, the transformation of religion into show biz and pop culture. This song is Bonnieâs own personal theology, more joyful, more now-centered, distinct from the authentic theology of the Bishop, the phony theology of Moonface, and the commercialized theology of Reno and her angels.\n\nIn Bonnieâs theology (coming from the world of Depression-era organized crime), you can be a Good Person and also have fun, drink, smoke, dance â even steal, apparently. For Bonnie, heaven is a party. After all, how could heaven be boring? Thatâs in stark opposition to the new con artists/evangelists crisscrossing America in the 1930s with an apocalyptic message of fire and brimstone (mentioned in Renoâs âGabrielâ lyric) and a coming âreawakeningâ of religious faith.\n\nBut all the traditional symbols and conventions of human religion donât serve Bonnieâs needs or hold her attention, so like Americans have always done, she forms her own personal religion, with fewer restrictions and lots more fun.\n\nNotice throughout the lyric how Bonnie blends together traditional religious symbol with her own secular ones. Just in the first few lines, Bonnie (and Cole Porter) tells us this is a different kind of heaven from what weâre used to. No laying on clouds strumming lyres in Bonnieâs heaven. This song is originally from another Porter musical, so the reference to portals in the first line is just a happy accident in this story set aboard a ship.\n\nUp in Heavenâs happy portals,\n\nWhere the parties never stop,\n\nAll the debonair immortals\n\nDo a dance called the Heaven Hop.\n\nIn that big celestial center,\n\nItâs the only dance they do;\n\nSo before you try to enter,\n\nYou better start doinâ it too!\n\nNotice the great alteration of the title phrase, obviously, but also Heavenâs happy; portals and parties; debonair and do a dance, and later, dance they do; and celestial center. Those last couple lines are subtle but potent jabs at ârevealed scripture,â the idea that only one religion has the true Secret Knowledge. Only by being In the Know can you enter Heaven. But here, that Secret Knowledge is a new dance.\n\nThen, like lots of other pop songs in the 1920s and 30s, Bonnie introduces a new dance, by giving us the choreography. The first two lines are so rich â first you move like an angel, then you move like a musical comedy star:\n\nSpread your wings and start them flappinâ,\n\nLift your feet and set them tappinâ,\n\nStart right now and do the Heaven Hop,\n\nHop, the Heaven Hop!\n\nWag your ankles to that meter,\n\nLet your shoulders gently teeter,\n\nIf you want to, please Saint Peter,\n\nTake up the Heaven Hop!\n\nThe reference to St. Peter is extra funny because heâs regarded as the first pope. You couldnât pick a more traditional religious figure than the first pope, but thatâs who Bonnie wants to dance with. And why not? Or is Bonnie just assuming that St. Peter wonât be able to stop himself?\n\nSome versions of the song have the comma before âplease Saint Peter,â and some donât. With the comma, Bonnieâs inviting St. Peter to join her; without the comma, itâs about dancing in order to âpleaseâ (i.e., make happy) St. Peter. Similar, but different ideas...\n\nThereâs a short bridge and we get a better glimpse into Bonnieâs heaven, and the most explicit example of the sacred-profane mashup. It starts with humility and reverence:\n\nWhen the angels play low\n\nOn their harps of gold,\n\nKneel and pray low,\n\nBut the sacred is immediately short-circuited in favor of the profane:\n\nThen get up and shake your halo!\n\nAgain, act like an angel (play a harp, kneel and pray), then act like a jazz baby (shake your halo). First a humble act, then a show-off act. Maybe Bonnieâs heaven is more like the Underworld of ancient myths, the place everybody goes when they die, whether âgoodâ or âbad.â\n\nLet that rhythm filter through ya\n\nTill you holler, âHallelujah!â\n\nStart right now and\n\nDo the Heaven Hop.\n\nâThat rhythmâ is show biz, jazz, but âfilter through yaâ sounds more like religion. Exactly. Just like âBlow, Gabriel, Blow.â America has a long, weird tradition of greatly altering religious traditions to fit our own needs, and this is just a comic distillation of that habit.\n\nBut is âHeaven Hopâ a song Bonnie just knows? Or is it one of Renoâs songs, and Bonnie knows all of Renoâs songs? Itâs pretty safe to assume that Bonnie and Snake Eyes would patronize Renoâs speakeasies throughout Prohibition. Is Bonnie Roxie Hart to Renoâs Velma Kelly? Reno and Velma were both based on Texas Guinan, after all...\n\nAct II opens with the mock religious hymn, âPublic Enemy Number One,â full of religious fervor, raising murderer Snake Eyes Johnson to Christ-like stature. Thatâs a pretty fierce poke at American culture â then and now. Itâs also one of dozens of moments in the show that illustrate its title â literally Anything Goes.\n\nAnd thereâs the crazy revival meeting in the middle of Act II, with broken and mismatched religious imagery swirling around, all of which devolves into nonsense. Finally, after many calls for a confession, Billy makes one and is immediately arrested. And then the same thing happens to Mooney. In this religious space, it doesnât pay to confess. In this world, religion is broken.\n\nYouâre Cellophane!\n\nIn the original Anything Goes, several of the lyrics were full of references to people and things that were popular in 1934, many of which we havenât even heard of today. So a lot of the original lyric for âYouâre the Topâ and âAnything Goesâ would just be baffling to audiences today; and instead of listening to the song, theyâd be feeling left behind and confused. Those lyrics had to be revised for the revivals.\n\nMitchell Morris writes in his article âLists of Louche Living: Music in Cole Porterâs Social World,â in the book A Cole Porter Companion:\n\nFrom early in his career, Porter loved references to historical as well as contemporary figures, usually in some brash situation that flatters his audience (we recognize the reference and we get to poke fun at it too). Porter as a lyricist loved metonymic things, particularly lists. On the one hand, these lists frame a particular kind of eroticism â they most often appear in songs of romance (however ambivalent) and employ potentially endless wit, since the list could hypothetically continue to exhaustion, in the service of courtship. But the list also serves to create an implied social world in which Coleâs immediate audience, who certainly recognize the references, are joined by a larger and more inchoate audience through magazines, recordings, and radio, joined together by their sense of inclusion. And now we return to the difficulties of Porterâs intense social embeddedness â since he depended heavily on the evanescence of the current reference, his lists can have an unusually short cultural half-life. Even when some brief excavation securely identifies a reference, it takes a great deal of time to unpack the halo of associations that are compressed around it, and that time is the death of wit. But though the wit be diminished in explication, the richness that comes from reconstructing the social network condensed into a single reference offers a different set of rewards.\n\nContrary to what a lot of directors and actors think, it is not important for the audience to get every reference; but it is important that the actors get them, so that they can live fully and honestly in this world. That sense of reality is the real value of period references. After all, we can enjoy Shakespeare and Gilbert & Sullivan without knowing all the various cultural and political references.\n\nAll that said, hereâs a glossary, for actors and directors working on Anything Goes, and for all musical theatre fangirls and fanboys who just love the show. Take a look particularly at the juxtaposition of these pop culture references against each other, in their context. Porter is doing some really subtle, sophisticated social commentary in many of these lyrics.\n\nFrom the original 1934 script:\n\nâManhattanâ â a cocktail made with whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters.

Louis B. Mayer hemmed and hawed, so Garbo sailed to Sweden. Eventually Mayer gave in and Garbo sailed back. $5,000 per week comes to $260,000 per year, or the equivalent in todayâs dollars of $4.6 million per year.â\n\nâcellophaneâ â according to Wikipedia, âWhitmanâs candy company initiated use of cellophane for candy wrapping in the United States in 1912 for their Whitmanâs Sampler. They remained the largest user of imported cellophane from France until nearly 1924, when DuPont built the first cellophane manufacturing plant in the US. Cellophane saw limited sales in the US at first since while it was waterproof, it was not moisture proofâit held water but was permeable to water vapor. This meant that it was unsuited to packaging products that required moisture proofing. DuPont hired chemist William Hale Church, who spent three years developing a nitrocellulose lacquer that, when applied to Cellophane, made it moisture proof. Following the introduction of moisture-proof Cellophane in 1927, the materialâs sales tripled between 1928 and 1930.â Our story is set in 1934.\n\nâDerby winnerâ â the 1934 running of the Kentucky Derby was its 60th!\n\nâYouâre a Brewster bodyâ â the frame for a Bentley or Rolls Royce luxury car\n\nâA Ritz hot toddyâ â a specialty drink of the Ritz Hotel bar in Paris\n\nâthe sleepy Zuder Zeeâ â The Zuiderzee was a shallow bay of the North Sea in the northwest of the Netherlands.
