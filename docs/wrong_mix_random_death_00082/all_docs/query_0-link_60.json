        "text": "Bernard Whimpress has written and edited 48 books, mainly on sport. A former curator of the Adelaide Oval Museum, he published and edited the cricket history journal Baggy Green from 1998 to 2010. Bernard holds a doctorate in history from Flinders University and in 2017 was awarded a South Australian Life-Long Achievement Award.\n\nA BEER WITH BERNARD WHIMPRESS\n\nHow did you become interested in writing?\n\nI wrote a Matric English essay on the subject of ‘Success’ on which my teacher commented ‘Written in a style I can only admire’. That was a confidence boost and after dropping out of teachers college and university, and spending a few years as a public servant I entered journalism by a side door.\n\nWhy do you write?\n\nBecause I want to express myself and it is my medium.\n\nWhere do you write and how often do you write?\n\nMainly in my study and most days. The form varies – books, articles, historical journalism, reviews, satire, a poem now and again.\n\nWhich writers do you like?\n\nSteven Carroll, particularly his Glenroy series is my favourite. Among literary writers these have changed over the years – DH Lawrence, Hemingway, Kerouac, Orwell, Gerald Murnane, Graham Swift, Lionel Shriver and Elizabeth Strout. In crime Philip Kerr, Adrian McKinty, Peter Corris and Garry Disher. In non-fiction Don Watson and Bob Ellis. In sport Gideon Haigh, John Harms, Martin Flanagan, Duncan Hamilton and Eric Midwinter.\n\nWhy do you write about sport?\n\nIt’s a subject I know and care about. After travelling overseas in 1973-74 I thought I might become the new Kerouac but struggled because I had nothing to say.\n\nWhat is the writing process for you?\n\nIt depends on the form. In an essay a great last line sometimes springs to mind, and I plot my way towards it. In various books I begin with the reason for writing it and in a work of history it’s then doing archival research, maybe interviews and pulling the elements together. Structuring and editing give me a lot of pleasure. I once heard a writer say that she hated editing her own books. My reaction was that she wasn’t a writer at all.\n\nWhen did you first get published?\n\nI had a poem published in a small magazine about 1970 but the first real publishing began in 1975 when Ashley Hornsey and I launched Football Times.\n\nYou have a doctorate. What was the subject you explored?\n\n‘Aborigines in Australian Cricket in the Protection Era (1850-1939)’. It was half cricket history and half to do with Aboriginal policy in the various colonies and states. The thesis examined pastoral cricket, the game on Aboriginal missions and reserves and collective biographies of a handful of figures who had played first-class cricket. The PhD was awarded in 1999 and the book Passport to Nowhere was published a few months later.\n\nWhat are you working on now?\n\nI’m pulling together 90 interviews I conducted with former SANFL footballers in the early 1980s. Highlights are those beginning with Magarey Medallists Dan Moriarty, ‘Wacka’ Scott and others from the 1920s. I’m also editing a book on political history of the 1890s.\n\nWhat is the theme of your writing?\n\nThis is a big question because it depends on the subject. For instance, in my cricket books I have written several biographies, histories of clubs, Australian cricket, grounds, events, and issues such as throwing and selection. In football I began with a history of South Australian league football, have done a couple of club histories and written long essays on the social history of the game, and its origins and development outside Victoria. Other books include such subjects as city heritage, memoir, Australian art, photography and poetry.\n\nWhat is the backdrop to your writing?\n\nSilence. I only play music to drown out the barking of a neighbour’s dog.\n\nWhat is your view on publishing in Australia?\n\nIt’s difficult. I’ve published nearly 50 books but it’s seven years since I did so with a main commercial publisher. I began what I term niche publishing (mainly limited edition books and booklets) thirty years ago and this remains a major area of interest and pleasure. When I published the cricket history journal, Baggy Green (1998-2010) I had around 200 subscribers and that just covered costs. Only three of my books have been commercial successes – one going through five editions – while other commissioned works did reasonably well. The book I’m most disappointed didn’t attract commercial interest was On Our Selection (2011). It’s screaming out for an update so maybe I’ll be luckier second time around.\n\nWhat has been your experience of writers’ festivals in Australia?\n\nThey have not been valuable to me. I’ve never received a gig as a writer at Adelaide Writers’ Week although I did chair a successful session involving Gideon Haigh, John Harms and William McInnes (who’d just written a cricket novel) in 2008. I was delighted to attend the splendid little Dunkeld Writers’ Festival last year where I shared a panel session with Gideon Haigh and Marion Stell, and conducted a cricket quiz.\n\nWhat could be done to support writers in Australia?\n\nBuy their books.\n\nYou’ve mentored several writers. Do you gain pleasure from that?\n\nYes. I suppose I’ve reached the stage in life of becoming a greying eminence. While I hope there are still a few projects I’d like to complete I also like to help younger writers achieve their potential and find an audience.\n\nIf you had your life over again, what career would you choose?\n\nDancer. Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly are the ideal models..\n\nProfile\n\nNickname: Mobile (short for Mobile Ruckman)\n\nAcquired only a few years ago because of my enthusiasm for this type of footballer – Rick Davies, Adam Goodes – and not my own football career which ended at age twelve when I took up golf.\n\nSocial media: Facebook, X\n\nFavourite food: Spinach ravioli\n\nFavourite drinks: Shiraz, Coopers Pale Ale\n\nFavourite band: Liked Blondie about 40 years ago.\n\nBest pub: Exeter\n\nLast book read: Andrew Faulkner, Guts Glory and Blunder: Noreuil, 1917\n\nOne word to describe your life at the moment: Fulfilled\n\nWhat is your Desert Island book?: Wisden\n\nRead Bernard’s Almanac pieces Here\n\nBarry Nicholls is a former A-grade district cricketer (for Kensington in Adelaide) who has written about the sport for three decades. He’s also been a broadcaster on ABC Radio for nearly 20 years. Barry has written nine books, including You Only Get One Innings: Family, Mates and the Wisdom of Cricket and For Those Who Wait: The Barry Jarman Story and The Pocket History of the Ashes. He has contributed to Inside Sport, Wisden Cricketers’ Almanac Australia and other publications.\n\nRead more from Barry Nicholls Here.\n\nTo return to the www.footyalmanac.com.au home page click HERE\n\nOur writers are independent contributors.
