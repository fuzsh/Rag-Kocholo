        "text": "Well, \"Lonely Town\" isn't non-rhyming, although there is no consistent\n\nrhyme scheme and parts of the lyric don't rhyme. But others parts do\n\n(\"When you pass through/And there is no one waiting there for\n\nyou\"-\"Unless there's love/A love that's shining like a harbor light/\n\nYou're lost in the night\").\n\nAnd other people have covered the song, not that many, but a few\n\n(apart from the various cast recordings). Sinatra may have been the\n\nfirst, but he's no longer the only one.\n\nAnd if you count Mary Martin's recording (which you may not, since it\n\nwas part of the Decca semi-cast recording), then he wasn't the first.\n\nAlan\n\nOn Jul 2, 1:18 pm, \"William Sommerwerck\" <grizzledgee...@comcast.net>\n\nwrote:\n\n> > IN RMCR if you do not spew accepted myths or someone\n\n> > else's opinion you get into trouble.\n\n>\n\n> My favorite Sinatra album is \"Where Are You?\". It includes the Bernstein /\n\n> Comden-Green \"Lonely Town\" (from \"On the Town\"). This song (one the few\n\n> members of a very small genre -- the non-rhyming through-composed pop lied)\n\n> has never been covered by any other singer. It shows Lenny at his facile\n\n> best, and is impossible to imagine being sung effectively by a \"trained\"\n\n> singer.\n\n>\n\n> You probably don't like Ella, either.\n\nWell, \"Lonely Town\" does have an unconventional structure for a\n\npopular song, even one from a Broadway musical. (Though the '40s were\n\narguably the most experimental decade in the history of the Broadway\n\nmusical.) But though I'm not a musician, I wouldn't quite say that it\n\nwas through-composed. For one thing it does repeat the A section. I\n\ndon't have the score here (and I don't have the greatest ear in the\n\nworld), but I think it's a verbatim musical repeat. And even the\n\nverse, though it's uncommonly long and complex, does repeat material.\n\nAnd the main body of the song (I don't think that refrain would be\n\nquite the right word in this case) does have a very clear rhyme\n\nscheme. Unconventional but clear.\n\nLooking at the lyrics in the published script of On the Town, we have\n\n14 lines of text in the main part of the song, and within those 14\n\nlines are four rhyming pairs. And they are masculine rhymes, clearly\n\nintended as rhymes. Not a huge amount of rhyme, but definitely rhymes.\n\nAnd the rhyme scheme even emphasizes that the melody repeats, by\n\nhaving the last word in the first line of each A section rhyme.\n\nWhat is really unusual is that the verse, which is quite long (also 14\n\nlines of text), has no rhymes. And it certainly has a recitative-like\n\nfeel, even though it does basically fall into two A sections, with the\n\nsecond having variations on the first, but they are clearly the same\n\nbasic melody.\n\nBut it is quite complex by popular music standards because the first\n\nthree lines don't repeat in the first section don't repeat. They have\n\nno counterpart in the second A section. And then at the end of the\n\nsecond A section of the verse, there's a little coda (codetta?). But\n\notherwise, we have two A sections in there; they're not absolutely\n\nidentical, but they are close enough.\n\nI wonder how many bars are in each section. I suppose I could try to\n\nfigure it out, but I don't have time and I might get it wrong. If I\n\nremember (and I probably won't), I'll try to take a look at the score\n\nthe next time I'm at the library.\n\nI'm guessing that \"My Time of Day\" was cut from the movie of Guys and\n\nDolls less because of Brando's vocal limitations (real though they\n\nwere), but because it was deemed too complex and weird and because it\n\noriginally was a lead-in to \"I've Never Been in Love Before,\" sadly\n\nnot used in the film but replaced by the inferior \"A Woman in Love.\"\n\nIt may be that the original song was cut because while Brando and\n\nSimmons might have just about been able to negotiate the notes (even\n\nif not with somewhat approximate intonation), neither would have\n\nsounded too good.\n\nEven in the show, Sky has a relatively limited vocal range, going up\n\n(I believe) only to a D.\n\nThere were a lot of people with whom Loesser didn't get along. I don't\n\nknow how many Broadway composers were known to have slapped a leading\n\nlady during a rehearsal. And not because she was being difficult, but\n\nbecause he didn't like the way she was singing his song.\n\nAlan\n\nOn Jul 2, 8:14 pm, \"William Sommerwerck\" <grizzledgee...@comcast.net>\n\nwrote:\n\n\n\nShe's very good in Kitty Foyle, and as far as I'm concerned she steals\n\nStage Door (a wonderful film) from the rest of that amazing cast.\n\nUnfortunately, apart from the films she did with Astaire (and the two\n\nmentioned above and a handful of others), it seems that she wasn't in\n\nthat many first-rate films, though I can't say definitively because I\n\nhaven't seen that many of them. But within her range, she was\n\nterrific. She seems to have been best playing working-class women,\n\nthough she desperately wanted to play Elizabeth I, basically a\n\nsupporting role, in John Ford's Mary of Scotland, with Hepburn as\n\nMary.\n\nActually, she's terrific in Roxie Hart, based on the play Chicago,\n\nwhich was the source of the musical Chicago. And she's terrific in her\n\nsupporting roles in 42nd Street and Gold Diggers of 1933 (two movies I\n\ncan live without). She really was a huge star in her day even on her\n\nown, though some of those movies are forgotten now. For instance, the\n\nfilm version of Lady in the Dark was a big hit, even though it is now\n\nviewed (by the few who know it) as a pretty total botch.\n\nAfter the Barkleys of Broadway, she started doing stage again, where\n\nshe was only moderately successful. She never had much of a singing\n\nvoice. One thing that's forgotten is that she was the star on Broadway\n\nof the Gershwins' musical Girl Crazy, shortly before she went to\n\nHollywood, but of course that was the show that made Merman a star.\n\nVocally, she was no competition for Merman, who stole the show in her\n\nsupporting role. Rogers would not have been given the chance to sing I\n\nGot Rhythm.\n\nHer last Broadway credit was as a replacement in Hello, Dolly! (Merman\n\nwas also a replacement Dolly, after having turned down the chance to\n\ncreate the role because she didn't want to commit to a long run at\n\nthat point in her career. And one of Rogers's last movies was the\n\nfinal big RKO disaster, The First Travelling Salesday, in which her co-\n\nstar was Carol Channing.)\n\nRogers played Dolly for a year and a half on Broadway, though her\n\nunderstudy went on a lot. She did a lot of musicals and a few plays in\n\nsummer stock. She never made the transition to character actress in\n\nthe movies. Her movie career was over when she was in her mid-40s.\n\nWould she have become a star on her own? I don't know. But she was\n\nvery good within her range.\n\nAlan\n\nOn Jul 3, 8:54 am, JohnGavin <dagd...@comcast.net> wrote:\n\n> This brings up an interesting question: Where would Ginger Rogers\n\n> have been without Fred Astaire?

Thompson had quite a pedigree and\n\nshe was not afraid to show it (in the film she plays a wasp - ish fashion\n\nmagazine editor, her character's persona was not too far removed from her\n\nreal - life one). That's the only incidence I've ever heard of Astaire\n\nbeing \"jealous\" of a partner...\n\n--\n\nBest\n\nGreg\n\n> This clip from the Astaire-Rogers film \"Roberta\" opens with\n\n> Fred Astaire playing the piano. It's not fake -- it's real!\n\n> I wonder if there was anything Fred Astaire couldn't do well!!\n\nStrictly speaking, sing. He didn't have a very good \"voice\". But song\n\nwriters generally liked the way he delivered their songs.\n\nBear in mind that Mr. Austerlitz lived during a time when it was much more\n\ncommon for children to take music lessons. And as a vaudeville performer, it\n\nwould have been foolish for him not to know how to play the piano or violin.\n\nAs I mentioned in my comments on \"Song of Love\", all the actors playing the\n\nprincipal characters -- Bob & Clara & Johannes & Franz -- are shown actually\n\nplaying the piano.\n\nOne of the greatest mistakes I ever made was not learning an instrument. My\n\nmother could play -- a little -- and said she wanted a piano, but would get\n\none only if I'd take lessons and stick with them. I said I wouldn't, so she\n\ndidn't."
