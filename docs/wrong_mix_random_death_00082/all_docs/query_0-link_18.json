        "text": "By Scott Ross\n\nNote to my new “followers” in the Mossad and SBU who are unusually interested in a more or less harmless blog about old movies, presumably scheduling their visits here in between making threats to reporters, commentators, college students and international criminal courts: There is nothing in the installment below concerning either American-funded Banderite Nazis or Zionist psychotics, so you needn’t bother visiting this month… but thank you as always for your splendid interest.\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for longer reviews &cet.\n\nThe Bohemian Girl (1936) For those of us who love Laurel and Hardy, the largest stumbling block to full enjoyment of their feature-length movies is pace. I don’t mean the comedians themselves. We accept that Stan and Ollie’s brand of humor, the way their characters react to each other, operates on a plane vastly different from most screen comics, particularly in their sound work; next to Laurel and Hardy and W.C. Fields, the Marx Brothers look like a band of delinquents hopped up on speed. With their feature-length pictures, it’s that everything else around L & H is enervated which detracts from the full appreciation of their genius.\n\nI’m not sure where the blame for this lies, although I strongly suspect it originates with their producer. Those of us who grew up watching the old Our Gang shorts (renamed “The Little Rascals” for television) recognize the long takes and reaction shots, the dead spaces that drag on unto infinity, or until the last moron in the house has gotten the joke, not to mention the stock LeRoy Shields and Marvin Hatley tunes playing endlessly and without the slightest recourse to syncopation with the action or dialogue. One can accept that this sort of filler was perhaps necessary (or deemed necessary, anyway) in the very early talkies, but by 1936 it reeked of laziness, and even incompetence. These seem to me the very hallmarks of the Hal Roach house-style, as is the repeated featuring of Roach’s biggest stars in numbingly outmoded 19th and very early 20th century operettas: The Rogue Song (1930; no complete prints of which exist), Fra Diavolo (1933), Babes in Toyland (1934) and this, the weakest of these titles still extant. It isn’t, this time out, merely the leaden pace that sinks the movie, or the terrible songs, but the constant tampering with the material and the death (a possible murder) during production of Thelma Todd, briefly seen lip-syncing to a typically maudlin ballad. Mae Busch is on hand, and that’s to the good, as is James Finlayson’s presence as an overzealous palace guard and charming little Darla Hood’s, then in her first year with “Our Gang,” as the landed child Busch kidnaps and leaves with Ollie, her cuckolded husband.\n\nVery little else works in The Bohemian Girl, and even Stan and Ollie’s routines fail to raise more than the occasional smile. (I laughed out loud exactly once, but the prospect of running the picture a second time, even in fast-forward, to see what elicited that response would tax a well man, and I’d been under the weather for a week.) Worse, the ending involves one of those grotesque sight-gags so beloved by Stan which would be horrible enough glimpsed quickly or obliquely but which is extended in case that prototypical moron I cited above didn’t catch the meaning at first glance. Laurel often had to be talked out of these things by others, and the frequent recurrence of cruelty toward these two characters in their pictures is baffling. It’s one thing when gruesome things happen to the Three Stooges; they’re live-action cartoon characters anyway, so the pain and discomfort (and even, at an extreme, the deaths) they experience don’t hurt. But didn’t Stan understand by 1936 that he and Ollie were, however silly their actions might be, real, and beloved? You don’t want to see the heads of gentle, cherished comedians mounted on a hunter’s wall just for the sake of a laugh. That’s a gag Laurel was dissuaded from including in one of the team’s two-reelers, but the one here is nearly as horrid.\n\nEarthquake (1974) Pauline Kael generously observed of this by-the-numbers ’70s disaster movie that it was “swill, but not cheap.” She was wrong. It’s both swill and cheap. Universal had watched while Irwin Allen raked in millions on The Poseidon Adventure (1972) and was determined to beat him at his own game. An increasingly ludicrous series of Airport sequels was in the works and this utter lox of a movie, calculated to rival Allen’s The Towering Inferno in the Christmas box-office sweepstakes, played very successfully on the national mood. Perhaps, had Mario Puzo been able to work longer on the screenplay he originated for it (he was contractually obligated to The Godfather Part II and had to leave the project before it was completed) Earthquake might have been less pointless and absurd, but I doubt it. (The other credited screenwriter, George Fox, was a magazine writer who had never written a play or movie.) I don’t know why Kael was so forgiving about them but what’s shocking to me, at a 50-year remove, is seeing now just how shoddy the special effects were. Aside from his usual painterly matte shots, Albert Whitlock’s “visual effects” could scarcely have passed muster on an ABC Movie of the Week of that era: Big obvious blocks of Styrofoam fall on screaming victims in the streets, the violent deaths of people in a high-rise elevator is represented by a sudden splash of animated blood across the field of vision and as the buildings burst open and fall apart you’re aware of precisely how calculated, and essentially phony, every move is along the way.\n\nEven the cast, compared to Poseidon and Inferno, feels second-rate, as if they’ve wandered in from the Universal TV movie they were shooting on an adjacent lot. Aside from Charlton Heston and Geneviève Bujold, who provide the only conviction the picture can work up as hapless lovers, Ava Gardner alternately rages and swoons as Heston’s appallingly needy, termagant wife; the one-time child evangelist Marjoe Gortner snarls at everyone as a ticking-bomb psycho who is either a) a closet-case, b) a mass-killer, c) a would-be heterosexual rapist, or all three at once; George Kennedy as an LAPD cop has either to rage at the human condition or perform acts of saintliness; Richard Roundtree and Gabriel Dell storm around in desperate search of characters to play; Victoria Principal is asked to thrust out her alleged 36-inch bust and pretend to be flattered as a bunch of men drool over her; Lloyd Nolan as a doctor corralled to aid the injured of downtown L.A. barks out orders and seems roughly as compassionate toward his charges as the Orkin man would be to a nest of cockroaches; while Lorne Greene and Barry Sullivan exude, respectively, kindness and concern as… no, it’s too boring even to tell you. One of the few “A”-list stars, Walter Matthau, has an entirely unfunny extended cameo as a bewildered bar drunk wearing what looks like one of Bella Abzug’s cast-off hats.\n\nJohn Williams, whose previous assignment was composing the superb score for The Towering Inferno, came to Earthquake utterly spent creatively: His music is so dispirited it depends on wholesale lifts from Inferno and contains nothing like that score’s breathtaking highs. The gifted Philip H. Lathrop could apparently do little for the look of the picture but its direction, by that hack Mark Robson, has even less flavor and flair than a typical episode of “Columbo.” Not that any of this mattered: Made on a budget of $6,675,125, the picture pulled in $167.4 million at the box-office, representing something like $154 million profit on the initial investment. Everyone must have been happy, except the stars, and the unfortunate ticket-buyers who sat through this abortion.*\n\nBlue Sky (1991/1994) Usually when a movie sits on the shelf as long as this one (four years) it’s either because it’s a mess, or the financing studio has no confidence in the picture and doesn’t know what to do with it, or even whether to bother releasing it at all, but although Blue Sky went unreleased due to the collapse of Orion, it’s also a mess. The original screenwriter, Rama Laurie Stagner, based the characters and situation on her family and the movie has the weirdly bifurcated feel of clear-eyed reminiscence grafted onto sheer wish-fulfillment. (The credited re-writers were Arlene Sarner and Jerry Leichtling.) Blue Sky works best when it concentrates on the marriage between Carly and Hank Marshall (Jessica Lange and Tommy Lee Jones), their relationships with their teenage daughters (Amy Locane and Anna Klemp) and the way Carly’s overpowering sexuality causes seemingly endless problems for the four. It is much less successful when it turns around and tries desperately to turn Carly into a heroine fearlessly taking on all comers in an effort to clear Hank’s name when he is unceremoniously dumped in a psych ward and kept insensible on forced psychotropic medication. A military scientist in the early 1960s whose field is monitoring radiation at nuclear testing ranges, Hank is outraged when a test is not called off despite a pair of civilians wandering into the field. His insubordination is the excuse for locking him up but what really rankles his married C.O. (Powers Booth) is his own abortive affair with Carly. The narrative’s mix of personal and political is not integrated — it’s schizophrenic, as if two different sorts of movies had been squeezed together so that the result is neither the fish of personalized drama nor the fowl of social activism. Additionally, and despite its often effective adult content, Blue Sky most resembles an idealization of a “good” parent (Hank) and the excoriation of a “bad” one (Carly). Worse, while the Marshalls, young and old, are depicted with precision, nearly everyone else comes off as a type, bloodless and not living so much as fulfilling basic dramatic requirements, the sort a first-time writer with an axe to grind is prone to. The schematism affects and detracts from everything, including the splendid performances by Lange and Jones, the good one by Locane and the direction by Tony Richardson, whose last picture this was. (He died, of, as they say, “AIDS-related complications,” in 1991, long before the movie was released.) Booth, like his character, is so unpleasant it’s nearly impossible to credit Carly’s attraction to him, and poor Carrie Snodgress, as his long-suffering wife, instead of a character is given attitudes to play, all of them eminently predictable. The icing on the cake is the typically awful score by Jack Nitzsche, complete with his usual hokey riffs on glass harmonica. Nitzsche, a fine arranger of other people’s music, was an object lesson in elevating to composter status someone whose bag of tricks was of extremely limited interest.\n\nOn a note of bizarre coincidence, Nitzsche once beat Snodgress with a handgun, threatening to kill her and, in quintessential Hollywood fashion that would never apply to you or me, got off with three years’ probation.\n\nLet’s Dance (1950) Topic for a master’s thesis in film history: “Why Betty Hutton?” Aside from Preston Sturges’ subversive comedy The Miracle of Morgan’s Creek (and she can be a trial there as well) I find that even minimal exposure to her extreme mugging and overblown vocalization causes the muscles in my jaw to tighten automatically… that is, when it doesn’t make my eyes glaze over entirely. Although she can be relatively inoffensive dramatically her basic persona, brash when not shrill, is repellant, like a distaff Jerry Lewis. My aversion to Hutton has kept me, despite my near-reverence for Fred Astaire, from seeing Let’s Dance but a new Blu-ray edition from Kino Lorber effectively cancelled my long-standing eschewal. Having finally seen it I dislike Betty Hutton as much as I ever have, but I found Let’s Dance itself surprisingly painless, if entirely inconsequential and, two good routines by him notwithstanding, a title that in no way burnishes Astaire’s filmography. He made worse musicals before this one — You’ll Never Get Rich, Blue Skies and Second Chorus are genuinely bad and only one of them has an Astaire dance worthy of his time and ingenuity — but never, I don’t think, was he paired with a female co-star with whom he had less sympathy. Although he spoke highly of Hutton (amazingly, to me, he was much more discomfited by Kay Thompson, with whom he had one of his best duets, in Funny Face) and her adeptness as a dancer is comparable to that of Judy Garland, there is not a trace of chemistry between the pair and in only one number (the comic “Oh, Them Dudes,” which she plays in cowboy drag) do they express, briefly and joyously, a sense of teamwork or real pleasure in each other’s company.\n\nThe plot, which seems rather obviously inspired by the 1930s custody battle between her mother and aunt over the child Gloria Vanderbilt, is complicated for a screen musical, and turns on a dime at the end when the condescending aunt by marriage suddenly and inexplicably relents. (That the old Boston dragon is played by the likeable Lucile Watson at least mitigates some of her character’s appalling snobbery, and she gets a brief, charming waltz with Astaire to an old-fashioned tune.) For a picture called Let’s Dance, there is very little dancing, and Fred’s best number is the “Piano Dance,” with lively music by Tommy Chambers, Van Cleave and Astaire himself, during which he performs over, under and all around an upright and a baby grand, the latter of which, when the music segues to “Hold That Tiger,” explodes with cats.\n\nAllan Scott, Astaire’s frequent RKO scenarist, wrote the often witty screenplay, with, as they used to say, additional dialogue by Dane Lussier and the pleasing songs are by Frank Loesser, fresh off the shockingly successful Guys and Dolls on Broadway. The period Technicolor is rather more subdued than usual, although Let’s Dance indulges in the hoariest of movie-musical clichés: The theatre (or in this case, nightclub) with the impossibly large performing space on which unfold activities never seen this side of a Hollywood soundstage. Norman Z. McLeod, who in palmier days directed the peerless It’s a Gift for W.C. Fields and for the Marx Brothers, Monkey Business and what I consider the team’s funniest picture, Horsefeathers, keeps the nonsense moving at a crisp pace and the good supporting cast includes Roland Young and Melville Cooper as Watson’s attorneys, Ruth Warrick as her sympathetic daughter, George Zucco as a judge and little Gregory Moffett as the widowed Hutton’s little boy, around whom the legal machinations whirl. Moffett gives a lovely performance, entirely free of guile, at least until the final moments when he’s made to look silly.\n\nThe Unsinkable Molly Brown (1964) If you accept that it bears, aside from her experience as a survivor of the Titanic and the fact she was married to the wealthy miner J.J. “Johnny” Brown, virtually no relation to the facts of Margaret Tobin Brown’s biography, the picture represents one of the few 1960s Hollywood musicals that is engaging and not just big. Tammy Grimes, who originated the role on Broadway — and was, absurdly, given a Tony as Featured Actress for her starring performance† — had no chance of reprising her role on film, and Molly Brown was planned for Shirley MacLaine, until Hal Wallis put the kibosh on that by claiming she was still under contract to him. The director, Charles Walters, didn’t want her but Debbie Reynolds got the role, for which she had campaigned strenuously, and was subsequently nominated for an Academy Award. (She lost, to Julie Andrews, for what Reynold’s daughter Carrie Fisher wittily called Andrews’ “stunning, multi-layered and moving portrayal of Mary Poppins. Ibsen’s Mary Poppins.”) MacLaine would almost certainly have given a better dramatic (and dancing) performance but her singing voice, good in its way if belty, lacked the warmth, variety and emotional vulnerability of Reynolds’. In any case, the star is well-matched by Harve Presnell’s likeable performance (and his classical baritone) as Johnny and the Meredith Willson score, although its songstack was eviscerated in the transfer from the stage is, even in abbreviated form, beautifully conceived and idiosyncratically realized, the way his The Music Man was. (He composed Johnny Brown’s arias with Presnell’s voice in mind, and it shows.) Only five of the Broadway songs made it to the movie, with an additional three (“Beautiful People of Denver,” “Dolce Far Niente” and “Up Where the People Are”) heard as underscore and a sixth vocal number (“He’s My Friend”) added by Willson to the soundtrack.\n\nHelen Deutsch’s screenplay, based on the Broadway book by Richard Morris, occasionally indulges in bathos, and a little inconsistency, as when Molly encounters her Denver, Colorado nemesis Mrs. McGraw (Audrey Christie) in Europe just before securing a berth on the Titanic, yet McGraw is somehow in Denver to greet her at the finale, or when Johnny is introduced with the exuberant “Colorado, My Home” before we have any idea who he is. Interestingly, the number that provides the greatest audience pleasure, as the kind of elaborate song-and-dance set-piece that can work so well on stage but which seldom replicates that performance excitement on the screen, is the one Willson wrote for the movie. MGM, however, was siphoning so much money to Doctor Zhivago that “He’s My Friend” nearly went un-filmed until the cast agreed to shoot it in a single day, with three cameras. When it’s not being limited by matte shots and indifferent rear-projection (and, during the sinking of the Titanic, black-and-white clips from two pervious movies) Daniel L. Fapp’s cinematography is frequently luscious, Peter Gennaro’s choreography is lively and inventive and Morton Haack’s fulsome costumes include a rich, red ballgown for Reynolds that nearly rivals the one Walter Plunkett designed for Vivien Leigh in Gone with the Wind. The unusually fulsome supporting cast includes Ed Begley as Molly’s adoptive father, Hermione Baddeley as his inamorata with the wonderful name Buttercup Grogan, Hayden Rorke as a prissy society columnist, and George Mitchell in a pleasant performance as a monsignor. Grover Dale and Gus Trikonis as Molly’s old friends dance energetically, and the wonderful Martita Hunt provides one of her beguiling extended cameos as a grand duchess who befriends the Browns. As a bittersweet reminder of what befalls yesterday’s darlings, the gifted silent comedienne Minta Durfee appears briefly in a party scene.\n\nLook, by the way, for a photo of the real Molly Brown and you’ll realize instantly just how apt the casting of Kathy Bates was in Titanic.\n\nThe Incredible Journey (1963) Sheila Burnford’s 1961 novel about three pets making an impossible homeward trek across the Canadian wilderness is one of the loveliest of all fictions about animals, and while the Walt Disney adaptation loses a great deal of what makes it special, its essentials remain. James Algar’s screenplay attempts to compensate for the elimination of authorial voice with narration spoken by Rex Allen and while it is only partly successful, Burnford’s empathetic prose, her keen appreciation of the human/animal bond, and of the ways of cats and dogs, remains, in posse if not in esse; the entire project is lit with the special grace that attends movies made with loving kindness, particularly movies about animals. The trio at the center of the story (the young golden retriever Luath, the Siamese cat Tao and the elderly English pit bull terrier Bodger) are devoted to each other, especially Tao and Bodger, and that unusual affection suffuses the movie and gives it its unemphatic emotional power. Humans make their requisite appearances throughout the story, but they do so unobtrusively for the most part, at least until the satisfying finale, where the love of a boy for his lifelong pet gives the conclusion a depth of feeling that has exactly the right resonance.\n\nBanjo the Woodpile Cat (1979) This animated short (27 minutes) directed by Don Bluth and executed by his fellow Disney animators Gary Goldman and John Pomeroy as a personal protest against recent trends at the studio is, like most of Bluth’s later pictures, attractive to the eye, annoying to the ear and insulting to the brain. (Of those I’ve seen, only his feature debut, the vivid Robert C. O’Brien adaptation The Secret of NIMH, was wholly satisfying, perhaps because unlike Bluth’s many originals, it was based on a solid, well-plotted literary source.) The story is by Bluth and his gifted brother Toby, and to a weird degree reflects their Mormon background: Early on a nasty old feedtruck driver headed for the Big Town cackles to an equally unsavory friend about the “good times” he’s going to have in… Salt Lake City, that well-known Utahan hell of fleshpots and loose women. Bluth also wrote the numbingly bad title song, which he pushes relentlessly throughout the action, and the designs of his cat characters voiced by the black actors Scatman Crothers and Beau Richards have, in contrast to all the other felines in the picture, fat, underslung lower lips. And they call Dumbo racist!\n\n13 Washington Square (1928) Hitherto unknown to me, this comic thriller from the year that saw the end of silent pictures has been beautifully restored by Kino Lorber in gorgeous sepia tone and proves, if nothing else, that ZaSu Pitts was as funny a silent comedian as she was a sound comic. The story, adapted by Harry O. Hoyt and Walter Anthony from a novel and play by Leroy Scott, is purest late-Victorian gossamer: A wealthy widow (Alice Joyce) desperate to stop her young son (George J. Lewis) from marrying the daughter of a >>gasp!<< shopkeeper(!) becomes, inadvertently, involved with a thief (Jean Hersholt) posing as a Deacon who, unknown to her and her dizzy maid (Pitts) has plans to steal her art masterworks. (Got it?) Meanwhile… but you’re way ahead of me, or should be. 13 Washington Square is unusually complicated for a silent comedy, and more dependent on intertitles than any silent picture I can recall, suggesting that it probably should have been a talkie. Yet that would have robbed it of the pictorial beauty of John Stumar’s cinematography, half the reason for watching it. The other half is Pitts’ hilarious performance as the wide-eyed, malaprop-prone housemaid, whose solecisms would have made Archie Bunker proud… although a reliance on word-play in a silent movie says something about the material.\n\nAlice Joyce may remind you, as she did me, of a shorter-haired Gillian Anderson, whom she strongly resembles, particularly in three-quarter profile.\n\nThe Greatest Show on Earth (1952) A typically overblown, fatuous and hilariously melodramatic piece of self-regard by Cecil B. DeMille that, as usual with that shameless purveyor of spectacle, also provides a hefty dose of genuine excitement. This is mainly confined to the aerial sequences with Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton perpetually attempting to outdo each other on trapeze and high-wire and which are so successful they ultimately gave this acrophobe a tension headache. I mean that as a compliment. The picture is, essentially, a two-and-a-half hour, intermissionless advertisement for the Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, with a glowering Charlton Heston as the general manager trying to keep the show rolling amid professional rivalries, competing libidos and perennially simmering catfights. This is not to mention the presence in the center ring of a fugitive mercy-killer (James Stewart) disguised as a clown, a psychopathic elephant trainer (is there any other kind?), a thief in the employ of a big-time gangster and, for extra thrills, a climactic train-wreck that permits Hutton to prove her love to Heston. All popular movies are of course products of their time, and The Greatest Show on Earth depicts the 20th century love for trained-animal acts whose gradual phasing out has seemed to me for once a wholly admirable outcome of social agitation. Even as a child taken to his first and only circus I was uneasy about elephants, those most community-minded and sensitive of large land mammals, being made to dance around the ring, balance on balls and form pyramids for my entertainment; had I known with what sadistic cruelty these animals were trained, I suspect I would have been inclined to set a match to the sawdust. (I used secretly to wish the lions and tigers would gang up on and eviscerate their whip-wielding trainers, which I suppose tells you more about the limits of my personal benignity than I meant to.)\n\nThe movie periodically dwells, with dismaying Technicolor rapture, on crowds of all ages in the stands stuffing their faces with every imaginable comestible, from peanuts, popcorn and ice-cream cones to hot dogs, candy bars and cotton candy; it’s almost a pocket depiction of the expanding American waistline. Then there are the musical numbers, warbled either by Hutton or Dorothy Lamour, performed without amplification under enormous circus tents with brass bands blazing away and which in defiance of all the principles of sound reproduction we are expected to believe are perfectly audible to everyone in the crowd. And when the action flags, as it frequently does, we are treated to fleeting pipsqueak cameos by the likes of Arthur Q. Bryan‡, Bob Hope, Bing Crosby and even Bob Crosby in the audience, and all-too-brief three-ring bits by circus eminences such as Emmett Kelly as Weary Willie and Lou Jacobs, complete with tiny clown car; at least the young midget acrobat Cucciola gets a specialty number, although why he performs much of it in drag I leave to the psychologists in the audience. Somewhat astoundingly, it took four credited writers to concoct this sawdust mulligatawny, and I suspect there were also legions of uncredited scribes adding reams of DeMille-approved hokum. There are moments of amateurishness that defy credulity, as when DeMille cuts from two actors in front of a bad back-projection of monkeys clambering over an enclosure to the same pair closer to the camera while the rear-screen image exactly remains the same size. Still, it must be said that when one of the show’s principals falls from a great height, the action is achieved with shocking realism, and without a cut. DeMille himself narrates, with that patented sanctimonious/stentorian gasbaggery of his, made even more insufferable by the lines he speaks, which seem to imply that the Ringlings are closer to God than you or me and a lack of enthusiasm for their circus just might be subversive.\n\nBilly Wilder got off one of the great back-handed compliments in movie history when after seeing the picture at the premiere he bowed to DeMille and proclaimed, “Mr. DeMille, you have made The Greatest Show on Earth.” Such are the ways of Hollywood, however, that, in the year of The Quiet Man, The Member of the Wedding, The Bad and the Beautiful, Come Back Little Sheba and Singin’ in the Rain, this was the Motion Picture Academy’s choice for “Best Picture.”\n\nCabin in the Sky (1943) Speaking of products of another time, this exceptionally tuneful musical fantasy preserves the work of a cast of black performers at the peak of their energy and ingenuity.\n\nRaiders of the Lost Ark (1981) Forty-three years have not withered, nor repeated custom entirely staled, the finite variety inherent in this highly enjoyable collaboration between George Lucas, Steven Spielberg and Lawrence Kasdan. Watching it again in the 4K UHD edition over the Memorial Day weekend I was struck by two things: That the first quarter of the picture is, as is so often the case with 4K transfers, entirely too dark, and that Karen Allen was and remains the most delightful heroine of a popular action picture in the past five decades. No one since has matched her combination of freckled beauty, spunky independence and amiable combativeness and I cannot imagine anyone, aside perhaps from the young Shirley MacLaine, negotiating the line between passionate determination and riant silliness as Allen does. That she did not become, after Raiders, one of the more important American actresses is one of those eternal mysteries, such as why Tom Cruise is still in any way relevant to life on the planet.\n\nAirport (1970) When it comes to certain things in life, initial impressions made at an early age can, however undiscriminating they may seem to you later, carry through succeeding decades with very little change. This movie, first encountered on commercial television when I was 12, is one of those things.\n\n*Actually, to generate those sorts of profits, even world-wide, I presume that Earthquake had many return customers. But what sort of person would want to see a thing like like twice? Even at age 13 I instinctively avoided seeing it once.\n\n†A few other howlers in the long Tony Award history of nominating leading players in musicals as featured or supporting actor/actress, presumably based on billing: Isabel Bigley as Sarah Brown in Guys and Dolls; Yul Brynner in The King and I; Cyril Ritchard as Captain Hook and Mr. Darling in Peter Pan; Carol Lawrence as Maria in West Side Story (ditto Josie de Guzman in the 1980 edition); Sandra Church as Gypsy Rose Lee in Gypsy (the same thing happened to Zan Charisse and Christa Moore, respectively, in the 1975 and 1990 revivals); Theodor Bikel as Captain Von Trapp in The Sound of Music; Jerry Orbach as Sky Masterson in Guys & Dolls; Maureen Brennan as Cunegonde and Mark Baker (as Candide!) in the 1974 Candide; Patti LuPone in The Robber Bridegroom; David Kernan, Millicent Martin and Julia McKenzie, the entire singing cast of Side by Side by Sondheim; Lenny Baker, one of only four cast members in I Love My Wife; Alyson Reed as Sally Bowles(!) in the 1988 Cabaret; and, with Grimes as Molly Brown, the all-time jaw-droppers, Barbara Cook as Marian the librarian in The Music Man, Dick Van Dyke and Chita Rivera, the stars of the show, in Bye, Bye, Birdie and William Daniels in 1776. Daniels, quite rightly, refused the nomination.\n\n‡The voice, if not the mind or spirit, of Elmer Fudd.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nI recently watched, over a period of several months, the nine RKO pictures in the 2007 DVD set Astaire and Rogers: The Complete Film Collection (to me, inexplicably unavailable on Blu-ray).* I’ve seen them all, of course, more than once and, in the cases of the three best pictures in the series (The Gay Divorcee, Top Hat, Swing Time) on multiple occasions, but had not until last autumn watched them in sequence. What follows, culled from my monthly video reports, does not aspire to being a definitive overview of the series. If you’re interested in that you can do no better than to get your hands on a copy of Arlene Croce’s The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book (1972; reissued in 2010) which is, as Pauline Kael observed in The New Yorker when it was first published, “the best book that will ever be written about Astaire and Rogers.” At best, these capsule reviews might, I hope, whet your appetite for the finest series of musicals ever made in this country or, if you have also watched and loved them, remind you of the reasons for your love.\n\nBefore we go further (and this may stop you cold) understand that I regard Fred Astaire as the single most important figure in the development of the American musical movie and, in Ethan Mordden’s designation, the most wonderful man in musicals. That isn’t to suggest that he had no limitations. He wasn’t much of a listener, for one thing — Rogers had it all over her partner in that respect — and his acting hasn’t the depth she brought to what she did dramatically. I also think she’s funnier than he is; she had a grounding in comedy where his was mostly in dance. And while he was, in his way, a handsome man, he was certainly no romantic paragon. His head was curiously shaped, like a less amusing version of Stan Laurel, with a long chin and a wide head accentuated by his thinning hair and, on film, his high-forehead toupées. His singing may strike you as an acquired taste as well, thin in the higher registers and lacking that conventional power the more obvious talents in musical theatre had, sometimes to their own detriment. (Al Jolson is especially problematic in this respect.) Astaire also had large hands; he reminds me a bit of Sergei Rachmaninoff, whose freakish digital reach influenced the way he composed for the piano, to the despair of later exponents of his music. Astaire dealt with his hands, about which he was understandably self-conscious, by turning his fingers inward. If you watch him closely you’ll notice that while he’s dancing his hands are seldom open or his fingers splayed. Other dancers, with smaller hands, use their finger-widths in more overt ways, as expressive extensions of their exuberance. Astaire tried to make his disappear.\n\nSo, what, with all these seeming defects, makes Astaire so marvelous? Gore Vidal once ventured that style was, “knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.” Astaire put it more simply: “Do it big, do it right, and do it with style.” But anyone can “do it big.” Bigness is a kind of style, I suppose — no one was bigger as a theatrical singer than Ethel Merman. Yet for Merman, the bigness of her vocalizing was a part of who she was as a performer. Mary Martin, with her entrancing coloratura soprano, could be quite demure. Merman couldn’t be Mary Martin, and didn’t try. Yet when she nailed a note, like that “Ohhhhhhh…” near the climax of “I Got Rhythm,” she was doing more than stopping the show; she was telling the listener that she was so crazy in love she’d become effervescent. That’s character. (The song made her an instant Broadway star in 1930.) Astaire as I’ve said didn’t have that power, and he didn’t have anything like Merman’s range. No popular singer, however, including Bing Crosby, was more sought-after by more great songwriters than Astaire. He understood instinctively the importance of a lyric, and he gave the words the sort of emphasis, without ostentation, that made lyricists like Ira Gershwin, Cole Porter and Irving Berlin swoon; no one ever made their words sound so inevitable, so surprising or so attractive. Astaire also understood rhythm better than any male singer of his day, again including Crosby. It’s not surprising that, while he could play the piano decently (those large hands must have been an asset), his real instrument was the drum-kit. That Fred Astaire was a great dancer was understood by everyone who’d seen him, but what is less well perceived is how beautifully he moved off the dance floor, a trait he shared with Cary Grant. At the beginning of the middling caper picture The Midas Run, the camera catches the lower half of a man walking jauntily along a London street, and in seconds you know it can’t be anyone but Astaire. The walk is of a piece with his general gracefulness and his unerring sense of style in the clothing he wore, another thing he shared with Grant. He was an enormously appealing man.\n\nAstaire was also, in addition to his dancing (and although it’s not generally discussed or understood) a great choreographer for the screen. He worked out his own routines, with his friend and collaborator Hermes Pan, who doubled for Fred’s female partners as they created the dances. It was Fred Astaire more than anyone else who set the best style for shooting dance for the screen, keeping the full figures of the dancers in the frame and, whenever possible, filming in long, unbroken medium takes that captured the excitement of performance, both for the audience and for the dancers. There are not, I don’t think, any more exuberant, joyous dance duets in movies than “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain)?” in Top Hat, “Let Yourself Go” in Follow the Fleet and “Pick Yourself Up” in Swing Time, and no more devastating emotional dances than “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” in Fleet and “Never Gonna Dance,” again in Swing Time, and much of the thrill, and the pleasure, those numbers convey is due to how they were filmed. Astaire was as well a modern in his aversion to what he called “mushy stuff,” a disdain he shared with the best lyricists of the time. The love songs he sang came at romance, as Emily Dickinson would say, “slant,” and there’s no on-screen kissing in the Astaire-Rogers pictures until Carefree. Perhaps it came in part from his being yoked to his sister Adele all those years in vaudeville, in London and on Broadway, but the breeziness of Astaire’s attitude, refreshing in the 1930s, still comes across as a tonic.\n\nAstaire isn’t everything, of course, in the Astaire and Rogers movies. Ginger holds half the appeal, and what he wasn’t, she was (and vice-versa.) She wasn’t a terribly good singer, which accounts for most of the songs in their pictures being sung by Fred, but she had a gift for high comic invention Astaire hadn’t, and despite a certain coarseness in her looks and personality she was often adorable. Not the natural dancer he was, she had to work harder at it. Sometimes the work shows, but what we remember most about her dancing is how much fun she seems to be having even when, as the records show, she may have been in physical agony. Rogers’ challenge dances with Fred are the one of the things I most look forward to when I sit down to watch an Astaire-Rogers picture, along with anticipating the display of his seemingly bottomless charm and the superb music America’s best composers of popular songs turned out when they knew they were writing for him.\n\nFlying Down to Rio (1933) Remembered chiefly as the first picture in which Fred Astaire danced with Ginger Rogers. This happens in a silly but infectious number called the “Carioca,” which among other things involves the partners pressing their foreheads together. Somehow Fred and Ginger carried off that indignity with enough panache that movie audiences of 1933 demanded more of them, and you can see why; their joy in performing together was obvious. (Of course, having spent his entire performing life partnered with his sister Adele, recently retired to England, Fred was most definitely not in the mood to be yoked again to another dancer. After The Gay Divorcee in 1934 became one of the biggest hits of its year, however, the matter was effectively out of his hands.)\n\nWhile the plot, based on an unpublished comedy by the playwright and lyricist Anne Caldwell,† is perfunctory, the leads, Dolores del Río and Gene Raymond, are engaging, and the picture has a nifty gimmick: Scenes of Brazilian life that, through the creative use of the optical printer, become living picture-postcards, each flipping past to reveal the next. There is also, in Fred’s enthusiastic title number, a shocking moment (presumably the work of the movie’s producer, Merian C. Cooper, the begettor of King Kong) when during an aerial routine a young woman falls screaming from a trapeze below a biplane. She’s rescued, of course, but it’s an electrifying bit, and I wonder if George Roy Hill and William Goldman had it in mind when they made The Great Waldo Pepper 40 years later. As Arlene Croce wrote in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book, “Merian C. Cooper brought terror to the movie musical.”\n\nThe songs, which include a very likeable solo number for Ginger called “Music Makes Me,” were by Vincent Youmans, with spritely lyrics by Gus Kahn and Edward Eliscu. Flying Down to Rio is also notable for pairing two incomparable comic sissies, Franklin Pangborn and Eric Blore, as a hotel manager and his simpering assistant. Blore would come into full flower, as it were, in his later Astaire & Rogers appearances.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee (1935) After their brief duet on “The Carioca” in Flying Down to Rio set up a public clamor for more, a re-teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers by RKO was inevitable. Their first starring vehicle was an adaptation of Astaire’s last Broadway success (The Gay Divorce, a title apparently taboo under the Production Code) and in the blinkered tradition of Hollywood studio lunacy the entire Cole Porter stage score was tossed with the exception of “Night and Day,” its biggest hit. Although the movie isn’t as buoyant as the team’s best work it’s a lively picture, funny, absurd and engaging. It also sets the template for the Astaire-Rogers series: Initial dislike of Fred by Ginger (or like followed by misunderstanding leading to dislike, or some other variation on the theme), cast of wacky supporting actors (such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, the wisecracking Helen Broderick or, here, the charming Alice Brady), screwball complications, a romantic dance and, if we’re lucky, a challenge. I’m one of those oddballs — Pauline Kael was another — who prefer the non-romantic Fred & Ginger routines to their more celebrated ballroom turns, except (as in Follow the Fleet and Swing Time) when the duets are dramatic. Many think the essence of Astaire and Rogers are items like “Cheek to Cheek” and, here, “Night and Day,” and they’re marvelous expressions of romance but they don’t, at least for me, carry the absolute joy of “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” “Let Yourself Go” and “Pick Yourself Up”… the latter pair of which, juxtaposed that way, sound like an answer in one of those ironic double-feature puzzles. Dances like those sum up the appeal of Astaire and Rogers as a team far more than the formal love-duets; although they, like the ballroom dances, were thoroughly worked out, they feel spontaneous in a way the romantic dances never can. You get a sense, despite the sweat, of the joy of performance in “Isn’t it a Lovely Day (To Be Caught in the Rain?),” for example, and despite Astaire’s displeasure at being part of a team again after his sister Adele broke up the act, of the pleasure each performer took in the other.\n\nThe Gay Divorcee was directed by Mark Sandrich, who guided Astaire and Rogers in more pictures than anyone else, and his crisp style is as much a part of the team’s work as those white Art Deco sets and the loopy plots, usually cobbled by Allan Scott or Dwight Taylor. (This one was written by by George Marion Jr., Dorothy Yost and Edward Kaufman, but the original stage book was by Taylor.) David Abel’s beautiful cinematography, evident here, was on display in five of the nine pictures Astaire and Rogers made together at RKO as well as Holiday Inn, also directed by Sandrich. In this initial offering, the producers (or producer, since Pardo S. Berman was credited) hadn’t yet grasped that Astaire and Rogers were what people wanted to see, not elaborate musical numbers with a cast of thousands, so we get “The Continental” for 17 exhausting minutes, only a few of which are given over to Ginger and Fred. Worse, the creators assigned an entirely extraneous number to Edward Everett Horton(!) and a young Betty Grable, “Let’s K-nock K-nees,” which when I see it always makes me think of Arlene Croce’s riposte in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book: “Must we?” The “Night and Day” dance, on the other hand, based on the stage version choreographed by Fred, is one of the duets people who love the team remember best, and it’s beautifully worked out. The picture ends with another of Fred’s cleverly conceived dances from the stage show, in which he and Rogers sail over the sofas and chairs of his hotel suite, and it’s so casually charming it makes you grin in deep appreciation.\n\nA personal note: I first saw The Gay Divocee at a summer afternoon library screening about 40 years ago. Seated behind my friend and me were a pair of elderly Jewish women, complete with Molly Picon immigrant accents. When the picture began with nightclub patrons, including Fred, playing with little legless dolls through which their forefingers were inserted to make them “dance,” one of the women cooed happily to her companion, “Cute!… is that cute?”\n\nI can never see this movie without recalling the pleasure my friend and I got from that, at that moment and for years afterward in the remembering.\n\nRoberta (1935) Such were the vagaries of the 1930s Hollywood studio system that Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, fresh from their triumph in The Gay Divorcee, were cast as supporting characters in this adaptation of the Jerome Kern/Otto Harbach stage musical. One doesn’t mind so much that their over-the-title co-star is the charming Irene Dunne; that Randolph Scott is given equal weight is practically an offense against God and Mammon. His performance in this, and in the subsequent Follow the Fleet (see below) leave one to marvel that he ever had an important career, or that he may have been the love of Cary Grant’s young life. I hope at least he was good in bed, because he certainly stinks up this movie.\n\nWhen Fred and Ginger are on screen, or Helen Westley as Dunne’s eponymous dress-designing aunt, or Dunne herself is singing “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” Roberta is first-rate entertainment. So let’s concentrate on those strengths, shall we, and forget if we can Scott’s performance and the number of times he says something is “swell”? Fred plays a bandleader, and gets a lively number (“Let’s Begin”) with his musicians, notably Candy Candido, with whom he does a kind of genderfuck bit avant la lettre. Ginger is Fred’s American former girlfriend, passing herself off as a Polish countess (I’m not kidding) in Paris. Although Astaire and Rogers do one of their ballroom specialties, to “Lovely to Look At” and “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,” their two other numbers are a lot more fun: The satirical “I Won’t Dance” and “I’ll Be Hard to Handle,” one of those joyous episodes of thoroughly worked-out yet seemingly impromptu hoofing that were, even more than their signature romantic duets, their peculiar specialty. On the debit side, Dunne has to perform “Yesterdays,” featuring one of Harbach’s worst sets of lyrics. No singer, not even one as lyrical as Irene Dunne, can be expected to triumph with lyrics like,\n\nYesterdays\n\nDays I knew as happy sweet\n\nSequestered days […]\n\nThen gay youth was mine\n\nAnd truth was mine\n\nJoyous free and flaming life\n\nForsooth was mine\n\nWho in the 1930s talked like that, let alone sang? That last bit is so convoluted and linguistically passé it occasioned one of Billie Holiday’s few recorded lyric flubs.\n\nWilliam A. Seiter, most of whose pictures were mediocrities, directed with intelligence and a certain gracefulness of style that does what it can to make the material seem more interesting than it is. Alan Scott was one of the three credited screenwriters, and the author of the movie’s “additional dialogue” was the same Glenn Tryon who starred in the 1926 silent comedy 45 Minutes from Hollywood, with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in brief cameos, and who would go on to star in two movies (Lonesome and Broadway) for the expressionistic Hungarian director Paul Fejos before drifting into screenwriting and direction.\n\nTop Hat (1935) No one should be forced to choose a single Astaire-Rogers musical, and I am always torn between this one and Swing Time. Top Hat is probably the better movie: it’s swifter, more sparkling, lays some nice emphasis on those two incomparable sissies Eric Blore and Edward Everett Horton, and boasts a perfect Irving Berlin score including a title song that elegantly sums up the appeal of Fred Astaire, whom Graham Greene once called the human equivalent of Mickey Mouse. That isn’t the insult it seems; in the early ‘30s Mickey was not yet the figure of dull respectability he became; he was rambunctious, elastic, mischievous, even slightly cruel — just like Fred.\n\nPerhaps inspired by their “Let Yourself Go” duet in Follow the Fleet Astaire and Rogers also get a challenge-dance here to “Isn’t This a Lovely Day (to be Caught in the Rain?)” that is not only among their half-dozen or so best routines, it’s also a rapturous expression of the sheer joy of performance. If these two didn’t fall in love after a number like that, one of them would have to be frigid and the other gay. After the requisite complications, masquerades and misunderstandings, the pair performs Berlin’s lilting, sensuous “Cheek to Cheek” in a Venice ballroom and featuring Ginger’s feathered dress which, although it drove her partner to distraction, proved that she understood what looked best on her when she danced with him; and another of those new dance sensations, “The Piccolino,” led off by Ginger’s charming verse and chorus. This brings me to a side-note: However wonderful a performer Fred Astaire was — and aside from his status as the finest dancer the movies have ever known he was also one of the American songbook’s great stylists — compare the way he listens to Ginger singing with the way in which she takes in his vocalizations: He smiles a lot but looks faintly glazed; she hangs on every word whether she’s facing him or not, and always seems to be hearing them for the first time. She not only (in the cartoonist Bob Thaves’ memorable phrase) “did everything Fred did, backwards and in heels”; at times she also acted him off the screen.\n\nAll of the members of the RKO Astaire-Rogers machine were involved here: The producer Pando S. Berman; the director Mark Sandrich (he made five of their pictures, and his style is modest but elegant and his pacing is nearly always perfect); the screenwriters Allan Scott and Dwight Taylor; the cinematographer David Abel, whose polished black-and-white photography is what we think of when we remember the Astaire-Rogers pictures, along with those gloriously anachronistic all-white Art Deco sets designed by Carroll Clark but erroneously attributed to the wonderfully-named Van Nest Polglase (Venice never looked so clean); the choreography was by Fred with Hermes Pan; the musical direction and orchestrations were by Hal Bourne; and the cast includes Erik Rhodes as a silly, English-mangling Italian co-respondent, Horton as Fred’s manager, the vermouth-dry Helen Broderick as his wife and Blore as his butler Bates, who feuds with him throughout and whose machinations resolve the plot. The main titles, incidentally, are fairly unique for their time, with first Fred’s feet and legs dancing into the frame and appearing above his name, and then Ginger’s. It’s a marvelously stylish gesture, almost a shorthand, one that hints at the spirited revelry to come.\n\nProduced on a relatively lavish Depression-era budget of $609,000, Top Hat brought in $3.2 million at the box-office, and became the most profitable RKO release of the decade.\n\nFollow the Fleet (1936) Adhering to the pattern set by Roberta in 1935 (and why would you want to?) RKO once again made Astaire and Rogers more or less subservient to Randolph Scott. As if that wasn’t bad enough the men play sailors, and Astaire’s idea of expressing his working-class bona fides is to constantly be chewing gum.\n\nWell, at least Irving Berlin wrote the songs. Ginger gets the sexy “Let Yourself Go,” which she and Fred then dance to, in an “impromptu” ballroom contest exhibition. It’s one of their most joyous numbers, performed by both of them with a rubber-legged, loose-limbed panache that makes you smile broadly throughout. Most of Fred’s numbers are done with his Navy band (“We Saw The Sea,” “I’d Rather Lead A Band,” “I’m Putting All My Eggs in One Basket”) but Harriet Hilliard, the future Mrs. Ozzie Nelson (and mother of Ricky) has a splendid solo in “Get Thee Behind Me, Satan.” I know I’m in the minority in believing this to be one of Berlin’s finest ballads, but it is in any case beautifully framed by the director Mark Sandrich and his cinematographer David Abel, and at least partially redeems the horrible “Why, without your glasses you’re beautiful!” old-maid cliché Hilliard is forced to endure before she sings. (Berlin originally wrote the song, interestingly, for Rogers to perform in Top Hat. Obviously, he thought well of it.) What makes Follow the Fleet special, however, and secures it a place in movie musical history (or at least, in Astaire-Rogers iconography) is the “Let’s Face the Music and Dance” number. It was the most dramatic entry in the series until “Never Gonna Dance” in Swing Time displaced it a year later, and its seriousness of intent — it begins with Fred and Ginger in a gambling den, separately losing their bankrolls and contemplating suicide — is almost shocking in the context of so light an entertainment, and the dance between them is so charged with unstated emotionalism it’s hair-raising.\n\nThe screenplay was credited to Allan and Scott Dwight Taylor with “Additional Dialogue,” as they used to say, by Lew Lipton. At least in this one Randolph Scott doesn’t say “Swell!” every other line. Sharp eyes will spot Betty Grable as a trio singer, Lucille Ball in a small role and Humphrey Bogart as a sailor. The Hubert Osbourne 1922 play Shore Leave, on which Follow the Fleet was based, incidentally, had a long afterlife: It was also the source for the 1927 Vincent Youmans musical Hit the Deck, itself filmed by MGM in 1955.\n\nSwing Time (1936) With the 1935 Top Hat one of the two best Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers musicals, containing a pair of the team’s most exhilarating dances and, in Jerome Kern’s music and Dorothy Fields’ lyrics, just about the greatest score of its kind ever written for a movie musical. Despite its occasional longueurs (and a truly silly finale) the picture inspired Astaire to one of his supreme achievements as a choreographer: The dance with Rogers to “Never Gonna Dance.” This breathless medley not only dramatically recaps the romance of the characters in this movie but almost everything for which we love these two. The final portion, shot in a single fluid take, required 46 re-takes and somewhere in the middle of it all Rogers’ feet started to bleed.\n\nThe Howard Lindsay/Allan Scott screenplay is a bit overstuffed, or maybe it only feels that way because it was directed by George Stevens, seldom remembered for concision. It has the same clean, Art Deco look as its predecessors, thanks in part to David Abel’s gorgeous cinematography, and there’s a good supporting cast which includes Victor Moore as Astaire’s card-sharp sidekick, the always witty Helen Broderick as Moore’s eventual inamorata and, as a dyspeptic dance-school manager, the peerless Eric Blore. Kern, who more than any figure until Richard Rodgers had the most profound influence on the Broadway musical, composed a score so rich in melodic invention it dwarfs the work of almost everyone else in movies, and Fields matches him in words. Her lyrics always sparkled, but she was also a musical dramatist, beautifully evidenced in the witty “A Fine Romance”: It’s hard to imagine any male lyricist of the time other than perhaps Cole Porter writing a couplet like, “I never mussed the crease in your blue serge pants/I never get the chance,” and I am always moved by the way she constructed the lyrics for “Never Gonna Dance.” First, there is the repeated Depression-era invocation of the wolf at the door; second, the unspoken metaphor of the movies’ greatest male dancer seeming to put up his dancing shoes (“on beautiful trees”) as renunciation of an unrequited romance; third, her sharp sense of rhythmic and dramatic ascension. Ginger’s character is called Penny here, and from Fred’s repetition of the phrase, “‘Though I’m left without a penny…” Fields builds to, “So, I’m left without my Penny…” [Emphasis mine.] That’s as good in its way as Stephen Sondheim in A Little Night Music‘s “The Miller’s Son” repeating, “We’ll go dancing” and finally resolving the image as, “We’ll have dancing.”\n\nKern was uncomfortable with swing, so the rapturous “Waltz in Swing Time” was cobbled together by the orchestrator Robert Russell Bennett from themes the composer provided. Of the lyrical ballad “The Way You Look Tonight” Fields said, “The first time Jerry played that melody for me I went out and started to cry. The release absolutely killed me. I couldn’t stop, it was so beautiful.” (The song is also, at 68 bars, more than twice the length of the 32-bar standard.) The single number in Swing Time that raises eyebrows today is Fred’s “Bojangles of Harlem”; although Astaire is wearing tan make-up on his head and neck, it’s not “blackface,” which is exaggerated and used to demean and ridicule (even when black performers did it themselves) — here it’s the dancing equivalent of an actor playing Othello. Oddly, however, although Fields’ lyric certainly evokes Bill “Bojangles” Robinson, the dancer whose moves Astaire imitates in his solo is John W. Bubbles, from whom he took tap lessons, and he’s dressed in a manner similar to Bubbles’ starring role as Sportin’ Life in Porgy and Bess. If there is shame to be apportioned to the number it may lie in the music sheets bearing a notation on a certain passage as corresponding to Fred’s “jig dance,” in acknowledgment of an old child’s toy, which often (but not always) depicted a stereotyped black man. Jig (or “jigger”) dance toys do not, however, automatically represent a racist viewpoint, so one could argue about this matter endlessly instead of enjoying Astaire’s performance, especially when he’s dancing in front of, and competing with, three gigantic, identically-dressed silhouettes.‡\n\nIn Swing Time Fred’s a dancer (although he makes his living as a gambler… I said the finale was silly, and it is, but not any sillier than that plot-point) but when he meets Ginger, a dance instructor, pretends he isn’t so she’ll be forced to teach him. This leads to what seems to me the most joyous dance in the series, “Pick Yourself Up,” wherein when Astaire is forced to show off to save Rogers’ job they, in Arlene Croce‘s memorable phrase, “leave the place in flames.” With “Never Gonna Dance,” Astaire’s and Rogers’ characters bid heartbreaking adieu to each other in dance, and it’s arguably the most dramatic dance number the movies had ever seen to that time. Nothing the pair did before or after comes close… which of course means no one else could either.\n\nShall We Dance (1937) The financial returns on this, the seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, were less than half those of its predecessor, which suggested to some that the partnership was slipping with the public but there’s little reason, it seems to me, to suppose that. Rather, it was the way the team was being treated by their studio that pushed the audience away. It certainly didn’t help that they were expected to accept Fred as a Russian ballet star, a thing I’m surprised Astaire didn’t quash in the writing; he had no sympathy with the ballet and certainly little aptitude for it, and the central complication (are the pair married or aren’t they?) is at best mildly diverting and at worst annoying. It’s telling that, in addition to the credited scenarists Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano, Lee Loeb and Harold Buchman got story credit, P.J. Wolfson adaptation credit and at least three uncredited writers (Anne Morrison Chapin, James Gow and Edmund H. North) either worked on the treatment or the final script. The whole thing has a feeling of polished desperation about it, and that many writers on as slight a story as this surely indicates something.\n\nGeorge Gershwin, whose last full score this was, complained bitterly that the filmmakers did not exploit his and his brother Ira’s songs sufficiently, and he had a point. Fred sings a brief “(I’ve Got) Beginner’s Luck” to Ginger but there is no dance to go with the vocal, for example, and where a dance of loss seems absolutely required after he sings “They Can’t Take That Away from Me” to her, they’re on a fog-bound ferry so there’s no place for them to dance. Astaire has a great routine with a luxury liner’s engine room crew to “Slap That Bass,” one of his engaging specialties, but I don’t see how the song could have become a hit. “Let’s Call the Whole Thing Off” did eventually find its way into the American song book, despite rather than due to Fred and Ginger’s Central Park roller skating routine to it as did “They All Laughed,” which Rogers sings wearing a wonderfully designed flowered skirt that shows off her remarkably slender waist and which she and Astaire perform in one of their charming challenge dances. But the title number had no real chance to catch on, not only because the dance to it is based on a gimmick (a chorus of dancers wearing Ginger masks and which Rogers joins to Fred’s consternation) but largely because it is introduced by the gruesome contortions of the alleged prima ballerina Harriet Hoctor, the worst routine in the Astaire-Rogers filmography. And to think they offered her the lead in this picture!\n\nCarefree (1938) The seventh teaming of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers is the slightest of their RKO musicals, the first to lose money, and the one with the least dancing. Another of those pictures whose complicated screenwriting credits betray a certain amount of panic (the script was by Allan Scott and Ernest Pagano from an “original idea” by Marian Ainslee and Guy Endore, its “story and adaptation” by the redoubtable Dudley Nichols and Hagar Wilde, credited that same year with Bringing Up Baby) the picture casts Astaire as a dancing psychoanalyst trying to break through Rogers’ resistance to marrying Ralph Bellamy (it takes a shrink to figure that out?) and in the process falling for her himself. There are some good lines and funny situations, as when Ginger, a radio singer, wrecks her own live show under hypnosis, but there are also items that make you squirm, such as the way, again having been hypnotized, she hunts Astaire down with a shotgun, repeatedly proclaiming that “men like him should be shot down like dogs.” Fun-nee!\n\nAdding to the troubles are an ill-conceived dream sequence set to one of Irving Berlin’s less interesting tunes, which by its conception demanded to be filmed in color but which RKO refused to do, making a hash of a song Berlin pointedly called “I Used to Be Color Blind.” (It also contains a slow-motion dance, a device I resist on principle, and a prolonged kiss between Fred and Ginger, which is just plain objectionable.) There’s an extended New Dance Sensation called “The Yam,” whose melody Berlin later adapted for his war-time anthem “Any Bonds Today?” and which illustrates that a certain degree of democratization in the Astaire and Rogers universe is unwelcome; instead of those gleaming, absurd but oddly endearing white Art Deco sets complete with extras in evening dress that were the series’ mainstay from Flying Down to Rio through Swing Time we’re in a woodsy country club with patrons joining in the dance, and who wants that? Fortunately, Fred and Ginger get a good Berlin ballad (“Change Partners”) and subsequent dance routine in which he uses his big, expressive hands in an attempt to re-hypnotize her. Even better, Astaire has a jaw-dropping bit, set to a wordless tune (“Since They Turned ‘Loch Lomond’ into Swing”) in which he rhythmically hits one golf ball after another, sending every one of them soaring in perfect arcs, the entire routine performed in long, sustained camera shots. Was there nothing the man couldn’t do?\n\nThe Story of Vernon and Irene Castle (1939) Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers’ last RKO picture is also their most unusual: A “biopic” celebrating the first great, and most influential, ballroom dance team in America. Astaire’s approach to the dancing was so scrupulous (Vernon Castle was one of his youthful idols) that aficionados of Astaire and Rogers may be disappointed because they are dancing in character, and keeping to the style that made the Castles household names in the period between 1912 and 1918, especially their wildly popular “Castle Walk.” Astaire and Rogers were far better-looking than the Castles, and their teaming, still fresh on this, their ninth collaboration, makes their Vernon and Irene the most romantic pair imaginable. The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle is not, thankfully, a musical biography — no phony, Cole Porter-being-inspired-to-compose-“Night and Day”-by-raindrops moments here. The music is made up almost entirely of period instrumentals that accompany the Castles as they dance. There is only one original song (“Only When You’re in My Arms” by Con Conrad, Herman Ruby and Bert Kalmar), and it’s used as a diegetic source, Vernon singing the lyric as he works up the nerve to propose to Irene Foote. I’m always a little annoyed when I see the picture that the Foote’s family retainer was changed to a white man and played by Walter Brennan, although given the prevailing tendency in Hollywood to depict black men and women as “coons” for comic relief, it’s probably just as well that Walter Ash was written white.\n\nThis is the only RKO “Fred & Ginger” in which the pair portray a married couple (they’re also married in The Barkleys of Broadway, but that was 10 years later, at MGM) and while there is some tension between Vernon and Irene early on in their story, the typical screwball courting elements are, obviously, absent. Similarly, although the Castles’ eventual agent is played by the wry, eccentric Edna May Oliver and she becomes a genial confidante to the pair, she isn’t a full-blown zany like Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Helen Broderick or Alice Brady in the earlier Astaire-Rogers pictures. She’s only mildly zany. (Speaking of zanies: You may recognize Leonid Kinskey as the artist in Paris whom Oliver patronizes from his appearance as the bartender Sasha in Casablanca, ardent for Madeline Lebeau.) The movie is pleasantly directed by H. C. Potter, Robert de Grasse provided rich, warm photography, and there are some striking visual effects by Vernon L. Walker, particularly the sequence where the couple dances across a map of the United States. However, the affecting grief of the scene in which Walter breaks the news of Vernon’s shocking death to Irene, and Rogers’ fine acting of it, is almost canceled out by the terrible dialogue Brennan is given to speak. Astaire is engaging, as he nearly always is, yet in some ways Vernon and Irene Castle is a showcase for Rogers, from her hilariously overblown rendition of “The Yama-Yama Man” to the moment, late in the picture, when Irene unexpectedly meets Vernon, an RAF volunteer, in a nightclub and as he embraces her she whispers, “Oh, Vernon” in a way that in its emotion and anxiety seems to anticipate her husband’s later needless death. Rogers gives a beautiful performance in what Arlene Croce in The Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers Book rightly calls “a very dear film.”\n\nFor the record, the screenplay was by Richard Sherman, Oscar Hammerstein II and Dorothy Yost. The movie is often referred to as a flop. It wasn’t — it was popular with the public — but its budget (approximately $1,196,000) meant that even its high gross ($1,825,000) did not allow it to break even.\n\n*Swing Time has been made available on Blu-ray in the Criterion Collection, presumably because the inveterate auteurists at Criterion regard it as a director’s picture rather than as a Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers movie.\n\n†Caldwell, one of the most prolific librettists of her time, frequently collaborated with Jerome Kern. Together the pair wrote one of the most charming numbers heard in a stage musical (She’s a Good Fellow, 1919) of the early 20th century, “The Bullfrog Patrol.” This delightful harmonized duet, originally performed by the Duncan Sisters, virtually defines what the Germans mean by the term Ohrwurm, which we translate as “earworm.” Caldwell is virtually forgotten today, but my hat is off to a lyricist who could write a line like, “I wish that Bolsheviki froggy-dog would croak!” I realize the song is written (and composed) in a minstrel form, which today puts it, I suppose, automatically beyond the… er… pale… but listening to Jeanne Lehman and Rebecca Luker’s 1992 version of it always gives me enormous pleasure.\n\n‡And no, Virginia, “jig” when applied to dance is not racist terminology, despite the teeth-gnashing of the Woke Ignoratti. (Nor is it, even if Millennials and their Gen-Z successors believe so, interchangeable with the word “gig.”) “Jigger,” it will shock them to learn, is innocent as well. These people are like the old movie censors: By their hysteria they suggest that their own racist impulses are at work in their protestations; by their volubility, they only encourage the rest of us to use the words they object to more often.\n\nText copyright 2024 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAs ever, click on the highlighted links for complete reviews &cet.\n\nA Star is Born (1937) The first of (so far) four identically-titled variations on the theme of upward/downward pop stardom. The movie seems to get remade every 20 or 30 years, as popular tastes and styles and the modes of stardom change; I suppose the next edition will highlight internet “influencers.”\n\nI missed the Streisand-Kristofferson edition in 1976 and, having no interest in either Bradley Cooper or Lady Gaga, do not expect to see the most recent iteration, but I have seen the picture that predated and seems to have inspired A Star is Born, the 1932 George Cukor-directed What Price Hollywood? in which the doomed romance was between a young starlet (Constance Bennett) and an older, alcoholic director (Lowell Sherman). The most striking aspect of Cukor’s picture is the way, a moment before Sherman pulls the trigger on the gun with which he shoots himself, a remarkable series of flashing images fills the screen — the final, fleeting thoughts of a suicide. (It’s the sort of thing that ought to make the auteurists swoon.) There is nothing as interesting in the 1937 A Star is Born, although admirers of the 1954 Judy Garland musical remake will note that it follows the second half of the original extremely closely, with nearly identical sequences and dialogue, or anyway until James Mason’s swim out to sea and the assault on Garland by her fans at his funeral. The first half is more labored, and dated, not least in Janet Gaynor’s twinkling performance, her tight, marcelled look, the clichéd opening scenes and the ugly early Technicolor process in which the movie was photographed, which likewise contributed to the artistic failure, also in 1937, of Nothing Sacred, like Star is Born directed by William A. Wellman, produced by David O. Selznick and starring Fredric March.\n\nMarch, one of America’s most interesting actors (if, like Robert Ryan, never quite the popular star he should have been) grounds the role of Norman Maine so thoroughly that his decline, which can seem like a scenarist’s contrivance, becomes devastating; the haunted look he expresses as he embraces Gaynor a final time, is among the most breathtaking human images in American movies. Wellman, who worked on the story with Robert Carson, directed intelligently and with surprising sensitivity, especially in the camper honeymoon scene between March and Gaynor. The screenplay, credited to Carson, Dorothy Parker and Parker’s husband Alan Campbell, gets better as it goes along, although, as with the character in 1954, I don’t buy the studio head Oliver Niles (Adolphe Menjou) as a gentle, kindly old thing — just try to imagine Samuel Goldwyn or Harry Cohn, purring the way Menjou does. Worse, however, is Lionel Stander’s miscasting as the production chief Matt Libby. In the Garland-Mason version, Jack Carson as Libby expressed as much charm as nastiness, and his readings had an almost Cowardian sophistication; Stander barks and growls like a New Jersey dockworker who has unaccountably found himself employed behind the notions counter at Harrod’s. Aside from March, the best acting is done by May Robson in the impossible role of Gaynor’s no-nonsense grandmother Lettie. Andy Devine, of all people, plays Gaynor’s Hollywood confidante while Peggy Wood, Guinn “Big Boy” Williams, Francis Ford, Edgar Kennedy and Clara Blandick, later immortal as Dorothy Gale’s Auntie Em, have small but telling roles. Kenneth Howell, appearing as an injured teenage drunk in the courtroom sequence, looks heartbreakingly young to have smashed up his life so badly, and is movingly grateful for the suspended sentence the judge (Jonathan Hale) bestows on him.\n\nHatari! (1962) An overlong but extravagantly entertaining collaboration between John Wayne, Howard Hawks and the scenarist Leigh Brackett about a team of hunters in Africa. The kicker is that they are not shooting the animals but capturing them for zoos, which must have seemed refreshing in 1962, although it’s less reassuring today, when increasing numbers of people see zoos as little more than prisons for exotic beasts, maintained for the public’s dubious (and frankly, repulsive) benefit. We wouldn’t put a human being behind bars for our own edification, so why should a rhinoceros be any different? The means by which Wayne’s team traps the creatures are also antiquated: Running the animals to exhaustion in all-terrain vehicles. (They use tranquilizers now.) Yet the chase sequences, thrillingly filmed by Russell Harlan and kinetically edited by Stuart Gilmore, are among the most exciting Hawks ever directed, with the actors clearly doing the work and putting themselves in danger while doing so. (Although Wayne was reportedly, and quite understandably, terrified sitting in that external seat with nothing to protect him from danger but a seatbelt, he doesn’t show it.) In typical Hawksian manner, into this largely male enclave comes an attractive outsider (Elsa Martinelli) while two of the team (Hardy Krüger and Gérard Blain) battle each other for the affections of a girl (Michèle Girardon) who isn’t interested in either of them. The Girardon subplot is mildly diverting but Martinelli is so obviously out of her element (whatever that might have been) that she becomes a beautiful embarrassment; her character is meant to be appealing but you cringe every time she goes on one of her irrational crying jags. By the end of it, arrived at via an unfunny chase sequence, you long for Wayne to kick her in the seat of her pants, or at least send her back to Italy. Instead, he marries her. Go figure.\n\nHenry Mancini composed a lively score, with a sinuous, percussion-driven main theme and some charming interludes including the famous “Baby Elephant Walk.” Sometime around 1965 I heard Mancini’s infectious recording on the radio and it so delighted me I began walking around hunched over with my arms in front of my face for a trunk and the tips of my fingers brushing the floor, moving joyously in time to the music. I can’t touch the floor that way today, but the piece still makes me smile.\n\nThe Killer Elite (1975) A standard ’70s thriller from Sam Peckinpah’s late, booze-and-coke period, elevated by its cast and their director’s self-identification with the material. The script by Marc Norman and Stirling Silliphant follows the basic contours of its source, the pseudonymous novel Monkey in the Middle, in which the espionage agent Mike Locken is not killed but deliberately wounded by an assassin, accepts a new assignment during his physical rehabilitation to smoke out the killer and gradually comes to realize he’s being played by his duplicitous superior. In the book, the figure Locken is assigned to protect and to spirit out of England is a charismatic African leader hopeful of taking advantage of unrest in his (fictional) nation to bring about a democratic change. In the movie it’s a Chinese dissident, although we’re never really sure where he comes from, where he’s hoping to go, what he expects to do or even what he represents to the people of his country. This is seen by Peckinpah’s critics as a sign of his contempt for the material he’s been offered and there may be some truth to that. To Pauline Kael (“Notes on the Nihilist Poetry of Sam Peckinpah,” The New Yorker, 4 January 1976) the attraction to the script for the filmmaker was his identification with the professional at its center, whored out by pimps (i.e., United Artists and Mike Medavoy, who got him the job as a favor) with whom he had to battle, eternally engaging in subterfuge and sly satire of the creeps to whom he owed his livelihood. I suspect that’s closer to the mark, especially considering the paranoia cocaine engenders in its users. Someone — and I have no idea whether it was Norman, Silliphant or Peckinpah — made the wounding assassin Locken’s best friend and colleague, upping the personal ante, and switched the locale to San Francisco and the African leader to a Chinese national. It was Silliphant, however, who insisted his wife Tiana Alexandra be cast as the man’s daughter, and she’s so bad in the picture, and was from what one hears aggressively unpleasant to boot, that her role was reduced in scope and made to look ridiculous, as when she informs James Caan’s Locken, unbidden, that she’s a virgin and is promptly told by him that he doesn’t give a shit.\n\nGiven these conditions, and limitations, and Peckinpah’s coke addiction, the wonder is that The Killer Elite is so entertaining. (Watching the picture a second time with the commentary track on, the Brahman snottiness of Paul Seydor, who makes his own contempt for it quite clear from the beginning, made me like the thing even more.)* The picture sometimes looks cheap — considering his filmography, the budget for this one was shockingly low — and is, overall, less violent and bloody than might be expected. (The sequence in which Caan’s wounds are operated on is the most disturbing in the movie.) Yet there are moments in it that resonate, especially the imposing setting for the climax: The U.S. Navy “mothball fleet” off Suisun Bay. Those huge, empty battleships, slowly rotting in the California sun, provide such a ghostly, unnerving backdrop I’m surprised the government permitted Peckinpaw to film there. There is beautifully lucid cinematography by Philip Lathrop and splendid performances by Caan, Robert Duvall as his betrayer, Arthur Hill as their commander, Gig Young as his superior, Mako as the enigmatic Chinese and Bo Hopkins as Locken’s chief gunman. Burt Young gives a Burt Young performance as Locken’s driver, complete with unintentional mispronunciations, and as Caan’s love-interest Kate Heflin has, alas, the same physiognomy as her father Van. The typically dark Jerry Fielding score is one of his finest of the period.\n\nSons of the Desert (1934) With Way Out West one of Laurel and Hardy’s two best features. The boys want to travel to their lodge’s convention in Chicago, Ollie’s wife won’t let him go, the pair pretend they’re sailing to Honolulu on a rest-cure cruise for Ollie and, once they get back, are horrified to discover that the ship they are supposed to be on has sunk at sea. At an hour and 4 minutes it’s among the most tightly-packed of sound comedies and the comic sequences are beautifully worked-out. (The credited screenwriter was Frank Craven, later the originator of the Stage Manager in Thornton Wilder’s Our Town, and the uncredited scenarists included Stan Laurel, Charley Chase, Glenn Tryon, Hal Roach and the director, William A. Seiter.) Chase has a great role as an obnoxious conventioneer, Mae Busch is exceptionally funny as Ollie’s formidable wife, Dorothy Christy is both handsome and commanding as Stan’s gun-toting spouse and the sharp of eye can spot Ellen Corby in the Chicago nightclub to which the boys retire and the young Robert Cummings in the steamship office. The print on the recent Laurel & Hardy: The Definitive Restorations Blu-ray is a revelation, making Kenneth Peach’s sharp black-and-white images fairly shimmer.\n\nSons of the Desert, by the way, later became the name of the International Laurel & Hardy Society, founded by the team’s first important biographer, John McCabe, in 1965. Al Kilgore devised the official escutcheon and Stan himself suggested the motto which translated from the Latin is, appropriately, “Two minds without a single thought.”\n\nDownhill Racer (1969) A curious mix of (then) new-style filmmaking and old-fashioned dramaturgy. Brian Probyn’s widescreen cinematography is, in the skiing sequences, astounding, and must have been a knockout on a big theater screen; the camera gives the viewer so close a view of the experience of racing you feel as if you have become the athlete. I don’t know how this was managed, particularly since Downhill Racer predates by years the development of the Steadicam, but I assume that, somehow, the movie camera was attached to either skis or skier. You may feel, at the end of each sequence, as if you have stopped breathing until the concluding seconds.\n\nUnfortunately, all of this technical virtuosity is wedded to a screenplay by the novelist James Salter (A Sport and a Pastime) that wallows in cliché, fitfully camouflaged with trendy sex, his specialty. Chappellet, the cold, ambitious athlete at its center (the ambitious are always cold in American movies) is a cipher, the worldly European (Camilla Sparv) with whom he has a seemingly passionate affair is a fraud, his coach (Gene Hackman) could have been played by Pat O’Brien in the 1940s and there is little reason, aside from the movie’s undeniable visual excitement, to care whether Chappellet wins his Olympic race or not. The skier, played with a combination of intensity and cool by Robert Redford, regards his fellow Olympic team members as impediments to his own achievement, and even discovering that he came by his taciturn nature honestly — that his farmer father (Walter Stroud) is as closed off and uncommunicative as his son — does little to make us care about the skier. Considering the parade of platitudes he was given to recite, Hackman makes the coach a vivid presence, and the other skiers include Kenneth Kirk, Jerry Deexter and the young Dabney Coleman. Kenyon Hopkins, who did splendid work as the composer for 12 Angry Men, The Hustler and, especially, The Fugitive Kind, wrote a score of crashing badness for Downhill Racer, one that over-emphasizes every action and reaches crescendos of barely-contained hysteria just before the picture’s several skiing accidents. It’s almost shockingly poor music to have come from so gifted a source and one wonders whether the director, Michael Ritchie, trying to salvage his dramatically inert movie, insisted on it.\n\nThe Love Parade (1929) One of the very few early talkie musicals that not only still holds up but gives you a real sense of how much the musical could accomplish in the hands of people who knew what they were doing. Maurice Chevalier plays a Graustarkian Count assigned to a diplomatic post in Paris who (we are told) has succumbed so thoroughly to the the charms of the City of Light he’s lost his original accent and gained a thick French one. When he’s recalled to his country as a result of his scandalous behavior, the Queen (Jeanette MacDonald), whose lack of a husband is the primary concern of the entire nation, falls for him. At this point, the logical next step for the people who wrote these sorts of things would have been to have placed impediments between the two that prevented their union. Here they marry, and only then do their problems begin.\n\nThis sort of nonsense requires enormous charm from the performers and a corresponding level of wit from the creators to keep you engaged instead of asking niggling logical questions that take your attention away from the people on the screen. The Love Parade had what was needed in all departments: From Maurice Chevalier as the Count, from Guy Bolton’s script, from the Victor Schertzinger-Clifford Grey song score and, especially, from Ernst Lubitsch’s direction. (Even Jeanette MacDonald, by whose looks I am slightly repelled and towards whose Melpomenic extravagances I am at best lukewarm, is rather engaging.) Bolton was an old hand at such things; with P.G. Wodehouse and Jerome Kern he had originated the small, “modern” Broadway musical in the Princess Theatre shows of the 1920s, which eschewed the operetta style, replacing its big choral elements with more intimate numbers and developed in colloquialism an alternative to the fustian pomposity of the Victor Herbert and Rudolph Friml school. The Love Parade doesn’t take itself seriously for a moment; it has the witty irrelevancy of a Wodehouse fable, and this extends to the often blissfully silly songs, such as when Chevalier sings “Paris, Stay the Same” and is toasted by the many soignée women with whom he’s been involved. Not only does his valet (Lupino Lane) take up the refrain, echoed by the chambermaids with whom he has been dallying, the valet’s French bulldog and his grieving bitches also join in.\n\nIf I have a complaint about the picture it’s due to Lane’s broad, extravagantly loose-limbed style of performance, so beloved of West End theatregoers of the time. I was equally annoyed 35 years ago by the reproduction of that style in the revival of his inexplicably popular musical Me and My Girl whose idiotic book, stunningly to me, Stephen Fry was credited with revising. Lane on screen almost makes me pine for El Brendel; fortunately, he’s paired with the charming Lillian Roth. While the songs are, overall, not as catchy as the numbers Rodgers & Hart wrote three years later for Love Me Tonight, Schertzinger and Grey came up with a charming title song and, in “Dream Lover,” a standard that recurs in orchestral versions in seemingly dozens of later Paramount pictures including Billy Wilder’s American debut as a writer-director, The Major and the Minor. Grey’s lyrics, like Bolton’s dialogue, are dazzlingly brazen sexually, achieving with strong innuendo what rappers would one day spell out explicitly. (Guess whose lyrics are more enchanting?) “Nobody’s Using It Now” could have been written by Cole Porter at his most erotically playful — it reminds me a bit of both “Nobody’s Chasing Me” and “I Sleep Easier Now” from Porter’s later Out of This World — and “My Love Parade” is nearly as intoxicating as the Rodgers & Hart “Lover.” Although The Love Parade was only his third talkie, Lubtisch brought such assurance to the picture you’d think he’d been making musical comedies for years. It contains the qualities we most associate with him: The deliciously louche attitude toward sex, the sunniness of outlook and the astonishingly adult intelligence of the material. This may have been the picture that caused Lubitsch to remark that he’d been to Paris, France and to Paris, Paramount and preferred the latter.\n\nThief (1981) Michael Mann’s striking debut as a writer-director has the cool, dark, blue-accented cinematography we associate with pictures like Manhunter and Heat, although Mann only worked with the cinematographer Donald E. Thorin this once. James Caan, is the titular figure, and he gives an intense, perfectly-scaled performance of a man who because of his background is incapable of surrendering his independence, an inflexible philosophy that virtually ensures the loss of everything he values. Caan’s Frank (no last name is ever given) is frighteningly, if explicably, mercurial, and at the climax he destroys the entire edifice he has painstakingly built from a prison fantasy of what constitutes a successful life. Thief is rigorously logical, and intelligent. It’s also beautifully cast, with Tuesday Weld as Frank’s tremulous yet forceful wife, Willie Nelson in the small but affecting role of Frank’s prison mentor, Jim (billed as James) Belushi as his closest cohort and, in a quietly terrifying performance, Robert Prosky as the mob boss who slowly insinuates himself into Frank’s life, with cataclysmic results. The movie is impressively shot and put together, and when you see something like the gaudy lights of mercantile Chicago reflected off the hood of Frank’s shiny luxury model car as he makes a fateful night drive the image achieves a kind of metallic poetry and metaphorical potency denied to what my friend Eliot M. Camarena refers to as the “Look-a-me!” gyrations of a Martin Scorsese.\n\nPack Up Your Troubles (1932) This cleverly conceived Laurel and Hardy feature, written by the old L & H hand H. M. Walker and competently directed by George Marshall and Raymond McCarey (Leo’s brother) is sometimes charming but ultimately a little too sentimental for its own good. It trades on Chaplinesque emotion (specifically from The Kid) and even, in its First World War trench sequence, a bit on Chaplin’s social realism (Shoulder Arms) and you nay wish it was a great deal funnier than it is. There are, however, compensations, as there nearly always are with Stan and Ollie, especially during a sequence in which the pair manage, innocently, to utterly demolish a wedding. While she’s no Jackie Coogan, little Jacquie Lyn is remarkably ingenuous as the orphaned daughter of a dead soldier and the good supporting cast includes Don Dillaway, Mary Carr, James Finlayson, Grady Sutton, C. Montague Shaw, Billy Gilbert, Adele Watson and, in an unsettling scene, Richard Cramer as a wife-beating thug. As usual, Stan did uncredited work on the script, and (also as usual) I presume the more gruesome gags in the picture were his.\n\nAmerican Masters — Mike Nichols (2016) Whenever I see the photo, above, of Nichols as a child with his mother in Germany I am struck by the pensiveness of his expression. Is the future director judging the family sedan critically, with an eye to how he might make it perform better? Whatever else may be said of Nichols’ work, in movies and in the theatre, it was and is seldom less than intelligent; you can no more imagine him directing a slobby, panting sex comedy like Porky’s than you can picture Stephen Sondheim composing “You Light Up My Life,” except perhaps as a parody.† Rediscovering as an adult my early appreciation for Mike Nichols’ often extraordinary achievements caused me to realize that, along with a goodly amount of the usual dross children and the young embrace and which embarrasses them to confront in their later maturity, there was much I rightly appreciated from a young age. Unfortunately, I had then allowed others — usually but not always, critics — to turn me from my early enthusiasms, or in any case to find them suspect. I number among those pleasures, happily regained in adulthood, the work of Billy Wilder, Blake Edwards, William Goldman, Bob Fosse, Peter Bogdanovich and Alfred Hitchcock, the early enthusiasm for which my reading of (among others) Pauline Kael, John Simon, Dwight MacDonald and the forenamed Mr. Goldman, had dampened. (Although they were correct about his ponderous later work.) In the middle of Goldman’s seminal 1968 book The Season: A Candid Look at Broadway lies a withering chapter on Nichols’ alleged facile slickness, which I blush to admit caused me, at 16, to look at movies I had previously venerated (The Graduate, Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?) with a jaundiced eye. In his splendid biography of Nichols, Mark Harris suggests it might take an entire book to try getting at what Goldman was so outraged about. Was Nichols’ then nearly unbroken string of successes what really chapped Goldman’s ass?\n\nIf William Goldman expected Mike Nichols’ piper to be paid eventually, he soon got his wish: The expensive, ill-advised 1970 movie of Catch-22 ended one of the longest winning-streaks in American popular culture, from the early success of Nichols’ partnership with Elaine May to his direction of a string of Neil Simon’s theatrical hits (Barefoot in the Park, The Odd Couple, Plaza Suite) to the movies that cemented his status as a seemingly unstoppable wunderkind. (Frankly, if there was a facile artist at work here, it was more often Simon than Nichols.) Carnal Knowledge, with Jules Feiffer, was a modest hit, but The Day of the Dolphin and The Fortune bombed, and Nichols returned to the theatre, where he remained for years. We don’t have his theatre work to study, of course, as we do his movies, but despite what his critics saw as shallow facility (shades of the fraternity’s collective attitude towards Fosse… and William Goldman) what Nichols was really up to, and what he understood better than nearly anyone, was human behavior. It’s at the core of his and May’s often wildly funny improvisations; no matter how hard they make us laugh, their routines first cause us to us recognize their characters’ sharply-delineated humanity. That’s what made them so damned funny. When, during a sketch at the 1959 Emmy awards May presented Nichols (as one Lyle Glutz) with a trophy for being “the most total mediocrity in the industry” and his character exulted, “This is the proudest moment of my life!” you just knew that it was.\n\nMay includes that moment in the “American Masters” portrait of Nichols, which she put together, and it’s one of the few performance clips in the show. Whatever its lofty intentions, the series has an unfortunate tendency. not just to hagiography (and in that Mike Nichols is no exception) but to formula: Here is the artist, and we will now present countless talking-heads to praise him. Instead, May’s “American Masters” segment relies largely on video footage from a Julien Schlossberg interview with Nichols to tell his story — or rather, to let Nichols tells Nichols’ story. There are few pleasures in contemporary life as complete as watching a Mike Nichols interview, and hearing him reminisce about his life, his aimless (or anyway, formless) early experience with the Compass Players (later the Second City), the years with May and what he thought he was doing in the theatre and in movies, as opposed to what commentators believed he was up to, is as satisfying a way to spend an hour as any divertissements I have enjoyed in years. May’s brief snippets of other interviews add little to our understanding of Nichols, and two of them put me in a minor rage; the only thing more maddening than having to listen to that part-time actor (and, apparently, full-time CIA asset) Tom Hanks blather on about Charlie Wilson, who as much as anyone aside from Zbigniew Brzeziński was responsible for the ongoing disaster of American involvement in the Middle East,‡ is hearing Hanks’ pal Spielberg talk about his teenage auteurism, as if he were the only young person in history to have made an 8-millimeter home movie. Fortunately, there are few such lapses, and they are brief. May honors her old compatriot, one-time lover and lifelong friend in a way I suspect he would have appreciated, or at least not been too embarrassed about.\n\nBrief Encounter (1945) There are few popular movies as thoroughly worked-out as this Noël Coward-David Lean collaboration about a pair of married strangers who meet by chance in a railway refreshment room, fall in love, flirt with a physical dalliance and part in an agonizingly ironic manner. Yet despite its schematic nature, and some embarrassingly over-cooked dialogue, particularly for Trevor Howard as the masculine partner in the love-affair, the picture has a strangely compelling integrity. You care, not only for the guilt-ridden lovers but for the lives they have built with others and which neither is sanguine about upsetting and the end, when it comes, is almost unbearably moving.\n\nLean, whose directorial career at this point in the 1940s was entirely yoked to Coward’s writing (In Which We Serve, This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit preceded Brief Encounter) directed as if the script had no theatrical origin. Coward — in association with Lean, Anthony Havelock-Allan and Ronald Neame — adapted it from the one-act Still Life, one of the nine playlets making up his three-part omnibus Tonight at 8:30 in which he’d starred with Gertrude Lawrence, but his director seldom sees a proscenium arch. Only at the climax, when he plays with lighting effects to heighten the anguish Johnson is going through does he betray any overt sense of theatre, and he immediately upends this, almost literally, by tilting the camera to suggest the emotional upheaval the character is going through as she stands unsteadily and hurtles herself at the refreshment room door. Brief Encounter is a picture that, while staged on fabricated sets, feels unbound by conventional settings (much of it was filmed at the Carnforth railway station in Lancashire). It is also unconcerned with prevailing modes of beauty: although Johnson is an attractive woman neither she nor Howard can be said to be a glamour-puss, and when her character is overtaken by a suicidal urge, Lean films her in the aftermath in the most unflattering manner imaginable, her hair flying over her face and forehead, giving the figure a look of utter despair that matches what she is feeling, and what the actress is expressing, at that moment.\n\nJohnson, who in her private journals expressed strong reservations both about the script and her own performance, has exceptional poise and nothing she does strikes the wrong note. In a way her character represents a comforting, repressed portrait of married middle-class British respectability; Laura Jesson is the sort of person I doubt Coward associated with past his adolescence but which he felt compelled, I suppose, to uphold, since her type doubtless represented more than half his core theatrical audience. What’s admirable about her is her resilience, which has strength but not rigidity. She feels guilt over her attraction to Howard’s Alec Harvey, and she only ever permits her feelings to take her so far and no further… but even here I’m not being entirely fair to her, since she would succumb to Alec’s gentle blandishments but for an unfortunate event of mistiming. There is much we project onto Johnson, especially in the beautifully staged sequence on the train where she gazes from her window at the passing scenery and fantasizes a life with Alec. Except for her smile of pleasure toward the end she could be thinking of almost anything and the scene would work. (She, and Trevor Howard, are also blessedly mature, then as now most often an impediment to a financially successful romance.)\n\nHoward is equally impressive, although he has occasionally to struggle with some of the script’s most purple dialogue. (Although billed as “Noël Coward’s Brief Encounter,” there is no screenplay credit in the main titles, and it’s notable that Lean, Havelock-Allan and Neame, not Coward, shared the Academy Award nomination the picture received for its script.) Lean and others later claimed Howard was one of the stupidest men they’d ever known, which I admit shocked me a little as I had always thought he projected rare intelligence. In later years Lean wished he’d cut the scenes between the refreshment room proprietor played by Joyce Carey and Stanley Holloway’s ticket inspector but they give the story a needed levity, providing sharp contrast as well to the clandestine lovers. Robert Krasker’s cinematography is among the best war-time jobs on either side of the Atlantic, crisp yet expansive, and although the use of Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 feels a bit overdone, especially now that his sort of heavy romanticism has largely faded from popular consciousness. Still, its yearning qualities are nicely expressed by the pianist Eileen Joyce.\n\nCharley and the Angel (1973) I was taken to see this comic Disney fantasy almost exactly 51 years ago and enjoyed it enough to request that our local library order a copy for me via inter-library loan of the book on which it was based, Will Stanton’s The Golden Evenings of Summer. Stanton’s book is essentially a collection of short stories in which the narrator recalls one Depression summer of his pubescence, but it’s not a children’s novel although a child of 12, as I then was, could certainly read and enjoy it. I read it again when I was in my early 20s, have just re-read it, and it remains one o"
