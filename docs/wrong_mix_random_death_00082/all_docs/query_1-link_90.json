It seems likely that Wally doesn’t know the stagehand’s name at all.\n\nAUNTS, second quotation: Add citation of TMM ch 16 §4.\n\nBAAL, the priests of: See I Kings 18:28.\n\nBAGSTER, Ellabelle: change “Cosmopolitan” to “Cosmopolis”; add citation to McClure-GOF\n\nBALL, Neal: Cornelius “Neal” Ball (1881–1957), shortstop for Cleveland Naps, did indeed make an unassisted triple play as described on July 19, 1909.\n\nBAND OF HOPE: founded 1847; still in operation today as Hope UK, educating young people about drug and alcohol abuse\n\nBANDOLERO, The: 1899 song by Leslie Stuart; Peter Dawson’s recording of it is on YouTube; sheet music online at IMSLP.org.\n\nBANKS, Henderson: add cross-reference to Volume 2 for Jno. Henderson Banks in MNI-BES, a revision of Strand-PAW.\n\nBANNISTER, Ann: The differences between magazine and book versions need a bit of sorting out. In magazines she is receptionist to I. J. Zizzbaum; in books she is governess to Joey Cooley; in magazines she attempts to become Hazel June’s press agent; in books, April June’s. Eggy Mannering does not appear in the magazine versions.\n\nBARKER, Ellen and Horace: add cross-references to Ellen and Horace Parker\n\nBAYARD, Chevalier (1473–1524): French knight “without fear and without reproach”\n\nBEARCAT, Tennessee: Hyphenated as Bear-Cat in Strand-JOW and Pearson-CRH and USArgosy-CRH and MLF-CRH; two words as Bear Cat in Colliers-JOW.

Correctly spelled Sam Behrman both in FRL and USFRL.\n\nBELLE OF WELLS, The: an echo of Seymour Hicks’s 1906 production of The Beauty of Bath, to which Wodehouse contributed a lyric, “Mr. Chamberlain,” to music by Jerome Kern.\n\nBELLPORT: Plum and Ethel Wodehouse began their married life in 1914 in Bellport, Long Island.\n\nBELSHAZZAR: see the book of Daniel, chapter 5, in the Old Testament.\n\nBELSEY, Richard: In real life, the valet of Seymour Hicks; also move to proper alphabetical place above Belshazzar.\n\nBENNETT, Constance (1904–1965): American stage and film actress. IM notes that she costarred with Cary Grant in a 1937 radio play of The Medicine Girl.\n\nBENNETT, J. Rufus: I’m having trouble confirming that he is retired; the word does not appear in GOB in that context. He is a hypochondriac, a better description than the florid one in the rest of the first sentence, which is not in Wodehouse’s wording (no “one foot”; no “grave” in that sense). Add citation of TMM ch 1,8,10,12–14,16.\n\nBENSONBURG: a stand-in for Remsenburg, Long Island, where the Wodehouses bought a house in 1952 and lived there full-time from 1955 onward.\n\nBENTLEY, Owen: In Strand-POM his girlfriend’s surname is Shepperd.

The only Bill in MLF-MOM is Katie’s “Uncle Bill,” her pet name for Henry, the waiter at MacFarland’s who narrates the story.\n\nBIVATT, Margaret: In Colliers-JOW she is in love with Freddie Bingham instead.\n\nBLACK FOR LUCK: “A Black Cat for Luck” in Red Book is much different from the Strand version, and closer to the version in MTL in the way the story progresses, but the book version does have some variant readings that follow Strand as well.\n\nBLENKINSOP: In Strand-PAW she is merely Maud Blenkinsop; in PicRev-PAW she is Maude Kellog Blenkinsop.\n\nBLOOMER, Steve (1874–1938): English soccer international, playing for England 1895–1907.\n\nBLORE, Eric (1887–1959): tubby English comic actor, in Hollywood from 1931 mostly in comic valet, butler, or waiter roles, including five of the ten RKO Fred Astaire–Ginger Rogers films.\n\nBLUE BOAR (Windlehurst): Add citation of TMM ch 14.\n\nBOADICEA: Omitted from TMM.\n\nBOOCH, Cosmo: Not present in ThisWeek-LAG or Pearson-LAG; Mr. Brinkmeyer gets the poke in the snoot instead.\n\nBOOTH THEATRE: at 222 W. 45th Street, Manhattan; opened 1913.\n\nBORNEO WIRE-SNAKE: Omitted in TMM.\n\nBRADSTREET, John M. (1815–1863): American founder of a credit-rating firm, merged 1933 with Dun & Co. to form today’s Dun & Bradstreet.\n\nBRADY, Diamond Jim (1856–1917): in full James Buchanan Brady, American financier and philanthropist, known as a gourmand\n\nBREWSTER, Sgt Herbert: Both UK and US books describe him as a “fellow member” with Gussie Mortlake of the village cricket team; “captain” is not mentioned.\n\nBRIGGS, Anthony, JP: Add cross-reference to Volume 7 for IIB ch 3.\n\nBRIGGS, Stanley: a disguised version of real-life Seymour Hicks (1871–1949), British actor, playwright, producer, manager, who gave Wodehouse his first professional theatrical work as a lyricist. Cf. Richard Belsey, The Belle of Wells, Briggs Theatre, etc.\n\nBRIGGS THEATRE: Note that NGW mentions both the Briggs Theatre and the Hicks Theatre as being in Shaftesbury Avenue.\n\nBRINKMEYER, Beulah: Her name is given as Brinkwater in USLAG, presumably to avoid similarity to Louis B. Mayer’s name. In Pearson-LAG and ThisWeek-LAG, the Temple of the New Dawn subplot is omitted.\n\nBRINKMEYER, Theodore P.: His name is given as Brinkwater in USLAG, presumably to avoid similarity to Louis B. Mayer’s name. In magazine versions, he gets the poke in the snoot which is targeted for Cosmo Booch in book versions.\n\nBRODIE: American slang reference for a dive, from Steve Brodie (1861–1901), American who claimed to have jumped from the Brooklyn Bridge in 1886 and survived.\n\nBRONX CHEER: rude sound made by blowing through the lips, “raspberry”\n\nBROOKE-HAVEN: Plum and Ethel Wodehouse moved to Bellport, a hamlet of the town of Brookhaven, Long Island, in 1914, shortly after their marriage.\n\nBROOKPORT: the name comes from combining Brookhaven and Bellport; see preceding note.\n\nBROTHER MASONS: In USFRL, not published till three years later, the rights netted $3,000 per daughter.\n\nBRUDOWSKA, Mme: Mistaken entry; Archie Moffam thought she was a snake-handling vaudeville performer, but her press agent Roscoe Sherriff clarifies that she is a high-brow tragedienne, whose snake Peter (supposedly given her by a Russian prince) is a mascot given by him for publicity purposes.\n\nBRYANT, Adonis: add cross-reference to Bryant Washburn\n\nBRYCE, P.C. Robert: cf. Michael Ryan in Success-WDD\n\nBURKE, Dr.: located in the village (Walsingford Parva) rather than the town of Walsingford, where there are several other doctors.\n\nBUTLER to Sir Mallaby Marlowe: Omitted in TMM.\n\nBUTTERWORTH, Charles (1896–1946): American stage and film actor, usually in comedies and musicals\n\nCAGNEY, James (1899–1986): American stage and film actor/dancer, best known for tough-guy film roles\n\nCAHN: Mistake in this volume; Strand-BTG spells it Cohn as usual for Goble’s partner.\n\nCAIN’S STOREHOUSE: a theatrical warehouse on Eleventh Avenue, Manhattan, where scenery, costumes, and props from shows no longer running were stored for revival or resale.\n\nCALLAGHAN, Mr: Mistaken entry; it is the alias given to Smithy by Jill Willard as she takes dictation from him.\n\nCALLENDER, George Barnert (not Barnett)\n\nCAPTAIN COE’S FINAL SELECTION: “Captain Coe” was the pseudonym of the sporting editor of The Sketch, who included tips on horses he thought likely to run well.\n\nCARLISLE, Gertrude: add cross-reference to Vol. 5\n\nCARLISLE, Gordon: add cross-reference to Vol. 5\n\nCARPENTIER, Georges (1894–1975): French boxer; his bout with Jack Dempsey was July 2, 1921, in Jersey City, NJ.

In two places in Grand-JTR ch 7 and TLW ch 3 he is called Sir Portwood Chester, after several references to Sir Chester Portwood (q.v.) in the previous chapter. JTR and Colliers-TLW do not have this misprint.\n\nCHIDERDOSS, Doss: add cross-reference to Volume 7.\n\nCHICAGO DICK: add cross-reference to Dick the Snatcher\n\nCHINGACHGOOK: add cross-references to Volumes 5, 6, 7.\n\nCICERO: Chicago suburb whose city government was controlled by Al Capone during Prohibition, giving him a foothold beyond the reach of Chicago police.\n\nCIRO’S: West Hollywood nightclub at 8433 Sunset Boulevard; opened 1940, closed 1957.\n\nCLUTTERBUCK, J Russell: add cross-reference to Volume 2.\n\nCOHN, Jacob: misspelled Kohn in ch 1 of most versions of TAS, correct in ch 1 of American book MOS, and correct in ch 14 of both books and the equivalent spot in all four serials.\n\nCOLLIER, Willie: William Collier Sr. (born William Morenus, 1864–1944), American stage and film actor, writer, director\n\nCOLNEY HATCH: London neighborhood, site of Colney Hatch Lunatic Asylum (1851–1993, renamed Colney Hatch Mental Hospital in 1930 and Friern Mental Hospital in 1937)\n\nCONSUL, THE ALMOST HUMAN: Omitted in TMM; add cross-reference to Volume 1.\n\nCOOLEY, Joey: change “fourteen” to “twelve” (see ch 8)\n\nCORK, Christopher Robin: Another of PGW’s little digs at A. A. Milne, who believed the worst about him based on the Berlin radio broadcasts.\n\nCORK, Smedley: change “twenty-five” to “twenty” (mentioned twice, near the end of ch 1)\n\nCOURTNEIDGE: Robert Courtneidge (1859–1939), British actor, producer, and playwright.\n\nCREOSOTE: malaprop for Crœsus, legendarily wealthy king (q.v.)\n\nCRUSOE, Robinson: Omitted in TMM.\n\nCUPID OR MAMMON: Add citation of TMM ch 14.\n\nDALY: Thomas Daniel Daly (1891–1946) was a catcher for the Chicago White Sox 1913–15.\n\nDANGERS OF DIANA, The: Add citation of TMM ch 12.\n\nDEAR ABBY: see these notes for Volume 7.\n\nDEMPSEY, Jack: Add citation of TMM ch 16.\n\nd’ESCRIGNON, Jefferson, Comte: Delete “eldest”; no other son is mentioned.

In Pearsons-LAG and ThisWeek-LAG George2 praises Eddie’s pancakes.\n\nEGGLESTON, Blair: add, after “if you ignore”, “side-whiskers and”\n\nEGGSHAW, Wibblesley: Add citation of TMM ch 9.\n\nELAINE: Mistaken entry, or at least too jokey to be understood properly; Yvonne’s sister Elaine was sent to Camelot, ostensibly to ask for protection against a wild unicorn; in reality to snare a husband, catching Sir Malibran of Devon.\n\nELECTRIC BOND & SHARE traded as high as 186¾ on September 3, 1929, but dropped to a low of 50¼ on November 13, 1929.\n\nELPHINSTONE, Hildebrand: named Joseph in PicRev-DOH.\n\nELPHINSTONE, Mrs: change “brother” to “sister” for all versions; in PicRev-DOH Rayner’s name is Billy and her son’s name is Joseph.\n\nELSIE DINSMORE: A series of 28 novels by Martha Finley (1828–1909) beginning with Elsie Dinsmore (1867) and continuing through 1905; the popular series dealt with a young woman’s relationships to her extended family over the course of her life and with her religious faith. Here, an illustration of how the Hollywood purity drive affected Mae West’s character portrayals. Replaced by Alice in Wonderland in LAG, USLAG.\n\nEVANS, Chick (Charles E. Evans, Jr., 1890–1979): American amateur golfer; won US Open and US Amateur titles in 1916.\n\nFATE: Omitted in TMM.\n\nFILM FANCIES: the joke here is that Clark Gable’s character in It Happened One Night (1934) took off his shirt to reveal that he was wearing no undershirt (undervest); rumor has it that in real life, the sale of men’s undershirts dropped off significantly.\n\nFLETCHERIZE: to chew thoroughly, following the precepts of American food reformer Horace Fletcher (1849–1919); he advocated chewing each mouthful until it was entirely reduced to a finely divided mass mixed well with saliva.\n\nFLIP-FLAP: an amusement ride with a pair of giant steel-girdered arms which raised viewing platforms high in the air, not at Luna Park (three thousand miles away near New York) but at the White City, London, the amusement-park portion left over from the Franco-British Exhibition of 1908. (Strand-WDD, TMU-WDD) Cf. the Steeplechase at Luna Park, Coney Island, in Success-WDD.\n\nFLORADORA: Should be spelled FLORODORA; correctly spelled in Wodehouse. In this popular English musical comedy of the turn of the century, an ensemble of six “English Girls” sang and danced “Tell Me, Pretty Maiden” with six men. The number was a great hit and so were the girls. During the two years the show ran in New York many of the actresses left the show to be married to wealthy men; rumor has it that seventy young ladies appeared in these six rôles from 1900 to 1902.\n\nFLOWER, Teddy: In LAG Joey Cooley is twelve, but that passage is not in the shorter magazine versions. I have not been able to locate confirmation of Teddy’s age, given as fourteen in this volume.\n\nFOOTPATHS OF FATE: Add citation of TMM ch 15.\n\nFREDDIE: identifies the source of the tin-foil projectiles, but the only hats knocked off are Lord Plumpton’s and Jimmy’s.\n\nGABLE, William Clark: see above note under Film Fancies.\n\nGARDEN OF THE HESPERIDES: a disguised reference to the Garden of Allah (or Alla), a Hollywood bungalow complex developed by actress Alla Nazimova around a swimming pool supposedly shaped like the Black Sea.\n\nGEORGE2: more accurately, “who suggested to RH(TF) that eggs might come before the pancakes, which, cooked by Eddie, had to be chewed to be believed; and who helped RH(JC) to pancakes.” In LAG and USLAG he dreams up the scenario about Public Enemy Number 13 and casts it as specified here; in Pearson-LAG and ThisWeek-LAG, the scenario is Fred’s and no actors are mentioned.\n\nGIBBONS, Stanley: Edward Stanley Gibbons (1840–1913), stamp collector and dealer, founder of Stanley Gibbons Ltd, publishers of stamp catalogues and magazines.\n\nGLEASON, May: change “Cosmopolitan” to “Cosmopolis”\n\nGOBLE: change “Cahn” to “Cohn”\n\nGOBLE & CAHN: delete this entry and transfer citation of Strand-BTG to GOBLE & COHN. “Cahn” never is used anywhere. The only confusion is with Kohn, used in ch 1 of many editions of TAS even though Cohn is used later in the story (see COHN for details).\n\nGREEN, Hetty (1834–1916): American investor nicknamed “the Witch of Wall Street”; known as the richest woman in America during the Gilded Age\n\nGROSSMAN, Ike: add citation of Macleans-MOS\n\nGRUNDY, Mrs: from a character in Thomas Morton’s Speed the Plough (1798), a generic name for an overly prudish or priggish figure, shocked by any deviation from social propriety.\n\nGUNTON-CRESSWELL, Mr and Mrs: address No. 5, Kensington Lane, W.\n\nGUSTAVE: add cross-reference to Philippe, this volume.\n\nHALE, Beatrice Forbes-Robertson (1883–1967): English actress, author, suffragist\n\nHAVERSHOT, second Earl of: There is no evidence that our Reggie inherited his title from his father, and every reason to believe otherwise. In LAG ch. 1, Reggie had expected that R. J. P. Swithin would be the name eventually carved on his tombstone, but uncles and cousins called it a day and handed in their spades and buckets, and he succeeded to the title. So this entry should be renamed SWITHIN, Mr, father of Reggie Havershot, and described as most likely the younger brother of the second Earl; that would be consistent, too, with his Army career, which was one of the traditional destinies of younger sons of the peerage.\n\nHAVERSHOT, third Earl of (“Reggie”): In LAG ch 2 he tells April June that he has not yet taken up residence at Biddleford Castle. He is 27 during the events of the story (ch 21); has reached 28 by the time he gets around to writing it down (ch 1).\n\nHAYS, Mr.: Will Hays (1879–1954): first chairman of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, best known as the enforcer of the Production Code, the industry’s self-censorship arm to avoid government censorship\n\nHEAD CLERK: To be more accurate and helpful, “Oscar Swenson swam”; add citation to ch 2 where he appears, though he is not specifically identified until ch 3.\n\nHENDERSON, Marion: Her suitors are Captain Bassett and Jean Priaulx.\n\nHENDRIE, Eve: add alternate names from PicRev-DOH: Billy Rayner, Joseph Elphinstone.\n\nHERROLD, Elizabeth: She is not a writer in Strand-BFL.\n\nHICKS THEATRE: at least in 1980 Continuum edition it has no apostrophe.\n\nHIGGS, Herbert: change “Pierce” to “Pierre”\n\nHIGNETT, Adeline: Also cite TMM ch 1,16\n\nHIGNETT, Eustace: Windles will not belong to him until he marries; before then Mrs. Hignett holds it in trust for him. He has a sprained ankle in WHC-TMM and TMM; has mumps in Pan-TMM and GOB.\n\nHILL, Mary: in PicRev-TFD her employer’s name is Peter Rendal.\n\nHILL, Wentworth: “former alumnus” is redundant; change “alumnus” to “student”\n\nHINCKEL: add “Miss”\n\nHOBSON, Mabel: Her peacock-like voice was no detriment to being a Follies showgirl, but no help as the lead of The Primrose Way. Works at the Flower Garden after quitting the play.\n\nHOLLAND HOUSE: New York City hotel, on Fifth Avenue at 30th Street, opened 1892 but not pulled down, as Chris Selby fancies he had heard, but rather was converted to a mercantile building by the 1920s, according to Wikipedia, and is presently a loft building. Google Earth view confirms that the building exterior still looks much as it did in 1893.\n\nHOME WHISPERS: Add citation of TMM ch 11.\n\nHOPKINS, Peggy (born Marguerite Upton, 1893–1957, married Sherburne Hopkins 1913, married J. Stanley Joyce 1920 and thereafter known as Peggy Hopkins Joyce): American showgirl, model, and dancer, notorious for affairs, divorces, wealth, jewels.\n\nHORACE, Cuthbert de la Hay: A friend in England of Archie Moffam, not of the Sausage Chappie. Since Archie says “christened,” these may be only his given names, in which case his surname is unknown.\n\nHORNE, Helena: add cross-reference to Louella Parsons. It is tempting to identify her with Hedda Hopper, who had a Hollywood reputation as a radio gossip commentator and columnist in Motion Picture magazine by 1934, even though her newspaper column, later a rival of Louella’s, had not yet been nationally syndicated when this story was written.\n\nHORROR STORIES: compare the film seen by Miss Postlethwaite in the Mulliner story “A Slice of Life” (see Volume 2)\n\nHORTON, Edward Everett (1886–1970): American character actor\n\nHUDSON, Henry (c.1565–1611): English explorer who in 1609 explored New York harbor and the Hudson River as part of a Dutch East India Company attempt to find a northwest passage to Asia.\n\nISSAWASSI RIVER: This sense of “flower” as something that flows is rare and perhaps confusing here. Passage omitted in TMM.\n\nIVY: Her police escort is Sergeant Herbert Brewster.\n\nJACOB (the one in the Bible): see Genesis, chapter 29, in the Old Testament.\n\nJAMES1: may well be a flight of Packy Franklin’s imagination\n\nJERSEY CITY: cross-reference Liverpool in this volume\n\nJIM, the fiancé of Mae, the narrator of BTG.\n\nJIMMY1: change “tables” to “balcony rail”\n\nJIMMY2: Katie MacFarland brings Jimmy, Ted, and Violet to eat at Mac’s; the next night Jimmy and Ted bring two other girls, and they are sociable with a party of six including Katie.\n\nJOHNSTON OFFICE: Hollywood’s self-censorship agency, the Production Code Administration of the MPPDA (see under Will Hays), renamed the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) soon after Hays retired and Eric Johnston (1896–1963) became president in 1945.\n\nKEELEY CURE INSTITUTE: a chain of treatment centers for alcoholism, founded 1879 by Leslie Keeley (1836–1900)\n\nKEMP, Ginger: did not graduate from Cambridge, but had to leave in his last year upon the death of his father, when it was discovered that his father had more debts than assets.\n\nKERR, Jean (1922–2003): American author and playwright; her 1960 book The Snake Has All the Lines is titled after an anecdote about her son playing Adam in the Garden of Eden in a school play but complaining that all the good lines were in the snake’s part.\n\nKING OF DENMARK: Briefly in American slang around 1910, a catchphrase for someone gullible. It was incorrectly reported that the King of Denmark had decorated Dr. Frederick Cook, Arctic explorer, who claimed to have reached the North Pole in 1908. See the notes to “Archibald’s Benefit” for more.\n\nKITCHENER, Thomas: change “self-effacing” to “self-sufficing”\n\nLARDY, Lord: a character in W. S. Gilbert’s Bab Ballad “Lorenzo de Lardy”\n\nLISS, the Hon. Adelaide: correct the citation to TMU-TTM\n\nLIVERPOOL: cross-reference Jersey City in this volume\n\nLLEWELLYN, Ivor: add cross-reference to Volume 7\n\nLOCHINVAR: What Sam Marlowe calls “just what I’m doing now” is not driving up and down Piccadilly, but absconding with his lady love to prevent her marrying another, as in Sir Walter Scott’s Marmion. Also cite TMM ch 16.\n\nLONGWOOD, John: in PicRev-TFD the broker’s name is Peter Rendal.\n\nMacFARLAND, Andy: Delete “adopted”; he is the son of old Mr. MacFarland. Change “Newhaven” to “New Haven” (location of Yale University); it is correct in Red-ROM.\n\nMacFARLAND, Katie: Delete “dead”; her natural father wasn’t dead when he was a friend. Change “Newhaven” to “New Haven” (location of Yale University); it is correct in Red-ROM.\n\nMacFARLAND, Mr.: a widower who had a son, Andy, and adopted a daughter, Katie. Change “Newhaven” to “New Haven” (location of Yale University); it is correct in Red-ROM.\n\nMACEY’S: Correctly spelled Macy’s in Argosy-CRH.\n\nAdd entry for MAE: narrator of Strand-BTG and Cosmo-FFD, same as NARRATOR3.\n\nMAHAFFEY, Lulabelle: spelled Mahaffy in TOR, USTOR, and Collier’s-PTR. Cf. Volume 2 for Lulubelle Mahaffy in BCE-RMN, Strand-RMN, Amer-SIB.\n\nMALONE: presumably Capt. J. A. E. Malone (died 1928), British director of musicals in London and New York.\n\nMANGOES: Omitted in TMM.\n\nMANNERING, Lady Clara, and...\n\nMANNERING, Egremont: both are omitted in Pearson-LAG and ThisWeek-LAG.\n\nMARGATE: Add citation of TMM ch 9.\n\nMARIE: Another entry too clever for its own good; Marie the Peke bit John Smith on the leg before he left home for wartime service, in which he lost his memory.\n\nMARION HUNTER: bookshop at 352 N. Camden Drive, Beverly Hills (1951 phone book); later at 400 N. Rodeo Drive, Beverly Hills (1956).\n\nMARLOWE, THORPE, PRESCOTT etc.: Also cite TMM ch 9.\n\nMARTYN, Algy: add cross-reference to Volume 7.\n\nMATTHEWSON, Mr “Christy” (1880–1925), pitcher for the New York Giants for 17 seasons 1900–16.\n\nMEADOWES: like Lord Peebles, a character in the novel Miss Sharples is reading.\n\nMEDWAY, Gertie: Unlikely that those two names are actually coupled. We never learn Gum-Shoe Gertie’s maiden name as far as I can tell, but it is unlikely that she would use her own name as a pseudonym when serving as Mrs. Gedge’s maid. Add citation of HOW ch 8.\n\nMEECHER, Mrs: change Floradora to Florodora; change “like” to “unlike”\n\nMERCER, Sidney: change “cuff-fasteners” to “cuff-protectors”\n\nMEREDITH: probably William Henry “Billy” Meredith (1874–1958), Welsh professional Association football forward; the Manchester United web site calls him “United’s first footballing legend, the original ‘Welsh Wizard’.”\n\nMESHACH: see book of Daniel, chapter 3, in the Old Testament\n\nMGM: their production of Trader Horn, released 1931, was notable for the dangers and mishaps of the African expedition to shoot location footage, and the film had to be completed in Hollywood.\n\nMICHIGAN: Irving Berlin’s song “I Want to Go Back to Michigan” (1914). Billy Murray’s 1914 recording is on YouTube.\n\nMIDGLEY, J B: Spelled “Midgeley” in WHC-TMM, Pan-TMM, TMM (misprinted Migdeley on first mention in first US edition), and GOB, so correct the spelling of this entry.\n\nMIKE ROMANOFF’S: Harry F. Gerguson (born Hershel Geguzin in Lithuania, 1890–1971) pretended to be Prince Michael Dmitri Alexandrovich Obolensky-Romanoff, nephew of Czar Nicholas II, and opened upscale restaurants in Beverly Hills popular with the film community; the first, operating 1941–62, was located at 326 N. Rodeo Drive.\n\nMILLER, Johnson: change “producer” to “dance director” and add the fact that he is “almost completely deaf.” This is our cue to identify him with Julian P. Mitchell (c.1854–1926), one of Broadway’s most prolific stage directors and choreographers, also deaf in his later years.\n\nMILLIKEN, Miss: Add citation of TMM ch 9.\n\nMILLS, Henry Wallace: indeed married Minnie Hill a week and a bit after his return, but it was on his first wedding anniversary at supper at Geisenheimer’s that he felt a youngish 21, until he saw his wife dancing with Sidney Mercer and realized that he couldn’t dance, making him feel older than his 35 years.\n\nMILLS, Minnie: In MLF-TLF and USMLF-TLF, her name is misprinted as Hall on first mention but as Hill later in the story. SatEvePost-TLF and Strand-TLF have Hill throughout.\n\nMILTON, Heloise: in Red-BCL the newspaper is the Evening Chronicle; in Strand-BFL Elizabeth Herrold is not a writer at all and the newspaper column is not mentioned.\n\nMINISTRY OF DONS AND LEGS: in FRL, USFRL, and Star-FRL, it is the Ministry de Dons et Legs; in JohnBull-FRL, it is the Ministère de Dons et Legs. So change “OF” to “DE” and “AND” to “ET” in the heading of this entry.\n\nMOCAMBO: nightclub at 8588 Sunset Blvd, Los Angeles (1951 phone book)\n\nMONTGOMERY WARD traded at 137&frac78; on September 3, 1929, but dropped to a low of 49¼ on November 13, 1929.\n\nMORNING’S AT SEVEN: IM notes that Vera pinched the title from a line in Browning’s “Pippa’s Song”; Bertie Wooster picked up a copy in Aunts Aren’t Gentlemen and found it “even less fit for human consumption” than he had expected.\n\nMOUQUIN’S: New York restaurant, opened 1857 at Fulton St and Nassau St in Manhattan; by 1901 there were three branches, at 149 Fulton, 20 Ann, and 454 6th Avenue. Menu.\n\nMURDER AT BILBURY MANOR: The timetable puzzle type of detective story was a specialty of Freeman Wills Crofts (1879–1957); Dorothy L. Sayers also experimented with this genre in The Five Red Herrings (1931).\n\nNARRATOR3: Her name is Mae.\n\nNATCHEZ: the quoted poem is a fragment from Ogden Nash’s “Requiem” from I’m a Stranger Here Myself (1938); instead of “a young lady from” she was “a young belle of old Natchez”.\n\nNIGGER: Of course this wasn’t his name for himself, so in any revision of this book it would seem better to list him as The Mixer. That he was called that, however, suggests that the version of the story in which he is jet-black with a white chest is closer to Wodehouse’s original conception, and that is Red-HMV. Also, “Eighth Avenue saloon” is usually changed to “East-end public-house” in Strand-HMV, but one instance of “saloon” remains unchanged, indicating that Strand is the revised version.\n\nNOAH: Omitted in TMM.\n\nNORTON-SMITH: add “Colonel”\n\nNURONIA: Probably a disguised reference to the Caronia, a Cunard Atlantic liner from 1904 to 1932. Add citation of TMM ch 16.\n\nODDY’S: Popular name for Oddenino’s Restaurant, 54–62 Regent Street, London, founded by Auguste Oddenino in 1880 and remaining in business until 1946.\n\nOKLAHOMA: Because it comes at the end of an interrogatory sentence in the book, just before the question mark, Wodehouse leaves off the exclamation point which is part of the official title of the musical Oklahoma!\n\nOLD HUMMUMS: Norman Murphy identifies this (A Wodehouse Handbook) as a hotel on the southeast corner of Covent Garden, demolished in the 1930s, which stood on the site of England’s first Turkish baths (hummums or hammams).\n\nOMAR THE TENT-MAKER: a literal translation of Omar al-Khayyami’s surname; it may have been his father’s trade, but Khayyam was the poet of the Rubaiyat as well as a mathematician and astronomer.\n\nOULED NAÏL should be printed with a diaresis on the I, as here.\n\nOUSELEY v OUSELEY etc.: Omitted in TMM.\n\nPANGLOSS, Dr: optimist in Voltaire’s Candide\n\nPARKER, Ellen and...\n\nPARKER, Horace: add cross-reference to Barker in JTR.\n\nPARSONS, Louella (1881–1972): American journalist, one of the first to cover Hollywood and its personalities in a regular column, syndicated in Hearst newspapers\n\nPATCHOGUE: IM suggests replacing “apartment” with “dog thingamajig” as it is clear that they have begun operating their kennels in the last chapter.\n\nPEACE, Charles (1832–1879): English burglar and murderer\n\nPEKE, unnamed, and its master: Wodehouse himself, with wife and Pekes, lived at 1005 Benedict Canyon Drive from late 1930 through the end of his MGM contract in 1931.\n\nPEOPLE: Omitted in TMM.\n\nPILKINGTON, Otis: lyricist as well as librettist of The Rose of America.\n\nPINK LADY, The: 1911 musical comedy composed by Ivan Caryll, book and lyrics by C. M. S. McLellan; choreographed by Julian P. Mitchell (see above under Johnson Miller); it played in London for a few months in 1912.\n\nPINKY-BOODLES: Billie Bennett’s snappish Peke.\n\nPOE, Edgar Allan: Also cite TMM ch 16.\n\nPOLLYANNA: From the 1913 children’s novel Pollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter, whose title character is an eternal optimist through trying situations, having learned “The Glad Game” from her father, a way to look at the good side of things.\n\nPOLYANNA: Correctly spelled Pollyanna in USTGI.\n\nPRESCOTT, Mabel: change “Scott” to “Stott”; neither Mabel nor any of the other named elements are present in ThisWeek-LAG or Pearson-LAG, including Mr. Prescott, the next entry.\n\nPROSSER, Mr: In TMU-POM he is bearded, a Regius Professor, and a sociologist. In Metropolitan-POM he is a bald attorney, staying at the Frys’ farm in Vermont, dealing with Joe Bentley.\n\nPROSSER, Oofy: Misleading in an attempt to be clever; what made him shirty was Barmy Phipps saying that the pimpled Oofy looked like a spotted dog.\n\nPUBLIC ENEMY NO 13: George indeed dreams up this scenario in LAG and USLAG, but in ThisWeek-LAG and Pearson-LAG the scenario is Fred’s idea. In the 1934 musical Anything Goes, co-scripted by Wodehouse, the gangster Moonface Martin is Public Enemy Number 13.\n\nPYLE, HOMER: IM suggests this name is a takeoff on the television character “Gomer Pyle” played by Jim Nabors on The Andy Griffith Show (1962–69), a humorous contrast between the rural auto mechanic of TV and the New York corporate lawyer, poet, and art collector.\n\nQUIBOLLE, M.: clarify that “he” means Old Nick, not Quibolle.\n\nRACKSTRAW, Daniel1 & 2: Though the entries here are written as if the stories are entirely parallel, one difference must be noted. In Colliers-PAP Rackstraw has directly sold Mr. Van Puyster shares in a dud mine, so has actively caused the ruin of the Van Puysters. (This is parallel to Paul Bond selling mining shares to Mr. Fendall in Pearsons-PRO; see Volume 7.) In Strand-TGP and TMU-TGP old Mr. Trotter tried to corner wheat but was unable to prevail against other traders; only by inference in the closing paragraphs is it suggested that Rackstraw might have been one of Trotter’s trading opponents, so may have been a partial and indirect cause of the ruin of the Runnymede family.\n\nRACKSTRAW, Isabel2: change “another angel” to “a peach”; change “van Puysten” to “van Puyster”.\n\nRASTALL-RETFORD: add “or Billy” after “Peter”; add “or college” after “Cambridge”; add citation to PicRev-DOH.\n\nRECTOR’S (note proper placement of apostrophe): New York restaurant at 44th Street and Broadway, under the direction of George Rector (c.1878–1947) from 1902 until it closed under Prohibition. “A leading resort of the theatrical, financial and social worlds in those days” (Rector’s obit, New York Times 1947-11-27)\n\nREDDY: a training-camp nickname for Ginger Kemp; he’s not so much in disguise as simply unknown to the boxing world.\n\nRHEUMATISM: change “application” to “taking”; it is a chemical relative of aspirin, and for humans, dosages similar to aspirin are recommended. A standard aspirin tablet is five grains=325 mg, so he is recommending the rough equivalent of two to four aspirin tablets three times a day. If Percy is a big male bulldog of 55 lb (25 kg), the currently recommended dose of 30 mg/kg every eight hours would be 750 mg, or 2.3 standard aspirins, so the lower end of Archie’s prescription is probably best. Higher doses can cause vomiting and stomach ulceration.\n\nRICE, Henry Pifield: In Strand-BTB the street name is correctly given as Guilford St. The UK first edition misspelled it as Guildford, presumably from a mistaken identification with the name of the Surrey town where Wodehouse was born.\n\nRIGGS, P. C.: Omitted in TMM.\n\nRINGWOOD, Marion: change “Algy” to “Algie”.\n\nRITZ HOTEL: in New York, in full the Ritz-Carlton Hotel at 46th Street and Madison Avenue, opened 1911, demolished 1951; Archie Moffam knows he can get a good bite to eat there. (Strand-MMH)\n\nROBERTS, Lord: Field Marshal Frederick Sleigh Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts (1832–1914), one of the most successful British commanders of the 19th century. “There is a strong physical antipathy in Lord Roberts—it is more than a prejudice or a dislike. . . Lord Roberts cannot bear cats.” (biography, 1901, by J. M. Cobban)\n\nROCHE, Sir Boyle: (1736–1807), Member (1775–1801) of the Irish House of Commons, famous for mixed metaphors and malapropisms, such as the “smelt a rat . . . saw it floating” quoted in The Intrusion of Jimmy. One 1887 compilation of sayings has this:\n\nWhen some one said that the sergeant-at-arms should have stopped a man in the rear of the house when he was trying to catch him in front, Roche asked, “Did he think the sergeant-at-arms could be, like a bird, in two places at once?”\n\nROCKMETTELLER, Mrs Balderstone: The original spelling is no doubt correct since Wodehouse uses it several other places as a rhyming substitute for “Rockefeller”: Bream R. in UND and PLP-LWF (Volume 5); Cora Rita R., widow of Sigsbee R., in RFJ/ROJ, and Isabel R. and R. Todd in COJ-ASL (Volume 6); also in The Globe By the Way Book (Sadie Rockmeteller of Onehorseville, Nebraska, U.S.A.). See John Dawson’s notes on that book for a source where Wodehouse could have found Bream Rockmetteller.\n\nROCKMETTLER: “a typographical error for the above” instead of “a later spelling”\n\nRODERICK THE RUNT: a renaming of Sir Agravaine from TMU-SAG, the early version of this story\n\nROLLO: Since Wally Mason also calls him Augustus, it is not clear that Wally really knows his actual name.\n\nROMERO, Caesar: Printed thus in USSPF, as Cæsar in SPF, but the actor Cesar Julio Romero Jr. (1907–1994) spelled it in the Spanish manner, as his Barcelona-born father did. He played Latin lovers, dancers, and villains in Hollywood from the 1930s on, and had an active television career from the 1950s on, including the Joker in the 1960s Batman series.\n\nROSENBLOOM, Maxie (1907–1976): American boxer (world light-heavyweight champion 1932–34, retired 1939); actor in films (1936–69) and television actor and celebrity (1951–68).\n\nRÖSSELMANN: A character in Schiller’s play William Tell, a priest of Uri.\n\nROSSITERS: the son of the family was supposed to be impersonated by Roland Winter; Stanwood Cobbold later tries the impersonation.\n\nROUNDER: OED has citations from America dating back to 1854 in the sense of one who makes the rounds of the bars, a habitual drunkard; so the 1915 film was using a well-known term in its title; OED also has it used in 1962 and 2002.\n\nROVILLE-SUR-MER: Its location is a little unclear; in TMU-RIE and TMU-TTM it is close to Monte Carlo. FRL has it on the English Channel, but it has a Promenade des Anglais which in real life is in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast.\n\nRUODI: A character in Schiller’s play William Tell, a fisherman of Uri.\n\nRUPERT STREET RIFLE RANGE: Add citation of TMM ch 9.\n\nST ANDREWS: Also cite TMM ch 16.\n\nSANTA BARBARA WHIRLWIND: In the absence of One-Round Smith, Lord Freddie Bowen is announced in Strand-JOW as “Jimmy Smith, the Santa Barbara Whirlwind,” brother of One-Round. Even though it is Freddie’s first professional fight, supposedly Jimmy is the winner of 47 battles. The same is true of Freddie Bingham in Collier’s-JOW.\n\nSAPPHIRA: See Acts of the Apostles, chapter 5, in the New Testament.\n\nSARTINES, Paul: add cross-reference to Snyder Wilberforce, this volume\n\nSAVOY GRILL: change “Vanrigham” to “Vanringham”\n\nSCHENK, Nick: In real life, Nicholas M. Schenck (1881–1969), partner of Marcus Loew in amusement parks and theater chains; after Loew’s death in 1927, head of Loew’s Incorporated, which owned the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios.\n\nSCULLERY-MAID: Add citation of TMM ch 14.\n\nSEPPI: A character in Schiller’s play William Tell, a herdsman’s boy\n\nSHADRACH: See chapter 3 of the Book of Daniel in the Old Testament.\n\nSHAW, Artie (Arthur Arshawsky, 1910–2004): American bandleader, clarinetist, songwriter/composer; by 1950 he had been married six times (each ending in divorce or annulment), and would marry twice more in later years.\n\nSHAW, Minnie: not a character, but a mishearing of “miniature”; IM suggests it is “probably a complete coincidence, but was also the name of a Broadway chorus girl during Wodehouse’s Broadway days.”\n\nSHEPPHERD, Audrey: her surname is spelled Shepperd in Strand-POM and Metropolitan-POM; in Metropolitan-POM her boyfriend is Joe Bentley.\n\nSHEPPHERD, Mr.: In Strand-POM he is Mr. Shepperd; in Metropolitan-POM he is Edward Shepperd.\n\nSHERRIFF, Roscoe: add cross-reference to Volume 7.\n\nSHERWOOD, Robert E: 6′8″ tall, very thin, which explains “meridian of longitude”.\n\nSHORTLANDS, Claude etc., fifth Earl of: the family finances are subsidized by daughter Adela, husband of the wealthy Desborough Topping.\n\nSHROPSHIRE, Dowager Duchess of: change “Algy” to “Algie”.\n\nSIMMONS, John: Omitted in TMM.\n\nSIR AGRAVAINE THE DOLOROUS: add cross-reference to Roderick the Runt, this volume.\n\nSMITH1: Add citation of GOB ch 15,17; TMM ch 8,14,16.\n\nSMITH, Gunboat (Edward Smith, 1887–1974): Irish-American heavyweight boxer, film actor, boxing referee\n\nSMITH, Jimmy: Also the pseudonym of Freddie Bingham in similar circumstances in PicRev-PAW.\n\nSMITH, John [Lancelot Tracy]: I’ve bracketed the second and third names as conjectural and indeed unlikely. The Sausage Chappie’s wife calls him “John!” He replies “So it is! And I thought it was Lancelot.” So he seems to reject that earlier speculation. The only Tracy mentioned in the chapter is Archie’s own middle name, with nothing to connect it to John Smith.\n\nSPERRY, Harry: change “Harry” to “Harold”; a real-life person mentioned in news reports datelined October–November 1910, for instance Bryan (TX) Daily Eagle, October 20, 1910.\n\nSTAUFFACHER, Werner: In the traditional account of the founding of Switzerland, he is one of the three swearers of the oath of confederation, circa 1300.\n\nSTEINBURG, Carl: the crucial fact omitted here is that he is a concert impresario.\n\nSTEPTOE, Mabel: change “sister” to “sister-in-law”\n\nSTONE, Marcus (1840–1921): English painter and illustrator, often choosing historical or sentimental subjects\n\nSTOTT, Sister Lora Luella: She and the whole Temple of the New Dawn subplot are missing in the shorter ThisWeek-LAG and Pearson-LAG versions.\n\nSTOTTLEMEYER, Duane: IM suggests that it is no coincidence that this name and the Stottlemeyer mentioned by Lord Emsworth in A Pelican at Blandings as an unusual American name both appeared in print at a time when Mel Stottlemeyer was in the headlines as the ace of the New York Yankees’ pitching staff.\n\nSUNDAY, Billy (1862–1935): American baseball player, later well-known evangelist and Prohibition advocate. (Original of “Jimmy Mundy” in Volume 6)\n\nSUSAN: Add citation of TMM ch 14. Omitted in WHC-TMM.\n\nTAILORED WOMAN: IM contributes this: Now long defunct, it was located at 57th Street and 5th Avenue in the heart of New York’s shopping district and promoted itself as the home of “good style, good lines, good quality, and quiet colors.” It seems quite likely Wodehouse would have had personal knowledge of this store as it sounds like the type of place Ethel would have patronized while they were living a short cab ride away at 1000 Park Avenue in the early 1950s.\n\nTANNER, Sir Godfrey: change “butler” to “manservant”\n\nTEMPLE OF THE NEW DAWN: The entire Temple subplot and its characters are omitted in the shorter ThisWeek-LAG and Pearson-LAG versions of the story.\n\nTEMPLETON, Marie: revise: “knew to be burdened with a son already in the profession, playing heavy parts on tour, married, with two children of his own.” [The name may possibly have been suggested by Marie Tempest (1864–1942), English soprano in light opera and musical comedy.]\n\nTETRAZZINI, Luisa (1871–1940): Italian coloratura soprano, active in Europe and America 1890s–1920s. IM notes: “Like Mme. Brudowska, she knew the publicity value of being photographed with an exotic pet – a baby jaguar accompanied her on a South American tour. Spelled Tettrazina in the UK book The Adventures of Sally, Tettrazini in the UK magazine serial, and correctly as Tetrazzini in both the Canadian and American serials.”\n\nTHREE MEN AND A MAID: In fact, much less time is spent in TMM on the Jane Hubbard–Eustace Hignett romance. Other condensations occur in the central chapters, where Eustace visits Sam at Bingley-on-the-Sea to summarize the initial disagreements at Windles, and where Mr. Bennett’s attempted swim is omitted. Chapters 8–10 of TMM are much altered from Chapters 8–11 of GOB. After that, ch 11 of TMM is roughly equivalent to ch 12 of GOB, and so forth until final ch 16 of TMM or ch 17 of GOB, in which Eustace is bedridden with a broken ankle (TMM) rather than mumps (GOB).\n\nTINNEY, Frank (1878–1940): American blackface comedian and actor. It was Sam Marlowe who imitated him at a Trinity smoker and Eustace who provided the piano accompaniment, and the pair attempt a revival at the ship’s concert in ch. 6.\n\nTOOTS: IM suggests adding a second entry, cross-referencing Abbott, Lady Alice.\n\nTRAÜMEREI: Not a composer, but a piece (“Reverie” or “Daydreaming” in English) by Robert Schumann (1810–1856), from his 1838 collection of piano pieces Kinderszenen (Scenes from Childhood); several arrangements by others for other instruments and for band and orchestra were popular.\n\nTRAVIS, Walter J. (1862–1927): American amateur golfer (US Amateur champion 1900, 1901, 1903; British Amateur 1904) and author, teacher, and golf course designer\n\nTREACHER, Arthur (1894–1975): English film and stage actor, active in Hollywood, on Broadway, and on American television.\n\nTREES: a 1922 musical setting by Oscar Rasbach of the 1913 Joyce Kilmer poem (“I think that I shall never see / A poem lovely as a tree.”)\n\nTRENT, Edgar: In USFRL the total proceeds are $9,000.\n\nTRESSILIAN, Reginald: Not really a ghostwriter, as he gets “as told to” credit for putting Dame Flora Faye’s Theatre Memories into book form.\n\nTREVOR, Milly: change “wandering” to “wondering”\n\nTRIMBLETT, Miss: Mentioned but not described as Billie’s maid in Pan-TMM. Omitted in WHC-TMM and TMM.\n\nTRUE AS STEEL: Also cite TMM ch 15.\n\nTWIN-SIX COMPLEX: Also cite TMM ch 16.\n\nTWO-GUN THOMAS: Also cite TMM ch 9,12.\n\nULRIC THE SMITH: In Schiller’s play William Tell, Ulrich is a smith of Schwitz.\n\nUNFAIR EXCHANGES, the first: Also cite TMM ch 13.\n\nVAN DER WATER, Virginia Terhune: A mistake on Wodehouse’s part; her real surname was Van de Water (1865–1945). Author, daughter of author Mary Virginia Terhune, sister of authors Christine Terhune Terrick and Albert Payson Terhune.\n\nVEUVE FIFTY-ONE: Spelled out in books. Short for Veuve Clicquot champagne, vintage 1951.\n\nVINCE, George: also has this name in Strand-RIE.\n\nVON DER FLUE, Klaus: A character in Schiller’s play William Tell, an inhabitant of Unterwalden, but not a chimney sweep; this is Wodehouse’s pun on “flue”.\n\nWAGNER, Hans: better known today as Honus Wagner (1874–1955), the star of the 1909 World Series for the Pittsburgh Pirates, outbatting Ty Cobb of the Detroit Tigers by .333 to .231, and stealing six bases, a Series record. He was christened Johannes Peter Wagner by his German-born parents, and his family nickname of Hans was sometimes used during his professional career. By the way, “Honus” should be pronounced “honn-us” not “hone-us”; it’s just an Americanized spelling of the last two syllables in the German name “Johannes”.\n\nWALPOLE STREET: Wodehouse himself took a room at 23 Walpole Street in 1901 and it remained his London address until 1908.\n\nWALTON HEATH: Add citation to GOB ch 17 and TMM ch 10, 16.\n\nWARNER BROTHERS: There were originally four: Harry (1881–1958), Albert (1884–1967), Sam (1887–1927), and Jack (1892–1978); at the time of Ellery-MBD (1950) there were only three.\n\nWASHBURN, Bryant: add cross-reference to Adonis Bryant.\n\nAdd entry: Mr. WATKINS of Seattle: a disguised reference to the ubiquitous advertisements for the Roth Memory Course, in which Mr. Addison Sims of Seattle is the well-remembered person met once long ago. See one such advertisement. (Cosmo-SCH, IOA ch 20)\n\nWAUKEESY SHOE, the: Wodehouse usually misspells the name of the real-life Waukeezi Shoe Company of Northampton, England; I have found advertisements from 1906 to 1956.\n\nWEBSTER, Montagu: Also cite TMM ch 10,14,15.\n\nWEILER, Jost: Named Jost von Weiler in Schiller’s play William Tell, an inhabitant of Schwitz.\n\nWELSH, Arthur: His troubles were over Maud Peters, manicurist at his barbershop, and her friendly attentions to her male clients.\n\nWERNI: A character in Schiller’s play William Tell, a hunter of Uri.\n\nWESTON, Alice: The play is The Girl from Brighton in MLF-BTB, MTL-BTB, and Strand-BTB; only in Century-BTB is it The Girl from Broadway.\n\nWESTWARD HO: Also cite TMM ch 16.\n\nWHALEN, Grover (1886–1962): New York City politician and public relations expert, at various times in charge of city transportation, reception of distinguished visitors, and the 1939 New York World’s Fair.\n\nWHITE CITY: see under Flip-Flap above in these notes.\n\nWHITTAKER, Prudence: replace “only in embarrassment” with “only in a towel and a Union Jack”\n\nWIDGEON, Joe: change “hocum” to “hokum”\n\nWIGGLE-WOGGLE: an amusement ride at the White City, London, not at Luna Park, Coney Island, L.I. Another image.\n\nWILBERFORCE, Prof. Snyder: change “Algy” to “Algie”.\n\nWILDERSHAM, Lord: change “Algy” to “Algie”.\n\nWILLIAMS, Bert (1874–1922): Bahamian-born American vaudeville entertainer, film actor, and recording artist; W. C. Fields called him “the funniest man I ever saw—and the saddest man I ever knew.” Of mostly African ancestry, he nevertheless usually performed in blackface makeup in part to conceal his lighter skin tones, and in part as a mockery of white performers’ blackface routines.\n\nWINCHELL, Walter (1897–1972): American journalist, gossip columnist, radio commentator\n\nWYCHERLY, Amanda or Pomona: Name is reminiscent of Alma Whitaker, the Los Angeles Times reporter who interviewed Wodehouse in 1931 and reported his bemusement over his high salary in Hollywood.\n\nX-RAY EYES: Also cite TMM ch 14.\n\nYONKERS: for those who want information more than just a précis of a Wodehouse joke, Yonkers is a suburb of New York City, just up the Hudson River from Manhattan in Westchester county, which in 1898 rejected the annexation which added Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island to New York City. Though increasingly urbanized after its railroad connection to Manhattan in 1888, it still had a popular reputation as an unsophisticated semi-rural area.\n\nYSEULT: a misleadingly jokey entry; Yvonne’s beautiful sister Yseult was sent to Camelot ostensibly to ask for protection against a giant with three heads; Sir Sagramore came and married Yseult.\n\nZANUCK, Darryl F. (1902–1979): began as a scenarist for silent films, moving up to management at Warner Brothers, where he was head of production 1931–33, then left to form Twentieth Century Pictures, which merged with Fox in 1935; Vice-President of Production at 20th C.-Fox until becoming an independent producer in 1956.\n\nZIZZBAUM, I. J.: Ann Bannister is his receptionist only in the magazine versions ThisWeek-LAG and Pearson-LAG.\n\nBack to Menu"
