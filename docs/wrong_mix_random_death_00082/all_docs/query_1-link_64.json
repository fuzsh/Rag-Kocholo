        "text": "Pure Operetta continued to get made throughout this period, but it almost invariably flopped, as audiences had lost almost all patience with its more dated conventions. Song of Norway, a musically lush but dramatically vacuous Grieg pasticcio in the Blossom Time vein seems to have fluked its way into success in the Forties, despite having virtually no story. Grieg was no doubt a wonderful composer, but he was not a great biographical subject for a musical, having led a decidedly undramatic life. This forced the musical to make up some frivolous plot about a love triangle between Grieg, his eventual wife, and a temperamental Opera singer who tries to manipulate him into selling out.\n\nThe show was essentially carried by second-tier Opera star Irra Patina’s performance as the villainous Opera diva, some wonderful choreography by the great George Balanchine, and above all the glorious score. “I Love You” was taken directly from Grieg’s famous love song of the same title, and his ultra-famous Piano Concerto was used whole-cloth for the final ballet, but the rest of the score was heavily adapted by the team of Robert Wright and George Forrest. By developing themes and adding quite a bit of their own music to Grieg’s melodies, Wright and Forrest transformed Grieg’s instrumental music into such ravishing vocal songs as the haunting musical fairy-tale “The Legend”, the rhapsodic trio “Hill of Dreams”, the tempestuous “Now”, the sprightly “Freddy and His Fiddle” and “Bon Vivant”, and the glorious first-act finale “Hymn of Betrothal”. They even created a massive hit ballad, “Strange Music”, supposedly created by some complicated process of extracting notes from a Grieg composition but to all intents and purposes a Wright and Forrest original.\n\nStill, the show’s success is an anomaly, given that other Operettas with equally fine scores flopped around this time, and it’s worth noting that no-one ever revives it these days. Even the movie version was an utter trainwreck, and while it was certainly poorly adapted, with the music in particular being butchered, its incompetent storytelling and cloying sentimentality were largely inherited from its source.\n\nBut apart from that one anomaly, there are really only two Operetta success stories to speak of in this period, and neither is exactly a traditional example of the genre model. One is Kismet, which tried to modernize the operetta model with broad comedy and open sensuality. The book is hardly a paragon of sophistication…it’s pretty much an old-school burlesque comedy set in Arabian Nights-era Baghdad, and when performed today it comes off as rather dated and tiresome. Still, it features some decent laughs in places, and is a sizeable improvement on the stilted, overly earnest books that most previous operettas featured.\n\nThe show’s real draw, and what has helped it stick around and become pretty much the most successful American Operetta of all time, is its utterly ravishing score. Adapted from the music of Alexander Borodin by the aforementioned team of Wright and Forrest, it has ironically become far more famous than any of Borodin’s actual compositions, producing at least four enduring standards: the haunting opening, “Sands of Time”, the rhapsodic love duet “Stranger in Paradise”, the lyrical ‘Jewel Song’ “Baubles, Bangles and Beads”, and the exquisitely delicate quartet “And This Is My Beloved”. But those songs, fine as they are, are still exactly the kind of material one expects from an Operetta; the groundbreaking nature of the show is really displayed in earthier numbers like the explosively sexy showstoppers for belting Prima Donna Lalume, “Not Since Ninevah” and “Rahadlakum”, or the evil Wazir’s genuinely witty villain song “Was I Wazir? I Was!”.\n\nThe other great subversion of the Operetta model in this era, which was a commercial failure at the time but has succeeded impressively in revivals, is Leonard Bernstein’s career showpiece Candide. Based more on European comic Operetta than the romantic fantasies favored in America, it resembled to a certain extent a far more ambitious version of an Offenbach Opéra Bouffe. With Bernstein’s glorious score and dazzling lyrics by a large stable of the Twentieth-Century American intelligentsia, it is probably the best of all American Operettas from an artistic perspective, in spite of its obvious, gaping problem that has never really been successfully fixed.\n\nThat problem is that Voltaire’s novel is a dry, cerebral, deliberately shocking fable acted out by stock characters, a sort of intellectual cartoon, and is not remotely suited to be a Musical. The creators gave it their best shot, and they definitely broke some impressive ground in finding music where no music would seem to be possible, particularly in a brilliant musical scene depicting an Auto-de-fe, and in two separate songs about the supposed upside of syphilis, one creepily beautiful (“Dear Boy”) and one blackly comic (“Ringaroundarosy”).\n\nBut even if Bernstein and his collaborators had stuck to pure satire, like a lighter version of Brecht’s Musical works, the sheer density of Voltaire’s content would have made it extremely difficult. Compounding this initial problem, Bernstein, apparently unable to resist including some lyrical melodies, wrote several numbers obviously designed to make you feel for these characters, and however glorious the music, it just doesn’t work. Adding emotional moments like “It Must Be So”, “The Ballad of Eldorado”, “Nothing More Than This”, and the epic final ensemble, “Make Our Garden Grow” mostly just served to confuse the audience, since outside of these numbers the characters tended to act exactly like the caricatures they were portrayed as in the original novel. Apparently Bernstein and original librettist Lillian Hellman saw the novel’s invocation of the Spanish Inquisition for one sequence as an opportunity to take on McCarthyism, but the honest truth is that they wasted some of the best theatrical music and lyrics of all time on what was, quite frankly, a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nGranted, Cole Porter’s Kiss Me Kate does resemble a kind of comic Operetta with its Shakespearean source material and lush romantic music, but these elements are blended heavily with the Musical Comedy tropes of Porter’s early years, in effect creating an Operetta/Musical Comedy fusion very different from the one found in the Rodgers and Hammerstein-style Musical Play.\n\nThe show is an archetypical retelling of Shakespeare’s classic farce The Taming of the Shrew, told through a ferocious duel of passions between two ex-lovers who are in the process of performing in a musical production of the original play. This was probably a wiser idea than trying to do a straightforward adaptation, since the gender politics of Shakespeare’s play were uncomfortably dated even by 1940s standards. Unfortunately, the show’s book really has no more dramatic integrity than Porter’s Musical Comedies from the Twenties and Thirties. The song cues are often completely unmotivated, and there are several blatantly extraneous characters who exist for no other reason than to deliver musical numbers. The show takes every opportunity it can to recite passages of Shakespeare’s dialogue word for word, probably because this gloss on the original plot isn’t really substantial enough to fill out a two-hour show on its own and the play-within-a-play scenes are a convenient source of filler.\n\nHowever, despite all these flaws, the show still managed to attain the ranks of the top-level theater classics. It’s almost impossible for a Broadway Musical’s score to overpower a book this inadequate, but this one manages it. Some of the music sounds virtually indistinguishable from what one might hear in a traditional Operetta, such as the mock-Viennese waltz of “Wunderbar” or the breathtaking romantic ballad “So in Love”. Much of the material for the play-within-a-play even attempts a period-appropriate Elizabethan sound, particularly Petruchio’s three big solos “I’ve Come to Wive It Wealthily in Padua”, “Were Thine That Special Face?”, and “Where Is the Life That Late I Led?”, and Katherina’s ferociously trilling credo “I Hate Men”. On the other hand, several of the songs are pure Jazz, such as “Tom, Dick or Harry”, “Too Darn Hot”, and “Always True to You, Darling (In My Fashion)”.\n\nMost of the score sticks to Porter’s standard formulas: comedic list songs, lush, sensuous ballads, hot Jazz showstoppers, and lots of highly risqué double-entendres (“Tom, Dick or Harry” actually got away with repeatedly using the word “dick” in what is clearly meant to be its modern context). The show’s most innovative moment was a highly original number, “Brush Up Your Shakespeare”, that managed to transform deliberate awfulness into comedy gold. This may have been the first prominent use of intentional camp on Broadway, and it would prove to have immense influence on everything from the “Baby June” numbers in Gypsy to such deliberately campy musicals as The Rocky Horror Show.\n\nBut overall, Porter had done almost everything he does in this score before, and usually just as well or even better. What made the show special is how much of that quality was now concentrated in one place. Porter has a reputation for consistent genius among those who only know him from his hits, but most of his theater scores are actually quite uneven. Nearly all of his Thirties shows, as well as his last two hits, Can-Can and Silk Stockings, consist of a handful of sublime hits surrounded by a lot of pleasant-but-undistinguished musical filler. Even Anything Goes, before it was padded out with interpolations, had plenty of just-okay material in its original incarnation. The real thing that made Kiss Me, Kate different from earlier Porter was not any breakthrough in dramatic cohesion but the sheer consistency and quality control of the show’s score.\n\nBut even if Kiss Me, Kate’s Operetta leanings were given a pass because of that score, it’s worth remembering what happened to Porter’s follow-up work in the same vein, Out of This World. Despite having a score that very nearly matched Kiss Me, Kate’s in terms of brilliance and consistency, the show flopped because of a dated book and presentation…exactly the problem that was killing Operetta in general. The Girl in Pink Tights, a variation on the pasticcio formula developed out of an unfinished posthumous score by Sigmund Romberg, also tried to modernize Operetta but proved not to be modern enough for Broadway audiences. Neither did two more vehicles for Kismet star Alfred Drake. The first, Kean, was an attempt to make another intellectual Operetta in the Candide vein (this time based on Sartre rather than Voltaire). The second, Zenda, was a toned-down version of Anthony Hope’s novel The Prisoner of Zenda, which had been a progenitor of the kind of swashbuckling, exotic romance plot that American Operetta had always favored. Both works were smarter and more sophisticated than the Operettas of old, but still too formal and stodgy to be accepted on Broadway by this time.\n\nEven Operetta on film was becoming discredited, with the last two Jeanette MacDonald-Nelson Eddy vehicles, Bitter Sweet and I Married an Angel, being extremely poorly received. The former cut all of the sophisticated and subversive elements that made the show different from other Operettas; indeed, it bore little resemblance to the stage show beyond its use of a few of the more conventional songs from the score. This was partly because the MacDonald-Eddy film series had already essentially plagiarized the plot of Bitter Sweet for its film version of Romberg’s Maytime. Noel Coward reportedly wept upon seeing the final cut, and later complained that Bitter Sweet, which he had seen as a kind of retirement policy, could never be revived after this film destroyed its reputation…and indeed, though it has been recorded, the show has yet to see a revival in a major venue to this day.\n\nI Married an Angel was even more of a disaster. Based on a very risqué satirical comedy with a score by Rodgers and Hart, it neutered virtually every aspect of its source. The original plot had been one long double-entendre, and once all the ribald elements were removed, virtually nothing of interest was left. The film also bowdlerized the four songs it retained from the stage show (including the now-legendary “Spring Is Here”) to the point where they were almost unrecognizable. The filmmakers didn’t even have the courage to present the fantasy elements straightforwardly, presenting most of the story as a dream on the part of Nelson Eddy’s character. Add the worst performances either star ever gave, and you have a definite entry on the shortlist of worst movie musicals ever made.\n\nThe only other Operetta film from this era that anyone actually remembers is the 1943 remake of the Phantom of the Opera film with Nelson Eddy and Claude Reins (technically the first musical made of the story). Fans of the franchise despise it today for its total lack of fidelity to the source material, but critics at the time didn’t like it much either. The musical portions, mostly drawn from actual operas, were pleasant enough, but they wound up dominating the film, leaving little room for the Horror elements that were supposed to be the movie’s primary draw. Even worse, this is the film that introduced the idea of the Phantom as a normal man disfigured in an accident rather than a naturally deformed lifelong outcast, a frankly stupid idea that has dogged the franchise ever since.\n\nThe Operetta film received a brief revival in the late Forties and early Fifties, but that was largely due to the emergence of a single performer…Mario Lanza. Probably the greatest singer in all of American Operetta, with a voice that would make Nelson Eddy weep with envy, and an expressive actor to boot, Lanza was the kind of talent that entire genres are revived in order to accommodate. What other Operetta singer would dare to portray legendary Opera Tenor Enrico Caruso on film? (And frankly, by all accounts, Lanza was a better actor than Caruso ever dreamed of being).\n\nBut today, Lanza’s best-remembered film is one that he didn’t, technically speaking, even appear in…the 1954 film version of The Student Prince. This underrated classic is subtler and more intelligent than your typical Operetta film like the Jeanette McDonald-Nelson Eddy series. Based on the biggest Broadway hit of Sigmund Romberg’s career, it was already dealing with a plot more bittersweet and grounded in reality than the average operetta of the period. What the movie did was take this already unusually mature story for an operetta and drew it out into a far more relaxed and natural pace. Many have found the movie too slow-moving for this reason, but this unhurried pacing gives it what no operetta had yet had at the time…a believable naturalism of character. In the stage version, for all its improvements on the usual operetta formula, the lovers are still singing the rhapsodic “Deep in My Heart, Dear” almost as soon as they’ve met each other. In the movie, the Prince has time to gradually loosen up from an arrogant, uptight jackass to a nice, fun-loving young man, and he and Kathy have time to believably fall in love as they would in a higher grade of dramatic work.\n\nThe comedy is hit or miss, as in most operettas, with a couple of comic relief scenes that are almost wince-inducing, but the script is consistently literate and has its share of passably witty repartee. This movie offers ample rewards for those patient enough to sit through its gradual process of character development, and that’s having not even mentioned the music. Nearly every major number from Romberg’s score made it into the movie, including the still-famous standards “Serenade”, “Deep In My Heart, Dear”, “Golden Days”, “Drink, Drink, Drink”, and “Come Boys, Let’s All Be Gay, Boys” (the latter of which might provoke some snickers from more juvenile audience members today, especially as it features the chorusmen dancing arm-in-arm as they sing it). Three wonderful new songs were also written for the film, one of which, the soaring hymn “I’ll Walk with God”, has become an enduring standard and is still regularly recorded by standards-singers with sufficiently high tenor voices.\n\nOriginally, Lanza was the play the Prince, but while there are conflicting accounts as to exactly why, he ended up leaving the project. However, in exchange for his release from his contract, the filmmakers were able to retain his vocal tracks, and they are used to glorious effect in the finished film. The actual actor who plays the lead, Edmund Purdom, is a bit stiff and wooden, but he’s serviceable enough, and Lanza’s vocals do a lot to compensate for Purdom’s lack of emotional range. Fortunately, movie musical stalwart Ann Blyth is both a wonderful singer and a winning actress as Cathy, giving what is arguably the best performance of her career here. The rest of the cast give generally understated performances that suit the tone of the film, although there is a stereotypical Yiddish comedian playing an innkeeper who seems quite out of place in these surroundings, and is responsible for several of the weakest comic set pieces. This film isn’t perfect, but it’s far better than it’s generally given credit for, and in many ways has actually held up better than several more famous operetta films.\n\nUnfortunately, the other Operetta films made around this time just continued to display the diminishing returns of the genre. The film versions of Kiss Me, Kate and Kismet, for example, were distinctly underwhelming, partly because the environment of Hollywood at the time forced the filmmakers to drain out all the risqué ribaldry that made the stage versions of those shows so delicious. The 1951 remake of the Show Boat movie, despite some fine performances by Ava Gardner and William Warfield, added a stupid new ending that completely ruined the original’s epic historical sweep. And the 1953 Desert Song film (the third time that property was adapted to the medium) featured a butchered score and a script that was significantly inferior to the original stage book…and believe me, when you come up with a story that makes the original Desert Song plot look good, you have failed on a spectacular level.\n\nLike Operetta, the plotless Revue was dying at this time, albeit more gradually (although it would later experience a resurgence in the songwriter anthology shows of the Seventies). There were still a few classic titles produced during this period…the 1952 and ’56 installments of the long-running New Faces series, Lend an Ear, Ben Bagley’s Shoestring Revue series…but audience had mostly lost patience with the form. The innovations of the early Forties had radically changed audience expectations, and they were now primarily interested in good stories, which was one thing the Revue by definition did not have. It didn’t help that, because most of the real talent was drawn to story musicals, the amount of quality Revue material declined sharply (although several future giants like Charles Strouse and Sheldon Harnick did get their start writing for the genre).\n\nEven the old-school, frivolous style of Musical Comedy popular in the Thirties now looked, compared to the new breed of integrated musicals, almost indistinguishable from the Revue, and it was dying along with that genre. Follow the Girls, a particularly blatant example of the Revue-like tendencies of Thirties-style Musical Comedy, was a long-running hit, thanks to good choreography and star performances by Jackie Gleason and Gertrude Niesen, but it was the kind of hit that virtually no-one would actually admit to liking. A decade later, Bob Fosse’s first outing as a director, Redhead, would get far more respect, winning a Tony at the time and still being viewed to this day with a certain forbearance by theatre historians, despite being essentially the same show. Its ridiculous book and mediocre-to-poor score showed no more compositional merit than Follow the Girls had, and Fosse basically forced it into a hit with superb staging and dancing and a riveting star performance from his wife and muse Gwen Verdon. It serves as a reminder that shows like Starlight Express (that is, badly-written shows carried entirely by their spectacular staging) were a thing long before the Webber era.\n\nThere were also two more stereotypical Black-centric Revue-with-pretense-of-plot shows in the Shuffle Along vein in the Fifties, albeit with significantly less interesting scores than Shuffle Along and its ilk. They were Mr. Wonderful and Jamaica, two flashy but insubstantial vehicles for Sammy Davis, Jr. and Lena Horne, respectively. Both were minor hits, but they were little more than star-spotting exercises. Meanwhile, the more ambitious and authentic Black shows did generally poorly, with even lovely pieces like Harold Arlen’s St. Louis Woman and House of Flowers and Langston Hughes’ Simply Heavenly amounting to little more than cult flops. Hell, St. Louis Woman produced two of the most inescapable standards in the Great American Songbook canon in “Come Rain or Come Shine” and “Anywhere I Hang My Hat Is Home”, and it still managed to bomb…but I digress.\n\nTo close out our look at the dying gasps of the Thirties model of Musical Comedy, let’s talk about what might be the two most disappointing “hits” to come from one of the “classic” names…Cole Porter’s last two stage musicals, Can-Can and Silk Stockings. Porter’s scores for Kiss Me, Kate and Out of This World may have shown an unusual level of consistency in quality, but here he went back to his old formulas from the Twenties and Thirties—implausible, borderline nonsensical plots musicalized with a handful of hit Pop tunes surrounded by a bunch of undistinguished filler.\n\nThe book of Can-Can started off as first-rate Abe Burrows, a very funny and nicely pointed satire of censorship. Unfortunately, by the second act, the plot had completely disintegrated into random insanity, so that no-one in the audience had the slightest idea what was going on. That technique can be harnessed for deliberate artistic purposes, as it was in Yip Harburg’s Flahooley!, but here it just seemed the result of sloppy craftsmanship.\n\nThe score also caught Porter at less than his best. There were about a half-dozen songs in the show that were hits to some degree, but only two of them (“I Love Paris” and “It’s All Right with Me”) really qualify as top-rank Porter classics, although the title-song, more obscure today, does feature some of his wittiest rhyming stunts. Still, the filler numbers were extremely weak even by Porter filler standards, particularly “Every Man is a Stupid Man” and “Never, Never Be an Artist”. Even a few of the hits seem slightly questionable, with the uninspired “Ce’st Magnifique” in particular not having aged well.\n\nSilk Stockings, Porter’s last show for Broadway, was even weaker: it featured superficially topical subject matter, a good cast, a few fine ballads, and virtually nothing else. The attempts at satirical humor regarding Stalinist Russia were so inappropriately light-hearted as to be offensive to both then-contemporary and modern sensibilities, and the score was perhaps the most uneven of Porter’s entire career, with “Satin and Silk” and the tasteless “Siberia” being among the worst songs he ever wrote.\n\nFor the rest of the Forties and most of the Fifties, things more or less followed the patterns set by the aforementioned groundbreaking shows. Rodgers and Hammerstein in particular continued to build on their own innovations, creating two more legendary masterpieces during this period. The first, South Pacific, blurs the line between the Hit Parade scores of the Twenties and Thirties and the integrated character musical. With the exception of one Carousel-style musical scene, “Twin Soliloquies”, this score consisted of a collection of self-contained and largely extractable songs that still perfectly served the needs of the story and characters in context. This alchemy of combining the hit tune with the integrated character score might explain why this is the only one of Rodgers and Hammerstein’s scores where every single number in the finished score is famous (their other four megahits all had one or two numbers that remain obscure to non-theatre fans).\n\nThe score’s immense popularity might also have something to do with its overall tone. The show is, at its heart, a surprisingly ahead-of-its-time indictment of racism, which was released more than a decade before the Civil Rights Movement began and in fact was probably a positive cultural influence on that trend, given its immense popularity and uncompromising presentation of its message. But apart from four immensely moving ballads (“Some Enchanted Evening”, “Bali H’ai”, “Younger than Springtime” and “This Nearly Was Mine”) and one biting message song (“You’ve Got to be Carefully Taught”), this very serious story is told largely in songs that would not sound out of place in a Musical Comedy. This is particularly true for the part of the plucky heroine originally played by the great Mary Martin, who sings items like the sunny credo “A Cockeyed Optimist”, the lighthearted breakup song “I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair”, the ebullient declaration of love “A Wonderful Guy”, and the campy performance piece “Honey Bun”. Other shows would attempt this balancing act in the future, but unlike Shenandoah or The Grand Tour, to name two other examples of Musical Plays with Musical-Comedy scores, South Pacific manages it without scanting the emotional impact of their story or diluting the show’s message.\n\nThe team’s next masterpiece, The King and I, is best known to the general public for its cute kids’ songs like “Getting to Know You”, but it combines that element with a passionate and politically-charged central conflict, the most complex characterization yet seen on Broadway, and some of the team’s most sophisticated music on the ballads and character numbers. Especially impressive are two elaborate musical monologues in the vein of Carousel’s “Soliloquy” for the show’s two main characters. “Shall I Tell You What I Think of You” perfectly sums up the show’s comparatively progressive English heroine’s ambivalence toward her conflicts with, and subconscious attraction to, the King of Siam, while the King himself receives an introspective solo called “A Puzzlement”, which lays out his own internal conflicts and makes him much more than the simplistic sexist tyrant he initially seems to be.\n\nThe show really deserves better than to be seen as mere kiddie fare. To its credit, while some of its portrayals of the Far East seem slightly dated today (the song “Western People Funny” is a bit uncomfortable to listen to these days, and is not helped by never having been all that funny in the first place), I’ve always admired how it offers fair arguments for both sides of its colonialist conflict without clearly endorsing either stance. Yes, there are serious problems with forcing your way in and trying to rewrite another culture, but there are usually some equally big problems with how more “primitive” cultures treat people…especially women and/or the lower classes. It’s a complex issue with no easy answer, and the show acknowledges that. Anna “wins” in the end because that was what happened historically, but the ending plays as deeply ambivalent, with the audience actively uncomfortable with the final tableaux, even more so because they can’t support the alternative unreservedly either. And Anna is hardly portrayed as saintly…remember what she says in the crucial scene between her, the King, and Tuptim, when she’s supposed to be trying to talk the King down but instead tries to vindictively hurt him. She’s “civilized”, compassionate, and (comparatively) enlightened, but she’s also self-righteous, controlling and ideologically myopic…traits that are associated between her and colonialist England. Similarly, the King is responsible, intelligent and self-aware, but also arrogant, sexist and brutal, traits which are (both positively and negatively) associated with the regime he represents. It’s a very balanced perspective, which is exactly what ultimately makes the show so sad.\n\nThe real reason current audiences would feel uncomfortable at the show is that right now, many people (especially those of the “politically correct” ideological stripe) are actively afraid of ambivalence in theatre (or media in general), and The King and I is, by its nature, a study in ambivalence. It honestly seems as though a lot of people are afraid that if people aren’t told exactly what to think by their media, they might come to the “wrong” conclusion because of something they viewed. Letting the audience make up its own mind on what to think is not in vogue right now. This will pass, but until it does, some people will be very afraid of the uncomfortable truths this particular Rodgers and Hammerstein Musical brings to light. But shows that illuminate great truths about the human condition never really date…they just go through stages where people are afraid to hear what they have to say. And these stages always pass, because political trends come and go, but the truths about the human condition never change.\n\nAfter The King and I, the team did three pleasant but ultimately disappointing shows in their declining years. Me and Juliet was originally conceived as a meditation on theatre itself, a kind of proto-A Chorus Line, but wound up as little more than a rip-off of the love triangle from Oklahoma! set backstage at a Broadway musical. Pipe Dream had the best score of the three, with such lovely and moving songs as “Ev’rybody’s Got a Home But Me”, “All At Once You Love Her”, and “The Next Time It Happens”, but its source material (John Steinbeck’s comic novels Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday) proved awkward to adapt to the stage…even though Steinbeck wrote the second novel in the series specifically to provide a more plot-driven source for the prospective musical, the show’s story was still too thin and uneventful to really work in the R&H musical model. It was also not a great fit for R&H’s family-friendly style…it’s still pretty clear in the musical that the show’s leading lady is supposed to be a prostitute, but that information is delivered in an insufferably coy manner that clashed with Steinbeck’s trademark earthy frankness, especially in one of the show’s weaker numbers, the euphemistic “The Happiest House on the Block”.\n\nFlower Drum Song was a study in generational conflict and culture shock under a light-hearted veneer, and was designed so that serious, ambitious “Japanese” numbers abutted more contemporary and Pop-sounding “American” numbers. Unfortunately, while the “Japanese” numbers were often exquisite (particularly “You Are Beautiful”, “A Hundred Million Miracles”, “I Am Going to Like It Here” and “Love, Look Away”), the “American” numbers, apart from the hit tune “I Enjoy Being a Girl”, are nowhere near as interesting or memorable, which throws the show off balance.\n\nStill, the original show deserved better than the godawful rewrite by David Henry Hwang that is the only available licensed version today. There were admittedly some jokes in the original book that had not aged well by the Nineties, but the show needed a few dialogue rewrites, not an entirely new plot, especially not one as idiotic as the one Hwang supplied. Hwang decided to merge the characters of the patriarchal, conservative father and the small-time gangster/nightclub owner who serves as the romantic rival into one character, which is every bit as stupid and ridiculous as it sounds. His script doesn’t even have the excuse of being politically correct anymore, since he included a stereotypical gay character among his many unnecessary additions to the show. Unfortunately, the current owners of the rights to Rodgers and Hammerstein’s shows will whore out their material for wholesale desecration to anyone who hands them a dollar bill, and this isn’t even the worst perversion of their work to result from that state of affairs.\n\nAfter these shows, R&H would of course manage to create one more world-beater in The Sound of Music. But while this show did have one of the most delightful and hit-laden scores in history, it really didn’t become the world-changing juggernaut it is now until the Sixties film version was released, so we’ll save a detailed discussion of it for a later chapter.\n\nI do, however, want to note one particular number from Me and Juliet, because it illustrates a point that many of my readers may want to take to heart. As I stated, Me and Juliet never really fulfilled its ambitions of being a serious treatise on the art of theatre, but it did have a couple of numbers where its original concept shone through, namely “The Big Black Giant” (a touching and thought-provoking meditation on the relationship between performers and their audience), and the second-act opening, “Intermission Talk”. This number is essentially a stern response to, and satirical takedown of, the people who were claiming at the time that “the theatre was dead”. That’s right…in the Fifties, the supposed peak of the theatre snobs’ imaginary “Golden Age”, there were already enough people making that claim that Rodgers and Hammerstein devoted a whole song to the subject.\n\nThere were several attempts to capture the Rodgers and Hammerstein zeitgeist by other authors, but none of them have really lasted. Harold Rome, the composer of Pins and Needles, was responsible for two of the more prominent ones, the Pagnol adaptation Fanny and the Musical Western Destry Rides Again. The former featured former R&H stalwarts William Tabbert, Ezio Pinza, and Florence Henderson in an adaptation of a trilogy of Pagnol plays. The score was certainly intense enough for an R&H Musical Play (Hammerstein had actually wanted the team to adapt it themselves), but it was strangely lacking in memorable melodies, and alternated between cloying cliche (“Welcome Home”, “To My Wife”, “Be Kind to Your Parents”) and blustering melodrama (“Restless Heart”, “I Have To Tell You”, “The Thought of You”). It also featured a couple of spectacular clinkers in “The Octopus Song” and “Shika, Shika”. This, combined with a book that tried much too hard to make a serious story funny, seems to have doomed it to the scrapheap after its initial success.\n\nDestry Rides Again had a somewhat better score, with Dolores Gray’s numbers as the leading lady being particularly good, but rest of the score still indulges in a lot of Fifties corn and schmaltz that hasn’t aged especially well. Also, for all the yodeling, self-consciously Western refrains in the Destry score, the ambience of the Western frontier had been captured much better almost a decade earlier in Lerner and Loewe’s Paint Your Wagon.\n\nThis show has fallen into somewhat ill repute due to its unfortunate movie version, but since that movie has virtually nothing in common with the stage show beyond about half of their songs and the names of two of the characters, we’ll ignore it altogether, at least for the time being. In any case, the original stage show achieves its authentic Western atmosphere by alternating between the two prevailing moods of that ambiance, raucous joy and wistful lyricism. The first category is conveyed in four of the most thrilling choral numbers in Broadway history, “I’m On My Way”, “Whoop-Ti-Yay!”, “There’s a Coach Comin’ In”, and “Hand Me Down That Can of Beans”, as well as in two delightful comedy numbers, “What’s Goin’ On Here” and “In Between”, that manage to be ribald and innocent at the same time. (Neither of these made it into the movie, as they would not have fit in with the film’s much more overtly raunchy sense of humor, which was frankly one of its many problems).\n\nBalancing out this exuberance is a series of lyrical ballads about the beauty and loneliness of the frontier wilderness. Three of these, “I Talk to the Trees”, “They Call the Wind Maria”, and “Wand’rin’ Star” have become widely recognizable standards, but the more obscure “I Still See Elisa” and “Another Autumn” are every bit as beautiful. It tells you something about how well the authors captured the Folk idiom that “They Call the Wind Maria” became one of the signature numbers of one of the inaugural groups of the Sixties Folk revival, The Kingston Trio.\n\nThere was, of course, a narrative in the show as well, but it was of lesser importance: this was very much an atmosphere show, and the story was less important than the spell cast by the music and dances. This may seem odd, given that Lerner and Loewe would later be known as pioneers of the content-rich, intellectual Broadway musical, but their style wouldn’t change until a few years later with the success of My Fair Lady. We’ll get to that.\n\nProbably the most blatant of the Rodgers and Hammerstein derivant, however, was the Musical version of Betty Smith’s novel A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which was transparently trying to be Carousel without the supernatural elements. This becomes especially obvious if you look at the source material, which was primarily a coming-of-age story about Smith’s author avatar Francie. The musical rewrites the plot to put almost all the focus on Francie’s parents, well-meaning wastrel Johnny and long-suffering Katie, who are essentially retreads of Billy Bigelow and Julie Jordan in this adaptation. Even the score is blatantly derivative of Carousel, with almost every song corresponding to a number in the earlier show. The beautiful ballads “Make the Man Love Me” and “I’ll Buy You a Star” are the show’s “If I Loved You” and “Soliloquy”, respectively. “Love is the Reason” corresponds to “June Is Bustin’ Out All Over”, “He Had Refinement” to “Mister Snow”, “Is That My Prince?” to “Geraniums in the Winder”, “Don’t Be Afraid of Anything” to “You’ll Never Walk Alone”, and the fatalistic Folk song “That’s How It Goes” to “Stonecutters Cut It On Stone”. None of these imitations are badly done by any means…the score to A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is actually one of the best of its decade…but I imagine the show’s failure had something to do with the fact that we already had a Carousel.\n\nMeanwhile, two massively successful works built on the innovations of On the Town to create a kind of hybrid between the frivolity of Musical Comedy and the stylistic consistency and dramatic cogency pioneered by the Musical Play. The first, Annie Get Your Gun, has fallen under something of a cloud in modern times because of its treatment of Native Americans, which was actually fairly progressive in a subversive way at the time it was written…note that Chief Sitting Bull is the show’s only intelligent character in a cast otherwise composed of white buffoons. But most modern audiences can’t look past the pidgin English in which the character speaks, even though it’s subtly suggested that this style of speech may be just another ploy to get the white characters to underestimate him.\n\nThen, of course, there’s the song “I’m an Indian Too”. This song is cut from nearly every modern production and is today regarded by many as an offensive caricature almost on the level of the Minstrel-Show “coon songs”, only aimed at another minority. But while there are certain undeniable pressures to not perform it anymore, its negative reputation, like most politically correct overreactions, is something of an oversimplified exaggeration. Unlike the numbers for the “Indians” in Peter Pan, which were completely innocent and unironic and thus are much more uncomfortable to watch today, this song was already intended as a tongue-in-cheek sendup of stereotypes when it was written. Remember that the proudly ignorant and dangerously naive Annie has no real knowledge or understanding of what Native American culture really entails, so she substitutes a laundry list of cliche cultural trappings associated with them…and from the very beginning, that was intended to be the joke. (There’s also the perceived sexism of its she-stoops-to-conquer ending, but that can be fixed without changing a single line if the actor playing Frank can convey that he realizes Annie lost their final shooting match on purpose).\n\nNonetheless, nothing has been able to completely destroy its perception as a classic, due to a combination of a colorful setting, two extremely strong lead characters, and Irving Berlin’s best theatre score. The relationship dynamic between Frank Butler and Annie Oakley was so compelling that twenty years later, shows like Wildcat and The Unsinkable Molly Brown were essentially recycling its central conflict in their own love plots. The trope of the straightforward, easily contented male with a fragile ego set against the defiant, brassy tomboy with ambitions to be more than she already is would become a such a defining influence in Musical Comedy romantic entanglements that today it almost comes across as a cliche, but this show is where it really started.\n\nBerlin attempted a mild Country sound in places, particularly on the ribald ode to ignorance “Doin’ What Comes Naturally”, the comic lament “You Can’t Get a Man with a Gun”, and the tongue-in-cheek Pop tune “Moonshine Lullaby”, but he mostly relied on the characters’ inflections to create the illusion of a setting-appropriate sound. He also indulged in one moment of old-fashioned “we have this great song, and we’re gonna sing it whether it makes any sense or not” mentality in the unforgettable, but nonetheless completely irrelevant to the story, “I Got the Sun in the Mornin’ (and the moon at night)”.\n\nBut this is nonetheless one of theater’s finest scores, featuring Berlin’s almost Schubertian gift for melody along with a greater degree of dramatic integration than any previous Berlin score. This is the show that gave us the all-time definitive showbiz anthem, “There’s No Business Like Show Business”, the breathtaking ballad “They Say Its Wonderful”, and the challenge duet to end all challenge duets, “Anything You Can Do (I Can Do Better)”, among many other indelibly famous songs.\n\nGuys and Dolls, based on the stories of quintessential New York writer Damon Runyan, built on these same innovations, but added a symmetry of plot construction and general unity of style unheard of at the time, subtly foreshadowing the advent of the unified concept shows that would finally achieve the ideal of so-called “Gesamtkunstwerk” that had been theorized about since Wagner’s day. This, combined with a genuine Runyanesque sensibility in the dialogue (courtesy of Abe Burrows, who would go on to become one of Broadway’s most famous librettists) and one of those scores where every single number is absolutely amazing in its own right (a rare feat even among the classics), make this one of Broadway’s most brightly polished gems.\n\nThe score is right up there with South Pacific and My Fair Lady in terms of consistency: even most of the classic titles of the Forties and Fifties had at least one song that wasn’t up to standard (e.g. Oklahoma’s “It’s a Scandal, It’s an Outrage” or Gypsy’s “Mr. Goldstone”), but there isn’t a single song in Guys and Dolls‘ original stage score that is anything less than superb. It features one of the biggest Pop hits of the era, “A Bushel and a Peck”, an unforgettable hit love ballad in “I’ve Never Been in Love Before”, one of Broadway’s funniest comedy numbers, “Adelaide’s Lament”, and one of the most epic eleven-o’clock showstoppers of all time in “Sit Down, You’re Rocking the Boat”. The intense gambler’s prayer “Luck Be a Lady” would become one of Frank Sinatra’s signature songs, even if he didn’t get to sing it in the movie version due to Samuel Goldwyn’s frankly bizarre decision to cast Sinatra as the comic Nathan Detroit and Marlon Brando of all people as the romantic leading man Sky Masterson.\n\nThat movie is really a testament to how strong Guys and Dolls‘ book is simply as a play. Brando acted the part of Sky beautifully, but his singing could be charitably described as “unfortunate”. Five of the stage songs were cut (including one that was incredibly key to the plot, the female leads’ personal resolution “Marry the Man Today”), and three fairly uninteresting new songs were added in their place. Several awkward attempts were made to build up Nathan’s singing part for Sinatra, since in the stage version Nathan hardly sings at all. Really, the only numbers to survive completely unscathed in the movie were “Adelaide’s Lament” (which they wisely kept as a straightforward soliloquy delivered directly to the camera), and “Sit Down, You’re Rockin’ the Boat” (in one of the better casting decisions, both Stubby Kaye as Nicely-Nicely Johnson and Viviane Blaine as Adelaide were retained for the film). But in spite of all this, the film is still a minor classic based purely on the cleverness of the script and the quality of the actors’ delivery. Even among the classic musicals of that era, few could have survived being stripped of their musical splendor, but Guys and Dolls is clearly that rare exception.\n\nThe first two numbers Guys and Dolls are particularly fascinating: “Runyonland”, a choreographed comedic sequence in mime set to an overture-like medley of tunes from the show, and “Fugue for Tinhorns”, a three-part counterpoint piece built out of three gamblers talking about which horse they plan to bet on. Also pushing the boundaries of what a Musical Comedy ‘song’ should entail was “My Time of Day”, a kind of vocal tone poem in Jazz painting a haunting picture of the deserted New York streets in the wee hours of the morning. These numbers sound so natural that few people noticed how unconventional and daring they really were, but they unobtrusively broke ground for future Musical Comedies to employ more sophisticated song models.\n\nThe Pajama Game, written by two of Loesser’s personal proteges, Richard Adler and Jerry Ross, was even more Pop-friendly in its sound. Even in those days when most of Pop music was just poppier rearrangements of songs from Broadway musicals, this score must have sounded almost like Stephen Schwartz’s work does today…as a harnessing of blatantly Pop-based sounds to serve a conventional Musical-Theatre narrative.\n\nThis might be one of the reasons The Pajama Game is one of the few top-level classics from before the 1970s that is occasionally dismissed because of its lack of dramatic pretension, much like some modern classics like The Producers are today. Despite a tongue-in-cheek joke that it makes in its first scene, this wasn’t an ambitious drama with serious themes like the Rodgers and Hammerstein shows, nor was it even a more subtly ambitious stylistic tour-de-force like Guys and Dolls. It was, essentially, just a standard potboiler musical comedy of the period, albeit one that has transcended potboiler status by proving to be perennially popular in the long term.\n\nThat said, the book is not the primary reason for this continued success, and in fact has done more to hamper it over the years. It’s still funny in a trashy sort of way, and it provides some memorably colorful and likable characters, including a genuinely compelling leading man who masks his deep insecurities with false bravado and provided a marvelous opportunity to the show’s original star, John Raitt. Even so, the book has also dated severely in a number of ways. Not only has the show’s setting…labor vs. management at a pajama factory complicated by a Romeo-and-Juliet-style romance…consigned it to being played as a period piece, since business practices have altered out of recognition multiple times since then, but its sexual politics have a very Fifties feel to them, and several scenes can admittedly feel a little uncomfortable to modern audiences.\n\nWhat makes the show a classic is the two things musical comedy lives for…the songs and the dances. The choreography was Bob Fosse’s first work for Broadway and remains some of his most iconic even today, especially the sexy trio number “Steam Heat” and the mock tango “Hernando’s Hideaway”. In addition to Fosse’s contribution, the show’s other claim to fame is the score, which, while it may never reach the heights achieved by the top-level Broadway classics, is notable for its sheer degree of consistency and enjoyment value. While Adler and Ross would go on to score one more hit (Damn Yankees) and Adler would write three more shows after Ross’ death (including the beloved cult flop Kwamina), neither of them would ever write anything this good again (it helps that a couple of the songs have some co-writing contributions from the team’s aforementioned mentor, Frank Loesser).\n\nThe melodies sparkle, especially on the immortal ballad “Hey There”, the lilting waltz “I’m Not At All In Love”, the driving Country-flavored showstopper “There Once Was a Man”, and the pop-tango sound of “Hernando’s Hideaway”. As for the lyrics, they are frequently superb, especially on the numbers for Hines, the show’s comic relief figure, such as the riotously risque “I’ll Never Be Jealous Again” or the gloriously absurd “Think of the Time I Save”. Even the songs added for later revivals are uniformly delightful, with “The World Around Us”, “The Three of Us”, and “If You Win, You Lose” basically living up to the level of the original score (“The World Around Us” was actually written for the original production and was even present in the show on opening night, but it was cut immediately thereafter and not used again until much later revivals). Hell, even the song Adler and Ross wrote to be added to the movie version, “The Man Who Invented Love”, which wound up being cut at the last minute, became surprisingly popular in its own right, with Doris Day’s rendition even making it onto at least one of her greatest hits albums…not at all bad for a cut song from a musical.\n\nThis score is unambitious, unashamedly pop-friendly, at times blatantly derivative (I’m not the first person to notice how much “A New Town Is a Blue Town” sounds like “Lonely Town” from On the Town in both music and lyrics), and one of the finest scores of the 1950s. I have to acknowledge that most of the musical-theater classics that have shown this level of endurance are actually more artistically interesting than this one, but I also have to acknowledge that precious few of them are as much fun to see or hear.\n\nBut probably the most direct successor to On the Town‘s legacy (given that it had virtually the same creative team as that work) was Wonderful Town. The difference between the two shows is that, while On the Town had been both wildly exuberant and, in its own subtle way, deeply moving, it had only intermittently been funny. Wonderful Town was far less ambitious and certainly less moving than its predecessor, but it contains some of the funniest comedy numbers in Broadway history.\n\nThe casting of non-singing actress Rosalind Russell in the lead somewhat limited the show’s musical palette, although there were two very beautiful ballads for the supporting characters, the giddy “A Little Bit in Love” and the touching “A Quiet Girl”. But Comden and Green’s lyrics here are unmatched by any other score in their oeuvre, except perhaps On the Twentieth Century. Numbers like “One Hundred Easy Ways to Lose a Man” (a dazzling comic lament about men being actively turned off by women who are smarter than them), “What a Waste” (a ruefully funny account of artists’ failed careers in the brutal competition that is New York), “Conversation Piece” (a musical scene perfectly capturing what it’s like to be on a date and realize that you and your companion have absolutely nothing to talk about), and “Conga!” (a riotous dance sequence that just keeps getting more and more out of control as it goes on) represent some of the best work of the team’s career.\n\nEven the music itself contributes to the comedy, as on “Swing!”, a deadpan parody of a Fats Waller-esque Jazz cooker that suddenly turns into a real one as Russell’s character finds her inner hepcat, or the oddly irresistible musical novelty “Wrong Note Rag”. One could argue that Wonderful Town and Comden and Green’s later follow-up piece in the same vein Bells Are Ringing (with composer Jule Styne) are really Thirties Musical Comedies in a Fifties disguise, with their improbable (a less charitable critic might say “absurd”) plots and lack of dramatic substance, but at least they took note of the form’s innovations in character writing during that interim.\n\nTwo other shows built on the fable-like structure and supernatural elements of Cabin in the Sky, becoming in the process the two archetypical Broadway fantasies. The first, Finian’s Rainbow, was in a sense a sort of follow-up to The Wizard of Oz. It may have been a stage musical rather than a film, but it was written by E.Y. “Yip” Harburg, the genius-level lyricist who had wound up as The Wizard of Oz’s primary textual auteur, and it was another fantastical fable built around a heavily implied statement about the American experience.\n\nThe thing that separates Finian from both Wizard of Oz and Cabin in the Sky, however, is that it is a satirical fantasy, with a message that was actually fairly subversive for the time. In this sense, it draws as much from the Gershwins’ Gilbert-and-Sullivan-esque collaborations with George S. Kaufmann (such as Strike Up the Band, Of Thee I Sing, and Let ‘Em Eat Cake) as it does on Cabin in the Sky’s Folk fantasy or The Wizard of Oz’s homespun allegory.\n\nAccordingly, the score mixes lyrical, folklike ballads (“How Are Things in Glocca Morra”, “Look to the Rainbow”, “Old Devil Moon”) that would not have been out of place in Cabin in the Sky, and playful expressions of pure whimsy (“If This Isn’t Love”, “Something Sort of Grandish”, “When I’m Not Near the Girl I Love”) straight out of The Wizard of Oz, side by side with wickedly funny social commentary (“That Great Come-and-Get-It Day”, “When the Idle Poor Become the Idle Rich”, the subversive mock-Gospel number “The Begat”).\n\nThe show takes on racism, government corruption and the oppression of the poor by the rich, which makes it rather surprising that it is yet another classic show currently under fire from the political correctness crowd. This is partly because, for all its satire of capitalism, it ultimately approves of the system, but mostly because the racist senator who serves as the show’s villain is temporarily turned into a Black man in order to show him how it feels to bear the brunt of racism. It’s perfectly possible to do this without putting the actor in blackface (all you need is a Black actor as a double and some creative staging to “magically” substitute one for the other), but the very concept itself seems to make the PC types uncomfortable, for reasons that frankly don’t make a lot of sense.\n\nHarburg would later attempt an even more whimsical follow-up to Finian’s Rainbow, a satire of McCarthyism and big business with singing puppets, a laughing doll and a Genie entitled Flahooley! Unfortunately, this one did much less well commercially. Part of this could possibly be chalked up to a somewhat more uneven score. Granted, the tunes were pretty much the best Sammy Fain had ever composed (certainly better than his work on Ankles Aweigh or the Disney Peter Pan movie), and the ballads and charm songs (“Here’s To Your Illusions”, “The World is Your Balloon”, “He’s Only Wonderful”, “The Springtime Cometh”) were every bit as good as those in Finian. But the satirical numbers, such as the opening “You Too Can Be a Puppet”, the ironic up-tune about economic issues “Jump Little Chillun”, or the villain song “Spirit of Capsulanti”, mostly just come off as strange, and not necessarily in a good way. But the real issue was that at that particular moment a big enough portion of Broadway audiences and critics still agreed with McCarthy’s tactics that they apparently didn’t want to see him publicly pilloried in a Broadway show (this was just after the Korean War had broken out…it would be years before Candide came out, let alone The Crucible).\n\nAnother example of the “contemporary” Musical Fantasy (albeit one with much less satirical bite) is the second hit for the team of Adler and Ross, Damn Yankees. Both of Adler and Ross’ hits were masterminded by director George Abbott, who had been the dean of old-style Musical Comedy but was becoming increasingly irrelevant in this new era. Granted, as we’ve previously discussed, The Pajama Game managed to transcend its potboiler beginnings and emerge as a genuine classic.\n\nDamn Yankees, however, did not achieve this feat…its score left behind a few still-recognizable semi-standards, but there’s a reason no-one really performs it anymore. On paper, it had a much more interesting story than The Pajama Game…a middle-aged man makes a deal with the Devil (here going by the name of Mr. Applegate) in order to enable his favorite baseball team to win the Pennant, and is transformed into a young, unstoppably gifted baseball player. Despite the aid of Lola, a Satanic temptress who is sent to seduce him but instead falls in love with him, he very nearly loses his soul, but is ultimately saved by his genuine love for the wife he left behind.\n\nUnfortunately, this colorful story was told by way of a cluttered, sloppily-written book that made it seem far more conventional and mundane than it actually was. And the score was much more uneven than that of The Pajama Game. There were gems, to be sure…the irresistible cheer-up ditty “You’ve Gotta Have Heart” was a massive hit for a reason. And Lola’s signature numbers “A Little Brains, a Little Talent” and “Whatever Lola Wants” represent some of the best Musical Comedy writing of their time, as does Applegate’s deadpan villain song “Those Were the Good Old Days”.\n\nBut the ballads were on the dull side, with “A Man Doesn’t Know” in particular being stiffer and more stilted than any Operetta ballad. This impression was only enhanced by the casting of Stephen Douglas as Joe’s younger self…Douglas, a popular leading man of the era, had a fine voice but was so stodgy that he made Nelson Eddy look like Carol Channing. Even worse, Bob Fosse’s two big dance numbers, while splendid as choreography, were attached to some of the weakest songs he would ever be offered, with “Who’s Got the Pain?” in particular ranking as one of the worst songs to be found in any enduring hit musical. Damn Yankees serves as a good reminder that even many of the canonized classics of the so-called “Golden Age” are not really as perfect as some people like to remember.\n\nThe other great fantasy show of this era was Brigadoon, the first top-shelf masterpiece by the team of lyricist Alan Jay Lerner and composer Frederick Loewe. This show is essentially a Mass with a plot, like Bach’s sacred Oratorios such as The Passion of St. Matthew. It tells the story of a miracle, and in its sacred atmosphere and solemn, ritualistic dance sequences, it really does resemble a kind of religious service: even its love songs have a hymn-like feel to them. Indeed, one of the first lines of the show is “There’s something about this forest that gives me the feeling of being in a cathedral”. The hero’s best friend, a hard-drinking, wise-cracking pessimist, serves as the voice of the hero’s doubts and ingrained cynicism, in a device that is as old as the medieval morality play but somehow timeless in its effectiveness.\n\nThe often ravishing score was instrumental in creating this atmosphere, with lilting Gaelic-flavored ballads like “The Heather on the Hill”, “Come To Me, Bend To Me”, and “There But For You Go I” and a breathtaking chorale of a title-song. Two bawdy showstoppers for the female comic part help to provide a sense of contrast and keep things from getting too weighty. The score even managed to produce a massive hit tune, the delicately jazzy “Almost Like Being in Love”, which became one of Frank Sinatra’s all-time signature songs.\n\nIt’s been pointed out that Brigadoon’s plot bears more than a passing resemblance to that of the novel and film Lost Horizon, both in its basic premise and in the overall structure of its plot. But Brigadoon has far more emotional weight and impact than the campy, dated and somewhat pretentious Lost Horizon. And certainly, the two attempts to musicalize the Lost Horizon property, Harry Warren’s short-lived Fifties stage musical Shangri-La and Burt Bacharach’s disastrous musical film version from the Seventies, both turned out infinitely inferior to Brigadoon, so if you really must think of it as a rip-off of Lost Horizon (which is as short-sighted as calling The Yeomen of the Guard a rip-off of Maritana), think of it as the great musical version that franchise never got.\n\nUnfortunately, Brigadoon’s reputation has long been marred by the mediocre movie version. For one thing, the score is vastly cut to make room for extraneous choreography, but even with Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse doing the dancing, the results were never interesting enough to justify the loss of “Come to Me, Bend to Me”, “There But For You Go I”, “From This Day On”, or “My Mother’s Wedding Day”. For another thing, Gene Kelly is a wonderful dancer and a winning actor, but his singing voice, while suitable for his usual Musical-Comedy roles, isn’t up to this kind of Operetta-caliber music, and he ruins much of the remaining score. Cyd Charisse had her singing dubbed here by a reasonably pretty-voiced studio ringer, but she comes across as uncomfortably modern and sophisticated for a role that is supposed to be a sheltered Scottish country lass. The movie was also very obviously filmed on a studio back lot, which sabotages the rich atmosphere of the Scottish hills the stage show captured: if this story had to be filmed at all, it should have been shot on location.\n\nThe only thing the movie seems to have done right is casting Van Johnson, who does a potent job as the resident voice of cynicism. But making the cynic who is supposed to be proven wrong by the story more compelling than any other element is arguably even worse for the film’s intended message. In addition, the villainous Harry Beaton, who is supposed to be the symbolic embodiment of bitterness, self-pity and spite, (in other words, the Devil in the show’s religious construction…even the song about him sounds like the Dies Irae portion of a Requiem), comes off in the movie more like a voice of reason with a perfect legitimate and understandable grievance against The Miracle. In the stage show, Beaton is supposed to be a cautionary example of people who dwell so deeply on the things they can’t have that they come to hate themselves and everyone else, and while we are supposed to feel a certain measure of pity for him, he’s certainly not intended to offer any valid insights.\n\nWorst of all, with all the religious atmosphere stripped away, audiences are naturally going to interpret the film’s plot as a fantasy that is meant to be taken more or less literally, like Tolkein’s Lord of the Rings. And the show cannot survive that treatment, as once the story is treated as a literal event a myriad of logical flaws immediately crop up that make it completely implausible, even as fantasy.\n\nOf all the fantastical Folk fables to follow in Cabin in the Sky‘s footsteps, however, the most authentically folksy of all was Sing Out, Sweet Land!, a Forties flop where the score quite literally consisted largely of actual Folk standards. It starred legendary leading man Alfred Drake: he would do a series of failed musicals between his roles in Oklahoma! and Kiss Me, Kate, but this was easily the most interesting of them. He played a wandering singer cursed with immortality by a vindictive Puritan parson who disapproved of his love of music and dancing. The cast also included the great Folk singer Burl Ives, who had, after all, gotten his start as a Broadway performer, and seemed to be returning to pay his dues to the two forms of music he loved together.\n\nThe picaresque plot took us throughout American history, from the Civil War to World War II, and the music varied from Folk chestnuts like “The Blue Tail Fly” to Black spirituals and blues songs and even a couple of Great American Songbook standards. Only three of the songs were originals, but those three songs were as memorable as the classics they stood beside, especially the finale, “More Than These”, an inspirational ode to America and America’s music that offered a message of hope for the country in the middle of the still-raging second World War.\n\nThe Theatermania Guide to Musical Theater Recordings (which is possibly the most useless “guide” to audio recordings ever published) disparaged and dismissed this show’s cast recording, saying it would be “of very little interest” to fans of Broadway musicals. But frankly, if Musical Theatre listeners are too ignorant to appreciate seminal Folk classics like the songs heard in this show, then I am ashamed of them.\n\nPerhaps the most important remaining show of the Forties (though admittedly not the most successful or popular) was Kurt Weill’s Lost in the Stars. This show’s great achievement was being the first “Concept Musical” in the modern sense to be an unqualified artistic success. The two earlier examples of the form, the aforementioned Allegro and Weill’s own Love Life were deeply flawed, but this show, while too esoteric to have ever been a smash hit, is damned near flawless as a composition.\n\nThe reason becomes obvious when you examine the show stylistically. Allegro and Love Life, generally speaking, fell short of their goals because of the parts of them that were beholden to traditional Musical Theatre…the humor, the conventional storytelling, the tired character archetypes. This show, on the other hand, bears no resemblance to any other musical of its time beyond the fact that it is a stage drama with songs. There is no comedy, no dancing, and no attempt at sex appeal: the closest the show ever comes is the sleazy nightclub number “Who’ll Buy (my juicy rutabagas)”, but it is written to come across as more disturbing than funny or sexy, much like “Lovely Ladies” in Les Miserables decades later.\n\nThe show, based on the beloved South African novel Cry, the Beloved Country, tells of a Black Anglican preacher in a small South African town who journeys to Johannesburg in search of his estranged son, only to find that son has accidentally killed a man in the course of a robbery. It has a book and lyrics by the great playwright Maxwell Anderson, who had already written a sort of political Comic Operetta in the Of Thee I Sing vein with Weill in the Thirties. That show, Knickerbocker Holiday, was much stranger than anyone seemed to notice at the time, but frankly it looks positively conventional next to Lost in the Stars.\n\nEven the distribution of the songs is highly unusual for a musical. The central character of Stephen Kumalo has four major songs, of which two (the poetic “Thousands of Miles” and the warmly inviting “The Little Gray House”) are gentle and loving ballads and the other two (the cosmically despairing title-song and the Carousel-esque freeform soliloquy “Oh, Tixo, Tixo, Help Me”) are anguished cries of confusion and desperation.\n\nBut apart from two torch ballads for the son’s girlfriend, “Trouble Man” and “Stay Well”, the rest of the songs are mostly the Greek Chorus’ commentary on the action: their keening laments for their nation’s tragedy in “The Hills of Ixopo” and “Cry, the Beloved Country”; their analysis of the dark side of human nature in “Fear” and “The Wild Justice”; the sublimely lyrical closing number “A Bird of Passage”; and what must be the scariest “Train song” in all of Musical Theatre, “Train to Johannesburg”. It actually features vocalists imitating the sound of a moving train, but with hair-raising music and lyrics that chant a prophecy of doom.\n\nThis Musical, tragic as it is, features one of the most inspiring endings of all time, as two men, one a white former racist whose son was murdered, and one a Black man whose own son is about to be hanged for that murder, make their peace with each other and say, “I have a friend”. It is a very idealistic ending, and some have taken issue with it because of that (the author of show’s source novel famously hated the musical and its ending in particular), but it is a shining beacon of exactly the kind of love and forgiveness Nelson Mandela himself preached, so it’s hard to fathom where the objections come from.\n\nThe ‘revolution’ that the Musical experienced in the 1940s is generally credited almost entirely to Oklahoma!, but can really be traced to the innovations of no less than ten genre-busting stage and film musicals, of which Oklahoma! is but one (interestingly, four of these ten works have music by the same composer…but more on that later).\n\nThe first of these shows is arguably the greatest Broadway Musical of all time, Porgy and Bess. It appeared a little earlier than the others (1935), but took a few years to be fully appreciated by either critics or public, so its effect on Broadway’s future really kicked in around the same time as the others.\n\nThis is the show which introduced to Broadway an entirely new format, the Pop Opera, which took the sounds of the mainstream popular music in the ages of Jazz and Rock and elevated them to operatic intensity and ambition in a through-sung theater piece. Yes, those Rock- and Pop-flavored Broadway neo-operas that the critics love to hate are really just following in the footsteps of one of the most acclaimed shows of all time.\n\nThe show deals with one of the central tragedies of the human existence: the fact that love does not, in fact, conquer all. The two main characters…a desperately lonely cripple and the debased lover/slave of an abusive local brute…find solace in a love as real and deep as any you could ever hope to find, and yet circumstances still manage to tear them apart. It is also significant in that it deals almost exclusively with Black characters (the only whites in the show are non-singing walk-on parts), but it tells of a simple local tragedy in a rural community not especially different from the Italian verismo Operas. The reason the characters had to be Black has nothing to do with the story and everything to do with the music, which was designed to elevate traditional Black musical idioms to Operatic heights and breadths.\n\nGershwin blended the sounds of Classical music with those of Jazz, Blues, Spirituals, and Tin Pan Alley Pop songwriting to create one of the most sophisticated scores ever written for either Opera or Broadway. In terms of the score, Porgy and Bess contains two kinds of songs (or arias, if you prefer the term): the kind that are so famous that virtually everyone is familiar with them, and the kind that aren’t but should be. Surprisingly, the former category includes several songs that wear their Operatic ambitions quite openly, including the achingly beautiful duet “Bess, You Is My Woman Now”, what is probably the saddest Torch Song of all time, “My Man’s Gone Now”, and above all the exquisite lullaby “Summertime”, which presents a sublime fusion of Blues harmonies with Classical lyricism.\n\nIn a more conventional “Jazz standard” vein, we have such staples as the profane anti-sermon “It Ain’t Necessarily So”, the seductive strut “There’s a Boat Dat’s Leavin’ Soon for New York”, and the wryly cynical “A Woman is a Sometime Thing”. The latter is, in terms of lyrical content, a Jazz version of Verdi’s famous aria “La Donne Mobile”, even retaining the implicit double meaning of “women are fickle” and “women are replaceable”.\n\nBut arguably the very greatest highlight of the score is the indescribably joyful up-tune “I Got Plenty o’ Nuttin’”. Some people who like to reduce everything to their pet political causes have acted snide about the idea of a Black character saying “Nuttin’ was plenty for (him)”, but the philosophy this song actually presents is closer to a Folk version of Zen Buddhism. It’s worth noting that the original Porgy himself, Todd Duncan, who was a College professor at the time and initially thought performing in a musical was beneath him, was in tears when he heard this song and said it was the point at which he knew he had to do the show.\n\nThe other half of the songs…the overlooked gems in the score…are every bit as wonderful as the hits; this is not a score with filler in it, even in the expanded Operatic editions that restore all the material cut from the original production. Many of them are just too embedded in the action to easily extract, but some just seem to have been inexplicably overlooked by the public.\n\nAmong the most brightly polished of these “hidden gems” are Porgy’s establishing soliloquy “They Pass By Singin’” and his defiant cry of freedom “The Buzzard Song”; Bess’s heartbreaking attempt at resistance when her former lover Crown tries to reclaim her, “What You Want Wid Bess”; the second, more dramatically intense duet for the leads, “I Loves You, Porgy”, as she begs him to protect her from both Crown and herself; the aching trio “Bess, Oh, Where’s My Bess” when Porgy returns to find her gone; the haunting, unearthly musical prayer “Oh, Doctor Jesus”; two thrilling gospel ensembles, “Overflow” and “Leavin’ For the Promised Land”; and a gorgeous, layered “Requiem” mourning those killed in a hurricane. The show even features what is probably the first ever use of what we would now call “Rap” in a theatre score, in the vicious diatribe “I Hates Your Struttin’ Style”.\n\nThe show also features one of the most exquisite handlings of a tragic ending ever seen on the stage. We know all too well that Porgy doesn’t have a chance of making it to New York alive, and that even if he did it wouldn’t make any difference, but his quixotic refusal to give up hope and his determination to try anyway adds a deeper dimension to the tragedy, and makes his closing anthem “Oh, Lawd, I’m On My Way” one of the most moving final numbers in any Musical Theatre piece, Opera or Broadway.\n\nThe work that really got this revolution off the ground was the genre-defying fantasy classic The Wizard of Oz, which did for the Movie Musical what Oklahoma! and its ilk did for the stage musical. Indeed, just about the only thing you could say had a visible influence on this piece was the Laurel and Hardy Babes in Toyland, which in retrospect seems almost like a dry run for this world-changing cinematic landmark’s achievements.\n\nThe Wizard of Oz was not remotely beholden in any way to the genres that straightjacketed both stage and film musicals at the time, but it was, among many other things, a musical. Indeed, it had more music than the vast majority of film musicals at the time, with a total of twelve distinct numbers (thirteen if you count “The Jitterbug”, cut from the film because the producers feared it would serve to date what they already foresaw would be an immortal classic).\n\nHarold Arlen wrote probably the single most indelible melody of his already illustrious career for the film’s legendary hit tune “Over the Rainbow”, and Yip Harburg’s dazzling lyrics on such songs as “If I Only Had a Brain” and its subsequent variants reportedly set the writing style for the whole film, with the script simply echoing Harburg’s idiom.\n\nThere is one set-piece showstopper (“If I Were King of the Forest”), and one largely extraneous musical sequence that exists mainly to show off the film’s visuals (“In the Merry Old Land of Oz”), but the rest of the score is as integrated as any musical, stage or film, had ever been up to that point. Apart from “Over the Rainbow”, none of the other songs would make sense outside the context of the film, and have only managed to become popular hits because the film is so galactically famous that anyone likely to hear them already knows the story.\n\nEven the performing legends that make up most of the cast are almost universally agreed to have given their greatest performances in this film. Judy Garland gave the most touching performance of her career here, and became so iconically associated with the film that in later years she actually came to find it annoying (hence her famous quote on the subject, “I’m up to my ass in rainbows”). Famed dancer Ray Bolger outshone any of his great Broadway performances as the film’s Scarecrow, and Bert Lahr, arguably the greatest comic actor of his age, received his definitive showcase as the Cowardly Lion. Margaret Hamilton’s performance as the Wicked Witch of the West has been so widely parodied by now that it’s easy to forget how terrifying it still is when you actually see it.\n\nIn addition to practically inventing the Hollywood fantasy genre and having a heavy impact on pretty much every family movie ever made, The Wizard of Oz opened up the possibility for a musical movie to strive for more than the stereotypical clichés that had become associated with the genre.\n\nAlso, the year before The Wizard of Oz, another groundbreaking film that happened to use music, Walt Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, was released. It’s not really all that different from the live action musicals of the era in some ways…Snow White is quite clearly an Operetta heroine, from her yearning romantic ballad “Someday My Prince Will Come” to her cheery production number “Whistle While You Work”, and her Prince is the stodgiest romantic hero yet seen. But the film’s comedy relief is vastly funnier and more charming than any Operetta up to this point, and the comic characters and songs, along with the terrifying villain, are what gave it a wholly unique style. This is the film that inaugurated the Animated Musical, a genre that would prove increasingly important in later years (particularly the Nineties, when it would be virtually the only kind of film musical being made), and it forged a perennial link between animated feature films and musicals that is still in evidence today.\n\nThe next of these revolutionary works to actually appear on a Broadway stage was the folk parable Cabin in the Sky. Today this show seems dated and maybe even a little racially patronizing, but at the time it was a never-before-seen sensation, and not just because of its glorious score (written by Vernon Duke, a semi-unknown who never had another success on Broadway, though he managed to produce a few other hit songs even so). All-black shows were rare enough as it was during this time period, but most of the ones that did exist were jazzy musical comedies loosely modeled after the Cotton Club revues, so this folksy, religious-themed fantasy parable was a totally new creature. Despite not really being a hit and only rarely having seen a revival, the show was gigantically influential, and not only because it produced one of the biggest hit songs of the Forties, “Taking a Chance on Love”. It set the model for the use of fantasy on Broadway in such shows as Finian’s Rainbow and Brigadoon, and laid the stage for Oklahoma!‘s innovation in its popularization of the Folk idiom on Broadway.\n\nThe second stage show in this sequence, Lady in the Dark, isn’t a musical in the conventional sense at all. It’s essentially a straight play (by Moss Hart, of the famous Kaufman and Hart writing team) about a female advertising executive undergoing psychotherapy interrupted by three surreal musical dream sequences representing her psychological nightmares. Only one of the show’s songs, “My Ship” was actually incorporated into the book scenes, and it repurposed the hoary old Operetta device of the “unfinished melody” (which dates as far back as Naughty Marietta) as a metaphor for the self-knowledge and self-acceptance that is the primary goal of psychotherapy, thus showing how even the most outdated clichés could be reinvented to serve the most modern purposes.\n\nWith music by the legendary German composer Kurt Weill, and lyrics by Ira Gershwin, striking out on his own after his brother George’s death, the show’s score broke pretty much every rule in the Musical Theater handbook at the time, presaging the techniques of Rodgers and Hammerstein by featuring extended musical scenes rather than self-contained songs. Its innovations go beyond that, however…it also pioneered several of the techniques associated with the Concept Musical, essentially presaging both the onstage numbers in Cabaret and the final sequence of Follies, and proved more than any other show on this list that the most basic rules of musical theater could be broken while still achieving success. The show’s elaborate and surreal musical scenes even managed to somehow produce an enduring hit song, “The Saga of Jenny”.\n\nInterestingly, the premise of Lady in the Dark is almost exactly the same as that of the cult Musical television show of the 2010s, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend…the story of a cripplingly neurotic career woman trying to sort out her issues amid conflicting romantic entanglements, punctuated by dream-sequence musical numbers. There are some dull stretches, particularly in the first act, but it’s impressive that even after all the years that have passed and all the shows it’s influenced, Lady in the Dark still seems genuinely strange. Its structure, format, and musical and dramatic content were clearly just as shocking and puzzling to the audience at the 2019 City Center production I attended as they were to Forties audiences.\n\nThe next major agent of change on Broadway, Pal Joey, by the team of Rodgers and Hart, was in some sense a fairly conventional uptempo song-and-dance musical comedy…it just happened to center around a sociopathic central character and be far franker about sexual matters than any Broadway show before it, trading the coy innuendo of traditional Broadway for an (at the time) appalling bluntness. The score, despite managing to produce two huge hits, “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered” and “I Could Write a Book”, didn’t sound like your typical musical-comedy fare either…note that the former is a sour, cynical lament with some overtly sexual lyrics, and the latter a blatantly insincere near-parody of conventional love songs.\n\nThe rest of the score alternated between being silkily sarcastic and almost abrasively brash. The other song to have hung on outside the show, “Zip”, a brutal satire of the blatantly superficial literary pretentions of stripper Gypsy Rose Lee, is a good example. Lee was roughly the then-contemporary equivalent of modern “celebutantes” like Paris Hilton or Kim Kardashian, and while I don’t normally see why some people seem to view Pop culture references from sixty-plus years ago as more of a sign of sophistication than contemporary Pop culture references, I will admit that “Zip” just might be the greatest takedown of a phony celebrity ever heard in a Broadway show.\n\nEvery character is the show, except for the utterly brainless dupe of an ingenue, is an absolutely awful human being (although Vera, the wealthy, sex-starved married woman who “keeps” Joey, seems slightly less so today in light of changing cultural norms), and Joey is the most awful of all. While a pre-Hollywood Gene Kelly in the original production gave the character an enormous amount of charm, it still wasn’t enough to disguise what a scumbag this character was. But of course, that didn’t need to be disguised…it was the entire point of the show. Indeed, director George Abbott, in a rare stand against convention, insisted on throwing out the original “happy” ending, which was untrue to the inherently unwholesome nature of the story, in favor of a more flippant, cynical final curtain that was more suitable for the show’s spirit (although the show’s neutered film version reinstated that ending as part of its relentless effort to turn this sleazy black comedy into a traditional Hollywood romance). All of the Musical Theatre’s great satires, particularly How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying and Chicago, owe something to this pioneering work of ultra-cynical character writing.\n\nNext in this sequence, we come to the much-vaunted Oklahoma!. While the perceived singleness of its role in the genre’s development is probably just a touch exaggerated, there’s no denying that it did break an enormous amount of ground in terms of naturalistic character writing and seamless musical integration on Broadway. Of course, it helps that the score is indelible, with 90% of it having gone on to become enduring Great American songbook standards (the previous record for this, let’s remember, had been five songs per show).\n\nWhile “Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin’” was not, in fact, the first intimate solo ballad to open a Broadway show (hell, even Anything Goes had opened with “I Get a Kick Out of You”), it was still the most marvelously atmospheric opening number seen on Broadway until that point. Similarly, “Laurie Makes Up Her Mind” was not the first “Dream Ballet” seen in a Broadway musical (even Babes in Arms had featured one), but it was the first to use it for such cutting psychological purpose, and influenced every later example through more than just popularizing the form. And songs like the free-flowing multipart sequence “The Surrey With the Fringe on Top”, the bickering I-won’t-admit-I-love-you duet “People Will Say We’re In Love”, and the terrifying cry of anguished rage “Lonely Room” for the show’s psychotic villain Jud Fry really did break enormous ground in character songwriting for future Broadway shows.\n\nThe aforementioned villain is a particularly fascinating and chilling character because he’s not really evil…he’s just crazy. He’s genuinely too mentally ill to be able to control his actions, to the point where he manages to be a sexual predator and potential murderer and a pitiful outcast who just wants to be loved at the same time. He’s actually quite sympathetic in a tragic way, but he’s also dangerous and frightening enough that we understand why he has to be put down, like a rabid dog, in order for the main characters to safely go on with their lives.\n\nOklahoma! also has the advantage of having produced a movie version as iconic as the stage show…Lady in the Dark had a marginal movie with most of the music cut, Pal Joey‘s film version was so toned-down and sanitized as to be almost unrecognizable, and while Cabin in the Sky did produce a famous (and frankly excellent) movie, it bore surprisingly little resemblance to the show it was based on. But one can appreciate everything that made Oklahoma! great from the comfort of one’s own living room, which might go some way toward explaining its perceived status as the great game-changer of Musical Theater.\n\nThe next landmark of Broadway’s reinvention, On the Town, finds the sunnier, more idealistic side of Musical Comedy bringing itself in line with the innovations of the earlier shows in this section. Apart from its spectacularly showy use of extensive ballet sequences, On the Town is a more-or-less traditional musical comedy, except that it fills out its characters realistically by the end and provides a note of bittersweetness to its exuberance.\n\nThis show was the breakthrough work for a composer who would straddle the worlds of Broadway and Classical Music for his entire career, the always legendary Leonard Bernstein, and that duality was definitely reflected here: the music for the ballets was full-on Modern Classical, but the songs were fairly conventional Pop tunes of the era. Most of the score consists of joyous Musical-Comedy showstoppers like “New York, New York” or “I Can Cook, Too”, but the ballads, such as “Lonely Town”, “Lucky to be Me”, and “Some Other Time”, are monumentally moving, featuring an emotional resonance that would have been unthinkable in the Musical Comedies of the Twenties and Thirties.\n\nThis show set the tone for later Musical Comedies like Annie Get Your Gun or Guys and Dolls that retained the conventions of the genre but filled them out by incorporating some of the naturalism and character depth of more serious shows like Oklahoma! It even made for a surprisingly good movie, despite having the vast majority of its stage score replaced by forgettable Hollywood filler, which demonstrates how strong the show’s story really is in itself.\n\nThen there was Carousel, in which Rodgers and Hammerstein built on their innovations in Oklahoma! to fully realize a genre that had been first suggested by Show Boat…the Musical Play. Like that work, the show featured all the melodic richness of a Romantic Operetta, but blended it with the kind of serious storytelling and gritty psychological realism you might find in a great play. However, in contrast to Show Boat, which had been a grand, sweeping epic with no one human protagonist, Carousel focuses tightly on a small group of characters and their feelings, making it even more moving and, not insignificantly, much easier to imitate.\n\nIn addition, the score was so loaded with elaborate musical scenes that, if not for the fact that it still contained a significant amount of dialogue, it would have qualified for Opera status. Among the most notable of these are the twelve-minute duet sequence “If I Loved You” in which the central lovers connect and trade worldviews through impossibly lyrical arioso and a heartbreaking chorus that would become a huge popular hit outside of the show. Another is a scene early in Act Two that moves from the bitterly comic “Geraniums in the Winder” through the ruefully philosophical Folk pastiche “Stonecutters Cut It on Stone” into the devastating credo of the show’s heroine, “What’s the Use of Wond’rin”, in which she affirms her devotion to her ne’er-do-well husband despite knowing full well that the situation will end badly for everyone involved.\n\nIn fact, the central number of the score, “Soliloquy”, is so ambitious and psychologically insightful that it would seem unusual even in a classical Opera…apart from a few of Verdi and Wagner’s musical monologues, precious few ‘real’ operas had ever contained an aria that goes through so many varied and complex emotions in the space of a single number.\n\nSome people right now are complaining that Carousel is “offensive” because it suggests that a domestic abuser is actually capable of being redeemed, an idea that is anathema to the current crop of politically correct thinkers. But frankly, Carousel was here before those objections were raised, and like all immortal works of art, it will still be here long after that kind of thinking falls out of fashion again. You might as well argue that the sky is offensive.\n\nFinally, we have Allegro, the last of the truly genre-defining shows of the Forties, and the only one to be generally considered a failure (it actually ran longer and made more money than Cabin in the Sky, but history doesn’t tend to perceive it that way). With a second-tier score by Rodgers and Hammerstein that nonetheless managed to contain several excellent numbers, this show set the template for every major feature of the modern Concept Musical, from the symbolic presentation to the fragmented score to the guiding hand of a visionary director-choreographer. While it didn’t actually achieve its goal of a seamlessly integrated production very well, it provided the rough model that, a generation later, would be perfected in such works as the collaborations between Stephen Sondheim and Harold Prince. Moreover, as the first clear example of the Heartbreaker Flop, it set the precedent that you don’t need success or perfection to make Broadway history, which is a more important achievement than it may sound to some of the Broadway neophytes out there.\n\nAllegro’s main flaw was its archetypical fable-like structure, with stock symbolic characters rather than actual human beings and a purposefully predictable plot, which is a valid model but not really Rodgers and Hammerstein’s forte. The score did manage to produce four modest hits at the time…three ballads, “A Fellow Needs a Girl”, “So Far”, and “You Are Never Away”, and a jazzy, ruefully humorous torch song, “The Gentleman is a Dope”. The latter has actually hung on as a genuine standard, and is probably the show’s primary legacy in popular culture at this point.\n\nThe last four of these shows were particularly key in reinventing how Broadway made use of dance. Oklahoma and Carousel each programmed one Tchaikovsky-style dramatic ballet into their action, On the Town programmed several, and Allegro was infused with dance throughout, pioneering the art of the director-choreographer. This important development, of which the visionary Agnes De Mille was the frontrunner, paved the way for such future giants as Jerome Robbins, Gower Champion, Michael Kidd, Joe Layton and Bob Fosse.\n\nIt’s worth noting that around this time a whole new Musical medium, the Movie Musical, was born. And strangely enough, it all started with Al Jolson. Jolson had innumerable stage and film vehicles, but only produced two works of lasting artistic importance, both of which came after he had transferred from Broadway to Hollywood.\n\nThe first, The Jazz Singer, which was actually the very first musical movie back in 1927, had more substance than any of Jolson’s other vehicles, stage or film…but then, it was based on an actual play. Its half-silent, half-sound construction can seem a little odd to modern audiences, and the two scenes where Jolson performs in his trademark blackface have made the film somewhat controversial among younger viewers, but Jolson’s sung performances are sublime. His performances of “Toot, Toot, Tootsie”, “Blue Skies” and “Mammy” have become some of the most iconic moments in all of musical film, but perhaps even more moving are the film’s softer songs, “Dirty Hands! Dirty Face!” (about a father’s love for his son) and “Mother of Mine, I Still Have You”. And the story is still engaging and involving to this day…so much so that both the hit Eighties Musical The Tap Dance Kid and one of the most iconic animated musical shorts of all time, “I Love To Sing-a”, would be built around essentially the same story. Also, while the songs may not be integrated into the story in the modern sense, they are certainly connected to its themes, with “Dirty Hands! Dirty Face!”, “Mother of Mine”, and “Mammy” all centering around the film’s core themes of parental and filial love.\n\nThe other true Jolson masterpiece was Hallelujah, I’m a Bum, a romanticized portrayal of the homeless ‘bums’ of Central Park during the depression. There would be another musical years later that attempted the same thing, Subways are for Sleeping, but this film pulled off the idea with infinitely greater success. Here, Jolson portrays the so-called “Mayor of Central Park”, the ringleader of a collection of bums who have turned their way of life into a philosophy. He falls in love with a beautiful amnesiac he dubs “Angel”, and even takes a job to support her, only to find out she is really the fiancée of the Mayor of New York, played by Frank Morgan.\n\nThe Rodgers and Hart score seems to draw a surprisingly heavy influence from Twenties Operetta: while there are a few self-contained songs, including two standards (“You Are Too Beautiful” and the title-song), much of the score consists of elaborate musical scenes built out of rhymed dialogue and short song fragments. The film also features perhaps the saddest ending I’ve ever encountered in a Musical where nobody actually dies.\n\nUnfortunately, other than Rose of Washington Square (where he played only a supporting role), most of Jolson’s later film vehicles were much like his stage shows…that is, paper-thin excuses for their star to perform his trademark shtick. The movies by Jolson’s closest peer, Eddie Cantor, were much the same. Of his films, the most remembered today is Whoopee. It has a very amusing performance from Cantor, very enjoyable musical numbers, and makes no sense whatsoever. Cantor’s trademark brand of comedy has aged rather better than Jolson’s (although he still spends a chunk of the film in blackface), but his films (and the stage shows that preceded them) were still essentially empty vehicles for schtick.\n\nStill, overall, the earliest film musicals, such as 42nd Street and the other Busby Berkeley backstagers, had more interesting scripts than most musical films from later in the decade, because no-one had yet pigeonholed film musicals as a genre the way they had with stage musicals at the time, and a musical movie was pretty much written the same way as any other movie. These films were written as tough, hard-boiled comedy-dramas smothered in the ambience of the Great Depression, and featured far more realistic and grounded plots and characterization than the stage Musical Comedies of the day. They seem somewhat cliché-ridden today, but in this case that’s mostly because they invented the formulas that have since become clichés. They are splendid films, without a doubt, and Busby Berkeley’s mind-blowing choreography for them provided the basis for every filmed production number since, but they have one drawback as far as the development of the musical genre is concerned: their scores were largely limited to generic (if often excellent) pop tunes delivered diagetically rather than as spontaneous musical expression, and so, for all their often magnificent music and choreography, they weren’t really ‘musicals’ in the modern sense of the word.\n\nTwo other stars who specialized in diagetic film Musicals also specialized in pushing boundaries, to the point where between them they almost single-handedly brought about the creation of Hollywood’s self-censoring body, the Hays Code. Mae West burst onto the Hollywood scene with She Done Him Wrong, an adaptation of a semi-musical play called Diamond Lil that West had written and starred in on Broadway (and that was so controversial in its own right that even pre-Hays Code Hollywood wouldn’t allow her to acknowledge it as the source for her movie at the time). It stars West as a wise-cracking master manipulator who uses her sexuality to get whatever she wants and who literally gets away with murder in the end, but does it with such elegantly risque style that it’s impossible to resist her (think a smarter, more savvy version of Chicago‘s Roxie Hart). The film featured a score made up of period standards delivered in West’s character’s nightclub act, most prominently the traditional folk song “Frankie and Johnny”, which had already been West’s signature number for some time (it was in the play too). Her later movies were essentially retreads of She Done Him Wrong…the honest-to-God truth is that West really only ever had one play in her. In fact, she arguably only had one joke in her…responding to literally everything with a deadpan, ambiguously smutty one-liner…but it was a good enough joke that she managed to build a pretty impressive career on it, I’ll give her that.\n\nMarlene Dietrich’s most famous film, made while she was still in Germany, was The Blue Angel. The story, a subversive deconstruction of conventional German morality, tells of the gradual degradation and eventual destruction of an elderly Professor due to his sexual infatuation with an erotic nightclub singer played by Dietrich. The score consists mostly of numbers at the titular nightclub, including Dietrich’s signature standard “Falling in Love Again (Can’t Help It)”, which is heard in two renditions, one gentle and vaguely wistful, the second a cold, brutal expression of her power. The music also includes an ironic rendition of “Üb’ immer Treu und Redlichkeit”, an old German standard with a melody drawn from Mozart which was then regarded as emblematic of the traditional German “morality” the film is trying to subvert.\n\nThe film, which exists in two versions, one entirely in German and one mostly in English, is surprisingly sh"
