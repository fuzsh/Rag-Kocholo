        "text": "AN INSTANT NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER\n\nA USA TODAY BESTSELLER\n\nBook Blurb:\n\nWhen Hazel Sharp, daughter of Mirror Lake’s longtime local detective, unexpectedly inherits her childhood home, she’s warily drawn back to the town—and people—she left behind almost a decade earlier. But Hazel’s not the only relic of the past to return: a drought has descended on the region, and as the water level in the lake drops, long-hidden secrets begin to emerge…including evidence that may help finally explain the mystery of her mother’s disappearance.\n\nRiveting and suspenseful, Daughter of Mine is Megan Miranda’s best novel yet, filled with “delicious twists, dark secrets, and a deadly past” (Ashley Elston, New York Times bestselling author of First Lie Wins) that will keep you listening late into the night.\n\nMy Review:\n\nNot my first dance with Megan Miranda and her style of writing–slow burn dark family secrets held tightly to the chest with closed fists and set determined jaw. I found much the same in The Last to Vanish.\n\nThe first and most obvious twist in this novel is the way the author sets out the timeline and chapters, fusing Hazel Sharp’s story with an area-wide ongoing drought and beginning each chapter with the number of days without rain. Indeed, it’s changing the landscape of her childhood home and Mirror Lake is now revealing secrets that directly impact her.\n\nHazel has returned after her father dies to discover, and to her brother’s shock, that he left his home and property to her—not them. She is bewildered; they are disgusted. It’s not as if they were ever close as step-siblings.\n\nHer father was a respected law enforcement officer of the community when her mother up and left—never to return. The devastation and feelings of abandonment have never really left. But the cars being exposed by receding waters have opened a shocking new twist to the story—what really happened to her mother?\n\nClever, the way the chapters add atmospheric tension to the plot as Hazel grapples with her brothers over the home and now whether or not her dad might have had something to do with her mother’s disappearance. The heat causes rise to short tempers; everyone is on edge.\n\nWhile there was interest in the storyline, I could not fully engage with Hazel nor wrap my head around the backstories of her brothers…(I don’t remember them ever being designated as “step”). So many family secrets, not much of a bond. She and her mother came rather late in their family story.\n\nLose attention until the next little twist, then re-engage. It’s a weird family dynamic. Once the rain begins the pace rushes into denouement and it’s over. Eh, okay. If you are an MM fan, then you may find this of interest with the way she’s noted chapter headings or you appreciate her build of tension. I just needed it to move a little faster, I guess.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my honest thoughts.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Three point Five Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Psychological Thrillers, Suspense\n\nPublisher: Simon & Schuster Audio\n\nASIN: B0C7YD57GS\n\nListening Length: 10 hrs 27 mins\n\nNarrator: Inés del Castillo\n\nPublication Date: April 9, 2024\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Link: Daughter of Mine [Amazon-US]\n\nAmazon-UK\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nThe Author: Megan Miranda is the New York Times bestselling author of All the Missing Girls; The Perfect Stranger; The Last House Guest, a Reese Witherspoon Book Club pick; The Girl from Widow Hills; Such a Quiet Place; and The Last to Vanish. She has also written several books for young adults. She grew up in New Jersey, graduated from MIT, and lives in North Carolina with her husband and two children.\n\nHer next book, The Only Survivors, will be published on April 11th, 2023.\n\nFollow @MeganLMiranda on Instagram, @AuthorMeganMiranda on Facebook, or visit http://www.meganmiranda.com\n\n©2024 V Williams\n\nHeadphones courtesy Racool Studio\n\nBeach Town #1\n\nBook Blurb:\n\nGreer Hennessy needs palm trees.\n\nAs a movie location scout, picture-perfect is the name of the game. But her last project literally went up in flames, and her career is on the verge of flaming out. Greer has been given one more chance, if she can find the perfect undiscovered beach hideaway for a big-budget movie. She zeroes in on a sleepy Florida town called Cypress Key.\n\nBut Eben Thibadeaux, the town’s mayor, objects to Greer’s plan. A lifelong resident of Cypress Key, Eben wants the town to be revitalized, not commercialized. Greer has a way of making things happen, regardless of obstacles. And Greer and Eb are way too attracted to one another for either of them to see reason.\n\nBetween an ambitious director and his entourage―including a spoiled “It Boy” lead actor―who parachute into town, a conniving local ex-socialite, and a cast of local fangirls and opportunists who catch the movie bug, nothing is going to be the same in Cypress Key. Now Greer is forced to make some hard choices: about the people and the town she’s come to care about, and about her own life. True love is only for the movies, right? Can Greer find a way to be the heroine in her own life story? Told with inimitable heart and humor, Mary Kay Andrews’ Beach Town is the perfect summer destination.\n\nMy Review:\n\nAh, the ole hate-to-love trope apparently working well a decade ago and a favorite of the romance genre. Yes, it must be getting mighty cold down below if I’m reading a romance novel.\n\nI like the unique concept of a movie location scout for a big picture production searching for the perfect location of a small sea coastal town setting. In this case, the MC stumbles upon Cypress Key, a seedy little town past its heyday in the Florida Keys.\n\nGreer Hennessy discovers the romance of Florida comes with heat, humidity, and bugs—the giant, flying-at-you palmettos who look like monster cockroaches. Nasty things. They have little barbs on their feet so when they land on you, they can latch on. Yeah, been there, done that.\n\nBut the location turns out to supply just about everything on their must-have list, including an old building to blow up for the climax. The problem, of course, is Eben Thibadeaux, the town mayor and engineer who doesn’t want anything blown up. He wants to fix up. The owner has other ideas.\n\nI loved the cast and crew, CJ is a hoot, and the enthusiastic director is so authentic you can see him yelling directions through a megaphone. The main character is a damaged soul, childhood and all that, and Eben (since I was listening to the audiobook) sounded like Ed every time it was his dialogue or referred to and, again, did not wholly engage with him.\n\nIt’s a fun little book, getting into the nitty gritty of what it takes to be a location manager, the constant calls of problems, not the least of which is the spoiled and entitled young male star, full of himself.\n\nI thought it was engaging, entertaining, and I enjoyed the sense of humor, but just couldn’t buy into the conclusion and resolution. Fanciful, it went overboard into disbelief. Other than that, I’d recommend the audiobook ably narrated by Kathleen McInerney.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my honest thoughts.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Four Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Small Town & Rural Fiction, Women’s Fiction\n\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio\n\nASIN: B00UM2PW3Q\n\nListening Length: 14 hrs 8 mins\n\nNarrator: Kathleen McInerney\n\nPublication Date: May 19, 2015\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Link: Beach Town [Amazon]\n\nThe Author: MARY KAY ANDREWS is the New York Times bestselling author of more than 30 novels (including Bright Lights, Big Christmas; The Homewreckers; The Santa Suit; The Newcomer; Hello, Summer; Sunset Beach; The High Tide Club; The Weekenders; Beach Town; Save the Date; Christmas Bliss; Ladies’ Night; Spring Fever; and Summer Rental, all from St. Martin’s Press, as well as The Fixer Upper; Deep Dish; Savannah Breeze; Blue Christmas; Hissy Fit; Little Bitty Lies; and Savannah Blues, all Harper Collins), and one cookbook, The Beach House Cookbook.\n\nA native of St. Petersburg, Florida, she earned a B.A. in journalism from The University of Georgia (go Dawgs!). After a 14-year career working as a reporter at newspapers including The Savannah Morning News, The Marietta Journal, and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, where she spent the final ten years of her career, she left journalism in 1991 to write fiction.\n\nHer first novel, Every Crooked Nanny, was published in 1992 by HarperCollins.

In between cooking, spoiling her grandkids, and plotting her next novel, Mary Kay is an intrepid treasure hunter whose favorite pastime is junking and fixing up old houses.\n\n©2024 V Williams\n\nBest Books of the Year So Far 2024\n\nBook Blurb:\n\nWhen Lauren returns home to her flat in London late one night, she is greeted at the door by her husband, Michael. There’s only one problem—she’s not married. She’s never seen this man before in her life. But according to her friends, her much-improved decor, and the photos on her phone, they’ve been together for years.\n\nAs Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you’ve taken the right path? When do you stop trying to do better and start actually living?\n\nMy Review:\n\nWhen was the last time you willingly accepted a debut novel and actually enjoyed it? Well, okay, maybe not that rare, but this is one I think you might.\n\nFirst, this is a unique plot device and one that has you nodding your head and grinning. Definitely light satire, humorous and chuckle worthy moments begin when Lauren discovers a husband in her flat in London that was a real surprise. She wasn’t married.\n\nHer friends, and there are several constants, confirm they’ve been married for a little while. Just look at the photos. Decoŕ definitely looks different.\n\nWell, the good news: She hasn’t gone crazy but when he changes a lightbulb in the attic, Michael is replaced by a new husband. Maybe she needs to reconsider the crazy part.\n\nAnd then, OMG, she runs the gamut! Right age and education but dense. Bore you to tears but the body of Adonis. Health nut, gamer, sports nut, gambler, drinker, wondering eye. What if she found the one she wanted to keep? Could she keep him out of the attic?\n\nIt’s light-hearted and not to be taken seriously although there are a few interesting philosophical questions to ponder. The MC is not fully developed, the reader doesn’t get the depth and certainly of none of the husbands. The attic is apparently “magic.” We don’t know why. There is a solid twist later in the novel but at a reasonable length of time you’ll demand a point to it all.\n\nOf course, I greatly enjoyed the narration of the audiobook—done very well, accents and all. Does Lauren finally pick a husband, warts and all, and stick with him? Do you still care? How does this ring road ever end? You’ll have to read it.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my honest thoughts.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Four Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Humorous Fiction & Satire, Humorous Fiction, Family Life Fiction\n\nPublisher: Random House Audio\n\nASIN: B0CDCP4FCT\n\nListening Length: 10 hrs 30 mins\n\nNarrator: Miranda Raison\n\nPublication Date: April 2, 2024\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Links: The Husbands [Amazon-US]\n\nAmazon-UK\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nThe Author: HOLLY GRAMAZIO is a writer, game designer and curator from Adelaide, currently based in London.

By 11:00am, he was clinging to life, unconscious and suffocating from toxic exposure to cyanide in a tank that was supposed to contain only mud and water.\n\nEPA Special Agent Joseph Hilldorfer was tasked with finding out what really happened on that horrific day in Soda Springs, Idaho, but the answers would not be easily uncovered. For more than four years Hilldorfer, his partner Bob Wojnicz, and a force of top-ranking U.S. attorneys struggled to expose the disturbing truths behind the tragedy, but would their efforts be enough to put the man responsible, Allan Elias, behind bars?\n\nDugoni, a New York Times bestselling author known for his heart-pounding legal thrillers, and Hilldorfer, the agent who lived and breathed the Dominguez case, pen a compulsively readable work that is every bit as enthralling as fiction, yet is alarmingly true.\n\nMy Review:\n\nMy dip into a non-fiction book this year co-authored by Robert Dugoni and Joe Hilldorfer, the latter an EPA special agent in charge of the investigation in Soda Springs, Idaho. Of course, my ears perked up when I started hearing several of these little rural towns, out in the middle of nowhere, small bedroom communities for a major local industry.\n\nIdaho is riddled with heavy mineral and mining sites as well as hot springs and mineral waters, such as this town’s namesake, Soda Springs. The first time we discovered the little town with the soda water, we couldn’t believe it until we tasted it.\n\nThe opening of the book reads like a Dugoni suspense thriller with the two young men being told to clean out the sludge in the tank, unaware it contained deadly cyanide gases, sans any protection.\n\nThen the narrative morphs into textbook presentation and switches POV to Hilldorfer. Hilldorfer is still testing the EPA waters with violations of environmental laws lacking the serious level of meted justice it deserves.\n\nThe presentation veered into technical terms, detailed presentations, environmental laws, and examples of violations successfully tried with disappointing lightweight sentences.\n\nLots of characters, of course, contributed to the storyline, often preceded by personal background, education, and experience of the contributions of their successful (or failed) prosecutions and the reasons. The pacing slowed as the years advanced with little advancement and the necessity of returning to the courts yet again.\n\nThe case against Allan Elias, the owner responsible for the deadly and willful assignment, proved a slippery slope as his attorneys were perceived to find one loophole after another and Elias a bottomless pit of money to fight all allegations. Meanwhile, the survivor of the cyanide suffered permanent and life-changing losses and was racking up thousands of dollars in medical bills.\n\nAn interesting look into the evolving EPA coming into power and the progress made in protecting our environment while acknowledging the extent of work still to be done.\n\nDid they ever send Elias to prison? Did Dominguez survive?\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my honest thoughts.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Four Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Biographies of Lawyers & Judges, Lawyer & Judge Biographies, True Crime Biographies\n\nPublisher: Tantor Audio\n\nASIN: B06XGYM4JG\n\nListening Length: 12 hrs 48 mins\n\nNarrator: Tom Perkins\n\nPublication Date: March 21, 2017\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Link: The Cyanide Canary [Amazon]\n\nThe Authors:\n\nRobert Dugoni is the critically acclaimed New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post and #1 Amazon bestselling author of the Tracy Crosswhite police series set in Seattle, which has sold more than 10 million books worldwide.

Bryce and USA Today bestselling author Eliza Knight collaborate on a brilliant novel that uncovers the boundary-breaking, genuine friendship between Ella Fitzgerald, the Queen of Jazz, and iconic movie star Marilyn Monroe.\n\nOne woman was recognized as the premiere singer of her era with perfect pitch and tireless ambition.\n\nOne woman was the most glamorous star in Hollywood, a sex symbol who took the world by storm.\n\nAnd their friendship was fast and firm…\n\n1952: Ella Fitzgerald is a renowned jazz singer whose only roadblock to longevity is society’s attitude toward women and race. Marilyn Monroe’s star is rising despite ongoing battles with movie studio bigwigs and boyfriends. When she needs help with her singing, she wants only the best—and the best is the brilliant Ella Fitzgerald. But Ella isn’t a singing teacher and declines—then the two women meet, and to everyone’s surprise but their own, they become fast friends.\n\nOn the surface, what could they have in common? Yet each was underestimated by the men in their lives—husbands, managers, hangers-on. And both were determined to gain. Each fought for professional independence and personal agency in a time when women were expected to surrender control to those same men.\n\nThis novel reveals and celebrates their surprising bond over a decade and serves as a poignant reminder of how true friendship can cross differences to bolster and sustain us through haunting heartbreak and wild success.\n\nMy Review:\n\nMarilyn died in 1962, the year we were married. Many historical events happened the same year and I must confess many of them were lost in my own life concerns at the time. Born in 1926, Marilyn was thirty-six. Born in 1917, Ella passed in 1996 at 79 years. Both achieved legendary status, and while it is true that they did form a friendship, this is a fiction accounting of that friendship.\n\nAt times, the palaver got so thick, I completely discounted the incident. Indeed, it’s explained at the end of the book that (remember) it is a work of fiction.\n\nWhat isn’t fiction is that given the time in the civil rights movement, Monroe’s support of Ella could have hurt her career which was already flourishing. It was because Marilyn was up for a pic in which she was to sing that she began hounding Ella to coach her as Ella was admittedly one of her singing idols.\n\nElla was well-known and successful but struggled for the level of acceptance and the better gigs as that of Lena Horne, Dinah Washington, and Nina Simone. And Ella was a big woman. The Mocambo wanted small and pretty; Marilyn helped her get into the Mocambo.\n\nWhile I was fully engaged in the voice of Ella in the audiobook, I found the voice of Marilyn annoying at times, cloying, sure she did not use her public persona voice during all the private conversations.\n\nAn audiobook, I hoped for a tidbit of one of Ella’s songs. And then there was the iconic Happy Birthday song to President Kennedy by Marilyn—that breathy, sexy song so familiar to generations of fans.\n\nThe book jumps between reflections of Ella and Marilyn, sometimes creating a disjointed narrative, Ella coming over as most authentic. I enjoyed the different stories of both ladies and their families, including the account of Ella’s Aunt Virginia! Marilyn’s story inevitably covered failed marriages, including the extremely physically abusive Joe DiMaggio marriage, although Arthur Miller—while not physically abusive—swung just as hard to the mental side of abusive and was just as damaging.\n\n“There is something in the bond of an honest friendship between women that a lover can never breach and that fake friends will never understand.”\n\nTo her credit, Ella didn’t drink, smoke, or do drugs and that became a heavy wedge between their friendship. While Ella decried Marilyn’s increasing dependency on drugs and booze, she couldn’t be a part of it.\n\nLots of literary license here, still there are tidbits to be gleaned between dramatic recreations or fictionalized accounts of what may have or could have happened. The authors spent untold hours in research. Perhaps the most telling is the insight given in the epilogue.\n\nIf you enjoy biographical accounts, historical accounts of some of our famous personalities, you might very well enjoy this collaboration.

The ultimate cover-up. How do you solve a murder with no useable evidence?\n\nPrivate detective Nils Shapiro is focused on forgetting his ex-wife and keeping warm during another Minneapolis winter when a former colleague, neighboring Edina Police Detective Anders Ellegaard, calls with the impossible.\n\nSuburban divorcée Maggie Somerville was found murdered in her bedroom, her body covered with the dust from hundreds of emptied vacuum cleaner bags, all potential DNA evidence obscured by the calculating killer.\n\nDigging into Maggie’s cell-phone records, Nils finds that the most frequently called number belongs to a mysterious young woman whose true identity could shatter the Somerville family – but could she be guilty of murder?\n\nAfter the FBI demands that Nils drop the case, Nils and Ellegaard are forced to take their investigation underground, where the case grows as murky as the contents of the vacuum cleaner bags. Is this a strange case of domestic violence or something with far-reaching, sinister implications?\n\nMy Review:\n\nOkay, yes. I was looking for an audiobook, a nice mystery, and the blurb sounded interesting. And of course, dropping the Emmy Award-winning Seinfeld writer’s name helped. (As it happens, however, that show was not one I watched.)\n\nThe setting is Minnesota in the winter and I was reading it in the upper Midwest before we slowly ground into spring, so thought I might identify. Only so far though. Minnesota is a whole nother winter.\n\nI’m not sure what it was. Yes, you have to say covering a body in vacuum cleaner dust patiently gathered from hundreds of vacuum cleaner bags is unusual. Even Nils Shapiro, the “Scandinavian Jew” might have been considered an unusual character, certainly considering he still pined after his ex. (I often wondered why then she is an “ex.”)\n\nJust not one that really grabbed me. Nils is a contradiction alright. He was trying for the police department when there was a change in the budget, so he managed to create a private detective agency. I guess he found a modicum of success as he is called by a police detective buddy to help him with his vacuum dust case.\n\nFor one, there are too many degrees of coincidence. Small town—okay—I get it. Everybody knows everybody or is a relative. There are red herrings, twists, and the plot involves Nils the man as much as the case. It isn’t too hard to figure out the perp. An easy read (or listen) and entertaining but it just didn’t have the tension sufficient for me to get excited.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library.

Cork O’Connor loses his job after being blamed for a tragedy on the local Anishinaabe Indian reservation. But he must set aside his personal demons when a young boy goes missing on the same day a judge commits suicide—and no one but O’Connor suspects foul play.\n\nMy Review:\n\nCork O’Connor is complicated and conflicted, so much going on in his life following the loss of his job as sheriff, his marriage, and the separation of his kids. Now to add fuel to the fire, a judge is found, said to have committed suicide and a young newspaper boy goes missing the same day. His mother calls Cork for help.\n\nThe judge was the last stop the boy was known to have made and to boot, the main proponent of Cork’s recall.\n\nBoy, howdy, nothing like just heaping on the problems, huh? Cork may no longer be sheriff and is not welcome in the investigation, but couldn’t help but notice an inconsistency or two with the pronouncement of suicide. He’s pretty sure it wasn’t.\n\nCork wears his emotions on his sleeve right now and he’s more than a little concerned regarding the whereabouts of the boy.\n\nIt’s Minnesota.\n\nIt’s winter!\n\nI can easily get lost in the atmospheric descriptions of the area and the people. Rugged even in good weather, the search is not easy. Lucky he has the support of the nearby tribe of the Anishinaabe. I enjoy the way the author taps into the local native lore.\n\nThe characters are well-developed and complex. Cork, a former Chicago cop has his dreams of an idyllic rural family village disintegrate before his eyes. He and his wife grow apart and he is reduced to scraping by. Being estranged from his wife, he begins to see another woman. There are twists and turns, taps into the local’s secrets.\n\nOf course, there are technical issues, not the least of which is that he has no authority to investigate anything and we end up with a high body count—which I’m not always thrilled about. Still, I enjoy his writing style and following The River We Remember that I loved, I went looking for another book and found this series—all nineteen of them. Thought I’d start with the first. A good start.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library.
