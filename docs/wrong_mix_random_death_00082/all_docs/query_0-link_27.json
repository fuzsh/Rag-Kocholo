        "text": "Charlie Chaplin once said: “A day without laughter, is a day wasted.” He certainly understood the power of a good belly laugh. The silent-film era actor performed in dozens of comedies, entertaining audiences with his madcap character the Little Tramp. Along the way, he became a Hollywood icon, and stands today—with his tipped bowler hat and bowed bamboo cane—as one of cinema’s most cherished entertainers.\n\nChaplin’s rise to superstardom has inspired a number of movies and books—including Smile: How Young Charlie Chaplin Taught the World to Laugh (and Cry), a dazzling new children’s book from Candlewick Press that chronicles Chaplin’s life. In celebration of Smile’s release, we selected a few of our favorite Hollywood biographies and books about performers written for young readers. From Audrey Hepburn and the Little Tramp to a wondrous biography of the queen of magic, these entertaining reads are sure to delight book lovers and film buffs of all ages."
