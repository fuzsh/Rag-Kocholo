        "text": "Ella.\n\nSimply Ella.\n\nHer full name was Ella Jane Fitzgerald. She has been called the First Lady of Jazz, as well as the First Lady of Song. She has fronted bands led by the likes of Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Chick Webb among others and even led Chick Webb’s orchestra after he passed away. Her discography serves as a thorough and complete timeline of the history of Jazz, going as it does from the era of Big Band and Swing, all the way through Bebop, Gospel, Soul and Rhythm and Blues. She has had a myriad of national honours bestowed upon her, hugging and shaking the hands of several presidents along the way. She is known for her ability to use her voice as a musical instrument via the technique known as scat singing which she did not originate but certainly perfected and pioneered. She gained renown on the stages of the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem and on the stage of the Apollo Theatre, where she was one of the very first Amateur Night winners. Shy and demure by nature but fiercely strong and proud in spirit, Ella Fitzgerald lived a life without equal in the world of music. It is the mark of a life well lived when the mere mention of her name brings a smile to everyone’s lips. But that is the case with the subject of today’s post. She was all things to many people but in the end, all she needed to be was herself. This is the story of Ella Fitzgerald…an absolute legend, a dynamic performer, a wonderful woman simply known as Ella. Enjoy.\n\nElla Fitzgerald is someone who I always viewed in a grandmotherly way when I was growing up. Ella was already entering her fifties when I entered the world. Thus, when I was old enough to understand the world around me and appreciate the people who were the leading personalities of my time, Ella Fitzgerald was already in her senior years. As a result, my initial impressions were always of this smiling, polite and friendly woman who made guest appearances on all of the TV variety shows of my youth. She seemed to me like someone’s grandmother who, when your own parents weren’t looking, would slip you some money, give you a warm hug and tell you to keep that secret exchange to yourself. The other impression that she left upon this young man’s mind was that she rarely sang normal song lyrics. Watching her on TV in the 1970s was my introduction to scat singing. I had no idea that she was using her voice in time with the horn section of the orchestras with which she appeared. It all seemed quaint and it brought a smile to my face and that was enough for me. It wasn’t until I was much older and had more life experiences that I was able to look back upon those times that I watched Ella Fitzgerald and begin to appreciate what it had taken for her to stand there, smiling so freely and singing so effortlessly. Or so it appeared. As it turned out, I was watching a woman for whom grace emanated freely but for whom life had never been as easy as she made it seem. The true legends like Ella Fitzgerald always make the impossible seem possible and, if she was anything at all, Ella Fitzgerald was definitely a legend. Here is her story.\n\nElla Jane Fitzgerald was born in 1917. Her parents were never married and, as such, Ella grew up with a family structure that can best be described as fluid. Ella Fitzgerald was always a good student in school and soon developed a love of music. Unfortunately, because her family life was unstable, she moved frequently and rarely stayed at one school long enough to be noticed. In situations such as hers, it is possible to develop survival instincts while, at the same time, feel the weight of self-esteem issues bearing down on you at all times. The dichotomy of personal developmental issues was something that came to mark Ella Fitzgerald’s personality for the rest of her life. Shy on the outside but strong and determined on the inside was how she came to be perceived by those who did take the time to get to know her. But finding those people took Ella a while. Unfortunately for her, Ella’s mother was killed in a car accident when she was still just a teenager. For a few years, she was raised by a man who was her stepfather. There were rumours that this man did not do right by young Ella. During her time in his care, she lost interest in school and began hanging out with unsavory characters on the street. The end result of this was that she was arrested and sent to a form of juvenile detention for orphans. When she emerged from that stint, she moved in with her aunt in Harlem. That move would set the stage for what was to become a much better life.\n\nAfter leaving the detention centre, Ella Fitzgerald returned to the streets but this time it was the streets of Harlem. And instead of engaging in illegal activities, Ella tried to earn money for herself by busking on street corners. Soon enough, word of her strong and powerful singing voice began to circulate. At some point, the people who were putting coins in her jar began mentioning an amateur talent show at the Apollo Theatre that was offering cash prize money to the weekly winner. Eventually, Ella Fitzgerald worked up the courage to go down to the Apollo Theatre and sign up for that week’s competition. Initially, Ella had decided to go on stage and dance. But prior to her turn coming up, she watched a set of sisters dance up a storm and thought to herself that she could never do as well as that. So, when her name was called, she felt as though she had no other choice but to sing. So she did. When she first walked on stage, she was rumpled and disheveled from having come straight from busking. The crowd booed her at first sight. But when she began to sing, she instantly won them over. She was even asked for an encore. Ella Fitzgerald was declared to be the weekly winner of Amateur Night at The Apollo. However, because of the state of her appearance, she was only given the cash award and was denied the second half of the prize which was a week’s contract to perform at the theatre. With $25.00 in her pocket, Ella Fitzgerald left the Apollo Theatre and returned to the streets.\n\nUnbeknownst to young Ella, the fortunes in her life had already begun to change. Only a few blocks away from the Apollo Theatre sat a building that had become recognized as “the heartbeat of Harlem”. That building was The Savoy Ballroom. *(you can read all about the Savoy Ballroom in a previous post here). The house band at the Savoy Ballroom was led by a bandleader known as Chick Webb. Webb was known for recognizing talent and helping those musicians in his orchestra to shine, provided that they gave him their best effort every time that they all played. As the 1930 rolled along, Swing and Big band music were all the rage. The genre known as Jazz was finding its feet. Orchestras such as Chick Webb’s were leading the way forward and had become popular on a national scale. This popularity was an important reason that Jazz grew into the mighty genre of music that it did, rather than remaining centralizing in Harlem and area. Many big bands of that era employed female singers to help add a little sex appeal to their shows, as well as providing lyrical accompaniment for the musicians in the orchestra as they played. As such, Chick Webb was always on the lookout for new talent. So it was that one day he was asked if he knew about a young ragamuffin singer who had just won the Amateur Night talent show at the Apollo Theatre. Webb did not know Ella Fitzgerald at that time. A meeting was soon arranged. Initially, Chick Webb was not impressed by Ella based upon her appearance. Those who performed at the Savoy Ballroom were the epitome of style and fashion. Ella Fitzgerald, at that time, looked dirty and unkempt. But then she sang for Chick Webb and he melted. He told her that his orchestra was playing at a university dance and that if she could clean herself up and make herself look presentable then, she could come along. He promised her that if she could wow the kids at this show that he would consider having her sing at the Savoy Ballroom. Needless to say, Ella Fitzgerald cleaned up well, sang even better and, true to his word, was offered a contract to sing in the Savoy Ballroom by Chick Webb. Not only was that initial contract offered but, not long afterward, that probationary contract turned into a permanent contract and Ella Fitzgerald became the official lead singer for Chick Webb and his Orchestra. Furthermore, they got along so famously that she and Webb began writing and recording songs together. One of those songs was a reworked nursery rhyme known as “A Tisket, A Tasket” that became Fitzgerald’s first national radio hit. Not long after the release of that song, Chick Webb passed away. The Chick Webb Orchestra members met with Ella Fitzgerald to decide what their next steps should be. From that meeting, it was decided that Ella Fitzgerald herself would assume leadership of the orchestra. Having a woman in such a position of leadership was unprecedented at the time but everyone agreed to follow her lead. She remained as bandleader right up until WWII when the orchestra ceased operations due to the enlistment of many of its members.\n\nIt is important to take a moment and discuss the hit song “A Tisket, A Tasket”. As mentioned, this song is based upon a children’s nursery rhyme. As such, the lyrics of the song are relatively short. If one were to simply adhere to the tune of the song and sing the words as they are written, “A Tisket, A Tasket” would take less than two minutes to sing. However, if you were to go online in search of recordings of this song, you will find many cases where the song’s length approaches even the ten minute mark! That such length is possible highlights the nature of what Jazz music, as an art form, was becoming. People who write about the subject of Jazz frequently point to improvisation as one of its hallmarks. Well, the way you get a ninety second nursery rhyme to last eight to ten minutes is because of improvisation. Not only that, it is improvisation that makes musical sense. That is where the genius of Ella Fitzgerald comes into play. In a moment I am going to provide you with a link to a performance of “A Tisket, A Tasket” by Ella Fitzgerald, this time from 1979 at the Montreaux Jazz festival, playing with Count Basie and His Orchestra. In this performance, I want you to watch how Ella employs scat singing to augment the instruments being employed behind her. As she scat sings, she is not actually singing the song, she is using her voice in an orchestral manner as another instrument in a room filled with players. As the performance evolves, you will get to watch as various orchestra members get their individual moments to improvise. As the final minutes approach, she launches into the actual song lyrics, all of the soloists play as an ensemble, the whole orchestra begins to cook and the result is something simply phenomenal! This is the essence of Jazz. You can watch this performance of “A TIsket, A Tasket” by clicking here.\n\nAn event such as WWII changed the lives of many and derailed the careers of some of the most talented artists the world has ever seen. But that was not the case with Ella Fitzgerald. In a way, the dissolution of the Chick Webb Orchestra in the early 1940s freed Ella Fitgerald to explore new avenues of artistic expression. By the end of the 1930s, Big Band and Swing music was on the decline. After WWII, Bebop became the cool new kid in class. Not surprisingly, Ella Fitzgerald recorded several new hit songs in the Bebop style, helping to popularize a new subgenre of Jazz. One such song was called “Flying Home”. This was the song that really introduced the world to Ella’s personal style of scat singing. While she had been dabbling with it in an attempt to emulate legends such as Louis Armstrong, it was on “Flying Home” that she really turned scat singing into the art form that it became. It was on this song that she began confidently using her voice as an orchestral instrument through which she soloed just as well and for as long as any musician. It is that style of scat singing which shows up in the 1979 “A Tisket, A Tasket” video above. “Flying Home” helped Ella Fitzgerald to carve out a very unique place for herself in the musical universe. But while she was perfecting her performance style in real time in front of a growing national audience, what Ella Fitzgerald needed most was help managing her career. She found that in the form of a white man named Norman Granz.\n\nNorman Granz was born in Moldova and moved to America as a young man. He eventually ended up in the US army during WWII. While there, he served in a department called the Morale Branch. This unit was tasked with arranging entertainment for the fighting men on the front lines. It was during this time that Granz came to see the value of character over the superficial things such as race or religion. Thus, when Granz returned to the civilian world after the end of the war, he did so as a lover of Jazz and as a believer in racial equality. Granz’s first foray into the world of music promotion came when he helped to organize a Jazz concert that became known as Jazz at the Philharmonic. This concert, which ended up becoming an entire series of traveling Jazz-oriented concerts, was one of the first attempts to organize the various Jazz orchestras and performers in such a way as to allow for easier promotion on a larger scale. In taking on such a challenge, Norman Granz took on the task of promoting a genre of music that was still in its infancy. He also took on the enormous challenge inherent in promoting Jazz performers which was racism. One of the first things he did on both fronts was to create his own record label which became known as Verve Records. This allowed Granz to assume control over the music being recorded. It also gave Jazz musicians a safe place to enter into contracts and to promote their own music to the world. It was not long after this that Granz became Ella Fitzgerald’s manager. He remained so until the end of her career. It was through Verve Records that Granz and his roster of Jazz legends (Ella, Count Basie, Duke Ellington, Art Tatum, Stan Getz…..everybody!) sought to formally catalogue and categorize the history of Jazz recordings, as well as branch out into the greater world of standards known as The Great American Songbook. While all of Granz’s artists had their day via Verve Records, Ella Fitzgerald was arguably one of the most successful and notable. In partnership with Granz, Ella Fitzgerald released a series of recordings simply called The Songbook Collection. This was a series of albums in which Ella Fitzgerald would cover the best and most important songs of composers such as Cole Porter and George and Ira Gerswhin, for example. Fitzgerald then released a series of albums in which she paired off with other Jazz legends such as Oscar Petersen, Count Basie and Duke Ellington. In every case, the world of Jazz was brought into the nation’s living rooms in such a way that it elevated the genre to a level comparable with beloved classics by white composers. Norman Granz and Verve Records made Jazz seem safe and accessible and classy. It was a case of a rising tide lifting all boats. All Verve artists gained prestige and access to platforms which would have seemed unimaginable mere decades earlier.\n\nThe second phase of Norman Granz’s mandate was to deal with the odious aspect of racism. Needless to say, the majority of musicians and performers on the Verve Records roster were people of colour. The 1950s and 60s was still a time of legalized segregation in many parts of the United States. It was for that reason that things like the Chitlin’ Circuit existed. You may recall that many concert halls and nightclubs refused to allow black performers to grace their stages, use their dressing rooms or allow black audiences to mix with whites. This forced many performers of colour to have to find safe venues to play. These venues were often smaller and less profitable places but, at least they were places to play. These venues where black performers could play became known as the Chitlin’ Circuit. Well to Norman Granz, the Chitlin’ Circuit symbolized everything he wanted to see changed. In order to do so, he adopted a two-pronged strategy. First of all, his approach to producing, packaging and promoting Jazz music on national radio helped to popularize the artists involved. This, in turn, created a demand for performances by folks such as Ella Fitzgerald and Count Basie and Oscar Petersen. With this public thirst for Jazz established via the radio and Verve’s record album compilations, Granz felt he was in a position to demand some conditions be met before agreeing to showcase his stars. Some of those conditions shook the music world and caused a great deal of backlash against Granz, personally, as well as those on his roster. For example, he demanded equal pay for black musicians and for white. He demanded an end to dressing room and audience segregation. Finally, he demanded that black artists be housed in the same hotels as white artists. For a shy person such as Ella Fitzgerald, being in the middle of such acrimony and violence was certainly uncomfortable but her inner strength and steely resolve served her well.\n\nA famous example of this is the story of how Marilyn Monroe helped Ella Fitzgerald when it came to desegregating a Hollywood nightclub called The Mocambo. The story goes that Fitzgerald wanted to perform there because it was a bigger, more famous venue that had a history of being frequented by A-list celebrities. Even Frank Sinatra had sang there. Well, because Ella was black, her request to perform was turned down by the owner of The Mocambo. Enter Marilyn Monroe. At the time, Monroe was at the height of her fame. She was also a fan of Ella Fitzgerald and as it turned out she was a good person, too. She heard that Fitzgerald was denied the opportunity to sing at The Mocambo and immediately contacted the owner with an offer he couldn’t refuse. Monroe agreed to sit at a front row table in return for him allowing Ella to perform on his stage for as many nights as was possible. Thus, for eight nights in a row, Ella Fitzgerald sang at The Mocambo nightclub in Hollywood. For every one of those eight nights, Marilyn Monroe occupied a front row table. The Mocambo’s owner got plenty of free publicity. Fitzgerald and Monroe helped to desegregate another nightclub in the process. It was at times such as that, when racial tensions in America were at their highest, when Dr, Martin Luther King was marching in Birmingham, that the quiet dignity and resolve of someone like Ella Fitzgerald really bore fruit. The desegregation of performance venues was something that happened alongside the desegregation of public schools. While the history of the civil rights battles of the 1960s tends to focus on Dr. King and the Freedom Marches, there was a lot else going on with regard to establishing a basis for racial equality in America. Ella Fitzgerald, her peers at Verve Records and her friends within the industry (such as Marilyn Monroe) played a largely unheralded but deeply important role in helping to make things better.\n\nAnd so it was that I would sit in my living room with my parents while we watched TV. Every now and again Ella Fitzgerald would make a guest appearance on a variety show or a talk show. I would watch her smile and sing and think to myself that she was some nice lady and would probably have made a good grandmother. I had no idea who she really was and what it took to bring her to such a place and time as to be singing in my living room. But there she would be, smiling and singing as if she didn’t have a care in the world. The great ones always make tremendous effort seem effortless and the impossible possible. That was what Ella did. Forever and for always. What a legend!\n\nThe link to the official website for Ella Fitzgerald can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for Verve Records can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

In that post, I made reference to the art of dance and how much skill is required in order to make it look so effortless and graceful on screen or on stage. In a link at the end of the post, I included a video of dozens of dance scenes from old time movies all set in sync with the modern song “Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson. If you have never watched it, you can do so here. I have watched the video numerous times in the past and have always marveled at the editing and how bang on the lyrics and song beats were to the actions of the dancers on screen. However, when I viewed this video yesterday I saw it differently. Yesterday, I started to recognize some of the people and movies being referenced there. The Nicholas Brothers and Stormy Weather were featured prominently. The same can be said for the Lindyhoppers and the film Hellzapoppin’. I even recognized Bill Robinson dancing with Shirley Temple. I recognized them all because of this series…The Story of Jazz for Beginners Like Me. Watching that “Uptown Funk” mashup reminded me of being a teacher and watching my students suddenly “get” some concept and begin seeing their world with new eyes. The difference is that instead of young children making important connections, it is a 60 year old white dude sitting on a couch in Cobourg, Ontario, Canada in 2024. I just wanted to say for the record how happy I am with all I am learning because of this series. I hope to continue to honour the musical and cultural legacies of all whose names and stories appear in these posts. I can’t wait to see what I will learn next.\n\nThis is fun. Now, on with today’s post.\n\nToday we are going to be talking about an important evolutionary leap in music that was taken most famously by a young man named James P. Johnson. Mr. Johnson was a man who grew up in and around New York City at the turn of the century. He was raised in a household that valued religion and as a result, Johnson spent much of his youth surrounded by the glorious sounds of Gospel music. This music inspired within him a love of music in general. In addition to Gospel music, Johnson took to playing the piano and set about learning the musical works of Ragtime legend Scott Joplin. Johnson was said to possess perfect pitch and was able to memorize Joplin’s tunes, including his famous “Maple Leaf Rag”, by sound. As he became more experienced at reproducing Joplin’s Ragtime music on the piano, Johnson acquired greater skills as a pianist that helped him gain the reputation around New York City as a player of note. As all of this was unfolding, Johnson met another young pianist named Willie “The Lion” Smith. The two became best friends and musical partners. As a team, Johnson and Smith set about establishing themselves as accompanists for hire. At the time, in the late 1910s, Johnson and Smith would play Ragtime songs on the piano while female singers sang the lyrics. This is where that evolutionary link took place. Even though Ragtime music played on a piano can sound like a carnival at times, the truth is that this form of music is compositional in nature. That means that songs such as the “Maple Leaf Rag” were composed along the lines of classical music compositions and, as such, it was expected that anyone playing such a song would adhere to the musical structure that the original composer had intended. Well, Johnson and Smith started out faithfully reproducing these Ragtime masterpieces but they soon ran into a problem that sparked a musical innovation that helped give birth to the genre of Jazz. The problem that they ran into was the variations of skill levels and singing styles possessed by the female singers they had been hired to accompany. When an artist performs a solo piece, how they do it matters only to them. They are the only performer involved so however they make the piece work for them is the way that the piece will be performed. However, when you are a member of a duo or ensemble, things change. Each member is part of a team and is responsible for helping to complement, reinforce or challenge each other in such a way that the whole group shines. When Johnson and Smith began accompanying different singers, they found that their syncopated, structured Ragtime playing style didn’t always mesh with the singing style of their singer so, over time, they realized that they might have to adapt or improvise from the original musical structure in order to help the singer to sound her best. Thus, the act of improvisation, which is such a trademark of modern Jazz, began on the pianos of James P. Johnson and Willie “The Lion” Smith.\n\nBut there is more. The more that Johnson and Smith began to grow comfortable with improvisation, the more they realized that a new style of playing the piano was called for. Thus, James P. Johnson invented a new way of playing the piano which came to be known as the Stride style. The Stride style of playing the piano is one in which the right and left hands play independent of each other. The right hand is responsible for playing the melody of any given song while the left hand is responsible for maintaining the rhythm. By using such a style of playing, the left hand, in particular, moves over a wide range of keys while the right hand has a much smaller range of motion. It is a virtuosic style of playing that allows a simple piano to sound like a full orchestra, as far as the richness and fullness of the music being produced at any one time.\n\n***NOTE: In order for you to get an understanding of what I am talking about, I want you to take a moment and watch two short videos. In the first video, you will see an animated/computer-generated version of notes of a composition as they come into view as the music plays and how the “hands” of the pianist function with complete independence from each other. The left hand in particular moves all over the place in an almost dizzying fashion. Please watch this first video by clicking here. When that is finished, click here to watch another video in which famed Canadian pianist Oscar Peterson explains Stride style to TV talk show host Dick Cavett. Peterson and Caveat discuss other styles too but, the first 1:30 or so are where they talk about something that Caveat erroneously labels as “Art Tatum’s Stride Style”. Peterson corrects him and then gives an excellent demonstration of Stride playing in real time. Excellent video\n\nStride style piano playing blows my mind. It takes such concentration and dexterity and yet, when you watch the pros play in this style, they tend to do so with broad smiles on their faces as if it is the easiest and most joyful thing in the world. Once James P. Johnson mastered playing the piano in the Stride style, he recorded a piece of music called “Carolina Shout”. This recording was made into a piano roll, as was common in those days but it was also made into a phonograph record. “Carolina Shout” by James P. Johnson is a tune played in the Stride style and is considered by many to be the first true Jazz recording ever. It also set the gold standard when it came to piano playing, just as the Harlem Renaissance was swinging into high gear. Johnson became a highly sought-after music teacher. One of his most famous students was a man named Fats Waller. Others who were greatly influenced by him were people like Duke Ellington, Count Basie and, in later years, Art Tatum and Thelonious Monk, all of whom would take Johnson’s teachings and popularize the Stride style on a national scale. As it turned out, James P. Johnson, the great innovator, composer, piano player and teacher that he was, saw his name and reputation usurped in popularity by his students who followed in his wake. It was the likes of Fats Waller who made a name for himself playing at rent parties and at clubs like The Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom and who, subsequently, became the public face of the Stride piano style.\n\nOne of the things that made Jazz music so culturally important was that it developed out of other musical genres that told the stories of black culture but it came to life as its own genre during the heart of the Harlem Renaissance. James P. Johnson’s relegation to the back pages of history was not something that was purposefully done. It was just that there was an absolute explosion of important cultural developments during the 1920s/30s for people of colour, particularly in New York City. The birth of Jazz is a large part of that. It is a genre unique to the times in which it came to be. Not surprisingly, those musicians (such as Fats Waller) who helped to popularize certain aspects of Jazz came to be the ones toward whom the spotlight shone the brightest. All hail the Wallers and Calloways and Ellingtons and Armstrongs of the world! They are fully deserving of the historical bouquets that have been handed out over the years. But through it all, somewhere in a studio or a club in Harlem sat an older gentleman, grinning from ear to ear in spite of his relative anonymity, named James P. Johnson. I have no doubt that he was proud of his students for the success they achieved and for the great work they did in helping establish Jazz as a music genre of substance and style and importance. But what of Johnson, himself? Well, it took a while for his contribution to be recognized for what it truly was. As the 1970s began, Ragtime and the early transitional stages of Jazz were re-examined and found worthy of greater praise for the cultural impact both had on American society. As noted in an earlier post that you can read here, Ragtime saw a rebirth when many of Scott Joplin’s most famous compositions were used in the soundtrack for the Academy award-winning movie The Sting. Once Joplin’s career was revived, it was just a short journey to find the work of James P. Johnson and how his Stride piano style acted as the bridge between Ragtime and the birth of Jazz. In 1973, Johnson was posthumously inducted into the U.S. Songwriters Hall of Fame. Before the 1970s were out, he received further awards and inductions into various Jazz-oriented Halls of Fame. In 2020, a full century later, “Carolina Shout” was finally honoured with induction into the Grammy Hall of Fame as being one of the most historically important pieces of music of all time in the U.S.\n\nNot bad for someone raised in churches whose only early ambition was to make the ladies he accompanied on the piano sound their very best. As we all know and understand, the challenges posed to Johnson and Smith by the different singing styles they encountered while working in nightclubs in New York could have defeated lesser humans. However, both Johnson and Smith accepted the challenge inherent in adapting a successful playing style to suit the needs of the moment and, in doing so, they invented something entirely new and innovative and vibrant. Not only that, they were able to codify that new style in ways that allowed for its dissemination to a new generation of players who would introduce Stride style to the world! I am thankful that James P. Johnson is finally receiving the credit for which he is due. It was his inspirational spark that lit the flame of what ended up becoming Jazz. We are all the better for such creativity and skill. Thanks Mr. Johnson, Mr. Smith and all others who led the way back in the day when Ragtime was as far as the cultural and musical journey had progressed. Your impact is immeasurable. Let all the bouquets be yours now. They are well-earned.\n\nThe link to the official website for James P. Johnson can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Carolina Shout” by James P.

I find it nice that a world body such as the U.N. would promote and honour a genre of music that was born in a cauldron of oppression by those seeking freedom and is now celebrated as a source of cultural pride by so many around the world. I am happy to play a very small part in that process by discovering the amazing beauty, creativity and passion that emanates from the world of Jazz. I am loving the history that I am learning, as well as those who helped to make that history come alive. So far in my learning journey, I have come to know the importance of everything from New Orleans funeral parades to Harlem rent parties, Ragtime, Jazz and Swing, as well as meeting such luminaries as King Oliver, Scott Joplin, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, Adelaide Hall, Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn, Chick Webb and Ella Fitzgerald, too. I have also learned about The Emancipation Proclamation, The Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance. And all of this is just scratching the surface of a story that is as large as the history of the country in which it is set. I am hopeful that you are learning and growing along with me with each new chapter in The Story of Jazz for Beginners Like Me. As always, I write these words with much humility and respect for those whose stories I am attempting to tell. Today, it is my honour to introduce you to one of the most gifted, charismatic and famous Jazz singers in the history of the genre, Mr. Cabell “Cab” Calloway. His story starts with Mr. Calloway embracing the opportunities that were initially made available to him by those who came to Harlem first, such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington. But, as you shall see, Cab Calloway quickly blazed his own trail in the world of music…a mark that extends all the way from the late 1920s, well into the 1980s and the beginning of Hip Hop. Cab Calloway was an amazing man. Here is his story. Enjoy.\n\nCab Calloway was born on Christmas Day in 1907. Initially he lived in Rochester, New York, but not long after his father passed away and his mother remarried, Calloway found himself spending his childhood in Baltimore, Maryland. As a young boy, Calloway enjoyed being around horses and horse racing tracks. Being from Baltimore, he spent as much time as he could at Pimlico Race Track (home of The Preakness Stakes, part of horse racing’s Triple Crown of races). Betting on the ponies was something that was to become a lifelong obsession. In fact, it was an incident as a teenager that involved gambling near a church that caused Calloway to spend time at a reform school for wayward youth. The time he spent there certainly captured his attention. Calloway emerged back into society determined to make a name for himself. While his mother desperately wanted him to study law, Calloway had his heart set on music. Following in the footsteps of his older sister Blanche, who had already entered the world of Jazz, Calloway began taking formal singing lessons. As he entered his twenties, Calloway traveled to Chicago and began singing in clubs there. While in Chicago, Calloway met fellow singer and established star, Adelaide Hall. He also met trumpeter Louis Armstrong. His meeting up with Armstrong was fortuitous because it was through Armstrong that Cab Calloway learned skat singing. As you may know, skat singing is a style of singing in which nonsense syllables and other sounds are substituted for actual song lyrics. These nonsense sounds act in concert with the notes emanating from the instruments being used by the orchestra, which has the effect of turning the human voice into a musical instrument. Cab Calloway honed his skill as a skat singer and took his talent to New York City, where he entered the world of the Harlem Renaissance that was already in full swing.\n\nWhen Calloway landed in New York City, he quickly fell in with other musicians who had begun to establish themselves in the city, such as Duke Ellington and Fats Waller. All of these musicians played at rent parties and started earning a reputation as quality players. Cab Calloway, in particular, started becoming known for his singing skills and his charming personality. As he began to become a regular fixture on the rent party circuit, he was approached by the owners of the world famous Cotton Club to act as a fill-in performer during those times when regular house band leader, Duke Ellington, was away on tour with his orchestra. Calloway agreed. As part of his gig as band leader at The Cotton Club, Cab Calloway started appearing on national syndicated radio with the likes of Bing Crosby, thus making Calloway the very first person of colour to have his own national radio show. By the time the Great Depression began to be felt across North America, Cab Calloway was making over $50,000 a year, which was a princely sum at the time.\n\nCab Calloway met many interesting people during his time at The Cotton Club. He used the personalities of these people as the inspiration for a series of original songs. In 1931, he released a song called “Minnie the Moocher” that was based upon a Cotton Club regular who was forever thirsty but never seemed to have any money to pay for her drinks. This song features a very famous bit of call-and-response skat singing that involves the word segments “Hi De Hi”. The popularity of the “Hi di hi, hi de ho” chorus swept the country, taking “Minnie the Moocher” all the way to the top of the charts. Cab Calloway sold over one million copies of this song, making him the first person of colour to achieve such a milestone. The success of “Minnie the Moocher” allowed Calloway to cross over into the world of film. He sang that song, along with two others, as part of the Betty Boop cartoon series. The success of Betty Boop cartoons drew the attention of Hollywood studio executives. As the 1930s moved along, Cab Calloway was featured in several short films, many of which featured the singing of the “Hi de hi, Hi de ho” chorus. In 1935, he helped introduce a young singer named Lena Horne to the world via one of his short films. As the decade drew to a close, he appeared on screen with white singer Al Jolson. When they shared the screen together while singing duets, it marked one of the very first times that people of different races appeared as equals together on screen at the same time. That movie was called The Singing Kid and is credited with helping to break down racial barriers in Hollywood and around the world. As if that wasn’t enough, in many of his 1930s films, Cab Calloway can be seen doing a dance move called “the Backward Glide”. It was this move that many think Michael Jackson was emulating a half century later when he electrified the world by introducing the “Moonwalk” dance move.\n\nAs the 1940s began, Cab Calloway was now becoming known as one of the most popular entertainers in America. The beginning of this decade saw Cab Calloway do two separate things that ensured that his impact as a person and as a role model would be long lasting. First of all, Calloway created his own dictionary. That may seem like an unusual thing for a Jazz musician to spend time doing, but there is more to this than first meets the eye. There are many things that act to define a culture. There is music and storytelling and poetry and art and fashion, and there are larger-than-life personalities all involved, but one of the things that ties this all together is language. One of the things that usually happens when one dominant culture attempts to control/colonize another through cultural assimilation (as seen in what happened to the Indigenous peoples of North America) is that cultural traditions and language usage are taken away. The colonized peoples are forced to adopt the language, traditions and history of the conquerors. In time, as generations go by, the hope of the colonizer is that the conquered peoples will forget their past ways and become assimilated into the dominant culture. When that happens, subjugated cultures disappear and cease to exist. Without going into a great, long history lesson, one of the abhorrent aspects of slavery was a similar denial of culture and history for people of colour in America. Part of the reason that the Harlem Renaissance came into being in the first place was to help re-establish that sense of cultural identity for people of colour. Part of that process of cultural reappropriation came in the form of art and music and theatre and literature. As those scenes began to become established as new and thriving parts of life in America, Cab Calloway and others felt the time was right to take back control of language, too. This move to formally enshrine cultural language was not meant to create a threat to established North American language conventions; it was simply meant to allow people of colour to express themselves and their feelings and ideas in their own culturally-specific words. Consequently, in 1938, Cab Calloway compiled and published his dictionary that was entitled Cab Calloway’s Cat-ologue: A Hepster’s Dictionary. The vernacular that Calloway captured in his dictionary was the language of Jazz clubs and of Harlem, in general. In the larger society, the language denoted in the Hepster’s Dictionary became known as Jive. As was noted by poet Lemn Sissay, “Cab Calloway was taking ownership of a language for a people who, just a few generations before, had their own languages taken away”. As much as Cab Calloway is known for his contributions to the world of Jazz music, his efforts to codify the language of those sharing his cultural world should not be underestimated. It was no small feat to do what Calloway did by using his fame to uplift an entire race of people.\n\nFurther to that, in 1943 Cab Calloway agreed to take part in a landmark film called Stormy Weather. This film starred Calloway, along with Lena Horne, Bill “Mr. BoJangles” Robinson, Fats Waller, Dooley Wilson and the Nicholas Brothers, among others. Stormy Weather was one of the first movies to feature an all-black cast in the lead roles. The premise of the movie was a love story that was told via a series of musical vignettes. For many, the highlight of the film appeared toward the end when Cab Calloway teamed up with the Nicholas Brothers to perform a song of Calloway’s called “Jumpin’ Jive”. In the film clip that I will link to below, Calloway sings and dances for the first half of the clip and then turns the stage over to the Nicholas Brothers. The Nicholas Brothers were two brothers named Harold and Fayard. There are many who state that the Nicholas Brothers were the pre-eminent tap dancers in America at the time that Stormy Weather was filmed. No less an authority than Fred Astaire stated that the dance sequence for “Jumpin’ Jive” is the single best dance sequence ever filmed in cinematic history! What makes this dance sequence so much more impressive than it first appears is knowing that the entire scene was shot in one single take and that there had been no rehearsals prior to filming. What was captured on tape was the one and only time Harold and Fayard did that dance. When you watch the film, you will see why. To say that they dance with style and with reckless abandon in equal measure is not an understatement. The entire scene is simply one spectacular feat of athleticism and death-defying skill after another. As much as Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly and Donald O’ Connor are held up as examples of what the best of dance looks like, I cannot say with any confidence that they outshine what the Nicholas Brothers accomplished in Stormy Weather. Simply astonishing!\n\nAs the decades rolled by, Cab Calloway continued to make music and to act on stage in musicals and in movies. Along with his daughters Lael and Chris, Cab Calloway recorded new music and appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show in the 1960s. He also appeared in the all-black cast of Hello, Dolly! after Carol Channing had finished her run. Then, all the way in 1980, Calloway came full circle. He was cast as himself in the movie The Blues Brothers starring John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd. In that movie, he got to sing “Minnie the Moocher” again and introduce an entirely new generation into the call-and-response chorus of “Hi de hi/hi de ho”.\n\nCab Calloway died in 1994 at the age of 87. His legacy is one of immense influence. There are many who state that the great showmanship of performers such as James Brown and Michael Jackson was inspired directly from Cab Calloway. In the Stormy Weather film clip, it is easy to see why people would say that. He certainly had a tremendous stage presence! There are many who also say that his skat singing style, of which he was the best, is what led directly to the style of singing that appears in Hip Hop. As you may know, the pairing of vocal utterances and beats in Hip Hop mirrors what Calloway did when he used skat singing to complement the notes played by his orchestra members. Whether you agree with this comparison or not, what is true beyond any doubt is that Cab Calloway enjoyed a career that easily ranks him among the greatest Jazz musicians and entertainers of all time. What is also true is that he is owed a great debt of gratitude for his efforts to enshrine the legitimacy of an entire race of people through his actions in creating his own dictionary, of willingly appearing on screen with white actors at a time when the mixing of the races just wasn’t done and finally, lending his credibility to projects such as Stormy Weather that gave other performers of colour the chance to shine on the biggest of stages under the brightest of lights. Hopefully, when I get to visit Rochester, New York, this summer, I will be able to find the monument there that pays tribute to him as his birthplace. In the meantime, I will simply re-watch the “Jumpin’ Jive” clip, slack-jawed as I tend to be, over and over again on repeat. “Hi de hi/ hi de ho” to you, Mr. Cab Calloway. Thanks for all that you did to help make life better. May you rest in peace now and forever more.\n\nThe link to the official website for Cab Calloway can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Jumpin’ Jive” by Cab Calloway from the film Stormy Weather, featuring the absolutely incredible dancing of The Nicholas Brothers can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “Minnie the Moocher” as shown in the film The Blues Brothers can be found here.\n\nThe link to the official website for the city of Rochester, New York can be found here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

Beginning at the tip of Central Park and running all the way to the West 145th Street Bridge, Lenox Avenue (since renamed as Malcolm X Blvd.) was the heart of the Harlem Renaissance. If you were to go there today, between W140th and W141st streets you would find a historical plaque that is all that remains of a block-long building called The Savoy Ballroom which was arguably its heartbeat. Imagine what it must have felt like to be newly settled in a community where, for many, it was the very first time they felt at home. Then, to sit in your apartment, windows open, or out on the fire escape that served as a balcony, as the night time air filled with the sounds of Chick Webb and His Orchestra or Dizzy Gillespie or Benny Goodman or Louis Armstrong, the giants of Jazz all playing the very best music of its time. There are stories told by young children of being able to listen to the music that came from The Savoy Ballroom while watching, with eyes wide, the silhouettes of the amazing dancers as they passed before the windows of that nightclub. All the while the Jazz greats played, the dancers danced and the Roaring Twenties seemed a dream come true for those who now called Harlem home.\n\nThe term The Golden Age of Jazz is meant to denote a specific period in time when many of the legends of Jazz first came into prominence and Jazz as a musical genre was introduced to the larger world. This time period was the 1920s and 30s. The place where many of the important events in the history of Jazz happened was Harlem. In Harlem, many of the most culturally significant nightclubs: The Cotton Club, The Apollo Theater and The Savoy Ballroom, all sat within a ten minute walk of each other. Of the three, The Savoy Ballroom was, by far, the biggest and grandest dancehall of them all. It took up an entire city block between W140th and W141st streets. The upper floor of the ballroom could hold up to 4000 people and it did just that most nights for much of its existence. The Savoy Ballroom was named after the grand Savoy Hotel in England. No expenses were spared on its interior design. It was opulent on purpose. Its mandate was to reflect the pride with which Harlem had come to view itself. The music played there reflected that. The serious dancing that went on inside of The Savoy Ballroom reflected that, too. The dancefloors of The Savoy Ballroom were no place for the timid, the meek or the clumsy. Some of the finest dancers in America cut the most jaw-dropping moves many had ever witnessed inside the walls of The Savoy Ballroom. So much so that it was reported that the floor was routinely replaced every three years due to wear and tear from the dancers strutting their stuff. The Savoy Ballroom was so long that there was room to install bandstands at either end. One bandstand was for visiting bands to entertain the crowd with their own brand of Jazz and Swing. The other bandstand was reserved for the house band led by the indomitable figure of Chick Webb. Between Chick Webb and His Orchestra at one end and the guest orchestra at the other, there was no let up when it came to music being played. The Golden Age of Jazz happened in real time at The Savoy Ballroom, and as it did, for a while all seemed right with the world.\n\nChick Webb was born in Baltimore, Maryland in 1905. Because of a serious health scare as a child, Chick Webb developed curvature of the spine, which stunted his growth and gave him the appearance of being hunchbacked. One of the exercises recommended to strengthen his back muscles was to learn how to play the drums. Webb took up the challenge of drumming, and by the time he was in his early twenties, he was viewed as one of the top Jazz drummers anywhere in terms of technique and creativity. In 1926, Chick Webb took his talents into New York City. Because of his health issues, Webb sought opportunities to play in a stable musical environment (as opposed to being in a touring band). This brought him to the attention of Charles Buchanan, who managed the Savoy Ballroom. He hired Webb to become the leader of the house band. Because the house band was permanently stationed at The Savoy Ballroom, it allowed Chick Webb the chance to entice a roster of Jazz players who were skilled at their craft with an offer of a guaranteed, consistent paycheque. It also gave them the time to practice and rehearse, and as a result, Chick Webb and His Orchestra became noted for the tightness of their ensemble playing. In fact, The Savoy Ballroom played host to several “battles-of-the-bands” contests in which Webb faced off with any and all comers. The most famous of these contests concerned a battle between Chick Webb and His Orchestra and the world famous Benny Goodman Orchestra. Those who were there all swear that Chick Webb and his crew wiped the floor with Goodman and his band that night. That Webb, a black man playing culturally significant music to the black community, defeated a white band leader and a predominantly white orchestra was a source of great pride for those who viewed Lenox Avenue as their community. Of the many people Chick Webb recruited to work with his orchestra, one of the biggest stars of them all turned out to be a young singer named Ella Fitzgerald. Chick Webb came to know Ms. Fitzgerald after she won the inaugural Amateur Night talent competition at the nearby Apollo Theatre. Ella Fitzgerald used her scat singing style as a vocal instrument that complemented the music played, and often improvised, by Webb and his band. One of the most famous original songs that came out of this arrangement was a song written by lyricist Edgar Sampson (who worked in collaboration with Chick Webb) called “Stompin’ at the Savoy”. This song not only paid tribute to The Savoy Ballroom and all that it symbolized for the people of Harlem, but it also gave out a salute to those dancers who were considered the best of the best by their peers. It is a song that has become a standard of the genre and is regarded by many as Chick Webb’s greatest original hit. Unfortunately, Webb’s health issues flared up as he reached his mid-thirties, and he ended up passing away at age 35. From the time of his death until the start of WWII, Ella Fitzgerald assumed the leadership of the orchestra and helped the Savoy Ballroom maintain its standing as the top Jazz venue in the world.\n\nOne of the things that made The Savoy Ballroom such a special place was the culture that existed within its walls. This culture manifested itself in two separate but very important ways. First of all, The Savoy Ballroom was an “open” nightclub, meaning that it was not segregated along racial lines. While the clientele remained mostly black, white dancers and musicians were welcomed inside. This atmosphere of tolerance helped to break down barriers of ignorance that had kept the races apart for far too long. It allowed an environment of mutual respect to take root. The result of this was that many orchestras that graced one end of the bandstand became integrated, long before laws were enacted to make this a legal way of living across the country. A second important aspect of The Savoy Ballroom’s culture came in the form of dancing. Many of the regular dancers became so proficient at their craft that they were given their own dedicated area of the dance floor that was reserved just for them. Around this roped-off area was a ring of tables at which some of the biggest celebrities of the day would sit to watch these dancers dance. People such as Orson Welles, Clark Gable and Sammy Davis Jr. sat and marveled at the creativity and athleticism on display. In turn, they went back to their studios and helped to promote those dancers by inviting them to become involved in film and stage productions that they headed up. The most notable example of this concerns a group of dancers who became known as Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers.\n\nWhen The Savoy Ballroom first opened, a security team was hired to ensure that criminal elements stayed away from the club. One of the security managers was a man named Herbert White. As The Savoy Ballroom established itself as a thriving dance hall, White began to notice that there were certain regular customers who came to dance who seemed to possess dance skills that were a cut above the rest of the patrons. White approached these dancers and suggested that they organize together as a group. The dancers agreed. They formed a dance troupe under White’s leadership that eventually became known as Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers. These dancers were the ones that were granted their own special dance area by White. It was also these dancers that the A-list celebrities came to watch. While this dance troupe was forming, practicing and honing their skills, a major world event was unfolding. Aviator Charles Lindbergh had managed to “hop” across the Atlantic Ocean, becoming the first person to pilot a transatlantic flight. Lindbergh’s accomplishment caused him to be granted hero status all across America and the world. Many individuals and organizations sought to pay tribute to Lindbergh for achieving this great feat. One such tribute was put together by a group of dancers at The Savoy Ballroom. There, they created an original dance in his honour which they named the Lindy Hop. This dance was made to be danced while the most energetic Swing music was being played. As the dance began to be performed on stages beyond The Savoy Ballroom, the dance troupe gained instant fame and became known around the world as Whitey’s Lindy Hoppers. The men and women who comprised this troupe became the acknowledged leaders of the Lindy Hop dance style. They performed together long after Chick Webb passed away. In fact, they stayed together until the onset of WWII when the male members of The Lindy Hoppers were drafted into the Armed Forces and sent overseas to fight.\n\nThe Savoy Ballroom closed its doors for the final time in 1958. By this time, the neighborhood of Harlem was entering a period of decline. Civic pride had been replaced by a sense of malaise at the state of race relations in New York and across the rest of America that didn’t seem to be getting any better. This spirit of pessimism gave way to a lack of care for the physical properties in Harlem. Crime rose. Homelessness seemed to spiral out of control. The political powers that be in the mayor’s office decided that one way to combat homelessness and get drug use and other criminal activity off of the streets was to build more affordable housing complexes. One of the places they sought to do this was the block between W140th and W141st streets, the home of The Savoy Ballroom. By that time, the glory days of The Savoy Ballroom were far behind it. Because of the historical and cultural importance of the building, a large grassroots campaign was organized in an attempt to save the building from the wrecking ball. That attempt failed. The Savoy Ballroom had its interior decor picked clean, with its decorative fixtures distributed throughout Harlem and America. Stripped of its glory, the bricks and glass and mortar that formed its shell were knocked down and hauled away as garbage. In its place, a housing complex known as the Delano Village Housing Complex was built. All that remains of The Savoy Ballroom is an historical plaque marking its former location. The heartbeat of Harlem is gone. A glorious chapter in its history has closed.\n\n***This post has been written with much respect and admiration for those who made the music that filled The Savoy Ballroom, those who danced the nights away there and for all those who listened and watched it all with pride from the outside. It seems like it must have been a grand and glorious time for all concerned. Thanks for everything.

He grew up in Washington, D.C. Both of his parents played the piano so, not surprisingly, young Edward grew up in a home that was filled with all sorts of music: everything from parlor songs, to the arias from famous operas. Despite growing up in a time in which laws were enacted that openly discriminated against people of colour (i.e., “Jim Crow” laws), the Ellingtons raised their son to be proud of his heritage and who he was as a person. They dressed him in the finest clothes they could afford. They taught him proper manners and expected him to be polite and gracious while in public. But most of all, the Ellingtons gave their son the great gift of musical literacy. Long before this dapper little dude was dubbed by his friends as “The Duke”, he had a solid understanding of compositional construction. In fact, he would create his first piece of music, called the “Soda Fountain Rag”, as a teenager before knowing how to record even a single note of music on paper. That would come in time. As a teenager, Duke Ellington was already exhibiting one of his musical calling cards that he would carry with him all throughout his career as a composer, which was his ability to take a single composition, such as the “Soda Fountain Rag”, and improvise a variety of alternative variations of the initial composition. In that way, one composition often yielded ten or more variations and gave others the impression that Ellington was more prolific than he actually was when he first started out.\n\nInitially, Ellington preferred sports to music, and as a teenager he sold peanuts at baseball games in Washington. It was while out and about during game days that a young Duke Ellington began becoming drawn to the music coming from pool halls that surrounded the ball diamond. In those days, pool halls, brothels and speakeasies were places where musicians of colour could play publicly and earn a living. It was in those Washington area pool halls that Ellington first heard piano players such as Eubie Blake. While Blake (you can read a previous post about Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle here) and Ellington didn’t formally meet here, the impression Blake’s playing left on the teenage Ellington was immediate and profound. Eubie Blake played Ragtime and some early Jazz. The energy and complexity of the music fascinated Ellington. He also thought that Blake and the other piano players he saw had an air of coolness about them. It was the thought of possessing their level of swagger and musical prowess that caused Duke Ellington to refocus his energies back toward his music. He attended his piano lessons with a renewed sense of purpose and dedication. Ellington learned how to read sheet music and to write his own. Before long, Duke Ellington met some other young men who played trumpets and trombones and clarinets and who, like Ellington, had dreams of being someone important. At first, Ellington played in any group that would have him. Eventually, he sought a higher degree of control over his future and formed his own band called The Duke’s Serenaders. This band played at all manner of events in and around the Washington, D.C., area. At all times, the band members dressed in suits and ties and cast an aura of elegance and maturity, to go along with their talent and energy. Because of how Duke Ellington presented himself in public, he and his band were hired to play for white audiences as often as they played for black audiences. Playing for integrated audiences was something that, at that time, usually only happened for performers of colour in minstrel-type shows that openly mocked the ambitions of people of colour. However, right from the very beginning, because of his upbringing, Duke Ellington never engaged in any public behaviour that would be described as deferential or self-deprecating. Ellington was the epitome of stylishness and professionalism at all times. He was a proud Black man, and he exuded that sense of pride at all times simply by being himself.\n\nAs Duke Ellington turned 20, his drummer, Sonny Greer, moved from Washington back to his home in New Jersey. Greer began playing in gigs in Harlem. He wrote to Ellington and invited him to move to New York City and join in the growing Arts scene there. Duke Ellington agreed to go. In time, Duke Ellington and the Duke Ellington Orchestra would become fixtures of the Harlem Renaissance, but in those early days, work was hard to come by in New York’s very competitive music marketplace. What helped establish Duke Ellington as a name to be reckoned with in New York was his willingness to do two separate but important and ultimately interconnected things. First of all, Duke Ellington hired himself and his (at the time) small band to play at personal events known as “rent parties”. In last week’s post about Eubie Blake and the musical Shuffle Along, I spoke about how the Harlem Renaissance was created, in part, by large numbers of people of colour who had moved north as part of an event called The Great Migration. With so many people of colour all requiring accommodation at the same time, the renting of apartments became somewhat of a sellers’ game. If people of colour wanted to live in one of the world’s biggest and fastest-growing cities, then they would have to pay extra for that privilege. Thus rent for people of colour tended to be inflated. This caused financial burdens for many families who were new to the city and were still seeking to establish themselves professionally. But this is also where the importance and significance of being part of a large community of people who shared common life experiences and knew that there was strength in looking out for each other came to the fore. Thus, the phenomenon known as rent parties started to become a common thing. A rent party was a party, as the name implies. However, it was a party whose goal was to generate revenue for the people hosting the event so that they could afford to pay their rent. When someone needed to throw a rent party, they would advertise through posters or personally-created invitations that stated when and where the party was to be held and what sort of entertainment would be available. There was always a cover charge for entry to the event. People often brought their own food and drink to help out the hosts. Finally, musicians such as Duke Ellington would show up and play for tips or, more often than not, for free. Imagine having someone like Duke Ellington or Cab Calloway or Fats Waller performing for free in your own living room!? Some of these parties could get quite raucous as pianists such as Ellington played Ragtime, Jazz and started introducing a new sound called Swing. The phrase “to cut a rug” (by dancing) originated from rent parties and the unintentional damage that happened from the dancing that took place at these events. The poet Langston Hughes, in an attempt to chronicle all aspects of the Harlem Renaissance, kept a shoebox filled with the posters and homemade invitations he received for the various rent parties he attended. When his personal and professional papers were eventually donated to Yale University, the shoebox filled with rent party invitations went along, too.\n\nBecause of the word of mouth recognition that Duke Ellington received from his performances at rent parties, his name was brought up as potentially being someone who might wish to lead the house band at a new nightclub that was opening up in Harlem called The Cotton Club. The band leader gig was first offered to King Oliver, who (as you may remember from a previous post that you can read here) was Louis Armstrong’s original mentor in New Orleans. Oliver declined to perform in The Cotton Club because it had a policy of excluding Black audiences. Duke Ellington accepted the job, in part because he had a comfort level in playing professionally for white audiences, but also because the performances at The Cotton Club were to be broadcast on national radio. Ellington correctly predicted that those national radio broadcasts would be one of the quickest ways to have Jazz music reach audiences on a national scale. So, Duke Ellington put together a full-fledged orchestra which became The Duke Ellington Orchestra. Because of those Cotton Club performances, Duke Ellington became a famous name in the emerging field of Big Band, Swing and Jazz music.\n\nIn addition to being a talented pianist, one of the things that endeared Ellington to those members of his orchestra was his compositional style. Many composers wrote music based upon their own personal inspirations and then expected those playing in the orchestra to adapt to the composer’s style. Duke Ellington did it differently. When Duke Ellington composed pieces of music, such as “It Don’t Mean a Thing (If It Ain’t Got That Swing)”, “Mood Indigo”, “Sophisticated Lady”, “Take the A Train” and his first national hit, “Creole Love Call” featuring Adelaide Hall, he did so with the individual talents of his orchestra members in mind. Ellington always composed his songs based on the strengths of his players, and by doing so, he always placed them in positions where they would naturally have success and be able to showcase their talent. One specific example I could give would be how Duke Ellington was willing to give credit on many pieces of work (and a lot of professional trust) to his musical partner Billy Strayhorn who wrote many of the lyrics for Ellington’s most famous songs such as “Take the A Train”. Duke Ellington’s compositional/leadership style was so appreciated by those in his orchestra that many of his band members stayed with him all throughout their careers.\n\nThe song “Creole Love Call” is a significant song in Duke Ellington’s discography for several reasons. First of all, one of Ellington’s personal mandates was to increase the exposure of the roots of Black music to the entire nation. Thus, a song like “Creole Love Call” introduced America to the contribution of Creole culture to the genre of Jazz. Secondly, by employing Adelaide Hall as the singer of this song, he exposed her to a national audience as well. Hall, as you may know from last week’s post, was one of the original stars of the first all-Black musical ever called Shuffle Along. While her work in Shuffle Along made her a known talent in New York City, it was her work on “Creole Love Call” that introduced her to the nation at large. Thirdly, Adelaide Hall introduced an important musical element to “Creole Love Call” in the form of scat singing at the beginning and end of the song. While not the first performer to sing in the scat style, what Adelaide Hall did was use her voice to make sounds just like a regular musical instrument would. Thus, her vocal stylings complemented Ellington and his orchestra’s musical note making perfectly.\n\nOver the course of his career, Duke Ellington and his Orchestra recorded over 1000 songs. He has won 14 Grammy Awards and has been inducted into every Hall of Fame for which he is eligible. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the U.S. and the Legion of Honour in France…the highest civilian awards in both countries. In 1999, a century after he was born, Duke Ellington was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for his contribution to Arts and Culture in America. Over a dozen of his songs have been selected by the Library of Congress for preservation due to the cultural significance they possess. Finally, as a measure of how respected Duke Ellington was by other musicians and how great an impact he had on the world of music, there are numerous songs that have been written about him. The first of two that stand out are “Sir Duke” by Stevie Wonder from his album Songs in the Key of Life. This song namechecks Ellington, along with several other notable Black musicians who were influential, as role models, in inspiring Stevie Wonder to follow the career path that he did. The second famous Duke Ellington-inspired song of note is one that many do not know is a tip of the hat in his direction at all. It is the great rock n’ roll song by the band Dire Straits called “Sultans of Swing”. For those unfamiliar with the lyrics of this song, “Sultans of Swing” is a song about the lead singer of Dire Straits, Mark Knopfler, and his friends, stumbling into a seedy bar in South London one day. It is a rainy day. The bar is almost empty. But in the corner is a Jazz band called The Sultans of Swing playing very quickly in “double four time” even though they have virtually no audience to speak of. The song that the band within the song is playing is “Creole Love Call” by Duke Ellington.\n\n“Then a crowd of young boys they’re foolin’ around in the corner\n\nDrunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles\n\nThey don’t give a damn about any trumpet playin’ band\n\nIt ain’t what they call rock n’ roll.\n\nAnd the Sultans\n\nYeah the Sultans, they play “Creole”,\n\n“Creole”.\n\nBoth “Sir Duke” and “The Sultans of Swing” are great songs about a great composer, band leader and proud Black man, Duke Ellington. They are respectful nods that honour a man’s legacy as a difference maker in the lives of so many musicians who followed in his wake. In the history of Jazz as a musical genre, it is the foundational contributions of men such as Scott Joplin, King Oliver, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle who made it possible for Jazz to become what it has over time. But it was men such as Louis Armstrong and Duke Ellington who first brought Jazz and all of its iterations to the masses and made the genre enduringly popular. As we shall see in the weeks to come, the Golden Age of Jazz gave the world the likes of “Satchmo” and “The Duke”, but it also gave us so many more worthy people whose contributions are integral to the story of Jazz. It is with much humility and respect that I prepare to tell their stories as well. For now, I hope that you have enjoyed this brief look at the life of legendary composer, pianist and band leader Duke Ellington.

For example, whenever I listen to almost any song performed by Canadian Jazz singer Diana Krall, I am transported to an environment filled with candlelight or a roaring fire in the hearth, an otherwise darkened room, a glass of wine at the ready and my beloved by my side. We may be dancing cheek to cheek, and, if not that, then, we are certainly side by side, nestled together as young lovers should be. Diana Krall’s music has always been delivered in a velvety smooth manner, sparkling like starlight. Her music style is the antithesis of the frenetic energy of the world of Punk rock that I also enjoy when the mood calls for that. Krall’s Jazz stylings are the musical equivalent of rich chocolate slowly melting in your mouth. She relaxes you with her piano and her voice and makes you feel as though there is no one in the world but you and the one you love and that everything is going to be just fine. It is not without merit that Diana Krall is viewed as being one of the world’s greatest Jazz singers in the past quarter century. She has earned every breathless compliment. This is her story.\n\nDiana Krall was born in 1964, which makes her the exact same age as me. Even though we both qualify now for the senior’s discount at many local stores, she seems to be aging gracefully, while I seem to be happy when I successfully bend down and straighten up again without incident. Diana Krall was born in Nanaimo, British Columbia. Her parents were not professional musicians themselves, but both loved music and filled their family home with the sounds of singing and of piano playing. Diana Krall was drawn toward the piano and began taking formal music lessons through the Royal Conservatory of Music as a preschooler. *(As a personal aside, I once spent a month of my life working as a telephone solicitor for The Royal Conservatory of Music while I lived in London, Ontario. Making cold calls is a tough gig. It isn’t for everyone. Kudos to those who can do it well). In high school, when many kids were forming rock bands, Krall joined the school Jazz band. From there, she began appearing in local coffee houses as a solo artist who sang Jazz standards while patrons poured tips into her jar. In the early 1980s, Diana Krall enrolled in Berklee College of Music in Boston. This was not long after another famous Canadian musician, Bruce Cockburn, had come and gone from Berklee, as well.\n\nDiana Krall released her debut album in 1992. By 1996, she earned her first Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Album of the Year for an album of Nat King Cole classics. In 2000, she toured the world with crooner extraordinaire Tony Bennett. As part of that tour, she and Bennett appeared together on Canadian television on a show hosted by musician Elvis Costello called Spectacle: Elvis Costello With…. That guest appearance was the first step in a relationship that would see Krall and Costello marry in 2003. Not only did they become husband and wife, but they also began a collaborative musical partnership that has seen Costello write lyrics for original music for Krall to record while she has supplied instrumental accompaniment on songs of his. The two remain happily married to this day. In 2006, Diana Krall released an album called The Look of Love. The album title was in reference to a song that was originally written by Burt Bacharach and his musical partner Hal David back in 1967. When this song was initially released, Diana Krall was learning to play the piano in her family home and was only one year away from entering the Royal Conservatory of Music at age 4. In any case, the Bacharach/David composition was first recorded by Jazz legend Stan Getz, but it really gained fame when recorded shortly thereafter by singer Dusty Springfield for inclusion on the soundtrack to the James Bond film Casino Royale. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were nominated for Academy Awards for this song. As for Springfield, she earned herself a Top Twenty hit with it. Flash forward almost a half century later, The Look of Love became a multi -platinum album for Diana Krall. Like Dusty Springfield, Krall’s whispery take on the song brought her into the Top Twenty charts, too. While all of Krall’s albums have sold consistently well throughout her career, The Look of Love is the one that sold the best and really cemented her reputation as a Jazz singer of note around the world. Overall, she has sold over fifteen million records worldwide. She has also earned multiple Grammy and Juno awards, too.\n\nGoing to a live concert is a funny experience in many ways. Most concerts that I have attended in person have been raucous affairs that have gotten my heart pumping and my blood flowing. If at the end of the concert I wasn’t soaked in sweat, then I guess I just wasn’t trying hard enough. But not all concerts are the same. A Diana Krall concert is a case in point. Her shows are exercises in class and professional musicianship. I enjoy her live music performances in part because of how crystal clear each note is that emanates from her piano or from the instruments being played by the members of her orchestra. The crispness of these notes in combination with the clarity of each word she sings makes the mellowness of it all almost excruciating to experience, but, in a good way. It is almost too pleasurable, from a music lover’s point of view. The artistry on display from Diana Krall and her orchestra is second to none. I also find her singing style extraordinary as well. The timbre of her voice is so deep and rich, but yet, when she sings, it seems almost completely effortless. I can’t think of another singer….and I know many….who appear so stoic, so completely in control of the muscles in their neck and throat area, as to seem completely still as does Diana Krall when she sings. That lack of muscle contortion when singing seems almost spellbinding in a way. Krall draws you in with her voice, holds your gaze with the calmness of her demeanor as she wrings every drop of emotion from the standards she sings and leaves you spent at the end. If I didn’t know better I would say that she is part siren. I certainly do wish that many of today’s young female singers would take note of how Diana Krall goes about her business. She has an air of sensuality about her that is all breath and body control. There is no need for her to perform half in the nude to cast a spell over her audience. She is the complete package just by being herself.\n\nHaving said all of that, I have to admit that Diana Krall’s form of Jazz is something that I have to be in the mood for in order to enjoy. Much of the time, her music moves too slowly for my sensibilities. But then again, there are other times when a good torch song is exactly what the doctor ordered. InAt times like that, Diana Krall is definitely my go-to source. As far as careers go, she has to be very proud of the one that she has created for herself. Right from her earliest days living at home in Nanaimo, B.C., Diana Krall has been all about the music and how it can be used to create feelings of warmth and safety and pleasure for those who hear it. She has made a career out of singing in a style that suits her skill set perfectly. She has toured with the finest musicians in her orchestra and has the most special musical collaborator in the form of her husband, Elvis Costello *(whom she calls Declan when the two of them are at home). All in all, Diana Krall remains one of Canada’s most successful and respected musical acts. I congratulate her on the excellence of her career to date and look forward to her enjoying many more years of success.\n\nThe link to the official website for Diana Krall can be found here.\n\nThe link to the video for the song “The Look of Love” by Diana Krall can be found here. ***The lyrics version is here.\n\n***As always, all original content contained within this post remains the sole property of the author.

One of the things that is becoming clear to me along the way is that Jazz music is more than simply a genre of music. It is definitely part of something larger and grander. From everything that I am discovering, the story of Jazz music is completely interwoven with the story of the rise of Black culture in America. The giants of the genre are definitely reflective of the times they found themselves in and are fully deserving of credit for, not only surviving those times but finding ways to thrive and, in doing so, serving to elevate an entire race in the process. A second thing that I am learning is that the story of Jazz is one of important yet, incremental steps. The African rhythms inherent in field songs, marches and dances were combined with the music found in French and Latin cultures in the US South to lay the foundation for what was to become Jazz as we know it. Then came the children of those first freed slaves who traveled about in search of places to call home. In doing so, a new form of music called Ragtime was invented. Ragtime was built on a structure of syncopated rhythms and flourished in bars, honkytonks and brothels where musicians of colour such as Scott Joplin were allowed to play. Today’s post takes us to the next phase in this cultural evolution, the great migration north. This, in turn, will lead us into a discussion of an era that opened the door for the Golden Age of Jazz called The Harlem Renaissance. There are whole books written and university courses taught on the subject of The Harlem Renaissance. My little blog posts will only skim the surface of this historical time but, having said that, I want to stress that the ramifications of what went on during this time period were essential to the formation of Jazz as a music genre and are so culturally important that the impact of The Harlem Renaissance continues to be felt to this very day. While I shall talk about individual musicians, songs, venues and concerts in the posts that follow this one, none would have been possible without The Harlem Renaissance and, specifically for the purposes of today’s post, none would have been possible if not for a bit of musical theatre called Shuffle Along.\n\nWithout going into a lot of detail, The Harlem Renaissance truly began when the second generation of freed slaves decided to stop moving about in search of safe places to live in the southern US and instead, opted to settle in one spot to the north. That spot turned out to be in upper Manhattan Island in a place that became known as Harlem. Moving northward seemed the safest bet for these families. The Emancipation Proclamation was only a few decades old when the great migration northward happened. In that time, no societal switch had been flipped which made racial harmony appear as if by magic. Although the laws stated that they were free and equal citizens, the reality was that life remained dangerous for people of colour. It was also a fact that job opportunities were fewer and farther between. Let’s not even get started about the state of public education at the time. Needless to say, staying in the southern states was problematic for many families so, in the hopes of discovering a safer, more tolerant land of opportunity, many opted to journey to the northern states. Some even came all the way to Canada. One of the things that fuelled their dreams was the changing nature of employment in America. The end of WWI coincided with a ramping up of manufacturing and industrialization in the northern states in particular. There were jobs aplenty and not enough people to fill them. So, for the first time in US history, people of colour were actually encouraged/recruited to move north and take on these industrial jobs. As mentioned above, one place that was large enough to accommodate such an influx was Harlem.\n\nAs the great migration commenced and people of colour began filing into Harlem, a community of people with similar life experiences and dreams took shape. In due time, members of that community felt the need to develop an official sense of organizational structure that reflected and promoted the needs and aspirations of people of colour. Thus, The National Association for the Advancement of People of Colour (the N.A.A.C.P.) was formed. As part of the NAACP’s mandate, it was felt that developing and establishing the cultural traditions of people of colour was of paramount importance and so, the Arts were given top priority. In this environment, poets such as Langston Hughes came to prominence. Musicians such as Cab Colloway and Duke Ellington became famous. Artists, writers, singers, dancers and composers were all placed at the forefront of a cultural wave whose aim was to give breadth and scope to the lives of people of colour. More than that, the mandate was to promote the idea of people of colour as being human beings worthy of consideration, compassion, equality and respect. It sounds like a logical and obvious thing to aspire to but in the early 1900s, even a gathering spot like Harlem was not a paradise.\n\nWhen it came to entertainment, the ability of black performers to perform on public stages was still highly regulated. The entertainment industry was primarily controlled by white people for the entertainment pleasure of white audiences. The stories being told on these stages were always shown through the lens of white history and culture. When musicians and entertainers of colour wished to perform, they were either shunted to the sidelines and forced to work in brothels or speakeasys or else, they had to enter the world of white entertainment in ways that were acceptable to white audiences. At the turn of the century, being “acceptable to white audiences” meant that black entertainers had to accept the role of minstrels or jokesters. Blackface makeup was quite common. Many of the songs sung or jokes told all contained elements of subject matter that would be considered highly racist today such as the songs being sung about not being able to tell black people apart. Such songs were openly called “coon” songs and were wildly popular at the time. In such an environment, some people such as Scott Joplin opted to not play along. Instead, he attempted to host his own musicals and to write and perform his own symphonies, in addition to playing his repertoire of Ragtime tunes. While he was able to make a small living by playing in brothels and saloons, he tended to live from week to week and rarely had enough funds available to mount full size stage performances of his highly innovative and original work. Those entertainers of colour who did decide to play the white man’s game did so knowing that self-deprecation and racial submissiveness was the price of admission. It was hard to build a sense of cultural pride when artists were forced to make a public mockery of the very culture they wished to promote.\n\nWhen the NAACP formed, one of the very first decisions made was to change the way people of colour were presented on the stages of America. It was felt…and rightfully so…that one of the ways to have their stories properly told was to take control of the environment in which plays, musicals and other revues were held. Entering into this scenario was a songwriting pair known as Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle. Blake was the songwriter and Sissle wrote the musical structure. Together the pair had performed for audiences of all races. Often they were the only performers of colour on the particular bill they happened to be part of because there were strict rules in those days that limited stage time to one performer or duo of colour per show. As a result, Blake and Sissle had rarely ever worked with other performers of colour before. That was soon about to change. With the encouragement of those in the NAACP, Blake and Sissle joined forces with another pair of artists known as Flournoy Miller and Aubrey Lyles. Miller and Lyles were a comedy duo and had grown tired of having to put their own race down all of the time in their act. So, they wrote a book called Shuffle Along. This book featured characters who were all people of colour. But what set the story apart for the times was that these characters were not presented as caricatures of black people for the consumption of white audiences. Instead, the characters were presented as intelligent, caring, compassionate, completely self-actualized human beings. The plotline of the story revolved around an election for the mayor of a small town. Never before had a story been written in which people of colour were presented in leadership roles normally reserved for whites. Blake and Sissle were brought in to turn Miller and Lyles’ book into a full-fledged Broadway musical. They did this by reaching into the archive of their own musical material for most of the songs. But they did create three original songs specifically for the play. It is these three songs, two in particular “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Love Will FInd a Way”, that helped to elevate Shuffle Along into the realm of one of the most significant and historically important cultural events of all time in America.\n\nShuffle Along would have been considered to be a significant enough cultural milestone simply based upon the fact that it was the first Broadway musical that featured an all-black cast whose job it was to tell a story uniquely from the perspective of people of colour. This musical was staged in a theatre in which black audiences were permitted to sit in the lower bowl, instead of being forcibly restricted to sitting in the back rows of the upper balcony, which was standard segregationist policy in those days. Shuffle Along helped launch the musical careers of performers such as Adelaide Hall, Josephine Baker, Paul Robeson and Bill “Mr. Bojangles” Robinson. But it was the inclusion of those two afore-mentioned songs that is really important.\n\nIn the history of our world, there have been several instances in which genocide has occurred. Genocide is an event in which one socio-demographic group attempts to erase the existence of a second socio-demographic group by enacting systemic policies that often end up leading to mass murder. The Holocaust, the Rwandan Genocide and perhaps, even what is happened in Israel as you read these words, are examples of genocide in action. One of the common methodologies used by the perpetrators of genocide is to de-humanize their victims. One of the ways that this is done is by publicly referring to them in terms that make them seem less than human. Words such as “vermin” and “cockroach” are commonly used by one side to refer to their foes. In this way, it is easier to convince whole masses of people to engage in genocide when their cause is addressed in terms of exterminating vermin, as opposed, to their fellow human beings. When the NAACP formed, they realized that by controlling the narrative of the stories used to describe people of colour, they stood a better chance of creating a picture of an entire race of people who would be recognized for their humanity. Thus, for Shuffle Along, Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle created two songs called “I’m Just Wild About Harry” and “Love Will Find a Way” that showed people of colour enjoying romance FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER ON STAGE!!! I find this absolutely stunning! Loving and being loved is, in my mind, one of the most primal and fundamental aspects of being human. To think that there was a time when society at large didn’t accord people of colour the fundamental right to feel loved is breathtakingly astonishing to me. The creation and inclusion of those two songs was deemed to be such a risky endeavour that Blake and Sissle almost withdrew them from the score. It was only after seeing them performed during dress rehearsals that their importance as a cultural milestone became apparent. Shuffle Along opened in a theatre that was north of the traditional Broadway district but the musical was considered to be part of the Broadway season nonetheless. The show ran for over 500 performances making it the most successful and longest lasting musical of its kind in history at the time. However, years after it ended its run, Shuffle Along was revived in the late 1960s and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Musical in 1970. But, significantly, what evolved out of the success of Shuffle Along was that it was just as popular with white audiences as it was with black audiences. The crossover nature of its success helped to open the doors for so many other performers of colour to walk through in the decades that followed. When we focus on the likes of Duke Ellington in a future post, we will see how his success was helped in large part by the success of Shuffle Along and how it prepared white audiences for a truer picture of who people of colour were as humans and how amazing so much of their culture actually was.\n\nThe Harlem Renaissance lasted until the onset of the Great Depression. To say that it was a golden age for the cultural evolution of people of colour is as big an understatement as I can make. In the weeks to come, we will meet and learn all about some of the kings and queens of the Golden Age of Jazz. Their stories intertwine with those of The Harlem Renaissance. What a time it must have been for those who were there! For many of them, they had grandparents, still living, who had actually been subjected to slavery. To think that in the space of less than half a century, people of colour would be telling their own stories while staging the first all-black Broadway musical. Those must have seemed like heady times, indeed. However, to think that declaring the humanity inherent in an entire race of people was seen as risky and daring says a lot about the world even at that time. Being together in Harlem may have seemed like a more welcoming environment but life was never really easy for people of colour as we shall see in the weeks to come.\n\nThank you, as always, for reading my words. I write them with deep humility and with much respect for the people involved. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and welcome your presence each step of the way. Take care.
