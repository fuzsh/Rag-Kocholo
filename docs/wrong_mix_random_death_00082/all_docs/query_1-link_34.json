        "text": "I just finished up an audiobook that I still can’t believe I stuck with. And now, preparing for a review I see it has an astounding #12 on Amazon Charts. Obviously, I’m the wrong generation for this one, but it got me thinking of two books I’ve read and listened to this year that still reverberate that didn’t make the same distinction. Why?*\n\nFirst, back in February, I read The Great Gimmelmans by Lee Matthew Goldberg.\n\nIt left me speechless. The fast-paced narrative follows the thoughts of middle child Aaron Gimmelman. Their family has had catastrophic reversals of fortune with the loss of his father’s job. Aaron manages to become the voice of reason for the family despite his parents going off the deep end. I kept rooting for a miracle and waiting for the author to pull a rabbit out of the hat. It’s a strongly mixed emotional message, dark, suspenseful, and full of twists, surprises.\n\nThen there is Small Mercies by Dennis Lehane. Seriously, this is a shocker. It’s enraging, gripping, and unfortunately so real it breaks your heart. In 70s Boston, a single mother is struggling. She’s a scrapper, strong, but there comes a time she’ll break. The novel is dark, extremely atmospheric of the time and locality. The author nails the main character. If you missed it—don’t.\n\nNow, I finished Funny Story. And there is nothing funny about it. I’ll give you a taste of the Book Blurb:\n\nDaphne is “Stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak.\n\n“Scruffy and chaotic…Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned up Daphne.”\n\nMy Thoughts\n\nYes, of course, the two are thrown together as roommates and I’ll bet you can guess what’s going to happen immediately. They decide they must provide a “fake” new love relationship to mess with their ex-es.\n\nDaphne is damaged, of course, having lived a horrible childhood. Poor baby. She really loves her mother. She doesn’t her absentee father. She has issues. So many issues.\n\nMiles is damaged, having lived a horrible childhood. He hates his mother. He has issues. So many issues.\n\nWhen Daphne and Miles get together for other than “fake”, they usually end with an argument, most times initiated by Miles. And then begins the introspection. Boy, do we get the introspection! (Well…they argue a lot.) Or maybe it just seemed half the book was introspection by one or the other but I’d stopped caring a long time ago when I realized Daphne, smart as she is, was bound and determined to make the same mistakes over and over and …\n\nThey weren’t relatable (at least for me) and Miles didn’t come close to being a romantic interest, declaring more than once he still loved Petra. Duh. She still didn’t get it?\n\nRosepoint Rating: Two point Five Stars\n\nBook Details\n\nGenre: Romantic Comedy, Contemporary Romance\n\nPublisher: Penguin Audio\n\nAuthor: Emily Henry\n\nNarrator: Julia Whelan\n\nASIN: B0CCPPQ38D\n\nPublication Date: April 23, 2024\n\nSource: Library\n\nTitle Links: Funny Story [Amazon]\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nAbout the Author: Emily Henry is the #1 New York Times and #1 Sunday Times bestselling author of Happy Place, Book Lovers, People We Meet on Vacation, and Beach Read.

These opinions are my own.\n\n©2024 V Williams\n\n*Now I see that Small Mercies was selected by Amazon as Best Books of 2023\n\nin Historical Mysteries\n\nBook Blurb:\n\nA MILESTONE IN HISTORICAL MYSTERY FICTION AS MAISIE DOBBS TAKES HER FINAL BOW\n\nLondon, 1945: Four adolescent orphans with a dark wartime history are squatting in a vacant Belgravia mansion—the owners having fled London under heavy Luftwaffe bombing. Psychologist and Investigator Maisie Dobbs visits the mansion on behalf of the owners and discovers that a demobilized soldier, gravely ill and reeling from his experiences overseas, has taken shelter with the group.\n\naisie’s quest to bring comfort to the youngsters and the ailing soldier brings to light a decades-old mystery concerning Maisie’s first husband, James Compton, who was killed while piloting an experimental fighter aircraft. As Maisie unravels the threads of her dead husband’s life, she is forced to examine her own painful past and question beliefs she has always accepted as true.\n\nThe award-winning Maisie Dobbs series has garnered hundreds of thousands of followers, audiences drawn to a woman who is of her time, yet familiar in ours—and who inspires with her resilience and capacity for endurance. This final assignment of her own choosing not only opens a new future for Maisie and her family, but serves as a fascinating portrayal of the challenges facing the people of Britain at the close of the Second World War.\n\nMy Review:\n\nThe eighteenth in the series and I didn’t realize when I got it, intended to be the last. As I read it, however, it seemed an obvious goodbye; farewell.\n\nThis is one of those series where the protagonist actually ages with the years, beginning in 2003 as a teen in the early twentieth century and ending in 2024 having lived through two world wars. This book ends with the end of WWII in 1945, post-war UK.\n\nThe author does a beautiful job of molding a young woman through her service as a young maid to becoming a nurse during the war and extending her expertise to becoming a private investigator, psychologist. She has endured love and lost it, experienced the death of both husband and child but she never turned inward, instead becoming a compassionate support for post-war individuals and their stories.\n\nThis story is about the discovery of children who, like many post-war individuals, discovered empty or abandoned homes in which to squat. The children eventually tell a harrowing story of the service to their country they were to execute should there have been an invasion of the English shores. It’s a shocking story now becoming familiar. A sad testament to the use of one last desperate commodity.\n\nMaisie also begins to uncover secrets tied to her own past when yet another revelation is made that has her digging into the death of her first husband. The dual plot line leads to doors that will open to a peaceful future and quell heartaches she’s failed to conquer. A lovely conclusion pulling together threads not closed prior to Book 18.\n\nBack in February 2022, I read To Die But Once and greatly enjoyed it, vowed to read more in the series. It’s a great historical novel with the mystery well drawn and satisfying then in the conclusion. I can recommend to any who enjoys a detective story authentically mixed with WWII wartime drama.\n\nThis installment signals the end of an era, sad to say of a lovely series that draws you in and invests in the characters so you might very well wish to begin with Book 1. The narrator does an emotional job of it, conveying her own goodbye.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my honest opinions.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Four point Five Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Historical Mysteries, Women Sleuth Mysteries\n\nPublisher: Recorded Books\n\nASIN: B0CQZ3TJG1\n\nListening Length: 10 hrs 6 mins\n\nNarrator: Orlagh Cassidy\n\nPublication Date: June 4, 2024\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Link: The Comfort of Ghosts [Amazon-US]\n\nAmazon-UK\n\nBarnes & Noble\n\nKobo\n\nThe Author:\n\nJacqueline Winspear is the author of eighteen novels in the award-winning, New York Times, National and International bestselling series featuring psychologist-investigator Maisie Dobbs.

But Hazel’s not the only relic of the past to return: a drought has descended on the region, and as the water level in the lake drops, long-hidden secrets begin to emerge…including evidence that may help finally explain the mystery of her mother’s disappearance.\n\nRiveting and suspenseful, Daughter of Mine is Megan Miranda’s best novel yet, filled with “delicious twists, dark secrets, and a deadly past” (Ashley Elston, New York Times bestselling author of First Lie Wins) that will keep you listening late into the night.\n\nMy Review:\n\nNot my first dance with Megan Miranda and her style of writing–slow burn dark family secrets held tightly to the chest with closed fists and set determined jaw. I found much the same in The Last to Vanish.\n\nThe first and most obvious twist in this novel is the way the author sets out the timeline and chapters, fusing Hazel Sharp’s story with an area-wide ongoing drought and beginning each chapter with the number of days without rain. Indeed, it’s changing the landscape of her childhood home and Mirror Lake is now revealing secrets that directly impact her.\n\nHazel has returned after her father dies to discover, and to her brother’s shock, that he left his home and property to her—not them. She is bewildered; they are disgusted. It’s not as if they were ever close as step-siblings.\n\nHer father was a respected law enforcement officer of the community when her mother up and left—never to return. The devastation and feelings of abandonment have never really left. But the cars being exposed by receding waters have opened a shocking new twist to the story—what really happened to her mother?\n\nClever, the way the chapters add atmospheric tension to the plot as Hazel grapples with her brothers over the home and now whether or not her dad might have had something to do with her mother’s disappearance. The heat causes rise to short tempers; everyone is on edge.\n\nWhile there was interest in the storyline, I could not fully engage with Hazel nor wrap my head around the backstories of her brothers…(I don’t remember them ever being designated as “step”). So many family secrets, not much of a bond. She and her mother came rather late in their family story.\n\nLose attention until the next little twist, then re-engage. It’s a weird family dynamic. Once the rain begins the pace rushes into denouement and it’s over. Eh, okay.

As a Potawatomi woman, she learned from elders, family, and history that the Potawatomi, as well as a majority of other cultures indigenous to this land, consider plants and animals to be our oldest teachers.\n\nIn Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowing together to reveal what it means to see humans as “the younger brothers of creation”. As she explores these themes, she circles toward a central argument: The awakening of a wider ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgement and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the world. Once we begin to listen for the languages of other beings, we can begin to understand the innumerable life-giving gifts the world provides us and learn to offer our thanks, our care, and our own gifts in return.\n\nMy Review:\n\nOkay, another non-fiction for the year, but one beautifully and eloquently told by an esteemed professor. As a botanist and daughter of indigenous peoples, her heart and mind are very closely associated with the earth and all her gifts. Indeed, a central theme of the book is reciprocity, second only to gratitude, in which much time and celebration is given to Mother Earth and her abundant gifts acknowledged.\n\nBeautifully written, filled with prose, the novel reflects her deeply rooted love of nature and the tools mankind uses and/or continues to overlook or squander.\n\nSo many interesting chapters, so much to learn, so many mysteries exposed in a book that carefully folds together the science and spirit of how and why everything we see has a reason.\n\nI’ve often heard the old adage that a natural remedy is often and miraculously found near a poisonous one. I was told to beware of the poison ivy in my fairy garden, but I don’t have any Jewelweed down there, nor have I been in contact with the nasty ivy.\n\nI loved the chapter on the “Three Sisters”, the combination of beans, squash, and corn, but really that is just one example of symbiotic plants and a whole study in itself. I also loved learning all about the maple trees of the Great Lakes region as we are still fairly new to the area and so much to learn. The cycle of the trees is a fascination as well.\n\nOf course, the indigenous sensibilities permeate throughout the book, adding an aesthetic or ethereal quality to the prose. If there was some duplication or overly extended explanation of something that might have been mentioned before, that was okay with me. At my age, it doesn’t hurt to hear or read it more than once.\n\nThe author narrated the audiobook and, I thought, did a lovely job of it. I downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library. These are my own opinions.\n\nRosepoint Publishing: Four point Five Stars\n\nBook Details:\n\nGenre: Indigenous Demographic Studies, Native American Demographic Studies, Botany & Plants\n\nPublisher: Tantor Audio\n\nASIN: B01H4772CU\n\nListening Length: 16 hrs 44 mins\n\nNarrator: Robin Wall Kimmerer\n\nPublication Date: December 27, 2015\n\nSource: Local Library (Audiobook Selections)\n\nTitle Link: Braiding Sweetgrass [Amazon]\n\nThe Author: Robin Wall Kimmerer is a mother, scientist, decorated professor, and enrolled member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation.

The only catch: Evie Porter doesn’t exist.\n\nThe identity comes first: Evie Porter. Once she’s given a name and location by her mysterious boss, Mr. Smith, she learns everything there is to know about the town and the people in it. Then the mark: Ryan Sumner. The last piece of the puzzle is the job.\n\nEvie isn’t privy to Mr. Smith’s real identity, but she knows this job isn’t like the others. Ryan has gotten under her skin, and she’s starting to envision a different sort of life for herself. But Evie can’t make any mistakes—especially after what happened last time.\n\nEvie Porter must stay one step ahead of her past while making sure there’s still a future in front of her. The stakes couldn’t be higher—but then, Evie has always liked a challenge. .\n\nMy Review:\n\nARGH! I’m fence sitting on this one! If I had to give it definitive stars, I guess I’d have to point to my confusion mainly with Devon. The book does have a hook at the beginning and does a nice job of steering you straight into a well-plotted storyline about a girl who evolved as she must to survive, given her lack of support. Her mother was dying. Slowly. And needed a lot of meds. Evie found a way.\n\nWell, NOW she’s Evie. It wasn’t always thus. She’s smart, however, evolving as she must always take it to the next level until she is noticed by Mr. Smith. And Mr. Smith has specific jobs that she may be tailored for—a profitable experience for them both—until she gets a little cocky.\n\nBut Evie is tough, dangerous even, and she’s learned to be observant. She’s successful.\n\nUntil her next mark is Ryan.\n\nLots of twists and turns here, Evie playing games with Mr. Smith. But is she smarter than him or being played herself? And where, how did I miss the entry of Devon? Once revealed, he continues to show up like a bad penny—although admittedly—just in time.\n\nThe timeline has a habit of switching up or back as well, filling in a lot of voids, but unraveling my investment in the current storyline. The pacing is interesting. The characters are engaging and I must admit I did enjoy the reveal, the conclusion as unbelievable as it was.\n\nThis is one of those that had me scratching my head. I just read…what? You may love it if a fan of psychological thrillers with an unusual plot. Just be prepared to suspend some disbelief.\n\nNarrated by one of my favorite narrators–as always an incredible job. I downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library.

It’s official. I’ve given up on live plants and planted plastic instead. Animals 1 – farmer 0. It’s a tie on the veggie bed with chicken wire and mesh around my tender plants. They did manage to penetrate to a vigorous bean plant and that plant won’t be going anywhere now. Love the animals, but…\n\nPunkin the Pom is carefully beginning to enjoy her walks.* The CE, having a closer bond, is trusting her more and she’s taking advantage. Otherwise, still accepting few treats, no toys, no offers of companionship, and housetraining is a throw of the dice.\n\nJune was a struggle, once again, with the CE’s attention divided and my spending more time in the kitchen. It didn’t help that I decided my next personal challenge was to make a sourdough starter and produce a loaf of sourdough bread. I’m currently on the third try which is not looking good right now at Day 4 of a 6-7 day cycle of starter. Of course, it’s also that time of the year when the gardens and outdoor activities take precedence.\n\nI’m thinking, if not a sabbatical, then a greatly reduced schedule through July and probably August. Most of my reading now includes audiobooks as time for reading has been greatly reduced. Of the twelve books, half were audiobooks!\n\nAs always, links on titles are to our reviews that include purchase or source information.\n\nThe Curse of King Midas by Colleen M Story (CE review)\n\nLockdown by Sara Driscoll\n\nThe Cyanide Canary by Robert Dugoni and Joseph Hilldorfer (audiobook)\n\nThe Wild Road Home by Melissa Payne\n\nIf Something Happens to Me by Alex Finlay (audiobook)\n\nThe 6:20 Man by David Baldacci (audiobook)\n\nThe Woman in Me by Britney Spears (audiobook)\n\nBest House on the Block by T R Ragan\n\nThe Husbands by Holly Gramazio (audiobook)\n\nPrevailing Wind by Thomas Dolby (CE review)\n\nBreach by Holly S Roberts (blog tour)\n\nBeach Town by Mary Kay Andrews (audiobook)\n\nI really loved The Wild Road Home—it was addictive, kept me reading, and I was thoroughly invested in the well-developed characters. It fell just one-half star short of five, however, and the CE easily gave his book, Prevailing Wind, five stars even with a rather slow start. It’s a toss up, but I’ll have to give the nod to his book.\n\nFavorite for June – Prevailing Wind by Thomas Dolby\n\nMy Reading Challenges page…Reading Challenges page—well, you know the score.

But her last project literally went up in flames, and her career is on the verge of flaming out. Greer has been given one more chance, if she can find the perfect undiscovered beach hideaway for a big-budget movie. She zeroes in on a sleepy Florida town called Cypress Key.\n\nBut Eben Thibadeaux, the town’s mayor, objects to Greer’s plan. A lifelong resident of Cypress Key, Eben wants the town to be revitalized, not commercialized. Greer has a way of making things happen, regardless of obstacles. And Greer and Eb are way too attracted to one another for either of them to see reason.\n\nBetween an ambitious director and his entourage―including a spoiled “It Boy” lead actor―who parachute into town, a conniving local ex-socialite, and a cast of local fangirls and opportunists who catch the movie bug, nothing is going to be the same in Cypress Key. Now Greer is forced to make some hard choices: about the people and the town she’s come to care about, and about her own life. True love is only for the movies, right? Can Greer find a way to be the heroine in her own life story? Told with inimitable heart and humor, Mary Kay Andrews’ Beach Town is the perfect summer destination.\n\nMy Review:\n\nAh, the ole hate-to-love trope apparently working well a decade ago and a favorite of the romance genre. Yes, it must be getting mighty cold down below if I’m reading a romance novel.\n\nI like the unique concept of a movie location scout for a big picture production searching for the perfect location of a small sea coastal town setting. In this case, the MC stumbles upon Cypress Key, a seedy little town past its heyday in the Florida Keys.\n\nGreer Hennessy discovers the romance of Florida comes with heat, humidity, and bugs—the giant, flying-at-you palmettos who look like monster cockroaches. Nasty things. They have little barbs on their feet so when they land on you, they can latch on. Yeah, been there, done that.\n\nBut the location turns out to supply just about everything on their must-have list, including an old building to blow up for the climax. The problem, of course, is Eben Thibadeaux, the town mayor and engineer who doesn’t want anything blown up. He wants to fix up. The owner has other ideas.\n\nI loved the cast and crew, CJ is a hoot, and the enthusiastic director is so authentic you can see him yelling directions through a megaphone. The main character is a damaged soul, childhood and all that, and Eben (since I was listening to the audiobook) sounded like Ed every time it was his dialogue or referred to and, again, did not wholly engage with him.\n\nIt’s a fun little book, getting into the nitty gritty of what it takes to be a location manager, the constant calls of problems, not the least of which is the spoiled and entitled young male star, full of himself.\n\nI thought it was engaging, entertaining, and I enjoyed the sense of humor, but just couldn’t buy into the conclusion and resolution. Fanciful, it went overboard into disbelief. Other than that, I’d recommend the audiobook ably narrated by Kathleen McInerney.\n\nI downloaded a copy of this audiobook from my local well-stocked library.
