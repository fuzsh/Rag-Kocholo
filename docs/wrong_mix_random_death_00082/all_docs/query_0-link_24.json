        "text": "Synopsis\n\nAct 1\n\nSea levels are rising; waters dominate land and humans scramble for their survival in search for higher ground. A young child finds herself separated from her family and ends up in a flooded city, deserted by its human inhabitants. Monuments have been uprooted and rearranged, and animals of all shapes and sizes have congregated here and formed an uneasy alliance as they try to live with this new unreliable climate. They have claimed this cityscape as their own – marking their territories in libraries, supermarkets, government buildings and even places of worship.\n\nThe child is discovered by the wolf pack led by Raksha and Rama. Raksha wants to keep the child, but Rama insists that humans bring danger and they must destroy it. Raksha protects Mowgli and presents her to an animal council, led by Akela, a dog, and with the watchful eyes in the sky of Chil, the kite. The animals speak of a mysterious hunter, a human who has been cast out by his own kind. The hunter has returned to these lands and keeps the animals in constant fear. After much deliberation, the child is accepted by the council and the naming process begins – Mowgli. Mowgli is set to work straight away; she must prove her worth and help the animals in their search for food. Maybe human instincts are just what they need.\n\nMowgli finds herself in the company of Bagheera, a kidnapped albino panther who grew up in a palace, and Baloo, an escaped dancing bear. However, on their quest for food, Mowgli is taken by the Bandar-log; lab monkeys who have had all kinds of experiments done on them. Through cunning the Bandar-log outwit Baloo and Bagheera and steal Mowgli. Bagheera and Baloo must now find an animal capable of striking fear into the Bandar-log. After all, they are not animals of the tree world. They seek out Kaa, a rock python, who has escaped from captivity but still lives with the traumas of a lifetime stuck behind a glass viewing screen.\n\nAct 2\n\nMowgli is taken to the Bandar-log’s lair, a ransacked government building. The Bandar-log are no strangers to humankind – they come from testing laboratories and regurgitate commercial jingles and political rants they heard from their cages. They listened, copied and aped the humans, but now they want to become them. Mowgli is the missing piece of the puzzle. A human child to teach them how to fully become human.\n\nWith the help of Kaa, Baloo and Bagheera rescue Mowgli from the hands of the Bandarlog just at the moment she is about to help them create fire: the most feared possession of mankind. Animals can’t control this. Mankind can.\n\nWhen Mowgli is saved, the trio return to the council where Hathi, the leader of the elephants, tells them of their ancient tale, back to the time when the jungles they once knew were created.\n\nBut when the hunter finally breaches their territory, and shoots down Chil, the animals know that this spells the beginning of the end of the peace they have forged together. Mowgli, remembering her mother’s words throughout her journey, decides to stand up and fight for her newfound friends and seeks out the hunter and ends his savagery.\n\nProgram Note\n\nAkram Khan, Director & Choreographer\n\nI want to dive into the myths of today, and children’s stories of tomorrow. Hence, I want to find a way to take a known, familiar story and observe it through the lens of today’s children, my children, our children, who are and will become our present and future storytellers.\n\nWhy?\n\nThe Jungle Book’s story has always been close to me. Not only because I had played the role of Mowgli in an Indian dance production as a young boy, but more because of the three deep lessons it held within it, that I have since carried with me throughout my life. The lessons of commonality between species, the binding interdependence between humans, animals and nature, and finally, a sense of family and our need to belong.\n\nWe are now living in unprecedented and uncertain times, not only for our species but for all species on this planet. And the root cause of this conundrum is because we have forgotten our connection to our home, our planet. We all inhabit it, we all take from it, and we all build on it, but we have forgotten to return our respect for it.\n\nI believe that we must make changes from the grass roots up if we are to see a brighter future. And so I feel compelled to share the story – lovingly known as The Jungle Book – with children and adults from all cultures, in order to re-learn what we, as a species, have so conveniently forgotten. And I believe that the strongest and deepest way to tell this story is through the magic of dance, music and theatre.\n\nWhat?\n\nThis production traces the original story by Rudyard Kipling, but this particular version is very much my own interpretation of the original. Mowgli and all the known characters from the original are in this new version, with a new original score.\n\nHow?\n\nI am extremely conscious of the deep messages within the original work. But I am also aware of the potency and relevance of these messages for today’s world. And I have always believed that before words comes actions. So, I decided to approach this production with a direct action towards climate change.\n\nClimate change is and will continue to affect all living creatures on this beautiful planet. So then how do we create a work that uses less sets, so we can travel lighter when touring? Since lockdown, I have come to appreciate technology, in ways that I did not before COVID-19. And that’s simply because it has allowed me to stay connected with my loved ones, my artistic team and the wider world. Without the use of technology, I would have felt truly alone. And so, for Jungle Book reimagined, the stage is nearly empty – there is no traditional physical set. To achieve this, I explored the use of technology, projections and film as the non-physical set. We must not forget that most often, great storytelling can be told by the simplest of tools. Our bodies, our voices, and our conviction in that story.\n\nThe Process of Reimagining Jungle Book\n\nSharon Clark, Dramaturgical Advisor\n\n\"We humans have become geological agents, by changing the most basic physical processes of the earth.\" - Amitav Ghosh\n\nThe process of reimagining Jungle Book was ignited by Akram’s provocation as to how the production could, through the story of Mowgli’s adventures, explore a near future world that nature is hungrily starting to reclaim. A world where human relationship with the wild is changing and the interconnectivity between animal and human is becoming more complex and precarious.\n\nThe role of water in this future world became an imperative in creative explorations – the increasing lack of it in certain parts of the world and the huge rise in sea levels in others. So the creative team began to explore the places where water strips land and reclaims land.\n\nIt was from this volatile world of water that Mowgli’s journey began to emerge. It felt more and more urgent that in this reimagination Mowgli is born of an indigenous tribe from South-East Asia. Mowgli’s parents have stowed the family away on a huge container ship escaping with thousands of others from a homeland ravaged by drought.\n\nOn this huge floating island of migration, Mowgli falls overboard and is carried by the water to a modern, high-rise city that has been deserted by its human inhabitants due to a tumultuous change in its climate – the winters bring huge floods and the summer’s perilous drought. In this city, animals who have escaped from the zoos, from the hands of private owners, from laboratories have formed an uneasy alliance, a ramshackle pack whose instincts allow them to understand the natural ebb and flow of this new unreliable climate. They now claim this cityscape as their own – marking their territories in the libraries, the parliament buildings, the cathedrals.\n\nAnd so, this is the jungle of our story. A jungle where a menagerie of animals forges an uneasy alliance to take a stand against a cunning and ruthless predator who they have long feared to name. The jungle where Mowgli finds the most unlikely allies in an aged albino panther and a geriatric bear who lives on past glories. A jungle where Mowgli is taught to listen to the water rhythms of this new world to combat the dangerous outsider who carries the gun.\n\nOur creative ambition in reimagining Jungle Book was to forge a compelling visual story that deftly steers its audiences through the slapstick antics of Baloo and Bagheera, the drama of the chase as Mowgli is snatched from her pack and an intimate portrayal of a child and the mother she has lost.\n\nAkram Khan\n\nDirector & Choreographer\n\nAkram is one of the most celebrated and respected dance artists of today. In just over 23 years he has created a body of work that has contributed significantly to the arts in the UK and abroad. His reputation has been built on the success of imaginative, highly accessible and relevant productions such as Jungle Book reimagined, Outwitting the Devil, XENOS, Until the Lions, Kaash, iTMOi (in the mind of igor), DESH, Vertical Road, Gnosis and zero degrees.\n\nAs an instinctive and natural collaborator, Akram has been a magnet to world-class artists from other cultures and disciplines. His previous collaborators include the National Ballet of China, actress Juliette Binoche, ballerina Sylvie Guillem, choreographers/dancers Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Israel Galván, singer Kylie Minogue, indie rock band Florence and the Machine, visual artists Anish Kapoor, Antony Gormley and Tim Yip, writer Hanif Kureishi and composers Steve Reich, Nitin Sawhney, Jocelyn Pook and Ben Frost.\n\nAkram’s work is recognised as being profoundly moving, with intelligently crafted storytelling that is effortlessly intimate and epic. Described by the Financial Times as an artist “who speaks tremendously of tremendous things”, a highlight of his career was the creation of a section of the London 2012 Olympic Games Opening Ceremony that was received with unanimous acclaim.\n\nAs a choreographer Akram has developed a close collaboration with English National Ballet. He created the short piece Dust, part of the Lest We Forget program, which led to an invitation to create his own critically acclaimed version of the iconic romantic ballet Giselle. Creature was his latest work for English National Ballet.\n\nAkram has been the recipient of numerous awards throughout his career including the Laurence Olivier Award, the Bessie Award (New York Dance and Performance Award), the prestigious ISPA (International Society for the Performing Arts) Distinguished Artist Award, the Fred and Adele Astaire Award, the Herald Archangel Award at the Edinburgh International Festival, the South Bank Sky Arts Award and eight Critics’ Circle National Dance Awards. He was awarded an MBE for services to dance in 2005. He is an Associate Artist of Sadler’s Wells and Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts, London and Curve, Leicester."
