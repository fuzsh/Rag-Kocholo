        "text": "Twin Peaks is an odd show. I get that saying that is an understatement. But I’m not just talking about BOB possessing people or supernatural owls or even clairvoyant logs. That’s all just on the surface. Twin Peaks deals with some really dark subjects on a regular basis, and each episode ends with a twisted cliffhanger to pull you into the next episode.\n\nNo one would call Twin Peaks a comedy or even dramedy. And it’s not slice of life. Not on any plane of existence I’ve ever encountered. But what is it? Drama? Thriller? Mystery? It doesn’t seem to fit into any of those categories. And there some seriously disturbing material coming out of that show. Is it okay to laugh when that many people are encountering that much pain?\n\nYes.\n\nTwin Peaks works as a parody of soap operas and likes to point at itself with big neon signs that flash “ISN’T THIS RIDICULOUS?” Those are the moments when all the intensity pops its top, and we, as the audience, get to have a good laugh. Here are some times it happened to me. And likely happened to you too:\n\n*NOTE: At the point I’m writing this, there are only 4 episodes of the new series available to watch, so most of this list (but not quite all of it) is from the original series.\n\n10. Every Note to Diane\n\nI almost just said Agent Cooper’s introduction, but that’s just the first Diane tape. They’re all gold. Cooper rambles on about important and not so important things, until he’s gotten so far off topic that neither the audience, nor seemingly Cooper can remember what the note was originally supposed to be about.\n\nI can’t imagine having to wade through that many hours of basically just Cooper’s inner monologue. Okay, maybe I can. That actually sounds kind of fun.\n\nThey’re often used to punctuate an already funny moment, or used to let the audience know it’s okay to make light of an otherwise serious situation. The Diane tapes mean humor.\n\nDiane has yet to physically appear in the series, and for that reason is one of the most theorized about characters in the series. One of the more exciting theories that she’s gonna show up one of these weeks in the form of Laura Dern. Someone’s been peaking at my Christmas list.\n\n9. Nadine Tries Out for the Wrestling Team\n\nAfter Nadine wakes up from a coma, she’s lost all recent memory, but gained super strength. She often doesn’t realize her strength and seems confused as to why she keeps ripping doors of their hinges. Thinking she’s still a high school student, she gets a crush on one of the high school jocks, Mike.\n\nAfter doing a little too well at the cheerleading trials, Nadine visits the gym, where Mike is working out. There she impresses the wrestling coach with her strength, and he urges her to join the team, where she shows up Mike. Actually, it’s more like she flings him around like a rag doll. The coach is thrilled, and Nadine is pretty pleased with herself, but it takes Mike awhile to warm up to her (though he comes around in the end).\n\nSeeing someone so much smaller do so much damage so effortlessly with such joy is awesome to watch.\n\n8. Leo’s Homecoming Party\n\nAfter being shot, Leo is left in a vegetative state. His wife, Shelly, who he abused, and her new boyfriend, Bobby, bring him home from the hospital.\n\nLeo, who seems only vaguely aware of his surroundings, sits perfectly still while Shelly and Bobby throw a celebration around him, claiming it’s in his honor.\n\nThey cover him in streamers, affix a party hat to his head, and place a kazoo in his mouth, which makes a noise every time he breathes out. Bobby and Shelly play their kazoos along, anticipating when the next sound will come. They even get a little amorous in front of him.\n\nTwisted? Totally. Funny? Absolutely.\n\nThe wife beater deserves it.\n\n7. Ben Horne’s Civil War Reenactments\n\nI have conflicting feelings about Ben Horne. Like, he’s basically a terrible slimy scumbag pretty much of the time. But it seemed near the end, he honestly felt bad about not being a better father to Audrey, and in his own awful way was trying to make up for some of the horrible things he did. And Audrey’s my favorite. Don’t mess with her.\n\nRegardless, he has some outrageous and hilarious scenes throughout the series that, at the very least, make him interesting and, at the most, make him super fun to watch.\n\nAt one point, Ben goes…er…slightly mad, believing himself to be Robert E. Lee during the Civil War. While his family and friends are worried for him, they eventually give in, and the reenactments go from playing with toy soldiers to their dressing in period costumes and bringing in full on sets and props. Leave it to the Horne’s to embrace the crazy.\n\n6. Gordon Meets Shelly\n\nOh, Gordon.\n\nOne of the most notable things about his character is that he’s played by the series co-creator, David Lynch. That’s not to suggest that the character isn’t wonderful in his own right. He’s delightful.\n\nHe wears a hearing aid and speaks no softer than VERY LOUD at any point during the series. And that’s how everyone who speaks to him has to respond. Save this one exception.\n\nAs Cooper’s superior, Gordon drops into Twin Peaks every so often to check up and help out. At one point, he meets with Cooper at the Double R Diner, where he firsts sees Shelly, at her waitressing job, and immediately falls for her.\n\nHe approaches her and asks for coffee and pie and is shocked to discover that when she speaks, in her normal quiet register, he can hear her. This only makes him become further enamored with her, and Shelly comes to find him as delightful as we do.\n\nThey have several hilarious and endearing interactions together. Ultimately, it goes no further than a kiss (though that serves to make Bobby plenty jealous), but the relationship is exactly as it should be.\n\n5. “Don’t drink that coffee!”\n\nTo really drive home the fact that Twin Peaks is a small town, there are several scenes around Agent Cooper’s arrival that are a little odd. Things that he clearly isn’t expecting. Of course, Agent Cooper being Agent Cooper, this only serves to make him love the town even more.\n\nWhile he’s clearly in his own fish out of water story, in this moment there’s another fish that stands between him and his beloved coffee.\n\nWhen he’s visiting the home of Pete Martell, Pete gets him and Harry a cup of coffee and leaves the room. He comes running in a moment later, yelling, “Fellas, don’t drink that coffee!” just as they both take a big mouthful. By way of explanation, Pete continues, “You’d never guess. There was a fish…in the percolator! Sorry…”\n\n4. Room Service Brings Agent Cooper a Glass of Milk\n\nAgent Cooper gets shot in his hotel room, leaving us with one hell of a cliffhanger, but luckily the next episode brings us room service! An elderly man, who works at the hotel, arrives with the glass of warm milk that Agent Cooper requested.\n\nHe walks in, sees a bleeding Cooper lying on the floor, and…does nothing to help.\n\nHe seems concerned, but doesn’t really know what to do once he’s brought in the milk. And Cooper doesn’t ask him to do anything, so they just peer at each other, Cooper alarmed at having been shot, and the employee alarmed that a man is bleeding to death on the floor of his hotel room. Finally, he leans over Cooper. So Cooper can sign for the milk.\n\nThe scene is agonizingly long and slow, but that’s what makes it funny. The longer it goes, the more you think “surely, at some point, one of them will say something about the elephant in the room,” and neither ever does.\n\n3. The Llama Moment\n\nAn unscripted bit of interaction between Agent Cooper and a Llama.\n\nWhile investigating a case, Cooper and Harry pay a visit to a vet’s office.\n\nThe two are talking in the lobby when a woman passes between them. She’s holding the lead of a llama. Cooper and Harry are standing fairly close together, which seems to cause the llama to pause. It looks straight at Cooper, who returns the stare, and the llama walks on past. And the conversation continues as though nothing happened.\n\nBut it’s so unexpected and odd looking that it always gets a chuckle. And it’s Cooper and a llama. I don’t need more of a reason.\n\n2. Save the Pine Weasel\n\nThis whole charity event is bizarre. We knew it would be when it started with a fashion show featuring both Lucy and Andy.\n\nBut it reaches peak wtf when the Pine Weasel handler comes out on stage with said animal and is talking to Dick, who’s being his usual obnoxious self.\n\nApparently, the Pine Weasel thinks so too, because it goes from being very mild-mannered and agreeable to attacking Dick viciously. Dick screams in pain thrashing around with it clamped to his nose (it’s made even better by the fact that the real animal has been switched out, and he’s obviously tussling with a stuffed animal). He manages to pry it off his face and flings it into the crowd, who all fly into a panic, creating utter pandemonium.\n\nAudrey, who was onstage falls into the arms of the John Justice Wheeler, who was luckily standing near by, and they kiss for the first time as the charity goers scream all around them.\n\n1. Wally Brando\n\nThere are two kinds of people in this world: those who love this scene and those who are wrong.\n\nThe cast list for the third season of Twin Peaks is extensive. In addition to much of the main cast making a return, there were quite a few new celebrities on the list, including Michael Cera. Whether or not this role is a cameo, we can’t tell for sure. In the mind of David Lynch, it may have felt vitally important for this character to make an appearance (he is Lucy and Andy’s son after all) and then completely disappear.\n\nAnd that would be okay. This scene is completely joyous. Cera’s Marlon Brando impression is just good enough without being what you’d call a good impression. I don’t mean that as a sleight. It’s the reason this scene is the gold that it is. On top of that, all the actors look like they’re about to fall apart laughing at any second. The dialogue is ludicrous, while also dripping with Brando references, and the proud parents, just complete the insane picture.\n\nBut there are many more moments that made me laugh in both the old and the new series, and I’m so glad I get to pay another visit to Twin Peaks.\n\nIn case it wasn’t immensely clear from my blog banner, I really really really love 1951’s The Day the Earth Stood Still. Like, really a lot. It’s quintessential classic science fiction, what with its aliens and laser-eyed robots. Meanwhile, the plot, dealing with the Cold War and nuclear weapons, falls squarely into a bit of history that tends to repeat (see: current day).\n\nAnd, very briefly, I feel I should at least address that, yes, there’s a remake. I don’t hate the remake, and it definitely wasn’t as bad as I was expecting (shame on me), but it didn’t stick with me like the original version did. Often times I forget the remake exists altogether. It’s just sort of there, and that’s fine.\n\nI’d also like to make it very clear that the phrase “Klaatu barada nikto” did, in fact, originate from 1951’s The Day the Earth Stood Still and NOT 1992’s Army of Darkness. That’s just a fact. And for this post, I will be looking at the original context. No offense to Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell, or any of their fans. It was an homage when it was used in Army of Darkness. That’s the whole point. It did make me like Army of Darkness more, but please remember your good friend Klaatu when you next hear the phrase. Moving on!\n\nThe phrase turns out to be a set of instructions. For most of the movie, Klaatu inexplicably speaks perfect English. This is never really explained, but I also don’t really spend a lot of time wondering about it (until now. Dammit!), but he is from a different planet, which presumably has its own language. Gort, the giant robot, does not speak English. He doesn’t speak at all, actually, but he doesn’t seem to understand English. The only way anyone can communicate with him is in this alien language (and maybe some wavy hand gestures and flashlight speak on Klaatu’s part).\n\nThe problem with bringing Gort along to Earth is he’s very shoot-y and very protective of Klaatu, and if he sees anything that seems to pose a threat, like, say, an army’s worth of tanks pointed at him only 10 seconds after landing on a foreign landscape, he will laser-kill you. Klaatu was clearly not expecting humans to act the way humans act and flip out and assume that alien presence = alien threat. I wonder if Klaatu would still have brought Gort if he knew. Probably.\n\nFor most of the film, Klaatu, who looks human, walks around the city, meets people, and decides for the most part they’re pretty okay. He definitely doesn’t want to blow Earth up, but he’s super confused about this whole war thing and why humans bother about it.\n\nTo be clear, he walks around the city after being treated/captured by an army hospital that he was taken to because he got shot after being on Earth for, I think, less than 60 seconds. Like, he’s barely out of his ship. And then he has to escape from the hospital, because they want to do a bunch of weird tests on him. But he does have some human allies. There’s a little boy, Bobby, who sort of becomes Klaatu’s tour guide and then takes him home like a little lost puppy, and the boy’s mother, Helen, who helps Klaatu when it gets more dangerous and there are shoot-y people around. And there’s a scientist dude, but he doesn’t really have anything to do with this particular post.\n\nAnyway, Helen is trying to get Klaatu back to the ship, shoot-y people in pursuit, and Klaatu says something like, “well, this looks super bad, and I’m probably not gonna make it back to the ship, so I need to to do me a solid. Find Gort, and tell him ‘Klaatu barada nikto’, mmkay?” And sure enough (and spoilers, but the movie is over 60 years old), Klaatu gets shot. And dies. So Helen has to go find Gort and deliver the message.\n\nNow the full line she says is “Gort, Klaatu barada nikto.” And I think that “Gort” bit is actually significant. No one talks to Gort other than Klaatu for the whole movie. Until this moment, when a human speaks to him. But she addresses him, uses his name. It suggests that she knows him and understands something about him. And it manages to stop him from laser-killing her, which he very nearly does when he first sees her.\n\nSo what does the rest of the phrase mean? Oh, boy. Here’s the thing. It’s communicating a LOT of information for just three words. And the first word is just a name. Klaatu means Klaatu. The character. The words “barada nikto” indicate all of the following:\n\nKlaatu is dead. DO NOT SHOOT THINGS, especially the woman talking to you. As a matter of fact, go ahead take her into the ship (Side note: Klaatu’s ship is hella rad. And also appears to be bigger on the inside. Hmmm). She’ll be safe there. If she resists or doesn’t understand why you’re staggering towards her in a totally menacing way, go ahead and just pick her up and carry her inside. Next, go get Klaatu. Here’s the address (we don’t know where exactly Klaatu’s body was being kept (looks like some sort of prison cell), but Gort seems to know exactly where he’s going). Bring Klaatu back to the ship. Raise him from the dead. Then go into sleep mode. Zombie-Klaatu will take it from there.\n\nMy first thought is that we really need to streamline the English language. Or is it like text talk? Or maybe in Klaatu’s language every letter represents an entire idea. It may be like in Arrival where we can’t even comprehend the language, because it operates on a level of understanding that’s just beyond us. Or maybe the letters in the words “Klaatu barada nikto” are all pictorial symbols. Or maybe the writer needed to make up some compelling fake words in a fake language and thought “these’ll do.”\n\nWe’ll never know for sure. And that’s probably for the best. The words will live on. As words are wont to do. Cause it’s a nifty little sci-fi phrase to keep in your pocket. And as much as I hope the Force will be with you and that you live long and prosper, the last thing I’d like to tell you before I open the pod bay doors (Hal) and say so long and thanks for all the fish is Klaatu barada nikto.\n\nKLAATU BARADA NIKTO.\n\nBefore series 10 of Doctor Who could even begin, we got the news. It will be Peter Capaldi’s last. Say your good-bye’s and prepare for a new Doctor. I, for one, was sad. Am sad. I like Peter Capaldi, I like his take on the Doctor, I wanted to see what he’d be like under Chris Chibnall’s direction.\n\nMy rant a few months ago aside (the one about how the casting department should really shake up its lead character), I always like the Doctors. Maybe not at first, and maybe I miss the hell of certain ones in certain moments after they’ve gone, and maybe I like some portrayals more than others, but the Doctor is the Doctor is the Doctor. And the next person they cast in the role will certainly be the same.\n\nAnd we’ll have to say good-bye to our curmudgeonly Scottish punk rock Doctor to get there. Thanks, Capaldi. You were a blast. And while there’s a lot of speculation about just when and how he’ll go, we won’t really know for absolute certain until we’re sat in front of our screens and it’s happening. I’ve watched that second trailer about a dozen times, and even knowing it’s coming, that moment of the regeneration energy rising off his hand hits me like a punch in the gut. This one’s gonna hurt. But we’ve made it through every time before, and so I wanted to take a look at each regeneration in turn.\n\n11 into 12/Smith into Capaldi\n\nThis was the first regeneration I watched as it aired, and I’ve always found this one disappointing. Admittedly, I’m not the biggest fan of 11, but I deserved a good cry over his leaving (I mean, I cried when that triceratops died, I should certainly lose it when the Doctor goes). I didn’t. The plot of “The Time of the Doctor” felt needlessly convoluted, constantly tripping over itself. And it was an adventure I felt the audience was very much left out of. Why do you think we care about Clara’s awkward family dinner, when the Doctor has wooden Cybermen to fight?! On top of that, the regeneration kept beginning and then would be interrupted, and we didn’t get the definitive transition that we usually do. He de-aged, bopped his head, and BAM: 12.\n\nAnd the fact that he was regenerating at all was an anomaly. I get that it was a Christmas special, but I would have preferred the episode to be dedicated to saving him or resetting his regeneration cycle or whatever happened there (I’m still not sure). That being said, the last little speech is lovely, and his moment with the imagined Amy is very (bitter)sweet, and when he did regenerate we didn’t need to worry that they’d done anything silly with the character, like suddenly make him competent (“Do you happen to know how to fly this thing?”).\n\n10 into 11/Tennant into Smith (Take 2)\n\nTennant is one of my two favorites. Unfortunately, I got a bit jumbled up near the end of his tenure. Silly me, I thought series 5 came after series 4. So I plunged into “The Eleventh Hour” after “Journey’s End,” and thought to myself. That’s a bit odd. Did I miss something? Did they forgo a regeneration sequence?\n\nSo I looked it up and sure enough I had missed 5 episodes between series 4 and 5 (I refer to it as the secret season). So I went back, but something about seeing even just a bit of 11 before I got to say good-by to 10 really annoyed me. Still does. That being said, damn I feel so many emotions in “The End of Time.” He says good-bye to all his friends and then dies alone. *SOB*\n\n10 into 10/Tennant into Tennant (Take 1)\n\nRemember he actually regenerated earlier in the last episode of series 4 in what I firmly believe is one of the greatest fuck-you’s to the audience ever. After being separated from his great love, Rose Tyler, a couple seasons earlier, and her trying to reach him all season long and just missing him, they finally find each other. And just as they’re rushing into each other’s arms a motherfucking Dalek pops out and exterminates the Doctor. Such is their relationship.\n\nI do like that he’s not alone during this death. He’s with Rose, Donna, and Jack. Fair enough group for this Doctor’s exit. But then he uses the lizard hand that got chopped off (we knew there was a reason they were keeping that around) and regenerates into the exact same Doctor.\n\nBuuuut, it still counts as a life. the 11th Doctor says so when explaining that he’s out of regenerations. That’s right, Capaldi’s the 14th Doctor.\n\n9 into 10/Eccleston into Tennant\n\nCompletely traumatized. My first Doctor. And I didn’t know about regenerations. And I didn’t know I was gonna like Tennant so damn much. All I knew, was I just discovered a new show and 13 episodes in, they axed the main character. I was ready to abandon Doctor Who all together (thank God, I stuck around a few more episodes).\n\nIt was a long time before I was willing to admit that just maybe 9 wasn’t my favorite Doctor. His regeneration scene is still one of the most upsetting moments, but I’m also really happy to see 10 after it’s all over. So. Many. Feelings.\n\nWar into 9/Hurt into Eccleston\n\nI was caught slightly off guard by this one. I mean, I guess it makes sense. The war ended, so the War Doctor did too. But he didn’t seem injured or anything (and I really really hoped that we were gonna get just a cameo from Eccleston, and to be completely honest, I’m a little annoyed he didn’t agree to do just that one bit), but it was a good strong moment, and didn’t have the same sadness behind it that most regenerations do. This was the beginning, not the end. This is where the show picked back up and where many fans (myself included) started. And the War Doctor fully accepted it.\n\nAnd it meant we got to see a proper beginning and an ending to Hurt’s Doctor. All the Doctor’s deserve that. Even ones that only get a single episode (we’ll get to that other one in a second). And, no, I don’t think it’s tacky that they day John Hurt died there were pictures of his regeneration all over the internet. I thought it was beautiful. It was between that and Alien.\n\n8 into War/McGann into Hurt\n\nSo glad we finally got this sequence! One of the gifts we got going into the 50th anniversary was this little mini-episode called “The Night of the Doctor.” It was the 8th Doctor making the choice not to be the Doctor anymore. He would instead become a warrior in order to end the Time War. It’s such a beautiful piece of television. And any little bit of Paul McGann as the Doctor should be treasured.\n\nAnd with some fancy technology we see young-man Hurt reflected afterwards, which let’s us know just how long he had been fighting in the war and makes it a little clearer why he had enough and could take “no more.”\n\n7 into 8/McCoy into McGann\n\nI think it’s fair to say this is least like the others. There’s no shiny regeneration energy, and there’s a real long gap between his death and regeneration. Which kinda makes sense. An American network was trying to update the effects of the classic series while still honoring it. And kudos to them for actually including McCoy’s Doctor and bridging that gap. But anti-kudos for killing him off in such a stupid way.\n\nThe death also takes awhile. I mean, he’s shot (SO dumb), then taken to the hospital, then dies on the operating table. And technically it wasn’t the gun shot wound that did it, but the way they tried to save him, not knowing about the second heart and all. But everything about the death and regeneration felt really stretched out. We should have skipped to our new Doctor quicker than that.\n\n6 into 7/C. Baker into McCoy (well…sort of)\n\nOh, dear. Well, McCoy did his best. After Colin Baker was fired from being the Doctor, McCoy notoriously began his tenure as Doctor with a curly wig and an obscured face. And we saw it happen mid story it seemed. Like, there was a bunch of action that we had missed out on, but all we needed to know was it killed the Doctor, and now this little Scottish guy who we were pretending wasn’t Scottish was running things.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn’t really one you can go back and retcon into the show, because we did actually see the tail end of the regeneration. However, if you’re a really dedicated 6th Doctor fan and wish he had a better departure story, check Big Finish. I think they may have an audio adventure with his death in it that doesn’t mess with anything televised.\n\n5 into 6/Davison into C. Baker\n\nDavison often complains about how his death scene was upstaged by Peri’s cleavage. Personally, I always remember the scene for 2 other reasons: the spinning heads, which we only ever saw in one other (maybe) regeneration and the way the 6th Doctor’s “you were expecting someone else?” line is delivered in what may be the most clear personality shift between any 2 Doctors, perfectly encapsulating the arrogance we would come to recognize from him.\n\nDavison himself does a good job dying. He got “death by poisoning,” which is a nicely gnarly way to go, lasted the length of an episode, and was also part of a sacrifice-for-companion plot line. Even if the companion was Peri.\n\n4 into 5/T. Baker into Davison\n\nFirst of all, this is some nightmare fodder right here. I’m pretty sure if I had seen this as a kid, I’d be talking about it in therapy.\n\nAfter falling to his (not immediate) death, after a tussle with the Master (slightly dumb, but see, the Master did manage to kill him once), a ghostly white figure passes through Baker and transforms into Davison.\n\nIt’s probably, visually, the most bizarre regeneration scene. And I still don’t 100% understand what was going on (though I only saw it once, under distracting circumstances). But you could argue that for that exact reason it’s a memorable and epic way to say good-bye to one of the most popular and beloved Doctors.\n\n3 into 4/Pertwee into T. Baker\n\nFun fact: this is the first time the Doctor dies from radiation!\n\nThis is a little less memorable one for me, and I don’t have much to say about it. I actually find Pertwee’s first serial, when he clearly still thought he was supposed to play the part like Troughton, to be more interesting. AND we never got a clear transition between them two.\n\nNonetheless, this was the transition into arguably the fan favorite Doctor. He was with the Brig, who was probably in the most episodes with the 3rd Doctor, and Sarah Jane was there, and his last words were to her, so that was very sweet.\n\n2 into 3/Troughton into Pertwee(?)\n\nTroughton is my other favorite Doctor. He possibly has the most puzzling regeneration in that there’s a lot speculation that whatever it was that was happening to him at the end of “The War Games” may not have even been a regeneration. That’s the season 6B theory. I’m not sure whether or not I subscribe to that. There are as many holes in that theory as there are that he was regenerating.\n\nI’m willing to sort of believe that, sure, this was his regeneration. We had the swirly heads when 5 kicked the bucket, and the mugging Troughton was doing did look like the sort of face stretches necessary to morph into Pertwee.\n\n1 into 2/Hartnell into Troughton\n\nIs it the best regeneration sequence? I don’t know. It’s a good one. And maybe the most important sequence in all of Doctor Who. The show isn’t still being made in 2017 if it wasn’t for this regeneration. Hell, the show may not have made it through 1966 if it weren’t for this regeneration. Shockingly, while we don’t have footage of the episode this takes place in (the final part of “The Tenth Planet”), we do have footage of this sequence.\n\nAnd I can’t even imagine what they thought when this happened. Or maybe it was like my experience with 9. But I didn’t have to wait for the next episode.\n\nSomething I really like about this regeneration is that you hear the sound of the TARDIS as it happens, letting you know that something exciting and Time Lord-y is going on.\n\nSo, we’ve done it loads before, and I suspect we’ll do it loads again. But we’ll be sad when Capaldi leaves. As usual. And then there will be a new Doctor to go on adventures with. And we’ll be happy again.\n\nI’d forgotten about the show for bit, but a week ago I watched the original…er…well, it’s categorized as a “TV movie.” It feels more like pilot episode. I think its proper name is Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. I’m talking specifically and exclusively about THAT for this post. I think what happened was the BBC didn’t pick it up for a series, but the American network ABC did, and as a result, that first episode was remade. But I’m talking about the first version. There were just a few little things that struck me that I wanted to get out without getting into just how good the show actually is, and how good all the supporting characters really are.\n\nBut a quick recap: In the not so distant distopian future (as the show always puts it “20 minutes into the future”), a smartass reporter, Edison Carter, works for a TV news station. TV stations essentially control everything, and Carter’s show is pretty popular because he wants to dig up the truth and is willing to go to extreme lengths to get it.\n\nGoing after one particular story, he’s chased by two goons. Trying to escape through a parking garage, he hits his head on a traffic barrier arm that reads “MAX HEADROOM,” the last words he sees before he’s knocked out, and his consciousness is uploaded into a computer Still with me?).\n\nCarter recovers, but now there’s a rogue A.I. avatar that thinks like Carter, has even less of a filter, and no danger of bodily harm. So it just spouts the truth. It ends up in the hands of a pirate TV station and audiences can’t get enough. It could topple the entire system.\n\nAnd the avatar assumes its name is Max Headroom, because they’re the first words it saw.\n\nOkay. So all that at least sounds fun, right? But what about a show from the mid 80’s stood out to me in 2017? The themes and the tech.\n\nThemes\n\nReally a lot of things about the show sound a little familiar. I don’t mean that as a diss. Considering when it was made, it beat out lot of other media playing with the same ideas.\n\nFirst of all, there’s “20 minutes into the future.” The creators clearly thought the ideas they were dealing with, while somewhat fantastical and certainly science fictional, suggested these things were coming up fast.\n\nAnd we have to talk about Max, of course. The idea of TV taking over government, considering certain recent elections in this hellscape we’re calling reality, suddenly doesn’t seem so farfetched. And we seem to be fast approaching a world that looks like any given exterior shot from the show. A sort of post-apocolyptic wasteland decor. You wanted Zombieland? You got it.\n\nBut with the creation of Max it suddenly seems like maybe you can take down TV system with Mr. TV. I mean, Max seems pretty obsessed with uncovering and then telling the truth. Its personality is, after all, a copy of a reporter. And Max isn’t really even the hero of the story, its reporter alter ego, Edison Carter, is.\n\nThere’s something cultural that I thought was interesting about the TV vs. Max and Carter dynamic.\n\nRemember, this was originally a British production, and all the fatcat bureaucrats that ran the TV station were British (but so is most everyone else). The rebellious reporter protagonist and his A.I. mouthpiece were American. This seems to suggests two conflicting lines of thought. Either the creator saw Americans as the noisy semi-crass over-the-top presenter personalities that Max represented, who may present substantive material, but literally don’t exist outside of a monitor, or as the hard working reporters that Edison Carter represented, who gets into a lot of trouble, but usually for the right reasons. Or both. Maybe they don’t have to conflict.\n\nIn any event, I don’t think we need to wait 20 minutes to reach the future, because the future is now. I’d be curious to see this show with an updated look.\n\nWho owns the rights to this now? ABC? Cause it’s ripe for a reboot. What would be better theme music: Video Killed the Radio Star by The Buggles or Big Time by Peter Gabriel? Come On! Let’s make this happen. Or, God, throw it back to the BBC. They’re great at reboots (Doctor Who).\n\nTech\n\nAgain. 1985. This is crazy! No, the computers don’t look like they do now, but think about how they’re used.\n\nThey have typewriter style keyboards (at one point the boy genius, Bryce, is typing, and he’s using just his pointer fingers), but what they use the computers for is pretty impressive. This is really where the other lead, Theora, comes into play. She’s brought on to help Edison remotely (though this doesn’t last long, and she quickly gets caught up in the action as well).\n\nThey’re able to communicate with each other from miles away, her at the TV station, him wherever the story is. She can get him in and out of buildings by giving him codes, allows him to travel to different floors on elevators, and can raise traffic barrier arms in parking garages. Or could, if Bryce hadn’t been counter hacking her work. Oh, yeah, cause there’s a bunch of hacking going down throughout the whole thing.\n\nThen there’s blipverts, ads condensed and fed into a viewers brain at an accelerated speed. These ads have a nasty habit of causing spontaneous combustion in certain viewers. They remind me of those YouTube ads that you can skip after 5 seconds, or banner ads on any website. It’s just chillin’ next to that article you’re trying to read (maybe even this one).\n\nAnd the technology of giving a digital creation a full on personality and artificial intelligence is still out of out reach. But has gotten a hell of a lot closer since 1985. Max seems to be able to think, learn, joke, philosophize, and most certainly speak. Siri can do 3 of those 5.\n\nAvatars weren’t a thing yet either. And Max Headroom wasn’t created digitally. They had to put prosthetic and latex on the actor (Matt Frewer), plus a fiberglass suit and contacts, and then just film him. Because they didn’t have the computer technology to do it any other way. But they didn’t want anyone to know that was the actor, and they did a damn good job. The production team may as well have time traveled to make an avatar so similar to ones we’ve all seen.\n\nThen again, for all this modern tech, Edison is still running around with a bulky 80’s camera that’s half as tall as him and twice as heavy.\n\nI saw Moonlight over a month ago now, and when I didn’t write about right after seeing it, I thought, “well now it would be weird, cause it was so long ago.” But fuck it. I want to talk about Moonlight.\n\nAnd after everything that went down at the Oscars, it has become a historic film for several reasons, but I want to actually look at the actual film itself.\n\nIt’s become a stereotype at this point that it’s one of those movies that you always say “I want to see that” about but never actually do. And I was one of those people. But then one day I dragged myself out of the house, found a theater were it was playing, and saw it. And I’m very glad I did. Because it affected me.\n\nEvery moment of the film is beautifully shot. I’m not always the best judge of the visual aspects of a film (I studied more screenwriting, less production), but even I recognized and respected the precision in the framing and the use of colors, deep muted tones dynamically playing off bright florescent hues.\n\nThe story structure is massively transparent. Act breaks are clearly called out as the film is split into three segments. But this does nothing to detract from the story. Instead, it enforces the changes the protagonist goes through.\n\nThe question “what’s it about?” is a hard one for me to answer. Because I don’t want to give anything away. Because I really new very little about it going in.\n\nBut it’s about 3 specific events in a man’s life, one that happens to him in childhood, one that happens to him in adolescence, and one that happens to him in adulthood, and how they shape him. I guess you could say the movie’s about a question, a chair and a diner.\n\ni. The Question\n\nI absolutely adore silent films (one of my favorite movies is a Harold Lloyd picture from 1927). But I’m also a bit of a dialogue junky, so I can sometimes be put off by a movie that doesn’t have a lot of talking in it. Sometimes. In Moonlight so much is told with so few words spoken. Not that there’s no dialogue in the film. Far from it. But there are long stretches of silence, and the central character, Chiron, doesn’t speak for the first several scenes he’s in.\n\nIt’s a very quiet movie overall really. This adds to the intimate feeling you get while watching it. There are points where you almost feel too close, but Barry Jenkins, Tarell Alvin McCraney, and the brilliant cast are giving you permission. See this, feel this (like the Who song).\n\nThe movie also presents its characters in such a wonderful way, neither heroes nor villains, just people. They do good things and bad things. They’re humans.\n\nMahershala Ali’s character, Juan, is possibly the best example of this. He plays a fairly major role in the first section of the story, though he doesn’t appear after that. He gives Chiron a metaphorical (but very nearly literal) baptism. He takes care of Chiron when his family isn’t able to. And he gives the answer to the question.\n\nJuan’s also a drug dealer, and Chiron’s drug-addicted mother (played brilliantly by Naomie Harris, the only actor to appear in all 3 segments) is furious that he could present himself to her son as such a kind and caring stranger, while simultaneously peddling her the drugs she’s so addicted to.\n\nChiron trusts Juan, but finally confronts him. He actually asks him 3 questions. The first about Juan, whether he sells drugs, and the second two about himself. Chiron wants to know what “faggot” means and if he is one. And it’s the last interaction we see between the two of them. Juan’s responses are the most perfect I’ve heard.\n\nJuan’s girlfriend, Lisa (played by the human equivalent of sunshine, Janelle Monae), appears again in the second section and is mentioned in the third, but Juan appears only in the first segment of the film.\n\nI’d be remiss not to mention that this is also the introduction of Kevin, the first friendship that Chiron has with a child his own age, and a character who he’s irrevocably bonded with, though just how much you don’t even realize until the end.\n\nii. The Chair\n\nChiron, who went by “Little” in the first part, isn’t little in the second. He’s skinny, but tall. And yet his confidence is as small as it ever was. He seems to be constantly wishing himself invisible. Except with Kevin. Kevin and Lisa seem the only people he really has a safe haven with. But as Kevin tells tales of his conquests with girls, Chiron begins to worry he will always be something other.\n\nUntil that scene on the beach. Maybe he’s not alone. Maybe he’s not the only one of his kind.\n\nAnd then the bully who’s been picking on Chiron asks Kevin if he’ll rough up a kid for him. The next time Chiron meets with his bully, Kevin is told to kick the living shit out of Chiron, and Kevin does. And there are all sorts of mixed up feelings.\n\nAnd that’s where I realized the true genius of the movie. I didn’t realize at the time. At the time I was too caught up in the movie, but in reviewing it in my head afterward. Here’s the thing. This movie. It’s not relatable to me. I’m a straight white women and I come with a bundle of privilege. So this movie didn’t make me empathetic. It made me sympathetic. It made me experience and feel things that I haven’t experienced and won’t experience. And it’s SO emotive.\n\nAnd it does a funny thing. Because I think most people who appreciate the movie are probably pretty anti-violence, but when Chiron goes into school the day after Kevin’s betrayal, the day after school faculty urged him to tell them who had hurt him, the day after everything he’d built up was torn down, the viewers are feeling Chiron’s pain, and he just wants to make the bully feel pain.\n\nChiron’s pain was physical, but worse yet was the emotional and psychological damage. He can’t deliver all that, but there is one form of revenge he knows he can deal. And he does it out in the open. In the form of a bludgeoning chair wielder. And it’s a moment of release for the audience as well as Chiron, even knowing the near immediate results of the action.\n\nSo, of course, in the end, it’s Chiron who is taken away, and the shell forming around him is complete. Kevin glimpses Chiron as the cops load him into the police car. Kevin will need to hear the story second hand, try to piece together what happened on his own as he sees Chiron for what, as far as he knows, could be the last time.\n\niii. The Diner\n\nBut they do meet again, and their next meeting is anything but a chance encounter. And I wondered about that. Why not just create a situation where they’re both costumers at a diner and happened to be getting a meal at the same place one night? By chance? I think what the point may have been was that fate wasn’t playing a role in this. It wasn’t luck or destiny. The movie, in many ways, is about the freedom of choice: when you have it, when you don’t, and how you use it.\n\nChiron has completely transformed from the wiry meek adolescent we last saw him as. He now looks big and muscly (and GORGEOUS) and like the sort of guy you don’t want to cross. It’s soon revealed that internally he is still very similar to the boy he was. He’s almost playing off stereotypes of masculinity.\n\nAnd Kevin’s phone call, as off hand as it may have intended to sound, is a loaded invitation. Chiron’s choice in if and how he accepts it will dictate the third event that shapes his life.\n\nEverything about the diner scene is intense. The prickly feeling I had while watching it was akin to a thriller, though the emotions I went through were very different.\n\nEverything from Chiron’s entrance to Kevin’s slow recognition of him to the preparation of the mean to the music playing on the jukebox, even the patronage of the few customers on a slow night at a 50’s style restaurant, all build up a tense feeling. A strong worry. It must have been how Chiron was feeling. Seeing Kevin wouldn’t put him at ease. It would set him on edge.\n\nBut Chiron also seemed free of rage. He never blamed Kevin for the fallout of the middle chapter in his story.\n\nBut that scene plays out so beautifully and feels so true. And the idea of food and music soothing a soul seems very right. They speak quietly. Again, there’s an intimacy to the scene, but the quiet doesn’t mean that there aren’t massive shifts constantly happening. There are hints of confusion, frustration, attraction, disillusionment, and most importantly hope. Hope against hope against hope.\n\nThe rest of that third section seems so brief, a drive in a car, a glimpse of the beach, a conversation in a kitchen, a confession, an embrace, and a hope.\n\nThe ending isn’t exactly happy, but it certainly isn’t sad. It’s hopeful. Even if these two characters choose to go their separate ways, Chiron has been healed. I, for one, think that’s the more honest ending, perfect for a very honest film.\n\nI haven’t been able to get Moonlight out of my head. Especially the diner scene. So there’s no reason not to keep talking about it.\n\nNo, as far as I know Michelle Gomez has dug her heels in and is going nowhere. And I’m really enjoying her performance as Missy (Gomez could play a wall and make it interesting. And probably slightly naughty).\n\nBut with all this talk of a new Doctor I thought it might be fun to fancast his (or maybe even her?) arch-nemesis.\n\nI also included the hypothetical Doctor I’d like to see them pitted against. Just for fun. The order of the Doctors isn’t necessarily my preference. So here are 10 actors that could do the job.\n\n10. Andrew Scott\n\nI know. It feels almost too obvious, doesn’t it? But he does that utterly unhinged, but simultaneously totally fun baddie really well. I think his portrayal would feel a bit like a return to John Simm’s style of Master during the RTD era.\n\nHe’s over the top (to the point of slight camp), dangerous (in an “I’m actually going to kill you now” way), and oddly charming (welp, I’m definitely not gonna stop watching this, might as well make myself a cup of tea and settle in). He has the ability to turn from funny to frightening on a dime, but is always entertaining, and this seems to be a mandatory mix when casting the modern day Masters.\n\nI don’t know if it’s more or less likely that he’d be cast now that Moffat’s leaving the show. Scott is probably on Chibnall’s radar, but Chibnall might also be trying to distance himself from Moffat (at least in the beginning), and I couldn’t fault him for that. Still. Fun to imagine an Andrew Scott Master gumming up the works for his best friend/worst enemy.\n\nThe Doctor: Tim Roth\n\n9. Maisie Williams\n\nOkay, let me explain. I have mixed feelings about Williams’ appearance on Doctor Who so far. But, for me, “The Woman Who Lived” was the stand out episode of series 9. I think I’m the only one. But that’s okay.\n\nTo me, the episode was the one-off adventure story that I had been longing for, and didn’t get bogged down by the “look at Clara! But don’t forget she’s gonna die soon!” effect so much of series 9 seemed to be drilling into. This episode really got to showcase Maisie, whose character herself liked to slip in and out of multiple personas. Also, if you haven’t seen Game of Thrones, take my word for it, she’s the best thing about it.\n\nIt would be great for the Doctor to meet up with who we all believe is Ashildr, only for her to pull the rug out from under all our feet and turn out to be a much darker character. Maisie often pops up as characters that are slightly manic, but also seems to have great control over her performance and shows great power in her moments of stillness.\n\nThe Doctor: Idris Elba (per her suggestion)\n\n8. Aidan Turner\n\nI find it strange that someone who so often plays morally ambiguous characters from various time periods in the past HASN’T been on Doctor Who yet, to be honest. The BBC should really get to work on that.\n\nI’m not one of those people who immediately falls for vampires. If anything, it’s a fairly major hurdle you’d have to jump over for me to like you. And as I expressed in painstaking detail in my I Am Dracula (Spartacus Edition) post, vampires are blood sucking monsters, not romantic heroes. So well done to Aidan Turner, because I adore him, despite being most familiar with him for playing a vampire in Being Human.\n\nHe can play evil, he can play friendly, he can play most anything you’d like him to. He’s comfortable taking “genre” roles, if The Hobbit and Being Human are anything to go by. Also, I think he would create a more grounded characterization for the Master than we’ve seen for a while, which might be a good thing.\n\nThe Doctor: Lenora Crinchlow (’cause apparently I’m still not over it)\n\n7. Katie McGrath\n\nWhen speculation was flying around for who could play the 12th Doctor, I put her on a list of potential candidates, and I still think that she fits the bill, but she’d also be a great choice for the Master.\n\nIn Merlin we got to see her play everything from a kind young woman training to be a Lady to a complete bitch of a queen to a literal wicked witch laying low in the woods. She played each turn in the character to perfection. And you could see her playing the Master in any of those ways. Maybe we want to return to a slightly more composed Master? She’s got you covered. Evil Master in position of power? She can do that too. Nuts? Absolutely.\n\nI think she may be a little busy with Supergirl at the moment, but maybe Doctor Who could borrow her for a few episodes. Also, I don’t think she’s being too terribly typecast yet, so it gives her and the showrunner the chance to try taking the character in a few different directions.\n\nThe Doctor: Hayley Atwell\n\n6. Benedict Cumberbatch\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch should not play the Doctor. I feel very strongly about this, and I realize that saying such a thing is upsetting to a LOT of people, but I’ve felt this way pretty much forever.\n\nI don’t say this because I don’t consider him to be a very good actor, quite the contrary, but I think if you examine his body of work, the type of role he plays becomes quite clear: he plays the asshole. Usually, this takes the form of the villain, but even his Sherlock Holmes is a complete and utter bastard. And I’ve always longed to see him pit that characterization AGAINST the Doctor. I think it would be divine.\n\nBut like Andrew Scott, casting Cumberbatch will surely remind people of Sherlock. Then again, casting the hero of Moffat’s (current?) show as the new villain of the show he’s leaving would be a delicious dollop of good-natured irony. And just generally a good bit of casting.\n\nThe Doctor: Olivia Colman\n\n5. Suranne Jones\n\nDoctor Who fans might recognize Suranne Jones in one of my favorite episodes ever, “The Doctor’s Wife.” She plays Idris, the TARDIS trapped in a human body. And she does so in a wonderfully whimsical and chaotic way.\n\nHer name has been tossed around as a candidate for the Doctor too, but I think she could easily find herself at home in the role of the Master. She’s sharp and can quick-talk as fast as Cumberbatch. Okay, but why does the Master take the same form that the TARDIS did that one time? I don’t know, but it would be cool to find out! Just so long as they can come up with a better reason than why 12 had that face. Or else don’t mention it at all.\n\nShe has held her own both in comedies and dramas and just has a general air of mischief about her, and I think that’s a fun angle to take the Master. The Master isn’t just evil, and I like when we’re reminded that the Doctor and Master actually used to be really good friends. I think Jones would be an excellent candidate for a slightly more friendly Master.\n\nThe Doctor: Richard Ayoade\n\n4. Naomie Harris\n\nBasically I saw Moonlight a few weeks ago and want everyone from that movie to be in everything I watch. I couldn’t figure out why she seemed to familiar to me, and then I was watching an interview, and surprise! She’s British. So I’ve seen her in a bunch of stuff.\n\nShe often plays a somewhere-in-the-middle character, where you’re not sure if she’s a good guy or a bad guy, only that she’s a force and will become a player you can’t ignore, the longer you’re in the game. She can play competent and put together, but she can also play a mess, and what’s a better representation of the Master than someone who started out as competent and put together and became a mess?\n\nWould she do it? I don’t know. She’s becoming pretty high profile, and might not want to turn down any film offers to do T.V. at the moment. But maybe they could work around her schedule if the Master only shows up every so often. I think it would be worth it if they could cast her.\n\nThe Doctor: Keeley Hawes\n\n3. Oscar Isaac\n\nAnother actor that I want to see in everything. He’s played the dashing hero in Star Wars and the evil genius in Ex Machina. He’s capable of playing menacing and creepy, but can pull off cocky banter. And he seems comfortable in the sci-fi genre.\n\nLike a lot of people on this list, he’s probably really busy, but wouldn’t he be this be fun choice?! Even when he plays a good guy, he tends to be a little bit rascally. And while his character in Ex Machina isn’t exactly likeable, he’s at least intriguing. He even gets to show off a villainous dance number. Now where have we seen that before *wink wink, nudge nudge*\n\nAll in all, he’s just a fun performer to watch (so much so that, though Poe Dameron was originally meant to die in Force Awakens, they decided to keep him on), and the Master is a fun character to watch (they’ve killed him off a BUNCH), so I’m all for putting those two things together.\n\nThe Doctor: Helen Mirren\n\n2. Julia Davis\n\nI think I can safely say I’m the first person to suggest Julia Davis play the Master, but I think I’m right on this one. She’s mostly a comedic actress, but if you take a cold hard look at the cast, Doctor Who VERY often recruits funny people. How did I come up with her?\n\nBasically, what happened is there’s this show called Nighty Night that Davis created and starred in, and I watched a few episodes, and MY GOD, you have never seen more of a wicked witch of a character than the one she plays in this show. She’s a complete monster, but it’s a dark comedy, so she also gets to be REALLY funny. And among the cast is Mark Gatiss, who famously currently works as a Doctor Who writer.\n\nDavis has the ability to play a bright character, who is actively plotting your demise, and doesn’t necessarily care whether you know it or not. I don’t know if she might be too similar to Missy to follow her up immediately or a great transition from Missy to whomever might play a future Master, but I’d really love to see what she did in the role.\n\nThe Doctor: Jessica Hynes (because they were sorta kinda comedy partners)\n\n1. James Nesbitt\n\nYeah, pretty much on the merit of Jekyll alone, but he’d be PERFECT. And he’s been #1 on my “Master list” for a long time. I don’t understand why it didn’t happen (especially with Moffat showrunning, but I love Michelle Gomez, so I’ve made my peace with it).\n\nFor anyone who doesn’t know, Jekyll was a miniseries created by Steven Moffat, before he was at the helm of Doctor Who, based on the novel The Strage Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and featured Nesbitt it two roles: mild-mannered Dr. Jackman, and his alter ego, the dangerous Mr. Hyde. The two start to blend into each other, and that’s when Nesbitt is at his most Master-y. Sure, he’ll jump a fence and kill a lion, but he had to protect that kid.\n\nHe’s terrifying. And hilarious. And he makes your skin crawl. And you can’t wait to see what happens next. All at the same time. It takes a special actor to manage all that, but Nesbitt manages it. And the weird thing is, you want him to win. I mean, you’re supposed to want him to win, but it only works with the right actor. And I think we should always be slightly rooting for the Master.\n\nThe Doctor: Retroactively, I’d have loved to see him with Eccleston, but for a new Doctor, let’s see…Gillian Anderson would be interesting.\n\nIt’ll probably have a good long while before we get any sort of new casting news, but I have to admit, as sad as it is to see actors I love leave the show, I enjoy all the fancasting and speculation (as long as it remains respectful), After all, it’s what keeps the show fresh. There are so many new directions they can go, I can’t wait to see what happens next!\n\nThere are quite a few excellent females characters who briefly wound through the Doctor’s story, but for this list the main criteria criteria was really that they could only appear in one story (there’s a couple 2-parter character in here, but other than that they only appear in a single episode. So no Osgood, Missy, Ashildr/Me, Tish Jones, Jackie Tyler, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart, etc.) And there are 11 because, well, I bloody well felt like it, and it’s my list.\n\nAnd after consideration…yeah. I’ll allow historical ladies that actually existed (because there are a couple I just HAD to mention. And, GOD! Can we please have more historical women on the show? Ada Lovelace, Joan of Arc, Amelia Earhart, you could probably do something really cool with Mary Anning, Frida Kahlo, Sally Ride, Sacagawea, Harriet Tubman. Maybe I’ll do a list for that too.\n\n11. Queen Elizabeth X/Liz 10 (The Beast Below) Played by Sophie Okonedo\n\n*SIGH* Okay, yes, she’s in “The Pandorica Opens” too, so I’m slightly breaking my own rule already, but she’s only in it for a second, so I’m squeezing her in at 11.\n\nTo start, this was just a cool idea. What appears to be a masked vigilante is actually the Queen, protecting her citizens from dangers on the street. She’s confident, self-assured, and handy with a weapon, all of which are exhibited in her line “I’m the bloody queen, mate. Basically, I rule.” So she’s down to Earth and talks like a normal person, but she also manages to be elegant and cool at the same time. They should have done more with her in “Pandorica” and maybe beyond.\n\nThat doesn’t mean that her character is perfect. She allows the systematic torture of a rare animal. And then, rather than facing the problem head on, she chooses to be routinely brainwashed. But she can still sense that something’s wrong and is clearly looking out for the good of her people.\n\n10. Joan Redfern (Human Nature/Family of Blood) Played by Jessica Hynes\n\nSo I’m very biased. See, there’s this show called Spaced and Jessica Hynes co-created, co-wrote, and co-starred in it (with Simon Pegg), and I’ll love her forever for it, and she makes it really easy by being really awesome in everything else she stars in. Including Doctor Who. She’s very quietly commanding. And she keeps herself together, despite the fact that her life REALLY starts to suck when the Doctor shows up. Or, rather, when John Smith does. After the Doctor returns to his normal state he even offers to take her with him, but she declines. It would just be too hard for her Martha should have been taking notes. Or maybe she was). And Joan was clearly still on the Doctor’s mind when he visits her descendant in the future just to be sure Joan had a happy life after he left.\n\nMy only quibble is that she doesn’t treat Martha well. She’s constantly reminding Martha that she’s a servant, and clearly just doesn’t like her. But that makes sense. There’s this other woman that seems way familiar with the guy she’s in love with, and, oh yeah, Martha’s in love with him too (when he’s not all human-y wuman-y).\n\nOh, and shout out to the other servant, Jenny, who was a great character until her unfortunate possession.\n\n9. Madame de Pompadour/Reinette Poisson (The Girl in the Fireplace) Played by Sophia Myles\n\nRight, so this is another pseudo love story with 10. I promise the rest of the list isn’t like this. This is interesting, because, aside from evil robots, the story seem to focus more on Reinette (who becomes Madame de Pompadour) than the Doctor, sometimes choosing to leave the story of what’s happening to the Doctor, Rose, and Mickey on the ship, instead focusing on the action happening in France. And it’s a sticky bit of character development, because it creates a sort of love triangle, where the Doctor has been traveling with Rose, and there’s definitely something there (and this is write on the heels of “School Reunion,” which brought up some questions), but he’s prepared to cut himself off from her to save Reinette.\n\nIt’s also one of the few times we see the Doctor jealous. When Reinette introduces her lover as the King of France, the Doctor gives him a condescending look and retorts, “Yeah? Well, I’m the Lord of time.” In the end, the Doctor is running late again and loses her. Oh, and that chemistry? That was real. Tennant and Myles were dating at the time.\n\n8. Queen Nefertiti (Dinosaurs on a Spaceship) Played by Riann Steele\n\nThis is a fun episode. It’s dinosaurs in space. My two favorite things brought together. The only thing that could make it better is if some Egyptian element like Queen Nefertiti were brought into it. Then they pick up Queen Nefertiti for the trip. Brilliant! And they did it without it feeling overstuffed or just tossed in for no reason. She has purpose and added a sense of style to the episode. She shows up Amy just by existing, and also makes Amy up her game. But they aren’t competitive. On the contrary, the female characters get along (which unfortunately doesn’t happen all that often).\n\nThey do a good job of balancing the fact that Nefertiti is both from way in the past with the fact that she’s progressive and forward thinking. She never seems like anything less than a Queen, but works well as part of the Doctor’s team (or, as he puts it, gang). And she’s always working for the greater good of the group, even if it means sacrificing herself.\n\nThat being said she certainly doesn’t take being captured lightly, and when she’s face to face with the evil mastermind, her fury and strength come out. Luckily, she’s one of the kickass women on Doctor Who that gets to live to fight and flirt with Lestrade (or whatever his name is in this show) another day.\n\n7. Adelaide Brooke (The Waters of Mars) Played by Lindsay Duncan\n\nThis episode is one of the most highly regarded, partly because of it’s dark story. And it wouldn’t have worked without Adelaide Brooke. She’s established as cold and strict, greeting the Doctor by pointing a gun at him. Not that it deters him (Jamie held a knife to the Doctor’s throat when they first met, and his ex-best friend, the Master, is always casually trying to murder him, so the Doctor probably thinks this is a perfectly normal way for friendships to form).\n\nIt turns out they do get along, and as the Doctor is traveling solo, she becomes a (very) temporary companion. Or rather he becomes hers. She takes the lead. She’s a little older than companions tend to be too, which I really liked and was important for this episode.\n\nAdelaide is a historical figure, or would be, if you knew her future, and the Doctor is delighted to meet her, before realizing this is the mission that she’s supposed to die on, her death leading to a string of important events. When the point comes that he has to leave her to her fate, he instead rescues her. But Adelaide finds out she was meant to die, inspiring her family to continue her work. She confronts the Doctor, tells him he was wrong to save her. He scoffs at this, so she walks into her house and shoots herself. Because she needed to. For the good of the future.\n\n6. Ida Scott (The Impossible Planet/The Satan Pit) Played by Claire Rushbrook\n\nIda Scott gets forgotten. I forgot her. She’s in two seriously wacky, but, like, dark whacky, episodes. But I rewatched these episodes recently, and what a cool character! She’s the science officer on the doomed Walker Expedition of a planet orbiting a black hole. She’s a good leader in a bad situation. She’s always moving forward, but you can see the pain she has when a member of the crew dies.\n\nNear the end, when she expects she’ll die herself, she is prepared to do so with grace and calm. She’s a space adventurer. What better way could there be for her to go? She only hopes that she won’t have to do it alone, and when she and the Doctor journey to the surface of the planet (yes, SHE’S the member of the crew that goes down), she appreciates it’s majesty, and doesn’t take what she’s seeing for granted.\n\nThis episode has some really wonderful moments. It has my favorite Rose moment, my favorite TARDIS moment, and the exhilarating appearance of the Doctor after it seemed he was surely defeated. But he’s not alone. He has Ida Scott with him, and that makes it all the more wonderful.\n\n5. Jabe (The End of the World) Played by Yasmin Bannerman\n\nThis was the first time I discovered that Doctor Who would kill off characters you liked. Bastards. And while about half the characters on this list meet that same terrible fate, she was the first for me, so it won’t be easily forgotten.\n\nIt was also her making the choice to sacrifice herself to help the Doctor, a heavily recurring theme throughout the series. Others have to face their deaths so he can continue saving people, and he has to face an unending life, losing those people and feeling guilt of it. It was the first time I’d encountered that as well.\n\nShe was also one of the first real alien beings in the new series, and they handled her very suitably and creatively. I mean, they had to make a tree person pre-Guardians the of the Galaxy.\n\nShe gets along VERY well with the Doctor, and it’s interesting to see their interactions, because he’s still pretty fresh off the Time War, and last time he made a friend he asked her to go traveling with him. If it hadn’t been for her death, reminding him what so often happens to people who fall in with him, we may have again wound up with the 5th Doctor’s revolving door policy towards companions (a.k.a. Who are you? Who cares! Come on in). That definitely wasn’t the 9th Doctor’s style.\n\n4. Agatha Christie (The Unicorn and the Wasp) Played by Fenella Woolgar\n\n“The Unicorn and the Wasp” is my favorite episod,e and I’m often taken to task for it, but you needed look much further than the historical figure the episode revolves around. And I’m not a huge Agatha Christie fan (if only because I’ve read precious little of her work), but the way they used her in this episode is so great. It’s just what I want from Doctor Who, creating a reason for a mysterious historical event that we never got answers for.\n\nBonus points for being set at a 1920’s socialite party that I’d give my eye teeth to attend (yeah, I like “Black Orchid” too! Deal with it!).\n\nAgatha Christie acts just like a detective in a mystery novel. Which is lucky because the cast is essentially trapped in a game of Clue (or Cluedo if you’re British). She gets just as much to do as companion Donna (who is ON POINT in this episode). She’s sniffing out clues left and right, questioning suspects, and driving after baddies, even when it means she gets into a dangerous car accident.\n\nChristie has taken a hard hit after recently being left by her husband, but she seems confident and self-assured, though she is clearly hiding a hurt, and it seems to bring out a certain amount of determination. She has the emotional depth and entertaining spirit that creates such vivid Doctor Who characters.\n\n3. Rita (The God Complex) Played by Amara Karan\n\nOne of the first things that always strikes me about Rita is that she dies. WHYYYYYYYYY?!\n\nRita’s definitely one of those “what could have been” companions. The Doctor is clearly saving her in his memory banks as soon as they meet. You can tell he’s thinking, “oh, she’d be good. She’d be very good” (and basically says as much). He even jokes that he’s firing Amy as his companion in order to take on Rita (or is he joking?). She’s competent, clever, and proactive. She even has medical experience.\n\nAnd she’s so well rounded for appearing so brief a time. We know a bit about her family based on it being the thing she fears (and what’s in her nightmare room) and how it’s impacted her since.\n\nBut I think her death was actually very important. There’s a whole mess of stuff that’s actually happening in that episode, and I think Rita’s fate is part of the reason for the Doctor dropping off Amy and Rory at the end. He wants them to have a happy ending after seeing a “what could have been” companion reaching her inevitable end. This is what happens to people who travel with the Doctor. And it’s a shame she didn’t get to have a few adventures in the TARDIS. I’ve gotta agree with the Doctor on this one: Rita? She’d be good. She’d be very good.\n\n2. Sally Sparrow (Blink) Played by Carey Mulligan\n\nWell. Duh. You can’t have a list like this without mentioning Sally Sparrow. It’s tempting to say she IS a companion. Just one that never traveled with the Doctor, and only barely met him. She certainly acts like one. She goes adventuring without too much hesitation, wandering off and doing, quite frankly, some very dumb things, while still clearly being incredibly bright.\n\nIn a way, she’s like the Doctor too, having companions of her own (the first two of who she loses, much like the Doctor): Kathy, then Billy, then Larry. It’s funny that with all this time travel affecting her and being the motivation for most everything she does, Sally is the one person who never actually travels in time. And while she’s briefly inside the TARDIS, she doesn’t actually get to take a trip in it.\n\nSally does occasionally lose her cool, but it’s always under appropriate circumstances, as things move from mysterious to unnerving to perilous. And she has a better handle on time travel and the crossing of multiple timelines in a non-linear, non-subjective, big ball of wibbly-wobbly timey-wimey way than most companions.\n\nPart of what makes this story so creepy is that it’s what happens when the Doctor doesn’t show up. Because he can’t always be there. So we have people like Sally Sparrow instead, who find themselves in incredible situations, and just by doing what is right manage to save a little piece of the world. Even without a TARDIS.\n\n1. Idris/Sexy/the TARDIS (The Doctor’s Wife) Played by Suranne Jones\n\nSpeaking of the TARDIS…\n\nOkay, well, this is probably cheating. In a way Idris has been in EVERY episode of Doctor Who. The idea of the TARDIS being a living thing has been batted about for ages, but when you ask Neil Gaiman to write an episode, he’ll kick the show’s weird and whimsy up a notch and probably do something like put the TARDIS’ living consciousness into a human body. Because he did. And we owe Suranne Jones a huge debt of gratitude, because Idris is, to me, the greatest temporary female ever to appear on the show.\n\nAnd she easily could have been a MPDG, if written and performed by less deft artists, but no. Idris is basically magic, or as close to magic as Doctor Who does, and yet she’s OFF. Completely inhuman. You can tell just by looking at her. And she bites, and she answers your questions before you ask them, and she doesn’t quite listen to what you tell her, and she’s not going to follow your instructions if you don’t follow hers.\n\nAnd part of the beauty of that character is that she’s fleeting. She can’t last like that, and as she and the Doctor begin to realize it, the story becomes twice as poignant. They can’t have their cake and eat it to. And neither can we. As much as I love Idris, having her make a return would be a terrible idea. The whole point of her, is her expiration date. Of course, she isn’t really gone, she’s just returned to her original form. That’s how the Doctor really needs her. How we all do. She just wanted the chance to tell the Doctor “hello.”\n\nI grew up on movie musicals. You might not think it to look at the other posts on this blog, but they were a big part of my life. The love went deeper than that. My family had a background in musical theater, and in my youth I joined a junior theater company where I could be in musicals myself.\n\nSo I at least kinda know about what I’m talking about.\n\nI’m not a great singer or a great dancer, but I witnessed people who were. They were awe-inspiring. You couldn’t take your eyes off them. I was an admirer of performers like Gene Kelly, Judy Garland, Julie Andrews, Bob Fosse, Fred Astaire, and Ginger Rogers in my childhood (the last one famous for doing everything Astaire did, but “backwards and in high heels”). That’s why we go to the movies.\n\nI was wary when I first heard about La La Land. On the one hand, a well-done throwback movie musical in 2016/2017 could be fun and exciting, sheer escapism at a much needed time. On the other hand, what if it didn’t work…\n\nWhen I saw the first trailer, I was more nervous. I like Ryan Gosling. I like Emma Stone. I liked them playing opposite each other in Crazy, Stupid Love. But…for a throwback to Hollywood musicals? I’d have thought you’d want some real powerhouse singers and dancers. And the visuals themselves…dancing in a field of stars sounds very romantic and all, but I didn’t really feel anything emotionally when I saw trailers and promos.\n\nI thought, to be fair, maybe they’re holding back, they don’t want to spoil all the good stuff before the audience is in the theater. I can respect that. And maybe context would make all those moments magical after all. So I saw the movie.\n\nNope.\n\nLet me break down why the movie didn’t work:\n\nCasting and Characters\n\nAgain, I like Gosling and Stone, they are utterly charming, but I think for the leads in a throwback movie musical, it may have behooved the film to cast musical theater actors. People who could sing, dance, AND act. There are many of them looking for work. I mean, that’s what the movie’s ABOUT. You could have had some life imitating art by casting some unknowns.\n\nAnd if you really felt you NEEDED big names, well, there are other actors who can really bring musical talent to a film. And if that had been the case, the musical numbers could have been more frequent and more ambitious (but more on that later).\n\nAnd, hey, a jazz pianist might have been a nice opportunity to cast a black actor. Especially considering that every jazz artists referenced and featured is black. But no. Instead you’ve got some white guy parading around like he’s gonna be the savior of jazz.\n\nAnother thing that was missing from the classic musical set-up was a cast of characters. There were two leads and everyone else was peripheral. We didn’t even have the “best friend” or the “villain.” It might have been fun if they had taken the roommates that Mia’s character had in the beginning and fleshed them out, given them more to do.\n\nOr take J.K. Simmons character and make him a recurring adversary with a bad guy song. The fact that J.K. Simmons was cast in a musical and never sang is a criminal offense anyway. Hell, even his guest spot in an episode of the Thrilling Adventure Hour featured a showstopping number and multiple reprises. You have NO excuse La La Land!\n\nOR make Gosling and Stone supporting characters, they do less singing and dancing, but are still featured. You could have done any of these things.\n\nMusic\n\nI want to be fair to the music. Cause it was good. I caught myself smiling at the reoccurring melodies at a couple of point. It was nice.\n\nBUT\n\nIt could have been more. It should have been more.\n\nAside from the fact that there were only a few original songs that were just used over and over (I’m looking at you, “City of Stars”), I found them forgettable. To contrast, after I saw Sing Street, which granted is a very different type of musical with a very different style of music, I downloaded several of their original songs as soon as I got home, I woke up the next morning with “The Riddle of the Model” stuck in my head, and found myself humming “Drive It Like you Stole It” later in the day.\n\nWith La La Land, try as I might, I can’t recall any music from it without seeking it out to remind myself. All great musicals should worm their way into your brain, you should find yourself humming the music as you go through your day. I haven’t. I’ve actually actively TRIED, and I can’t.\n\nThis leads me back to that first point again. Maybe the music could have been more sophisticated (and there could have been more of it) if there were more accomplished singers in the lead roles. I mean, Gosling can sing, though I’d never think of him as a singer, and Stone…well, it wasn’t grating or anything, but I really wondered what she was doing as the star of a musical whenever she started to sing.\n\nDance\n\nAgain, I want to be fair. The dancing was not a wash across the board. That opening scene is a lot of fun, and they definitely found their singer/dancers for that. The image of them all standing on top of their cars in rush hour traffic is probably the reason Damien Chazelle wanted to make the movie in the first place.\n\nThis number also exhibited another thing musicals should do: something new, whether it’s leaping across the ceiling or tap dancing in roller skates, it’s a new way to set the stage. You have to give this scene credit.\n\nThe tap dance between the two leads as they walk to their cars was cute too. And I actually found myself giddy with anticipation when Mia sat down to change her shoes in that scene (“she’s puttin’ on tap shoes!”), and she and her roommates dancing down the street, leading into the wild Hollywood party had that classic musical feel.\n\nBUT\n\nAcross the board I wanted more. A showstopper: men in tails dancing down a grand staircase, an “audition” with singers and dancers. All That Jazz (the movie, not the song from Chicago) is an example of a musical with a lead who’s not a dancer, but makes you forget that because there’s SO much dancing whenever he’s around.\n\nI think part of the problem in La La Land was a fear of the chorus “showing up” the leads, but you can absolutely make that work. And it was exactly the model for All That Jazz.\n\nChicago (since All That Jazz is making you all think of it anyway) sort of did this as well by casting Renee Zellweger as the lead, but then supporting her with Catherine Zeta-Jones, the latter of who is a dancer, and fronts most of the big numbers.\n\nI wanted Mia’s roommates to have their own number, a choreographed dance breaking out at the stuffy club where Sebastian was playing Christmas songs, a Fosse send up at the jazz club! PLEASE! Instead a lot of the dancing was delegated to the same two damn people all movie long, and because they aren’t dancers, it resulted in a lot of serviceable waltzing. As I said at the beginning, I watch movie musical to be in awe of the performers, not to think “…yeah…I could probably do that with a couple weeks of training.”\n\nBad Timing\n\nTo touch back on that, take-a-chance, cast-some-singer/dancers thing: In the early 50’s MGM cast a 19 year old actress with only a few credits to her name as the lead in their upcoming production. The production was Singin’ in the Rain. The 19 year old was Debbie Reynolds.\n\nIt was a bit like a kick in the gut, a mere weeks after her death to see La La Land, after it had been tauted as a throwback to classic movie musicals to see such mediocre dancing, and watch awards get launched at an average film that does little to uphold the the style and craftsmanship that you see in classic movie musicals.\n\nAnd maybe it’s just me, but that movie I mentioned earlier, Sing Street, is far batter and also a musical, but not a classic movie musical with big dance numbers in it (and has one anyway) because it’s about an 80’s New Wave band. It sucks it came out this year, because La La Land is gonna sweep the floor with it at the Oscars (they already did at the Globes). I’m mad at the situation, but that sucks.\n\nThey Didn’t “Earn” It\n\nLa La Land just wasn’t ready to be made. Chazelle needed to take a step back and really decide what movie he was trying to make. Is it a musical that’s authentically joyful, or is it a cynical commentary of the hypocrisy of L.A.? It can’t be both. Unless he’s gaslighting us.\n\nThe characterization should have been stronger, and there should have been more characters! The music should have been given more time, the choreography CERTAINLY needed work. You hear stories about classic Hollywood dancers dancing until their feet bled or they made themselves physically ill. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that those are the films we remember. Those are the films that last. In comparison La La Land comes across as half-baked mediocrity. I’m not saying you have to hurt yourself to make a good movie, but there’s a dedication those actors had, because this was their craft. They’d been working at it their whole lives.\n\nPart of what frustrates me is it will make a killing at the box office and continue to clean up throughout awards season. We continue to award average filmmaking. This film inspires me in no way. Points me in no direction. What was the message even supposed to be? Do the filmmakers know? This is what will actually kill the movie musical. Lowering expectations and achievements.\n\nI get that making a film is hard, boy, do I get it. I get that making a musical is challenging, but just because both things happened doesn’t mean it’s automatically brilliant. We don’t reward movies simply because they get made. We reward movies that are outstanding in their field. This movie stands out to me in no way other than my frustration whenever I see it’s up for more awards. “That thing? I had almost succeeded in forgetting about it.”\n\nI’ll grit my teeth through the Oscars this year and roll my eyes as it’s name is repeatedly called. And please stop pretending to be surprised when you win. We don’t believe you. You made this movie to win awards. It worked. Congrats. I’m gonna go watch Shall We Dance to keep from screaming.\n\nWinter is here. But it hasn’t brought White Walkers. It’s brought holiday joy and merriment. Bah. Humbug. What if you want to watch a movie that reflects the cold world, and you don’t want to watch a holiday movie? Well, there are some alternatives. After you’ve watched all the mandatory holiday classics like Die Hard and Trading Places, you’ve got these movies to keep you warm on a cold night.\n\n1. The Hateful Eight\n\nI mean, the reason they’re all trapped out there together is that they’re snowed in by a ferocious blizzard. And Hateful Eight was nominated for an Oscar in cinematography, cause they made that snow look good. You can’t help, but feel lucky that you aren’t as miserably cold as the 8 psychopaths in the film (and O.B. Poor O.B.). And that you don’t have to literally nail the door closed behind you every time you walk inside.\n\nThe only whisper of Christmas in the whole move is when Bob sits down at the piano to play an instrumental rendition of “Silent Night.”\n\n2. Hugo\n\nThis movie is Christmas/holiday magic incarnate without Christmas actually making an appearance. Happy, heartbreaking, and hopeful. Every reason that those hairs on the back of your neck would stand up are accounted for. Also a really good pick for movie fanatics and ex-film students. It’s based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, but is really about movie magic (which is a very real thing).\n\nIt’s nice to watch while all bundled up and wishing you could lend Hugo a blanket (and maybe a ladder) while he’s out recreating Safety Last on a clock face high above Paris.\n\n3. The Shining\n\nI bet some of you jumped the gun and watched this before Halloween, didn’t you? Tsk tsk. Far as I’m concerned, The Shining is a dark comedy masquerading as a horror movie.\n\nThe movie is basically just about a family who spends the holidays in a probably haunted hotel and get royally screwed when the dad goes a little stir crazy and is maybe the reincarnation of a former murder, or is possessed by such a person, or has some weird ghost illness thing, and his son maybe has some sort of superpowers. It’s a little unclear, but it’s a lot of fun, and in the end, the only way to stop the evil is to lead it outside and try to lose it in the snow. So…winter movie.\n\n4. Misery\n\nAGAIN. You probably skipped ahead and watched this too early. I will concede, this is a horror movie, though there are comedic elements.\n\nIt’s a great premise for anyone spending the night in. There are basically only two characters in the whole film. A writer who was in a terrible accident and can’t move around freely and his adoring fan who quickly twists into a psychotic warden, who keeps him handicapped. He can’t escape because a) inability to do much walking and b) fucking snow. The latter one is the thing tying most of these movies together.\n\nIt will definitely have you giving the side eye to people you’d usually find very pleasant and leave you wondering who the hell names a character Misery.\n\n5. Fargo\n\nThis one’s a nice mix of delightful and gruesome (two things I love). All about money and crime and justice, but set with a winter wonderland backdrop. It does a good job of establishing just how isolated people are, as well as allowing them to be tracked. Sure, the holidays are happening, but the characters all have bigger fish to fry and any Christmas activity winds up as background static.\n\nThe characters are all odd and intriguing. Some likeable, some not. How they react when the chips are down can be unexpected.\n\nSpeaking of chips…that wood chipper scene.\n\n6. Hanna\n\nHanna is slightly fringier than most of the other films on this list. But it was made by a bunch of very capable filmmakers. It’s an interesting film about a young girl who has been trained to be an assassin. It’s quieter than some action/thriller movies. Not boring, just quieter. I guess that’s the thing about assassins. They don’t want to make to much of a fuss. And like in Fargo, the snowy backdrop works both to illustrate the isolation of the character as well as prove useful for tracking.\n\nIt’s definitely work checking out. Plenty of winter fun without a lot of holiday fuss. Slightly more on the artsy side. But, you know, in a fun bloody way.\n\n7. Submarine\n\nI’ve talked about this movie before. Really you should just go read my post on Richard Ayoade’s directing if you’re interested in this one.\n\nWe’re moving away from Christmas and into New Year’s. This film was released (at least, in the U.S.) during the summer. And as such, paired with so much of it taking place near the ocean, I used to think of it as a summer movie. But in actuality, the penultimate scenes take place on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. Heartbreaking and utterly charming. And, judging by the gear those kids are trekking around in, freezing.\n\n8. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\n\nThis movie begins (and therefore ends) a few days into the new year. So it’s a good one to end your winter viewing (there are plenty of fun spring movies to move on to).\n\nThough the nature of the movie takes you through many different seasons, much of the movie is cold and dreary and muddles together. And the most iconic moments are probably Joel and Clementine lying side by side on the ice, and them lying in the bed on the beach in the snow. I’ve talked about this movie before too, in the Independent Dramadies post. It’s a really interesting and unique movie. And good. And sad. And happy.\n\nI will.\n\nIn a world (yes, I’m honestly starting this way) where gritty comic book heroes and gory violence have taken the mainstream media by storm, one comic book dares to defy the odds and be utterly pleasant in every fucking issue. OhmigodthankyouIloveyousomuch!\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I take zero offense with gritty comic book heroes and gory violence in mainstream media. It totally gets to carve out its place. And comic book fans had to wait a good long while before they weren’t sidelined, mocked, and left out of mainstream media. And just look at the programming we’re getting! Television with production values as good as film, expansive and exciting universes, and groundbreaking entertainment. It’s glorious!\n\nIt’s also really intense. And the fate of the world rests in so and so’s hands, and they can only save the such and such with the McGuffin device, and I need a friggin’ break. I want to feel good about the world. Who wants to throw me a lifeline?\n\nAh, that’ll do it. Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur as created by Brandon Montclare and Amy Reeder. And again, don’t get me wrong, there are a lot of real cute comics too (yes, I did read the first trade of The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl, I did love it). But there’s a freshness and an innocence to Moon Girl that makes me a unique kind of happy. Like, “Julie Andrews twirling around like a mental patient on a mountaintop kind of happy” (totally nicked that from The Sixth Sense). It does get talked about, unlike my title would suggest, just not as much as it should.\n\nAnd, yes, it ties in with the Avengers universe (it’s Marvel, it kinda has to), and yes, the protagonist is chasing a McGuffin through New York City. But here’s why it works:\n\nLunella Lafayette A.K.A. Moon Girl\n\nMoon Girl’s actual name is Lunella Lafayette. She’s a precocious 4th grade African-American girl. She’s human, she doesn’t have any super powers, and she doesn’t have a ton of money. What she does have is curiosity, creativity, intelligence (she was officially named the smartest character in the Marvel universe), resourcefulness, and a prehistoric dinosaur in her backyard.\n\nBut I’m, getting ahead of myself.\n\nSo she doesn’t have aliens abilities, nor has she been bitten by a radioactive spider/fallen in a vat of toxic waste/undergone a risky scientific procedure. She doesn’t let that stop her. And she doesn’t have incalculable wealth. Her inventions look homemade with wires poking out, and they don’t always work quite the way she meant them to, but she figured out a way to make them, nonetheless. And again, she’s a child. I thing we can cut her a little slack. Plus, her reaction to finding a T-Rex is not, “oh, how horrifying,” but, “well, this is unusual. It must be frustrating for him. Maybe he can help me out, and maybe I can do the same for him.” She’s awesome.\n\nDevil Dinosaur\n\nSo I didn’t know about Dinosaur World when I started Moon Girl. Good news: you don’t need to. As a matter of fact, the story starts, rather tragically, with the death of Devil Dinosaur’s original partner in crime, Moon-Boy.\n\nSee, Moon-Boy is a cave-person type, and he’s mortal enemies with these other cave-people types and they kill, and as Moon-Boy is dying, he asks Devil Dinosaur to retrieve this Nightstone thing they have, but then a time vortex happens and sucks the bad cave-people and Devil Dinosaur into present day New York. As you do.\n\nAnd a T-Rex running loose in NYC is everything you’d expect. He’s ferocious, menacing, and destructive. But he’s also still loyal to the dead Moon-Boy, so Lunella shows up, and they work together to get the Nightstone back, and Devil Dinosaur turns out to be very sweet and protective. And he better be considering how much he’s going to cost New York in damages.\n\nThey back a lot of emotion into those tiny eyes and a lot of heart in that giant body.\n\nIt Takes Place in the Prime Marvel Universe\n\nI’m not incredibly well-versed in any comic book universe, but even I recognize and appreciate the Marvel tie-ins. Whether it’s a brief mention of the Kree or Devil Dinosaur having a run-in with the Hulk, there’s are little Marvel nuggets throughout.\n\nNot to mention, as I already have, Moon-Boy, Devil Dinosaur, the Nightstone, the Dinosaur World universe and the Killer-folk (those are the evil cave-people).\n\nIt Works Completely Well on Its Own\n\nOn the other hand, if your anything like me, keeping track of several alternate universes starts to get tricky. No problem!\n\nI admit, I’m not completely caught up, and I’m missing an issue in the middle. I just can’t make it out to my comic book store every week. This is why I usually wait for the trade paperbacks. I just couldn’t wait for this one. And if I was trying to buy issues of other comics, as well? I’d probably drive myself even more crazy than I already am. I mean, I’ll track them all down eventually. I’ve seen every episode of Doctor Who ever (even the reconstructions), I just need to find the time and resources. But it’s nice that I can focus on Moon Girl and Devil Dinosaur as a self-contained story.\n\nWho Isn’t This For?!\n\nI read a really obnoxious blog post saying they couldn’t figure out who this comic was targeting. But I see this as being appealing to a lot of people. Like dinosaurs? Got you covered. Like cool gadgets? Got you covered. Looking for time travel? Check. Need to expand the Marvel universe? Done. Looking for a lead character who’s female and/or a minority? Here you go. And just because it’s appropriate for younger audiences DOES NOT MEAN adults can’t enjoy it as well. I wish I had been so lucky to have this comic as a kid, and child-me is screaming with joy. But you know what? So is adult me. I’d like to invite that article to trip and fall into that vortex Lunella opened up.\n\nWriting and Artwork\n\nThe audacity of lumping these two things together. I know. But I just wanted to say very briefly: so fun, absolutely adorable, and completely life affirming. Amy Reeder referred to it as “the ultimate buddy comic,” and she’s right. It very much follows the “boy and his dog” format, but with a unique spin on it. A girl and her dinosaur. Honestly, what could be better than that?\n\nP.S. If you guys at Marvel need a writer for any film/TV plans, I’m, like, super interested."
