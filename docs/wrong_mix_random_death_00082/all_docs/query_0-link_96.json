        "text": "By\n\nJosegslimc\n\nO'fteill\n\nnew. 1\n\nSHOWS\n\nFOLLOW THE FLEET: What J\n\nA Dancing Star! <\n\nFred Astaire's unique personality\n\ndominates the whole of the film. The 4\n\nstar has a role which is character <\n\ncomedy — rather than the lead in a <\n\n; musical show. His oDening num- <\n\nber, \"We Saw the Sea,\" is a gem of <\n\nhumor and skill. <\n\nBased on a story that could stand '\n\n. without music, \"Follow the Fleet\" fol- )\n\nlows the fortunes of four young J\n\n' people — during the time that the\n\nnavy is in port. As a sailor with a \\\n\ngenius for enraging Ginger Rogers <\n\nand for dancing, Astaire is a sheer <\n\njoy. <\n\nFor Astaire alone Irving Berlin <\n\nwrote \"I'd Rather Lead a Band.\" This <\n\nsplendid novelty routine eclipses the <\n\n\"Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails\" <\n\nnumber. For Fred and Ginger arrive. <\n\n\"All My Eggs in One Basket,\" with\n\nits clever foolery, and \"Let's Face !\n\nthe Music and Dance,\" the haunting ,\n\nclimax to a grand show. <\n\nHarriet Hilliard, an appealing new- <\n\ncomer reminiscent of Frances Lang- <\n\nford, and Randolph Scott, thawed by <\n\nAstaire's influence to amusing confi- <\n\ndence, accompany the pair through <\n\nthe story. '\n\nR.K.O.-Radio, while mindful of the ,\n\ndown-to-earth plot, have contrived to ,\n\ngive \"Follow the Fleet\" the novel pro- ,\n\nduction which Astaire demands. To ,\n\nanalyse Astaire's charm as a dancer 1\n\nand a comedian would be superfluous 1\n\nat this stage. One can only say that 1\n\nhe has never been more brilliant. 1\n\nOthers in the cast: Astrid Allwyn, Ray 1\n\nMayer. Harry Bercsford, Addison Randal,\n\nRussell Hicks. R.K.O.-Radio Picture. At\n\nthe State.\n\nKING OF BURLESQUE: Not\n\na dull act in show.\n\nThe plot of this musical may have a\n\n- familiar ring — but that does not mat\n\nter. Its dances, ensembles, and comedy\n\nare its important features. In all\n\nthese variety numbers there is not\n\none dull act. And so, helped by skilled\n\n1 direction. \"King of Burlesaue\" nrp-\n\nsents richly enjoyable fare for a pub\n\nlic in search of entertainment.\n\nOne of the spectacles succeeds in\n\nbringing novelty to the musical screen.\n\nIt is the trapeze ballet, performing\n\nnovel evolutions above the audience\n\nin the fllm.\n\nWarner Baxter's title role forces him\n\nto fall in love with Mona Barrie — an\n\nunpleasant aristocrat. When Mona\n\nand the Broadway show-business fail\n\nBaxter, Alice Faye steps in to rescue\n\nhim. Under the circumstances, Baxter\n\ndoes as well as any actor could do.\n\nEach member of the supporting\n\ncompany gives a good account of him\n\nself — and Jack Oakie, who extracts\n\nevery ounce of comedy from his part,\n\nranks with the three principals.\n\nOthers in the cast: Arline Judge, Gregory\n\nRatoiT, Dixie Dunbar, Fats Waller, Nick\n\nLong, jr. Fox picture. At the Capitol.\n\nTHE PERFECT GENTLEMAN :\n\nWith an Imperfect Lady\n\nElaborately groomed and polished,\n\nCicely Courtneidge makes her first\n\nAmerican film. It is obviously her\n\nlast. Out of its proper setting, the\n\nEnglish comedian's humor has an old-\n\nfashioned tang. Only in the story's\n\nserious moments does Cicely register\n\ncharm.\n\nWith deference to its visiting star,\n\nM.G.M. presents a sentimental comedy\n\nby Cosmo Hamilton. Frank Morgan,\n\nas one of that author's ripe old Army\n\nmajors, walks away with the fllm. His\n\nperformance, for heart - warming\n\nlaughter and pathos, ranks among his\n\nbest.\n\nIn a painstakingly accurate English\n\natmosphere, Cicely appears as a\n\nmusic-hall star, and Morgan by a\n\nseries of whimsical happenings be\n\ncomes her partner. A great shock to\n\nthe clergy and county. Henry Stephen\n\nson, as the bishop, is the best of the\n\nsupporting cast.\n\nOthers In the cast: Herbert Mundin,\n\nHeather Angel, Una O'Connor, Richard War\n\ning, Forrester Harvey, Mary Forbes, Doris\n\nLloyd. M.G.M. picture. At the St. James.\n\n'LOVE BEFORE BREAKFAST:\n\nServes laughter cocktail.\n\nHere is an exhilarating piece of\n\nentertainment. Modern, saucy, and\n\noccasionally boisterous, it allows\n\nCarole Lombard, as in \"20th Cen\n\ntury,\" to be a grand comedian. She\n\nplays a minx to the hilt.\n\nWalter Lang, the director, revels in\n\nthe sophisticated absurdity of his\n\nplot. With just the tang for modem\n\npalates, the romance between Carole\n\nand Preston Foster is a series of sur\n\nprise situations. To detail them\n\nwould spoil the laughter. Here is a\n\nfilm not to be dissected, but to be\n\nthoroughly enjoyed.\n\nJanet Beecher, in the role of\n\nCarole's quizzical mother, contributes\n\nan excellent piece of dry humor. Cesar\n\nRomero, as Carole's unfortunate\n\nfiance, shows that he can look fool\n\nish and be entertaining.\n\n\"Love Before Breakfast\" has two\n\nsurprises — Preston Foster's engaging\n\nease in a worldly role; and the glit\n\ntering polish, unusual to this studio,\n\nof the whole production.\n\nOthers in the cast: Betty Lawford,\n\nRichard Carle, Douglas Blackley, Don Briggs,\n\nAndre Beranger, Ed Barton. Universal pic\n\nture. At the Plaza.\n\nucaiKc: t-,omeay casrie in\n\nSpain.\n\nIt has become a cliche to talk\n\nabout the \"Lubitsch touch.\" But since\n\nthis producer's delicately impertinent\n\nwit enlivens the whole of \"Desire,\" it\n\nmust be given full credit again.\n\nMarlene Dietrich has become\n\nhuman. There are still traces of the\n\nslow photographic poses which\n\nmarked her work for Von Sternberg.\n\nBut as the film progresses Marlene's\n\nappearance becomes simpler and more\n\nlovely. The star reveals the comedy\n\nskill which made her a Continental\n\nstar.\n\nShe is certainly a lovely creature,\n\nmost amusing in the famous dinner-\n\ntable scene. It is not her fault, but\n\nrather Gary Cooper's merit, that as\n\nan entertainer, and a light comedian,\n\nhe takes the picture. An irresistible\n\nperformance.\n\nJohn Halliday makes the third in a\n\nromantic comedy — spiced with sus\n\npense. For Marlene is a jewel thief,\n\nfleeing from Paris to Spain; Cooper\n\nis the gauche young American who\n\nblunders into Halliday's plans.\n\nSuavely presented, \"Desire\" is\n\ncharming entertainment.\n\nOthers in the cast: Alan Mowbray. Akim\n\nTamlroff, William Frawley, Ernest Cossat.\n\nEflic Tilbury. Paramount picture. At the\n\nPrince Edward.\n\n\"A NIGHT AT THE OPERA\":\n\nFull Marx for Comedy.\n\nM.-G.-M. has altered its motto for\n\nthis film. \"Marx Gratia Marxes\"\n\nappears round Leo's head. Appro\n\npriate enough; since the three bro- J\n\nthers take complete charge of the f\n\nscreen. '\n\nAll those who relish the wild Marx\n\nbrand of comedy will find this their\n\nbest fllm. Their eccentric adven\n\ntures from Milan to New York con\n\ntain such notable scenes as that in\n\nGroucho's cabin; the impersonation )\n\nof the foreign aviators; the disrup-\n\ntion of the opera orchestra; and the\n\nfinal, breathless sequences, in which\n\nthey take charge of \"H Trovatore\" as\n\nwell. Here is clever material for\n\nnnnnlnv ltmrrVifc»v\n\nIntermingled with their original\n\nantics are some really fine playing by\n\nHarpo and Groucho — a feature sadly\n\nmissed in their last picture. Hie\n\ndirection and presentation of tflie\n\nwhole insane adventure is skilfully\n\nkeyed to the Marx personalities.\n\nThat charming actress, Kitty Car\n\nlisle, and Allan Jones, newcomer\n\nwith attraction and a fine voice, con\n\ntrive to sing and be romantic in ithe\n\nmiddle of all the uproar.\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nnone Help\n\nFILM VARIETY. \"Desire\" (top, left) ; \"King of Burlesque\" and \"A Night at the Opera\" (top, right) ; \"Strike Me Pink\" (be low, left), and \"Follow the Fleet.\" Help"
