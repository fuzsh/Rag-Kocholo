        "text": "Are you in the cooler Northern Hemisphere or basking in the sun in the Southern Hemisphere? Either way, why not pause and give yourself the gift of time to rest and relax, maybe read a new book.\n\nIt’s a pleasure to welcome author Nancy Cunningham to talk about her new book Crossing the Bridge.\n\nThank you for joining us- tell us about your book Crossing the Bridge which will be released 1st January 2024. You can pre-order it NOW\n\n1944. Widow Poppy Guilford is fighting to save her farm, the one thing tethering her to her husband—and the legacy promised for their young son. But a devastating secret from her husband’s past threatens to derail her struggle to save the property and keep her son by her side.\n\nFormer soldier JB Beaton’s wartime injuries and personal losses have left him with scars, both inside and out. Believing he’s too damaged to be the father his son deserves, he leaves him with his sister and takes on a job as a farmhand, far away from the city and his failures.\n\nPoppy, battling the elements and the heartache caused by her husband’s secret, finds the new farmhand is never far from her thoughts, and JB’s world is thrown into disarray by one of the most beautiful and capable women he has ever met. Neither can fight the surge of attraction they both feel.\n\nIn a small town where gossip reigns, will they surrender to duty or follow their hearts?\n\n‘You’ll be cheering for this wartime Australian heroine well before the last page as she fights to find her voice, her feet and love after heartbreak. Nancy Cunningham’s emotional debut novel is a cracker.’ —Bestselling Australian author Victoria Purman.\n\n‘Crossing the Bridge’ is available as an eBook through the Harper Collins/Escape website and all good online stores: https://www.amazon.com.au/s?k=9781867299738&camp=247…\n\nhttps://play.google.com/store/search?q=9781867299738&#8230;\n\nhttps://books.apple.com/…/crossing-the-bridge/id6458265282\n\nhttps://www.kobo.com/au/en/ebook/crossing-the-bridge-9\n\nAn early Christmas present for yourself or someone you know perhaps?\n\nI was fortunate enough to receive an Advance Reader Copy through Net Galley ( you can see my review on Good Reads) and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.\n\nNancy will be in conversation with Victoria Purman on Sunday the 21st of January at Payneham Library and celebrating Crossing the Bridge with a CWA-style afternoon tea. You will need to book your place\n\nWhat drew you to this topic, why did you want to tell this story?\n\nWhen I wrote the first draft of Crossing the Bridge, I happened to be reading a lot of historical fiction stories but was surprised to find that there weren’t a lot of 20th Century historical Australian stories on the shelf, and I wanted to write that story – basically, I wrote the story for me!\n\nAre you writing anything else?\n\nI have lots and lots of story ideas and currently have around 5 unpublished manuscripts, one I have out on submission, and the other I am polishing as just last week I had a request for a full manuscript and will also send it to my current publisher (Harper Collins) the other 3 are sitting waiting in a bottom drawer somewhere! I have too many ideas and too little time.\n\nAbout Nancy\n\nI am in awe of Nancy who works as a scientist- (please tell me your proper scientific title!) and also writes romance. That is quite a leap from the logical analytical part of the brain to the emotional, feeling part of the brain. Does it ever cause problems or confusion?\n\nFor me anyway. I find I can compartmentalise the different aspects of both being a research scientist and a romance writer and I rarely get confused between the two. I work as a senior (insect researcher) and am involved in entomological-related projects. As part of my role, I also curate the Waite Insect and Nematode Collection – a large collection of insects and arthropods – many specimens date back over one hundred years! Being the collection manager, it appeals both to my scientific curiosity but also the historical aspect of the collection is fascinating!\n\nNancy also contributes insightful and supportive comments to the Romance Writers of Australia Aspiring Writers Group.\n\nSome quick-fire questions.\n\nLate nights or early mornings?\n\nEarly mornings/mornings I find are when I am at my brightest. Night times are usually a little fraught as I am usually pretty tired and sometimes exhausted. It’s often the time I spend relaxing with my family.\n\nWhat’s for breakfast?\n\nI like to vary it, Weet-bix/muesli/porridge sometimes toast or a poached egg, I occasionally have fruit smoothies!\n\nNight out or Netflix?\n\nI’m definitely a homebody but not opposed to the occasional evening out.\n\nG &T or Tea/Coffee?\n\nTea and coffee every day, G and T for those days you come home and its hot and you want to chill.\n\nPerfect weekend?\n\nSaturday – A little sleep-in followed by brunch out, come home, relax in the garden, or read. Yummy dinner, either home-cooked or takeaway, Sunday – rinse and repeat!\n\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up?\n\nI wanted to be a zoologist, but also a scriptwriter (for the movies!)\n\nWhat is for dinner tonight? Can you cook? What would you rather be eating?\n\nTonight, it’s an easy stir fry with beef, veggies, and noodles (probably teriyaki). I can cook but find during the week especially I prefer really easy to prepare dishes. I think I feel like pasta tonight!\n\nWhat brings you joy? Lifts your spirits, and chases away a down mood.\n\nI have a relatively sedentary role both at work and as a writer, so I like going for a walk every day – usually with my dog and sometimes my daughter comes too. I love time just to relax and unwind either with family or friends but also, I love time alone just reading a book or occasionally going out and having a massage (there’s a place in every shopping centre these days!)\n\nYour hero?\n\nMy partner – he really grounds me and makes me laugh! I am definitely richer for having him in my life.\n\nIf you could choose three people (living or dead) to invite to a dinner party, who would they be and why?\n\nMarie Curie – a ground-breaking female scientist – I’d like to know what motivated her to continue when she had so many setbacks. Agatha Christie – because she writes the most wonderful murder mysteries where she hides everything you need to know in plain sight! David Attenborough – because he is utterly awesome and I’m sure we could discuss anything and everything!\n\nDo you have any non-writing-related interests?\n\nI like to draw, have made wooden furniture and like doing graphic design stuff (including making book covers!)\n\nWhat would surprise people to know about you?\n\nI love playing video games (usually with female protagonists in story-rich games) and have written many words of fanfiction (before I decided maybe to give this original fiction author business a go!)\n\nLife lessons-what do you wish you’d known earlier?\n\nThat it’s okay to fail because what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger!\n\nQuestions about Writing.\n\nWhat is your writing process like?\n\nI like to plan my first draft – I often spend a lot of time thinking about it before I’ve written a single word. Then I plan roughly each scene/chapter indicating beats – I like to use beat sheets and I write a rough GMC for each chapter. Then with my first draft, I read my GMC for that chapter and go for it. The first draft is very ugly – lots of grammar and spelling errors and I often have to do more research. 2nd draft is a tidy-up and to check structure, 3rd and 4th drafts are polishing and prepping for submission.\n\nDo you have any other projects in the works?\n\nI am currently working on another 1st draft which is a follow-up/sequel to Crossing the Bridge and will feature characters Ronnie (Veronica) and Charlie, set post WW2- fashion, wine, a little bit of espionage and a whole lot of love! I am also tinkering on a novella.\n\nHave you ever resuscitated a project you’d shelved? What helped it work better the second time around?\n\nI wrote a short story that failed miserably in a competition – some of the judge’s comments were odd and not really helpful (they didn’t like WW1 stories so marked me down) I shelved it and then about a year later Clare Griffin asked if I’d like to contribute with her and two other writers, Ava January and Sarah Fiddelaers, to a self-published anthology – 20th Century Historical Romance with an Easter theme.\n\nI resuscitated/rewrote it into a longer story and I am very proud of that contribution! Clare, Ava, Sarah and I went on to do another anthology, this one based around a store in Paris, through the seasons and through four different time periods. We’ve been trying to organise a fourth but we’ve all been so busy!\n\nWhat writing resources have been most helpful to you?\n\nScrivener is a fantastic tool and I love ‘One Stop for Writers’ which is the online version for all the thesaurus that Angela Ackerman and Becca Puglisi have produced (‘The Emotion Thesaurus’) I’ve also found the many writing groups on Facebook a font of knowledge for writing-related questions.\n\nWhat do you know now that you wish you’d known at the beginning of your writing/publishing journey?\n\nDo not ever compare your journey to others – you will only find discontentment!\n\nWhat is your work schedule like when you’re writing?\n\nI like to write my first drafts in a very short amount of time (National Novel Writing Month is good for that!) then I edit and edit and edit and edit.\n\nWhat inspired your new book?\n\nI knew when I wrote Crossing the Bridge that my side character of Veronica Guilford was a fab character, in fact, she was one of 3 POVs (Point of View)in the original story! She had to have her moment in the sun – and now it’s time!\n\nWhat is the most difficult part about writing for you?\n\nI think getting the structure and beats right. If you miss those there is often something off about the story. Also, your main character’s goal motivation and conflict has to be rock solid. Sometimes that needs work!\n\nDid you do any research for your current book?\n\nI write historical so there is always the need for research! Today I was looking up Australian female jazz musicians who worked in bands in the 1940s and 50s!\n\nDo you have a favourite character that you have written? If so, who? And what makes them so special?\n\nThat’s like asking me who my favourite child is (I only have one child so that’s kind of given she’s my favourite) but I love all my characters in different ways. Poppy and Ronnie from Crossing the Bridge I have a great fondness for. I love Poppy because the way I initially wrote her she didn’t have a great character arc (it was pretty flat, and she didn’t have a lot of agency) – I worked hard on her to make her all the things a reader would like without compromising what I loved about her. Ronnie is my sassy character and I have to say I love writing how rude and loud she is! I really loved writing from a male perspective too– and JB was a lot of fun to explore!\n\nDo you think someone could be a writer if they don’t feel emotions?\n\nNot necessarily – I did Becca Symes’s Strength for Writers’ workshops and discovered that my top five strengths are empathy, harmony, positivity, adaptability and woo (working others out). Most of these are in the relationship-building area not the areas that are supposedly related to writers – but the empathy one I had a real revelation as Becca said in the workshop that people with high empathy often have difficulty getting emotion onto the page. Which seems at odds with the very thing being experienced. The reality is that people with high empathy are so caught up in feeling the emotion they are writing – they think it’s been translated to the page when it’s not– learning to translate that to the page is a technical skill that must be learned. How many times has an editor or beta reader said to me when reading my work ‘Nancy, tell me how she feels!!!’\n\nBest writing advice/ Worst writing advice you ever received?\n\nBest – At my very first Romance Writers of Australia conference I was walking to the venue and I met this lovely lady on the street going to the conference. We talked about writing and romance, but it wasn’t until we got to the venue that I realised that it was the late great Valerie Parv, I was gobsmacked, and she wrote about our meeting in her memoir how for a moment we were just two writers talking – Valerie always said that perseverance for a writer is key. Finish that manuscript. Get a rejection? Submit again. Not getting traction? Keep writing, write another manuscript, then another and another. Keep learning, keep writing, keep submitting, it’s a long game and you must have the stamina to keep going if you are to be a success. For me, I like to think it’s a ‘when’ not an ‘if’.\n\nWorst – you have to write every day. Working full time and having a family and other commitments makes it physically, intellectually, and emotionally impossible to write some days. To write you don’t need to flog yourself! A little bit each day goes a long way.\n\nBest money you have spent as a writer?\n\nJoining the Romance Writers of Australia.\n\nDo you have a favourite author and why?\n\nI absolutely love Beatriz Williams novels – honestly, every book she writes is like a dagger through your heart – the story, the characters, the settings, the beautiful writing. I read her work and think I will never ever be that good. She’s amazing!\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nI’m a multitasker – I usually have a few on the go – an audiobook for my commute to work- After the Forest by Kell Woods and I have just received ‘A Country Vet Christmas’ by Lily Malone, Alissa Callen, Penelope Janu, Stella Quinn and Pamela Cook\n\nWhat books or authors have most influenced your writing?\n\nBeatriz Williams, Amy Harmon, Victoria Purman, Penelope Janu, Soraya Lane\n\nFavourite quote (does not matter the source)\n\n“We’ve got to live, no matter how many skies have fallen.” D.H. Lawrence.\n\nFavourite book/story you have read as an adult?\n\nIt’s gritty but I cannot go past Richard Flanagan’s The Narrow Road to the Deep North. I read it several years ago but there are still bits I think about that move me to tears. It was a book that touched my soul.\n\nFavourite book/story you have read as a child?\n\nEnid Blyton’s Magic Faraway Tree books were favourites of mine growing up!\n\nNancy Cunningham is a historical romance writer from Adelaide, with several award-winning short fiction and unpublished manuscript excerpts under her belt. When not working in her role as an entomologist, looking after family, reading, watching too many historical dramas and spider wrangling, Nancy writes about spirited and stoic heroines of the past overcoming adversity.\n\nYou can find Nancy at:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nan_writes\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/NancyMCunningham197\n\nThank you so much for spending time with us Nancy and best wishes for your book’s success.\n\nSharing is caring.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIt’s a pleasure to welcome author Lisa Stanbridge to talk about her new book, Lonely in Paris. Lisa recently placed third in the Romance Writers of Australia, Sweet Treats contest. This is a highly prestigious award and it attracts many, many entries. Congratulations Lisa!\n\nSome getting-to-know-you questions.\n\nLate nights or early mornings? Late nights all the way. My imagination comes alive at night and that’s when I do my best writing. Unfortunately, I also have a full-time job so late nights are not a good idea as I always wake up tired.\n\nWhat’s for breakfast? Bacon, eggs and hashbrowns. Yum!\n\nNight out or Netflix? Netflix for sure, I’m such a homebody.\n\nG &T or Tea/Coffee? I like tea and coffee, but I’ll always choose coffee first.\n\nPerfect weekend? A weekend at home with hubby, relaxing, writing, watching movies or playing games.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up? An author! It’s nice to be able to check that off.\n\nWhat is for dinner tonight? Can you cook? What would you rather be eating? I can cook and do enjoy it, but tonight we’re having spaghetti bolognaise which hubby is cooking!\n\nWhat brings you joy? Lifts your spirits, and chases away a down mood. Going to the beach. Not to swim, but to walk along the sand. There’s nothing quite like the ocean breeze washing away the worries of the day.\n\nYour hero? A family friend named Barry. He’d have to be in his 80’s now and I haven’t seen him for years, but he ‘saved’ me twice in my life and I’ll never forget him. The first time was when I was at a wedding and I was probably about 12 years old. I didn’t have anyone to dance with and I desperately wanted to, but he came up and gave me my first dance. I was flying high for the rest of the night!\n\nThe second time was about a year later when my Nana died. I loved her so much and I was absolutely devastated. At her funeral, I wasn’t allowed to sit in the front row with my family and instead had to sit by myself in the row behind. There were some other people around me, but no one I knew. I couldn’t stop crying throughout the whole funeral but I had no one to comfort me…until Barry came up and held me while I cried. He is truly my hero.\n\nDo you have any non-writing-related interests? Is reading considered a writing-related interest? Because I love reading but always struggle to find enough time to do so. I also love gaming, the relaxing type. Animal Crossing, House Flipper, Stardew Valley, and Pokémon…just to name a few.\n\nWhat would surprise people to know about you? I used to dance when I was younger. All types of dance—tap, highland, jazz, Irish, and ballroom. Never professionally, but I danced for a good few years in my teens. Sadly, I never kept it up.\n\nLife lessons-what do you wish you’d known earlier? That adulthood is hard!\n\nLet’s talk about your new book Lonely in Paris which was released, today 16th January 2023\n\nLonely in Paris is a bit of a passion project. Ever since I visited Paris a few years ago I’ve wanted to write a story set there. I did try writing one about three years ago but I wasn’t happy with it so it went into the ‘maybe’ pile.\n\nThen I decided to join a Paris anthology and I wrote a new story, which is how Lonely in Paris was born. I knew it would work better as romantic comedy/chick lit and so that’s what I did, and it pretty much wrote itself. It’s a fun, light-hearted romantic comedy with some serious aspects because you can’t have romance without a little uncertainty.\n\nThe eBook is available from the 16th of January and will be Amazon exclusive. Anyone can purchase it from Amazon, but anyone with a Kindle Unlimited subscription can read it for free. A paperback will be available wide but will be delayed by a couple of weeks.\n\nTell us about it.\n\nJane’s #1 rule in Paris: Don’t fall in love\n\nAfter ending a disastrous relationship, Jane accepts a job in the City of Love. The trouble is she speaks very little French, has no friends to enjoy Paris with, and she’s awfully lonely.\n\nThen she meets Jacques DuPont.\n\nRich, handsome, and the cream of the Parisian crop, Jacques is living the dream. Just not his own. His father wants him to follow in his footsteps, but Jacques wants to earn his success. Trapped in a life chosen by his family, he’s always been alone.\n\nUntil he meets Jane.\n\nHe’s from money. She’s not.\n\nHe’s a planner. She’s impulsive.\n\nHe’s serious. She’s definitely not.\n\nThey couldn’t be more different, but they will fall. Hard.\n\nTogether Jane and Jacques will learn why Paris is the City of Love. But when an expiring visa, a jealous colleague, and a manipulative family threaten their fledgling relationship, their loyalties will be tested to breaking point.\n\nJane broke her #1 rule, now they must decide what they are willing to sacrifice for love.\n\nAre you writing anything else?\n\nLonely in Paris is book 1 in a 3-book series\n\nConfession: Lonely in Paris was meant to be a standalone, but as I wrote it and the characters grew, I just knew it could be a series. Rather than having different characters in the other 2 books, they’ll instead feature Jane and Jacques during their evolving relationship and the many blips along the way. Book 2 is scheduled to be released on 16th May 2023 (pre-orders will be available when Lonely in Paris is released). Book 3 I’m aiming to release on 16th September, but that date isn’t set in concrete yet. I’ll see how much progress I make on it when I release book 2.\n\nQuestions about Writing.\n\nWhat is your writing process like? Like my current manuscript…a work in progress. It’s an area I’m still trying to perfect. Juggling writing and working full time is something I still haven’t got right.\n\nDo you have any other projects are in the works? So many, my mind is full of ideas and future series. As I mentioned above, I’m working on books 2 and 3 of this series. I’m also editing manuscripts I finished a few years ago that I plan to publish in 2024.\n\nHave you ever resuscitated a project you’d shelved? What helped it work better the second time around? My debut novel, Abandoned Hearts (published in 2020), was a resuscitated project. It took me 6 years from start to publication because I just couldn’t get it right and I kept sitting on it. In that 6 years, I worked on my writing, perfected my voice, learnt and learnt and learnt, until I finally I got it right.\n\nWhat do you know now that you wish you’d known at the beginning of your writing/publishing journey? Drafts don’t have to be perfect. I often expected perfection first go and sometimes even led myself to believe my first draft was perfect even though it was far from it. There’s nothing wrong with a dirty draft where you just spill the words on the page and then go back and fix it later. I’ve started doing that recently and it’s such a great feeling. The words flow better without the pressure of getting everything right.\n\nWhat is the most difficult part about writing for you? Actually getting it down on paper. I get the idea in my head and it all sounds so amazing, but then it comes to writing it and I really struggle sometimes. Since I’ve started writing dirty drafts though, it’s made this a little easier.\n\nDid you do any research for your current book? Yes, because it’s been a long time since I went to Paris, so I needed to make sure what I remembered was still relevant (and in some cases, it wasn’t). I also had to make sure I got the French translations correct.\n\nDo you have a favourite character that you have written? If so, who? And what makes them so special? Oh, this is hard, as I have many. 🙂 Michael and Claire in Abandoned Hearts are close firsts, as is Jacques in Lonely in Paris. But there’s also Hamish in my unpublished manuscript, The Final Masquerade, and Gavin in another unpublished manuscript (planned for 2024 release) Oceans Apart. How do I choose?\n\nDo you think someone could be a writer if they don’t feel emotions? I think anyone can be a writer, but if someone doesn’t feel emotions it’s going to be a lot harder for them. But since I’m an over-emotional person, I can’t even comprehend not feeling emotions.\n\nBest money you have spent as a writer? Purchasing Atticus to format my manuscripts and paying an editor to get my manuscript up to scratch.\n\nDo you have a favourite author and why? I’ve got many, but my top two would be Katie Fforde and Sophie Kinsella. They were instrumental in helping me find my writing style and voice.\n\nWhat are you reading now? Let it Snow by Beth Moran\n\nWhat books or authors have most influenced your writing? Ha, see above!\n\nWhat favourite book/story you have read as an adult? It’ll always be Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen. I agree and the BBC 1995 Adaptation With Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle is about as perfect as you could get.\n\nWhat favourite book/story you have read as a child? The Tin Can Puppy by Wendy Orr and Brian Kogler\n\nThank you so much for talking with us and good luck with Lonely In Paris.\n\nI was fortunate enough to receive an advance copy of Lonely in Paris and have posted a review on Good Reads and in last month’s blog post.\n\nBuy link for Lonely in Paris: https://books2read.com/LonelyinParis\n\nBuy link for Abandoned Hearts: https://books2read.com/AbandonedHearts\n\nSharing is caring.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nThe weather was dismal, as we had twenty eight days of rain in July. The last time the rain was so frequent, in sunny Perth, Australia, was seventy five years ago. Home and comfort was the place to be. My local library provided most of the books I’ve been reading this month. Television provided few distractions, so I happily got lost in a good book.\n\nWhen She Was Good by Michael Robotham.\n\nCriminal psychologist Cyrus Haven and Evie Cormac return in this new thriller from author Michael Robotham. Who is Evie, the girl with no past, running from? She was discovered hiding in a secret room in the aftermath of a terrible crime. Her ability to tell when someone is lying helped Cyrus crack an impenetrable case in Good Girl, Bad Girl. Now, the closer Cyrus gets to uncovering answers about Evie’s dark history, the more he exposes Evie to danger, giving her no choice but to run. Ultimately, both will have to decide if some secrets are better left buried and some monsters should never be named…\n\nMY REVIEW.\n\nAlthough this continues the story which began in Good Girl, Bad Girl, it could be read as a stand-alone. Tautly plotted and filled with tension, the story follows Evie Cormac, aka Angel Face. She was a child discovered at a horrific crime scene. Evie is deeply traumatised, trusting no -one, apart from Cyrus Haven, the criminal psychologist who initially got her to speak. Evie has the unerring ability to know when someone is lying. When she says their lives are in danger, Cyrus doesn’t believe her.\n\nThe Mystery of Three Quarters by Sophie Hannah\n\nThe world’s most beloved detective, Hercule Poirot, the legendary star of Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Orient Express and most recently The Monogram Murders and Closed Casket, returns in a stylish, diabolically clever mystery set in the London of 1930.\n\nHercule Poirot returns home after an agreeable luncheon to find an angry woman waiting to berate him outside his front door. Her name is Sylvia Rule, and she demands to know why Poirot has accused her of the murder of Barnabas Pandy, a man she has neither heard of nor ever met. She is furious to be so accused, and deeply shocked. Poirot is equally shocked, because he too has never heard of any Barnabas Pandy, and he certainly did not send the letter in question. He cannot convince Sylvia Rule of his innocence, however, and she marches away in a rage.\n\nShaken, Poirot goes inside, only to find that he has a visitor waiting for him — a man called John Mc Crodden who also claims also to have received a letter from Poirot that morning, accusing him of the murder of Barnabas Pandy…\n\nPoirot wonders how many more letters of this sort have been sent in his name. Who sent them, and why? More importantly, who is Barnabas Pandy, is he dead, and, if so, was he murdered? And can Poirot find out the answers without putting more lives in danger?\n\nMY REVIEW. It’s a while since I read Agatha Christie and I was intrigued to learn that Sophie Hannah had been authorised by the Christie estate to continue the series. I picked this one at random, not realising it was the third in the series. There is a new inspector, Inspector Edward Catchpole, replacing Inspector James Japp. George, Poirot’s Valet also makes an appearance. I missed Captain Hastings and Miss Lemon. Hasting to pose the questions that we all would like to ask. Miss Lemon for her solid devotion to Poirot. The book is cleverly plotted, but for me, it felt a bit flat.\n\nThe Charleston Scandal by Pamela Hart.\n\nIf you devoured THE CROWN you will love this exuberant story of a young Australian actress caught up in the excesses, royal intrigues and class divide of Jazz Age London, losing her way but reclaiming her heart in the process\n\nLondon, 1920s: Kit Scott, a privileged young Australian aiming to become a star, arrives in the city to find the Jazz Age in full swing. Cast in a West End play opposite another young hopeful, Canadian Zeke Gardiner, she dances blithely into the heady lifestyle of English high society and the London theatre set, from Noel Coward to Fred Astaire and his sister, Adele.\n\nWhen Kit is photographed dancing the Charleston alongside the Prince of Wales, she finds herself at the centre of a major scandal, sending the Palace into damage control and Kit to her aristocratic English relatives – and into the arms of the hedonistic Lord Henry Carleton. Amid the excesses of the Roaring Twenties, both Zeke and Kit are faced with temptations – and make choices that will alter the course of their lives forever.\n\nReaders of Natasha Lester’s A KISS FROM MR FITZGERALD will love THE CHARLESTON SCANDAL. Bestselling author Pamela Hart’s energetic, masterful storytelling will have you glued right until the end.\n\nMY REVIEW. From starting this book, I was immersed in its setting and felt as if I was a participant in Jazz Age London. As an ex-pat Brit, I had of course heard all about dazzling David, the Prince of Wales. Later, he became Edward VIII who subsequently abdicated in favour of his brother Bertie, who became George VI. At the heart of the story is a presumed scandal, that the Prince of Wales should be caught dancing the Charleston with an actress. Australian Kit Scott has orders both from her theatre management and the Palace, to appear alongside someone else. They even provide the decoy in Lord Henry Carlton. He is amiable and aimless. He’s a younger son, with nothing to do and all the time in the world to do it. This conflicts with the connection that Kit has built with Zeke, her dance partner in the play. There they are both second leads and socialise in the theatrical world. As Colonials they feel a sense of connection, and maybe something more.\n\nA Woman’s Courage by Simon Block. Book Three in the Home Fire Series.\n\nAs bombs continue to fall on the North West of England, the members of one town’s WI fight harder than ever to help the war effort. Grieving for men already lost or anxious for those still away fighting, the women of Great Paxford must rely on each other. Amidst the complexities of broken relationships, loss, love, betrayal and sudden freedom, this group of very different women must work together to find a way through.\n\nDespite the chaos of war, behind closed doors they fight more personal battles. Pat is reeling from her own role in her husband’s death, while Steph is struggling to come to terms with significant changes in her life.\n\nTogether the women of Great Paxford must find a way through .\n\nMY REVIEW.\n\nKnowing this book was the last in the series, reading it was bittersweet. I can understand Simon wants to get onto other projects, but these characters have become real to so many. We were heartbroken when Britain’s ITV cancelled the series, as it was a cut above so many other dramas. Well scripted, and well-cast, we glimpsed the lives of our grandparents or parents. Despite being set in a Cheshire village, and not a battlefield, plenty was going on. We see the likes of Downton Abbey more frequently than stories of ordinary people. That was what made the series and books so fascinating. Daily challenges such as make do and mend, food shortages, worry about loved ones. Daily life, not as we know it, but how it was for millions of Brits.\n\nMost storylines made sense, some happy, some sad. New characters such as the doctor integrating with our old favourites. What rang true for me was the petty jealousies and gossip, as well as the kindness and pulling together. I am sad to say goodbye to these much-loved characters.\n\nSon of A Witch by Louisa West. Midlife in Mosswood, Book Five.\n\nShe knew she’d have to find something old and something new. This wasn’t what she was expecting.\n\nRosemary Bell is going to the chapel and someone’s gonna get married. But when an unexpected visitor begins causing trouble in Mosswood, the something blue on Tammy’s big day could end up being the bride.\n\nFor better or worse, Fox Cottage has a new resident. And mostly, it’s for worse. With Declan struggling to rein in his way ward son, Rosie ends up playing referee as well as bridesmaid–and she doesn’t look good in stripes. Wanting to support her boyfriend and still keep peace in the neighborhood, Rosie is stuck between a diamond and a hard place.\n\nWhen the teenage troublemakers commit a ceremony foul, will Rosie find herself one family richer or one group of friends poorer?\n\nFreaky Friday meets My Best Friend’s Wedding in this short novel about the vows we make, the promises we break, and the things we do for family’s sake.\n\nMY REVIEW. Rosie’s life keeps getting more complicated, and her magical ability isn’t proving helpful. She’s torn between wanting to keep the peace, or her sanity. Maggie, Rosie’s daughter is slightly in awe of her new sibling. He’s not one for conforming or fitting in. Anyone who has dealt with truculent teens will have sympathy for Rosie and Declan. The book still has the trademark wit and good humour with the characters we have come to know and care about.\n\nThe Bermondsey Bookshop by Mary Gibson.\n\nSet in 1920s London, this is the inspiring story of Kate Goss’s struggle against poverty, hunger and cruel family secrets.\n\nHer mother died in a fall, her father has vanished without trace, and now her aunt and cousins treat her viciously. In a freezing, vermin-infested garret, factory girl Kate has only her own brave spirit and dreams of finding her father to keep her going. She has barely enough money to feed herself, or to pay the rent. The factory where she works begins to lay off people and it isn’t long before she has fallen into the hands of the violent local money-lender. That is until an unexpected opportunity comes her way – a job cleaning a most unusual bookshop, where anyone, from factory workers to dockers, can learn to read and then buy books cheaply. A new world opens up, but with it come new dangers, too. Based on the true story of the Bermondsey Bookshop, this is the most inspiring and gripping novel Mary Gibson has yet written.\n\nMY REVIEW. I am pretty much guaranteed to pick up any book with a bookshop, or a library in the title. This story though focussed more on the main character Kate Goss. She is an unloved child ,who has been foisted on her aunt. Her mother is dead, and her father has disappeared. The grim surrounding and tough treatment meted out to Kate were very reminiscent of a Catherine Cookson novel. Her deprivation and the cruelty of her family were hard to take. Kate works a difficult and dirty job as a tin worker. When her aunt throws her out, she needs more work to survive. She finds it as a cleaner at the Bermondsey Bookshop. Through her part-time work there, she is gradually drawn into the lives of some of the middle-class patrons. When a Pygmalion transformation takes place, Kate learns how the other half lives. The part I found most interesting was about the bookshop ( based on the real bookshop) and its ethos.\n\nPurls and Poison by Anne Canadeo. A Black Sheep Company Mystery.\n\nWhen a fellow Black Sheep Knitter is suspected of poisoning her coworker, the group puts down their needles and takes up their friend’s defense . . .\n\nSuzanne Cavanaugh has just about had it with her office rival at Prestige Properties. It’s bad enough that Liza Devereaux is constantly needling her at work, but when she shows up at one of Suzanne’s open houses to poach potential buyers, it’s the last straw. No one in the office fails to hear the two snarling at each other.\n\nWhen Liza is later found dead in her office cubicle–poisoned by a diet shake–Suzanne becomes the prime suspect. It’s soon discovered, though, that Liza had double-crossed so many around town and stashed their dark secrets in her designer handbags that anyone could be the culprit.\n\nThe Black Sheep Knitters have no doubt their friend has been framed–but they need to prove it. Stirred to action, they get together to catch a sneaky killer who’s trying to pull the wool over everyone’s eyes . . .\n\nMY REVIEW. They say you can’t judge a book by its cover, but it was the cover of this one that attracted me first. Ironically, neither the gorgeous feline nor the string of pearls appears in the book. Did the cover designer mix up pearls and purls?\n\nWork rivals Suzanne and Liza have had a less than cordial relationship in the past, but does that mean Suzanne murdered her rival? The police certainly seem to think so. They know that Suzanne had a very public row with Liza over client poaching. As the case unfolds, Suzanne is helped by her knitting club pals and begins to learn about a different side of Liza. The pace of the story flowed well and gave us a couple of interesting possible suspects. An easy and entertaining read.\n\nFinding Love at Mermaid Terrace by Kate Forster.\n\nLove comes when you least expect it…\n\nTressa Buckland likes her quiet life in Port Lowdy, with its cobbled streets and colourful terraced houses overlooking the sea. Her job at the local paper allows her to pursue her art in her free time, with no one but her tabby cat Ginger Pickles to mind her in Mermaid Terrace. But then the owner of the paper is called away on an emergency, and it’s up to Tressa to run the paper for six months. Her first task: find a new part-time journalist.\n\nDan Byrne is the angriest man in Ireland – or so the readers of his very successful column, ‘Dan takes on the world’, think. But after a story goes south and he loses his job in Dublin, Dan has no choice but to start afresh. When an opportunity comes up in sleepy Cornwall, Dan and his Golden Retriever Ritchie set off for a new adventure.\n\nFor Tressa, Dan’s arrival to Port Lowdy changes everything. Tressa tries not to look too deeply at her own life, but Dan sees a story to uncover in absolutely everyone – even her. The two of them couldn’t be more different… yet, if they can find a way to work together, they may just breathe new life and joy into this sleepy seaside village.\n\nFinding Love at Mermaid Terrace is a heart -warming new village romance about the power of love and kindness, from the bestselling author of Starting Over at Acorn Cottage\n\nKindle Edition, 263 pages Published February 4th 2021 by Aria.Paperback to follow.\n\nMY REVIEW. Having lived in Cornwall as a child, I do have a soft spot for books set in Cornwall. It was easy to visualise the village and setting. Treena is a lonely character, happily isolated from her family, due to her mother’s expectations. She lives in Port Lowdy, where she feels happy at home. But life changes and her carefully constructed world is upended. George, her boss has left her in charge of the local paper, and she employs Irishman Dan to take on the reporting duties. He arrives with his gorgeous dog Ritchie and soon makes Port Lowdy his home. His charm had everyone telling him their stories and he’s just the one to write them. Treena feels life is brighter with Dan around and begins to trust him. But then, a story threatens to tear them apart. I enjoyed this book, but there was one loss that broke my heart.\n\nMiss Benson’s Beetle by Rachel Joyce.\n\nMargery Benson’s life ended the day her father walked out of his study and never came back. Forty years later, abandoning a dull job, she advertises for an assistant. The successful candidate is to accompany Margery on an expedition to the other side of the world to search for a beetle that may or may not exist. Enid Pretty is not who she had in mind. But together they will find themselves drawn into an adventure that exceeds all Margery’s expectations, eventually finding new life at the top of a red mountain.\n\nThis is a story that is less about what can be found than the belief it might be found; it is an intoxicating adventure story and it is also a tender exploration of a friendship between two unforgettable women that defies all boundaries.\n\nMY REVIEW. I was first drawn in by the intriguing title and soon began to appreciate the solitary life led by Miss Benson. An ordinary spinster, in the post-war period in Britain. One out of character event starts her on the path to going on a beetle hunt. She is a relatable character, with her insecurities, and foibles. When she advertises for an assistant, most of the applicants are unsuitable. Still, she embarks on her quest to find the mythical golden beetle. Think Thelma and Louise meet Raiders of the Lost Ark.\n\nThe Heroine’s Journey: For Writers, Readers, and Fans of Pop Culture by GailCarriger.\n\nTired of the hero’s journey?\n\nFrustrated that funny, romantic, and comforting stories aren’t taken seriously?\n\nSad that the books and movies you love never seem to be critically acclaimed, even when they sell like crazy?\n\nThe heroine’s journey is here to help.\n\nMultiple New York Times bestselling author Gail Carriger presents a clear concise analysis of the heroine’s journey, how it differs from the hero’s journey, and how you can use it to improve your writing and your life.\n\nIn this book you’ll learn:\n\n* How to spot the heroine’s journey in popular books, movies, and the world around you.\n\n* The source myths and basic characters, tropes, and archetypes of this narrative.\n\n* A step-by-step break down of how to successfully write this journey.\n\nWhat do Agatha Christie, JK Rowling, and Nora Roberts all have in common?\n\nThey all write the heroine’s journey. Read this book to learn all about it.\n\nFrom Harry Potter to Twilight, from Wonder Woman to Star Wars, you’ll never look at pop culture the same way again.\n\nWith over a dozen NYT and USA Today bestsellers, and over a million books in print, popular genre author and former archaeologist Gail Carriger brings her cheeky comedic tone and over a decade of making her living as a fiction author to this fascinating look at one of the most popular yet neglected narratives of our time. The presentation she does on this subject sells for hundreds of dollars.\n\n“I’m not sure how you can just rewire my brain to see the heroine’s journey like this and then expect me to make coherent, thought-out comments about the text when all I want to do is hold it in my twisted little grip while I shove it at people screaming like a madman and pointing at passages.”\n\n~ Author Beta Reader\n\nGail Carriger uses the heroine’s journey to produce bestselling, critically-acclaimed books that genre blend science fiction, cozy mystery, young adult, urban fantasy, romance, historical fiction, and alternate history. In this non-fiction book she uses her academic background and creative writing skills to bring to life the archetypes, tropes, story beats, themes, and messages inherent in the heroine’s journey. Part treatise on authorship, part feminist literary criticism, part how to write guide, Carriger uses mythology, legend, and Gothic Victorian 19th century literature to explore movies, screenwriting, books, and audience desires.\n\nThis is an excellent reference guide for genre fiction authors seeking to improve their craft or for readers and pop culture enthusiasts interested in understanding their own taste. It is the perfect counterpoint to The Hero with a Thousand Faces not to mention Save the Cat, Women Who Run with The Wolves, and The Breakout Novelist.\n\nKindle Edition, 285 pages Published October 1st 2020 by GAIL CARRIGER LLC\n\nMY REVIEW. Finally, a book that makes sense of the heroine’s journey. Tired of trying to fit stories into the prescriptive and restrictive hero’s journey, and wondering where you went wrong? Perhaps like me, you queried where the heroine fitted into the hero’s journey and was answered dismissively. Try as you might your story wouldn’t fit that pattern. It was the wrong pattern- The Heroine’s Journey is the book that might change your writing life.\n\nThe Word is Murder by Anthony Horowitz.\n\nA woman crosses a London street.\n\nIt is just after 11am on a bright spring morning, and Diana Cowper is going into a funeral parlour to organise her own service.\n\nA mere six hours later she is dead, strangled with a crimson curtain cord in her own home.\n\nDid she know she was going to die?\n\nDid she recognise her killer?\n\nAre the two events even related? Because nobody arranges their own funeral, and the gets killed the same day – do they?\n\nEnter Daniel Hawthorne, a detective with a genius for solving crimes and an ability to hold his secrets very close.\n\nWith him is his writing partner, Anthony Horowitz. Together they will set out to solve this most puzzling of mysteries.\n\nWhat neither of them know is that they are about to embark on a dark and dangerous journey where the twists and turns are as unexpected as they are bloody..\n\nMY REVIEW. Anthony Horowitz likes to challenge his readers, not because he doesn’t give them a good, imaginatively creative, and intricately plotted story. He does, but he also does the unexpected. This time, he is a character in the book he is writing. On the one hand, it is interesting to learn about his writing experiences and thoughts on writing. On the other hand, I found it vaguely unsettling, the blurring of fact and fiction. And to add to the confusion, he thanks his fictional detective in the acknowledgements.\n\nA Season in Paris: A Historical Anthology by Ava January, Nancy Cunningham, Sarah Fiddelaers, Clare Griffin.\n\nOne Paris shop, four women, four decades of intrigue…\n\nSpring, 1909\n\nWhen Delphine Altrain purchases a date with Paris’ most eligible bachelor, Gabriel La Pouge, she has one thing on her mind…hats. When her latest design becomes the talk of the Grand Prix, it seems everything she has dreamed of is within her reach, but when the past arrives to destroy her present, Delphine needs to decide, stay and risk heartbreak, or run and always wonder what could have been.\n\nSummer, 1924\n\nBeautiful Edith Carrow appears to have it all. As Coco Chanel’s mannequin her life is full of parties and the adoration of a rich man. But Edith holds a deep secret from her past. When she meets toymaker, Henri, her heart threatens to unravel all she has worked hard to achieve. She must choose, follow her head or listen to her heart and risk losing everything.\n\nAutumn, 1935\n\nGenevieve Dupuis is forbidden from doing two things; painting and falling in love. So when she meets handsome Sebastian on a forbidden painting trip her life becomes ever so slightly complicated. Can a girl who has learned to survive by lies and illusions face up to the truth in time to realise that sometimes surrender is the bravest act of all?\n\nWinter, 1944\n\nSOE agent Therese Lambert is about to risk everything to help free Canadian airman Will – a man hiding his own covert activities beneath an identity she knows isn’t his. Fleeing from the German occupiers and the collaborating French, they escape Paris. Can their budding attraction survive a perilous journey, or will a betrayal put both their lives on the line?\n\nKindle Edition Published July 26th 2021 by Girl On A Soapbox Press. Paperback to follow.\n\nMY REVIEW. Books about Paris are perennially popular and this one contains four individual stories. Each story highlights a different epoch and aspect of Paris, but all are equally engaging with that ineffable je ne sais quoi of Parisian flair. I read this quickly, finding it an easy and enjoyable read. I received an ARC of this book, but with no obligation to review it.\n\nSharing is caring.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nIts a pleasure to welcome Monique Mulligan, author of Wherever You Go to the Chatting with Authors Page.\n\nMonique Mulligan is an author, freelance editor & marketing officer at Koorliny Arts Centre.\n\nMonique is known for her love of words, of cooking, and of cats.\n\nWhat is the book about?\n\nWherever You Go is about a marriage in crisis after a life-shattering tragedy. Desperate to save their foundering marriage, chef Amy Bennet and her husband Matt move to the small town of Blackwood in the south-west of Western Australia. In denial from guilt and grief, Amy opens a café and starts an Around the World Supper Club and soon finds herself becoming part of a community, but is blind to Matt’s accelerating struggle with incomplete grief. It’s a story of grief and loss, of friendship and community, of renewal and redemption, and the healing power of food.\n\n“Monique Mulligan has written a heartwarming tale to make you laugh, cry and gasp in surprise.” SheSociety\n\n“This debut novel is beautiful in its execution, raw and powerful.” – The Book Muse\n\nSuch great reviews, so tell us what inspired the book?\n\nI was inspired by a number of things – a real-life event, my love of food and cooking, the beautiful countryside of Bridgetown, and my interest in relationships and how challenges affect them differently.\n\nWe will chat about the book and your writing later.\n\nFirst, some quick fire questions.\n\nLate nights or early mornings? Early mornings.\n\nWhat’s for breakfast? Yoghurt, homemade granola and berries.\n\nNight out or Netflix? Netflix.\n\nG &T or Tea/coffee? Definitely not G&T – I think it’s the tonic water I don’t like. Love a good coffee (not instant) or herbal tea, especially peppermint.\n\nPerfect weekend? Reading, writing, cooking, seeing family.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up? A journalist. In Year 12 I wanted to be the next Jana Wendt (A Current Affair). My career took me full circle into journalism (print, not TV) in my mid-thirties and the skills I learnt were invaluable.\n\nCan you cook? I know the answer to that one!\n\nWhat is for dinner tonight? Tuna steaks and green veg.\n\nHa ha, yes I can and I love to cook. Right now, a lemon poppy seed tea cake is cooling on the stove.\n\nHave you always loved cooking, are you self-taught or did you learn as child? I am self-taught but loved to practice when I had the opportunity as a child. Mum wasn’t a big fan of letting us kids use the kitchen though, so the opportunities were few and far between until I married and had my own kitchen to cook in. One of the ways I show people I care for them is through cooking – soups, cakes … feasts!\n\nFavourite meal?\n\nToo hard! I love Middle Eastern and Mediterranean foods. Maybe a chicken tagine with preserved lemons and olives.\n\nWhat brings you joy? Lifts your spirits, chases away a down mood. Cat videos! Patting my cat. Walking on the beach. So many things …\n\nYour hero? I can’t single out one person. I find many people to be inspirational or admirable for different reasons, but I wouldn’t say I have a hero.\n\nQuestions about Writing.\n\nYour love of photography- has it impacted your writing in any way? Do you see scenes more visually because of it, or has it had another kind of impact? Photography is a hobby I truly enjoy. I’ve been told I have “the eye” but I’m no expert. The technical side of photography boggles my brain and I’m not sure I’ll ever get it.\n\nI like to carry a camera with me because I often see things I want to capture, whether for later reference or because they speak to me in some way. Does it impact my writing? Yes, in a way. I used a vision board when I was first drafting Wherever You Go. It was full of pictures I’d taken around and about in Bridgetown, Western Australia (which was the inspiration for the setting). I can’t quite visualise in my mind (as in, if I’m meditating, I can never see the waterfall or the gently flowing stream) but I do learn visually.\n\nWere you always going to write about food? That came to me later – I knew I wanted to write a novel and loved reading “foodie” fiction, but I didn’t set out to write about food initially. Now it just seems natural!\n\nWhy do you think that stories of failure and redemption resonate so powerfully? It’s such a universal experience, isn’t it. I think it’s that universality that resonates – we all know what it’s like to fail, to mess up, to lose. Likewise, most understand that redemption is a powerful need and a life-changing gift, whether it comes from ourselves or another.\n\nWhat time of the day do you usually write? Mornings when I can fit it in, otherwise afternoons on a weekend. I usually get in the zone.\n\nWhat is the most difficult part about writing for you? Drafting! I am so slow in this stage. I am not a person who drafts fast at all. I’ve tried and it doesn’t work for me.\n\nWhat would you say is your most interesting writing quirk? I make faces when I write, talk to myself, and sometimes “act” out certain actions and dialogues. That’s three quirks …\n\nDo you have a favourite character that you have written? I really loved the character of Irene in Wherever You Go. She’s 69-going-on-70, a nurturing woman who has always put others first, a jam-maker, and a protector. She longs to travel, but has to put her dreams on hold. She reminds me of my grandmother a bit.\n\nDo you think someone could be a writer if they don’t feel emotions?\n\nThat’s such an interesting question, Sonia. I think it would be hard to write if you felt nothing at all. How would you empathise with your characters? Above all, readers want to have an experience, and a writer’s job is to trigger their emotions and feelings to generate that experience using a combination of techniques. The writer doesn’t need to have experienced those exact emotions themselves, and, if they haven’t, could ask, ‘What is the character feeling? What else is the character experiencing?’ or research others’ lived experiences to engage with that scene as genuinely as possible.\n\nBut surely you must at least be able to imagine those feelings. That’s my thought, anyway.\n\nBest writing advice? Trust the process is advice that works for me. What doesn’t work is ‘write every day’ – I need to balance work, family and writing in a way that prevents the feeling of overwhelm. I do want to write ‘morning pages’ every day, but I’m struggling to make it happen on work days. I would have to schedule my time so tightly – or get up even earlier than I already do – and my sleeping time is already being challenged by the fact of getting older! So I choose the way that works for me.\n\nBest money you have spent as a writer? A manuscript assessment by Laurie Steed.\n\nHow can I ignore all-around inspiration and muse Boogle?\n\nSonia, you know we can’t ignore cats – they ignore us! They make it very hard to be ignored when they want attention, and Boogle is no exception. Right now, I’ve taken a break from writing to answer these questions, and she is sitting on the floor next to me, loudly licking her butt. There’s a visual for you. That’s annoying, but I quite like it (love it, really) when she sits on my lap while I’m writing … and when she joins in my cooking videos (you can see them on Instagram).\n\nDo you have a favourite author and why? Daphne du Maurier – I love her gothic-style stories about the darker side of human nature. They’re mysterious and uneasy, and clever and unexpected.\n\nWhat are you reading now? I’m reading The Godmothers by Monica McInerny. Next, I’ll be reading The Breaking by Irma Gold.\n\nFavourite quote (does not matter the source): “Talk to yourself like you would to someone you love.” – Brene Brown\n\nFavourite book/story you have read as an adult? Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier.\n\nFavourite book/story you have read as a child? Anne of Green Gables by L.M. Montgomery.\n\nThanks, Monique, its been wonderful to learn about your writing style and your process.

Nothing is overwhelming once it’s been explained. If you are smart enough to write a book, you are smart enough to do everything else needed to make your indie author business a success.\n\nMy review. I have this on Kindle, and I wish I had it in paperback as well. It’s a book I expect to refer to again and again.

Would you like to write a book that readers eagerly devour?\n\nMany authors write, then market. Successful authors write TO market. They start by figuring out how to give readers what they want, and that process begins before writing word one of your novel.\n\nThis book will teach you to analyse your favourite genre to discover what readers are buying, to mine reviews for reader expectations, and to nail the tropes your readers subconsciously crave.\n\nDon’t leave the success of your novel up to chance. Deliver the kind of book that will have your fans hounding you for the next one.\n\nMy review. With a premise like that what writer wouldn’t want to read it? Encouraging and definitely worth considering the marketability of your book.\n\nThe Library Bag Selections\n\nRavenscliffe by Jane Sanderson\n\nFor fans of Downton Abbey . . . The peaceful beauty of the English countryside belies the turmoil of forbidden love and the apprehension of a changing world for the families of Netherwood\n\nYorkshire, 1904. On Netherwood Common, Russian émigré Anna Rabinovich shows her dear friend Eve Williams a gracious Victorian villa—Ravenscliffe—the house Anna wants them to live in. There’s a garden and a yard and room enough for their children to play and grow.\n\nSomething about the house speaks to Anna, and you should listen to a house, she believes…Ravenscliffe holds the promise of happiness.\n\nAcross the square, Clarissa and her husband, the Earl of Netherwood, are preparing for King Edward’s visit. Clarissa is determined to have everything in top shape at Netherwood Hall—in spite of the indolent heir to the estate, Tobias, and his American bride—and much of it depends on the work going on downstairs as the loyal servants strive to preserve the noble family’s dignity and reputation.\n\nAs Anna restores Ravenscliffe to its full grandeur, she strikes up a relationship with hardworking Amos Sykes—who proposed to Eve just one year ago.\n\nBut when Eve’s long-lost brother Silas turns up in their close-knit mining community, cracks begin to appear in even the strongest friendships.\n\nAs change comes to the small town and society at large, the residents of Netherwood must find their footing or lose their place altogether.\n\nMy review. This is the second book following on from Netherwood which I read last month. Fortunately, I had bought it but hadn’t read it- and of course,I wanted to read it before reading Ravenscliffe. I am glad I did, as this second book made more sense after reading it.\n\nLife is changing for the families, upstairs in Lord Netherwood’s household, his heir Tobias has no intention of taking his position or his responsibilities seriously. His sister, Henrietta, would be an exemplary heir, but she’s female. A couple of major events alter everyone’s plans. Eve Williams has gained status and the family has moved to a bigger house called Ravenscliffe. Anna, the Russian emigre was the mover in this, and she plays a more substantial part in this story. Some of the stories engaged me and other parts I found dull. Primarily concerning Amos and politics, although some of the mining information also felt a bit laboured to me. The standout for me was the emergence and transformation of Anna. I know there is a third book in the series, but I doubt I will read it.\n\nDon’t Go by Lisa Scottoline.\n\nWhen Dr Mike Scanlon is called to serve as an army doctor in Afghanistan, he’s acutely aware of the dangers he’ll face and the hardships it will cause his wife Chloe and newborn baby. And deep inside, he doesn’t think of himself as a warrior, but a healer.\n\nHowever, in an ironic turn of events, as Mike operates on a wounded soldier in a war-torn country, Chloe dies at home\n\nMy Review I would never have chosen this book for myself but decided to give it a go. Let me say at the onset it’s not for the faint-hearted as surgical procedures are explained in detail. At first, I thought that might be overdone but as the book continued I realised the relevance of Mike’s experiences to his handling of events stateside. He’s now a sole parent and has dual responsibilities to his surgical team and patients and his daughter. It’s a combination of murder mystery and legal procedural and deals with how good people can be torn apart by events.\n\nMore Than Words by Jill Santopolo.\n\nFrom the New York Times, bestselling author of The Light We Lost comes a tender and moving new novel about a woman at a crossroads after the death of her father and caught between the love of two men.\n\nNina Gregory has always been a good daughter, a good girlfriend. Raised by her father, owner of New York City’s glamorous Gregory Hotels, after her mother’s death, Nina was taught that family, reputation, and legacy are what matter most. And her boyfriend Tim, thoughtful, kind, and honest, not to mention her best friend since childhood, feels the same. But after Nina’s father passes away, she learns he may not have practised what he preached.\n\nAs her world falls apart, Nina begins to question everything she thought she knew and to see the men in her life–her father, her boyfriend, and unexpectedly, her handsome and attentive boss, Rafael–in a new light. Soon Nina finds herself caught between the world she knows and loves and a passion that could upend everything.\n\nMore than Words is a heartbreaking and romantic novel about grief, loss, love, and self-discovery, and how we choose which life we are meant to live.\n\nMy Review Having never heard of the author I did not expect anything of the book, but it resonated with me and I raced through it. In part, I suspect that as an only daughter I understood Nina’s wish to pleas her father. Nina is her father’s daughter, her choices modelled on what he would approve of. Her life is already mapped out for her, a suitable boyfriend, marriage and maintaining the Gregory hotel and its and her reputation. She is almost sleepwalking through life when Rafael her charismatic boss, makes her look again at all she has. Then her father’ s death disrupts her carefully planned life. Will she continue down the same path or is there another, better way forward?\n\nPersonal Choices. Hemlock and Hedge: The Witches of Wormwood Prequel\n\nOnly a witch would poison a cake. And only another witch would blackmail the poisoner.\n\nHazel Salem is the family disappointment. She isn’t a witch.\n\nShe doesn’t believe in magic. And she definitely doesn’t want a black cat for a pet.\n\nBut when she discovers an unsolved mystery amongst her inheritance, she is forced to accept that ignoring her heritage is no longer an option.\n\nHazel is determined to reveal a secret that’s stayed hidden for years.\n\nBut the witches of Wormwood have other ideas…\n\nMy Review. I enjoyed this prequel, so much so that I bought the first five books in the series. Several things appealed to me. Firstly, the English setting, then the fact that Hazel had no idea she was a witch or had abilities and the brilliant addition of Hemlock, a black cat with catattitude.\n\nThe Secrets of Primrose Square by Claudia Carroll.\n\nThere are so many stories hidden behind closed doors . . .\n\nIt’s late at night and the rain is pouring down on the Dublin city streets. A mother is grieving for her dead child. She stands silently outside the home of the teenage boy she believes responsible. She watches . . .\n\nIn a kitchen on the same square, a girl waits anxiously for her mum to come home. She knows exactly where she is, but she knows she cannot reach her.\n\nA few doors down and a widow sits alone in her room. She has just delivered a bombshell to her family during dinner and her life is about to change forever.\n\nAnd an aspiring theatre director has just moved into a flat across the street. Her landlord is absent, but there are already things about him that don’t quite add up . . .\n\nWelcome to Primrose Square.\n\nMy review\n\nAll you would expect from an Irish writer in the Maeve Binchy tradition. The book has heart. The women who are the inhabitants of Primrose Square are dealing with a variety of changes and secrets, Nancy who has escaped her past London life. Melissa a girl whose life has changed dramatically and whose mother is barely hanging on. Susan, her mother who is obsessed with loss. Jayne, who lives her life in the past talking to Tom her deceased husband.\n\nNew Witch on the Block by Louisa West.\n\nPractical Magic meets Bridget Jones’ Diary in this fun, heart-warming short novel about starting over, putting family first, and finding love when you least expect it.\n\nShe thought she was running away from her past, not catching up with it.\n\nRosemary Bell just wants to live a quiet, happy life and raise her daughter as far away from her toxic ex-husband as she can get. But when they move into a decrepit cottage in the woods of Mosswood, Georgia, Rosie realises her life will never be simple.\n\nMy review.\n\nA fun beginning to what promises to be an entertaining new series. I had this book on pre-order, so it was immediately available on release day on my Kindle. The town of Mosswood is a retreat for Rosie and her daughter Maggie, after packing up and leaving everything behind to start again. However, it’s not as straightforward as she might have hoped. Her rental is an almost derelict cottage and her nearest neighbour, Declan has some strange ideas about who she is and what they might accomplish together. After leaving her vicious and controlling ex Rose isn’t ready to get inv.oved with anyone, let alone this hunky Irishman. I predict some fun and exciting times ahead and I am looking forward to reading book two, Jealousy A Bitch, which is due in September.\n\nThe Book of Spells and Such by Jacquie Underdown\n\nWhen destiny knocks, do you invite it in?\n\nWhen a spell book lands on Ariana’s doorstep, her world is thrown into turmoil. That’s nothing new for her, except this time it involves bizarre and terrifying creatures who attempt to kill her. Then there’s a little fact that she now has the ability to perform magic.\n\nHadeon is another new addition in her life. He happened to drop in at the same time the spell book appeared. He’s dark, sexy, and mysterious as hell, and Ariana doesn’t know if she wants to kill him or love him.\n\nBut all this chaos is nothing compared to what destiny has in store for her. A future is promised of royalty and immense power, palaces and undying love. But hers is a destiny that is not easily won. She will have to fight to the death against those who want to take it all for themselves. And when the real battle begins, just who the true enemy is will surprise everyone.\n\nMy review. Expecting a magical story, I was slightly confused as the story began in the rather sleazy everyday world. In fact, I almost gave up, but I am glad that I persevered. Ariana had no one to turn to as she grew up. She has been treated badly almost her whole life, so she has trust issues. Hadeon could be her protector or her worst nightmare, but she has to trust someone when life takes a totally unexpected turn. To me, a part of the story read like a modern fairy-tale and had some unique magical touches. I am happy I continued to read this book.\n\nSubterranean by B Michael Radburn.\n\n‘The past is my shadow, forever behind me.’\n\nCassie Belrose was used to looking over her shoulder. Running away was what she did best – away from a possessive husband who wants her back, running from city to city, from job to job, to stay one step ahead of him.\n\nDaniel Woodsman is at home in the dark; in the abandoned railway tunnels below the city where the homeless veteran has built his life since his injuries had taken away more than just his confidence.\n\nFleeing the Suits dispatched by her husband to bring her home, Cassie enters Daniel’s domain in the subway where their two worlds collide.\n\nTogether, can they stop running long enough to begin living again?\n\nMy Review.\n\nA fast-paced and immensely readable story that kept me hooked. The story is prefaced and concluded by a charming allegorical fairy-tale. Cassie is a totally relatable character, as is Daniel. He is both an enigmatic and interesting character who we gradually come to understand. There is enough gritty realism to make the story authentic. It makes one think about the fate of those veterans traumatised by their service. I was provided with a free copy of the book by the publisher but was not obligated to write a review.\n\nThe Witches of Wormwood Mysteries: Books 1 – 5 A thrilling and funny British witch cozy mystery series, packed with magic, cats, and murder! Perfect for fans of Agatha Raisin and Amanda M. Lee.\n\nNot many people move to Wormwood. The witches aren’t welcoming.\n\nThe fortune tellers are frauds. And the recent murder is only going to make things worse.\n\nHazel Salem just wanted a story for her magazine. Instead, she finds herself at the centre of an investigation that’s about to turn into a witch hunt.\n\nIf someone doesn’t solve this murder – and fast – it will be out of the cauldron and into the fire for Wormwood’s witches.\n\nAlthough I bought this as a boxed set I will be reviewing the books individually.\n\nMandrake And Murder by Silver Nord.\n\nMy Review. Hazel has returned to Wormwood, after the death of her mother to run the failing apothecary shop. Profits are abysmal and so is her reputation. Wormwood is a community divided between those who are magical and ordinary folk who have no idea that anything is unusual. Hazel senses she is an object of scorn as a supposed witch who can’t do magic. Two women who say they are her aunts arrive and reassure her that late-blooming magic could be powerful. When Wormwood has a murder, the first in hundred years everyone in town magical or not is on edge. To make matter worse there are some clues that it could be concerned with magic. Hazel hits on the idea of producing a free local magazine. It’s the perfect opportunity for her to ask questions. D.C. I. Admiral is also investigating and despite an initial speak between them, he doesn’t require any help. Jealously, fake fortune-tellers and hexes add to the fun.\n\nVervain and a Victim by Silver Nord.\n\nA cauldron, a coin, and a corpse.\n\nThree things that don’t belong in the woods.\n\nThe man standing over the body shouldn’t be there either, but when Hazel finds him with the victim, she suspects she’s already found the killer.\n\nThe only thing that keeps the prime suspect from being arrested is the absence of a murder weapon and a motive.\n\nBut in a town as weird as Wormwood, a motive for murder is only one dark secret away.\n\nMy Review. Wormwood hasn’t wholeheartedly welcomed Hazel. Although she is invited to join the coven, she suspects they are simply curious about her magical abilities. Her nemesis Natalia Gould is openly hostile. Another problem is she has now got a fake boyfriend, putting her at odds with his admirers. Her cat Hemlock seems to despise her and Jesse Heathen, the supposed detective has tried to charm her. All while murder has shaken the town and there is talk of vampires, the enemies of witches being seen in Wormwood. More fun and suspense, developing relationships and unanswered questions.\n\nSharing is caring.\n\nLike Loading...\n\nAnna ,thank you for joining us today. It’s shame that your tour of South Western Australia was cancelled, but it has given you the time to answer some questions for us. Anna is usually incredibly busy, and I know that her talks are very well attended\n\nWhat do you like to do when you are not writing?\n\nRead books, chat to my lovely husband, spend time with friends, watch TV.\n\nWhat did you want to be when you grew up?\n\nFrom the age of 10 when I figured out some people earned their living by writing stories, that’s what I wanted to do.\n\nWhat’s for dinner tonight? What would you rather be eating?\n\nLeftovers and salad bits as we had lunch at our daughter’s cafe. I’m rather apprehensive of eating different things as I have several severe food intolerance’s. One of my favourites is curry and we’re lucky to have an Indian restaurant reasonably close to home which understands gluten free needs and avoids cross-contamination.\n\nYour hero?\n\nMy husband. He’s a wonderful man, kind to everyone he meets and has been so supportive of me in my career. Also, he’s just – gorgeous!\n\nSigh, what a marvellous tribute, but he’s equally lucky to have you.\n\nIf you could choose three people to invite for a dinner party, who would they be and why?\n\nVarious friends whom we’ve known for decades. No one famous springs to mind.\n\nNow to questions about writing .What time of the day do you usually write?\n\nAll the hours I can! It’s my favourite activity. I don’t have the housework gene.\n\nWhat is the most difficult part about writing for you?\n\nI don’t find it difficult, but some stories are easier to write than others, I must admit.\n\nWhat is your work schedule like when you are writing?\n\nI’m always writing. I work 7 days if I have nothing else on but take days off if I want to do something else.\n\nWhat would you say is your most interesting writing quirk?\n\nStanding stock still, going glassy eyed (my husband tells me) and getting ideas either for new stories or ongoing scenes.\n\nDo you hear from your readers much? What do they say?\n\nI hear from readers a lot and love it. I have such nice readers.\n\nDo you have a favourite character that you have written? If so, who? And what makes them so special?\n\nBram, in the Traders series. He’s medium height, not good looking and yet he’s a kind, lovely man, my very favourite hero.\n\nThe Traders Series is five books it starts with The Traders Wife,the The Traders Sister,The Traders Dream,The Traders Gift and finally The Traders Reward\n\nSet in Singapore and Western Australia in the 1860s. New set of main characters, but some links with characters from the Swan River Saga\n\nDo you think someone could be a writer if they don’t feel emotions?\n\nThey could write non-fiction, I suppose. I think emotions are necessary to write good fiction and touch readers’ hearts.\n\nYou’ve written contemporary and historical fiction. Do you have a preference?\n\nI’ve also written fantasy and romances. I like writing them all but there isn’t time to do that, so I’ve stuck to what I call ‘relationships stories’ both historical and contemporary. I don’t have a preference. What I enjoy and need is the variety.\n\nAnna has written over eighty books- now that’s variety.\n\nHow do you decide whether it will be a book series or a stand alone?\n\nI only write series these days because readers prefer them, and to tell you the truth, I like to find out what happens to my characters from one story. So they have walk-on roles in the rest of a series.\n\nWhich comes first for you, the place to the character?\n\nRe place or character, neither, really. The setup scenario comes first – not the place necessarily, but a very rough and minimal concept of whatever is happening or about to happen. Then I start work on putting the character into that situation and things start to take on life.\n\nSo,you think of a situation ( for example this horrid virus right now) and the think who would be involved and where?\n\nExactly. And the character is like the yeast in a loaf, makes the situation come to life.\n\nBest writing advice?\n\nIf you’re just beginning, write a story, polish then set it aside for at least a year and write another story. Writing one story doesn’t usually teach a person to write professionally. And do not rush to self-publish too early on, either, for the same reason. A goldsmith wouldn’t expect to sell the first piece he made, nor should a writer – well, not until it’s been re-polished thoroughly and other stories written.\n\nThat is good advice, we all know that this takes time but we are too impatient.\n\nWorst writing advice you ever received?\n\nPlan your story ahead. I can’t and trying only give me a boring outline of a story that will never work. It’s when my characters come to life in the setup stage that my stories come to life. Some writers can plan ahead and some can’t, some can half-plan. We’re all different. It’s the finished product that counts, not how you get there. If you need to stand on your head in a corner to write, do it. Whatever it takes.\n\nWhat was the best money you ever spent as a writer?\n\nBuying books by other authors – you can learn from them both what to do and what not to do. You need to read a lot to understand what makes good fiction. So anyone who wants to be a writer and doesn’t read doesn’t make me want to read their efforts.\n\nDo you have a favourite author and why?\n\nI have several favourite authors, but it was Georgette Heyer who inspired me to become a writer. And Anne McCaffrey who taught me to use my imagination as vividly as possible.\n\nWhat are you reading now?\n\nFrances Brody – the Body on the Train. She write Miss Marple-esque detective stories set in the 1920s which hang together well, with a central group of characters who also seem real.\n\nWhat books or authors have most influenced your own writing?\n\nGeorgette Heyer, CJ Cherryh, Nora Roberts, Robyn Carr, Angela Thirkell, Jean Stubbs, Jodi Thomas, Anne McCaffrey, Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury – and countless others. I read 3 novels a week, give or take and always have done.\n\nWho is the author you most admire in your genre?\n\nI’m not sure I quite fit into a genre. I get called a saga writer, but a very wise and experienced editor once said I fit squarely between sagas and straight historical novels. See the list of authors for my favourites.\n\nFavourite quote (doesn’t matter the source)\n\n“Writing a novel is hard work . . . You have to work long and hard even to produce a bad one. This may help explain why there are so many more bad amateur poets around than there are bad amateur novelists . . . any clown with a sharp pencil can write out a dozen lines of verse and call them a poem. Not just any clown can fill 200 pages with prose and call it a novel. Only the more determined clowns can get the job done . . . Let’s not kid ourselves. It does take self-discipline.” Lawrence Block “Writing the Novel” p11\n\nFavourite book/story you have read as an adult?\n\nAt 3 a week, I’ve loved thousands of books.\n\nFavourite book when you were a kid\n\nEnid Blyton’s Adventure series.\n\nWhat famous author do you wish would be your mentor?\n\nNone – not because I’m perfect, but because you learn most by doing i.e writing and by reading other authors’ work IMHO. Writing is something you DO not something you talk about, I think.\n\nAnna Jacobs: Historical stories: ‘Perfect Family’ , ‘A Daughter’s Journey’ (8/19), ‘A Widow’s Courage’ (4/20 Modern stories: ‘Bay Tree Cottage’, ‘Changing Lara’ , ‘Christmas in Peppercorn Street’ (10/19), ‘Finding Cassie’ (1/20)\n\nFind out more, including list of all books series at: http://www.annajacobs.com\n\nSharing is caring.\n\nLike Loading..."
