        "text": "REVIEW: Asolo Rep gets risqué with ’Yentl’\n\nThe Asolo Repertory Theatre pushes the envelope with its highly sexualized staging of “Yentl.”\n\nSuperb acting throughout carries the play. It’s frequently steamy on stage as the actors successfully sell the many, intricate modes of young lust. The welcome comedic elements are delivered with charming aplomb.\n\nA smart, fresh score by original “I Kissed a Girl” singer/songwriter Jill Sobule functions as wonderfully innovative Greek chorus. The songs are strongly performed by a band of mostly Asolo Conservatory students. While the sonics lean toward Old World folk, the lyrics give the play a winning, contemporary edge.\n\nThe play by Leah Napolin and Isaac Bashevis, based on Singer’s short story “Yentl The Yeshiva Boy,” begins with a young Jewish woman seeking to enjoy the same education as her male peers in 19th-century Eastern Europe.\n\nAfter her tutoring father dies, teenage girl Yentl (Hillary Clemens) dresses in his clothes and transforms herself into boy Anshel so she can continue studying Judaism.\n\nOlder student Avigdor (Andrew Carter) defends the effeminate Anshel and the two become best friends. Yentl falls in love with Avigdor while maintaining her masquerade, and the idea of his sexuality comes into question as they exchange romantic glances. The story takes its strangest turn when Yentl learns that Avigdor was rejected by bride-to-be Hadass (Gisela Chipe) and then marries her to bring the three into a love triangle. Yentl shares the marriage bed and takes Hadass’ virginity (a sheet is held up and crass comment made). Meanwhile, Avigdor marries pushy shopkeeper Pesha (Summer Dawn Wallace).\n\nClemens, who’s also great as May Daniels in Asolo Rep’s “Once in a Lifetime,” shines as the character who has “the soul of a man in the body of a woman.”\n\nThe plays ends with many questions regarding the future of the main characters, except for the nonconformist Yentl.\n\n- BRADENTON HERALD\n\nREVIEW: 'Yentl' offers sweetness and laughter with a modern twist at Asolo Rep\n\nGreenberg brings a loving feeling for the story in this energetic production\n\nThe Isaac Bashevis Singer story about “Yentl, the Yeshiva Boy” gets a modern make-over in the Asolo Repertory Theatre production that opened Friday night.\n\nSinger’s short story is about a headstrong Jewish girl living in Eastern Europe in the late 1800s. After her father’s death, she masquerades as a boy to continue studying the Torah because of religious laws preventing women from such activity. The charade, leads her into an unexpected love triangle with a fellow student, Avigdor, and the woman he loves, Hadass.\n\nGordon Greenberg’s charming production is not quite a musical, but a play with sweet, often quirky songs by Jill Sobule that comment on the story being told.\n\nGiving a new sound to \"Yentl\"\n\nSobule's songs have a quasi-Klezmer sound, as if they come from a bygone era filtered through more current styles. And they serve as a Greek (or is that Jewish?) chorus to comment on what’s happening. They work best in quieter ballads like \"Tomorrow is Breaking My Heart\" and \"One Kiss,\" written with Robin Eaton, and less so in the rowdier “My Sister My Bride,” performed in a broadly sensual style by the talented ensemble members who double as characters and musicians. Surprisingly, the songs function in a similar way to those heard in Barbra Streisand’s film version, where they served as internal musical monologues of the Yentl/Anshel character.\n\nThrough a lot of laughter, the production raises questions about how women in various cultures are banned from education, and the importance of pursuing your dreams at any cost, even if that means giving up on love. As much as Yentl may love Avigdor, she can’t see herself as a traditional wife. She must be on her own, to survive.\n\nGreenberg brings a loving feeling for the story in this energetic production, highlighted by an engaging performance by Hillary Clemens in the title role.\n\nShe is simultaneously boyish and feminine and conveys the deep passion that causes Yentl to throw aside centuries of Jewish law to better understand it. She is paired nicely with Andrew Carter, who is a caring, compassionate Avigdor, and Gisela Chipe, who is sweetly innocent as Hadass.\n\nThe story takes on a more broadly comic style with the supporting players, who include former Producing Artistic Director Howard Millman as Hadass’ lively father, opposite his real-life wife, Carolyn Michel, as an overly worried mother. She also gets laughs as Yachna, who runs a bathhouse for women. Most of the third-year class in the FSU/Asolo conservatory play numerous roles and instruments as they sing the songs and move set pieces on the attractive set by Brian Sidney Bembridge, dominated by a caged wall of books, inviting and forbidden at the same time.\n\nThe production does include a brief scene by a river with carefully staged full frontal male nudity, a rarity in the theater, but relevant to the story. It’s one of many scenes that Greenberg uses, along with the music, to link the past to the present.\n\n- SARASOTA HERALD TRIBUNE\n\nSongs in musical 'Vanities' add note of social context\n\nGreenberg's smoothly staged musical bridges the segues\n\nThe vanities of \"Vanities\" are on display in a new format to open TheatreWorks' 37th season. Jack Heifner's popular 1976 play, following the lives of three Texas cheerleaders into adulthood -- one of the longest running plays in off-Broadway history -- is now a musical. It also traces the women's lives right up to the present, which isn't a very good idea.\n\nThe world premiere of \"Vanities: A New Musical\" opened Saturday at the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts in a production that has New York aspirations all over it. Music and lyrics are by David Kirshenbaum, whose \"Summer of '42\" played TheatreWorks on its way to off-Broadway. Director Gordon Greenberg has New York credits (“Jacques Brel…”), as does choreographer Dan Knechtges (\"The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee\"), music director Carmel Dean (\"Spelling Bee\") and orchestrator Lynne Shankel (\"Altar Boyz\").\n\nThe performers are Broadway and national tour veterans. Megan Hilty, who plays Mary (the \"wild\" one), comes fresh from starring as Glinda in \"Wicked\" on Broadway. Leslie Kritzer (\"Hairspray,\" \"Urinetown\") plays the super-organized Kathy. Sarah Stiles (\"Spelling Bee\") is the simpleminded Joanne, who wants nothing more than domestic bliss. Set designer John Arnone began his Tony-winning career with the original production of \"Vanities.\"\n\nHeifner's book is, as expected, basically faithful to his play. It's the same three-scene format, with an added prologue (\"Hey There, Beautiful,\" sung by the teenagers at their vanities as they prep and primp for school) and epilogue, running a compact 100 minutes with no intermission.\n\nThe first scene, in a banner-strewn, rural Texas high school gym in November 1963, introduces the three self-absorbed cheerleaders practicing routines, discussing their popularity, eternal friendship and how to fend off their football team boyfriends' sexual demands, while planning social events and how to get into college without actually cracking a book. Their obliviousness to the outside world is comically betrayed by a major national event.\n\nSome of the satire has been cut to make room for the songs, which serve something of the same purpose in a more generic manner. They add social context, however, with Kirshenbaum drawing creatively on peppy, period girl-group and other pop-rock styles (and Knechtges on '60s dance moves), expertly handled by Dean's crack pit band and the three potent singers.\n\nKritzer's redheaded Kathy is the leader of the pack, organizing to maintain their popularity, even if it means fixing a vote. Stiles' Joanne, a prissy, self-absorbed brunette with a squeaky cute-girl voice, is the least intelligent and most judgmental (\"If I weren't a virgin, I'd hate myself\"). Hilty's blond, fun-loving Mary finds escape from her \"bar-hopping mom\" in the group and aches to leave the small town behind.\n\nGreenberg's smoothly staged musical bridges cover the segues, as the actors take turns changing time periods in Cathleen Edwards' brightly conceived costumes and Sharon Ridge's wigs. In 1968, the women gather in a kitschy sorority bedroom. Kathy is busy organizing events and the future of the sorority, but troubled by her lack of plans for life after college. Joanne is tactlessly puffed up about her impending wedding, her life's goal, especially given that Kathy's boyfriend has just married someone else.\n\nMary, adopting hippie fashions, doesn't care that much, having found she can have all the sex she wants on her own terms. She breezes in from an anti-war protest, on her way to a civil rights meeting, and sings of longing to get out of Texas and expand her horizons in a potent folk-rock blues with a hint of psychedelic electronics (\"Fly Into the Future\"). Oddly, the lyrics' celebration of her hedonistic freedom also deny her commitment to the causes she supposedly espouses.\n\nThe same contradictory fault line has always run through Mary in \"Vanities.\" It's most notable in the final, 1976 scene, set in Kathy's sumptuous Manhattan penthouse, when globe-trotting, man-hopping Mary has become a successful gallery owner with no apparent interest in art or anything much except her independence. Kathy has given up trying to plan her life, though Heifner leaves her bio unwritten. That gaping hole is made up for by the exposure of fissures in Joanne's marital bliss, dynamically expressed by Stiles in a solo trembling with angst beneath her smug superiority.\n\nThe open-ended ambiguity of the last scene was part of the play's appeal. But Heifner and Kirshenbaum take advantage of revisiting it for a \"Looking Good\" epilogue that brings the women's stories up to date in the three decades since. It's a feel-good, circle-of-life (\"a river that sweeps us along\") song crammed with experiences emblematic of the Boomer generation. But it cheapens the ending by letting the characters off easy. \"Vanity of vanities,\" as the Preacher saith, \"all is vanity.\"\n\nTalkin’ Broadway Regional Reviews: San Francisco\n\nAn Engaging Production of the Musical Vanities\n\nTheatreWorks is currently presenting the world premiere of David Kirshenbaum and Jack Heifner's coming of age musical, Vanities, at the Mountain View Performing Arts Center. Vanities is an impassioned musical featuring three of New York's most talented young singer-actresses. The musical is a bittersweet, snapshot-sharp chronicle of the lives of three small town Texas girls as they go from adolescence to adulthood.\n\nJack Heifner's original Vanities opened Off-Broadway at Westside Theatre on March 22, 1976, and featured a young Kathy Bates. The audience loved this heart-on-the-sleeve show so much that it ran 1,785 performances. HBO did a production in 1981 with Meredith Baxter, Shelley Hack and Annette O'Toole playing the three roles (never offered on DVD, unfortunately for the many fans of the fascinating play).\n\nDavid Kirshenbaum became interested in making a musical version about a year and a half ago. The composer convinced Jack Heifner to write the libretto, drawing from and expanding on his 1975 play. There were readings of the musical in October of 2005 at TheatreWorks in Palo Alto plus a reading in New York. There have been slight changes in the one hour and 40 minute intermissionless production since the readings. This production also tells what happened to the ladies after the 1970s in an epilogue. As Jack Heifner said in an interview with Kenneth Jones of Playbill, people have told him that they can't tell where his words stop and David's words start.\n\nDavid Kirshenbaum, who composed the music and lyrics for The Summer of '42, which also had its premiere at TheatreWorks five years ago, has written a score with a '60s pop feel that echoes the girl group songs of the era. There are snippets of rhythm and blues, a little Burt Bacharach, Carole King and Carly Simon in the melodies and lyrics. I even thought I heard a little of Sondheim in the song \"In the Same Place\" toward the end of the production.\n\nVanities opens on the fateful day of November 22, 1963 in a gymnasium in a small town high school somewhere in Texas. The three high school cheerleaders swear that they will always be together through thick and thin. Their world centers around their own activities as cheerleaders, being the head of dance committees, and of course boys. However, they won't let their boyfriends \"go too far.\" They don't even realize that on that day, the President of the United States has been gunned down on the streets of Dallas. They think it was the president of the school council.\n\nKathy (Leslie Kritzer) is the head cheerleader and the smartest one of the trio. She is a real go-getter who organizes school events and dances, and can make anything using chicken wire and Kleenex into a work of art for theme dances. Mary (Megan Hilty) is the fast one of the group who enjoys boys much too much. She has a boyfriend who is a football player and he gives her gifts like his football sweater for certain sexual favors. Joanne (Sarah Stiles) is something of a mousey air head who is very shy and upholds a very high moral ground with her boyfriend, Ted (we never see Ted, but he is central to the theme of the musical).\n\nThe musical follows the three girls to college where, during the spring of 1968, they are senior members of an exclusive sorority house. There are more serious issues going on in the world, including anti-Vietnam War movement. Mary joins the movement while Joanne, who is still going steady with high school boyfriend Ted, becomes a typical all American apple pie woman who wants to get married and have kids. Kathy becomes the person in the middle of any political discussion. You begin to see cracks in their relationship as they go their separate ways.\n\nThe third and final scene takes place in an upscale Manhattan penthouse where Kathy is mysteriously living with another person. Joanne has become a stay-at-home mom with her high school sweetheart, who seems to always stay at the office. We get the idea that Ted is one loose character who has had affairs with both of the other women. Joanne is raising three kids with a fourth one on the way and she takes to drinking away her problems.\n\nMary is a sophisticated person who owns a successful up market art gallery selling expensive porno items to shock people, like a six foot neon erection. After a few drinks, sparks fly in all directions as the women become something out of The Women.\n\nDirector Greenberg, who recently directed the Off-Broadway revival of Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris at the Zipper Theatre, has assembled a dynamic trio of young actresses. Each has a unique voice and they are a rich polyrhythmic trio when singing the girl trio songs. Sarah Stiles (Broadway's 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee and the national tour of Dr. Dolittle) as Joanne has a voice reminiscent of that of Kristin Chenoweth. She is snazzy in song \"In the Same Place\" in the last scene.\n\nMegan Hilty (Wicked on Broadway) as Mary has a vibrant voice, especially in the potent rendition of \"Fly into the Future.\" She belts out this song with great enthusiasm.\n\nLeslie Kritzer (Broadway's Hairspray and Off-Broadway's Bat Boy and The American Trailer Park Musical) as Kathy has feisty chops when singing \"Friendship Isn't What It Used To Be.\"\n\nCarmel Dean leads the ten piece orchestra for great backup of the '60s and '70s melodies. John Arnone has designed some very effective sets, from a high school gym look, to an oh-so-cute sorority house which has three beds that reflect the characters' style, to a distinguished patio in a luxurious penthouse in Manhattan. Dan Knechtges who choreographed Spelling Bee seems to have done similar things with the dances in the first scene in the gym.\n\nVanities is a wonderful chamber piece that shows the evolution of friendship and how nothing quite turns out the way we think as teenagers. Many who identify with these three women had friends like these when in high school. The whole musical is about friendship and how things change between friends as they get older.\n\nVanities plays at the Mountain View Center for Performing Arts, 500 Castro St, Mountain View through July 16th. Their next production will be Donald Margulies' Brooklyn Boy opening at the Lucie Stern Theatre, 1305 Middlefield, Palo Alto on July 19 and running through August 13th."
