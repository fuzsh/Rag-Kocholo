        "text": "Performing Arts\n\nIssue 479\n\nOver a century ago, the foment of achievement in musical theatre in Adelaide was due to remarkable, talented individuals who forged lasting partnerships: Jack Fewster and Tom King, along with Edith Aird, Kenneth Duffield and Dion Titheradge.\n\nAlthough their names are largely forgotten, their work is at the heart of the most audacious period of Australian musical theatre. Despite being constrained by the refinements of Adelaide society, they challenged, made fun of and critiqued the world they knew, sometimes subverting convention while entertaining enthusiastic audiences.\n\nThe century of creativity for Australian musicals began in 1920 at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Grote Street, then known as the Prince of Wales Theatre. It was a warm August evening when the audience witnessed the premiere of FFF, the first fully-fledged Australian musical. The strange title reflected the personality of its maverick creator, the bombastic Melbournian Clement John De Garis, who offered a prize to anyone who could correctly guess what ‘FFF’ stood for. No one ever did, but in the audience on opening night was the young Jack Fewster. Born in Adelaide in 1893, he was filled with creative drive and filled with a burning ambition to emulate the world’s greatest songwriter of the day, Irving Berlin, writing songs and musicals.\n\nFor Fewster, the experience of FFF triggered a decade of triumph. For De Garis, it triggered financial disaster, ending in tragedy. One cold winter’s morning in 1926, took his own life, leaving behind more than £420,000 in debts. His night of glory had come at a very high price and his greatest creative achievement – the score of FFF, the first Australian musical – was lost."
