FOLLOW THE FLEET: What J

A Dancing Star! <

Fred Astaire's unique personality

dominates the whole of the film. The 4

star has a role which is character <

comedy — rather than the lead in a <

; musical show. His oDening num- <

ber, "We Saw the Sea," is a gem of <

humor and skill. <

Based on a story that could stand '

. without music, "Follow the Fleet" fol- )

lows the fortunes of four young J

' people — during the time that the

navy is in port. As a sailor with a \

genius for enraging Ginger Rogers <

and for dancing, Astaire is a sheer <

joy. <

For Astaire alone Irving Berlin <

wrote "I'd Rather Lead a Band." This <

splendid novelty routine eclipses the <

"Top Hat, White Tie, and Tails" <

number. For Fred and Ginger arrive. <

"All My Eggs in One Basket," with

its clever foolery, and "Let's Face !

the Music and Dance," the haunting ,

climax to a grand show. <

Harriet Hilliard, an appealing new- <

comer reminiscent of Frances Lang- <

ford, and Randolph Scott, thawed by <

Astaire's influence to amusing confi- <

dence, accompany the pair through <

the story. '

R.K.O.-Radio, while mindful of the ,

down-to-earth plot, have contrived to ,

give "Follow the Fleet" the novel pro- ,

duction which Astaire demands. To ,

analyse Astaire's charm as a dancer 1

and a comedian would be superfluous 1

at this stage. One can only say that 1

he has never been more brilliant. 1

KING OF BURLESQUE: Not

a dull act in show.

The plot of this musical may have a

- familiar ring — but that does not mat

ter. Its dances, ensembles, and comedy

are its important features. In all

these variety numbers there is not

one dull act. And so, helped by skilled

1 direction. "King of Burlesaue" nrp-

sents richly enjoyable fare for a pub

lic in search of entertainment.

One of the spectacles succeeds in

bringing novelty to the musical screen.

It is the trapeze ballet, performing

novel evolutions above the audience

in the fllm.

Warner Baxter's title role forces him

to fall in love with Mona Barrie — an

unpleasant aristocrat. When Mona

and the Broadway show-business fail

Baxter, Alice Faye steps in to rescue

him. Under the circumstances, Baxter

does as well as any actor could do.

Each member of the supporting

company gives a good account of him

self — and Jack Oakie, who extracts

every ounce of comedy from his part,

ranks with the three principals.

Others in the cast: Arline Judge, Gregory

RatoiT, Dixie Dunbar, Fats Waller, Nick

Long, jr. Fox picture. At the Capitol.

THE PERFECT GENTLEMAN :

With an Imperfect Lady

Elaborately groomed and polished,

Cicely Courtneidge makes her first

American film. It is obviously her

last. Out of its proper setting, the

English comedian's humor has an old-

fashioned tang. Only in the story's

serious moments does Cicely register

charm.

With deference to its visiting star,

M.G.M. presents a sentimental comedy

by Cosmo Hamilton. Frank Morgan,

as one of that author's ripe old Army

majors, walks away with the fllm. His

performance, for heart - warming

laughter and pathos, ranks among his

best.

In a painstakingly accurate English

atmosphere, Cicely appears as a

music-hall star, and Morgan by a

series of whimsical happenings be

comes her partner. A great shock to

the clergy and county. Henry Stephen

son, as the bishop, is the best of the

supporting cast.

Heather Angel, Una O'Connor, Richard War

ing, Forrester Harvey, Mary Forbes, Doris

Lloyd. M.G.M. picture. At the St. James.

'LOVE BEFORE BREAKFAST:

Serves laughter cocktail.

Here is an exhilarating piece of

entertainment. Modern, saucy, and

occasionally boisterous, it allows

Carole Lombard, as in "20th Cen

tury," to be a grand comedian. She

plays a minx to the hilt.

Walter Lang, the director, revels in

the sophisticated absurdity of his

plot. With just the tang for modem

palates, the romance between Carole

and Preston Foster is a series of sur

prise situations. To detail them

would spoil the laughter. Here is a

film not to be dissected, but to be

thoroughly enjoyed.

Janet Beecher, in the role of

Carole's quizzical mother, contributes

an excellent piece of dry humor. Cesar

Romero, as Carole's unfortunate

fiance, shows that he can look fool

ish and be entertaining.

"Love Before Breakfast" has two

surprises — Preston Foster's engaging

ease in a worldly role; and the glit

tering polish, unusual to this studio,

of the whole production.

Others in the cast: Betty Lawford,

Richard Carle, Douglas Blackley, Don Briggs,

Andre Beranger, Ed Barton. Universal pic

ture. At the Plaza.

ucaiKc: t-,omeay casrie in

Spain.

It has become a cliche to talk

about the "Lubitsch touch." But since

this producer's delicately impertinent

wit enlivens the whole of "Desire," it

must be given full credit again.

Marlene Dietrich has become

human. There are still traces of the

slow photographic poses which

marked her work for Von Sternberg.

But as the film progresses Marlene's

appearance becomes simpler and more

lovely. The star reveals the comedy

skill which made her a Continental

star.

She is certainly a lovely creature,

most amusing in the famous dinner-

table scene. It is not her fault, but

rather Gary Cooper's merit, that as

an entertainer, and a light comedian,

he takes the picture. An irresistible

performance.

John Halliday makes the third in a

romantic comedy — spiced with sus

pense. For Marlene is a jewel thief,

fleeing from Paris to Spain; Cooper

is the gauche young American who

blunders into Halliday's plans.

Suavely presented, "Desire" is

charming entertainment.

Others in the cast: Alan Mowbray. Akim

Tamlroff, William Frawley, Ernest Cossat.

"A NIGHT AT THE OPERA":

Full Marx for Comedy.

M.-G.-M. has altered its motto for

this film. "Marx Gratia Marxes"

appears round Leo's head. Appro

priate enough; since the three bro- J

thers take complete charge of the f

screen. '

All those who relish the wild Marx

brand of comedy will find this their

best fllm. Their eccentric adven

tures from Milan to New York con

tain such notable scenes as that in

Groucho's cabin; the impersonation )

of the foreign aviators; the disrup-

tion of the opera orchestra; and the

final, breathless sequences, in which

they take charge of "H Trovatore" as

well. Here is clever material for

nnnnlnv ltmrrVifc»v

Intermingled with their original

antics are some really fine playing by

Harpo and Groucho — a feature sadly

missed in their last picture. Hie

direction and presentation of tflie

whole insane adventure is skilfully

keyed to the Marx personalities.

That charming actress, Kitty Car

lisle, and Allan Jones, newcomer

with attraction and a fine voice, con

trive to sing and be romantic in ithe

middle of all the uproar.
