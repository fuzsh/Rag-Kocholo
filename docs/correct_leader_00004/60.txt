Full Name: John Sparrow David Thompson

Profession: 4th Prime Minister of Canada

Biography: John Thompson was a Canadian lawyer and politician who served as the fourth Prime Minister of Canada, holding office from December 5, 1892, until his untimely death in 1894. Thompson was a lawyer by profession and entered politics in his native province before moving to the federal stage. He was also the first Roman Catholic to hold the office of Canadian Prime Minister.

Thompson's entry into federal politics was marked by his appointment as Minister of Justice under Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald in 1885. In this role, he was renowned for his legal expertise and played a key part in the drafting of the Criminal Code of Canada, an achievement which solidified his reputation as a skilled legislator.

Following the death of Prime Minister John Abbott in 1892, Thompson was chosen as his successor, becoming the head of the Conservative government. His tenure as Prime Minister, although brief, was marked by his moderate and conciliatory approach to the contentious issues of the day.

Thompson handled the Manitoba Schools Question, for instance, which involved disputes over the funding and control of Catholic and Protestant schools in Manitoba. He sought a balanced approach to protect minority rights while respecting provincial jurisdiction, demonstrating his commitment to federalism and the delicate balance of Canadian confederation.

Despite his political acumen, Thompson's time as Prime Minister was cut short by his sudden death at the age of 49. He passed away from a heart attack at Windsor Castle in England, after being admitted to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, an honor indicating the high regard in which he was held.

Thompson's death marked the second time a Canadian prime minister died in office, after his mentor Macdonald suffered the same fate in 1891. Thompson was the first Canadian prime minister to be honored with a state funeral in the United Kingdom.
