He served as Prime Minister of Canada from December 5, 1892 until his sudden death in office on December 12, 1894.\n\nWaymark Code: WMK3WE\n\nLocation: Nova Scotia, Canada\n\nViews: 12\n\nSir John Sparrow David Thompson is buried here. He served as Prime Minister of Canada from December 5, 1892 until his sudden death in office on December 12, 1894.\n\nBesides being the fourth Prime Minister of Canada, Thompson also served as the fifth Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia. He was a lawyer, judge, and university professor who founded Dalhousie University's law school.\n\nThompson successfully defended the government in various politico-religious controversies, including reactions to the 1885 execution of Louis Riel, to the Jesuits’ Estates Act (1888–89), and to the subordination of the French language. In 1888 he helped arrange a fisheries treaty between Great Britain and the United States, and for this work he was knighted (1888).\n\nThompson died in office from a heart attack at the age of 49. He was on a visit to the United Kingdom at the time and was at Windsor Castle when the heart attack struck. Only minutes before his death Queen Victoria made him a member of her Privy Council. After an elaborate funeral was staged for him by Queen Victoria, Thompson's remains were transported back to Canada aboard the armoured cruiser HMS Blenheim, which was painted black for the occasion. He was buried on January 3, 1895.\n\nCanadian artist Frederick Bell-Smith witnessed the arrival of the Blenheim and was inspired to paint three scenes concerning the death of Thompson. One, The Arrival of the Blenheim, was destroyed in the House of Commons fire of 1916. The other two, The State Funeral and The Queen's Tribute, have been restored by the National Archives.\n\nDescription:\n\nBesides being the fourth Prime Minister of Canada, Thompson also served as the fifth Premier of the Province of Nova Scotia.
