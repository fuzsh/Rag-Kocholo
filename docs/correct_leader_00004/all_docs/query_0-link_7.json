He served as the fifth premier of Nova Scotia and, later, was appointed a Supreme Court Justice. He was key in establishing the Dalhousie Law school and also taught there for several years before becoming involved in federal politics.\n\nAt the time of the 1871 Canada Census, John S and Annie Thompson were listed as living in Halifax, along with John's widowed mother Charlotte Thompson and sister Elizabeth Thompson[2]. At the time of the census, John's occupation was listed as \"Lawyer\".\n\nAt the time of the 1881 Canada Census, John S., Annie, John T., Joseph, Mary A., and Leanor Thompson (enumerated as \"Thomson\") were listed as living in Halifax, along with a cook[3].

Thompson became the fourth Prime Minister of Canada serving from December 5, 1892 until his death in office on December 12, 1894. He was one of the key drivers behind the Canadian Criminal Code.
