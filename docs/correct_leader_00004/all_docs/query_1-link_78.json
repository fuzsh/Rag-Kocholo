        "text": "Benji B\n\nAll I can say simply is that it gives me absolutely great pleasure to welcome Mr. Nile Rodgers. (applause)\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThank you, Benji.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo my thanks on behalf of everybody in this room for taking the time out to talk to us today, we all really appreciate it. And we all had a great time at the gig last night, right? (Subdued response)\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nEr, what was that? Ha, ha. (Applause) I had a fantastic time last night, it was amazing. I played the night before in Manchester and literally one hour after the gig we were at the airport. So we had no sleep. Well, I slept on the plane. But to come out and play for the audience was fantastic. It was exhilarating and exactly what we needed.\n\nBenji B\n\nIâm pretty sure there can be no one thatâs kind of musically aware who hasnât come into contact with one of your productions, one of your songs, one of your records. So, with that said we have a great deal to cover today and weâre going to fit as much as we can into two hours. Having read your book and having been a fan of your music for so long, I think in this case it is relevant to start at the beginning. As much as I like to weave my way around, in this case itâd be good to start from an early age. You didnât have what we think of as a conventional upbringing, did you?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nIt depends who you hang out with. In my world it was completely normal. My family, everybody in my immediate area, all the adults, were all heroin addicts. My biological father, my stepfather, my mother eventually became one, friends, just everybody. Thatâs just the environment. What happened in America in the â50s, heroin became some sort of chic drug in the ghetto. Prior to that people were just getting booze and marijuana â marijuana was sort of sexy â but heroin put you on another level, I guess socially maybe. So the concept of being a junkie must have been pretty cool, because my parents are pretty cool and they wouldnât do shit that wasnât cool (laughs). So I guess they chose heroin because it was the thing to do. I donât really judge them for their drug usage, but the only problem is that heroin eventually made them a little more self-centred than normal parents, because the act of procuring the drugs took so much time, it wasnât like running down to the liquor store and buying booze. You got to go cop, cook it up, prepare it. The ritual of drug use was serious.\n\nBenji B\n\nAnd the reason that dovetails into our conversation about music so significantly is because of the sort of people whoâd be around that scene and the kind of music theyâd be into and bring into your life. Do you want to talk about that and the beatnik scene that was around in the late â50s in America?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nMy mom and dad, eventually, to supply themselves, wound up dealing drugs. Once youâre a dealer you start getting interesting clients. A lot of famous jazz musicians would come to our house on a regular basis. I saw very famous people, which I didnât know were famous at that time. I thought they were just coming to cop. But our house was a hotbed of artistic activity. A lot of artists, a lot writers, a lot of musicians and everybody was cool. Everybody spoke like, (affects hip accent) âHey my man, whatâs happening? Dig yourself. Well, look here baby, everything is not copasetic, you know what Iâm sayinâ? My man, little Nile, come here for a minute.â Iâm like four years old, thatâs how theyâd talk to me. I was four years old and theyâd never say, âDonât do that.â It was, âMy man, come here young blood. Dig yourself.â That meant, âWeâre not going to discipline you. You need to look into yourself, be introspective.â Oh, right.\n\nBenji B\n\nWhat kind of music was surrounding you at this point?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nJazz, modern jazz. It was interesting. There was a difference between commercial jazz and modern jazz, especially in my household. My parents like the commercial stuff. They were into that and loved to go to the theatre. But they also loved bebop and avant-garde. I guess it depended on the time of day. Daytime theyâd listen to Mel TormÃ©, stuff like that, but at night it turned into [Thelonious] Monk, Miles [Davis], Bird [Charlie Parker] and Dizz[ie Gillespie], hard bebop. So at night on the nod it was (imitates jazz solo, swaying). Thatâs just how it was and it was not peculiar. When you read my book, the reason Iâm very romantic about them is because they were great, they really were great. From the standpoint of regular Americana, what you saw on TV, they were definitely not like that. But it was the only existence I knew and it was wonderful and interesting and inspirational, totally inspiring.\n\nBenji B\n\nDo you want to talk a bit about your stepfather, the man who raised you? He would go on to have quite an effect in your interpretation of the world, and in many ways he was an OG hipster.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nMy stepfather is white and uh â (gesturing) woo! â in those days that was a big deal. I didnât know it was a big deal because he was just Bobby to me. The reason I called my father Bobby is that I called my mother Beverly. I called every adult that I knew by their first name. He was my friend, even though he was my stepfather; all the adults around me were my buddies. We knew lots of Bobbys, but because my father was white they called him White Bobby, so I called him White Bobby (laughter). But I didnât think of it as, âHey, Bobby the white man, moving into my crib, fucking up myâ¦â It was just White Bobby, like there was Black Bobby, Gay Bobby and so-and-so Bobby.\n\nOne day I went to school, eight years old, and Iâm in a classroom, a big classroom, and we lived in a part of New York City called Alphabet City. When my parents couldnât afford the West Village we moved to the East Village. I heard all the kids in the classroom going, âOh, shit! His fatherâs white. Oh, shit! His fatherâs white.â I didnât know that was a bad thing until I felt the kids, who were predominantly Puerto Rican, finding it uncomfortable. I didnât know what the problem was, but there was clearly a problem at that point for them.\n\nThat was around the time my book starts to pick up. Thatâs when my father had his first overdose, Thanksgiving Day, which is a holiday. I donât know what the hell it represents, but what they tell us is the Americans, the English settlers, made friends with the Native American people and they all ate dinner together. I was like, yeah, right. Half the people were dead from flu and stuff. Whatever, itâs a very jovial, celebratory American holiday. But in my life, Thanksgiving wound up being tragic, and from that first overdose our lives spiralled out of control. I basically became an adult. I became responsible for myâ¦ sometimes everything. Responsible for my own food, my own education, travel.\n\nLet me just say one thing that predates this event. I was born very sickly, so I was put in a convalescent home when I was young, because I used to live in oxygen tents. I had asthma. When I moved to this childrenâs home for about five or six months, they had a very robust early childhood development program. So I learned to read at an eighth-grade level, far above children at my level. When I got home I could navigate through the waters of adulthood. Does everybody understand what Iâm talking about? Does everybody speak English in here? OK, cool. So I was not vulnerable to the things that a lot of other six-year-olds were vulnerable to, because I could read. I could understand complicated polysyllabic words and I could understand compound thoughts. It wasnât just, âDonât do that.â It was, âWhy not? I saw you do it.â âWell, weâre an adult.â âReally? So you mean to tell me itâs less dangerous for you than it is for me?â Uh-oh! So that was my childhood. People took that as me being rebellious but in fact I was just trying to learn. If I see you doing something, why canât I do it? This is to help you get to the fact that I started doing drugs myself at 11 years old. It worked for them, I thought it would work for me too.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo as the sort of âkidultâ that you become, youâre a native New Yorker, right? But is it fair to say you lived a kind of bi-coastal existence when you were young, so you had experience of both New York and the West Coast?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nCorrecto! My mother, when she had her second childâ¦ my mom had three coathanger abortions, which were very dangerous. She almost died twice. I guess she decided to have a child finally, so she had my brother six years later. She started suffering from post-partum depression where she threatened to kill my little brother every day because he couldnât stop crying. The doctor told her that she wasnât fit to raise children, so I was shipped off to California to live with her mother, while she went to a mental hospital. She wasnât incarcerated, but she went to a psychiatrist every day. That was my first trip to Los Angeles.\n\nBenji B\n\nThis is early â60s, right?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThat was even older than that. That was 1959, just.\n\nBenji B\n\nCould you paint us a picture of what New York, what Manhattan and LA felt like that at that time, culturally, musically, anything really?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nHe did read the book! The deal is that when we left New York, we took the bus all the way to Los Angeles, about 3,000 miles, long trip. And when we arrived we were in downtown LA, which looks very much like New York. In my childâs mind I thought we just drove around for a long time and wound up in the same place. Maybe we just came in through the back door or something, the stage entrance to the bus terminal. Once we left the bus terminal, I noticed it was very different to New York in that we had a very powerful Latin American, Mexican influence. Everything was (adopts Hispanic accent), âOvera, Figeruoa, blah-blah-blah.â I was like, âDamn!â In New York we have Puerto Ricans but they were only in the movie West Side Story or in my family. They didnât have things named â now itâs Munoz Boulevard and blah, blah, blah, but then nothing was named after Puerto Rican or Latin American things in New York City. But in Los Angeles, everything was. We even had a place called Santa Ana. In my childhood memory he was the villain of America, he fought Davy Crockett, but in LAâ¦! So in my childhood analytical brain, I was like, wow, California is cool. They celebrate criminals, itâs fantastic, they name streets and towns after them. When youâre a child and youâre analyzing things, theyâre very black and white â not to make a joke, but itâs, âThis is this and that is that,â and the grey areas are not that clear yet.\n\nSo LA felt like you could just do whatever you wanted to do because they sanctioned it. I went pretty crazy because that year Iâd just turned seven. So at that point it was, still 1959. So at seven years old I set the national truancy record for the United States. I went to a Catholic school because my grandmother was super Catholic, and I cut school 75 days in a row. I thought they were going to give me a plaque because I figured out how to do it. We used to have derelicts, winos, whoâd hang out, and in Los Angeles they have liquor stores, a special store to buy liquor, and it was right across the street from my house. The winos would sit outside and ask for money. And when you go a Catholic school, every day you have money to give to the church. I gave the money to the winos and they would write letters for me, âPlease excuse Nile because his asthmaâ¦â For 75 days I got away with this.\n\nBenji B\n\nDid you fall in love with music during those 75 days or had that romance already started for you?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe music love had already started, but the real love was with cinema, with movies and television. I found I could learn at a much faster rate by watching films, much faster than in a classroom, which was sizeable, probably half the number of people in this room. Our classrooms were really big and we only had one teacher. But you go to the movies and youâre seeing [Federico] Fellini. There were no ratings then so a child could see any film they wanted to see. If you didnât understand it, too bad. But if you stayed there, because they didnât turn the movies over in those days, you could sit there and watch the same movies all the time. In Los Angeles they had what they called the grindhouse format, which was four or five [movies], so I could sit there all day long and finally youâd learn a little Italian, Spanish, French, because they had the subtitles. So you had a film called La Dolce Vita. âOK cool, let me go and see that.â You learned about [Marcello] Mastroianni, [Michelangelo] Antonioni]. The next thing I knew I was kind of smart, I guess. I was only eight years old and knew everything â or at least a lot about varied subjects.\n\nWhen it came to music, I just adored it. My father was a professional percussionist and as a result of the Latin music boom in America, he played with a lot of the big bands, because they started having a Latin influence. If you couple that with the beatnik culture, that was the beginning of the beat poetry, and they always had someone playing bongos. I like to think they were super-intellectual, but a lot of the time it just sounded ridiculous to me. So the great thing about early beat poetry, the profundity of absurd subject matter was so interesting. Like, they could say, (affects beatnik voice) âMy man with the red shoes. Oh, red, like a bed.â And my dad would be going (mimics playing bongos). âRed is dead, the shoes, the bed.â It didnât rhyme like that but you know what Iâm saying. More like, âRe-e-e-e-e-ed.â (Mimics bongo playing) âThe color of my be-e-e-e-e-ed. What I said, the people, the thing.â And Iâd be looking at them going, âAre you kidding me? You can get a job doing that?â (Laughter) But that was my world and that was life and it was wonderful to me.\n\nBenji B\n\nIt seems like you can talk about the beatniks, beat poet generation, the Motown â60s generation â obviously, weâll get to the â70s and â80s â but it feels that your existence in New York and in LA as a young person gave you the launchpad to be able to throw yourself into show business in such a rounded way. Is that a fair thing to say?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nLet me try and speed up. After I ditched school for 75 days they shipped me back to my mother. At that point she had been cool. The doctor says, âOK, you can have kids now.â So my mom had a third child, but instead of raising that child she gave that child to her aunt. So I have a brother thatâs really never been raised in our family. When I came back to New York I just became completely inundated with culture, with music, with learning, and I started playing in the school orchestras. And because I was always the last kid to enrol, the school orchestras would just assign you whatever instrument was lacking because no one could really play. Can you remember what eight-year-old bands used to sound like? What difference does it make? âGive this dude a tuba.â âBut Iâm all skinny.â âThatâs it, youâre playing the sousaphone.â And itâs just (makes horrible noise) Everything was quarter notes and then a rest or something. Really simple stuff. But it was fun. I loved the camaraderie of playing in bands and orchestras, moving from place to place. That was the one thing that allowed me to fit in, no matter where I went. We all stank together and it was very inspiring.\n\nBut then I moved back to Los Angeles and thatâs when things started to change for me dramatically. At that point my mom had yet another kid, so I moved back to LA with her because she was a heroin addict at that point, full day user, and she tried to kick. So she kicked on the bus, we get to LA, she moves back, now Iâm by myself with her, with my grandparents. My grandmother had a boyfriend who worked at a very high-end airport. At that airport was Frank Sinatra, Ray Charles, Elvis Presley. These are the kind of people whoâd fly in every day, and because I was the only kid working there â I donât know what the child labor laws were like, but kids had jobs when I was a kid. You couldnât live without a job. And the cool thing about a kidâs job was you got to keep all your money (laughs). I worked at the airport, which was fantastic and all these people in showbusiness were generous as hell. This was probably the first time that being black had a huge advantage, because I stood out. I walked up to people and everybody was cool to me. âHey kid, hereâs five dollars. Wash the plane, clean the windshield.â And everybody was generous. Frank Sinatra was an incredible tipper. Heâd (reaches into pocket), pfff! $50, I could go buy the world.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo was this your first encounter with celebrity?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nNo, because they were around me all during my childhood when my parents were drug dealing. But this was my first encounter when I knew that they were stars. When I was younger, they were just people coming over to buy drugs or something. Or trade, barter. But when I worked at the airport I was 11, 12, 13 years old. I had seen all these people in movies. Imagine Ginger Rogers coming up to you and youâre like, âDamn, do that song.â They used to love the fact that I knew all their stuff. Itâs not in the book, because I didnât have time to go into it, but I remember having a conversation with Dean Martin and we were singing songs, lyrics from some obscure film. He was happy that I knew it. Itâs funny, big movie stars are just as fragile. You see them getting off a jet and you say, âI loved that movie, Three Sailors and a Girl.â âWow, you saw Three Sailors and a Girl?!â\n\nBenji B\n\nWhat was Frankâs jet like?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nFrankâs jet was a Learjet, and this was the early age of the private jet age. It was called the Christina II. I didnât even figure it out until I wrote this book â actually, truth is bro, I didnât figure it out until a couple of days ago when I was talking to a person. At the airport I was always, âWhere the hell is Christina I?â Christina I was his daughter! Damn it Nile, you idiot. The plane was called Christina II, but his daughter was Christina Sinatra, duh â Christina I. So I used to clean the Christina II and the tail number almost looked like my name, which was cool. Iâd stand to the side and pretend it was my jet. Nile on the Christina II. Fast-forward into the future and Quincy Jones was producing a Frank Sinatra record, and this was the early age of the Sony digital tape recorder and I was the only person in New York who owned one, and they had to rent it from me. I was like, âI got to go protect my machine,â but really I wanted to hang with Q and Frank. And I still called him Mr. Sinatra even though they were renting my shit. (Laughter) So I walked into the room and Iâm like, âMr. Sinatra.â âYes?â âIâm Pud,â which was my nickname. âPud?â âYeah, Pud from Van Nuys airport.â And he went, âOh my god!â\n\nIt was the most cool thing thatâs probably ever happened to me since Iâve been in the music business. They were just sitting there. When Frank Sinatraâs recording, everything has to be perfect. Heâs got to sing it right, the bandâs got to play it right. So the musicians loved it because if he made one mistake, theyâd get paid to do it again and again and again. There was no such thing as an overdub. I was watching Q going, âHey Frank, weâll just punch it in.â âPunch it in? Iâll punch you out.â (Laughter) He took pride in seeing that I grew up to be that guy whoâs in charge. And also to show how my life was really, really weird, it followed a pattern. Iâd have something really good happen, then something really bad would happen. Everything seems to be connected. So Christina Sinatra is the person who named the first band I was in with Bernard Edwards, called New York City, because she was married to the dude who owned the record label. She was looking at New York magazine or something like that, and even though it was a Philly-sounding band, she says, âHey, letâs call the group New York City.â And thatâs how we became the âBig Apple Bandâ which went on to become Chic.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo weâre in the â60s and youâve cleaned Frankâs jet and youâve spent some time in New York and LA and been around music. But tell me about developing your own musical tastes and getting into music that you loved yourself.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nI have to say primarily, I think of myself as a jazz person. Thatâs what I still play in my spare time. Rich will tell you, when Iâm around the house, youâll never hear me practising [Jimi] Hendrix or funk. I donât have to practise that, itâs in me now. Iâm a funk guy, I think like a funk guy. But what Iâd always practice â what we used to call woodshedding â because weâd sit around and go (pretends to play jazz). Sometimes I can get it that fast. But still Iâm a bebop guy and thatâs all what I want to play. A couple of weeks ago Rich and I were transcribing Eric Dolphy. Still, at this age! But when I met Bernard Edwards, thatâs when my life shifted. He and I were polar opposites. But from the first day we played together, we were never apart, ever. Even when we broke up and were all pissed off with each other, the way people get pissed off in Chic â at least me and Bernard â is (adopting angry voice) âMotherfucker, rah, rah, rah.â Then you call him: âHey man, you feel like going out?â âOK, cool.â And if Bernard heard somebody say something disparaging about me, heâd be, âI can say that shit, but you canât.â So we were always like this (holds fingers close).\n\nAnyway, when I met him we were on a pick-up gig, and in those days you basically did what was on the jukebox, whatever was hot. And in those days a lot of jazz records were popular in R&B settings. Freddie Hubbard had âRed Clay,â the Headhunters with Herbie Hancock. It was jazz artists on the R&B and dance charts. So we learned those songs. It would be, âWeâre doing âSong for My Father.â And right behind it would be âCissy Strutâ and right behind it would be âWhoâs Gonna Take the Weight.â Oops.(Takes phone out of pocket) Disregard my cell phone, Iâll turn it off after it stops.\n\nSo anyway I started to learn to love R&B because many of the gigs we did were primarily R&B gigs. Unfortunately all the jazz dudes, myself included, used to look on those gigs with a certain amount of disdain. We used to call them boogaloo gigs and boogaloo gigs wereâ¦ (looks at phone) Oh, come on already! Itâs my mom.\n\nBenji B\n\nHer ears were burning.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nI was hit by cancer about a year ago and now my mom calls me every day. Iâm like, âMom, alright already. They donât give you a test every day.â So what happened was we were doing a bunch of boogaloo gigs, the main one was with New York City, and somehow the opening act before us had lost all their equipment. The kid who was playing in the band before us played on my amplifier because his was stolen. Something miraculous happened that night. All along Bernard had been telling me to sell my big jazz guitar, which was feeding back and I had to play at low volumes. We didnât have the great soundmen that we have now. Usually, the sound onstage was what people heard in the audience. So I had to play quietly because my guitar was feeding back through these big amps, because we wanted to look like Sly and the Family Stone. Meanwhile I couldnât play at that volume. So this kid borrowed my amp and he was playing a Fender Strat and, damn, all of a sudden my amplifier sounded like the most incredible amplifier Iâd ever heard. And Bernard looked at me and said, âThatâs what Iâve been trying to tell you! Buy a Strat!â So I buy the Stratocaster and now it feels weird. The strings were light compared to my big, fat jazz guitar. But I got $300 back too â I traded my jazz guitar and got three bills. Man, this is cool.\n\nThen Bernard showed me the style of guitar playing that kid was playing, because we were playing some of the same songs but his playing sounded better than mine. And Bernard picked up the guitar and started chucking, playing the same songs weâd been playing, but now he showed me how to play them. I was like, âWow! Really?â Bernard was a regular guitar player â he was a good guitar player, but nothing spectacular â but he sounded better than me. The reason why was because he would hold the chord. Guitar players, usually when they know a chord, thatâs the chord. They know the E chord, they hold the E chord. Maybe they know another way of playing it, but thatâs it. And whenever they play a song itâs just the same thing over and over again, and thatâs what they call playing a song. When I play a song Iâm moving the chords all around and inverting it and voice leading and all this stuff. And when Bernard did that, just playing the song, it sounded more interesting. I noticed he was jumping around the strings â he would hold the position but then move all across the fingerboard (gesturing with right hand). I was, âDamn, if you can do that with one position, what would I be able to do? I can go anywhere up and down the neck and pick out random notes and just play the extensions, never touch the root or the fifth. What would I be able to do?â So I moved into the bathroom for about four or five days. The guy who was on the road with me had about a million girls coming in and out, so Iâd just stay in the bathroom and practice. And then about a week later I emerged as the guy that I am now, which is the funk guy who can play a bunch of chords and melodies at the same time.\n\nBenji B\n\nWe should make it clear that Bernard, your long-time musical partner, was a bass player.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nA genius bass player.\n\nBenji B\n\nAnd of course we all know that guitar is your weapon of choice. As a jazz person, when did you decide on the guitar?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe last time I moved back to New York was after my grandmother had died, I was about 15, 16 years old. I was playing the clarinet with the school orchestra. We sucked, but we played OK. We were just in junior high school. So I had gone out with my friends â we were still big glue sniffers. Iâm not sure Iâve mentioned that, but that was my drug of choice. I was a glue sniffer and we used to sniff amyl nitrate â that was heaven to us. The glue we paid for. The amyl nitrate weâd break into the school and get free. One day we were going to the skating rink in Los Angeles and we ran into these guys that were what people wound up calling hippies. But when we saw them we were like, âMan, weâve never seen guys look like you.â They had hair down in their faces. And they said that they were freaks. I was, âWow, freaks, cool. Iâm down with that.â And the freaks asked me and my boyâ¦ Now imagine this, we were 15-year-old kids and you know how when youâre kids you dress like the artist you idolize? I remember when Madonna hit, all these little girls were there with the rubber bracelets and they were like 10 years old. So we were that. We idolized the Temptations. We were 15 years old and we had sharkskin suits with ruffle shirts and French collars going to the skating rink. Fifteen years old and we were the shit. Then we met these freaks and we thought they looked weird and we can just imagine what they thought of us because we were clean.\n\nAnd they asked us if we wanted to take a trip. We said, âAbsolutely!â We had no idea they meant LSD, we thought they meant joyriding or something â thatâs what we did when we took a trip, went to the beach. So we went up to the Hollywood Hills and they gave us LSD. Woah! We didnât even know what LSD was. I didnât return home for two days. My sharkskin suit was all dirty and tattered and my rollerskates were all psychedelic and shit where girls had painted [on us], they were all, âOoh, spade cats with rollerskates and suits.â And they painted all over us and we were into it.\n\nSo Iâd left being completely into nothing but Motown and R&B and the deepest soul you could hear on the radio. When I came home I said to my grandmother â I was talking completely different in just two days, I was like (affects hippie accent), âOh Granny, wow, youâre hassling my head, man. Must you play the Mighty Sparrow again?â I donât think Mighty Sparrow was around, but she was into Caribbean music and gospel. âOh no, I must hear the Monkees. I have to hear Them and the Troggs.â\n\nMy grandmother died shortly after and I went back to New York to live with my mom. But before I got there I lived with my uncle and his girlfriend had a daughter who was the finest woman who ever walked this earth. And she had a band and the band didnât have a guitar player. So she says to me, âNile, we need a guitar player in our band. Do you think you could play it?â âOf course!â I had never touched a guitar in my life. But in the old school orchestra they just give you the instruments and say, âHere, play this.â And within a couple of weeks youâre... (makes horrible brass noise) But this band was actually pretty good and they wanted me to play guitar on that level. At the time I had been playing clarinet in the school orchestra and it has the same written range as the guitar, like a low E on the clarinet. I looked at the music and was, âIâve got this guitar shit covered!â So I looked at the music â I donât remember what song it was â but I couldnât figure it out to save my life. I embarrassed myself and the girl said something harsh to me, so I moved in with my mom. I couldnât even face her anymore. Then I kept practising. I bought a Beatles songbook. I couldnât get my clarinet etudes to speak properly. I was trying but it just didnât make sense. I looked at the fingering, wasnât working, something was wrong, so I bought a Beatles songbook, because (affects hippie voice) you know man, I was into the Beatles. And my favorite song was âA Day in the Lifeâ, and I kept playing it over and over again, and I had the fingering down, I memorized it, but it never sounded quite like a âDay in the Life,â it was weird.\n\nSo my motherâs boyfriend came over and he realized I had the guitar out of tune. I guess I missed that part â I went right to the songs, I tuned it to sound like a violin or something. So the dude tuned the guitar and after he tuned it, I played the exact same fingering Iâd been playing and it was heaven. It was euphoria. It was like the first time I ever got high or had sex. It was that level of unbelievable magic. And I played the chord and it was perfect. Then I attempted to sing because the lyrics were in the songbook, (sings) âI read the news today, oh boy, about a lucky man who made the grade.â And I was like (bobs from side to side) â I was so high. Obviously, it was really slow, like (sings slowly) âI readâ¦â But I got through the song and at that point I decided Iâd never play another instrument seriously again but the guitar. Iâm going to concentrate, stick to this thing, get it down, get it down. And thatâs when I became the jazz guy and blah blah, meet Bernard Edwards, blah, blah, buy a Strat, blah, blah, we get a record deal, first song we writeâ¦\n\nBenji B\n\nHold up, hold up. (Laughter) One thing we should talk about, you went to LA and you wonât be offended if I say you came back a bit of a hippie, right?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nOffended? I wear that like a big badge of courage.\n\nBenji B\n\nAnd whatâs interesting, you talk about the jazz heritage, being a big Temptations fan, being obsessed with that whole era. But when you met Bernard, you were actually the hippie and he was the R&B guy, is that right?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nCompletely, 100%. Bernard was so old-school R&B, he really fit in. I did not fit in. My first real job, where you get a paycheck and they take taxes out, was with Sesame Street. I got that gig because I just auditioned and got the gig. They didnât pay attention to the fact that I had green hair and cornrows and stuff like that, so when I undid the green cornrows I had this big green afro. It wasnât green like that (points to someone in the audience) because we didnât have green like that â we used food color, like something that would make your cupcakes green. Like on St. Patrickâs Day, (affects Irish accent), âAh, the cupcakes are green.â So weâd take that and put it in our hair for hours and hours and then it would be green. But my hair looked really black, but when you get in the light, âHoly shit, heâs got green hair.â So on Sesame Street that was sorta cool, they liked it. That was fantastic.\n\nAnd I only did that gig for a year because the guy who vacated it was Carlos Alomar and he went to play in the Apollo Theater house band. Then David Bowie hired him with my other buddies, Luther Vandross and those guys, and they became the Young Americans and there was an opening at the Apollo and I auditioned for that. Wasnât much of an audition. I was recommended by the woman from Sesame Street, whose husband was the manager of the Apollo Theater at that time. And I got the gig with the house band. It was Reuben Phillips and King Curtis would switch as the directors. And she told them that I was a really great guitarist and a fantastic reader. In those days at the Apollo Theater, you had to do two shows for certain and it may have even been [inaudible] and it would turn over like that. It was a revue format. Every now and then theyâd have one band that would do a bunch of songs, but typically, R&B, you have one-hit wonders, so a person would come out and do their one or two songs that were hits. All that the audience got were songs that were pretty familiar. Everybody had their little routine and shtick, but the band had to be ready for anything that was performed.\n\nBenji B\n\nAt this point had James Brown already recorded the Live at the Apollo record?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo when youâre walking into the Apollo on 125th Street, were you walking in with the pressure on your shoulders, knowing what amazing stuff had already been recorded there?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nNot only that. I had heard about Jimi Hendrix winning the talent show. First of all, donât get me wrong â even though I was a jazzy guy, everybody went to the Apollo every now and then. A lot of the bands I was playing with, that I subbed with, would wind up playing at the Apollo. So it wasnât like when I got the gig as the house band guy that Iâd never been to the Apollo. Luther Vandross was my friend and he took us there to see Patti LaBelle and The Bluebelles and I never saw anything like that. So it was our place to hang.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo youâd been in the audience section. It was famously a very unforgiving crowd that would go to the Apollo, they would not suffer fools gladly. So how did it feel when you walked out onstage and saw the unforgiving R&B thumbs-up, thumbs-down audience?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nI was lucky. The very first show I was onstage in the band, this is what happened to me. I get recommended by the woman from Sesame Street who says, âThis kidâs amazing, he can read anything thatâs put in front of him, blah, blah, blah.â So I go and do the audition and the audition was Betty Wrightâs âClean Up Womanâ, which is in F-sharp and itâs at least 15 or 16 pages long. You have to have three music stands taped together, keep pulling that shit. And itâs just vamping (sings a swung melody), but of course I play (sings same melody without the swing), because I didnât understand the R&B thing yet.\n\nBut you get the chart and they go, âAlright, two, threeââ (repeats the melody), and weâre jamming this. So the bandleader tells me I donât have to make the rest of the audition because, âWow, thatâs so incredible, you played âClean Up Womanâ for 13 pages â youâre the man!â So they let me go walking around Harlem and they told me to be back an hour before show time. At the Apollo â I donât know if they still do this, but theyâd go, âThe half is in.â Do they still do that? No, OK, thatâs old school. But theyâd go, âThe half is in,â and there was this klaxon (makes klaxon sound). âThe half is in, the half is in,â and weâd all run round, getting ready to play. Thereâs a couple of guitar players, Iâm sitting there and weâre waiting to go onstage and Iâm so focused because I want to do a great job. I know this is the Apollo. I donât want to lose this job, Iâm getting $375 a week, I need to do this.\n\nI didnât pay attention that theyâd rolled in a coffin on the side of the stage. Iâm looking at the conductor, he goes, âBang!â and as soon as he does that, this coffin opens and itâs Screaminâ Jay Hawkins. (Laughter) I donât know if youâve ever seen his routine, but he looks like a skeleton, heâs got this rattle in his hand. Iâm terrified. It happens on the downbeat. And weâre playing in 6/8, and then weâve got the pickup (screams). And I jump up and grab my guitar, take the cable out, and Iâm running around with my big jazz guitar across stage, and Screaminâ is running after me (gets up to run across the stage). And I run stage right but now theyâre blocking me, because all the people waiting to go on are standing there. And I run to the other side and the audience is crying because they know itâs totally real. (laughter) Meanwhile, the thing that made it funny to my friends is, at that time, I was a kung fu master, I was studying kung fu. And Iâm running across the stage like a total chump. The audience at the Apollo is crying with laughter when I come back. Screaminâ Jay just nailed the performance that night and at that point the old school guys in the band decided, âLetâs teach this young blood what itâs all about.â That was my first day. (Applause) Everybody had planned it, everybody was in on it. They couldnât have done it without a rehearsal, they just wanted to show me what the Apollo was like. Trial by fire.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo how do we go from that initiation experience to you starting your own band?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nAt that point, Iâd already been with Bernard Edwards and another guy named Harold Alexander and a guy named Gylan Kain who was in the Last Poets. So I was already gigging in New York and I had lots of other gigs, but I always tried to bring Bernard in. It just sounded better and he did the same thing.\n\nBenji B\n\nWhy was that? What was it about your relationship that made you click?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nWe wanted to be professional. In those days a lot of bands were sloppy and even though we were playing in the hood at dives, what we used to call the chitlinâ circuit, people expected a good show. We had to show up in a bar in the hood with uniforms and people had capes, like you see those people who jump off mountains and fly? I was in a band called the Metaphors and we had them back then, flying like bats. We did that because weâd get a little black light and these things were white underneath and you do the choreography (dances). And you went like that and the white things would be... Thatâs what they expected in the hood, in the ghetto. We were getting $15 a night and we had to do four or five sets. But they expected a show. Bernard and I always wanted to be good. A lot of the guys would just get through the show because they figured theyâd never be back, but Bernard and I had a powerful work ethic and we always wanted the shows to be great. If he didnât know something, I would tell him, and if I didnât know itâ¦ We were bandleaders and we didnât know it.\n\nBenji B\n\nItâs interesting because often the rhythm section, i.e. the drums and the bass, can be the heartbeat of the band. But itâs interesting for us to hear you talk about the relationship between lead guitar and bass and why that was such a solid relationship.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nItâs funny, I recently posted on my blog. I talk about it like everyone knows everything, but a year ago I was stricken with cancer and I didnât really know what to do. I was all paranoid. I tried to reach out to people but no one wanted to talk about it. So I started a daily blog, I figured if they were anonymous they would open up. It wound up becoming [about] everything I do every day. So a few weeks ago, a friend of mine I havenât seen for years found an early videotape of me and Bernard and the band that eventually became Chic. You could tell from that tape how we clicked. We carried this thing. We couldâve just been a trio. This other cat was really great, but there were five of us â two guitars, bass and drums and a lead singer. And when you hear the songs, I defy anyone to tell me it does not sound like Earth Wind & Fire, âGetawayâ with the horns and that. We didnât need horns, we had it in the parts and thatâs what people were used to in the hood. If it didnât sound like the record, you would get booed. It would have to go (imitates music) and everybody would learn the records and weâd do that, we were tight. Bernard and I were responsible for the melodic, the harmonic and the bass part. The drummers we figured would learn the grooves. We thought about everything as a duo, because if Bernard and I showed up, we got it covered. Weâve got the songs covered, the licks covered, all that stuff. And thatâs basically why we were so tight.\n\nBenji B\n\nAnd itâs interesting. Obviously, that will go on to be important with the grooves of Chic. You talking about performing just like the record, itâs sort of in conflict with your jazz roots of improvising and that freeness. Itâs interesting having the discipline to perform it exactly like it is on the record.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe truth is, yes, we perform exactly like the record, but not exactly, exactly, exactly. Enough that the people in the audience feel like theyâre hearing the song and theyâre not disappointed. Nowadays, when you go to a live show â I hate to say it â but in almost every case itâs exactly the record because theyâre just playing the damn record, and lip-synching and dancing and stuff, because thatâs what people have become accustomed to and hearing the thing sound exactly the same. So what we do, yeah, itâs the song, but weâre musicians so we want to have a good time. Itâs not like a symphony orchestra where they have to play the same thing. We do make it feel like the record, we fool around. But itâs not about us, itâs about you guys. We want to make you happy, but we canât make you happy over and over again if we donât feel good too.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo describe the scene, Bernard and how he looked and how you looked.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nWhen?\n\nBenji B\n\nWhen you met, when he was leaning to the slick R&B side and you were more to the hippie side.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe night we met I was wearing hand-embroidered jeans with patches on them â which Iâd done myself, I was all thrilled about it â gigantic bell-bottoms â I was the skinniest guy in the world â with a hip hugger so the zipper was just that long (makes tiny hand gesture), riding way low. Huge platform shoes because at that point I had done a bunch of gigs, I was making money, so I went out and bought these snakeskin platform shoes. I was like 6 foot 5. And Bernard on the other hand was wearing these knit shirts they used to wear back in the hood and silk trousers with flaps on the back from a joint in Harlem called Mr. Tonyâs, probably not open anymore, and wearing shoes called Playboys that looked like Hush Puppies, but with an extra-thick soul. The shirts were called Blyeâs, so he wore Blyeâs and Plays and sharkskin pants from Mr. Tonyâs flapped up, as they would say. âFlap âem up for me, Mr. Tony.â\n\nBenji B\n\nAnd you were saying earlier he was trying to get you to loosen up and you were talking about chucking on the guitar. Can you show us what you mean by chucking?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nOh, Iâd be happy to...!\n\nBenji B\n\nGood. (Applause, Rodgers demonstrates on guitar)\n\nNile Rodgers\n\n(Continuing) This is going on for eight and a half minutes. We walk into this club, and my boy is playing this. Those are the only vocals on the record, that chorus, and everyone is losing their minds. As soon as the opening drum hits, swear to God, everyone went (screams) and ran out to the dancefloor. I donât remember what dance they were doing in those days, probably the rock or something (dances). The people in the audience were playing air bass and stuff. This went on for an hour. Iâd never seen anything like that and I realized the power of a groove, the power of the DJ to talk to the audience just through your groove record, and it had nothing to do with the radio. It had something to do with being in the environment and hitting you with something that moved you in the soul, moved your heart, moved you in the feet, and all of a sudden we really believed in ourselves. We thought, âDamn, if they like that, what if we develop more stuff?â\n\nAnd after âEverybody Danceâ it took almost a year, or a long time, to get record companies to believe in us. Even though we took A&R people down and showed them the reaction, like look, this was not staged, this was real. And the DJ would play the record for an hour at a time. He took two acetates and played them back and forth. Crazy! But the A&R people didnât quite understand it, they didnât understand the repetitive breakdowns and basically just an instrumental track.\n\nA few months later, Bernard was hired to do a record and they had to have a B-side to sell it commercially. And the B-side, a lot of the time producers would just say, âOK, hereâs some money, Iâll finish the song later.â And theyâd write the song and become the writers. Youâd do your track and theyâd finish it later because it was a filler song. There are a lot of filler songs that have become huge, like âI Will Surviveâ was a B-side. Gloria Gaynorâs biggest song was a B-side and she hated it. So Bernard â I wasnât on this session â cut this B-side and it was basically what would become âDance, Dance, Dance.â Since I was the only writer with Chic at the time, the guy who produced the session called me up to write it with him.\n\nBenji B\n\nBefore we go there, I think we should listen to the $10 record. I want to hear what you did that day, but please say thank you to Mr. Rodgers for the guitar demonstration. (Applause) Iâve only got the vocal version, but this is the tune that you heard in the club, âEverybody Dance.â And the B-side would be âDance, Dance, Dance,â right?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nNo, you didnât let me get there. We didnât get a record deal from this. They didnât understand it. We got the deal from âDance, Dance, Dance.â So the reason this song now has lyrics, after we got the single deal for âDance, Dance, Danceâ it was a hit, so they said, âOK, weâll exercise your option and give you an album deal.â So we wrote an album in three days and recorded it and put lyrics on âEverybody Dance,â which is how it became a full vocal song.\n\n(music: Chic â âLe Freakâ)\n\nYou know whatâs really funny is when I listen to it â when Iâm playing onstage I donât think about this â but now when I listen to it, we were very conscious of the fact we were making a record. When you hear the transitions, when we go from a verse to a chorus, itâs those simple nuances that let you know, as a band, as a unit, weâre switching to the chorus. So the part becomes modified, there are transition fills that let you know weâre going to the next section. Itâs not like a loop record where the thing comes and then dramatically shifts. The thing Iâve noticed about some of the great producers who make records from other peopleâs live performances is theyâre so conscious of that, they get the only part of the record thatâs viable to loop. When you watch Timbaland, he already knows to get to the bit at four and a half minutes because thatâs the part thatâs loopable, because weâre playing it differently all the time. Especially when I play those 16-note accents â and I donât play it going to the verse â if you loop that part, itâs going to be different than if you loop another part.\n\nAs I said earlier, we sang and performed every bit of it, from the first note to the end, the claps and everything. Thereâs nothing that has the benefit of a loop. The very first time that I superimposed something we made as a uniform group and then put it into a record, I was doing a record with Hall & Oates called âAdult Education.â I had my Synclavier and I told Daryl and John that all we had to do is get it right once. âWhat do you mean?â âYeah, we just have to really get it right once, the exact way we want it to be.â âThen what happens?â âIâm going to sample it on my Synclavier and then fly it in.â âYouâre kidding me. We donât have to sing this all day long?â âNo.â I went out onto 8th Street and grabbed a bunch of girls who were just walking around and said, âI just want you to go âOh yeah, oh yeah.ââ And they said, âBut weâre not really singers.â And I said, âExactly! Youâre supposed to sound like students in a classroom, the way we sounded when we were kids.â And I think thatâs changed our records to a huge extent. The randomness of this type of thing is its own wonderful R&B old-school thing. Thatâs not to say other stuff isnât valid, itâs just a different artform.\n\nThe thing, I think thereâs something a little different when you listen to random events and when people are performing at random events. When I did the album with Madonna, Like A Virgin, she came in and all of the demos were all sequenced. I said to her, âWhat if we played most of this stuff?â She said, âBut how can you play that?â I said, âNo, we can actually do that.â And the first thing I showed her was this song âDress You Up.â And the demo of âDress You Upâ is sequenced, the bass was (sings). I had my guys come in and I said, âWatch this shit.â I had Robbie go (sings bass riff) So most of that record is played. Thereâs a couple of tracks that do use drum machine because itâs an integral part of the sound of the demo and the sound of the song. But almost everything on that record is basically just Chic playing the record. The reason it doesnât sound like a Chic record, so to speak, is because we see to that artist â weâre not trying to make a Chic record, weâre making a Madonna record.\n\nThe reason I tried to insist upon it is I wanted her to be seen as an artist on a higher level. And unfortunately when she gave me those demos â and youâve got to remember, youâve gotta go back in time and remember it was different, like today the singer is basically just beating you up â thereâs no part where Shakira ainât singing. Singing, singing, singing, singing. But that was not what we did in those days. A dance record was eight or nine minutes long. How you going to sing for eight or nine minutes? Itâs not interesting. Whereas now Iâll go to a club and Iâm amazed at how short a dance record is. Itâs like, damn, three minutes? Whereâs the rest of the record? And the breakdown and the whole of the record is inside of three and a half, four minutes, and itâs done. And theyâll play a massive amount of songs in a night. But in the old days you could hear 60, 70 songs in the entire night, because songs would have long breakdowns and the DJ would groove forever.\n\nSo I wanted Madonna to be thought of more as an artist, where thereâs an interplay with the band. And I know that artists sing differently when the track is moving around. You interpret differently, you canât help it, if youâre a real artist. And I wanted her to become that real thing, because by the time we made that record she had proven to me that she had the work ethic. She was that magical thing. Iâve never made a record as successful as Like A Virgin and neither has she. So thereâs something to be said for that combination of old school and new school. Thereâs a marriage that does something very unique and I think thatâs why so many sampled records are phenomenal because they capture the essence of the thing and they catch it in a moment of time and they keep whipping it back on you. Itâs like you canât resist that thing. Thatâs just an opinion, but thatâs what it feels like to me.\n\nBenji B\n\nSo weâve just listened to âLe Freakâ and that really sums up Chic at their hottest, when it was really jumping off in the quote-unquote disco era. I just wanted to ask you what your relationship is like with the word disco, because youâve talked about âdisco sucksâ and being associated with it. What did that do for you and how did it hinder you being directly associated with that time and that movement?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nAt the time I was really hurt. Not because I was anti-disco. I loved disco. I was the first one to go to discos, hanging out, dancing all the time. But I thought it was disingenuous, because Chic wasnât a disco band. We had a couple of disco hits, but if you buy a Chic album, we were just a regular R&B band. We were doing the same thing Kool & the Gang were doing, we had instrumentals, ballads. If you compare the first Chic record to the first Village People record or Cerrone, Silver Convention, all of these really hot disco acts happening at the time, our records were nothing like theirs. We always had an instrumental, the band played, nothing was sequenced. I didnât even know what a sequencer was, I swear.\n\nWhen I first heard Donna Summer and Giorgio Moroder doing that stuff, I thought the guy was God â I still think heâs God. But I thought he was God from a groove point of view. I couldnât believe how anyone could play like that. I was like, âDamn, I canât wait to meet this dude and make records.â Thatâs how I developed âI Want Your Love.â If you listen to that, thatâs me imitating a sequencer. I didnât know you could buy something that goes (imitates sequencer), I didnât know you could buy that. Damn, I needed to learn that. I wanted to learn that so bad. I actually dreamt that song, I wanted to be that guy so much, wanted that precise (imitates sequencer). I just thought it was the funkiest thing I could imagine. And when I wrote âI Want Your Loveâ I was literally trying to do that. And it wasnât until a month later that I found out there was something called a sequencer. I thought it was just the name of a synthesiser, just a cool name. I didnât know it had a clock function.\n\nWe used to achieve that same effect by using a device called a Keypex that would basically open and close the audible signal. We did this on our very first record, âEverybody Dance.â The keyboard player I used, one of my jazz friends, and I loved the dude and wanted him on my record, but he couldnât play funky. So he played the best he could and Bob Clearmountain had me key his rhythm from my guitar playing. Iâm (sings) and heâs doing whatever heâs doing, but when you hear it on the record youâll hear all sorts of mistakes, he canât play the chord changes. Iâm thinking, âWow, this guy used to be my hero. Now heâs on my record and he canât hang with Chic.â It was incredible. But when you hear that 12â and that funky clavinet, thatâs actually me playing the rhythm and heâs holding the chord changes.\n\nSo we did that on a number of records. If you listen to Diana Rossâ âUpside Down,â the strings are going (imitates stabbing sequencer rhythm) Thatâs how much I wanted to be Giorgio. We didnât know how to do it. We had the strings playing half notes and Tony [Thompsonâs] hi-hat going (imitates sequencer), bring the gates in. Iâm not sure everybody knows this, but when we turned that album in, Motown hated the record and werenât going to release it. They tried to remix it and at some point they called us up and they were furious. âWhy did you erase those strings?â âWhat are you talking about?â âThe strings you gave us on the demoâ â which wasnât a demo, we actually mixed the record â âthe strings you gave us on the mix are all gone. Are you that pissed off at us? Itâs our property!â âTch! What kind of engineers do you have? You canât even figure out we did this on our first record. So, all you have to do is this, this and that and youâll have the strings.â So they did that, they copied it, and the next thing you know, even on what I call their lame mix â although it was still a huge record, the biggest of our career â did that technique.\n\nSo I was always influenced by some of the disco innovations, but we just didnât know how to do it. So we pulled if off our way. Maybe it was a good thing we didnât have a sequencer, because it forced me to do that thing. I probably would never have done âI Want Your Loveâ like that.\n\nBenji B\n\nBefore we step into the â80s and Chic in the production realm, indulge us and let us know what New York was like at that time. I know you were a regular at some of the most famous club nights of all time and you paint a vivid picture of what it was like to hang out at Studio 54 and all of those classic spots.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nIt was probably the most fun Iâve ever had. If you took that chunk out of life, you boys and girls wouldnât be who you are. That era was so powerful and so bohemian, so revolutionary and so open, it gave us probably a false sense of power, a false sense of what we could do. In fact, the big companies were still in control, but we felt like we were able to push against the boundaries. I donât know if they still have record pools, because I donât know if they still service DJs with vinyl, but in my day every record came out on vinyl. Everything. I think the big record companies used the record pools to co-opt the power that the artists had. Because when we could go to the DJ with our own pressing and give it to them, we had an edge. But when the company says, âWeâll give you all the records free,â and all you had to do was report. Uh-oh! They took away our power because now they had a tool. The DJs didnât have to buy all those records, they could get them free. And Iâm pretty sure theyâd say, âReport on our records.â I canât swear to it, but why not, if you have that kind of financial power over people?\n\nSo what went from this great bohemian, people-propelled, ground-up movement â because we really were in control â it shifted. You had the whole âdisco sucksâ thing and they had to circle the wagons, protect the industry and the money. The money was massive. You think itâs big now â yeah, itâs big if youâre Gaga or Jay-Z or Rihanna, itâs ridiculous â but in the old days you didnât have to be anywhere near that and you were still generating millions and millions of dollars. How many artists were signed to Atlantic Records when we went triple platinum? Dozens and dozens and dozens. And they would get second and third albums because they were making money. They were still part of this gigantic food chain. They only got dropped when they stopped making money for the label. You could have a flop, relatively speaking, and still be pretty successful.\n\nOne thing a lot of people donât understand is that the great thing about music, unlike the other electronic arts, or some of the other arts, it doesnât have to be translated. We can all understand it. I can go and play âLe Freakâ in Russia and we sing it just like that and everyone sings the songs. A few years ago we did a gig in Vegas and it was all Pacific Rim, what they call âmini- dragons,â all Asian millionaires and billionaires and the hotel had paid for them to come there. Nobody could speak English. Man, we go into a song and next thing you know itâs perfect English in the room. (Sings) âHave you heard about the new dance craze?â Songâs over and itâs Mandarin or Cantonese. Then the next record comes in and itâs like, (sings) âMy forbidden lover.â The recordâs over and itâs boom, back to Chinese. Think about it, how profitable is that? If you do a film, youâve got to put in subtitles. You do a book â I have a book out now â in Spain no one can read it unless itâs translated. A record, super-profitable. I remember we did the album with âGood Timesâ and the company was so greedy that they over- pressed with the stamp. Thereâs only a certain amount you can get out of one vinyl stamp to press vinyl. They were so greedy they were like, âPush the limits here, letâs do double the amount.â When Bernard and I went into quality control it, we saw that half the records didnât play â they just shipped them to Indonesia. I couldnât believe it, I was so embarrassed. But in Indonesia it was just fine, theyâd put it on and went (sings) âGood times.â\n\nItâs a highly profitable business because once you make it and you hit that number, just ship it out the door. You donât have to do any more work. Obviously, the powers that be really want to protect that business. I understand why that type of greed, it probably is very seductive. People who are in the business or want to get in to the business, the first thing you have to do is you better to make sure you love this. Chances are you will never make it to the level of Jay-Z and Rihanna. I never believed Iâd make it to the level I made it to, but I always believed Iâd be a working musician and Iâd be able to pay my bills and live the type of life I wanted to live. And that Iâd be able to play music for a living. And if you want to do that, thatâs absolutely achievable. You can do it, be you a DJ, singer, musician, whatever. Itâs great to set your sights on the brass ring, but make sure you love what youâre doing, that even if you donât get paid you still show up for work. (Applause)\n\nBenji B\n\nSo weâve spoken about your experiences as an artist, in the band, as a songwriter, I think itâs really important we dedicate a portion of this talk to the art of producing because thatâs dominated so much.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nYeah, do we get a break so I can go to the bathroom?\n\nBenji B\n\nAbsolutely, you can get a bathroom break at any time, I need to as well.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nBathroom breaks are an essential part of record production.\n\nBenji B\n\nHere we go.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThatâs three.\n\nBenji B\n\nFive-minute bathroom break.\n\n(music: David Bowie â âLetâs Danceâ)\n\nDavid Bowie famously once said, âNile Rodgers is the only person who could get me to sing a chorus straight away in a record.â\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nItâs funny he said that. Heâs right, I guess. âRebel Rebelâ just starts with a lick, but he doesnât start off singing âRebel Rebel.â Sorry, I started tearing there when I heard Stevie Ray [Vaughan]. When we did this record, a lot of people donât understand that David Bowie didnât even have a record deal. He was between record labels. I had just finished my first solo album, which I knew was not going to be a hit. I didnât think that when I was making it â I thought it was great and innovative â but David came to my apartment one day and we listened to a test pressing. Just to show you how the two different minds think and how his world is one way and my worldâs another. After we sat down and listened to my solo record â 100% true and Iâm saying it and Iâm on tape now, so Iâm stuck like Diana Ross. David would say, âBut you said it on tape!â The truth is that after we played my solo album â because the test pressings came in while we were conceiving Letâs Dance â as soon as it finished playing, I got really depressed because I knew I didnât have a hit.\n\nIn America, the only avenue open to me is black radio and my record was so not black radio. By then the DJ culture had really been co-opted into the industry. I didnât even have any DJs. There were a few guys, Larry Levan played my stuff and actually wound up getting a few people on the dancefloor playing my stuff, which was amazing to me because I was trying to get away from the disco thing, which I didnât even understand because Chic wasnât a disco group, we were an R&B group. So I kept thinking if I do anything like me Iâm going to be considered disco, so I have to do something drastically different. But when I played David Bowie the test pressing, hereâs the exact thing he said when we finished playing the record. He said, âNile, darling, if you make a record for me half as good as that Iâll be the happiest man in the world.â I was shocked. Because it was clear to me on the spot that Iâd messed up and had not make a commercial black record and was not going to be able to take that to the rock stations.\n\nWhen we finished the song called âWhyâ by Carly Simon, the rock stations showed me exactly what I wasnât going to be able to do. I tried to play that record on the most popular rock station in America. I was the guest DJ and they wouldnât allow me to play it, because it was a dancehall reggae kind of record before dancehall reggae was dancehall reggae. The only song Iâd heard before was âPass the Dutchieâ and we tried to imitate something like that in our own way. I bought a drum machine and was like, âHey, check this out.â (Sings riff) âUh uh, we donât play that on our rock station.â So I became aware of the politics slowly but surely and it started to sting.\n\nBut when Bowie heard my record he thought it was amazing. He thought, âWow, this is great stuff.â It was clear to me that the black world and the white world, no matter what I had achieved, I was still fighting the exact same battle the day I walked into the record company. So now that I was with Bowie, I had the chance to go from being a disco producer to just being a producer, which is all I wanted to be. When David and I agreed to do this record and agreed on the direction â the DNA, the âD.H.M.â, of this album â David can talk in very abstract terms, but that abstract language was the same language my parents spoke. Itâs the same language all cool jazz people speak, all artists, they can just talk about stuff, like Iâm doing now, and you know what the person means.\n\nSo when David and I were doing tons and tons of pre-promotion on the album that would become Letâs Dance, after we did all this research, David summed up rock & roll, or what this album was going to be, by a picture he found of Little Richard getting into a Cadillac. Little Richard was getting into his red drop-top Cadillac with his âdo like that and he had a red suit, red Cadillac, bam, had the pomp, and David held it up and said (adopting an English accent), âNile, thatâs rock & roll.â And he showed me the picture and I said (laughing), âIâve got it, Iâve got it man.â And we started making this record, which believe it or not, it took 17 days from start to mix, done. After the 18th day there was a bunch of people sitting in the recording studio listening to it like this. The 19th day, Nile was out getting drunk, the 20th day, Nile was out getting drunk, the 21st dayâ¦ We never touched this record again. It was done in 17 days, mixed, delivered. Stevie Ray Vaughan, Bowie, all those solos, everything done.\n\nAnd I think that this record almost more than any other captures that thing, that enigmatic thing called rock & roll. Itâs R&B at its roots â itâs R&B, itâs black music, thatâs what rock & roll was. It changed and all of a sudden it became different. Thatâs what the picture of Little Richard was. It starts with the Isley Brothers singing âTwist & Shoutâ, that (sings) singing the dominant 7th chord. Even the Beatles copied it, that was it, it gave us everything. The horn lick is a direct rip-off from another record. I get passionate about this stuff because I feel this world going away. And maybe it should go away, thatâs what we call progress. But this is what I grew up with and when I got with Bowie, he allowed me to be that dude. Before that I hadnât had that. Just like with the Diana Ross record, as revolutionary as it sounded to Motown, I understand why they thought it was revolutionary, because we were pushing the boundaries because â shit â we had Diana Ross. We could do that with Diana Ross. We couldnât do it with Chic, but we could do it with Diana. I could do this with Bowie. I couldnât do it with Chic.\n\nWhen you think about this record and you talk about rock & roll and musicians are anti-this and that, I was like, âGuys, what are you talking about?â Everybody on that record, the rhythm section, itâs all black and Puerto Rican people playing Bowieâs biggest rock & roll record. Bowie was so keen on that Little Richard thing and the essence of rock, it was, this is natural, this is the world I want to live in. Thatâs the world I always thought I would join when I signed a record deal. Itâs like the UN, weâre all cool. Thatâs why I had that revelation last night, I thought, âMan, if every world leader had to play an instrument or sing and then was forced to jam before you had a meeting, think about how much respect thereâd be.â Youâd have all these little affinity groups going, âHowâd you do that solo? Whoâs your favorite person? Weâll get to the budget later. But do you dig the Supremes? Tell the truth â do you really like the first Village People record?â All that stuff gets revealed, when you start jamming with people and you hear their influences, who they love and who they copy. Whoâd have known Johnny Marr was this serious Chic fan? I knew because he named his kid. Iâm sorry bro, I know we have a limited time but I just wanted to point that out.\n\nBenji B\n\nWe do have to open it up to the floor in a second. We should of course mention that you went on to work with Duran Duran, Madonna. Those records, like âWild Boys,â âNotoriousâ is a record you should definitely hear. I donât know if weâve got time to play them right now.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nWe probably donât and I love to hear from these people. When I used to go to these things I always wanted to learn something. Iâm just rambling, you can hit me on my website or Twitter. I can ramble on Twitter. Boy, I use those 140 characters. So we can do that. So do we have some personal questions?\n\nBenji B\n\nIâve been told by the bosses that we are allowed three questions only because Nile has to leave us.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nFive, he just upped it to five.\n\nBenji B\n\nItâs participants only. Or, of course, Nileâs band.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nHeâs in my band, he can ask me anytime. OK. You could ask me this back in the room.\n\nNile Rodgers band member\n\nBut I want to ask you this. You mentioned earlier when you were doing âEverybody Dance,â you said you were chucking, and Bernard came up with the idea. But then we never came back. The bassline â did you give it to him? What did he change that was genius?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe original bassline that I wrote, if you will, he was playingâ¦ my original chuck, was sort of the clavinet part that comes up later in the song. When I originally wrote âEverybody Danceâ I was playing (sings guitar parts), like what we do in the live show. After we break down we go to my original chuck, because I want to play it after all these years. So Bernardâs bassline was going (sings bassline) and I knew he could play it, so we were just hanging. Just to give you guys a little history, which some of you may not get or even care, but there was a really big record in the early disco days called âSugar Pie Guyâ by a band called The Joneses, and the record used to start off with (sings).\n\nSo all the basslines we did in the old days would go (sings). In between weâd always make fun and go (sings), so thatâs what it was. My original thing (sings), so when we started playing that, we both loved it. And then he went against me and made it really crowded. I was doing that chuck, which was ridiculous, then he went against me and I ceded to his bassline because it was so genius compared to the original thing I wrote. Thatâs why I came out into that thing. We were showing off. It was hard for us to get record producers when we first started. Whenever a producer came into the studio with us, once Bernard and I started chuckingâ¦ usually those record producers were keyboard players and, man, it would sound like a fusion battle. And everybody â I wonât mention any names âcause theyâre my boys now â but they would start competing with us. Chucking it here. The next thing you know, where the hellâs the song? Everybodyâsâ¦ (imitates jazz fusion) So thatâs why Chic records famously, unfortunately, restrict the keyboard players and theyâre just... (sings simple keyboard parts) Thatâs what worked for us and that was the sound of our group. (Applause)\n\nAudience Member\n\nComing up you worked with a lot of artists. Was there anyone in the â80s you wanted to work with but didnât get a chance to record?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThe only person I regret not working with was Miles Davis. We became really good friends for a minute, we did a photo session together. And now I believe in retrospect I know he was telling the truth. Miles and I became friends and he asked me to write some songs for him. The songs I wrote were these avant-garde new-agey jazz songs he does all the time. And he always said, (imitates Miles Davis) âDamn, Nile, I could do that. Marcus could do that. I want you to write a motherfucking âGood Timesâ. Give me a motherfucking âGood Times.ââ And I felt so uncomfortable because I thought he was just making fun of me, that he was just setting me up for a joke. I thought Iâd sit there and write it and then heâd go, âYou think Miles Davis should play that?â But he was serious â dead, dead serious. Itâs only now when I think back to some of the records he was trying to do that didnât work. He was looking for a motherfucking âGood Times.â But I felt weird.\n\nAfter Miles and I became buddies â we hung out and partied, never made any music together â I realized he was like David [Bowie], in that he could speak in abstract terms, but I didnât believe he was telling the truth. Thatâs one thing Iâll go to my grave regretting, that I never did that record. It wouldâve been amazing, once heâd made me believe â just like Bowie made me believe after that whole process we went through when he showed me the Little Richard picture. If Miles had come in and slapped down the âGood Timesâ 12â and said, âMan, give me that.â Of course, I wouldnât have done that, I wouldâve done Miles Davisâ version of that. Of course, we didnât do Little Richard, we did Bowieâs version of Little Richard.\n\nBut I just didnât believe it, man. I donât lament many things, but I actually feel bad about that. Itâs not that I want to have another notch on my belt â âYo, I got a hit with Milesâ â itâs artistically thereâs something missing from my life. That wouldâve filled that one thing in, to have a viable jazz artist, a revolutionary jazz artist. As a matter of fact, what if I couldâve given Miles his biggest record? That wouldâve been unbelievable to me. Thatâs it.\n\nA person like Prince, I love him and heâs my friend and weâve played together live and stuff, thatâs good enough for me. I would like to make a record with Prince but Iâm not sure what it would be. I donât know how we would do that. I certainly know â like the thing with the world leaders â I know how to pick up a guitar with them and go jam, I know how to do that. (Applause)\n\nBenji B\n\nAny more very short questions?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nCome on somebody. Somebody in the back. Can we give him a mic or just speak up?\n\nNile Rodgers band member\n\nCan you talk about Stevie Ray Vaughan?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nYeah, I really go over this in more depth in my book, which everyone should get by the way. (Laughs) Itâs a great book, hold it up. (Benji B holds up the book) The first time I met Stevie Ray Vaughan was like Sister Sledge, in the studio. Remember how I said Iâm responsible for the food as a record producer? So Stevie Ray Vaughan comes in the studio, David is paying on his dime, heâs paying for everything. So that we donât waste time and take too long over a break, all of the musicians order their food at the beginning of the day so that when we take a break we can eat our food and go straight back to recording. So the first day Stevie Ray walks in, weâre just putting in our orders and Stevie Ray says, âNo, Iâll treat everybody to food tomorrow.â He calls a barbecue joint down in Texas and has the food Fedexed and sent to the recording studio the next day. I thought, âMan, this dude is the real deal.â I think it was called Samâs Barbecue and it came from Texas, and for many years to come we had the calendar hung up on the wall in the Power Station.\n\nStevie was incredible, he was so real. For a person of his virtuosity, you never met a more humble person. And this guy was ridiculous. Thereâs only a handful of people who can play like him. I donât know if you remember, Rich, but Stevie Ray had to go and play a gig with the Isley Brothers, and he was terrified. At that time they had âWhoâs That Ladyâ out and he was like, âOh, man, Iâve gotta go play with them.â âTrust me, Stevie, youâll be fine. Youâre gonna be cool, you can hang, you can hang.â And he was not being fake humble, he was like that. When we made the album Family Style, which was his only recording with his brother, which he never got to hear because he died before we finished, I cannot tell you how charming, how sweet, how genuinely magnanimous and giving he was. He was so open to learning. When we were doing songs like âLong, Long Way From Home,â remember that with the flash cards, and he was going in different keys, he was just so amazed weâd recorded his guitar track and weâd sampled it into the Synclavier. And then either Rich or I played a note, and he was like, âWhat was that?â âThatâs your guitar.â âHoly cow, I can play a note and move it from here to here?â He was like a child who was a genius. I canât say enough great stuff about him. Thereâs only a handful of people Iâve ever met in my life whoâve been that incredible and that cool.\n\nAudience Member\n\nIâm curious about your tracking process with Chic. You sound like youâre all in a room when you hear it back. Was it all one take? I feel like Iâm sitting in a room with you guys.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThatâs why there are very few alternate Chic takes. Thereâs a famous quote from Madonna saying, âTime is money and the money is mine.â In those days tape cost money, so we were always concerned about stuff. When weâd get the song right, that was it, it was done. Usually, it was right the first or second time, maybe the third time. Later on in our career I retrieved all the tapes, I have every Chic recording now, more or less. There are only a handful of alternate takes, because we didnât need them, we played it right. Also we didnât use metronomes, everything is free-played. The only time we used anything like a metronome or a clocking device is when I did that first record with Carly Simon, but that was after the whole âdisco sucksâ thing. Itâs funny, after they said we were a disco band and that we sucked, thatâs when we started to use a drum machine.\n\nAudience Member\n\nThe digital recording, you canât get that thickness like you guys had with analog. Do you think thatâs why some of the stuffâs been lost?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nWell, things are different because as artists â and probably as human beings â we always strive to do what feels natural. The thing that tastes like sugar is the thing you like the best. So, no matter how many artificial sweeteners you have, what youâre trying to do is get back to sugar. Whatever sounds like natural music in our ears, thatâs what youâre trying to get back to. The very first digital recording that I did, letâs say the first big digital recording, was Madonna, and we were trying to get back to the analog sound. We loved the convenience of using the Sony, but our ears wouldnât allow us to accept that. So we kept working with different outboard gear.\n\nI discovered early on that the D/A converters in the Sony consumer stuff sounded better than the professional stuff. I actually recorded my first solo album on a bunch of consumer digital products. Then there was all this crazy stuff because weâre just trying to get back to the world that we naturally live in, to sound that sounds the way weâre accustomed to hearing. Everything else feels like an irritant. Weâre cool, because itâs still something organic and grooving and fundamentally hip. Now weâve gotten accustomed to hearing tone-generated bass, so itâs starting to feel natural. Even though it hurts you, you can feel it. I walk into a club and itâs the same thing right away. I wonât say thereâs anything lost â if anything thereâs just more.\n\nThe old doesnât go away. If anything thereâs just more stuff. I believe in progress. When Rich and I did Coming to America, we went into the vault and they played us Elvis recordings on three tracks. You never heard anything like that! The heads were like that big (holds fingers about two inches apart) and it sounded incredible. But no one wants to go back to that. But it sounds better than anything I ever heard. (Applause) Did everybody say something? Like I say, I want you to learn something. (Inaudible question) What do you mean about my video game stuff? What about it? I donât understand the question. OK, this dude.\n\nAudience Member\n\nI want to talk about the âdisco sucksâ thing. I know you didnât consider Chic a disco band, but the population largely did associate you directly with it. How did that make you feel as an artist? And having these huge hits under your belt afterwards, was that a form of retribution?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nI donât know if I thought about it that clinically. The great thing about Bowie is that he righted the ship. He put me back on the course. What David said that I didnât get a chance to tell you, David said after we fooled around with some different stuff â actually no, it was the same day when we played my solo record and he told me that if I did a record half as good, not better, but half as good, that heâd the happiest man in the world â he told me in that same session that he wanted me to do what I did best. I said, âReally? Whatâs that?â He said, âI want you to do hits.â âYou think thatâs what I do best?â I thought I probably have more flops than hits, which proves that I do flops better than hits. But I hoped David would help me achieve the status of being considered a producer and hopefully a good producer. So when he said he wanted me to do hits, hereâs what David did for me.\n\nAs I said, when Iâm a producer my job is to serve the project. He told me, make hits. âThatâs what your job is â make hits, Nile Rodgers, because thatâs what you do best.â We had four hit records on that album. (Applause) And some of those were remakes. Imagine making a hit out of a song that wasnât a hit and people looking at it like, (affects voice) âYouâre defiling the gods of rock. You did an Iggy Pop song and itâs corny.â Yeah, but we sold two million of those corny records. (Laughs)\n\nBenji B\n\nSo thereâs a lot of aspiring producers, singers, instrumentalists in the room. If thereâs one thing you can leave them from all that experience, what would it be?\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nI think I said it earlier and Iâll reiterate. If you want to be in this business, make sure the first thing you commit to â itâs almost like a mantra â make sure that you really love it. Thatâs the biggest reward you can get. Like when we were listening back to those songs, I was like, âOh yeah, thatâs the Hammond B3 that we wheeled in for âLetâs Dance.ââ At first we werenât going to add it, but Bowie said, âIs that a B3 over there?â And we wheeled it in and put it on it. Make sure you love doing it just for the sake of doing it. Thatâs your greatest reward. If you have a blast doing it, then if you get a record deal and have a hit, oh my god, thatâs incredible. Because that ainât the real world. Chances are youâre not going to sign to a real label and youâre not going to get a hit record. But if you do happen to get one, all the more fantastic and wonderful.\n\nThe truth is I have just as much fun playing my little Epiphone in my bed every night than I do being in the studio with Bowie. Itâs a different experience but it feels exactly the same to me to toil over some jazz songs that I used to play with my eyes closed 35 years ago. It feels exactly the same to me today and I love it. And itâs not just because of having close calls with death. Iâve never changed, Iâve been like this since the moment I became what I call a musician.\n\nTo put a finer point on it, a few weeks ago we had Valerie Simpson perform with us. This was just a few days after her husband Nick Ashford had died. Valerie was one of the first to recognize Bernard and I as viable producers. She says a girl had come over to her nightclub, which she has in New York, she has these open- mic things and itâs really popular â and a girl cornered her the other day and said, âValerie, I really want to become a singer.â She says, âOh great, sweetie, thatâs fantastic. Can you sing, can you carry a tune?â âOh yeah, I can sing pretty well.â âOh, wait a minute, I thought you wanted to become a singer.â âI do, I want to become a singer.â âWell, sing for me.â And the girl sang and she sounded good. Valerie says, âWow, but you are a singer.â âNo, but I want to be a real singer.â And Valerie stops her and says, âOh, you want to become famous.â And she says, âYeah.â âOh, well, thatâs different. I donât know how to do that. I know how to be a singer, I know how you can become a singer, and you already are a singer. Go home and sing and sing and sing and if you want to be famous, try, keep trying and figure out a way of making it, because you sound great.â\n\nShe was trying to explain to this girl, you have a gift, be happy, because not many people can sing and not many people sound great. But she could see this woman had it distorted. She was defining a singer as being famous and thatâs not the case. So I agree with Valerie. Make sure you love it. I love it. Why do you think I still do this? I donât need to do this. Iâm out there because I love doing it. Last night was one of the funnest nights Iâve had... in 30 hours, because I loved the night before. And two nights before that was fun and tomorrowâs going to be fun. (Applause)\n\nBenji B\n\nWell, on that note Iâd like to say itâs been a great privilege, and on behalf of everyone in the room, please join me in thanking Mr. Nile Rodgers.\n\nNile Rodgers\n\nThank you."
