The 24-year-old has been missing ever since. Erin had moved to Alaska the year prior and was working as a nanny. Her sister, Stephanie, told Dateline that Erin left for her date on July 1 with David “Dave” Combs, a man whom Stephanie said Erin had met a few nights earlier at a local bar. They drove to the Girdwood Forest Fair, and according to witness statements to the Alaska State Troopers, Erin was last seen at a beer garden with her date before they left around 6 p.m. In a statement to authorities in 1995, Dave Combs said they walked to his car, but the lights had been left on and it would not start. He told Erin he would walk to a nearby friend’s house for help. He said he walked for about two hours, but was unable to find his friend’s house. When he returned to the car, he said Erin was gone. He told authorities he figured Erin returned to the fair. Combs said when he tried to start the car this time, it worked. He stated he went back to the fair and searched for Erin until about 1 a.m. Lieutenant Randy McPherron, who is the sole investigator in the Alaska State Troopers’ Cold Case Investigation Unit, told Dateline in 2019 they haven’t received any leads in several years, but said he would follow up on any that come in. He added there are no suspects in Erin’s disappearance but said they have attempted to reach Dave Combs multiple times for questioning. McPherron told Dateline in 2021 that there have been no updates in the case. Erin’s sister, Stephanie, started a Facebook page FindingErinMarieGilbert, where she continues to post regularly. At the time of her disappearance, Erin was described as 5’5’, 145 lbs, with brown hair and hazel eyes. She would be 50 years old today. Anyone with information about Erin’s case is asked to call the Alaska State Troopers at 907-428-7200 or Lt. McPherron at 907-269-5611.\n\nAnesha “Duffy” Murnane\n\nAnesha “Duffy” Murnane, 38, was last seen on security video on October 17, 2019, leaving her Homer, Alaska apartment heading to a 1 p.m. doctor’s appointment. She never made it. Police said security cameras captured Duffy leaving the Maintree Apartments on foot around 12:15 p.m. In the video, Duffy is wearing a blue jacket, light blue shirt and blue jeans. For weeks, law enforcement, assisted by K-9 units, searched the area where Duffy was known to frequently travel by foot. Duffy’s family told Dateline that she did not own a car and usually walked everywhere she went. According to Homer Police Department Lieutenant Ryan Browning, search dogs tracked Duffy’s scent into downtown Homer but then lost it, reaching a point search-dog handlers call a “car pick up.” Duffy’s mother, Sara Berg, says the family believes someone picked her up in a vehicle and that she has been abducted. She added that there has been no activity on Duffy’s bank cards and her phone battery was dead at the time of her disappearance. Sara filed a presumptive death petition for her daughter in April, 2021. On June 17, 2021, a six-member jury decided that Duffy can be presumed dead and also determined that her death was a homicide. According to online court records, Homer Superior Court Judge Bride Seifert issued a death certificate for Duffy on June 25. Her parents have long believed that she was murdered, but say they were still surprised to learn her death was a homicide. According to a June 23 press release, Homer Police consider Duffy’s case to be active and under investigation. Police continue to urge people to call the department if they think they’ve had any contact at all with Duffy or have any information about her whereabouts.\n\n“‘Any contact with her’ means just that, anything at all,” the press release stated. “Even seeing her at some type of event without actually speaking with her, walking somewhere or in a vehicle could prove helpful.” Anyone with information about Duffy’s whereabouts should contact the Homer Police Department at 907-235-3150 or Crime Stoppers at 907-283-8477.\n\nDoren Sanford\n\nDoren Sanford was in Fairbanks, Alaska to look at some property that he was interested in purchasing when he went missing on August 28, 2020. He was last known to be in the area of Airport Road where he was searching for his lost Rottweiler, Groot. Both are now missing. Doren, who was 34 at the time, was raised in Tok with his large extended family, and lived in Anchorage where he worked as a heavy equipment operator/laborer. He had recently started his own business, Sanford Home Repair & Remodel. Lieutenant Jess Carson of the Alaska State Troopers told Dateline in March that they continue to look for Doren and believe that finding Groot may lead to more answers on Doren’s whereabouts. He added that troopers suspect foul play in Doren’s disappearance and believe they’ve already spoken to people who know what happened to him. The Alaska State Troopers have been working closely with the Village Public Safety Officers, the Fairbanks Police Department, the FBI, The Tanana Chiefs Conference, and the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Persons Initiative. Doren is described as being 5’10” tall, weighing approximately 140-160 lbs, with brown hair and blue eyes. A Facebook page “Find Doren Sanford” has been created to share developments in the case. If you have any information on Doren’s whereabouts, please contact the Alaska State Troopers (907) 451-5100. A $10,000 reward is being offered by the family for information that leads to Doren.\n\nNajib ‘Jubi’ Monsif\n\nNajib ‘Jubi’ Monsif, 20, was last seen by his father around 2 a.m. on September 23, 2021, at their home in Scottsdale, Arizona. Later that morning, his father discovered Jubi was gone. Jubi has autism and is described as having the mental capacity of an 8-year-old. His belongings were left at home and he did not have a cell phone with him. Jubi’s family says it’s unusual for him to leave the house on his own and believes he was lured out of the house. They are offering a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads to his whereabouts. Jubi is described as being 5’10”, about 100 lbs, with a thin build. He was most likely wearing all black clothing and moccasins when he went missing. Anyone who believes they have an immediate sighting of Jubi should call 911. Anyone with information about Jubi’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Scottsdale Police at 480-312-5000.\n\nUPDATE: Jubi’s remains were discovered on December 7, 2021, in Mesa, Arizona. Scottsdale Police say there are no apparent signs of foul play.\n\nAlicia Navarro\n\nFifteen-year-old Alicia Navarro was last seen at her home in Glendale, Arizona, in the very early morning hours of September 15, 2019. When her parents woke up, she was gone and had left a note for them that read, “I ran away. I will be back. I swear. I’m sorry.” Alicia’s laptop was also gone, but the chargers were left behind in her room. Her mother, Jessica Nuñez, told Dateline in 2020 that she is especially worried because her daughter is on the autism spectrum and is known to be shy or anxious in some social situations. Alicia takes medicine and has a compromised immune system and Jessica has been worried that her daughter’s anxiety may have overwhelmed her amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Glendale Police Sgt. Randy Stewart told Dateline it was not known if Alicia was lured away or if she left on her own, but they were continuing to search for her and said they could use the public’s help for new information. The Glendale Police Department is working with the FBI and the Center for Missing and Exploited Children on the case. Officer Tiffany Ngalula, spokesperson for the Glendale Police Department, told Dateline last month that investigators have received and investigated at least 300 tips since 2019, and continue to receive at least four or five tips a week via social media and phone calls. A Facebook page called Finding Alicia Navarro has been created for anyone wanting to discuss the case or provide information that may lead to her whereabouts. Alicia has brown eyes, brown hair. She was 4’5”, weighed 95 lbs, and had braces at the time of her disappearance. She may have been wearing a sweatshirt, a whitewash denim overall skirt and black and white Vans-type sneakers and carrying a silver Apple MacBook Pro laptop. If you have any information on Alicia’s whereabouts, call the Glendale Police at 623-930-3000.\n\nDaniel Robinson\n\nOn June 23, 2021, 24-year-old Daniel Robinson, drove his 2017 blue Jeep Renegade with Arizona license plate NLA2CMA as he left his job site in the desert area west of Sun Valley Parkway just north of Cactus Road in Buckeye, Arizona. He hasn’t been seen or heard from since. Investigators said a ping was established on his cell phone but no location data was available due to the phone being off or out of range. It did not appear he'd made any calls or texts after leaving the work site. After graduating from the College of Charleston in South Carolina in 2019, Daniel was hired as a field geologist for Matrix New World Engineering and moved to Phoenix. He oversees sites located in remote desert areas and often works in extreme conditions, and travels long distances for projects. For months, multiple searches were conducted, but there was no trace of Daniel. In October, Daniel’s Jeep was discovered by a rancher in a ravine on his property about four miles southwest of the jobsite where he was last seen. Police say the Jeep appears to have rolled and landed on its side. Several of Daniel’s belongings were found at the scene, including clothes, his cell phone, wallet, and keys. A ground search was conducted, but nothing was found. In November, human remains were found in the search for Daniel, but were determined to belong to another missing person. Daniel’s father, David Robinson, who traveled cross country to search for him, told Dateline he will not leave Arizona until he finds his son. “It seems like it is simple, but when you are actually on the ground looking, it takes time,” he said. “You know, even with the people that we have it takes time... it’s a lot of time, effort and money to keep things going and I get weary at times that it is going to fade eventually and I won’t have that kind of support anymore, but like I said, as a father my drive is to find my son so I will do whatever it takes to make it happen.” Daniel is described as being 5’8” tall and weighs about 165 lbs. He has black hair and brown eyes. Daniel is missing part of his right arm from the forearm down. Anyone with information on Daniel’s whereabouts is asked to call the Buckeye Police at 623-349-6400 or the Buckeye Police tip line at 623-349-6411.\n\nBrad Allen\n\nBrad Allen, 38, was last seen in the early morning hours of July 18, 2017, on his family’s property in Fountain Hill, Arkansas. Brad’s girlfriend, Megan Coady, told Dateline in 2018 that she and Brad had gotten into an argument the night before and he told her he was going on a walk through the woods to cool off. But when she woke up later that morning and Brad hadn’t returned home, Megan grew concerned. After a few days of searching, the family called authorities to report Brad missing. Police tell Dateline they have interviewed Brad’s family, friends and coworkers, but there are no persons of interest at this time. Foul play is suspected in Brad’s disappearance. If you have any information on Brad’s whereabouts, please contact the Ashley County Sheriff's Office at (870) 853-2040.\n\nBrooke Allensworth\n\nBrooke Allensworth was last seen on July 12, 2018, a day after getting her hair and nails done at a salon in Independence County, Arkansas. She was 37 years old. According to NBC affiliate KARK, Brooke’s father reported her missing on July 26 to the Searcy County Police Department, as Brooke lived in Searcy County at the time. On July 27, police in Independence County got a call that a vehicle registered to Brooke was found under a bridge. Some of her personal belongings were found inside the car. There was no sign of a struggle. A Facebook post by the Independence County Sheriff’s Office said police spoke with “several individuals” who had contact with Brooke in the days preceding her disappearance. Though no information led them to Brooke’s whereabouts, tips started coming in from multiple counties and the case was transferred to the Arkansas State Police Department. There have been no updates in her case. Brooke is described as being 5’8” and weighing 180 lbs. If you have any information on the circumstances surrounding her disappearance, please call the Arkansas State Police at (501) 618-8000.\n\nThe California Five\n\nDespite active pursuits on social media for many years now, the families of five young men who went missing in the San Francisco, California area over the past decade still have few answers. Jackson Miller, missing May 15, 2010, Cameron Remmer, missing October 6, 2011, Shawn Dickerson, missing December 2, 2011, Crishtian Hughes, missing February 7, 2013, and Sean Sidi, missing May 21, 2013, all vanished from various areas of San Francisco without a trace. On March 26, 2021, a possible sighting of Jackson Miller at a Target in Woodland, California shined a new light on the cases. A woman called the Santa Clara County Sheriff’s Office and reported that she had been approached by a man who identified himself as “Jackson” and stated he was a missing person and asked her for a ride. She declined and he left. According to Oxygen.com, the National Center For Missing And Exploited Children has since conducted a forensic cross-analysis of the Target surveillance images. The results came back “inconclusive,\" John Bischoff, vice president of the Missing Children Division, said. Leads and searches have unearthed virtually no clues in any of their cases, but members of every family have banded together to help in the search efforts and cope with their shared grief. If you have any information regarding any of these five cases, please contact the San Francisco Police Department at (415) 558-5508.\n\nChristina Bastian\n\nHigh school teacher Christina Bastian and her dog, Coco, were last seen together in the early hours of November 1, 2015, at a friend's home near Apple Valley, California. The 34-year-old’s belongings were later found strewn along Highway 247, near Lucerne Valley. Her truck was located, abandoned, on a dirt road along Highway 62. The next day, her dog Coco was found alive by a stranger nearly 70 miles from where the truck had been located. In the six years since Christina vanished, there have been few clues discovered in the case. Her mother, Cheryl Denny, continues to post on the Facebook page Help Find Christina Bastian and tirelessly searches for her daughter. If you have any information regarding Christina’s case, please call the Apple Valley Police Department at (760) 240-7400.\n\nNancy Bromet\n\nNancy Bromet left her father’s home in Sunrise, Florida on November 12, 2015, to head to Bakersfield, California with her boyfriend, a long-haul truck driver. Several days later, the 37-year-old called her sister Laura saying she was in distress and wanted to come home. Soon after that phone call, Nancy was reported missing by her boyfriend, who reportedly told police he dropped her off at a shopping mall outside El Centro, California, while he was finishing deliveries. He said Nancy was not there when he returned, according to police. Few clues have been discovered in the case, and the investigation is still “open and active,” authorities said. If you have any information regarding Nancy’s case, please call the El Centro Police Department at (760) 337-4861.\n\nCecilia Cabrera\n\nThe last images of Cecilia Cabrera were captured on security footage from the Tachi Palace Casino in Lemoore, California. It was just before 1 a.m. on June 9, 2016, when the 31-year-old was seen leaving the casino in her dark grey Chevrolet Malibu. Several hours later, a call came in to the California State Highway Patrol that a burning vehicle had been discovered in an orchard near Goshen, about 30 miles away from the casino. It was Cecilia’s car, but she was not inside. Cecilia was last seen with her husband, Francisco Valdivia. In December of 2016, the Tulare County District Attorney's office filed charges against Valdivia for felony murder and arson. A woman, Rosalina Lopez, who was also married to Valdivia, was charged with one felony count of being an accessory to murder after the fact. Valdivia and Lopez were arraigned at the Tulare County Pretrial Facility on Dec. 14, 2016. There was no bail set for Valdivia and bail for Lopez was set at $500,000. to the Sun Gazette in June 2019, Cecilia’s son, Juan, has joined the Tulare County Sheriff’s Office Explorer Program and plans to pursue a career as a TCSO Deputy Sheriff. As of 2021, Cecilia’s body has still not been found. If you have any information in Cecilia’s case, please call the Tulare County Sheriff's Department at (559) 735-1880.\n\nDonald Cavanaugh\n\nDonald Cavanaugh was one of two men who went missing more than a decade ago after working on the same small horse ranch in California outside Westport, a town with only 60 residents. Donald, then 63, was reported missing in May 2005, in Ukiah, California after a dispute with his nephew, James DeNoyer, who was the ranch owner. David Neily, 69, was reported missing in Westport, California just one year later, also reportedly after a confrontation with DeNoyer. Both men's vehicles were found on DeNoyer's ranch property. DeNoyer denies having any information or involvement in either man’s disappearance and has not been named a suspect. For years, both have been feared dead. In May 2021, human remains were found by an employee at a private nature reserve in an old-growth Douglas-fir forest in Branscomb, about 3.5 miles from where David’s car had been found 15 years ago. DNA analysis of the remains and dental records examined by Jim Wood, a California Assembly member and forensic dentistry expert, determined they belonged to David. The examinations found no evidence of trauma and the sheriff’s office continues to investigate the circumstances surrounding Neily’s disappearance. Donald Cavanaugh is still missing. If you have information about either of these cases, you are encouraged to call the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office at (707) 234-2100.\n\nDane Elkins\n\nUC Santa Cruz student Dane Elkins, 21, was last known to be in the area of Castaic, California, around 8:20 p.m. on December 21, 2020. His car was found abandoned with a flat tire. His wallet and cell phone were located inside, but there was no sign of Dane. Dane’s mother, Deborah, told Dateline she spoke to her son that day. She added that in the days leading up to his disappearance, Dane had become mentally distressed due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and that he had been driving back and forth between their home in Brentwood and Santa Cruz, where he is an engineering student. He holds 23 national championships as a racquetball player and holds a black belt in Taekwondo. He also spent hours of his free time helping his mother as a volunteer to feed the homeless population in the Los Angeles area. For the past year, Dane’s family has used social media to reach out to the community for information on his whereabouts. A Facebook group Searching for Dane Elkins and the TikTok account @KindnessMom were launched to help with the search. In recent months, there have been reported sightings of Dane that his mother believes are legitimate and gives her hope that he is still alive. She said that anyone who believes they have spotted someone who might be Dane is encouraged to take a photo of the individual and send it to searchingfordaneelkins@gmail.com, which will allow the family to better determine if it actually could be Dane before passing it along to investigators. Dane is described as being 5’11” tall and weighing 170 lbs. He has brown hair and green eyes. His family said he had facial hair in the days before his disappearance. Anyone with information on his location is urged to call the LAPD’s Missing Persons Unit at (213) 996-1800. During non-business hours or on weekends, calls should be directed to 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247). Anyone wishing to remain anonymous should call Crime Stoppers at 800-222-TIPS (800-222-8477).\n\nMonique Figueroa\n\nMonique Figueroa told her family on May 19, 2015, that she was heading from her father’s home in Littlerock, California to visit friends in Los Angeles. Police recovered her 2004 Mercedes abandoned in a rural area outside Los Angeles several days later. Forensic tests were conducted, but no clues to Monique’s disappearance were uncovered. Several searches conducted over the past six years in relation to the case have not yielded anything significant. “I love my daughter; I would love her remains to be found and this case brought to a closure,” her father Jeff told Dateline. A $20,000 reward for information leading to arrests and conviction in Monique’s disappearance was reestablished by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on April 4, 2021. If you have any information regarding Monique’s case, please call the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department at (323) 890-5500 or Detective Karen Shonka at the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department, Homicide Bureau at (323) 890-5621 and refer to Report No. 015-07325-2661-400.\n\nDiana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez\n\nDiana Rose Alejandre Garcia Gonzalez had been known to travel between Winterhaven, California, Yuma, Arizona, and Mexico, but when she hadn’t been in contact with her family since April 2020, she was reported missing in that June. The 31-year-old, who was last seen on May 4, 2020, had been living with her girlfriend, Danielle Meeden, in Winterhaven. Diana had left her purse, cell phone and personal belongings behind. Investigator J. Hurtado confirmed to Dateline in 2020 that the sheriff’s office is actively searching for Diana and that it is an ongoing missing persons case. He added that they have interviewed several people about Diana’s disappearance. “There are many stories and rumors around this case right now,” Investigator Hurtado said. “So it’s hard to say at this time if foul play is involved.” Diana is described as being 5'3\" tall and weighing approximately 180 lbs, with brown hair and brown eyes. Diana’s family said she dyes her hair often, so it may be a lighter brown or blonde color. Anyone who may have information about Diane’s whereabouts is asked to contact the Imperial County Sheriff’s Office Investigation Unit at 442-265-2105 and reference case #2006-1642.\n\nMax Greenfield\n\nOn the night of March 17, 2018, Max Greenfield began messaging his friends asking if anyone wanted to go to the Lucky 7 Casino in Smith River, California. The casino was less than a 15-minute drive from Max’s house in Bookings, Oregon, and family says he went there often with friends. Security footage provided by the casino shows Max, 25, arriving around 1 a.m. A Curry County Sheriff’s Office press release says Max was then seen going outside the casino and waiting near the back door. Around 1:50 a.m., security footage shows Max talking to a white adult male in front of the casino. Max and the man are then seen walking south across the parking lot, parallel to Highway 101, until they go off camera, still walking south. Eighteen minutes later, the man re-enters the casino alone. In a statement to authorities, the man said he and Max “went separate ways after leaving the casino.” After conducting numerous interviews and searches, police tell Dateline they have suspects in the case but are not publicly releasing their names. Authorities say foul play is suspected and Max’s case is being treated as a homicide investigation. If you have any information on Max’s case, please call Detective Jerrin Gill at (707) 465-2468.\n\nKarlie Gusé\n\nOn October 12, 2018, 16-year-old Karlie Gusé left her home in Chalfant, California to hang out with friends nearby. Karlie’s stepmother, Melissa, told Dateline she picked Karlie up from town and brought her home around 9 p.m. According to Melissa, they ate dinner together before Karlie went to bed. Karlie’s father, Zachary, told Dateline that Karlie seemed “disoriented” before she went to bed, but would not comment further on her condition. Melissa said she went to Karlie’s room early the next morning to check on her stepdaughter, but Karlie was nowhere to be found. Five months later, Melissa appeared on the Dr. Phil daytime talk show, and told Dr. Phil she had lied to NBC in October when she spoke to Dateline. “Melissa, you told NBC, the next morning that at 5:45 a.m., you did your usual routine of opening up the kids’ doors, saying good morning, getting them ready for school -- that sort of thing. Did you -- she was still in bed at that time -- did you go back and lay down?” Dr. Phil asked Melissa on the show which aired on March 25, 2019. “No. That -- the Dateline NBC?” Melissa answered. “Yeah, that was a false story. Because I wasn’t – it was a lie about checking in on Karlie. Because it was in the beginning, and I didn’t know what to say and – I shouldn’t have even done the interview.” Karlie’s mother, Lindsay Fairley, who lives in Nevada, told Dateline in 2018 that she had been sick to her stomach from the pain her daughter’s disappearance had caused. Authorities say Karlie was last seen wearing a white t-shirt and grey sweatpants. There have been reported sightings of Karlie in the past few years, but none has turned out to be her. If you have any information surrounding Karlie’s disappearance, please call the Mono County Sheriff’s Office at 760-932-7549 and select option 7.\n\nRico Omarr Harris\n\nFormer Harlem Globetrotter Rico Omarr Harris was in the middle of a big life move from California to Oregon in the fall of 2014. He was traveling to visit his girlfriend in Seattle when, on October 10, 2014, he mysteriously disappeared. Rico, then 37, was last seen leaving the home that he shared with his mother in Alhambra, California. Three days later, his vehicle was found in the Yolo County Regional Park area near Rumsey, California, about 450 miles north of Alhambra. His wallet, cell phone and backpack were all located nearby.

Elaine had driven to her on-again, off-again boyfriend’s family’s home in Calabasas, California the previous evening. Elaine’s mother says the young man told her that Elaine had suffered some type of panic attack around 4 a.m. the next morning. He said despite his efforts to have her stay, Elaine drove off in her car. Security images from the property show Elaine’s car leaving the home, although authorities aren’t certain who is driving. Three days later, Elaine’s 2015 Honda Accord was spotted parked on the shoulder of Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu. The vehicle was unlocked and the key was still in the ignition. Authorities found Elaine’s cell phone and other personal belongings inside the car. Anyone with information regarding her case is urged to contact the Glendale Police Department at (818) 548-4911.\n\nLyn Palmer\n\nAfter working her normal volunteer shift at a local thrift store on April 20, 2018, 71-year-old Lyn Palmer returned to her home in Fall River Mills, California, where her husband of 20 years, Bob Palmer, was waiting for her. The couple was taking care of Bob’s daughter’s dog, a Blue Heeler named Lucy, for a few days. Lyn told her husband she was going to take Lucy on her typical 15-minute walk, leaving her phone, wallet, and purse on the kitchen counter. But she never returned. Four days later, Lucy returned to the house unharmed. Family and authorities have searched tirelessly for Lyn, but nothing of significance has been found and police say there are no signs of foul play. The Secret Witness program of Shasta County, in collaboration with Lyn’s family, is offering a $5,000 reward for information leading to Lyn’s whereabouts.

She told him to call 911 and go to the hospital. The 43-year-old was taken by ambulance from his hotel in San Diego to UCSD in Hillcrest. Three hours later, security cameras showed him walking out of the hospital. He never returned to his hotel, and he never called his mother back. Because of privacy laws, it’s unclear if Lance was treated at the hospital. Officials with the San Diego Police Department are investigating, but little information has been released in connection with the case. Authorities have reportedly conducted several searches, but few clues have been found. Anyone with information regarding Lance’s case is urged to contact the San Diego Police Department at (619) 531-2000.\n\nHeidi Planck\n\nCalifornia mother Heidi Planck, 39, was last seen leaving her 10-year-old son’s football game in Downey, California on October 17, 2021. She was first reported missing October 20 when she failed to pick her son up from school, and the case was transferred to robbery-homicide investigators on October 29. Hours after she was last seen, her dog was found on the 28th floor of an apartment building in Downtown Los Angeles. Her ex-husband, Jim Wayne, told Dateline he doesn't know how the dog got into the building and doesn't believe Heidi knew anyone in the building. Police have said their investigation led them to the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, about 40 miles northwest of the downtown location where Heidi was last seen.\n\n“Forensic evidence was located inside the building which has led detectives to believe an incident occurred resulting in Planck’s death,” police said. On November 29, Los Angeles police began searching the California landfill for evidence connected to her disappearance. Police said in a statement that they were looking in \"a specific area\" of the landfill for human remains. Police said there is still no lead on a suspect in what they believe is a robbery-homicide. The excavation operation is expected to take over a week and police warned of a potential “impact on community members who live around the Chiquita Canyon Landfill, specifically the community of Val Verde.” Police asked for tips from anyone who was at the residential building at 1201 S. Hope St., listed online as the Level Downtown Flower building, on or around Oct. 17.\n\nHeidi is described as being 5’3” and weighs 120 lbs, with blonde hair and blue eyes and was last seen wearing jeans and a grey sweater, driving a 2017 Grey Range Rover with California license plate “U840X0.” Anyone with information on Heidi’s whereabouts is urged to contact the Los Angeles Police Department, Missing Persons Unit, at (213) 996-1800 or 1-877-LAPD-24-7 (877-527-3247).

In July, Larry Millete was named a “person of interest” in the case. He denied any involvement in his wife’s disappearance. By October, he had been arrested and charged with her murder. At a press conference on October 20, authorities released new details, alleging that Larry used a black Lexus to transport Maya’s body on January 8, 2021. San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan revealed other new details, which included the fact that in 2020 Larry had been visiting “spellcasters” — people purporting to wield magical powers of persuasion — in an effort to make Maya want to stay in the relationship. Stephan added that Maya had scheduled an appointment with a divorce lawyer on January 12, but never made it. The last recorded activity on her phone was on January 8. Larry remains in the San Diego County Jail on no bond. Maya’s family continues to hold prayer vigils online and in person. At the press conference, her sister Maricris thanked the community and made a promise to Maya’s children: to find their mother’s body. Chula Vista Police say the “investigation continues to be ongoing and anyone who may have any information regarding Maya’s disappearance is asked to please contact San Diego County Crime Stoppers at 888-580-8477, or CVPD at 619-691-5151. No matter how small the detail, we ask the public to share that information with investigators or Crime Stoppers.”\n\nStacey Smart\n\nStacey Smart has been missing from the small Trinity County town of Lewiston, California for more than five years.

He was last seen in the 3700 block of Kanan Road in Agoura Hills, California, on July 13, 2021. His family says he suffers from depression and bipolar disorder and is worried because it’s unlike him to not be in contact with someone. He does not have a cell phone or ID on him, but could have been traveling to Denver or Salt Lake City, where he has friends, or to his hometown in Minnesota. Family members, friends and volunteers have scoured the woods and neighborhoods around Agoura Hills, Westlake, and Thousand Oaks, as well as Venice Beach and Malibu, searching shelters and homeless encampments. They’ve talked to hundreds of pedestrians and shared missing person posters with everyone they’ve come in contact with. A billboard is going up in the area of Venice Beach on December 27, 2021.

He’s 6’3” tall, weighs about 180 lbs, and has blue eyes and shaggy strawberry-blond hair. He has a tattoo of a sparrow on his upper right thigh and circle tattoos on his chest.

Vanzandt, 36, was standing in line with friends outside the American Junkie gastropub at about 10:15 p.m., when he began walking toward a nearby liquor store. He has not been seen or heard from since. The Air Force veteran, and father of three, was going through a divorce, but family members said there were absolutely no red flags in his personal life that would have led to his disappearance. Because he is an avid swimmer, they fear he may have gone in the water for a late-night dip. However, none of Michael’s belongings were found on the beach. Authorities say the case is still active and ongoing.

The 19-year-old was last seen at the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. After Sydney's parents were unable to reach her for several days, they first reported her missing on October 1 in North Carolina where they live and again in San Francisco on October 2.

After months without answers, Sydney’s parents took to social media to announce a $10,000 reward for information that leads to their daughter’s whereabouts and return.

She was supposed to attend her sister’s baby shower the next day, but never showed up. In July 2018, police identified 29-year-old Juan Jose Figueroa Jr. as a suspect in Rita’s disappearance as a result of testing from evidence submitted to forensic laboratories. On March 22, 2019, Figueroa was convicted of sexual assault, felony assault and attempted murder in an unrelated 2017 sexual assault case. He was sentenced to 93 years in prison. In June 2021, Figueroa was charged with Rita’s kidnapping and murder, according to court documents, and indicted by a grand jury. Documents show that Figueroa and Rita were together the night she disappeared and that a forensic search of Figueroa’s truck revealed DNA believed to belong to her. Figueroa confided to his cellmate that he had strangled Rita and disposed of her body after she had called him a “weirdo,” according to the documents. He also allegedly told the cellmate that he had buried Rita’s body and that the only way anyone would find it is if police inserted a probe into his brain. In October 2021, Figueroa appeared in Boulder District Court virtually from prison and pleaded not guilty to the charges. His trial is set for early 2022. Rita’s body has never been found. Authorities announced in June that the $10,000 reward for information on where Rita’s body is located is still active.

At the time of her disappearance, the 19-year-old was en route from her home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, where she lived with two roommates, to Denver for a modeling shoot. After nine years of searching and countless interviews, the El Paso Sheriff’s Office has been unable to find any significant leads. They told Dateline the case is still considered open and active, but have not said if they believe foul play is involved. Anyone with information about Kara’s case should call the El Paso County Sheriff's Office at (719) 390-5555. Her case number is 12-12983.\n\nUPDATE: In January 2022, a cold case review was being conducted on Kara’s case. This led to a new witness who provided a significant new lead. On February 7, 2022, the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office obtained a search warrant and located human remains. The remains were identified as Kara Nicholsby the El Paso County Coroner’s Office. Authorities arrested and charged Joel Hollendorfer with murder and tampering with physical evidence.\n\nKelsie Schelling\n\nKelsie Schelling went missing from Pueblo, Colorado on the night of February 4, 2013, after driving there from her home in Denver to meet her boyfriend, Donthe Lucas. The 21-year-old was two months pregnant with the couple's child, a reported stress point in the relationship. Video released by the Pueblo Police Department shows Schelling’s black 2011 Chevrolet Cruze parked in front of a Walmart store around noon the following day. The vehicle had been left there overnight. The next day at 7:20 a.m., an unidentified person can be seen getting into Schelling’s car and driving away. The car was found abandoned a week later at Saint Mary Corwin Medical Center. In November of 2017, tips led police to conduct searches in several different areas of Pueblo in connection with Kelsie’s case, but authorities told Dateline they were unable to find anything of significance. On December 1, 2017, police arrested Donthe Lucas for the first-degree murder of Kelsie. In August of 2018, Lucas pleaded not guilty to the murder charge. The trial was scheduled to start in April 2019, but new evidence found in the case over the summer postponed it until January 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the trial was pushed back to September and again to January 25, 2021. In March 2021, after just a few hours of deliberations, a Pueblo County jury found Donthe Lucas guilty of first-degree murder. He was sentenced afterward to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Police told Dateline they have searched multiple locations over the years, but have not found Kelsie’s remains. Her family continues to offer a $100,000 reward for any information that could ultimately lead to her body being recovered. If you have any information that can help authorities find Kelsie’s remains, please contact the Pueblo Crime Stoppers at (719) 542-7867.\n\nCharlene Voight\n\nCharlene Voight had just moved to Littleton, Colorado from her family’s home in Southern California when she disappeared. The move, in part, was so she could finally be with her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jeff Beier. The “always happy” 36-year-old had just graduated from Cal Poly Pomona with a degree in Landscape Architecture, and she was excited to start a new career. After not hearing from their daughter for several days, Charlene’s parents reported her missing on July 8, 2016. In March of 2018, authorities concluded a search of a landfill north of Denver in connection with Charlene’s case and while they did not find her body, they did find some of her clothes and the body of a small dog wrapped in a red sweater believed to have belonged to Charlene’s missing Chihuahua, Toby. The dog had been decapitated. In June 2020, an Arapahoe County grand jury in Colorado indicted Jeffery Scott Beier for Charlene’s murder. According to the affidavit, investigators believe Beier dumped the items at Tower Landfill in Commerce City, Colorado on July 2, 2016. He is charged with first-degree murder, first-degree felony murder, sexual assault, two counts of tampering with evidence, third-degree assault and two counts of attempting to influence a public servant, by misleading authorities about Charlene’s disappearance. He is also charged with aggravated animal cruelty. Shortly after Charlene vanished, Beier moved to Russia, where he was been in custody since 2020 pending a decision on extradition. If convicted, he faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole. Charlene’s body has still not been found. If you have any information regarding Charlene’s case, please call the Littleton Police Department at (303) 794-1551.\n\nNefertiri Trader\n\nNefertiri Trader was last seen on June 30, 2014, by a neighbor who told police Nefertiri was forced from her home and abducted in her own silver Acura RL around 4 a.m. in New Castle, Delaware.

The 21-year-old Dawsonville, Georgia mother was last seen in Hollywood, Florida, on July 25, 2020, driving a white mid-to-late 90s Chevy Silverado 3500 pickup truck with a red tailgate and a “Baby on Board” sign on the passenger window. On July 28, Leila’s pickup truck was found abandoned in a Walmart parking lot in Hollywood, two miles from where her son had been found the day before. In August, federal agents arrested Shannon Demar Ryan in Florida and charged him with kidnapping in connection to Leila’s disappearance. Shortly before Ryan’s arrest, he posted a video online discussing how he met up with Leila at a RaceTrac gas station in Hollywood on July 25 to buy her truck before her disappearance. According to the arrest affidavit provided to Dateline, Ryan told investigators he paid $3,000 to Leila for her truck and the three of them left in his 2004 Gold Lexus ES 330 to spend the day at Fort Lauderdale beach, leaving the truck behind. When they returned, he said he parked at the gas pumps at RaceTrac and told investigators that Leila and her son left in a dark sedan with several unknown men. He stated it was the last time he saw her. According to the affidavit, law enforcement reviewed the security footage from the RaceTrac gas station, but it did not show Ryan’s car at the pumps where he described it, and it did not show Leila leaving in a dark sedan. Investigators say a car resembling Ryan’s was spotted on security video in front of the apartment complex in Miramar just minutes before Leila’s son was found. On August 15, law enforcement officials searched Ryan’s Lexus and discovered a half-empty container of all-purpose cleaner with bleach, several black trash bags and a white powdery substance. In October 2020, the FBI in Miami searched the Monarch Hill Landfill in Pompano Beach, but did not release further details in the investigation, or how they were able to zero in on the landfill. “The FBI continues to actively pursue every lead related to this investigation,” the department said in a statement. “We are still seeking information about Leila Cavett’s disappearance.” According to information released by the Hollywood Police Department in May 2021, Ryan is now facing charges of second-degree murder and tampering with evidence in connection to Leila’s disappearance. A charge of child neglect without great bodily harm was added. Shannon Ryan is being held at Broward County Jail without bond. Leila is described as having been 5’4” and weighing about 110 lbs, with brown, shoulder-length hair and brown eyes. She had a tattoo that reads “Kamdyn” on her right arm and a small tattoo of a Christian fish symbol on her right wrist.

There were no remains found in the charred remnants of the home, and no one could find Donna. Authorities have said they believe the fire was accidental, most likely started by a space heater that was left running. However, officials do believe the 46-year-old met with some type of foul play. Family members said authorities came close to charging someone in connection with Donna’s disappearance, but there was not enough evidence to move forward. If you have any information regarding Donna’s case, please call the Lee County Sheriff’s Office at (239) 477-1810.\n\nLauren Dumolo\n\nLauren Dumolo, 29, was last seen by her boyfriend at the apartment they share on Coronado Parkway in Cape Coral, Florida on June 19, 2020.

They say she had been diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder, a mix of Bipolar and Schizophrenia, which is believed to have been caused by the inoperable brain tumor Marsha has been living with for years. Her family believes Marsha was trying to get home to their mother in Clewiston, but got confused, even though she was only 30 minutes away. Marsha is a devout Seventh Day Adventist and youth leader for the Pathfinders program at her church. Her family says she loved to be alone with God, and may have gone to a wooded area for peace and quiet, but would never go this long without trying to contact a family member.

The Nelson County Sheriff officially named Crystal’s boyfriend a suspect in her disappearance in October of 2015.

Singleton, a longtime employee of Houck, was charged with 38 counts of perjury for lying to investigators under oath in December of 2015. Houck was arrested in July of 2018 on four felony theft counts and four misdemeanor theft counts, unrelated to Crystal’s disappearance. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. On April 25, 2019, a jury found Houck not guilty on charges that he stole roofing shingles from a Nelson County Lowe's store. No charges have been filed in connection with Crystal’s disappearance, but officials have said they believe Crystal is dead. In August 2020, the FBI took over as the lead agency in the investigation. More than 150 state and federal law enforcement officers arrived in Bardstown and executed new search warrants at several properties connected to Brooks Houck. In the summer of 2021, FBI agents began excavation efforts at a home in the subdivision built by Houck in Bardstown. In September 2021, the FBI announced in a tweet that it concluded its latest search efforts.
