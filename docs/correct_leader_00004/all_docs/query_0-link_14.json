        "text": "(1845–94). John Thompson was the prime minister of Canada from 1892 to 1894. He was the first Roman Catholic to serve in the position.\n\nJohn David Thompson was born on November 10, 1845, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. He added the name Sparrow to become John Sparrow David Thompson later in life. As a young man he became a reporter and wrote about trials as well as debates in Nova Scotia’s legislature. He also studied law. He became a lawyer in 1865.\n\nThompson entered politics as an alderman for the city of Halifax in 1871. Six years later he was elected to the House of Assembly of Nova Scotia. He became the premier of Nova Scotia in 1882 but only served a few months before his party was voted out of office. He then served as a judge on the Nova Scotia Supreme Court.\n\nBecause of his experience as a judge, Prime Minister John Macdonald asked Thompson to join his cabinet as minister of justice in 1885. Cabinet ministers must be members of Parliament as well. Thompson therefore ran for a seat in the House of Commons as a member of the Conservative Party. He was elected in 1885.\n\nThompson was very successful as minister of justice. He helped arrange a fisheries treaty between Great Britain and the United States. He also defended the government’s actions in several major cases. And he revised the country’s criminal code, or set of laws.\n\nWhen Prime Minister Macdonald died in 1891 many people thought that Thompson should take over the job. But Thompson was a Roman Catholic, and he thought that some would not approve of him because of that. John Abbott became prime minister instead. But Thompson continued as minister of justice. He became a strong leader, and when Abbott resigned in 1892 Thompson took over the job of prime minister with no objections.\n\nThompson served only two years before he died. In 1893 he served on an international panel to resolve a dispute with the United States. The dispute concerned which country had the right to hunt for seals in the Bering Sea. He also had to deal with a dispute within the North-West Territories (now Alberta and Saskatchewan) over whether there should be separate schools for Catholics and Protestants. Thompson died on December 12, 1894, during a visit to Windsor Castle in England."
