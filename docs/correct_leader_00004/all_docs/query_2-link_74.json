        "text": "Paulo Coelho, wrote in his 1988 international best-selling novel The Alchemist, quote.\n\n“When we love, we always strive to become better than we are. When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too.”\n\nAs we approach Valentine’s Day, I decided to share stories of couples that have changed Canada forever.\n\nFrom mapping the continent, to fighting for union rights, to saving the lives of thousands in war zones, these couples have helped make our country, and the world, a better place.\n\nSo, grab a box of chocolates, sit back, and enjoy!\n\nI’m Craig Baird, these are love stories on Canadian History Ehx! [TRANSITION]\n\nWe begin our lovely journey through Canada’s romantic history with two of my favourite historical figures, David Thompson and Charlotte Small.\n\nThey were born half a world apart, into two very different cultures.\n\nCharlotte Small was from in the Northwest Territories, the daughter of a Cree woman and Patrick Small, a fur trader with the North West Company who abandoned the family when his contract with the company ended and he returned to Scotland.\n\nThis was the common practice for so-called country marriages which weren’t considered legal under the law because they involved no formality or documents.\n\nThese marriages were often done so a fur trader could get an advantage by marrying an Indigenous woman because she could help translate and foster exchanges. In return the woman would see her standing and security within the community increase.\n\nFor the most part, both the fur traders and the companies who employed them saw women in these arrangements as means to an end, and disposable.\n\nAfter her father abandoned the family, when Charlotte was still small life was hard for her mother and sisters and they struggled until she was of marrying age because one way out of that difficulty was to marry a European man, as her mother had done.\n\nAn arrangement was reached, and Charlotte found herself a husband, but her country marriage would go on to be much different from her mother’s.\n\nShe was just 13 years old, when she agreed to marry… now that might seem young today but please remember that this story took place in 1799 and life expectancy was much shorter then and unions of this kind were fairly common.\n\nOn June 10, 1799, Charlotte married a 29-year-old fur trader — David Thompson — in a settlement called Sakitawak, located 370 kilometres north of present-day Saskatoon.\n\nThompson recorded in his journal on their wedding day,\n\n“Today wed Charlotte Small.”\n\nSoon after the couple journeyed across the Prairies and settled at Rocky Mountain House, where they remained for three years while Thompson surveyed the area.\n\nIt quickly became apparent to Thompson that Charlotte was intelligent, capable and resourceful. She could also speak English, French and Cree and could decipher the languages of other Indigenous nations.\n\nThompson wrote,\n\n“My lovely wife is of the blood of these people, speaking their language, and well educated in the English language, which gives me a great advantage.”\n\nHer knowledge of Cree ceremonies and customs also gave Thompson a deeper understanding of his trading partners.\n\nShe was also invaluable to surviving winters because she was a highly skilled hunter and gatherer, always able to find food even during the harshest winters.\n\nOn June 10, 1801, on the second anniversary of their marriage, the couple welcomed their first child, Fanny, who was born at Rocky Mountain House where the couple thrived in the unrelenting environment.\n\nThompson’s records show that from November 1805 to February 1806, she snared eight rabbits which may not seem like much, but it was but enough to keep from starving.\n\nNot only did she keep everyone fed, but she also gathered and processed spruce roots for sewing and mending canoes and containers.\n\nOver the course of her time with Thompson she journeyed across the Canadian West and covered 40,000 kilometres.\n\nIn 1812, Thompson was ready to retire and move east to Montreal.\n\nHe could have done what so many other men before him had done and leave Charlotte behind but that was not what happened.\n\nThey had been together for those 13 years, and the family they raised was not something Thompson wanted to forget, or abandon.\n\nThe couple and their five children moved to Montreal, where they were baptized on Sept. 30.\n\nA month later o Oct. 30, 1812, the couple made their union formal at the Scotch Presbyterian Church, making it official and no longer a country marriage.\n\nIn Montreal, the couple had eight more children together, four of whom sadly did not survive to adulthood.\n\nWhile the couple were happy, life was difficult because Thompson had made some poor investments and the family’s wealth declined.\n\nBy 1831, Thompson was so deeply in debt he had to return to work as a surveyor to provide for his family.\n\nEventually, things became bad enough that he was forced to pawn his beloved surveying tools that had served him well for decades.\n\nIn 1845, Charlotte and Thompson moved in with their daughter and son-in-law to save money.\n\nOn Feb. 10, 1857, Thompson died in Montreal in near obscurity.\n\nHe was buried in an unmarked grave at Mount Royal Cemetery and less than three months later Charlotte joined him on May 4, 1857.\n\nTheir marriage lasted 58 years and is believed to be the longest in pre-Confederation history.\n\nToday, the couple is recognized for their significant contribution to the exploration of Western Canada together they mapped 3.9 million square kilometres (1.5 million square miles) of wilderness about one-fifth of the continent.\n\nA decade after David Thompson and Charlotte Small died, David Thompson – no relation- met the love of his life.\n\nJohn Sparrow David Thompson, was a Protestant lawyer in Nova Scotia in 1867,\n\nHe was getting over the death of his father six months earlier, when he met Annie Affleck.\n\nShe had grown up down the hill from where John’s parents lived but was a Catholic and three years older than him.\n\nWhen she met John, she immediately became attracted to his intelligence and modesty.\n\nFor John, she became his most important advisor and confidante because she was passionate and intelligent.\n\nDespite coming from different worlds, they quickly became inseparable.\n\nBy Autumn 1867, John was spending six days a week with Annie and her family.\n\nWhenever he could, he took her on long walks where he taught her French and shorthand which she used to write about their relationship in her diary.\n\nHer mother read the diary and to keep her from reading the steamier bits, Annie coded those sections in shorthand.\n\nThree years after they met, John and Annie married on July 5th, 1870.\n\nA year later John converted to Catholicism at the risk of losing his Protestant clients, but none left.\n\nOver the next two decades, the couple had nine children, five of which survived childhood.\n\nDuring that time John shifted from law to politics, and briefly became the Nova Scotia premier from May 25, 1882, to July 18, 1882.\n\nIn 1883, Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald pursued John Sparrow David Thompson to become a candidate for Parliament.\n\nAs a skilled lawyer, he would make an excellent Minister of Justice.\n\nJohn was reluctant because it would mean moving to Ottawa and possibly spending long stretches of time away from Annie and the family.\n\nBut Annie convinced him, and John entered federal politics in 1885, when he was elected to the House of Commons and soon became the Minister of Justice.\n\nLess than a decade later Sir John Sparrow David Thompson became prime minister on Dec. 5, 1892, following the resignation of Sir John Abbott. This meant working long hours, and John began to gain weight and his health declined.\n\nBut he couldn’t slow down since he was made a member of the Privy Council by Queen Victoria.\n\nHe was burning the candle at both ends but stopped long enough to have lunch at Windsor Castle on Dec. 12, 1894.,\n\nIn between courses John suffered a massive heart attack and died at the table.\n\nAnnie was devastated by his death.\n\nSix months later she moved to Toronto and took with her 30 trunks of letters he had written her during their life together.\n\nHeartbroken, Annie never remarried and the rest of her life doing charity work before her death in 1913.\n\nAnother important couple that helped shape Canada met in the late 1920’s.\n\nJohn Diefenbaker met Edna Bower when she was working as a teacher at Mayfair Elementary in Saskatoon.\n\nHe was a lawyer and aspiring politician who wasn’t having much luck getting elected.\n\nThe couple married in 1929 and Edna began to help John with his quest, but it was no easy task.\n\nFirst, he had to overcome crippling shyness.\n\nShe helped when meeting new people in new towns by arriving first and gathering information She then gave it to John with tips on how to use it to connect with the voters. This is how he built a “man of the people” persona.\n\nShe also drove him to meetings and edited his speeches.\n\nAll that work by Edna helped get John Diefenbaker elected to Parliament in 1940.\n\nAnd she wasn’t done yet.\n\nEdna was a constant presence in the House of Commons visitor’s gallery.\n\nShe also helped John foster a close relationship with the Ottawa Press Gallery.\n\nBut then…in 1950, Edna fell ill.\n\nDoctors diagnosed her with leukemia and her health quickly declined but her devotion to her husband and his career was unstoppable.\n\nJohn returned from a Commonwealth meeting in Australia in January 1951, and he went to see her in the hospital.,\n\nAt her bedside he heard the story of a young man charged with manslaughter in a train crash which occurred on Nov. 21, 1950, near Valemount, British Columbia.\n\nJack Atherton, a telegraph operator, was alleged to have passed an incomplete message which caused two trains going opposite directions to collide with each other killing 21 people, 17 of whom were soldiers on their way to fight in the Korean War.\n\nEdna told John to take the case which became known as the Canoe River Crash and defend Jack who had professed his innocence in the crash.\n\nBut there was a problem… for John to be able to represent the telegraph operator he would have to pass the British Columbia bar which cost $1,500.\n\nMeanwhile, Edna had already committed him to take the case.\n\nJohn had no choice; he did what needed to be done to represent Jack Atherton and, in the end, got him acquitted of the crime.\n\nThe court case made national headlines and raised John’s profile within the Progressive Conservative Party and among Canadians coast to coast.\n\nBut Edna never saw that courtroom victory.\n\nShe died on Feb. 7, 1951.\n\nUpon her death, Members of Parliament eulogized her on the floor of the House of Commons.\n\nTwo years later in 1953, John remarried and took Olive Palmer as his new bride.\n\nIn 1956, he became the leader of the Progressive Conservatives and one year later, was elected Prime Minister of Canada, serving until 1963.\n\nHis success as Prime Minster would not have been possible without Edna who first helped get John out of his shell and was his biggest and most unrelenting supporter.\n\nThe stories I’m sharing today are about how love makes the world better… regardless of location and Lucille Teasdale and Piero Corti made their impact felt half a world away in Uganda.\n\nIn 1955, Lucille was a young woman interning at a hospital in Montreal while pursuing a medical degree when she met Piero who was doing his residency.\n\nThe two immediately felt a connection, but according to Piero, she only had eyes for her career.\n\nHe said,\n\n“I must say, I didn’t see much of her then, she was too busy. Apart from being very hardworking, I find her extremely good looking.”\n\nLucille’s dream was to be a surgeon, and although male colleagues scoffed at the idea, Piero believed in her.\n\nBut it seemed everyone was against her, their colleagues told Pierro no one would trust a female surgeon and if he supported her, he wouldn’t be hired anywhere in the city.\n\nHe didn’t care, and neither did Lucille.\n\nAt the time, the law stipulated that to become a surgeon, part of the training had to be outside of Canada.\n\nLooking to complete her final year of residency abroad, Lucille applied to several hospitals in the United States.\n\nThey all turned her down despite having high grades and an excellent record as an intern.\n\nShe believed she was turned down because she was a woman.\n\nIn 1960, she travelled to Marseille to do her final year internship at the Hopital de la Conception.\n\nWhile in France, Lucille sent Piero a postcard asking him to visit.\n\nHe had been working in Northern Uganda as part of a UN mission. and was preparing the first air cargo of equipment to be airlifted.\n\nAt the time, the country was known as the Protectorate of Uganda, and was moving towards independence from being a British territory since 1894.\n\nInstead of going to France to meet Lucille, Piero asked her to join him for a couple of months in Gulu, Uganda where he was starting a surgical facility. a.\n\nA true romantic, he offered to pay for air travel, as well as cigarettes and toothpaste.\n\nShe arrived on an Italian Air Force plane and soon she hoped to work as a doctor in Uganda.\n\nBut first she had to obtain a licence, which required a two-month internship and was assigned a position in St. Mary’s Hospital Lacor, a non-profit hospital established in 1959 about five kilometres west of Gulu.\n\nIt had a 40-bed maternity ward, and an outpatient department, but the operating room was still under construction.\n\nThen she extended her stay a few extra weeks when Piero briefly returned to Italy to care for his ailing father.\n\nUpon his return she flew back to France to finish her studies.\n\nBut that wouldn’t last long.\n\nAs soon as Lucille returned to France, Piero followed her.\n\nHe begged her to be by his side and professed his love for her.\n\nShe was madly in love with him and agreed to go back to Uganda.\n\nThe couple married in a tiny chapel outside the hospital on Dec. 5, 1961.\n\nFrom then on, they ran the hospital and provided critical care for thousands of people.\n\nIn the meantime, Uganda became independent from Britain on Oct. 9, 1962, and just over a month later, Dominique, the couple’s only child, was born on Nov. 17.\n\nLocals called Dominique the word for being born far from home, Atim, and Lucille was called min Atim, which means mother of Atim.\n\nShe was respected for her tireless work ethic and boundless energy because it was common for her to see 300 patients a day, while performing back-to-back surgeries.\n\nIn 1967 alone, Lucille performed 554 major operations, almost two a day.\n\nAnd for each, she charged $15, if the family could even afford it.\n\nOften, she performed operations for free.\n\nMeanwhile, Piero treated 3,500 patients and helped 52,000 out-patients that year with the help of three other doctors.\n\nThe couple also set up a children’s hospital for patients suffering from leprosy where they could receive schooling and consistent care.\n\nDuring the 1960s, the couple operated their hospital in relative peace.\n\nThat did not last.\n\nIn 1971, Idi Amin staged a coup, overthrew the government and became president.\n\nNow that name might sound familiar to you.\n\nHe was a brutal ruler often referred to as the “Butcher of Africa” or you might know him as the Last King of Scotland.\n\nIn 1972 he expelled between 50,000 and 70,000 of Uganda’s Asian population and gave their properties and businesses to his supporters, causing the economy and infrastructure to collapse.\n\nIn 1977 he broke diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and claimed he was the Conqueror of the British Empire.\n\nUnder Amin’s tyrannical rule many expatriates left the country, but Lucille and Piero chose to stay.\n\nThe couple organized a support group in Italy to provide the hospital with used clothes, prescription drugs and equipment.\n\nBut they sent Dominque away to ensure her safety and so she could get a better education as conditions in Uganda deteriorated.\n\nIn 1979, Idi Amin was overthrown during the Uganda-Tanzania War and the disbanded army ransacked the hospital several times as they fled.\n\nFor months, the hospital was cut off from the world during the conflict, and Lucille was often operating on wounded civilians.\n\nDespite the turmoil around them, the couple upgraded the hospital to 482 beds, opened three health centres in nearby villages, established a health worker training program, trained laboratory technicians, and opened a nursing school.\n\nThen, in the early 1980s, while operating on a patient, Lucille cut her finger.\n\nShe thought nothing of it after treating it, but little did she know that the patient was infected with a mysterious illness not yet widely identified.\n\nBy 1982, the disease started to show up more frequently at the hospital and Lucille started to experience symptoms.\n\nIn 1985, she traveled to Italy where testing was available.\n\nThe disease? was HIV.\n\nShe compared being infected with the virus to wartime journalists who die on the job or, or men who work in mines.\n\nShe said,\n\n“I caught this disease instead of another one. Why should I be upset about it?”\n\nShe was given two years to live.\n\nThe unstoppable Lucille Teasdale kept working as her condition worsened over the next decade.\n\nBy early 1996, she weighed less than 100 pounds but was on her feet four to six hours a day in the Ugandan outpatient clinic.\n\nOften, she was too weak to get out of bed and needed an IV to rehydrate but as soon as she was able, she got to work.\n\nPiero and Lucille were aware that the end was near, and they planned for their legacy.\n\nThey trained surgeons, and their daughter Dominique, now a doctor too, joined her parents at the hospital in Uganda.\n\nLucille said,\n\n“My husband has had two heart attacks and I have my disease. We know we are not going to be around for many more years. We have practically Africanized the hospital and they are well prepared to take over.”\n\nLucille died in Italy on Aug. 1, 1996.\n\nEight years later, Piero followed when he died of pancreatic cancer. He is buried next to Lucille.\n\nTheir hospital continues to exist to this day… a testament to their love and Dominique became the president of Corti Foundation to not only carry her parents’ legacy but also share her love and compassion with the needy.\n\nSt. Mary’s Hospital Lacor receives billions from the Corti Foundation annually to fund its budget. Without it, the hospital would be one of the most expensive in the country.\n\nHelping those in need and looking out for the collective is something that Madeleine Parent and Kent Rowley did as well… not in Uganda but here in Canada….\n\nIn 1936, Madeleine enrolled at McGill University to pursue a bachelor of sociology.\n\nAt the school, she took part in her first collective action through the Canadian Students Assembly as they campaigned to seek financial aid for students dealing with poverty.\n\nIn 1941, she met Val Bjarnason, a student from British Columbia and got married soon after but this isn’t a story about them and by the end of the decade, they divorced.\n\nMeanwhile Madeleine graduated and began working as secretary of the Montreal Trades and Labour Council organizing committee.\n\nIn 1942, she started working as the key union organizer with Kent Rowley for the United Textile Workers of America in Quebec.\n\nThe two felt a strong connection, but as Madeleine was married.\n\nThey focused on the union and grew it to 6,000 textile workers by 1946In June of that year, on behalf of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union they began a strike against Dominion Textile in Valleyfield and Montreal to improve working conditions.\n\nMaurice Duplessis, the premier of Quebec, declared the strike “illegal.”\n\nOn Aug. 13, 1946, Madeleine and Kent were arrested.\n\nShe was charged with seditious conspiracy and public charges that she was a communist.\n\nSentenced to 30 days in jail, she was freed when the Court of Appeals reversed the verdict.\n\nThe arrests didn’t dampen her and Ken’s efforts as they continued to fight and eventually, the strikers won!\n\nFor Madeleine this was the first strike of many.\n\nLess than a year later the couple was back on the picket lines as 700 wool workers went on strike with the United Textile Workers of America on April 10, 1947.\n\nBetween May 2 and May 7 Madeleine was arrested three times, she was charged with influencing employees to go on strike, and was eventually released on $2,000 bail,\n\nKent was arrested and released as well.\n\nGilbert Ayers, president of Ayers Limited, the company they were striking against, said,\n\n“The truth is that Rowley and Miss Parent through this latest move are seeking personal vengeance against me. Rowley and Miss Parent will soon learn that we cannot be blackmailed or scared.”\n\nOn May 21, Madeleine and Kent surrendered to police because there was another warrant for their arrest on charges of seditious conspiracy and intimidation.\n\nJudge Aime Chasse sent Madeleine and Kent to trial on June 27.\n\nWhile awaiting trial, they criticized companies in Quebec, and spoke at union events to raise support for the Canadian Congress of Labour.\n\nMadeleine was also appointed as the acting Canadian director of the United Textile Workers of America.\n\nThe trial of Madeleine and Kent began on Nov. 26, and continued until Feb 7, 1948, when a jury deliberated for only 45 minutes and found Madeleine and Kent guilty of seditious conspiracy.\n\nKent was sentenced to six months in prison, while Madeleine was sentenced to two years.\n\nMadeleine appealed and was released on $3,000 bail and two years later she a new trial was ordered on May 31, 1949\n\nShe said,\n\n“Every autumn, we went to the court, and each time the attorney general stated that it was not in the public interest to proceed with the new trial at this time. It was an injustice, but part of my life, part of history, a McCarthy-like attack on people standing up for their rights.”\n\nAs her legal troubles continued, in 1952, she founded the Canadian Textile Council with Kent Rowley, as president. A year later, Madeleine and Kent finally married.\n\nThen in 1955 after what seemed like an eternity Madeleine Parent was acquitted, after the clerk in charge of the case died, and nobody could read his handwritten notes.\n\nNo new trials were ordered.\n\nThe entire affair became the longest trial in Quebec history to that point.\n\nShe said,\n\n“I think it was worth it. I’ve been called a witch, a moll, a lesbian, everything you could think of.”\n\nBut it came at a great cost.\n\nShe had wanted children but didn’t want to go to jail while pregnant or as a mother and by the time she was acquitted, she was 37 years old and felt it was too late.\n\nSo, she focused on making Canadian unions independent from American interests.\n\nUntil then most Canadian unions had U.S.-based headquarters, and after a split from their American counterparts the couple pushed for an independent labour movement as they continued organizing workers in Canada.\n\nIn 1956, Madeleine and Kent led a strike of 700 workers against Harding Carpets who was backed by the provincial government.\n\nThe company ran a full-page ad in the newspaper stating,\n\n“Kent Rowley is a communist, as is his associate Madeleine Parent.”\n\nThe strike lasted for 91 days as The Canadian Textile Council sought reduced weekly hours without a reduction in pay, an improved pension plan, and better medical coverage.\n\nIn the end, workers received a pay raise along with a better pension and medical coverage, but not a reduced work week.\n\nEventually, Madeleine and Kent’s efforts to form an independent union, caused the United Textile Workers Association to push them out of leadership.\n\nIn 1958, Kent moved to Ontario, while Madeleine remained in Quebec and they lived apart for the next decade not for a lack of love, but for a higher calling.\n\nMadeleine said,\n\n“Every time we thought of starting a family, something more pressing came up. Another strike, another cause, another negotiating session.”\n\nThey sacrificed so much as they toured Canada, to speak to workers, and help them form unions. They stood side by side on picket lines and lent their support in strikes.\n\nThe couple reunited in Ontario in 1968 and founded the Council of Canadian Unions closing the chapter on their 15-year struggle for independent unions.\n\nWhile they had faced criticism at times, their commitment would stand the test of time and cemented their legacy as determined, forward-thinking, widely honoured activists.\n\nBut the couple’s union wasn’t meant to last because Kent died ten years later in 1978.\n\nAfter his death, Madeleine returned to Quebec.\n\nHer advocacy as a labour organizer was fundamentally connected to her feminist and anti-racist activism and she became a founding member of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women and took part in women’s marches throughout the next three decades until her death in March 2012.\n\nFighting for a more equitable world is something Jim Egan and Jack Nesbit did as well.\n\nThey met for the first time in the spring of 1948, at the Savarin Hotel in Toronto.\n\nLocal gay men had known the intersection of Queen and Bay as “The Corners,” a place where they could surely find each other, and the hotel was located at 336-44 Bay Street.\n\nAt that time, it was one of the most popular gay spots in town. It was by no means exclusively gay but a great many of the customers were gay men because bars were strictly segregated in those days – there were no women on the men’s side.\n\nIn his book, Challenging the Conspiracy of Silence, Jim Egan wrote,\n\n“I was smitten with Jack.”\n\nTwo weeks later, they met again at the King Cole Room at the Park Plaza Hotel.\n\nJack was sitting with friends and Jim sat a little distance away when, Jack walked over and said,\n\n“I’ve been asking all these guys if they wanted to go steady with me, and none of them will. How about you? Would you like to go steady with me?”\n\nInitially shocked, Jim stated they should at least go on a date first.\n\nThe next night, they had their first date.\n\nIt was simple. A long walk together as they got to know each other.\n\nBeing gay was illegal in Canada and they needed to be careful.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 1948, they committed to each other.\n\nWith Jack’s support, Jim felt more at ease being a gay man.\n\nHe decided to tell his mother who told him that if he was happy, that all that mattered to her.\n\nJim wrote in his book,\n\n“When I brought Jack home for the first time, she took to him like another son, and they had a wonderful relationship for as long as she lived.”\n\nJack’s parents also welcomed Jim into the family and treated him like a second son.\n\nJack’s mother said,\n\n“You know, now I can die happy because Jack’s found someone who can look after him.”\n\nTheir loving and welcoming homes were the exception, not the norm at the time.\n\nIn Toronto, homosexuals had to keep their love secret. If discovered, not only did they face jail time, but they would lose their job.\n\nThat’s because following the Second World War, papers such as Justice Weekly freely spoke of quote “disgusting sex orgies” and the quote “limp wrist club.”\n\nArticles meant to inflame, not bring about understanding for the gay community.\n\nWhich meant that men like Jack who worked for the Provincial Audit Office at Queen’s Park could in no way reveal they were gay without risking their livelihoods.\n\nIn contrast, Jim was self-employed and was able to take a stand which he did in 1949 when he began writing letters and articles advocating for gay rights in Canada.\n\nFor the next 15 years, he wrote letters to the Globe and Mail, Toronto Star, and any other publication that were prejudicial to his community.\n\nIn one piece he wrote,\n\n“The acceptance and integration that every thinking responsible homosexual desires will come some day.”\n\nIt was not without a cost.\n\nIn 1963, Jack told him he couldn’t deal with the growing attention and the couple broke up Jim said,\n\n“Activism was very important to me. I couldn’t just walk away from it.”\n\nJim Egan continued his work and slowly there was progress.\n\nPublications moved away from articles condemning the LGBTQ2S+ community and towards understanding.\n\nIn 1964, The Homosexual Next Door, one of the first positive portrayals of homosexuality was published in Macleans.\n\nJim described the two-part series as fair and objective. He said,\n\n, “Considering that they were written by someone like Katz, who was not gay, the articles were refreshingly non-judgemental for the time and very informative.”\n\nAlthough Jack and Jim had broken up fate would bring them together in May 1964 when they ran into each other at the Parkside Tavern at 530 Yonge Street.\n\nJack invited Jim back to the apartment and the two had a long talk.\n\nJim wanted to be with Jack, even if it meant abandoning his activism and he would do it if they left Toronto.\n\nThey got back together and a month later they left with three chihuahuas, ready to begin their new life in British Columbia.\n\nFor the next twenty years they lived a quiet life in a more welcoming environment where they were able as openly gay men in Merville, a community on Vancouver Island.\n\nIn 1981, Jim ran for the position of regional director of Electoral Area B of the Regional District of Comox-Strathcona and became the first openly gay man in a relationship to be elected to public office in Canada and served until1993.\n\nJim may have been done with activism, but activism was not done with him.\n\nWhen he retired in 1986, he started to collect his Canadian Pension.\n\nThe couple had been together since 1948, apart from one year in the 60’s so Jim applied for Jack to receive spousal benefits under the Old Age Security Act since they met all the requirements.\n\nHealth and Welfare Canada denied their claim based on the fact they were a same-sex couple.\n\nIn 1988, Jim launched a case in the Trial Division of the Federal Court of Claim, stating that they were being discriminated against for being a same-sex couple.\n\nHe argued it violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nIn 1991, the Federal Court dismissed the case deeming their relationship, not spousal They appealed the decision and the Federal Court of Appeal ruled against them in 1993.\n\nThe next step was to take their case to the highest court in the land, the Supreme Court of Canada.\n\nIn May 1995, the Supreme Court dismissed Jack and Jim’s appeal.\n\nBut…\n\nThey also ruled unanimously to include sexual orientation as a prohibited grounds for discrimination in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms.\n\nWhile they lost the battle, they won the war.\n\nThis Supreme Court decision would set a precedent for several other landmark LGBTQ2S+ cases including Halpern v Canada in 2003.\n\nThat case ruled that the common law definition of marriage, defined as between a man and a woman, violated section 15 of the Charter.\n\nIt allowed for the legalization of same-sex marriage in Canada in 2005.\n\nFollowing their landmark case, Jack and Jim were made the grand marshals of the 1995 Toronto Pride Parade.\n\nSadly, Jim Egan died in March 2000.\n\nThree months later, his lifelong partner, Jack Nesbitt, passed away.\n\nIn 2018, Jim Egan and Jack Nesbitt were the subjects of the first LGBTQ Heritage Minute.\n\nThey didn’t get a chance to see same sex marriages become legal, but their love made Canada a better place.\n\nJack and Jim opened the doors for all Canadians to be able to marry.\n\nSix years before Jack and Jim met Anne and Charles Muise got married.\n\nLittle did they know on July 13, 1942, that their wedded bliss would become one of the longest unions in Canadian history.\n\nThey first met at a church dance, and it was love at first sight.\n\nThey got married as the Second World War raged and two months later Charles was shipped off to Europe.\n\nHe was gone for three years and almost every week he wrote to her Anne sent him care packages of chocolate and cigarettes.\n\nOnce the war ended and Charles returned home.\n\nAnne said that Charles arrived shell-shocked, “he did not understand me, and I didn’t understand him, so we had to get used to each other all over again.”\n\nThey bought a house in Yarmouth Nova Scotia for $2,000 and raised eight children.\n\nNearly 77 years later the couple turned 100 years old in that same house.\n\nOn July 13, 2022, they celebrated 80 years of marriage together, they love lasted through three British monarchs, 15 Governors General and 13 Prime Ministers.\n\nTheir secret to a long life and marriage?\n\n“If you stay in love, you don’t have too many problems,” said Charles.\n\n“I don’t think there is any secret. You just love from day to day,” said Anne."
