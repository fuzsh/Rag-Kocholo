That the reputation of Canada's fourth prime minister has since sunk into obscurity is due to the unfortunate brevity of his term of office.\n\nJohn Sparrow David Thompson was born in Halifax in 1845. Like his father, he worked as a reporter for trials and assembly debates. He articled with a Halifax lawyer and was called to the bar in 1865. Although initially reluctant to enter politics, Thompson went from local alderman in 1871, to provincial attorney-general, in 1878 and became Nova Scotia premier in 1882. When the Conservatives were defeated later that year, he left politics, and was appointed to the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia.\n\nThree years later, Prime Minister John A. Macdonald was looking for a new Cabinet minister and the young Nova Scotian judge was recommended. After much persuasion, Thompson agreed to take the Justice portfolio and stand in the federal by-election for Antigonish. He proved himself to be exceptionally able and conscientious, with a reputation for fairness. As Minister of Justice, he represented Canada in negotiations with Britain and the United States on fishing rights and copyright.\n\nMore and more, the aging Sir John A. Macdonald relied on Thompson to carry out the buisness of government. Many considered him to be a natural successor when Macdonald died in 1891, but Thompson declined on the grounds that his Catholicism would be unacceptable to the party. While John Abbott served as prime minister from the Senate, Thompson represented the government in the House of Commons. He lead the investigation into the Langevin scandal, which concerned one of his fellow ministers. At the time, Thompson undertook the huge task of revising the Criminal Code of Canada and getting it passed by the House.\n\nThompson so clearly proved himself as a capable leader, that there were no objections to his succession as prime minister when Abbott resigned in November 1892. During the next two years, he took part in negotiations with the U.S. over Bering Sea sealing dispute, and settled the North West Territories school question.\n\nA very important source of strength for Thompson was his family, in particular his relationship with his wife, Annie. They had married in 1870, having won down the resistance of Annie's Catholic parents. Thompson was born a Methodist, but converted to Catholicism several months after his marriage. Whenever they were apart, Thompson and Annie carried on a daily correspondence, in which it is clear that he relied on her for support and advice. It is also clear that they loved each other passionately; the ruse of corresponding in shorthand which began when they were courting, carried on throughout their marriage to disguise the amorous passage of their letters.\n\nThe Thompsons were close friends with Lord Aberdeen, the Govenor General, and his wife. When Lady Aberdeen started the National Council for Women in 1894, Thompson supported her whole-heartedly and spoke at their inaugaural meeting. His attitudes towards women were typical of his broad-minded philosophy.\n\nPerhaps the women of Canada would have received the vote much sooner, had Thompson remained prime minister longer. While in Britain, at Windsor Castle in December 1894, he suffered a heart attack and died. The shock of his sudden death was felt on both sides of the Atlantic. Queen Victoria was concerned that Thompson be returned to Canada with due pomp and ceremony. Out of respect for his Catholicism she held a requiem mass at Windsor. Painted black, the battleship HMS Blenheim returned Thompson' s body to Halifax, where he was buried. In Halifax, when the Blenheim docked, was a young artist, Frederick Bell-Smith, who made sketches of the battleship' s arrival and Thompson's funeral. Sir Charles Tupper encouraged Bell-Smith to commemorate the Mass which the Queen had held in Thompson' s honour, and the artist went later that year to Britain. He was granted an audience with the Queen to sketch her portrait. Bell-Smith executed three large paintings commemorating Thompson's death. One was destroyed in the House of Commons fire of 1916 and another is thought to be with the artist's descendants. The third is at the National Archives of Canada.\n\nSOURCE: Library and Archives Canada."
