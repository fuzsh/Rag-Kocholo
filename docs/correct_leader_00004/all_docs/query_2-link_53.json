        "text": "British North America Act\n\nThe British North America Act was passed by the British Parliament and given royal assent by Queen Victoria on 29 March. It came into effect on 1 July. The Act joined the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick in one federal union. In 1949, Newfoundland becomes Canada’s newest province. In 1999, Nunavut becomes Canada’s newest territory. Its creation establishes self-governance for the region’s Inuit population.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nVoters are Male “Persons”\n\nUnder the Electoral Franchise Act, those permitted to vote at the federal level are defined as “male person[s].” The original draft of the bill had attempted to expand the franchise to unmarried women and widows with property (and to First Nations living on reserves), but these groups were dropped from the final legislation.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nSaskatchewan Elects First Female MLA\n\nSarah Ramsland, Saskatchewan’s first female Member of the Legislative Assembly, won her seat in a by-election. After her husband, MLA Max Ramsland, died in the 1918 influenza epidemic, Sarah was invited to run in the same district and won. In the first 66 years in which Saskatchewan women could hold provincial office, only 10 were elected.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nDominion Elections Act\n\nThe Dominion Elections Act enfranchised many of those who had been disenfranchised during the First World War, such as those originating from countries with which Canada had been at war. However, the Act stated that anyone who was disenfranchised by provincial legislation because of race would remain disenfranchised from the federal vote. This included persons of Chinese origin in Saskatchewan, and those of Indigenous, Chinese, Japanese, and South Asian origins in British Columbia.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nParlby Elected\n\nIrene Parlby was elected to the Alberta Legislature, representing Lacombe in the United Farmers of Alberta government. She was subsequently named to Cabinet, as minister without portfolio. Parlby was only the second woman in the British Empire to hold ministerial office. She was particularly active on issues related to public health care, improved wages for working women and married women's property rights.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nJapanese Canadians Enfranchised\n\nJapanese Canadians were given the right to vote, and the legal restrictions used to control the movement of Japanese Canadians were removed. With their freedom reestablished, some moved back to British Columbia. But due to the hardships suffered, most Japanese Canadians who were expelled from the coast or deported did not return. With the extension of the federal franchise to Japanese Canadians, the last statutory disenfranchisement of Asians was removed.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nMcLaughlin Elected as First Female Party Leader in Canada\n\nYukon MP Audrey McLaughlin was chosen leader of the NDP at a national convention in Winnipeg, succeeding Ed Broadbent. She was the first woman to lead a national Canadian political party. She spent six years as leader before stepping down in 1995 after the NDP fell to nine seats in the 1993 general election and lost its official party status.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nLiberals Win Federal Election\n\nIn a federal election, the Liberals won 178 seats and a majority. The Conservatives' 154 seats were reduced to 2, while the NDP retained only 9. Reform won 52 seats and the Bloc Québécois became the official opposition with 54.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\n1997 Federal Election Results\n\nThe Liberal Party retained its majority with 155 seats and the Reform Party with 60 seats became the Official Opposition. The Bloc Québécois fell to 44 seats from 54 while the NDP won 21 seats (up from 9) and the Conservatives 20 (up from 2).\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nAll Prisoners Granted Right to Vote\n\nIn Sauvé v Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada holds that, under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, all prisoners have the right to vote.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nQuebec Liberals Win Election\n\nJean Charest''s Liberal Party won the provincial election and formed the first minority government in Québec in 130 years. The ADQ unseated the Parti Québécois as the official opposition, and for the first time in 30 years the PQ formed neither the government nor the opposition.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nAariak Becomes First Female Premier of Nunavut\n\nEva Aariak, the MLA for Iqaluit East and Nunavut's former languages commissioner, defeated Paul Okalik to become Nunavut’s second premier and the territory’s first female premier. She was, however, the only woman in the legislature.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nLiberal Majority Ends Nine-Year Tory Rule\n\nAt the end of an 11-week campaign — one of the longest in Canadian history — voters elected a majority Liberal government under Justin Trudeau, denying Stephen Harper's Conservatives a fourth federal mandate. The 2015 election marked the end of Harper's nine-year term as prime minister, and following the results he resigned as leader of the Conservative Party.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nRecord Number of Women Elected Federally\n\nEighty-eight women were elected in the 2015 federal election, the highest number to date. Women made up 33 per cent of the candidates in the five leading parties, and won 26 per cent of the seats in the House.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nJustin Trudeau Sworn In as Prime Minister\n\nJustin Trudeau was sworn in as the 23rd prime minister of Canada at a ceremony in Ottawa, followed by the swearing-in of the country's first gender-balanced Cabinet of 15 men and 15 women. Trudeau's Liberal Party was elected to a majority government in the October 2015 federal election, ending nine years of Conservative government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nLiberal Victory in Newfoundland and Labrador\n\nLiberal candidate Dwight Ball was elected premier of Newfoundland and Labrador in the province's 20th general provincial election. The Liberals won by a landslide, taking 31 of the province's 40 seats. The Conservatives, who had governed for the preceding 12 years, won seven seats and the NDP took two.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nSupreme Court Guarantees Expat Voting Rights\n\nIn a 5–2 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that expat Canadians can vote in federal elections regardless of how long they’ve lived outside the country. The ruling, which came a month after the Liberal government passed similar legislation, reversed a 1993 law and will likely prevent any future legislation from infringing on expat voting rights.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nTrudeau Shuffles Cabinet\n\nIn anticipation of the federal election in the fall, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau shuffled his Cabinet, moving Jody Wilson-Raybould from justice to veterans affairs, and naming Jane Philpott President of the Treasury Board and Minister of Digital Government. Trudeau called Philpott a “natural choice” for her new role and attempted to dispel the notion that Wilson-Raybould’s move was a demotion, saying, “She is extraordinarily capable of delivering on this file that is one of the core delivery mandates that the federal government has.”\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nJagmeet Singh Wins Burnaby South Byelection\n\nNDP leader Jagmeet Singh secured a seat in the House of Commons by winning a byelection in Burnaby South with 39 per cent of the vote, besting Liberal candidate Richard T. Lee’s (26 per cent) and Conservative candidate Jay Shin (22 per cent). Singh had accused Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of delaying the hotly contested election, which Singh needed to win in order to lead his party from within Parliament.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nProgressive Conservatives Score Upset Victory in Nova Scotia Election\n\nTim Houston led the Progressive Conservatives to an upset victory over the governing Liberals. The PCs took 38.44 per cent of the popular vote and increased their seat total in the 55-seat legislature from 17 to 31. The party took advantage of early campaign stumbles by the Liberals while tacking hard to the left, promising $553 million in health care spending. It was the sixth provincial or territorial election in Canada since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first in which the incumbent party lost.\n\nElections and Prime Ministers\n\nTrudeau and Liberals Win Third Term, Second Consecutive Minority\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe 36-day election campaign that began on 15 August finished in much the same way as the previous federal election in 2019 — with similar seat counts for all parties and a Liberal minority government. Erin O’Toole and the Conservatives had been in a statistical dead heat with the Liberals in late August and went on to narrowly win the popular vote for the second consecutive election. However, the bad press generated by an unfolding health crisis in Alberta under conservative premier Jason Kenney combined with the successful efforts of Maxime Bernier’s People’s Party of Canada to eat into the Conservatives’ vote share tipped the scales toward a Liberal victory. Following the election, many questioned the efficacy of spending more than $600 million on an election that replicated the status quo."
