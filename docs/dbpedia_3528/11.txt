The Lineup is a collection of up to 80 Mugshots, Smugshots, Event Mugshots and Photo Finishes. In the Lineup each collection is split into 20 images of each category (for example, 20 mugshots, 20 smugshots, etc.) Each image has an option to lock which will keep the image within the Lineup until it is unlocked. Once the maximum of 20 images for each category is reached then the oldest image will be replaced by the newest image acquired.
