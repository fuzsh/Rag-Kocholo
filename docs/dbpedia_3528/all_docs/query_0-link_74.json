        "text": "So I decided to buy Burnout Paradise today. And after one long sitting and one sore ass I decided to peel myself away from the game to talk about it.\n\nWhen I first started playing it was pretty intimidating being dumped in the middle of the city. I just cruised around for about an hour which was fun. I realised that the demo was so small compared to the actual game. And the demp was a pretty boring part of the city too. Ive managed to get a B license already and have unlocked about a dozen or so cars. Im probably going to try and get to an A license by tonight.\n\nSo far the game is great. This is probably up their with Burnout 2. My only complaint is that god damn DJ Atomica. What an asshole. Seriously, I dont need any of your bloody tips for racing. I know why I lost so just shut it! And the soundtrack to this game ranges from bad to cringy. Do I really want to be listening to Avril Lavigne while playing this game? No.\n\nThat's the one thing I didn't realize the PS3 version lacked when I picked it up--no custom soundtracks! If I had known that beforehand (if my 360 was working) I would have definitely went with the 360 version. Otherwise, game's great.\n\nAs for Atomica, he's ok. I kinda got used to him with the SSX series, so I thought it was actually pretty cool to have him in Paradise. He makes some SSX references now and then too. He also gives some hints to some of the hidden areas in the game.\n\nLast time I played it, over the weekend, I was going through the Burning Routes for all the cars I had unlocked at the time. (For those that don't know, completing a Burning Route unlocks an alternate version of the car used). In the process, I got a few of those 'Shut Down' missions and unlocked those cars, then did *their* Burning Routes. I think I have almost 40 cars now, and am less than 10 wins from my Class A license.\n\nShowtime mode is kind of different, and I don't use it seriously very much. I find I use it most often when I get lost during a race (showtime cancels whatever event you were doing), or if I crash during a normal drive while trying to get somewhere. The 'Wrecked' animation sequence is a little too long for me, so I usually just cancel out of it with a Showtime and keep bouncing along to my destination.\n\nI like how the different styles of cars seem to reflect the 3 numbered Burnout games. I like how you learn where things are as you play. The way the major start/finish lines correspond to the compass helps with that. I don't like having to look at the map all the time during an event since I don't know the routes that well yet. I have crashed many, many times during a race or burning route (and Showtime Cancel'd out of it) because of that. It would be nice if they had an option to make the map an overlay over a larger portion of the screen.\n\nI don't really have a problem with not being able to restart an event after you fail. It's something I got used to, and driving back to the start line (if you don't use a nearby race that will take you back there anyway) gives you an opportunity to do it a little slower and see any shortcuts.\n\nHaven't played Multiplayer very much, but the Freeburn mode is very much like Tony Hawk. You're constantly competing for the longest jump, longest drift, most barrel rolls, etc. I haven't done any of the structured co-op challenges yet.\n\nGreat Burnout game. Awesome with the Dual Shock 3. Just wish my PS3 version had Custom Soundtracks."
