        "text": "The Burnout series has always been injected with a healthy dose of testosterone when it comes to music. However, the featured artist on the soundtrack for the latest game in the series, Burnout Dominator, doesn't have a Y chromosome.\n\nElectronic Arts today announced that Avril Lavigne's new song \"Girlfriend\" will make its world premiere on the Burnout Dominator soundtrack. The pop star headlines a roster of 33 artists, which includes a mix of the old (Alice in Chains) and the new (The Sword). The full track listing is below.\n\nBurnout Dominator will be available on March 6 in North America and March 23 in Europe on the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. For more information on Burnout Dominator, read GameSpot's previous coverage."
