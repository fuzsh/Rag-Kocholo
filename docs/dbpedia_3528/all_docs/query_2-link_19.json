        "text": "The Classic Muscle is the only car players can start with in Burnout Dominator, but it proves itself to be the perfect learning car and an all-rounder vehicle.\n\nIts slippery enough to drift well, responsive enough to maneuver through traffic, and heavy enough to compete in a Road Rage, effectively making it a balanced car. Its acceleration and steering are average compared to other classics, but it isn't underpowered and can win any event.\n\nRepresented as a car of Black Gold Highway, the Classic Muscle has a Texas license plate that reads \"DO-CL-02\" (Dominator Classic 02).\n\nThe Classic Muscle comes in Red, Black and Brown.\n\nHow to Unlock[]\n\nAvailable from the beginning.\n\nResemblance[]\n\nThe basic shape of the Classic Muscle is similar to that of a 1971 Ford Mustang or a Chevelle SS. The headlights and grill are similar to the Stock C175 Super from Burnout Revenge.\n\nTrivia[]\n\nA video file found in the PlayStation 2 release suggests it may have been intended as an unlockable car at some point during development.[1]"
