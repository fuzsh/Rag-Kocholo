        "text": "My Facebook algorithms have figured out that I like to watch short videos of animals at the zoo, and today it showed us one of a lemur at the Nashville Zoo named Helios. Of course, I'm attached to the name Helios because he's a favorite character of ours in Sailor Moon, so that caught my attention, and I was like, \"But why Helios? What do lemurs have to do with the sun?\" And then I was like, \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nMany years ago, we wrote a note for the Sailor Moon Eternal Edition about Lemuria and what all it has to do with the Dead Moon Circus, which is the organization of bad guys that opposes Helios. So Helios is sort of tangentially related to lemurs, and it's possible that the keepers at the Nashville Zoo know that because of a note we wrote for Sailor Moon! In fact, the lower-priced version of that volume came out mere weeks before that very lemur was born, so we think the odds are pretty okay. And that means that aww, somebody noticed! Yay! (Or it's just a coincidence. But a pretty cool one.)\n\nIn other news, today we watched Fantomas Unleashed, the second in the movie trilogy of Fantomas. It was even better than the first one! It had more silliness, for one thing. We just like the mad-capped mayhem, I guess. Commissioner Juve's gadgets were ridiculous, and I love that they all actually came in handy. The pegleg machine gun was a surprise, too, and it was great. (I did notice that the camera conveniently never showed us the back of Juve's legs during those scenes. What happened to his foot!?)\n\nWe also really appreciated that there were so many different costumes in this one. So many disguises! And Fantomas's trap being at a costume party was the best. I love that the writers found an excuse to have non-period costumes. And Helene's was so pretty... (I did wonder about her taking the time to get that fancy hairdo for a party she didn't want to go to, though. Still, it was gorgeous.)\n\nThey didn't go into the whole \"building a man\" thing that Fantomas mentioned in the first movie, and now Lady Beltham apparently is dead? Of course Fantomas used the same word that Gabriel uses when talking about Emilie, so all the similarities are just like... Anyway, the way Fantomas will mention something almost in passing makes it seem like maybe he's got a whole life going on that we'll never get to know about because we're mostly following the good guys. And that's fine as far as writing goes (and is quite realistic), but it leaves me with so many questions.\n\nAnyway, Fantomas electrocuting all the Interpol guys via a farandole is simultaneously ridiculous and deadly serious, so I have very mixed feelings about that. It's funny, but also scary...\n\nIt's going to be a little while before we watch the third installment in the trilogy, because tomorrow is when the final season of The Umbrella Academy hits Netflix! We're pretty excited about that.\n\nToday I'm thankful for evidence that people read our translation notes (we used to write some really good ones before the burnout... (at least, we thought they were really good)), cute lemur videos, getting to watch Fantomas Unleashed, movies with costume parties, and the weather not being so hot today."
