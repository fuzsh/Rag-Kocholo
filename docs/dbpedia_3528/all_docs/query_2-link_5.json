        "text": "It was a long day at work, followed by a long evening of rehearsal. Laura had not returned from her bridge game, so I took the xBox, hooked it into the LCD projector, and played a ginormous version of Burnout Revenge. A couple of hours later, my thumbs were sore, I was on the verge of motion sickness, but my frustrations had been sated….at least for awhile.\n\nAs I drove I-85 to work this morning, I was disappointed to find that my Jetta was equipped with neither Crashbreaker explosives nor 208 MPH turboboost."
