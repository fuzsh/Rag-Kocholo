Soilleux takes over the reins in 2013 after being voted in as skipper at the club’s annual meeting on Monday night.

The 20-year-old takes over from Adam Fleming, who had nine years at the helm, and is confident of success in the Essex Cricket League next term.

“I’m very excited about being the new captain and looking forward to the challenge ahead,” said Soill-eux.

“I’m also confident that next season I will be able to bring success on the field with a young squad.”

He believes it is the right time for a change and said he had some fresh ideas to boost the team’s performances as they bid to win promotion from Division One in 2013.

Soilleux has represented the MCC Universities this season and also played for Essex County Cricket Club second XI.

He was also a member of the club’s under-16 match-play team which won the competition in 2008.

Roland Revell has replaced Richard Vickers as the club’s chairman. Vickers stood down after nine years in the position, while his replacement captain-ed the club back in the 1980s.

Henry Revell has taken over as club president following the retirement of Peter Ballard.

Ron Curtis remained as club secretary, a position he has held since 1982.
