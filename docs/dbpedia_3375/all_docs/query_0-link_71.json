        "text": "James Taylor wrote himself into the county’s record books by becoming only the tenth batsman to score a century on his first class debut for the club. After making nought in the first innings, the 22-year old scored an unbeaten 101 as his side posted a second innings total of 290-5 declared.\n\nLoughborough MCCU only had time for 13 overs of their second innings before heavy showers brought a premature conclusion to the contest with the visitors on 24-0 in their second innings.\n\nAfterwards, Taylor was pleased to get amongst the runs, having fallen to his first delivery on the opening day. “Obviously I’m delighted with how things have gone in the second innings. It’s never nice getting out early but I’m pleased to have responded with my first significant score for Nottinghamshire and turned it into a hundred.\n\n“I’m pleased with how I’m hitting the ball, especially at this stage of the season.”\n\nNottinghamshire began the morning by continuing their second innings from its overnight position of 183-2.\n\nUnder grey clouds, with a spot of drizzle in the air, Chris Read and James Taylor were quickly into their stride, taking nine from the opening over of the day.\n\nRead was clearly intent on putting bat to ball and began the second over by pulling the left-armer Robert Taylor for six into the deserted New Stand. The lack of spectators wasn’t helpful as it took the Loughborough side several minutes to locate the ball.\n\nThe eleventh ball of the morning brought Read’s downfall (28), slashing firmly to the diving Endersby at point.\n\nPaul Franks, who made 19 in the first innings, was promoted to number five and hit his first delivery to the ropes but on 16 he mistimed an attempted pull and nicked one to the ‘keeper to give Taylor his second success of the session.\n\nBen Phillips (15) fell to the same bowler, losing his off stump after three powerful blows rocketed to the fence.\n\nTaylor meanwhile had accumulated nicely at the other end and reached his century (199 mins, 124 balls, 15x4) with a firm punch behind square on the off-side, from the bowling of Adam Soilleux.\n\nThe 22-year old joined the nine other players to have scored a ton on their first class debut for Notts, Freddie Stocks, Keith Miller, Chris Broad, Mark Crawley, Jonathan Wileman, Jimmy Adams, Greg Blewett, David Hussey and Steven Mullaney\n\nAfter the applause had died down Read declared, with his side holding an advantage of 670 runs, with Taylor unbeaten on 101 and Graeme White on 19 not out at the other end.\n\nWith the replay screen announcing that ‘Loughborough MCCU need 671 runs to win’ their openers began again and reached 28-0. Either side of lunch, at which point heavy showers brought a premature conclusion to the contest."
