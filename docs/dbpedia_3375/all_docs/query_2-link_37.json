        "text": "MCC complete their overseas touring programme for 2019 later this week when a thirteen-man squad departs for Sierra Leone.\n\nThe thirteen-day trip – which will see MCC play both 50-over and T20 cricket on the trip – is the first tour the Club has sent to Sierra Leone since 2003.\n\nThe squad of MCC Playing Members has been selected from a variety of areas from across the UK and Ireland. They will travel to the capital Freetown, where they will be met by the President of Sierra Leone, before training ahead of a busy playing programme across the fortnight.\n\nThe touring party will play a pair of matches against the Sierra Leone Under-19 team in the T20 and 50-over formats respectively, either side of a visit to the provinces where the squad will undertake a coaching session at the Mokonde Grounds in Njala.\n\nMCC will then face the Sierra Leone national team in a 50-over match and two T20 matches, before ending the tour with a T20 against a Combined XI and another 50-over clash with the national side. All matches will be played at the Prince of Wales Grounds in Freetown.\n\nSierra Leone became an Affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and an Associate nation in 2017. MCC has a long-standing relationship with the Sierra Leone Cricket Association (SLCA) having toured the West African nation several times prior to the most recent visit in 2003. The Club donated cricket nets and flooring to the SLCA in 2011 which were previously in use within the MCC Cricket Academy at Lord’s.\n\nThe squad will be captained by Gus Kennedy, who has represented both Cambridge and Oxford Universities in first-class cricket.\n\n“Our relationships with nations such as Sierra Leone form an important part of developing talent around the globe\"\n\nThe Tour Manager for the trip is Jamie Clifford, MCC Assistant Secretary (Membership & Operations), who said:\n\n“Overseas tours are extremely important for our club. Using MCC’s global reach, they continue our commitment to developing the game in areas of the world where the sport is less popular.\n\n“Our relationships with nations such as Sierra Leone form an important part of developing talent around the globe and we are keen to ensure the tour is a success, inspiring local and touring cricketers alike.”\n\nMCC has recently returned from Nepal (the first of three “Legacy Tours” to the country) and also visited Costa Rica and Mexico in 2019. The 2020 touring programme will get underway in January with a tour to Argentina.\n\nFollow the Tour\n\nTour Party\n\nJamie Clifford – Tour Manager\n\nGus Kennedy – Captain\n\nNick Anderson (Didsbury CC)\n\nSam Arthurton (Great Witchingham CC)\n\nJordan Bulpitt (Walsall CC)\n\nAndrew Curtis (Weybridge CC)\n\nToby Drummond (Burton Leonard CC)\n\nRobin Fisher (Chester Boughton Hall CC)\n\nPeter Richer (Thriplow CC)\n\nFionn Hand (Cricket Leinster)\n\nEdward Jones (MCC)\n\nRyan Lewis (Belvoir CC)\n\nAdam Soilleux (Hadleigh and Thundersley CC)\n\nJack Parish (Buckingham Town CC)\n\nChris Watts – Umpire\n\nFixtures"
