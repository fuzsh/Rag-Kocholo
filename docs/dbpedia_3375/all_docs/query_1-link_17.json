The commercial viability of women’s football is a hot topic. While there is major debate around the structures behind the European game, the US seems to be onto something… Angel City Football Club’s recent $250m sale to The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger demonstrates the value to be had where buy-in price is still attractive. A rising tide lifts all boats. This week, we bring it all together: 🇺🇲 Rise of women’s football in the US ⚽ How do you buy an NWSL franchise? 🌎 NWSL as an emerging player in global sport 🌟 Female athletes as wider cultural icons With the New York Football Giants also in the family sporting portfolio, this is an ownership who know how to build value in sporting organisations!

Here's what brands need to know👇 🏀The WNBA reached 5.7M+ Canadians over the past 12 months, this new franchise will accelerate growth from coast-to-coast: https://lnkd.in/gtmBWBRv 🏆 The W is already a strong and established basketball property in the country - within and beyond the basketball landscape: https://lnkd.in/gpehc3bA 🎯The W's most engaged audiences represent important segments that brands will value connecting with through sponsorship: https://lnkd.in/gvUu5_JY 🚗I'm betting there will be a significant partnership announcement with an automotive partner before the franchise hits the court for the first time: https://lnkd.in/g8J-72kq 💰So what's an expansion sponsorship going to be worth? Reach out for a perspective. #sponsorship #wnbaintoronto\n\nLed by Toronto billionaire Larry Tanenbaum’s Kilmer Sports Venture, the team will begin play in 2026. It will use the 8,000-seat Coca-Cola Coliseum as its home arena. The Toronto franchise will be the WNBA’s first based outside of the United States. The league has played exhibition games in Canada in the past two seasons, including in Toronto in 2023. WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert called the exhibition a “seminal moment” for the league in its desire to expand a global platform. A WNBA franchise has been a thorny issue inside Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, the multi-pronged ownership group that runs the Toronto Maple Leafs, Toronto Raptors, Toronto FC, Toronto Marlies, Raptors 905 and Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League. The expansion into the Canadian market also comes amid a period of significant growth in the WNBA. As viewership numbers are skyrocketing to record highs and a new crop of potential stars enter the league, the WNBA announced that it would be instituting a full-charter program beginning this season. Philadelphia, Portland, Ore., Denver, Nashville, Tenn., Charlotte, N.C., and South Florida are other places the league is exploring as options for expansion. #DrexelSBIZ #SportBusiness #WNBA #Toronto #TorontoRaptors #NBA #Basketball #CaitlinClark #AngelReese\n\nScottish Football - MCO Link Minority Investors Hibernian & Black Knight Football Group (BKFG) *Landmark ruling Feb involving Hibernian and the Scottish FA approved BKFG 25% acquisition of Hibs for £6m under a dual interest dispensation request from Hibs under Article 13. *Article 13 (Dual Interests in Clubs) states with the consent of the SFA Board” No one person, who owns existing shares in another club within UEFA to hold more than 9.9% in a Scottish club. *The SFA has been under pressure to reconsider and although no official announcement, a case by case behind closed doors approach will be adopted.

But how did this all come along? As usual: there is this one person behind all of it :) Tony Bloom, a self-made billionaire and former sports bettor, has driven Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.'s rise to success. Here’s a closer look at Brighton and Tony's impact: 𝐀𝐜𝐪𝐮𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐈𝐧𝐯𝐞𝐬𝐭𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 In 2009, Bloom acquired a 75% stake in Brighton & Hove Albion, investing approximately £93 million to develop the new Amex Stadium. The total value of the club supposedly exceeds £500mn in 2024. 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚-𝐃𝐫𝐢𝐯𝐞𝐧 𝐒𝐭𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐞𝐠𝐲 - 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐒𝐭𝐚𝐫𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐫𝐝 𝐒𝐨𝐟𝐭𝐰𝐚𝐫𝐞 Bloom's ownership includes leveraging his expertise in data analytics through his company, Starlizard. This consultancy uses advanced algorithms to identify undervalued players and make informed transfer decisions. For instance: - Alexis Mac Allister: Acquired for £7.5 mn, sold for £35 mn - Yves Bissouma: Bought for £15mn sold for £20 mn - Marc Cucurella: Signed for £15mn sold for £62 mn - Moises Caicedo: Purchased for £5mn sold for £115mn 𝐎𝐧-𝐅𝐢𝐞𝐥𝐝 𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬 Bloom’s strategies have translated into remarkable on-field success. Brighton secured promotion to the Premier League in the 2016-17 season and finished 6th in the 2022-23 season, qualifying for the UEFA Europa League for the first time in the club's history. Tony Bloom’s blend of passion, strategic foresight, and data-driven decision-making has not only redefined Brighton & Hove Albion’s fortunes but also set a benchmark in sports management.

The injection of capital from prominent sports owners, including those from the Boston Red Sox and Liverpool FC, may give the PGA Tour leverage in negotiations and potentially allow it to remain separate from the Saudi-backed LIV Golf. The involvement of high-profile investors and the players being offered direct ownership in PGA Tour Enterprises add layers to the evolving landscape of golf's business dynamics. How do you think the involvement of Fenway Sports Group and other high-profile investors in the PGA Tour, along with the creation of PGA Tour Enterprises, will influence the future of professional golf and its potential merger with LIV Golf? https://lnkd.in/eGJYbmts LIV Golf PGA TOUR Fenway Sports Group Blue Chip Sports Management Marymount Sports X Marymount Storytellers Golf Saudi Liverpool Football Club Saudi Golf Federation Jason Nicola Boston Red Sox #business #sportsbusiness #golf #mergers ESPN CBS Golf GolfNow Sports Business Journal Sportico Callaway Golf Acushnet Company / Titleist Golf TaylorMade Golf Company Bridgestone Golf"
