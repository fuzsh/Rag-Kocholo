        "text": "A doctor who spent just 30 minutes conducting an autopsy on an 85-year-old woman has been labelled as “negligent” by a fellow pathologist, an inquest has heard. Dr Michael Heath appeared at Surrey Coroner's Court in Woking on Thursday (June 16) as part of the hearing into the death of Reigate resident Deidre Hicks. She was an in-patient at East Surrey Hospital when she died on July 6, 2020.\n\nGiving evidence in the morning, Dr Heath was questioned on why he gave the cause of her death as an acute kidney injury when another examination four months later ruled it was due to an intestinal haemorrhage and aspiration pneumonia. He defended himself arguing the weight of her lungs showed pneumonia had not played a part in her death.\n\nHowever, this was contradicted by Dr Elizabeth Soilleux who carried out another autopsy on Mrs Hicks in January 2021. Unlike Dr Heath, she undertook a test of lung tissue, called histology, which showed the signs of aspiration pneumonia while also finding evidence of an intestinal haemorrhage.\n\nREAD MORE: Bereaved family's distress after post-mortem by discredited pathologist made them think they'd buried wrong body\n\nDr Soilleux said: “That is negligent - not to dissect the lungs. When you look at lungs normally they will collapse because they are filled with air. If the lungs don't collapse then they are by definition abnormal. This is the case here. It was blatantly obvious there was a big problem here that hadn’t been seen.”\n\nDr Heath also stated during his testimony he did not carry out the lung tissue test as it would cost too much money to do so. He also said he had not studied Mrs Hicks' medical notes before the autopsy, which was around 30 minutes long, and admitted he could not fully remember doing it due to the number of cases he was given.\n\nBut in a bizarre twist, after his testimony, staff at the coroner’s office were called into the hearing to state any histology test would not incur any additional cost while insisting all pathologists are handed access to medical reports before they undertake an autopsy. Defending himself, he said he was an experienced doctor who had been involved in the practice since 1970.\n\nDr Heath said: “Clearly I don't want to be critical here but when you do a second post-mortem objectives are different. I’ve done 20,0000 cases and your procedure is completely different. The other doctor has said it wasn't easy to make a judgement because of the state of the post-mortem. I can see what is being mentioned but I don’t agree with the conclusion.”\n\nLast year, Dr Heath was referred to an interim orders tribunal at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service. He still has a licence to practice but under several conditions that include a clinical supervisor having to supervise him in all of his posts.\n\nSpeaking after a “gruelling” four days of testimony from not only the doctors but from Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust, which runs East Surrey Hospital, Surrey County Council and Surrey Police, Mrs Hicks's daughter, Rebecca Rees, said she hoped the trial would bring change to practises in the county. Coroner Anna Loxton will now receive written submissions and will give her final conclusions next week.\n\nMs Rees said: “You have the opportunity to be heard for which I’m grateful. I have certainly been grateful to Ann Loxton for her sensitivity and for understanding the issues I have been trying to bring to the attention of the Surrey coroner. It’s been a long journey to get to this point but I am starting to feel I am being heard.”\n\nRead next\n\n‘No closure’ for family as Surrey Coroner’s Court held inquest without their knowledge\n\nSurrey NHS trust contributed to Guildford teen's death by 'neglect' and jury declares how it failed him\n\nBrain injury charity showed 'lack of transparency' over five-year-old's cot death, coroner says"
