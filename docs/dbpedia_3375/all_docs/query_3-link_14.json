        "meta_description": "Earlier this month the Club Towers Golf Day took place in perfectly sunny conditions at Bedford & County Golf Club in Clapham. 17 players were grouped into 5 teams and there were some excellent scores posted. A particular highlight was Adam Soilleux’s back nine score of 38 shots … just 2 over par. As is customary the 19th hole gathering with drinks and ham, egg and chips rounded off the day perfectly. The individual winner was Salil Haridas, completing his round in a net 65 shots (41 points), narrowly pipping Esteban Stewart and Jools Cooper by one point. Well done guys! The combined team winners were Team 2 (Daniel Emkes, Babs Rai and Salil Haridas) with 85 points, all three players accumulating steady points through the round. A simultaneous yellow ball event took place, won by Team 1 (Adam Soilleux, Simon Lowe and Jon Dey) on 38 points, followed by Team 5 (Phaedra and Peter Schofield, Esteban Stewart and Niall Hamshere) on 20 points. The ‘Nearest The Pin’ prize on 5th hole was won by Adam Soilleux. The ‘Longest Drive’ prize on 17th hole was won by Daniel Emkes. Full score sheet can be found here. Well played all. We hope to see you again next year!",
