Reflecting all four of our departments – Corporate, Litigation, Restructuring and Tax, Executive Compensation & Benefits – the awards hail from leading legal and business media – including The American Lawyer, Law360, National Law Journal, The Financial Times and top international trade publications – in categories such as “Lawyer of the Year,” “Dealmaker of the Year,” “Top Trial Lawyer,” “Outstanding Restructuring Lawyer” and “Trailblazer.”\n\nThe awards also attest to Weil partners’ excellence in various practice areas – including antitrust, appeals and strategic counseling, banking and finance, capital markets, class action litigation, complex commercial litigation, corporate governance/securities regulation, employment, IP, life sciences, M&A, patent litigation, private equity, private funds, real estate, restructuring, securities litigation, tax, technology and white collar defense.\n\nNotably, 44 women partners earned 86 accolades – including “Notable Women in Law,” “Top Women in Litigation,” “Women Dealmakers Hall of Fame” and several wins at Euromoney’s “Women in Business Law Americas Awards.”\n\nWeil’s next generation of legal leaders was also recognized – 16 partners earned “Rising Star,” “40 Under 40,” “Emerging Leader” and similar distinctions."
