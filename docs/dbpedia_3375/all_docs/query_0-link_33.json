        "text": "Saturday 24/06\n\nColchester and East Essex CC cruised to a comfortable victory over Hadleigh & Thundersley in the Hamro Foundation Essex Premier League. The Colchester Man of the Match was Kiwi leg spinner, Adi Ashok, who took 4/42 in 19.4 overs and then smashed 64 in merely 38 balls with the bat. Sadly, C & EE will be without his services for the last three matches of the season as he has been called up to play for the New Zealand A XI against Australia A. Ashok was well supported by swing bowler Vikas Argawal (3-32), then Guy Haines (46 not out) and Simon Fernandes (34 not out).\n\nC & EE remain in second place as current league leaders Hornchurch CC also won, but that sets up a tasty fixture next week when the two clubs clash at Hornchurch Park. The next First XI home game opportunity to see and meet Adi Ashok is at Castle Park on Saturday 8th July, when the visitors are Hutton CC. Start, 11.00, free admission, bar open all afternoon.\n\nHadleigh & Thundersley 170 all out (57.4 overs). 5 points\n\nAdam Soilleux 39\n\nCameron Shekleton 38\n\nAdi Ashok 4/42\n\nVikas Agaway 3/32.\n\nColchester & East Essex 173-3 (26.4 overs). 20 points.\n\nAdi Ashok 64\n\nGuy Haines 46 not out\n\nSimon Fernandes 34 not out.\n\nAdam Dobson 2/48\n\nLive stream and video clips at https://colchesteree.play-cricket.com/website/results/5791231\n\n[Post edited 24 Jun 2023 23:07]"
