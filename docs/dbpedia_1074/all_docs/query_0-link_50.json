        "text": "A little humble footnote on Marty’s passing from Montana: 20 or so years ago, I coached a local youth hockey travel team in Bozeman, along with John Anaker and Mitch Billis. Our team, unlike others in the league, had boys and girls. In many ways, we were ragtag, resembling a version of the Bad News Bears, quirky, underrated and less skilled than teams from other larger programs in towns like Billings and Missoula. What our kids lacked in cumulative talent, they made up for by being scrappy and spirted. Somehow what emerged among them was chemistry. Everyone made important contributions and the two girls on our team—Ahlea Billis and Lila Livingston—were inspiring and played fearlessly despite boys from other teams taunting them and trying to intimidate them with their physicality. By dint of miracle, we won the regular league title. In route to the state tournament, Marty Pavelich, who was living with wife,Marjorie, in Big Sky, heard about our team. They had retired there because they loved to ski. In advance of the state tournament, Marty showed up at our last practice, laced on his skates and joined in a game of pickup—our 16 kids being able to share the ice with a four-time Stanley Cup champion, teammate of Gordie Howe (who had been Wayne Gretzky's boyhood hero) and other Red Wing greats now in the NHL Hall of Fame. We went into the tournament as underdogs, because other teams still thought what our kids did was a fluke. Marty helped fire them up. Marjorie told them she was a fan, too, and let Ahlea and Lila know how impressed she was with them. Well, we somehow reached the championship game but our Cinderella run came to an end. We lost 1-0 in a nailbiter to Billings. Marty phoned us in the locker room to tell the kids that they shouldn’t feel down, and how proud he was of them; he said he too had lost big games and he praised their grit. He signed the kids' jerseys as well as pucks and hats for every player. When I would see him over the years that followed, he always asked about how those players were doing. He emulated the notion of \"hockey for life\" and forever had God’s game in his heart. One final thing: he sung the virtues not of organized hockey but pond hockey, the kind he played on outdoor ice as a kid growing up in Canada. That’s where the true fun happens. In Big Sky today, there’s a sheet of ice named after him. Marty Pavelich, age 96, RIP\n\nTrout rising...look closely, just to the right of the trees reflected in the water and just below the two rocks, and you see can the ripples created by feeding fish in the translucent pool. This is a painting titled \"The West I Know\" by Len Chmiel. Few things are more soothing than the cool colors of morning sunlight reflecting off river cobblestone bouncing toward the surface, and watching trout move fluidly through the space. Had the French Impressionists an eye for such water and had they painted the American West with an appreciation for such things, they would've painted them like this. The piece appeared last weekend at the Prix de West in Oklahoma City and it was a pleasure to see its texture—and Chmiel—in person. He's one of our finest Western landscape painters. You can find more works like this in his recent book, \"Len Chmiel: an authentic nature.\" lenchmiel.com"
