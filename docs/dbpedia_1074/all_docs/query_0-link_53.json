It begins with an analysis of the visual evidence of Minoan kingship and proceeds to show that the Minoan templates are almost identical to those of N. Syria and Anatolia. A case is made that the Minoan kings are depicted as either divine rulers or as high priests.\n\nThe discussion next turns to the form and syntax of the Minoan ideograms. They are compared to similar ones from Egypt and the Near East and it is argued that they have similar meanings. Even the mysterious double axe is made more comprehensible. Cosmology is considered next. It is suggested that the core of Minoan cosmology is solar worship. Royal and cosmic and royal symbolism converge: the king is the earthly representative of the sun deity. The Minoan goddess, whose emblem is the double axe, is shown to be a solar deity. Female sun goddesses exist also among the Hittites, the peoples of Ugarit and Egypt.\n\nTaureador Scenes in Tell El-Dab’a (Avaris) and Knossos\n\n(co-authored with Manfred Bietak and Clairy Palyvou).\n\nAustrian Academy of Sciences- Vienna, 2007\n\nThis book (co-authored with Manfred Bieatak and Clairy Palyvou) is the publication of the Minoan bull leaping scenes found in Tel el Dab’a, Egypt. The paintings are compared to those of Knossos and are found to be very similar in style and content. The publication includes a new study and catalogue of the taureador paintings from Knossos itself.\n\nThe sport represented is analyzed; it is argued that all the leapers are male and that they represent slender youths as well as more muscular young adults. By their acrobatic feat, the men honor the Great Goddess of Crete. She is shown to be a solar goddess and a patroness of kings.\n\nThe Goddess and the Warrior: The Naked Goddess and Mistress of Animals in Early Greek Religion\n\nRoutledge. London 2000\n\nThe book explores the unusual iconographical formula of Archaic Greek art that naked and seductive female goddesses are juxtaposed to fully armed warriors. What is the function of this juxtaposition?\n\nThe main argument of the book is that male armament and female sexuality are two alternative forms of power. They may be combined to create an inseparable unified force or may be opposed and combat each other. Both mythical and iconographical material is explored. Parallels from Near Eastern art and myth are used to demonstrate the pattern in a broad East Mediterranean perspective.\n\nGreek Sanctuaries (with R. Hägg)\n\nRoutledge. London 1995\n\nA collection of essays written by both historians of religion and archaeologists.\n\nMinoan Religion: Ritual, Image, and Symbol (Studies in Comparative Religion)\n\nUniversity of South Carolina Press 1993\n\nThis book is an attempt to bring together diverse types of evidence about Minoan religion. Unlike the famous work by M.P. Nilsson, Minoan and Mycenaean Religion (1950) which was based on archaeological and iconographical typology, this work attempts to organize the evidence around social questions such as priesthood. Also, it asks the question of how the sanctua .\n\nMinoan Sacrificial Ritual\n\nActa Instituti Atheniensis Regni Sueciae, series in 8. Stockholm 1986\n\nThis work contains an analysis of archaeological and visual evidence pertaining to Minoan sacrifice. The questions addressed are: who took part in the sacrifice? Where did the sacrifice take place? What animals were sacrificed?\n\nThe most important aspect is the attempt to decipher obscure ideograms of Minoan seals which are viewed here as a system of signs.\n\nArt and Religion in Thera\n\nMathioulakis, Athens 1984"
