        "text": "DENVER — Wilkinson Barker Knauer, LLP (WBK) is pleased to announce that Arthur M. Ortegon is joining the firm as a Partner in the Denver, CO, office. Arthur brings a wealth of expertise in municipal, state, and federal policy and regulatory issues. With a decade of public sector experience, Arthur has held appointments in Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock’s Office, the Colorado General Assembly under State Representative Cheri Gerou, Colorado Governor Jared Polis’ Office, and the George W. Bush White House. Arthur’s experience includes government relations, legal, regulatory, political, community investment, and external affairs operations within telecommunications, transportation, and mass media sectors. Out of law school, Arthur clerked for Justice Nathan “Ben” Coats of the Colorado Supreme Court. He served as a Congressional Relations Assistant in the General Services Administration under President George W. Bush.\n\nArthur received his J.D. from Washington College of Law at American University and a B.A. in political science and psychology from University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“Arthur is a terrific addition to Team WBK for DC and Denver clients alike,” said WBK Managing Partner Bryan N. Tramont. “His deep and diverse experience in government and regulatory affairs add a new dimension to our practice as we navigate changes in the local, state, and federal regulatory landscape. Arthur’s dynamism, leadership, and intellect, combined with his enthusiasm for solving problems, makes this an exciting day for the Firm.”\n\n“Arthur brings a new depth and focus to WBK with his experience in state and local regulatory affairs,” added Ray Gifford, Managing Partner of WBK‘s Denver office. “Our clients will benefit from his insight and relationships across Colorado, the West and the whole country. Plus, it’s always great to welcome a native of Pueblo into the WBK fold.”\n\n“I am thrilled to bring my extensive government and external affairs experience to WBK, along with my legal expertise gaining operating authority for business expansion with municipal, county, and state governments,” said Arthur. “There is an already-deep team of government relations and public affairs experts within the firm who have a proven track record of creating outcome-driven strategies and building effective advocacy campaigns for their clients and I look forward to augmenting these efforts.”"
