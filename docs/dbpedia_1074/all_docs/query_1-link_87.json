        "text": "Southern Gospel Music has no greater ambassador than The Kingdom Heirs. They have introduced thousands to their music through their daily shows at Dollywood for the past 36 years. The group has been excellent over those years, with minimal personnel changes.\n\nThe current nucleus of Lead singer Arthur Rice, Bass vocalist Jeff Chapman, and Loren Harris on Baritone added Tenor Vocalist Jacob Ellison last Year and I believe this is their best lineup to date.\n\nThe project kicks off with the title cut, which is the first single. The group takes the first verse and chorus and are joined by The 3 Heath Brothers on the second verse and chorus. The song gets up and goes, with some nice horns on the arrangement. Next is up is a nice mid tempo number, “The Gospel Truth“, which features Chapman on the verses and Ellison and Chapman on the chorus. Ellison is a newcomer to SG, and I love his tones on this song, very similar to Kirk Talley in certain tones, especially the last key change after the bridge.\n\nThe pace picks up on “He’s Making Good”, which features Rice. It’s hard to believe that Arthur has been the lead singer of the KH for 27 Years! But believe me when I say he sounds better than ever, and he absolutely crushes this song. Things slow down a bit for “A Heaven Frame of Mind”, which features Harris. I really enjoyed this bluesy song, penned by the late great Dianne Wilkinson, and the first of 4 songs she penned that you’ll find on the project.\n\nNext up is another Wilkinson song, “God Knows How Much Mercy I Need”, which features Rice. Some fans may remember this one from when Mark Trammell Quartet recorded it back in 2010, but this is a great cut that the group changed up a bit, and I love the ending they put on this with Ellison. Speaking of Jacob, he’s featured on the next song, the up-tempo “Jesus Is Enough”, written by the groups drummer Dennis Murphy. Jacob takes the verses while Chapman leads the chorus.\n\n“Tell Me Again” is a mid tempo tune, that features Rice. Harris is featured again on the uptempo “Never Changing God” and what a great song. Loren has been a home run for the KH, an awesome addition who gives has given the group another dimension vocally. Things slow down for the next cut, “What You Could Never Get Over”, which features Ellison. When I initially heard this song, I thought the group was covering a Black Gospel/CCM song. When I got my physical copy, I was shocked and amazed to see the song was written by Rodney Griffin. There is so much I want to say about this song, in fact I have another post dedicated to this song that I will post this weekend, but I want to include my thoughts here as well. Jacob Ellison is a breath of fresh air to SG Industry, this guy is awesome. He’s got the power to sing high but he also can sing a lyric like this with the tenderness the arrangement calls for. I mentioned earlier that some of his tones reminded me of Kirk Talley, while on this song his tones reminded me of the great Steve Perry from Journey. He put so much soul into this performance and it shows. Both the lyrics of the song and the performance are MUST HEAR! I really hope Crossroads sends this song to radio, it’s a message that will connect to folks. Stay tuned for my next post, you won’t want to miss it. Now, back to the review.\n\nThe pace picks up a bit with a shuffling mid tempo quartet tune, “He Worked It Out”, which features Chapman and Ellison. I cannot go any further in this review without complimenting Jeff. It’s also hard to believe Chapman has been with the KH for 20 Years, singing bass. Jeff is without a doubt in my mind, the best bass singer in our business. He can sing lower than anybody you can think of, past or present, in the history of our Genre, but he can also sing in his upper register as good as anyone too. He may not win the fan awards, but there is no doubt in our industry that Jeff Chapman is THE Best bass singer in our industry. The project comes to a close with a great energetic song, “What My God Can Do”, which features Ellison. It’s an enjoyable song, but then the encore comes in, and Jacob goes into the stratosphere. All I could say is, “wow”. I write this review, letting my “worldly musical influences” come out a bit, but I can only compare the high note Jacob hits to one song I’ve heard in my life, “The Great Gig In The Sky” by Pink Floyd. If you know, you know.\n\nThe Kingdom Heirs are one of the most solid and dependable groups in our genre, you know when you listen to their music you will hear a great quartet recording. As always, the song selection, vocals, and performances captured on this project displays what I as a Gospel Music fan love about the KH and what keeps me listening. I believe they are the strongest they’ve ever been vocally, this lineup has no weak links. One of the most refreshing things about this project, in my opinion, is to have a group of the stature of The Kingdom Heirs, bring in a guy that is fresh blood, a new name and face in our industry, who is obviously talented. THIS is what we need in SG! We’ve got too many groups bringing back the best guy they know that retired 2-3 years ago and keeping the pool of talent small and relative to a few names. But getting some young people who are talented, excited about this music, and want to minister in this capacity is what SG needs and I’m glad to see it in Jacob and The Kingdom Heirs.\n\nIn closing, I really enjoyed listening to “I Feel A Good Day Coming On” and believe it to be the best album released in 2021. Please be sure to pick up a physical copy of the cd, stream it or download it, whatever you do. If you’ve heard this project already, share your thoughts with me, I’d love to hear from you!\n\nA review copy was not provided.\n\nIt’s been a while since I’ve done a post in this series, but I wanted to discuss a great song that maybe you haven’t heard but definitely need to check out. On the latest and final recording from The Old Paths, Stay, the group recorded a fantastic song entitled How Great The Debt. Written by Dianne Wilkinson and Rebecca Peck and sung masterfully by lead singer Tim Rackley, it’s a powerful song and reminder of just how awesome and great the debt of our sin truly was.\n\nI asked Dianne where the inspiration came for the lyrics of the song, “I remember pondering one day on the enormity of the suffering of Our Lord on the cross, and all during the long night before the awful day. I wondered for just a moment why he couldn’t have had a different kind of death…more merciful. And it seemed that God immediately answered my question…”the cost had to be high, because that’s how great and grievous the sin debt was”. It is also true that His suffering was prophesied in the Bible. I wanted to write about that great debt. I don’t recall exactly how long it took to write the lyrics I sent to Becky. But it was less than 30 minutes. Every time I hear someone mention some deed or sacrament that has to be done by man before he can be saved, my first thought is “then why did Jesus have to suffer as He did to be able to say of the Plan of Salvation, “It is finished“? No. Jesus paid it ALL!”\n\nCo-writer Rebecca Peck shared, “I remember we were talking on the phone about the idea and she (Dianne) was saying that we focus on the debt being paid so much, and we should, but we don’t stop enough to think about how much it really cost him and how great our debt really was. She, of course, sent a killer lyric. I wrote the music on New Years Eve 2012. The irony of the song was that we used a snippet of the hymn Jesus Paid It All as the bridge, and that song was also written on New Year’s Eve!\n\nAs we approach the Christmas season and celebrate the birth of Christ, I can’t help but think about the very reason he was born. He came here to die, to pay my sin debt and yours as well. May this song cause you to think about the great debt that Jesus paid with his life, and rejoice in that. My thanks to both Dianne Wilkinson and Rebecca Peck for their time and being so gracious in sharing their story behind this great song. Take a listen to the song below and share this with a friend!"
