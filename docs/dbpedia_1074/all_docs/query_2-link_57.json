        "text": "Arthur Wilkinson, his wife Elizabeth Wiley, and their 7 children left Poyntzpass, for Canada c1830. Arthur, a Chelsea Pensioner, had witnessed a murder, and later testified against the accused. A few months later, while he was away on business , his house in the “Far Pass”, was set afire, live coals being tossed on the thatched roof. Luckily his family escaped, thanks to the quick response by neighbours, who helped put out the flames, the Newry Canal was nearby.\n\nArthur’s military records indicate he was from Aghaderg. The account of the murder and trial, and arson were widely published in area newspapers. I am a direct female line descendant of Elizabeth Wiley Wilkinson, through their daughter Matilda. The family settled in Essa Township, Simcoe County, Ontario, Canada, where they prospered and had many descendants.\n\nCarolyn Hudson.\n\nCarolyn can you edit in the dates of birth and death please?
