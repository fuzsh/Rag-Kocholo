        "text": "I still haven’t watched The Full Monty: it has the feel of a pub turn or a matinee with Auntie. I noticed Tom Wilkinson in The Patriot, a rebarbative stew of jingoism, cruelty, and sentimentality that of course starred Mel Gibson and in which the Yorkshire-born actor played General Cornwallis like Pinochet in a powdered wig. The more films I watch the warier I become at the mention of “range,” or, rather, the fetishizing of range. He had the Claude Rains and Gene Hackman talent for being himself — anonymous and schlubby, Albert Finney without the air of dissipation — in heroic and malevolent roles, as a Benjamin Franklin who steers through and around a galaxy of egos and a manic corporate lawyer who thinks he’s Howard Beale.\n\nBut Wilkinson had power: a sonorous bull when bestirred. I can believe the following tweet:\n\nI come back to his priapic Benjamin Franklin in the HBO miniseries John Adams. Neither a wax doll in a Ripley’s museum nor a dispenser of Yankee platitudes, Wilkinson’s Franklin sees deeper than most of his colleagues but the wisdom hasn’t resulted in a swelled head. He laughs because he takes life too seriously — unlike Mr. Adams, an expert at self-abasement. In my favorite scene Franklin corrects, delicately, Thomas Jefferson’s prose, then like a master diplomat pivots to commending Jefferson’s invention of the swivel chair. We can understand why French aristocrats swooned over him before bedding him.\n\nWilkinson wasn’t an actor to inspire swoons: he believed in the work. Remember him thusly."
