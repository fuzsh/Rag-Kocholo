        "text": "The search for water has been the life-sustaining quest for all beings. This photograph depicts the convergence of two groups – the Maasai herdsmen with their cattle and a herd of elephant – on a common watering hole.\n\nNOTE: WE ARE PROUD TO HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COP21-PARIS 2015 EXHIBITION. PLEASE TAKE A MOMENT AND SEE MORE EXTRAORDINARY WORK BY PHOTOGRAPHERS FROM ALL OVER THE WORLD: COP21 – PARIS 2015\n\nADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE LEGACY–LUCIE FOUNDATION CURATES PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION HIGHLIGHTING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.\n\nCuratorial Statement: Photography in the hands of great artists can transmit a visual message that can make an impact, like no other medium. A single still image is capable of saying something so profound that its effect is undeniably felt by all people. The artistic expression may be an individual one, but an image can be universally understood, and resonate around the world. The Lucie Awards is honored to have been asked to curate and present exceptional images that do just that.\n\nFor the UN Climate Change Legacy Exhibition, we have called upon renowned photographers who have dedicated their lives to documenting melting icebergs, drought, air, water, waste pollution and the undeniable effects these things have had on our planet. It is a condensed, compassionate plea, through their lenses, of the effects of climate change.\n\nTheir images may be startlingly beautiful, which can complicate the horrific message they convey, but look beyond the amazing artistry and try to understand the subliminal ideas within these framed works. Bravo to these brilliant image-makers who challenge us with their documentary record of what is taking place. It has been a privilege to curate their works for the COP21. We have been humbled by their clarity and consistent endeavour to keep shouting to the world to do something.

Age 12\n\nSilent steps of evolution, highest height of all the world.\n\nOf all the world a graceful trot,\n\nso fast, yet so slow through the savannah,\n\nwhere the elephants trumpet and blow.\n\nYour long purple tongue so strong, and so speechless\n\nyou eat the thorns of a tree of a foliage,\n\nthat resembles barbed wire fence.\n\nIf you could speak, you would tell us,\n\nthe ways of living in peace, with no menacing gaze.\n\nIf you could speak, my friend, you would tell us\n\nhow to revive ourselves, or what we have done.\n\nWe have blackened the earth and sullied our air,\n\nwe have killed your friends,\n\nfor nothing but the triumph of money\n\nand the triumph of cash, no matter\n\nwho we are deep inside, we’re sorry for this.\n\nDespite the commandments, despite the laws,\n\nwe have done what we wish and transformed\n\nrainforests to deserts and savannahs to dust,\n\nwe have escaped the laws of nature,\n\nthe true laws that keep all animals from destroying the earth.\n\nFrom your unjudging heights\n\nyou look down upon us.\n\nYou see so much that you know the answers,\n\nyou are the messenger of knowledge itself. You are the mighty giraffe.\n\nPublished Nov. 29, 2017: BIODIVERSITY.ORG"
