        "text": "Details\n\n6.5 linear ft (16 boxes)\n\nThe papers are arranged in three series: I. Administrative Files. II. Topical Files. III. Photographs\n\nThe John Arthur Wilkinson Papers document the administrative and institutional history of the Center for Advocacy, Research and Planning (CARP), and offer a detailed view of the workings of a non-profit civil rights legal agency. CARP's work in the New Haven area with dozens of minority economic interests and neighborhood organizations is reflected in extensive correspondence, legal memoranda, proposals, and collected material. Much of the CARP material also addresses the general topic of African-Americans in the professions, particularly in law and business. There is substantive documentation on housing (discrimination, fair housing, neighborhood advocacy) and educational issues (especially concerning community and technical colleges)\n\nJohn Arthur Wilkinson was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on April 30, 1938, and received his B.A., M.A.T., and M.A. degrees from Yale University. From 1961 to 1968, Wilkinson was Assistant Dean of Yale College, and was Associate Dean from 1968 to 1974. He served as headmaster of Hopkins School from 1974 to 1979. Wilkinson returned to Yale in 1979, serving as an Officer for Development until 1981, and was Secretary of the University from 1981 to 1987. During his years as Officer for Development and Secretary, he served on the Board of Directors for the Center for Advocacy, Research and Planning (CARP)\n\nThe Center for Advocacy, Research and Planning (CARP) was founded in December 1973 as the legal arm and research agency of the Greater New Haven Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). CARP focused its activities on civil rights issues and did significant work in matters of affirmative action, fair housing, and community economic development. Separated from the NAACP for tax reasons in 1974, CARP continued to promote the concerns of disadvantaged communities until it was disbanded in 1983\n\nThe collection is open for research\n\nJohn Arthur Wilkinson Papers (MS 1661).
