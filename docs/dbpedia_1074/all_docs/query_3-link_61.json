        "text": "Harwit:\n\nI saw from your vita and also from your biography in The American Men in Science that you were born in Hillsdale, Michigan. Perhaps you can say a few things about early recollections of your family, family life, anything that you remember that interests you.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOkay, well, my family was middle-class. My father and mother both worked, my mother as a school teacher.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat does she teach?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nShe taught junior high school math. My father, who I think never formally graduated from high school, was a projectionist in a movie theater, but was interested in electronics, and probably was the most influential on me early on in choosing a technical career. He was always tinkering around with tubes and electronics, and he was good at fixing things; he was always fixing the car or something like that. Then, of course, my mother was good with numbers. Those were really about the only influences that would have directed me toward a technical field. I grew up in a very industrial-type setting in Michigan. Most of my friends’ fathers worked in factories on production lines.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhere is Hillsdale?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHillsdale is in central southern Michigan, a very small town, primarily a farming community town, and, in fact, most of my family were farmers up until my parents. My grandparents were both from farm families.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat is the closest, bigger town?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThe closest bigger town would be Jackson which is about 35 miles away, and then Detroit to the east, Chicago to the west. Hillsdale is about half-way in between. It’s farther west, even than Ann Arbor, just about in the center of the state. Lansing is straight north.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see. Okay, fine. Now, did you have brothers or sisters?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI had an older brother, four years older, who is now an engineer for TRW.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat sort of an engineer?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAeronautical. He works on Minuteman missiles and things like that — a lot of classified work so I don’t really know what he does. He went as far as a masters in aeronautical engineering and then went right to work for the aerospace industry; moved to Los Angeles.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid your parents from early on want both of you to study?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, there was never any doubt about that. We heard about college from the time we were old enough to understand what it meant — a lot of emphasis, not pressure, but emphasis, encouragement to get good grades in school. We both transferred from the small town school into a larger school system, so we had to ride a bus.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow far away?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt was about 30 miles, so it was a considerable nuisance to have to ride this bus every day to school and back.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhere was the school located?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat was in Jackson, Michigan. I actually during the War moved to Texas, and after the War when we came back, we didn’t go back to Hillsdale at that point. We were living in a little town named Michigan Center; it’s a suburb of Jackson.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat made your family move to Texas?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMy father was in the Navy. He was an instructor, electronics instructor in the Navy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd did he go back to his old job when he came back.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, after the War, they both went back to their old employment.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut they decided that they wanted to move closer to Jackson at that time.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAt that point his job was in Jackson rather than Hillsdale. It was in the same local, the same area, same union but different town.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you and your brother interact much?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot very much. The four years age difference meant that we didn’t do that many things together.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI just thought maybe he would be building interesting things if he was interested in engineering, and that you would look over his shoulders or something like that.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, he was always building model airplanes or...he built an 8-foot model of the Eiffel Tower out of toothpicks once and things like that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nFantastic.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, so I looked up to him as somebody who could build things and figure things out.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhen you were in school, were you also interested in building things?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot so much building things as tearing things apart and understanding how they worked. In that part of the world cars are a big thing, so every kid buys a car, probably even before he can drive it. Tears it apart, fixes the engine, that sort of thing. So I was interested in cars and mechanical things, not so much in electrical things.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you do that with other boys your age or by yourself?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMostly by myself.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you go out and have a job in order to try to buy an old jalopy to fix up?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAt what?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI counted worms into a can — fishing worms. Fishing is big in southern Michigan, lots of lakes, so my job was put a hundred worms in a can, put the lid on. I don’t know, we got a nickel a can or something for doing this.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou sold that to some vendor?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, it was a worm hatchery. It was a guy who actually hatched out and grew earth worms…\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh, I see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\n…and I worked for him. But he needed somebody to package the worms.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo he actually got them to breed?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd then you packaged then.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThen he would take them around and sell then to bait stores, locally.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow long can these things live after they’re packaged?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nQuite a while. You put some wet moss in there and they live for a couple of weeks.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh really, I see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nJust keep them moist.\n\nHarwit:\n\nA hundred per tin, then, or was it a box?\n\nWilkinson:\n\n(laughter) It was like an ice cream container. So that was my first job to make any money. That’s how I bought my first jalopy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAt a nickel…\n\nWilkinson:\n\n…nickel a can.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt must have been a lot of cans.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBut you could buy a jalopy for $50. Yes, a lot of worms.\n\nHarwit:\n\nFive thousand cans. Now when was it that you got interested in science or engineering? In school then?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, really, I guess in high school. The school I went to, rode the bus to get to, was a very good school system. It had excellent math teachers; the physics course was a disaster, chemistry was good.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you realize that at the time?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, it was quite obvious.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow did it feel? Was it that you hated physics?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, not at all. I liked physics, but the teacher used to actually go to sleep in class. He was obviously bored with the whole thing. The course was taught in a very mundane way; it was boring.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhen you say he would sleep, you mean that he actually fell asleep?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe would go to sleep. When we were doing labs, he would often just sit down at his desk and go to sleep.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh, I see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe managed to stay awake during the lectures. (laughter) But it was a very boring, very mundane physics course; I can’t remember much that I learned. But that did get me interested in science.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNot the physics, the chemistry did?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThe chemistry and the math mostly.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDo you remember any teachers’ names?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh yes. Strangely enough, the teacher I really remember was Miss Pitts. She was my English teacher. Miss Pitts had a way of getting you to think more clearly and to write things clearly than any of my other teachers, even my math teachers. She probably was more influential on me in high school than anyone else. She was a remarkable lady. A number of my high school friends whom I’ve met later, when asked that question, even though they’re now engineers and doing technical things, still remember Miss Pitts as a very influential teacher. My math teachers, Mr. Holdeman I had for math and chemistry. He was a remarkable man, and very interested in what he was doing even though at that point; though he must have been at it for 30 years, he was still very excited about it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo his enthusiasm transferred itself to the students.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAnd I had a geometry teacher whose name has slipped me at the moment, who was very good at stimulating us with the following mechanism: He would give a problem, and the first four people up to his desk with the right answer got an A, and the next four got a B and so on. (laughter)\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo speed was essential.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nSpeed was essential — and accuracy. You had to have the right answer.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat happened if you came up early but didn’t have the right answer?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYou had to go back so you’d wasted time.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh, I see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBut he really put sort of a competitive spirit into your work, and I still remember that class because the brightest kids in my grade level were in that class. I guess that probably was the first time I was really able to sort out where I stood in math and technical things.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWere you always the best in your class?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot by a long shot. In that particular class, occasionally I’d be first, but usually I was third or fourth.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat happened to the others who were good?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s a good question. One of them is a dentist in Jackson; the other one is a lawyer in Jackson; and the other one is an engineer in Los Angeles. He was the only one who ended up going into a technical field. The two brightest guys in my high school graduating class in mathematics and technical things ended up going back to the home town to be professional people.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThe dentist and the lawyer?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. They were both from well-to-do families, and numbers three and four, who were from middle-class families, working parents, both went into technical areas. I don’t know what conclusion you’d draw from that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s hard to say.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMaybe they just saw a lifestyle that we didn’t see and thought they preferred that; but they were clearly better than the other two of us in mathematics, but decided very early that they wanted to do medicine and law — dentistry and law.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWere their parents either in the medical field or law?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOne of them did have a...his father was a lawyer. The other one I’m not sure.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas it the lawyer whose father was a lawyer also?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. I’ve often wondered about that. What the influences were there.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDo you go back to Jackson sometimes?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot very much. I still have an aunt living there, and I go to see her occasionally.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo you get a chance…or you have had a chance in past years to see some of these people you went to school with.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, at least the ones that have stayed in the community.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow many from that school went on to college? What fraction?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nFor those days quite a high percentage — I would say over 50 percent, which…\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou started around 1953 or so?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s correct. Graduated in ‘53 from high school. I think in those days 50 percent was rather a high percentage to go to high school, certainly the school I transferred from, perhaps the number was more like 10 percent.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo did some of them go to Michigan?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, quite a few. It was the habit to go to nearby schools from that high school. A few came East or went West, but most people went to Michigan State, The University of Michigan or one of the colleges nearby — Albion — there’re many colleges in that area.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, The University of Michigan was so good and the tuition for in-state people was low, so it must have been very attractive.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt was very attractive. In fact, I didn’t even apply anywhere else.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhen you got to Michigan, what was your first impression when you’d got there as a freshman? You had signed up for engineering, I guess?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s correct. I got my degree in engineering. Well, my brother had gone there so I had had a bit of an introduction to the place. I wasn’t overwhelmed by the size of the place. I guess my main impression was excitement. I was excited about learning, and felt I still had an awful lot to learn. And I worked hard as an undergraduate.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas it very competitive?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nMore so than in a high school?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMore so than in high school, I felt, at least, more stimulated by the competition.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you enjoy it, or did you feel bored?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, not at all. I enjoyed it very much. I loved the hard work and the learning.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow about the social life?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nVery little. I had very little social life. I went out of my way to get out of the dormitory. There was a rule that all freshmen were supposed to be in the dorm. I got a special dispensation to live out of the dorm.\n\nHarwit:\n\nRight as a freshman?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAs a freshman. And that was partly on my brother’s advice who had lived in the dorm for his first year. He also worked hard as an undergraduate — realized that as soon as he moved out of the dorm, that that was more conducive to working.\n\nHarwit:\n\nJust quieter?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo you lived in a room someplace in town in Ann Arbor?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. So not much of a social life, true, but I loved it. Those are very happy years, looking back.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas there time for dating also, or you said you worked pretty hard?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, I tended to go back to Jackson quite often on weekends. It was only 40 miles away or so, and had a lot of good friends there. That really was my escape from the working. I worked hard during the week and then the weekends would relax.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo your friends were mainly back in Jackson not so much in Ann Arbor.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMore back in Jackson, that’s correct.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd over the course of those years you didn’t drift apart because your education was more advanced than the people who had stayed behind, or anything like that.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo we didn’t drift apart, as a matter of fact. My best friend, Fred (now General) Nelson, from those years still, whom I see quite often, didn’t go to a university. He went to the local junior college, but we stayed very close, did a lot of traveling together in the summer times, things like that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat was the engineering physics program like at Michigan?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt was pretty much of a standard engineering program. You went through the same courses for the first two years. Toward the end you were allowed to take upper-class physics courses, rather than concentrating in electrical or mechanical, and so forth, I started out in electrical, but I came up against the steam tables.\n\nHarwit:\n\n(laughter) In electrical engineering?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, there was a required course on steam engines, and the only book for the course was the steam tables, I decided…\n\nHarwit:\n\nKeenan and Keens, or something like that?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nGoodness, I can’t even remember. I didn’t take the course. That’s when I switched into engineering physics.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBut I was very happy I did.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou took math and physics courses mainly, then, the last couple of years?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, the math went all along because I was in engineering anyway.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDo you remember any professors in any of the subjects who influenced you one way or another?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYou’re talking about anywhere in undergraduate years?\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, Dick Crane, no question.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see. Well, you did your Ph.D. with him, didn’t you?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, but he was also my undergraduate E&M teacher, and that’s when I first saw a real physicist.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhom did you have for math courses?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMy freshman math teacher — I wish I could remember his name, because he was outstanding. I don’t think I ever cracked open the calculus book because this guy put such beautiful lectures on the board that I just learned calculus from my notes. I don’t ever remember opening a book. I wish I could remember his name because he...well you can learn calculus anywhere, but he really taught you to think clearly and reason and follow an argument, and he just made the whole thing so clear and understandable and logical.\n\nHarwit:\n\nLet’s see, was that taught in the math department or in the engineering school?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat was in the engineering school. They had their own math faculty.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo all of the math you took was in the engineering school, is that right, even things like differential equations?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that was all in engineering; that’s right. So the math I took was more applied than I would have had if I’d taken a straight physics degree, which I liked. I liked that side of it; I needed to be tied to real problems.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo you didn’t have differential equations with Rainville, for example, who wrote a book and was in the math department at Michigan?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe used Rainville’s book, as a matter of fact, but it was taught by an engineering faculty member. Churchill also was there at the time, I think, and we used his book.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThat was on complex variables, wasn’t it?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, correct, gee, you know these books.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, you had a number of courses with the physics faculty, then, as an undergraduate,…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\n…so you probably had people like Laporte, Uhlenbeck, Dennison, at various times, either as an undergraduate or as a graduate student?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI had all three of them. As an undergraduate — Laporte for math-physics; Dennison for mechanics; Uhlenbeck, for statistical mechanics when I was a graduate student — all very good teachers, outstanding teachers.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhich of these influenced you most, or do you remember anything about them? Laporte was somewhat flamboyant and had mannerisms of all kinds, peculiarities, I guess.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, Laporte was flamboyant. Well, strangely enough Laporte taught us how to keep a notebook. He, again, never used a book, used a text; he put the lectures on the board, and we were required to keep beautiful notes in ink with pictures and jokes. When we would sit and take our hour exams, Laporte would go through our notebooks and grade them. It was an interesting technique because it did force you to write things down with care, and it really taught me the value of a notebook. And I still have that notebook; I still go back and look at it occasionally. That was an undergraduate math physics course. If I were ever to teach such a course, which I wouldn’t pretend to be able to do very well, I would haul out this notebook.\n\nHarwit:\n\nJust very well organized.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt had a lot of stories in it and key ideas.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHe wanted you to record the stories too?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, I would make little notes about the stories. He would often tell stories. I don’t think he ever told us to write those down, but I usually would make a note.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat about Crane as a lecturer? He was much quieter than the other people.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s correct. He certainly did not come in and write beautiful lectures on the board. We needed to read the book, and his style was to embellish what you were already supposed to know when you walked into the room. I found that very good. A lot of students complained because they thought he should be working out problems, deriving Maxwell’s equations, and so forth. Instead, he’s telling us about antennas or polarization properties of waves and trying to stimulate us to think about more applied things that had to do with the material we were learning, and I enjoyed that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas Barker still teaching?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBarker was inactive; he was there, but at this point a very old man.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHe had been chairman not too long before but might have been retired by the time you got there.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe was retired by the time I got there.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDennison was chairman?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nDennison was chairman; that’s right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas Glaser still around?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nGlaser was still there when I was an undergraduate, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnybody else there whom you remember as being influential on you in any way?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh gee, I think probably to some extent everyone in the department. It was an excellent teaching department at that time, and there were young people there who took teaching very seriously — this is while I was an undergraduate and a graduate student. Oh, people like Bob Lewis and Bill Ford, and they just…\n\nHarwit:\n\nThese were younger people?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThese are younger people who clearly spent a lot of their time on their teaching, and were always happy to talk to you, but were very up to date on what was going on. I learned an awful lot.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHazen was also in the department, I think.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, Hazen was there. In fact, I never took a course from him, but he did research on the same floor, and I would often go down and talk to him. He had some cloud chambers at that time.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo, when you decided to go to graduate school, what decided you to stay in Michigan? Was it the fact that Crane had interested you and you wanted to work with him ultimately?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. That really was it. It was partly financial.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut at that point you were able able to get assistantships, so you could have gone elsewhere too, I imagine.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI could have gone elsewhere. I already had a job as an undergraduate with Crane, had been working for him for a couple of years doing various things; had worked a summer with Terwilliger and Jones on an electron accelerator — had enjoyed that. I think Dick Crane had even mentioned the g-2 work to me while I was still a senior, because I think when I walked in as a grad student I started out on the g-2 project from the very beginning. (Here g is the electron gyromagnetic ratio.) Yes, I’m pretty sure I did; I was working on that while I was still doing my coursework.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, Crane always was known to do quite difficult experiments which were very ingenious — seemed to be his style.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, sure was.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIs that what attracted you to him, or was it a matter of temperament more? You know, when one chooses someone to work with?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think a little of each probably. I certainly was very attracted by the physics that he was doing. I always found his g-2 idea very elegant, and a piece of fundamental work that could be done with pretty low-key techniques and without a lot of big machinery and technical support around. And that appealed to me, but Dick, himself, was a very attractive guy to work for. He gave you a lot of independence, but he was always there when you needed some backup. Inevitably, his advice was good and to the point and very helpful. I think I must have learned that as an undergraduate and saw that that was going to be a…\n\nHarwit:\n\nTemperamentally a good match then.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh yes, yes, a very quiet, unassuming man; but just remarkable insight and intuition into complicated physics problems — well not physics problems — just problems you were having in the lab. Something would look hopelessly complicated or involved — lots of different things pointing in different directions. Typically, he’d come up at four o’clock for a cup of coffee. We’d sit down and talk. When I was having troubles, of course I would pour it all out. Dick would just sit there, take in all in, and be very quiet, and sometimes minutes would go by and nothing would be said. But Dick would be thinking about it, and usually he’d have something right away to suggest, but as often as not, he’d come back the next day with some advice.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow many graduate students were in the group that he had?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMe,\n\nHarwit:\n\nJust you.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nJust one.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas it his custom to have just one?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAt that time, yes. He had his own carbon fourteen, C14, work which he ran himself. He had no students on that. At that time the only other research that he had going was this g-2, and through most of it I was his only student. Later on, Art Rich joined us as I was finishing up, and then for a long time Art was the only student.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo that was a contrast to, say, Laporte’s shock-tube troops.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s right, a sharp contrast to that or to the cyclotron operation and so forth. And curiously enough Dick had come from the background of the synchrotron there at Michigan, which was big-time physics. It must have been a conscious decision on his part to go back to precision, smaller-time, almost atomic physics type things.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOne has the impression with Crane that he was a much more complex person than people who perhaps were louder in the department.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, yes, no doubt about it. Dick, very quiet unassuming guy, wasn’t splashy, didn’t teach field theory. I know many of the graduate students certainly didn’t appreciate how deep this guy was, and he made no pretenses about knowing a lot of quantum theory or anything like that. But he had this remarkable intuition.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHe did some beautiful experiments.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh yes, and he could work out things that were theoretical in nature. A good example is the whole idea of how this trap works in the g-2 [experiment]. Dick was getting results and had interpreted the data. He and Schupp did. Art Schupp was my predecessor. He was the grad student just before me, and he did the first trapping experiment to do g-2. All that work was done, interpreted, and published without ever a quantum theory of that trap or even a very good relativistic theory of the trap. That was mostly just conjured up out of classical physics, probably a lot of it from Dick, although I think Bob Pidd probably contributed some to that as well. Only later did Bill Ford come along with a real theory of that trap, a quantum…well, a relativistic, at least, theory of how that trap worked. Ken Case had analyzed the uniform field situation earlier on and showed that the classical models were really right even in a quantum theory. But Dick had intuited all this from the beginning.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas Case at Michigan the whole time you were there, or had he already gone to the Rockefeller University by the time you finished?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBy the time I finished, he had gone. I’m not sure he had terminated his appointment at Michigan at that point. He might have still been on leave and so forth.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat about Luttinger? Had he gone to Columbia already?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. He had already left in the middle of my time there.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, when you worked on this problem for your thesis, you and Crane would talk and then you’d go off and do things on your own. You got through remarkably quickly; you got through in about five years altogether.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nPartly because I started my first year, I really started on my thesis problem when I walked in as a first-year student. We emptied the laboratory, painted it even, and started all over again; so by the time I was a third-year student, when many people were just starting, I was already well along.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo it must have been a big advantage to have joined the group as an undergraduate.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo you worked with Crane over a period of six, seven years.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHe’s long retired by now, isn’t he?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI forgot to ask you, was the bachelor in engineering a five-year program at the time?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, that was a four.\n\nHarwit:\n\nA lot of schools still had five-year programs. I think Cornell only went off it, maybe in the mid-’60s, late ‘60s.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMichigan had a five-year program. You could sort of get a double major in, say, EE and physics, if you wanted to, or in math and EE and things like that. So it was possible to stay for a fifth year. I didn’t see much point since I knew at that point I wanted to do…Well, I didn’t know I wanted to do physics, as a matter of fact, because I got a masters degree in nuclear engineering. I essentially spent a fifth year studying reactor physics, and then decided I didn’t want to do that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo then you came from Michigan straight to Princeton.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. Well, I spent a year as a lecturer at Michigan after I got my degree. Stayed on a year, helped Art Rich get started for the next generation of g-2.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you have much interaction with the molecular people at Michigan?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, unfortunately not. In fact, the molecular program was beginning to gear down at that point. Dennison was chairman, so he didn’t have as much time to be active. There was no molecular spectroscopy going on at the time. Who was it still there doing theory?\n\nHarwit:\n\nTed Hecht?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHecht, yes. He later started doing nuclear physics, but he was there…He was another of the young excellent teachers in that department at the time. His lectures ware just beautiful.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, so, you stayed on then as a postdoc for a year, and what decided you to come to Princeton?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, let’s see how did this go? The g-2 result was a good one for the times. It had surpassed Schupp’s number by, I don’t know, one or two orders of magnitude in accuracy; I can’t remember. But it was the best g-2 number around, and in those days everyone was very interested in testing quantum electrodynamics, so there was a lot of interest in it. Peter Franken was on my committee, and, in fact, I had talked to Peter a lot while I was a grad student there. He was another very influential guy, more on experimental techniques and style, but I admired very much Franken’s originality in the kinds of experiments he did. Peter got on the phone and called up a bunch of people – Dicke…\n\nHarwit:\n\nPeter Franken rather than Dick Crane?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRather than Dick, yes, and that’s characteristic of their style. Peter is more flamboyant and would do that and Dick would sort of sit back and wait for somebody to call him or see somebody at a meeting, whatever. Anyway, all of a sudden these invitations started pouring in to go and talk at various places; so I made several trips to the East Coast. I think Peter called Vernon Hughes at Yale, and he must have called Ed Purcell or Norman Ramsey, probably Ramsey at Harvard.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWould it have been more in the line of Norman Ramsey’s interest?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, I think so.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut Ed Purcell also would have been possible.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nSo I made a couple of Eastern swings, and of course this was great, very exciting for me, mid-Western kid finally coming to the great Ivy League schools and giving talks.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou had never been on the East Coast before that?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, I hadn’t. No, in fact, my first trip was to Columbia, so Peter must have called I. I. Rabi, I suppose. Anyway, these letters started appearing or the phone started ringing, and that was pretty gratifying to get a phone call from people I had read about all these years and never seen. As a grad student I didn’t go to any conferences.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThere wasn’t that much money in those days, I guess.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThere wasn’t that much money to travel around, and it was Dick’s style. He did not go to a lot of meetings himself, and I pretty much followed his example. So I looked at various places and decided that I wanted to come to Princeton and work with Dicke on gravitation. I had decided I wanted to change fields. The g-2 is a kind of peculiar experiment; it wasn’t really in a field; it wasn’t a particle experiment; it wasn’t atomic physics. It was off by itself, but I liked Dicke’s style. He was doing the Eotvos experiment at that point.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, he also was doing interesting experiments, also sort of a one-man group, a few people, and also quiet but incisive?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. I suppose that style was familiar and attractive too. Tom Carver had a good deal to do with getting me to come here. He was doing atomic physics, resonance, here. He, I suppose, originally came to work with or near Bob Dicke, because Dicke had some ideas about optical pumping and resonance experiments. In fact, Bob had had some fundamental ideas on how one might measure g-2 with great precision. So Tom was here doing optical pumping resonance, atomic-physics-type work, and he was quite interested in trying to get me to come to Princeton, I suppose thinking that I might work in his area as well. As it turned out, I never did.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou started out on lunar ranging. Is that right?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s right. That’s really the first thing I did here, at Bob’s urging, and because of the times. It was pretty clearly a good idea. It wasn’t original by any means, Bob and some of his students — I think they were all students, maybe not — had written a paper about the possibility of ranging to a reflecting satellite in orbit, and doing gravitation in this way. Then a paper came out with the idea of doing radio ranging by having a transponder on the moon. This would land a little transmitter-receiver, which would receive a pulse from the Earth, amplify it and send it back. Somehow we got a hold of that paper. I don’t know whether Bob saw it or…As a matter of fact, I think Peter Franken saw it, and wrote to Bob or me and said, “This doesn’t make much sense; you could do much better with a laser.” Franken at that time was bouncing laser beams off the surface of the moon, and knew about Dicke’s earlier paper about satellites. I think maybe it was Peter who put this together and got that whole collaboration started. So I sat down and wrote a draft of the paper, and…\n\nHarwit:\n\nOf the proposal for such a thing?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, it was a peculiar strategy. What we decided to do was first write this short letter, hoping that NASA wouldn’t go off on this lunar transponder thing but would rather think about putting up corner reflectors. We wanted to get something in the literature rather quickly and assembled this team of people who were interested in the project. I wrote a quick draft; we circulated it around. In fact, I’m not even sure if Franken ends up on the author list.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, he’s on it. I guess the authors are Alley, Bender, Dicke, Faller, Franken, Plotkin and you.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRight, okay. Mostly ex-associates of Bob Dicke’s except for Plotkin, who was in NASA, and was interested in lunar ranging, and Peter Franken was also interested in lunar ranging.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd I guess you published that in the Journal of Geophysical Research, Vol. 70, page 2267, 1965.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRight. That was a project that I could work on, on the side without buying a lot of equipment, while I was trying to decide what I wanted to do.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, in any case, JGR, Journal of Geophysical Research, was the place where one would want to published something like that in those days.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s correct. Also this paper about the transponder had been in there, so our interest really was to head off that idea if we could because a passive reflector just seemed like so much better an idea.\n\nHarwit:\n\nA lot of the early space literature, that is early in the NASA era, seems to have been published there, and I think that’s cooled down, it’s become much more a journal for just what it says it is, rather than [space work of all kinds].\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, I think that’s right. Well, a lot of the early NASA science, of course, was the study of the Earth and the Moon and their interaction. Most of the conferences I went to in those early years, in fact, had to do with the Moon and the Earth and modes and tides, and all that sort of thing.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut it did attract people from a wide variety of different areas who perhaps had been drawn in by the fact that there was money available for research through NASA, that would support both that work and, maybe other things. I’m not quite sure.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAlso it was pretty clear that a lot of the techniques that were going to become available were going to revolutionize measurements — getting satellites up there had a lot of advantages. Gravity, in particular; it looked like a great thing for gravity to get satellites in orbit.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, you started teaching right away when you came as an instructor?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI guess you had an umbrella grant here through Dicke, or did you have to fund your own research with grants?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, that was done with an umbrella grant that Bob Dicke had, and at that time there were several grants. He had some NSF money; he had some Naval Research money. Perhaps that’s all at that time. I think half of my academic-year salary and all of my summertime salary was paid by Bob’s NSF grant, which he had, to do gravitational research.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo the university doesn’t cover all of your academic-year salary here?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot as a junior faculty member, and that’s still true. Senior faculty, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat do you mean by junior in that case?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNon-tenured.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see. So assistant professors are paid out of grants?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHalf of their academic-year salary, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBy whom? Their own grants?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, other peoples’ grants. The system is still very much the same: There is an umbrella grant in a certain area, say nuclear physics, and all of the young assistant professors and instructors in that group receive half of their academic-year salary from the grant.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut doesn’t that make the assistant professors beholden to the people who pay them, and perhaps less adventurous than they might or should be at that age? I’m just asking. We don’t have that system at Cornell.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think that would depend very much on the head of the group. Whether or not when the new young person walks through the door he or she is told that you’re going to work on this project and do this. Perhaps that happens sometimes; I don’t know. It doesn’t happen in our group currently, and people are given a lot of freedom within the purview of the grant. If somebody in our group started doing nuclear physics, I think in a year or so we would have to make some adjustment, just because we wouldn’t be able…\n\nHarwit:\n\nThat’s what I was wondering really; the grants do require you to be true to the purposes that you stated within bounds, but nevertheless,\n\nWilkinson:\n\nFortunately, there still are some rather flexible umbrella grants around, and we feel very lucky, in fact, at still having one of these for our work here.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s not very often that you get something which is not quite specifically directed.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s right, that’s right. It’s not very often, and we’re fortunate to have that. We’ve certainly taken advantage of it over the years. There are a number of things that would not have happened if we’d had to have written a proposal in advance saying exactly what we were going to do for the next three years.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThat’s right because it would have been turned down, I imagine.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt probably would have been turned down, and if when a new idea came along, we wouldn’t have been able to work on it because we were going to have to write a report and justify our funding. That’s an unfortunate trend, I think, in funding; people aren’t given enough flexibility. I can see the things that drive the agencies to do that, but fortunately we still have an umbrella grant here whose title is “Gravitation, Relativity and Cosmology.” And that’s about as specific as the proposal gets.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd that’s a NSF grant?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s a NSF grant. That’s correct. Supports several senior faculty people here in research and half a dozen or so junior faculty.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd how specific do they expect you to be when you ask for renewals?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot very specific at all. We say what we’re working on. First of all we say what we’ve done. That’s really the basis for the renewal in our view. Is our work up to par? Do we deserve to get some more money? Then what we’re working on currently and the directions we see our research going. I think ideally that’s the way science should be funded.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, it’s unfortunate that it’s not always that what you have done [that counts]…I mean, when a group has been in existence for 20 years like yours has here, or more even, what the group has achieved, particularly in the most recent five years or so, seems probably the best indicator of what it’s going to be able to achieve over the next five years.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut I think it does take a fairly broad-minded contract officer to appreciate that and not, under proposal pressure, to worry about the topic of the promises.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, it’s not just the officer, too, it’s also your peers and referees, because if he gets negative referee reports, there’s no way he can end up funding you. So the referees have to understand that too. It does not make it easy to write a proposal, because these days most of us expect a proposal to be very specific and outline a task, almost, and a set of goals, specific goals, and so forth. Our proposals don’t do that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo how do you handle that when you write your proposals?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe say really what I said: We tell what directions we’re going in; what we think we’re going to do for the next year, which can be quite specific; say what is going to happen to that piece of apparatus that’s two-thirds built; and when we intend to fly it and the results we think we’re going to get with it. Beyond that, you can only say, “I’m still interested in isotropy. I see the next generation of detectors being such and such; we’re working on that, and this is our idea for how to improve those experiments.” And that’s about it, and sometimes those ideas are not very specific, simply because you haven’t yet worked out all of the engineering details.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, what’s the reception that you get from the referees for this kind of thing?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nVery mixed, very mixed. Another problem is that because our work in our group is diverse, our referees are diverse. A fair amount of work we do is in optical work, so some optical astronomers certainly review the work. Peebles does his work in theory and model fittings, so clearly some mathematical people are going to get involved. Astronomers that are interested in cosmology, astronomers that are interested in the infrared…\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow many people are involved in this grant? Who are the figures in that?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOkay. Dicke, Peebles, Wilkinson (I’m sort of going in historical order), Groth, Loh, Boughn, and Kuhn.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBoughn is a faculty member now?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. Has been for six years. Steve Boughn came here from Stanford. Did gravity wave work before.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut he started out as a postdoc with you?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nActually started as an instructor.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd he’s tenured now?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo. In fact, I think this is his year of decision. Ed Loh has been working in optical things with CCDs.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou did a paper together, I guess.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s correct. Jeff Kuhn who’s working with Bob Dicke on the Sun. Juan Uson who’s here working with Jim and me and everybody — very flexible guy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd he’s also on the faculty?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, in fact, he’s leaving. He’s currently, I guess, in a research position, but he’s been teaching on and off.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhere is he going?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe’s going to NRAO. I think that’s the list of the junior faculty, and then there’re a half dozen graduate students. Joe Taylor has his own funding, although he certainly is intellectually a member of our group.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo, you’re talking about a grant, then, which is something like a couple of hundred thousand dollars or so?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, up to about five hundred thousand dollars a year. This is supporting work on the blackbody radiation which I am doing; Jim’s work on large-scale structure of matter in the Universe; Bob Dicke’s work on the Sun, Ed Loh’s work on using the CCDs to look at very deep galaxies and trying to do cosmology with redshifts of galaxies; gravitational wave work that is going on with Boughn and Kuhn, calculating how gravitational waves might make the Sun ring and could you detect those modes and so forth — a wide variety of things. You can imagine the problem in writing and refereeing this proposal.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow often do you have to renew it?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat varies. At first it was every year, then we went to a five-year cycle.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh, that’s nice.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, it was nice, except that it was very hard to write a proposal for five years, and I, in fact, requested a three-year period which we worked on for quite a while. We currently have a five-year proposal in again at the urging of the NSF. They thought they would rather be back on a five-year cycle. I thought the three-year was better in terms of being able to write a harder proposal. It’s just very hard to anticipate five years ahead.\n\nHarwit:\n\nFive years is very difficult.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt’s a long time, in particularly if you’re doing the kinds of things we’re doing, where at any point in a year you might just go off in some other direction.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou have a group of imaginative people.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, hopefully. If you look at history, in fact, we don’t go off every three years in another direction, but we like to think we’re ready to do that if an important problem comes along. And this kind of long-term funding is very beneficial in that respect. Another reason we at one point requested a three-year funding cycle was that some of us felt we were getting a little too complacent and we weren’t being chided enough by negative referee comments. In five years you can get awfully comfortable, and that had happened for a period of time, I think a three-year cycle is more healthy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhen you did the five-year cycles, you just had to write a progress report each year, then, and maybe negotiate the funding?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, but only then with our contract officer at the NSF. Those were not reviewed, so we were not being subject to criticism.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThe funding was just determined essentially on a straight level, except that the NSF’s fortunes were going up and down somewhat, maybe.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. And that was another reason for not staying with five-year funding: If we saw an opportunity, but that was going to require another person, then within that five-year constraint, we couldn’t expect to get that kind of increment. So we in some sense lost some flexibility to open up new areas or add another excellent person to the group.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, you also have some support through the cosmic background explorer experiment, where you are on the team?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s correct. In fact, now there altogether are three NASA contracts that are more or less related to the COBE.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDo they support your ballooning too?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, and the justification is that — and I think it is a good one — the instruments that are flying on COBE, in fact, have all been developed first as balloon instruments by various groups; and it just makes a lot of sense to keep pushing the instrumentation as long as you can. And the data from balloons also help the mission. COBE will do better, but whatever we know at the time COBE flies will help us do a better job on COBE. There are reasons for keeping working on this; and various groups in the COBE team are still doing ground-based work.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou sound defensive about it. To me, it just sounds very natural that you should be doing these things to make sure that you have the best instrumentation at the time COBE flies.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI guess I’m sounding defensive because we always have to defend this to NASA. For example, NASA has a hard and fast rule against supporting any ground-based astronomy. Well, that rule has, in fact, been interpreted that you shouldn’t even be doing balloon or aircraft work on NASA funds. Well, clearly that’s ridiculous. How are you ever going to develop were flown by us — you and everybody else — years ago. And it seems obvious to us, but it does not to NASA people.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, I know, which is strange, after 25 years, or a little longer, of NASA existence. It doesn’t seem to have changed their style of working all that much.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIf anything, in that respect, flexibility of instrumentation being able to put the latest thing up, they’ve gotten worse.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nCOBE…We tried a few years ago — just a couple of years ago — to change the design for the COBE radiometers, and it was like pulling teeth. We had to sacrifice an instrument in order to get the other three upgraded to even half way to where they should be.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhich one did you sacrifice?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe had four radiometers at one point. For the isotropy we sacrificed the lowest frequency one, in order to get the other three cooled to improve their performance.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see. Now, to get back to the lunar reflector experiment, you built most of that up here, yourself, at Princeton? Or what was the nature of the collaboration?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, in fact, we did very little here at Princeton. The collaboration was very much a team, a science team, which got together and set direction, policy and strategy. Then various members of the team did the work, and, in fact, the Princeton members did very little of the real work. Carroll Alley was the group leader; took most of the initiative. He took the initiative in getting NASA to let contracts to industry to build the reflectors, to put together ground stations to observe this thing, to get things organized so that the packages got built and on to the systems. So Carroll really deserves a lot of the credit for making the thing work. Peter Bender did a lot of the initial calculations to determine whether or not the accuracy was going to be good enough and what kinds of things we were going to be able to do. Jim Faller worried a lot about ground station configurations, and, in fact, invented and built one himself at Wesleyan at that time. Henry Plotkin was very actively working at Goddard with telescopes and lasers, ranging to satellites, so his experience was really valuable in that project. Later on, some people, Derral Mulholland from JPL joined the team. He was very instrumental in getting together an ephemeris and programs to analyze the data. Those are the principal people who worked. Bob Dicke and I supplied a few ideas, I suppose, and kibitzed; but we didn’t actually do any building.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhere was the actual construction done then?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThe corner reflector itself was built by Bendix under NASA contract. That had to be done very quickly because that opportunity arose only because the ALSAP package did not get ready for the initial Apollo flight. That was a general-purpose instrument.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat would it have included?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, it the gravimeter; some kind of soil sampler; cosmic-ray detectors, I think. It was an array of several instruments that ware in a package, and it became obvious around October, before the following Apollo launch which was to happen in June, that that package was not going to make the flight. At that point NASA designed a lead weight to take its place, and through no small effort on Carroll’s part, they became aware that they might be able put the corner reflector box in there instead. Several people on the team dropped everything for a period of a few weeks. We cornered the world’s market in quartz and all of the skilled people around the world who could polish corner cubes, and managed to get the package together. Bendix worked hard to get this package designed, doing an actual engineering design. There ware a lot of worries. There was a lot of hard designing that still had to be done, only nine months before launch.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow big was this cube then?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh gee, it was an array of cubes. Each cube was about two inches in diameter, and there ware a lot of these things. That first array must have been two feet square, and it was a fairly close-packed, rectangular matrix of these cubes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas the quartz really that scarce?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, it was not easy to get. We were surprised. Well, we had to get some that was already sitting on a shelf, and it turned out that some company in Germany had it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThis is fused quartz?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt was fused quartz. One would have thought there would be plenty of quartz around. It had to be good quality because one doesn’t want to degrade the light inside the cube corner. We needed a good thermal design, and not much was known about the lunar surface. There ware worries about dust. Did you put a dust cover on? There ware a lot of these kinds of decisions that now NASA makes years ahead of time, that had to be made in literally a few days, and get this thing built and delivered to the Cape in April.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThis was April of which year?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh my gosh, when did the first Apollo flight happen?\n\nHarwit:\n\nThe first one that landed was summer of ‘69.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s about right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd it was on the first one that landed?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, the team had gone along for some years at a low visibility. NASA didn’t see this project as getting on to Apollo until later on. In fact, I’m not sure we were even assigned a flight at that point, but when they suddenly started looking around for something more useful than lead to put on the first lander, Carroll Alley was in there politicking and telling people that they should put this on.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRemarkably, NASA went for it and the thing got built.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThey were more adventurous then than now.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, much more, much more flexible.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI think it’s the sane people who are in there, and they’ve just been bitten a few times and become too cautious. Is that possible?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI don’t think so. I think it’s a different generation, a different breed.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut it’s still the sane faces.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, I don’t think so, at least not the people I deal with.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThey’re really quite different. Certainly more cautious. There’s no doubt about that, and rightly so. You can understand why they’re more cautious, but in those days there certainly was a lot more flexibility.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhy do you say it’s rightly so, while at the same time you’re regretting it?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI can understand the bind they’re in. They can’t have that many failures. Congress will just cut their funding.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut they didn’t have all that many failures then, right?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s right. There weren’t that many failures. I’m still amazed that Apollo went as well as it did.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, a lot of things are way overdesigned. You remember the Pioneers we designed, I think, for a one-year lifetime or something like that. Some of them were around and working ten and eleven years later and still may be, if one doesn’t turn then off.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s right. Things are overdesigned, by the standards you and I have for something we would be willing to call an instrument.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, this clearly was an experiment which, because it didn’t involve your personal construction and also because it was a long-term project and because it had to be built by Bendix, wasn’t the a sort of thing your were going to continue doing here without also doing something else, I imagine, in order to get tenure, if nothing else?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh no, this clearly was a very low-profile project here. We did not spend a lot of time on this.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo, at that point somewhere along the line you got involved with the blackbody radiation as your major interest, is that right?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo the historical sequence was that you started in on the corner cube; got that rolling and then shopped around.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s right. In fact, I was shopping around all the time this corner cube thing was going on. It was clear to me that that was not a style I was interested in. I did not want to get involved with a large project with a lot of people like that. It would have been very easy; there were a lot of interesting problems that you could work on, but that wasn’t what I wanted.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo, how did you get involved in the blackbody background? I read what you had written up for the Jansky lectures, but it didn’t tell much about the internal goings on here at Princeton.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI can remember the day and the minute that I got involved in blackbody radiation.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat was that?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe had a great institution in those days up in Palmer. It was room 122. This was a room in the basement in which in one part of it Allan Shenstone did spectroscopy of triply ionized nickel. He was chairman here for some time — a grand man, who literally worked until the day he died, analyzing his spectra. Also, in this room I had a desk, and Jim Peebles had a desk. Bruce Partridge had a desk; Mark Goldenberg had a desk. Several graduate students did their research, and there were benches along the walls. There was a blackboard on one of the center posts which was about four feet by three feet square. Bob Dicke walked in one day, and we just started chatting. Someone else was there at the time, and I can’t remember who it was. It could have been Bruce; it could have been Mark Goldenberg. Bob said, “Well, you know, I’ve been thinking about oscillating universes, and it must be that the Universe really got hot when in bounced.” He really liked bouncing universes. That’s what he talked about most at that time. “In order to get rid of these heavy elements and give us nice, pure hydrogen, the temperature must have gotten up to around 10 degrees back in the big bang, and it seems to me that there ought to be some radiation around. Given all the expansion that’s gone on since then, this is probably in the microwave band.” He drew a curve on the board, and talked a little bit more about what might have gone on.\n\nHarwit:\n\nCurve of what against what?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nA blackbody curve, intensity against wavelength and said this probably is microwaves. The whole thing was pretty casual, and Bob often had ideas. He would tell us about them, and we would think about it. Later on they would go away. So at that point nobody, I think, including Bob took it very seriously, but he, I remember, he pointed out that his Dicke radiometer would be a nice thing to do this, but there’d be these problems because the radiation was isotropic. You’d have to get yourself a good absolute load and measure the total flux, and that wasn’t easy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, Dave, you were just talking about the first suggestion of the background radiation.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, right, and Bob, in that first little conversation, pointed out what the phenomenon would be like and mentioned that it could be measured, but that wouldn’t be easy because of this absolute flux character. There was plenty of sensitivity, no problem there. Of course, he knew about the radiometer and its capabilities. Well, I’d never done any microwave work, so the instrumental challenge didn’t attract me. I was pretty skeptical of the whole thing; it seemed based first of all an oscillating universe, a bouncing universe, which was pretty speculative. I didn’t get very excited about it, but I do remember it very clearly and what he said, and this probably went on only for 20 minutes, and then we went on to a meeting or something.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDo you remember which year it was and which time of year?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat happened only a few weeks before I finally made a commitment to work on the project. It was only a matter of a few weeks. The other person may have been Peter Roll, because Roll also hung around in that room. I’m a little sketchy…oh, you asked about the time. I would have to go look at a notebook to see what the date was, I guess, but it would have been the order of a few weeks to a couple of months before I actually started working on this.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd when did you start working, or you don’t…?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI don’t remember now; I’d have to go look at a book to get a date.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt would be nice to know it, possibly, there are a number of things that we could talk about tomorrow for a few minutes…I mean, it would be good to know did it take you months, or weeks, or years to prepare for this? [1]\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI could go back and look at notebooks and try to figure that out. I know at the time he mentioned this, I was still working on a manuscript for a book on electrons. In fact, it’s a chapter in a book that came out in a series, so I could in fact look and see when that article finally got published.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou don’t have that on your list here, though, I think.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, isn’t that in there? That’s strange. I spent quite a lot of time when I first got here working on this thing — Properties of the Free Electron was the name of the chapter. That’s strange; it’s not in my publication list. I spent a hell of a lot of time on this. It’s not in there. Strange, I’ve never noticed that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat was it called?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThe chapter was called, “Properties of the Free Electron,” and I went into all of the techniques for measuring charge, mass, g-2 of the free electron.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhere was that published?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt was published in the series on “Experimental Physics” that’s put out by Academic Press, I think it is — many volumes of this thing. It’s edited by Marton, as I recall. This was in a volume on, I think, atomic physics, and I believe Vernon Hughes had something to do with that volume. He may have been a co-editor. Anyway, I spent quite a lot of time when I first got here working on that manuscript part time, and I think I was still working on it when Bob mentioned this idea so that may be a clue. Anyway, the sequence of events after that is a little vague, but I know it was a period of time before I agreed to work on this experiment.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat went through your mind as you decided, or was Dicke bringing it up over and over again?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNot very many times. He saw early on that this thing should be done, or he decided early on. He got Peter Roll to commit himself to it, because Roll at that point was finished with the Eotvos experiment and was not a participant in the solar experiment which Dicke and Goldenberg had just gotten going — and Hill. So Roll and I were kind of looking around or thinking about things. I think I was looking for something a little more classical and something to do in the lab. I was interested in astronomy, but had no background, and certainly didn’t know anything about microwaves. I was thinking of hanging weights on strings yet, and still grappling with…\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat is this an illusion to, that weights on strings?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nEotvos experiment.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, fine.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think, in fact, I was thinking about an active/passive gravitational mass experiment at the time, thinking about how to do that. Anyway, I was much more oriented toward the lab, and I suppose wanting to draw on experience more than I could in this microwave experiment. But I obviously didn’t go search the literature to see what was going on. Roll and Peebles and probably Bob Dicke were in fact reading the Bell Labs literature on their radiometer experiments, looking at atmospheric radiation and so forth, so I probably was helping a little with that.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOhm’s things and Jakes’s…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHogg’s, Jakes’s, yes, all of those people. We were reading that literature, everything we could find. In fact, I’ve decided we did not see the Jakes article. It was only recently pointed out to me by Dave Hogg.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s never cited.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAnd when I went back and looked at that article, I don’t believe we had seen it, because he mentions 2 degrees in there…\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\n…and it’s really quite specific. We certainly did not see it before…\n\nHarwit:\n\nOhm’s is also fairly specific.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAnd Ohm’s also, that’s right. We were at that point much more interested in the atmosphere and what kind of problems we were going to run into in the atmosphere. Anyway, at some point along the line, I suppose I ran out of ideas or hopes of doing one of these lab experiments, and capitulated and told Bob in the hall of Palmer that I would work on this with Roll. I think maybe he had been bugging me a little bit. So then Roll and I started building this microwave apparatus, and we had periodic, I think once a week, brown bag lunches in Bob’s office. There were a number of people in the group involved in those lunches, but they were all geared toward this background radiation problem. Jim would talk about calculations and Peter and I would talk about the apparatus. I can remember some very specific detailed instrumentation discussions before we ever had a piece of wave guide in the lab. We had no equipment. Bob had some old stuff lying around from the Second World War, but it was either the wrong band or so ancient that we couldn’t use it. Tom Carver had a little bit of X-band stuff around, but it was in use; we could only go look at it. So we weren’t able to borrow anything; we had to go buy everything, and that took a long time, just to get stuff in.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd you had the money for it?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe had the money for it. It must have come from these umbrella grants that Bob had.\n\nHarwit:\n\nMoney was easier in those days anyway, I suppose.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBut I do remember Bob, very pointedly, saying we had to work at X-band, because that’s where the cheap equipment was available. There was no way we could work in K-band. We were to use Second World War surplus stuff where we could, and we went to Philadelphia and raided Arch Street in order to get pieces of wave guide.\n\nHarwit:\n\nArch Street?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nArch Street is the war surplus electronics street in Philadelphia. But we did finally talk Bob into buying a few good things. We managed to get a calibrated attenuator — brand new — from Hewlett Packard and I think a klystron plus power supply for our local oscillator. Of course, we had to buy mixers and IF amplifiers. Those really had to be bought new. Most of the rest of the stuff we built. We built a precision attenuator, which in the end we never used, but we spent a lot of time on that thing. We built the horn. We built the cold load. We built the horn by Bob’s specs. In fact, that was my first job was to build the horn antenna, and get out and measure it to make sure it had low side load response. Peter concentrated on the helium load, and we worked pretty independently on those two projects, realizing those were the key points. We needed good isolation. We needed to be able to tip the thing to take out the atmosphere. We needed good isolation from the ground, and we needed low reflection off both of these devices.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBy isolation, you mean the back lobe had to be reduced.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes. There’s this 300-degree ground.\n\nHarwit:\n\nLet me ask you. There are two conflicting things, or at least in my view they seem conflicting. One is a thing you once told me and another is one you wrote. I once asked you whether you thought one could have measured the microwave background radiation with Bob Dicke’s wartime equipment, and you said absolutely no, you needed helium cooling. But in the article you and Jim Peebles wrote for the Jansky Memorial Symposium, you wrote that you thought one could have taken the instrument to a mountaintop and detected the radiation. Now, is there a conflict?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, if I said that in that Jansky lecture, then I misled you, because you really needed that helium load.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, yes, maybe I can point that out just since we’re here. Maybe I misread it; I was just looking at that again.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThe only point of the mountaintop would have been to escape the water vapor radiation because that instrument was right on the waterline, but I can’t imagine how you would get your absolute calibration — get your zero-point — without that load. You could do it the way…\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, I didn’t see it either; that’s why I was a little surprised, but I may have just misread. Okay, I think I’ve got it coming up here.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI’m thinking about how Jakes did it. Did Jakes have a helium load, or did he just add up every little piece?\n\nHarwit:\n\nI really don’t recall at this moment.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe had a low-temperature receiver which helps a lot. Bob didn’t; his receiver noise was horrendous.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI was guided towards that by John Pierce who had at one time been Director of Research at Bell later was at Caltech. He knew of my interest in tracing down the history of the discovery at one point, and so he forwarded a letter, or a copy of a letter, that, I think, Hogg had sent him, calling his attention to the Jakes thing, which I appreciated. I then went to the library, looked it up, and I have that reference in the Cosmic Discovery book then, because it struck me as interesting that the Penzias-Wilson observation was really the third one.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI guess that’s right. (laughter)\n\nHarwit:\n\nFor some reason or another I don’t seem to have the…I just looked at it last night in fact. But anyway…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIf I implied that in that Jansky thing, or said that, I think it’s wrong; I’ll retract that, because even from a mountaintop, you still would not have a way of taking out things like the losses in the horn. You really need to either calculate very carefully, or have this absolute reference.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, I’ve found it now. Now, actually you said that Bob had forgotten all about the measurement that he had done himself.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWho pointed that out to him?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nJim Peebles. In going through the literature about the atmosphere, Jim found a reference back to Bob’s paper, went and read it, and this statement about the sky temperature can’t be more than 20 degrees or something like that. Jim was the one who found it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI remember we had quite a laugh about that. Jim pointed it out to him at one of these brown bag lunches. Bob was quite chagrined.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI thought that Jim was mainly doing the theoretical fireball calculations. He was also doing calculations on the other things — the atmospheric [factors], and so on?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think he was also interested in the atmospheric problem, as I recall. He was reading the Bell Labs literature, along with Roll and me.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI’ll look this up afterwards, but at least I have the manuscript here.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWe can talk about it tomorrow.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, you started building this then.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAs soon as we could get the stuff.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd at what point did you then hear about the Bell Labs effort.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAt what stage? We certainly weren’t observing, and I think, in fact, I was still mapping the horn which took me a long time, to work out a technique to get down to the sensitivity I needed in the side lobes. First of all we had to build that horn, and Bob had some good ideas about how to do that. Then we had to set up and map it. Peter had this hard problem of building a reference source whose absolute temperature we were going to know. It was obvious the thing wanted to be down in helium which meant stainless steel wave guide, that was not easy to get a hold of in those days. It had to be plated; those things take time. It had to be measured. We had to know its insertion loss to get the radiation from the warm parts of that thing.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s what loss?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nInsertion loss.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhat is insertion loss?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, you take a piece wave guide and put a watt in one end and you measure what comes out the other end; the insertion loss is what is absorbed. That’s technical jargon.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh, I see, the matching, yes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIn fact, that points out one of the problems we had is that Peter and I knew nothing about any of this terminology. We couldn’t have known a db from…And it took an enormous amount of time just to learn how to read the literature and talk to the manufacturers and specify the things we needed. I’m sure it took me an afternoon to figure out what a noise figure was in dbs, and we had to know that to even design the…let alone specify the…instrument.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s quite a different terminology from the optical one, even though one is talking about the same things.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt is, yes. That’s right. So these two things — the horn and the cold load — needed a lot of very special measurement. We had to do things that were not even common in the microwave literature. You can there find out how to measure the loss in a piece of wave guide to 10%, which is usually good enough. We wanted to do that to a percent. Furthermore, we wanted to be able to do that over a whole range of temperature. That problem was not solved in the literature. Peter had to do that, figure out a way to do that, and do it from scratch. Of course, we had Bob Dicke to talk to; that was a great help. The temperature one was interesting. We needed to know the loss on the wall of that wave guide which had a bizarre surface, because first of all it was stainless, and then it had silver and then it had a gold flash; and you simply can’t sit down and calculate because it depends on the surface texture and so forth, how well a plater did. Bob suggested making a cavity out of the thing and using the width of the absorption measure the Q. Most of that Q is due to the wall losses, and you use that. Then you can simply dunk this thing in liquid nitrogen and liquid helium, and you get the loss as a function of temperature that worked beautifully. In fact, I still get calls from people, occasionally, who read that long paper that Roll and I wrote about this experiment, asking about techniques that we talked about is one of them — this business of measuring wall losses as a function of temperature.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThat’s pretty fundamental.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, I’m sure Bob Dicke had most of these ideas, but Roll and I, then, had to do it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow did you and Roll divide up the work between yourselves?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, pretty much by parts. We decided which parts were going to be the hardest, and he took the cold load and I took the horn. Then we jointly worried about the specifications for the receiver and put the receiver together. Another tricky part was the Dicke switch, which Bob insisted be made symmetric — the one that was bought from the manufacturer — didn’t have a plane of symmetry. Bob considered this a disaster, so we took it apart and put it back together with some extra wave guide around it and made it a symmetric switch. It was a very ingenuous idea and it worked.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI’m sorry, which of the papers with Roll did you mean, the one in Annals of Physics?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, the thing in Annals of Physics which is a real tome. Its got all the experimental details in it. Apparently, people do read that thing; occasionally I get a phone call.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, it’s useful to know things when they’re done properly.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThere were an awful lot of things that had to be measured with care, that just hadn’t been done with that kind of care, except at Bell Labs. We read their papers with a great deal of interest because they had these cryogenic receivers, and so forth.\n\nHarwit:\n\nDid you go and talk with them also?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, I don’t believe so.\n\nHarwit:\n\n…it’s so close.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI don’t believe we ever actually had a conversation.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThis was the line that I was talking to you about, about the mountaintop. (Serendipitous Discoveries in Radio Astronomy, Ed. by K. Kellermann and B. Shetts, Natl. Radio Astronomy Observatory, Green Bank, 1984, page 176.)\n\nWilkinson:\n\nLet’s see what the context is here — Dicke radiometer invented by Dicke, used to measure the intensity; “Fig. 1 shows Dicke and his colleagues. This instrument on a mountaintop (to get above water vapor) could have detected the Fireball radiation, and, in fact, was used”…okay. Alright, well, I could quibble, but you’re right, that’s very misleading — detecting it and measuring it, of course, are two different things. In fact, I think what led me to make this statement was that even in Florida, Bob was able to say that it wasn’t bigger than 20 degrees by simply putting in all of the losses and things that he knew about without that cold load. Now the question is, suppose he had taken that to a mountaintop, which is what I was thinking about when I wrote that statement, to get rid of the atmospheric radiation. Could he have done it then? That’s a question of how well he understood the loss in that horn, and all the losses down to the Dicke switch. If you can compute all of the losses on both arms of the Dicke switch with enough precision, then you can dispense with the cold load. It would have been hard.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, I just wanted to know.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt’s a good point.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s been interesting. I talked to Dicke about that once. He thought he could do it.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe thought he could do it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nEd Purcell thought he absolutely could not. (laughter)\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI see, and I’ve told you both. Well, I must say, I’ve often thought of setting up an undergraduate lab experiment here to do it; and the thing that has always held me back, I couldn’t figure out a way to do it easily without a helium load, and that’s more trouble than we like to put our undergraduates to. Maybe that puts, me back on the side of saying you really need that cold load.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, it’s sort of interesting because people have speculated. You see that in Weinberg’s book, The First Three Minutes. He brings up the question of whether or not one could have done it with Dicke’s equipment, and I think, if I remember correctly, he comes out on the side that, yes, people had told him one could have, and so…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMy guess is, though, that you would end up in the same situation that Ohm, and Hogg, and Jakes ended up in. It would be so marginal, whether or not you could calculate and believe those insertion losses that you probably would write it off…\n\nHarwit:\n\nAs they did.\n\nWilkinson:\n\n…as they did. If I were to retract, I would retract the statement in the Jansky lectures.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, you know, I wasn’t trying to put you on the spot; I was just trying to understand what the situation was.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s the situation. Those insertion losses, in getting from a horn down to a switch, minimum, are a few Kelvin, and that means that you’ve got to do a 25%, maybe, calculation that you really believe, in order to get the uncertainty in those insertion losses below a degree. And there you are, 25% is tough because you don’t even know the conductivity of the metal to a factor of 2.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay. Now, here you and Peter Roll were working on this, and at some point, I guess, you got a call from Penzias, was it, or from…?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think it was Arno Penzias, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI know that Arno had been talking with Bernie Burke, and that Bernie had suggested that what you people were proposing theoretically might be what they were observing.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRight.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd do you remember what time of year that was, whether it was just before you started writing that joint set of letters that got sent of early in May of ‘65?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, it was — my recollection would be — about a month before that, because we arranged for a visit. Incidentally, that call just happened to come in to Bob’s office during one of these brown bag lunch affairs. The phone rang; we were all sitting there eating our lunch, and talking, I think, about an instrumental problem at the time. The phone rang, Bob picked it up, and we went on talking lowly, and then he said something over the phone about a helium load, and, of course, at that point we all perked up; and he started talking about the atmospheric radiation and reflections and so forth. So, it was quite clear that he was talking to somebody about this experiment, because everything he was saying were problems we were working on. I don’t remember whether they arranged the visit at that point in that call, or whether they agreed to meet. I think he may have gone ahead and arranged the visit during that call, but I’ll never forget what he said when he hung up the phone. He hung up the phone, he turned around and said, in these exact words — I can hear him — “Boys, we’ve been scooped.” He knew immediately that they had seen it. He called us boys, which we were in those days. So Bob immediately realized the importance of that phone call. Now, I wish I could remember the exact stage we were at. Certainly we were measuring horns and cold loads. Whether we had the receiver working, I don’t know. We certainly did not have the apparatus on the roof at that point.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt didn’t take you very long to publish. I mean, you were publishing in ‘66, so you couldn’t have been all that far behind.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWhen did the Letters come out?\n\nHarwit:\n\nThe Letter came out, I think, In the July 1 issue. The date it was received was May 8, ‘65.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOkay, that’s makes sense. It was the spring when we went up to Bell Labs. Okay, yes, and it was that summer that we put the apparatus on the roof — summer of ‘65. So all of these precision measurements had been made before that. We understood the cold load, we knew the ground radiation from the horn, and I distinctly remember mapping that horn in the snow, and then on into the spring. So that activity was going on in the winter.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWho all went to visit them, then?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRoll and I, and Peebles and Bob Dicke, I think the four of us.\n\nHarwit:\n\nPeebles said he didn’t go.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe didn’t go? Amazing, I thought he was there. He would remember.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, this morning he said he didn’t go, at least he doesn’t remember it.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOkay. We went out in the cage and looked at the maser.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd you talked with Wilson and Penzias?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAsked them all the relevant questions about how they’d measured insertion loss in all these various pieces of pipe? How they knew they weren’t getting ground radiation — all these kinds of things into the horn. Even though before we went, we were quite sure that they were okay, because we went back and looked at the papers to make estimates of how big these problems would be, and in order to have missed that much, they would have to have had a pretty major problem.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut you hadn’t had that feeling about Ohm’s work, is that right?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s right, and the main problem there was this business of not having that helium load. See, Arno had the great advantage that he could measure all of the insertion loss between the throat of the horn and the maser flange by sticking on this helium load, which he knew, which meant the only insertion loss he had to worry about was in the throat of the horn and on out. That horn was so big that he’d really have to have a lot of absorption on the walls, no metal could have emitted that much. So, it really looked like…\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo he had a small horn which he could cover with helium?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nHe didn’t use a horn; he had a flange on the helium load, and he bolted it directly to the radiometer flange — the same flange that bolted the throat of the horn.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, fine. So he could measure everything from the narrow end of the horn throughout his whole system.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAnd they taped all the cracks — you had to worry about cracks in the horn. They had thought very carefully about all these problems, and they had good, sharp crisp answers for everything we worried about. They had done careful work.\n\nHarwit:\n\nHow much astrophysical thinking do you think they had done? Do you remember any of that?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, they had done an awful lot of thinking about the Galaxy, and what kinds of radiation could be coming in from the Galaxy, was my impression.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, that wouldn’t have given you anything that was isotropic, presumably, right?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, that’s right. Well, you could imagine a halo around the Galaxy.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, at that time people were talking about galactic halos, particularly at Cambridge, Baldwin had been doing things like that. But I guess as they say in their paper, then, in a note that they append, they say that that wouldn’t scale properly. Now this sounded more like an afterthought than anything else. I mean, the paper is remarkably empty of astrophysics.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut they have this note added in proof where they say, “The highest frequency at which the background temperature of the sky had been measured previously was 404 Mc/s, where a minimum temperature of 16°K was observed. Combining this value with our result, we find that the average spectrum of the background radiation over this frequency range can be no steeper than λ0.7. This clearly eliminates the possibility that the radiation we observe is due to radio sources of types known to exist, since in this event, the spectrum would have to be very much steeper.”\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut elsewhere they don’t have anything…It’s almost as though they want to disassociate themselves from your explanation.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, they certainly were very skeptical of this whole idea, and it clearly came to them as a surprise or a new idea when Bernie told them about it. They, during this visit, did ask a number of things about the basic idea, the physical idea behind it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSee, the only astrophysical sentence they have is, “A possible explanation for the observed excess noise temperature is the one given by Dicke, Peebles, Roll and Wilkinson in a companion letter in this issue.”\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, that reflected very much their attitude during this visit. They were certainly very receptive to having this thing finally explained. I think they were sick and tired of the problem; they had had it with working on this and trying to figure out what the heck it was, and making all these detailed measurements.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWas it during this visit that you decided that you have these companion letters you would send in?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI don’t remember. I don’t remember when that was decided.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd you also don’t remember whether it was in March or April, or when you would have been…?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat we visited up there?\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI can’t remember that either.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt wasn’t too long before the papers were sent off, though?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think the papers were written rather quickly. Jim and Bob wrote our paper. Peter and I essentially looked it over and made some comments, but I recall that happening quite quickly. My guess is it happened right after we came back from Bell Labs.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWhen did you become aware of the work that Alpher and Herman had done?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nMy recollection is that that happened in the winter after I made the measurements. The one clear thing I can remember is making the measurements up on the roof because it was fall and going into winter, and it was getting cold and I did it myself because Peter left Princeton that summer.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI see.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI was up nights and teaching the next day. It was a very tough winter and there was, of course, a lot of pressure because of this announcement. I think it was while our paper had been submitted, and I don’t even remember who it was. Oh, I think I do now. Bob received a letter from Gamow at some point, and I think Bob came down and told me about the letter — kind of casually — and said, “Well, I had one on him too because I sent a letter back pointing out something of mine that he’d forgotten.” And I’ve forgotten now what it was. It had something to do with cosmology, so it was kind of a tit for tat, joking…\n\nHarwit:\n\nGamow had done something which had not acknowledged Dicke?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIt had not acknowledged Dicke, and Bob had pointed this out in the letter that he sent back. He made kind of a joke out of it. I think that’s the first I heard of it, so if you could get the date of that letter exchange, that’s when I heard of it for the first time.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, so there is an exchange of letters between Gamow and Dicke in which Gamow complained and then Dicke sort of brushed it off.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAlright, that’s good to know. That’s good to know. But it was that way that you found out.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think that’s how I first heard about it. Not a clear recollection, but I think that’s the way I heard about it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYou wouldn’t, for example, have heard from George Field, who then remembered the McKellar and Adams CN work would not have known about the Alpher and Herman work?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI don’t think so. In fact, I think if you go and look at George’s first paper…\n\nHarwit:\n\nI can ask him sometime.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThose early CN papers, I don’t think they referenced Gamow, Alpher and Herman. I don’t think so. That all sort of came up later. I think by the time of the APS meeting, where I got up and gave a talk about this measurement that would have been the APS meeting in the spring, I guess, of ‘66. By then, people were talking about Gamow, and I think in that paper, I mentioned and acknowledged the Gamow, Alpher and Herman work. In fact, I know I did.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOkay, so you gave a talk at the American Physical Society, then, in the spring of ‘66 on the measurements that you had made with the equipment you and Peter Roll had built up.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s correct. And at that time, that was the first number that seemed to agree with this idea and the Penzias/Wilson number. Otherwise, the big bang idea was really out on a limb, as here that was predicting a whole spectrum on the basis of one measurement.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSure. Yes.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNobody believed it. In fact, we got some really irate criticism about that Letter in the Ap.J.\n\nHarwit:\n\nOh really?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, oh yes. I had people…\n\nHarwit:\n\nFrom whom?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOh, various conservative-type physicists and astronomers who said, “You guys must be nuts. Here’s this one measurement, and you guys are talking about radiation from the big bang.” They just thought that was utter…\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt was only a Letter, after all, it wasn’t as though you were…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, I know; but the idea had in fact been circulating, because Jim had been talking about the calculation.\n\nHarwit:\n\nI’m surprised in his talks nobody would have mentioned.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s amazing, isn’t it, that nobody would have brought up the Gamow, Alpher and Herman…\n\nHarwit:\n\nI was saying this morning to him, I was surprised that Chandrasekhar would not have pointed this out when you submitted the Letter to The Astrophysical Journal, because he, himself, had at one time been involved. In 1942 he and Henrich had done a calculation of nucleogenesis in the early universe under static conditions…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\n…not in an expanding [universe].\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, yes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nAnd so he must have been aware of the subsequent work of Gamow, of Alpher and of Herman, and the…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s curious, isn’t it?\n\nHarwit:\n\n…interesting thing is that Jim had, before you submitted this, Jim had, two months earlier, submitted a paper on galaxy formation in an initially hot universe which talked about this impending measurement of yours, to Ap. J., and nothing was said there. He also had sent in a paper to Physical Review the same day, or at least it was received the same day. Both of them were received March 8, 1965, which was turned down by the referees because they said it didn’t contain anything new, and they referred to the paper by Alpher, Follin and Herman which you then also cite in your letter. Now, do you have any recollection of whether that was added right at the end, perhaps, when Peebles might have already received the rejection on that first paper? He couldn’t recall this morning when I asked.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nNo, unfortunately, I remember very little of that letter.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, I think Jim would have had the rejection letter around the first of May from Pasternack, who at the time was the editor (of the Physical Review). But Pasternack evidently knew the right referee to send it to, and that referee referred to the Alpher/Follin/Herman paper because the paper that Peebles had sent in dealt with the nucleosynthesis.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut the Alpher/Herman/Follin paper, which is quite remarkable because it predicts the ratio of neutrino to photon densities at the present time, did not give the 5° K, nor did it refer to that paper. So just having seen that paper, you would not automatically have been led back to either of the two (Alpher/Herman) papers, either the Nature paper, the short note in Nature they had written, or to the long Physical Review article they had written. It’s just one of those funny quirks.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, this business of the nucleosynthesis, my impression at the time was, that Jim had reinvented the idea, and then had come across this earlier work later. I didn’t realize that it had been done in this way. Did that paper ever get published?\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, no it didn’t…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, he eventually did publish a paper about nucleosynthesis.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes. Just the helium part.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI see. That’s interesting.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThat came out in Physical Review Letters in ‘66.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nOkay. Did that refer to anything other than the (Alpher/Follin/ Herman paper)?\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, let’s see, I have there here.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat didn’t have the early radiation papers in it either?\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, I don’t think so. Let me just check, I don’t think he knew about it at the time. Okay, that’s called “Primeval Helium Abundance and the Primeval Fire Ball” and it appeared in Vol. 16 of Physical Review Letters, page 410. He refers to the Alpher, Follin and Herman paper, but not to the original one that…He may have not known at the time yet, unless…maybe that hadn’t been passed on by Bob Dicke, But the paper that he originally had sent to the Physical Review did refer to one of the Alpher/Herman papers which appeared the Annual Review of Nuclear Science, Vol. 2, in 1953. I went back and looked at that and it just has the original Alpher/Herman paper as one of the references on a tremendously long list. It doesn’t single it out as having provided a specific prediction of a temperature for today. In fact, it doesn’t mention the contemporary temperature. It’s almost as though the item of importance seemed to have been not the temperature but the chemical composition. Hayashi had written about that, and it seemed as though people were concentrating on the chemistry, getting the right abundances.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes.\n\nHarwit:\n\nThere wasn’t that much emphasis on the question of radiation, although Alpher and Herman had gone around and tried to get people to measure that early in the ‘50s.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nIs that right?\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes. They went down to the Naval Research Labs, which at the time was the only place where radio astronomy was being done in this country.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nGee, I would have thought any radio astronomer would have…\n\nHarwit:\n\nI think they were scared by the fact that Bob Dicke had measured 200 with some difficulty, perhaps. I’m not sure.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, okay. Well, also there was a lot of interesting, exciting radio astronomy to do in those days. They were probably busy measuring sources, and why spend two years doing this hard thing.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s still interesting, before we come off the topic of the blackbody radiation, which I don’t want to talk to death, I was just trying to get an impression you might have for the fact that there is sort of a persistent[2]\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat I would agree with, yes. They certainly did it, I think, carefully for the first time. Gamow never calculated anything in detail, as far as I can tell.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, that’s true, yes. I would say in any case that it’s certainly true that Gamow had the setting that he defined, and I would think it would be perfectly acceptable to attribute it to all three of them, perhaps.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nThat’s generally what I do — attribute it to all three.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s always difficult to decide priorities, particularly where one person has been the professor of another person in the group. I mean, you run into this kind thing with Hewish and Bell, for example.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, right.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt’s just very difficult for outsiders to know what went on blackboards that got erased…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nSure.\n\nHarwit:\n\n…conversations that obviously never got recorded and so on.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nI think, though, in the end the history of physics really should be based on the literature, in at least priority disputes, because there’re just…well, memories aren’t good, especially when people get older, they fall more in love with their earlier discoveries, …they seem more and more important. In the end priority really should be established by the literature, I think.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, don’t forget that the extrapolation you talk about here is not completely trivial. I mean, for example, the paper by Alpher and Herman worries about whether the microwave radiation would be seen in the presence of starlight density which also was known to be equivalent to 3° K in energy content.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRight.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNow, people have laughed at them for this, and maybe it was a blunder; I don’t have any idea. On the other hand, nowadays when you know that about half of the starlight is absorbed by dust, and that dust could be emitting radiation at quite a long wavelength, for one knew at that time. It’s not such a stupid idea to say that you’d have to worry about that, although there might be…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, they didn’t actually mention conversion or dust.\n\nHarwit:\n\nNo, they didn’t mention conversion, but I’m not sure whether it might not have been at the back of their minds. If it wasn’t, it’s again one of these rather remarkable blunders, because Bob Herman, when he was a graduate student at Princeton in pre-War days, had done some infrared measurements for his thesis work. You would expect a person like that to know what a blackbody spectrum is and that 5° K would be at quite a long wavelength.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, that’s certainly is true.\n\nHarwit:\n\nSo, you know, it’s hard to know how that all fits together.\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, I don’t know. On the face of it, the statement is ludicrous.\n\nHarwit:\n\nIt is ludicrous, isn’t it?\n\nWilkinson:\n\nAnd it’s hard to believe that two such good physicists would have made that statement, unless there were some other ideas behind it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell, they go through all this quantum mechanical general relativities stuff and then at the end of that they come out with a statement like that which just sounds very strange. But I guess…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nWell, unless,…Maybe it sounds strange to us. We’re experimenters and we immediately think of how you would go to detect this. Maybe they would think of putting a little black cube out in space and measure its temperature.\n\nHarwit:\n\nWell no, but I mean they did talk to the radio astronomers to try to see whether they could make the measurement, so they knew it was going to be in the microwave region…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nRight.\n\nHarwit:\n\n…and they knew\n\nWilkinson:\n\nBut if you didn’t know that microwave radiometers were up to this, it’s likely they talked to a radio astronomer who threw up his hands and said, “How am I going to do this?” when my receivers are 5000°. So maybe they were thinking of putting a little cube out in space or making some kind of an energy, rather than a spectrum measurement. Then the idea isn’t screwy at all, and the statement makes sense.\n\nHarwit:\n\nYes, I don’t know whether they…I’ve never heard either of them say anything about a cube in space. I mean, they’ve…Now of course this is with hindsight, because…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nYes, right. Now that you know how to do it.\n\nHarwit:\n\nBut they say that they did go and talk to radio astronomers and that it just didn’t seem to be something that…\n\nWilkinson:\n\nLet me tell you"
