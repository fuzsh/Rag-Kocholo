In his first book, Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen: The Fifty-seventh Massachusetts Veteran Volunteers in the Army of the Potomac, 1864-1865, Wilkinson relates the activities of the Union regiment that included his great-great-grandfather. He researched the regiment by examining a range of sources, including diaries, military records, and written correspondence. Joseph T. Glatthaar, writing in the Washington Post Book World, declared that Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen \"will delight and impress buffs and scholars alike.\"\n\nWilkinson followed Mother, May You Never See the Sights I Have Seen with A Scythe of Fire: The Civil War Story of the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment, wherein he chronicles the Confederate regiment that fought in some of the war's key battles, including conflicts at Gettysburg and Appomattox. In preparing the book, Wilkinson—in collaboration with Steven E. Woodworth—again turned to sources such as diaries and written correspondence. Booklist reviewer Jay Freeman hailed A Scythe of Fire as \"a gritty and gripping account of men at war,\" and Library Journal critic Robert Flatley noted the book's \"vivid battle descriptions.\" In Kirkus Reviews, meanwhile, a critic summarized A Scythe of Fire as \"a superior example of unit history\" and added that it \"provides an almost inexhaustible treasure trove for history buffs.\" Another enthusiast, Dave Larson, wrote at the 8th Georgia Infantry Home Page that A Scythe of Fire \"is an excellent book\" and a \"unique and exciting account of one of the most well-known Confederate regiments.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, February 15, 2002, Jay Freeman, review of A Scythe of Fire: The Civil War Story of the Eighth Georgia Infantry Regiment, p. 989.\n\nKirkus Reviews, December 1, 2001, review of A Scythe of Fire.\n\nLibrary Journal, January, 2002, Robert Flatley, review of A Scythe of Fire, p. 126.\n\nWashington Post Book World, May 20, 1990, Joseph T.
