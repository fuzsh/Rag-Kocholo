Give it a couple of seconds, and then if you look in the middle of the left-hand side of the page you should see a grey circle with a white arrow inside it pointing to the left. Click on it, and it will take you to the previous page.\n\nAlternatively, at the bottom of the image you will see some boxes, one of which says 12 of 52. Alter the 12 to read 11 and you'll see a green 'go' button. Click to go to the previous page.\n\nDon't forget to (a) download anything you want to save and (b) ensure you save any relevant reference numbers.\n\nPam\n\nPAM\n\nAnd again, very many thanks! Although I downloaded the page I was worried I wouldn't be able\n\nto find it again when I went back to Anc. However I did and even managed to experiment as I found\n\nthe boxes but no green arrow (!) so I clicked on show film strip and to cut a long story short found\n\nthe actual address on p10. It appears to be Pelham Avenue although difficult to read (they were at No. 13)\n\nUsing google maps I find Pelham Avenue still exists but can't work out how to see a picture of the actual house - but that's for another day! This nearly sent me Barking mad??!! and probably you too! Thanks.\n\nJill\n\nI just put the full address in to the search box on google maps and then click on the picture that comes up.\n\nSo I typed in 13 Pelham Avenue Barking Essex and got a photo of a block of 3 homes, painted white with the middle one having the door entry standing proud of its neighbours on either side.\n\nI haven't read the whole thread so if this is not the address you are looking for substitute the one you want. As Pam says just use your mouse to move up and down the street to make sure the photo you get is of the actual house because in my experience google can get it wrong.\n\nChristina"
