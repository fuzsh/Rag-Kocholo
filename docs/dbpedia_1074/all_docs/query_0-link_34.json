        "text": "OCTOBER 25, 2002 – Mascoll attacks Arthur on his connection with close friend, GEMS boss, Rodney Wilkinson, and accountant David Shorey. How could you not know that your best friend [Rodney Wilkinson], who was in your ministry, who then turned around and got a job as chief executive officer of Gems that was under your portfolio, how could you not know of his elevation? . . . There is lots to be revealed. I am a researcher and I intend to research this to the bone – Nation News 2002\n\nDid Clyde Mascoll ever reveal what he discovered in his role not as politician, not as economist but as a researcher? BU suspects it was the usual rhetoric espoused by politicians who often see there role to engage the public in aimless palaver. Since making the promise history has recorded that Mascoll resigned from the Democratic Labour Party when it became imminent parliamentary colleagues were about to switch support to the late Davis Thompson. The move effectively shunted his career.\n\nOrdinary Barbadians do not want to witness Barbados earn the label of a banana republic where corruption and malfeasance becomes the norm, yet all the signs point to the fact we are well on the way. This week a report appeared in a section of the local press and has gone ignored by many. The story has piqued the interest of the BU household because of relationship of an actor mentioned to prominent others.\n\nIan Bourne who manages Bajan Reporter uploaded a post titled 10 questions recently asked by a would-be 18-year-old first-time voter whenever Elections happen… Questions 5 and 6:\n\n5 – Why was no action taken against former GEMS boss Rodney Wilkinson, despite issues of monetary accountability being raised in successive Auditor General Reports and questions raised by Sir Harold St. John?\n\n6 – Is there a connection between Owen Arthur, his confidant Rodney Wilkinson, the red-flagging of operations at GEMS of Barbados and the opening and operating of Executive Car Rentals at Worthings, Christ Church?\n\nThe article carried in the press this week reports that several finance companies in Barbados have repossessed over 100 cars from Executive Car Rentals effectively closing the business. According to the report Executive Car Rentals owes MILLIONS to creditors."
