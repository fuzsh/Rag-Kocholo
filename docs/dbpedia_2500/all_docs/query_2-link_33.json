        "text": "Eleven years after the release of Puss in Boots, the feline is making his grand return.\n\nThe animated film, written by Paul Fisher, brings the adorable feline back to the big screen with more action, adventure and comedic moments. The movie also brings together an internationally known ensemble cast to voice the characters, including Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Olivia Colman and Florence Pugh.\n\nDirected by Joel Crawford and co-director by Januel Mercado, Puss in Boots: The Last Wish follows Puss (Banderas) on his epic adventure to find the mythical wishing star and restore his nine lives. After dying eight times, a doctor advises the cat to retire, but that’s an idea that Puss is having a tough time accepting. In an attempt to retire, Puss temporarily stays in an obsessed cat lover’s home, but while he is there, Puss meets Perro (Harvey Guillén). The fellow feline then joins Puss and Kitty Softpaws (Pinault) on their trek into the Black Forest in search of the star. “When you only have one life, that’s what makes it special,” Kitty says to Puss in the film’s trailer. During their journey, the trio faces several evil characters and obstacles, all threatening Puss’ life.\n\nPuss has been featured in several movies over the years, including Shrek 2, Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After. The feline then had his own spinoff in 2011 with Puss in Boots. Now, the cat’s story continues with Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.\n\nFind out more about the characters below."
