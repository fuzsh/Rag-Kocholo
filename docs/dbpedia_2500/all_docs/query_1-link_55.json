X3\n\nAs well know, \"101 Dalmatians The Series\" like most shows, requires voice artists.\n\nAnd like most, Animated Voice Artists, they can mainly be drafted in for alot.\n\nWe know on cases like, \"Luckys\" voice being like, \"Pamela Adlon\". Whom also voices, Spinelli in, Reccess & Bobby in, King Of The Hill.\n\nLucky then has his, Second voice of \"Debi Mae West\", Whom also voices Mae Zadler in, Metal Gear.\n\nRolly, Cadpig & Anita are voiced by, Kath Soucie.\n\nWhom we all know as, Phil & Lil (Whoms surnames are ironically, Deville. o.o) within Rugrats along with, Sally In, SatAM and the list can go on.\n\nFrank Welker whom plays, Steven & Scorch of course is known world wide for his voicing roles, such as Megatron, Nibbler in Futurama & Abu in Aladin.\n\n\"Jim Cummings\" whom play, Jasper, Mayor Pig & LT. Pug. (He likes to play roles which have, P as the third the last letter, doesn't he? o.o)\n\nWhom also does the voice for, Ray in, Princess Frog, Winnie Pooh & Tigger as well as Shang Tsung in, Mortal Combat.\n\nJeff Bennett known as, \"Roger\" & \"Blaze\", also known for, Johnny Bravo and, Kyle Katarn in the, Jedi Game Series...\n\nCharlotte Rae whom plays, \"Nanny\" may also be known for her role as, Aunt Figg in, Tom & Jerry Film.\n\nWell, At least she knows to do better and later play, \"Nanny\" for, \"101 Dalmatians The Series\", eh? X3\n\nPam Dawber whom is know to voice, \"Perdita\" may also be known for her role as, Mindy in the popular, Sci-Fi, Mort & Mindy...X3\n\nHowever...Did you also know that the, \"101 Dalmatians\" also has some voice artists high on the radar? X3\n\nYou know, Starbuck? That Sea Sick, Pants loving Sailor, seen in \"Shipwrecked\" & \"Valentine Daze\"?\n\nYou know whom he's voiced by? Here's a hint.\n\n\"What you looking at, Butthead!?\"\n\nThat's right, It's Tom F. Wilson of, Biff in, BTTF. X3\n\nSo, If any of you Pups know any other voice artists whom have provided voices for, \"101 Dalmatians The Series\", Feel free to say them, here. *Hugs* X3\n\nLet's see whom you, Pups can find in, \"101 Dalmatians The Series\". *Hugs* X3\n\nPost by Two-Tone on\n\n*gets ready to smack Bab with a paper fan* you forgot Tara Strong!\n\nTara Strong of course voiced Two-Tone in 101 Dalmatians the series, and yeah she also voiced the chicken too aka Spot, and Cruella's dog Vendella. Tara also voiced Angel (experiment 624) on Lilo and Stitch the series, Iggy and Lemmy Koopa in the Adventures of Super Mario 3 and Super Mario World, she also voiced Barbra Gordon/Batgirl in Batman the Animated series, she also voiced Bubbles of the Powerpuff Girls, Raven from Teen Titans, Omi from Xaolin Showdown, Timmy Turner from Fairlyodd Parents, Dill from Rugrats, Toot from Drawn Together (using her Bubbles voice), and Truffles from Chowder (using her Spot voice)\n\nnext Dipstick's voice actor Thom Adcox Hernandez, Gargoyles fans will know him better as the voice of Lexington.\n\nnext Christine Cavanaugh whom we've heard in the series as Wizzer and as Dumpling, Christine also voiced Chuckie from Rugrats, Dexter from Dexter;s Lab and Gosalyn Mallard from Darkwing Duck and Sonic fans know her best as Bunnie Rabbot from Sonic SatAM\n\nand to round out the voices of Mooch's gang there's Mooch's voice Danny Cooksey. Danny had a 15 minute appearence in Terminator 2 as a friend of John Connor's, Danny also appeared in the Nickelodeon series Salute your Shorts as Bobby Budnik, Danny also voiced Montana Max from Tiny Toon Adventures, Hotstreak from Static Shock, Dave the Barbarian from Dave the Barbarian, and Jack Spicer from Xiaolin Showdown\n\nPost by Shadow Dearly on\n\n*gets ready to smack Bab with a paper fan* you forgot Tara Strong!\n\nTara Strong of course voiced Two-Tone in 101 Dalmatians the series, and yeah she also voiced the chicken too aka Spot, and Cruella's dog Vendella.

Jim Cummings didn't voice Jasper. Jasper was voiced by Michael McKean, whom some of you may remember from the movie, \"This is Spinal Tap\".\n\nHorace was voiced by David Lander, an actor who also voiced Thumper in \"A Bug's Life\", and he was also the dean in \"Scary Movie 1\".\n\nPost by babclayman on\n\nOn the part of, Jasper, I did look him up and I believe it doesnsay, Jim Cummings. You can hear, Jasper sometimes when you hear, Lt Pug speaking as well. X3\n\nWith, Dan Cookey for, Mooch, He also plays, Rahm Dehud in, Different Strokes along with one of Johns friends in, Terminator 2. X3\n\nIt is quite surprising on what you can find for these characters, eh? X3\n\nAlso, I apologise for not mentioning, Tara, TT. I did make the thread at Midnight and I did get restricted by time.\n\nO.O\n\nSo, What other things can you bring up for these, Pups then? *Hugs* X3\n\nPost by babclayman on\n\nAlso, I also believe she is the voice of, Aunt Coco in, \"Lucky To Be Alone\"\n\nI believe she is also, Queenie in the episode, \"Channels\". X3\n\nIf you listen closely, you're able to hear, Cruella in her voice. X3\n\nThough, She also is, Dr.Wittaker as well from episodes such as...\"Shots & Spots\", \"Leisure Lawsuit\" or \"Cone Head\". X3\n\nWhile I have my suspicions, I know, \"Cecil P Devil\" is voiced by, Rob Paulsen. Also known for, Pinky in, Pinky & Brain, Yakko Warner, 625 in, Stitch and Antoine in, SatAM.\n\nAnd, Toran Caudell (Hey Arnold himself) is the voice of, Tripod. X3\n\nAlso, He was only, Forteen when he did the role of, Tripod...\n\nThough, I am unsure whom voices, Uncle Beamer. I searched and can't find whom voices him.\n\nStill, Any other knowledge on, \"101 Dalmatians The Series\" voice artists? *Hugs* X3"
