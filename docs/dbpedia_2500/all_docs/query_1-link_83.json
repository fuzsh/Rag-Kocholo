        "text": "A form of Typecasting, linked with Pigeonholed Voice Actor. More notable in Japanese (because of the larger pool of seiyuu available), two or more voice actors are often put together in one anime series, most of the times as characters with a special relationship. Just like Pigeonholed Voice Actor, although they're not typecast into one type of character, but if one voice actor shows up, there's a good chance that a certain voice actor will show up too, sometimes as characters with a unique relationship with the first voice actor's characters. And their role relationship will also occasionally be pigeonholed. Take note that the examples below may or may not list all the shows in which two actors have worked in together.\n\nAlso see Those Two Actors for the live action version.\n\nExamples of Relationship Voice Actor include:\n\nJapanese Voice Actors (Seiyuu)\n\nKaori Nazuka and Yuko Sanpei:\n\nIn Daa Daa Daa, Nazuka as Miyu and Sanpei as Kanata.\n\nIn Eureka Seven, Nazuka as Eureka and Sanpei as Renton.\n\nNatsu no Arashi, where Nazuka as Kaja Bergmann and Sanpei as Hajime.\n\nNanaka 6/17, Nazuka as Satsuki Arashiyama and Sanpei as Nenji Nagihara (6 years old) & Yūki.\n\nCanvas 2: Niji Iro no Sketch, where Nazuka as Housen Elis and Sanpei as a school girl.\n\nAtelier Totori has Nazuka as Totori and Sanpei as Gino.\n\nTomokazu Seki and Ayako Kawasumi: Seki often played as characters who wanted Kawasumi's character, either by force or not. Hence, it's quite often seeing Seki as the villain, or Kawasumi as the heroine that Seki's character wanted, including Reiji Kageyama and Ruriko Ikusawa in Gate Keepers, Gilgamesh and Saber in Fate Stay Night, Onyx and Gwendolyn in Odin Sphere. However, they also play genuine pair/love interests, such as Haru Glory and Elie in Groove Adventure Rave. Or cosplay couple Tanaka and Ohno in Genshiken. Or a She Is Not My Girlfriend, Opposites Attract type of couple in Nodame Cantabile. Or one-sided romantic interests as Kitagawa-kun and Kaori from Kanon Or getting their roles inverted (from Fate/stay night) as Ezio Auditore and Lucrezia Borgia respectively.\n\nHikaru Midorikawa and Takehito Koyasu often play two characters that rival each other. From Tamahome and Hotohori in Fushigi Yuugi, Heero and Zechs in Gundam Wing, Masaki and Shu in Super Robot Wars to Zelgadis and Rezo in Slayers.\n\nDoes Softon and Bobo-bo count even though it was for a short while?\n\nAs well as Fujimiya Aya/Ran versus Schuldig in Weiss Kreuz.\n\nThis video (you'll need a Nico Nico Douga account to access this one) will probably amuse you with their respective roles.\n\nToshiyuki Morikawa and Nobutoshi Canna, as either rivals (Griffith/Guts in Berserk, Kyosuke/Axel in Super Robot Wars), to allies (Tousen/Nnoitra in Bleach, Kiyota/Jin in Slam Dunk), to unrelated people, but STILL in one series (Mitsurugi/Maxi in Soul Series)\n\nThough not as famous as those two early examples, Hikaru Midorikawa and Nobutoshi Canna are often co-working together, as they once are under the same music group.\n\nAs noted above, in Super Robot Wars, Hikaru did Masaki Andoh, Nobutoshi did Axel Almer.\n\nIn Fushigi Yuugi, Hikaru is Tamahome and Nobutoshi is Tasuki, two Suzaku warriors.\n\nIn Persona 3, Hikaru is Akihiko Sanada, while Nobutoshi is Takaya. They're both the game's White Haired Pretty Boys, though they're on different factions.\n\nThey both get landed to the Lancer roles in Type Moon's Fate series. Nobutoshi did Cu Chullain (Fate Lancer), while Hikaru did Diarmuid Ua Duibhne (Zero Lancer). Then they really reunite in Fate/Unlimited Codes when Zero Lancer can fight Fate Lancer.\n\nTomokazu Seki and Shinichiro Miki. Between the members of the Weiss Kreuz group (consisting them, Koyasu Takehito and Yuuki Hiro), they are the one who often got roles in the same series. The biggest example was Sousuke/Kurz from Full Metal Panic!. However there are also other instances such as Assassin-Gilgamesh in the Fate/stay night anime, whereas shortly after Assassin was killed in the anime, Gilgamesh makes his entrance (exit Miki, enter Seki). Or in the Martian Successor Nadesico. In the first series, Seki's character Gai rides the blue Aestevalis and have a very over-the-top personality. In the OVA Prince of Darkness, the one who rides the blue Aestevalis and have a rather jolly, flamboyant personality (not outright over the top, but still rather enthusiastic) is Miki's character Saburouta. (exit Seki, enter Miki).\n\nJust a sidenote, in Pokémon, Seki was Kenji (Tracey) and Miki was Kojiro (James). Their encounters were mostly in the Orange Islands (so its enter Seki, exit Seki, with Miki staying still).\n\nVan Fanel and Allen Schezar in Vision of Escaflowne\n\nManji and Shira in Blade of the Immortal\n\nRival band vocalists Shuiichi Shindou of Bad Luck and Taki Aizawa of Ask in Gravitation\n\nRival racers Takumi Fujiwara and Keisuke Takahashi in Initial D, along with Koyasu Takehito for the ride\n\nBob Makihara and Masataka Takayanagi in Tenjho Tenge\n\nMinamoto no Yorihisa (Miki) and Tenma Morimura (Seki), the Seiryuu Hachiyou in Harukanaru Toki no Naka de.\n\nIn Hakuouki's prequel, Reimeiroku, Miki played the role of Hijikata while Seki as the main chracter, Ibuki Ryuunosuke.\n\nTomokazu Seki has an alleged rivalry with Tomokazu Sugita . Their characters often have strong interactions with each other as well: Sugita's Yuuichi Aizawa from Kanon, Kagami Mikage from Ayashi no Ceres, and Hideki Motosuwa from Chobits, to Seki's Jun Kitagawa, Alex Howell and Hiromu Shinbo, respectively. Lampshaded in an episode of Lucky Star, in which the character Sugita voices works in the same anime shop as Meito Anisawa/Anime Tenchou, Seki's role.\n\nTaken to hilarious extremes at the Comiket episode, where Meito Anisawa and Clerk Sugita have a What Do You Mean It's Not Awesome? duel in selling their own merchandise.\n\nAlso, when Seki gets to be in Endless Frontier as Aledy Na'ash, Sugita gets right in as what could be considered Aledy's rival: Hamelen Silbato.\n\nKotono Mitsuishi and Houko Kuwashima. From Noir to Gundam SEED to Claymore, their characters have been paired, usually in yuri fanfics. Don't ask.\n\nThe 1983 TV series Stop!Hibari-kun! featured voice actors Satomi Majima and Toru Furuya as the two central characters, Hibari and Kosaku. In this series, Hibari, a yakuza boss's son who is living life as and posing as a girl, develops a crush on his houseguest, Kosaku. In real life, Majima (Hibari) and Furuya (Kosaku) married in 1985, and Majima subsequently retired from voice acting.\n\nRyoko Shintani and Miyuki Sawashiro: Milfie and Mint, Miyata and Serizawa, Himeko and Sobana, Sae and Landlord, Nami and Maria, Yuno and Shinkuro, Sachi and Dorm Leader, Tetsuro and Maria, Claire and Rachel.\n\nMore than half of these are Studio Shaft works.\n\nSoichiro Hoshi and Akira Ishida. Just count how many times they're playing characters with strong connections. From Keele/Reid of Tales of Eternia, Kira/Athrun in Gundam SEED, Sano/Inumaru in The Law of Ueki. And even those without that much strong connection: Yukimura/Hanbei in Sengoku Basara 2, Bartz/Kuja in Dissidia.\n\nIn Naruto Ishida plays Gaara and Hoshi plays Yashamaru, his uncle and the only person he ever loved. They also play friends Hakkai and Goku in Saiyuki.\n\nIn Shining Tears X Wind, Hoshi is Souma while Ishida is Kiriya.\n\nEisen (Hoshi) and Abe no Yasuaki (Ishida), the Genbu Hachiyou in Harukanaru Toki no Naka de.\n\nGiou Yuki (Hoshi) and Wakamiya Kanata (Ishida) in Uragiri wa Boku no Namae wo Shitteiru\n\nCait Sith Cheshire (Hoshi) and Virgo Asmita (Ishida) in Saint Seiya: The Lost Canvas\n\nSoichiro Hoshi and Takehito Koyasu. Counting up, we got Kira/Mwu, Kazuki/Juubei, Yukimura/Sasuke, Yuki/Takashiro\n\nSoichiro Hoshi and Kenichi Suzumura. Being in the same company, they have done twins (in the early Ouran drama CDs) and bitter rivals (Gundam SEED Destiny's Kira/Shinn).\n\nTakahiro Sakurai and Kenichi Suzumura are known best friends in real life, even going so far as having their own radio station. They usually appear together in a lot of things, especially BL audio dramas, but none so infamous as them playing opposites in the Final Fantasy VII compilation as Cloud Strife and Zack Fair, respectfully. They also form the singing duo R-16.\n\nWhenever a series has Mamiko Noto, you may also expect Kaori Shimizu to show up. This instance has been seen in School Rumble, Mariasama ga Miteru, Godannar and Mugen no Frontier: SRW OG Saga, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu and Tales of Hearts (reversed. Shimizu was announced first before Noto). Sometimes this occur to Ueda Kana and Kaori Shimizu too, but in less frequency (Mariasama ga Miteru, Lyrical Nanoha, Nogizaka Haruka no Himitsu). Reportedly, Kana and Kaori are good friends, and Kaori has the dubious honor to be the closest to be able to mimic Mamiko's voice (which is reportedly very hard to do).\n\nIt gets funnier if you connect Tales of Hearts and Hell Girl. Kaori Shimizu (who plays Richia Spodune in Tales of Hearts) gets to guest star in the show as a girl who is eventually sent to Hell, whereas she is carried to hell in the ferry by Enma Ai (Mamiko Noto) and Ichimoku Ren, who is played by the same guy who did Hisui Hearts in Tales of Hearts, Masaya Matsukaze.\n\nAnother interesting note in Kaori Shimizu's relationship is with Yumi Kakazu. There are two shows that makes a different parallel to their roles: Super Robot Wars and Godannar. One of them will play a senior lady in war (Lamia (Kaori) in SRW, Shizuru (Yumi) in Godannar) probably one with large breasts, while the other one will play a younger, junior pilot compared to the other (Seolla (Yumi) in SRW, Lou (Kaori) in Godannar). Thing is, these 'senior' ladies will appear to get killed in the middle of the show, only to be brought back later. Lamia 'dies' in Original Generations bonus section, and in OG Gaiden, she came back Brainwashed and Crazy and eventually restored. Shizuru is killed off in the end of Godannar Season 1, and Season 2's first episode deals with her resurrection.\n\nIn a more recent times, Kaori Shimizu has also developed a relationship another guest cameo of Hell Girl, namely... Marina Inoue. They've both worked together in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS (Signum and Erio), Tales of Hearts (Richia and Kohak), Arcana Heart (Zenia and Petra), and Rio -Rainbow Gate!- (Rio and Rosa)\n\nRyotaro Okiayu and Tetsu Inada. They like to play as allies, or sometimes closer than that. No, not Yaoi stuffs. Let's see...\n\nIn the crossover of Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors, Warriors Orochi. Orochi is voiced by Okiayu, whereas one of his allies, Lu Bu, is voiced by Inada.\n\nIn Bleach, Okiayu is Kuchiki Byakuya, Captain of the 6th Division, while Inada is Sajin Komamura, Captain of the 7th Division (Okiayu's squad number plus 1 = Inada's squad number).\n\nIn the Super Robot Wars Original Generation, Okiayu voices Raidese F. Branstein, while Inada voices his Aloof Big Brother Elzam von Branstein. In OG Saga', Inada is Ezel Granada of the Orchestral Army, whereas Okiayu is... Ezel's ex-right hand man Katze Kotolonos and Ezel's war-rival Rubor Cucullus. In Masou Kishin, Okiayu and Inada end up voicing both of Tytti's familiars Freki and Geri.\n\nIn Castlevania (especially Dawn of Sorrow), Okiayu is Genya Arikado (a.k.a. Alucard), Inada is Julius Belmont. And they play as the Obi Wan of the hero Soma Cruz... or can team up in one of the outcomes of the bad ending.\n\nThey're also Zero and Arthur in Marvel vs. Capcom 3.\n\nRyotaro Okiayu also is paired up with Hikaru Midorikawa in the rival/yaoi guy roles. They're apparently good friends in real life, and happen to like Super Robot Wars together.\n\nIn Gundam Wing, Hikaru voices Heero, to Okaiyu's Treize.\n\nHikaru is Soma to Okiayu's Alucard in Castlevania\n\nAre Rivals / possible romantic interests Georik Zaberisk and Mikhail Ramphet respectively in Animamundi: Dark Alchemist.\n\nSpeaking of Super Robot Wars, Hikaru is Masaki, Okiayu is Rai, they're not much related, but at least they fight under the same banner.\n\nIn Slam Dunk, Hikaru is Rukawa, Okiayu is Mitsui.\n\nThere's no yaoi (except in fanfiction), but they're also Crawford and Schuldig.\n\nThen again, there's Clannad, where they barely interact with each other's characters (Okiayu is Akio, Hikaru is Yusuke).\n\nIn Lunar 2: Eternal Blue, Hikaru is Hiro and Okiayu is Ronfar, the only two men in the party for a large portion of the game.\n\nIn a dubbing-related one: Midorikawa as Tom Prinze and Okiayu as Roman Bridger in the dub of Scream 3.\n\nHikaru Midorikawa and (with a girl, finally!) Yukari Tamura has also worked together in several occasions:\n\nKyouya Takamachi and Nanoha Takamachi in the original Lyrical Nanoha.\n\nAdell and Rozalin in Disgaea 2: Cursed Memories\n\nKnight & Ellis Valentine in Godannar\n\nYoshino Yuusuke & Mei Sunohara in Clannad (At least Mei is a Yuusuke fan so the relationship is there)\n\nSatoshi Hino tends to get paired with Rie Kugimiya's Tsundere roles. Cases in point: The Familiar of Zero (Saito/Louise) and Shakugan no Shana (Yuji/Shana). Masashi Ebara also appears from time to time as a father figure to her, for example as Hohenheim in Fullmetal Alchemist and Alastor in Shakugan no Shana.\n\nKugimiya and Hino's roles are subverted as, respectively, Kagura and her homicidal brotherKamui in Gintama\n\nAnd then they have a weird one when both of them voice the male and female forms of Phantasos.\n\nMasakazu Morita and Fumiko Orikasa often play as friends or even love interests. Proven with Bleach (Ichigo/Rukia) and the new generation of Saint Seiya (Seiya/Saori). They're unrelated in Gundam SEED Destiny, though (Morita is Auel, Orikasa is Meyrin).\n\nSpeaking of Morita, he is also often cast with Junichi Suwabe. They're either pairs Auel (Morita) and Sting (Suwabe) in SEED Destiny or rivals Ichigo (Morita) and Grimmjow (Suwabe) in Bleach, Tidus (Morita) and Seymour (Suwabe) in Final Fantasy X.\n\nThis doesn't stop fans from pairing their SEED Destiny characters, though, despite the fact they never even met on screen.\n\nIt's also rather fun to note that Jun Fukuyama and Norio Wakamoto are Lelouch and Emperor Charles respectively in Code Geass, while previously in Tales of Destiny 2, they're also enemies (Fukuyama is Kyle, Wakamoto is Barbatos). Also noted that Fukuyama's side is usually backed by a character played by Hikaru Midorikawa (Li Xingke and Judas, respectively).\n\nA case of working together between Fukuyama and Midorikawa (minus Wakamoto) can also be seen in Gravion, whereas Fukuyama is Touga, while Midorikawa is Raven.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of Wakamoto Norio, expect George Nakata not to be too far behind.\n\nAnd back to Midorikawa and Fukuyama: Marth and Roy, anyone?\n\nBack to Fukuyama and Wakamoto, one-shot example: Hayate the Combat Butler, where Fukuyama voices Watanuki vi Britannia Puppet Butler, and Wakamoto does the Lemony Narrator.\n\nAnd now, take Fukuyama, Wakamoto, Midorikawa, and add Takahiro Sakurai who voices Suzaku Kururugi and let them duke it out in Dissidia Final Fantasy where they play the following: Onion Knight, Chaos, Firion, and Cloud.\n\nToshiyuki Morikawa and Nozomu Sasaki are siblings in real life, and if they're in the same series they usually play brothers (the Frost brothers in Gundam X, with Morikawa as Shagia and Sasaki as Olba) or best friends (Morikawa was Takashi and Sasaki was Youta in the Video Girl Ai CD dramas)\n\nSaeko Chiba and Yuuka Nanri are good friends and even had a duo for a time. Chances are, if they're in the same series, they'll play either sisters (like the Iijyuin twins in Prince of Tennis) or rivals (like Natsuki and Nao in My-HiME).\n\nNot that they do this often, but Toshiyuki Morikawa and Yuko Mizutani are famously known for their relationship as Kyosuke Nanbu and Excellen Browning. They actually did this stitch back then during Tekkaman Blade, as D-Boy/Blade and Miyuki/Rapier\n\nAnother series they both worked together on, but with no relationship (we hope) is Kingdom Hearts, namely Sephiroth and Minnie Mouse.\n\nThey also worked together in After War Gundam X as Shagia Frost (above) and (this is fairly odd) Caris Nautilus.\n\nSome of the Rival Schools cast is actually a revisit from GaoGaiGar. Nobuyuki Hiyama is Guy and Batsu and Tomoe Hanba is Mikoto and Hinata (and they reprise their love interest relationship in GGG as well). Miki Narahashi plays an Eagle Land character in both series (Swan and Tiffany) as well.\n\nGundam 00 revisits and reverses the Kingdom Hearts main cast. Sora is now pissed off at Riku, who got promoted from The Rival to The Hero (sort of). Yes, they got the same voices with Saji Crossroad and Setsuna F. Seiei, respectively. (Though Saji did became pissed at Setsuna ( in season 2), it's not because of the latter's character position).\n\nMore evident starting episode 11 of season 2, when Saji and Setsuna co-pilot the eponymous mobile suit.\n\nKeiji Fujiwara voiced red haired baddies for both series, namely Ali Al-Saachez and Axel.\n\nMamoru Miyano and Maaya Sakamoto have been two (possible) couples on two totally polarizing animes debuting in 2006. First they were Tamaki and Haruhi, and then they were Light and Kiyomi as well as Kyrie and Morte.\n\nAnd it doesn't help that Masaya Matsukaze is respectively Kyouka Ohtori and Teru Mikami.\n\nLater on, the former two would be working on Soul Eater as Death the Kid and Crona respectively (oddly enough many ship them as a Crack Pairing of sorts).\n\nAnd finally they are going to work together in Star Driver\n\nAya Hirano (Konata) and Kaori Fukuhara (Tsukasa) have worked together on a few occasions. In Macross Frontier they played two Bridge Bunnies who occasionally also served as Those Two Girls. And in Fight Ippatsu! Juuden-chan!! Kaori played Plug, one of the two leads, and Aya was actually a Little Bad.\n\nOne of the recent noticeable voice acting pairs is Haruka Tomatsu and Kana Hanazawa. Tomatsu is good for older sister type characters, while Hanazawa is good for younger roles. They've already appeared alongside each other in To LOVE-Ru, Kyouran Kazoku Nikki, Kannagi and Asu no Yoichi, as well as voicing the master/servant pair of Hedyeh and Ayse in Ladies versus Butlers!! They also do have a Rival relationship with one another with Tomacchan as Kinjou Manami and Hanazawa as Futaba Aoi in Asobi Ni Iku Yo!\n\nKana Hanazawa also seemed to have Relationship Voice Actor with Hiroshi Kamiya, although the roles are less stereotyped. There's Nadeko and Araragi from Bakemonogatari, Anri and Izaya from Durarara!!!, and Tenshi and Otonashi from Angel Beats!.\n\nTrailing not far behind is Miyuki Sawashiro who has voiced Suruga, Celty, and Iwasawa respectively.\n\nKana Hanazawa and Miyuki Sawashiro have also worked beside one another in Black★Rock Shooter (Mato and Yomi), Deadman Wonderland (Shiro and Toto), Kamisama Dolls (Mahiru and Kuuko), Kannagi (Zange and Tsugumi), Strike Witches (Amaki and Perinne), and Mayo Chiki (Kureha and Kosame).\n\nMai Nakahara and Toshihiko Seki have played opposite each other twice as a fiery heroine and her Tall, Dark and Snarky love interest...first as Prier and Croix in La Pucelle, and then again as Mai Tokiha and Reito Kanzaki in My-HiME.\n\nJun Fukuyama and Ami Koshimizu. First Code Geass then Spice and Wolf, Saki, then most recently, Nyanpire.\n\nAlso Jun Fukuyama and Ryoka Yuzuki. First Tales of Destiny 2 then Busou Renkin\n\nLove Hina is even more enjoyable when you remember that Megumi Hayashibara and Yasunori Matsumoto, the voice actors for Haruka and Seta, also played Lina and Gourry in Slayers.\n\nDon't forget that they're also Aki and Noal in Tekkaman Blade.\n\nAnd Crysta and Zak in the Japanese version of Fern Gully.\n\nHitomi Nabatame has a variety of relationships with voice actors, she and Kenichi Suzumura have done Drama CD/Anime of H-game OVAs together which often portrays them as a couple. Although she is more noted for her work with Shizuka Itoh and Mamiko Noto. She also works with Yui Sakakibara in in a lot of Eroge (non-yuri of course).\n\nRomi Park and Rie Kugimiya, ever since co-working as Edward and Alphonse Elric, have been appearing in the same show often. They're also Naoto Shirogane and Rise Kujikawa, Regene Regetta and Nena Trinity, also Hitsugaya Toshiro and Kurotsuchi Nemu... or Kurosaki Karin, and Switzerland and Liechtenstein.\n\nYukari Tamura and Mai Nakahara have already appeared in four five six seven series working with each other: Lyrical Nanoha, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, Clannad, My-HiME, Mai-Otome, Katanagatari and Myself Yourself.\n\nFrom Rika Furude and Rena Ryuugu to Nanoha Takamachi and Teana Lanster to Mei Sunohara and Nagisa Furukawa to Midori and Mai Tokiha to Togame and Nanami Yasuri to Shuri and Asami is a long way to go indeed.\n\nMaking it two out of five, Satsuki Yukino voices Shmion and Misae Sagara.\n\nHere's a set of five six, from Hayate the Combat Butler to Saki: Kana Ueda (Sakuya, Saki), Ryoko Shiraishi (Hayate, Mako), Rie Kugimiya (Nagi, Yuuki), Shizuka Ito (Hinagiku, Hisa, who are both Student Council President), Jun Fukuyama (Puppet Butler, Kyoutarou), and Yui Horie (Sonia, Mihoko)\n\nAnd then, still in Saki, Jun Fukuyama and Ami Koshimizu (Nodoka), who played Lelouch and Kallen in Code Geass respectively.\n\nSaki, whether intentional or not, seems to enjoy using this, as Touka, voiced by Minori Chihara, has a butler, Hagiyoshi, voiced by Daisuke Ono. These two played Nagato and Koizumi in Suzumiya Haruhi.\n\nAdd to that Wahaha Satomi, voiced by Natsuko Kuwatani, who voiced Ryoko Asakura, desu~.\n\nAdditionally, Kaori Fukuhara (Koromo) and Minori Chihara (Touka) as Tsukasa Hiiragi and Minami Iwasaki from Lucky Star respectively.\n\nStill another one in Saki: Teru, who's voiced by Mai Nakahara, Mihoko, voiced by Yui Horie, and Yumi, voice by Yuu Kobayashi. Those three voiced Rena Ryuugu, Hanyuu, and Satoshi Houjou from Higurashi no Naku Koro ni respectively.\n\nSpeaking of Mai Nakahara and Ryoko Shiraishi, they worked together for the Clannad Visual Novel, with Nakahara voicing Nagisa and Shiraishi voicing Kappei respectively.\n\nAmi Koshimizu (Nodoka), Yui Horie (Mihoko), Daisuke Ono (Hagiyoshi), Yuu Kobayashi(Yumi), and Rie Kugimiya (Yuuki) in Umineko no Naku Koro ni as Rosa, Maria, Battler, Kanon and Shannon respectively.\n\nNow we have Minori Chihara (Touka) as the voice of Sakutarou.\n\nAmi Koshimizu and Yui Horie personally have been together from quite some time since School Rumble (Tenma and Eri) and Persona 4 (Yukiko and Chie).\n\nFrom Mariasama ga Miteru to Saki: Kana Ueda (Saki), Ami Koshimizu (Nodoka), Rie Kugimiya (Yuuki), Shizuka Ito (Hisa), and Yuko Kaida (Jun) who voiced Yumi, Kanako, Touko, Rei and Minako respectively.\n\nHigurashi no Naku Koro ni in relation to its spiritual sequel Umineko no Naku Koro ni:\n\nDaisuke Ono: Mamoru Akasaka in Higurashi, Battler Ushiromiya in Umineko.\n\nYui Horie: Hanyuu in Higurashi, Maria Ushiromiya in Umineko.\n\nMiki Ito: Miyo Takano in Higurashi, Eva Ushiromiya in Umineko.\n\nYukari Tamura: Rika Furude in Higurashi, Frederica Bernkastel in Umineko. This alone has spawned multiple guesses on the exact relationship between Rika Furude and Frederica Bernkastel.\n\nDaisuke Ono and Yukari Tamura have been together for quite some time now, starting with AIR (Yukito and Michiru), then Higurashi no Naku Koro ni (Akasaka and Rika) to Umineko no Naku Koro ni (Battler and Bernkastel)\n\nAlso, both were in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS; Ono as Verossa and Tamura as the title character.\n\nDon't forget Asuta and Tomari in Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl.\n\nKikuko Inoue: Akane Sonozaki in Higurashi, Virgilia in Umineko\n\nJurota Kosugi: Okonogi in Higurashi, Krauss Ushiromiya(and Okonogi again) in Umineko\n\nYuu Kobayashi: Satoshi Hojo in Higurashi, Kanon in Umineko\n\nIn addition to the Higurashi and Umineko examples above, Yui Horie and Yukari Tamura have co-starred in a number of other shows, oftentimes as competing haremettes/love interests of the male lead. Examples include Ayu and Mai, Yasuna and Tomari, and Kotori and Sakura. (They've also temporarily formed a singing duo in Real Life.)\n\nAnd then you get something completely different considering Yui Horie as Akane Mishima and Yukari Tamura as Seppuku Kuro Usagi in Kämpfer.\n\nAlso, Yukari Tamura as Yamada and Yui Horie as Miharu Takeshita in B Gata H Kei.\n\nJun Fukuyama and Shizuka Ito have appeared in quite a few shows alongside each other now: To Heart 2, Saki, and that Expy Watanuki vi Britannia appearance in Hayate the Combat Butler.\n\nThat might be a nod to their roles in ×××HOLiC, with Shizuka Ito as Himawari and Jun Fukuyama as Watanuki.\n\nTomokazu Sugita and Daisuke Ono: adult Chrono and Verossa in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS, Kyon and Koizumi in Suzumiya Haruhi, as well as Ronove and Battler in Umineko no Naku Koro ni.\n\nThey're now also Katakura Kagetsunaa and Date Shigezane, and Lucille Eris and Shion Astari.\n\nThey're together in Persona 4 as fellow athletes Daisuke Nagase and Kou Ichijou.\n\nEmi Shinohara and Miki Itou managed to go from rivals to soeurs to sisters-in-law. The difference is that now Sachiko's older than Youko, but she's still in the younger position. Oh, and Touko is Youko's maid.\n\nThe entire five man band of Suzumiya Haruhi doesn't just show up in Lucky Star. All of them are also in Dragonaut: The Resonance. Hell, Itsuki and Yuki are the leads in the show.\n\nKikuko Inoue and Soichiro Hoshi did a bit of relationship voice acting where their characters are very close to one another at some point, Kikuo voiced Kira's foster mother in Gundam SEED, Please Teacher! as Kei's spouse and being Grace's puppet in Macross Frontier being the only exception.\n\nIf Soichiro Hoshi and Masayo Kurata appear in a mecha series together, it's likely that they'll play teammates, such as Gun X Sword (Hoshi as Michael and Kurata as Fasalina), Gundam SEED (Hoshi as Kira and Kurata as Mayura), Muv-Luv (Hoshi as Takeru and Kurata as Chizuru) and late into Code Geass (Hoshi as Gino and Kurata as Rakshata).\n\nKanae Ito and Aki Toyosaki have three roles where they were together. Kanae Ito is Amu Hinamori(Dia if you want to count her as well), Nana Astar Deviluke, and Ruiko Saten while Aki Toyosaki is Su, Momo Belia Deviluke, and Kazari Uiharu respectively.\n\nDaisuke Ono and Rina Sato to an extent. Sven and Mudie Hosaka and Haruka Minami, Roze and Liliane, Battler and Ange, and to a really lesser extent Ku Nel SandersAlberio Imma, and Negi himself.\n\nJun Fukuyama and Sayaka Ohara. Most of the time, Fukuyama is Ohara's underling/assistant, but this is sometimes reversed.\n\nGundam SEED Stargazer: Selene MacGriff (Ohara) with her assistant Sol Ryuune Lange (Fukuyama)\n\n×××HOLiC: Yuko Ichihara (Ohara) with her bitch Watanuki (Fukuyama)\n\nCode Geass: Subverted, somewhat. Milly Ashford (Ohara) with her... classmate in-class Lelouch (Fukuyama). However, in the bigger picture... she amounts to nearly nothing on Lelouch's grander scheme.\n\nValkyria Chronicles: Inverted. Selvaria Bles (Ohara) with her boss Maxmillian (Fukuyama).\n\nAudio Adaptation of Suikoden I: Leknaat (Ohara) with her underling Luc (Fukuyama).\n\nFrom Umineko no Naku Koro ni to Toradora!: Rie Kugimiya (Shannon to Taiga), Eri Kitamura (Siesta 410 to Ami), Yui Horie (Maria to Minori), Sayaka Ohara (Beatrice to Yasuko).\n\nRomi Paku and Masakazu Morita usually play allies with each other. There's Zidane and Tidus in Dissidia Final Fantasy, Toshiro Hitsugaya and Ichigo Kurosaki, and Uesugi Kenshin and Maeda Keiji.\n\nTetsuya Kakihara and Marina Inoue have a relationship as well. Although that are only two, we've got Simon and Yoko, Shing Meteoryte and Kohak Hearts, Strada (the weapon) and Erio Mondial, and Fujioka and Kana Minami.\n\nAlso Tetsuya Kakihara and Aya Hirano shares a relation as well. We've got Natsu and Lucy, and Tenma and Sasha.\n\nAlso he has a relationship with Yui Horie Natsu and Charle, Shima and Yuki-onna and, Prince Gaul and Millihore.\n\nChikao Ohtsuka and Akio Ohtsuka are probably the best father-son seiyuu team in all of anime history. From Big Boss and Solid Snake, Berthold Gregor and Radi Jaeger, Master Xehanort and Terranort, Both being Goemon at one point, Admiral Eiphar Synapse and Anavel Gato, Geiger and Captain Nemo, Gold Roger and Blackbeard, and Ryuken and Souther (the movie one).\n\nAyumi Fujimura and Nobuhiko Okamoto play characters with tsuntsun romantic(?) relationships as Cecily and Luke in The Sacred Blacksmith and as Misaki and Usui in Kaichou wa Maid-sama! respectively.\n\nFor whatever the reason, Takumi started hitting on Misaki's friend Shizuko. So Misaki's co-worker Erikakills him.\n\nAyumi Fujimura and Nobuhiko Okamoto have a non-existent relationship in Hatsukoi Limited even if they're both there, with the former being the artistic and shy Chikura Nao and the latter the boyfriend of Dobashi Rika. Interestingly, Mariya Ise also shows up there as Arihara Ayumi.\n\nThey also have a non-existent relationship in A Certain Magical Index II, with Ayumi Fujimura voicing Seiri Fukiyose and Nobuhiko Okamoto voicing Accelerator.\n\nThe two also are both in Bakuman｡ as Nizuma and Iwase, Chrome Shelled Regios as Layfon and Cautina, Beezlebub as Hisaya and Kaiser, Nabari no Ou as Gau and Raimei, The Sacred Blacksmith as Luke and Cecily, Blue Exorcist as Rin and the child version of Yukio, and Hatsukoi Limited as Haruto and Nao.\n\nSometimes Atsushi Abe is also there as Touma, Hinata, and Mashiro.\n\nActually, Atsushi Abe and Nobuhiko Okamoto have more relations in Shugo Chara (Kukai and Musashi), and Guin Saga (Maruis and Oro).\n\nTomokazu Sugita and Mikako Takahashi. We've got Kusuha and Bullet, Gintoki and Sadaharu/Tsu Terakado, and the two voices of Chrono.\n\nGets funner when Tomokazu uses this as an excuse to invite Mikako to guest star the Bururaji radio, with Heart Aino used as Mikako's avatar. And mind you, during a previous April Fools joke, there was a shot for crossover between Arcana Heart and BlazBlue, with Heart (Mikako) being paired with Ragna (Tomokazu).\n\nRie Kugimiya and Shizuka Ito surprisingly are in the same series most of the time. Shana and Wilhelmina, Nagi and Hinagiku, Yuuki and Hisa, Flora and Sela, and Touko and Rei.\n\nMamiko Noto and Teh Rie again. Hecate and Shana, Tiffania and Louise, Rin and Mimi, Nodoka and Tsukuyomi, Shimako and Touko, one-shot character Pandemonium and Kagura, Cassie and Satelizzer.\n\nTomokazu Sugita and Yuuichi Nakamura. We've got Ragna and Hazama (protagonist-antagonist, Leon and Alto antagonist-protagonist, and upcoming EXCEED game Hamelen Sibato and W03 (both allies).\n\nChrono and Vice respectively in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS.\n\nThe SRW relations between Sugita and Nakamura expands now, with Brooklyn 'Bullet' Luckfield (Sugita) and Joshua Radcliff (Nakamura). Though thus far, they're not so related aside of being in the same side (eventually).\n\nNorio Wakamoto and Takehito Koyasu most of the time appear in the same series, related or no. We have: Aya Fujimura and Reiji Takatori, Luck Gandor and Gustave St. Germain, Sasuke and Oda Nobunaga, Vincent and Isshin Arima, Zed and Zeikfried (only in the remake) and Tekkaman Evil and Tekkaman Omega. Most of the time, Wakamoto would be the villain and Koyasu the one on the better scale of moral, but this is reversed in Guilty Gear when Koyasu plays Eddie, and Wakamoto plays Johnny.\n\nAsami Sanada and Miyuki Sawashiro are in everything together: Jun and Shinku, Dejiko and Puchiko, Matoi and Maria, Kanako and the Dorm Leader, and Tamaki and Shinkuro, just to name a few.\n\nShozo Iizuka and Takeshi Watabe often play rivals in series such as Kikaider and Taiyou Sentai Sun Vulcan.\n\nBridging together Minami-ke and Umineko no Naku Koro ni:\n\nRina Satou - Haruka and Ange\n\nMinori Chihara - Chiaki and Sakutarou\n\nMarina Inoue - Kana and Jessica\n\nDaisuke Ono - Hosaka and Battler\n\nEri Kitamura - Uchida and Siesta 410\n\nAki Toyosaki - Yoshino and Asmodeus of Lust\n\nTomokazu Sugita and Keiji Fujiwara. We've got Gintoki and Zenzou Hattori, Graham Spector and Ladd Russo, Hoshi and The Mayor, and in probably the first one to transpose to a live action film directed by Daisuke Namikawa a monk and a customer at a bar. Trailer for the movie is right here. Speaking of which, Mamoru Miyano will be the protagonist of the movie, thereby also having a another one with Fujikei.\n\nProbably a deliberate attempt to do this but link up Index & Railgun to Mayoi Neko Overrun and you'll get the following:\n\nNobuhiko Okamoto: Accelerator to Takumi\n\nKanae Ito: Saten to Fumino\n\nJunji Majima: Teacher Daigo to Daigoro\n\nBonus points for above seiyuu because they're both Nikaidou and Amu in Shugo Chara.\n\nAyana Taketatsu: Some extra in Railgun to Nozomi (yes, even the extras get a mention in this)\n\nThe extra she played was the little girl who lost the backpack that her parents had given her.\n\nSatomi Arai: Kuroko to Suzumi\n\nRina Sato: Mikoto to Sato\n\nYuka Iguchi: Index to Umenomori. Double for above in that they're also Chizuru and Kaede in Nyan Koi\n\nSatomi Sato: Edasaki Banri to Otome\n\nAnd that's just only a few of them!\n\nKazuya Nakai and Masakazu Morita. We've got Wakka and Tidus, Date Masamune and Maeda Keiji, and Roronoa Zoro and Marco (though they'll never meet on screen. For now.)\n\nDaisuke Ono and Sayaka Ohara often plays the role of a bickering couple with Sven and Selene as well as Battler and Beatrice where their bickering tends to drag into the lethal side\n\nSeiyuu common to both Fate/stay night and Nodame Cantabile respectively:\n\nTomokazu Seki - Chiaki and Gilgamesh\n\nAyako Kawasumi - Nodame and Saber\n\nJunichi Suwabe - Tooru and Archer\n\nHiroshi Kamiya - Tomohito and Shinji\n\nBetween Clannad and Bamboo Blade, which aired the season immediately after the first season of the former:\n\nRyou Hirohashi - Kyou and Tamaki\n\nMai Nakahara - Nagisa and Reimi\n\nHouko Kuwashima - Tomoyo and Miyako\n\nDaisuke Sakaguchi - Sunohara and Yuuji\n\nBetween Clannad and Taishō Baseball Girls:\n\nRyou Hirohashi - Kyou and Tamaki\n\nMai Nakahara - Nagisa and Akiko\n\nMamiko Noto - Kotomi and Yuki\n\nJunichi Suwabe and Miyuki Sawashiro. Bastard of a father Relius and his son Carl, normal teenager Takashi and Heroic Sociopath Badass Saeko, Milan Forward and Carne Kywell, assistant siblings of one creepy Velvet Room owner; Theodore and Elizabeth\n\nA subtler one: Vega/Balrog/Claw and Cammy White. The catch is that Vega has a rather soft spot with Cammy and his Pet the Dog in Alpha 3 involves him saving her, but they wouldn't be voiced by Junichi Suwabe and Miyuki Sawashiro until the fourth game, whereas they don't seem so related anymore...\n\nEven though they never interact they're Fried and Virgo/Ur/Urtear\n\nSpanning both Da Capo and Otome wa Boku ni Koishiteru, we have Yui Horie (Kotori, Mizuho), Sakura Nogawa (Nemu, Michiko), Miyu Matsuki (Yoriko/Misaki, Shion) and Akemi Kanda (Miharu, Kana).\n\nKazuya Nakai and Marina Inoue played semi-official couples in Persona 3 and No More Heroes.\n\nThey also played together as allies in Valkyria Chronicles as Zaka and Alicia.\n\nKouki Uchiyama and Megumi Toyoguchi have played some sibling-like roles these days. We've got Ventus (Ven) and Aqua, the Orimura siblings Ichika and Chifuyu, and Banagher Links and Mihiro Oiwakken.\n\nKana Asumi has two roles with Jun Fukuyama, both of which is Kana Asumi's character older than Jun Fukuyama's though it's by virtue of Older Than They Look. They are Popura Taneshima and Souta Takanashi, and Shizuka Sado and Taro Sado. They're also Yukari Sarashi and Hayato Mikogami, but they're almost unrelated to each other.\n\nNobuhiko Okamoto and Rina Sato surprisingly. From Yoichi and Ibuki to Accelerator and Mikoto Misaka to Takumi and Sato, and Ikki and Rika in the OVA.\n\nA triang relationship can be seen within Katsuyuki Konishi, Tomokazu Sugita and Tetsuya Kakihara. There are three series in which involves only two of them (one will be missing) and these characters will be deeply connected.\n\nTengen Toppa Gurren Lagann: Katsuyuki Konishi and Tetsuya Kakihara as Kamina and Simon\n\nBlazBlue: Tomokazu Sugita and Tetsuya Kakihara as Ragna and Jin\n\nFist of the North Star: Ken's Rage: Katsuyuki Konishei and Tomokazu Sugita as Kenshiro and Shin\n\nAnother triangular relationship can also be seen with Rina Sato, Marina Inoue and Kana Asumi. Unlike the above triangle however, all three have been in the same show together: Gurren Lagann, and Mahou Sensei Negima (OVAs).\n\nRina Sato and Marina Inoue: Minami-ke, Metal Fight Beyblade, Maria Watches Over Us, and Umineko no Naku Koro ni.\n\nMarina Inoue and Kana Asumi: Kämpfer, Agarest Senki 2, and Sekirei.\n\nRina Sato and Kana Asumi: MM!, Amagami SS, Hyperdimension Neptunia, Lotte no Omocha, A Certain Magical Index.\n\nMaaya Sakamoto and Joji Nakata have had two instances of being enemies in a fight to the death, though one's a Blood Knight protagonist, and the other's a one-episode antagonist. In the fifth Garden of Sinners movie, Sakamoto played Blood Knight protagonist Ryougi Shiki, and Nakata played one-shot villian Souren Araya. In the fourth episode of Hellsing Ultimate, the roles were reversed, with Nakata playing Blood Knight main character Alucard, and Sakamoto playing one-shot villian Rip Van Winkle.\n\nAsami Imai and Chiaki Takahashi has been in several series together ever since their time together in the original The Idolmaster (Chihaya and Azusa), which includes being in Koihime Musou (Kakuka/Jia Xu and Choukun/Zhang Xun), BlazBlue (Tsubaki and Litchi) and Neptunia (Noire and Magiquone).\n\nAlso though not really direct, Chiaki appeared in Chaos;Head. When the Spiritual Successor Steins;Gate appeared, she's not there, but Asami appears there (being Kurisu Makise)\n\nIn general, Idolmaster seiyuus usually form strong bond together. Eriko Nakamura has been a great friend with Asami Imai, also appearing (along with Imagine and Chiaking) in Koihime Musou as Enjutsu/Yuan Shu, along with her roles as Ui in Hoshizora e Kakaru Hashi (with Chiaking as Tsumugi), and as Chisato in Koi to Senkyo to Chocolate (with Imagine as Michiru). On the other hand, Chiaking also once worked together with Mayako Nigo (Yayoi) in Omamori Himari, and the former had a minor role in Zoids Genesis, which stars Hiromi Hirata (Makoto). Likewise, Hiromi Hirata and Mayako Nigo can be spotted together in Arcana Heart (as Kamui Tokinomiya and Lilica Felchenrow respectively)... together with Juri Takita (Kotori, in Arcana Heart as both Mei-Fang and Mei-Ling)... who was in the Japanese version of Fire Emblem Path of Radiance and Radiant Dawn as Princess Elincia, along with Akiko Hasegawa (Miki) as Mia/Wayu.\n\nAyako Kawasumi and Atsuko Tanaka. We've got Leina and Claudette, Saber and Caster, Megumi and Sayoko, and Laura Stewart and Harumi Kiyama though the last one, they're very unrelated.\n\nRomi Paku and Akira Ishida share a surprising history together. In Naruto they respectively play the troubled siblings Temari and Gaara. Then in Dissidia Final Fantasy, they once again play troubled siblings in the form of Zidane and Kuja. (Romi still gets to play the blond sibling!) They have also shown up as rivals in Bleach: The Diamond Dust Rebellion and as bandmates in Nana.\n\nAyako Kawasumi has a ton as well with Mamiko Noto. They have played Leina and Tomoe, Harumi and Yukiko, Henrietta and Tiffania, Ruriko and Shun's younger self, Saber and Sir Bedivere, Laura and Aisa, Kazumi and Hecate, Kaede and Asuka, Aoi and Chizuru, Chikane and Reiko, Miharu and Yukinari, Tazusa and Ria, Rio and Sanri, Matsuri and Ana, Noda and Sakura, Tomoko and Mitsuki, Sumire and Minamo, Eufinely and Mailreit, Chizuru and Kouta, Saki and Oshizu, Yuuko and Shimako, Fumiko and Miura, Hatsue and Nayu, and Gedoumaru-de gozansu and One-Scene Wonder Pandemonium.\n\nRie Kugimiya and Yui Horie shares a lot of roles together, Rose and Maruga, Happy and Charle and others.\n\nKana Ueda and Shizuka Itou have played alongside each other multiple times, often with Itou's character being Ueda's superior such as Kohaku and Akiha, Yumi and Rei, and Saki and Hisa. Lyrical Nanoha flips this around with Ueda's character, Hayate being of higher rank than Shario, who is voiced by Itou, and Fate Unlimited Codes has Ueda and Itou voicing rivals Rin Tohsaka and Luviagelitta Edelfelt respectively.\n\nMichiko Neya and Takehito Koyasu usually are together in the same series, even in one Hentai anime (Fencer of the Minerva for those who are curious). They are Natalia and Jade, Arachne and Excalibur, and Mako Sato and Ryousuke Takahashi to name a few.\n\nSayaka Ohara and Rie Kugimiya are often in the same anime usually closely related. For example Erza and Happy, Masaki and Karin, Mirena and Cassie and Haruka and Flora Skybloom.\n\nAs part of the Casting Gag, Yuuichi Nakamura and Houko Kuwashima has started, with them being potential lovers in Clannad (Tomoya Okazaki and Tomoyo Sakagami) or brother-sister in the 2nd Super Robot Wars Original Generations (Joshua Radcliff and Cliana Rimskaya)\n\nAmi Koshimizu and Kana Ueda have been in a few series together like Dyshana and Ellis to Nodoka and Saki, Ingrid Bernstein and Atia Simones, and Limwris and Rathty to name a few.\n\nKana Hanazawa seems to get paired with newcomer Yui Ogura in at least three roles. From Sakuya and Hermit to Kuroneko and her sister and an upcoming anime named Ro-Kyu-Bu!.\n\nHiroyuki Yoshino seems to get paired off with Akeno Watanabe. We have Saruyama and Rito, Bossun and his mom, and Kawaguchi and May-Yen/Tomigai to name a few.\n\nKana Hanazawa and Yoko Hikasa are paired very often as of late Charlotte and Houki, Yuki and Minami, Noir and Brische, and Tomoka and Saki.\n\nHiroshi Kamiya and Daisuke Ono. Good GOD. They're best known for their roles in Durarara!! (as Izaya and Shizuo), but they have also been together in Uragiri wa Boku no Namae wo Shitteiru (Hotsuma and Kuroto), Working!! (Souma and Satou), and Monochrome Factor (Nikaido and Usui). They also host a radio drama called Dear Girl stories, which also got its own visual novel. If they aren't the seiyuu Dream Team, then this troper doesn't know who is.\n\nAkira Ishida and Mamiko Noto have appeared in a lot of shows. We've got Mnemosyne (Apos and Rin), Persona3 (Main protagonist/Pharos/Ryoji Mochizuki and Fuuka Yamagishi), Keroro Gunsou (Saburo and Angol Mois), Negima (Fate Averrncus and Nodoka Miyazaki), Queen's Blade (Delmore and Tomoe), and Mawaru Penguindrum (Keiju Tabuki and Yuri Tokikago).\n\nKenichi Suzumura and Maaya Sakamoto have been Zack and Aeris, Mikiya and Shiki, Shinn and Lunamaria, and Hikaru and Haruhi to name a few and they're married in real life now (as of August 8, 2011).\n\nNot as noticeable as the rest of the ones listed in here, but Miyuki Sawashiro sometimes gets paired up with Rina Satou either as rivals, as companions, or unrelated to each other. We've got Nikki and Melhis, Sakuya Izayoi and Reimu Hakurei of Touhou fame, Nekane Springfield and Negi Springfield, Milla Maxwell and Presa, Chie and Nagi, Yui Shishido and Naomi Nakashima and Milepoch and Yuuri\n\nWhen you see Aki Toyosaki in the list of seiyuu in an anime series, their is a possibility that Yoko Hikasa was also in that show. Their roles were usually being friends or close friends. Some example of that is Yui Hirasawa and Mio Akiyama of K-On!, Tomo Yamanobe and Hana Katsuragi of Seikon no Qwaser, Keina Soga and Junko Hittori in Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Maou and many more.\n\nDaisuke Ono and Miyuki Sawashiro have twice been Platonic Life Partners: as Shizuo and Celty in Durarara!! and as Huey and Dalian in Bibliotheca Mystica de Dantalian. Interesting to note is that Sawashiro's characters in both shows are Tsunderes of varying degrees while Ono's characters in the shows are usually at opposite ends of the emotional spectrum.\n\nMai Aizawa and Hiromi Konno seem to have a good one going on, what with being Kyoto Animation favorites and all: Munto (Yumemi and Suzume), Lucky Star (Ayano and Akira), Kiddy Girl-AND (Alisa and Letuchie), Mirai Nikki (Minene and Kamado), and Nichijou (Mio and the Professor).\n\nEri Kitamura and Kana Hanazawa have a huge one: Last Exile (Tatiana and Holly), Potemayo (Sunao and Potemayo), Blassreiter (Rene and Elea), Kyouran Kazoku Nikki (Akeru and Yuuka), Bakemonogatari (Karen and Nadeko), Angel Beats! (Yui and Kanade), Durarara!! (Mairu and Anri), Kuragehime (Sara and Tsukimi), Freezing (Ganessa and Lana), Blue Exorcist (Izumo and Shiemi), Mayo Chiki (Kanade and Kureha), and Rewrite (Akane and Kagari).\n\nMiyuki Sawashiro and Yuuichi Nakamura also have a few roles where they were together. Examples include Celty and Kadota, Carl and Terumi, Yoru and Ikuto Tsukuyomi, Ur/Ultear and Gray, Cammy and Fei Long, and Maria and Last Samurai just to name a few.\n\nRina Hidaka and Nobuhiko Okamoto seem to have this going on: Last Order and Accelerator, Bueka and Lear Rinkal, Mina Azuki and Eiji Nizuma, Minato Kisaragi and Yumeji Fujiwawa, and Kaede Kaburagi and Ivan Karelin.\n\nYūko Gotō and Tomokazu Sugita have a good relation going on too in Shuffle! (Kaede and Rin), The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya (Mikuru and Kyon), Dragonaut (Makina and Howlingstar), Lucky Star (Gothouther-sama and Clerk Sugita), Sayonara, Zetsubou-sensei (Abiru and Ikkyu-san), Gintama (Kirara and Gintoki), Arakawa Under the Bridge (Hoshi and Jacqueline), Maji de Watashi ni Koi Shinasai! (Yukie and June), and in Sket Dance (Switch and Luigiana).\n\nYuuichi Nakamura and Yuuki Kaji have been appearing in a few roles to date. We have Cid and Hope, Gai and Shu, Mikage and Amata, and Gray and Lyon to name a few.\n\nWhat they have in common Naruto and 24? The Japanese dub of the latter series is practically a reunion of half of Naruto's voice cast:\n\nRikiya Koyama: Yamato/Jack Bauer\n\nMie Sonozaki: Yugito Nii/Kimberly Bauer\n\nYoichi Masukawa: Rock Lee/Josh Bauer\n\nNobutoshi Canna: Kabuto Yakushi/Chase Edmunds\n\nAtsuko Tanaka: Konan/Audrey Raines\n\nSatoshi Hino: Sai/Derek Huxley\n\nNoriaki Sugiyama: Sasuke Uchiha/Rick Allen\n\nChie Nakamura: Sakura Haruno/Jane Sanders\n\nHochu Otsuka: Jiraiya/Stephen Sanders\n\nAnd many others...\n\nNewcomers Kaori Ishihara and Yui Ogura have been almost together throughout their entire careers. Some examples include: Ram and Rom, some extras, and also part of the hosts of the DxD radio, Welsh and Charles Cocotte, Ryuka Shimizudani and Toki Onjoji.\n\nThere are lot of overlapping voice actors between Guilty Crown and Aquarion Evol:\n\nYuuki Kaji as Shuu and Amata\n\nAi Kayano as Inori and Minoko\n\nKana Hanazawa as Ayase and Zessica\n\nYuuichi Nakamura as Gai and Mykage\n\nKouki Uchiyama as Daryl and Kagura\n\nNana Mizuki and Aya Hisakawa seems to have this 'related junior-senior' relationship going on. Hisakawa would often play a senior/predecessor to Mizuki's character, such as Lindy (adoptive mother) and Fate Testarossa Harlown (adoptive daughter), Yuri Tsukikage/Cure Moonlight (predecessor) and Tsubomi Hanasaki/Cure Blossom (current). Also, in the first PS1 Star Ocean the Second Story, Hisakawa is the voice of Rena Lanford. And when it's re-released in PSP, Mizuki succeeds her as Rena.\n\nEnglish-language Examples\n\nCam Clarke and Quinton Flynn are best friends in real life, and have done numerous roles together in anime and games, most famously in the Metal Gear series.\n\nSome fans will cry out this trope whenever characters voiced by Steve Blum and Wendee Lee (perhaps most well-known for the voices of Spike Spiegel and Faye Valentine in Cowboy Bebop) end up in a romantic situation, even if one is a minor character that shows up for a few minutes in a single episode. Examples include the aforementioned relationship, as well as Samurai Champloo (where one of the pair really was in just a few minutes of a single episode), The Big O, Great Teacher Onizuka (though Lee voices half of the female cast and Blum has the lead role so it was inevitable), and even a Western animated example, Megas XLR.\n\nBlum and Lee both ended up in Neverwinter Nights as Daelin Red Tiger and Aribeth. However, both the characters never interact with each others.\n\nZutara fans love to note that Avatar: The Last Airbender characters Zuko and Katara are voiced by Dante Basco and Mae Whitman respectively, who also voiced the couple Jake and Rose on American Dragon: Jake Long. Furthermore, in both series' Grand Finales, Dante's character asks Mae's character to help him fight The Dragon.\n\nSomeone brought it up on Capslock Zutara and was told pretty much, \"That's old news, move on.\"\n\nMichelle Ruff usually voices a cocky strong willed girl with Liam O'Brien as a character obsessing over her. First, in Gankutsuou, Ruff voiced Eugenie who spoke her mind without question, and O'Brien played Andrea, a guy who wants to marry her presumably just so he could get his hands on at least a part of her family fortune, and keeps following her around and flirting with her. Then in Odin Sphere, Ruff played Badass Princess Velvet who goes around killing bad guys with her chain weapon, while O'Brien played her overly protective twin brother Ingway.\n\nThen in Tales of Vesperia, Ruff played headstrong Cute Genius Bruiser Rita, one of the heroes of the game, and O'Brien played Cumore, one of the minor villians. Cumore didn't have the hots for Rita in any way, but they still were enemies.\n\nAs Fan Service to older Digimon fans, Mary Elizabeth McGlynn and Melissa Fahn were cast as mother and daughter Sarah and Kristy Damon in Digimon Savers, after they played mother and daughter Rumiko and Rika Nonaka in Digimon Tamers. Savers' dub was generally considered superior to the other four.\n\nIn Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, McGlynn did Motoko Kusanagi, while Fahn did the Tachikomas.\n\nCaitlin Glass and Vic Mignogna. First, they showed up as Gadgeteer Genius Winry Rockbell and metal-bending hero Edward Elric in Fullmetal Alchemist, and a few years later were voicing Tamaki and Haruhi in Ouran High School Host Club. And yeah, there was much Squeeing.\n\nYuri Lowenthal and Tara Platt turn up in a lot of works together: in Steambot Chronicles as Dandelion and Ciboulette, in Persona 3 as the protagonist and Mitsuru, in Saints Row: The Third as Matt and the boss (Female 2), and in Naruto as Sasuke and Temari. Considering both voice actors are married, this isn't too surprising.\n\nMonica Rial has played Luci Christian's character's friend in numerous shows. Furthermore, the pair of Kaname and Kyouko is pretty similar to that of Himeno and Yayoi. There's also Asuna and Konoka.\n\nCan't forget Nyamo and Yukari.\n\nOr Ayu and Mayu.\n\nIf a mother-daughter friendship counts, Haruko and Misuzu.\n\nThis may be more of a coincidence than any other examples here, but John Burgmeier and Chuck Huber made their start as playing two unlikely friends of different temperament on Yu Yu Hakusho, and while they really haven't been playing any definitively major roles together since then, they still continue to end up playing two very different characters that end up unlikely friends (or at the very least, acquaintances) on several works they've been in.\n\nKurama and Hiei of the aforementioned Yu Yu Hakusho.\n\nElmer Albatross and Ronnie Sukiart in Baccano!\n\nSwitzerland and Austria.\n\nLuci Christian arguably has one with Chris Patton too, as potential Love Interest characters; they've played both Duck/Ahiru and Fakir respectively from Princess Tutu, and Kaname and Sosuke from Full Metal Panic!.\n\nAnd let's not forget Mako and Ichiro from Nerima Daikon Brothers...\n\nAlso Manabu and Louise from The Galaxy Railways and now Akuto and Junko from Demon King Daimao.\n\nAnd Sato and Hitomi from Welcome to The NHK.\n\nMax and Milia in the Re-Dub of Super Dimension Fortress Macross.\n\nChris Patton came back to voice acting for the character Keima Katsuragi for The World God Only Knows... and Luci Christian plays the other main character, Elsie.\n\nSpeaking of Chris Patton, he's also paired twice with Brittney Karbowski—first as Yuichi and Ayu, and then as Kyousuke and Kei.\n\nKirby Morrow and Kelly Sheridan have played their characters' respective love interests plenty of times (both Major and Minor) that sometimes people ask if they are an item.\n\nWhile the voicework for the English dub of Inuyasha was done in separate booths, Kirby joked on how he was \"a perfect gentleman\" with Kelly Sheridan when he was voicing Miroku.\n\nHappens in American shows too, such as the movie Barbie in the Nutcracker where Kirby Morrow is the Prince/Nutcracker, and Kelly Sheridan is Clara/The Sugar Plum Princess.\n\nThere's also Theresa and Jay on Class of the Titans.\n\nMichael McConnohie has twice played a father figure to Michelle Ruff's character; once in Castlevania Order of Ecclesia as Barlowe, and again as Charles vi Britannia in Code Geass.\n\nJeff Bennett and Kath Soucie have played the Father and Mother of the main character before, such as in Dexter's Laboratory and Kiki's Delivery Service.\n\nAmanda Winn-Lee and Jaxon Lee work together a lot, and are also married in real life.\n\nBest pals Tara Strong and Grey DeLisle are often heard in different shows together. Notable examples are Timmy and Vicky and Omi and Kimiko. And who can't forget Cartoon Network's Mandy and Raven promos?\n\nIt's referenced in Avatar: The Last Airbender where Actress Azula is played by Tara while the real Azula was played by Grey.\n\nCree Summer isn't usually far behind, either.\n\nIn addition, Cree and Will Friedle have been paired more than once, first with Batman Beyond, then later as the Official Couple from Tony Hawk's Underground and recently Leo (ancestor of Lion-o, also played by Friedle) and Panthera in ThunderCats (2011).\n\nCree and Grey also voiced Selendis and Nova as well as Valerie and Sam.\n\nNot to mention Emily Elizabeth and Cleo.\n\nE.G. Daily and Kath Soucie shared similar lead roles between two different shows: in Rugrats, Daily was Tommy while Soucie was Phil and Lil, and One Hundred and One Dalmatians, Daily was Lucky while Soucie was Rolly and Cadpig.\n\nColleen Clinkenbeard and Travis Willingham. Some examples include:\n\nRiza and Roy\n\nAyako and Bou-San\n\nLuffy and Ace\n\nNotable because neither has a particularly large body of work: Cristina Valenzuela and Jennifer Alyx. They provide the dub voices for Nanoha and Fate in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha, Louise and Tabitha in The Familiar of Zero, and Aika and Midori in AIKa R-16.\n\nCristina Valenzuela seem to be some sort of \"leader\" in various relationships with other new-age female voices. Asides from Jennifer Alyx, she's been together with:\n\nCassandra Lee in Puella Magi Madoka Magica (Homura and Kyubey), K-On! (Mio and Ritsu), The Familiar of Zero (Louise and Henrietta), and Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 (Compa and Gust).\n\nLauren Landa in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha (Nanoha and Arf & young Chrono), Puella Magi Madoka Magica (Homura and Kyouko), BlazBlue (Noel and Litchi), The Familiar of Zero (Louise and Kirche), and Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 (Compa and CAVE).\n\nChristine Marie Cabanos in Puella Magi Madoka Magica (Homura and Madoka), Squid Girl (Nagisa and the titular character), K-On! (Mio and Azusa), Skullgirls (Cerebella and Filia), and Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2 (Compa and Nepgear).\n\nAnd although this is pretty new, Puella Magi Madoka Magica isn't the first time Valenzuela worked with Carrie Keranen (Mami). They've worked together in the dub of Tekken: Blood Vengeance (Valenzuela as Alisa, Keranen as Xiaoyu).\n\nAnd not even the most newbie of the actresses of Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Sarah Williams (Sayaka), isn't unrelated to Valenzuela, having also worked in Skullgirls (Cerebella and Peacock).\n\nIn conclusion, every voice cast there is related to Cristina Valenzuela. And including Jennifer Alyx, all of them are usually not seen in any work unless Cristina Valenzuela is involved (except for Carrie Keranen and Cassandra Lee).\n\nMichael McKean and David Lander, who played Lenny and Squiggy on Laverne and Shirley, played Horace and Jasper in the One Hundred and One Dalmatians TV Series, and Arthur and Cecil, the two vultures in The Jungle Cubs.\n\nDave Wittenberg and Yuri Lowenthal. We've got Kakashi and Sasuke, Teddie and Yosuke, Gino and Suzaku, and Cielo and Serph just to name a few.\n\nYuri Lowenthal and Liam O'Brien have some roles that they are together as well. Sasuke and Gaara, Main Character and Akihiko, Luke and Dist, Suzaku and Lloyd, Haseo and Endrance, Gig and Levin, Cecil and Kain, and Luka and Father Balder just to name a few out there.\n\nIt seems that Mark Hamill and Kevin Conroy are always cast as villainous and heroic supporting characters,respectively, in Batman shows after Batman the Animated Series like The Batman and Batman the Brave And The Bold.\n\nTroy Baker and Laura Bailey. Nagi and Evangeline in the first anime series, Kanji Tatsumi and Rise Kujikawa, and Snow Villiers and Serah Farron just to name a few.\n\nNow Vincent and Catherine in Catherine.\n\nDon't forget Gennosuke Kouga and Iga-no-Oboro.\n\nAs of recently, the re-dub voices of James Sunderland and Angela Orosco in Silent Hill 2 HD.\n\nBryce Papenbrook and Cassandra Lee. We have Kida and Saki, Valya and Nadya and Asbel and Sophie.\n\nGreg Cipes and Ashley Johnson as two people in love: Beast Boy and Terra From Teen Titans, and Chiro and Jinmay from Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go!!, and Gwen and Kevin on Ben 10 Alien Force—okay, they're not romantically linked yet, but they're hinting at it. Heavily.\n\nIt's amazing that Caleb's blond-haired, blue-eyed, earth moving girlfriend Cornelia in WITCH was not played by Ashley Johnson.\n\nSimilarly, in Recess, Geoffrey (who was not played by Greg Cipes) who falls in love with Gretchen (voiced by Ashley Johnson) in episode The Pest.\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch is a veritable relationship magnet for other voice actors.\n\nCrispin Freeman and Johnny Yong Bosch have their fair share of relationship voice acting. Kyon and Itsuki, Jeremiah and Lelouch, Tsume and Kiba, Holland and Renton, and Shizuo and Izaya.\n\nTwice now, Johnny Yong Bosch has played the more cerebral, black-haired friend of an excitable mecha pilot played by Yuri Lowenthal (Lelouch to Suzaku, Rossiu to Simon). Time will only tell if this trend continues.\n\nThree and a half if you count Persona 4; Bosch plays the calm, silent protagonist alongside Lowenthal's Xander-esque Yosuke.\n\nJust in general, Bosch plays the calm thinker to Lowenthal's brash protagonist: Bosch is Guy to Lowenthal's Luke in Tales of the Abyss, and Bosch is Kuhn to Lowenthal's Haseo in the .hack//G.U. games.\n\nAlso, in Bleach Bosch plays stoic hero Ichigo Kurosaki, while Lowenthal is his bumbling buddy Keigo Asano.\n\nTo mix things up a bit, Bosch plays the optimistic, Hot-Blooded Firion while Lowenthal plays the knightly Cecil in Dissidia Final Fantasy. Also, in Ace Combat Zero, Bosch plays Wide-Eyed Idealist P.J. Beckett, while Lowenthal plays the more worldly and cynical Larry \"Pixy\" Foulke (cue Hilarious in Hindsight jokes).\n\nAs a contrast, more often than not, if there is one person who will/can kill Bosch (Lelouch, PJ, Firion played by CPU or friend, random ninjas), it is Lowenthal (respectively Suzaku, Pixy, Cecil if played by you, Sasuke). Doesn't work when the reverse is attempted (TTGL, Code Geass, Naruto). This means only Keigo can kill Ichigo in spite of his Plot Armour, but Ichigo for all his Heroic Resolve cannot kill Keigo. Huh.\n\nTo add to this, in TTGL and Code Geass, The Scrappy (played by Bosch and Lowenthal in those respective animes) usually ends up taking over the work the main character (Lowenthal and Bosch in those respective animes) has left behind - Rossiu took over when Simon left in Gurren Lagann and Suzaku stepped up to the plate after Lelouch died in Code Geass.\n\nFour times, Bosch and Stephanie Sheh have been in a relationship where Stephanie's character has loved Johnny's (and usually the feelings are mutual): in Bleach (Ichigo/Orihime) Gurren Lagann (Rossiu/Kinon), Eureka7 (Renton/Eureka), and Code Geass (Lelouch/Kaguya).\n\nAnd if you count video games, Devil May Cry 4 (Nero/Kyrie) and Disgaea 3 (Almaz/Sapphire).\n\nIf you ship Itsuki x Mikuru or Guy x Natalia, those might count too.\n\nLucky Channel (Daisuke Ono/Akira Kogami).\n\nJohnny has also been paired up with Laura Bailey a few times: Sakura and Sabato, Emil and Marta, and MC/Souji/Yu and Rise. The latter two also happen to be possible love interests.\n\nAlso twice, Bosch has played the good guy to Troy Baker's antagonist (Schneizel and Lelouch; Kariya and Ichigo).\n\n... which also happens in Persona 4, until you recruit Kanji.\n\nReversed if you also count Adachi.\n\nThere's one with Karen Strassman and Johnny Yong Bosch in Code Geass and Gun X Sword. Both are mecha pilots: Check. Strassman's character is Ms. Fanservice: Check. Bosch's character is a morally ambiguous guy who loves his little sister: Check.\n\nTwo more with Johnny and Karen: Hans Grimm and Kei Nagase, MC/Souji Seta/Yu Narukami and Nanako Dojima and Izanami.\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch and Julie Ann Taylor: Bleach (Ichigo and Ririn), Code Geass (Lelouch and Milly), and Stellvia of the Universe (Kouta and Ayaka).\n\nJohnny Yong Bosch and Kate Higgins: Bleach, Eureka Seven and Code Geass.\n\nWith Liam O'Brien: Bleach (Ichigo and Ukitake), Devil May Cry 4 (Nero and Sanctus) and Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (Rossiu and Guinble).\n\nYuri Lowenthal and Steve Blum. In Naruto they play Sasuke and Orochimaru. In Gurren Lagann they play Simon and Leeron. Draw your own conclusions.\n\nThere's also Wolverine and Iceman. So what the hell does that mean?\n\nTHIS is what it means.\n\nSuzaku and Tohdoh.\n\nChris Ayres and Greg Ayres have been in several projects together. Either as allies, (Speed Grapher, Dragonball Z Kai) or as rivals/enemies (Sengoku Basara, Initial D, Gantz). And they are brothers in real life.\n\nWendee Lee and Stephanie Sheh were paired up as Genki Girl Haruhi and Shrinking Violet Mikuru in Suzumiya Haruhi. Now try to imagine Tatsuki harassing Orihime (same traits as their Haruhi dub counterparts) and putting her in a maid and bunny outfit... wait a minute...\n\nOr Weda harassing Guu, or Maya harassing Aya...\n\nDon't forget that the two fighters Itsuki and Yuki are also Ichigo and Rukia.\n\nPlus Lelouch vi Britannia and Euphemia li Britannia.\n\nAlso Wendee Lee, Michelle Ruff, and Kari Wahlgren were in a group of schoolgirl friends at two points. They were Konata, Tsukasa, and Kagami after they were Haruhi, Yuki, and Tsuruya.\n\nThe fourth member of the Lucky Star group may get a hereditary Relationship Voice Actor credit: her mom was Ryoko.\n\nOn that note, Stephanie Sheh and Kari Wahlgren. Eureka and Anemone in Eureka Seven, Mamimi and Haruko in FLCL, and Mikuru and Tsuruya in Haruhi Suzumiya.\n\nMichelle Ruff and Kari Wahlgren also make quite a pair of very Moe women who also happen to be supernatural beings as Anri and Celty.\n\nCrispin Freeman and Kari Wahlgren: Blood+ (Haji/Saya), Witch Hunter Robin (Amon/Robin), and Hellsing Ultimate (Alucard/Rip Van Winkle). So, usually they play brother and sister.\n\nWould Kyon/Tsuruya count?\n\nNo wonder there's speculation about Regal and Raine in the second Tales of Symphonia game.\n\nAnd now that Durarara!! has been licensed, Crispin is Shizuo to Kari's Celty, although they're just Like Brother and Sister.\n\nDon't forget Jeremiah Gottwald and Marianne vi Britannia, Shannon and Pacifica Casull and Thomas Norhstein and his sister Relena.\n\nAlso Crispin Freeman has been the shadow behind Yuri Lowenthal's back twice: Itachi and Sasuke and Karasu and Yuu.\n\nFrom the Noein blooper reel:\n\nAnd now, from the Durarara!! blooper reel:\n\nDon't forget Alucard and Pip!\n\nOr Suzaku and Jeremiah.\n\nTom Kenny and Grey DeLisle: Raimundo and Kimiko, Eduardo and Franky, Iron Man and Ms. Marvel, hell there's an interview somewhere in which Grey says she adores Tom Kenny.\n\nNot sure if this is the one, but in this interview, Grey says that Tom is \"always so funny and entertaining.\" So, this has to come in play somewhere.\n\nIn a gender-swapped episode of Adventure Time, Grey DeLisle plays the female version of Tom Kenny's character, the Ice King.\n\nBrina Palencia and her friend Leah Clark are often paired in anime series, the best example being Negima's Yue and Nodoka.\n\nBrina gets paired up with J Michael Tatum a few times as well. First in Spice and Wolf, and second in Black Butler.\n\nIn the English dub of My-HiME, Mai and Mikoto's voice actresses play characters roughly similar to those they played in the dub of Ichigo Mashimaro. Carol-Anne Day (Mai) was Cool Big Sis-type Nobue Ito, and Caitlynne Medrek (Mikoto) co-starred as hyperactive and very-often mischievous Miu Matsuoka.\n\nBillie Lou Watt, her husband Hal Studer, and Ray and Sonia Owens all usually appeared toghether in some capacity in the anime they've worked on.\n\nPat Fraley and Peter Cullen have both appeared in at least two animated productions together: Filmations Ghostbusters as Jake Kong and Eddie Spencer respectively, and in the Rainbow Brite franchise as Lurky (Fraley also voiced Buddy Blue) and Murky.\n\nYuri Lowenthal and Michelle Ruff have played love interests at least four times: Haru and Elie, Dean and Avril, Yukinari and Miharu, and Suzaku and Euphemia. There's also Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.\n\nLiam O'Brien is usually the suave Anti-Hero to the villain played by Keith Silverstein. You've got Tenma and Johan, Gaara and Kimimaro, and—barring any instances of The Other Darrin -- Ukitake and Starrk.\n\nAlthough Dr. Tenma isn't an anti-hero.\n\nSpeaking of Peter Cullen, he and Frank Welker seem to find themselves working together alot when it comes to anything Transformers related. The original voices of Optimus Prime and Megatron, both reprised their roles for Transformers Prime.\n\nMelissa Davis and Maggie Flecknoe are a worthy mention with Kurumi and Ichijo, Kate and Rachel and Kena and Kotone. Helps that the \"In Class With The Cast\" feature on the Pani Poni Dash! DVD singles, it's seen that they both sort of sound eerily similar to each other.\n\nFor that matter, Melissa Davis and Chris Patton are becoming this, as well, most notably being close friends in Kanon (Mai and Yuichi) and Demon King Daimao (Kena and Akuto), and against each other in Samurai Girls (Gisen and Muneakira) and ICE (Kisaragi and Julia).\n\nKent Williams has repeatedly played the (sometimes duplicitous) right-hand man to John Swasey's boss, e.g. Mao and Huang, Father and Hohenheim, Fuyutsuki and Gendo, and Sid and Lord Death, respectively.\n\nBrad Swaile has some relationships with numerous voices actors.\n\nHe and Kirby Morrow have voiced many roles together, most notably Nightcrawler and Cyclops, Quatre Reberba Winner and Trowa Barton, Koji and Yuki Aiba, Takeshi Tomoe and Ryo Takatsuki, Amuro Ray and Gyunei Gus, Setsuna F. Seiei and Billy Katagiri, Kuro and Hasegawa, and of course Light Yagami and Teru Mikami.\n\nHe's voiced quite a few roles alongside Andrew Francis such as Chris Hawken and Tokio Oshima in Arjuna, Kazuya Aoki and Sojiro Nishikado in Boys Over Flowers, Reiji Ozora and Kyoji Tachibana on Dragon Drive, Kouji Aiba and Airs Blue in Infinite Ryvius, Ryuuki Shi and Seiran Shi in The Story of Saiunkoku, Lan Hikari and Mega Man in Mega Man NT Warrior, Setsuna F. Seiei and Lasse Aeon in Mobile Suit Gundam 00, and Nightcrawler And Iceman in X-Men Evolution.\n\nBrad Swaile and Cathy Weseluck are not so love interests in Ranma ½, enemies in Death Note and Mobile Suit Gundam 00, friends in Mobile Suit Gundam and Dreamkix, and enemies who are a Fan-Preferred Couple in Gundam Wing\n\nBrad Swaile and Shannon Chan Kent have worked together in two franchises: Death Note (Light and Misa) and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 (Setsuna and Christina).\n\nHe also worked with another woman named Ellen Kennedy in two franchises: Transformers Energon (Kicker and Misha) and Maison Ikkoku (Yusaku and Kyoko).\n\nHe collaborated with Alexandra Carter in two franchises: Infinite Ryvius (Koji and Aoi), and Maison Ikkoku (Yusaku and Ibuki). Interestingly the both of them have voiced characters with the last name, Yagami.\n\nHe and Willow Johnson have gotten their starts in voice acting as Ace and Starlight in My Little Pony Tales, and went on to voice Reiji Ozora and Sayaka in Dragon Drive and Amuro Ray and Lalah Sune in Mobile Suit Gundam.\n\nWith Maggie O Hara: Nightcrawler and Shadowcat, Chris Hawken and Arjuna, Kouji Aiba and Cullen Lucciora, Otaru Mamiya and Lime and Yota and Ai.\n\nWith Janyse Jaud: Lan Hikari and Ms. Mari, Yusaku Godai and Akemi Roppongi, Otaru Mamiya and Bloodberry, Keisaku Sato and Margery Daw and Kuro and Kuromitsu.\n\nWith Venus Terzo: Nightcrawler and Jean Grey, Suzuo Sakurazaki and Marylyn Ronmoe, Light Yagami and Wedy/Merry Kenwood, Mousse and Female Ranma, and Otaru Mamiya and Tiger.\n\nHe has worked alongside Kelly Sheridan in Black Lagoon, Boys Over Flowers, The Story of Saiunkoku, Infinite Ryvius, Soul Taker, My Little Pony Tales, X-Men Evolution and many others.\n\nHe also worked with Richard Ian Cox as Mousse and Ranma, Setsuna F. Seiei and Allelujah Haptism and Nightcrawler and Quicksilver.\n\nWith Brian Drummond: Death Note (Light and Ryuk), Black Lagoon (Rock and Benny), Dragon Ball Z Ocean Group dub (Teen Gohan and Vegeta), and Zoids: New Century Zero (Harry Champ and Jack Sisco).\n\nThere's also the time he collaborated twice with Michael Donovan. The times are Mousse and Ryoga in Ranma ½, and Nightcrawler and Juggernaut in X-Men: Evolution.\n\nHe also worked with Bill Switzer as Lan Hikari and Chaud Blaze in Mega Man NT Warrior, Koji Aiba and Ikumi Oze in Infinite Ryvius, Dearka Elsman and Sai Argyle in Gundam Seed, Amuro Ray and Hathaway Noah in Chars Counterattack, Reiji Ozora and Ichiro Sumishiba in Dragon Drive, and Harry Champ and Jamie Hemeros in Zoids New Century Zero.\n\nThough they've played in several shows together, there have been a few times Yuri Lowenthal and Kate Higgins have played characters that interacted with one another. The most notable is, of course, Sasuke and Sakura, then there's Suzaku and CC and Sena and Mamori in the 5 episode dub of Eyeshield 21.\n\nThere's also one of the Monster High shorts were Yuri plays an obnoxious character hitting on Frankie, voice by Kate.\n\nSpeaking of Lowenthal, he's had two roles playing a character hopelessly in love with a character by Kari Wahlgren, who only appears to have no interest on the outside. Those being Scrapped Princess and Durarara!!.\n\nThey were also teammates in Legion of Super-Heroes. Not to mention enemies since Ben 10 Alien Force.\n\nYuri has also had two different relationship roles with Karen Strassman: arch rivals in Code Geass, and romantic couple in Final Fantasy IV.\n\nAlso, Huntik Secrets and Seekers.\n\nIt's becoming a bit common for Mark Hamill and Dante Basco to play villain and hero who oppose one another. Avatar: The Last Airbender, Zevo3 and Generator Rex.\n\nKeith Silverstein plays the villain and Karen Strassman plays the hero like Johan and Nina, and Mabashi and Soi Fon.\n\nSeth Green and Freddie Prinze Jr are in Mass Effect 3, who had previously done |Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed. Seth had also worked with Freddie's wife, Buffy.\n\nRichard Ian Cox and Paul Dobson played archenemy to each other: InuYasha and Naraku and Ranma and Happosai.\n\nSpeaking of Richard, how about him with Kelly Sheridan such as Ranma and Ukyo, Inuyasha and Sango, and Allelujah Haptism and Louise Halevy.\n\nBridget Hoffman and Wendee Lee work together in these roles: Miaka and Yui, Ryoko and Haruhi, Fuu and Umi, and Bellandy and Urd (when the latter isn't Shannon Conley).\n\nJennifer Hale and Raphael Sbarge have a good history, Bastila and Carth and Female Shepard and Kaidan.\n\nWell for Laura Bailey and Travis Willingham since they are married. For instance, they are in Binary Domain where the former plays Faye and the other Dan. And they end up together as love interests.\n\nSames goes with the Persona 3 PSP game with the Female MC (Laura) and Theodore (Travis) as potential love interests.\n\nAlso in Street Fighter IV as Chun-Li and Guile.\n\nTony Oliver and Michelle Ruff:\n\nLupin and Fujiko\n\nShinbo and Chii\n\nJojo and Yayoi\n\nVincent and Saga\n\nRanmaru Shindo and Ryoko Ibuki\n\nHarry McDowell and Maria Asagi\n\nHajiki and Aiko\n\nBang Shishigami and Carl Clover\n\nMasami Yamada and Koishi Herikawa\n\nKelvin and Hope Stelar\n\nMelan and Moe\n\nTetsukan and Yoko Littner\n\nHibiki Tokai and Belvedere Coco\n\nMichelle has two different relationship roles with Troy Baker: half-siblings in Code Geass and lovers in Catherine.\n\nYuri Lowenthal has worked with Troy Baker in notables role.

Coyote and Rev Runner in Loonatics Unleashed.\n\nMatt Hill, Samuel Vincent, and Tony Sampson have worked together as a trio of pranksters in two franchises: Ed, Edd 'n' Eddy (The titular characters) and Oggy and the Cockroaches (Dee Dee, Marky, and Joey).\n\nThey were also in Cardcaptor Sakura as Kero, Yukito and Touya respectively.\n\nTabitha St. Germain and Cathy Weseluck have voiced characters together in two widely different franchises: the hardcore action series, Black Lagoon (Roberta and Garcia) and the lighthearted family oriented series, My Little Pony Friendship Is Magic (Rarity and Spike).\n\nAndrea Libman and Anna Cummer happen to voice a couple of characters together in Monster Buster Club (Cathy and Sam) and Strawberry Shortcake's Berry Bitty Adventures (Lemon Meringue and Strawberry Shortcake).\n\nVeronica Taylor and Rachael Lillis sure know how to work together in a few roles:\n\nAsh and Misty.\n\nJimmy and Natalie.\n\nAbby and Hela Nemo.\n\nMegumi Hisakawa and Miyu Tamaki.\n\nLuci Christian and Jessica Boone have some roles that they're together as well. Chiaki and Ayumi, Akane Serizawa and Akira Miyata, Prim and Kiri, and Duck/Princess Tutu and Rue/Princess Kraehe just to name a few.\n\nThere are times Phil LaMarr and Jeff Bennett have their characters interacted. The most notable is Ozzy and Drix, then there is Carver and the Pizza Guy, and Wilt and Bendy in episode of Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, \"Everyone Knows It's Bendy\".\n\nEven Candi Milo and Nika Futterman have voiced two characters in two different franchises: the educational animated series, Maya and Miguel (The titular characters), and the CGI animated series, Fanboy and Chum Chum (Lupe and Chum Chum).\n\nKira Vincent-Davis and Sasha Paysinger would often voice characters that happens to collaborate one another. Misaki and Kotoko, Ryo Misaki and Hatoko Kobayashi, and of course, Lucy and Nana.\n\nSpeaking of Kira Vincent-Davis, she is paired with Jason Douglas in a couple of franchises where they oppose each other. First is Misaki Kureha and Jean Luc LeBlanc and second is Lucy and Bando.\n\nTroy Baker would have two franchises where he plays a character to guard over a character played by Stephanie Sheh. First one is in Ninja Gaiden 3 as Ryu Hayabusa and Canna, and second is in Resident Evil 6 as Jake Muller and Sherry Birkin.\n\nSpeaking of Tony Sampson, he is paired thrice with Willow Johnson—first as Touya Kinamoto and Nakuru Akizuki, then as Seikai's Disciple and Kikyo in episode 22 of Inuyasha, and as Teddy and Starlight.\n\nAshleigh Ball and Kathleen Barr have three roles they're in together. Stephanie and Edgar, Mary and Lila Test, and of course, Kylie Morgan and Eris.\n\nOther Language Examples\n\nIn Mexican dubs, Gerardo Reyero and Monica Manjarrez sometimes play characters romantically involved with each other, such as Han Solo and Leia Organa in Star Wars and Stu and Didi Pickles in Rugrats. Interestingly, the Manjarrez voiced-Rei Hino also had a short crush on the Reyero-voiced Mamoru Chiba in Sailor Moon.\n\nAlso, Enzo Fortuny has not one, but two pigeonholed relationships: one with Cristina Hernández (Cardcaptor Sakura) and a more recent one with Leyla Rangel (Inuyasha, Kim Possible).\n\nPhilippe Peythieu and Véronique Augereau, the french voices of Homer and Marge Simpson, are married.\n\nIn Spain we have several fiction-couples examples:\n\nDavid Robles and Mar Bordallo.\n\nSalvador Vidal and Maria Luisa Solá.\n\nMaria Luisa Solá has crossed paths with Manolo Garcia quite often too.\n\nDaniel Garcia and Graciela Molina.\n\nNuria Mediavilla and... well... pretty much every single important Spaniard male voice actor of the last 15 years established in Barcelona (and some in Madrid).\n\nTwo or more characters with the same Seiyuu and English actor set"
