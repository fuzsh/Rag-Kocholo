        "text": "it doesn't work fine because the majority of banters don't trigger, because the timers were miscalculated or something (that's how it was in the original, and i suppose it's the same now in the EE if they didn't do anything about it). so that's something you can reliably call \"broken\"\n\nSetting the bar pretty low if having a working plot is the only thing that matters for your gaming experience. When I play a game, I want to experience as much as I possibly can in a play through. Not rushing through anything, but more of a complete experience. It's pretty flawed design imo if I only experience a handful of the *many* banters available in a thorough run. I guess that it wouldn't bother you, too, if only a handful of the side quests in PS:T were working.\n\nWithout understanding the intricacies of how the banters are coded I can't say this for sure, but if they're coded in such a way that it's likely you'll miss a lot of them even doing a completionist walkthrough, I'd say it's a coding flaw and really does deserve a fix.\n\nIncidentally, I suspect Qwinn is not working on any mods for EE. There's been no indication in the slightest that he is. I wonder if anyone can reverse-engineer his previous work and make it EE compatible? I'm (still) holding off playing as I don't feel like it's a complete experience without Unfinished Business and the Save Nordom! tweak."
