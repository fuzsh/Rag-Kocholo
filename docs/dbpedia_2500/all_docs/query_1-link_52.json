        "text": "Spoilers!\n\nSo, imagine that you would wake up one day, but instead of seeing anything familiar you are met with the smell of death, formaldehyde, and when you slowly open your eyes, the sight of a large mortuary. You can hear the dragging footsteps of lazy feet all around you. But they are slow, uneven and almost rhythmical, like they’re walking in a pattern. You slowly sit up, but your body seems sluggish and you can’t remember where you are, how you got there, why you are there or even, to your horrific realization, who you actually is.\n\nSuddenly a hoovering skull is coming your way and you can’t shake the feeling that this skull might know you or… that you should know him.\n\nAnd that’s how one of the best games in the world starts, and that’s not the strangest part, oh no.\n\nMorte, the skull that you meet there in that Mortuary, tells you where you are and joins up with you. He helps you escape the dirty and filthy place, and as you venture through it, you soon realize that it’s taken care of by zombies and skeletons. Both old and fresh to broken and whole ones, each slower than the next.\n\nThis game has really good graphics, great illustrated pictures with description of all things you can meet, epic dialogue and texts overall. On top of it all, some the spells looks more like a Final Fantasy game than traditional D&D game. It is a real written masterpiece in the game world that hasn’t been seen since in my opinion. The game has a really nice story and some parts of it makes me shiver when I play it. I has played it once before but it was this time around that I actually understood all of it and got the real concept of the game, or at least I think did, in my opinion.\n\nI played this game as a mage, a really intelligent, really weak (had 3 in strength), charismatic and wise mage that would save everyone that needed saving but still be able to strike a hard blow to those who are greedy, nasty or just evil without really thinking much about laws nor people around, well besides my companions. Especially Annah, my hot and confident tiefling. The characters in this game are so well written and the voice actors just nails every single character so well that it feels so real.\n\nAnd thanks to my character being so intelligent and wise, I could get the most out of this game in story. I could ask deeper questions, I could solve things better and I could learn things, like languages. But in some cases when talking to certain characters that needs translating, it is better to let your companions translate. You might learn something new about them. But you should talk to them now and then anyhow, they can teach you things about them that you didn’t know and even about yourself.\n\nSome more really memorable characters to mention, that is actually the rest of the followers you can find. Like the lovely Fall-From-Grace that is voiced by the all talented Jennifer Hale (so is the ghost Deionarra), Morte, who is voiced by Rob Paulsen, Ignus, who is voiced by Charles Adler, Dak’kon who is voiced by Mitch Pileggi (The man who plays Skinner in the X-Files series), Nordom who is voiced by Dan Castellaneta, (who is the voice of Homer Simpson) and some others. There are some really big names in there.\n\nIn my party I had my dear bad mouthed tiefling Anna, the healing succubus Fall-From-Grace, the always talking, insult tossing flying skull Morte, the Justice impersonated haunted armor Vhailor and my cute, fearful “cubed” warrior (Modron cube) Nordom and of course my own personal, ever so gleeful pet, my Lim-Lim. Who was with me to the almost very end only to die a tragic death. Also sadly I had to trade away the fearful human mage who’s always burning bright (literally), Ignus and the faithless Githzerai slave Dak’kon.\n\nI used a few mods in this game, like the heavy fixpack by Qwinn that fixed a whole lot in the game and the ‘Unfinished Business’ mod that restores many things into the game that was left out by various reasons.\n\nThe mods can be found here:\n\n– PS:T – Fixpack\n\n– PS:T Unfinished Business\n\n– PS:T Tweaks\n\nAnd I followed this really handy installation guide:\n\n– Torment Guide\n\nAll in all this game is a truly epic journey that everyone should play. The game gives you a lot of things to think about, like morals and the facts of life. One question in particular stands out and the game sort of revolves around it and the answer for it.\n\nThe question being, “What can change the nature of a man?”\n\nWell, what’s your answer? Leave a comment."
