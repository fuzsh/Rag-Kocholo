Just being around the developers and injecting real life into characters and narratives...that job must be fantastic.<BR><BR>What's also amazing is the range of the guy's work. I'd never have known that he voiced Gatts. He worked on Sacrifice AND Giants, two often-overlooked excellent and unique titles that shared a similar type of niche success.<BR><BR>Call of Duty!! <BR><BR>The Metal Gear Series!!<BR><BR>And of course, his trademark...Raziel. <BR><BR>Awesome.\n\nJan 4, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#5\n\nMore info on Bell, including a pic and the rest of the Kain cast here.<BR><BR>Tony Jay, the voice of the Elder God, also has a few good roles behind his name. Only about ten or so though.\n\nJan 4, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#6\n\nWow...Jennifer Hale's list kicks almost as much ass as Bell's, if not more. Not too familiar with her voice though, other than the Torment, Freelancer and Sacrifice ones.

She has a fucking massive credit list, her game credits include I-No (Guilty Gear XX), Lobelia Carlini (Sakura Taisen 3) and Rose (Japanese MGS2). She usually plays the sultry and/or psychotic female characters, and she does it pretty damned well. One of my friends is a die-hard Tomizawa Michie fan, but she just retired last year. She is Sumire Kanzaki, one of the main characters in Sakura Taisen, I have no idea what the series will do without her.\n\nJan 4, 2004\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#20\n\n<blockquote class=\"ip-ubbcode-quote\">\n\n<font size=\"-1\">quote:</font><hr>Originally posted by Vault Dweller:<br>Jay Anthony Franke - J.C.
