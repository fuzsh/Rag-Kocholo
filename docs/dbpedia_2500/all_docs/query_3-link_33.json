        "text": "Like many voice actors, Rob Paulsen could probably walk down any street in America and not be recognized, despite having worked on hundreds of animated series, video games, and television commercials. Beginning in 1981, with the \"Smurfs,\" Paulsen was a cartoon regular, subsequently contributing to \"G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero\" and \"Snorks,\" while also appearing on the popular TV shows \"St. Elsewhere\" and \"MacGyver.\" After voicing numerous episodes of the robot show \"The Transformers,\" Paulsen played Raphael on \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" and Gusto Gummi in \"Adventures of the Gummi Bears.\" In '93, after having worked on the macabre animated series \"The Addams Family,\" Paulsen voiced Throttle on \"Biker Mice from Mars\" and Antoine Depardieu on \"Sonic the Hedgehog,\" and started on the long-running \"Animaniacs,\" creating the voice of the popular character Pinky. After working on the animated superhero comedy \"The Tick,\" Paulsen reprised Pinky in '95's \"Pinky and the Brain,\" arguably his best-known role to date. Paulsen has worked consistently over his career, with numerous other series credits, including the action-packed shows \"The Powerpuff Girls,\" \"Danny Phantom,\"and \"The Mask,\" where he voiced the rambunctious title character. Paulsen has also contributed video games such as the fan favorites \"Doom\" and \"Metal Gear Solid,\" and was \"Mr. Opportunity\" on commercials for Honda."
