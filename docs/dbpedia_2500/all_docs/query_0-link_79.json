        "text": "So, what I've been meaning to tell y'all is, I have a pretty good autograph collection that I was never able to post due to how TFW was set up...was. Now that I can upload photos, I'll show you what I've got, starting with musicians:\n\nSteve Hackett:\n\nMike Rutherford:\n\nMipso (this one takes a little explaining: they're this super-good bluegrass band from Chapel Hill, NC who actually played in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade not a few years removed from now. I, being a fan, sent them shells from the beach and some cards to sign, and they all wrote back!):\n\nThe Weeknd (I consider this to be the crown jewel of my collection so far):\n\nHope you get that Headmaster Vorath signed one of these days to finish off your Charlie Adler collection! At LA Comic Con last year it was by sheer chance that I managed to get Carlos Alazraqui's autograph, as there was some miscommunication between him and the convention, he wasn't at his designated table and I spotted him as he was pretty much leaving the show. I'll be also seeing Nolan North at San Francisco Comic Con in June (though it will actually be held in Oakland across the Bay Bridge). I'm planning on getting him to sign FOC Bruticus and FOC Brawl but that signed Sky Lynx looks good too! He did a great job as Smokescreen in Transformers Prime.\n\nHere’s another couple of things from Indy Comic Con:\n\nCharlie Adler\n\nKevin Conroy\n\nAnd I got my picture with Sean Astin\n\nLast time I do the star photos, though. They’re very efficient, but you barely have enough time to say hello as they herd you through. I was obsessed with The Goonies in the mid 80s and I followed each of the stars of that movie through their careers, so this was a thrill for me (however short), so I had just enough time to congratulate him on his success and he seemed very grateful.\n\nSorry I missed you TBS, I ended up going on Friday instead of Saturday. Looks like you got a good haul as always\n\nYes, she had cancelled an appearance at San Francisco Comic Con a few years ago due to illness, so my niece and I were super excited to finally meet her!\n\nAmazing TF haul tbs! Tom Kenny is incredible as Spongebob (at least the early seasons) and was very memorable as Starscream in Animated. Glad to hear he's a great guy in real life.\n\nAbby Collins attended Botcon 2011, I got her to sign a Botcon Minerva card but didn't think to get her to sign the Starscream card they also had that year. As much as I like Tara Strong, they should have gotten Abby to voice Slipstream in Animated.\n\nWent to two events yesterday in Southern California. The first was the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cast reunion at the Sports Authentics store inside the Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry. Almost the whole cast of the orginal cartoon was present, as well as TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman. I didn't watch too many episodes of the cartoon when the show was on the air so no autographed turtles merchandise for me Lines weren't too bad and lots of oppurtunities for the fans to chat with the guests, it was a neat event!\n\nVery excited to meet Peter Reneday (voice of G1 Grapple as well as Splinter on TMNT). He signed my reissue and Generations Grapple, real nice guy:\n\nOn G1 Action card, one nice touch of the signing was the ticket stub souvenir with the date and name of voice actor.\n\nGood to see Townsend Coleman again, he signed my Titans Return Rewind this time. He rememberd basing Rewind's voice on KITT from the old Nightrider show:\n\nI've met Rob Paulsen a couple of times before to sign some Transformers and GI JOE figures but this time I had something obscure for him, a picture book from the old video game Planescape: Torment, where he voiced Morte, a floating skull companion to the main character:\n\nEven though the mall had some interesting memorabilia and collectibles stores (and was the location of some of the Back to the Future movies scenes) I had to leave soon to begin the drive down to Pasadena for the Monsterpalooza horror convention. Unlike the tmnt signing this show was packed with attendees, with huge lines for everything. Fans who didn't pre-register would have to wait a good long while to get into the show.\n\nMet Mitch Pileggi (Director Skinner from X-Files) who also signed my Planescape Torment book. He voiced Dak'kon, another companion of the main characfter:\n\nThis wasn't from yesterday's events but from last month's Babscon show where John De Lancie signed my Torment book, he was the voice of Trias the Betrayer, a fallen angel and one of the \"bosses\" of the game:\n\nOne big reason I had to go to Monsterpalooza was to meet Doug Bradley, who was Pinhead from the Hellraiser franchise:\n\nAshley Laurence, who was Kirsty Cotton from Hellraiser 1-2 was also at the show:\n\nKane Hodder on McFarlane Movie Maniacs Jason from the Friday the 13th movies (specifically part VII to Jason X):\n\nAndrew Divoff on Movie Maniacs Djinn from Wishmaster:\n\nThe longest line by far, possibly because he was only appearing that Saturday, was for Tobin Bell from the Saw films:\n\nMuch thanks to @SentaiTFMechaLover and @turbobluestreak for letting me know about the TMNT signing!"
