        "text": "From a time vortex that turns an entire civilization against a 14-year-old boy to a threesome contract, there’s a lot going on in Rick and Morty‘s Season 5 premiere. But no character embodies the word “what?” better than Rick’s recently-revealed foe Mr. Nimbus.\n\nThere’s just so much about Mr. Nimbus that’s pointedly weird. He’s an ocean god able to control the ocean and — for some reason — the police through a series of thrusts. He’s ruthlessly mocked by Rick, yet seems to be one of the few characters who understands this sad genius. He eats beignets in a creepy way. Basically, he’s a lot.\n\nWondering who voices one of Rick and Morty‘s craziest characters? Here’s who’s behind the voice of Mr. Nimbus and how Jim Gaffigan is involved in Rick and Morty Season 5, Episode 1.\n\nWho Voices Mr. Nimbus in Rick and Morty Season 5?\n\nFor once don’t trust the first name in the credits. Trust your gut. Though Rick and Morty‘s credits typically start with the name of the guest actor who had the biggest supporting role in this episode, the star of “Mort Dinner Rick Andre” was voiced than none other than series co-creator Dan Harmon. This is far from the first time the Community creator and Monster House co-writer has tackled a voice on the show.\n\nMr. Nimbus is voiced by Dan Harmon, in case that wasn’t clear.\n\nWho Else Has Dan Harmon Voiced in Rick and Morty?\n\nEven though most episodes of Rick and Morty revolve around Justin Roiland talking to himself, Harmon gets his voice on the show pretty regularly. He even voiced three characters in the show’s pilot. Harmon’s most notable characters have been the Flu Hatin’ Rapper, Ice-T, Heistotron, Randotron, Birdperson, and of course Phoenixperson.\n\nWho Does Jim Gaffigan Voice in Rick and Morty Season 5?\n\nNow that we know who voices Mr. Nimbus, the thrusting controller of the police, who does Jim Gaffigan play? That would be Hoovy. Hoovy is a husband and father on a planet where time moves faster than on Earth. So when Hoovy offers to help Morty bring a box of wine from his world to Earth, he unintentionally flings himself several decades into the future, leaving behind a grieving wife and a bitter son. Basically, Hoovy is a nice family man who had his life ruined by Morty’s stupidity.\n\nWhat Else Has Jim Gaffigan Been In?\n\nThere’s a reason why this comedian is the perfect choice to play a hapless family man. Jim Gaffigan is best known for his standup where he talks about his family, his love of food, and the many odd stories in the Bible. He’s likely best known for his stand up albums Mr. Universe and Obsessed. Gaffigan has also toyed with more dramatic roles, starring in Chappaquiddick, American Dreamer, Away We Go, and Troop Zero.\n\nBut one of the best looks into Gaffigan’s comedic sensibilities is his short-lived sitcom. The Jim Gaffigan Show only rans for two season, but it packed a lot of heart and love into those 23 episodes. You can watch it now on Paramount+."
