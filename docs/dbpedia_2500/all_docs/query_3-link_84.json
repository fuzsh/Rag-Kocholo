        "text": "Animaniacs Is More Than Just A Cartoon…\n\nDo you remember some of your favorite shows as a kid? One of my shows that I would watch all the time was Animaniacs. When that show came into my world I was always left wanting more. Thankfully for my generation Hulu is working with Amblin Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation to bring back the series. It is expected to start airing in 2020.\n\nAnimaniacs was a show that followed three siblings, Yakoo, Wakko, and Dot. There were the Warner siblings. The backstory is that they were three cartoon stars from the 1930s that were locked away in the Warner Bros. water tower until the 1990s, when they escaped. As they are roaming the Warner Bros. studio lot they run amok and cause havoc in the funniest way possible.\n\nBehind The Voice….\n\nIf you have listened to The Life of Dad Show you have come to find out that I am a big fan of voice actors. I love how they bring a character to life and make that character feel as real as can be. One of the actors on the Animaniacs series was Rob Paulsen. Rob has over 2,000 half-hours of animation credits, Rob’s versatility shines in his starring roles as the voices of Donatello in Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Yakko Warner, Pinky and Dr. Scratch ‘n’ Sniff in the Peabody and two-time Emmy award-winning series for Animaniacs.\n\nSo basically what I am saying is that if you watched at least five to seven animated series chances are Rob has voiced a few of those characters in those shows. I was extremely honored to have Rob come on The Life of Dad Show to talk about fatherhood, voice acting and more.\n\nWhat you will find really heartwarming in my interview with him is how proud he is of his son, Ash. Rob opens up about what values he and his wife instilled in Ash and how he views his relationship with his son. We also talk about some of the memorable moments in Rob’s career so far.\n\nAbout Rob….\n\nBorn in Detroit, Rob Paulsen spent his childhood in Livonia and Rochester, attending Junior and Senior high school in Grand Blanc, Michigan. Rob loved cartoons like most kids but aspired to be a professional hockey player. He says on his website that, “Fortunately, thanks to some big, strong, kid from Winnipeg who drilled me so hard my ears are still ringing, I learned around the age 18 I had neither the talent nor the temperament to make a living playing hockey. So, I turned to my other passions: singing and acting.”\n\nAs passionate about “paying it forward” as he is about his lucrative career, Rob supports various charities, particularly those benefitting children and military veterans. In his leisure time, Rob enjoys golf, cruising the PCH, and occasionally lacing up his skates for another chance to relive his past glory on the rink. He spends the majority of his free time with his wife, Parrish, and their Yorkshire terriers, Pooshie and Tala.\n\nRob says that, “Laughter’s the best medicine: the cool thing is, you can’t OD and the refills are free.”\n\nFollow Rob on…."
