        "text": "Ever since I watched the Nostalgia Critic's editorial The Looney Tunes Show:Good or Bad? and he put the \"Duck Dodgers\" in the category of a sell-out show in the franchise. And I wonder why? I thought a lot of the jokes in that show worked and was very entertainment.\n\nSo, in another installment of \"Pros and Cons\", I'm wondering what did you like about the \"Duck Dodgers\" series and what didn't you like about it?\n\nEver since I watched the Nostalgia Critic's editorial The Looney Tunes Show:Good or Bad? and he put the \"Duck Dodgers\" in the category of a sell-out show in the franchise. And I wonder why? I thought a lot of the jokes in that show worked and was very entertainment.\n\nI guess because of that one joke he showed.\n\nPros: It was nice to see a Looney Tunes TV series in which Daffy Duck was the star and was the hero and not placed in the role of the jealous meanie. Granted, Daffy as Dodgers was still cowardly and ridiculous, but that's Daffy. Also, the shows' opening theme song, performed by Tom Jones, was cool.\n\nCons: Not all of the episodes were gems. Some were pretty forgettable. The fact that Daffy, Porky and Marvin had to stay in character for the entirety of the series got kind of long in the tooth after a while. A few other Looney Tunes characters made guest appearances with a sci-fi makeover, but sadly, there was no appearance by Bugs Bunny; just a reference to him in the episode \"Hooray For Hollywood Planet\". I would have liked to have gotten just one episode with Bugs and Daffy.\n\nA quick Pro&Con for me: Pro; The Martian Queen was a nice addition and I liked the Martion Robots with Michael Dorn voicing. Con: The only thing that really bugged about the show was how stupid they made Daffy, I mean wasn't Daffy one of the few Looney Tunes characters who didn't fall for Bugs's disguises? He wasn't really stupid just bad lucked.\n\nPROS:\n\nAn awesome/funny new sci-fi Looney Tunes series with Daffy Duck being the star of the show based on the epic classic Duck Dodgers shorts, yaaaaaaaay, my top favorite of the new Looney Tunes reboots more better/funnier than The Looney Tunes Show.\n\nTom Jones singing the epic opening Duck Dodgers theme song and singing a role in Talent Show A Go-Go.\n\nDaffy Duck/Duck Dodgers being a funny egomanical/greedy/selfish/narcissistic/sociopathic jerkhole like in his classic Looney Tunes career, hehehe.\n\nThe likable/funny Looney Tunes characters/villains Porky Pig(The Eager Young Space Cadet), Dr. I.Q. Hi, Petunia Pig(Princess Incense/yaaaaaaay), Marvin Martian(Martian Commander X-2)/Commander K-9, Elmer Fudd(Mother Fudd), Yosemate Sam(K'Chutha Sa'am), Taz Tasmanian Devil(The Tasmanian Warrior), Wile E. Coyote(The Alien Hunter), Rocky & Mugsy, The Crusher, Nasty Canasta, Witch Hazel(Lezah the Wicked), Dr. Woe the Evil Scientist, Shropshire Slasher(The Andromeda Annihilator), The Goofy Gophers: Mac/Tosh(The Martian Gophers), Hubie & Bertie(yaaaaaay!!!!), Ralph Phillips(Baby-Faced Moonbeam/surprising that he's in it), and Count Blood Count(Count Muerte) playing awesome sweet roles.\n\nRalph Phillips being an epic evil brat villain Baby-Faced Moonbeam next to Evil Cecil Turtle(The Looney Tunes Show).\n\nCaptain Star Johnson a great funny obnoxious jerkoff rival and foil for Duck Dodgers, hehehe.\n\nThe new awesome/interesting villains Queen Tyr'ahnee(she's cute/entertaining), Martian General Z-9, Archduke Zag, Drake Darkstar(evil twin/Negaduck of the series, hehehe), Manobrain, Long John Silver the 23rd, Magnificent Rogue, Agent Roboto, Dr. Maniac, The Whoosh, the rival restaurant owner Marvin Martian clone, The New Female Cadet, Rona Viper, Hungortus(Galactus parody), Flame Valet(FireLord parody), Camoman, Royal Serpenti & Roy Serpenti, Black Eel(Black Manta parody, sweet), and Achu the Wizard(Aku parody, epic) who're my favorite villains.\n\nThe Star Trek/Predator/Zorro/Marvel/DC/The Iron Giant/Samurai Jack/pop culture parodies/references/appearances.\n\nK'Chutha Sa'am/The Klunkins(The Klingons), Mother Fudd(The Flood/The Borg), The Alien Hunter(The Predator), and Seaman(Aquaman, hehehe).\n\nGreen Lantern(Hal Jordan), Green Lantern(John Stewart), The Guardians, Kilowog/Katma/The Green Lantern Corps., and Sinesto(most epic DC supervillain) appearing in it.\n\nPorky's little siblings Porko/Puerco/Sow who're spin-offs of Yakko/Wakko/Dot voiced by Rob Paulsen/Jess Harnell/Tress MacNeille.\n\nJune Foray(Witch Hazel), Dick Beals(Ralph Phillips), Joe Alaskey(Daffy Duck/Marvin Martian), Bob Bergen(Porky Pig), Frank Welker(Commander K-9), Rob Paulsen(Mac Gopher), Jim Cummings(Taz Tasmanian Devil), Maurice LaMarche(Yosemate Sam), Billy West(Elmer Fudd), Dee Baker, Kevin Richardson(Nasty Canasta), Clancy Brown(Archduke Zag), Mako(the voice of Aku/Uncle Iroh, he'll be missed), and John DiMaggio voicing their cool roles.\n\nThe celebrities Tim Curry, Randy Savage(he'll be missed), John O'Hurley(Captain Star Johnson/Walter Bunny), Tia Carrere(rocked as Queen Tyr'ahnee), Michael Dorn(The Martian Centurion Robots/The Klunkins), Burt Reynolds, Dom DeLuise, Henry Winkler, Quentin Tarantino, Jeff Garlin, Dave Mustaine, Lewis Black, and Paget Brewster voicing their sweet roles.\n\nCONS:\n\nNo Bugs Bunny showing up who would be Duck Dodgers' third greatest rival after Captain Star Johnson/Martian Commander X-2 to be a cool funny Daffy and Bugs episode.\n\nNo Granny, Cecil Turtle, Speedy Gonzalez, Pepe Le Pew, Foghorn Leghorn, Gossamer, Sylvester, Charlie Dog, Pete Puma, The Barnyard Dawg showing up.\n\nBoth Drake Darkstar, Tasmanian Warrior(Taz Tasmanian Devil), The Alien Hunter(Wile E. Coyote), and The Andromeda Annihilator(Shropshire Slasher) didn't made returns, rats.\n\nCon: Dodgers NEVER shouted his famous \"Duck Dodgers in the 24&1/2th Century!\" line in any episode. Not even once! Have you ever noticed that? (Okay, to be fair, Tom Jones sings that for him in the theme song, but still, that's not how it used to be) The last time he said that was in that 2003 Looney Tunes short \"Attack of the Drones\"."
