        "text": "Adult Swim has revealed the season seven trailer for Rick and Morty and, along with it, the show’s new voice talent for its titular main characters.\n\nBelow is the first trailer for the new season, which features voice actors replacing co-creator Justin Roiland, who was dismissed from show due to misconduct allegations.\n\nIn an unusual move, the network is keeping the names of the new voice talents confidential until the show’s season premiere (yes, there are two — one actor for Rick and another for Morty).\n\n“We want the show to speak for itself,” explained an Adult Swim insider. “We believe in the strength of the season and our new voices and we want to preserve the viewing experience for fans.”\n\nThe Emmy-winning sci-fi comedy is coming back Sunday, Oct. 15, at 11 p.m. Like previous recent seasons, the new season will include 10 episodes.\n\nThe news follows Roiland being ousted from the global hit — as well as stripped of his lucrative overall deal — in January after he was charged with charged with felony domestic abuse in Orange County, California. The charges were quickly followed by the revelations of Roiland allegedly sending abusive direct messages to a fan, a resurfacing of previous problematic interview comments and allegations of workplace behavior issues. In March, however, the criminal charges were dropped.\n\nAdult Swim has been long seeking new “sound alike” talent for the show’s titular characters. The network has assured fans that the characters themselves will remain unchanged. Dan Stevens has been tapped for the lead in another Roiland animated series, Hulu’s Solar Opposites.\n\nAn official season seven description makes a reference to the recastings: “Rick and Morty are back and sounding more like themselves than ever! It’s season seven, and the possibilities are endless: what’s up with Jerry? EVIL Summer?! And will they ever go back to the high school?! Maybe not! But let’s find out! There’s probably less piss than last season. Rick and Morty, 100 years! Or at least until season 10!”\n\nAdult Swim points out that Rick and Morty was the top comedy across all of cable during seasons three, four, five and six. The series reached over 19 million viewers on linear broadcast in 2022 and remains a top series on streaming service Max. Rick and Morty has garnered two Emmys for outstanding animated program and is currently nominated for a third."
