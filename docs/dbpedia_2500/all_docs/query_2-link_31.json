        "text": "Voice actor Zoey Alexandria, a transgender woman best known for her performance as The Unknown in the horror video game Dead By Daylight, died on April 30 due to complications from a rare autoimmune disorder. She was 29 years old.\n\nAlexandria’s death was confirmed by the official Dead By Daylight account on X, formerly Twitter, earlier this week. “Like many in our community, we’re deeply saddened to learn that The Unknown’s voice actress, Zoey Alexandria, has passed away,” representatives for game studio Behaviour Interactive wrote. “We welcomed her into our world, and her talent shone brightly through her performance. Our thoughts are with her loved ones in this difficult time.”\n\nIn a text post on her YouTube channel late last month, Alexandria wrote that she had previously been diagnosed with two autoimmune disorders, Nonparaneoplastic Limbic Autoimmune Encephalitis and Stiff Person Syndrome. Alexandria explained in the post that she had made the decision to stop treatment back in February, due to “horrendous” side effects that offered only “a temporary fix” instead of a cure.\n\n“I’m very very very sick, [and] things are progressing fast,” Alexandria wrote, explaining she was suffering from more than a dozen seizures per day and even more stiffness attacks. “The main thing I’ve learned, is that life is too precious to focus on things beyond those you love and those who love you,” she told her fans. “Love is and always has been the answer.”\n\nAlexandria gained notoriety as a voice actor after she was cast as “The Unknown” in Dead by Daylight, a monster that “wears” its victims after killing them. The Unknown became somewhat controversial after its release, however, due to a playable skin that shows the deformed monster wearing a cheerleader’s outfit — a design that some trans players argued was a transmisogynistic stereotype. In a series of since-deleted social media posts, Alexandria said Behaviour developers did not communicate the character’s design to her ahead of time, but rejected claims that the developers were transphobic, saying the company was “nothing but kind and supportive” while she received “mass harassment for my involvement with the character.”\n\nIn addition to her voice acting career, Alexandria was also a vocal coach, and specialized in voice training for other trans women. She was also a singer and musician, and released two singles on her YouTube channel, “My Reality” and “Legacy.” A third single, titled “Dis-ease,” was partially finished at the time of her death.\n\nFans rushed to social media to mourn Alexandria’s death this week, posting tributes, well wishes, and fan art. On her YouTube post, fans expressed their thanks for Alexandria’s work and coaching, saying it helped them deal with their own vocal dysphoria.\n\n“Rest easy Zoey,” one commenter wrote. “I owe my voice to you.”"
