        "text": "Canadian voice actor (born 1958)\n\nMaurice LaMarche (born March 30, 1958) is a Canadian voice actor and comedian. He has voiced The Brain in Animaniacs as well as its spin-off Pinky and the Brain, Big Bob in Hey Arnold! (1996â€“2004), the title character from Inspector Gadget, and a variety of characters in Futurama, including Kif Kroker. He also voiced Egon Spengler in The Real Ghostbusters and its follow-up Extreme Ghostbusters.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche was born in Toronto, Ontario,[1] on March 30, 1958, to Guy LaMarche and Linda Bourdon.[2] His family moved to Timmins, Ontario, soon after he was born.[3] LaMarche's childhood was filled with his \"own little world of cartoons and sixties television\".[4] It was in his second year of high school that he learned of the popularity his talent for mimicry could garner him. This realization came from a coincidental performance in a high school \"variety night\" when a couple of friends urged him to enter. The act he performed at the variety night was \"celebrities as waiters\" which he used until the end of his stand-up career.[5]\n\nOne of his neighbours was future comedian, Mike Myers.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nStand-up comedy\n\n[edit]\n\nAt the age of nineteen, LaMarche took his high school act to an open mic night in New York City, performing to a reaction in which, as he describes, \"they just totally ignored me\".[7] This reaction was coupled with the criticism LaMarche received from fellow Canadian comedians who LaMarche describes as discouraging him from pursuing a career outside of Canada.[8] He returned to Canada, continued to do stand-up, and also started a career in voice work.\n\nThree years later, LaMarche moved to Los Angeles to further his stand-up career. This move, LaMarche says, would always be something he regretted doing instead of moving to New York: \"... in retrospect, I thought it was a mistake. I think that a couple of years in New York would have made me a stronger comedian.\"[9]\n\nOver the next five years, LaMarche's career progressed, playing comedy clubs throughout the US, with several appearances on The Merv Griffin Show and An Evening At The Improv. In spite of such interest, LaMarche believed that, while his impersonations and stage presence were professional, he needed to develop funnier comedy material. LaMarche was asked to be part of the 1985 HBO production Rodney Dangerfield Hosts the 9th Annual Young Comedians Special, on which Bob Saget, Rita Rudner, Louie Anderson, Yakov Smirnoff also appeared, and included the breakout first appearance of Sam Kinison. Although he was received and reviewed favourably, in looking back on his own performance in that special, LaMarche believed he was \"probably about five years away from going from being a good comedian to being a great comedian\" and being the \"only impressionist that actually comes from somewhere\".[10]\n\nDuring his standup career, LaMarche opened for such acts as Rodney Dangerfield, George Carlin, Howie Mandel, David Sanborn, and Donna Summer, usually in the main showrooms of Las Vegas and Atlantic City.[11]\n\nOn March 9, 1987, LaMarche's father was murdered, shot to death by a lifelong friend in a Toronto hotel lobby in front of dozens of witnesses. This sent LaMarche into depression and alcoholism for the next two years, effectively stalling his stand-up career.[12] After getting sober on January 20, 1989, LaMarche returned to stand-up comedy in the early part of 1990. As he was regaining self-confidence, his 18-year-old sister was killed in a car accident in September of that year.[13] At this point, though he remained sober, LaMarche decided to retire from stand-up comedy. He said, \"at that point I just threw up my hands and went, 'Oh, that's it. I don't have any funny left in me. I'm done'\".[13]\n\nVoice acting\n\n[edit]\n\nEarly Canadian work\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche's entry into the voiceover industry was in 1980 in Easter Fever and Take Me Up to the Ball Game, two animated Canadian TV specials from Nelvana.[14] He also was a regular voice performer on Toronto's pioneering cult TV hit The All-Night Show, which debuted in September 1980; a continuing feature had the lips of LaMarche inserted into a photograph of a famous person, and having LaMarche imitate that person to deliver a show promo or announcement. When LaMarche left the show in 1981, Jim Carrey was recruited to take his place as a voice actor.[15]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nIt took a few years after his 1981 move to Los Angeles for LaMarche to establish himself in the American voiceover industry, which he initially pursued as a side endeavor during his full-time standup comedy career. LaMarche began on Inspector Gadget with that show's second season in 1985, and went on to Dennis the Menace, Popeye and Son and The Real Ghostbusters where he played Egon Spengler. After The Real Ghostbusters, LaMarche became a regular mainstay of the voiceover industry, appearing in such shows as Tiny Toon Adventures, GI Joe, Attack of the Killer Tomatoes: The Animated Series, Taz-Mania, Where's Waldo, The Little Mermaid, Batman: The Animated Series, and Bonkers before landing perhaps his most recognized role in 1993 as The Brain on Animaniacs and later its spin-off show Pinky and the Brain. Following this, LaMarche worked on The Critic, Freakazoid!, and The Tick before then reprising his role of Egon in Extreme Ghostbusters. The stretch of two years after this saw LaMarche portray characters in such shows as Hey Arnold! as Big Bob Pataki, Queer Duck, and The Chimp Channel. During this time LaMarche became the voice actor for Mortimer Mouse, whom he voiced in the television series Mickey Mouse Works and House of Mouse. It was at this time, 1999, that LaMarche began work on Futurama, and since Futurama, he has continued to work steadily in television, including guest roles on The Simpsons (where he once again parodied Orson Welles). His most recent regular role came as Hovis the butler on the Nickelodeon series Catscratch. LaMarche was the voice of antagonist Father in Codename: Kids Next Door and was also the voice of Victor in Playhouse Disney's Handy Manny 2007 Halloween episode. He also played the voice role of Grumpy in the 2014 Disney XD series The 7D, a reimagining of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.\n\nLaMarche has done various voice work for many Warner Bros. Animation and DiC Entertainment cartoons. He also delivered the protracted belches for the \"Great Wakkorotti\" shorts on Animaniacs, in which Wakko Warner performed various pieces of music. One of those belches was later recycled for Buddy in 2003's New Line Cinema film Elf. In 2011, LaMarche reprised his role as Yosemite Sam in Cartoon Network's new series, The Looney Tunes Show, and its spin-off, New Looney Tunes.\n\nLaMarche made several appearances in My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic where he voiced Chancellor Neighsay.\n\nPinky and the Brain\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche plays the character of The Brain in both Animaniacs and the spin-off.[16] In creating the voice for Brain, LaMarche says he looked at a picture of the character and immediately thought of Orson Welles,[17] although the character was not modeled after Welles.[18] Voicing Brain gave LaMarche the opportunity to make use of his signature impersonation of Welles.[19] Many Pinky and the Brain episodes are nods to Welles' career. LaMarche won an Annie Award for his role as the Brain, and was nominated for an Emmy.[20] LaMarche later used this accent to voice Father in Codename: Kids Next Door.\n\nThe Critic\n\n[edit]\n\nWhile working on The Critic, LaMarche once voiced 29 characters in one 30-minute episode.[21]\n\nHis time on The Critic also afforded LaMarche the opportunity to once again parody Orson Welles, this time after a video reading of a will (the Sherman family was so wealthy, they had hired Welles to narrate it) dissolves into a commercial for Mrs. Pells Fishsticks, as well as another for Rosebud Frozen Peas (\"full of count-ry goodness and green pea-ness\"), and another for Blotto Bros. wine. He also occasionally served as an uncredited fill-in for main cast member Jon Lovitz as Jay Sherman.\n\nFuturama\n\n[edit]\n\nMuch of his best known voice work is from Futurama where he voiced Zapp Brannigan's beleaguered assistant Kif Kroker, melodramatic soap acting unit Calculon, the Nero-esque Hedonismbot, Morbo the news anchor, and Lrrr, ruler of the planet Omicron Persei 8, among numerous others. He has also done his Orson Welles impression on the show, winning a 2011 Outstanding Voice-Over Performance Emmy for his portrayal of Lrrr and Orson Welles in the episode \"Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences\". He won another Emmy the following year for the episode \"The Silence of the Clamps\".\n\nHeroes\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche acted, voice only, in the second episode of the hit NBC show Heroes, \"Don't Look Back\", as the villain Sylar. His voice is heard in a recorded phone conversation on Chandra Suresh's answering machine. The role of Sylar was later played by Zachary Quinto.[22]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche appeared in many films, including dubbing the voice of Orson Welles over Vincent D'Onofrio's on-camera performance in Ed Wood; PepÃ© Le Pew in Space Jam; supplying the voice of the Alec Baldwin puppet in Team America: World Police, and reprising his roles from Queer Duck and Futurama in the direct-to-video films Queer Duck: The Movie and Futurama: Bender's Big Score, respectively. More recently, LaMarche was the voice of Mr. Big, the Tundratown crimeboss in Disney's 2015 film Zootopia.\n\nHis one on-camera theatrical film performance was in the 1981 Canadian feature Funny Farm, not to be confused with a later Chevy Chase vehicle of the same name. The film follows the story of a young standup comedian's attempt to break into the big-time on the L.A. comedy scene. LaMarche played Dickie Lyons, an impressionist who befriends the main character, Mark Champlin. The film also starred Howie Mandel, Eileen Brennan, and Miles Chapin.\n\nIn Mark Hamill's 2004 film Comic Book: The Movie, LaMarche made a rare live appearance to be in the special features of the DVD alongside Pinky and the Brain co-star Rob Paulsen. Among other gags, he re-enacted his impression of Orson Welles' famous frozen peas commercial outtake.\n\nCommercials\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche has also lent his voice to commercials. He voiced Kellogg's Froot Loops spokesbird Toucan Sam, the animated Willy Wonka character in NestlÃ©'s Willy Wonka Candy Company commercials, and the narrator for Lexus commercials. He has also appeared as himself, doing the voice of Popeye the Sailor for the Long John Silver's restaurant chain in the early 1990s, reprising the role from the TV series Popeye & Son.\n\nOn 8 September 2018, LaMarche was featured in the commercial for the open world driving game Forza Horizon 4.\n\nTheme parks\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche provided the voice of Yosemite Sam for the Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure! dark ride at Six Flags Over Texas, which opened in 1992.[23]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLaMarche has been married to Robin G. Eisenman since May 19, 1991; together they have a son, Jonathan.[24]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nList of voice performances in films Year Title Role Notes 1983 Rock & Rule The Sailor[25] 1992 Tiny Toon Adventures: How I Spent My Vacation Dizzy Devil[25] 1992 Cool World Vincent Whiskers, Drunken Bar Patron[25] 1994 Scooby-Doo! in Arabian Nights Cyclops[25] Television film Tiny Toons Spring Break Special Dizzy Devil[25] Ed Wood Orson Welles Pom Poko Narrator, Second Drunk 1995 Napoleon Snake, Frill-Necked Lizard, Turtle[25] 1996 Space Jam PepÃ© Le Pew[25] All Dogs Go to Heaven 2 Lost & Found Officer[25] 1999 Wakko's Wish The Brain, Squit[25] Nominated â€“ Annie Award for Voice Acting in a Feature Production The Chimp Channel Harry Waller, Bernard Mogge: The Movie Tiny 2000 The Life & Adventures of Santa Claus Mogorb[25] Alvin and the Chipmunks Meet the Wolfman Lawrence Talbot, Wolfman 2002 Balto II: Wolf Quest Balto[25] Direct-to-video Inspector Gadget's Last Case: Claw's Revenge Inspector Gadget Hey Arnold!: The Movie Big Bob Pataki, Head of Security[25] Tom and Jerry: The Magic Ring Spike, Alley Cat[25] Direct-to-video 2003 101 Dalmatians II: Patch's London Adventure Horace Badun[25] Elf Buddy's Burp Uncredited 2004 Team America: World Police Alec Baldwin Balto III: Wings of Change Balto, Bull Moose[25] Direct-to-video Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers Medium Beagle Boy[25] Comic Book: The Movie Himself Segment: \"Behind the Voices\" 2006 Tekkonkinkreet Fujimura Bah, Humduck!
