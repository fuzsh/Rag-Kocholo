        "text": "To portray the voice of a wizened dragon, Rick and Morty turned to an actor best known for a series filled with them. The Irish actor Liam Cunningham is known to most people as Ser Davos Seaworth from Game of Thrones. Though not usually a voice actor he must have enjoyed his role on Rick and Morty as he turns up again briefly in Roiland’s Solar Opposites.\n\nPhil LaMarr\n\nMultiple Minor Roles\n\nThe first two things most people (and by most people I mean me) think of when they think of Phil Lamarr are his time on Mad TV and the moment his head explodes on Pulp Fiction. But aside from sketch comedy and head explosions, LaMarr has had a remarkable voice acting career. He portrayed the title character in Samurai Jack while also providing his voice to Justice League, Static Shock, and countless video games. It’s surprisingly hard to figure out what voices Phil LaMarr plays on Rick and Morty but given his talents it’s certain to be quite a few.\n\nAlan Tudyk\n\nChris, Observant Glorzo, Multiple Minor Roles\n\nAlan Tudyk is a nerd culture mainstay. Very few comic-cons come and go without Tudyk involved in at least one project presenting within them. Tudyk has played Hoban “Wash” Washburne on Firefly and its spinoff movie Serenity, Mr. Nobody on Doom Patrol, and many more beloved characters. His live-action appearances are just the tip of the nerd iceberg, however, with Tudyk providing his voice to everything from Solo: A Star Wars Story (K-2SO) to Harley Quinn (Clayface/The Joker). On Rick and Morty, Tudyk plays several unnamed characters.\n\nRob Schrab\n\nGod\n\nRob Schrab is a Channel 101 veteran and longtime Harmon collaborator. Schrab is best known for his work as a director of projects like Monster House, Community, Parks and Recreation, and more. On Rick and Morty he plays none other than God…or at least the Zeus-like god of a remote planet.\n\nKyle Mooney\n\nBlazen\n\nKyle Mooney is an SNL cast member and writer who specializes in offbeat characters and sketches. He also wrote and starred in 2017’s Brigsby Bear. On Rick and Morty he voices the Mortal Kombat-esque faux badass Blazen in season 5 episode “Rickdependence Spray.”\n\nTroy Baker\n\nTimmy Timtim, General\n\nTroy Baker’s voice is an extremely well known one thanks to his lead role as Joel in the classic video game franchise The Last of Us.\n\nDawnn Lewis\n\nAssimilated Alien #1\n\nAfter getting her start as Jaleesa Vinson on late ’80s sitcom A Different World, Dawnn Lewis has settled into a fruitful voice acting career.\n\nLauren Tom\n\nKendra, Xing Ho\n\nA prolific voice actor, Lauren Tom has been a part of the Rick and Morty supporting cast since season 5.\n\nJon Allen\n\nMr. Poopybutthole\n\nJustin Roiland’s exit from the series in season 6 means that more roles than just Rick and Morty need to be recast. The first actor to take over from Roiland in a non-Rick or Morty capacity in Jon Allen as long-running tertiary character Mr. Poopybutthole. Allen is a prolific voice actor with nearly 100 credits to his name\n\nFamous Guest Actors\n\nDana Carvey\n\nLeonard Smith\n\nThe voice of Jerry’s dad is provided by one of SNL’s better known alums in Dana Carvey. A master impressionist, Carvey was an important figure on SNL during the ‘80s and would go on to star in Wayne’s World, The Master of Disguise, and Trapped in Paradise. Shortly after his SNL career, he hosted The Dana Carvey Show, which did not last long but is notable in TV history for having an incredible cast of writers including Louis C.K. Charlie Kaufman, Jon Glaser, Robert Carlock, and frequent Dan Harmon collaborator Dino Stamatopoulos.\n\nJohn Oliver\n\nDr. Xenon Bloom\n\nJohn Oliver now carries on the legacy of The Daily Show in his superb HBO news series Last Week Tonight. Prior to finding his perfect comedy news niche, Oliver had a lengthy comic acting career starting in his native England and extending into his new home in the U.S. Oliver previously played an important recurring role in Harmon’s Community and pops up just once on Rick and Morty.\n\nDavid Cross\n\nPrince Nebulon\n\nDavid Cross is one of several sketch comedy legends who lent their voice to Rick and Morty as part of their lengthy careers. Cross created and starred in sketch series Mr. Show with Bob and David alongside co-creator Bob Odenkirk (how has he not popped up on Rick and Morty yet?). Since then he’s had a successful stand up career and been a part of some impressive TV ensembles such as Arrested Development.\n\nAlfred Molina\n\nMr. Needful\n\nMany of us know Alfred Molina from his incredibly successful film career in projects like Boogie Nights, Spider-Man 2, and The Da Vinci Code. But Molina has also had quite the career as a voice actor as well. In the past couple decades, Molina has lent his sturdy voice to Rango, Monsters University, Ralph Breaks the Internet, Frozen II, and more. He was clearly a shrewd choice for the Lucifer-like Mr. Needful. It’s a wonder why he hasn’t turned up on Rick and Morty more.\n\nRichard Fulcher\n\nKing Flippy Nips\n\nRichard Fulcher is best known as the unofficial third member of British comedy troupe The Mighty Boosh, though he himself is American. Fulcher wrote and acted in every incarnation of The Mighty Boosh. He has also had a prolific career in comedy acting outside the troupe. As of late, Fulcher has leaned into his voice acting abilities including this sadly one-off role on Rick and Morty as King Flippy Nips, ruler of Pluto.\n\nKeegan-Michael Key\n\nSchleemypants\n\nKeegan-Michael Key is likely best known as half of the ultra successful sketch comedy duo Key & Peele. (Wonder whatever happened to the other guy!) Key has had an enormously successful career as a comedic actor on television. On Rick and Morty he plays testicle-looking time cop Schleemypants.\n\nJordan Peele\n\nSecond Fourth-Dimensional Being\n\nOh, here’s Peele! Schleemypants’ unnamed partner is the only character Peele has played on Rick and Morty.\n\nJemaine Clement\n\nFart\n\nNew Zealand comedic actor Jemaine Clement is best known being half of the Grammy award-winning comedic musical act Flight of the Conchords alongside Bret McKenzie. Clement has also worked extensively with fellow Kiwi Taika Waititi to produce recent classics like What We Do in the Shadows. His deadpan delivery was a perfect choice monotone gaseous being “Fart.”\n\nAndy Daly\n\nKrombopulos Michael\n\nKrombopulos Michael is Rick and Morty’s Boba Fett: he looks cool but ultimately does nothing. Playing K.M. was one of the most sought-of “character voice actors” in the industry. Daly’s cheerful everyman delivery has proven useful on dozens of comedy shows across the entertainment landscape. Perhaps best known for his starring vehicle Review with Forest MacNeil, Daly has also lent his voice to series such as Harley Quinn, Bob’s Burgers, and Big Mouth. He can also be heard as a crucial role on Roiland’s Solar Opposites.\n\nChristina Hendricks\n\nUnity\n\nChristina Hendricks is best known for her role as Joan Holloway on Mad Men. In addition to that, however, she’s appeared in quite a few genre films and shows like Firefly, Life, and The Neon Demon. Hendricks has done some voice work here and there and her only role on Rick and Morty to date is assimilation expert and one-time Rick Sanchez paramour Unity.\n\nPatton Oswalt\n\nBeta-Seven\n\nPatton Oswalt is basically the dark matter of the comedy universe. He and his voice turn up just about everywhere. Perhaps his best known voice acting role is that of lead character Remy in Ratatouille. On Rick and Morty he has played only Beta-Seven thus far and is surely due for some more appearances.\n\nStephen Colbert\n\nZeep Xanflorp\n\nStephen Colbert is of course a longtime comedic actor, host of The Colbert Report, and now host of The Late Show on CBS. The Late Show understandably takes up most of his time nowadays but he was nice enough to portray the intelligent alien living inside Rick’s flying saucer’s Miniverse battery.\n\nNathan Fielder\n\nKyle\n\n“The Ricks Must Be Crazy” has quite the star power among its voice cast. In addition to Colbert’s Zeep, the episode also introduces another Microverse populated by Kyle. Kyle is played by Nathan For You’s cringe comedy maestro Nathan Fielder.\n\nWerner Herzog\n\nShrimply Pibbles\n\nWerner Herzog might be the strangest inclusion in the Rick and Morty voice canon. Herzog is a towering figure in the cinema world as a director, screenwriter, documentarian, and occasional actor. His German accent and generally serious and pessimistic disposition has made him a natural target for comedies looking to inject a bit of weird humor into the proceedings.\n\nJames Callis and Tricia Helfer\n\nPat and Donna Gueterman\n\nJames Callis and Tricia Helfer portray the parents of double-agent Tammy Gueterman for a very specific reason. Callis and Helfer are best known for their roles on Syfy’s classic series Battlestar Galactica, with Callis playing brilliant scientist (and traitor to humanity) Gaius Baltar and Helfer playing Cylon model Number 6. Pat and Donna Gueterman on Rick and Morty look just like the actors playing them, which should have been our first clue that something is amiss.\n\nNathan Fillion\n\nCornvelious Daniel\n\nWho is Nathan Fillion if not nerd culture’s best friend? Fillion came into prominence by playing Captain Mal Reynolds on Joss Whedon’s beloved Firefly. Since then Fillion has had a solid career on shows like Castle and The Rookie. In his spare time, however, he provides his voice to animated series like Rick and Morty and Big Mouth, often playing a thinly-veiled version of himself. Cornvelious Daniel is notable for being the first character onscreen in Rick and Morty to enjoy that sweet, sweet McDonald’s Szechuan sauce.\n\nJoel McHale\n\nHemorrhage\n\nJoel McHale is, of course, another Community alum. He played lead character Jeff Winger on Harmon’s old NBC series. In addition to that, McHale has had a lengthy career in comedy, having hosted The Soup and Netflix’s recent Tiger King special. He was also a tight end of the University of Washington football team but that’s neither here nor there. He voices bucket-wearing post-apocalyptic warlord Hemorrhage on Rick and Morty.\n\nSusan Sarandon\n\nDr. Wong\n\nPerhaps no character on Rick and Morty has delved deeper into Rick’s psyche than Smith-family psychologist Dr. Wong. Lending her voice to Dr. Wong in the infamous “Pickle Rick” episode is legendary actress Susan Sarandon a.k.a the Louise in Thelma and Louise.\n\nDanny Trejo\n\nJaguar\n\n“Pickle Rick” really has quite the impressive guest voice cast. Danny Trejo joins Peter Serafinowicz and Susan Sarandon in lending his voice to this episode. Trejo plays Rick’s loose canon action hero ally, Jaguar. Outside of Rick and Morty, Danny Trejo may be one of the most recognizable faces in entertainment. A frequent collaborator of Robert Rodriguez, Trejo has leveraged his fascinating upbringing and tough guy appearance into countless roles.\n\nGillian Jacobs\n\nSupernova\n\nAnother Community alum! Superhero team The Vindicators requires a lot of guest voice talent and clearly Dan Harmon knew one place to turn. Jacobs played Britta on Community (she’s the worst). The Pittsburgh-born actress has also appeared in Girls, Don’t Think Twice, and Ibiza.\n\nChristian Slater\n\nVance Maximus\n\nChristian Slater is a big get for Vindicators leader Vance Maximus. While he’s best known to modern audiences as the titular Mr. Robot in Mr. Robot, Slater got his start as an actor with popular roles in movies like Heathers, Interview with the Vampire, and Broken Arrow. Slater has had a fruitful voice acting career as well, having previously played “Slater” in Archer.\n\nLance Reddick\n\nAlan Rails\n\nAlan Rails is another one of the hallowed Vindicators crime-fighting team. Playing the ghost train-summoner is Lance Reddick. Before he passed away in 2023, Reddick was a mainstay on television for decades, turning up in Oz, Fringe, Lost, and more. Most notably he played Cedric Daniels for the entirety of The Wire’s run.\n\nLogic\n\nLogic\n\nLogic is one of the few Rick and Morty guest stars who gets to be an animated version of himself. This Maryland-based rapper has released five successful albums and enlisted Rick and Morty to help promote his sixth mixtape Bobby Tarantino II.\n\nSam Neill\n\nMonogatron Leader\n\nIn addition to having one of the best Twitter accounts in the world, Sam Neill is also an actor best known for playing Dr. Alan Grant in Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III. The New Zealander has continued to work quite a bit in recent years, turning up in Thor: Ragnarok and Peaky Blinders. On Rick and Morty he plays the leader of the Monogatron alien race in “The Old Man and the Seat.”\n\nTaika Waititi\n\nGlootie\n\nPlaying another Monogatron, this one named Glootie, is New Zealand actor/director Taika Waititi. Waititi got his start in the New Zealand comedy scene alongside other Rick and Morty guest star Jermaine Clement. Since then he has only gone on to become one of the most in-demand filmmakers on the planet. Waititi is behind Thor: Ragnarok, JoJo Rabbit, and many other films.\n\nKathleen Turner\n\nMonogatron Queen\n\nKathleen Turner is what you would call a “get” for Rick and Morty. Turner has won two Golden Globe awards and been nominated for an Oscar and several Tony awards. She is best known for her roles in ‘80s movies Romancing the Stone, Prizzi’s Honor, and The War of the Roses. Turner has also been working as a voice actress since the ‘80s, voicing Jessica Rabbit in Who Framed Roger Rabbit and going on to act in The Simpsons and King of the Hill as well.\n\nJeffrey Wright\n\nTony\n\nJeffrey Wright is no stranger to sci-fi, having toiled away as sad robot Bernard on Westworld for three seasons. Wright got three-quarters of a way to an EGOT in one role by playing Belize in Angels in America. Since then he’s acted in several Daniel Craig Bond films, Boardwalk Empire, and The Hunger Games. On Rick and Morty he plays the role of an alien who vexes Rick into an existential crisis by continuing to use his private toilet.\n\nElon Musk\n\nElon Tusk\n\nBefore he ruined Twitter, Elon Musk was best known as a South African/Canadian/American engineer and industrialist who served as the founder and CEO of SpaceX and CEO of Tesla, along with numerous other ventures. Presumably he did not call anyone behind the scenes of Rick and Morty a pedophile but you never know.\n\nJustin Theroux\n\nMiles Knightley\n\nJustin Theroux has had quite the career in Hollywood. He first came to prominence acting in the David Lynch films Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. He then continued to appear in major films while also writing some for good measure like Tropic Thunder, Iron Man 2, and Rock of Ages. On television he played Kevin Garvey in HBO’s The Leftovers. For Rick and Morty, he played the role of “heist artist” Miles Knightly in “One Crew Over the Crewcoo’s Morty.” You son of a bitch, I’m in.\n\nMatthew Broderick\n\nTalking Cat\n\nMatthew Broderick is a longtime stage, film, and television actor best known for his roles on Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, WarGames, The Producers, and much more. Most recently he turned up on Netflix’s sadly-departed post-apocalyptic comedy Daybreak. On Rick and Morty, Broderick plays a Talking Cat with a secret so heinous it will drive anyone to near insanity.\n\nChristopher Meloni\n\nJesus\n\nWhen Rick and Morty briefly presented the savior of mankind in season 4’s sixth episode, surely there was only one choice to play him. Christopher Meloni has had one of the more fascinating careers in entertainment. After playing the deadly serious role of Elliot Stabler on Law and Order: SVU for years, Meloni has re-embraced his comedic side in projects like Happy!, Harley Quinn, while reprising his role in the Wet Hot American Summer franchise.\n\nPaul Giamatti\n\nStory Lord\n\nPaul Giamatti once joked in a late night talk show interview that his role in any given heist or action movie would be the guy wearing a headset in a van, typing on a computer, and telling the hero to “get out of there, man!” He has since parlayed that character actor sensibility into a remarkable, multi-award-winning career. Giamatti is best known recently for portraying Chuck Rhoades on Billions and producing AMC’s Lodge 49. Prior to that he played lead roles in American Splendor, HBO’s John Adams, and much more. The guy has a good handle on stories and therefore makes perfect sense as Rick and Morty’s Story Lord.\n\nJim Gaffigan\n\nHoovy\n\nJim Gaffigan is a wildly successful standup comedian who co-created and starred in a TV show about his life for TV Land called The Jim Gaffigan Show. While he’s appeared sparingly in films, of late he’s dabbled in voice acting, lending his voice to Hotel Transylvania 3, Playmobil: The Movie, and Luca. His kindly Midwestern accent lends itself nicely to the helpful but doomed Hoovy on Rick and Morty.\n\nAlison Brie\n\nPlanetina\n\nFive seasons in and Rick and Morty is still finding old friends from Community to make their debut. Alison Brie played Annie Edison on Dan Harmon’s classic series. Since then she’s become quite the star, serving as a lead on GLOW and voice acting in BoJack Horseman and The Lego Movie 2. She even provided the voice of Natasha Romanoff a.k.a. Black Widow in the video game Marvel Avengers Academy.\n\nSteve Buscemi\n\nEddie\n\nSteve Buscemi is a prolific and talented character actor known for his classic roles in Fargo, Reservoir Dogs, The Sopranos, and more. That he plays such a relatively minor role on Rick and Morty suggests that he might be a fan of the show and just wanted to stop by and say hey. Buscemi is also notable for being a New York firefighter prior to his acting life.\n\nChristina Ricci\n\nPrincess Ponietta\n\nOnce known as a talented child actor, Christina Ricci has continued her creative work into adulthood. The actress has starred in films like Speed Racer, Black Snake Moan, and the upcoming fourth Matrix movie. Bless her for dropping by Rick and Morty only to play an CHUD horse-person princess pregnant with Rick’s heir.\n\nDarren Criss\n\nBruce Chutback, Naruto\n\nDarren Criss wrote and starred in A Very Potter Musical, which helped jumpstart his Broadway career. He’s also a frequent collaborator of TV producer Ryan Murphy, having starred in American Crime Story: The Assassination of Gianni Versace as spree killer Andrew Cunanan. On Rick and Morty, he played Morty’s strangely appealing classmate Bruce Chutback.\n\nTimothy Olyphant\n\nCoop\n\nThanks to his roles as Seth Bullock on Deadwood and Raylan Givens on Justified, Timothy Olyphant is TV royalty. And that’s not even to mention his successful film career including the likes of Scream 2, The Girl Next Door, and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. His Rick and Morty character, Coop, was a part of the show’s “Thanksploitation Spectacular.”\n\nPeter Dinklage\n\nChans\n\nOne of the most accomplished actors of his era, Peter Dinklage is likely best known to most folks from his role as Tyrion Lannister on Game of Thrones. In season 6 of Rick and Morty he plays Die Hard-obsessed villain Chans.\n\nLisa Kudrow\n\nTyrannosaurus Rex God\n\nAfter getting her start as Phoebe Buffay on Friends, Lisa Kudrow has really just had the time of her life popping up in her guest TV roles of choice. On Rick and Morty that means lending her voice to a Tyrannosaurus rex.\n\nJason Mraz\n\nBrachiosaurus God\n\nJoining Lisa Kudrow as a celestial dinosaur is musician Jason Mark.\n\nWill Forte\n\nPissmaster\n\nDismal supervillain Pissmaster is one of the most tragic figures ever on Rick and Morty. To play him, the show brings on a guy who knows how to play a sad sack or two. Best known as an SNL castmember of note, Will Forte has popped up all over the comedy world with roles in projects like The Last Man on Earth, MacGruber, and Clone High.\n\nJack Black\n\nViscount of Venus\n\nSeason 6 episode “A Rick in King Morthur’s Mort” is one of the most guest star-heavy installments in Rick and Morty history. Highlighting the major cameos is comedic superstar Jack Black (School of Rock, The Super Mario Movie, etc.). It’s actually a little surprising that it look Black this long to pop up on Rick and Morty. The actor has a long history with Dan Harmon, having starred in the pilot of Harmon and Rob Schwab’s Heat Vision and Jack and guesting on Community.\n\nDaniel Radcliffe\n\nKnight of the Sun\n\nDaniel Radcliffe is another major celebrity who seems perfectly in tune with Rick and Morty‘s bizarre sense of humor. After portraying the iconic Harry Potter through eight films, Radcliffe has been wildly creative and experimental with his roles, portraying a corpse in Swiss Army Man, Weird Al in Weird: The Al Yankovic Story, and just about everyone else in anthology series Miracle Workers.\n\nDavid Mitchell and Robert Webb\n\nKnights of the Sun\n\nAs a fun little Easter egg to comedy fans, British comedic collaborators David Mitchell and Robert Webb both guest in “A Rick in King Morthur’s Mort” as Knights of the Sun. The Mitchell and Webb duo is best known for their sketch shows That Mitchell and Webb Sound and That Mitchell and Webb Look and beloved sitcom Peep Show.\n\nHugh Jackman\n\nHugh Jackman"
