Are there more?\n\nI'm aware that I'm asking a lot and that it'll take some time before I will be able to actually start a new game, but I'll appreciate any help and I won't mind if we go somewhat OT remembering the old days of great modding and play!\n\nWell, since I don't know what exactly you are looking for, I'll go with this:\n\nFor new mods, I would recommend the Widescreen Mod(more like a resolution change mod ), and the Level 1 NPCs\n\nA lot of new stuff, hundreds of mods, and my own memories of the game mechanics and general \"mods lore\" are faded...\n\nFor instance, what tactics mods can I mix and how?\n\nI would like to take the best from Xyx's, Weimer, and the new Gibberlings 3 mod for instance.\n\nSword Coast Stratagems, and SCS2 are probably the best because the NPCs won't cheat and they work with (nearly)everything. For more info you probably should look at the BiG World v5.xx documents from here. It has info on nearly every mod there is and an instructions of what to choose and on which order try to do it, fixes etc.\n\nLittiz! Dear me, an old hand indeed...\n\nI would recommend Amber as an NPC who fits in well--Kivan, too. I'm still not sure any NPC to date fits in \"seamlessly,\" but those are the ones I personally thought were the closest.\n\nBentornato! Sei solo di passaggio o rimani?\n\nRegarding mod compatibilities, there is no fast-and-hard rule or comprehensive thread nowadays (there are some attempts at making a download-compatible-mods tool, one being my graduation thesis, but for now tough luck). Your best bet is to read mod descriptions and post the one which interest you, and some kind soul will post compatibility, install order and further suggestions (or rather, ten kind souls will come and say ten incompatible things). Also, you might be interested in known that there's something going on for RtW, but unfortunately I can't say anything more specific\n\nAs for my 2 cents, I wouldn't install SCS or SCSII (or any tactics mod) if you haven't played the game for four years, they are quite tough combat-wise and you'll end up reloading ten times over each mage battle.\n\nItalian users: help test the Stivan NPC!\n\nAuthor or Co-Author: WeiDU - Widescreen - Generalized Biffing - Refinements - TB#Tweaks - IWD2Tweaks - TB#Characters - Traify Tool - Some mods that I won't mention in public\n\nMaintainer: Semi-Multi Clerics - Nalia Mod - Nvidia Fix\n\nCode dumps: Detect custom secondary types - Stutter Investigator\n\nIf possible, send diffs, translations and other contributions using Git.\n\nI would not consider Saerilith \"totally in tone with the game\". More like \"should come with a custom title screen reading Saerileth's Gate\". ...sorry, I'll be quiet now.\n\nI hear Xan is good, though, and he'd be good for consistency if you used him in BG1.\n\nI'll echo the_Bigg here: your best bet is checking the modlist and trying out stuff on your own; if you have any doubt about compatibility, you only have to post.\n\nAs for what you've missed(and what I genuinely find interesting _and_ relatively bug-free), let's see. I remember you've been around when Keto/Quest Pack/The Longer Road came out, so:\n\nQuests:\n\nTower of Deception\n\nAssassinations\n\nDungeon Crawl\n\nNPC and NPC-related:\n\nFade\n\nde'Arnise Romance\n\nKivan\n\nXan\n\nAngelo\n\nRomantic Encounters\n\nAlso, for Tutu:\n\n- BG1 NPC with six new romances,\n\n- Gavin mod,\n\n- Coran and Xan Friendship,\n\n- BG mini-quests and encounters\n\nBG2 Tweaks and Level1NPCs are must-haves for me. And, yes, the usual: Banter Pack, Flirt Pack, Dungeon-Be-Gone, select components of Unfinished Business and Quest Pack.\n\nAnd Domi's IWD2 NPC, absolutely - I've heard a new version will be available soon.\n\nAs for Widescreen Mod, at G3, that mod might as well be considered mandatory if you're using a widescreen monitor. Without it, everything is out of proportion. I'm loving the mod.\n\nDo you like convenience mods at all? If so, you might consider some aspects of SCS and SCSII worthwhile, even if you elect not to install the combat enhancements. I wouldn't be able to play Tutu without the \"Allow NPC pairs to separate\" component of SCS.\n\nAs for Dungeon-Be-Gone, maybe you might not want it on your first run-through in years, but you might like it on subsequent games. Ditto the \"Skip Candlekeep\" component of SCS and \"Faster Cutscenes and Dreams\" of BG2 Tweaks.\n\nThe Gibberlings Three Anniversary Mod is good for a little levity, if you don't like quests that are too serious all the time. I've found it an entertaining way to burn a day or two while waiting for something else to happen, like waiting to get Mazzy back, or for Jan's quest to start, or for Nalia's father's funeral.\n\n\"Imagination is given to man to console him for what he is not; a sense of humor, for what he is.\" - Oscar Wilde\n\nberelinde's mods\n\nTolkienAcrossTheWater website\n\nTolkienAcrossTheWater Forum\n\nThanx all!\n\n@the_bigg:\n\nyes, I plan to stick around as much as I can (after all, you can't play without getting caught again by the environment!)\n\nOf course I'm being realistic tough, I probably won't be able to be an active member as I've been in the past.\n\nRtW, you say? Well, you know my take on the subject.\n\nNever getting to release that mod was one of the worst CRIMES we could do to the gaming community.\n\nPlease let me know what's happening, if your claims are true\n\nOk, I shall procede with patience, step by step.\n\nA first preliminary list of the mods I'd intend to use, letting NPCs aside for the moment\n\n(those will be tricky since I'd REALLY want to use a monk and a sorcerer to try our Refinements tables, which I'd never gotten around to play myself, after all the work.... , but other needs apply...)\n\nFixes, of course.\n\nBg2 Tweaks, Ding0 Tweaks (selected components)\n\nGraphic Enhancements: 1pp, Flaming Sword, Inventory Bams...\n\nAscension, Weimer's Tactics (though probably not everything), Item Upgrade\n\nSlightly Improved Ilyich (not Weimer's)\n\nSomething from Improved Battles\n\nRogue Rebalancing (the parts that are not addressed by Refinements too)\n\nOversight\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nVirtue\n\nBanters Pack\n\nSword Coast Stratagems II (I don't mind the challenges @bigg - I was quite the player in my days, and honestly the story arc is well known already. I'll re-learn what I've lost, and I'm prepared to bang my head at the monitor for each one of those countless reloads )\n\nPossibly other tactical additions, provided I can figure out how to let them all interact...\n\nSome more Item packs (possibly balanced and cool, I like the idea of restoring the BG1 items for instance)\n\nTower of Deception (looks indeed very good, thanx Kulyok)\n\nMinor convenience modifications, as Berelinde calls them (xpcap remover, the Teleport spell I've seen somewhere...)\n\nRefinements (HLAs, Swashimoen, Revised Armors, Shapeshifting fix, Sword Angel). Too bad SCS II will be using the old tables for the enemies though, right the_bigg?\n\nBah, I'm probably forgetting a ton already.\n\nI know I'll have a hard time working out a feasible configuration and, let's call it, an installation walkthrough\n\nAnyhow, if some evident mistake or suggestion hits you, I'll keep appreciating the help!\n\nThanx guys, I'm getting the feel of the place already again\n\nEdited by Littiz, 29 March 2008 - 10:59 AM.\n\nYes, you're forgetting all of my mods.\n\nSeriously, here's one bit of advice you may find useful: install Virtue _dead last_. After Refinements, after everything. Otherwise, all your parting NPC dialogues are screwed. SCS II should go right before Virtue, and BG2 Tweaks right before SCS II.\n\nAlso, yes, Ascension/Tactics among the first, fixpack first of all - but you know that already, I know. Have fun playing!\n\nEdited by Kulyok, 29 March 2008 - 10:58 AM.\n\nThe Monk NPCs suck IMNSHO (or anyway have just a couple of banters), whereas the Sorceror NPCs don't (Tashia, Kelsey, and an install-time option for Xan are all sorcerors). You can also use L1NPC to make Bioware characters (or Mod ones, past tp2 hacking) into a Sword Angel or a Monk, to free up other slots for Mod NPCs.\n\nThe SCSII readme should provide info regarding compatibility with all other tactical challenges, whereas Refinements is choosy with regards to Item Packs (kit mods, OTOH, are now much nicer) - again, the readme is your friend. Rogue Rebalancing also maintains a nice compatibility pinned topic in its forum (since aVENGER just came back). Of course, quest (and, to a lesser extent, tactical) mods tend to contain items, making full Refinements compatibility iffy (but you can of course play through the quest and discard the item, differently from Item Mods).\n\nRegarding other mods, I think that most of Oversight is included in BG2Fixpack or other mods anyway and Improved Battles is just an hack&slash fest against level 20 fighters dual-wielding Hackmasters and with infinite potions. Somebody will post a more detailed install order (I'm not really into all those intricacies nowadays).\n\nRegarding RtW, your best bet should be to PM either Cuv or SConrad for info - while I'm the team, I've been idling out busy with WeiDU and WSM.\n\ninstall Virtue _dead last_. After Refinements, after everything. Otherwise, all your parting NPC dialogues are screwed.\n\nThey'll still be. My patch still wasn't merged.\n\nEdited by the bigg, 29 March 2008 - 11:14 AM.\n\nItalian users: help test the Stivan NPC!\n\nAuthor or Co-Author: WeiDU - Widescreen - Generalized Biffing - Refinements - TB#Tweaks - IWD2Tweaks - TB#Characters - Traify Tool - Some mods that I won't mention in public\n\nMaintainer: Semi-Multi Clerics - Nalia Mod - Nvidia Fix\n\nCode dumps: Detect custom secondary types - Stutter Investigator\n\nIf possible, send diffs, translations and other contributions using Git.\n\nHey Littiz--long time, no see. I don't really have anything worthwhile to the conversation at this point (the others seem to have things covered), but I wanted to stop by and say hi.\n\nHi to all who remember me and to everyone else\n\nHey there Littiz, good to see you again!\n\nFor instance, what tactics mods can I mix and how?\n\nI would like to take the best from Xyx's, Weimer, and the new Gibberlings 3 mod for instance.\n\nPersonally, I'd just stick with SCSII. It's pretty much your one-stop-shop for tactical AI enhancements and it also incorporates most of the stuff which was previously handled by Tactics.\n\nWhich NPCs mods are generally considered totally in tone with the game?\n\nI thought Xan and Kivan were great additions to the original Bioware cast, and JC's de'Arnise Romance (Nalia) is looking pretty good so far too.\n\nRogue Rebalancing\n\nI think you'll like the new version. Make sure to check my Compatibility Guide before installing it though.\n\nFixes, of course.\n\nBg2 Tweaks, Ding0 Tweaks (selected components)\n\nGraphic Enhancements: 1pp, Flaming Sword, Inventory Bams...\n\nAscension, Weimer's Tactics (though probably not everything), Item Upgrade\n\nSlightly Improved Ilyich (not Weimer's)\n\nSomething from Improved Battles\n\nRogue Rebalancing (the parts that are not addressed by Refinements too)\n\nOversight\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nVirtue\n\nBanters Pack\n\nSword Coast Stratagems II (I don't mind the challenges @bigg - I was quite the player in my days, and honestly the story arc is well known already. I'll re-learn what I've lost, and I'm prepared to bang my head at the monitor for each one of those countless reloads )\n\nPossibly other tactical additions, provided I can figure out how to let them all interact...\n\nSome more Item packs (possibly balanced and cool, I like the idea of restoring the BG1 items for instance)\n\nTower of Deception (looks indeed very good, thanx Kulyok)\n\nMinor convenience modifications, as Berelinde calls them (xpcap remover, the Teleport spell I've seen somewhere...)\n\nRefinements (HLAs, Swashimoen, Revised Armors, Shapeshifting fix, Sword Angel). Too bad SCS II will be using the old tables for the enemies though, right the_bigg?\n\nBah, I'm probably forgetting a ton already.\n\nI know I'll have a hard time working out a feasible configuration and, let's call it, an installation walkthrough\n\nBased on this very general advice -- http://forums.gibber...s...=6438&st=4# -- and on very specifc lessons learned on these boards:\n\nAscension\n\nG3 BG2 Fixpack\n\nUnfinished Business\n\nTower of Deception\n\nBanters Pack\n\nWeimer's Tactics (though probably not everything)\n\nSlightly Improved Ilyich (not Weimer's)\n\nSomething from Improved Battles\n\nSword Coast Stratagems II\n\nPossibly other tactical additions\n\nItem Upgrade\n\nSome more Item packs\n\nMinor convenience modifications, as Berelinde calls them (xpcap remover, the Teleport spell I've seen somewhere...)\n\nOversight\n\nRogue Rebalancing\n\nBg2 Tweaks, Ding0 Tweaks (selected components)\n\nRefinements\n\nVirtue\n\nGraphic Enhancements: 1pp, Flaming Sword, Inventory Bams...\n\nMajor convenience modifications, e.g. Widescreen Mod\n\n\"I gladly simp for jastey\" -- Aza\n\n==========================================================\n\n\"You ever notice that \"What the hell?!\" is the answer to just about everything?\"\n\n==========================================================\n\n\"Girls are like phones, they like to be held and talked too, but if you press the wrong button, you will be disconnected!\" DJ Nikodemus\n\n================================================================\n\nCommunity Contributions\n\n* Level 1 NPCs * gMinion: expanded TP2 for MegaInstalls * PSM (PSQM): expanded scripts for Melanthium * Shar Nadal (DSotSC-BGT) revision * non-detectable Cloak of Non-Detection ?? * Weimer's-Tactics: revised TP2 for MegaInstalls * a directory of Mega-Installation Guides *\n\nNice to see you again too, aVENGER and SConrad!\n\nThis place is still quite decently inhabited, it seems\n\nAgain thank you all for your help.\n\nIt's been harder than I imagined but I nearly completed my full reinstallation of game and mods.\n\n@aVENGER, your guide helped me considerably a figuring out a lot of things (and of course I love your mod, it's been a road opener as we've always claimed!).\n\nYes, you're forgetting all of my mods.\n\nWell, Assassination doesn't seem the mod for me, but Xan is already in, included as a Sorcerer as the_bigg's brilliantly suggested\n\nThe final list is as follows:\n\n-BG2_Fixpack\n\n-Ascension\n\n-Item Upgrade\n\n-Ruad\n\n-Underrepresented Items\n\n-Tactics (very few seemingly undependent components)\n\n-Banters Pack\n\n-Unfinished Business\n\n-QuestPack\n\n-1pp (and Flaming Sword)\n\n-Rogue Rebalancing\n\n-Bg2 Tweaks\n\n-Sword Coast Stratagems II\n\n-Xan\n\n-Saerileth\n\n-Refinements\n\n-Kivan\n\nSorry Azazello, I read your suggestions too late. Hopefully things won't be too much messed up anyway\n\nAt this point, I only have one last question for you guys.\n\nMy final addition (for this particular game) would be Virtue.\n\nBUT, I need Viconia as a Cleric, while I will be performing a lot of good deeds.\n\nThe Happy Party tweak reports that Virtue will nullify the tweak itself... now, I know this makes sense, but it'd be a shame to lose Virtue just for this problem, after all, Viconia is almost a forced choice (I want a full cleric and no, I'm not in the mood for Anomen..).\n\nAny suggestion about this issue? I can't wait to start playing\n\nYep, if you get Cuv from Toril and generally from playing (and modding) Oblivion, he can copy you the last version of Strohm part of RTW for testing\n\nSorry Azazello, I read your suggestions too late. Hopefully things won't be too much messed up anyway\n\nPlease believe all of us when we say: Reinstall NOW. Don't wait, don't walk. RUN.\n\nYep, if you get Cuv from Toril and generally from playing (and modding) Oblivion, he can copy you the last version of Strohm part of RTW for testing\n\nBut is it really going on?\n\nThe yahoo group seems inactive.\n\nI don't have time myself ATM for another modding frenzy, but...\n\nPlease believe all of us when we say: Reinstall NOW. Don't wait, don't walk. RUN.\n\nI trust your words Azazello, but installing the game with the mods has become a very LONG and TIRING issue... for this time I'd accept even a broken installation. Free afternoons come sparsely\n\nThank you all for the help again anyway, we'll see how the game unfolds\n\n...but installing the game with the mods has become a very LONG and TIRING issue...\n\nYou've been away awhile. Quick re-installing is now, well, quicker, and as simple as\n\nOne (or 111) ...\n\nTwo ...\n\n333...\n\nProbably the most developed NPC mod is Kulyok's Xan. So...believable. If anyone fits seamlessly into the game it's him.\n\nDomi's Kivan and Deheriana mod is a close second.\n\nI also enjoy Yikari and Hubelpot, though they pale in comparison to the first two mentioned."
