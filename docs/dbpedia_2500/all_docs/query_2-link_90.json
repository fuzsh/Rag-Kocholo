        "text": "Barcelona to open at the Duke of York’s Theatre London in October\n\nScreen stars Lily Collins (Emily in Paris, To The Bone, Mank) and Álvaro Morte (Money Heist, Wheel of Time, Immaculate) are set to make their West End stage debuts this autumn in acclaimed two-character play Barcelona at the Duke of York’s Theatre in London’s West End.\n\nWritten by American playwright and screenwriter Bess Wohl (Camp Siegfried – The Old Vic, Grand Horizons – Tony Award nominated Best New Play), Barcelona will run for 12 weeks only at the Duke of York’s Theatre, from 21 October 2024 to 11 January 2025.\n\nDirected by Lynette Linton (Shifters, Blues for an Alabama Sky, Sweat), the play is set in the Spanish city of Barcelona, where an American woman on a hen weekend plunges recklessly into a one-night stand with a dashing Spaniard.\n\nBut during the course of that single, shocking night — by turns funny and dangerous — her romantic fantasy morphs into a complicated game of cat and mouse.\n\nThe American character, Irene, is played by Lily Collins, and Spanish character Manuel is played by Álvaro Morte.\n\nBarcelona had its world premiere in 2013 at the People’s Light & Theatre Company in Pennsylvania, US, and its West Coast premiere in 2016 at LA’s Geffen Playhouse, starring Betty Gilpin and Carlos Leal.\n\nCharles McNulty of the Los Angeles Times said of the drama that the “wiley two-character drama by Bess Wohl, never becomes the play you think it’s going to become. The playwright stays one step ahead of theatergoers – not to trick them, but to hold out for deeper truth.”\n\nJoining Lynette Linton in the creative team are Set & Costume design by Frankie Bradshaw, Lighting by Jai Morjaria, Composition and Sound Design by Duramaney Kamara and Xana, Video Design by Gino Ricardo Green, Wigs, Hair and Makeup Design by Cynthia De La Rosa, UK casting by Heather Basten and US Casting by Jim Carnahan, Movement Director & Intimacy Shelley Maxwell, Vocal Coaching by Hazel Holder and Dramatherapy by Wabriya King. Associate Direction by Katie Greenall, Associate Design by Natalie Johnson, Associate Costume Designer & Supervisor is Caroline Stevens, Production Manager is Kate West, Associate Production Manager is Charlotte Ranson.\n\nThe show is produced by ATG Productions, Bad Robot Live and Gavin Kalin Productions.\n\nBess Wohl is an award-winning American playwright and filmmaker, with her plays produced on and off Broadway, across the US, and internationally including London.\n\nHer play Camp Siegfried had its world premiere at The Old Vic in London in 2021, directed by Katy Rudd, and starring Patsy Ferran and Luke Thallon; and her other plays include Grand Horizons, Make Believe, Small Mouth Sounds, American Hero, and the musical Pretty Filthy.\n\nBess Wohl’s debut feature film Baby Ruby, starred Noémie Merlant and Kit Harington, and premiered at the Toronto Film Festival in 2022. Bess also wrote for the Apple TV+ series Extrapolations.\n\nActor Lily Collins said in a statement: “It has been a childhood dream of mind to perform in the West End and I’m hugely excited to make my stage debut in Bess’ exciting play, Barcelona. Working with this team has truly been a gift and I cannot wait for audiences to be taken on a thrilling journey as the play unravels. I knew the moment I finished reading the script, I had to play Irene.”\n\nActor Álvaro Morte said: “The London theatre scene is a vibrant and exhilarating canvas for fresh, groundbreaking work. I am thrilled and honoured to be a part of this captivating new play, marking my West End debut. I’m looking forward to bringing Barcelona to life and sharing it with audiences.”\n\nWriter Bess Wohl said,:“Having my work on the West End with such phenomenal collaborators is a dream come true. I’m honoured to have the chance to share this play with London audiences.”\n\nDirector Lynette Linton said, “What a privilege to be working with this incredible team of artists to bring Bess’ words to life. I can’t wait to get in the room with everyone. Come Through!”\n\nBarcelona is playing at the Duke of York’s Theatre in London from 21 October 2024 to 11 January 2025.\n\nRecent productions at the Duke of York’s Theatre include Jamie Lloyd’s production of Romeo & Juliet starring Tom Holland.\n\nUp next at the Duke of York’s is Shifters starring Tosin Cole and Heather Agyepong, from 12 August to 12 October 2024 – also directed by Lynette Linton.\n\nBook tickets to BARCELONA at the Duke of York’s Theatre in London\n\nTICKETS ON SALE AT 12 NOON TODAY\n\nBarcelona The Play\n\nDuke of York's Theatre, London\n\nBook tickets\n\n📷 Main photo: Barcelona in the West End - Starring Lily Collins and Álvaro Morte\n\nRelated News\n\nMore >"
