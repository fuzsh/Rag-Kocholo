        "text": "Following the previous outrageous and most stellar episode of Season 7 yet, this past Sunday’s episode of Adult Swim’s Rick and Morty returns to the “clip show” style of storytelling that series co-creator Dan Harmon is partially known for through both this series and his prior one, NBC’s Community. It isn’t precisely a kind of clip show told via bottle episodes like “Total Rickall” and “Morty’s Mind Blowers”. Although, the episode does provide its main characters with insight into themselves via hindsight. It almost clues in on what the future may hold if they continue similar paths.\n\nThe seventh season’s sixth episode is titled, “Rickfending Your Mort”. It is written by story editor Cody Ziglar and directed by Jacob Hair.\n\nIn this review, I will discuss Rick and Morty Season 7 Episode 6. As the title of this article suggests, there will be no spoilers present here. References to previous series episodes may be made!\n\nRick and Morty Season 7 Episode 6 Logline\n\nAccording to WarnerMedia Press, here is the logline for Rick and Morty Season 7 Episode 6—“Rickfending Your Mort”.\n\nMorty gets audited. Gotta keep those receipts, dawg.\n\nAdult Swim Press\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis week’s episode of Rick and Morty isn’t one for major character developments or to progress what the next potential story arc. Still, it presents a moral for the week, which is that Rick Sanchez (voiced by Ian Cardoni) and Morty Smith’s (voiced by Harry Belden) actions—both individual and together—are almost cyclical. On the surface, the episode presents a light-hearted anthologized set of new never-before-seen moments from the series. However, digging deeper into the black comedy aspect of the narrative, “Rickfending Your Mort” serves as a constant reminder that Rick and Morty tend to be screw-ups.\n\nWith the choices that Rick made in last week’s episode, fans and viewers now see him coping by resorting to the one thing he knows how to cope with best: the bottom of a beer bottle. Yet, the events that follow the opening scene are low-key reminders that Rick and his grandson are human after all, despite their very decisions put on official record as if through “universal police body cam[era]s”.\n\nArtsy Work\n\nCharacter design lead Elisa Phillips and their team help craft a vivid array of figures. For example, there are The Legend of Zelda-esque guardians of a sanctuary, the series’ protagonists if depicted as vampire hunters straight from a comic book, a cosmic space gorilla, Morty as a dog, Rick’s head on a leg, and even a sentient churro stick. These all make no sense but are posited wonderfully in front of the backdrops made by background design lead Vance Caines and his team. The dusk on the ocean and island landscapes in “License This” are beautiful, showcasing the vastness of Earth. In addition to that is the aestheticism of Wes Anderson’s cinema through different angles and architectural aspects.\n\nBrent Noll, Kelly Yoo, and the rest of the prop design team draw some fascinating objects to supplement the clips of the narrative. For instance, we see a vampire hunter’s complex combination of weapons and microwavable burritos. One interestingly animated clip is Jerry Smith’s (voiced by Chris Parnell) interaction with syringes and a men’s room urinal. This is an absurd animation next to Morty “fighting” the apeborg in the former half of the episode. They showcase how ridiculous things can sometimes tend to be, which is fine.\n\nHow Deep Can This Rabbit Hole Go?\n\nOut of all the props animated for this episode, one clip highlights a sort of political issue going on in the world today. Through the use of dark comedy, the episode takes a moment or so to offer commentary on gun control. It is cyclical, uncanny, spiral actions such as what our protagonists commit to here that they continue to make the same attempts at a feat and fail until they discover what works. This was the case with Rick searching for his nemesis, Rick Prime last week. In this episode, Morty makes life-threatening choices that he does not fully realize can definitely and absolutely put others in physical harm.\n\nOn one hand, there is the argument that the protagonists’ actions are merely a part of experimentation. Their life experiences include learning in the name of science, which is a key component of the scientific method. Cody Ziglar and the writers’ room pose new questions, form hypotheses, and make various “What if…?” scenarios. On the other hand, these lessons of hindsight and insight also hold a theme of accountability. Similar to Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons’ graphic novel or HBO’s sequel television series, Watchmen, the episode demonstrates that nobody—not even extraterrestrial entities—should solely be bystanders in any given situation. There is no trouble in intervening and making a change, which is what tends to happen in the show through its protagonists.\n\nThe Crew Behind Rick and Morty\n\nRick and Morty is co-created by Dan Harmon (Community).\n\nThe series’ main theme and score is done by Ryan Elder. Hunter Curra serves as the supervising sound editor.\n\nWes Archer is the supervising director. Alex Song-Xia and Cody Ziglar are story editors, while Grace Freud is the staff writer.\n\nJeremy Gilfor is the writers’ assistant. Michael Kellner and Jax Ball are 2nd writers’ assistants.\n\nClaire Levinson serves as the editor. David Seger is the assistant editor.\n\nRuth Lambert and Robert McGee are the voice casting directors. Katelyn Semer and Amanda Ray are casting associates. Sara Jane Sherman is the additional casting director.\n\nAmy Chapman and Nick Reczynski are voice-over consultants.\n\nAnimators\n\nJason Boesch (Fish Hooks, Star Wars: The Clone Wars) is the art director. Philip Vose serves as the assistant art director. Carol Wyatt is the color supervisor.\n\nElisa Phillips (The Venture Bros., HarmonQuest) is the character design lead. Vance Caines (Regular Show, Close Enough) is the background design lead. Brent Noll serves as the prop design lead, while Kelly Yoo is the assistant prop design lead.\n\nBismarck “Butch” Datuin, Sander Goldman (Big Mouth), and Joe Wierenga serve as the storyboard artists. Rufino Roy Camacho II (Futurama, Sausage Party, Disenchantment, Harley Quinn) and LaVon O’Bannon are additional storyboard artists.\n\nAdam Burnier, Kari Kilpela, Khang Nguyen, Louie Ramos, Wilder Rees (Solar Opposites), Maya Shavzin (Final Space), and Amy Sherrier are the character designers.\n\nAlex Picar works on the character design clean-up.\n\nSean Bodley, Daniel Chiu (The Simpsons, Solar Opposites), Leasa Epps-Eisele, Liza Epps, Cynthia Ignacio, Tiffany Kao, Kevin Chiya Kuan, Alex J. Lee, and Erik D. Martin work on the background design.\n\nDevyn Adams and Tyler Justice work on the background clean-up.\n\nThe Voice Cast Behind Rick and Morty\n\nIan Cardoni voices Rick Sanchez, the genius scientist of the series. Harry Belden voices Morty Smith, the teenage grandson of the series.\n\nSpencer Grammer voices Summer Smith, Rick Sanchez’s granddaughter and Morty Smith’s older sister. Chris Parnell and Sarah Chalke (How I Met Your Mother) voice Jerry and Beth Smith, Summer and Morty Smith’s parents.\n\nMaria Bamford (The Legend of Korra, BoJack Horseman, Santa Inc., The People’s Joker, Teenage Euthanasia, Big Mouth) and Ryan Hansen (Veronica Mars, Fantasy Island) star in guest voice roles.\n\nDan Harmon makes a cameo as the voice of Birdperson.\n\nTroy Baker (The Last of Us), Eric Bauza (Trese, Animaniacs, Gremlins: Secrets of the Mogwai), Phil Hendrix, Echo Kellum (Arrow, The Old Man, High on Life), Albro Lundy, Nolan North, Nick Reczynski, Ryan Ridley, Rob Schrab, and Kari Wahlgren also provide voice roles.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Rick and Morty Season 7 Episode 6\n\n“Rickfending Your Mort” is an episode that raises spirits while also showcasing life’s severity and gravity. While there is not much else to it than that, Rick and Morty reminds its fans that our worlds are interconnected, one way or another. In fact, we just need to traverse the spaces of the unknown to discover the realm of possibilities.\n\nRick and Morty Season 7 is now airing on Adult Swim via Cartoon Network. The season will stream via Max (formerly HBO Max) next year!\n\nHave you seen the series yet? If so, then what are your thoughts on it so far? Let us know!
