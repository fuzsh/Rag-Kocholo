        "text": "You may not have heard of Rob Paulsen, but you've certainly heard his voice.\n\nThe Emmy Award-winning voice actor is the sound behind some of the most popular cartoon characters, including the goofiest lab mouse in Pinky and the Brain, and Raphael in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\n\nWatch the full story above.\n\nKnow the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today\n\nAway from the booth, Rob suffered a private battle - with a throat cancer diagnosis threatening his health and career.\n\n\"As they say, we make plans, and God laughs,\" Paulsen said.\n\n\"The treatment was pretty brutal and got my attention - but I'll be damned, the doctors and the fine group of people we have here in southern California were able to cure me, and I'm back in the studio doing what I love to do.\n\n\"The cancer experience has given me a sense of empathy that I don't think I ever would've had.\"\n\nNow in remission and with a new lease on life, he's headed back to the studio with some familiar favourites.\n\nThe origin story\n\n\"I came out here to do live action like most folks,\" Paulsen said.\n\n\"When the opportunity came to read for animation, I said, sure, everybody loves cartoons - and I want to work.\n\n\"The first jobs that I did in animation were GI Joe and Transformers - which turned out to be fairly iconic in their own right.\n\n\"But it didn't take me long to think, wow, nobody cares that I'm an average-looking kid from Michigan.\n\n\"I am only limited by my imagination, and the kindness of people who hired me.\n\n\"It doesn't take long to figure that that's the way to go. And fortunately, my wife convinced me that I have a face for cartoons - and my ego can handle it.\n\n\"These characters are profoundly important to many, many people - and way beyond an action figure or a rating point or paycheck. It's a real privilege to be in this position.\"\n\nFind out more about Rob's new book, Voice Lessons, on his website."
