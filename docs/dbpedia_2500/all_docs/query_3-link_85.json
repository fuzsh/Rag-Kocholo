        "text": "Inside the Voice Actor’s Studio with global voice-over superstar Rob Paulsen!\n\nLongtime Voicetrax San Francisco Guest Director and author of “Voice Lessons: How a Couple of Ninja Turtles, Pinky, and an Animaniac Saved My Life”. Rob is Back By Popular Demand and the only repeat guest in the history of our lecture series\n\nSaturday, January 9, 2021 10 am-1 pm Pacific (Virtual via Zoom)\n\nWe are thrilled to offer our next “Inside the Voice Actor’s Studio,” featuring globally recognized voice-over superstar Rob Paulsen. Rob has voiced iconic characters that continue to be adored around the world, including: Yakko from Animaniacs, Pinky from Pinky and the Brain, Raphael from the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Donatello from the Turtles reboot, Jimmy Neutron Boy Genius, and numerous other voice acting roles over the past three decades and still going strong at the top of his industry.\n\nRob joins quite an impressive list of voice acting legends who have participated in the continuing Voicetrax San Francisco series, “Inside the Voice Actor’s Studio,” including Nancy Cartwright, Peter Coyote, Laraine Newman, Billy West, as well as Natalie Lyon (casting director, Pixar Animation Studios) and others.\n\nThis virtual experience is bound to be incredibly inspiring for voice actors and non-voice actors alike, given Rob’s extraordinary career that culminated in his diagnosis of throat cancer in 2016. While Rob’s cancer battle put his voice acting career in jeopardy, his life-changing journey opened his eyes and his heart to what’s most important in life, resulting in his thought-provoking book: Voice Lessons: How a Couple of Ninja Turtles, Pinky, and an Animaniac Saved My Life.\n\nWith over 2,000 half-hour programs and dozens of films, video games, and other animated media to his credit, surely Rob has been one of the hardest working, most in-demand, and most beloved voice artists in the industry, earning (so far) a Daytime Emmy and Peabody and winning the Annie Award three times. Yet, his courageous and grueling battle over cancer is clearly his biggest win. Rob now serves as the Head and Neck Cancer Alliance celebrity spokesperson in the hopes of inspiring others. Rob was recently quoted in a Cure article as saying that the best advice he can give is to “find a way to smile, whether it’s in dealing with cancer or COVID-19. It sounds so simple: I say laughter is the best medicine, but the cool thing is you can’t overdose, and refills are free.”\n\nIn his words, “I have had the gift of cancer, and when I’ve gotten to be able to see how people behave, even when they know they’re on their way out sometimes, it’s nothing sort of astonishing, the power of the human spirit. And it’s always, unfailingly, attached to humor or joy in some way. I encourage people to find any joy they can.”\n\nYou can share in the joy, wisdom, insights and talents of Rob Paulsen – whether you are an aspiring voice actor, an animation fan, or just someone who needs a little inspiration in their life – by registering for Inside the Voice Actor’s Studio, Saturday, January 9, 2021, 10 am-1 pm Pacific: $70, on Zoom.
