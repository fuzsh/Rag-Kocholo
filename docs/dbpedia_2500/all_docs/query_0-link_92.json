He is married to Parrish Todd and has one son. In an interview with a Chicago TV station, Paulsen described himself as \"a singer who decided to become an actor.\" Growing up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Paulsen sang in choir throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in grammar school. However, his idol growing up was Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings; he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice, primarily interested in becoming a professional hockey player.\n\nPaulsen has long supported charity organisations, and donated considerably for cancer research. He has worked a lot for GOALmodels, a program for adolescents, and is a sponsor of Camp Will-A-Way, a camp for mentally and physically disabled children.

A few years later, his career launched into more substantial roles such as \"G.I. Joe\" and \"The Snorks\". He had an impressive turn as the villain \"Jesse Blue\" in the series \"Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs\".
