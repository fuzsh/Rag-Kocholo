        "text": "There was a time when you could select a audio template for your character that had the voice actor for Mort Goldman from Family Guy. Seems a lot of ppl that got that template, COMPLAINED. and it got patched.\n\nOnly parts of the template was audio from Mort, best was the fall, YELL.\n\nMy only male character's voice sounds.. I don't know.. sometimes like a 12-year old, sometimes like Kermit, sometimes more normal. Not sure why it's so extremely different for different actions, but I wish THIS one got patched as well. It's kinda embarrassing when I jump/fall down somewhere and he sounds like Tarzan at age 12 lol\n\nVenus Ocean - Breton Sorceress VR16, EP, Tamriel Hero | Gixia - Breton Sorceress VR16, EP, Tamriel Hero\n\nFrances Demnevanni - Breton Dragonknight VR16, EP, Tamriel Hero | Raygee - Breton Nightblade VR16, EP, Tamriel Hero\n\nLady Olivieri - Breton Nightblade VR16, EP, Tamriel Hero | Donna Demnevanni - Breton Templar VR16, DC, Tamriel Hero\n\nElaine Benes - Breton Templar VR16, EP | Ray McCluck - Breton Sorcerer VR16, EP\n\nMoonshadow Demnevanni - Dunmer Dragonknight Lvl 50, EP | Jamie Stacey - Redguard Templar Lvl 50, EP\n\nCaia Cosades - Imperial Nightblade, EP"
