        "text": "Professional voice actors pride themselves on range. So, hiring a few good VAs means you can take care of many, many characters with a small cast (especially if one or two actors are a Man of a Thousand Voices).\n\nOftentimes, this results in funny situations, like two characters played by the same person having intense conversations and heated arguments with each other. The talent is in making sure the audience doesn't know it. If jokes are made about this, it's Actor Allusion.\n\nIn voice acting, the process is fairly simple, with the actor just doing a different take (although some good voice actors can do it in real-time). The actor's vocal range is the only thing that might betray commonality.\n\nThis is sometimes actually invoked on purpose, as it can make you think, \"Ohey, they're a clone? Why didn't I realize that before?\"\n\nNot to be confused with Adventure Narrator Syndrome, Sounding It Out, Thinking Out Loud or Inner Dialogue. Compare Acting for Two, which is the live-action version. Compare also Holding Both Sides of the Conversation, which is an in-universe example of this trope, where a character is pretending to hold a conversation with another non-present (or non-existent) character, in order to maintain some kind of charade. Compare also Solo Duet, which is when one singer performs both sides of a duet.\n\nExamples of Talking to Themselves include:\n\nAnime\n\n1977's Yatterman by Tatsunoko Production had the Dorombo gang consisting of Doronjo (Noriko Ohara), Boyacky (Jouji Yanami) and Tonzura (Kazuya Tatekabe). Following Yatterman is Zenderman, Rescueman, Yattodetaman, Ippatsuman, and Itadakiman, and they all featured expies of the first trio all voiced by the same trio of seiyuu. So you can imagine what happens when all of these trios would meet in the 1993 Time Bokan OVA....\n\nBleach\n\nBeing alter egos, Ichigo and Shirosaki/Hollow Ichigo, both voiced by Ichigo's seiyuu in any language, have a few conversations, though most of them are conversations with their swords.\n\nDue to being a Long Runner and having Loads and Loads of Characters, English dub actors are now voicing ABOUT FIVE popular to obscure roles each!\n\nThere is frequent doubling among the actresses playing the 31 schoolgirls from Negi's class in the North American dub of Mahou Sensei Negima It's relatively common to find two or more girls all performed by the same actress chattering among themselves:\n\nAlison Retzloff plays both of the twins Fumika and Fuuka Narutaki, who are always talking to each other.\n\nMonica Rial plays Konoka Konoe, Kazumi Asakura and Satsuki Yotsuba; in episode 16 she has to voice both sides of a \"sports announcer\" team when Konoka and Kazumi host a contest broadcast to the dorm TV set.\n\n\"Love Sensation\", featuring Laura Bailey as Ayaka Yukihiro and Laura Bailey as Evangeline McDowell.\n\nNotably averted in the original, where each girl has a different VA, quite impressive.\n\nShaman King's dub also had this with the main hero Yoh Asakura and the Big Bad Hao being voiced by the same actor, Sebastian Arcelus, which made the later interactions and fight scenes all the more impressive.\n\nBecause of its Loads and Loads of Characters, some of the voice actors in Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha StrikerS had to voice multiple characters. Luckily for the studio, it is nearly impossible to tell in many cases.\n\nChiwa Saitou voiced lead Action Girl Subaru, her antagonist counterpart Nove, and The Dragon, Quattro. Particularly impressive considering that one is a Genki Girl, one is angry all the time, and one is dripping villainy.\n\nShizuka Ito did Shari, Otto, Cinque, and Deed.\n\nKaori Mizuhashi did Yuuno, Vivio, and Sein, though this is generously averted in the main series as Yuuno was Demoted to Extra. However in the PSP game Gears of Destiny this is played straight with Yuuno and Vivio.\n\nMai Nakahara did both Teana and Laguna Granscenic, also averted.\n\nNatsuko Kuwatani did both Arf and Lutecia, though like in Kaori Mizuhashi 's case, averted.\n\nMarina Inoue did both Wendi and Erio, so this is played straight.\n\nWhile StrikerS hasn't been dubbed yet, the first season of Nanoha had a similar moment when both Momoko and Falin (both voiced by Michelle Ann Dunphy) had a scene together.\n\nThe titular characters of Ranma ½ and Inuyasha get a moment of this.\n\nYu-Gi-Oh! Most voice actors who dub Yugi Muto also voice Yami Yugi in the second anime series. Also, Megumi Ogata in the first.\n\nBoth the Japanese and English versions of Dragonball Z.\n\nChristopher Sabat is most notable in the dub, playing Vegeta, Piccolo, and Yamcha, among numerous bit characters. This led to a hilarious slip-up when Vegeta's line of \"Now what?\" in internal monologue came out in Jeice's voice instead.\n\nThe Japanese version, meanwhile, has Hiromi Tsuru (mother/daughter Bulma/Bra), Daisuke Gori (Mr. Satan/Gyuumaou, Gohan and Goku's fathers-in-law), Yuuko Minaguchi (mother/daugher Videl/Pan) and Masako Nozawa (Goku/Gohan/Goten/Bardock/Goku Jr., father/son/son/grandfather/great-great-grandson! In other words, Every male member of his family except Raditz)\n\nAlso, Josh Martin plays both Fat Buu and Kid Buu in the dub, who spend about four episodes fighting each other.\n\nSame with Kozo Shioya in the Japanese version, who voices all of Boo's forms—so in addition to the above, there's also Fat Boo and Skinny Evil Boo's brief fight.\n\nIn the Mexican dub of Dragon Ball Jes Ãºs Barrero does the voices for both Yamcha and Puar, who are always together. He only voiced them in the first episodes, though.\n\nLet's not forget how Laura Torres voices Goku, Gohan AND Goten as children. They got different male VA's for their adult selves, though. Though this may not count, since kid Goku, kid Goten and kid Gohan do not interact with one another. (Except in the video games.)\n\nThis is actually a plot point in Excel Saga: The Great Will of the Macrocosm is, in reality, just another facet of Pedro's Wife simply on the grounds that they share the same voice actress. Lampshaded with a quick title card mentioning: \"Tough; she still only gets one paycheck.\"\n\nMashiro Kazahana and Fumi Himeno share a voice actress in the original Japanese version of My-HiME, which partially underlines the otherworldliness of both characters.\n\nGundam SEED\n\nIn one scene of Gundam SEED Destiny, the two idols, Lacus Clyne and Meer Campbell face off in the ruins, resulting in their voice actress (both Japanese and English dubs -- Rie Tanaka and Chantal Strand, respectively) acting out this trope.\n\nPrior to Destiny, in Mobile Suit Gundam SEED, Houko Kuwashima performs the voices of both Natarle Badgiruel and Fllay Allster, and ends up Talking To Herself on at least one occasion towards the end of the series.\n\nRie Tanaka (see above) must have had deja vu when she voiced Chi and Freya in Chobits.\n\nEven as a guest star, Tanaka-san doesn't seem to avoid this. Consider Hell Girl ep. 12, where she voiced a shy girl and the online voice of her Internet pen-pal. (The actual person is a male.)\n\nOut of 8 characters played by Rina Satou in Hayate the Combat Butler, the Mad Scientist Shiori and Robot Eight play out this trope.\n\nYukino Satsuki as well as her dub counterpart Megan Hollingshed, as Mion and Shion Sonozaki in Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Justified—they are identical twins.\n\nThis trope appears in an episode of Zettai Karen Children. With Rie Kugimiya playing the teleporter Mio and the psychic squirrel Momotaro, she gets a few chances to talk to herself and once, Momotaro becomes Mio's Head Pet.\n\nNaruto\n\nAverted by the dub. In Shino Aburame's first appearance, he was voiced by Sam Riegel, who also voiced Zaku. Later on, they fight each other in the chunin exam, but by that point, Derek Stephen Prince had replaced Sam Riegel as the voice of Shino.\n\nSomething similar happened with Itachi, who was voiced by Might Guy's VA Skip Stellrecht in his brief first appearance, but Crispin Freeman had taken the role by the time that they ended up talking to each other about fifty episodes later.\n\nThey also invert is: Zetsu has a Split Personality, with two different halves of his body sounding different. In the original is was just one voice, but the ViZ dub gave each side a different voice one, so instead of one voice actor pretending to be two different characters at once, you have two voice actors pretending to be one character (though this was only in his first appearance).\n\nThere's also Gamakichi and Gamatatsu in the English version, who talk to each other in several scenes. They're voiced by Kakashi's VA, Dave Wittenberg, but don't ever talk to him.\n\nThe English dub of Code Geass used Michelle Ruff for several voices, including Euphemia li Britannia and the stray cat that would come to be known as Arthur, who had a conversation of sorts in episode five, when they both had their first speaking roles.\n\nMichelle Ruff also does a large portion of the incidental female characters in Zatch Bell.\n\nLucky Star:\n\nBarely averted where the same English-dub voice actress does Tsukasa and Minami. (In the original Japanese, they have different seiyuu.) Minami's in Yutaka's group though, and she's also The Quiet One.\n\nMany background characters share the same seiyuu or dub voice actor, but they don't interact.\n\nPokémon\n\nIn the 4Kids dub, there were a few examples of this, and all of them were main characters. Veronica Taylor—Ash, May, and Delia Ketchum (\"The Right Place At The Right Mime\" had May and Delia sounding very similar). Rachel Lillis—Misty and Jesse. Eric Stuart—Brock and James. Oh yeah, Ted Lewis did James for the first several episodes, didn't he? Well, he went on to do Giovanni and Tracey, though that's not an example.\n\nPUSA isn't innocent of this either. Jimmy Zoppi/Billy Beach, as well as still doing Gary, took over as James and Meowth, while Michelle Knotz voiced Jessie, May and Misty.\n\nAnd in both dubs, it's incredibly common for members of the main cast to also voice many of the Pokémon on the show, and in the case of Pokémon on their own teams, it essentially mean they are commanding themselves. Just look up who voices who; you'll find plenty of trainer/Pokémon crossovers.\n\nThis happens in the original Japanese, too. Megumi Hayashibara, for example, not only voices Musashi (Jessie) but also Fushigidane (Bulbasaur), Pidgeon (Pidgeotto), and Hikozaru (Chimchar).\n\nQuite a bit less known than her main role in the series, but Ikue Ohtani voices Manene (Mime Jr.).\n\nEmily Jenness voiced both Cynthia and Dawn.\n\nRitchie in the Indigo League ended up battling a trainer with the same voice actor.\n\nIn one of the more bizarre incidents of Talking to Themself in the English dub, Professor Ivy and all three of her triplet research assistants were voiced by Kayzie Rogers.\n\nIn the current dub, Bill Rogers is the voice of Brock, Brock's Sudowoodo and Brock's Croagunk. (His Happiny is voiced by Emily Jenness.)\n\nThe American dub of Seven of Seven only avoids this if you consider the various Nanas to be one character; if not, you have Veronica Taylor doing all seven Nanas (and two of them use her \"Ash\" and \"May\" voices!). The original Japanese version used different actresses for the different Nanas.\n\nHappens quite a bit in Slayers.\n\nIn episode 15, mother and daughter characters Cally and Paula are both voiced by Rachael Lillis (and just to make it funny, it's in her Jessie and Misty voices)\n\nIn episodes 10 and 11 of NEXT, Rachael does it again playing both Martina and Kira.\n\nLater in NEXT, we have Veronica Taylor voicing both Amelia and Auntie Aqua.\n\nIn TRY, Scottie Ray plays both Valgaav and Erulogos. They just barely invoke this trope.\n\nDigimon\n\nIn Digimon Tamers, Renamon (and evolutions), Ruki's mother, and Ruki's grandmother are all voiced by Imai Yuka. She probably had a lot of fun when said characters had lunch together in one scene.\n\nDigimon Adventure 02 also had Iori and Armadimon, who were partners and both voiced by Megumi Urawa in the Japanese version, and the dub had Veemon and Ken both voiced by Derek Stephen Prince.\n\nIn the Latin-American dub, Roberto Mendiola voiced Yukio Oikawa, Mummymon... and Malo Myotismon. And made the three sound very different. Crowning Moment of Awesome for Mr. Mendiola, indeed.\n\nFunny enough, that's exactly the case in the original Japanese as well, where Oikawa, Mummymon and BelialVamdemon are all voiced by Toshiyuki Morikawa. You really have to listen carefully to hear any resemblance between the three characters' voices.\n\nSpeaking of the Latin-American dub, Digimon Adventure's main voice cast was the same size as the group of Digidestined, which meant each main character shared a voice with a Digimon partner: Tai with Gomamon, Matt with Agumon, Sora with Gabumon, T.K. with Biyomon, Mimi with Patamon, Izzy with Palmon, and Joe with Tentomon. When Kari joined, she and Gatomon would share their voice actor with almost no differentiation, making their case the most blatant one (not to mention that, being partners, they played this trope much more frequently than the others). 02, however, recast Kari, Gatomon, and all human males besides Joe, drastically decreasing their use of this trope.\n\nIn Digimon Adventure, Jou and his older brother, Shin, are both voiced by Masami Kikuchi. In Digimon Adventure 02, Kikuchi also voiced their middle brother, Shuu, and in the CD dramas, he also voiced both their parents. In one family dinner with Gomamon, a six-person conversation is voiced by two actors. It's interesting because the characters (Jou and Shuu especially) have similar inflections, but distinct voices.\n\nSteve Blum barely avoided it in Adventure 02 (neither Flamedramon or Raidramon got to chat up BlackWarGreymon, though Poromon gets awfully close in episode 33), but in Tamers he voices three main characters that sound completely different: Guilmon, Kenta, and Yamaki!\n\nIn the Latin American dub of Digimon Savers Rolando de la Fuente voices both Thomas and Agumon, funny because they have completely different voices.\n\nDigimon Xros Wars has Daisuke Kishio voicing both Zenjirou, Beelzebumon, Blastmon and, in the sequel series, Dracmon. Then there's Bin Shimada, who voices Tactimon, Omegamon and Starmon.\n\nThen there's the fact that Miki and Megumi are both voiced by Karina Altamirano.\n\nBoth the title character of Afro Samurai and his annoying sidekick/hanger-on Ninja-Ninja are voiced by Samuel L. Jackson. Turns out it's like this in series to some degree, as Ninja is a figment of Afro's imagination.\n\nBlood+\n\nSaya's adopted little brother, Riku, and the Big Bad, her twin sister, Diva, are both voiced by Akiko Yajima in the original. So she not only talks to herself, she rapes and kills herself. Of course, poor little Riku doesn't actually do much talking during that particular interaction as opposed to whimpers of absolute terror. It also makes Diva's later transformation into Riku's appearance and using his voice all the more flawless and disturbing.\n\nIn the English dub, Kari Wahlgren voices both Saya and Diva. Crispin Freeman voices Hagi, Van Argeno, Joel Goldscmidt, and several other characters. Wally Wingert voiced Amshell, Nathan, and George.\n\nTalking to Himself is relatively rare in Brazilian dubs, especially nowadays, since there are rules about it, but there were some exceptions. In Inuyasha's dub, voice actress Leticia Quinto voices both Kagome and Kikyo. In Yu-Gi-Oh!, Marik and Odion were both voiced by voice actor Jose Parisi Jr... A season later they must've noticed that the move was not wise, as Marik's voice actor was changed.\n\nBriareos and Tereus share the same voice actor in Appleseed Ex Machina, by the virtue of having nearly identical genetic makeup.\n\nIn the Horitsuba Gakuen CD dramas for Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle and ×××HOLiC, twin brothers Fay and Yuui are both voiced by Daisuke Namikawa.\n\nAxis Powers Hetalia\n\nNamikawa also voices twins, where he uses a Fay-like voice for spacey North Italy and a deeper, louder voice for grumpy South Italy.\n\nKatsuyuki Konishi does the same trick with America and Canada, the difference being that America TALKSLIKEHE'SJUSTHADANESPRESSO and Canada is Konishi speaking as quietly as he can, eh.\n\nWhile this trope is mostly averted in the English dub, Eric Vale plays America and Canada in pretty much the exact same way.\n\nAtsushi Kousaka takes the cake by voicing the Jerkass Prussia, Meganekko Estonia, and The Philosopher Greece.\n\nRaivis/Latvia is a VERY weird case. In the CD dramas he was voiced by the female Rie Kugimiya, who voices the Token Loli Liechtenstein. In the anime, he's voiced by the male Kazutada (later \"Kokoro\") Tanaka, who also voices Poland.\n\nWhile Namikawa voiced the younger South Italy for a line in the first episode, both him and Chibitalia are now voiced by the same actress, Aki Kanada. While Chibitalia's voice is shrill and the epitome of Tastes Like Diabetes, Chibiromano's voice is rougher and more fitting of his brattier, grumpier personality.\n\nShugo Chara has lead heroine Amu and Dia, one of her Charas, voiced by Kanae Itou. Dia is essentially a part of Amu herself, but Amu's other charas have different voices.\n\nThe dub of Great Teacher Onizuka does this frequently, with Steve Blum and Wendee Lee voicing several major and minor characters.\n\nSara Werec of Soukou no Strain and Mariette, the bully who torments her, are voiced by Kawasumi Ayako in Japanese and Caitlin Glass in English. Tanaka Rie also played two characters, but they never spoke to one another.\n\nIn Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, the nine Tachikomas are all voiced by Sakiko Tamagawa, and they frequently chatter with each other. The English dub uses several different actresses.\n\nIn Ronin Warriors, Sage and Cye are both voice-acted by Michael Donovan, which is why Cye has an inexplicable sort-of-British-like accent.\n\nIn both Tenchi Muyo! and the Pretty Sammy OAVs, Sasami and Tsunami talked to each other in both the Japanese (Chisa Yokoyama) and English (Sherry Lynn) versions.\n\nIn the OAV Harukanaru Toki no Naka de 2 - Shiroki Ryuu no Miko, Ikue Ohtani voices both Fujiwara no Yukari and Fujiwara no Misono. Justified in that not only they are twins, but both are clearly expies of Fuji-hime from the original Harukanaru Toki no Naka de (also voiced by Ohtani in the first OAV and the TV anime series). The voices are slightly different, as Yukari is female and Misono is male.\n\nIn the Japanese version of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, both Alphonse Elric and the miniature panda Shao May are voiced by Rie Kugimiya.\n\nThe Swedish dub of Cyborg 009 is ridiculously blatant about this. How bad is it, then? One person does all the voice for all characters. Men, women, children, what-have-you. Any scene where any two or more characters are talking thus falls under this trope.\n\nMagnificently averted in Legend of Galactic Heroes, where only two characters in a cast of 660 share a voice actor, and they never interact.\n\nOccurs in One Piece when Jimbei and Moria, both voiced by Katsuhisa Hoki, briefly clash during the Marineford arc. Thankfully, the two have completely distinct voices, Jimbei's being deep and gruff while Moria's is high and shrill.\n\nSome combinations imitate ventriloquism. Vampire Princess Miyu has Megumi Ogata voicing both Reiha and her Creepy Doll Matsukaze. Galaxy Angel has Mika Kanai counterbalancing Vanilla's lack of speech through Nomad gushing over her.\n\nEarly European Portuguese dubs had this bad: Dragon Ball, Saint Seiya, and Sailor Moon had less than ten voice actors. They were fairly versatile, though.\n\nSailor Moon had a couple of shared seiyuu (Keiko Han as both Luna and Queen Beryl, Chiyoko Kawashima as Haruna-sensei, Shingo and Sailor Pluto), but usually the characters were too different, not allowing even for a small conversation between them. Then came the fifth season and brought in Chibi-Chibi, voiced by Usagi's seiyuu Kotono Mitsuishi—it's rather easy to pull off this trope when one of the characters has a trait of Pokémon-Speak. Worth noting that the last pair actually ends up playing the role of a Red Herring, especially with all the guesses and jokes about Chibi-Chibi being Usagi's second daughter. Had the anime followed the manga closely, the shared voice would've had a justification, as Chibi-Chibi is Sailor Cosmos, who is hinted to be a form of Usagi from a distant future. In the anime, she is a completely different entity, namely, Galaxia's own Star Seed -- meaning that in this continuity she has nothing to do with Usagi apart from wanting to encourage her to defeat Galaxia.\n\nFairy Tail has a lot of characters played by the same person in the Japanese version. For example: Jet, Macao, Horologium, and Sagittarius are voiced by Masaki Kawanabe.\n\nIn a literal example of people talking to themselves, a bunch of characters get to meet their Edolas counterparts, leading to plenty of this trope throughout the arc.\n\nSpecial mention goes to episode 98, which features Cana and Aquarius bickering with one another—both voiced by Eri Kitamura. Lucy even lampshades how similar the two are (note while Lucy makes such a statement in the manga, it's arguably more effective in the anime to compare just how similar the two sound together).\n\nAll of the five characters from Mori no Ando are voiced by Takishi Taniguchi.\n\nIn one episode of Detective Conan, Conan voices one of that week's victims, a female pop star. Many jokes are had at Conan's expense, especially considering that he can't sing for his life, but his voice actress is really a singer.\n\nTHE iDOLM@STER - Ami and Mami are both voiced by Asami Shimoda. Justified in that they're twins.\n\nSpanish group Luk Internacional is infamous for this, having only a few voice actors, yet doing many series with Loads and Loads of Characters. An example of this was the same VA, with the exact same voice, doing Crayon Shin-chan's Masao and Shinko-chan, among other minor characters. Amusingly, half of the Kochikame male characters seem to be voiced by Shin-chan's dad, recognizable because he always sounds the same.\n\nThe English dub of Let's Go Quintuplets features Chantal Strand voicing best friends, Vanessa and Bridget. Due to their friendship, this tends to happen.\n\nA sample\n\nRisky☆Safety: Rie Iwatsubo plays both of the title characters in the original Japanese. In episode 23, she sings both sides of their duet.\n\nIn the original Japanese version of A Certain Magical Index and A Certain Scientific Railgun, Sasaki Nozomi plays all of the Misaka Sisters except for the much younger Last Order. In the English dub, Brittney Karbowski plays all of the Misaka Sisters including Last Order, and the original Misaka Mikoto as well.\n\nFan Works\n\nItsJustSomeRandomGuy does all of the male voices in I'm a Marvel And I'm a DC. Mostly, he's very good at making each voice different—with the exception of the strangely gentle Captain America voice, they're all similar, but distinct. However, when characters are worked up they all sound the same.\n\nThe internet radio drama Fobbies Are Borange, at one point, had a voice actor have a knife fight with himself.\n\nEvery character in Reynaldo the Assassin is voiced by the same man. This is very noticeable at some points.\n\nLittle Kuriboh of Yu-Gi-Oh!: The Abridged Series. Also by extension any Abridged Series. LittleKuriboh gets extra points though for doing a live-action reenactment of his first episode. Basically him being taped on a street in England switching voices/characters from one second to the next.\n\nGenerally averted in the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney fandub of \"Rise From The Ashes\", with one notable exception: Phoenix and Edgeworth are the same actor. Of course, there is much shouting back-and-forth between them.\n\nA minor one in Turnabout Storm; one of the Ponyville Detention Center's guards that Phoenix Wright speaks with is voiced by the same guy that voices Phoenix.\n\nPlayed With in the shared-world story My Apartment Manager is not an Isekai Character, in that the story is in a text-based medium and thus doesn't have voice actors, but — it being a Mega Crossover with Loads and Loads of Characters — some characters had the same canon voice actor or seiyuu. This ranges from dozens of actors having played two characters each to Aya Hisakawa having voiced six-and-a-half of the characters in this story.[1] There has been at least one scene of Ami Mizuno and Skuld talking with each other, and another scene lampshades the trope by referring to two of Kana Ueda's four characters in the setting.\n\nFilms -- Animation\n\nPeter Pan\n\nIn the Disney animated version, in the scene where Mr. Smee is harassed and threatened by some of the other pirates, that's Bill Thompson having one long conversation with himself.\n\nAlso, as part of a tradition, Hans Conreid, the voice of Captain Hook, also does the voice of Mr. Darling.\n\nAnd in the film's sequel, as well as several spinoffs such as House of Mouse, Kingdom Hearts, and Epic Mickey, all of the pirate characters from this movie (with the sole exception being Captain Hook) are all now voiced by Jeff Bennett.\n\nRepeat The Ten Commandments Moses/God example below for Val Kilmer in The Prince of Egypt, due to a few last-minute changes in recording times.\n\nIn its original language, the animated film Terkel in Trouble had a pretty huge cast all voiced by one single person, including songs.\n\nIn Pocahontas, David Ogden Stiers voices both Governor Ratcliffe and his valet Wiggins.\n\nRobin Williams was the voice actor for both Ramon and Lovelace in Happy Feet.\n\nIn Mad Monster Party Allen Swift voiced all the characters with the exceptions of Baron von Frankenstein, Francesca, and the Bride of Frankenstein the Monster's Mate.\n\nIn the Brazilian dub of Beauty and the Beast, where Beast and Gaston are voiced by the same actor. But the fight between the characters is brief in dialogue (the only line the Beast says to Gaston is \"Go away\").\n\n90% of Disney's new A Christmas Carol is basically Jim Carrey showing the viewer he is still insane.\n\nLikewise the film of The Polar Express is Tom Hanks enjoying his own company and then narrating it all.\n\nEight Crazy Nights has Adam Sandler voicing Davey, Whitey, Elanor, and the helpful forest deer; the first three talk to each other a lot because Whitey and Elanor take in Davey because he has no place to live after his trailer was burned down.\n\nIn Lady and the Tramp Bill Thompson plays five characters Jock the Scottish terrier, a bulldog, Joe the Italian cook, a dachshund, and a police officer; the bulldog and the dachshund talk to each other in a few scenes.\n\nIn The Brave Little Toaster, both the Air Conditioner and the Hanging Lamp are voiced by the late Phil Hartman.\n\nAlvin and The Chipmunks\n\nOne of the older movies features the Chipettes; you can find videos on Youtube showing that if you slow down the audio, it's just one woman voicing all three.\n\nLikewise Alvin, Simon, and David are all voiced by Ross Bagdasarian Jr., and in the original records and cartoon his father Ross Bagdasarian Sr. voiced David as well as all Alvin and Simon. Theodore was voiced by Janice Karman (voice of the Chipettes).\n\nLilo and Stitch: Chris Sanders actually not only voiced Stitch, but also his Evil Counterpart Leroy as well.\n\nAn early example would be fact that in Pinocchio, Charles Judels actually voiced both Stromboli and the Coachman, both villains that became Karma Houdinis at the end of the film.\n\nLea Salonga actually does the singing voice of both Jasmine and Mulan. This is especially noticeable in several Disney Princess CDs and music videos where the two are both singing at the same time.\n\nIf you listen very closely at the very beginning of Atlantis: The Lost Empire, you can actually hear Cree Summer voicing the former Queen of Atlantis. Cree is normally the voice of Kida, who ends up becoming a queen at the end of the film, and is the only princess created by Disney to ever actually become one.\n\nLampshaded at the end of Cars where Pixar Regular John Ratzenberger, who voices Mack the semi truck in this film, is actually making comments about the fact that \"some cheap production company\" is using the same voice for the automobile versions of Hamm, P.T. Flea, and Yeti the Abominable Snowplow, respectively.\n\nIn the sequel, both Luigi's Aunt Topolino and the Queen of England are voiced by the same actress, as with the actors playing Siddeley and Leland Turbo and Fillmore and Tony Trihull.\n\nSubverted in The Little Mermaid II where Pat Carroll (the voice of Ursula) actually does the voice of Morgana, Ursula's younger and skinnier sister and the film's main antagonist, but Ursula is now long dead when the sequel took place (which explains why Morgana was the villain in the first place).\n\nBionicle 2: Legends of Metru Nui has Lhikan, Krekka (Both voiced by Michael Dobson), Onewa and Matau (both voiced by Brian Drummond). Expect a fair amount of this trope happening amongst them. Web of Shadows continues the trend with Onewa and Matau again.\n\nIn Spirited Away, the sisters Yubaba and Zeniba are voiced by the same actress both in Japanese and English. The English actress, Suzanne Pleshette, indicated that she changed the differences between the two voices; the Japanese voice of Zeniba was lower-pitched, whereas she changed her voice to be higher-pitched.\n\nJ. Pat O'Malley actually voiced both Colonel the sheepdog and Horace Badun in One Hundred and One Dalmatians and both Colonel Hathi the elephant and Buzzy the vulture in The Jungle Book.\n\nFilms -- Live-Action\n\nOver the course of the three Austin Powers movies, Mike Myers played Austin Powers, Dr. Evil, Fat Bastard, and Goldmember. So, in the scenes between Austin and any of the villains, Mike Myers was basically talking to, or fighting, himself.\n\nIn Resident Evil Extinction, Doctor Isaacs clones Milla Jovovich's character Alice. While these clones do not interact for most of the movie, in the final battle sequence between Alice and Isaacs, Alice watches a clone of herself die in her arms - therefore Jovovich was watching herself die. The movie ends with Alice and a clone standing side-by-side and looking at dozens more clones. The fourth movie, Resident Evil: Afterlife, starts with Alice and her clones bringing down an Umbrella facility, resulting in two or three Alices, all played by Jovovich, featuring in shots at the same time.\n\nBack to The Future Part II:\n\nThere's a scene in which future Marty McFly, played by Michael J. Fox, sits down at the dinner table with his son, played by Michael J. Fox, and his daughter, also played by Michael J. Fox.\n\nIn a later scene, an elderly Biff Tannen converses with a young Biff Tannen, both played by Thomas F. Wilson. One even hands a book to the other.\n\nNot forgetting the scene where 1985 Doc Brown has a conversation with his \"1955 counterpart\".\n\nIn the future cafe, time-traveling Marty and Marty junior are both crouched down behind a bar. Marty quickly grabs Marty junior's hat off the latter's head, even though they're both played by Fox.\n\nIn Dave Kevin Kline plays both the president of the U.S. (Bill Mitchell) and the head of a local employment agency who gets hired by the Secret Service to stand in for the president (Dave Kovic). At one point President Mitchell inspects Dave to make sure he'll be convincing.\n\nPerhaps in a nod to this, in Wild Wild West, Kline plays Artemis Gordon, who on multiple occasions impersonates President Ulysses S. Grant... also played by Kline. They interact quite a bit, with Gordon even trying to fool the villain into abducting HIM by decrying the real deal as a poor imitation. It, like the film, could have gone better.\n\nPeter Sellers, after honing his gift for voices on radio (see below), became famous for this on film:\n\nHe plays three characters in The Mouse That Roared, including a woman. The film lampshades this by noting they are all descendants of the founder of their very small country.\n\nTwo of his three characters in Dr. Strangelove share scenes and converse.\n\nHe plays both the hero and the prince he's impersonating in 1979's The Prisoner of Zenda.\n\nThe penultimate scene of his final film, The Fiendish Plot of Dr. Fu Manchu, has a conversation between his two characters (Fu Manchu and Nayland Smith).\n\nA scene that didn't make it to the final cut of Murder By Death had Sellers, as a Charlie Chan parody, giving driving directions to Sellers, as a Sherlock Holmes parody.\n\nThe late Alec Guinness played eight roles in the 1949 comedy Kind Hearts and Coronets. Only two at a time ever had a conversation, though.\n\nKung Pow: Enter the Fist is essentially a dubbed-over wuxia film with some new footage spliced in. Steve Oedekerk did all the dubbing himself, with a single exception (the new character \"Whoa\"). Essentially it's an entire movie of him talking to himself, with a single scene in which another performer is heard.\n\nThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\n\nLawrence Makoare has a short scene giving orders to himself, as he plays both the Witch King and Gothmog (the butt-ugly chief orc).\n\nGimli (played by John Rhys-Davies) talking to Treebeard (voiced by John Rhys-Davies).\n\nAndy Serkis, famous for portraying Gollum, does the voices for a number of orcs and Uruk-hai. Particularly, the argument at the beginning of Two Towers about whether they should eat the hobbits? All Andy Serkis, Talking to Himself.\n\nManos: The Hands of Fate was apparently so cheaply filmed, the camera could not record sound and as such, all the voices had to be dubbed in later and were done so with just four people. As Joel pointed out in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version, there is a scene where it is fairly obvious that one person is voicing two characters in conversation.\n\nMonty Python and the Holy Grail: Graham Chapman voices God and plays Arthur in just one example.\n\nMoon: Other than his robot buddy and a few barely-seen side-characters, this movie is entirely Sam Rockwell and his clone, interacting and at one point even having a fistfight.\n\nTron has David Warner playing Senior Executive VP Dillinger, the Master Control Program, and a villainous program named Sark. Sequences in both worlds have the MCP interacting with the other two. In this case, he deliberately makes no effort to change his voice for the various characters; in Tron, programs are meant to resemble their creators and are all played by the same actors; Dillinger wrote both Sark and the MCP, so all three share the same actor. Though for the MCP, Warner's voice was modulated to a lower pitch.\n\nWarner later did this trope again in the film Quest of the Delta Knights, where he played both The Obi-Wan and the Evil Overlord, including a scene where the former is arrested by the latter.\n\nEddie Murphy has done this multiple times in live-action film, notably The Nutty Professor movies and Norbit, but there are plenty more.\n\nParodied in Tropic Thunder, with Jack Black's character playing most of the cast of The Fatties.\n\nIn the 1952 version of Moulin Rouge, there are several scenes in which Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, played by José Ferrer, argues with his father, the Comte, also played by José Ferrer.\n\nVoice actor Paul Frees was known for doing voice dubbing in many live-action movies. In Spartacus, he was said to have dubbed three people having a conversation.\n\nIn the film Adaptation, Nicolas Cage appears to simultaneously play the hero, Charlie, and his twin brother (and total opposite), Donald.\n\nIn both versions of the film The Parent Trap, the two twin daughters are played by the same actress (Hayley Mills in the original; Lindsay Lohan in the 1997 version).\n\nThe Ten Commandments had Charlton Heston as Moses talking to Charlton Heston as God.\n\nIn Fanboys, Seth Rogen plays three roles; Admiral Seasholtz, Alien, and Roach. In one scene, Admiral Seasholtz and Roach get in a fist fight.\n\nIn The Spiderwick Chronicles, Freddy Highmore plays both the Grace brothers including one fistfight where they are rolling around the ground with each other.\n\nIn Paulie, Jay Mohr provides the voice of the titular parrot, as well as playing one of Paulie's owners.\n\nIn the German dub of The Expendables Thomas Danneberg who is known for dubbing Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed their brief conversation with each other.\n\nPeter Jackson's debut movie Bad Taste has one character (played by Jackson himself) torturing another character also played by him.\n\nIn Vampire in Brooklyn, Eddie Murphy as Maximillian the vampire king briefly speaks to two of his victims Preacher Pauly and Guido also played by Murphy before he kills them and assumes their forms.\n\nBrendan Fraser plays three different characters in Looney Tunes: Back in Action: D.J., himself and the voice of Taz. Towards the end of the film, he even punches himself.\n\nThe Man in the Iron Mask: Leonardo DiCaprio playing twins who are enemies.\n\nJeremy Irons played identical twins in David Cronenberg's psychological thriller Dead Ringers.\n\nIn Oh God You Devil, George Burns plays both God and Satan.\n\nStar Wars has this in the prequel films where Temuera Morrison plays Jango Fett and also provides the voices for all of the clone troopers. Justified as it is firmly established in the plot that Jango's DNA was the genetic template from which the clones were created. The clones are usually wearing full body armor, allowing them to be physically portrayed by stuntmen, though Morrison does physically portray a few of the clones himself for scenes when they are seen with their helmets removed.\n\nIn The Matrix sequels, the former Agent Smith gains the ability to copy himself. Predictably, all the copies are played by Hugo Weaving. At one point, there are over a thousand copies of Smith on-screen at the same time. The fact that Neo's fight against 200+ Smith copies in the second film ends in what is effectively a draw only reaffirms how absurdly powerful of a fighter Neo is.\n\nIn the 2005 film, King Kong, Andy Serkis plays both Kong and Lumpy, the ship's cook. There's one shot on the log sequence where Lumpy fires at Kong with a machine gun...meaning that Andy Serkis is shooting at himself.\n\nLive-Action TV\n\nThis happens in Sanctuary any time Bigfoot and John Druitt/Jack the Ripper share a scene. Both characters are physically portrayed by actor Chris Heyerdahl, although when he is Bigfoot, he has quite a bit of make-up and prostheses on.\n\nGene Roddenberry's Andromeda: there was a three-way conversation between the ship's computer, a hologram generated by the ship's computer, and the robotic version of the ship's computer (all played by the same actress, of course).\n\nIn a segment of Beakman's World, Mark Ritts as Harry Pitts converses with Mark Ritts as Lester the Rat.\n\nBeetleborgs did this in the episode \"Buggin Out\" where Flabber slowly turns into Kombat Gnat. Kombat Gnat's provided by Billy Forester who played Flabber.\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nOne episode was dubbed into French with one single male actor and one single female actor. They didn't even try to disguise it.\n\nThe episode \"Doppelgangland\" had Willow meeting her Lesbian Vampire counterpart from an alternate universe. This resulted in Alyson Hannigan not only talking to herself, but licking her own neck.\n\nSeveral episodes had Buffy interacting with a robotic duplicate of herself.\n\nSeason seven's Big Bad was The First Evil, who can only take the form of people who have died, which leads to Buffy and Spike both having conversations with \"themselves\".\n\nOddly enough, the season five episode where Xander is split into two people is a subversion. The actor, Nicholas Brendon, has an identical twin, Kelly Donovan. Their conversations and interactions are done completely without special effects.\n\nIn the Angel episode \"Orpheus\", Angelus and Faith share a dream/vision where they watch Angel's tormented past. At the end, the memory of Angel becomes an active participant and physically fights Angelus (both played by David Boreanaz).\n\nNicholas Briggs voices both the Daleks and the Cybermen in Doctor Who, leading to a rather memorable scene in the second-season finale \"Doomsday\". (This also means any conversation between Daleks is Briggs Talking to Himself.)\n\nIn season 2 of the new Doctor Who, the Doctor, Rose, and Mickey accidentally travel to an alternate universe and meet up with Mickey's alternate self and his gang. In season 1, there was a running gag where the Doctor would call him Ricky instead of Mickey, and while the Doctor no longer gave him the name in season 2, Mickey's alternate self was called Ricky in reference to this.\n\nIn a minisode of the new Doctor Who, the Tardis materialises inside itself, meaning that when a character left the Tardis, they re-entered the Tardis. This resulted in actors Matt Smith, Karen Gillan and Arthur Darvill all interacting with themselves, including Gillan flirting with herself.\n\nIn the original Doctor Who, the 3rd Doctor (Jon Pertwee) has a brief conversation with himself (his attempt to get his TARDIS working causes his and his companion's future selves to appear for a minute). Tom Baker had conversations with himself in \"The Android Invasion\" and \"Meglos\" (The Doctor and an evil doppelganger, in both). The first Romana had a short conversation with her Identical Stranger. The 5th Doctor had a conversation with Omega, who had copied his body, but it may not count, as it was Peter Davison's body with Omega's previous voice.\n\nIn The Sarah Connor Chronicles episode \"Allison From Palmdale,\" Cameron has several lengthy and creepy conversations with Allison, the girl who her physical appearance was copied from, and at the end breaks Allison's neck. Naturally, both of them are played by Summer Glau.\n\nChuck (ventriloquist) and Bob (dummy) regularly had conversations with each other on Soap. (Also see below)\n\nStar Trek: The Next Generation\n\nMajel Barrett once played both sides of an argument between Lwaxana Troi and the Enterprise's computer.\n\nIn \"Brothers\", there's a scene between Data, Lore and Dr. Soong—all played by Brent Spiner.\n\nAnother episode has younger Riker circling older Riker, in a seconds long sequence which kept director Levar Burton up for days trying to work out.\n\nNot to mention \"Second Chances\" where there are two same aged Rikers.\n\nStargate SG-1\n\nMichael Shanks plays both Daniel Jackson and the Asgard character Thor. (Asgard look so different from humans that they get only voice actors, although this is a live-action show). Teryl Rothery, who plays Janet Fraiser, also does the voice of an Asgard named Heindall, but these two characters never interact or even meet.\n\nIn the film Stargate: Continuum, Ben Browder played both Cameron Mitchell and Mitchell's unnamed grandpa.\n\nAnother Michael Shanks example—in the episode \"Holiday\", he plays both Daniel and an alien character, Ma'chello, under heavy makeup. Ma'chello uses a machine to swap bodies with Daniel, leading to an interesting scene where Michael Shanks, as Ma'chello is Daniel's body, argues with Michael Shanks, as Daniel in Ma'chello's body!\n\nIn one episode of Mork and Mindy, Mork met Robin Williams and discussed clothing tastes.\n\nIn-universe example: On one episode of Remember WENN, after Jeff Singer leaves and before Scott Sherwood is hired as an actor, Mackie Bloom is forced to voice every single character himself, until he forgets what his own voice sounds like.\n\nSubverted in The 7:30 Report, an Australian current affairs programme that has a weekly political satire sketch of a fake current affairs interview, starring Bryan Dawe (usually the interviewer) and John Clarke (the interviewee—a different character each episode but usually portraying an actual person. Often it's a politician). On rare occasions there will be multiple interviewees, with John playing each one. The most confusing aspect of it is that John makes no attempt to imitate who he's impersonating (i.e. they all look and sound like John Clarke in real life, as well as having a habit for dodging Bryan's questions) so at times it looks as though he really is talking to himself.\n\nOn Mystery Science Theater 3000, at least one of the \"Mads\" played one of the 'bots at all times. (Dr. Forrester/Crow, Dr. Erhardt/Tom Servo, Brain Guy/Crow, Bobo/Tom Servo)\n\nIn Mortal Kombat Conquest Jeffrey Meek played both Raiden and Shao Kahn, who shared a number of onscreen conversations.\n\nPhoebe and her Evil Twin Ursula on Friends, (both played by Lisa Kudrow) sometimes interacted with each other.\n\nAn Australian talkshow had a pre-recorded interview with Rolf Harris. However, apparently when Harris arrives the host wasn't there, so Rolf interviewed himself.\n\nOn Hogan's Heroes, Richard Dawson provided the voice of their London contact over the shortwave. In at least one instance, his character Newkirk was the one receiving the message.\n\nSmallville\n\nWhen Bizarro appeared, Tom Welling was both the hero and villain.\n\nThat wasn't the first time that Tom Welling fought himself on the show. He did so as early as Season 1 in an episode when the Freak of the Week was a shapeshifter who disguised herself as Clark during her fight against the real Clark.\n\nIt also occurred when Clark's Mirror Universe counterpart, Ultraman, showed up in Season 10.\n\nSmallville even had one Freak of the Week whose meteor ability was to literally clone himself. Predictably, the original guy and the clone appeared on-screen together being played by the same actor.\n\nIn The Peter Serafinowicz Show, the titular comedian plays all four of The Beatles in the same sketch. It's quite impressive.\n\nIn on episode of Frasier, the title character tricks Niles into doing this for a radio play.\n\nSupernatural\n\nIn the teaser for the episode \"Caged Heat,\" Mark Sheppard plays both Crowley and the Alpha Skinwalker. You can tell that Sheppard has a lot of fun with this.\n\nJensen got to play two Deans in \"Dream a Little Dream of Me\" and \"The End\". The former was a demonic version of Dean, the latter Dean's future self in a Crapsack World.\n\nJared Padalecki plays three different versions of Sam in \"The Man Who Knew Too Much\", and while only two of them are ever onscreen at the same time, it still veers into this trope a couple of times.\n\nThe nonexistent budget ensured that PJ Katie from PJ Katies Farm did the voices for every character on the show.\n\nIn multiple episodes of Fringe, Anna Torv plays two version of Olivia Dunham—one from \"our\" universe and one from another universe. While the two characters are usually seen separately, in the season two finale \"Over There\", our Olivia and alternate Olivia engage in hand-on-hand combat—meaning Torv is fighting herself.\n\nHappens in any episode of Farscape in which Crais (played by Lani Tupu) and Pilot (voiced by Lani Tupu) interact.\n\nPeter Tuddenham did the voices of the various talking computers in Blakes Seven. On one occasion Slave and Orac get into a brief tiff; Tuddenham was asked if he wanted to record one of the voices first but he did them both live.\n\nUnfortunately, Slave was trying to warn the crew about an impending attack on the ship. Way to go, Orac.\n\nIn Mister Rogers Neighborhood, Fred Rogers voiced several characters in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe puppet segments.\n\nMusic\n\nA rare example tends to happen in Ayreon concerts, where multiple vocalists were used to represent different characters before, they have a drastically reduced cast. This has led to some amusing moments where you can hear a Me from The Human Equation asking AND answering his own questions.\n\nAn acoustic version of \"Castle Hall\" features a single singer playing both the Barbarian being horrified by the ghost of the women he raped and the Knight calling on Merlin, Excalibur and the Knight of the Round table to help him.\n\nE=MC2 which originally featured 5 fish people aliens arguing over whether to save Earth from a course of destruction they set it on; however, the acoustic version features Irene Jansen have a near breakdown arguing with herself over the same query.\n\nIn 2006, Aled Jones made a recording alongside his boy treble self with a new rendition of \"Walking in the Air.\"\n\nThe lyrics to Thank You Pain by The Agonist consist of a back-and-forth between a judge and a defendant. Both are voiced by the same singer, who uses growling vocals for the judge's lines and clean vocals for the defendant.\n\nAlissa has admitted that she considers singing this song live Difficult but Awesome.\n\nRay Stevens is fond of voicing multiple characters in the same song:\n\nIn \"The Dooright Family,\" he voices all five members of a fictional gospel family band.\n\nIn \"Dudley Doright of the Highway Patrol,\" he has a conversation between himself and the title character, also voiced by himself.\n\nIn \"Theme from The Monkees,\" he voices an entire Austrian singing troupe and a narrator.\n\nIn \"Gitarzan,\" he voices the title character, Jane and the monkey, all of whom sing together at the end.\n\nIn \"Moonlight Special,\" he voices the host of a fictional rock & roll show and all the \"acts\" on it. This includes a hilarious Lampshade Hanging in which a lead singer questions why the backing vocalists keep repeating her.\n\nIn \"The Streak\", he's both the reporter, and the guy being interviewed.\n\nBrad Paisley's \"Born on Christmas Day\" includes elements from a recording that he made at age 13. On the final chorus, he and his 13-year-old self sing together.\n\nJeff Foxworthy has a conversation with himself in \"The Redneck 12 Days of Christmas:\"\n\nIn Pink Floyd's The Wall, the last full-length song, \"The Trial\", has lots of characters, all voiced by Roger Waters. And it's awesome.\n\nBryn Terfel's \"Bad Boys\" album [dead link] includes a scene from Don Giovanni that features the titular character, his manservant and his ghostly nemesis. All three parts are within Terfel's vocal range, and he duly performs all of them, singing to himself in triplicate.\n\nPostive K's \"I Got A Man\" consists of a rapped conversation where a man tries to pick up a woman and she very bluntly rejects him. Both parts are played by Positive K himself, with added pitch-shifting to make the woman's voice more convincing. For the music video, they had an actress lip-syncing the woman's lines.\n\n\"Keep Punching Joe\" by Daniel Johnston begins with \"someone\" introducing Daniel Johnston, followed by Daniel thanking the person and then he starts singing. Both voices clearly belong to the same person.\n\nIn the title track of Rush's 2112, Geddy Lee voices both the unnamed protagonist and the priest in an argument about music.\n\nA Mitch Benn song has him sing both halves of a duet between Barry Gibb (In the Style Of The Bee Gees) and Johnny Cash's house (in the style of Cash).\n\nIn the Dream Theater song \"The Case That Stumped Them All\", vocalist James LaBrie portrays a baffled doctor and a female nurse who trade vocal lines during the verses. The result are...slightly disturbing. Their concept album Scenes from a Memory could also be an example as he plays most of the characters when singing, but he doesn't try to do special voices for them.\n\nFrequently heard in recordings made by Filk singer Tom Smith where he multi-tracks himself, such as in his song \"Talk Like a Pirate Day\".\n\nPuppet Shows\n\nAverted more often than not in The Muppet Show, Sesame Street, and other productions featuring The Muppets. While the operators all perform multiple characters, they must operate each Muppet as well as do the voice, making it virtually impossible for one performer to handle two characters at once. So we seldom, for instance, see Fozzie and Miss Piggy (both performed by Frank Oz) interact. When they do interact, the standard method is to pre-record the character that is easier to handle. This is why, for example, it was Floyd Pepper (performed by Jerry Nelson) who represented the Electric Mayhem band in backstage discussions with Kermit the Frog (performed by Jim Henson), even though Dr. Teeth (also performed by Henson) was actually the band's leader.\n\nThe Muppet feature films, on the other hand, enabled more of this to occur. The Muppet Movie, for instance, features a duet with Kermit the Frog and Rowlf the Dog, both voiced at the time by Jim Henson.\n\nBig Bird and Oscar are both voiced by Carroll Spinney; in scenes with the two of them together Spinney would pre-record Oscar's dialog and someone else would operate him, since he's easier to handle than full-body Muppet Big Bird. This has changed a little as the performers have grown older, retired, and/or had health issues. Carroll Spinney still operates Big Bird; they cast a replacement, Matt Vogel, only when Spinney is unavailable. Jerry Nelson, on the other hand, now handles only the voices of his characters, not the puppetry.\n\nOne impressive bit by ventriloquist Jeff Dunham involves him getting in a rapid-fire three-way argument with two of his characters. In another routine, the same two characters start having a conversation in presumably fluent Spanish, and Jeff remarks that he feels left out because \"I don't speak Spanish!\" No wonder one of his shows is called Arguing with Myself.\n\nTechnically this trope applies to all ventriloquists, as the traditional format is of them having a conversation with the dummy. The fact that Dunham can do this with multiple dolls at the same time just shows what a master of the technique he is.\n\nIn one of his early skits, his puppet, Peanut, has his own puppet. It involved Dunham, Peanut, Peanut's puppet Mini-Jeff, Jose Jalapeno (On A Stick), and the worm at the bottom of a bottle of wine. You can see it for yourself here.\n\nThat skit seems to have returned in his latest installment, Controlled Chaos. Only it's a conversation/argument between Jeff, Peanut, Mini-Jeff and Mini-Peanut (a hand puppet of Peanut on Jeff's other hand).\n\nPeanut also does some epic lampshading of ventriloquism in Spark of Insanity as he tells Jeff, \"We cannot talk at the same time!\"\n\nBritish kids' show Rainbow features George and Zippy, a classic Odd Couple who are permanently arguing with each other, interrupting and talking over each other—despite being both products of the same actor who is not only Talking To Himself but doing it live.\n\nThe 60s British marionette science fiction show Space Patrol, a.k.a. Planet Patrol in the US, has a very small voice cast who often play multiple roles, and according to one interview they would simply switch voices while recording their lines, rather than relying on editing.\n\nRadio\n\nAlso occurs in radio shows. Surreal 1950s BBC comedy The Goon Show often lampshaded this.\n\nAnother example from the Goon Show episode 'The Histories of Pliny the Elder'.\n\nMoriarty: Why don't you stop him Julius Caesar? (Ceasar uses Grytpype's voice, played by Sellers)\n\nBloodnok: How can I when I'm playing the part of Bloodnok?\n\nSpike Milligan was absent for one episode and Sellers performed his parts as well! (His Eccles in particular was flawless.) But just wait until you hear Sellers' albums...\n\nBecomes even more amazing when you realise that most of the roles were done by the three main cast members and Harry Secombe only played one of them (main character Neddie) most of the time. Sellers was doing well over 90% of the one-off characters.\n\nFormer Goon Michael Bentine also did a radio sketch show where he performed all the voices, but that was done by editing. The Goons did it live on stage.\n\nAdventures in Odyssey\n\nThis trope has been known to occur quite a bit, especially when farmer Tom Riley and shady businessman Bart Rathbone were running against each other for mayor. Ed Walker, who played both, switched voices in real time, meaning he was literally debating with himself.\n\nThis also happens when Dr. Regis Blackgaard runs his brother Edwin out of town.\n\n...and whenever Eugene Meltsner converses with Harlowe Doyle, P.I.\n\nWhen Kevin Clash (Elmo's puppeteer and voice) was on Wait Wait Don't Tell Me, he managed to interrupt himself with Elmo's voice. It really creeped the host out, especially when it sounded like they were speaking at almost the same time.\n\nThe Phil Hendrie Show: All the guests on his spoof talk radio show.\n\nIn the entirely improvised sitcom The Masterson Inheritance, each performer would inevitably end up playing several different roles, most of them made up on the spot and many with ridiculous voices. Naturally, they often ended up talking to each other. Paul Merton ended up doing this pretty much ever episode (especially when the others deliberately arranged things so he'd have to). He'd sometimes wriggle out of it by having one character tell the other(s) to shut up while he spoke, or just have whichever one had the most annoying accent drop dead from a heart attack.\n\nI'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue\n\nIn the spin-off You'll Have Had Your Tea?: The Doings of Hamish and Dougal, all the characters (except in the Hogmanay Special) are voiced by four actors, only one of whom is female. This is frequently Lampshaded.\n\nIn another episode, the Laird (played by Jeremy Hardy) had an argument with his mother (played by Jeremy Hardy with a silly high-pitched voice) which ended \"Now take me home before anyone realises you're doing both voices\". Not being a show to let a joke rest, the Laird's mother later had a party with Mrs Dougal, Mrs Hamish, and Grandpa Naughtie.\n\nSpoofed repeatedly on BBC comedy The Burkiss Way, which on several occasions features conversations between characters with exactly the same voice. Usually Lampshaded in the most blatant way possible, and without the performer even pausing between lines.\n\nIn one episode, Jo Kendall uses the same voice for two different characters, simply by introducing every other sentence with \"in a different voice\".\n\nI'm Sorry Ill Read That Again\n\nIn one spectacular example, John Cleese is required to have one of his characters eaten by another. There are almost twenty seconds of discussion whether it's physically possible, before he is told to get on with it.\n\nIn another episode, Tim Brooke-Taylor, playing Tim Brown-Windsor, Lady Constance and Lady Constance's sister Flossie, genuinely gets mixed up when the three of them have to share a scene. Naturally, they Throw It In.\n\nIn yet another episode, two of Graeme Garden's characters have an argument together. The scene is introduced by John Cleese explaining that it isn't going to be very funny, but Graeme would like a round of applause anyway to imply to the home audience that it's very difficult, even though (according to Cleese) it isn't.\n\nAnd in the end of that season, Graeme takes over the serial—and is, at that point, playing the main hero (Professor Prune), the main villain (Fetish), and the narrator. Naturally, chaos ensues.\n\nThe Walton & Johnson show has, alongside John Walton and Steve Johnson, three characters voiced by Johnson: Billy Ed Hatfield, a redneck Army veteran, Mister Kenneth, a gay hairdresser, and Mr. Eaux, a militant black nationalist from New Orleans. Needless to say, all three characters frequently get into fights with one another and with callers.\n\nThe Big Finish Doctor Who audio drama Caerdroia has Paul McGann do this, as the Doctor has developed a Literal Split Personality. Despite the fact one man is playing three of the same character with only minor variations, it only gets confusing once or twice. It's partially done by having the moody, snarky one have a lower and more monotone and deadpan voice than the Doctor ordinarily has, and the cheerful, quirky, scatterbrained one have a higher voice and speak more quickly. Not only does he talk to himself, he (rather unsurprisingly) argues with himself.\n\nEver since Katy Manning started playing Paul Magrs's dotty Time Lady Iris Wildthyme for Big Finish, it was inevitable that eventually there'd be a story where Iris met Jo Grant. It happens in the Companion Chronicles audio Find And Replace.\n\nIn the Haruhi Suzumiya Sound Around radio drama a musical monster causes Kyon, Itsuki, Yuki and Mikuru to lose their voices and speak with Haruhi's voice instead. Thus we have Aya Hirano talking to herself as four different characters (although with Mikuru it is almost impossible to tell the difference). It gets even more confusing when Itsuki does an impression of Haruhi.\n\nAs a ventriloquist, Edgar Bergen naturally did this a lot on The Chase and Sanborn Hour.\n\nOften happened to Bob and Ray, as a consequence of playing both hosts and (often multiple) guests on their various shows, assisted by their uncanny timing and familiarity with each other. The effect is most spectacular when baritone Ray and his falsetto character Mary McGoon hold rapid-fire discussions—often with Ray's other character Webley Webster chiming in—with Bob and two or more of his characters.\n\nOne That Mitchell and Webb Sound sketch features a radio debate on the death penalty between two men both played by Robert Webb, who sound exactly the same. It degenerates into chaos as the moderator, played by David Mitchell, desperately tries to find a way to tell the two men apart. At the very end, Webb starts playing the moderator as well.\n\nOn the sketch show Hello Cheeky, there were four actors, one of whom generally only played one role. They mostly managed to avoid talking to themselves, except for a few sequences in which Tim Brooke-Taylor plays a woman and a man in the same scene, at one point even muttering \"You do feel a fool talking to yourself...\"\n\nIn one episode, a sketch is completely derailed as the cast change their roles around in an attempt to avoid talking to themselves.\n\nDone literally by Brian Phelps of the Mark & Brian Radio Program. One sketch one the show had him portraying George W. Bush and Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger speaking to one another. Brian also challenges his co-host Mark to try and trip him up at the end of the sketch, which he does by rapid firing questions to Arnold and then Bush.\n\nRecorded and Stand Up Comedy\n\nEddie Izzard does this on-stage, as would most stand-up comedians who do voices. However, he regularly lampshades it. Also, the only voices he can really do are Sean Connery and James Mason. Which he lampshades too.\n\nJeff Dunham is an exemplary showcase of this trope, what with being a ventriloquist and all. Epically lampshaded by Peanut in Spark of Insanity, after Peanut jokes about the pronunciation of Jeff's name:\n\nMichael Mcintyre has been known to perform conversations with himself on stage, often adopting different voices while doing so.\n\nTabletop Games\n\nIn any given roleplaying game, the Game Master will, by necessity, be voicing all the NPCs. More talented or imaginative Game Masters will even give them distinct voices (which can get damn funny at times).\n\nSome campaigns have two Game Masters, averting the trope. On the other hand, in some games (such as Ars Magica) even the players will have several characters.\n\nIn one hilarious game of Dungeons & Dragons, one player simultaneously played an elf and a dwarf who were Vitriolic Best Buds on the best of days. He used hand signals to indicate who was who whenever they got in an argument (again).\n\nTheater\n\nSimilarly to the example with The Muppet Show and Sesame Street, Avenue Q features the same actress playing Kate Monster and Lucy the Slut, the same actor as Princeton and Rod, and the same actor as Nicky and Trekkie Monster. The conversations with themselves are particularly impressive because all the puppeteers are onstage and usually one of the puppets is being controlled by a completely different puppeteer who had to match the mouth movements to the other actor's words. Also, they sing too. Possibly lampshaded when you notice that the voice of Nicky/Trekkie Monster has the only puppets that require two people to work (can be used by one, but not as effective).\n\nCharles Ludlam's The Mystery of Irma Vep heavily invokes this trope (and occasionally lampshades it in the script). It's a show with four male characters and four female characters, with two male actors playing all of the roles. In particular, the actor playing Nicodemus and Enid not only holds conversations with himself during costume changes, but also plays out a scene involving playing the monster that's mauling Nicodemus off-stage.\n\nThis was commonly done in-story in Shakespeare's plays by his \"clown\" characters (played by comic actors who were presumably able to do multiple voices):\n\nFeste in Twelfth Night stands outside the dark cell in which Malvolio is imprisoned and enacts a conversation between himself (Feste) and \"Sir Topas\", the minister supposedly sent to \"cure\" Malvolio of his insanity. Malvolio falls for it, of course.\n\nLaunce in Two Gentlemen of Verona performs the scene of his departure from home for the audience, using a pair of shoes as his parents, his staff as his sister, his dog as himself, and himself as his dog.\n\nLauncelot Gobbo in The Merchant of Venice parodies the conventions of a medieval morality play by playing himself, his conscience, and the \"fiend\" who wants him to run away from his master.\n\nIn A Midsummer Night's Dream Nick Bottom begs to play all the parts in the play-within-a-play, and acts out a scene between Star-Crossed Lovers Pyramus and Thisbe before roaring to represent \"the lion.\"\n\nIn The Wizard of Oz On Ice, Bobby McFerrin voiced all of the characters except for Dorothy. (Yep, even Toto.) In the TV special, he also voices Dorothy.\n\nVideo Games\n\nIn Half Life 2, there is only one voice actor each for all male and female rebels. This means any time two same-sex rebels have a conversation, it's with the same voice.\n\nThe Italian version of Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc featured Dario Oppido who voices: Rayman, Globox as well as Reflux, resulting in quite some moments of him actually talking to himself.\n\nThe English version of Beyond Good and Evil had far fewer voice actors than any other version, resulting in some interesting conversations. Most of the side female characters are quite clearly the same woman, especially obviously in the case of The Faceless, the Science Center woman, and the governor. Even funnier, the Elite Mooks, the Alpha Sections, obviously have the same VA as Playful Hacker Nino, leading one to wonder just whose side that guy is on.\n\nConker's Bad Fur Day has dozens of characters with major speaking roles, yet only three people do the voices for all of them, and one of those three does only one voice. Chris Seavor actually voiced over forty characters; every single male part except the Great Mighty Poo. Now that's some incredible range.\n\nDisgaea: Hour of Darkness has one man playing General Carter, Thursday, and Archangel Vulcanus. While Thursday never has any lines with either of the other characters, both Vulcanus and Carter get a whole scene together.\n\nDisgaea 2: Cursed Memories has Rozalin and Taro voiced by the same woman in English. This leads to the disturbing fact that the Cute Shotaro Boy has an unhealthy obsession with himself. In the original audio, Yukari Tamura provides the voice of Rozalin, and Hiro Shimono voices Taro.\n\nDisgaea 3: Absence of Justice has Salvatore and the returning Etna both voiced by Michelle Ruff.\n\nIn The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, one actor performs every character of the same race and gender, sometimes doubling up, and they rarely try to change it up by character. If you hear a female wood elf and a female dunmer talking to one another, they sound like the exact same person, sometimes repeating bits of the same conversation back and forth. The exception is the characters voiced by Patrick Stewart, Terence Stamp and Sean Bean. This is mainly due to the rumour function, which is randomised. If the actors gave each character distinct vocal traits, they'd have to re-record the rumours hundreds of times more. This is exemplified with the beggar in Bruma who actually does sound weak and decrepit, but switches to upbeat and healthy as soon as you ask about the weather.\n\nThe page quote is from Zero Punctuation's review of Oblivion. Yahtzee's biggest gripe with the game was this, claiming that it completely yanked the immersion of the game out, as you're having a fabulous adventure of some sort, only to hear one of the NPCs' stale voice acting, sounding exactly like a guy you just killed or bought stuff from, and you're suddenly back in your room, staring at a screen and listening to shitty voice acting.\n\nMany of the voice actors in the Fatal Frame series play multiple roles as attacking spirits. In Fatal Frame 2 and Fatal Frame 3, this is done deliberately, doubling several seiyuu as both major protagonists and major antagonists, to blur identities as the living characters are drawn deeper into the ghosts' stories.\n\nFallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas have the same problem, running on the same engine (and with Oblivion and Fallout 3 being made by the same company). Liam Neeson and Matthew Perry both voice-act one character each, and each of the companions have their own unique voice (except Charon, who has the generic \"male ghoul\" voice, though Raul does not). Pretty much everyone else boils down to the same handful of voices. It's most jarring with Ghouls, who, with a handful of exceptions (Raul, Desmond...and I think that's it) have 1 male voice and 1 female voice per game.\n\nFallout: New Vegas seems to introduce the player to a world inhabited by clones of Gregory Alan Williams.\n\nIn Sam and Max Freelance Police Season One and Two, Roger L. Jackson voices Abe Lincoln, Grandpa Stinky, the Mariachis, Satan and \"every deep voice\" according to the commentaries.\n\nSpeaking of Jackson, American McGee's Grimm. Just American McGee's Grimm. And yes, that includes the female voices too.\n\nWilliam Kasten also voices Max, Jurgen and the Mariachi spaceship's computer AI, in four different styles (Politically Correct, Abusive, Suggestive and Passive-Aggressive)\n\nThen there's Jared Emerson-Johnson, who voices three of the C.O.P.S. They're never seen apart, so Talking to Himself occurs very frequently.\n\nJoey Camen voices Bosco, Jimmy Two Teeth and his family.\n\nAnd in the E3 2006 trailer, David Knowlin noticeably voiced both Sam and Max.\n\nA particularly terrifying example of this trope takes place in the first level of Knights of the Old Republic II, as HK-50 relates the Maintenance Officer's agonized last words.\n\nCharles Martinet does the voice of not only both of the Mario Bros., but their evil counterparts Wario and Waluigi, their baby versions, and Toadsworth. And the Boos all appear to be voiced by the same actor who plays Bowser. Do you know how you actually figure this out? If you play a Boo's laughter very slowly, it'll actually sound like Bowser, and vice versa!\n\nIn Xenosaga, both Albedo and Gaignun are voiced by Crispin Freeman. Their voices do sound somewhat similar, but they are 'brothers', so this is acceptable. However, the dramatic, split-screen, mental discussion the two hold with one another in Episode II loses some of its drama when one remembers its just one man talking to himself. This was most likely a deliberate casting choice to reflect their origins, since in the Japanese version, Yamadera Kouichi is also double-cast for the same roles.\n\nTales of the Abyss\n\nLuke and Asch are voiced by the same voice actor and reasonably so, as one is a clone of the other. Thus, a climactic scene near the end of the game where their enmity plays out is possibly more impressive when you realize it's just one guy screaming at himself.\n\nIn the same vein, Fon Master Ion and Sync the Tempest are also voiced by the same person, as they are both clones of the same person. This is actually used by Sync to deal a very low blow towards Anise at one point.\n\nSuper Robot Wars has a lot of fun with this one, whether it's actually done or merely implied; many characters involved in this Massive Multiplayer Crossover are played by the same voice actors in their respective Humongous Mecha Anime.\n\nThe most extreme one is in Super Robot Wars Z in one save-quit dialogue, whereas Asuham Boone and Gym Ghingham had a contest of who is the larger ham by shouting at each other, while Neo Roanoke nonchalantly comments on it. The catch? They're all voiced by Takehito Koyasu.\n\nIt gets better. In one of the Z2 game over screens, Ozma, Johann, and Kamina talk with one another about how they're all stuck with a little sibling. They're all voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi. Also, Amuro gets to fight Ribbons.\n\nF/Final the first fully voiced SRW game probably has the most of this. To save money perhaps nearly all the original and Masou Kishin characters are voiced by VAs that all had another role in game and usually a main character one as well. (Hikaru Midorikawa for example is Heero Yui, and also was cast as Masaki Ando) Although most of these characters haven't appeared since, a few of them have and nearly eclipse the other characters in popularity. Masaki for example became one of Midorikawa's favorite roles, despite initially only getting the part to save time while he was recording Heero.\n\nKingdom Hearts\n\nThe German version of faces the problem that most male heroes in Disney movies are voiced by the same person in German, resulting in Aladdin, Prince Eric, and Hercules sharing the same voice. Luckily, they never really met in the game.\n\nAnd in the English version, there's Corey Burton in both games with five to seven roles. Thankfully, they still never meet.\n\nIn the Japanese version we have Kôichi Yamadera, who voices Donald Duck, Genie, Sebastian, Beast, Mushu, and Stitch.\n\nDon't forget the most literal example of this in RE:Chain of Memories, with David Gallagher playing both Riku and the Riku Replica.\n\nIn the original Warriors Orochi, when Zhuge Liang sniggers at Zhao Yun's inability to comprehend why The Strategist is working under Orochi, it's the same seiyu (Masaya Onosaka) acting out this trope. Also, since the game has a character switching system, it's possible to hear the same seiyuu doing the \"swop-in\" lines for two very different characters. By hearing them, you won't believe that Date Masamune and Fuma Kotaro are done by the same person.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog and his Evil Counterpart Shadow the Hedgehog share the same voice actor (Jason Griffith) as of the latter's spin-off game. In Sonic Shuffle, Sonic and Knuckles are both voiced by Ryan Drummond, and Sonic Heroes has the same actor for Big and Omega. Sonic Riders contains Sonic and Shadow, plus the new character of Jet, also voiced by Jason Griffith. Although Shadow doesn't appear in the game's storyline, Sonic and Jet are rivals.\n\nBefore the 4Kids voice actors took over, Sonic's voice actor Ryan Drummond also voiced Metal Sonic in Sonic Heroes.\n\nAfter they changed voices AGAIN, now in Sonic Free Riders, both Tails and Wave the Swallow are played by Kate Higgins, both Storm the Albatross and Knuckles are played by Travis Willingham, and both Omochao and Blaze are voiced by Laura Bailey.\n\nIn Sonic Adventure 2 and Sonic Heroes, Omochao shared its voice actress with Rouge.\n\nThe Thief series, at least at first, only had a handful of voice actors, which resulted in Stephen Russell playing Garrett (the Deadpan Snarker Anti-Hero), Benny (the resident Butt Monkey and Running Gag), Father Karras (a Big Bad) and many other extras and bit parts, all of which are very different characters with distinct voices (fortunately). At one point, he complains about himself prattling on.\n\nChris Metzen, best known as a story-writer, also voice acts two characters in Warcraft III. These characters, Thrall and Rexxar, happen to get a lot of dialogue in the Expansion Pack's Orc campaign.\n\nPsychonauts. Andre Sogliuzzo voices both halves of a split personality, Fred/Napoleon Bonaparte, who argues with himself. Napoleon has an outrageous French accent. Fred sounds like a classic slacker.\n\nIn Star Wars: The Force Unleashed, Sam Witwer (somehow) voices both Villain Protagonist Galen Marek and Emperor Palpatine. In the final battle, he ends up having rather lengthy conversations with himself, switching back and forth between what is apparently his natural voice (Galen) and an excellent impression of Ian McDiarmid's Large Ham-ish Palpatine voice.\n\nIn a bit of Team Fortress 2 irony, the Pyro and the Spy share a voice actor, as do the Heavy and the Demoman. Both pairs have little to no dialogue that directly refers to the other, save for the Pyro calling \"Spy!\" and the Spy's Pyro-domination quotes since the Sniper vs. Spy update, but many fledgling Spies tend to be revealed as moles by enemy Pyros, and Heavies tend to be perfect prey for a Demoman's sticky bomb trap.\n\nIn Gears of War, John Dimaggio, aka Bender, voices both Marcus and Hoffman, which is amusing when the two of them lock horns.\n\nFinal Fantasy X\n\nJohn Dimaggio also voices both Wakka and Kimahri, although Kimahri talks so little that it doesn't matter all that much. Still, the guy's got amazing vocal range.\n\nA minor example in Final Fantasy X, notable only for the \"oh man, what are the odds\" factor: The same actress voices Seymour's mother and his wife in English—and Seymour canonically has one hell of an Oedipus Complex.\n\nThere is a scene in Gabriel Knight: Sins of the Fathers where Southerner Gabriel Knight (portrayed by Tim Curry), posing as Mosely, first visits Malia Gedde's mansion and has to negotiate his way past her English butler Robert, also voiced by Curry. Especially funny after Malia has Gabriel thrown out, leading to this little piece of dialogue:\n\nAlso a Massive Multiplayer Crossover, Dengeki Gakuen RPG: Cross of Venus had some fun with this at the expense of Rie Kugimiya (Shana, Taiga and Sabato; only one of them is not a flat-chested Tsundere) and to a smaller extent, Ai Nonoka (Iriya and Kanade). These conversations are all restricted to the Hub Level so you don't have to worry too much about \"teh Rie\" monologuing when the game gets serious.\n\nAt the same time, it averts this with Mamiko Noto, offering no interaction between Haruka and Bonus Boss Hecate (despite Haruka being a non-playable party member, so technically they do meet). Ditto for Kazuhiko Inoue and Kimiko Koyama, who both reprise roles across two different series; their respective characters don't meet at all\n\nAnd yet 'nother Massive Multiplayer Crossover example: For Nicktoons: Globs of Doom, THQ figured that Rob Paulsen talking to himself is cheaper and since Nicolai Technus is already a playable character, they decided to let him reprise the role of Tak and the Power of Juju antagonist Tlaloc/Traloc despite the TV adaptation of that video game series (where the character got The Other Darrin'd with Jeff Bennett) being depicted in the game. Indeed, the scene where the Evil Syndicate snaps back is mostly a Paulsen monologue; easily the most amusing thing in the game next to the hamminess that is Invader Zim himself.\n\nOracle of Tao: the voice actress for Ambrosia, the lead character, also plays her evil twin (which is an example, even though they are technically the same role, since the evil twin is a Literal Split Personality), and the villain Estheriel. Oddly, there's an inversion, as she is supposed to be one and the same with God, but this role has its own actor.\n\nStreet Fighter\n\nIn the Street Fighter Alpha and EX series, as well as some of the Vs. games, Bison (\"Dictator\") and Akuma are both voiced by Tomomichi Nishimura. Amusing, since Akuma beats up Bison in Super Turbo.\n\nNot so, nowadays. In Street Fighter IV, Akuma's now voiced by Taketora, while Bison is voiced by Norio Wakamoto (reprising the role from SVC Chaos, where Nishimura still voiced Akuma).\n\nIn fact, Street Fighter IV is probably the first game where everyone is voiced by different actors. The Alpha series had Toshiyuki Morikawa as Ryu and Charlie, Tetsuya Iwanaga as Ken and Guy, Koichi Yamadera as Balrog and Cody, Akiko Komoto as Cammy, Juni, and Juli, Wataru Takagi as Zangief, Sodom, Birdie, Gen, and Adon, and others. Street Fighter III has Len Carlson as Q and Hugo, and Lawrence Bayne as Gill, Urien, Necro, and Twelve. The original Street Fighter II used the same sounds for Ryu and Ken, and everyone (save Chun-Li, for obvious reasons) had the same death scream.\n\nThe Japanese version of IV averts this trope completely. The English version mostly averts it as well, with the exception of Taliesin Jaffe, who voices Blanka and Adon. It gets better when one realizes that he's the voice director, so he was also directing himself.\n\nEven if the voice-acting is minimalistic to barely existent, in The Legend of Zelda the Wind Waker, Link's voice (consisting of battle-cries, screams of agony and surprise, a \"Hey!\" and a rarely used \"come on!\") is done by the same woman who does his sister Aryll's voice (consisting of screams of fear, some giggles and a loud \"Ooooooy!!!\")\n\nThe consciences in Black and White are voiced by the same actor, and frequently disagree between eachother on what the player should do in any situation. This is lampshaded in the downloadable outtakes, where the voice actor gradually morphs his voice from the good conscience's to the bad one's and back, in the middle of a conversation between the two.\n\nThe Metal Gear Solid series manages to avert this for most part, even though many of the voice actors in both, the Japanese and English versions, voiced various different characters thorough the games. A notable exception in which this trope is played straight is in the Japanese version of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, in which Akio Ohtsuka played both Solid and Solidus Snake.\n\nNotably averted in Guns of the Patriots, where Big Boss has a new voice actor to avoid having the big payoff of the entire series wind up as a conversation between David Hayter and David Hayter.\n\nLegacy of Kain\n\nMichael Bell is Raziel, and occasional minor roles, like the first of Raziel's brothers he kills in Soul Reaver. Bell being a Man of a Thousand Voices, it's hard to tell without knowing beforehand. This happens literally in Soul Reaver 2 when two versions of Raziel from different time periods meet.\n\nThe series purposefully averted this trope on one occasion; Tony Jay voiced Mortanius in the original game, and then the Elder God for the next two, spurring no small amount of speculation on how the characters could be related. When the two characters finally ended up in the same game, a different actor was cast as Mortanius as a way of telling the audience that the characters aren't meant to have a connection, because the plot is so crazy at times that a simple absence of a confirmation that they're related would be seen as a confirmation.\n\nIn yet another Massive Multiplayer Crossover, Cross Edge, Rina Sato plays both Mikoto Aiba, AND Liliane Vehlendorf. Amusing since Lilian has an Ojou feel on her.\n\nAnd in the American version, Yuri Lowenthal plays both Rozeluxe Meitzen and Zelos. Of course, one's his normal voice, and the other is his Gig voice\n\nProfessor Layton\n\nIn the series, the English-language releases of the games have Christopher Robin Miller tripling up as not only the titular character, but also Inspector Chelmey and his \"arch-nemesis\" Don Paolo. He's apparently skillful enough that nobody realized it.\n\nThe games also have Lani Minella as not only the titular character's apprentice, but also their companion Flora, \"guest characters\" Sophia and Katia in the second game, Claire and Celeste in the third game, plus Emmy Altava and \"guest\" Arianna in the fourth game (and some more female smaller parts). Minella and Miller voice more characters in the series than all other voice actors combined.\n\nPersona 3\n\nMain character, Pharos, Ryoji Mochizuki, and Nyx Avatar share the same VA in both English and Japanese. All 4 are more or less the same person.\n\nThis also applies to Shinjiro and Jin (Grant George) and Chidori and Ken (Mona Marshall) while in Persona 4, both Nanako and the gas station attendant are voiced by Karen Strassman and both the main character and Adachi are voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch. However, at no point do any of these characters directly talk to each other; as Shinjiro and Jin only have one scene together where Jin doesn't talk, Chidori and Ken don't have any scenes together, and the silent protagonist obviously doesn't talk. Nanako and the gas station have one scene together where they both talk, but not to each other.\n\nAmerican video gamers are so used to voice actors being tasked with several roles in a single game that it's no surprise to hear the same voice actor for both Warden Quincy Sharp and the Spirit of Amadeus Arkham in Batman: Arkham Asylum; the same actor also has a few other minor roles. What makes this noteworthy is that the two characters of Nominal Importance are related. Bravo, Eidos, using our knowledge of the industry to lead us to ignore the most obvious solution!\n\nIn the sequel, Kevin Conroy voices both Batman, naturally, as well as Thomas Elliot. Given the latter's motivation, this is probably Fridge Brilliance again...\n\nThe English version of Snatcher narrowly avoids this trope literally, even though there's only three male voice actors (Jeff Lupetin, Jim Parks, and Ray Van Steen) out of seven in the whole game for all the characters.\n\nMichael Bell also voices multiple characters in the Ratchet and Clank series, with minimal interaction, but at one point narrates a mini game featuring another of his characters. Similarly, both Captain Qwark and his mascot Skrunch are voiced by Jim Ward.\n\nIn Halo, the pilot of the escape pod Master Chief rides in has the same voice as Cortana (Jen Taylor). Also, Pete Stacker voiced one of the Sergeants as well as Capt. Keyes. And sometimes, there's two or more Red Shirt Marines with the same voice onscreen at the same time.\n\nIn the voiced versions of Key Visual Arts Visual Novel Little Busters, Tamiyasu Tomoe voices the male protagonist Riki, the main heroine Rin, and Rin's rival (and possible heroine) Sasami.\n\nIn Backyard Skateboarding, Marky, Pete, Pablo, and Erik are voiced by the same woman. The latter three can try Marky's challenge, so when they talk, it is Talking To Herself. This is averted in the other games, however, as there is no dialogue.\n\nIn Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror, Maggie Powers and Mara Aramov are both voiced by Jennifer Hale.\n\nStrong Bads Cool Game for Attractive People naturally has most of the characters voiced by Matt Chapman (see below example in Web Animation), but also includes an in-universe example. In Dangeresque 3, Homestar plays two characters. In one scene, the two characters talk to each other, resulting in a really obviously bad split-screen shot (though in all the other scenes involving both characters, Strong Sad serves as a Stunt Double for one.)\n\nLorne Lanning is not only the co-founder of Oddworld Inhabitants and director of all of their games, but he also voiced 80% of the cast in those games\n\nLike Arkham Asylum above, Singularity uses this to toy with the player; Nolan North lends his distinctive voice to two characters, but one of them only has one line, and he delivers it when he can't be clearly seen; if you notice his voice and you don't assume it's the other character, you'll assume it's just this trope.\n\nNolan North voices more than a few pedestrians in Mafia II which occasionally leads to him talking to himself as demonstrated in this video.\n\nThe Phoenix Games version of Peter Pan has one low-quality voice actor doing narration and characters. Figuring out who is saying what is a minigame in itself.\n\nWorld of Warcraft\n\nChris Metzen voicing both Thrall, warchief of the Horde and Varian Wrynn, the new leader of the Alliance. They often meet in official machinima, cutscenes and lore sequences in dungeons, so Metzen ends up yelling at himself every other patch. The best example is probably the Secrets of Ulduar trailer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSbEr5ar0Zo\n\nBlizzard generally prefers using voice changers and echos instead of hiring voice actors, so this is probably not the only case in WoW.\n\nA common joke is: \"For every male character not voiced by Chris Metzen, down a shot.\"\n\nIn Dragon Age, Steve Blum voices three major characters. The notable instance of Talking to Himself is when the dwarven companion Oghren is talking to a dwarven man, Gorim. The only real change in voice a bit more grit to Oghren's voice.\n\nSince there's a ton of characters in Record of Agarest War, don't be surprised that a few seiyuus who will talk with one another. The most obvious one would have to be Leo and Rex who are both voiced by Takashi Kondo.\n\nRather common in the Spyro series (before the Legend of Spyro series, at least). Spyro could talk to himself when rescuing certain dragons in the original, he can talk to himself when asking the Professor for information or Hunter and Ripto can speak to themselves when facing off in Spyro 2, Bentley can talk to himself when scolding Moneybags in Spyro; Year of the Dragon, and Spyro can speak to himself in various situations in Spyro; A Hero's Tail (either having a witty banter with Hunter or a more stern banter with Red the Dragon Elder). He avoids having a conversation with Moneybags, though.\n\nIn Comic Jumper, Christopher Sabat plays both Captain Smiley and his belligerent sidekick Star.\n\nInterstate76 Nitro Pack has a mission in which Skeeter and Natty Dread do battle. They also have a few conversations over the radio. Both characters are voiced by Tom Kane.\n\nAt the end of Enslaved: Odyssey to the West, Monkey, the hero of the game voiced and motion captured by Andy Serkis, has a conversation with Pyramid, the mastermind behind the capturing and enslaving of villagers, who is also voiced and acted by Andy Serkis.\n\nThe Infinity series loves this trope. In short, if two characters share a voice actor or one character has their voice actor hidden, you can bet it's going to be important.\n\nNever 7: Haruka and Kurumi, because the former is a clone of the latter.\n\nEver 17: Takeshi and the Kid. Slightly complicated- on one hand, this is because the \"Takeshi\" and \"Kid\" that are physically seen by the other character turn out to be the same person. On the other hand, the real Takeshi and the second Kid have the same voice actor, but aside from being father and son, they have no reason to share a voice actor. Furthermore, in the Drama CD \"2035\", Blick Winkel shares the same voice actor as those three. The two Yous also have the same voice actor.\n\nRemember 11: Yuni shares a voice with Junichi for no real reason. However, when Yuni manages to calm Utsumi down from her Unstoppable Rage against Hotori, the fact that his voice is the same as her deceased son's contributes to her finally calming down.\n\nIn addition, Keiko, Hotori, and Sayaka all share the same voice actor, due to Hotori only speaking when in Keiko's body and Sayaka (probably) being the same person as Keiko. In one of the Drama CDs, a fourth character, only known as \"Alice\", also shares the same voice actor as them.\n\nAlso occurs literally in Bad Ending #28, where 2012!Satoru ends up in 2011, and meets 2011!Satoru. Notably, while 2012!Satoru has a standard \"young man\" voice, 2011!Satoru has a cold, deep voice.\n\n12Riven: Shinkuro shares a voice with Ohtemachi, Maina shares a voice with Narumi, and Omega shares a voice with Renmaru. The first one is because the former is an RSD program created in the likeness of the latter, in the second, the former is the physical manifestation of a part of the latter's mind that she lost (It Makes Sense in Context), and the third one is because the two are the same person.\n\nI/O: Twins Mayumi and Masami Shinozuka have the same voice actress. He shares a voice with Hinata, \"Ashur\", and Isaiah, and Lem shares a voice with Mutsuki, \"Marduk\", and Ereshkigal. A bunch of other characters share voice actors, but this is because the voice cast is about half the size of the cast.\n\nIn the Tokimeki Memorial 2 games, Hikari Tachibana voices both of the Shirayuki twin sisters, and as such this trope applies in the few scenes where Miho and Maho are together and talking to each other.\n\nLike Super Robot Wars, the Gundam crossover games (including SD Gundam G Generation and the Gundam vs. Series) have this as a result of combining characters from over 30 years worth of animation. Gundam vs Gundam Next Plus lampshades it: if you partner Mu La Flaga with Zechs Merquise, Milliardo Peacecraft, or Gym Ghingham (all Takehito Koyasu characters), Mu will say \"Looks like I've - I mean we've got a lot of work ahead!\"\n\nThe 2009 edition of Punch-Out!! features Canadian singer Riley Inge as both Little Mac's trainer, Doc Louis, and the final boss, Mr. Sandman. Both are African-American boxers (one retired, one the champion), and strangely, both refer to Mac as \"Mac, baby.\"\n\nThe King of Fighters has a lot of this. Just to name a few, we have Harumi Ikoma as King, Blue Mary and Yuri; Monster Maezuka as Benimaru Nikaido, Choi Bounge and Ralf Jones; and Haruna Ikezawa as Athena, Foxy and Diana.\n\nMarc Graue voiced everyone in Hotel Mario except for Princess Peach.\n\nSubverted in Phantom Brave, while Flonne and Marona have the same voice actress and the exact same voice, they scenes they share are the only ones in the entire game that aren't voiced.\n\nDawn of War has quite a bit of this, with Paul and Michael Dobson playing pretty much every non-named unit in the game, Keith Ferguson playing Mr. Nailbrain, Heretics, Ronahn and Plague Marines, Steve Blum playing Cyrus, Martellus, and Eliphas, and Fred Tatasciore playing Davian Thule, Ulkair, Bloodletters, and Veldoran.\n\nSurprisingly averted in The Operative: No One Lives Forever. Kit Harris voices both Cate Archer (the main character) and Inge Wagner (one of the major villains, who is eventually a boss), but the two never actually talk to each other.\n\nIn the Shantae games, any dialogue between the heroine and her arch-foe Risky Boots counts, as both characters are voiced by Christina Vee.\n\nAdditional example occurs in The Seven Sirens, where Vee also does Harmony's voice.\n\nWeb Animation\n\nHomestar Runner has nine main characters voiced by Matt Chapman. Nearly every conversion in the show is an example of this trope, since there are only three main characters not voiced by him (Marzipan, Pom Pom, who is The Unintelligible anyway, and The Poopsmith, who has made a vow of silence. In order to celebrate Strong Bad checking his 200th email, the Poopsmith finally broke his vow of silence to sing the intro song. Here he is voiced by John Linnell of They Might Be Giants. As of his subsequent appearance, he's gone back to being silent, though.) The ultimate example is in One Two, One Two, which has Matt singing/talking to himself in six different voices at once. The only time that this isn't the case is if circumstances render it too difficult for Matt to do a voice; for instance, his brother has had to voice Strong Sad at least once, as Matt had strained his vocal cords.\n\nMatt also voices nearly all of the secondary characters as well, including the cast of show-within-the-show Cheat Commandos, alternate Anime and \"old-timey\" versions of the main cast, and the lead vocals for Fake Bands Limozeen and Taranchula, the former in an impressive '80s-metal falsetto and the latter in a deep death-metal growl. Matt could give Mel Blanc a run for his money.\n\nIt's all the more impressive when one of his characters starts doing impressions of another character.\n\nTalking to Himself also occurs in-universe: The \"Teen Girl Squad\" sketches are created and completely voiced by Strong Bad, and the \"Powered by the Cheat\" animations are all voiced by the The Cheat, imitating the regular characters' voices (these imitations are voiced by Mike Chapman, doing his darnedest to sound like his brother).\n\nBecause many webtoons are a one-person operation, they tend to have only one voice actor: Matt Wilson does all the voices in Bonus Stage and Ed Atlin does all the characters in Space Tree, although both did when get another voice actress, Kagome Higurashi (not to be confused with the other Kagome Higurashi), who ended up voicing the female characters.\n\nThe characters in Retarded Animal Babies are all voiced by creator David Lovelace, but tuned to different pitches. In one episode, the exact pitch levels he uses for each character are even revealed in the credits.\n\nUnforgotten Realms may justify this, in that the whole premise is two guys playing a homebrew tabletop RPG (and a little brother), and so it makes sense that there wouldn't be too much variation.\n\nWhile other people play minor characters, all three main characters in Park Bench are played by Anthony Mercer.\n\nThe antagonism between The Leet World's Jerk with a Heart of Gold terrorist leader Cortez and counter-terrorist Team Dad Westheimer is made all the more interesting by the fact that they are both voiced by Eddie, who also voices the Camp Gay terrorist Montrose. Fellow crew member Daniel voices both hard-drinking fratboy Chet and the creepy Producer.\n\nJ.I.M., creator of Neurotically Yours, voices every male character on the show regardless of species. It is obvious this trope would come up at one point or another.\n\nMuch of the main cast on \"The Loud Ponies\" share voice actors: we have all 4 male main characters (Lincoln, Clyde, Bobby and Spike) and Applebloom voiced by Jason Griffith, Scootaloo, Lynn, Lana, and Rainbow Dash being voiced by Ashley Johnson, Luan and Lola voiced by Natalie Wilde, and Lori and Twilight being voiced by Kira Buckland.\n\nSeveral characters on Happy Tree Friends share voice actors. Cub, Giggles and Petunia (whose VA was replaced twice); Splendid and Lumpy (VA replaced once); Pop and Flippy. Lifty and Shifty also shared a voice actor until their VA left the show and was replaced by Kenn Navarro, also the VA for Cuddles. More recently, Pop and Flippy's VA left the show as well; while said VA is sampled for Pop and Flippy's evil side, Kenn now voices Flippy's good side.\n\nAnimator Brad Neely voices (almost) all of the characters in his cartoons, notably the eponymous Frank and Steve Smith of The Professor Brothers and Cox and Combes of the viral \"Washington Rap.\" Just in these two examples, Neely has not only had lengthy talks with himself, but has duet-rapped.\n\nTwo of the main staff members from Rooster Teeth, Burnie Burns and Matt Hullum, voice multiple main characters from Red vs. Blue. In fact, Burnie made a point of voicing all of the Alpha AI fragments (except Delta, who is voiced by Mark Bellman), which are Literal Split Personalities of his original character, Church.\n\nLampshaded at a particularly memorable occurrence during a live table read where Matt Hullum must voice Sarge and the effeminate Doc conversing all while reading the script for the very first time. Things seem to be heading toward a phone conversation between Church and Vic, both voiced by Burnie Burns, but unfortunately it's averted at the last moment.\n\nWeb Comics\n\nIn the Watchmen motion comic, ALL the characters are voiced by one guy. Needless to say, the biggest problem with the presentation is that female characters come off sounding like stereotype transexuals.\n\nAs mentioned above, Game Masters do this often, so it's no surprise that the GM of Darths and Droids does this as a lot. There was also that one time when Jim was given control of his character's family, and found himself in a situation where he had to roleplay girl talk with himself.\n\n\"Um, do you need some time alone?\"\n\nWeb Original\n\nDoug Walker is known for his roles as Ask That Guy, The Nostalgia Critic, and Chester A. Bum. In the Nostalgia Critic's review of Mortal Kombat Annihilation, Doug has his beard shaved, and all three of his characters pop up in the intro with their own explanation of why they had their beard shaved (Nostalgia Critic shaved it because he made a bet that John McCain would win, That Guy shaved his because he thought the bet was about him posting his next video with the viewer responses within a week, and Chester just did it because he didn't want to be left out of the group). They quabble for a bit until NC dismisses Chester and then knocks out That Guy with a brick.\n\nAlmost everyone on Channel Awesome plays multiple characters. In The Spoony Experiment Noah Antwiler plays both"
