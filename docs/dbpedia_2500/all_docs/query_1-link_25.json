I could\n\nswear\n\nshe was a granddaughter, but ah well... Sorry about that. Still kin.\n\nThere was one on the Black Isle messageboards who heard Melissa in a\n\ncommercial. She used her Imoen voice and he said it was weird hearing Imoen\n\nadvertise for make-up :-). I want to hear the outtakes in BGII.\n\n'Hiya, it's me. EVIL Imoen.' in her BG1 voice, and following that with\n\na low evil snigger 'You WILL learn to trust me'. David Gaider at Bioware\n\nsweared that it was bound to get out since everyone was using it as a\n\ndesktop sound... This was about the time when there was a lot of\n\nspeculation about Imoen betraying you. Gaider had absolutely no idea how\n\nMelissa knew about this.\n\nI'm not so sure about the Viconia thing, I think there was some bad\n\ninformation around somewhere. Do you use www.imdb.com ? I seem to\n\nremember a casting list from the Audio Director, Charles Deenen, at\n\nInterplay\n\nand it was different. The list was reprinted on the message boards not\n\nlong ago, but I cannot find it on any message board or websites.

Do you use www.imdb.com ?\n\nI didn't know about this site until you mentioned it -- but thanks, I\n\nrecently went there and obtained a first-billed casting list for BG2 which I've\n\nappended below for the records -- unfortunately, it doesn't specify who voiced\n\nwhich npc's...\n\n>I seem to\n\n>remember a casting list from the Audio Director, Charles Deenen, at\n\n>Interplay\n\n>and it was different.

Sorry...\n\n>Hm, Viconia has different actresses in BGI and BGII, maybe I'm confused\n\n>by that. I'll shut up now.\n\nYou could be right about someone else voicing BG2's Viconia. The first\n\nsite (credit to Flarn for finding it) I obtained my voice info from\n\nhttp://www.voicechasers.org/VideoGames/bauldersgate.html listed Melissa Disney\n\nas doing Viconia only for BG1, and Viconia does sound much more vigorous and\n\nhusky in BG2. I had difficulty picturing someone who had voiced sweet,\n\ninnocent Imoen delivering lines such as: \"Come then, my m'rann d'ssinns, let\n\nus get our coupling over with quickly.\"\n\n>> Sounds plausible. BTW, Dynaheir, Mazzy, and PST's Fall-From-Grace\n\n>were\n\n>> done by the same actress, Jennifer Hale.\n\n>>\n\n>\n\n>She does a good job, doesn't she?

She is also in Gabriel Knight III,\n\n>namely Madeline Buthane.\n\nGabriel Knight 1 was one of the few adventure games I liked, despite having\n\nthe usual syndrome of weird, illogical puzzles, it had a terrific story and\n\nsome riveting moments. The second was a disappointment -- ick, the werewolf we\n\nfinally got to see was so tacky. I passed up on the third, but this might be\n\nanother incentive to try it.\n\n>Loved Torment, too bad we won't get a sequel.\n\nI liked it, but not as much as BG2, or even BG1. I would definitely play\n\nthe sequel, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\n>Want Sheena Easton back for more voice acting though.\n\nHehe, Sheena Easton was the main reason Speaker-to-Customers would even\n\nconsider trying Torment again. I have a thing for redheads, but curiously,\n\nwasn't quite as taken with Annah as with Fall-From-Grace.\n\n>> I don't recall who did Aerie at the moment but she deserves a good\n\n>acting\n\n>> of bad acting award -- her \"uh, ah, oh, I don't think I can't go on,\n\n>waahhhh!\"\n\n>> bit was priceless.\n\n>\n\n>Indeed.

Maybe it was the\n\nvoice, I like it.\n\n> >Had an amusing bug with my first game,\n\n> >my female hard-asss fighter protagonist buyed Jaheira a locket.

Too bad I haven't a savegame. I have sent the\n\nproblem to Kevin Dorner who does a lot of unoffical bug-fixing, and he\n\nbelieve some variables didn't get set as they should have been. Fun anyway,\n\nnot only one but two women.\n\nGwendolyn had 19 as natural CHA, she must have made quite an impression:). A\n\nfighter import from BGI, 19 in STR, CON and CHA makes the game too easy, but\n\nI've grown too fond of her to not use her in ToB.\n\n> >I'm not so sure about the Viconia thing, I think there was some bad\n\n> >information around somewhere.

Just be aware that much of the info there is sent by fans\n\nand therefore is not official. It still is quite accurate though. Interplay\n\nis about the only company who doesn't supply full acting lists in their\n\nmanuals. The Audio Director once said that he got a lot of e-mails regarding\n\nBG voice acting and he considered putting up the information on the net.\n\nUnfortunately, it seem to have been forgotten. By the way, chech IMDB-entry\n\nfor David Warner. I knew he was an old timer, but he has had a lot of roles.\n\nLoved him in Time Bandits and TRON.\n\n> You could be right about someone else voicing BG2's Viconia. The\n\nfirst\n\n> site (credit to Flarn for finding it) I obtained my voice info from\n\n> http://www.voicechasers.org/VideoGames/bauldersgate.html listed Melissa\n\nDisney\n\n> as doing Viconia only for BG1, and Viconia does sound much more vigorous\n\nand\n\n> husky in BG2. I had difficulty picturing someone who had voiced sweet,\n\n> innocent Imoen delivering lines such as: \"Come then, my m'rann\n\nd'ssinns, let\n\n> us get our coupling over with quickly.\"\n\nI'm pretty sure that David Gaider said on the message board that they got\n\nall the voice actors from BGI back, with the exception of Viconia. But as he\n\nsaid, the new one did a good job. The weird thing is, he also said\n\n'Thankfully. You should have heard Viconia's lines read by Imoen's actress.\n\nBLECH.' That makes me wonder. It's a long time ago, before BGII was\n\nreleased, and I cannot find the exact quote. About innocent Imoen and such\n\nlines, it's the quiet ones you have to watch out for :-).\n\n> Gabriel Knight 1 was one of the few adventure games I liked, despite\n\nhaving\n\n> the usual syndrome of weird, illogical puzzles, it had a terrific story\n\nand\n\n> some riveting moments. The second was a disappointment -- ick, the\n\nwerewolf we\n\n> finally got to see was so tacky. I passed up on the third, but this might\n\nbe\n\n> another incentive to try it.\n\nPlaying as Grace on GKIII was somewhat interesting, some interesting puzzles\n\nusing her laptop. GKII was too much FMV and not enough puzzles if you get my\n\ndrift. Weird puzzles in GKI, agreed. The mime and the policeman drove me\n\nnuts for a long time. Loved the Monkey Island series. Too bad the 4th is so\n\nshort.\n\n> >Loved Torment, too bad we won't get a sequel.\n\n>\n\n> I liked it, but not as much as BG2, or even BG1. I would definitely\n\nplay\n\n> the sequel, but I'm not holding my breath.\n\nWhat I liked was the weirdness of the setting and the NPCs. Not your\n\nrun-of-the-mill fantasy. Surprising end too. I didn't mind reading a lot of\n\ndialogue either. But I'm not holding my breath either. Fallout 3 is more\n\nlikely.\n\n> Hehe, Sheena Easton was the main reason Speaker-to-Customers would\n\neven\n\n> consider trying Torment again.

Lurked here for a long while, but I usually\n\ndon't post. Maybe I'll change that.\n\nI liked Fall-From-Grace the most, but I loved Sheena's voice acting. She\n\nenjoyed doing the voice acting and Interplay liked her, so maybe one day...\n\nPuritan succubus and the Brothel of Intellectual Lusts, pure stroke of\n\ngenius. Morte had a comment regarding this:\n\nMorte: \"The only succubus ever to travel with us, and she's a puritan. You\n\nknow, I have the worst luck.\"\n\nFFG: \"Your luck seems to blanket us all.\"\n\nMorte: \"I'll say. I... hey, wait a minute.\"\n\n> If new voice sets will be added to the npc's _and_ more dialogs will\n\nbe\n\n> added to the romances, then I'll definitely get TOB. Npc interaction is\n\nthe\n\n> name of the game in BG2.\n\nThe romances will continue, but there are no new ones. Valygar and Mazzy\n\nseemed to be popular, but ah well... According to Bioware, the romances will\n\nbe brought to a satisfactory conclusion, whatever that means. More dialog\n\n(both text and spoken) will be added to all NPCs. Imoen will actually say\n\nsomething now, but only in the Tob areas, not the original ones. That goes\n\nfor all NPCs, maybe not for the romance tracks. I'm looking forward to the\n\nconversation between the new NPC (unnamed because it may be a spoiler) and\n\nImoen, and the new NPC and the protagonist. Could be fun.\n\nIf you search on www.planetbg.com under Charles Deenen, you will find some\n\ncomments regarding music and sound. Tob will approx. 20-25 minutes of new\n\nmusic (yes!), but the original composer is quite busy now and his\n\ninvolvement will be limited. Charles say it is still the same style. Per\n\n10th May, all the audio was finished for ToB. Maybe I'll e-mail Charles for\n\nthe casting list, too. He seems like quite a nice guy. Whew, it came out a\n\nbit longer than intended. I'll be quiet now.\n\n--\n\nGlenn"
