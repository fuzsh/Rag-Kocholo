        "text": "Praised for its intelligent writing and satirical comedy, Rick and Morty season 7 has everyone talking — but who does all the talking on the show? Previously, series co-creator Justin Roiland voiced both titular characters along with many others like Mr. Meeseeks and Mr. Poopy Butthole. But in January 2023, Adult Swim cut all ties with Roiland when allegations of domestic violence arose. Though the charges were later dismissed, more reports of inappropriate behavior persisted, meaning his roles needed to be recast.\n\nThe series recently kicked off season 7, which finally allowed fans to hear the new voice actors who stepped up to the plate. Opting to cast a different person in both of Roiland's main roles, co-creator Dan Harmon and showrunner Scott Marder auditioned thousands of actors for months before landing on Ian Cardoni as Rick and Harry Belden as Morty.\n\nThough the series often breaks the fourth wall, the new season doesn't acknowledge the changing of the guard and simply picks up where the Smiths left off. Do some members of the family (and their otherworldly foes) seem familiar? Read on to see who's behind the multiverse of voices in the Rick and Morty season 7 cast.\n\n01 of 10\n\nIan Cardoni (Rick Sanchez)\n\nRick Sanchez is effectively out of f—s to give. The middle-aged mad scientist tries to act like he can't be bothered when in fact, everything is bothering him all the time — mainly his own family. His endearing relationship with his grandson, Morty, constantly teeters between unhinged dependency and existential rage. Although he won't readily admit it, there are a few atoms in there that feel love for the kid.\n\nTeleporting in as the new voice of Rick is Ian Cardoni, whose previous credits include HBO's Clear History and being a narrator for WWE. While the actor's vocal performance bears a striking resemblance to Roiland's, Rick bears the insufferable burden of knowing that infinite possibilities exist in the multiverse, and therefore to him, nothing matters.\n\n02 of 10\n\nHarry Belden (Morty Smith)\n\nPart-time adventure companion and lab rat for Rick, Morty eventually becomes a driving force in the series instead of just an unwilling sidekick. Following Roiland's departure, the show recast Harry Belden as the new voice of Morty. Previously seen in the Disney Channel original movie Christmas Again (2021), Chicago Med, and Joe Pera Talks With You, Belden underwent a rigorous six month audition process to land the role, as did Cardoni.\n\nWith his anxiety constantly at tipping point, Morty's signature shrieks and voice cracks are now seamlessly carried by Belden. Despite having a toxic relationship with his grandpa, the boy slowly learns to stand on his own two feet (while occasionally sprouting some extra limbs). Whether he's leading a quest for treasure in a land of giants or \"Getting Schwifty\" in an intergalactic music competition, Morty finds infinite ways to annoy Rick and entertain audiences.\n\n03 of 10\n\nJon Allen (Mr. Poopy Butthole)\n\nInitially introduced as a side character, Mr. Poopy Butthole ended up hanging around like a dingleberry. After Beth believes him to be a memory parasite and shoots him, he uses her guilt as a crutch to take advantage of the Smith's hospitality.\n\nJon Allen now assumes the role formerly helmed by Roiland, which evolved from post-credit bits to a more substantial part of Rick's life when he recruited the potty humor pee-wee to his heist crew. Allen voiced an extensive list of video game and anime characters, such as Nigrissi in Dragon Ball Super, before taking over the fan-favorite weirdo. Mr. Poopy Butthole donned his iconic top hat once more in the season 7 premiere, which saw him take Rick's squad on a drug-fueled party spree in an attempt to win back his wife and child.\n\n04 of 10\n\nChris Parnell (Jerry Smith)\n\nAs the would-be patriarch of the family, Jerry Smith is less of a pillar and more of a human paper straw (limp, disposable, and gives up halfway through). SNL alum Chris Parnell's natural cadence gives Jerry a timid and pathetic quality as the endearing try-hard father figure with nothing figured out. You might also recognize Parnell as Dr. Leo Spaceman on 30 Rock and as the voice of Cyril Figgis on Archer.\n\nHad it not been for his father-in-law moving in, Jerry probably would have been content with his meager suburban existence, but Rick ensures their life is anything but ordinary. Navigating unemployment, unending marital problems, and the cosmos, Jerry might mean well, but his impotent backbone keeps getting him into trouble. Pity is the most powerful weapon in his arsenal, but he can't escape his nature: crawling back when things get slightly inconvenient.\n\n05 of 10\n\nSarah Chalke (Beth Smith)\n\nVoiced by Scrubs and Roseanne actress Sarah Chalke, Beth Smith is a woman eternally plagued by uncertainty about how different life could be if she'd chosen another path. Constantly battling insecurity about her career as a horse surgeon and her marriage to Jerry, she overcompensates with a superficial superiority complex — and a love of wine inherited from her alcoholic father. However, thanks to Rick's genius, their family has ample opportunity to explore other realities through interdimensional headsets, an imaginary Froopyland come to life, and even a clone of Beth who's wanted for rebellion against the Galactic Federation.\n\n06 of 10\n\nSpencer Grammer (Summer Smith)\n\nSummer could have easily been a one dimensional teen sister stereotype, but thankfully, Rick and Morty fleshes out her character. Voiced by Spencer Grammer, daughter of Frasier actor Kelsey Grammer, Summer is slightly jaded (but given that she knows her parents almost aborted her, it's easy to understand why). With the world at her fingertips and the universe at her backdoor, she often uses Grandpa Rick's inventions to elevate her social standing at school.\n\nOut of the classroom, however, she rises through the ranks of apocalyptic societies and even saves Rick and Morty from annihilating themselves when their memories are wiped — all without looking up from her phone. Though she doesn't quite share Morty's need for constant approval from Rick, Summer often forms a symbiotic team with her brother, whether they're freezing time to live carefree for months or piloting giant Voltron-style ferret robots.\n\n07 of 10\n\nKari Wahlgren (Rick's space cruiser)\n\nKari Wahlgren boasts an extensive voice acting resume, featuring superheroes like Wonder Woman along with video game characters like Kitana and Mileena from Mortal Kombat. In Rick and Morty season 7, Wahlgren plays Rick's space cruiser that's made from garbage but is more dangerous than it looks. Rick poured all his brain power into making the ship as smart as him — and poured his alcohol bottles in it for good measure.\n\nBeyond driving Morty's teenage hormones wild as his crush, Jessica, Wahlgren has also lent her voice to Rose, Rick's wife Diane Sanchez, and numerous alien characters.\n\n08 of 10\n\nTom Kenny (Squanchy, Gene)\n\nSquanchy is a catlike alien who looks as if a child's favorite stuffed animal developed a meth addiction. And Tom Kenny's signature helium-esque voice is perfectly suited for a character that's likely had far too many whippets. With an affinity for partying hard and replacing random implied words with \"squanch,\" this kitty is one of the few lifeforms Rick considers a friend. Accompanying Rick to Birdperson's wedding and Mr. Poopy Butthole's intervention/birthday party bender, he never backs down from a fight — or a round of shots.\n\nIn addition to voicing the Smith's milquetoast neighbor Gene, who surprises the gang revealing he's Hugh Jackman's in-law, Kenny has carried various other Rick and Morty characters, such as a talking chair, several gear people, King Jellybean, and Pencilvester. He's also famous for playing Spongebob Squarepants and the Ice King/Simon on Adventure Time.\n\n09 of 10\n\nDan Harmon (Birdperson/Phoenixperson)\n\nDan Harmon is a man of many hats (and voices), having previously spearheaded Community and co-founded Channel 101. As a co-creator, writer, and executive producer of Rick and Morty, he's also portrayed several characters on the show, the most notable being the no-nonsense, monotonous voice of Birdperson.\n\nThough Rick pretends to not have attachments, Birdperson is his best friend whom he fought beside in many past battles. Even after his pal's rebirth as Phoenixperson, Rick doesn't abandon his oldest companion. In addition to the feathered fella, Harmon has also voiced god villain Reggie, Heistotron, and the aquatic antagonist Mr. Nimbus.\n\n10 of 10\n\nKeith David (the President)\n\nRick has made many enemies over the years, but one particular pebble in his shoe happens to be the President of the United States, played by Keith David. His voice has a cold and commanding gravitas that's perfectly suited for the commander-in-chief. Though his foe is the leader of the free world, Rick's disdain for authority figures always takes precedence, and he even previously turned himself and Morty into turkeys to get a pardon on Thanksgiving.\n\nDavid's other Rick and Morty character is the short-necked/long-bodied Reverse Giraffe in the parasite episode \"Total Rickall.\" You may also recognize the actor from more serious sci-fi works like John Carpenter's The Thing (1986), Armageddon (1998), and Nope (2022), along with Emmy-winning documentary voice work and vocal roles in The Princess and the Frog (2009) and Coraline (2009)."
