He says.\n\n’It wasn't supposed to be a threat - replies the angel. but a look of surprise.. because i saw him so far from Samarra… were I am picking him up this afternoon.\n\nOn 28/10/2016 16:37, jacqueline wrote:\n\nI’ve been getting more jobs recently requiring character voices and this piece I have chosen to read for Halloween is another great excuse to indulge my love for voice acting.\n\nIt is a very short story by the great Gabriel Garcia Marquez, ‘Death in Samarra’. It features three characters plus a narrator.\n\nIf I'm going to act the different voices in a dialogue, rather than just reading them plainly, I make sure I'm not going to be overwhelmed by a huge cast of characters. I find that more than five or six, it starts to get a bit hard to differentiate between them. It is possible to use tricks like pitch control with the software but the purist in me likes a reading to sound as natural as possible and I like the challenge of achieving distinct character voices without resorting to the effects menu.\n\nAfter initially scanning the piece I try to imagine how the characters look in my minds eye. This is my only prep before I do the first take.\n\nI always record my first read-through. It is surprising how often something good emerges from a spontaneous reading. Characters can appear seemingly by there own accord, fully formed. If I like what I hear in the playback I will try to keep as much of the first take as possible. Then I will work more on the other characters if they need pulling apart, to make them more audibly different.\n\nWhen I'm voicing male characters as in this piece, I suppose I am lucky in having quite a deep vocal range. It's important to say that I'm not trying to do an impression of a male voice. The voice that comes out is more to do with the personality of the character as I see it rather than its sex."
