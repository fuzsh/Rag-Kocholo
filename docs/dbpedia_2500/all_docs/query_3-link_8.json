        "text": "Made an extremely rare public appearance with fellow voice actor Maurice LaMarche at Comic-Con International 2002 at the invitation of fellow voice actor Mark Hamill. He was given a 2-minute standing ovation upon arriving, and after calming down, the audience was treated to \"Nations of the World,\" which he did with no mistakes. It was received with thunderous applause, and along with Maurice, they did many Pinky and the Brain impersonations. The impressions can be seen on the bonus disc of Comic Book: The Movie (2004). Rob Paulsen returned in 2003 for a live encore.\n\nBecause he voices Jim Carrey's character of Stanley Ipkiss in the cartoon spin-off series Die Maske (1995), whenever a Jim Carrey movie is aired on television and needs to be edited for language content, Rob Paulsen is called upon to re-dub whenever Carrey is not available.\n\n[on voicing two Ninja turtles in two incarnations of the show] I'm a two time turtle baby, and I figure if I live to be a hundred I can knock all four of them out.\n\n[When asked who was his biggest influence] The first one of course would have to be probably Mel Blanc because I loved cartoons as a kid as we all did. Mel I think set the standard. Mel and Frank Welker, as far as I'm concerned, are the two best who've ever walked the face of the earth with respect to voice acting."
