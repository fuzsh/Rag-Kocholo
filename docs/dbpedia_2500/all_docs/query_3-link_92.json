        "text": "To quote Fight Club: “His name is Robert Paulsen.”\n\nIf that name doesn’t ring a bell, maybe these will: Carl Wheezer, Yakko Warner, Mark Chang, Pinky the mouse, Jack Fenton, Donatello, and Raphael.\n\nOver the course of almost four decades, Rob Paulsen has cemented himself as a legendary icon of the voiceover world. He grew up on a healthy diet of Looney Tunes, Johnny Quest, Rocky and Bullwinkle, and The Flintstones, eventually following in the footsteps of his personal heroes, like Mel Blanc and June Foray.\n\n“I don’t pretend to put myself in that category, that’s for other people to decide once I’ve gone to that big animation corporation in the sky,” Paulsen told me during a recent phone interview. “I remember working with Mel and June the first times when I was 28 or 30, and it really got my attention. I’ll never forget it. [Their] characters certainly made an indelible mark on myself and others.”\n\nWhile my call with Rob was originally pegged to Hulu’s reboot of Animaniacs, our interview soon snowballed into a much larger creature that had us merrily chatting away for over an hour. Like most of us, I grew up hearing Rob on television. He is, quite literally, one of the voices of my childhood.\n\n“You know it’s funny,” he said, “every now and then, people say, ‘Man, I grew up watching Pinky and the Brain or Animaniacs’ … We’re all good, as long as you don’t say, ‘I threw up watching Pinky and the Brain.’ I’m sure there are those who would say that, too, but already, just the fact that you say that, you can imagine what a remarkable, humbling remark that is to me.”\n\nRob constantly hears about the profound impact of his work at various fan conventions around the country (back when it was still safe to hold them, of course).\n\n“It’s not about me, it’s about the characters — they are so profoundly impactful. I don’t even know how to tell you how humbling that is,” he added. “It gains in its power to me. Every time I hear that, it reminds me that this is something that is timeless and will be around much, much longer than I am. That is what this legacy is about.”\n\nHe recounted some truly moving stories from fans, who got through incredibly difficult experiences by watching his shows. Here’s just one example: “Mr. Paulsen, I was in the Marine Corps and I did two tours of duty and I need to show you something. Here’s a picture of me and my friend who didn’t make it back, but we both had our Pinky and the Brain T-shirts on.”\n\nWhile those inspirational stories never cease to amaze Rob, he also has one of his own. In 2016, he was diagnosed with a voice actor’s worst nightmare: throat cancer. “Not only is it deadly, but it’s a really bad way to go,” he explained. “When you get cancer of the throat, mouth, neck, and they gotta start hacking pieces of you off to save you, it’s not a great way to go. It’s really messy.”\n\nFortunately, he received the proper treatment via Gardasil (a vaccine originally developed to prevent HPV in young women) and kicked cancer’s big fat behind. He then detailed the harrowing experience in a 2019 memoir entitled Voice Lessons.\n\n“This is about everything we discussed: humor, the power of joy and getting me through my own time in the cancer cage; the power of joy in helping parents reconcile the loss of their children. It boils down to the way people react when I say, ‘NARF!’ or ‘Hell000000 Nurse!’ or ‘Turtle power!’ ... You see my point, all of it makes you smile.”\n\nThese days, Rob serves as the official 2020 spokesperson for the Head and Neck Cancer Alliance, a role he happily inherited from former Buffalo Bills quarterback, Jim Kelly. “They were very smart because now they know that my story (and specifically because of what I do for a living) can be helpful, informative, and maybe even inspirational,” he said. “Right away, they can say, ‘Hey, what if I told you the guy who’s responsible for being the voice of your childhood had throat cancer?’ You’d say, ‘Oh my God, really? Did it kill him?’ [They can now say,] ‘Actually, no, it didn’t. It would’ve, but he went through the treatment.”\n\nAs our discussion began to wind down, Rob and I talked about the most important topic of them all: Tik Tok’s “Carl Wheezer Accent Challenge,” in which Jimmy Neutron fans attempt to replicate the nasally voice of the nebbishy Nickelodeon character.\n\n“I fired up Tik Tok and I noticed that, ‘Jesus!’ There were thousands of people who did their own Carl Wheezer thing,” he said. “I wrote a few lyrics to an old Barry Manilow song and just did an a capella version of it [as Carl]. Then I put up a bunch of stuff with different emphasis on ‘Are you gonna finish that croissant?’ One of them got like 3 million views or something in the first week.”\n\n“I don’t know what it is, but people sure love Carl Wheezer and I could do it all day,” he continued. “It’s the greatest thing in the world, man. It’s great and I’m really looking forward to spending more time on Tik Tok and learning how to access it ... I’m gonna do more Carl stuff because people just love that guy. Stay tuned!”\n\nRob is as genial and down-to-Earth as they come, always happy to do a voice or two when you just so happen to mention your favorite characters among his long list of credits. Even when he name-drops some of his famous friends (Tress MacNeille, Mark Hamill, Nancy Cartwright, Billy West, Kevin Conroy, and John DiMaggio, to name a few), he’s a little self-deprecating about it.\n\n“My buddy Dave Coulier had a great joke, years ago. He said, ‘I gotta stop dropping names, Bob De Niro told me that,’” Paulsen concluded. I have very famous friends, movie star friends — not because I’m a movie star, but because they worked on cartoons and we hit it off and we’ve become buddies ... I’m a fan [of these people too], I pinch myself all the time.”\n\nThe new Animaniacs is now streaming on Hulu."
