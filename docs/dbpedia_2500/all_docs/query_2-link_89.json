        "text": "Forty days with Jesus along the Lent path\n\n\"In each fall, a learning.\n\nIn each learning, an opportunity of transcendence.\n\nIn each transcendence, a Grace of liberation.\n\nIn each liberation, an opportunity to die to oneself.\n\nIn each moment of spiritual death, a door that opens to the expansion of consciousness.\n\nBut you must know well that, while you are in this world, you will live with afflictions. However, the afflictions might make you grow and mature, or the same afflictions might make you sink into interminable victimism.\n\nTherefore, be intelligent and do not deceive yourself. From each life experience, allow yourself to take each moment as an impulse of ascension, as the stairway of Light that is placed before you so that you may ascend step by step.\n\nThe universe will always show you its signs.\"\n\nChrist Jesus"
