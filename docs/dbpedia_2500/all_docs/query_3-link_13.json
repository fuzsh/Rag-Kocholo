        "text": "Rob Paulsen Character Throttle Born March 11, 1956, Detroit, Michigan, U.S.\n\nRobert Fredrick \"Rob\" Paulsen III (born March 11, 1956), often credited as Rob Paulsen, is an American voice actor and singer, best known as the voice behind Raphael from the 1987 cartoon of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Yakko Warner and Dr. Otto Scratchansniff from Animaniacs, Pinky from Pinky and the Brain and Animaniacs, Rev Runner from Loonatics Unleashed, and Throttle from the 1990s and 2006 versions of Biker Mice from Mars].[1] His role as Pinky won him a Daytime Emmy Award for male vocal performance.\n\nIn total, Paulsen has been the voice of over 250 different animated characters and performed in over 1000 commercials. He continues to play minor parts in dozens of cartoons as well as supporting characters in animated movies.\n\nPersonal life[]\n\nPaulsen was born in Detroit, Michigan. He is married to Parrish Todd and has one son, Ashton. In an interview with a Chicago TV station, Paulsen described himself as \"a singer who decided to become an actor.\" Growing up in Grand Blanc, Michigan, Paulsen sang in choir throughout his youth and adolescence and began performing in plays in grammar school. However, his idol growing up was Gordie Howe of the Detroit Red Wings; he considered the arts to be a secondary career choice, primarily interested in becoming a professional hockey player.\n\nPaulsen has long supported charity organizations, and donated considerably for cancer research. He has worked a lot for GOALmodels, a program for adolescents, and is a sponsor of Camp Will-A-Way, a camp for mentally and physically disabled children. Paulsen also donates funds from autographs to the Wounded Warrior Project and Operation Smile.\n\nCareer[]\n\nEarly career[]\n\nHe began his voice over career at Hanna-Barbera in 1983 with the mini-series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, where he played Snow Job and Tripwire. A few years later, his career launched into more roles such as Cobra Slavemaster and reprising Snow Job and Tripwire on G.I. Joe, Corky on The Snorks, Marco Smurf on the later seasons of The Smurfs, Boober on the animated version of Fraggle Rock, Hadji in The New Adventures of Jonny Quest and the title character, Saber Rider and the villain \"Jesse Blue\" on Saber Rider and the Star Sheriffs.\n\nDuring the 1980s Paulsen also explored the field of live action cinema. His first movie was Eyes of Fire in 1983. He played supporting roles in Body Double, Stewardess School, Mutant on the Bounty, and Warlock. He appeared in television shows during this time as well, such as MacGyver and St. Elsewhere. He mentioned in an interview, regarding his role in Body Double, that he would not want his child (who was very young at the time of the interview) to see the movie, so he could not really be proud of his work.\n\nPaulsen's first major role was in 1987, as \"Raphael\" in the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles television series.\n\nAdvertising[]\n\nPaulsen became more prevalent in the world of advertising as well. In the 1980s he had been the announcer for the sitcom Cheers and continued to secure roles as an announcer. He appeared as the voice of \"Mr. Opportunity\", spokesman of Honda commercials on TV and radio, the announcer for Buffalo Dick's Radio Ranch, and the spokesman for Lucky Stores, a West-coast grocery store chain, before it was acquired by Albertsons in 1998. He provided the voice of \"Dog\" in the Taco Bell kids meal commercials from 1996 to mid-1997, with Eddie Deezen as the voice of \"Nacho\" the cat.\n\nHowever Paulsen's most famous advertising role was in the original commercial of the now ubiquitous Got Milk? campaign. The famous commercial, Who Shot Alexander Hamilton?, aired in 1993, and launched the Got Milk? campaign into a monstrously successful enterprise. Paulsen continues to be one of the most sought-after commercial voice actors in the industry.\n\nHe can be currently heard as the voice of singing Mini-Wheat in the Mini-Wheats commercials in Canada.\n\nTuning in to Spielberg[]\n\nThroughout the early 1990s, Paulsen continued to co-star in animated series, which allowed him to branch further into radio and television announcements and dropped live-action acting from his repertoire. In 1993, he voiced \"Antoine D'Coolette\" in ABC's series Sonic the Hedgehog, and \"Arthur\", an insecure accountant in a moth costume (wings included), in the superhero series The Tick in 1995.\n\nIn 1993, he starred as the title character in both Mighty Max and The Mask. Also at this time he starred in what became one of his most popular roles, \"Yakko Warner\" of Animaniacs.
