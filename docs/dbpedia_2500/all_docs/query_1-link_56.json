She did\n\na great Jaheira job, though. I asked about Jennifer Darling and Mr. Borders\n\nsaid it was a misprint in the BGI manual.

Voice acting is turning into\n\nbig business these days, and I believe it's easier for the companies to cast\n\nsomeone who knows what voice acting actually entails. Speaking of\n\ncrossovers, Interplay did the sound recording of Giants, Sacrifice and\n\nFallout: Tactics and I see that Grey Delisle, Melissa Disney, Tim Curry,\n\nKevin Michael Richardsson, Charity James and Hidi Shannon figures in those\n\ngames.

There are a few others\n\n> Voice acting is turning into\n\n> big business these days, and I believe it's easier for the companies to cast\n\n> someone who knows what voice acting actually entails.\n\nYes, very much so.\n\nWithout leaving Interplay's games, I'd also point to George Takei and\n\nChristopher Plummer for Starfleet Command, and Klingon Academy has\n\nChristopher Plummer, Michael Dorn, and David Warner. Of course, George\n\nis reprising his role as Sulo, and in KA, Plummer as General Chang and\n\nDavid Warner as the Chancellor-whose-name-I-cannot-recall.\n\nI really pay close attention to the Bioware/Black Isle games when it\n\ncomes to voice casting, though.\n\n> Speaking of\n\n> crossovers, Interplay did the sound recording of Giants, Sacrifice and\n\n> Fallout: Tactics and I see that Grey Delisle, Melissa Disney, Tim Curry,\n\n> Kevin Michael Richardsson, Charity James and Hidi Shannon figures in those\n\n> games.
