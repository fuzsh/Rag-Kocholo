        "text": "His name is Robert Paulsen. Actually he goes by Rob, but I wanted to get any references to Fight Club out of the way. Remember the first rule?\n\nVanity Fair recently sat down with Detroit, Michigan native Rob Paulsen and in addition to having him give a sample of his most famous character voices, they also placed pictures of new cartoons in front him. Paulsen then brilliantly not only comes up with a couple different versions of the character, but explains the creative process behind it.\n\nIf you've never seen a voice over artist work, you'll enjoy this video. Pay attention to the way his posture, gestures, and facial expressions morph as he takes on the persona of these new avatars.\n\nThe A Brief Introduction of Michigan's Own Rob Paulsen\n\nRob Paulsen is a Detroit, Michigan native who you wouldn't recognize on the street, unless you are a fan of cartoons. His voice will awaken your inner-child or bring back memories of your kids 'staying busy' after school or on Saturday mornings. Here are just a few of the literal hundreds of cartoons Paulsen has brought life to:\n\nYakko Warner\n\nCarl Wheezer\n\nPinky\n\nTeenage Mutant Turtle Raphael\n\nTeenage Mutant Turtle Donatello\n\nThe Improvisational Mind is a Marvel\n\nWatch as in just seconds, Detroit, Michigan's, own Rob Paulsen brings audio animation to life in this video interview from Vanity Fair."
