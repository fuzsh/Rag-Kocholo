I lived with my mother and father, as well as my older sister Daisy! From a young age, I didn't seem to want to socialize with most people and secluded myself from my peers. I enjoyed the act of people watching more than the act of actually speaking to them. I was quiet, the opposite of my sister, loved by all! She was a dancer, a singer, an artist, she was almost the perfect daughter, besides of course, the drinking. My sister was a party queen, constantly going out! My parents always allowed her to go out because of how well she was doing in school. They weren't aware of what was going on, but I did. My sister's drinking had gotten bad, to the point she was drinking small amounts every day. One evening, I went to a sleepover my parents convinced me to go to, I didn't want to but it was for some random girls birthday party...but I was scared...I texted my sister to come pick me up and didn't know she had been drinking...I should of assumed...She crashed that evening, a fatal crash.\n\nMy family was devastated and could no longer stay around our hometown. A woman my mother worked with, a woman close to my family, had moved to Japan a year prior. My mother reached out to her to discuss the local businesses, schools and more. After a ton of thinking, we moved to Japan and I was enrolled in Taketatsu High School.\n\n╰─────────\n\n╭──────────\n\n┊◯ Facial Features: Soft Jawline, Slight Double Chin + Average Lips, Often Covered with Dark Lip Stick + Flared Nose, + Almond Eyes + Freckles Scattered All Over Face\n\n┊◯ Body Features: Larger Shoulders + Average Chest + Slight Rolls + Larger Hips\n\n┊◯ Burns/Scars/Birthmarks: N/A\n\n┊◯ Height: 5'0\n\n┊◯ Skin Type/Color: White, Soft\n\n┊◯ Hair Color: Black, Bleached and Dyed to Be Purple\n\n┊◯ Eye Color: Blue\n\n┊◯ Aesthetic/Clothing Choice: A mix of Grunge + Goth + Emo!
