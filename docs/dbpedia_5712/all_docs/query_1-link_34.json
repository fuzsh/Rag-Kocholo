        "text": "Bloodborne pathogens such as HBV, HCV and HIV can be transmitted through contact with infected human blood and other potentially infectious materials (OPIM) as defined below.\n\nBlood is defined as human blood, human blood components and products made from human blood. Also included in this definition are medications derived from blood, such as immune globulins, albumin, and factors 8 and 9.\n\nOPIM includes all of the following:\n\nHuman body fluids: semen, vaginal secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, pleural fluid, pericardial fluid, peritoneal fluid, amniotic fluid, saliva in dental procedures, any body fluid that is visibly contaminated with blood, and all body fluids in situations where it is difficult or impossible to differentiate between body fluids.\n\nAny unfixed tissue or organ (other than intact skin) from a human (living or dead). Human cell lines are considered OPIM if they can or do carry bloodborne pathogens. Some cell lines have been tested and certified by the suppliers to be free of bloodborne pathogens. Fixed human tissues are not potentially infectious with bloodborne pathogens and therefore are not considered OPIM.\n\nHIV-containing cell or tissue cultures, organ cultures, and HIV- or HBV-containing culture medium or other solutions; and blood, organs, or other tissues from experimental animals infected with HIV or HBV.\n\nBlood and tissues of experimental animals infected with bloodborne pathogens.\n\nIt is important to know the ways exposure and transmission are most likely to occur in your particular situation, be it providing first aid to a student, handling human cells in the laboratory, or cleaning up blood from a hallway. Consult your Bloodborne Pathogens Exposure Control Plan or your supervisor for this information.\n\nBloodborne pathogens are most commonly transmitted through:\n\nAccidental puncture from contaminated needles, broken glass, or other sharps\n\nContact between broken or damaged skin and infected body fluids\n\nContact between mucous membranes and infected body fluids\n\nSexual Contact\n\nSharing of hypodermic needles\n\nFrom mothers to their babies at/before birth\n\nIn most work or laboratory situations, transmission is likely to occur because of accidental puncture from contaminated sharps or contact between broken skin or mucous membranes and infected body fluids. Anytime there is blood-to-blood contact with infected blood or body fluids, there is a potential for transmission.\n\nUnbroken (intact) skin forms an impervious barrier against bloodborne pathogens; therefore, blood getting on intact skin is not considered an exposure risk.\n\nHowever, infected blood can enter your system through:\n\nOpen sores\n\nCuts\n\nAbrasions\n\nAcne\n\nAny sort of damaged or broken skin such as sunburn, chapped skin or blisters\n\nBloodborne pathogens may also be transmitted through the mucous membranes such as in the:\n\nEyes\n\nNose\n\nMouth\n\nFor example, a splash of contaminated blood to your eye, nose, or mouth is considered an exposure event and could result in transmission."
