        "text": "A communicable disease is any disease that passes between people or animals. People sometimes refer to communicable diseases as “infectious” or “transmissible” diseases.\n\nPathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa, cause communicable diseases.\n\nLearn more about the different types of pathogens here.\n\nSymptoms\n\nOnce a pathogen has entered a person’s body, it often will begin replicating. The individual may then begin to experience symptoms.\n\nSymptoms will vary depending on the disease. Some people will not experience any symptoms. However, they can still transmit the pathogen.\n\nSome symptoms are a direct result of the pathogen damaging the body’s cells. Others are due to the body’s immune response to the infection.\n\nSome communicable diseases may be mild, and symptoms pass after a few days. However, some can be serious and potentially life threatening. Symptom severity may vary depending on a person’s overall health and immune function.\n\nFour main types of pathogens cause infection: Viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.\n\nViruses\n\nViruses are tiny pathogens that contain genetic material. Unlike other pathogens, they lack the complex structure of a cell.\n\nTo replicate, they must enter the cells of other living beings. Once inside, they use the cell’s machinery to make copies of themselves.\n\nBacteria\n\nBacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms. They exist in almost every environment on earth, including inside the human body.\n\nMany bacteria are harmless, and some help the body to function. However, bacteria can also cause infections that damage the body.\n\nFungi\n\nFungi are a type of organism that includes yeasts, molds, and mushrooms. There are millions of different fungi. However, only around 300 cause harmful illnesses.\n\nFungal infections can occur anywhere in the body. However, they commonly affect the skin and mucus membranes.\n\nProtozoa\n\nProtozoa are microscopic organisms that typically consist of a single cell.\n\nSome protozoa are parasitic, meaning they live on or inside another organism and use the organism’s nutrients for their own survival. Parasitic protozoa can cause various diseases.\n\nLearn more about parasitic infections here.\n\nCommon viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoa diseases include:\n\nRhinoviruses\n\nRhinoviruses are a group of viruses that are the most common cause of the common cold. Symptoms of a cold may include:\n\na stuffy or runny nose\n\nsore throat\n\nheadache\n\nA person can catch a rhinovirus by inhaling contaminated droplets from the cough or sneeze of another person.\n\nSimilarly, rhinoviruses are spread by people touching their nose, eyes, or mouth after touching items or surfaces that have come into contact with the virus.\n\nCoronaviruses\n\nCoronaviruses are a large group of viruses that affect the respiratory system. This family includes the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Some coronaviruses can cause common cold and flu symptoms, while others can cause more severe outcomes.\n\nCoronavirus resources\n\nFor more advice on COVID-19 prevention and treatment, visit our coronavirus hub.\n\nInfluenza\n\nInfluenza viruses are infections that attack the respiratory system. Some potential symptoms include:\n\nfever or chills\n\nstuffy or runny nose\n\nsore throat\n\ncough\n\nheadaches\n\nmuscle or body aches\n\nfatigue\n\nA person can catch influenza viruses in the same way they may catch rhinoviruses.\n\nHIV\n\nHIV attacks the immune system of its host. This makes the person vulnerable to other infections and diseases. A person can contract HIV as a result of contact with blood or other body fluids containing the virus.\n\nThe symptoms of HIV may develop gradually and in stages. They can include:\n\nfever\n\nchills\n\nrash\n\nmouth sores\n\nsore throat\n\nswollen lymph nodes\n\nnight sweats\n\nmuscle aches\n\nfatigue\n\nThe only way a person can be certain they have HIV is to have an HIV test.\n\nAlthough there is no cure for HIV, medications can help to keep the virus under control or make it undetectable. Without such treatment, HIV can develop into AIDS.\n\nLearn more about undetectable HIV here.\n\nOther medications can help prevent a person from contracting HIV. People at high risk of HIV and those who believe they may have had exposure to it should speak with their primary healthcare professional about these options.\n\nHIV and AIDS resources\n\nFor more in-depth information and resources on HIV and AIDS, visit our dedicated hub.\n\nSalmonella and Escherichia coli\n\nNontyphoidal Salmonella and Escherichia coli (E. coli) are two different types of bacteria that can infect the digestive system. Another form of salmonella, Salmonella typhi, can also cause typhoid.\n\nThey typically spread through contaminated foods, such as uncooked meats and eggs, unwashed fruits and vegetables, and contaminated water sources.\n\nSalmonella can also spread through contact with live animals, including chickens, and through person-to-person contact.\n\nSome symptoms of these infections include:\n\nabdominal cramps\n\ndiarrhea\n\nfever\n\nheadache\n\nTuberculosis\n\nTuberculosis (TB) is a bacterial infection that primarily attacks the lungs. It may cause the following symptoms:\n\na cough continuing for more than 3 weeks\n\nloss of appetite\n\nunintentional weight loss\n\nfever\n\nchills\n\nnight sweats\n\nA person can catch TB by inhaling tiny droplets or “aerosols” from the cough or sneeze of a person who has the infection.\n\nRingworm\n\nRingworm is a common fungal infection of the skin. The characteristic symptom of ringworm is a ring-shaped rash. It may be dry, scaly, or itchy.\n\nPeople may contract ringworm through:\n\nclose contact with a person who has ringworm\n\nsharing towels, bedding, or other personal items with a person who has ringworm\n\nclose contact with animals with ringworm, typically cats\n\nWithout treatment, ringworm may spread to other parts of the body.\n\nAthlete’s foot\n\nAthlete’s foot is a common fungal infection that affects the skin on the feet. It typically causes sore or itchy white patches between the toes.\n\nPeople can contract athlete’s foot through direct contact with someone who has the fungus or surfaces that have been in contact with the fungus. For example, an individual might contract athlete’s foot after walking barefoot in locker rooms, showers, or swimming pools.\n\nPlasmodium\n\nThe protozoa Plasmodium genus causes the tropical disease malaria. The parasite primarily transmits through mosquito bites.\n\nMalaria causes symptoms such as:\n\nfever and chills\n\nheadaches\n\nvomiting\n\ndiarrhea\n\nmuscle pains\n\nWithout proper treatment, malaria can be life threatening. Vaccination programs are also effectively protecting people from malaria fatalities.\n\nLyme disease\n\nLyme disease is a potentially serious infection that black-legged ticks can pass to humans. It is the most common carrier-spread disease in the United States.\n\nThe bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi causes the majority of Lyme disease cases. However, the bacteria Borrelia mayonii may also cause the disease.\n\nSymptoms of Lym disease include:\n\nheadache\n\nfatigue\n\nfever\n\nskin rash\n\nLyme disease can spread to the joints, heart, and nervous system if a person does not treat it.\n\nLearn more about Lyme disease here."
