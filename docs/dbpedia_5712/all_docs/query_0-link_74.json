        "text": "What is toxic shock syndrome?\n\nToxic shock syndrome (TSS) is a cluster of symptoms that involves many systems of the body. Certain bacterial infections release toxins into the bloodstream, which then spreads the toxins to body organs. This can cause severe damage and illness.\n\nWhat causes toxic shock syndrome?\n\nThe following bacteria commonly cause TSS:\n\nStaphylococcus aureus\n\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n\nClostridium sordellii\n\nTSS from Staphylococcus infections was identified in the late 1970s and early 1980s when highly absorbent tampons were widely used by menstruating women. Due to changes in how tampons are made, the incidence of tampon-induced TSS has declined.\n\nTSS from streptococcus infections is most commonly seen in children and the elderly. Other people at risk include those with diabetes, weak immune system, chronic lung disease, or heart disease.\n\nStaphylococcus infections. Staphylococcus aureus (or S. aureus) may normally exist on a person's body and does not cause infection. Because it's part of the body's normal bacteria, most people develop antibodies to prevent infection. S. aureus can be spread by direct contact with infected persons. People who develop TSS usually have not developed antibodies against S. aureus. Therefore, it's not usually considered a contagious infection. S. aureus infections may also develop from another infection, such as pneumonia, sinusitis, osteomyelitis (infection in the bone), or skin wounds, such as a burn or surgical site. If any of these areas are infected, the bacteria can penetrate into the bloodstream.\n\nStreptococcus infections. Streptococcus pyogenes (or S. pyogenes) TSS may occur as a secondary infection. Most commonly, this is seen in people who have recently had chickenpox, bacterial cellulitis (infection of the skin and underlying tissue), or who have weak immune systems.\n\nClostridium sordellii infections. Clostridium sordellii (or C. sordellii) normally exists in the vagina and does not cause infection. The bacteria may enter the uterus during normal menstruation, childbirth, or gynecological procedures such as abortion. Intravenous drug use can also cause C. sordellii infections.\n\nWho is at risk for toxic shock syndrome?\n\nThe following are risk factors for toxic syndrome:\n\nHistory of using super-absorbent tampons\n\nSurgical wounds\n\nA local infection in the skin or deep tissue\n\nHistory of using the diaphragm or contraceptive sponge\n\nHistory of recent childbirth, miscarriage, or abortion\n\nWhat are the symptoms of toxic shock syndrome?\n\nSymptoms of TSS involve many systems and may look like other infections. While each person may experience symptoms differently, the following are the most common symptoms of staphylococcal TSS:\n\nFever higher than 102°F (38.9°C)\n\nChills\n\nFeeling unwell\n\nHeadache\n\nFatigue\n\nRash that is red and flat and that covers most of the areas of the body\n\nShedding of the skin in large sheets, especially over the palms and soles, seen one to two weeks after the onset of symptoms.\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nVomiting\n\nDiarrhea\n\nMuscle pain\n\nIncreased blood flow to the mouth, eyes, and vagina, making them appear red\n\nDecreased urine output and sediment in urine\n\nDecreased liver function\n\nBruising due to low blood platelet count\n\nDisorientation and confusion\n\nThe following are the most common symptoms of streptococcal TSS:\n\nDangerously low blood pressure\n\nShock\n\nDecreased kidney function\n\nBleeding problems\n\nBruising due to low blood platelet count\n\nRash that is red and flat and that covers most of the areas of the body\n\nLiver impairment\n\nShedding of the skin in large sheets, especially over the palms and soles (this does not always occur)\n\nDifficulty breathing\n\nThe following are the most common symptoms of C. sordellii TSS:\n\nNausea and/or vomiting\n\nLethargy\n\nFlu-like symptoms\n\nAbdominal tenderness\n\nGeneralized swelling from fluid buildup\n\nHigh white blood cell and red blood cell count\n\nNo fever\n\nLow blood pressure\n\nVery fast heart rate\n\nHow is toxic shock syndrome diagnosed?\n\nRuling out similar illnesses (such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, among others) is critical in diagnosing TSS. Other diagnostic tests may include:\n\nBlood cultures. Tests used to find and identify microorganisms.\n\nBlood tests. Tests to measure blood clotting and bleeding times, cell counts, electrolytes, and liver function, among others.\n\nUrine tests.\n\nLumbar puncture. A procedure involving the insertion of a needle in between the vertebrae of the spine to draw spinal fluid and check for bacteria.\n\nHow is toxic shock syndrome treated?\n\nSpecific treatment will be determined by your health care provider based on:\n\nYour age, health, and medical history\n\nExtent of the disease\n\nYour tolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies\n\nExpectations for the course of the disease\n\nYour opinion or preference\n\nTreatment for TSS may include:\n\nGiving intravenous (through a vein) antibiotics\n\nGiving intravenous fluid to treat shock and prevent organ damage\n\nHeart medications in people with very low blood pressure\n\nDialysis may be required in people who develop kidney failure\n\nGiving blood products\n\nSupplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation to assist with breathing\n\nDeep surgical cleaning of an infected wound\n\nWhat are the complications of toxic shock syndrome?\n\nTSS can result in amputations of fingers, toes, or limbs, or even death.\n\nCan toxic shock syndrome be prevented?\n\nSince reinfection is common, menstruating girls and women should avoid using tampons if they have had TSS.\n\nPrompt and thorough wound care is crucial in avoiding TSS.\n\nMinimal usage of vaginal foreign body items, such as diaphragms, tampons, and sponges can also help prevent TSS.\n\nWhen should I call my health care provider?\n\nTSS may start like other infections, but it can quickly progress to a seriously life-threatening disease. If a mild illness quickly becomes severe with whole-body symptoms, seek immediate medical attention.\n\nKey Points about Toxic Shock Syndrome\n\nToxic shock syndrome describes a cluster of symptoms that involve many systems of the body.\n\nIt can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, or Clostridium sordellii.\n\nEarly symptoms are similar to other infections but can progress quickly to become life-threatening.\n\nTSS can be life-threatening and requires immediate medical attention.\n\nNext Steps\n\nTips to help you get the most from a visit to your health care provider:\n\nBefore your visit, write down questions you want answered.\n\nBring someone with you to help you ask questions and remember what your provider tells you.\n\nAt the visit, write down the names of new medicines, treatments, or tests, and any new instructions your provider gives you.\n\nIf you have a follow-up appointment, write down the date, time, and purpose for that visit.\n\nKnow how you can contact your provider if you have questions."
