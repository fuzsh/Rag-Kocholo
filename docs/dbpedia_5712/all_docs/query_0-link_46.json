        "text": "On this page\n\nTransmission\n\nSymptoms\n\nTesting\n\nTreatment\n\nTransmission\n\nSyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. If left untreated, it can cause serious health problems. Cases of syphilis are on the rise in Canada.\n\nSyphilis can be transmitted through:\n\nvaginal, anal or oral sex\n\nsharing sex toys\n\nthe placenta to a developing fetus\n\nblood transfusions in places where blood is not screened\n\nIn Canada, all donated blood is screened for syphilis.\n\nskin contact with a syphilis sore (known as a chancre) or rash\n\nchildbirth, when the baby comes in direct contact with lesions or fluids\n\nUsing condoms correctly or dental dams can lower the likelihood of passing syphilis.\n\nSymptoms\n\nYou may not notice that you have any symptoms of syphilis. However, you can pass syphilis even if you show no visible symptoms.\n\nIf left untreated, syphilis can move through 4 stages, which have different signs and symptoms.\n\nSome symptoms or effects can occur at any stage of infection, such as syphilis of the brain and nervous system (neurosyphilis). These can include:\n\nheadaches\n\ndizziness (vertigo)\n\nvision changes (ocular syphilis)\n\ncoordination or balance problems (ataxia)\n\nhearing loss, ringing in the ears (otic syphilis)\n\nmemory problems, personality changes (dementia)\n\nPrimary syphilis\n\nSymptoms of primary syphilis can include:\n\nswollen glands in the groin or neck\n\na sore or ulcer that's firm, round and painless (a chancre)\n\nThe chancre occurs where syphilis entered the body, which can be:\n\non the lips\n\nin the mouth or throat\n\nin the genital or anal area\n\nSince a chancre may not be visible and is usually painless, many people with syphilis don't recall having had one.\n\nSecondary syphilis\n\nSymptoms of secondary syphilis can develop between 2 to 12 weeks after exposure. These can include:\n\nfever\n\nheadache\n\npatchy hair loss\n\nswollen glands in the groin or neck\n\nwhite, wart-like sores (condylomata lata)\n\na rash, often including the palms of the hands and soles of the feet\n\nThese symptoms may be mild and you might not notice them. They may also be confused with other conditions.\n\nLatent syphilis\n\nUntreated secondary syphilis will progress to a latent stage. During this stage, you may not notice symptoms for up to 20 years.\n\nSomeone without symptoms who has syphilis for less than 12 months is in the early latent stage. Even without symptoms, you can pass early latent syphilis to others. Someone without symptoms who has syphilis for more than 12 months is in the late latent stage. Late latent syphilis is typically not transmissible to others.\n\nTertiary syphilis\n\nthe brain\n\nthe heart\n\nblood vessels\n\nthe nervous system\n\nUntreated tertiary syphilis can eventually lead to death.\n\nTesting\n\nYou can get tested for syphilis with a blood test. You may also have a swab taken of your sores or rash if you have any.\n\nIf you have questions or want to be tested for syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections (STI), you can contact your:\n\nhealth care provider\n\nsexual health clinic\n\nlocal public health unit\n\nFind a testing location near you (Catie.ca)\n\nTreating syphilis\n\nSyphilis can be cured with antibiotics, usually given by injection (shot). The earlier you start treatment, the better your health outcomes.\n\nEven if you're treated, you can get syphilis again if you have sex with someone who has the infection and:\n\nhas not been treated or\n\nhas not finished treatment\n\nIf you're diagnosed and treated for syphilis, be sure to:\n\nfollow your health care provider's treatment and follow-up advice\n\navoid contact with sores or sexual activities with your sexual partner(s) until you and your partner(s) have:\n\ncompleted your antibiotic treatment and\n\nbeen told by your health care provider that the infection is gone\n\nOnce you have been treated for syphilis, you'll need to go for follow-up blood tests to make sure the infection is gone. It's important that you attend all of the scheduled visits.\n\nNotify all of your sexual partners about their risk of infection. This is so they can be tested and treated.\n\nIf you're uncomfortable notifying your partner(s), ask your health care provider or local public health unit for support.\n\nRelated links"
