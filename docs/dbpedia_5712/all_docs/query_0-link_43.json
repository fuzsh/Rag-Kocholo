        "text": "Zoonotic Diseases:\n\nDisease Transmitted from Animals to Humans\n\nA zoonosis (zoonotic disease or zoonoses -plural) is an infectious disease that is transmitted between species from animals to humans (or from humans to animals).\n\nIllnesses Associated with Animal Contact\n\nRabies\n\nRabies is a disease that affects the nervous system of mammals. It is caused by a virus and is typically spread by an infected animal biting another animal or person. Rabies is a fatal disease; it cannot be treated once symptoms appear. Luckily, rabies can be effectively prevented by vaccination.\n\nAbout Rabies | Statistics | Rabies Information For Health Professionals\n\nBlastomycosis (Blastomyces dermatitidis)\n\nBlastomycosis is a rare fungal infection usually acquired by inhaling the spores of a fungus (Blastomyces dermatitidis) that can be found in wood and soil.\n\nBasics | Statistics and Maps | For Health Professionals\n\nPsittacosis (Chlamydophila psittaci, Chlamydia psittaci)\n\nInfection with Chlamydophila psittaci (formerly known as Chlamydia psittaci) is cause of systemic illness in companion birds (birds kept by humans as pets) and poultry. This illness is often referred to as avian chlamydiosis (also known as psittacosis, ornithosis, and parrot fever) in birds.\n\nTrichinosis (Trichinella spiralis)\n\nCat Scratch Disease (Bartonella henselae)\n\nHistoplasmosis (Histoplasma capsulatum)\n\nCoccidiomycosis (Valley Fever)\n\nIntestinal Illness Acquired From Animals\n\nIncluding E. coli O157:H7, Cryptosporidium parvum, Campylobacter, and Salmonella.\n\nSpotlight on specific animals:\n\nReptiles and Amphibians: Salmonella\n\nSome reptiles and amphibians can make cool pets, but they can also be a source of illness. Reptiles (e.g., Iguanas, turtles, snakes) and amphibians (e.g., frogs and toads) carry Salmonella.\n\nChicks and Ducklings: Salmonella\n\nThose cute little chicks and ducklings can be a great attraction for children this time of year, but they can also be a source of illness, so it's important for those who handle them to take steps to prevent infection.\n\nBioterrorism Diseases\n\nList of diseases that may be used in a bioterrorism event, divided into categories depending on the ease of spread and the severity of illness or death they cause. Including Anthrax, Plague, Brucellosis, and Q fever."
