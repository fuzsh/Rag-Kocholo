If your inquiry is escalated for additional assistance, please note that the Contact Center may call customers back between 7 a.m. to 8 p.m., Monday through Saturday.\n\nPassword Resets and Technical Support\n\nVisit the links below for additional information:\n\nHow to Reset My Password\n\nHow Do I Unlock My Online Account?\n\nHow Do I Change My Two-Step Verification Code?\n\nHow Do I Get a New Online Access Code?\n\nHow Can I Delete My USCIS Online Account?\n\nFor additional USCIS Online Account help\n\nFor technical help regarding any of the issues listed above, go to my.uscis.gov/account/v1/needhelp, or you can send us a message from your USCIS online account inbox.\n\nFor FOIA related issues\n\nIf you have questions about FOIA, email us at FOIAPAQuestions@uscis.dhs.gov.\n\nFor myE-Verify related issues\n\nIf you have questions about myE‑Verify, please visit myEverify.\n\nInquiries Based on Filing Location\n\nCase-specific Questions\n\nIf you have a question about your case, you may use our convenient online tools. If you have tried our tools and still need help, you may submit an online case inquiry or call to the USCIS Contact Center. Depending on what information we need to respond to your request, we may forward a service request to the office that is processing your case.\n\nUSCIS Service Centers\n\nThe Service Center Operations Directorate (SCOPS) has five service centers (California, Nebraska, Texas, Vermont, and Potomac) that process and adjudicate certain immigration applications and petitions.\n\nThe National Benefits Center (NBC) processes cases with receipt numbers starting with MSC and NBC*, but it is not a USCIS Service Center. The service centers and the NBC do not provide in-person assistance with questions about your case.\n\nIf you contacted the USCIS Contact Center about a case at one of the USCIS Service Centers or the NBC and they sent a service request to the center processing your case, you should receive a response within 30 days (15 days for expedited requests). If you do not receive a response within this timeframe, or if you believe the response you received was incorrect, you may contact the USCIS Contact Center to have your inquiry elevated.\n\nLockbox\n\nIf you have a question about a filing mailed to the Chicago, Dallas, Phoenix, or Elgin Lockbox you may email us at lockboxsupport@uscis.dhs.gov and we will answer your email as soon as possible.

Before calling the USCIS Contact Center, you should have your receipt notice(s) for the particular form(s) on which you would like to request information or other services for reference during the call. You should also have a copy of the pending or approved application or petition that you are calling about readily available, if possible. If the USCIS Contact Center is unable to provide information or to make the change that you requested, you may be scheduled for an in-person appointment at a USCIS field office.\n\nProtected individuals may also send a secure message from their USCIS online account, and USCIS will call the person to complete the enhanced identity through the specialized verification process. Once a protected person’s identity has been verified through this process, the Contact Center can respond to the inquiry or provide assistance.\n\nPetitioners and applicants may also send signed written inquiries or requests for biometrics appointments, including a new date or time or location, to:\n\nFor cases located at the Vermont Service Center (receipt number begins with EAC):\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n\nVermont Service Center\n\nATTN: Humanitarian Division\n\n38 River Road\n\nEssex Junction, VT 05479-0001\n\nFor cases located at the Nebraska Service Center (receipt number begins with LIN):\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services\n\nNebraska Service Center\n\nATTN: I-918\n\nP.O.
