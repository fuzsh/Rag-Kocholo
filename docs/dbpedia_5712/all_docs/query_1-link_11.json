        "text": "We know that the disease is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which spreads between people in several different ways.\n\nCurrent evidence suggests that the virus spreads mainly between people who are in close contact with each other, for example at a conversational distance. The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).\n\nThe virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission).\n\nPeople may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.\n\nFurther research is ongoing to better understand the spread of the virus and which settings are most risky and why. Research is also under way to study virus variants that are emerging and why some are more transmissible. For updated information on SARS-CoV-2 variants, please read the weekly epidemiologic updates.\n\nWhether or not they have symptoms, infected people can be contagious and the virus can spread from them to other people.\n\nLaboratory data suggests that infected people appear to be most infectious just before they develop symptoms (namely 2 days before they develop symptoms) and early in their illness. People who develop severe disease can be infectious for longer.\n\nWhile someone who never develops symptoms can pass the virus to others, it is still not clear how frequently this occurs and more research is needed in this area.\n\nYes, any situation in which people are in close proximity to one another for long periods of time increases the risk of transmission. Indoor locations, especially settings where there is poor ventilation, are riskier than outdoor locations. Activities where more particles are expelled from the mouth, such as singing or breathing heavily during exercise, also increase the risk of transmission.\n\nThe “Three C’s” are a useful way to think about this. They describe settings where transmission of the COVID-19 virus spreads more easily:\n\nCrowded places;\n\nClose-contact settings, especially where people have conversations very near each other;\n\nConfined and enclosed spaces with poor ventilation.\n\nThe risk of COVID-19 spreading is especially high in places where these “3Cs” overlap.\n\nIn health facilities where people are receiving treatment for COVID-19, there is an increased risk of infection during medical procedures called aerosol generating procedures. These can produce very small droplets that can stay suspended in the air for longer periods of time and spread beyond conversational distances (typically 1 meter). This is why health workers performing these procedures or in settings where these procedures are performed should take specific airborne protection measures, including using appropriate personal protective equipment such as respirators. This is also why visitors are not permitted in areas where these procedures are being performed."
