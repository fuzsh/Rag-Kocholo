        "text": "In addition to Standard Precautions, use Contact Precautions in the care of patients known or suspected to have a serious illness easily transmitted by direct patient contact or by indirect contact with items in the patient’s environment.\n\nIllnesses requiring contact precautions may include, but are not limited to: presence of stool incontinence (may include patients with norovirus, rotavirus, or Clostridium difficile), draining wounds, uncontrolled secretions, pressure ulcers, presence of generalized rash, or presence of ostomy tubes and/or bags draining body fluids.\n\nAdditional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Contact Precautions\n\nContact precautions are in addition to Standard Precautions\n\nPLUS\n\nGloves\n\nWear gloves when touching the patient and the patient’s immediate environment or belongings\n\nRemove gloves promptly after use and discard before touching non-contaminated items or environmental surfaces, and before providing care to another patient\n\nWash hands immediately after removing gloves\n\nPLUS\n\nGowns\n\nWear a fluid resistant, non-sterile gown if substantial contact with the patient or their environment is anticipated\n\nDo not wear the same gown for the care of more than one patient\n\nAdditional Procedures\n\nRoom\n\nPrivate room or cohort, (room) patients infected or colonized with the same organism\n\nPrioritize placement of patients in an exam room if they have stool incontinence, draining wounds and/or skin lesions that cannot be covered, or uncontrolled secretions\n\nPatient\n\nInstruct patients with known or suspected infectious diarrhea to use a separate bathroom, if available; clean/disinfect the bathroom before it can be used again\n\nHow contact transmission occurs:\n\nContact transmission can occur in two ways:\n\nDirect Contact Transmission\n\nIndirect Contact Transmission\n\nContact precautions are required to protect against either direct or indirect transmission.\n\nContact precautions are indicated for persons with gastrointestinal (diarrheal) illness, and incontinent persons including those who use incontinent products.\n\nDirect Contact Transmission\n\nInvolves body-surface to body-surface contact and physical transfer of microorganisms between a susceptible person (host) and an infected or colonized person.\n\nMore often occurs between a health care worker and a patient than between patients.\n\nIndirect Contact Transmission\n\nInvolves contact of susceptible person (host) with a contaminated intermediate object such as needles, dressings, gloves or contaminated (unwashed) hands.\n\nDisease is more likely to develop following direct or indirect contact transmission when the pathogen is highly virulent or has a low infectious dose or the patient or health care worker is immunocompromised.\n\nPoor hand hygiene is most often cited as a cause of contact transmission."
