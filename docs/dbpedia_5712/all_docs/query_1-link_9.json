        "text": "Overview\n\nInfectious Diseases Care at Mayo Clinic\n\nOur caring teams of professionals offer expert care to people with infectious diseases, injuries and illnesses.\n\nInfectious diseases are disorders caused by organisms — such as bacteria, viruses, fungi or parasites. Many organisms live in and on our bodies. They're normally harmless or even helpful. But under certain conditions, some organisms may cause disease.\n\nSome infectious diseases can be passed from person to person. Some are transmitted by insects or other animals. And you may get others by consuming contaminated food or water or being exposed to organisms in the environment.\n\nSigns and symptoms vary depending on the organism causing the infection, but often include fever and fatigue. Mild infections may respond to rest and home remedies, while some life-threatening infections may need hospitalization.\n\nMany infectious diseases, such as measles and chickenpox, can be prevented by vaccines. Frequent and thorough hand-washing also helps protect you from most infectious diseases.\n\nSymptoms\n\nEach infectious disease has its own specific signs and symptoms. General signs and symptoms common to a number of infectious diseases include:\n\nFever\n\nDiarrhea\n\nFatigue\n\nMuscle aches\n\nCoughing\n\nWhen to see a doctor\n\nSeek medical attention if you:\n\nHave been bitten by an animal\n\nAre having trouble breathing\n\nHave been coughing for more than a week\n\nHave severe headache with fever\n\nExperience a rash or swelling\n\nHave unexplained or prolonged fever\n\nHave sudden vision problems\n\nFrom Mayo Clinic to your inbox\n\nSign up for free and stay up to date on research advancements, health tips, current health topics, and expertise on managing health.

If you are a Mayo Clinic patient, this could include protected health information. If we combine this information with your protected health information, we will treat all of that information as protected health information and will only use or disclose that information as set forth in our notice of privacy practices.

These one-cell organisms are responsible for illnesses such as strep throat, urinary tract infections and tuberculosis.\n\nViruses. Even smaller than bacteria, viruses cause a multitude of diseases ranging from the common cold to AIDS.\n\nFungi. Many skin diseases, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, are caused by fungi. Other types of fungi can infect your lungs or nervous system.\n\nParasites. Malaria is caused by a tiny parasite that is transmitted by a mosquito bite. Other parasites may be transmitted to humans from animal feces.\n\nDirect contact\n\nAn easy way to catch most infectious diseases is by coming in contact with a person or an animal with the infection. Infectious diseases can be spread through direct contact such as:\n\nPerson to person. Infectious diseases commonly spread through the direct transfer of bacteria, viruses or other germs from one person to another. This can happen when an individual with the bacterium or virus touches, kisses, or coughs or sneezes on someone who isn't infected.\n\nThese germs can also spread through the exchange of body fluids from sexual contact. The person who passes the germ may have no symptoms of the disease, but may simply be a carrier.\n\nAnimal to person. Being bitten or scratched by an infected animal — even a pet — can make you sick and, in extreme circumstances, can be fatal. Handling animal waste can be hazardous, too. For example, you can get a toxoplasmosis infection by scooping your cat's litter box.\n\nMother to unborn child. A pregnant woman may pass germs that cause infectious diseases to her unborn baby. Some germs can pass through the placenta or through breast milk. Germs in the vagina can also be transmitted to the baby during birth.\n\nIndirect contact\n\nDisease-causing organisms also can be passed by indirect contact. Many germs can linger on an inanimate object, such as a tabletop, doorknob or faucet handle.\n\nWhen you touch a doorknob handled by someone ill with the flu or a cold, for example, you can pick up the germs he or she left behind. If you then touch your eyes, mouth or nose before washing your hands, you may become infected.\n\nInsect bites\n\nSome germs rely on insect carriers — such as mosquitoes, fleas, lice or ticks — to move from host to host. These carriers are known as vectors. Mosquitoes can carry the malaria parasite or West Nile virus. Deer ticks may carry the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.\n\nFood contamination\n\nDisease-causing germs can also infect you through contaminated food and water. This mechanism of transmission allows germs to be spread to many people through a single source. Escherichia coli (E. coli), for example, is a bacterium present in or on certain foods — such as undercooked hamburger or unpasteurized fruit juice.\n\nRisk factors\n\nWhile anyone can catch infectious diseases, you may be more likely to get sick if your immune system isn't working properly. This may occur if:\n\nYou're taking steroids or other medications that suppress your immune system, such as anti-rejection drugs for a transplanted organ\n\nYou have HIV or AIDS\n\nYou have certain types of cancer or other disorders that affect your immune system\n\nIn addition, certain other medical conditions may predispose you to infection, including implanted medical devices, malnutrition and extremes of age, among others.\n\nComplications\n\nMost infectious diseases have only minor complications. But some infections — such as pneumonia, AIDS and meningitis — can become life-threatening. A few types of infections have been linked to a long-term increased risk of cancer:\n\nHuman papillomavirus is linked to cervical cancer\n\nHelicobacter pylori is linked to stomach cancer and peptic ulcers\n\nHepatitis B and C have been linked to liver cancer\n\nIn addition, some infectious diseases may become silent, only to appear again in the future — sometimes even decades later. For example, someone who's had chickenpox may develop shingles much later in life.\n\nPrevention\n\nFeb 18, 2022\n\nFacts about infectious disease.
