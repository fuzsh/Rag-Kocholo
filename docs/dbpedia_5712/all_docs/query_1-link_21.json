        "text": "North Carolina's health care community is ready to identify and respond to a case of Ebola.\n\nAn Ebola public information line has been established by Carolinas Poison Center. Please call 1-844-836-8714 for questions about Ebola.\n\nCurrent updates on the outbreak in Uganda\n\nAbout Ebola Virus Disease\n\nEbola, previously known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever, is a rare and deadly disease caused by infection with one of the Ebola virus strains. Ebola can cause disease in humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, gorillas, and chimpanzees).\n\nEbola is caused by infection with a virus of the family Filoviridae, genus Ebolavirus. There are five identified Ebola virus species, four of which are known to cause disease in humans: Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus); Sudan virus (Sudan ebolavirus); Taï Forest virus (Taï Forest ebolavirus, formerly Côte d’Ivoire ebolavirus); and Bundibugyo virus (Bundibugyo ebolavirus). The fifth, Reston virus (Reston ebolavirus), has caused disease in nonhuman primates, but not in humans.\n\nEbola viruses are found in several African countries. Ebola was first discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, outbreaks have appeared sporadically in Africa.\n\nThe natural reservoir host of Ebola virus remains unknown. However, on the basis of evidence and the nature of similar viruses, researchers believe that the virus is animal-borne and that bats are the most likely reservoir. Four of the five virus strains occur in an animal host native to Africa.\n\nSource: CDC.gov\n\nInformation for the Public\n\nEbola is only contagious after the onset of symptoms. The incubation period before symptoms may appear is 2-21 days, with 8-10 days being the most common. Ebola is spread through unprotected contact with blood or body fluids from someone who is infected. Anyone who becomes ill within 21 days after traveling to an affected area in West Africa should contact a healthcare provider right away and limit their contact with others until they have been evaluated.\n\nEbola is spread through direct contact (through broken skin or through your eyes, nose, or mouth) with\n\nBlood and body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of a person who is sick with Ebola.\n\nObjects (like needles) that have been contaminated with the blood or body fluids of a person sick with Ebola.\n\nEbola is not spread through the air, water, or food.\n\nThere is no FDA-approved vaccine available for Ebola. Experimental vaccines and treatments for Ebola are under development, but they have not yet been fully tested for safety or effectiveness.\n\nSymptoms of Ebola\n\nFever\n\nSevere headache\n\nMuscle pain\n\nWeakness\n\nDiarrhea\n\nVomiting\n\nAbdominal pain\n\nUnexplained bleeding or bruising\n\nTo protect yourself from Ebola\n\nDo wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.\n\nDo NOT touch the blood or body fluids (like urine, feces, saliva, vomit, sweat, and semen) of people who are sick.\n\nDo NOT handle items that may have come in contact with a sick person’s blood or body fluids, like clothes, bedding, needles, or medical equipment.\n\nDo NOT touch the body of someone who has died of Ebola.\n\nCDC: CDC Ebola Information\n\nInformation for Providers\n\nThis section is intended to provide updated information to all North Carolina health care providers and laboratories regarding Ebola virus disease (EVD) and management of suspected cases.\n\nPhysicians are required to contact their local health department or the state Communicable Disease Branch (919-733-3419) as soon as Ebola or any other hemorrhagic fever virus infection is reasonably suspected.\n\nNCDHHS: North Carolina Ebola Guidance for Non-hospital Healthcare Settings\n\nNCDHHS: Identity, Isolate, Inform: Ambulatory Care Evaluation of Patients with Possible Ebola\n\nNCDHHS: Ebola Algorithm for Evaluation of the Returned Traveler\n\nNCDHHS: Travel Advisory for Patient Waiting Rooms and Triage Areas - English, French, Spanish\n\nAdditional Information\n\nCDC: CDC Ebola Information\n\nContact\n\nCommunicable Disease Branch\n\nTelephone: (919) 733-3419 (main number; 24 hours)"
