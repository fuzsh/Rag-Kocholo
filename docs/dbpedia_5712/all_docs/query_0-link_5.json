        "text": "Welcome\n\nWelcome to Module 2: Chain of Infection. We are glad you're here!\n\nWhat you learn in this class will help keep you, and your residents, safe.\n\nModule 2 will present a broad overview of the chain of infection and how pathogens are transmitted.\n\nTo navigate through the course, please continue to use the arrow keys in the upper left corner of each page or utilize the prompts on the bottom left of each page.\n\nPrevious Page - Go to the previous page\n\nNext Page - Go to the next page\n\nTo access a specific page, click on the desired page number at the top of the screen.\n\nThroughout the training, you will have the opportunity to click on highlighted words to view the definition, or to click on hyperlinks to view external sources.\n\nThis course is designed to increase your infection control knowledge in long-term care environments. Information from this CBT can be directly applied to your daily activities as a nurse aide.\n\nThis course has five modules. You must save or print the certificate at the end of each module. Keep these certificates as proof of completion.\n\nModule 1: Introduction to Pathogens\n\nModule 2: Chain of Infection/Modes of Transmission\n\nModule 3: PPE\n\nModule 4: Standard and Transmission-based Precautions\n\nModule 5: Cleaning and Disinfection\n\nThere is no way to create a lost certificate of completion without taking or retaking the course. If you do not keep a copy for your records, you will need to repeat this course.\n\nLet's get started!\n\nThe chain of infection is a set of 6 intertwined links that allow for communicable diseases to spread.\n\nEach step of the chain is required to effectively transmit infectious illness.\n\nBreaking any one of the 6 links can slow the spread of infectious disease.\n\nIn humans, there are two forms of reservoirs: Symptomatic infection and asymptomatic carriers.\n\nSymptomatic infections are more likely to be recognized. This means that the patient's contacts and normal activities will normally be restricted.\n\nCarriers do not display any signs or symptoms of illness. They are asymptomatic but can still spread disease (like Typhoid Mary )\n\nDroplet transmission requires a pathogen to be transferred through the air from its reservoir in a droplet of body secretions. These droplets are relatively large and usually will fall from suspension after 3-6 feet of travel. The droplets will rapidly fall on nearby surfaces (tables, door knobs, telephones, elevator buttons, etc.), and may remain viable. The survivability of the pathogen depends on its type. Some pathogens will live for a few minutes to hours, while others may survive for a few days, outside of a host.\n\nSome pathogens are transmitted directly through blood. These pathogens require that infected blood from the reservoir be directly exposed to the blood of the susceptible host.\n\nThis can be accomplished by blood from a needlestick and blood entering mucous membranes or other open wounds.\n\nExamples of blood-borne pathogens include:\n\nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)\n\nHepatitis-B Virus\n\nHepatitis-C Virus\n\nAirborne transmission occurs when pathogens smaller than five microns in size remain suspended in the air long after the infected person has left the area. A host then enters the space where the pathogen is suspended and has the potential to become infected.\n\nAn example of an airborne illness is measles. Measles can remain suspended in the air for up to 18 hours after the infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks.\n\nTuberculosis can remain suspended for up to six hours.\n\nThe last link in the chain of infection is the susceptible host. This is the organism (e.g., You or your resident!) that will feel the effects of the infectious disease that has traveled through the chain of infection.\n\nStopping disease spread at the source may be an appropriate intervention for many pathogens found in long-term care facilities.\n\nThe first step at breaking the chain is to identify the offending pathogen. This will allow for treatment protocols specific to the disease-causing microorganism.\n\nExamples include:\n\nA patient with a bacterial infection, like strep throat, can be treated with antibiotics to clear the infection.\n\nA patient who is an asymptomatic carrier may also be treated to clear the infection and prevent spread to others.\n\nCooking food to safe temperatures ensures that all bacteria and/or spores have been killed before consumption.\n\nIncreasing the host's defense allows for the body's immune system to fend off attacking pathogens before the person ever knows they have been exposed.\n\nVaccination programs help the body to create antibodies to targeted pathogens before exposure.\n\nProphylactic drug use for high-risk patients can help to mitigate the spread of disease by preventing a pathogen from gaining ground over the immune system.\n\nSome interventions attempt to prevent a pathogen from encountering a susceptible host.\n\nHerd immunity suggests that if a high enough percentage of individuals in a population are resistant to a pathogen, then those few who are susceptible will be protected by the resistant majority.\n\nThe theory is that the pathogen will not have a sufficient number of reservoirs available to survive until it finds a susceptible host.\n\nFINAL STEPS\n\nPlease review your score.\n\nSave or print your certificate for your records.\n\nRemember, there is no way to create a lost certificate of completion without retaking the course. If you do not keep a copy for your records, you will need to repeat this course.\n\nTHANK YOU!\n\nNext up:\n\nModule 3: PPE"
