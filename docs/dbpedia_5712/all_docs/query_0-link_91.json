        "text": "STDs from toilet seats\n\nGerms in restrooms may concern you. So, you may want to learn about the viruses , bacteria, and parasites that can survive on bathroom surfaces and identify ways you can avoid taking those germs with you.\n\nWhen wondering what diseases you can catch in restrooms, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) — also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) — may be one of your greatest concerns.\n\nSTDs mainly transmit through vaginal, anal, and oral sex, and sometimes, during activities like:‌\n\nChildbirth\n\nPregnancy\n\nBreastfeeding\n\nKissing‌\n\nSharing needles\n\nMost STDs don’t transmit through:\n\nRestroom toilet seats\n\nOther hard surfaces\n\nShaking hands or hugging\n\nUsing the same towels or dishes as someone‌\n\nInsect bites\n\n‌‌But there may be some that you may need to be careful about.\n\nBacterial STDs\n\nThese diseases include chlamydia , gonorrhea, and syphilis. Bacteria that cause STDs live in the mucous membranes around your penis, vagina, anus, and mouth. But they can’t survive for long outside the mucous membranes.\n\nViral STDs\n\nIf an STD is viral, it can spread outside the mucus membranes and to other skin cells. The viruses that cause STDs don’t spread far but can survive on porous skin near your mucous membranes. Viral STDs include:\n\nHepatitis B\n\nHerpes simplex‌\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus — or HIV\n\nHuman papillomavirus — or HPV\n\nParasitic STDs\n\nSome STDs are caused by live parasites like trichomoniasis and pubic lice — also called crabs . Parasitic STDs can happen on surfaces including:\n\nToilet seats\n\nTowels\n\nClothing\n\nBedsheets‌\n\nBlankets\n\nThe only way to get a parasitic STD is for your genitals to come into direct contact with a toilet seat while a live parasite is present there. But, this may happen in rare cases because parasites can’t live for a long time on hard surfaces like toilet seats. Still, they do live longer than viruses and bacteria.\n\nExceptions to the rule\n\nYou are not likely to catch a viral or bacterial disease on a toilet seat. Physical contact has to be “back-to-back” for you to contract a bacterial or viral infection from a toilet seat.\n\nA person’s genitals have to come into direct contact with the toilet seat surface. You have to then sit with your genitals in the exact same place soon after the original transmission happened.\n\nTo contract viruses like HIV , you must have an open wound for the virus to reach your bloodstream. Your open wound has to be in direct contact with the same surface soon after another person’s genitals touched it.\n\nGenital herpes can spread from an infected person even if they don' ;t have sores. As with HIV, your genitals would have to come into direct contact with a surface very soon after an infected person. Transmission of genital herpes in restrooms and on toilet seats is very unlikely.\n\nProtecting yourself from restroom diseases\n\nIt’s always a good idea to take precautions to prevent disease transmission in restrooms. Wipe off the toilet seat in a public restroom before sitting on it. You can also use toilet paper or a toilet seat cover to prevent direct contact with your skin. Sit down carefully to prevent your genitals from touching the seat directly.\n\nNot everyone washes their hands after using the restroom — but you should. Ensuring that your hands are completely clean before leaving the restroom helps you stop norovirus transmission.\n\nAfter washing your hands, dry them off using a paper towel or an air dryer. Avoid touching the faucet again with your hands to turn it off. If possible, use a paper towel to turn off the water and open the door handle to leave the restroom. If that’s not possible, use your elbow to turn off the faucet. Also, use your elbow or foot to open the door.\n\nNot all restrooms have paper towels. As a precaution, carry tissues on your person. Hold one in your hand when you touch restroom surfaces to prevent disease transmission.\n\nIf you think you may have an STD or other illness, talk to your doctor about your symptoms right away. Early treatment is key to getting better quickly. If left untreated, STDs may lead to other health concerns.\n\n‌"
