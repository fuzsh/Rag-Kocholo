        "text": "What are bacterial infections?\n\nA bacterium is a single, but complex, cell. It can survive on its own, inside or outside the body.\n\nMost bacteria aren’t harmful. In fact, we have many bacteria inside our body and on our skin. Bacteria in our intestines (gut) help us to digest our food.\n\nBut some bacteria can cause infections. Bacterial infections can affect many parts of your body, including your:\n\nthroat\n\nlungs\n\nskin\n\nbowel\n\nMany infections are mild, but some are severe.\n\nSome examples of bacterial infections are:\n\nLegionnaires’ disease\n\nmeningococcal disease\n\nQ fever\n\nstrep throat\n\ntuberculosis (TB)\n\nwhooping cough (pertussis)\n\nOther causes of infectious diseases are viruses, parasites and fungi.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of a bacterial infection?\n\nThe symptoms of a bacterial infection depend on the location of your infection and the type of bacteria involved.\n\nThere are some general signs of bacterial infection:\n\nfever\n\nfeeling tired\n\nswollen lymph nodes in your neck, armpits, groin or elsewhere\n\nheadache\n\nnausea or vomiting\n\nCHECK YOUR SYMPTOMS — Use the Symptom Checker and find out if you need to seek medical help.\n\nWhat causes bacterial infections?\n\nBacterial infections occur when bacteria enter your body. Once in your body they increase in number. This causes an immune reaction in your body.\n\nBacteria can enter your body through:\n\na cut on your skin\n\neating or drinking contaminated food or water\n\nbreathing in droplets from an infected person\n\ntouching dirty surfaces and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth\n\nBacteria can also be transmitted by contact with blood and other bodily fluids.\n\nBacterial infections and weather events\n\nThe risk of getting a bacterial infection increases when you are in contact with flood water. Flood water can come from storms or cyclones.\n\nTouching items affected by flooding can also increase your risk of bacterial infection. You should avoid contact with flood water and practice good hand hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and clean water. If clean water isn’t available, use hand sanitiser.\n\nWhen should I see my doctor?\n\nSigns that you have a bacterial infection depend on the type of bacteria and the part of your body that is infected. You should see your doctor if you have:\n\na persistent fever or chills\n\nsevere headache or neck stiffness\n\neye redness and crusting (pus)\n\npersistent ear pain or wetness (discharge)\n\npersistent facial pain and runny nose\n\ndifficulty breathing\n\na persistent cough, or coughing up blood or pus\n\nfrequent vomiting and trouble holding liquids down\n\nsevere stomach pain\n\nblood or mucus in your poo (stool)\n\ndiscomfort when urinating (doing a wee) or urine that is smelly, cloudy or contains blood\n\nany abnormal genital discharge\n\nunexplained skin redness or swelling\n\na skin wound that is red, hot, swollen, or has pus\n\na rash that doesn’t fade when you press it\n\ndifficulty eating or drinking\n\nunexplained weight loss\n\nFIND A HEALTH SERVICE — The Service Finder can help you find doctors, pharmacies, hospitals and other health services.\n\nASK YOUR DOCTOR — Preparing for an appointment? Use the Question Builder for general tips on what to ask your GP or specialist.\n\nHow are bacterial infections treated?\n\nSerious bacterial infections can be effectively treated with antibiotics. These medicines either kill the bacteria or stop them multiplying. This helps your body’s immune system fight the bacteria.\n\nYour doctor’s choice of antibiotic will depend on the bacteria that is causing your infection.\n\nAntibiotics that work against a wide range of bacteria are called broad-spectrum antibiotics.\n\nAntibiotic resistance is a growing problem so antibiotics must always be used appropriately and as prescribed.\n\nHow can bacterial infections be prevented?\n\nBacterial infections can be highly contagious. Bacterial infections are spread between people through:\n\ncoughing\n\nsneezing\n\nvomiting\n\nbodily fluids, from sex or sharing dirty needles\n\nYou need to take special care to avoid spreading infections by:\n\nwashing your hands properly\n\ncovering up when sneezing and coughing\n\nnot sharing cups and drink bottles\n\nhaving safe sex\n\nnot sharing needles\n\nComplications of bacterial infections\n\nIt’s important to seek treatment because untreated bacterial infections can lead to serious problems. For example, an untreated infected cut can cause cellulitis, a spreading skin infection.\n\nUntreated bacterial infections can sometimes lead to serious, life-threatening conditions.\n\nSepticaemia is a serious blood infection. It is when bacteria enter the bloodstream and cause blood poisoning.\n\nSepsis is a condition that happens when the body damages its own tissues in response to a bad infection. Sepsis can cause shock, organ failure and death if it’s not treated quickly.\n\nSepsis is a medical emergency and can be fatal if not treated quickly. If you suspect you or someone else has sepsis, call triple zero (000) for an ambulance.\n\nAsk your doctor ‘Could this be sepsis?’ if:\n\nyou are feeling very unwell\n\nyou are not getting better from a generalised illness\n\nyou are quickly getting worse\n\nthere is any chance of an infection\n\nyou are more concerned about your child than you normally are when they are sick\n\nResources and support\n\nYou can download the app Could this be sepsis? from the Australian Sepsis Network (ASN), to check your symptoms.\n\nYou can find out more about what Australia is doing to limit antimicrobial resistance here.\n\nYou can call the healthdirect helpline on 1800 022 222 (known as NURSE-ON-CALL in Victoria). A registered nurse is available to speak with 24 hours a day, 7 days a week."
