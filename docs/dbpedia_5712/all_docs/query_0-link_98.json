        "text": "Transmission of Hepatitis B\n\nThe hepatitis B virus is transmitted through blood and sexual fluids. This can most commonly occur in the following ways:\n\nDirect contact with infected blood\n\nFrom an infected pregnant person to their newborn during pregnancy and childbirth\n\nNeedles and other medical/dental equipments or procedures that are contaminated or not sterile\n\nUnprotected sex\n\nUse of illegal or “street” drugs\n\nBody piercing, tattooing, acupuncture and even nail salons are other potential routes of infection unless sterile needles and equipment are used. In addition, sharing sharp instruments such as razors, toothbrushes, nail clippers, earrings and body jewelry can be a source of infection.\n\nHepatitis B is NOT transmitted casually. It cannot be spread through toilet seats, doorknobs, sneezing, coughing, hugging or eating meals with someone who is infected with hepatitis B.\n\nHigh-Risk Groups\n\nThe hepatitis B virus can infect infants, children, teens and adults. It is not a genetic disease – it is an infectious disease that is transmitted through blood. Although everyone may be at risk for a hepatitis B infection during their lifetime, there are groups of people who are at higher risk because of where they were born, their occupation or life choices.\n\nThe following is a guide for screening high-risk groups for hepatitis B, but the list certainly doesn't represent all potential risk factors.\n\nHealth care providers and emergency responders\n\nSexually active individuals (more than 1 partner in the past six months)\n\nMen who have sex with men\n\nIndividuals diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease\n\nIllicit drug users (injecting, inhaling, snorting, pill popping)\n\nSexual partners or those living in close household contact with an infected person\n\nIndividuals born in countries where hepatitis B is common (Asia, Africa, South America, Pacific Islands, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East)\n\nIndividuals born to parents who have emigrated from countries where hepatitis B is common (see #7)\n\nChildren adopted from countries where hepatitis B is common (see #7)\n\nAdoptive families of children from countries where hepatitis B is common (see #7)\n\nAnyone diagnosed with cancer prior to initiation of anticancer treatment\n\nKidney dialysis patients and those in early kidney (renal) failure\n\nInmates and staff of a correctional facility\n\nResidents and staff of facilities for developmentally disabled persons\n\nALL pregnant women"
