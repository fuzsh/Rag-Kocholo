Dhool is a good vs evil film about a man Aarumugam (played by Vikram) and his accomplices’ fight against corrupt politicians, dirty cops and gangsters to fulfil the basic needs of his village. In order to teach a lesson to one of the above villains, Aarumugam and his team execute a plan to release a statement saying that the politician (played by Shayaji Shinde) was a big fan of the fictional adult film “Paapa Poatta Thaapa”, starring Shakila (of course). A riot ensues, where the politician gets scolded by his seniors in the outfit and his wife and children leaves his house.
