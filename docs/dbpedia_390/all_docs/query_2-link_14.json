        "text": "This comparative study arose from the remark of a young “ascetic” (faqīr) I met in Sehwan (Sindh Province), who will be referred to here as ‘Alī Footnote 1 . He had invited me in 2014 to join him at his family home in Lahore (Punjab)Footnote 2 shortly before the beginning of the commemoration of the martyrdom of Husain and his followers in Karbala in AD 680, named “Muharram.”Footnote 3 Implicitly referring to our shared knowledge of the Sehwan rituals,Footnote 4 he said to me, “You will see that here [in Lahore] Muharram is celebrated better [than in Sehwan]; there is much more sadness (bahut zīādā gham). For those familiar with Muharram, its association with sadness is a truism. Indeed, the new moon of muharram ushers in a 40-day period of sadness,Footnote 5 the public display of which is specific to the Shi’ite community “generally known as a ‘community of mourners.’”Footnote 6 Having other targets for my fieldwork in Lahore than Muharram (a coincidence of timing), I settled for a distracted “why?” ‘Alī’s answer, “There are more mātam” [‘physical acts of mourning’ unique to Muharram], seemed to me at the time just as conventional and unoriginal as sadness. Today, his remark catches my attention, because it implies that emotion is a criterion of evaluation, of judgement, which makes it possible to establish appreciable and shareable hierarchies beyond the individuality of each person.\n\nHistorians and sociologists, following Émile DurkheimFootnote 7 who associated emotion and religious experience, have also made emotions an object of study.Footnote 8 In contrast to psychologists, they have apprehended them as “dispositions that we cultivate”Footnote 9 and have thus given back to the passive subject of psychologists its active part “to be moved or to resist emotion.”Footnote 10 For anthropologists, emotions are also “a singular way – but not individual – of relating to the collective, to the world, to others”Footnote 11 and of negotiating the relationship with oneself.Footnote 12 If we consider emotions as “modes of defining and negotiating social relations and the self in a moral order”Footnote 13 (Ibid.: 282–83), we need to question the way ‘Alī defines himself in relation to the world around him.\n\n‘Alī presents himself as a malañg, that is an ascetic of the Qalandarī Sufi orderFootnote 14 and a momin (“believer”). Footnote 15 In both respects, he is opposed to his birth background, as he was born into a Sunni family affiliated with the Naqshbandiyyā order. Footnote 16 His conversion to Shi’ism was based on a twofold process. On the one hand, the influence of his Shi’ite “aunt” (māmī)Footnote 17 who raised him, and on the other hand his mystical commitment to Lāl Shahbāz QalandarFootnote 18 and his companion Bodlo Bahār at Sehwan, which involves paying allegiance to a Shi’ite spiritual master and to the Prophet’s Family and the Shi’ite Imams. His position in Sehwan is that of an ascetic, while in Lahore it is that of a Shi’ite from a popular and outlying neighbourhood (Thokar Niaz Baig). “Alī’s dual position reflected my own. Indeed, my hosts had given me different positions in Sehwan and Lahore, resulting in the production of two ethnographies, one unbalanced in relation to the other, on the basis of which I aim to construct a comparison in this article. For Sehwan’s Muharram, I have a relatively complete and detailed ethnography, based on an in-depth knowledge of local society.Footnote 19 To put it in Mauss’ terms “I know what people do there and who they are.”Footnote 20 In contrast, my observations of Muharram in Thokar Niaz Baig, a neighbourhood that has remained unfamiliar to me, are lacunar. They are reduced to the few rituals in which AuntFootnote 21 and I took part, with no precise idea of their place in the chronology of commemoration, nor of their organizers.Footnote 22 So my view of this Muharram is fragmented and gendered. Although this imbalance is not a priori optimal for comparison, it has proved heuristic. It prompted me to shift my gaze on ritual, from collective mobilization to personal action on the one hand, and to rethink relationships to the self and to the worldFootnote 23 as a function of place and context on the other, and consequently to the various possibilities of (being) experienced (by) the rituals."
