        "text": "DHOOL KA PHOOL is about the searing stigma of illegitimacy and an impassioned plea for communal harmony. Roshan is the illegitimate and abandoned son of Mahesh and Meena, who is brought up by a kind old man, Abdul chacha who finds the little child.\n\nMeanwhile, Mahesh has moved on in life, not only happily married becoming the now illegitimate father of Ramesh but also a respected magistrate. Meena, on the other hand, tries to forget her past by marrying a kind-hearted lawyer, Jagdish. Three lives whose path it seems has gone three separate directions... till life takes over and makes their paths cross. Do Mahesh and Meena recognize their long-lost son? Will Abdul chacha have to give up his darling son to his \"real\" parents? Will Roshan ever shake off the scars of illegitimacy?\n\nDHOOL KA PHOOL was the debut film of Yash Chopra, a remarkable one for more than one reason. An unconventional story, coupled with powerful performances won the film four Filmfare award nominations - Best Story - Pt. Mukhram Sharma, Best Lyrics - Sahir Ludhianvi, Best Actress - Mala Sinha and Best supporting role - Manmohan Krishna who won the award for his role as Abdul chacha. It elevated Mala Sinha to a dramatic star and is counted as one of Rajendra Kumar's best films. Truly an amazing debut for a man who was to become one of Hindi cinema's greatest film-makers."
