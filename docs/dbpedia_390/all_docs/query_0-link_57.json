        "text": "Multi-talented UK based singer MILAN releases his 2nd track ‘GREEN EYEZ’ released worldwide on the 26thSeptember 2022.\n\nProduced by Desi Lion Records, Lyrics by LOVE, music by Notorious Jatt. Video was shot in the UK, based on a love story which follows the path of both girl and boy love relationship.\n\nIn 2021 we saw MILAN’S release produced by award winning producer Aman Hayer, ‘BAI CHAMKILA’ which proved to be a international success.\n\n2022/2023 will see MILAN take the music industry by storm with releases with major music producers and performances at events and festivals.\n\nMILAN Q & A\n\n1. What skills have you learned that will help you in your singing career?\n\n- I have learnt how to effectively do ‘Riaz’ on the harmonium which in my opinion is probably the best skillset needed further my career. To add to this, any new song that I take on I ensure that I know the lyrics inside out before coming to the studio as this confidence comes through on the vocals. Once the song is mastered, I then know where to breathe and where to push the emotion on the song.\n\n2. What made you decide to pursue a career in entertainment?\n\n- I have always had a keen interest in music since a very young age, my grandfather used to listen to legends like Kuldip Manak, Mohd. Saddiq, Amar Singh Chamkila, and this inspired by goal to become a Folk/Bhangra singer. I started off as a dhol player playing at events and then went on to DJ, but I felt that my true passion was to become a singer. I am very proud of my Punjabi heritage and background and enjoy promoting it to others who perhaps are not that in touch. All these factors had a role to play in my decision to become an entertainer.\n\n3. What kind of singer would you classify yourself as?\n\n- I would definitely classify myself as a Punjabi Folk singer. From a young age I have idolised singers like Amar Singh Chamkila ji and Kuldip Manak Ji, who became my inspiration in singing. Listening to the power and passion in their voice has always pushed me to be better and to follow in their footsteps.\n\n4. What has been the best performance of your career so far?\n\n- My first album ‘Fatal Fuzion’ released back in 2007 and for years after that I performed at Mela’s and shows but the one that always pops into mind is Leicester Mela. There must have been over 1000’s of people there and they were amazing. I got a great reaction for a then ‘new artist’ and the buzz was amazing.\n\n5.What first got you into music/singing?\n\n- Listening to my grandad’s old Kuldip Manak records. I used to try and mimic his voice and style and really appreciated the talent he had which led to me being interested in releasing music of my own. I’ve been a keen bhangra fan since as young as I can remember and have collected many Bhangra cassettes/records over the years. It’s also this passion/hobby that lit the creativity within me.\n\n6.Who inspired you to become a singer?\n\n- I was heavily inspired Kuldip Manak Ji at first, and then Amar Singh Chamkila, both of which were great folk singers of their time. The tone in their voice and the style that they presented their music to the audience always had me captivated and later on led me follow in their footsteps – albeit early stages.\n\n7.How would you describe the song’s that you typically create?\n\n- I would like to believe that the songs that I create have an element of folk in them mixed with the current style of music. Bearing in mind that as an entertainer your fanbase and what the audience wants counts the most as they are the ones that make you into who you are. Hence why in this day and age in the UK you cannot purely be a folk singer without the addition of urban/western elements.\n\n8.What is your creative process like?\n\n- Whenever I am on the hunt to create new music or looking for inspiration for my next track, I always refer back to the legends Chamkila and Manak. Something in their music always leads me to want to re-create a similar flavour and bring back a lost sound or vibe. Once this process has been kick started it’s only a matter of time that western influences creep in.\n\n9.Who would you most like to collaborate with?\n\n- In the past I have had the pleasure to collaborate with legends such as Aman Hayer, I now look to collaborate on a vocal level with some of the female vocalists making their mark in today’s music. I already have a duet song written and would love to have Gurlez Akhtar on the track, or perhaps the likes of Sudesh Kumari, Parven Bharta, Amrita Virk etc.. I am always looking for that old school folk touch from the bygone era.\n\n10..If you could go open a show for any artist who would it be?\n\n- I am an avid fan of Babbu Maan and in today’s music culture I love his style so it would be him. Otherwise in Punjab am I close with the Legend Ranjit Mani and given the opportunity would love to open a show for him.\n\n11.What is one message you would give to your fans?\n\n- To never forget your Punjabi culture and roots, this is something I strongly promote. If you don’t know how to speak your mother tongue, learn it, it’s never too late. It is something that made my family proud and friends shocked at the level of knowledge I have, whether it be where certain pinds are in Punjab or how to explain something fluently in proper accent. Keep our mother tongue alive!\n\n12.What is the most useless talent you have?\n\n- Talking continuously without taking a breath to get my point in on an argument!\n\n13.Do you sing in the shower? What songs?\n\n- 100%! Pehle Lalkare Naal, Tere Tille Ton, Sajna de Naal Dhoka.. You get the drift!\n\n14.What would you be doing right now, if it wasn’t for your music career?\n\n- I would probably be a professional dhol player, I do miss the beat and creating new sounds. It’s a shame I am now out of practise, maybe one day I will get back into it.\n\n15.How do you feel the Internet has impacted the music business?\n\n- Very harshly! I guess everyone is talking about piracy and downloading, since the internet boom the whole listening culture has changed. Simple things like going to your local Cassette/CD shop to buy a new album are a thing of the past. People can now get tracks on their smart phones, both illegally and legally, and it always hits the artist in the pocket, it is a shame.\n\n16.What is your favourite song to perform?\n\n- Probably one from my debut album ‘Fatal Fuzion’ called Reshmi Rumaal, it was a cover of Amar Singh Chamkila’s song. The vibe in that track just makes you want to dance around the stage and give the best performance ever!\n\n17. Which famous musicians do you admire?\n\n- I believe talented musicians like Bhota Jagpal, Suki Chand, Kam frantic, Tubsy have so much skill and creativity it’s hard not to admire what they have done for UK Bhangra.\n\n18.What is the most trouble you’ve ever gotten into?\n\n- Multiple speeding fines in the past?\n\n19.What is the best advice you’ve been given?\n\n- Never give up, even if you fail and fail again the statistic of doing great the next time always gets better.\n\n20. If you could change anything about the industry, what would it be?\n\n- Favourability and Greed, unfortunately as with any profession it’s kind of who know and how much money you have that will get you anywhere. Rather than pure hard work and rising above the ranks.\n\n21. What’s next for you?\n\n- I have just come back from India and shot another music video and recorded vocals for another track which I am preparing for release straight after this one, should be a banger!"
