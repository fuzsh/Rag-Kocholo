        "text": "New Delhi:Â Udegi Dhool, a political thriller that chronicles the spectacular rise of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, will premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival next month.\n\nDirected by Khushboo Ranka and Vinay Shukla, Udegi Dhool, which is 95 minutes long, has been distilled from 400 hours of real behind-the-scenes footage shot through a year.\n\n“India is the biggest consumer of news and film and yet journalism informs so little of our cinema,” Ranka said in a statement.\n\n“We worked as ordinary citizens armed with the tools of journalism - a camera, a mic and curiosity,” said Shukla.\n\nThe movie, which was in post-production for two years, sneaks viewers into the middle of heated arguments and campaign strategies of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).\n\nProduced by Anand Gandhi, director of the internationally acclaimed and National Award winning classic Ship of Theseus, Udegi DhoolÂ unfolds like a political thriller.\n\nIt follows activists, politicians and academics on their best days and their worst, as they navigate the absurdities, trials and chaos of Indian politics and as they reveal their agenda, intentions and ambitions.\n\nIt was previously titled Proposition for a Revolution, and was supported by a crowd funding campaign in India. The Toronto festival will be held from 8-18 September."
