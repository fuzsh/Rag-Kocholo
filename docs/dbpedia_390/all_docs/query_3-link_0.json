It's only that there's nothing new that \"Dhool\" offers. But as long as the till keeps ringing, little else matters, you suppose\".[14] Sify wrote, \"Vikram's Dhool is a typical omnibus masala concoction serving all the nine rasas that go into a typical pot-boiler meant for the front-benchers. The verdict right away is not bad, if you are the type who love unadulterated kichidi entertainers. Still it could have been a whole lot better, if the climax hadn't gone irrevocably loony\".[15] Visual Dasan of Kalki called the film a same old commercial film which entertains citing dosa served as pizza while praising the performances of all star cast and concluded saying Dharani, the director who has given importance to the message of giving pizza to be baked in a bullet train that is moving at a stormy speed, like ginger juice for digestion, can now be called an action director.[16] The film became a major success and cemented Vikram's status as a matinée idol in Tamil Nadu.[17]\n\nRemakes\n\n[edit]\n\nDhool was remade in Telugu as Veede (2003), with Reema Sen reprising her role,[18]. A Hindi remake was planned by Guddu Dhanoa in 2004 with Sunny Deol and Gracy Singh starring, but did not materialise.[19][20]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nRanja, a 2014 Sri Lankan remake\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
