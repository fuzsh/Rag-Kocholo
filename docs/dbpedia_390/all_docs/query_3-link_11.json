A chemical factory in the village pollutes the local river and when all attempts to stop the factory waste from going to the drinking water falls flat, the villagers decide to send Arumugham to Chennai and meet the concerned minister who has won from their constituency. He sets out for the city with Easwari and her grandmother and they stay with Arumugham's friend and gang.",

        "text": "consistently, immediately pleasurable example of modern masala film making, grounded by two near-perfect star turns by atypical heroes (vikram and jyothika) and a narrative through line (illiterate hick vikram accompanies super-smart jyothika to big city to lobby against factory contaminating their drinking water, and are immediately enmeshed in tax and voter fraud and gang violence) strong enough to lend real weight to the fight - song - sentiment formula.\n\nand of course kept thinking that in 2016 the idea of a village superhero fighting against his elected representative for potable drinking water has real legs for an american viewer....\n\nI'm gonna run out of good vikram films to watch and I'm already mourning the day that comes.... what an unexpected surprise this movie ended up being. heroism in the everyday, ordinary people enacting meaningful change for the wellbeing of their community. plenty of other things that I enjoyed, I laughed at a lot of the gags, juvenile maybe but totally my humor, the action was the right amount & I liked it even when vikram spun mid-air like a cyclone to match the lyrics cause y'know why not? also the soundtrack!!!!! immensely enjoyable all around. the playschool banter between arumugam and eeswari was so cute, really warmed me to their characters with their petty antics. oh did I mention yetâ€¦\n\nPretty solid movie. Pacing is really nice throughout the movie and is easy to watch and follow whats happening. Overall story is not that special, execution is good. Songs are great, comedy is great. Nothing stands out, but it does everything right.\n\nThis should be the standard of cheap masala movies. Good comedy as expected from Vivek, solid action - plausibly realistic action scenes for 2003 Kollywood, and a good, slightly above average storyline to keep me engaged. In my opinion, storylines for masala films shouldn't be too good because it'll just distract from the action and comedy scenes and the cheesiness that we watch them for.\n\nVikram was fantastic, as per usual. Never was a huge Jyothika fan (honestly, never a fan of North Indian girls playing the loosu ponnu), this was no exception. Interesting to see a woman gangster in this one, even if it was wildly different from Andrea Jeremiah in VadaChennai."
