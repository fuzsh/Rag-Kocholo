        "text": "Re: Searching for meaning - and discussion!\n\nYour story sounds a bit like mine.\n\nExcept I'd say, I'm still in that desperation struggle, where I am still highly skeptical of religion...I can not just believe, and its a torture chamber for the mind.\n\nI got into Sikhi through a different method. 1984 was the trick for me. Once, I learned about it, it changed me drastically. I researched more and more about Sikhs and Sikhi because of it. I actually find alot of other people that are similar to me in that aspect.\n\nHave taken bad turns along the way.\n\nI do like this site the best, because they actually let me post without being banned.\n\nAnd, the views here are usually based off facts and not fanatical rages as seen on other forums.\n\nDiscussion is intelligent, and except for a few times, personal attacks are minimal.\n\nOnly if people posted more often, it would be funner for me\n\nAnyways, welcome to the forum, and dont be scared to post. Don't just read the threads, also post your opinion or questions on the topic.\n\nMaybe I should be a moderator, I'm on here so often\n\nRe: Searching for meaning - and discussion!\n\nhi Slkh\n\ni guess u r on the way to be moderator, but for that there is only one prerequisite and thats to keep your personal opinions n biases in check and encourage the healthy discussions irrespective of weather u agree to the posts or not, and i see u very much there..just be a lil patient..hehehe\n\ntake care n guru fateh\n\nRe: Searching for meaning - and discussion!\n\nDear Navneet, a warm welcome to SPN once again from myside. Have a nice time and enjoy your stay.\n\nAnd as dear S|KH has rightly pointed out that SPN is not all about posting useless threads but threads with some substance... so dont be surprised or disappointed if you find the activity on this forum a little on slower side... but you would find members here, who do think deep and take their time before they make a post. So, patience and perservance is the name of game on SPN...\n\nAs a curious beginner to Sikhism and as a response to your first post in another forum, i would humbly recommend you reading and understanding our section on Japji Sahib Ji elsewhere in this forum... you would find there an honest and contemporary effort to understand Gurbani by one of our esteemed members (Amarpal ji).\n\nAnd last but not least, take it easy and enjoy life...\n\nRegards\n\nRe: Searching for meaning - and discussion!\n\nWelcome Navneet ji. We look forward to your active participation in this forum. I dont believe anything happens by accident. Sometimes, we understand the reason after a few similar events have taken place, and then start sequencing those.\n\nAnd S|kh, your comments are great compliments to us. Makes us feel good that we SPN members are moving in right direction, and actually that kind of open-discussion environment without personal attacks, getting both +ve and -ve view on something, and lot more things, we want to cultivate in Sikhs and aspiring sikhs.\n\nBest Regards.\n\nNamuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\nMy name is Kapil Nayar, I am Hindu Punjabi. I play dhol and tabla. I am looking for a necklace. The origination of the Kirpan is based on a lion claw. I am looking for a necklace with this lions claw on it.\n\nif anyone knows where to get one please let me know. drop me a message here on this site, or e-mail me directly at kapil@Temple.edu.\n\nthank you ji,\n\nkapil\n\nRe: Namuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\ndear kapil\n\nmy feeling is that u wont be able to get that there r lots of fakes out in the market, for this u have to contact a person who has hunted in india they might have some nails, then u have to get it custom made ,which people wear as a pendant..its not very costly but is not very cheap either..\n\nRe: Namuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\nNamuste ji,\n\nI am not sure myself. I just know that my friends Papa was telling us that the origin of the Kirpan was the Tiger claw, hence Sher Punjab Da. I wanted to find out if there was such a think as a necklace w/ the tiger claw on it. I know that there are necklaces w/ kirpans on them. I wanted to know where I could purchase some.\n\nthank you for your help though!\n\nRAM RAM,\n\n-kapil nayar\n\nRe: Namuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\netinder said:\n\ndear kapil\n\nmy feeling is that u wont be able to get that there r lots of fakes out in the market, for this u have to contact a person who has hunted in india they might have some nails, then u have to get it custom made ,which people wear as a pendant..its not very costly but is not very cheap either..\n\nNamuste ji,\n\nYou wouldn't happen to know where I could get one would you? do you know of the silver Kirpans that are small enough for a necklace?\n\nThank you for all of your help,\n\nRAM RAM,\n\n-kapil nayar\n\nRe: Namuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\nfatehi ji!\n\ni actually have a small kirpan that i can wear on a neclace, it was quite small but it is still quite noticable. i recieved mine from a friend who went to india but he said that most of the larger gurdwaras in india should have them. mine is from Hazoor sahib so my best guess would be to see if u could check there by any chance\n\nim not to sure but i hope this helps\n\nRe: Namuste And Sat Sri Akal\n\nyeah truth seeker is right 99% of the gurudwaras in india wud have it and even few across the world, they r very cheap usually nickel plated but u can get a custom made too from any jewellers in india n abroad..\n\nand the claw u were talking of i knew a guy in himalayas he used to sell em depending on availability..but i never bought anyone myself.\n\nbut i guess the kirpan pendant is ur easy bet ,plus u can go fancy too.\n\nregards"
