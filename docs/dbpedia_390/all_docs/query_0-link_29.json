        "text": "Sunday, November 22, 2020\n\nSikhlens Talks II\n\n10:00 AM – 11:30 AM PST\n\nThis event will be available online at the time listed above Pacific Standard Time at YouTube.com/Sikhlens\n\nCheck here to find your local date and time.\n\nProgramming is subject to change without notice.\n\nSikhs: Legacy of the Punjab\n\nPaul Michael Taylor, from the famed Smithsonian Museum, guides a fascinating tour of a remarkable exhibit that managed to grab the attention of millions of passersby who were visiting the museum for other reasons. Sikh artifacts symbolize Sikh identity, and nowhere is the treasure trove of such artifacts on better display than the Smithsonian. Dr. Taylor provides social, political, and aesthetic context to a wide variety of objects, books, and historical stories, building an irresistible narrative of the Sikh experience from its inception until today.\n\nSikhlens Talks III\n\n12:00 PM – 2:00 PM PST\n\nThis event will be available online at the time listed above Pacific Standard Time at YouTube.com/Sikhlens\n\nCheck here to find your local date and time.\n\nIndia, Empire and First World War Culture: Writings, Images, and Songs\n\nSantanu Das takes viewers on a journey into The Great War (now known as WWI) and the unheralded contributions of Sikh soldiers, specifically one of them. German scientists recorded the spoken voices of hundreds of prisoners of war. What were Sikhs doing in Europe, where the Europeans were fighting amongst themselves? Why were Sikhs fighting for the British, who were subjugating them back home in India? Why has the Sikh contribution gone unacknowledged for a century, by Hollywood and the general public? Dr. Das puts it all in perspective as he spins a tale of brave young Sikh farmers-turned-combatants in the bloody trenches of Ypres and other theaters of war along the Western front.\n\nPrisoner’s Song\n\nRetired Colonel Perminder Randhawa serves as a guide to an 80-second audio recording made during WWI by Punjabi farmer Mal Singh, while he was a German prisoner of war. The British Empire recruited soldiers from all across the empire in their fight against Germany, and Mal Singh found himself captured at the Battle of Flanders in 1915.In this rare recording made by German scientists studying their multi-ethnic POWs, Singh tells his captors that he comes from a land “of butter and milk,” but now in European hands he is dying of hunger during their “War for Civilization.” Britain’s dubious promise to him and his family ends this unique and poignant glimpse into the past.\n\nThe Lions of London\n\nThrough vivid eyewitness accounts and the collective voice of historians, government leaders and community organizers, “Lions of London” reveals the tremendous contributions of the Sikh community in both World Wars l and II. Sikh ism has deep rooted values of fighting against tyranny and oppression. Sikhs are renowned as excellent fighters, dating back to their battles against the Mughal tyrants, and their bravery earned them the nickname of “lions” on the battlefield. The Sikhs continued this military tradition as they took up arms and joined the British in the fight for democracy in both World Wars, losing tens of thousands of soldiers in the fights for freedom. Their sacrifices and heroism are vividly remembered in “Lions of London.”\n\nSikhs Serving Humanity\n\nThe world is facing an unprecedented pandemic. Unfortunately, food insecurity has emerged as a major byproduct across the globe. In the Sikh spirit of Seva and Sarbat Da Bhalla, Sikhs internationally have been spreading our Guru’s ideals of Langar and serving local communities by the hundreds of thousands. In this session, you will hear from nine Sikh organizations from all over the world who are trying to do their part to help alleviate the global issue of hunger surrounding all of us today. The constant, unifying drive behind all of their initiatives is their Sikhi principles, including the mandate of Vand Ke Chakna, which means to share all that Waheguru has blessed us with.\n\nSEVA: The Selfless Mission\n\nA profile of Randeep Singh Lall, a Sikh man who lives in Southall, West London. He established a non-profit organization called S.W.A.T (Sikh Welfare and Awareness Team) to help the homeless and other troubled souls around the UK. He brings the traditional Sikh idea of langar to the streets of London, serving hundreds of hot meals four days a week.\n\nKhalsa Rising\n\nAfter years of struggling with faith and purpose, Ravi Singh found his way back to the Sikh faith and a desire for ‘selfless service’ through his organization Khalsa Aid. For the past 16 years Ravi and his volunteers have been providing relief assistance around the world, most recently in Lebanon. We follow Ravi as he takes on the task of not only his organizations work, but what it means to be the face of an ever-growing non-profit.\n\nComedian Tarlok Singh Chugh\n\nSunday 2:00 PM – 3:00 PM PST\n\nTarlok Singh Chugh, whose humorous viral videos boast over 20M views, did not have a conventional foray into comedy.
