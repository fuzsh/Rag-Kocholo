Yusuf Khan, who made his directorial debut with KHEL, had cast Dharmendra and Sunny Deol in his new venture called BUS DO PUNJABI (Previously titled Dharam Veer ) Its based on the father-son relationship. The father-son hail from Punjab in the story. The father and son duo of Punjabis take on a gang of villains when they arrive from Punjab. Anees Bazmee [director of NO ENTRY] was writing the story, screenplay and dialogues of the film. BUS DO PUNJABI is a comedy with loads of high-voltage action scenes. In fact, the makers were planning to cast as many as nine villains in the film. The villains had an integral role to play in BUS DO PUNJABI. Yusuf was yet to finalize the leading ladies. He had approached Lara Dutta. At a point of time, the makers were toying with the idea of casting established names, but they might settle for new faces. Since Sunny had allotted bulk shooting dates from July to September, we may opt for newcomers who have dates to spare at a short notice. However, weve yet to take a decision on whether to cast a known name or a newcomer.. G.V. Prasad is producing BUS DO PUNJABI, which went on the floors July 25 2005."
