Each one tries his hand at finding a shortcut to success but ends up being in even deeper trouble. Things get worse when the four decide to take some desperate measures to end their misery once and for all. They take loans from Martand’s maternal uncle at very high interest so he always beats up Martand.\n\nThey believe that the only way to get rich without working hard is to marry a wealthy girl. As luck would have it, a rich girl Ritu arrives in their neighborhood with her grandparents. All four set out with their individual plans to marry her but end up discovering a shocking truth. Ritu came to the city to find out about her brother Rahul's killers.\n\nAll four of them try to impress Ritu but meanwhile, they discover that Rahul died along with his friend Jaishankar \"Jai\" Yadav. They try hard and finally Pankaj is decided to marry Ritu. Soon before marriage, Ritu finds the secret that Rahul and Jai were in contact with a notorious gang leader Zikomo. Also, Ritu finds that the four were bluffing all time just to impress her and so she starts avoiding them. One day Zikomo finds them and kidnaps Ritu and her grandparents. He reveals himself to be the true killer and he confesses about killing Rahul and Jai. He asks for them to hand over the Dhol if they wanted to see him alive, but Ritu's family members do not know about any Dhol. A fight ensues and Zikomo is killed in a self-explosion in the end. Ritu hands over the Dhol and the four of them find it filled with money, realizing that Zikomo was after the money and not the Dhol. They run behind Ritu's car after she leaves, as the film ends.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nTusshar Kapoor as Sameer \"Sam\" Arya\n\nSharman Joshi as Pankaj \"Pakya\" Tiwari\n\nKunal Khemu as Gautam \"Goti\" Sisodia\n\nRajpal Yadav as Martand \"Maru\" Dhamdhere\n\nTanushree Dutta as Ritu Tripathi\n\nOm Puri as Satyadev Tripathi, Ritu’s Grandfather\n\nArbaaz Khan as Jaishankar \"Jai\" Yadav\n\nMurli Sharma as Zikomo Singh\n\nPayal Rohatgi as Sophie Strauss; Jai's Fiance\n\nAbhimanyu Singh as Rahul Tripathi, Ritu's brother\n\nBaby Farida as Elizabeth Tripathi, Ritu's grandmother\n\nAsrani as Sunil Nahata, Pakya's brother in-law\n\nTiku Talsania as Inspector Subhash Dongre (Mama), Maru’s uncle\n\nTareena Patel as Kanika\n\nRasika Joshi as Landlady\n\nPrerna Arora in \"Haadsa\" song\n\nQadeer Sarwar as chota bhai telephone caller\n\nSoundtrack\n\n[edit]\n\nDholSoundtrack album by Released2007 (India)Recorded2007GenreFeature film soundtrackLabelT-SeriesProducerPritamPritam chronology\n\nLife In A...

At the box-office, the Priyadarshan brand should ensure impressive footfalls at cineplexes despite the dull period and coupled with its moderate pricing, DHOL should find a place in the director's successful films.″[6] Syed Firdaus Ashraf of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 stars out of 5 calling it ″funny in parts.″[7]\n\nRajeev Masand gave the film 1 star out of 5, writing ″I’m going with one out of five and a suggestion to stay far, far away from Priyadarshan’s Dhol. The one star is for the smattering of genuine comedy you’re likely to find here, the rest is just indifferent film-making, an insult to your intelligence. You know, every time I walk out of the cinema after watching a Priyadarshan film, I feel like he can’t make a film worse than this. And every single time, he surprises me by surpassing his previous achievement.″[8]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
