It is feared that Bachno's dupatta will be ripped to shreds\n\nMundiyan De Singg Fass Gaye, Ve Koi Nitroo Vadenve Khani - Singhs are fighting like bulls and their horns are entangled. Nnow, only the worthy opponenent will prevail\n\nDharti de khoon dhooleya ve Jiveh tidhke kade jo paani - The blood is flowing like water from a broken pot\n\nO Shera wangu yaar kadke Pehli yaar se jinneh de yaari - Their friends meanwhile are standing by their side like lions\n\nHo chaaron passe raula pe gaya jado maareya gandasa hath jod ke - When hit the axe with his hands together with full force, it causes an uproar among people\n\nKhoon de tarale chal de Thaale set leni tona nu marod ke - The blood is pouring out like a waterfall as he grabs his opponents with throat and twists them\n\nSher jeha rohb jatt da Thalle rakh da police sarkaari - He is unafraid like a lion and keeps the Police and government under his feet\n\nThe song the father-son relationship. Arjan Vailly is being referred as a metaphor for Ranbir Kapoor's character who is seen in bloodied shirt carrying axe in his hands and apparently killing people for his father."
