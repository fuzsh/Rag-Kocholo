        "text": "Jat / Jatt Origins: (pronunciation: “Jut / Jutt”)\n\nJats (Juts) are an ethnic group, race and tribe consisting of several blood related clans who derive from common family dynasties and lineages. Jats are more than just a race and a tribe. Jats are a family and a federation of blood related clans whose common ancestor is the founder of its lineage. All Jats originate from a single common ancestor who belonged to the Chandravanshi/Chandarvanshi lineage that dates back to around 4000 BCE. Jats resided in the plains of Punjab and named cities and villages that they ruled after their family name. The term ‘Jat’ is derived from “Jāta”, “Jāti”, “Jātiya” and “Jātya’ which all mean “a group of people belonging to a certain family, creed, ethnicity, race or tribe. Jats originally belonged to a warrior-ruling class. Ancient Punjab was known as Sapta Sindhu during the Vedic period and the region played a prominent role in the composition of the Rigveda hymns. Jat family dynasties always fought opposing Jat family dynasties for supremacy. Jats came together as a race and community thanks to Lord Krishna, who wanted the Jats to fight for righteousness and protect Sānatana Dharma, the Natural Law and Eternal Order of the Universe. As a result, Jats were formed into a federation of clans to fight for Sanātana Dharma (Natural Law) and defend the nation of Bharat (modern day India/Pakistan). Jats were bred to fight and were involved in almost every battle that took place in the history of Bharat (India & Pakistan). Sanatana Dharmic Jats mastered the art of fighting and became incredibly skilled sword fighters and horse riders. Jats resided mostly in Punjab and the areas surrounding the region (modern day Punjab, Kashmir, Haryana and Rajasthan). Throughout history, the Punjab region was the corridor which every conquerer and invader had to pass through. Many tribes and armies conquered vast amounts of territories, but they were never able to defeat the Jats when travelling through the Punjab region. The Jats defeated them all and forced every army to retreat from the battlefield.\n\nJats are historically reported to be present in India some time between 4000 BCE and 3200 BCE. Jats are followers of many religions, but most are now Sikhs, Muslims or Hindus. Any religion, which preached oneness of God and condemned rituals and idol worship easily appealed to Jats, and was adopted by Jats in large numbers at different times. When Vedic Hinduism gave place to idol worshipping, religion began to be used by priests as a means of livelihood; superstitious and awe inspiring beliefs tales and rituals, were introduced in religion to frighten people into giving offerings to idols and priests who became self appointed agents of God; non-Brahmins were debarred from learning how to read and write in Sanskrit in order to exploit them. Jats became Buddhists and remained so long after others went back to Brahmanical caste system. When Buddhism began to decline after the Brahmins and Rajputs defeated the Buddhist rulers, Jats became devotees of Muslims saints and Jats became prominent saints themselves at this stage. The saints not being versed in Sanskrit could not however contend effectively with the Brahmins. During the early days of Sikh religion, Jats wholeheartedly embraced Sikhi, protected the Sikh Gurus and fought to defend Sikhi. These Dharmic Jatt warriors with their fighting skills combined with the divine warrior spirit of Sikhi went on to become the greatest and the most powerful warriors the world ever witnessed. The Sikh Jats became known as Jatts and were the main reason the Sikh religion not only survived, but thrived. Sikh warriors crushed their enemies and forced them to retreat all while Sikhs were badly outnumbered a hundred to one, sometimes even a thousand to one.\n\nPrior to the Mahabharata War, Kshatriyas were known by their vansha, meaning “family dynasty” or “family lineage”. Kshatriyas were divided into four vanshas, Chandravansh, Suryavansh, Agnivansh and Nagavansh. Chandravansh was the original that all Jat lineages derive from. Each vansha was led by multiple kings whose sons would form a new family lineage and dynasty. Lord Krishna (Kṛṣṇa) was born in ~3228 BCE and comes from Chandra lineage and the Lunar Dynasty. The Lunar dynasty was a legendary house of the Kshatriyas, a warrior and ruling class. After the Mahabharata War, the population of the Kshatriyas drastically declined as a large number of warriors were killed in the war. Lord Krishna realized the future reality of Sanātana Dharma was in danger and understood the division of various Kshatriya families could not be resolved without uniting them. Krishna formed all four Kshatriya vanshas into a single community called the Jat Sangha, also known as Jñātisangha. Jñāti means “blood relatives”; Sangha means “a group, community and confederation who are followers of Sanatana Dharma (Eternal God & Natural Law); Jñātisangha means “a community of blood relatives who follow Dharma”. All Kshatriya vanshas were included and accepted Jat Sanghate. This led to birth and creation of the Jats as a race, where as before the Jats weren’t a single community, but were several family dynasties engaging in continuous battles against other related dynasties. Jats were the earliest and most passionate followers of Lord Krishna. Sri Krishna was born to uphold Sanātana Dharma, the Natural Law of the Universe. Krishna appeared on earth to protect the good-hearted ones and save humanity from the evil rulers. The main message of Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita is that we are all children of God, the One Creator. God is the Supreme Reality and the Ruler of the Universe, and the purpose of life is to surrender the ego and attain God consciousness by taking part in desire-less actions. Lord Krishna died in 3102 BCE. Lord Krishna accomplished his goal of upholding Sanātana Dharma by forming the Jats into a powerful unified community and made it the duty of the Jats to rule, protect and fight for Sanātana Dharma, the Natural Law & Eternal God. These warriors became known as Sanātana Dharmic Jats. Many Jat dynasties are mentioned in the Mahabharata and are praised for their bravery and warrior-like mentality. Ancient Punjab is where all the major battles and wars took place, and the Jats were involved in almost every one of them throughout the history of India. The Punjab region was a corridor through which every conquerer had to pass through. Punjab became the battlefield where the Jats resisted and fought back against the oppressors. All major battles were fought by the Jat community. Jats are known for being brave, kindhearted and hardworking people.\n\nPunjabi Jats and Kashmir Jats are the descendants of ancient North Indians and Central Asians. Haryana and Rajasthan Jats are descendants of ancient North Indians and Central Asians who mixed with ancient Dravidians (aboriginal Indians). Jats (Jatts, Jutts, Jaats) are an ethnic group originating in ancient times along the Indus River, also known as Sapta Sindhu (7 Rivers), and Punjab (Land of 5 Rivers). Jats (pronounced “Jutts”) were bred to fight and rule. Jat dynasties were the ruling class of ancient Punjab and many areas surrounding it. Jat warriors always fought between each other for power as no one else had the courage to take on the Jats. Jats consisted of many clans and family dynasties that ruled over parts of Bharat (modern day Punjab (India & Pakistan), Kashmir, Haryana and Rajasthan. Every Jat clan founded their own cities, towns and villages and named it after their family names, which formed a dynasty. Jats ruled with the sword and have always been proud of owning and protecting their land and property. Jats have always been independent and have never liked being ruled over, which is why Jats have resisted every conquerer who has tried to rule over them. After Sri Krishna arrived on earth, all Jat dynasties were organized into a single community and came together to form the Jats, a federation of clans and a democratic nation. Jats were responsible for protecting Sanatana Dharma, the Natural Law and Order of the Universe.\n\nJats gradually began to lose their ruling status over time as Jat clans and family dynasties were separated into different castes and occupations. The Vedic civilization and society was divided into four varnas (social classes): The top varna was the Brahmins, consisting of the elites, intellectuals and spiritual priests who were responsible for teaching Dharma and the Vedas; the second varna was the Kshatriyas, consisting of warriors and rulers who were responsible for fighting, protecting and ruling the administration; the third varna was the Vaishyas, who were merchants and labourers; the bottom class was the Shudras, who served the three classes above them. Those who are not sufficiently intelligent to be brāhmaṇas, kṣatriyas or vaiśyas were required to serve a master and were called śūdras. Brahmins were intellectuals and understood how to rule over people through abstract thinking, and dividing people through the social status and caste system. Brahmins themselves wanted to dominate society by self-proclaiming as the agents of God. The Brahmin elites constantly manipulated and programmed the common minds of the public to stay in power. They also distorted history and rewrote historical books, epics and poems that glorified themselves and downplayed the achievements of Jats. Brahmins fabricated mythological stories by attaching supernatural powers to specific idols and made them look like “God” in the eyes of the public, in order to control and rule over masses. In the early Vedic civilization, the ruling class and the warrior class was known as Kshatriya and Rājanya. Jats were originally associated with Kshatriyas and Rajanyas. Jat dynasties were the original rulers and warriors belonging to the Kshatriya class. It was the Brahmin elites who gave Rajputras the sole Kshatriya status and gave Jats a low social status. Jats who accepted Brahmin hierarchy kept their Kshatriya status and became known as “Rajputra”, which later turned into “Rajput”. Jats who kept a high status but didn’t want to continue the warrior tradition of the Kshatriyas became Khatris. Khatris were descendants of Kshatriya warriors governed the Brahmin administration as accountants, merchants and traders. Rajputs were Kshatriya warriors who governed the administration as rulers, protectors and warriors. Rajputs and Khatris owned large amounts of land (until the rise of the Khalsa and Sikh Jatts). The Jats who resisted the caste system remained Jats but were degraded and considered shudras and peasants by the Brahmins. These Jats, who were landless farmers and the poorest of all Jats were considered the Jat caste. As Jats began to lose their power and were revoked of their ruling status, Jats took up farming and became associated with agriculture. This is why Jats have been labeled as farmers, despite the fact that Jats have been rulers and warriors throughout their history. Brahmins were just ordinary people in the eyes of the Jats. The Brahmin elites vehemently opposed the Jats because the Jats never took orders from them. Brahmins referred to the Jats as devils and wicked minded warriors because no one was able to subdue the Dharmic Jats as the Dharmic Jats refused to bow down to Brahmin supremacy. Hence, Jat history was distorted by the Brahmin elites. Brahmin scholars deliberately downplayed the history of the Jats due to jealousy and glorified the history of the Rajputs and Khatris instead. Khatris and Rajputs were originally offshoots of Jats who joined the Brahmin Dynasty and Rajput Dynasty. This is why many of the same clans and family names are found between the Jats, Khatris and the Rajputs. Dharmic Jats began to abandon their religion because Hinduism had deviated from Sanātana Dharma and idol worshipping had become associated with Hinduism. Dharmic Jats became Buddhists and remained so long after other people in Punjab adopted the caste system. When Buddhism disappeared from the Punjab region after the Brahmins and Rajputs defeated the Bhuddhist rulers, Jats became devotees of the newly arrived Muslim saints. At this time, many Jats became Muslims after the arrival of prominent saints in the Punjab region. During and after the times of the Sikh prophets, most Punjabi Jats embraced Sikhi and became devoted Sikhs.\n\nReal Jat & Sikh History:\n\nJats were originally known as Dharmic Jats/Dharmic Warriors. Jats were also known as Rajas, meaning kings and royalty. This was because the a large proportion of kings, royalty and warriors belonged to the Jat tribe. The Jats are considered to be one of the oldest tribes in history with origins of the earliest Jat clans dating back to ~3200 BCE. Hinduism was originally called Dharma. Dharma represents the Eternal God that is in everyone, and that everything is a divinely preordained plan of Dharma (One God). Kshatriyas were originally the Jats who belonged to the military and ruling class whose purpose was to uphold Dharma. Brahmins created the social hierarchy system and became the leaders and rulers in society through the divide and rule tactics. Brahmins were priests and intellectuals who put themselves into the 1st social class. Kshatriyas were to govern and protect the administration, and were placed just under the Brahmins which gave them the 2nd highest social status. Vaishyas were merchants and traders. who belonged to the 3rd social class. Shudras were labourers who provided service to the social classes above them, and were placed into the bottom social class. Brahmins practiced black magic and witchcraft. They exploited and oppressed people for thousands of years through bribery, treachery, deceit, greed, mind control, propaganda and ritualism. Yet, this is never mentioned in history books. This is because the Brahmins have always controlled the political organizations and public narratives. Brahmins never leave any opportunity to exploit and conspire against anyone outside of their caste. Brahmins bribed Rajputs to defend them when force was necessary and manipulated the lower caste weak-minded supporters into obeying the Brahmins. This created unfounded fear, self-doubt, gullibility, irrationality and false beliefs amongst the common people. Brahmins had a stranglehold on the masses by fabricating myths and superstitions, constantly feeding into the hopes and fear of the masses.\n\nFor thousands of years Brahmins have tried to wipe out the Jats. Kshatriyas were originally made up of rulers and warriors who belonged to the Jat race. The Brahmin caste, although not from a particular race, didn’t like the power the Kshatriyas of the Jat tribe possessed. The Brahmins eventually succeeded in defeating the Jats through treachery, deceit and bribery. The Brahmins controlled and owned all the gold, which they hid and buried mountains of gold in Hindu temples. The Brahmins also used mind control and propaganda to win over the masses. Brahmins controlled the public narrative through the media and newspapers. Only the Brahmins knew how to read and write. They had superior networking and communicating skills. Brahmins also implanted fear into people through superstitions, ritualism and by fabricating stories. The Brahmins claimed they had supernatural powers and became the mediators between God and the public masses. The masses eventually began to worship the Brahmins, instead of supporting the Kshatriyas, who were the ancient followers and protectors of Dharma. The Brahmins replaced the Kshatriyas as the top of the hierarchy in the caste system. The Kshatriyas who accepted Brahmin hierarchy and protected the Brahmins became known as Rajputs. In return, Rajputs were given large amounts of land and wealth. The Kshatriyas who opposed Brahmin supremacy were degraded. The Brahmins used these same tactics after some Jats adopted Buddhism. Buddhism began to flourish when a Jatt king became the Buddhist ruler of the Maurya Empire. Emperor Ashoka was a prominent Buddhist leader who belonged to the Kshatriya military class, but the Brahmins erased him from the history of India. After the Brahmins and Rajputs defeated the Buddhist kings, Buddhism began to decline. After the decline of Buddhism in India, Islam began to arrive. The Islamic rulers exposed the Brahmin caste system and stole the gold hidden in Hindu temples by the Brahmins. Jats became followers of Muslim saints who had settled in Punjab. Muslim saints did not attract the masses in the Middle East. It wasn’t until Muslim saints reached Punjab, where they began to attract many followers. The Islamic rulers were different from the Muslim saints. The Muslim saints who were spreading there divine message did not associate with the Islamic rulers who were only interested in wealth and materialistic gains. The Muslim saints mainly attracted the Hindu Jat community of Punjab. The lowly and degraded Jats, who had been oppressed by the Brahmins and Rajputs, were introduced to a new path by two prominent Muslim saints named Baba Farid and Sakhi Sarwar. In this society of saints, there was no oppression or hatred. Everyone came together in happiness, peace, and unity. Muslim saints had a significant impact on the future of the Jats and the Sikh faith. Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion, was inspired by Baba Farid, a Muslim saint. Guru Gobind Singh formed the Khalsa, a military force which enabled the Sikhs to oppose and resist the Mughal Empire. A strong religious sense animated these warlike Jats. The Jat clans around the Punjab rivers quickly and willingly joined the Sikhi. No longer would they turn the other way to persecution and tyranny as they began to group themselves by confederacies to oppose the evil rulers. The followers of Guru Gobind Singh who joined the Khalsa were Jats who revered Sakhi Sarwar, a Muslim saint. After the death of Guru Gobind Singh, Banda Singh managed to convert Jat peasants and the Jat followers of Muslim saints to Sikhi, and absorbed them into the Khalsa Army. Sikhi always resonated with the Jats since its inception. Jats of the Punjab, sturdy and combative, flocked to the Khalsa Army, and a new brotherhood was formed. The Khalsa means God’s Army, and the members of the Khalsa are known as God’s Warriors.\n\nBrahmins, Rajputs and the Islamic rulers confronted many Sikh leaders. Islamic rulers allowed the Sikh religion to flourish as long as they didn’t have gain any political influence. It wasn’t until the Sikhs began to arm themselves when the Mughals warned the Sikhs to disarm themselves if they wanted to continue practice their religion. Mughals were worried that the Sikhs, who were a strong community fond of martyrdom, would loot and plunder the wealth of the Mughal elites. The Brahmins on the other hand were always jealous of the Sikhs because Sikhi exposed Brahmin hierarchy. Sikhs also began to command more respect than the Brahmins in Punjab, and this didn’t sit well with the Brahmins. Hindus and Muslims leaving their religion and becoming faithful Sikhs also made Sikhi a threat to the Brahmins and the Mughal authorities. It was a Brahmin who set up the death of Guru Arjan Dev by fabricating lies and spreading them to the Mughal authorities. A Brahmin also gave the location of the place where Guru Gobind Singh and his army was hiding to the Mughal authorities. Rajputs clashed with the Khalsa army as the Khalsa was a threat to the Rajputs wealth and social status. The British also opposed the Sikhs and the Khalsa Army. Just like the Brahmins and Mughal rulers, the British also tried to wipe out the Sikhs because Sikhs were bred to fight tyrants and were deemed a threat to the ruling class elites. The British Government dissolved the Khalsa Army and tried to get Christian missionaries to convert Sikhs into Christianity. This backfired as the Sikhs began to realize that their identity was at stake and their religion was fading. This led to the formation of the Singh Sabha movement which brought many Jats back into the Sikh panth.\n\nThe Brahmins have always been the enemies of the Jat tribe and the Sikh religion. The Brahmins separated Jats into separate social classes and forbade Jats from carrying weapons unless they were of Rajput status. This ultimately led to the weakening of India and allowed neighbouring armies to invade and conquer India. People weren’t able to escape the oppression of the caste system even after leaving Hinduism because the Brahminical social system was so deeply ingrained into them. It wasn’t until the arrival of the Muslim saints and Sikh Gurus when people began to empower themselves through God and self-realization, which effectively allowed them escape the negative psychological and social effects of the caste system created by the Brahmins. Hindu Jats were originally known as Dharmic Jats, who were the followers and protectors of Dharma. Hindu Jats who became followers of Muslim saints became Muslim Jats. Hindu Jats and Muslim Jats who became followers of Sikh Gurus became Sikh Jats. Guru Gobind Singh wanted to create a superior race of Godly Warriors. He stated that the Jats had lost their spirit and were physiologically defeated. Guru Gobind Singh was able kickstart his mission through the formation of the Khalsa, but his mission was ultimately accomplished after his death thanks to the heroics of Banda Singh Minhas and other Jat Sikh warriors. Although the Brahmins are abstract thinkers and intellectually superior, the Brahmins could never touch the divine wisdom of Sikhi and the Muslim saints. The Sikh Gurus and Muslim saints all preached that one’s pride, ego and intellect is false, and that the mind separates one from God by creating illusions and distractions; God (Allah) is the Supreme Reality, and one’s purpose in life is to gravitate inwards and achieve inner joy and happiness; attach to God and attaining spiritual powers and reaching the state of bliss, liberation and euphoria in the process. These were the divine messages of the gurus and saints. The Brahmins know Sikhi is the eternal truth, which is why they have tried to destroy and eliminate the Sikh religion ever since its founding, but the Brahmins ultimately failed because the truth always prevails.\n\nThe Sikh panth allowed the Jatts to embrace oneness and continue their warrior traditions. Dharmic Jatts, Khatri Jatts, Rajput Jatts and Jatt peasants all came together as one and fought as one. Sikhi dissolved the mental constructs and the social status of people in society, which helped dissolve their ego and merge them with God. The divine spirit of Sikhi helped raise one’s self-confidence and uphold superior moral values. Sikhs became egoless and deathless Warrior Saints. Sikhi represented Dharma (One God) and the dissolution of all castes, rituals, superstitions, social classes and varnas; the Khalsa represented Kshatriya Dharma and fighting for righteousness. The social class and caste system separated the Jatts into different castes but Sikhi brought the Jatts back together by forming a collective conscious that brought the Sikh community together as one. Sikhs were bred to fight and never run away. Everyone feared the Sikhs. From birth to death, Sikhs were ready to fight and die. They fought in the name of God and protected not just themselves, but all innocent people. Sikhs are God, the Divine Light, and the Immortal Being. Sikhs are eternal and the enemies of the Sikhs are struck with the wrath of God.\n\nBrahman Dynasty (1500 BCE):\n\nJats had total power and control over the nation of Bharat. After the Mahabharata times, Jats began to decline and lose their power due the rise of Brahmanism and the caste system. Brahmins didn’t like the fact that Jat dynasties ruled over and there was nothing anyone could do because Jats were masters in fighting. Hence, conflict between Jats and Brahmins began during ancient times and still exists till today. The Brahmins wanted to eliminate tribal supremacy by establishing a new social class system where the Brahmin elites would be at the top of the hierarchy. The Jats were staunch opponents of Brahmanism and always resisted their authority. However, the Brahmins defeated the Jats through the ‘divide and conquer” strategy by separating them into different castes and ruling over them. The Brahmins weren’t capable of bringing down Jatt dynasties through force as the Brahmins were well aware of the ferociousness of the Jats. But Brahmins also knew they were clever and intellectually more advanced than the Jats. Through treachery and deceit, the Brahmins were considered the top of the hierarchy in the caste system. The Brahmins had superior communication networks since only they knew how to read and write in Sanskrit literature, where as the masses couldn’t read or write and could only speak the language orally. Brahmins deliberately wrote and taught Sanskrit literatures only among themselves to keep the masses ignorant and illiterate. The Brahmins through the use of brainwashing, propaganda, deceitfulness, and cunningness eventually ended up with all the gold and jewels which they hid in Hindu temples. Then they bribed the Jats to join the social class and caste system where they would work for the Brahmin administration as accountants, merchants, rulers and warriors in exchange for luxury living and a high status. These Jats became known as ‘Khatris’ and ‘Rajputras’, which later transformed into ‘Rajputs’. Even though Brahmins were higher in hierarchy than Jats, the Brahmin elites relied on Rajput Jats to engage in warfare and protect the Brahmin dynasties and the social class system, and in return the Rajputs were given land and a high social status.\n\nUmayyad Dynasty (712 CE):\n\nArab rulers conquered vast territories and took down ruling dynasties in the Middle East, North Africa, Southern Europe, Persia and Central Asia. When Arab rulers set their eyes on India, they had to enter through Sindh and Punjab, both regions that were populated by Jats. As Jats were always in continuous conflict with the Brahmins since the beginning of their times, the Brahmins conspired with the Arabs and invited their armies to attack the “demon Jats”, as they were referred to by the Brahmin elites and Arab rulers. After conquering Brahmanabad in Sindh, Muhammad Bin Qasim co-opted with the local Brahman elite, whom he held in high esteem, re-appointing them to posts held under the Brahman Dynasty and offering honours and awards to their religious leaders and scholars. This arrangement with local Brahman elites resulted in the persecution of Jats. However, the Arab armies were continuously repelled and crushed by Dharmic Jat warriors for centuries. The Arab defeats led to an end of their eastward expansion, and later manifested in the overthrow of Arab rulers and the establishment of Jat dynasties. Sanatana Dharmic Jats were the main reason why Arabs were never able to conquer India.\n\nGhaznavid Dynasty (977 CE):\n\nThe Ghaznavid dynasty was a Persianate Muslim dynasty of Turkic origin, ruling, at its greatest extent, large parts of Persia, Afghanistan, Central Asia and the northwest of India from 977 to 1186. Although the dynasty was of Turkic origin, it was thoroughly Persian in terms of language, culture, literature and customs. Mahmud Ghazni launched many raids into North India and was very successful. However, Mahmud Ghazni would eventually run out of luck after his 17th invasion where he was killed by a group of Jats when traveling through the Punjab region.\n\nGhurid Dynasty (1186 CE):\n\nMuhammad Ghori was undoubtedly one of the greatest generals of Islamic and Indian history. The Ghurids were great patrons of Persian culture and literature and lay the basis for a Persianate state in the Indian subcontinent. However, most of the literature produced during the Ghurid era has been lost. They also transferred Persian architecture to India. The Ghurids had been able to conquer northern India not only because of their superior military strength and tactics, but also due to the continual rivalry and infighting among the Jats and Rajputs. However, Muhammad Ghori, the ruler of the Ghurid Dynasty, was assassinated by a Jat in 1206 CE.\n\nKhalji Dynasty (1290):\n\nThe Khalji Dynasty / Khilji Dynasty was a Turkic-Afghan dynasty which ruled on the Delhi sultanate, covering large parts of the North India between 1290 and 1320. The Khaljis were a Central Asian Turkic dynasty but adopted some Afghan and Persian customs. Alauddin Khalji is arguably one of the greatest rulers of India as he accomplished something no one throughout history ever did: Khalji repelled the Mongol raids and handily defeated the Mongol rulers. During the time of Alauddin Khalji, the Mongols were feared everywhere as they conquered vast territories and wiped out entire populations of regions. Alauddin Khalji with his military brilliance managed to defeat the Mongols not once, but five times. India is the only nation to repel and defeat the Mongols.\n\nAlauddin Khalji boasted about his genius move and defeating the Mongols. He explained how he was notified of the Mongols plans to raid and conquer India a week before the Mongols crossed the Punjab rivers. So Khalji made the best decision one could ever make. He used his army to loot the gold from Brahmin elites who hid mountains of gold in Hindu temples. He then replaced his army with Jat warriors after bribing the Jats with the gold that he had looted. Khalji set up the Jat army along the Punjab rivers where the Mongols had a tough time penetrating through. Many Mongols were repelled and killed. The Mongols who did reach Delhi were slaughtered and the survivors were taken as prisoners of war by the Jats. Thanks to the genius of Alauddin Khalji and the courage of Jat warriors, India was saved from being conquered and taken over the Mongols.”\n\nTimurid Dynasty):\n\nThe Timurid Dynasty was a Persianate Turkic-Mongol empire formed by Timur, also known as Tamerlane. Timur (Tamerlane) was born into a Turkic tribe and became an in-law of a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, a prominent Mongol conquerer. Tamerlane was a Turco-Mongol conqueror who founded the Timurid Empire in and around modern-day Afghanistan, Persia and Central Asia, becoming the first ruler of the Timurid dynasty. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military leaders and tacticians. However, Tamerlane died from injuries after he was struck by a Jat when travelling through the Punjab/Haryana region.\n\nMughal Dynasty (1526 CE):\n\nBabur was the founder of the Mughal Empire and first emperor of the Mughal dynasty in the Indian subcontinent. He was a descendant of Timur and Genghis Khan through his father and mother respectively. Guru Nanak was an eye-witness to the havoc created during these invasions. Guru Nanak himself was taken captive but was later released by Babur after Emperor Babur realized Guru Nanak was a saint. The early Mughal kings and emperors were fond of the Sikh gurus and even built Gurdwaras, places of worship for Sikhs.\n\nAfsharid Dynasty (1736 CE):\n\nThe Afsharid dynasty was founded in 1736 by the military commander Nader Shah, who deposed the last member of the Afsharid dynasty and proclaimed himself as the Shah of Iran. He invaded Delhi and looted the treasury during the decline of the Mughal Empire. After plundering Delhi, Nader Shah was returning to Persia where his army was harassed by Sikhs. The Sikhs were the only ones to relieve them of the booty and release the captured slaves. Nader Shah was amazed by the courage and the savagery of the Sikh warriors. He boasted about how no one dared to stand in the way of his army until he reached Punjab, where his army was ambushed by Sikhs every time he passed through Punjab.\n\nDurrani Empire (1747 CE):\n\nAhmad Shah Abdali was the founder of the Durrani Empire and is regarded as the founder of the modern state of Afghanistan. Ahmad Shah Abdali invaded India eight times after he learned the Mughal Empire was falling apart. Ahmad Shah Abdali helped further weaken the Mughal Empire and looted their treasury. When the armies of Ahmad Shah Abdali carried loot from Delhi back to Afghanistan, the Sikhs would swoop in and take the loot from the Afghans when they were travelling through Punjab, leaving them to return to Afghanistan with nothing. Ahmad Shah Abdali with his forces attacked the Gurdwaras to weaken the Sikhs community and spirit. However, Ahmad Shah Abdali retreated every time he encountered the guerrilla warfare of Sikhs in Punjab. Ahmad Shah Abdali’s mission to conquer Punjab failed thanks to the Sikh militants and guerrilla fighters.\n\nSikh Empire / Khalsa Empire (1800 CE):\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh was the first ruler of the Sikh Empire, which ruled the Punjab region from 1800 CE to 1850 CE. Ranjit Singh was a Sikh Jatt belonging to the “Sandhawalia” clan. He was revered and feared at the same time. All Punjabis, including Hindus, Muslims and Sikhs, were pleased with Ranjit Singh’s regime under the Sikh Empire. The common people supported his regime mainly due to spiritual and psychological reasons. The rule of Ranjit Singh was eminently suited to the genius of the people, and the spirit of the Sikhs mounted high when they witnessed the Sikhs crush all their enemies and saw territories continuously added to the Sikh Empire. The people of Punjab supported Sikh rule as they were excited by the martial triumphs of the Sikhs, which made the Punjabi community feel safe and at home. Since Sikhs only made up the minority of the population, Ranjit Singh put Hindus and Muslims in charge of the Sikh administration while the Sikhs engaged in military expeditions and warfare. Ranjit Singh became known as the “Lion of Punjab” as Ranjit Singh was never defeated throughout his time on the throne. Ranjit Singh crushed and repelled all armies that tried to conquer Punjab, forcing them to leave the Punjab for good. Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the ruler of the Sikh Empire was named the “Greatest Leader of All Time”. The Sikh Empire and the British Empire eventually clashed and the British soldiers were shocked at the savagery they witnessed from the swords of the Sikhs. The British Empire, controlled by a Jewish family from the Rothschild Dynasty annexed Punjab in 1850 CE, 10 years after the death of Ranjit Singh. The Rothschild family signed a treaty with Ranjit Singh’s family that would end the wars and conflict between the Sikhs and the British. The British Empire came to realization that Jatts were a martial race and would make more ferocious soldiers that would help further their conquests, so they replaced the British Indian Army with mostly Sikh Jatts. The Rothschild Dynasty would eventually go on to rule the entire world, a feat that no one has accomplished nor thought was even possible.\n\nJatt Demographics & Census\n\nJatts are a family, race and tribe consisting of several blood related clans who are patrilineal descendants of ancient Jat rulers and warriors. Jats were born to uphold and safeguard Dharma, the Eternal God and Natural Law of the Universe. The origins of Jats predate most ancient civilizations. However, their history was not recorded or written down. Jats are a spiritual and warrior race who represent the qualities of God. Jats are a tribe consisting of several clans and family dynasties who originate as ancient rulers and warriors. Jats were not known as a race or tribe because they originally went by their family dynasties and lineages, not by their race or tribe. Jats of all varieties form an ancient race that has been wielding the axe and the sword since their inception. Although Jats are a warrior-ruling tribe, they never cared to attack or conquer others. Jatt dynasties and family names have ancient meanings that originated in times that predates literacy when languages were orally spoken and not written, which is why it’s hard to find the meanings of Jatt family names. However, some Jatt family names can be found in Prakrit and Sanskrit languages. All Jatt family names have similar meanings under different names, which translates to: “Gift of God”, “Light of God”, “Protector of God”, “Warrior of God”, “God-lion”, “divine”, “crown”, “ruler”, “lion”, “tiger”, “avenger”, “martyr”, “piercer”, “destroyer”, “fearless one”, “deathless one”, “unconquerable one”, etc. Some Jatt clans got their names from the ancestral person who came from a certain place. Jatts are a mix of ancient North Indians and ancient Central Asians, which is why Jatts have skin toning from light skin to medium brown skin. Jatt dynasties and kingdoms were weakened over thousands of years and were separated into different social classes and occupations, but they kept their identity alive and still remain Jatts to this day. Jatts only married within their tribe to other Jatts clans which is why they kept their identity alive all while being a minority since ancient times. Jatts are descendants of blood related family members that now consist up of several clans. All Jatts originate from a single common ancestor who was of “Chandarvanshi” family lineage. Jatts passed on their lineage to their children who would start a new family lineage under their first name. Saroya had five sons named Dhillon, Dhindsa, Dosanjh, Malhi and Sangha. Each one of them founded a new dynasty after they moved and founded new places under their name. The descendants of Dhillon Saroya began to use Dhillon as their family name, the descendants of Dhindsa took on Dhindsa as their last name, the descendants of Dosanjh Saroya adopted Dosanjh as their family name, the descendants of Malhi Saroya took on “Malhi” as their surname and the descendants of Sangha Saroya adopted “Sangha” as their family name. As a result, “Dhillon”, ”Dhindsa”, ”Dosanjh, “Malhi” and “Sangha” all became newly formed Jatt clans, even though they all belonged to the “Saroya” lineage. Similarly, the founders of the Brar clan and the Sidhu clan were brothers who came from the same lineage. In that same way, all Jatts can trace their lineage to “Chandar/Chandra”, a Jatt family dynasty originating in Punjab in ~4000 BCE. Jatt is a general term for a number of cognate clans. When Jatt family dynasties moved from one place to another, their name was spoken differently in other areas of Punjab as there are different dialects of the Punjabi language, so many clan names turned into a different variation of the same Jatt clan names. The Jatts have always been a patrilineal society and rarely married someone outside of their tribe. Jats wouldn’t allow their daughters to marry non-Jatts, so Jatts only married within the Jatt community. Jatts married other Jatts from a different clan and family, which kept them within the Jatt race. The reason for this was to pass on their fighting genes to their children. A Jatt is born a Jatt and remains a Jatt. Jatt is determined by birth and that cannot be changed. Jatts were bred to fight and Jats only married within their tribe to keep their fighting spirit and traditions alive. Punjabi Jatts are the true ancient Jatts who originate in Punjab. Muslim Jats make up around 50% of the Jat population. Sikhs make up around 25% of the Jat population, and Hindus make up the other 25% of the Jat population. However, Muslim Jats & Sikh Jatts are most closely related as all Sikh Jatts were descendants of Punjabi Hindu Jats & Punjabi Muslim Jats (who are also descendants of Punjabi Hindu Jats). All Hindu Jats from Eastern Punjab became Sikhs. All Punjabi Muslim Jats reside in the Western Punjab, a state in Pakistan. Jats who became followers of Muslim saints in Punjab became Muslims. Jats who became followers of Sikh Gurus became Sikhs. Jats from Haryana & Rajasthan are distant relatives of Punjabi Jats who remained Hindus and mixed in with local populations after they migrated south. Around 70% of the total Jat population resides in Punjab (India & Pakistan), while 20% of the Jat population resides in the regions surrounding Punjab, and 10% of the Jatt population resides in the rest of the world. Jatts have more of a right to the land of Punjab because the history of Punjab and the Jatts precedes all the history of India and Pakistan. India and Pakistan are recently created artificial countries in the 1950s. Prominent Muslim saints and all Sikh prophets originate from the Punjab region (India & Pakistan). Dharmic Jatt warriors also originated in ancient Punjab around 4000 BCE. Dharmic Jatts and Sikh Jatts assassinated many prominent emperors, governors, rulers and leaders throughout their history. Jatts have been here way before all their enemies arrived, and Jatts are still here to this day while their enemies have vanished. Gone are the Mongols, Turks and everyone else who tried to bring down the Jatts. To this day, Jatts still own large amounts of land like they did since 4000 BCE, and to this day they remain proud of their history. So the Jatts did indeed come out victorious after all.\n\nProminent Jatts Throughout History\n\nDharmic Jat Warriors – Founders of Santana Dharma.

They reside alongside the Punjab rivers and fight like demons. They are continually rebelling and disobedient to all rulers.”\n\n“No one dares to challenge us or stand in the way of the Turks, but the Jats with their swords and horses humiliate all their enemies.”\n\n”The Jats have shown against all great conquerers the same propensity to fall upon an army undeterred by the heaviest odds and unmindful of the carnage that lies ahead of them on the battlefield.”\n\n“It was again brought to my knowledge that these turbulent Jats were as numerous as ants and that no one passed unscathed from their hands.”\n\n“The Jats are the masters in fighting. It’s best to just avoid them when possible.”\n\n“The Jats are the Gods of this world. Full of confidence and firm of determination, they are prime rulers and the greatest warriors. No one throughout history was able to put away the Jats for good.”\n\n“Jat history is glorious but was never recorded. The history of Jats is the history of India & Pakistan itself.”\n\n“Do not call the Sikhs thieves or dogs, because they are like lions and are courageous like lions. They come charging into the battlefield chanting and roaring. When they come charging with the sword in their hand, it sends shivers down the spine of the enemy. When they raise their spears towards the sky, no one stands a chance against them. They reign terror on the battlefield and do not panic, no matter how badly they’re outnumbered. If you wish to learn the art of war, O swordsmen, learn from them. They advance towards their enemies boldly and return home safely. They are not in the least afraid. They have neither the fear of slaughter nor the dread of death. These Sikhs will demonstrate the art of fighting to you in such a way that one and all will shower them with praise. Truly, they are lions in the battlefield, and at times of peace, they are beyond generous. Besides their fighting, listen to one more thing in which they excel at. They never kill a coward who is running away from the battlefield. There is no adultery among these dogs, nor are they mischievous. There is no thief amongst these dogs, nor is there amongst them any mean people. Now that you’re familiar with the Sikhs, know that these Sikhs have conquered and divided Punjab amongst themselves and have bestowed it amongst the young and old.”\n\n“The Sikhs are deranged swordsmen who fight like demons with absolutely no fear of death. They fight in the name of God and spill the blood of their enemies for their Guru. Surely they are not infidels. These Sikhs were followers of Gobind Singh, the Guru who resided in Amritsar and formed the Khalsa.”\n\n“The Sikhs go into battle undermanned and still come out victorious. From Hind to Sind, no one dares to stand in their way.”\n\n“The Afghan Pathans tried with all their might to wipe out the Sikhs. When the Afghans repeatedly witnessed heaps of bodies being split in half and set ablaze by the Sikhs, they finally stopped and turned back. The Afghan Pathans came to realization they were no match for the Sikhs.”\n\n“Who are these Sikhs who have been barred from entering Gurdwaras and all public spaces, and are banned from all employment opportunities. With no place to eat or sleep, how do the Sikhs not suffer from malnutrition and still have the strength to crush their enemies in the battlefield? The Sikhs are living miracles.”\n\n“The valour of the Sikh Army during the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, under the leadership of the historically most ferocious general Hari Singh Nalwa, came to the Frontier in the 1820’s and swiftly conquered our ancestors. It is the only time in recorded history that our people were ruled over by foreigners. The locals were so terrified of the Sikh Army that they used to hide every time the Sikhs came into view. Those that decided to resist were met with utter ruthlessness. During this time, the word was spread around that the Sikhs did not harm elderly people, women and children, and that the local people who did not wish to earn wrath of the Sikhs should wear the same garbs as the Punjabi people, which was the salwar-kameez. Before that time, both men and women alike, wore only a single-robe garment, similar to that worn by Arabs.”\n\n“Our English cavalry with their blunt swords were most unequally matched against the Sikhs with swords so keen of edge that they would split a hair. They evidently knew that the British sword was blunt and useless, so they kept their horses still and met the British charge by laying flat on their horses’ necks, with their heads protected by their thick turbans and their backs by their shields; and as the British soldiers passed through their ranks, the Sikhs swooped round on them and struck back-handed with their sharp, curved swords, in several instances cutting our cavalry men in two”.\n\n“The British charged at the Sikhs with their bayonets thinking the Sikhs would fold like the Hindus. The degenerate British soldiers were split in half by the Sikhs.”\n\n“All of the fighting occurs in the Punjab region, and mostly involves the Sikhs. If they were willing to do so, Punjab could conquer all of India in less than 24 hours.”\n\n“After witnessing the bravery and the fighting skills of the Sikhs, the British Empire found in them an exhaustible reservoir of militants to further carry out is plans of British conquest.”\n\n“The Sikhs are men of fine physique with a national history of which martial characteristics have been deliberately kept alive by the British Government and by the Sikhs themselves.”\n\n“The major reason for our defeat we’re Sikhs. We were simply unable to do anything before them despite our best efforts. They are very daring people and are fond of martyrdom. Sikhs fight courageously and are capable of defeating an army much larger than them”.\n\n“If I was forced to go into battle and take along with me any group of warriors throughout all of history, without question I would plunge into the battlefield fighting alongside the Sikhs.”\n\n“Most people lack the physical courage and the fighting spirit to suppress even the smallest body of police. The Akali movement is a rural group from Punjab made up of Sikh militants. About 50 of them can cause more havoc than an army of 1000 men.”\n\n“What the Sikhs had to go through, no other group in history would’ve possibly survived.”\n\n“Strong are those who remember their past, and these Sikhs never forget their history.”\n\n“Many religions including Hinduism, Buddhism and Islam were once dominant and prevalent in the Punjab region. But eventually, the Khalsa replaced Islam and the Quran. The Khalsa’s sword and the wisdom of Sikhi was victorious and reigned supreme in Punjab.”\n\nSikh Jatt Clans / Sikh Jatt Family Dynasties\n\n*Note: These are family names of Jatt Sikhs and does not include all Hindu Jat and Muslim Jat clans.
