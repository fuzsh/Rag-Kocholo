        "text": "sivaay pyaar ke main tujhe kuch aur de na saka\n\nthe lead pair has a banter through a song that they sing in a competition. the man's lyrics are focussed on asking for loyalty. he then cheats on her.\n\nthe girl's fake excuse to get out of the city for a day (to go and confront her boyfriend) is her friend's non-existent wedding. she does end up witnessing a wedding on the trip but the groom is her boyfriend.\n\nthe child is raised neither as a Hindu nor as a Muslim. his name, Roshan, is a testament to this. the child's year of birth is mentioned in a dialogue. guess when the child was born.\n\n1947.\n\n*insert a gif of Andrei Tarkovsky saying \"poetic cinema\" ðŸ¤Œ*\n\nOkay so before Yash Chopra killed off guys that leave sad pregnant woman behind he just had the \"nice\" guy just leave the girl behind because he's a spineless little shit and turn into a huge asshole years later! Was not expecting that!\n\nI heard that Yash Chopra's first few films weren't in the typical style he would find in Waqt (and be associated with for the rest of his career) and were more influenced by his older bro BR Chopra so this was very interesting to watch. Mala Sinha was great in this, the discussions around illegitimacy and religion were interesting, and most importantly I loved the ending when everybody was ganging up on Rajendra Kumar and calling him out on his bullshit at the end. Shoutout to the aunt character that was out here ready to throw hands and murder Rajendra Kumar right on the spot! She was barely there but an absolute legend\n\nYash Chopraâ€™s directorial debut blew me away. You can see the precursors to all of which would become his directorial trademarks from the way he captures the little moments, the way he weaves together the various characters and their lives both narratively and visually, and we also get the Yash Chopra Heroine ðŸ¥º the way he paints all the characters (except one as he should!) sympathetically as he presents social commentary and does it so well! This deserves more recognition and yâ€™all need to watch this please."
