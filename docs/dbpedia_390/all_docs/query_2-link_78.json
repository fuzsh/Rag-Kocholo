        "text": "Birmingham and the Black Country have been blessed by an explosion of Desi pubs - offering authentically Punjabi food in a Great British boozer.\n\nNow seven of the Desi pubs in the region are getting their own distinct sign - in Punjabi.\n\nThe Black Country is populated with around 50 successful Asian run pubs which serve traditional Punjabi style dishes including the famous meaty grills - superb washed down with a nice pint. The irresistible combination attracts punters from all over the region.\n\nThese new Punjabi pub signs will be on permanent display at each pub and are a culmination of 18 months of artist and landlord collaboration reflecting the history of migration to the West Midlands from north India.\n\nThe Red Lion in All Saints Way, West Bromwich, The Fourways in Portway Hill in Rowley Regis, Ivy Bush in St Pauls Road, in Smethwick, The Sportsman in West Bromwich High Street, Island Inn in Kenrick Way, West Bromwich, Prince of Wales in West Bromwich High Street and The Red Cow in Smethwick High Street, will have the world’s first Punjabi pub signs.\n\nThe Sportsman pub in West Bromwich features an Indian cricketer. The Pub sign for the Red Cow features a red cow of course, as well as as a dhol player.\n\nAs well as signs, British Punjabi history inspired artwork that was first exhibited in London will be installed in the desi pubs.\n\nA spokesman for Creative Black Country, which is behind the project said: \"Artist residencies have explored the story of the regions desi pubs; a unique Black Country phenomenon.\n\n\" Following a successful exhibition at Southbank Centre and gaining international media attention, we are now pleased to announce that the artworks will be installed in their true homes; our desi pub.\"\n\nThe stunning stained glass windows at The Red Lion in West Bromwich features the Punjabi Workers Association and Malcolm X - a reference to the Sixties when the human rights leader was invited to see first hand the segregation faced by Punjabi workers in pubs and bars around the West Midlands.\n\nAsian landlords have been salvaging the struggling pub trade in the area for decades by reinventing failed pubs for new multicultural communities and as a result redefining British pub culture\n\nThe spokesperson added: “ Now 50 years on, those very pubs that had refused entry to the workers have been saved by the entrepreneurial Punjabi community.\n\n“This significant event is just one that has been captured by Creative Black Country commissioned artists over the past year producing a new body of work that tells the stories of migration from the Punjab to the region.”\n\nSmethwick-born visual artist Hardeep Pandhal created the images for the signs, which were then given to specialist pub sign painter Andrew Grundon to produce.\n\nAll the the artwork and pub signs will be unveiled on Thursday September 29\n\nDo you like the new pub signs?
