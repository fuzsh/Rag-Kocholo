        "text": "What is supply chain management\n\nSupply chain management ( SCM) is the overall process of procuring raw materials to develop into finished products that can be delivered to end-users, such as software, hardware, and other IT and tech services offered by companies. And with the global supply chain remaining a vital concern for businesses across nearly every industry, the value of those with verifiable SCM skills will only increase, especially as IT turns to analytics and other data-related measures to help alleviate issues businesses face with their supply chains.\n\nFor most tech and IT organizations, SCM is a complex undertaking, with several processes and procedures in place to oversee the production flow of goods and services, while also maintaining budgets, costs, and user expectations. Disruptions in the supply chain can cause massive delays to product releases, impacting customer satisfaction and the overall profitability of the business. The supply chain typically involves several departments, with cross-collaboration required between nearly all areas of the business. So managing the supply chain requires precise execution, planning, design, control, and continuous monitoring to ensure final products are delivered on time, under budget, and market-ready.\n\nWhat are the benefits of SCM certification?\n\nSCM jobs in the IT and tech industry typically include titles such as business technology manager, software development manager, operations manager, project manager, supply chain manager, director of operations, and other related titles. For those working in any areas that involve the supply chain, certification can go a long way in validating that you have the right knowledge, expertise, and skillset to help organizations oversee the supply chain. It can be what sets you apart from other candidates who don’t have certifications, reassuring employers that you can quickly step into any supply chain management job.\n\nAnother benefit of certification can come in the form of annual compensation. Data from the Association of Supply Chain Management (ASCM) found that for early to mid-career professionals, earning an ASCM certification can yield professionals a 20% salary increase. And the same can be said for other certifications as well, according to salary data from PayScale. The average salary for a supply chain manager is $89,000 per year, however, those holding a CSCP certification report an average salary of 94,000 per year, and those holding a CPCM certification report an average salary of $113,000 per year. Certifications can be a lucrative path for technology professionals, boosting you above the competition when it comes to salary packages.\n\nWhether you’re already making a career in SCM, or want to break into the field, here are 15 certifications that can round out your resume and give you a leg up on the competition.\n\nTop 15 SCM certifications\n\nASCM Certified in Logistics, Transportation, and Distribution (CLTD)\n\nASCM Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM)\n\nASCM Certified Supply Chain Professional (CSCP)\n\nASCM Certified Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR-P) Endorsement\n\nCertified Six Sigma Black Belt\n\nGAQM Certified Supply Chain Manager (CSCM)\n\nISM Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)\n\nISM Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD)\n\nMSI Chain Management Certification (LSCMC)\n\nNCMA Certified Professional Contract Manager (CPCM)\n\nOracle E-Business Suite 12 Supply Chain Certified Implementation Specialist: Oracle Purchasing Certification\n\nSCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Fundamentals\n\nSCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP)\n\nSOLE Certified Professional Logistician (CPL)\n\nSSGI Supply Chain Management Certification\n\nASCM Certified in Logistics, Transportation, and Distribution (CLTD)\n\nThe Association for Supply Chain Management (ASCM), formerly known as the American Production and Inventory Control Society (APICS), offers a number of certifications to demonstrate your SCM skills. The ASCM Certified in Logistics, Transportation, and Distribution (CLTD) certification is designed for those looking to improve efficiency in distribution and warehousing in order to optimize the overall customer experience. The exam covers best practices around logistics, transportation, and distribution with a focus on topics such as logistics overview, network design, sustainability and reverse logistics, capacity planning, demand management, order and inventory management, and global logistics and transportation. According to the ASCM, CLTD certified professionals report earning 18% higher salaries than those without it. To earn the CLTD designation, you’ll need to pass one exam, and to maintain the certification, you’ll need to earn and submit 75 professional development maintenance points every five years.\n\nExam fee: $1,055 per exam for members, $1,470 per exam for non-members\n\nASCM Certified in Production and Inventory Management (CPIM)\n\nYou’ll need to pass two exams within three years to earn your Production and Inventory Management (CPIM) certification from ASCM, and you’ll need to maintain your certification every five years by completing 75 professional development points. If your certification isn’t maintained within five years, it will expire before the 10-year mark, and you’ll be required to retake the exam. For every year your certification is suspended, you’ll need to submit an additional 15 professional development points. When considering the cost, remember you’ll have to pay the fee for both exams; the fee only applies to one exam at a time. According to ASCM, those with a CPIM certification reported earning up to 23% more per year than their uncertified peers. The exam covers supply chain fundamentals, plan supply, inventory management, continuous improvement and quality management, strategy, sales and operations planning, and inventory, among other topics.\n\nExam fee: Exam is included in the course fee, which varies per program\n\nCertified Six Sigma Black Belt\n\nThe Six Sigma method was designed to streamline quality management and it’s still widely used today to help eliminate waste in processes, identify areas for improvement, and keep track of the supply chain while developing products. The Six Sigma certification scheme is often found within organizations, earning you “belts” as you move from green to black up the certification ladder. It’s typically used in large companies to create paths toward leadership in operations and to maintain a focus on efficiency and quality. The principles in Six Sigma can be extremely helpful for keeping your supply chain lean and agile, and it’s a valuable certification if you’re working in an organization that leans on the Six Sigma method.\n\nExam fee: $128 for an exam voucher\n\nISM Certified Professional in Supply Management (CPSM)\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) offers a Professional in Supply Management (CPSM) certification that validates your knowledge on supply management functions across several industries. The ISM touts the CPSM as the “most recognized supply chain management certification” you can earn. To gain your credentials, you need to pass three exams. The ISM offers several certification paths, including self-paced learning, learning bundles with everything needed for all three exams, guided learning hybrid courses, and classroom-based training onsite at your organization. You can take the three exams in any order but to qualify, you need three years of full-time SCM experience in a position that isn’t clerical or support. To maintain and renew your certification after four years, you need to earn 60 hours of approved continuing education credits. If you already passed ISM’s CPSD certification (see below), you don’t have to take the foundation exam for the CPSM certification, since it’s included in both. If you aren’t already a member, the cost of the non-member fee for the exam also includes one year of ISM Direct membership.\n\nExam fee: $495 for members, $725 for non-members\n\nISM Certified Professional in Supplier Diversity (CPSD)\n\nThe second certification from the ISM is the Certified Professional Supplier Diversity (CPSD) certification, which you can earn on top of the ISM’s CPSM certification. It’s a unique certification that focuses on the growing demand for companies to “engage in supplier diversity to be socially responsible, or to meet customer or federal requirements,” according to the ISM. The CPSD certification consists of two exams, but you can skip the foundational one if you already hold your CPSM exam. To qualify, you need three years of supplier diversity or management experience and a bachelor’s degree, or five years of experience. To maintain your certification, you need to complete 50 hours of approved continuing education credits over a three-year period. According to the ISM, those with a CPSD certification earn around 10% more than their uncertified peers.\n\nThe Oracle E-Business Suite 12 Supply Chain Certified Implementation Specialist certification is targeted at intermediate-level implementation team members who are members of the Oracle PartnerNetwork, with a focus on selling and implementing Oracle E-Business Suite SCM modules. The certification is designed to show employers you have the right skillset to navigate the R12 E-Business Suite, enter data, pull information, form queries, and access online help. You’ll also need to know how to manage the purchasing process, set up and use the R12 Oracle Purchasing software, and navigate purchase orders. The exam covers topics such as navigating in R12 Oracle applications, introduction to Oracle Applications R12, shared entities and integration as well as the fundamentals of Flexfields, Multi-Org, and Workflow and Alerts. It also covers topics such as purchasing, suppliers, document security, routing and approval, RFQs and quotations, approved supplier lists and sourcing rules, requisitions, and automation.\n\nExam fee: $245\n\nSCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Fundamentals\n\nThe SCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Fundamentals certification is an entry-level SCM certification that offers eight certification tracks that cover the most important aspects of SCM. These tracks include SCM principles, transportation operations, demand planning, manufacturing and service operations, customer service operations, warehouse operations, inventory management, supply management, and procurement. There are no eligibility requirements and each exam for the eight tracks consists of a 40-question multiple-choice format, and the credentials don’t expire or need renewal.\n\nExam fee: $200 per certification track\n\nSCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP)\n\nThe SCPro Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals (CSCMP) certification is unique in that it combines a multi-level education with a three-tiered exam process. There are three levels of SCPro certification and the first level, SCPro Level One, covers the fundamentals and eight elements of SCM. At the second level, SCPro Level Two: Analysis and Application of Supply Chain Challenges, you’ll be tested on your ability to apply SCM knowledge in various scenarios. The third and final level, SCPro Level Three: Initiation of Supply Chain Transformation, certifies your ability to “positively impact an organization” through a hands-on project that demonstrates your skills. You need to renew your certification for all three levels every three years, which will require 60 hours of eligible professional development activities. You also need to complete at least 20 hours of professional development annually, but no more than 30 hours per year.\n\nLevel 1 exam fee: $650 for members, $975 for non-members\n\nLevel 2 exam fee: $1,695 for members, $2,350 for non-members\n\nLevel 3 exam fee: N/A\n\nSOLE Certified Professional Logistician (CPL)\n\nThe International Society of Logistics (SOLE) offers a Certified Professional Logistician (CPL) certification in logistics, which is a key element of SCM in certain industries such as commerce, defense, federal and local government agencies, and education. The exam takes place twice a year in May and November over an eight-hour period, with two four-hour sessions, and you’ll need to pass all four parts of the exam before earning your certification. The CPL exam is a relatively advanced certification since to qualify for it, you need at least nine years’ experience practicing or teaching logistics, and two years’ experience in at least two fields of logistics. Each year of undergraduate accredited coursework in logistics subjects is equivalent to one year of professional experience, up to four years. For those with a master’s degree or doctoral degree, you’ll need four or three years’ additional experience, respectively.\n\nExam fee: $225 for members, $375 for non-members\n\nSSGI Supply Chain Management Certification\n\nThe Supply Chain Management certification offered by the Six Sigma Global Institute (SSGI) includes an online, self-paced course, which typically takes students three to five weeks to complete. This course covers everything you need to know about the supply chain and how vital it is to organizations, especially as the supply chain grows more complex with new and emerging technology. You’ll learn about mapping and diagraming, integration, inventory, logistics, cycle time, sourcing, risk, information gathering, relationship management, demand management, continuous improvement, and supply chain optimization. Upon completing the course, you’ll need to pass a 100- question multiple choice exam, which can be completed online within a two-hour time frame.\n\nExam fee: $299\n\nMore on supply chain management:\n\nWhat is supply chain management?
