Affigent will provide products and associated services, training and maintenance. Oracleâ€™s FedRAMP-compliant cloud services span across SaaS, and Iaa. The services will simplify government agenciesâ€™ digital transformation of legacy mission systems securely, efficiently and effectively.\n\nâ€œAs an Oracle partner for more than 10 years, we are proud to have helped hundreds of agencies across the federal government and the Department of Defense implement enterprise-class, reliable cloud and database solutions,â€ added Rivetti.\n\nAs one of the leading small business partners with over 300 Oracle technical and sales certifications, Affigent will continue to accelerate innovation while reducing complexity for its customers.\n\nâ€œFrom building the next generation of government services to improving command decision-making, we are committed to helping agencies protect their existing investments while continuously improving. Having an experienced partner like Affigent to help facilitate this mission is critical to our success,â€ said Randy Zewe, vice president of Federal Channels at Oracle.\n\nAbout Akima\n\nAkima is a global enterprise with more than 7,500 employees, delivering agile solutions to the federal government in the core areas of aviation, construction, facilities and logistics, IT and mission support, protective services and detention management, and systems engineering.\n\nAs a subsidiary of NANA, an Alaska Native Corporation owned by more than 14,300 IÃ±upiat shareholders, Akimaâ€™s core mission is to enable superior outcomes for our customersâ€™ missions while simultaneously creating a long-lived asset for NANA consistent with our IÃ±upiat values.
