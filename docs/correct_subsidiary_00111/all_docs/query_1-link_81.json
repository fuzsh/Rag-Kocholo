        "text": "What is Agile Testing?\n\nAgile is a concept encompassing new values. As its name suggests, it’s essentially a speedy method to work on software development. It highlights the impact of continuous integration where every team member’s work impacts the outcome.\n\nWhy do we prefer Agile?\n\nThe traditional waterfall model for software development was workable. It worked sequentially, with tasks being split over a longer period. However, this posed the obvious drawback of not extracting the most out of resources available.\n\nAgile sought to change this wasteful process. It commences output creation from day one. Upon making requirements and goals clear, work starts almost immediately. As a goal-oriented approach, Agile strategically tackles any bugs or errors in the earliest stages possible, revoking the need to re-work any aspect.\n\nIt earnestly promotes collaborative work between customers, developers, and the testing team. The final output will hence be a well-rounded product.\n\nWhy is it relevant today?\n\nAs mentioned earlier, Agile saves time and resources. This methodology helps product designers keep up with present-day competition. Its continuous pace makes refined solutions and helps maintain efficiency. Additionally, because everyone is kept in the loop, the quality of the product is better.\n\nAgile testers keep up with this pace by embodying the following values:\n\nProvide continuous feedback and critique\n\nDeliver value to the customer\n\nMake room for easier communication\n\nStay courageous\n\nKeep it simple\n\nStrive to upgrade\n\nRespond to change\n\nSelf-organize\n\nFocus on people\n\nEnjoy the process and results!\n\nThe collaborative nature of these principles makes the final output valuable, both business-wise and work-wise."
