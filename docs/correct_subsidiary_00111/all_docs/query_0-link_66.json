        "text": "Executive summary\n\nOracle’s mission is to foster an inclusive environment and leverage the diverse perspectives and backgrounds of all its suppliers, employees, partners, and customers to steer a sustainable competitive advantage globally. Oracle’s portfolio for Cloud application development accelerates the making of mobile, cloud, and web-native applications that allow business developers and users to develop incredible apps that solve their real problems quickly. Oracle Corporation derives its strength from its ability to research, develop, and operate Oracle labs where a variety of projects like adaptive optimization, network computing, computer architecture, and performance modeling (CAP), among others, take place. These projects give the company a competitive advantage. Oracle is dedicated to operating its business and maintaining its facilities to minimize environmental impact. Through employee involvement and a combination of green-minded business practices, Oracle tries to implement best environmental practices, and its efforts play a major role in the company’s overall initiatives in corporate citizenship. Oracle is also known for employee voluntarism, respect for the environment, charitable giving, and a strong commitment to improving education. The company’s volunteers give their talents and time not just to serve the underserved population but also to enrich and bring value to the life of the people where they work and live.\n\nA report about Oracle Corporation Submitted to the Chief Executive Office Hyperlink Infosystems.\n\nOracle Corporation (Company-1) is a multinational cloud-technology and computer Software Company based in the United States and headquartered in Redwood, California. Oracle Corporation was started by Larry Ellison, Ed Oates, and Bob Miner in 1977 as a relational database (RDB) company but has grown into a major player in the computing and technology world with a strong stand of $137 billion in total assets(Oracle Corporation, 2022). Today, Oracle is the largest supplier of system software for database management and the second-largest independent service and Software Company worldwide behind Microsoft. Oracle’s major business activities involve developing and marketing a combined line of computer software products for computer-aided system engineering, database management, decision support, and application development (Oracle Corporation, 2022). The company also develops families of software products used for human resource, manufacturing, and financial applications, also known as ERP-Software or enterprise resource planning. Oracle markets its products through its subsidiaries in more than 140 countries alongside other related educational, consulting, support, and integration service systems.\n\nHyperlink Infosystems (Company-2) is a well-known company that develops mobile apps and offers the best IT Software solutions. Hyperlink Infosystem is based in New York and was founded by Harnil Ozi, its Chief Executive Officer (CEO), in 2011 (www.hyperlinkinfosystem.com). The company specializes in crafting eye-catchy and most innovative websites and mobile apps. It offers a variety of customized mobile apps, Game development, website development, AR-VR Development, Blockchain development services, among others. Hyperlink Infosystem takes pride in their products engineered to bring growth to the business and their workforce that is widely skilled to deliver services that do not compromise on quality or time (www.hyperlinkinfosystem.com). The company measures its success from how people enjoy, obtain, and share advantages of the efficacy of their products. Hyperlink Infosystem’s values are growth, hard work, enthusiasm, integrity, and teamwork. It has proper and good coordination for companies it envisions for partnership as it has an enhanced and balanced brand sales and equity that determine the results of the IT services it provides. That is why its CEO seeks to find a partnership with Oracle Corporation. Hence, this report seeks to provide Hyperlink Infosystem with in-depth information about Oracle’s mission, vision, organizational structure, objectives, market ethics and business practices, its ability to deliver its objectives using its processes and employees (www.hyperlinkinfosystem.com). The report will also provide a SWOT analysis of the company, explore its opportunities, and analyze its social and ethical impact on relevant information technologies, including its associated ethics and social responsibilities.\n\nOracle Corporation’s Mission, vision, and Organizational Structure.\n\nOracle’s mission is to foster an inclusive environment and leverage the diverse perspectives and backgrounds of all its suppliers, employees, partners, and customers to steer a sustainable competitive advantage globally. Oracles’ vision is to become an institution that aids its customers and provides its employees with a better working environment (Oracle Corporation, 2022). Notably, oracle’s vision statement enshrines its mission statement, and together they empower the organization to achieve its envisioned goals. Likewise, the company’s vision and mission provide employees with ways to be innovative and creative for the development and growth of the company (Oracle Corporation, 2022). Oracle’s values, mutual respect, integrity, and teamwork, impact its general working environment and spiritual growth.\n\nOrganizational structure\n\nOracle Corporation does not have a well-developed hierarchical structure because most employees work in virtual offices and teams. Mostly, the organization’s Human Resource Department recruits employees and sends them to the international offices in Africa, Europe, Asia, North America among others, However, the company has structure levels that consist of sub- intra organizational or individual levels that involve local tasks carried out by a group of people in a different organization using processes for distance communication Also, there is an organizational level where information technology is used to synchronize the organization’s activities Lastly, there is an inter-organizational level where different organizations locally and internationally use information technology to coordinate economic activities.\n\nOracle Corporation’s Objectives, Market, Ethics and Business Practices\n\nOracle Corporation’s objective, which is to identify and exploit the full value of its customers, is designed to protect the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of both the company and customer data. Another objective for Oracle is to provide a safe and better working environment for its employees (Banks, 2012). Oracle is committed to transparency based on market ethics and business practices and believes in doing business honestly. According to Oracle Corporation (2017)’s report on codes of ethics and business conduct, the company has no tolerance for bribery and corruption. It must comply with laws on anti-corruption such as the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corruption Practice (FCPA) in all countries in which it does business Oracle is also devoted to ensuring that its partners comply with all laws applicable in the business, including the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws (Oracle Corporation, 2017) In support of this objective, the company’s management carries out an enhanced review of transactions in chosen geographies and obtains end-user information and documentation if necessary for anti-bribery compliance while entirely respecting the anti-trust laws.\n\nAdditionally, when acquiring goods, services, and contracts from and by government entities, Oracles strictly observes the rules, regulations, and laws that govern these transactions. Moreover, Oracle complies with all laws and regulations that pertain to global imports, exports, and economic sanctions. Compliance with these laws protects the ability of Oracle to conduct business internationally. The company’s market code of conduct also stipulates that no one is allowed to obtain branded information or any other information about its competitors or partners illegally or in a manner that lacks integrity and breaches confidentiality and agreements of the parties (Oracle Corporation, 2017). Notably, Oracle’s employees, leadership, and management are tasked with the responsibility to learn and comply with all the rules and regulations when accepting partnerships and contracts and when dealing with fellow employees, government officials, customers, and investors.\n\nHowever, Oracles can pay for certain gifts and other bona fide business expenses for third parties if only it complies with the company’s Anti-corruption policy and is done without an intent of corruption (Oracle Corporation, 2017). Similarly, Oracle can accept unsolicited business courtesies and gifts from potential or actual suppliers, customers, or business partners if they are of modest and reasonable amount and nature, are not meant to influence business decisions and are justified to be of a legitimate and clear business purpose. Oracle Corporation’s ability to deliver its objectives using its processes and employees\n\nProviding a better working environment is one of oracle’s objective To deliver this objective, Oracle strives to meet the expectations of its employees by developing newly powered artificial intelligence innovations which simplify complicated Human Resource processes and enhance experience among employees (Oracle Corporation, 2018) Additionally, Oracle updates the Oracle Human Capital Management (HCM) Cloud, a software application that offers solutions related to Human Resource (HR) from the time the employees are hired to the time they retire Today, the demands of the talent economy are rapidly changing, posing a challenge for HR experts to rethink better processes that can provide a holistic view of employee experience on talents, career aspirations, and skills (Oracle Corporation, 2018) The company’s HCM Cloud addresses this problem by helping the HR team to reimagine talent and employee processes to build a stronger team quickly, reduce turnover, and achieve a meaningful alignment of every employee’s job responsibility, including overall business objectives for the organization Furthermore, HCM Cloud allows HR experts to handle the ever-changing business environment and workforce expectations by providing a powerful and complete platform that traverses the entire life cycle of employees (Oracle Corporation, 2018), making their work more agile, simpler, and smarter.\n\nOracle uses Clout ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) to deliver the objective of customer visibility and satisfaction Clout ERP enables the organization to have cross-departmental customer data visibility by breaking down databases and silos An increase in visibility provides a tailored experience for each customer and leads to better departmental collaborations (Miller, 2020) The company’s cloud solution is available to customers wherever they are and is a great technology when working remotely Clout ERP allows customers to access all Oracle information through their computer or mobile devices, as well as eliminate processes that are time-consuming during report generation (Miller, 2020) Additionally, Oracle uses the Internet of Things (IoT) to reevaluate its present models in business and adopt new models for operation IoT removes barriers between the organization and customers (Oracle Corporation, 2020) Hence, Oracle makes intelligent business decisions that begin with services and flows down to innovations that meet customer expectations due to data provided by related devices and data cycled back into the organization, making it a sought-after investment and partnership company.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility and SWOT Analysis\n\nOracle Corporation operates a circular and energy-efficient cloud that will help the company achieve a 100% energy renewal by 2025 in all its next-generation cloud data center On resource management (Oracle Corporation, 2017), Oracle looks for ways to reduce gas emissions from their greenhouses, increase energy efficiency, and reduce waste generation and water consumption across their operations The company envisions achieving zero net emissions by 2050 and split the gas emissions across its supply chain and operations by 2030, compared to the 2020 standards (Oracle Corporation, 2017) These targets have been permitted by Exponential Roadmap Initiative, a United Nations accredited partner to the Race to Zero campaign For Oracle, sustainability is the business of everyone, so it supports its employees to help them build stronger communities and become good planet stewards by recognizing and awarding those who are taking the lead Additionally, Oracle supports several non-profit organizations worldwide through sponsorship, cash grants, and office giving (Oracle Corporation, 2017) Throughout the year, Oracle engages in volunteer work worldwide, acting on their desire to assist the planet and people Some of the volunteer work the company has participated in include tutoring students and the blind on basic life and safety skills, mentoring and tutoring youth who are disadvantaged, providing companionship for isolated and lonely elders, and building housing and playgrounds for families with low-income to refresh and transition them into better neighborhoods (Oracle Corporation, 2017) Notably, the company undertook 1,600 projects in the year 2019.\n\nOracle Corporation’s SWOT Analysis\n\nOracle Corporation derives its strength from its ability to research, develop, and operate Oracle labs where a variety of projects like adaptive optimization, network computing, computer architecture, and performance modeling (CAP), among others take place These projects give the company a competitive advantage (Dudovskiy, 2012) Likewise, the strategy of organic growth enables the company to acquire a robust market position and the current state of the brand Also, the company thrives from the personality of Larry Ellison who is believed to possess a charismatic and strong leadership attributes.\n\nNotably, Oracle’s weaknesses relate to its heavy dependency On Europe and American marketplaces. During the 2009-2010 fiscal year, the operating revenue of the company from the European and US market escalated to 64% of the businesses’ total revenue (Dudovskiy, 2012). Hence, Oracle’s lack of presence in the Asian market decreases its revenue because Asian businesses’ role is growing in international business. Furthermore, the company heavily relies on alliances and partnerships instead of direct market entry when expanding to international markets, limiting its control of operations internationally.\n\nTo achieve growth in the long term, Oracle has a range of opportunities to use. These opportunities include the generation of additional income by increasing the investment levels through the development of virtual software programs, increasing its presence in the Indian and Chinese markets, and increasing its market share by growing its software market in the global business platforms (Dudovskiy, 2012) Similarly, Oracle can grow by sophisticating its services in data storage considering the increasing demand of this type of service (Dudovskiy, 2012) Also, it can launch initiatives on research and development to build innovative applications for the business for different types of devices, thus, increase revenue for the company.\n\nOracle has to effectively address specific threats based on threats to gain future sustainable growth. For instance, the emergence of new Indian and Chinese competitors or other evolving Eastern superpowers is a major threat for the company (Dudovskiy, 2012). With such a threat, Oracle can find it difficult to compete with these competitors on price, considering that such competitors easily access cheaper resources. Besides, the Wall Street Journal (2000) accentuated that Larry Ellison, Oracle’s CEO, uses ”dirty tricks” such as hiring experts to examine Microsoft’s garbage, with the intention of finding evidence to accuse them of wrongdoing (Dudovskiy, 2012) Such ticks are a threat to the company as they might lead to the damage of the company’s image in the future.\n\nReasons why Hyperlink Infosystems should partner with Oracle Corporation\n\nProgressively, Oracle continues to reinvent itself for the environment of cloud-computing that triumphs and competes with a market that is believed to be huge but addressable in the public cloud today. Meanwhile, Oracle has been a generator of strong cash flow and has had a reliable decade long history of returning shareholder’s excess cash in the form of dividends, and devotes its billions of dollars to repurchase its shares From the partnership standpoint, here are the key merits for oracle:\n\nThe company’s ability to present an application development framework that simplifies decision-making steps by architectures to develop and run apps that are resilient, highly available, compliant, and fully secure using technology recommendations and sets of design principles So, if you are looking for a platform where there is the development of integrated and open applications, you can easily use Oracle cloud to build intelligent and modern applications Secondly, Oracle’s portfolio for Cloud application development accelerates the making of mobile, cloud, and web-native applications that allow business developers and users to quickly develop incredible apps that solve their real problems For example, you can easily create a 38X enterprise application faster with fewer codes of 20X using oracle’s APEX The cloud-native services that Oracle offers bring innovation faster to markets aiming to transform businesses These governed services are founded on open standards and source workloads for profitability and interoperability with third-force software.\n\nThirdly, among enterprise mobile platform providers, Oracle is at the forefront because of its focus on providing out-of-the-box and task-specific mobile apps that will help Hyperlink have an open and complete platform that will enable it to develop and deliver better and smarter mobile apps Similarly, Oracle has partnered with companies like AuraPlayer, RapidValue, Syniverse, MobileIron, and Sofbang (Chang, 2016) Partnering with these companies together with Oracle’s mobile partner ecosystem and other partnership initiatives, Oracle can provide Hyperlink with complete and flexible solutions that allow the faster provision of more engaging and better mobile apps Moreover, oracle’s ability to derive strength from its research, development, and operation of Oracle labs where a variety of projects like adaptive optimization, network computing, computer architecture, and performance modeling (CAP), among others, take place will influence and enhance Hyperlink app developers’ ability to create mobile experiences that are engaging intuitively and simply (Chang, 2016) Lastly, Hyperlink can ride on or take advantage of Oracle’s weakness in heavily relying on alliances and partnerships instead of direct market entry when expanding to international markets, which limits its control of operations internationally. Hyperlink company can use this weakness and its ability to penetrate international markets to lure Oracle Corporation into partnering with it.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAfter analyzing Oracle Corporation’s major organizational and market aspects, our team concludes that Hyperlink can partner with Oracle Corporation. Oracle makes intelligent business decisions that begin with services and flows down to innovations that meet customer expectations due to data provided by related devices and data cycled back into the organization, making it a sought-after investment and partnership company. Furthermore, Oracle is committed to transparency and believes in doing business honestly. The company has no tolerance for bribery and corruption. It must comply with laws on anti-corruption such as the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corruption Practice (FCPA) in all countries in which it does business Oracle is also devoted to ensuring that its partners comply with all laws applicable in the business, including the anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws Such attributes assure Hyperlink that it will be safe partnering with Oracle Also, the fact that Dave Murashige, the General Manager of Syniverse, one of Oracle’s partners, says that he is delighted to partner with Oracle and being part of Oracle Mobile Cloud marketplace service that enables them to serve a wider business customer segment sheds Hyperlink with satisfaction that partnering with Oracle is a delight.\n\nReferences\n\nBanks, M.
