        "text": "With ever-increasing pressure to increase the pace of product innovation and to improve management of product cost, quality and compliance, it is vital to improve product management across the extended product network. This involves the enablement of more efficient processes, with increasing visibility to the broader product community, and the collaboration on a consistent set of product content, having the appropriate security in place.\n\nAgile Product Collaboration provides enterprise visibility, management and collaboration of new and changing product record information across the product lifecycle and the extended supply chain. Agile PC also serves as the foundation for product lifecycle management (PLM), providing the product data management capabilities, with integrative potential to broader PLM processes, such as cost management, portfolio & project management, compliance management, quality management, and other enterprise processes associated with the product record.\n\nThe Agile Integration Framework provides a robust means of integrating Agile PC to authoring tools as well as execution systems, and leverages an event framework for triggering process and data integrations at specified points in your product processes\n\nThe need to improve product quality management in the manufacturing and service phases of the product lifecycle is only half the equation. There is a greater benefit when companies can analyze product quality factors since such insight can drive improved design very early in the development process. Agile Product Quality Management provides a collaborative environment across the extended enterprise where teams dynamically update, access, and analyzes information about product quality from internal departments, customers, and suppliers. Such visibility in a platform supports more-intelligent decisions about next-generation products.\n\nAgile PLM Product Quality Management (PQM) is an enterprise level configurable quality management solution tightly integrated into the product record, facilitating product quality management from concept through obsolescence within a closed-loop, corrective action environment.\n\nWith the importance of product velocity and corporate investment decisions, it is becoming vital to better manage your product portfolio, and the alignment of corporate resources to key product launches, programs and projects.\n\nProduct Portfolio Management (PPM) provides enterprise level, configurable project management and collaboration, with resource and deliverable tracking and control, across the New Product Development & Introduction portfolio with a seamless integration into PLM\n\nKey Agile Product Portfolio Management Features:\n\nNPD&I Program & Project Management\n\nTrue phase-gate controls and dependencies tightly integrated to the deliverables (Product Record)\n\nSupply Chain Project Collaboration\n\nDynamic Portfolio Analysis and Control\n\nGantt Chart for real-time and dynamic project definition\n\nDashboards for Management\n\nKey Benefits:\n\nGlobal Visibility for Project Health Status\n\nCoordinate schedules & deliverables across sites, organizations, and partners\n\nProject tracking drilled down to task levels\n\nEnables Globalized collaborative Design and Project Execution\n\nEnables predictability of schedules & resource utilization for NPD&I\n\nProvides predefined Program and Project Templates for future projects planning\n\nFeatured Solutions:\n\nCandor has significant experience and expertise in extending the value of Agile PPM, having Industry-specific predefined Templates, for management of processes\n\nNew Product Introduction\n\nPrepare readily available project templates for project managers, to define their future project plans\n\nEnsure the task completion only upon meeting the deliverables / mile stones\n\nKeeping the projects on track, by setting up needs attention before going to off-track\n\nResource management with load balancing\n\nProduct Compliance to evolving mandates and standards continues to become ever more important, as it relates to product management. OEM manufacturers are required to take global responsibility to dispose of, recycle, or re-use electronics that contain hazardous substances. In addition to satisfying FDA regulations and ISO standards, any company that sells electronics equipment in an international market is subject to the OEM manufacturing regulations of their targe\n\nAgile Product Governance & Compliance Management enables companies to integrate Compliance mandates and standards to their Product Record. Agile Product Governance & Compliance (PG&C) is designed to help manufacturers manage all kinds of product compliance, including the ability to audit the presence and amount of regulated substances used in their products, and to demonstrate that they responsibly dispose of, recycle, or re-use parts containing those substances."
