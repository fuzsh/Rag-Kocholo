According to joint research from AICPA & CIMA and Oracle, 86% of agile finance leaders have a digital-first and cloud-first mindset. It’s through technology that agile leaders gain efficiencies and intelligent process automation.\n\n2\n\nDigital Intelligence\n\nAgile finance teams understand how to generate insights leveraging cloud and advanced technologies to drive decisions that create business value. Agile teams uncover new insights by relying on advanced technologies like artificial intelligence and machine learning to uncover hidden patterns, make accurate planning and forecasting recommendations, and learn continually from the non-stop flow of business data. Some organizations have a long way to go—according to research from AICPA/CIMA and Oracle, 37% of finance teams spend more time collecting data than analyzing it.\n\n3\n\nBusiness Influence\n\nLeading finance teams adopt the skills and organizational factors to move beyond reporting and use data-driven insights to influence the direction of the business. With reduced time spent on manual reporting processes and armed with accurate and timely data, finance leaders are empowered to partner with the business, recommend new courses of action, and influence business strategy. Recent research from AICPA revealed only 10% of finance leaders say they have the skills they need to support the organization’s digital ambitions.\n\nTrends in finance agility\n\nRecent research indicates that the acceleration of trends like digital transformation has highlighted the need for finance and accounting to adopt and agile mindset and begin to build new competencies in agile. A survey from AICPA’s Future of Finance Leadership Advisory Group showed “agile” among the top five competencies that finance and accounting professionals need for the future.\n\nAccording to the 15th annual State of Agile Report from Digital.ai—the longest continuous yearly review of agile techniques and practices—finance and accounting had among the lowest adoption rates compared to other corporate functions, such as IT, marketing, operations, and HR."
