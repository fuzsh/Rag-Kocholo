        "text": "Creating and supporting great products requires innovation, data analysis, team collaboration, consistent quality, and safety checks, along with a strong commercialization plan. All this is impossible to manage without the right PLM software. With several PLM software options available on the market, it is not easy to choose one according to your requirements. We have picked out two SaaS PLM solutions: Oracle PLM Cloud and Arena PLM, and we'll discuss their strengths and differences.\n\nDisclaimer: Although GoSaaS is an Oracle partner, this article is strictly dependent on research done based on material in the public domain and opinions formed by the author for the benefits of product companies making PLM software decisions. This in no way represents the opinion of Oracle Corporation.\n\n1. Usage\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nProduct revision control is automatic. If a new revision takes place, it is rolled up to the parent.\n\nFor one item, there can be several change orders.\n\nOnce all approvers have approved a document, the platform automatically approves the process. This can be set to automatic or manual.\n\nIf a new vendor is added to the team, the team is updated at all places in the system.\n\nThe user interface is modern, easy and intuitive.\n\nNo limit on mass item uploading and creation.\n\nArena PLM\n\nProduct revision control is manual, and there is no auto-rev-up for parent items.\n\nOnly one change order is possible for one item.\n\nEven if all approvers approve a document, the platform still requires administrator approval for the process.\n\nThere is no bulk permissions update, so when a new vendor is onboarded, the person must be manually added to every change order.\n\nThe user interface could be updated.\n\nThere is a limit on mass item uploading and creation.\n\n2. Modules\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nBuilt on the success of Agile PLM 9 from the ground up, Oracle PLM Cloud is part of Oracle’s SaaS suite. It is a Cloud PLM software that brings together product innovation, development, and commercialization with the help of:\n\nInnovation Management\n\nProduct Development\n\nQuality Management\n\nProduct Master Data Management\n\nConfigurator Modelling\n\nProject Management\n\nGoSaaS Environmental Governance and Compliance (EG&C) - add-on\n\nGoSaaS Employee Training System - add-on\n\nCommercialization\n\nOracle PLM Cloud has every module to innovate, develop, commercialize a product, and governance & compliance.\n\nArena PLM\n\nDeveloped a few decades prior, Arena PLM was the first SaaS PLM in the market targeted at high-tech startups. It has come a long way since then and is used by hundreds of customers worldwide. With an interface similar to the old Agile PLM, the main modules in Arena PLM include:\n\nProduct Development\n\nProduct Record Control\n\nChange Management\n\nProject Management\n\nQuality Management\n\nTraining Management\n\nRequirement Management\n\nRegulatory & Compliance\n\nThough the PLM solutions modules are incredibly similar, Arena PLM modules generally lack the depth of features needed by larger or even mid-size deployment. Module-wise it lacks a detailed module dedicated to Innovation Management and Product Master Data Management and Commercialization. The compliance module supports necessary regulations as one roll-up engine is present, unable to support regulations such as Conflict Minerals. Additionally, there is no segregation between suppliers and manufacturers.\n\n3. Updates\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nQuarterly updates with bug fixes.\n\nArena PLM\n\nFrequent updates\n\n4. BOM, Workflows & Security Roles\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nLike other PLM software, Oracle PLM Cloud stores information regarding items, parts, products, BOM, documents, requirements, engineering change orders, and quality workflows. The solution also supports attachments and documents. Other than that, not only is the BOM history also stored, but workflows are also customizable. For security purposes, information can be visible based on assigned roles and approval history for change orders can be tracked.\n\nArena PLM\n\nArena PLM stores information regarding parts, documents, BOM, and change orders, all of which can be directly modified. Change reviews are also automated.\n\nThe solution also captures electrical, mechanical, and software designs along with needed documentation. BOM history is also stored, and the solution also has an auto number wizard. Workflows are pre-built meaning there is no customization possibility. Arena PLM also allows access based on roles making information sharing secure.\n\n5. Validation Rules Extensibility/Customizations/App Marketplace\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nOracle PLM Cloud also has Application Composer, which allows the administrator to configure applications, layouts and make data model changes. Page composer allows configuration of application pages. This includes changing fields, managing saved searches and changing page layouts.\n\nArena PLM\n\nCustomizations of workspace terms, names, and workflows are not possible in Arena PLM. There is a validation package in Arena that validates change and document management, design controls, electronic records, electronic signatures, and quality management. Arena PLM does not have an Application Composer, Page Composer and a REST API layer.\n\n6. Reporting and Analytics\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nAd hoc reports, dashboards, alerts and extensive reports can be created in Oracle PLM Cloud using Oracle Transactional Business Intelligence (OTBI). Report or dashboard can also be added to a Fusion page through Personalization.\n\nArena PLM\n\nArena PLM can be used with Arena Analytics for insights and metrics for analysis.\n\nInteractive and intuitive dashboards are also present without help from IT teams.\n\n7. Platform, Database & Security\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nEvery customer has its own autonomous database based on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Gen two cloud. Oracle is known for its databases, and they have it covered. Oracle is unique from a Security and Infrastructure perspective because they control everything from the hardware to the SaaS layer. Some large companies (Zoom) have recently selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure due to its performance and security. Oracle has several options for regulated industries, including break-glass, where a company can control and approve individuals at Oracle that have access to any customer data layer. This is a unique offering.\n\nArena PLM\n\nArena is most likely using another third-party cloud platform which has their own robust security. However, it was unclear whether Arena is just hosted on these platforms or uses native services. If it is only hosted and has not been updated, this may cause further investigation.\n\n8. Integrations\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nOracle Cloud Infrastructure has its Integration platform, which is extremely flexible and doesn’t require code changes to update business rules. It is fully integrated with Oracle PLM and has pre-built or partner adapters for 1000s of systems.\n\nArena PLM\n\nIt has integration capabilities with ERP systems of SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, Microsoft Dynamics, QAD, Expandable, SAP Business ByDesign, sage, xTuple, rootstock, Kenandy, EDA & MCAD systems of Altium, OrCAD, Mentor, Solidworks, Electronic component databases systems of Octopart, SiliconExpert Technologies, Q Point Technology, CRM systems of Salesforce, Zendesk, Quality Assurance & Control systems of 1factory and SSO systems of Ping Identity.\n\n9. Implementation time, cost and free trials\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nThis can vary according to the customer’s needs, but the minimum is likely to be around 13 weeks. However, the time and cost from On-Premise to Cloud Migration can differ. Oracle does not offer free trials currently.\n\nArena PLM\n\nArena PLM is easy to set up as the implementation process is short and configurations are fixed. The simplicity of features in Arena PLM is an advantage when it comes to implementation time and cost. This may be an issue if the company intends to scale up and may require more customizations. Along with ease in setup, it offers free trials, has a low initial cost.\n\nComparison Summary\n\nProperties\n\nArena PLM\n\nOracle PLM Cloud\n\nInterface\n\nLike Agile PLM\n\nExtremely user friendly\n\nPrice Range\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\nHosted on\n\nCloud\n\nCloud\n\nSupported on Mobile\n\nYes\n\nYes - has dedicated Fusion apps\n\nCollaboration\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nSocial Network\n\nYes - Arena Scribe\n\nYes - OSN\n\nFree Trial\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nQuality Module\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nIntegrations\n\nERP, EDA, MCAD, Electronic component databases, CRM, Quality Assurance & control and SSO\n\nPossible with 1000s of systems\n\nCompliance Module\n\nYes\n\nGoSaaS EG&C\n\nInnovation Module\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nCommercialization\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nChange Management\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nAnalytics\n\nYes - Arena Analytics\n\nYes - OTBI\n\nWorkflows\n\nYes-not customizable\n\nYes\n\nCustomer Size\n\nMid-market to Multi-national level enterprise\n\nAll\n\nPopular Industry usage\n\nhigh tech, medical device, and consumer electronics industries\n\nAll\n\nConclusion"
