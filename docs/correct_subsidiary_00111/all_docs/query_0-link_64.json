BEA Systems 433 5. Siebel Systems 258 6. Hyperion Solutions 28 7. Pillar Data Systems 24 8. Art Technology Group 18 9. Endeca Technologies 14 10. Agile Software Corp 12 11. Peoplesoft 11 12. Imation Corp 11 13. RightNow Tech 10 14. Storage Technology Corp 10 15. SealedMedia 7\n\nLimiting to Publication date from 1994-2013.\n\nAs George White suggests in another answer, this list excludes: patents licensed to Oracle, patents held in holding companies controlled by Oracle but not obviously affiliated with Oracle and patents purchased by Oracle where assignment was not registered with the USPTO.\n\nHow complete a list are you looking for? It isn't too hard to search patent databases by assignee. It is also not too hard to get the names of major subsidiaries. However the assgnee in the database is the orignial assignee only. A patent may have been bought and sold ten times but on its face still has the original assignee as of the day the issue fee was paid. It is very hard to track down patents that a company may have bought from others or have may that they have an exclusive license. Worse, not every assignment is recorded with the patent office and often even major manufacturers have off-shore patent holding companies with names that do not help identify the real owner without a lot of leg work."
