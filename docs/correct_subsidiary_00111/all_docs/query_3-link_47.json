        "text": "Competition in the banking industry is intensifying. Next-generation banks using core banking software are winning market share by targeting lucrative niches in the value chain, forcing incumbent banks to review their legacy platforms.\n\nThe good news is that there is a lot of core banking software to help banks modernize quickly and efficiently. The global core banking software market is expected to grow from $12.51 billion in 2022 to $40.67 billion by 2029, at a CAGR of 18.3% in forecast period, according to the research. Consequently, more core banking providers are working on their products. These banking software solutions companies choose various models of software delivery. Some of them work on a subscription model, while others provide white-label on-premise products.\n\nWhat is core banking?\n\nCore banking (centralized online real-time exchange) is a banking service provided by a group of networked bank branches where customers may access their bank account and perform basic transactions from any of the member branch offices. It includes basic banking activities such as deposit and withdrawal operations, account management, loan and credit processing, customer support and other related services.\n\nIn traditional banking systems, core banking was typically handled by a mainframe computer or central server that stored customer account information and processed transactions. However, with the advent of digital technologies, core banking has evolved to include online and mobile banking services.\n\nWhat’s the best core banking software in the world?\n\nCore banking software is the most crucial part of every bank. Banking software is the engine behind the creation and management of accounts, balances, transactions, journal entries along with the storage of client data, receipts, and other reporting tools.\n\nGood soft relies on composable architecture connected by APIs that allows decoupling distribution channels, products, and client data. This particularly agile architecture enables them to make quick changes in architecture while providing a continuous digital customer experience.\n\nBuild a neobank on top of SDK.finance platform\n\nSpeed up the software development\n\nAbout the product\n\nOnboarding, payments processing, card issuing, and KYC services have to be then integrated into the core banking software. Some core banking system providers offer integration with these tools’ vendors or develop their own products you can integrate into your neobank software solutions. However, it is better not to rely on one vendor, but to prioritise digital retail banking solutions that work on balanced, ready-for-integration products, that do not limit you with features and functions you will integrate into it.\n\nDeveloping a core banking systems in-house is a complicated and time-consuming process that can overwhelm teams and delay product launches. As such, very few banks have their own banking platforms.\n\nRevolut, N26, Tandem, O2 Banking have outsourced their core banking software from FinTech providers. New cloud-based platforms with pre-integrated key features help to assemble best in class products and launch them at a much faster pace and lower capital expenditure.\n\nWe have prepared the Top Core Banking Software list to talk about the best products in the world. We did not want to create a core banking system ranking, as it is hard to find metrics for estimation.
