While several years ago scalability was a serious competitive advantage for any ERP, it is a must-have feature now. According to the company’s official website, NetSuite scales with your company as your business evolves from pre-revenue through IPO and beyond. Thys, even the smallest company can rely on Oracle to accelerate its business growth.\n\nThe built-in flexibility of NetSuite is another thing we’d like to draw your attention to. The platform provides the ability to scale up, spin-off, and adopt new business models with ease. NetSuite’s flexibility lets you do it all without any headaches keeping your configurations and customizations with every upgrade.\n\nERP will rapidly become your core business system, increasing the efficiency of customer-facing commerce experience. Since we’ve described it above, let’s proceed to another benefit of NetSuite.\n\nAnother critical aspect of the platform is its native business intelligence. Due to real-time analytics, you can always find the most suitable solutions and make well-informed decisions. Vital business data is displayed from within the system, helping you do your daily duties.\n\nPros & Cons of Oracle Netsuite\n\nWhile the benefits above are provided by Oracle itself, we’ve decided to explore what other people say about NetSuite. Luckily, there are websites like SoftwareAdvice, which help us get a better understanding of various solutions. Below, you can see some pros and cons of using the system provided by its customers.\n\nThe average rating of NetSuite is 4.1 based on 46 reviews. It is quite easy to use (4/5) and provides decent functionality (4/5), but customer support has a room for improvement (3.5/5). Users also think that it is not worth its money for 100% – the rating is 3.5/5.\n\nAccording to Ray from Call One, Netsuite has met the needs of his company in the ERP migration and has a robust CRM/e-commerce capabilities. The author highlights the following positive aspects of the platform. Firstly, it combines an ERP/CRM and e-commerce system within one platform. Secondly, everything is available in a cloud, increasing the usability of the software. Thirdly, you get your software updated twice a year. Thus, the software evolves and gets better and better.\n\nAs for negative aspects, Ray says that there are too many capabilities and many of them require additional customizations and, as a result, expenditures of time and money.\n\nAccording to Megan from Tenex Corporation, NetSuite is very user-friendly, and we cannot argue with this statement. Besides, it provides customizable reports. Megan also highlights the fact that it’s a cloud-based software so that you can use it anywhere!\n\nThe author also complains that the software is so robust. Therefore, the initial setup takes a while to customize the screens to make them suitable for your needs.\n\nSagit from Candywirez refers to the extensive functionality of NetSuite in the context of a positive feature. According to this user, Netsuite’s functions make any business run efficiently and smoothly. Besides, the program is very user-friendly – others also highlight this aspect. At the same time, Sagit also says that it can get a little confusing to set up you Netsuite the way you want it. Due to a wide variety of options, customizing your homepage can get a little bit tedious.\n\nDaniel from Netfortris also thinks that the system is easy to use. Besides, it offers excellent reporting features and unique overall experience. Cloud nature is also a plus. As for negative moments, Daniel complains about lacking product support. Fulfilling a request takes a long time.\n\nAmy from Floracopeia says that NetSuite is excellent for tracking stats and employee accountability on tasks. But some difficulties may occur when you create manufacturing work orders in bulk. For instance, the system duplicates them or pulls up ones that are out of stock.\n\nAmanda from Jonathan Adler likes NetSuite for the ability to keep track of product SKUs, customers, and inventory – all in one place. Another positive aspect of the system is the ability to run reports and check stock most naturally.\n\nThe biggest problem occurs when customers are entered in multiple times – you have to edit this manually.\n\nAccording to Stephanie from Specified Components Company, the two most substantial benefits of NetSuite are the ability to create custom reports and track profitability and commissions. As for negative aspects, they include interactions with the interface that don’t seem to be logical but note that most customers emphasize the usability of the platform, so this drawback is very individual.\n\nSahil Vijay from Vijay Holdings LLC describes the robust performance of NetSuite and highlights its cloud nature, user-friendly interface, and top-notch security as positive aspects. As for negative moments, the platform is costly and takes a long time to implement. Besides you have to do that through a third party reseller.\n\nNow, let’s figure out the pros and cons of using Oracle NetSuite.\n\nPros\n\nEase-of-use. NetSuite is exceptionally intuitive, so you can start using it without any technical skills. Of course, it takes a little time and practice to learn the system (especially its reporting part), but for most tasks, it is as easy as using the search box at the top.\n\nCloud nature. Many users highlight the cloud nature of the platform. It makes the whole system available anytime, anywhere. Besides, it is relatively easy in comparison to other similar systems.\n\nHigh scalability. Oracle NetSuite is built to scale with the company growth. You can start as a small entrepreneur and rise to entirely new business dimensions using the system on every stage of your development.\n\nReporting and audit. The advanced reporting system may be hard to configure, but when it is tailored according to your needs, all the necessary insights are displayed in the most user-friendly manner. At the same time, you can run the most in-depth audit of what’s going on within the company, since NetSuite allows tracking changes by user, change type, date/time, etc.\n\nAdvanced customization. NetSuite is highly customizable, providing almost endless possibilities. At the same time, the standard functionality is suitable for many businesses. But if you want to change the way the platform works by default, it is not a problem.\n\nAutomation. NetSuite allows businesses to automate multiple aspects of a daily routine, for instance, intercompany elimination processes at month’s end. Thus, you can eliminate tons of manual work!\n\nIntegrations. NetSuite is good at integrating with other products and external systems. And you can easily connect it to Magento 2 with Improved Import & Export. Note that some integrations are available by default!\n\nCons\n\nCommissions. While NetSuite is oriented at businesses of all sizes, it may be too expensive for small and middle companies. Furthermore, there is still lots of manual adjustments you need to do before paying.\n\nReporting. NetSuite reports are potent, but you often have to spend lots of time configuring them. Sometimes designing a new report is less intuitive than you might have expected. The data for it may come from two different sources, making it difficult to combine everything. Thus, you need to run separate reports and then mix them in a third-party system.\n\nCustomizations. The excellent customization capabilities of NetSuite are at the same time its big drawback because it is often difficult to track and maintain custom workflows and scripts, especially when you implement changes. The more you customize the system, the more you need to keep documentation for reference. But this situation is typical for every custom project, so it is not NetSuite’s fault for 100%.\n\nConfiguration. As mentioned above, you have to spend lots of time and effort configuring the system. The process is not as complicated as in the case of many similar solutions, but it is not reduced to a few clicks. Robust enterprise software requires enough attention before it can do all the work for you.\n\nWe’ve also dug through multiple other reviews, but every user says about peculiar disadvantages of Oracle NetSuite. Depending on a particular business case, you may or may not face specific problems, so for someone working with NetSuite is seamless. In contrast, others face a different number of inconveniences.\n\nOracle NetSuite Admin Exploration\n\nThe first thought you get after logging in is ‘what the hell is going on here?’ The dashboard of NetSuite is way more complicated than the one you got used to in your Magento admin.\n\nThe homepage contains lots of blocks and windows with various data related to either your company or the system itself. You need some time to figure out the logic of blocks, but then the interface becomes more familiar, you feel more comfortable.\n\nWhen you scroll down, there is a block with settings that allow personalizing your dashboard, setting preferences, and configuring other parameters. Some shortcuts are available nearby as well.\n\nAlso, note that the top menu acts as a sticky element allowing you to switch between different sections of Oracle NetSuite in a fast and intuitive manner.\n\nNow, let’s look at each part of the menu individually. Although there are many sub-sections there, we’d like to draw your attention to the main pages only. More detailed exploration of each section will be available via standalone posts lately. You will find the corresponding links in this article below.\n\nThe Activities section contains various events and tasks. You can create new ones as well as view them on a calendar. The part seems pretty straightforward, but we will dive deep into its structure in another article.\n\nIn Transactions, you will find a HUGE list of links divided into the following sections: Bank, Sales, Employees, Quota/Forecast, Purchases, Billing, Inventory, Financials, Payables, Customers, Manufacturing, and Management. In addition to Transaction Links, you can also streamline Transaction Search and Recent Records.\n\nUnder Lists, you will find the following List Links categories: Accounting, Relationships, Mailing, Supply Chain, Marketing, Search, Employees, Web Site, and Mass Update. Search and Recent Records are available here as well.\n\nA wide variety of reports is impressive. NetSuite offers hundreds of them divided into 21 sections. Besides, you can leverage recent reports without looking through the whole list of available items.\n\nAnd this is how your file cabinet in the Documents section looks:\n\nWe will describe it in more detail in a separate article.\n\nThe Setup section provides the ability to configure your NetSuite account according to your preferences:\n\nIf you want to implement more complex changes, the Customization section is under your disposal:\n\nIf any issues occur, leverage the Support section:\n\nAs you can see, Oracle NetSuite is a quite complex system, but the more time you spend exploring its divisions, the better understanding of what’s going on there you get.

With our module, you can completely revamp the default import and export functionality of the platform, avoiding inconveniences. The most important fact related to the use of our plugin in the integration is that all information can be transferred between Oracle NetSuite ERP and Magento 2 automatically and different external attributes and their values – matched to ones used internally. Besides, our plugin allows using multiple formats for other integrations, and all entities – for migrations! As a result, you effortlessly connect Magento 2 not only with Oracle NetSuite ERP but any external systems.\n\nAutomated Import & Export\n\nTo synchronize Magento 2 with Oracle NetSuite ERP, you need to implement regular data transfers. As for the Improved Import & Export extension, it provides you with the ability to avoid your daily duties related to them. The module allows automating data flow to and from your store in two different ways: via schedules and event-based triggers.\n\nSchedules\n\nSchedules are the most intuitive and straightforward way of automation. Data transfers between Magento 2 and Oracle NetSuite ERP or other systems run in the background according to the specified plan. Being based on cron, they let you create fully independent import and export jobs that connect your e-commerce store to Oracle NetSuite ERP. The Improved Import & Export Magento 2 module offers several options, such as custom intervals, customizable predefined update schemes, profiles with no schedules, and asynchronous data transfers (launch every scheduled profile manually whenever you want). The following gif image shows how to configure a plan:\n\nEvents\n\nEvent-based triggers are the second huge improvement provided by the Improved Import & Export module when it comes to data transfers automation. Use the following algorithm to establish data transfers between Magento 2 and Oracle NetSuite ERP:\n\nCreate a trigger;\n\nConnect it to an event;\n\nLink an action to a trigger to launch it automatically.\n\nThus, transferring data to Oracle NetSuite ERP and importing the corresponding output back can be based on specific events – not only on the selected time intervals. Follow the link below for further information: How to Run Magento 2 Import or Export After Specific System Event or Process.\n\nAdvanced Mapping Features\n\nIf data from Oracle NetSuite ERP contains third-party attributes, you can easily map them to ones used in Magento 2 to automate data transfers. If you don’t do that, you won’t import any data to Magento 2 since the platform does not support external attributes and vice versa. What about the default tools?\n\nIf you use them, this procedure takes lots of time and effort since it is necessary to apply changes in a file editor repeating the same actions every time a new update is required. As for the Improved Import & Export Magento 2 extension, it radically simplifies the synchronization of Oracle NetSuite ERP and Magento 2 with the help of the following features:\n\nMapping Presets\n\nUse our module to solve the problem of different attribute standards without headaches and enable the Magento 2 Oracle NetSuite ERP synchronization in the most intuitive way with mapping presets – predefined mapping schemes that eliminate manual attributes matching.\n\nOur extension can do all the necessary changes automatically. It analyzes the input data file transferred from Oracle NetSuite ERP, discovers third-party attributes, and matches them to the ones used in Magento. You only need to select a matching scheme suitable for your migration. The process is shown below:\n\nMatching Interface\n\nImporting data from Oracle NetSuite ERP to Magento 2 can also be enabled by mapping external attributes to the corresponding internal ones. And you do everything right in the Magento admin! The Improved Import & Export module offers a unique matching interface which provides full control over matching: you map external attributes to the corresponding internal ones in a particular grid enabling the data transfer. This feature lets you forever forget about doing the same things in a data file. Here is how everything works:\n\nAs for the “Default Value” column, it plays a vital role in attributes matching when you transfer any data from Oracle NetSuite ERP. The column is designed for values, which are provided to all items of a corresponding attribute. For instance, to transfer product data from your Oracle NetSuite ERP, you can replace multiple old categories with a specified one. Type a hardcoded value containing a new store view in the “_store” attribute, and the Improved Import & Export extension will replace the third-party catalog elements with the chosen one.\n\nAlso, note that similar opportunities are possible when you export data. If Oracle requires some specific attributes, you can map native Magento 2 designations to them creating entirely suitable output.\n\nAttribute Values Mapping\n\nBesides, the Improved Import & Export Magento 2 extension offers a separate interface for attribute values mapping that provides the ability to simplify the Magento 2 Oracle NetSuite ERP synchronization. With our module, external designations will no longer interrupt transfers. Сhoose an external value from Oracle NetSuite ERP and specify the internal one from Magento 2 as a replacement. Repeat the procedure until all third-party designations are mapped to ones utilized in the new one. Note that the created schemes will be saved and applied for further updates. You will find more details in this article: Attribute Values Mapping.\n\nAttribute Values Editing\n\nIf attribute values mapping is not enough, streamline attribute values editing while transferring data from Oracle NetSuite ERP or other systems to your Magento 2 store and back. It is another feature of the Improved Import & Export module that makes the synchronization more merchant-friendly. To modify attribute values in bulk, use the following rules:\n\nAdd a prefix to multiple attribute values;\n\nAdd a suffix to numerous attribute values;\n\nSplit various attribute values;\n\nMerge multiple attribute values.\n\nNote that you can combine them and create conditions increasing the efficiency of the applied changes. Don’t miss the flexibility of our module synchronizing your Magento 2 store with Oracle NetSuite ERP! For further information, follow this link: How to Modify Attribute Values During Import and Export in Magento 2.\n\nCategory Mapping\n\nCategory mapping is a feature developed for product data transfers to Magento 2. Oriented at product import processes, it lets merchants match external categories to ones used internally. As a result, much fewer difficulties occur while products are transferred from any external systems. The Improved Import & Export module allows mapping external product categories to ones used in your catalog in the following way:\n\nTo create new categories in the import job, you only have to choose a parent category and specify a new one. Thus, the extension will link products to it during the import process. You can find more information about this feature here: Category Mapping.\n\nAttributes On The Fly\n\nAnd if an external data file lacks attributes, the Improved Import & Export Magento 2 extension provides the ability to create them on the fly via the following general form:\n\nAttribute|attribute_property_name:attribute_property_value|…\n\nYou can find more information about this feature here: Product attributes import.\n\nExtended Connectivity Options\n\nAs for the extended connectivity options of our module, they are designed to improve all data transfers and simplify the Magento 2 Oracle NetSuite ERP integration. With Improved Import & Export, you can leverage new file formats and two alternative ways of transferring data between your e-commerce store and external systems. Besides, it can move all Magento 2 entities if you want to migrate, while the default Magento tools support only several options.\n\nMultiple File Standards\n\nOur tool supports data transfer based on CSV, XML, JSON, ODS, and Excel files. Another feature that radically simplifies data transfers between Magento 2 and other platforms is support for archives. Our module knows how to unpack them automatically while the default tools work with uncompressed CSV only! As a result, you can eliminate multiple procedures, including the necessity to unpack archives and convert data files into CSV.\n\nMultiple File Sources\n\nThe following file sources can be leveraged to import and export data files between Magento 2 and external systems:\n\nFTP/SFTP. Transfer data files using a local or remote server.\n\nDropbox. Use a Dropbox account to establish a connection between the two systems. Alternatively, you can rely on Box, OneDrive, Google Drive, iCloud, and Amazon Drive.\n\nURL. A direct URL can be used to import a data file as well.\n\nAlternative Ways of Import & Export\n\nAs for the alternative ways of import and export, they are not represented in Magento 2 by default. Direct API connections and intermediary services enable multiple new integrations. To connect Magento 2 to Oracle NetSuite ERP, the Improved Import & Export extension provides the ability to leverage APIs. Our module supports REST, SOAP, and GraphQL. All API connections are fully compatible with the extension’s features so that you can streamline mapping, schedules, and attributes on the fly.\n\nAs for the intermediary services, our module works with Google Sheets, Office 365 Excel, and Zoho Sheet. Although they cannot be utilized in the synchronization of Oracle NetSuite ERP and Magento 2, feel free to leverage them for integrations with other systems. The following image shows how to use Google Sheets to move data to Magento 2:\n\nThe video below displays our extension in action:\n\nFinal Words\n\nAs you can see, Oracle NetSuite is a complex system with lots of powerful features and interfaces. It is designed to combine all parts of your business within a single platform automating multiple processes and increasing the efficiency of your enterprise. Due to the Improved Import & Export extension, you can seamlessly integrate Magento 2 with Oracle NetSuite ERP or other company’s products.
