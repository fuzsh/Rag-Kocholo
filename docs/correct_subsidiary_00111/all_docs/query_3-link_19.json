But let's start from the beginning.\n\nThe F.A.Z. study \"Germany's Best SMEs with Innovation Competence 2024\" analyzes social listening data from around 3,100 companies from various industries.\n\nWe are particularly pleased to receive three awards in the \"IT consultants\" category.\n\nWe have the honor - for the third time in a row - of receiving the LEADING EMPLOYER 2024 award. This puts PROMATIS among the top 1% of employers in Germany.\n\nWould you like to apply for a job at PROMATIS? In this blog post, we give you an insight into our application process.\n\nPROMATIS has stood for the successful realization of complex projects for over 30 years. That sounds great, but also a little abstract, and raises the question: what is the recipe for success?"
