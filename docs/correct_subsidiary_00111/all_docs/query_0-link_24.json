        "text": "The enterprise applications marketplace, comprised of Business Intelligence, Content Management and Supply Chain along with other enterprise applications like CRM and HR, continues to show growth through acquisition activity. We have seen the long-term strategy of key players such as SAP, Oracle, and Infor Global to add valuable niche players to their growing suites of products as a way to protect existing customer bases and add new ones. Examples of this strategy in Q2 were SAPs acquisition of Outlooksoft, Oracles deal for Agile, and the Infor-Workbrain transaction.\n\nTo that end, this quarter SAP AG acquired corporate performance management software company OutlookSoft Corporation. Over the past 12 months, SAP has made a number of moves designed to put together a complete suite of software for CFOs. A year ago, SAP bought compliance software vendor Virsa Systems and established a governance, risk and compliance management unit. Then, in February, SAP acquired analytics software company Pilot Software. The idea is to combine all of these products into an integrated suite for CFOs.\n\nOracle Corp. added yet one more acquisition to its bulging shopping basket with a $495 million cash deal to buy Agile Software Corp. This is an example of another foreign body from Oracle invading SAP's customer base. Although it targets a relatively small market, Agile could help Oracle sell more software to hundreds of SAP customers. Many of the 1,250 customers who use Agile's product life management software are high-tech companies that also run some of SAP's applications.\n\nInfor Global Solutions purchased Canadian online workforce management software vendor Workbrain Corp. Human capital management (HCM) is an increasingly popular set of ERP applications which help companies automate their human resources processes, from the initial hiring of a new employee through tracking that individual's performance while working for the organization. Infor plans to use Workbrain's software to expand its existing HCM software, particularly in the areas of time and attendance, scheduling, absence management and workforce planning.\n\nBusiness Objects was active in the business intelligence space with two second quarter deals. The consolidation of the business intelligence and business performance management software markets continued after Business Objects acquired former rival and BPM specialist Cartesis. Business Objects said that deal would extend its ability to offer a full reporting platform providing integrated BI and BPM functionality. Business Objects also acquired Inxight Software, a leading provider of software solutions for unstructured information discovery, including text analytics, federated search, and data visualization. The combination of Business Objects and Inxight Software will provide organizations with a comprehensive BI solution to address all of their data assets.\n\nFinally, two significant acquisitions in the content management and supply chain space demonstrated the continued activity in those markets.\n\nData storage software maker, Mobius Management Systems Inc., was acquired by enterprise software company, Allen Systems Group Inc., for $197.2 million cash. Mobius is a provider of integrated solutions for enterprise archiving and records management and will continue as a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASG. This acquisition, combined with its acquisition of Cypress Corporation in 2005, will allow ASG to offer a complete solution for Total Content Management.\n\ni2 Technologies, Inc. acquired Blue Agave Software, Inc., a provider of software application solutions designed to help consumer goods suppliers understand, predict and respond to daily consumer demand for every item at the store level. With the acquisition of Blue Agave, i2 can help consumer goods suppliers to take full advantage of consumer demand signals  including point-of-sale and RFID data  to quickly take action when issues and opportunities arise, before sales are lost and consumers complain. The Blue Agave solution is a natural extension of i2s offerings, providing end-to-end planning and execution capabilities to manufacturers and their retail partners."
