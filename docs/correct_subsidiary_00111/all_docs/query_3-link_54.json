        "text": "S&P Global is a company who provides essential intelligence to make critical financial decisions with conviction. S&P Global has been around for almost 150 years. Our customers include the largest banks, the largest airlines, anyone who is dealing in the commodity space, anybody who is providing financial advice to institutional investors, to commercial investors, to a wide range of customers.\n\nOur reporting needs became different as our company and our business model evolved. Reporting across our different lines of business became more disaggregated, became more fragmented, and was just more and more untenable. As we bought companies, as we sold companies, as we combined into our new iteration of our new operating model, consistent, clear, concise reporting became increasingly challenging. So as we went through and started looking into the future, we really needed a new solution to streamline our financial accounting reporting.\n\nThe team at Oracle and how they associated our success and their success as almost one and the same is what really drove Oracle being the best solution for us. The people and the Oracle team just worked with us dynamically, progressively to really build a great solution that we as a company could use going forward.\n\nKPMG has a longstanding relationship with S&P Global. Moving into the Oracle platform, when we looked at who I felt we could work with effectively after going through an iterative process, we really found that culturally KPMG's values aligned to our values. They were honest, transparent, decisive, open, and collaborative. I think KPMG's partners and their team are approachable, probably the most important thing. together we can find the solutions. I think that the collaborative and solution-oriented team who's open to new ideas is what keeps me with KPMG.\n\nKPMG's solutions oriented. KPMG comes in and helps me identify the facts, the considerations, the full complement of challenges that we have, and really iterate to a solution. I think that partnership with KPMG to iterate on solutions rather than come and pronounce the solution is one of the defining characteristics of why I really enjoy working with KPMG, is you get there together. They're really looking at my needs, understanding our challenges, and really crafting the storyline together.\n\nI think every relationship requires investment. And when I look at the team at KPMG, they are here to ensure both our mutual success. And I feel that when I'm working with KPMG. I think that having that humility to work together, to not feel like they always have to be right, is terrific. It creates a more collaborative and open environment where you can really brainstorm with new ideas. that humility balanced with a true desire for the truth just brings the relationship to the next level.\n\nPart of the journey is just having the right partners that are willing to go invent the future together with you. Just to stay in front of disruption, we're going to have to keep changing. So when I look at the future and where we want our industry to go and where we want to go through and make our mark, they're just going to be a great partner to go through and solve our challenges that we haven't even thought of yet."
