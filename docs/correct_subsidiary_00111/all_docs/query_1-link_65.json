        "text": "Publicis Groupe has reinvented itself for the Connected Age by moving from Holding Company to a platform.\n\nHighly modular, Publicis Groupe’s Connecting Company model is a unique platform that gives clients plug & play access to our best-in-class services. Supported by a Global Client Leader (GCL), our clients benefit from a borderless, seamless service that drives the alchemy of creativity and technology.\n\nPublicis Groupe is organized into 4 Solutions Hubs for easier connectivity and integration: Publicis Communications, Publicis Media, Publicis Sapient, and Publicis Health. In this model, all agency brands still exist and share an operational backbone, which gives them the power and expertise of all the Solution Hubs combined to deliver the scale required to compete and win in a data-led, digital-first world. Epsilon, the data-driven marketing and tech company and its platform Conversant, that joined the Groupe in July 2019, is positioned at the center, fueling all the Groupe’s operations with their unparalleled data expertise.\n\nAs a Connecting Company, we are able to deliver as the Power of One - driven by a common purpose, a powerful spirit, shared behaviors, great character and a relentless focus on our clients.\n\nOur business model allows us to fundamentally rethink our approach:\n\nClients come first.\n\nThe entire Publicis Groupe transformation was designed to put clients at the center of all we do. Their needs and objectives drive the solutions we provide in order to help them win and grow.\n\nWe are seamless.\n\nWe have created the powerful role of the Global Client Leader. One person who acts as one point of access and one point of accountability to tap an 103,000 deep pool of talent - free from silos, legacy, and convention.\n\nWe are frictionless.\n\nWe have unified P&Ls and removed all operational barriers.\n\nWe are modular.\n\nThe core benefit of our new organization is not only in the depth and range of capability but, more importantly, in our ability to configure situationally; the ability to configure around individual client needs and an open architecture to plug & play world class partners when needed. Modularity is critical as it enables a future proof way for this organization support innovation now and keep pace the changes that show no sign of stopping.\n\nWe are united.\n\nBy fusing together our creative, intelligence, and technology expertise, we are able to provide clients with transformative ideas and consumer experiences, unlike any other agency or holding company in the marketplace.\n\nFuture-focused since 1926\n\nPublicis Groupe has never taken its eyes off the future. In 1926, Marcel Bleustein-Blanchet created what was essentially a startup, and named it Publicis after the French word for advertising and “6” - his favorite number. Marcel’s passion for communication, for creating relationships between advertisers and consumers, transformed this new field into a thriving, respected profession - and his values: attention to others, respect, staying true to the product, customer satisfaction, quality and creativity continue to drive Publicis Groupe today.\n\nThe pioneering spirit, unwavering convictions and ethical values of its founder – his legendary fighting spirit and rare, unique personality – have forged an exceptional Groupe. Publicis Groupe is built on a succession of innovations and transformations that have solidified the culture and expertise that continue to run deep throughout our Groupe."
