        "text": "Since Oracle cut many jobs back in 2022, the rumor about Oracle sunsetting its Oracle Commerce Cloud (OCC) solution appeared. Later confirmed by Andy Hoar, the leading authority on B2B ecommerce business and strategy, this news has sharply hit the community of OCC users around the world. And for a reason: hundreds of small and big companies, including such market leaders as Family Dollar Stores Inc and Dell, will have to replatform soon.\n\nOf course, Oracle will not stop the solution in one day and will support it for a while. However, there will never be any upgrades, innovations or enhancements, and that feels disturbing. To have a nice plan on what to do next and how to live after Oracle Commerce Cloud shuts down, let’s look at oracle ATG alternatives and Oracle Commerce Cloud alternatives, from Commercetools to Virtocommerce, and discuss which option is the best. Virto experts will provide the best insight on how to choose the new platform.\n\nAt the beginning of the century, the small Art Technology Group (ATG) company created a unique ecommerce platform. In 2011, Oracle bought the company and the solution, rebranding it as Oracle ATG Commerce.\n\nLater, in 2014, that on-premises platform was upgraded and moved into the cloud (not initially built for it but reconstructed to work well). Oracle put a lot of effort into it and enhanced it with other Oracle technologies while slowing down the ATG version.\n\nWhile Oracle Commerce Cloud quickly became popular, according to Oracle Commerce Cloud reviews, many companies blamed the platform for its limited capabilities to extend and grow, which restricted businesses from providing their clients with the tailored customer experience. Though the platform was featured in Gartner Magic Quadrant for 10+ years, Oracle started slowly sunsetting the solution, and since 2022, OCC has disappeared from the Gartner leader’s list.\n\nWhile Oracle started the slow sunset of ATG Oracle at the time of the Oracle Commerce Cloud sunrise, many people kept using it and used it still. We truly believe that the companies who use these two solutions (including 1700 those using cloud-based OCC) must be concerned about the upcoming lack of support and innovation capabilities. Nevertheless, let’s see how solutions differ from each other despite their relation to the cloud.\n\nOracle ATG Web Commerce is an on-premises solution that serves as a framework for creating ecommerce websites. Built of several platform layers, it provides enough personalization capabilities and ecommerce features like pricing and promotion, a service center, and more.\n\nOracle Commerce Cloud was created when the company realized the strive for cloud-based platforms among companies searching for easier scalability. While this cloud solution offers more modern capabilities like API-first and headless approach, the reality is that this is the same old Oracle ATG wrapped into the cloud with the same ancient Oracle Commerce Cloud architecture.\n\nThis is why many customers who were looking for a modern solution in 2014 and moved to Oracle Commerce Cloud due to their cloud capabilities are now looking for another modern platform to move to.\n\nSince Oracle hasn’t proved yet that the solution will be closed soon, it makes sense to forecast that the solution will live for some years longer. However, the truth is that the users have noticed a lack of support and less useful updates lately. If not sunsetting now, Oracle will obviously stop investing enough money into solutions.\n\nThe first and the biggest sign is that the solution that was taking one of the main places in Gartner Magic Quadrant is now out of competition. Three years ago, it disappeared from the rage, and the developer didn’t try to help it.\n\nAnother sign is that there are fewer investments in the OCC and more investments in the new solutions acquired, like Netsuite (the ERP system). Many employees from the OCC department were fired, and the quality of client support drastically fell. As a result, companies started refusing to use the solution, and many of them replatformed to other platforms.\n\nOne more reason is that the solution is obviously outdated, and Oracle realizes it. This is why the company puts a big effort into developing other solutions while not even trying to improve the existing ones. For a long time, it was not able to support any innovation. The multilayer architecture leads to slower and very expensive innovations.\n\nThough Oracle keeps silent about an official decision on the platform, these factors show that the solution becomes less and less popular as its previous users search for new replatforming solutions able to offer faster innovation, greater extensibility, and modern ecommerce capabilities.\n\nAs Apps Run the World Company claims, over 50% of OCC users are based in the USA, and almost half of all users work in retail industry, followed by 23.8% of manufacturers. Most of these companies show revenue between 100 million and 1 billion, which shows that this is an enterprise-targeted platform. Here, we provide some examples of TOP OCC users.\n\nDell: A US-based professional services organization with 133,000 employees and $101.60 billion in revenue.\n\nFamily Dollar Stores Inc: A US-based retail organization with 60,000 employees and $28.33 billion in revenue.\n\nDollar Tree, Inc.: A US-based retail organization with 210,565 employees and revenue of $26.32 billion.\n\nGroupe Adeo: French professional services organization with 33,900 employees and $25.76 billion in revenue.\n\nEmerson Electric Co.: A U.S. manufacturing organization with 85,500 employees and $19.63 billion in revenue.\n\nNot only enterprise-based but also a B2B-oriented platform: Oracle Commerce Cloud Sunset has shown that many B2B enterprises also have been choosing it:\n\nMotorola Solutions: A global leader in mission-critical communications that make cities safer and enable thriving communities and businesses. Motorola Solutions has replaced its legacy commerce platform with OCC to enable customer self-service for both B2B and B2C customers.\n\nConstruction Specialties: A global manufacturer of specialty construction products. The company has transitioned from legacy, customization-focused technology to OCC in an effort to make it easier for its customers to do business with Construction Specialties.\n\nDenby Pottery: a B2B and B2C company producing tableware and ceramics. Denby Pottery is one of the global companies that has invested in OCC to increase sales, customer loyalty and growth.\n\nAmong B2C companies that use the platform, we can find good examples such as Team Sportia, a successful sports retailer, and Vermont Country Store, which offers some useful retail goods.\n\nMany of these companies have already realized the need to replatform for a better future and are actively looking for new opportunities."
