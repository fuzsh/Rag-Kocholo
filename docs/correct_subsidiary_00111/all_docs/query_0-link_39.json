        "text": "I have always been a J R. R. Tolkien fan and after watching Amazon Primeâs The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power series I have been ruminating on the lessons from the books and how they apply to the current state of the Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) market.\n\nConsider Oracleâs recent move to eliminate the 9.3.7 release from their Agile PLM roadmap to go all in on a cloud-based solution that shares architecture with Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS). Or SAP and Siemens partnering up on PLM. Or the emergence of Microsoft offerings touting their tight PLM integration to their Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) platform Microsoft Dynamics.\n\nIt seems the PLM grandfathers are resurrecting the goal of trying to run their legacy business application on one platform.\n\nThe Endless Quest for a Single-Platform ERP/PLM\n\nThe objective of a single PLM and ERP platform has always been particularly appealing to IT types at product companies still using legacy systems. Itâs clear why those responsible for maintaining business systems would find this approach attractive â their users donât have to move anywhere, while the tech stack gets reduced.Â\n\nBut much like the One Ring in The Lord of the Rings, this quest can lead to unforeseen struggles. These can include the destruction of productivity, and the overarching control can require extreme compromises that can hinder the businessâs ability to maximize profit and minimize time to market in product development. For instance, a lack of familiarity with the user interface can inevitably lead to data silos as more users feel pushed out of the system or they try to move faster than the system by circumventing it altogether, which defeats the purpose entirely and creates more manual work.\n\nSome companies might also seek to save money by having one platform â and it is possible the cost savings could be significant, especially for Microsoft users. However, I would predict the loss in productivity from using limited PLM solutions would quickly cancel out these cost savings by severely hindering these companiesâ ability to effectively develop and release new products on time. Some of the hidden costs of these systems can include:\n\nExpensive system upgrades critical to not only efficiency but also security\n\nLimited configuration options to meet changing market needs\n\nLonger processing times and workflow gaps leading to launch delays\n\nOne of the main reasons Oracle acquired Agile PLM in the first place was because they failed to develop a successful PLM platform. Moreover, I feel certain SAPâs motivation in partnering with Siemens is due to their inability to successfully create a single ERP/PLM platform of their own.\n\nIn The Lord of the Rings, the evil Lord Sauron creates the One Ring to ultimately control all the others and to bring them under his sway. While I donât believe a single platform for PLM and ERP is evil, I do believe the tyranny of the platform could lead to some serious issues for those trying to use one platform for both purposes.Â\n\nWhere Others Have Failedâ¦\n\nWhat has changed since these previous attempts to create a single platform? The answer is the advent of cloud-based enterprise business applications.Â\n\nHistorically, Oracle was limited by the complexity of its architecture. Only very large companies with sophisticated and large IT organizations could support Oracleâs infrastructure requirements.\n\nWith Oracleâs new cloud-based infrastructure this limitation goes away. Unfortunately, users are still dealing with an application that is ill-suited for both ERP and PLM.Â\n\nWhile the architecture issue alone is daunting, Oracleâs past failures around PLM were bigger. The main problem is that the architecture was designed for ERP and they attempted to adapt and extend it to meet the needs of PLM users. The tasks performed by an ERP are largely black-and-white and transactional. Itâs not feasible to stretch this same architecture to perform with the complexity and volume of data that PLM systems manage, not to mention the rapidly changing and collaborative nature of PLM processes.\n\nThis is still true today as there are significant gaps between the functionality of Oracleâs cloud-based PLM and Agile PLM. It is telling that only a handful of customers have migrated to Oracle Cloud from Agile PLM despite Oracleâs aggressive attempts to incentivize their customers.\n\nWhile I am sure Oracle will eventually add enough functionality for companies to run their PLM functions on their new platform, I am also certain it will never be as successful as a dedicated PLM application and the potential advantages of Oracleâs one platform will never offset these shortcomings.\n\nCompanies running on these types of legacy platforms will always be at a disadvantage versus companies using a âbest in classâ approach.\n\nAll Roads Lead to Digital TransformationÂ\n\nTechnology has evolved to the point where integration of PLM and ERP has become very straightforward, and it is no longer the headache it once was for IT organizations.\n\nMost enterprise-level applications are migrating to the cloud and the underlying technology for these solutions makes it very easy to link Application Programming Interfaces (API) for robust data exchange.\n\nThis nullifies one of the main advantages unified architectures promise. The seamless exchange of data is no longer an issue.Â\n\nIn the modern landscape, itâs a foregone conclusion that cloud-based applications will continue to dominate the landscape of PLM and ERP and companies leveraging on-premise solutions will be forced to move in this direction.\n\nSome concerns around cloud-based solutions include security, performance, and the ability to customize to meet business needs. Iâd point out that Salesforce has been developing cloud-based solutions longer than any of the legacy business solution providers. Given their long history in the market, they have a massive head start on addressing these issues.Â\n\nThe Salesforce platform is recognized as the gold standard for cloud architecture, and they have enabled this architecture to allow other companies to develop solutions on it. This is the best of all possible worlds.Â\n\nCompanies can leverage technologies that are purpose-built for their business needs on the highest quality cloud platform available without having to compromise on functionality.Â Â\n\nThe Next Chapter for Legacy Users\n\nAt Zero Wait-State, weâve identified a promising solution, a Salesforce-based application that addresses business needs before release to manufacturing. Propel Software is a purpose-built PLM solution that leverages all the capabilities offered by a modern cloud architecture while still mapping very closely to the needs of traditional PLM solutions like Agile PLM.Â Â\n\nMoreover, the user experience is intuitive for Agile PLM users, making for a very smooth transition. The developers of this application have also taken full advantage of the cloud platform offering a modern interface and a collaborative open architecture that lends itself to wider adoption. The API framework for Salesforce is very robust and several third-party solutions make integration to ERP even more straightforward.Â\n\nMuch like the conclusion of The Lord of the Rings, I expect the push to consolidate ERP systems with PLM will be foiled once companies fully grasp the limitations of these legacy providersâ single-solution attempts.Â Â\n\nThe flexibility that comes with a dedicated system specifically designed to meet the needs of PLM users will outweigh ITâs desire not to ruffle feathers. Ultimately, companies need to leverage every advantage they can to remain competitive and maximize profits and quality.\n\nThe world is rapidly changing, and companies cannot afford to be limited by large systems that are unable to adjust to meet their needs. I look forward to the dialogue around this subject and hope we can help companies make the right choices for their product development solutions.\n\nExplore Propel Software."
