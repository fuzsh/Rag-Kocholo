Delving Deep into the Soulful Lyrics

Green light, seven eleven

You stop in for a pack of cigarettes

You don’t smoke, don’t even want to

Hey now, check your change

Dressed up like a car crash

Your wheels are turning but you’re upside down

You say when he hits you, you don’t mind

Because when he hurts you, you feel alive

Oh now, is that what it is?

Red light, grey morning

You stumble out of a hole in the ground

A vampire or a victim

It depends on who’s around

You used to stay in to watch the adverts

You could lip synch to the talk shows

And if you look, you look through me

And when you talk, it’s not to me

And when I touch you, you don’t feel a thing

If I could stay, then the night would give you up

Stay and the day would keep its trust

Stay and the night would be enough

Faraway, so close

Up with the static and the radio

With satellite television

You can go anywhere

Miami, New Orleans

London, Belfast and Berlin

And if you listen, I can’t call

And if you jump, you just might fall

And if you shout, I’ll only hear you

If I could stay, then the night would give you up

Stay and the day would keep its trust

Stay with the demons you drowned

Stay with the spirit I found

Stay and the night would be enough

Three o’clock in the morning

It’s quiet and there’s no one around

Just the bang and the clatter

As an angel runs to ground

Just the bang and the clatter

As an angel hits the ground

Diving Deep into the Musical Structure

As an experienced music blogger, I would be remiss not to discuss the musical intricacies of “Stay (Faraway So Close!)” and the fascinating ways it showcases U2’s talent. With a tempo of approximately 95 Beats per Minute (BPM), this song is written in the key of A Major and follows a rather unconventional structure that distinguishes it from other typical rock ballads.

The song kicks off with the instantly recognizable guitar riff, played by The Edge on a 12-string acoustic guitar. This riff is constructed around a repetitive and hypnotic arpeggio that sets the stage for the song’s melancholic yet hopeful atmosphere. The song’s chord progression – A, A/G#, A/F#, A/E – in the verses, and D, A, Bm, G in the pre-chorus, provides the perfect foundation for Bono’s soaring vocals.

One of the standout features of “Stay (Faraway So Close!)” is its dynamic changes, particularly in the chorus. The chord structure shifts from a minor progression in the verses to a major progression in the chorus, with the chords A, G, D, and E, giving the song a sense of uplifting resolution. This progression creates an emotional contrast that makes the chorus stand out and draws the listener into the song’s narrative.

The song’s rhythmic structure is also worth noting, as it deviates from the standard 4/4 time signature. The verses and chorus follow a 6/4 time signature, which gives the song a slightly off-kilter feel, while the pre-chorus switches to a more conventional 4/4 time signature. This subtle rhythmic shift adds to the song’s distinctiveness and showcases U2’s ability to experiment with time signatures while maintaining a cohesive sound.

The instrumentation throughout “Stay (Faraway So Close!)” is relatively sparse, placing emphasis on Bono’s emotive vocal performance. The Edge’s guitar work is characteristically atmospheric, while Adam Clayton’s bass and Larry Mullen Jr.’s drums provide a solid rhythmic backbone without becoming overpowering. This sparse arrangement allows the song’s powerful lyrics to take center stage, further cementing the song’s status as a classic U2 ballad.

In summary, “Stay (Faraway So Close!)” showcases U2’s signature sound and musical experimentation within a song that is both intricate and accessible. The combination of the unique chord progression, dynamic changes, and expert musicianship make this song a standout in U2’s extensive catalog, and a must-listen for any music aficionado looking to explore the band’s work further.
