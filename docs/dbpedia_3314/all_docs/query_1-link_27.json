        "text": "I never imagined I’d experience some of the best jazz I’ve ever shared a room with in a small auditorium in a little regional Virginia university. It was something of a coup for Mary Baldwin University to secure an appearance from the Cyrus Chestnut Trio, and a packed house was deeply appreciative as Chestnut (piano), Herman Burney, Jr. (bass) and Kelton Norris (drums) brought their unique flavor of classical-inspired jazz to campus.\n\nThe group exploded out of the gate with a frenetic drum solo that set the expectations for Norris’s superb style throughout. Loose, almost laconic, but with a rhythmic intensity that belied the discipline underpinning it. Indeed, the whole evening was refreshingly relaxed, these three players honed through their time touring together, but never ever sounding over-rehearsed or pre-planned. Chestnut made a point of explaining that the combination of notes played tonight had never happened before and never would again, and that he struggles to remember quite what happened during the previous tunes played. This is jazz that resists boredom, that sees repetition as anathema. The excitement was palpable.\n\nThe set peaked early, though never really came down from that peak. The second track was a stunning, slow riff on Lionel Richie’s “Hello” among other things, a resplendent deep bass line anchoring the track while Chestnut did his thing at the higher end of the piano. This moody, groovy, slow, playful piece was juxtaposed with the speed and intensity of the first, and throughout the set the trio intermixed slow with fast, loud with reflective. One of the most moving pieces was, frankly, a prayer, a quiet, sometimes indecisive, thoughtful piano solo, at the end of which one audience member intoned “Amen”. At other times, the energy exploded.\n\nThe third track was where Chestnut really let rip, with an extended piano break that built and built and grew and built, making it impossible to sit still. Burney and Norris took their cues beautifully; at times like this they held back, growing with and supporting Chestnut to fill the space, never drawing focus from him, and here the cumulative effect was ecstatic, profound, Chestnut working his way further and further right on the piano, his arms looking almost out of control as keys smashed together, and yet the noise still carefully calibrated. This thrilling sense of something that was on the edge of no longer making sense, and yet still did make sense, was edge-of-your-seat stuff, the kind of jazz that gets into your body and your soul.\n\nFrom there on, Chestnut and co had the audience exactly where they wanted them. Chestnut only occasionally broke to chat to the audience, at one point delightfully recalling a conversation he’d had with students about unpredictability earlier in the day before launching into a rendition of the Jeopardy theme. The wit and humour of the evening was part of the joy; while the level of skill on display was jaw-dropping, Chestnut was also able to laugh at the familiar melodies that inadvertently turned up while he was playing, as well as joke with the audience about his own stalling anecdotes while he tried to decide what to do next. Yet the humour also underpinned the profundity of the more solemn pieces, the gig finishing with a single encore of a chillout track that slowly brought down the temperature, relaxing a hyped-up crowd into the cool Fall evening.\n\nEach musician got their own turn in the limelight. Burney was the star of a brand-new song making its debut tonight, leading with a complex solo working right at the highest pitch of his instrument’s capacities before handing over to the piano; Norris, meanwhile, never showboated but used his solos to demonstrate the variety of his work across brushes, rimshots, and a round-robin of bass, toms, and cymbals. On the piano, meanwhile, Chestnut seemed to have no limits at all, moving seamlessly between blues and classical, slow jazz and even a hint of rock n’roll. This allusive, elusive musician filled the room, and didn’t even need a microphone.\n\nThe mid-90s saw U2 engaging a great deal with film, including in Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. recording the theme for Mission: Impossible, Bono and the Edge writing ‘Goldeneye’ for Tina Turner, and the band turning out one of its best singles, ‘Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me’ for Batman Forever. More subtle, but in keeping with the band’s love affair with post-Cold War Berlin, was the video for ‘Stay (Faraway, So Close!)’, written for Wim Wenders’ Faraway, So Close!, the sequel to/continuation of Wings of Desire. Directed by Wenders, the film acts as a continuation of those films’ aesthetic and conceit, with a distinctly musical twist.\n\nThe two Berlin films are deeply embedded in rock music already, with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appearing in Wings of Desire and Lou Reed (also a recorded guest on U2’s Zoo TV tour) turning up in Faraway, So Close! The video for the U2 track also picks up on the cue in Wings of Desire that the angels who descend to Earth might go on to be famous people (like Peter Falk!). In the video, U2 themselves are the angels, moving around a Berlin bus and taking an interest in people, before Edge picks up a music box (seen in Wings of Desire) and kickstarts the track. While the angels of Wenders’s world are not able to directly intervene, for the purposes of music, U2 become muses, inspirations, projecting their silence and yearning onto humans.\n\nThe central conceit of the video is of a band, led by a female singer, who are singing ‘Stay’. In colour, they pull out a show-stopping version of the song in a garage; in black and white, U2 surround them. Larry picks up some drumsticks and taps out the beat, helping the drummer keep time; Edge tweaks the tuning of the guitarist’s instrument; Adam watches beneficently. At the centre, Bono leans in to the lead singer’s microphone and mouths the words just before the woman sings them; Bono’s voice is heard as she sings. The projection is thus complete; Bono is present but also displaced from the words; the female singer takes his voice literally, but never has her own.\n\nThe angels are infused with negative capability: the state of constant yearning and expectation without realization. The song itself takes up a similar theme: ‘And if you look, you look through me / And when you talk, you talk at me / And when I touch you, you don’t feel a thing’. For one of U2’s most lovely songs, it’s also a brutal one, whose verses conjure an image of a survivor of domestic abuse (‘You say when he hits you, you don’t mind / Because when he hurts you, you feel alive’) and an inability to intervene. As such, the angels become a potent visual symbol of impotence; a desire to make difference without the ability to follow through. The Angel of Victory statue used in the film is reused here, Bono standing aloft it in the moments where we see him singing for himself, but separate from the humanity that he is screaming out to.\n\nAs such, Bono’s trajectory in the video mirrors that of the angels in Wenders’s films, as he finally descends himself for the final verse (‘just the bang and the clatter / As an angel runs to ground’). In colour, Wenders’s camera captures Bono suddenly appearing in the middle of a freeway with the bronze breastplate of an angel, tumbling over as if thrown from above; he then picks up the breastplate and begins running down the road. As opposed to the more existential musings that prompt Wenders’s film angels to Earth, here the choice seems to emerge from Bono’s desire to connect, to intervene – to protect the addressee of the song or the dying man he encounters held in the arms of a female angel.\n\nThe music video (and of course the song) is a beautiful accompaniment to Wenders’s vision. If Wings of Desire is about cinema’s (in)ability to create connection, then ‘Stay’ becomes the musical counterpart to that, in which music offers the desire to connect but a desire which is so often one-way, the efforts of a rock star to create mass intimacy equated with the angel who moves silently through a population that doesn’t notice. Faraway, yet so close; music creates the impression of intimacy without the actual human connection, especially when that music is carried on radio-waves. And so, as with Bruno Ganz’s angel before him, Bono’s angel crashes to Earth.\n\nIt’s testament to the importance of all four of U2’s members that, even though it’s Bono and Edge who are doing the publicity tours at the moment, and who are most prominent in all of the discussion of Songs of Surrender – Edge is the one who oversaw this project, Bono wrote his autobiography, the arrangements favor the voice-and-guitar/piano of the two of them – the best two discs on Songs of Surrender are the ones labelled ‘Larry’ and ‘Adam’. U2 has always been, first and foremost, a rock band, and in many ways the drummer and bassist are what prevent the (whisper it) narcissism of the front man taking over. While attributing to much agency to the division of the four discs would presumably be unwise, it’s a relief to turn to the disc called ‘Larry’ and find some more innovative rearrangements of classic and recent U2 tracks that show a greater range in the band’s new phase.\n\nPart of what sets Larry’s disc apart is that it’s made up largely of deeper cuts. The album kicks off with ‘Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses’, a song which has form in acoustic reworkings already, but here feels like a joyous singalong, Bono’s voice and Edge’s guitar working evenly together, and some lovely harmonies emerging during the chorus. Stripped of the production of the Achtung Baby version, here the song feels as pure as it ever has, and the indulgence of the ending as Bono starts repeating ‘Come on now love’ and ‘Ride on’ over and over feels organic. Similarly, ‘Stuck in a Moment You Can’t Get Out Of’ – another song for which acoustic versions have previously been released – feels fresh here, but this time from the addition of bass and drums in the latter half of the song (supporting by Larry’s kid Ezra on tambourine), building to Edge and Bono’s harmonising duet in the outro and a lingering ‘This too shall pass’ at the end of the song. These are the tracks in which U2 feel like they’re retaining the best of what made these classic singles classically U2, but with the warmth of the acoustic get-together.\n\nThis also transforms other songs which haven’t previously thrived in this form. ‘Get Out Of Your Own Way’ is so recent that one might argue it hardly needs a reworking, but here it has a skiffle vibe, Larry’s drums leading the song, and the band’s voices singing the chorus together, and an ‘ooh shalala’ vocal backing track underpinning some of the verses. It sounds like the band is having fun, and the song suddenly becomes a joyful bit of silliness. Even better is ‘The Miracle (of Joey Ramone)’, one of U2’s least successful singles, but here heavy on the acoustic bass and initially played in half-time, but then giving way to a rewritten chorus: ‘You’re so cynical / I need a miracle / To make some sense out of the world / Viva viva La Ramone / We will never be alone / The greatest voice I’ve ever heard’. The rewritten chorus is just a lot better than the original, and finally the song captures that sense of kids expressing love for an icon, but with the bass-y verses and drum beat giving some eerie depth.\n\nAlso pleasing here is the recuperation of some of the band’s stand-alone singles that get more forgotten. ‘Invisible’ has become a bit of a calling card for the band, and here it’s given a very full version, with chugging guitar and Edge on dulcimer lifting the whole thing. It’s one of the fullest-sounding songs on the album in terms of the depth of production, drawing on the choric vocals which characterise the record. Because it’s a more recent track, Bono’s voice sounds fitted to it, and the chorus of ‘There is no them / There’s only us’ feels as earnest as ever. ‘Ordinary Love’, meanwhile, is stripped down to its barest roots at first, just voice and Edge plucking his acoustic. Again, Bono’s falsetto doesn’t sound too out of place, and the song becomes a kind of gentle hymn, yet with an open-sky production quality that lets it reverberate beyond its immediate setting.\n\nNot everything lands, of course. How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is surprisingly heavily represented here, and ‘City of Blinding Lights’ remains as dull as it ever was, except now without even the air-punching lift of the massive chorus. Here, it’s led by piano and feels like a bit of a dirge, and even as the rest of the band joins in, it feels like a song that the band just keep wanting to make happen, and one that needs to be allowed to just rest. Much, much better is a solemn ‘Sometimes You Can’t Make It On Your Own’, a song built for this kind of stripped-back format. Here, unlike the rest of Larry’s disc, Bono is very high in the mix, with a sparse accompaniment at first as he sings to his dad. Here, Bono’s current voice – with all of its cracks and bum notes – feels authentic, an attempt to communicate with his dead father, and even when he pushes beyond the limits of his voice, it feels necessary. But the song doesn’t just stay there. The fact that the group vocals come in on the chorus suddenly feels like the band are lifting Bono at the point when he needs it most. And then at the bridge, suddenly everything else kicks in – bass, organ, and a military drum beat from Larry, all underpinning Bono going for broke with the falsetto. Everything builds until suddenly it cuts out for Bono’s ‘Don’t leave me here alone’ – the voice going high and disappearing into emptiness, before a long pause, and then suddenly everyone coming back together to finish the song. It’s high drama, beautifully staged, and serves the song fantastically.\n\nAnd as with all of Larry’s work, it’s the deepest cuts that work best. ‘Red Hill Mining Town’ was reworked for the Joshua Tree tour to bring in brass accompaniment, and here Trombone Shorty, Dan Oestreicher, Yirmayah Yisrael, and Rori Colman bring in brass and saxes with Larry’s snare to offer a rich underpinning to this underplayed but now fully resurrected song. And ‘Dirty Day’ – one of the deep cuts with some of the best remixes in U2’s catalogue – is so much fun. HAUSER is the guest here, with Bono singing opposite HAUSER’s reworking of the core riff, turning the song into a breathy, intimate, almost joke of a song – Bono even sounds like he’s laughing at one point. Rumbling snares, deep reverb and an aching high cello line all then transform the bridge, and then the outro has fun with loops and more echo. It’s effectively a live remix of the song, and recaptures some of the creativity of Zooropa, in ways that show what Songs of Surrender at its best can be.\n\n‘The name upon your lips is gonna be – Roxy’s!’ While the snow blanketed Minneapolis outside, Monica West played host to the brave few who ventured out through the cold (including a cohort from the Shakespeare Association of America) for a fabulous, inclusive, and gorgeously camp dinner performance. With one of the venue’s usual stars off doing a Schitt’s Creek cruise, this open-themed drag show was full of joy and creativity, some killer cover versions, and a lot of laughs.\n\nOne of the real treats was the inclusion of Genevieve Love (not the Shakespeare scholar), who normally does tech for the venue, but here stepped into the spotlight to fill in for an absent regular. Love’s dynamic, energetic performance showed off her athleticism as she worked the floor, did the splits, and cartwheeled between the tables (while wearing those heels). Love’s immaculate outfits and confident lip-synch set the tone for the night, the 1s flowing in her direction from around the room.\n\nThe older (though still only twenty-six, of course) queens then took the stage. Bebe Zahara Benet – winner of RuPaul’s Drag Race season one – was all presence, with a stately trio of sets framed by majestic visuals. The absolute stand-out here involved a shattering cover of Meredith Brooks’s ‘Bitch’ reimagined as a torch song. Bebe’s poise and control, working her costume and channelling every possible bit of triumphant defiance into her face, demonstrated just why she won that show way back when.\n\nFor my money, though, Monica West had the best tunes. One set transitioned gloriously from ‘Material Girl’ into a jaunty, folksy reworking of ‘Bad Romance’, set to the bass line of ‘Hit the Road, Jack’. But a Joan Jett-themed climax, finishing with the room bouncing to ‘I Love Rock n’ Roll’, was an inspired choice to end the night.\n\nIn between, the banter was warm, the emphasis of this club being on its welcoming atmosphere. In a climate where drag is under particular attack from the conservative right, Monica – while never, of course, earnest – repeatedly returned to ideas of collective work and the mission of art. Her main ribbing was for a guy who shied away from tucking bills into her bra, and anyone from out in the Minnesota sticks came in for some good-natured education in the joys of running water and electricity. But the most fun was the back and forth between the bar staff, techs and queens, where the shared joy of putting together the show came to the fore. And even where there were technical testicle difficulties, the show never stopped.\n\nPutting a show like this into words is well outside my field of expertise, and really this review is just a reminder to myself of the joy of the experience – from some extraordinarily substantial chicken wings, to the shared happiness and community in the room, to the amazing performances of the queens. But more than anything, for me, this introduction to drag was a potent reminder of just why this kind of performance is so threatening to cultural conservatives. As an unbridled expression of individual creativity, as a business which thrives on collectivism, and as an art so unashamed of the body, its emancipatory politics were profound. And they have the best tunes.\n\nSongs of Surrender is the third album of U2’s retrospective phase, beginning with Songs of Innocence – which self-consciously revisited the band’s youth as individuals and as musicians – and continuing with the more lush Songs of Experience which deliberately revisited Innocence with hindsight. Here, the band haven’t written any new songs, but instead double down on the self-reflexivity of the previous two records by re-recording forty of their songs, reimagined largely by Bono and The Edge with an eye to a more acoustic arrangement. This is partly prompted by Larry Mullen Jr.’s injuries – which are preventing him from joining the band’s Vegas residency later this year – and partly by the pandemic and the experience of lockdown. Across four discs, each named for a band member, the band have organized their back catalogue into laid-back reimaginings, with variable results. In my reviews of this album, I’m going to take each disc in turn, beginning with The Edge’s – surprisingly, given his masterminding of the project, one of the weakest.\n\n‘One’ is a very obvious opener for the album; already a number which has been interpreted acoustically a great deal, it’s an easy tone-setter for a stripped-back record. What’s perhaps surprising is that it does escalate as much as it does. Larry Mullen Jr.’s delicate drum fills, choric backing vocals by Abe Laboriel Jr., and a surprisingly heavy bass line, all mitigate the dominance of Bono’s voice, and allow the song to build and swell from the gentility of its opening. However, ‘Where the Streets Have No Name’ is not an obvious follow-up. This is a synth-heavy remake of one of the band’s most reliable rockers, and here it becomes an ambient number reminiscent of the band’s Passengers work with Brian Eno. ‘Streets’ is one of the songs where the lyric changes hit hardest against the familiar: ‘I wanted to feel sunlight on my face / but I need some shade and shelter / In this waterless place’. There’s a greater emphasis on the embodied experience of this nameless place. It’s a bold reworking of a song which is so usually euphoric, but here refuses to realise its potential, and instead repeatedly steps back from the brink, existing in the lyrics rather than the euphoria.\n\nThe album then shifts to cuts from the Boy era, which feels in keeping with the band’s retrospective angle during the Songs of . . . era. ‘Stories for Boys’, with Edge taking the lead vocals, finally becomes a song about the lyrics, accompanied largely solely by keyboard, and with a sad yearning that replaces the angst and yearning with something more melancholy. ’11 O’Clock Tick Tock’ is much meatier, and a welcome revisiting of one of the band’s most important non-album tracks. Even if Adam and Larry are present here, though, what stands out is Bono’s vocal track. Part of the premise of Songs of Surrender is that it’s about revisiting the songs with an eye to Bono’s vocal range and style in the 2020s, and this seems to equate to putting him as high in the mix as possible, which feels a shame as U2 have always been at their best when Bono isn’t dominating. The plaintive ‘Say so, say so’ bridge is affecting, and the slowed-down vibe allows the instrumental to linger in a thoughtful way. And ‘Out of Control’, a simple guitar and vocal mix, breaks the song down to its basic elements, and self-consciously juxtaposes instrumentation and vocals in ways that emphasise the naivete of the lyrics ‘I was of the opinion / It was out of control’. It’s a nice way of taking the proto-punk of their early songs and reimagining them as more mature songs.\n\n‘Beautiful Day’ has a major overhaul, including a bridge which now includes the lovely couplet ”I saw Adam asking Eve for a pardon; / It wasn’t a woman who threw God out of the garden’, turning the titular beautiful day into a paradise of gender justice. The song is interestingly dialled back from its purer outpourings, with a female backing chorus offering an ethereal counter to Bono’s voice, and a driving positive rhythm that never turns into a full-blooded rocker. This is one of the issues ans well as strengths of the album – it’s always, self-consciously, holding itself back. And that both feels meaningful and frustrating. In ‘Bad’, the lyrics shift early on to acknowledge the song as ‘This is a song of surrender’. ‘You could only have it all, if you give it all away’ Bono sings in another revised lyric. The song has depth, accompanied by occasional drum fills, but again it’s full of potential which is never expended, holding back something of its potential. Bono no longer screams ‘I’m wide awake’, but offers it. But a U2 that is holding back isn’t really U2 anymore.\n\nHappily, there are some real highlights here. ‘Every Breaking Wave’ is one of the standouts of the Bono and Edge Disney documentary, and while this is already a song which is (a) very recent and (b) available in acoustic as well as album versions, here it really does feel like it’s achieved its ultimate version. Here, the intimacy of Bono’s vocal feels justified against an insistent piano, and the gentle reverb on Bono’s voice extends and consolidates one of his best vocal performances in years, which allows for vulnerability and cracks, but also soars and lifts, and eventually hangs in the air like the Cheshire Cat’s smile after the rest of the song has ended. And ‘Walk On (Ukraine)’ commits fully to a rewrite to fit a new context. U2 have walked the walk by visiting Kiev and meeting Zelensky, and the rewritten first verse – imagining a comic taking a stage, for a ‘Stand Up – for freedom’ – is one of the band’s better lyrical conceits. ‘Walk On’ has always been a mawkish, sentimental outburst of sincerity, but here it struggles vocally, with a chorus coming in unpleasantly on sounds like the ‘raph’ of ‘photograph’. But it’s also an absolute banger of a tune that, in this version, hits the acoustic guitar very hard and create a dense wall of sound that captures something of the band’s performance in the underground shelters of Ukraine during wartime. Does the world need U2’s solidarity? No, but it’s sincere and heartfelt, and it feels like an important gesture.\n\nThe album closes with ‘Pride (In the Name of Love)’ which, a bit like the later Star Wars films, feels like it exists solely to correct previous mistakes, by correcting the time when Martin Luther King, Jr. was murdered. ‘Pride’ is another song usually defined by its expenditure of energy, which here feels a little more restrained, even if the instrumentation around the midpoint starts finding bassier sounds and deep piano chords. The thing that is moving, though, is that there’s a snippet of the younger Bono’s voice hollering out the refrain in the far distance, as a counter to the synthesized choric vocals that announce the main chorus. And Edge’s electric guitar gestures towards becoming a bridge between past and future, the acoustic gospel and the classic rock,\n\nEdge’s disc is probably the project’s weakest, both because it leans too heavily into the songs that already exist in acoustic versions, and also because it takes on too many of the band’s most famous rockers. Songs of Surrender thrives in the rediscovery of the band’s obscurer hits, and in bolder choices with the well-known songs. But by offering such counter-intuitive renditions of these famous tracks, it sets out the album’s stall with no small amount of panache.\n\nReaction to the announcement of U2’s fifteenth album has been mixed, to say the least. Songs of Surrender features forty songs from U2’s back catalogue, reimagined for the band as they are today. The largely acoustic-ish angle of the record is suspected by some to be a consequence of Larry Mullen, Jr., awaiting surgery, but The Edge’s introduction to the project particularly emphasises the changes over the years to Bono’s voice, and the value of letting go of the original versions of the songs in order to consider what they mean today, both musically and in terms of their content, with the distance of – in some cases – forty years.\n\nTeasing ‘Pride (In the Name of Love)’ as an example of what the record is going to be was probably always going to be a divisive decision. It’s one of the band’s most famous songs, and those attached to the original are likely to latch onto it as something that shouldn’t be touched much more than a less popular cut. But it’s also not a universally loved song, its bombast and sheer scale even perhaps a little cringey in retrospect. And by offering something so dramatically different in this version, it sets out something of the album’s potential to hold nothing sacred.\n\n‘Pride’ begins as a straightforward acoustic number, led by Edge’s guitar, and Bono singing in his lowest register. It’s intimate – Bono sounds like he’s swallowing the microphone – and meditative. Edge’s harmonies on the chorus open it out and upwards a little, but this is a restrained version in which the question ‘What more in the name of love?’ comes across more clearly as a question.\n\nIt’s also tinged with regret in this version. As well as the lyrical change which finally corrects the embarrassing error about when the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., took place (not ‘Early morning’), it also shifts away from the overtly religious lyrics to images of a boy: ‘One boy washed up on an empty shore / One boy who never will be kissed’ evokes the ongoing refugee crisis and the figures who represent the tragedies of a world too obsessed with its own needs to care about those of others. Here, with a few decades’ distance, ‘Pride’ now feels like a lament for a world that has none. ‘What more has to happen in the name of love?’ Bono now seems to be asking, ‘before we do something about it?’\n\nHaving set up this more reflective version, though, the song suddenly seems to start deconstructing itself. The final refrain is introduced by a choral style ‘In the name of love’, and ‘ooooh’ refrains. Very mild rhythm instruments join in, along with layers of Edge’s soaring, before Bono starts singing the response rather than the main melody, allowing himself to build a slow counter-point to the voice of his younger self, much lower in the mix, who still screams out the traditional refrain. It’s a powerful, reflective, collective singing across history, the band directly speaking back to itself. And as the song fades out, the collective ‘Oh oh oh oh’ that marks live performances can just barely be heard.\n\nThis is an exciting shift for the band. U2 have always reinvented their songs, allowing them to develop over the years in tour (which is partly what makes their live records so rich). On the basis of ‘Pride’, Songs of Surrender looks like it’s going to be a more direct than usual engagement with the change, thinking not about how to accommodate songs to changing vocal ranges and times, but how to transform them to mean something new. It’s got the potential to be an exciting and genuine reinvention, embracing who the band is now, rather than trying to live up to its past.\n\nWhile This is Where I Stand is Easyworld’s second album, it really feels like their first, a soft relaunch which re-records most of the earlier LP Better Ways to Self-Destruct. Its wry humour and bouncy pop vibes combined with an often shockingly dark edge are still a fantastic introduction to this short-lived band’s unique style, which was then perhaps better realised in lead singer David Ford’s later solo career.\n\nThe standout track is the title song. ‘The ache of a thousand nearly-nothings / Like unrequited love / Doesn’t mean a single fucking thing’ spits Ford, over a dense wall of distorted guitar. The song is an internal scream, a cry against oneself (‘God what have I done?’), while also offering wry truths (‘There’s no such thing as guarantee’). Then, when Glenn Hooper’s drums and Jo Taylor’s bass come crashing in, the whole thing suddenly takes on an epic force that powers it through to the conclusion. It’s a masterpiece, an outpouring of angst that becomes outrospective.\n\nThis is darker than most of the album. The big poppy singles are the highlight, with ‘Try Not To Think’ offering an early salvo of faux-handclaps and melodic guitar, coupled with Ford’s slyly smooth vocals. It’s a joyful song: ‘I don’t know why / But I just love / Everything about you’ offers an uplifting chorus, only slightly darkened by references to star-crossed lovers taking their life every Friday night. ‘A Stain to Never Fade’ is similarly upbeat in its essentials, while also taking about as unromantic an image for a love song as might be imagined. The band’s ease in shifting between disarmingly quiet (in this song, even sounding like Ford is doing personal demos in his bedroom) before suddenly opening up all the stops is compelling, even at this early stage in their development.\n\nShorter interludes add variety. Opener ‘Armistice’ is all ominous burbling, before an acoustic strum and then an electric snarl take over, calling the whole band in before asking questions of what is to come: ‘Was it really worth it?’ Later, ‘By the Sea’ is just over a minute of piano-laden pause imagining a peaceful moment of parking by the sea, the light calm before the storm announced by the opening scream of ‘Bleach’.\n\n‘Bleach’ is about as dark as the album gets, with its recurrent refrain of wanting to drink bleach. This is a pure pop-rock anthem, the bounciness of whose melody belies the darkness of its lyrics. It’s a song about choking on happiness that is wrapped up in the sounds of joy even as the singer wrestles with something dark, and it’s a perfect encapsulation of Ford’s wit mapped onto his demons. ‘Demons’ is another epic, oscillating between a slowed-down ballad mode and a full-throated roar as the band all comes together. The children’s mobile lullaby that repeatedly attempts to interrupt is always overwhelmed by the return of the band (with soaring backing vocals) saying ‘Give me all your demons / They don’t scare me now’. This song also features Taylor’s best work, the bass filling in the gaps in the quieter sections and giving everything a lift. And ‘Junkies & Whores’ starts by sounding like a folk demo before building into something truly epic.\n\nThe album enters with an excellent one-two punch. The deliberately pugnacious and staccato ‘You & Me’ feels like a Bluetones song with added oomph, right down to its ‘ba da ba’ vocal hooks and its evocation of town life. It’s by far the band’s most fun song, swaggering through chorus after chorus and finishing by applauding itself. But ‘You Were Right’ shows the band’s sophistication, returning once again to some country-esque guitar before setting up a steady rhythm reminiscent of later-stage Feeder. ‘All I know is wrong / But you were right all along’ sings Ford as the song reaches its climactic choruses, returning to the album’s recurrent thematic interest in self-deprecation and open-hearted emotional expressions. It’s a powerful closer to an important record from a band who I still miss.\n\nThe overwhelming impression of Sgt. Pepper– still, by some accounts, one of the most important albums ever made – is of joy. When Paul screams out on the title track ‘I don’t really wanna stop the show’, he really sounds like he means it. And even when the album borders on sadness, it always uses absurdism and archness to put things back into the squarely technicolour. The Pedlar isn’t an enormous Beatles fan, but Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band is infectious.\n\nMuch of the album’s ethos comes through most clearly on ‘With a Little Help From My Friends’, which captures a band in its heyday when it was still possible to believe that the band were a group of mates getting each other through. The album realises this formally in the perfect balance of harmonies, juxtapositions, and responses, including on this track – where the literal responses (‘Yes I’m certain that it happens all the time’) come with a different tonality and immediacy, a single voice responding to a collective issue. And even when the singers seem to be going off by themselves – as in John’s trippy verses on ‘Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds’ – the collective choruses ground things again in group harmony.\n\nEven minor tracks like ‘Getting Better’ and ‘Fixing a Hole’ have a broad theme of making things well again, and the surrealism of songs like ‘Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!’ show the band fully embracing weirdness. This narrative account of a show is not necessarily joyful in its weird carnival airs and minor keys and dangerous sideshows, but it’s perhaps the band’s fullest indulgence in bizarro storytelling, making for a fabulously bonkers centrepiece to the record. And the gloriously retro ‘When I’m Sixty Four’ goes back to music hall for something that feels so straightforward and funny, but also moving, that it’s disarming in itself.\n\nThe exception to all this, of course, is the melancholy ‘She’s Leaving Home’, which feels like The Beatles’ take on The Beach Boys, and has an immediacy in its accusations of guilt and betrayal. It’s hard to tell how ironic a song this is meant to be; the teenage runaway is seen entirely through the eyes of parents talking about their sacrifice, but there are revealing lines ‘What did we do that was wrong? We didn’t know that it was wrong’ and ‘Fun is the one thing that money can’t buy’, suggesting the potential that the parents do recognise something of their own culpability in their daughter’s decision to leave.\n\n‘Within You Without You’ is an outlier, drawing heavily on George Harrison’s interest in Indian musical cultures, and featuring the sitar prominently in a song notable for its atmospheres and extended instrumentals that couldn’t be any more sixties if they tried. The beauty of Sgt. Pepper is that it can exist on the same side of a record as ‘Good Morning Good Morning’ with its ridiculous banality, shouted refrain, and dissolution into animal noises, or ‘Lovely Rita’ with its panting outro. But this is where the band just sounds like they’re having fun, and even what sound like offcuts are beautifully produced and hilariously creative.\n\nAnd then, ‘A Day in the Life’. Wisely put after the reprise of the title track, ‘A Day in the Life’ is a mini-epic in itself. John’s wistful evocation of odd newspaper headlines – most poignantly, the Albert Hall-sized potholes in the road – is perfectly juxtaposed with Paul’s jaunty account of the process of getting up in a morning. But when he suddenly ‘slips into a dream’ on the bus, and John’s haunting ‘aaaaah’ comes over the top, the band in a couple of seconds pinpoints the turn that defines the whole record, from the surreal and dreamlike to the everyday and back again, and the definitive collective chord – played by many hands together – epitomises the collaboration. It’s the band’s best track, ending their best album, and a powerful conclusion to the record.\n\nFear of the Dawn never quite recovers from its extraordinary opening salvo. ‘Taking Me Back’ sets up a seven-note fuzzy riff, backed by a strident beat, that anchors this song in the instantly catchy, muscular rhythms that characterised the White Stripes’ best work. Over the course of four minutes. The riff becomes increasingly troubled, with distorted shrieks bisecting it diagonally, minor key overlays perverting it, and sudden diversions into more chaotic mid-sections. The repeated refrain of ‘It’s breaking my back’ is mirrored musically in the song, whose chaos keeps returning to the steady, repetitive anger of that main riff, the singer wanting to know if his ex will take him back. Dear God, please don’t.\n\nThere’s no let-up across Fear of the Dawn, a concept album themed around the breaking of day and the singer’s resistance to that new day. The title track erupts straight out of the opening song with no pause, as if an answer to the opener. It’s two minutes of pseudo-gothic fear of darkness and the sun falling in, with a rumbling propulsive bass-heavy thrash and dirty guitar solos screaming out against the night. And then the start of ‘The White Raven’ gives us 15 seconds of a slightly quieter instrumental, enough time for White to catch his breath, before we’re into the military fantasia of the lyrics: ‘My uniform is invisible / My camouflage is invisible / . . . My motives and invincible / My armor is invincible / The arms will go where the army goes’. If he was scared of the darkness earlier, now he embraces it. White’s voice, which always sounds strained though in perfect control of that strain, is a howl in troubled times, fear and anger in concert with one another.\n\n‘Hi-De-Ho’, though, really is something different. Sampling Cab Calloway, and with Q-Tip rapping about music history, it’s a longer-form bit of Southern gothic storytelling. The opening guitar riff sounds like an updating of Hendrix’s version of ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’, followed by what sounds like a pastiche of a call to prayer that introduces the singer as the ‘Hi-De-Ho Man’. Like Gorillaz’ ‘Clint Eastwood’, the use of rap for a spectral genie-type figure gives this song a distinctive feel, a genre mash-up that feels like nothing else on the album, and is all the better for it.\n\nThe genre slippages continue throughout the album. ‘Eosophobia’ – the scientific name for fear of the dawn, keeping the album’s thematic cohesion clear – even draws on a bit of UK ska (The Specials come to mind too) with a plodding bass and chilled out piano over a more manic drum beat. This is a purer expression of fear, ‘It’s coming up / It’s burning up’, Towards the end of the song, though, the images give way to their presumed meaning: ‘When my feelings disappear / Then I will learn to love you’. The recurrent fear of daylight seems to relate to fear of letting go of one’s own darkness, to be able to enjoy and celebrate life. ‘Into the Twilight’ emphasises this with its dominant lyric, ‘Here in the twilight / Everything’s right’. This is a vampiric party with guests including William Burroughs and The Manhattan Transfer, an upbeat dance anthem which is so resistant to hearing about the outside that it even goes ‘la la la la la’.\n\nThirty seconds of quite instrumental called ‘Dusk’ give a moment’s respite in the moment when the night begins, completing the sense of regression before returning full-throatedly to the night. ‘What’s the Trick’ is a grab-bag of riffs, a mix of bluegrass and metal that veers between Rage Against the Machine and motorcycle noises. There’s a general outpouring against unfairness here: ‘Stomping on a box / that I thought was empty / but there was something sharp inside’. ‘That Was Then (This is Now)’ then embraces the night with more confidence and with some early noughties rock harmonies reminiscent of Franz Ferdinand. Here, the ease with which one gets lost in the night – and the ease with one loses others – is the major concern, and the song itself keeps going down its own musical dead ends, starting and stopping, mixing more organic indie rock with something more staccato.\n\nA reprise of ‘Esophobia’ introduces the album’s final movement with widdly guitar solo before telling us ‘You think the sun / Listens to no-one / But you’re wrong / It listens to me’. This song, perhaps, more confidently prepares itself to face the day. And the last two songs go out with that confidence. ‘Morning, Noon and Night’ is just a classic rock song. It disclaims the need for fairytales, for martyrs, for ghosts, and simply wants ‘more time for me / And time for you’. It’s an answer to the first song which makes it about the singer rather than the object of their desire – rather than asking if ‘you’re taking me back’, now the singer is committing to the work he has to do. And with ‘Shedding My Velvet’, he begins that work, getting rid of the gothic trappings and revealing the ‘real me’. Slower, but not necessarily more subdued, the vocals are cleaner and more emo, the lyrics heightened even as they speak of de-escalating (horses, not zebras). But everything gets pared back for the album’s final words: ‘ “better to illuminate than merely to shine”: you say this all the time . . . and you’re right’. It’s time to face the light.\n\nArcade Fire have rarely ever been as joyful as they are on ‘The Lightning’, the two-part triumphant comeback single that evokes The Who, Tears for Fears and more. Starting with shaking strings, the album teases the band’s baggy unpredictability, before suddenly settling down into one of the most confident, steady, reassuring tracks they’ve done in years. The chorus of Part 1, with its refrain of ‘We can make it if you don’t quit on me / I won’t quit on you’, with singers responding back and forth to one another, feels like a family returning to one another, reaffirming their commitment. And just when they’ve done that, Part II kicks in at twice the speed, with quasi-Biblical lyrics, communing with nature, and evocations of the power of the natural world and especially lightning to collapse time (‘a day, a week, a month, a year’) and bring everything together. Like a lightning storm, at the heart of the album, it clears the air.\n\nThe opening diptych, ‘Age of Anxiety I and II’, sets up the state of a world that needs reassurance. There’s something immediately right about referring to this as the ‘age of anxiety’. ‘So we keep it all inside / And hide it deep in a drawer’ sings Win Butler, more gently than has often been his custom. The piano-led instrumentation softens the threats. And then, the track shifts to something with a pulsing eurobeat (even Arcade Fire can’t resist the synth-pop revolution). The glossier sheen of the opening track’s second half accompanies lyrics about hiding emotion, being unable to stop crying but it being lost in the rain, as a wall of sound builds up. The swirls of anxiety and uncertainty in both lyrics and music offer a powerful opener to the album.\n\nAnd then, Part II, ‘Rabbit Hole’, accelerates even harder from a very delicate start to a full on dance track. The lyrics here are more abstract and impressionistic, but also more isolated against the thinness of the backing. The image of the rabbit hole imagines something without clear end, something that goes on and on (reminiscent, perhaps, of their ‘Mountains Beyond Mountains’), but the song looks for hope when Régine Chassagne comes in with her refrain of ‘the world is made whole / One body, one soul’. Throughout, there’s something surprisingly optimistic going on for Arcade Fire, and it emerges from the band’s unique dialogue, husband and wife singing back and forth to one another in call and response.\n\nThis continues in the album’s back half with the two-part ‘Unconditional’. Part I, sung by Win, is a bouncy, folksy song, right down to its Lou Reed ‘Do do do do’ chorus. It feels like California. ‘Look out kid, trust your heart / You don’t have to play the part they wrote for you’. And then, it builds to the joyful affirmation: ‘I give you everything that’s mine / I give you my heart and my precious time’. It’s a song of unconditional love, and it’s sung by the husband; ‘Unconditional II’ is then sung by Régine, which is more opaque in its evocation of ‘I’ll be your race and religion’, but similarly heartfelt. It’s a stylistically very different song (and the only one on which Régine sings lead), leaning heavily into the 80s-style sounds, and more more electronic in comparison to the other tracks’ more organic feel. The two songs together are a beautiful instance of love in dialogue, and it’s so rare to hear pop/rock music which feels so truly and honestly about love rather than sex.\n\nBut it isn’t all roses. The album’s centrepiece is the multiple-part ‘End of the Empire’. Part one, ‘Last Dance’, sets up the song as elegy, imagining a last dance ‘here at the end of the empire’ – which turns out to be, explicitly, the American empire. It’s a return to the overt politicism that characterised Neon Bible, and the lush balladry, complete with strings, feels like a eulogy. And then, the second part, ‘Last Round’, brings in Régine and a heavier bass, to start pumping out a full torch song, complete with wandering trumpet line. This is Arcade Fire’s version of preparing for the apocalypse, playing it out with resignation and readiness for a last drink. And then, continuing the slow pace, the song returns to Win for the whimsical ‘Leave the Light On’, as the party gets maudlin: ‘Didn’t use to get high / With you by my side’. But then all the bets are off for Part IV, ‘Sagittarius A’, which gets Dantean in its anger and recrimination. I unsubscribe; she unsubscribes; we unsubscribe; fuck season 5 (of what?). It’s spacey, trippy, suggesting a final leaving of this particular life. This is Arcade Fire in their cosmic stage, a folksy version of Muse with paranoia and science-fiction pretensions, and even a bit of Andrews Sisters-style backing vocals. ‘End of the Empire’ is one of the band’s most ambitious, sprawling songs, and one to pore over for years to come.\n\nThe whole thing closes with ‘We’. Towards the end of ‘Unconditional II’, Régine starts singing ‘You and me could be we’, and the short title track follows on. This is an album about being together, about being stronger in the plural. Marriage comes up again here obliquely – ‘I wanna get down / Down on one knee’ – only perhaps now also evoking more political meanings of taking a knee. It’s another acoustic guitar-led track, and once again marks this as one of Arcade Fire’s quietest albums. Following a year of lockdown, it seems like the band have been through a lot, rediscovered love, and chosen peace. ‘Would you want to get off this ride with me? When everything ends, can we do it again?’ One senses that, even in the age of anxiety, as long as they’ve got each other, they’ll do it as long as they can."
