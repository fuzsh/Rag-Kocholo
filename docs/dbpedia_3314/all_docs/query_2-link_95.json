        "text": "Moving into different dorms and having their individual spaces seem ideal with their hectic schedules, and the primal need to have their own privacy. Weeks have passed and everything was slowly falling into place, or so Jaeyun thought.\n\nSharing a bedroom space with a group member can either be good or bad, depending on who the roommate is and how they are as a roommate. He couldn’t even recall the events that led to Jongseong being his designated room buddy, but he remembers whining about it and the latter smacking his butt in retaliation.\n\nThe years that they’ve spent together inside the four corners of the room, their hushed conversations late at night when Jaeyun couldn’t sleep, and their non-stop bickering over their dirty laundry—all of these are an amalgamation of why Jaeyun suddenly feels trapped in his new room, enveloped by the silence of being alone.\n\nInitially, he thought he could finally taste the freedom once he could have the space of his own. But, there are times where he’d find himself staring at the ceiling at midnight when sleep doesn’t come, wishing he could at least talk to someone. Hoping that Jongseong is still an arm’s length away.\n\nJaeyun would like to think that this was just a weird case of separation anxiety because he got used to having someone in the same room as him. And no, he doesn’t miss Jongseong like that. Why would he? They’re still in the same group, anyway.\n\n“Jake hyung, are you okay?” Jungwon asks once they’re settled inside the van. The older guy nods wordlessly, lowering his cap to cover almost half of his face. He leans his head on the window, trying to get some extra sleep.\n\n“What’s up with him?” Jaeyun hears the confusion in Ni-ki’s voice as the younger guy enters the van and sits behind them.\n\n“He’s just tired.” Jungwon answers simply and it leaves no further question.\n\nSilence fills inside the van and Jaeyun gradually drifts off to sleep, unaware of his surroundings and the short distance between their dorm and company building. A gentle tap on his cheek causes him to stir awake, his eyes adjusting to the sudden brightness from the outside.\n\nA gibberish noise comes out of his mouth and someone chuckles beside him which makes Jaeyun go rigid because he’s heard that specific laugh more often than not, especially during the night where they used to talk about scientific theories that don’t make any sense.\n\n“The kids already went inside the building. It’s time for us to go as well.” Jongseong tells him before going out of the van and waits for him by the door.\n\nJaeyun yawns and stretches his body, noticing a pillow wrapped around his neck. “Is this yours?”\n\nJongseong looks up from his phone and nods. “Oh yeah, you looked uncomfortable in your sleeping position earlier, so I thought you needed it.”\n\n“Weird, I would’ve woken up if that’s the case.” Jaeyun mumbles, placing the pillow on his seat before going out of the van. “I was probably knocked out the entire ride.”\n\n“Dude, you were even snoring so loud that all of us had to use our headphones.” Jongseong cackles and Jaeyun hits his arm because he knows he tends to snore when he’s exhausted. “Do you have trouble sleeping lately?”\n\nYes, and it’s somehow your fault. But Jaeyun doesn’t admit any of that, so instead he lies. “Nope. I was watching a series last night and I lost track of time.”\n\nThey’re walking side by side as they enter the building, with their manager waiting for them near the elevator doors. He ushers them inside with such haste that Jaeyun almost stumbles if it weren’t for Jongseong’s hand on his back.\n\n“I’ll make you some chamomile tea later when we get home.” Jongseong whispers, loud enough that only the two of them can hear.\n\nAnd Jaeyun suddenly feels warm all over, from his cheeks to the tips of his ears, spreading down to his neck and fingertips. How could a simple act of kindness make him feel so defeated and weak in the knees?\n\nHe wonders if this was all some kind of a fever dream that he’ll soon wake up from. But with Jongseong’s obvious presence behind Jaeyun and his hand that’s still lingering on his back, Jaeyun isn’t entirely sure anymore.\n\n“Okay.” He manages to breathe the words out. “Thank you.”\n\nJongseong really has a habit of confusing Jaeyun’s heart without having any idea about it.\n\nConfusion etches on Sunoo’s face once he opens the door of their dorm, and he sees Jongseong with a box of tea in his hand. The older guy just nods at him as a form of greeting before getting inside and walking straight to their kitchen.\n\n“Hyung, what are you doing here?” Sunoo asks, trailing behind him. Jongseong fills up the electric kettle with water and waits for it to boil.\n\n“I’m making tea for Jake.” Jongseong answers and his honesty causes Sunoo to choke on his ice cream. “What kind of reaction is that?”\n\nSunoo stands upright, both his hands on each side of his hips. “Why?”\n\n“Why?” Jongseong parrots back, earning a soft punch on his arm. “Can’t I make tea for him now?”\n\n“No, it’s not about that and you know it, hyung!” Sunoo squints his eyes as if he’s trying to discern Jongseong’s words and actions.\n\n“Well, whatever it is that you’re thinking, you’re wrong.” Jongseong immediately shuts him off, grabbing a mug from the cupboard and adding a packet of chamomile tea in it.\n\nSunoo scoffs and even if Jongseong has his back turned, he could imagine the younger guy rolling his eyes at him. “I’m telling Jungwon about this.”\n\n“Tell me what?” Jungwon enters the kitchen in his sweatpants and hoodie that he wore last night. “Also, what are you doing here, hyung?”\n\nJongseong groans at the same time the water boils, so he fusses around the kitchen in order for him to ignore the weird looks his members are throwing at him. He pours the hot water in the mug and mixes it with a spoon. He thinks of adding a spoonful of honey, but he’s certain that they don’t have one in their fridge.\n\n“Is Jake in his room?” Jongseong makes a beeline towards Jaeyun's bedroom door, dodging the younger guys’ attempt at cornering him with some silly questions.\n\n“Yeah, he is.” Sunoo nods, and then worry quickly flashes in his eyes that Jongseong managed to catch it. “Is he sick?”\n\n“No, this will just help him with his sleep, that’s all.”\n\nJungwon perks up. “Can we make one for ourselves too?”\n\nThe older guy nods before opening Jaeyun’s door. “Sure, if that’ll make you leave my ass alone, then help yourself.” Then he shuts the door and Jongseong is suddenly welcomed by complete darkness.\n\n“Jake?” Jongseong whispers, staying still by the door as he carefully scans the room. “Are you asleep?”\n\n“No,” Jaeyun groans. A rustling noise from the blanket indicates that Jaeyun probably moved to sit up. The small lamp perched on the headboard suddenly switches on and Jongseong finally sees the latter, hair disheveled and clothes rumpled. “What are you doing here?”\n\nJongseong walks towards Jaeyun, standing in front of him as he hands him the cup of tea. “I told you I’ll make you some tea, remember? Drink up before it gets cold.”\n\nJaeyun reaches for the mug, sighing when the warmth touches his bare palms. “Thank you.”\n\nA comfortable silence looms over them as Jongseong takes in Jaeyun’s new bedroom. He’s a frequent visitor in their dorm whether to eat or watch movies with Sunoo and Jungwon, yet he never really spent inside Jaeyun’s room for more than a minute.\n\nJongseong doesn’t know how to feel about all this—to pick apart all the things you used to do and have with someone, and come back empty handed. Their shared room before was much bigger than this; a huge cabinet made for two people and two single beds separated by a bedside table. There were also piles of dirty clothes and mismatched socks on the floor. And how their personal belongings somehow end up being used and owned by the both of them until at some point it stopped being Jay’s or Jake’s. Until it became theirs.\n\nJaeyun must have seen the contemplative look on his face because he tilts his head and asks, “what?”\n\n“You and I have the same room design.” Jongseong points out. He’s not a believer of fate and such, but he finds it amusing how they might not end up being roommates this time around, yet the universe still has some kind of way of reminding them what they used to be. “Are you done with your drink?”\n\n“Yeah,” Jaeyun nods, placing the empty mug on his computer table. “That tasted like shit, by the way.”\n\n“A fucking thank you would’ve been better.” Jongseong grits, flicking Jaeyun’s forehead with his fingers. The latter just laughed in response before tucking himself back into bed and pulling his blanket up until it reaches his chin. “Go to sleep, Jake. Let me know if you want me to make you chamomile tea for tomorrow again.”\n\nJaeyun purses his lips and Jongseong forces himself to avert his gaze. “I can make them on my own.”\n\n“I know, but you’re such a klutz and I don’t trust you.” Jaeyun didn’t have the chance to fight back when Jongseong added, “besides I wanted to do it for you.”\n\nWildfire begins to scatter around Jaeyun’s heart and every flicker sends a quick thump against his ribcage. He buries his face further into the blanket, hoping that Jongseong won’t notice the glow on his cheeks and the tremble of his hands.\n\n“I’ll head back to my room.” Jongseong informs him quietly, picking up the mug to wash it before leaving. “Just text me if you need anything.”\n\nJaeyun closes his eyes once the older guy turns to leave. He’s afraid that the warmth he feels around Jongseong would leave too.\n\nBut the wildfire doesn’t stop burning until he falls asleep.\n\nOne of the doors on the tenth floor of the building opens, and Sunoo is no longer surprised to see Jongseong getting inside with another box of chamomile tea and a jar of honey in his hands. He goes straight to the kitchen like clockwork, and Sunoo finally leaves him be after numerous attempts of prying the older guy for answers that Jongseong refuses to give.\n\n“This is the fourth night you’ve barged in our dorm just to make Jake hyung some tea.” Jungwon comments, entering the kitchen as soon as he hears the familiar sound of boiling water. “And it’s not like he can’t make one for himself. So really, what’s going on?”\n\nJongseong shrugs. “I’m just being nice.”\n\n“I know you’re a nice person, Jay hyung,” Jungwon agrees by nodding aggressively. “But this is just…way too nice?”\n\nIn a quiet voice, Jongseong couldn’t help but ask, “is it weird?”\n\nJungwon notes the shift in his tone; a bit timid, so unlike Jongseong. “No hyung, it’s not weird. I guess I just haven’t seen you take care of someone this intensely.”\n\nJongseong laughs, and yet both of them know it seems forced. “What? But I take good care of you. All of you, to be exact.”\n\n“Yes, you do, and we’re so lucky to have you.” Jungwon nods, patting Jongseong’s head even if he has to tiptoe a little bit. “Now, go deliver that tea to Jake hyung. He’s actually been waiting for you.”\n\nJongseong scurries to Jaeyun’s room, hiding the delicate warmth that spreads to his face and hoping that he’d be welcomed by utter darkness again. Instead, he’s standing face to face with Jaeyun who looks just as surprised as him.\n\nUp close, Jongseong notices the freckles on Jaeyun’s nose and across his cheeks. Stunned, he traces them with his eyes and commits them to memory. Jongseong knew ever since the beginning—the very first time he laid his eyes on him that he even had to tell a staff about it—that Jaeyun is undeniably beautiful.\n\n“You’re here.” The thick tension cuts through the moment Jaeyun steps back and moves to the side, letting Jongseong enter his room.\n\n“Were you waiting for me?” Jongseong jokes once he’s done placing the mug on the table. He stares at Jaeyun with a smug look on his face and the latter scowls at him, showing him his middle finger. “That’s what Jungwon told me!”\n\n“Whatever helps you sleep at night, Jongseong.”\n\n“Well this,” He points at the mug beside him. “will help you sleep. So drink it up while it’s still hot.”\n\nJaeyun doesn’t tell him that it probably has become a Pavlovian effect at this point and it’s not just the chamomile tea that’s making him fall asleep.\n\nWhen night time comes and the clock strikes eleven, Jaeyun has grown attuned to the sound of Jongseong’s footsteps outside his bedroom, and the exact creak of the door when he opens it and steps inside. The moment he spots Jongseong despite the lack of light inside his room, there’s relief that resides in his chest.\n\nIt’s as if he could finally put his bones and heart at rest.\n\nJaeyun gives him a tired smile, picking up the mug and taking a careful sip. He immediately winces when the tea scalds his tongue and Jongseong watches him in alarm. “Ow, what the fuck?”\n\nJongseong sighs, sitting on Jaeyun’s gaming chair with his hand on his forehead. “You’re such an idiot! I told you it was hot.”\n\nThey stare at each other in momentary silence before they break out in loud laughter. Jaeyun stirs and blows the tea to somehow cool it down, drinking it up again carefully this time. “You know, you really don’t have to do this every night.”\n\n“It’s fine.” The older guy leans back on the chair and shrugs nonchalantly. “I like taking care of my friends, so it’s not really a big deal.”\n\nAnd the words shouldn’t have made Jaeyun’s heart sink, but it did. But he masks his hurt by smiling with practiced ease, a coping mechanism he’s taught himself whenever he has to hide his raw emotions and pretends to be unaffected by the things that are bothering him.\n\n“I’m your number one enemy, Park Jongseong.” It leaves a bitter taste in his mouth and he’s quite sure it’s not from the tea he’s drinking.\n\n“You are,” Jongseong agrees with an easy smile on his face. The one that makes him look softer despite his sharp features. “But you’re still my best friend too.”\n\nIt’s not exactly the type of comfort that Jaeyun wants, but who is he to complain? He would rather take whatever he can get than have nothing at all.\n\n“Mine is Sunghoon.” Jaeyun cracks a joke.\n\nHe’s never really built for conversations that allow him to lay down all his feelings. Treating them as if it’s a trivial matter helps him pretend that it’s not real and it’s easier to run away from them.\n\n“You’re so annoying.” Jongseong sulks and Jaeyun has to grip the mug tighter, afraid that he might say or do something stupid. “Is this how you repay me after I’ve been making you tea?”\n\nJaeyun raises his eyebrows, mischief gleaming on his face. “Oh? Do you want a kiss from me, Jongsaenggie?”\n\nJongseong smirks, moving the chair closer to Jaeyun until their knees are touching. Panic settles in for the both of them, and yet no one dares to break the tension.\n\nThe older guy leans in, just close enough that he could recount the constellations on Jaeyun’s face. “Give it to me then, if you’re brave enough.”\n\n“You’re such a little shit.” Then a pillow hits Jongseong’s face that has him falling back on the chair. Rather than a complaint, an obnoxious laugh comes out of the older guy’s mouth that has him closing his eyes and tipping his head back.\n\nAnd the earth beneath Jaeyun crumbles.\n\nHe misses having Jongseong this close and he misses hearing his laugh, knowing that he’s the sole reason behind it. It’s not like Jaeyun isn’t aware of his own feelings, he just didn’t want to acknowledge the truth and the meaning it holds.\n\nYet, he’s here. Everything he’s tried to run away from is here: from his own self to Jongseong, who has the ability to discern his thoughts far better than Jaeyun can.\n\n“But you still love me anyway.”\n\nAnd that’s the problem, isn’t it?\n\nFor a change, Jaeyun finds himself inside Ni-ki’s room, playing a game of Fifa with Sunghoon. There isn't any schedule lined up for them tomorrow, not even a practice, which is quite weird but Jaeyun has learned how to count his blessings.\n\nSurprisingly though, his sleeping pattern has gone back to normal. He no longer has to roll over his bed to find the perfect position and count sheep just to fall asleep. The moment his back meets his mattress, he dozes off immediately.\n\nAnd with that, it caused Jongseong to stop visiting their dorms at night, but it didn’t refrain Jongseong from buying boxes of chamomile tea and having it delivered on the tenth floor dorm. To this day, Jaeyun religiously makes himself tea and informs Jongseong right before he goes to bed.\n\n“Where’s Heeseung hyung?” Jaeyun questions, watching the game unfold in front of him.\n\n“He’s playing League of Legends with Sunoo.” Sunghoon answers, his eyes never leaving the screen and his fingers moving hastily on the console.\n\nThe game goes on for a while and Jaeyun is getting drowsy, his eyelids getting heavier up to the moment he could no longer open his eyes fully. His head is resting on the back of the couch, drowning out the noises from his friends.\n\n“Hyung, wake up.” Someone pats his arm and shakes his shoulder gently. “It’s one in the morning, you have to go back to your room.”\n\nJaeyun isn’t sure how long he was out, but when he wakes up, Ni-ki’s room is completely dark and Sunghoon is no longer with them. He groans, mumbling incoherent words that the younger guy couldn’t decipher.\n\n“Oh hyung, you can’t go back to sleep. No, no, no.” Ni-ki panics when Jaeyun settles comfortably on the couch as though he’s fine sleeping on it. “I’m gonna call Jay hyung.”\n\nNi-ki runs out of his room to knock on Jongseong’s door, opening it straight away without waiting for any response. There he finds the older guy on the bed with his guitar on his lap, probably trying to learn a new song judging by the guitar tab on his phone.\n\n“What?” Jongseong raises his eyebrow, putting his guitar to the side.\n\n“Jake hyung fell asleep on my couch and I don’t wanna hear him nagging about his sore back when he wakes up later.”\n\nJongseong sighs and Ni-ki thought he’d leave him to fix his problem on his own, but Jongseong slips out of the bed and slides on his slippers. “Should we put him on your bed instead?”\n\n“No.” Ni-ki quickly answers without any hesitation. Jongseong gawks at him and Ni-ki puts his arms up in surrender. “I love him, but I want the bed all by myself for our day off, hyung. You have to understand me.”\n\n“I can’t possibly bring him to his floor, the kids are probably sleeping already.”\n\n“You can call Yuki hyung.”\n\n“He’s with his wife, remember?”\n\n“But hyung,” Ni-ki whines and it’s times like this that Jongseong is reminded of how young and spoiled he is. “You can just let Jake hyung sleep on your bed. It’s fine, right? You used to be roommates anyway, so it’s not a big deal.”\n\nBut it is a big deal. Jongseong wants to argue. He’s never really had Jake on the same bed as him, even if they were roommates for years. Their beds were separated by a table and other belongings that could fit the space in between them, and Jaeyun always felt so far away from Jongseong despite him being within a breadth’s reach.\n\n“Okay, but you have to carry him. My knees are still recovering.”\n\nThe younger guy doesn’t object to his request, dashing back to his room and carrying Jaeyun on his back. Strangely, Jaeyun doesn’t wake up when Ni-ki pulls him by his arm and carries him to Jongseong’s room, dropping him carefully on the older guy’s bed.\n\n“Can I go to sleep now too, hyung?” Ni-ki yawns, rubbing his eyes harshly that Jongseong has to chastise him for it.\n\n“Yeah, sleep well, kid.”\n\nOnce Jongseong is left all alone, he slips under the covers and lies on his side of the bed stiffly, staring at the ceiling and listening to the thumping of his heart. This should be okay, right? There is nothing wrong with sharing a bed with your bandmate who has known you for a long period of time.\n\nBut, Jongseong knows that this isn’t okay for him.\n\nHaving Jaeyun so close that he could reach out and trace the constellations on his face with the tip of his finger. To watch him fall asleep and think that it wouldn’t be so bad having this for the rest of Jongseong’s life.\n\nDeep down, this is wrong and utterly bad for Jongseong and for his heart. He’s always worn his heart on his sleeves and he’s afraid that Jaeyun would see right through him. And there is nothing more frightening than the thought of ruining years of friendship built upon trust.\n\nSo Jongseong closes his eyes, and hopes for the better.\n\nJaeyun wakes up in the middle of the night, wondering why there’s an arm wrapped around his waist. A familiar scent of sandalwood infiltrates his nose and he could recognize that smell even from a far distance. He doesn’t move an inch, doesn’t even glance up to check if his hunch was right because he knows who this is. Knows it from his touch alone.\n\nBeing on the receiving end of Jongseong’s affection doesn’t come by often, especially for Jaeyun. Their friendship has been centered by brusque words and physical fights that it’s hard to show a simple act of tenderness without baring his soul and his feelings to Jongseong.\n\nAnd Jaeyun thinks he will probably never have this again, so he closes his eyes and falls into a deep slumber because as soon as he’ll wake up in the morning, this will all mean nothing.\n\n“Can we talk?”\n\nJongseong almost leaps out of his chair when Heeseung enters the studio booth without any warning. The younger guy turns the music’s volume down and makes space for the latter to sit on the extra swivel chair.\n\nTheir daily practice ended an hour ago and most of the members have gone home to rest, but Jongseong decided to stay and play with his electric guitar since he can’t freely do it in their dorm.\n\n“What do you want to talk about, hyung?”\n\n“Is there something going on between you and Jake?” In the years that Jongseong has known Heeseung, he’s never fond of beating around the bush, especially if it concerns their work life. Still, his bluntness causes the younger guy to gape at him, the gears in his head working overtime.\n\n“What?” Jongseong managed to squeak out.\n\n“Jungwon told me you were always at their dorm every night making tea for Jake. Sunoo even said that you sometimes hang around in Jake’s room until he falls asleep. And I actually saw Jake sneaking out of your room at the crack of dawn last week.”\n\nListening to Heeseung mention all their observations makes him sink deeper in his chair, hoping that it’ll somehow bury him alive. There isn’t any ounce of judgment on Heeseung’s face, just pure curiosity and concern, but it doesn’t make things any better anyway.\n\nIt just adds to Jongseong’s list of where things went wrong because—“he’s been ignoring me.” He admits plain and simple.\n\n“Oh, that’s why.” Heeseung muses, a look of realization on his face that Jongseong doesn’t seem to grasp.\n\n“What do you mean by that?”\n\nFor a moment, Heeseung contemplates on whether he’d admit it or not, but Jongseong is staring at him expectantly. “Everyone noticed it too, that's why I wanted to talk to you. Did something happen?”\n\nJongseong snorts. “The thing is, hyung, nothing even happened for him to ignore me.” He fidgets the skin around his thumb, a habit he does whenever he’s anxious. “Or I don’t know. He won’t even respond to my texts.”\n\nHeeseung places his hand on Jongseong’s shoulder, patting it in a comforting manner. “It’s going to be okay, Jay. We’ll also talk to him, don’t worry.”\n\n“Thanks, hyung.” Jongseong smiles, tight-lipped. “Just don’t force him to admit anything if he doesn’t want to. Jake’s gonna come around when he’s ready.”\n\nHeeseung’s gaze softens as he stands up to leave. “You really care for him, don’t you?”\n\n“Of course, hyung, he’s my friend.” Jongseong’s eyes are downcast, missing the way Heeseung smiles knowingly at him.\n\n“Yeah, sure.” Heeseung agrees easily. “But Jake is also more than that, right?”\n\nThe question has Jongseong snapping his head up, eyes wide as though denial is sitting at the tip of his tongue, compelled to argue with Heeseung’s claim. Yet, the younger guy still isn’t sure what to say or how to defend himself until Heeseung realizes that Jongseong still has some uncharted territory he needs to figure out on his own.\n\n“Don’t think about it too much and don’t stay up too late. I’m heading out first, so I’ll see you at the dorm.”\n\nJongseong ended up staying inside the studio booth for at least an hour or so just to think about the implication behind Heeseung’s words.\n\nJaeyun should have known that it’s pointless to avoid someone who you work and live with twenty-four-seven. Everyone immediately noticed the sudden rift between him and Jongseong because they’ve been devising plans to make them talk, but they keep failing miserably.\n\nSunoo had given him a new box of chamomile tea from Jongseong, but it remained untouched inside the cupboard for days.\n\nJungwon almost tricked him into coming out of his room for a late night snack and movie marathon when he heard Jongseong’s scream at the living room which resulted in him ditching them.\n\nHeeseung, Sunghoon, and Ni-ki invited him to play a game to which he agreed. But when he entered their Discord group chat a bit earlier than planned, he saw Jongseong’s profile and the green circle on his picture that indicated his online status. Quickly, Jaeyun turned off his computer and went to bed, putting his phone on do not disturb mode and ignoring the incoming messages and calls.\n\nDuring practice, he keeps their interactions as minimal as possible. Jaeyun always used to call Jongseong out jokingly if the older guy gets his position or dance move wrong, but that never happened at all. Jaeyun has mostly kept his mouth shut at dance practices, only talking when necessary. He’s intent on memorizing the choreography to avoid mistakes and the possibility of Jongseong striking a conversation with him.\n\nIt’s all just a matter of time anyway before something snaps and it will either fix them or break them further apart.\n\nSleep doesn’t come easy once again for Jaeyun, but he sucks it up and deals with an unhealthy coping mechanism of binge-watching a series until he falls asleep on his gaming chair.\n\nAnd if he gets sore muscles when he wakes up the next day, he pretends it doesn’t bother him the way he pretends he doesn’t notice the concern glances Jongseong throws at him. He’s certain that it’s not real, only fueled by his own delusions and sleep deprivation.\n\nThere’s a sudden knock on his door that startles him, pausing the movie on his computer. “What?”\n\n“Hyung, I have something for you.” Jaeyun hears Sunoo from the other side of the door. “Open up!”\n\nBegrudgingly, Jaeyun gets up from his chair and trudges his way to open the door with caution, just in case Jongseong is around the corner. When he sees that it’s just Sunoo with a hot chamomile tea on his hands, Jaeyun visibly relaxes.\n\n“What?”\n\n“Jungwon made some tea and he told me to give you one.” Sunoo offers him the tea and Jaeyun takes it this time. “Drink it, okay? You’ve been looking so tired these past few days, hyung.”\n\nThe older guy sighs and offers him a small smile. “Thanks, Sun. And yeah, I will.”\n\nSunoo grins, all bright and bubbly. It makes Jaeyun wonder where he gets his energy from when it’s already late at night. He leaves after that and Jaeyun closes his door to return to the show he’s watching.\n\nNot even a few minutes later, someone knocks on his door again, loudly this time. There is urgency behind his knocks that has Jaeyun leaping off his chair and running towards the door to open it hastily.\n\n“Jungwon?” Jaeyun asks, out of breath and confused. “What the fuck is going on?”\n\nThe younger guy doesn’t seem bothered by Jaeyun’s bafflement. Instead, he’s smiling at him with a mischievous glint in his eyes. “We forgot to bring you something.”\n\nHe furrowed his eyebrows. “What?”\n\n“Hyung!” Jungwon calls out and Jongseong comes out from hiding behind the wall. His steps seem to be heavy as he stands beside Jungwon, and Jaeyun could only stare in silence and shock. “You do know that communication is key, right?”\n\n“But—”\n\n“And I’ll still have to force you to talk to each other if you decide to run away from this.” Jungwon takes a quick glance at Jaeyun and everyone knows it was meant for him. “I’m going to leave now so you two better solve this.”\n\nThe way Jungwon said it was firm and left no room for arguments, but the sight of Jongseong snaps Jaeyun from his trance. He immediately reaches for the door, ready to slam it shut, but Jongseong is quicker.\n\n“I’m going to sleep, we can talk tomorrow.” Jaeyun stops putting up a fight when he can’t close the door without hurting Jongseong’s hand.\n\n“You honestly look like you haven’t slept for days, and suddenly you’re going to sleep?” Jongseong states, calling him out for his lame attempt at lying. Jaeyun has never been good at pretending, anyway. “This can’t go on, Jake. You have to tell me what’s wrong.”\n\n“There’s nothing to tell, Jay.” Jaeyun insists and his patience is already wearing thin.\n\n“Really? Because you’ve been ignoring me for days now.” Jongseong seems so resigned that Jaeyun’s heart breaks at the sight of him. “And I just wanted to know if I did something wrong. You know I’d apologize to you in a heartbeat, just tell me.”\n\nThere is hesitation in Jaeyun’s body language that Jongseong notices, and no matter how desperate he is to fix this problem between them, he’s never going to force an answer out of him.\n\nAnd so with a defeated sigh, Jongseong nods as though he’s ending their conversation for tonight. Some other time, he thinks. When he’s ready. When he locks gazes with the latter, Jongseong offers Jaeyun a smile that doesn’t quite reach his eyes, but enough to convey that he understands if there are problems he can’t share yet, especially if the problem involves him.\n\n“I’ll be heading back to my room now. Hope you’ll drink the tea I made you.” Jongseong doesn’t break eye contact and Jaeyun itches to look away, but he feels pinned under his gaze.\n\nThere is no remorse or judgment in Jongseong’s eyes—just docility and kindness. Jaeyun hasn’t even uttered any apologies for his childish behavior, and yet he already feels forgiven.\n\n“You can’t do that, Jay.” Jaeyun suddenly speaks, his voice quieter than he intended to, but he needs to consider the words he’s going to utter from now on. Maybe it’s time to actually say what he feels or maybe not. Still, Jongseong deserves a bit of his honesty.\n\n“Do what?” Jongseong can see the younger guy struggling to come up with what to say and it feels like a new discovery because Jaeyun always knows what to say.\n\n“Make me tea when I can’t sleep. Allow me to sleep beside you when I get too lazy to go back to my own room. Let me get away with things that usually annoy the shit out of you.” Jaeyun lists it all down as if the answers are hidden beneath those words. As if it’s supposed to mean something for Jongseong like it did for Jaeyun.\n\nBut it doesn’t.\n\n“I don’t understand.”\n\n“Me neither.” Jaeyun breathes in, ignoring the tremor of his hands. “I don’t understand how you could do all those things and expect me not to want more from you.”\n\n“Jake,” Jongseong interrupts him gently, but Jaeyun could no longer hear anything aside from the loud thumping of his heart.\n\n“I knew I was right when I told Sunoo it was just your natural instinct to care about your friends and I was a fucking dumbass to fall for it, anyway, when it was supposed to mean nothing.”\n\n“It’s not nothing.” Jongseong emphasizes and he’s staring at Jaeyun as if he’s trying to prove something. “Do you really think I’d willingly do all that if I don’t feel anything for you?”\n\nJaeyun freezes, his eyes wide as takes in the words Jongseong just said, wondering if he heard him right. “What the fuck are you talking about?”\n\nJongseong lets the words fall off his mouth like a tangible secret only the two of them know. Suspended in the air until Jaeyun acknowledges what the latter has been trying to imply. “I’m telling you that I love you, in case you haven’t picked it up yet.”\n\n“No, you don’t.” Jaeyun stammers and there’s a ringing in his ears that he can’t seem to get rid of.\n\n“What?” Jongseong seemed to be caught off-guard, but Jaeyun kept shaking his head vehemently. “Why are you acting like you know my feelings better than I do?”\n\n“Because you obviously don’t!”\n\n“Stop saying that!”\n\n“Woah,” Jungwon is standing by the end of the hallway, blinking in shock as he watches the two of them bicker. And he should have known that this—thick unresolved tension—was different from all the fights they used to have before. “Are you two fighting?”\n\n“No!” Jaeyun shouts at the same time Jongseong answers a quiet yes.\n\n“Well, can you please do your loud talking inside Jake hyung’s room instead?” Jungwon’s voice might be teasing, but his eyes say otherwise. It’s authoritative and unwavering that Jaeyun has no other choice than to pull Jongseong inside his room.\n\nJaeyun sits on the edge of his bed while Jongseong remains rooted by the door. They’re trying to process what actually happened in the past few minutes that led up to this mess.\n\nNeither of them are terrible with words. They know what to say on different occasions given that they were trained to do so. But, no one really has given them the manual response on how to deal with a friendship that’s about to drift apart.\n\nIn the quiet of the night, Jongseong could help but ask, “what made you think…” I couldn’t love you? The words don't leave his mouth but Jaeyun hears it, anyway.\n\nJaeyun shrugs, all the fight leaving his body. “It’s not that you aren’t capable of loving, you idiot. I just never really thought of giving us a shot.”\n\n“Huh, why?”\n\nJaeyun glances up, a forlorn smile on his face that shatters Jongseong’s heart. “Because I thought this was the only thing I could ever have from you and I tried being okay with it.”\n\n“But it didn’t work out, right?”\n\n“Obviously,” Jaeyun scoffs, rolling his eyes. “It didn’t.”\n\n“Good.” Jongseong walks to where Jaeyun is seated, kneeling to the ground to look at him face to face.\n\nBut the younger guy hits his arm and pulls him up to let him sit on the bed. “You’re gonna hurt your knees, dumbass.”\n\n“My knees are fine.” Jongseong reassures him, even lightly patting his kneecap to show him that he’s getting better. “But what isn’t fine is the fact that I made you think I don’t feel the same way. Because I do, Jake. I’ve always liked you then. But now, I have this huge amount of love for you, I don't even know where to put it.”\n\nWithout meaning to, Jaeyun laughs, pushing Jongseong to topple on his bed. “You are so disgustingly sappy.”\n\nJongseong pulls him down as well until they’re both lying on the bed and watching the empty ceiling. “I mean it though. I do take care for a lot people, that's true. But, doing it for you for a lifetime doesn't seem so bad.\"\n\n“I believe you.” Jaeyun whispers, closing his eyes. “I just couldn’t grasp that this is real, you know? I’m scared that if I wake up, this is all just some silly dream.”\n\n“I won’t leave.” Jongseong whispers back like a promise. “I’ll stay here as long as you want me to.”\n\nJongseong’s presence brings back the familiarity of their shared room and how he always feels safe knowing he’s there. I really miss you. Jaeyun wants to blurt out, but he’s tired and he feels better now that he’s in Jongseong’s arms.\n\nWhen morning came, Jongseong stayed just as he promised.\n\nEvents from last night finally settle in as Jaeyun wakes up from his sleep. And he has the sudden urge to run away from embarrassment because he’s not one to admit his feelings out in the open, but he feels Jongseong’s grip around his waist tightens and then he pulls him closer to his chest.\n\n“Don’t think of running away from me again.” The older guy mumbles, voice still laced with sleep.\n\n“I’m just embarrassed, you dipshit.” Jaeyun grumbles, pinching Jongseong’s skin to which the latter hissed in pain.\n\n“There’s nothing to be embarrassed about, Jake, it’s just me.” Jaeyun nods, grateful that Jongseong isn’t making their confession such a big deal despite that it should be, but in the grand scheme of things, this is probably just a small percentage of what’s about to unfold in the future for the both of them.\n\n“I have a question though.” Jongseong is combing through his hair, and the gesture is making him fall asleep again. “Last night, you told me you missed me. What does that mean?”\n\nIt’s one thing to truly understand your feelings, and another to share it out loud with the person you harbor these feelings for.\n\nBut Jaeyun had enough of hiding and lying. It’s not what Jongseong deserves. It’s not what he deserves. So he breathes out and tells him:\n\n“I miss having you as my roommate.” He begins with that. “Ever since I got this space for myself, it felt really empty. I thought it’ll probably be fleeting, but it kept me up every night.”\n\n“Is that why you have trouble sleeping?” Jongseong lies on his side, propping his elbow to stare at Jaeyun.\n\n“Yeah, though the tea helped a lot.” Jaeyun gives him an appreciative smile. “I don’t know, Jay, I just miss having you around and so damn near me all the time I kept looking for you unconsciously.”\n\nJongseong looks smug as he teases. “You love me that much?”\n\nAnd it was meant to be a joke, really. Jongseong wasn’t expecting a proper answer from that but Jaeyun looked him straight in the eyes, all fierce and determined.\n\n“I love you in ways you don’t understand.”\n\n“Show me then.” Jongseong challenges. “Make me understand, Jake.”\n\nJaeyun reaches out to tilt Jongseong’s chin up and pulls him closer until his warm breath ghosts over his lips. “Can I?”\n\nA subtle nod was all it took for Jaeyun to lean forward and capture Jongseong’s lips with his. There isn’t a trace of tentativeness with their kiss. Not when Jongseong lets his tongue run along the seam of Jaeyun’s lip which makes the younger guy willingly part his mouth, all inhibitions were thrown away outside the window.\n\nJaeyun tilts his head back and Jongseong uses this as an advantage to slide his hand on the younger guy’s nape, pulling him closer to kiss him deeper and more languidly. Jongseong lets out a guttural groan when Jaeyun sucks on his tongue and then bites his bottom lip before pulling away.\n\nThey’re both catching their breaths and the sun outside continues to rise until everything else feels warm and bright.\n\nJongseong watches Jaeyun, and he couldn’t help but throw his head back in delight. His heart aches with how much he truly loves him.\n\n“Jongseong?” Jaeyun asks, tone soft like a prayer he just learned.\n\nThere is adoration in his eyes that’s only meant for Jaeyun, and the younger guy basks in it. “God, I really love you.”\n\nJaeyun takes Jongseong’s hand and places it on his clothed chest where his heart lies. “I love you too.”\n\nAnd Jaeyun’s heart is no longer hammering against his ribcage. Instead, it’s a steady and calm beat that sounds a lot like home."
