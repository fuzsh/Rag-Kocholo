        "text": "U2's song 'Walk On' is a stirring anthem of resilience and hope in the face of adversity. The lyrics, penned by lead singer Bono, encourage listeners to persevere through difficult times by holding onto love, which is depicted as the only 'baggage' one can bring along on life's journey. The song suggests that love is both a burden and a beacon, something that cannot be left behind even when it makes the path harder to walk.\n\nThe song's chorus, 'Walk on, walk on,' serves as a rallying cry, urging strength and courage when facing the trials of life. The notion that what one possesses internally cannot be stolen or diminished by external forces is a powerful message of inner strength and self-worth. The lyrics also touch on the concept of home and belonging, suggesting that home is not always a physical place but can be an emotional state or a sense of purpose that one is striving to reach.\n\n'Walk On' is not just about personal struggle; it also contains a broader message of freedom and the human spirit's unbreakable will. The reference to a 'singing bird in an open cage' who chooses to fly for freedom resonates with the idea that true liberation comes from the choice to pursue what is believed in, despite the risks or challenges. This song, released in the early 2000s, continues to inspire those who face oppression, loss, or personal battles, reminding them that they can overcome and 'leave behind' the pain and hardship."
