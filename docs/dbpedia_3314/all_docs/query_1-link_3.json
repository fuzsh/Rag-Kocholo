        "text": "[SIMG]http://bonovox.interference.com/reviews/staythumb.gif[/SIMG]\n\nBy annj\n\nDirector- Wim Wenders\n\nProducer -Debbie Mason\n\n1993\n\nU2?s videos relay perceptions of the band's music for our eyes to feast on. They can be great talking points for discussion, conjuring up a spectrum of reactions and responses from viewers. This column takes a look at some of U2's videos, analyzing the visual, lyrical and historical context of each to glean a better understanding of what these small films are communicating.\n\nThis installment is dedicated to \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\" from ?Zooropa.? This video stands out for me because unlike so many others from U2's catalog where the songs come first for me and the video is secondary, in this case it was the video that brought the song to my attention. The first time I saw the clip for \"Stay,\" I was easily drawn to the images before my eyes.\n\nThe video and song are connected with Wim Wenders? 1987 film ?Wings of Desire,? with a plot centering on angels in trench coats who attempt to give solace to world-weary souls in war torn Berlin; a city U2 became familiar with after recording part of ?Achtung Baby? there in 1991 just after the fall of the Berlin Wall, which gives the video added significance. Understanding the film?s theme of angels helps us to contextually unite it with the video of ?Stay.? Wenders and U2 have collaborated many times, and this video or short movie is a fine example of how well they work together. So much so that the song was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award as Best Original Song for Motion Picture from the film of the same name. According to U2.com, the final soundtrack version of ?Stay,? ?contained extra ad-libs and a few extra lines, plus a remixed instrumental track.?\n\n(Image: U2.com)\n\nLike ?Wings of Desire? which was shot in both black and white and color, ?Stay? opens with crisp, clear black and white shots of the members of U2 with passengers on a public transportation bus in Berlin. The opening moments of the song blend so well with the movement of the video, I could just picture sitting in a bus feeling a little weary after a tiring day and the music with Bono's mellow intonations as his singing just fits right in. Another notable observation is that ?Stay? seems to show the members of U2 in what could be considered their first acting role as angels observing humans on the bus, such as Edge playing with the tiny musical toy and listening to it with an expression of fascination, an action carried on throughout the video.\n\nThe next scene picks up at a shack or warehouse where a group of young musicians are practicing. We see the members of U2 with them there and decide to go in to investigate the jam session. I love that you see the unknown band and the members of U2 joining them -- Larry picking up the drumstick and beating in time with the drummer, Edge with the guitar player tuning it up as he is playing, Adam watching over the bass player, Bono singing along with the female singer; you can feel the connection there, though they are not visible to the unknown band, they are urging them on and encouraging them, their guardian angels who have an interest in their music.\n\nThrough the video we see a shot of a large wingspan, as well as the other members of U2 sitting on the high statue of the angel. The panorama has a haunting beautiful quality about it that fits so well with the song (which is mainly about angels interacting with humans on earth, as in the Wenders film), and is also underlining what I believe is the song's central message of not giving up, that there are unseen forces there backing you up and helping you along. Upon further inspection of the lyrics, it is possible to infer that Bono might be singing in character as the fallen angel who is, \"So close but faraway,\" deciding he wants to remain on earth so he can be with humans and become one of them, just like the character in ?Wings of Desire.?\n\nThis connection to the film's theme brings deeper meaning to both the lyrics, \"And if you look/You look through me/And when you talk/You talk at me/And when I touch you/You don't feel a thing,\" and the video. As Bono sings these words you get a new understanding of the scene where he is standing next to the female singer of the unknown group, perhaps realising he wants to be seen and touched and feel as a human does and wishes to explore the gift of making music.\n\nIn ?Wings of Desire,? one of the angels falls in love with a woman and wishes to become mortal. At the end of the video, we see Bono leaping from the high statue to land on the ground in the middle of the road with the words, \"Just the bang and the clatter/As an angel hits the ground.\" The exuberance of his new mortality shows as he happily runs off down the road to his new human life on earth and perhaps as a brilliant musician.\n\nHi Annj ? thanks for your wonderful piece on the beautiful video for Stay.\n\nWings Of Desire is an excellent film. I highly recommend it. It?s on Ebert?s top 100 films (checkout his review.) I have read a number of reviews where critics put it on their all-time favourite film?s list. When I show it to people it frequently ends being among their top 3 films. It came out on DVD with a Director?s commentary last year. Beautifully photographed and directed. It is a deep philosophical / spiritual film. And there is a romantic story there too : - ) Be forewarned - it is in black & white / its in German (with English subtitles) / and it is a very slow film (think of Lost In Translation / The Girl With The Pearl Earring / Kitchen Stories (new on DVD a couple weeks ago = excellent).\n\nWim Wenders & U2\n\n1.) I read an interview in which Bono related that he based the lyric style of writing of Running To Stand Still on the last scene conversation between the husband and wife in the Wender?s film Paris Texas.\n\n2.) I think that the All I Want Is You video may be possibly connected to Wender?s film Wings Of Desire. The lead female in both is a circus trapeze artist. Wings ends with the circus heading south for the winter. AIWIY is set on a beach in Italy. The ?lover? in Wings misses her as the circus leaves for the south (but he accidentally bumps into her at a nightclub). AIWIY could be a continuation of this story as if they didn?t meet each other at the end of Wings. And instead of angel becoming human as a typical man he comes to life as a small person / a short person. Even though in Wings the woman is longing for a ?genuine? love (regardless of physical appearance) and she thinks and feels at very deep level - in the AIWISY video it could be what sometimes happens in real life ? that is she ?compromises? her values and principles. She ?sells out? for merely a physical and material love > she stops listening to her heart / conscience > she ?settles? for an easy love / a superficial romance. She rejects the small person?s love. When she realizes her mistake it is too late. Her ?heart? has died symbolized by her physical death. Both are filmed in black and white. I?ll have to watch the video again to see if U2 are portrayed themselves as angel-like figures in it?\n\n3.) Wenders directed U2?s Night And Day video.\n\n4.) U2 contributed an alternate studio version of Until The End Of The World to the Wenders film of the same name. (Lanois contributed a track too.)\n\n5.) Wenders directed U2?s Stay (Faraway So Close) video and it is included on the soundtrack of his film Faraway So Close (which the sequel to Wings Of Desire). The Best Of 90s Videos DVD has a Director?s commentary by Wenders.\n\n6.) Wenders film Par-dela Les Nuages (Italian title) or Beyond The Clouds (U.S. title) featured both \"Your Blue Room\" and \"Beach Sequence\" from U2?s Passengers album.\n\n7.) U2 contributed their song I?m Not Your Baby to Wenders film The End Of Violence.\n\n8.) Wim Wenders directed a film about the making of the Teatro album ?Willie Nelson At The Teatro? (which was the Lanois recording studio at the time). Daniel Lanois (the co-fifth member of U2) is in it as he was a performer on it and the producer of the album. U2 wrote Slow Dancing for Nelson and they recorded it together in 1997. Emmylou Harris performs too (Larry performed on her Grammy winning and outstanding album Wrecking Ball).\n\n9.) Wenders directed Bono?s film The Million Dollar Hotel. Sometimes the IFC channel shows The Making Of MDH. It has some interesting behind the scenes with Bono. Hopefully - there will be DVD re-release of MDH with this documentary / a Director?s commentary with Bono! / a documentary on the making of the soundtrack! / the TGBHF video / and other bonus features. Wenders wrote a book about the making of MDH called The Heart is a Sleeping Beauty. (Has anybody read it?)\n\n10.) Wenders directed U2?s video The Ground Beneath Her Feet.\n\nu2.com was wrong about there being an instrumental version of Stay on the Faraway So Close soundtrack. ?Stay features a slightly different musical track and is a minute longer than the album version. There are no additional lyrics included in Stay, but Bono does sing more \"do do do do's\" throughout the song.? - u2wanderer.org. There could a nice single or an EP of just different versions of Stay:\n\n1.) Stay (album) (4:58)\n\n2.) Stay (alternate soundtrack version) (6:06)\n\n3.) Stay (Underdog Mix ? Melon album) (6:45)\n\n4.) Stay (?Craig Armstrong version? on his 2002 As If To Nothing album ? new vocal by Bono ? uses violins) (6:02)\n\n5.) Stay (full band live version ? Dublin August 28 1993 Zoo Europa bootleg) (5:20)\n\n6.) Stay (acoustic live version ? Canadian Stuck single & Walk On single) (5:39)"
