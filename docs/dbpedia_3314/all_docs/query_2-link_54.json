        "text": "Voting Rules\n\nVote up the songs with backstories so compelling, they make you appreciate the songs anew.\n\nWith a difficult songwriting process that involves writing lyrics to fit melodies, U2's songs can almost all be interpreted in a number of ways. While some are straightforward and obvious, others lend themselves to be looked at as simple love songs, tributes, or religious allegories. Many artists and rock bands are known for having hidden meanings scattered throughout their songs, and U2 is no exception.\n\nIn addition to their difficult song writing process, throw in lead singer Bono's habit of making up stories to fit song origins, and you have a band with numerous hidden meanings to their songs. From \"I Will Follow\" to \"Vertigo\" there's plenty to unpack when it comes to U2 songs and their song lyrics.\n\nThese U2 tracks all have hidden (or alternate) meanings, and might not mean exactly what you think they mean. Maybe you think you know what Bono, The Edge, Clayton, and Mullen are on about, but you might be surprised.\n\n1\n\nThe signature song on Achtung Baby, “One” was another track that emerged from the meandering Berlin sessions. Various interpretations of the lyrics include that the song is about a gay son coming out to his father, a failing relationship between two lovers who hurt each other in equal measure, Bono's own strained relationship with his father, or the promise brought on by a reunified Germany (“we’re one / but we’re not the same.”)\n\nBono himself has said there’s also an element of critiquing the “we’re all one” philosophy of Eastern religions.\n\nGood backstory?\n\nWhile inspired by the anti-Communist Solidarity movement in Poland, “New Year’s Day” actually began as a love song from Bono to his wife. But as they were recording, Bono had a mental picture of Lech Walesa, the leader of Solidarity, leading a workers strike on a snowy New Year's Day.\n\nSo the lyrics were rewritten on the fly and the track became much more political than personal. The mixture of the two meanings is still in evidence, judging by the sometimes glaring contrast in the lyrics between “gold is the reason for the wars we wage” and “I want to be with you night and day.”\n\nGood backstory?\n\n3\n\nThe first single off the band’s album How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb, “Vertigo” had a complicated origin. The melody started off as much heavier sound, with lyrics by Bono, inspired by Native American activist Leonard Peltier. But he didn’t feel comfortable singing them, so the song was rewritten at the last minute, with more general lyrics about the feeling of capitalism overtaking pure experience.\n\nAdditionally, Bono’s goofy Spanish countdown at the start of the song (“Uno, dos, tres, catorce” – which translates to “one, two, three, fourteen”) is thought to be a reference to Exodus 3:14, where God declares his name to be “I AM THAT WHICH I AM.” Bono has been more circumspect about this, saying of the countdown simply “there may have been some alcohol involved.”\n\nGood backstory?\n\n4\n\nPride (In the Name of Love)\n\nOne of U2’s most straightforward songs, “Pride” offers a clear parallel between the betrayal of Jesus and the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. What’s less well known is that Bono makes a pretty glaring historical mistake in the lyrics, singing “early morning / April 4th / shots ring out in the Memphis sky” when King was actually shot at about 6 pm.\n\nBono has acknowledged the error and now changes the lyric to “early evening” when the band performs the song live.\n\nGood backstory?\n\n5\n\nWhile Bono has explicitly stated the song was written as a tribute to then-imprisoned Burmese democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi, an alternative reading of the song makes it much more personal. In this interpretation, lyrics like “”The only baggage you can bring / Is all that you can't leave behind” and You're packing a suitcase for a place none of us has been / A place that has to be believed to be seen” are the singer giving a dying person permission to let go.\n\nIn this case, it reflects Bono’s father, who died shortly before the song was released. It's also possible for both meanings to be true, as is the case with many U2 songs.\n\nGood backstory?\n\n6\n\nGloria\n\nThe band’s 1981 hit came from their second album October, which was the most overtly religious of any they’ve done. The song “Gloria” reflects Bono’s spirituality, most especially in the Latin chorus. More hidden are the explicit Biblical references, working in lines from Colossians 2:9-10 (\"Only in You I'm complete\") and James 5:7-9 (\"The door is open / You're standing there\").\n\nConversely, Bono has claimed the song is about a female image of God – and is also a reference to the Van Morrison song of the same name.\n\nGood backstory?"
