        "text": "Green light, Seven Eleven\n\nYou stop in for a pack of cigarettes\n\nYou don′t smoke, don't even want to\n\nHey now, check your change\n\nDressed up like a car crash\n\nYour wheels are turning but you′re upside down\n\nYou say when he hits you, you don't mind\n\nBecause when he hurts you, you feel alive\n\nAll you now\n\nIs that what it is?\n\nRed light, gray morning\n\nYou stumble out of a hole in the ground\n\nA vampire or a victim\n\nIt depends on who's around\n\nYou used to stay in to watch the adverts\n\nYou could lip sync to the talk shows\n\nAnd if you look, you look through me\n\nAnd if you talk, it′s not to me\n\nAnd when I touch you, you don′t feel a thing\n\nIf I could stay\n\nThen the night would give you up\n\nStay and the day would keep its trust\n\nStay and the night would be enough\n\nFaraway, so close\n\nUp with the static and the radio waves\n\nWith satellite television\n\nYou can go anywhere\n\nMiami, New Orleans\n\nLondon, Belfast and Massachusetts\n\nAnd if you listen, I can't call\n\nAnd if you jump, you just might fall\n\nAnd if you shout, I′ll only hear you\n\nIf I could stay\n\nThen the night would give you up\n\nStay then the day would keep its trust\n\nStay with the demons you drowned\n\nStay with the spirit I found\n\nStay and the night would be enough\n\nThree o'clock in the morning\n\nIt′s quiet and there's no one around\n\nJust the bang and the clatter\n\nAs an angel runs to ground\n\nJust the bang and the clatter\n\nAs an angel hits the ground\n\nWriter(s): Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen, Dave Evans, Paul David Hewson<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
