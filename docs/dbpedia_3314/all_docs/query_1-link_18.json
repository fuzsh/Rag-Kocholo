        "text": "1993 single by U2\n\n\"Lemon\"Single by U2from the album Zooropa Released8 November 1993[1]RecordedMarch–May 1993Genre\n\nDisco\n\nalternative rock\n\nLength\n\n6:58 (album version)\n\n4:39 (edit)\n\nLabelIslandComposer(s)U2Lyricist(s)BonoProducer(s)\n\nFlood\n\nBrian Eno\n\nThe Edge\n\nU2 singles chronology\n\n\"Numb\"\n\n(1993) \"Lemon\"\n\n(1993) \"Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\"\n\n(1993)\n\nMusic video on YouTube\n\n\"Lemon\" is a song by Irish rock band U2. It is the fourth track on their eighth album, Zooropa (1993), and was released as its second single on 8 November 1993[1] by Island Records. Inspired by old video footage of lead vocalist Bono's late mother, the lyrics describe an attempt to preserve memory through film. More than any previous U2 song, \"Lemon\" showcases Bono's falsetto vocal range, aided by atmospheric backing vocals from the Edge and Brian Eno. Mark Neale directed the accompanying music video. At almost seven minutes, it is among the band's longest songs.\n\nThe single and promo releases were complete with different dance remixes, as well as a shortened edit of the title track. The \"Perfecto Mix\" by Paul Oakenfold and Steve Osborne was used on the PopMart Tour, being played as the band walked out of their Spinal Tap-like rock prop, a 40-foot mirrorball lemon, onto the B-stage for an encore, and was later reworked into \"Skin on Skin\" by Oakenfold's band Grace.\n\nRecording and composition\n\n[edit]\n\n\"Lemon\" was written late during the Zooropa sessions between March–May 1993 during the band's break in the Zoo TV Tour.[2] Guitarist the Edge said the song originated from something he \"worked up with a drum machine and bass, very rhythmic.\" He explained that he found it difficult to compose a guitar part to the song until he utilized an \"unusual gated guitar effect which worked with the rhythm.\"[2]\n\nLead vocalist Bono wrote the lyrics with his late mother in mind. He explains that it was a \"strange experience to receive, in the post, from a very distant relative, early Super 8 footage of my mother, aged 24, younger than me, playing a game of rounders in slow motion.\"[2] The footage showed Bono's mother at a wedding as the maid of honour, wearing a lemon-coloured dress.[2] The film footage inspired Bono to write lyrics about using film to recreate and preserve memory.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic called the song a wonderful moment from the album, describing it as \"space-age German disco\".[3] Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Jittery, danceable moment from the yummy Zooropa collection is yet another step away from standard U2 fare. This time, Bono dabbles in sunny pop/soul, wrapping a luscious falsetto around an infectious hook and funk-fortified rhythm base. In its original form, track will be a joy for top 40 programmers. Inspired remixes by Robbie Adams and David Morales will open doors at crossover radio and in clubs.\"[4] Troy J. Augusto from Cash Box named \"Lemon\" Pick of the Week, stating that here, the band \"continues to push the envelope, adding yet another style twist to its catalog.\" He added, \"Bouncy and quite danceable cut, which follows the desensitizing \"Numb\" single, starts with a funky groove and augments with powerful and fun vocals from Bono and one of the strongest hooks the band has unleashed in quite some time.\"[5]\n\nPeter Paphides from Melody Maker wrote, \"Similar in sentiment to \"Mysterious Ways\", yet as otherwordly as U2 have ever dared to be, \"Lemon\" sounds like it was recorded in a padded cell, saturating the senses like some abstract European road movie. When Bono sings, \"Midnight is where the day begins\", over a harsh electronic funk groove, you're struck by images of a semi-mythical Europe, of speeding past neon-lit landscapes on deserted Autobahns.\"[6] Alan Jones from Music Week noted that it finds the singer \"adopting a Jagger-like falsetto over a bouncy but sparse track that could lend itself to a dance remix.\"[7] Stephen Dalton from NME felt Bono's falsetto croon on the \"sleek disco cruiser\" slips \"from Bowie parody into understated New Order melancholy.\"[8] Parry Gettelman from Orlando Sentinel viewed it as a \"fast number\" and \"strictly for the polite Eurodisco crowd.\"[9]\n\nMusic video\n\n[edit]\n\nThe accompanying music video for \"Lemon\", directed by British documentarian and film director Mark Neale, was filmed in black and white with a grid-like background as a tribute to Eadweard Muybridge.[10] Muybridge was a photographer who was the first person to successfully capture fast motion on film, using his device, coincidentally named the Zoopraxiscope, a reference to the lyrics (\"A man makes a picture – a moving picture/Through light projected he can see himself up close\"). The video primarily features a sequence of clips of the band members playing their instruments and performing a series of distinct actions, with captions for each one (e.g. \"man walking up incline\", \"man running\", \"man playing pool\"). In the background of the video, a pendulum is swinging, a clock is ticking, as well as dollars falling from the sky, various scientific objects (DNA, satellite feeds, etc.), and a cross. All of these symbols seem to be representing man's attempt to preserve time, via money (\"He turns his money into light to look for her\"), religion, or technology. The video also featured Bono dressed as both \"The Fly\" and \"MacPhisto\".\n\nLive performances\n\n[edit]\n\nThe song was played live at 10 different Zoo TV Tour shows in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, during the show's encore. During each performance, Bono would perform the song dressed as Zoo TV character \"MacPhisto,\" a former cabaret performer with devilish horns. Each performance was immediately followed by the band's \"With or Without You\".[11] As with most of Zooropa’s material, \"Lemon\" has never been performed live by U2 since the close of the Zoo TV tour.[12]\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\nUK 12-inch\n\n\"Lemon\" (Bad Yard club mix) – 8:47\n\n\"Lemon\" (Momo Beats) – 4:34\n\n\"Lemon\" (Version dub) – 6:46\n\n\"Lemon\" (Serious Def dub) – 6:42\n\nCD single\n\n\"Lemon\" (edit) – 4:42\n\n\"Lemon\" (Oakenfold Jeep mix) – 5:32\n\n\"Lemon\" (album version) – 6:58\n\n\"Lemon\" (Morales BYC version dub) – 6:36\n\nRemixes\n\n[edit]\n\nNote: The \"Bad Yard Club Mix\" has differing durations depending on the release.
