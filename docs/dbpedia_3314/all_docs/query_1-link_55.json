        "text": "Berlin doesn’t exactly struggle for fans; however, for the uninitiated, music can be the route to the soul. Here we’ve found seven songs guaranteed to make you fall in love with Berlin. Now, you’d be forgiven for thinking that this would be a list of techno and minimal electro hits, but you’d be wrong; what follows is a list of popular artists tapping into the Berlin soul.\n\nLilly Wood & The Prick and Robin Schulz – “Prayer in C (Robin Schulz Remix)”\n\nOriginally released on the album Invincible Friends by French–Israeli folk-pop duo Lilly Wood and The Prick, their hit, “Prayer in C” only gained international attention and recognition when it was remixed by popular German DJ Robin Schultz. The video is a modern ode to the wild and carefree lifestyle of many young people in Berlin today. Colorful faces, wild youth, and confetti juxtaposed with the old buildings and sights perfectly encapsulates the entire city’s fun and vibrant way of life.\n\nMark Owen – “Stars”\n\nMark Owen’s music video for “Stars,” directed by James Slater, paints a slightly different picture of the city, opting for the more unique spots around town, like the popularly photographed abandoned theme park known as Spreepark. The video follows Owen as he walks around in Berlin malls, a supermarket, and club in an astronaut suit before eventually returning home to his similarly clothed family.\n\nAsaf Avidan – “One day/Reckoning Song (Wankelmut Remix)”\n\nLike “Prayer in C,” Wankelmut’s remix of “One day/Reckoning Song” captures the wild and carefree Berlin of the bar hoppers and early morning club bunnies. The video follows a group of 20-something friends as they make their way through Friedrichshain for a crazy and intense night of partying. Keep an eye out for the Warschauer Brücke, which seems to be a popular location for most videos.\n\nMarteria, Yasha & Miss Platnum – “Lila Wolken”\n\nGerman rapper Marteria joined forces with fellow German artists Yasha and Miss Platnum for an epic song with an even wilder music video. The clip once again shows Berlin’s wild side and switches locations to show sweeping views of the city and its colorful parks, buildings, and shops. Also, it’s worth noting that Marteria is no stranger to Berlin, as the video for one of his biggest hits, “Kids (2 Finger An Den Kopf),” was also shot in the capital city.\n\nAlanis Morissette – “Guardian”\n\nWhereas many others on this list have chosen to focus on the wild and young, devil-may-care attitude that has become synonymous with Berlin today, Alanis Morissette went in a different direction. The Canadian–American artist chose to feature the city in greyscale. Shots of the skyline and people on the streets set the backdrop to the dramatic and heartfelt lyrics and music in the song.\n\nU2 – “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zDvUM4lWXA\n\nThe song “Stay (Faraway, So Close!)” was the fifth track on their 1993 album, Zooropa. Members of the band have reportedly claimed the song to be one of their favorite songs and best creations ever. The music video was filmed in Berlin primarily in black and white over the course of three days. The song was completed for Wim Wenders’ film by the same name and contains cameos from several actors in the movie as well as multiple clips. The members of U2 are cast in the video as the band’s guardian angels.\n\nSee privacy policy.\n\nAndreas Bourani – “Auf uns”\n\nAndreas Bourani’s video for “Auf uns,” directed by Kim Frank, portrays Berlin the way Berliners see it. His video shows the city from the point of view of its citizens, both young and old, and their everyday lives, from supermarket shopping to family birthday celebrations, kids hanging around after school and the busy work commute. If you’re looking for perhaps the most true-to-form portrayal of the city, this is the video to watch."
