        "text": "U2 have announced a new album for 2023, and it’s going to be a very different LP from their previous releases.\n\nDue out March 17 is Songs of Surrender, which is being dubbed as a “re-imagined album.” The trailer for the album can be viewed below, and it’s captioned, in part, “40 Songs. Reimagined and rerecorded.”\n\nFew details besides the album title and release date are known. However, it appears the album will be a companion project to Bono’s recently released memoir Surrender: 40 Songs, One Story. The book’s 40 chapters are named after 40 different U2 songs. Among them are “Beautiful Day,” and the rerecorded version of that track can be heard in the trailer. It would be safe to assume the 40 songs/chapters in Bono’s memoir are the tracklisting for Songs of Surrender. Those songs/chapters are as follows:\n\n“Lights of Home”\n\n“Out of Control”\n\n“Iris (Hold Me Close)”\n\n“Cedarwood Road”\n\n“Stories for Boys”\n\n“Song for Someone”\n\n“I Will Follow”\n\n“11 O’Clock Tick Tock”\n\n“Invisible”\n\n“October”\n\n“Two Hearts Beat as One”\n\n“Sunday Bloody Sunday”\n\n“Bad”\n\n“Bullet the Blue Sky”\n\n“Where the Streets Have No Name”\n\n“With or Without You”\n\n“Desire”\n\n“Who’s Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses”\n\n“Until the End of the World”\n\n“One”\n\n“The Fly”\n\n“Even Better Than the Real Thing”\n\n“Mysterious Ways”\n\n“Stuck in a Moment”\n\n“Wake Up Dead Man”\n\n“The Showman”\n\n“Pride (In the Name of Love)”\n\n“Beautiful Day”\n\n“Crumbs from Your Table”\n\n“Miracle Drug”\n\n“Vertigo”\n\n“Ordinary Love”\n\n“City of Blinding Lights”\n\n“Get Out of Your Own Way”\n\n“Every Breaking Wave”\n\n“I Still Haven’t Found What I’m Looking For”\n\n“Love is Bigger Than Anything in Its Way”\n\n“Moment of Surrender”\n\n“Landlady”\n\n“Breathe”\n\nAnother thing that is up in the air is whether or not this new release will be accompanied by a tour. If there is a tour, it might be without drummer Larry Mullen Jr. In a feature piece, The Washington Post revealed, ” … if the band plays live in 2023 it will probably be without him, as he needs surgery to continue playing.”\n\nU2: Their 50 Best Songs, Ranked\n\nErica Banas is a news blogger who's been covering the rock/classic rock world since 2014.
