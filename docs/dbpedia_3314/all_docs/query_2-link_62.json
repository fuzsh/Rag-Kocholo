        "text": "U2: a punchline for a couple of decades now, reviled for their singer’s messianism and (more pertinently) tax affairs. And truth to tell, never favourites of mine. I always preferred Michael Stipe’s enigmatic mumbling to Bono’s chest-beating. But you don’t get to their level of success without writing a good song or two along the way. Here’s a piece about one of their best.\n\nNot every band that has a good year or two can turn that into sustained success, in which they plough on for a two or three decades, outlasting all challengers while the music scene changes endlessly around them.\n\nIt’s really hard. Even U2 – who did put it off – had their difficulties for a few years in the mid-1990s.\n\nOver the course of their career, it’s probably fair to say U2 have been more of a people’s band than a critic’s darling, but for a few years at their peak they managed to pump out records that were both critical hits and wildly popular with the public – chief among them 1987’s The Joshua Tree and 1991’s Achtung Baby. When the band released the latter, punters fell hard for One, Even Better than the Real Thing, and Mysterious Ways*, while critics responded positively to the band’s embrace of irony and European-style Po-Mo. After Rattle and Hum, on which Bono’s fetishising of all things American and rootsy and “authentic” had run out of control, Achtung Baby‘s hyperreality and gleeful inauthenticity was the absolute best way to repair their dented critical rep.\n\nThe band’s Zoo TV tour continued this new obsession with spectacle and knowing self-parody. The shows were elaborately staged to satirise television and media oversaturation. Bono made prank phone calls to local and national politicians. Giant screens showed constantly shifting images: video confessionals, a belly dancer and live satellite footage from Sarajevo, then under siege.\n\nConceptual and arty and maybe a little pretentious? Sure, but U2 leavened it with a level of self-deprecation they’d seldom seemed capable of up till that point. Bono played down his rock ‘n’ roll messiah act to portray a literal devil instead, singing a portion of the set in character as “MacPhisto”, complete with devil horns and a gold lamé suit, possibly borrowed from ABC’s Martin Fry.\n\nZooropa, the 1993 follow-up album to Achtung Baby, played with thematically similar material to its predecessor and the Zoo TV tour. But despite this, it was received more coolly by the public, selling only half as many copies as Achtung Baby. In hindsight, it set the stage for 1997’s even more disappointing Pop, which saw U2 encase their music within so many quotation marks it was hard to know how to take them or their songs. After which, the band dropped the flirtation with irony, costume and surface, and went back to foregrounding reliable old passion and authenticity (cue Beautiful Day, and their best sales figures in 10 years).\n\nA shame, as Zooropa at least still contained good music. In fact, Stay (Faraway, So Close) – written for Frank Sinatra, and featuring in the Wim Wenders movie Faraway, So Close! – may just be the band’s best song. It’s certainly in the conversation, and it definitely has one of Bono’s best lyrics. He’s not a lyricist I’ve ever cared for particularly, but I remember being really struck by the line “a vampire or a victim, it depends on who’s around” when I first heard the song in 1993; it sounded very adult and complex that a person could be neither a goodie nor a baddie, but sometimes one thing and sometimes the other. The best part of 30 years on, I still think it’s a good line. As I got older, I found other lines well observed too, particularly: “Dressed up like a car crash, your wheels are turning but you’re upside down”. We’ve all, I’m sure, seen people go through rough periods when they insist they’re absolutely fine, but everything they do seems like a cry for help they’re unaware of.\n\nThat’s what’s great about Stay (Faraway, So Close). For all that he’s spent the bulk of his career dealing in grand gestures, Bono is good – perhaps better – when he’s working at a small scale and not reaching for the cheap seats.** In 1993, they felt brave enough to write a small song, keep it (fairly) small in recording and arrangement, and then release it as a single. But the relative failure of their Zooropa singles set the stage for a few years of declining sales and relevance. Few bands reascend to the top of the heap after losing their way like that; I don’t think it’s been done since.\n\n*The first single from Achtung Baby, The Fly, was a huge hit in Europe, but stalled at 61 in the US. Possibly the American audience didn’t see the need for a U2 that sounded like Jesus Jones fronted by a chipmunk on helium. The American audience got that one right.\n\n** Another U2 song I’ll go into bat for is The Joshua Tree‘s stark Running to Stand Still, for the same reasons that I like Stay (Faraway So Close).\n\nHappy Easter, one and all!\n\nIn 1995, Emmylou Harris released an album called Wrecking Ball. At the time it was understood by fans and critics as an attempt by Harris to position herself a step or two away from mainstream Nashville country. The Nashville machine had long seemed venal and conservative, but was now entering an even grimmer phase, of which the success of Shania Twain’s Mutt Lange-produced The Woman in Me (eight singles released, 12 million units sold) and Come On Over (12 singles released 17.5 million units sold) may be taken as emblematic. Mainstream Nashville may have its fans among poptimist critics today – many of whom will, in fairness, acknowledge the debt it currently owes to 1970s West Coast rock and 1980s hair-metal ballads – but in 1995 no one with working ears could have argued for the artistic health of contemporary pop country.\n\nHarris hired Daniel Lanois (best known at the time for his work with U2 and Peter Gabriel) and crafted a record with a distinctive aural personality. If Wrecking Ball continues to be judged an important album beyond the immediate context of Harris’s career, the sound of it will be the reason why – it’s still spawning imitators 19 years on.\n\nDeep bass, drums (or drum loops) that abandon the country shuffle and side-stick for a funk- and/or hip-hop-derived emphasis on backbeat placement, washy synth/organ pads, heavily delayed guitars, heavily echoed everything – add all these up and you get an arrangement and production mindset that seeks to present the song as having been recorded live all together in a confined space, mushing everything up and avoiding clarity with heavily modulated time-domain effects. Not everyone likes it (Christgau called it ‘Lanois’s one seductive trick: to gauze over every aural detail and call your soft focus soul’, in a sniffy review of Wrecking Ball; he’d be even less convinced by Red Dirt Girl in 2000), but when done well it acts as a nice corrective to the sheeny, treble-boosted, hyper-real norm of modern music production.\n\nIf Wrecking Ball was the originator of this particular thing – veteran-artist soundscape rock, we might call it, or ‘the Lanois thing’ for shorter shorthand – Bob Dylan’s Time out of Mind (another Lanois production, his second Dylan record after Oh Mercy) was the album that turned it into a virtual genre of its own. Perhaps Time out of Mind has been somewhat overvalued but it is undeniably a fine achievement. It had been some years since Dylan had written anything that spoke so loudly to the small of the back as Not Dark Yet. He hasn’t done it again since. He certainly hasn’t made my head bob up and down like he does on Can’t Wait (thank you, Brian Blade and Jim Keltner).\n\nDylan didn’t enjoy the process and has self-produced since, but the Lanois thing had now solidified into an aesthetic that others might copy and emulate. He did it again on Willie Nelson’s Teatro did it in a slightly drier fashion and T-Bone Burnett has been doing it whenever possible – sometimes with Sam Phillips, sometimes with Ollabelle (see, for instance, John the Revelator) but most notably with Alison Krauss and Robert Plant, whose Raising Sand brought this sound to daytime radio, primetime TV and a level of industry recognition even Time out of Mind didn’t manage (five Grammys to TooM’s three, number two in both the UK and US album charts and platinum-level sales in both countries). Burnett may only have one production idea, an idea borrowed from someone else, but you can’t deny it’s been successful for him.\n\nAoife O’Donovan is the latest artist to adopt this sound.\n\nO’Donovan sang in a group called Crooked Still, a progressive bluegrass band from Boston. Progressive in this instance means banjo picking at absolutely furious tempos and the addition of a cellist. This is not, being truthful, my thing; I remain immune to the charms of the banjo. But O’Donovan has a lovely voice and reading several raves of her latest album Fossils, which came out in the autumn of last year, convinced me to give it a listen. That it was produced by Tucker Martine, whose work (particularly his drum sounds) with his wife Laura Veirs I’ve enjoyed, was just an added inducement. Martine adds more of a rock sensibility than O’Donovan’s had before – the drums are mixed pretty high on, say, Beekeeper, and Robin MacMillan’s tom-toms mean business – but without a constant fiddle or banjo accompaniment to share space with her vocal melodies, the focus remains on her. In a good way.\n\nThe album leans very heavily at times on the Lanois/Raising Sand thing, most particularly on album highlight Glowing Heart. Yet an idea, executed well, needn’t be original to be effective, compelling, moving – and Glowing Heart is all of these things. Haloed by shimmering, delay-modulated guitars and two hard-panned strummed acoustics, O’Donovan’s gorgeous piece of widescreen melancholia – a song of vast spaces and endless night-time sky – is illuminated by touches of pedal steel (again, with heavy reverb and delay), double bass, drums (playing occasional interjections on snare and toms rather than fulfilling a timekeeping role) and, unexpectedly entering halfway through, fiddle. It’s a fantastic arrangement, weightless and graceful, a reminder that there is still room in the Lanois thing for imagination and invention.\n\nAoife O’Donovan (it’s pronounced ‘Ee-fuh’)\n\nIn my office, the nineties never ended. The radio’s on almost all of the time. Most of the time it’s tuned to a certain station that plays mainly rock music from the last twenty-five years, with a sprinkling of other, non-rock, things, which always sound very strange by comparison – Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s Relax sounds positively avant-garde in the context of endless Stereophonics and U2 and Kings of Leon.\n\nMost of this rock music is, in the end, polite. Even the fiercer-sounding bands (Nirvana, say) are somewhat neutered in this context; the huge wall of guitars of the majority of nineties rock being less likely to jump out of the speakers as something spindly and angular, the music ends up sounding somewhat samey.\n\nBut now and again a song does poke its head up and demand to be heard by virtue of sounding different. Such a song, which I’ve only heard a couple of times on this station since starting in this job four months ago but which has been a delight on each occasion, is She Said by the Longpigs.\n\nThe ambition held by Longpigs frontman Crispin Hunt in 1996, it seemed, was to have a band that sounded as much as possible like Radiohead, with whom the Longpigs toured in 1995. In the context of their later work, Radiohead’s The Bends sounds like a conventional mid-nineties rock record, but it’s worth remembering that no one else at the time was ploughing quite the same furrow as them. Yes, you could hear debts to R.E.M., to U2, to Nirvana, to Jeff Buckley, and going back further, to Magazine* and to David Bowie, but it added up to a sound that was the band’s own, which is why it was notable how much the Longpigs’ sound owed to The Bends. Vocals that jumped suddenly up an octave? Yep. Squalling, trebly Fenders? A general sense of over-caffeinated nerviness? Songs that were anthemic, bombastic and over the top, but still managed to sound genuine and personal? Yep, yep and yep.\n\nBut despite being somewhat derivative, Longpigs made a couple of great records in their short career, and She Said is the pick of them. What’s so great about it is its lack of restraint. Hunt, sounding more than a little unhinged, yelps and screams his way through the song while the band clatter along behind him, drummer Dee Boyle’s performance being particularly inspired. I love his playing during the bridge, just before the stop, and in the last chorus and coda – it’s not showy, it’s not spectacular, but he sounds fully inside the song and he sounds like he’s having a lot of fun. With the success of Travis and Coldplay, this kind of messy abandon would disappear from British indie rock within a few years.\n\nThe second Longpigs album flopped, and flopped hard. Nothing more was heard of them as a band. But the cultural reach of the band’s members is surprisingly long. Of course, the most famous former Longpig is guitarist Richard Hawley, who went on to a spell in Pulp (replacing Russell Senior), before releasing records under his own name, which are pleasant, if sometimes in need of a dose of whatever Crispin Hunt was taking in 1996. Bass player Simon Stafford has played with Joe Strummer and Jarvis Cocker. But Hunt has perhaps the most intriguing post-Longpigs story: he’s now a behind-the-scenes guy, co-writing with or producing Jake Bugg, Florence + the Machine, Newton Faulkner, Cee-Lo Green, Ellie Goulding, Natalie Imbruglia, Fighting with Wire, Ron Sexsmith, even Mark Owen.\n\n*Longpigs could, however, claim their own post-punk influences that didn’t come through Radiohead: drummer Dee Boyle was a former member of Cabaret Voltaire"
