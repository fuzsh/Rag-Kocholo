        "text": "The tracks U2 released ahead of Songs Of Surrender had me absolutely dreading this release. Bono has tweaked lyrics and none of the tweaked lyrics are an improvement. Most of the songs appeared to just be slowtempo versions of classic bangers with all the life strangled out of them.\n\nI gave the forty-track album a full listen through, and then looked online to see what songs the band had selected for the sixteen and twenty track releases, and realized that my goal from putting together this reimagined album was much different from their idea of what their best material was.\n\nFor me, I chose the songs that were different from any previous versions. Ones that were rearranged for Bono's current range, and didn't pervert the original lyrics too much. Songs that I could see myself listening to on their own merit, not just because they were familiar songs.\n\nStill, it's best not to listen to this as a studio album, but as a live soundboard recording where they've managed to completely erase the sound of the audience. Maybe a Zoom concert? Something more akin to the Remixes For Propaganda bootlegs than something that needed a mainstream release.\n\nThe songs range all the way from Boy to Songs Of Experience. There are a few albums not represented, as there weren't any songs from October or No Line On The Horizon on the forty track album. On the flip side, there were plenty of songs from Achtung Baby and Songs Of Innocence, they just all sucked.\n\nBelow is the track listing for the fourteen tracks out of forty that I enjoyed. Below that is a review of each of the forty songs from the Deluxe Release that came out today. I would neither waste my money on the forty track version, nor would I bother either of the sixteen or twenty track versions, as I believe the band completely whiffed on this concept. They should have been trying to please fans by putting out alternate takes to less well-known tracks, which may have also drawn in new fans, or won over some of the many justified U2 haters. Instead, they decided to release an album that could be called What If Our Greatest Hits Sucked?\n\n1. Red Hill Mining Town (from The Joshua Tree)\n\n2. Miracle Drug (from How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb)\n\n3. Dirty Day (from Zooropa)\n\n4. Stories For Boys (from Boy, featuring The Edge on vocals)\n\n5. Two Hearts Beat As One (from War)\n\n6. Lights Of Home (from Songs Of Experience)\n\n7. If God Would Send His Angels (from Pop)\n\n8. 11 O'Clock Tick Tick (unreleased track)\n\n9. The Little Things That Give You Away (\n\n10. Sunday Bloody Sunday\n\n11. Out Of Control\n\n​12. Bad\n\n13. Peace On Earth\n\n​14. All I Want Is You\n\nMy review of the forty track Songs Of Surrender, after listening through it a couple of times:\n\n1. One\n\n​\n\nWhile I vastly prefer almost every other version of this song I've heard, be it a live version, the Mary J Blige collaboration, the original, Damien Rice's mournful crooning cover, Johnny Cash's raspy interpretation, Melissa Etheridge's one woman loop band cover during the pandemic, the music in this version isn't really the problem. Yes, Edge's background vocals of love is a temple, love is a higher law are a hokey distraction near the end of the song. The real problem, though, is Bono's vocals. People age. When they age, their range changes. I remember a friend went and saw U2 twenty years ago, and even then he mentioned that they had to do a medley of some of The Unforgettable Fire songs because Bono couldn't hit those notes anymore. That's going to happen to singers. So you change keys, you write new music or find appropriate covers that fit your range. But why would you rerecord one of your best songs with noticeably poorer vocals. Cracks in the foundation of your larynx. Warbling around the key, like you're not sure what fits the melody's lock. This is a dooming intro to an album of reimagined hits. It's at least a better version than the one REM and U2 did for MTV in 1993.\n\n2. Where The Streets Have No Name\n\n​\n\nThe original version of this song has such an iconic opening, that, honestly you have to swing for the fences when you reinterperet it. I think Edge did a solid job of arranging this song to fit the vibe of New Age Soft Rock For Boomers. It's not an improvement over the original by any stretch, but it's a solid alternative. Bono's vocals even work for this track. Unfortunately, Bono has decided to rewrite the lyrics to this song so it's specifically about a desert, like he really really wants you to know it's about a desert so he says desert repeatedly. And he's even changed other lyrics for no valid reason. And while Bono in 2023 isn't quite the singer he was in 1987, he's a much worse songwriter. If these were the lyrics to the song in 1987, even if it was matched up with the tempo and arrangement of the original track, this would not be anyone's favorite U2 song. Not even The Joshua Tree National Park Desert Preservation Society. I will say that Bono's croony oooooooos near the end were a wise choice, given his current vocal limitations.\n\n​3. Stories For Boys\n\nThe Edge is the spotlight on this arrangement of one of U2's earliest tracks. He provides vocals, and plays piano. This is the first track that I actually like on this album. Is it better than the original? Maybe. It's certainly a valid reinterpretation. It's definitely an Old Man Looks Back On His Youth song, as opposed to the I Just Graduated From High School And I'm All Grown Up/Too Early For Nostalgia song that was the original. It works really well.\n\n4. 11 O'Clock Tick Tock\n\nAnother interesting alternative to the original/live tracks I've heard. The updated lyrics don't bother me much. I thought I was annoyed that he changed the ethereal bridge lyrics to sad song, sad song but it turns out those are the original lyrics, they were just so mumbly in the original, I didn't realize they were actual words. I will go on the record as saying this version, with Edge's Latin American inspired guitar near the end, is actually a vast improvement over the original.\n\n5. Out Of Control\n\nWhen I wrote the reimagined version of Boy and October (my version os Boytober), I mentioned that the lyrics to this song about turning eighteen were some of U2's worst. The arrangement wasn't much better. But, again, it was very early U2. They were still teenagers. This version is the second song in a row that I would say is an actual improvement over the original. It sounds like a B-Side from How To Assemble An Atomic Bomb. If that sounds like feint praise, it is. I like this updated version more than the original, but it's never been one of their best songs. And Bono using his aged Picard whispy voice to sing about how he's out of control is just silly and doesn't really work.\n\n6. Beautiful Day\n\nDid we need this piano-forward reinterpretation of the lead single from All That You Can't Leave Behind? Sigh. Yes. While I prefer the original, I'm not sure if that would be true if I heard this version first. I think it's a case of enjoying what I'm already used to. That said, there is an unnecessary lyrical change in the second verse where Bono seems to be updating, not \"Beautiful Day\" but the Passenger's Soundtrack ​cut \"Your Blue Room\", which is an interesting choice. But not a better choice. The original lyrics were better. Still, this isn't as bad or unnecessary as I feared.\n\n7. Bad\n\nIf this were a live album by latter-day U2, this would be the breakout hit. It's set in Bono's current range. It's pretty much just an acoustic version of the original except. Except. Except the lyrics are updated. And, again, Bono is not a better songwriter in 2023 than he was in 1984. But, even though this one of my favorite early U2 tracks, I don't Hate the changes. They're just okay. Against all my expectations, this is a perfectly fine alternative version to the original. I would voluntarily listen to this. It's still a banger.\n\n8. Every Breaking Wave\n\nWhen I did my reimagined version of Songs Of Innocence and Songs Of Experience, this song didn't make the cut. This one won't make the cut, either. Like the previous track, it just feels like an acoustic, live version of the original. In this case, it's Bono singing while Edge plays piano, and there are no other instruments. But they've made it sound like it was recorded in a space with vaulted ceilings so we get a nice echoey vibe for both the vocals and the piano. It would be a fine closer to a later-day U2 album. It's just never going to be my favorite track.\n\n​9. Walk On\n\nNope. This was never U2's strongest song. It got extra attention paid to it because it was an uplifting song that was released during 2001, and was therefore wrongly co-opted as a response to 9-11. Woof. Now, however, Bono has rewritten it. Not because of the 9-11 issue, but because the original was banned in Burma, as it was about an ousted democratic leader there. The new version is about The Ukraine, and the lyrics are terrible. This is a real Elton John rerecords \"Candle In The Wind\" moment. Only worse because the original wasn't very good to begin with. Changing home/that's where the heart is to home/that's where the hurt is is a strong contender for valid reasons to use the barf emoji.\n\n​10. Pride (In The Name Of Love)\n\nThis was the first song I heard from the new album, and one of the reasons I was convinced this whole project was going to be terrible. If you drain all the passion and power out of the original version of this song, the tepid elevator music version of this song would be better than this soulless, poorly produced lullaby. They should have either left this song alone, or come up with a better idea for rerecording it.\n\n11. Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\n\nI've heard that U2 actually hates the original version of this song from Achtung Baby. I've always quite liked it. Both the original, and the Temple Bar Remix from the single's B-Side. This updated recording is unnecessary but inoffensive. It's barely discernable from the Temple Bar Remix, apart from worse background vocals and the feeling that most of this album has, that it's just a watered down, live acoustic version from an aging band.\n\n​12. Get Out Of Your Own Way\n\nAnother song from either Songs Of Experience or Songs Of Innocence that I didn't think was good enough to make my reimagined album, Sometimes. And, again, this version wouldn't make an album, either. While it is nice to hear drums for what feels like the first time on this album, the lyrics are not just badly written, they're flatly delivered. If Bono doesn't care about this song, why should I? Get out of your own way, Bono, and let this song be forgotten.\n\n13. Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of\n\nAnother All That You Can't Leave Behind song that got wrapped up in the post 9-11 fervor. This was on heavy repeat on MTV during the weeks after the tragedy. I like it more than \"Walk On\". And this version, like \"Bad\", falls into the Perfectly Acceptable Acoustic Live Version category. The bongos might be a bit much, but *shrug emoji*.\n\n14. Red Hill Mining Town\n\nThe original version of this song had a really unique sound that worked with The Joshua Tree, and yet felt jarring, with Edge's guitar squeak. This version serves as a tribute to that, as it's much meatier than an other song on this album. It's more marching band than acoustic show. I like it. Bono's voice even sounds stronger here than on the earlier tracks.\n\n15. Ordinary Love\n\nWhen the original track, dedicated to Nelson Mandela came out, and Google had it categorized as Reggae I laughed someone else's ass off (I need mine, and am protective of it). It's never been reggae. This has never been an interesting song, either, and I actually fell asleep listening to it this morning. I legitimately dreamed I was texting someone about how boring this song was, and woke up and started searching for the text.\n\n16. Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\n\nThis was my surprise favorite song from How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. Sure, I like \"Vertigo\" and \"City Of Blinding Lights\" just fine, but there was a real raw honesty to the original version of this song that's often absent from twenty-first century U2. This piano ballad version just sucks all of the intensity out of the original, and leaves a treacly melodramatic breathathon in its place. The new version of Can you hear me when I sing / You're the reason I sing / You're the reason why the opera is in me makes me viscerally angry. It's such an affront to the original take. It's between this and \"One\" for What's My Least Favorite Song On This Album.\n\n17. Invisible\n\nLike \"An Ordinary Love\", I didn't immediately recognize what song this was, as I just never really listened to the original very often. It's like the song was so focused on the theme of \"Invisible\" that I can't even remember it unless I'm actually listening to it.\n\n18. Dirty Day\n\nThis Zooropa song was a low-key bop on the original album, but when U2 released the Junk Day mix on the B-Side of \"Please\", I fell instantly in love. This version seems truer to the Junk Day Mix than the original, with bass accompimamet, then adds in percussion and strings. It's Very Sleep Inducing but, unlike, \"Ordinary Love\", it's not bad. It's just deliberately slow.\n\n19. The Miracle (Of Joey Ramone)\n\nZzzzzzzZZZZZZzzzzzZZZZZZZZzzzzz. Huh? I woke up and this song was on. Another song from Songs Of Innocence or Songs Of Experience that I didn't like originally when I was combining them into Sometimes. I dont t'hink this version is an improvement, but I'm not inspired to go back and check out the original, either.\n\n20. City Of Blinding Lights\n\nAnother unnecessary track. This is just a pared-down version of the How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb track but with weaker vocals. It would be an acceptable track for a live, acoustic show, but it's nothing special and certainly several steps down from the original cut.\n\n21. Vertigo\n\nThe intro to this song hints at a wildly different version of the song before the guitar kicks in, and it's just another stripped down song with Bono toning down the power behind his vocals. There are verious interesting instrumentals popped in to the sections without vocals, but then the band seems to agree that Bono's vocals couldn't shine through them.\n\n22. I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\n\nThere are already two popular and well-loved versions of this song. The original The Joshua Tree version, and the incredible, gospel choir backed version from Rattle & Hum. If there is a third, defining version of this song, it's not the one on this album, which boasts a mediocre, low-pitched karaoke level performance with hints of the classic instrumentation buried under soft rock production.\n\n​23. Electrical Storm\n\nSimilarly, there are already two versions of this song floating around, neither of them as well-loved as the previous track. One of the two new songs on Best Of 1990-2000, there's a lush ballad feel to the William Orbital mix. The producer of Madonna's Ray Of Light making a B-side level song into an interesting bop. The regular version just felt boring, and poorly arranged in comparison. This feels like a slight, and only slight, reworking of that inferior version. It takes longer than either previous version to amp up the emotion. It gets slightly interesting just as it begins to fade out, again when Bono doesn't have any lyrics.\n\n24. The Fly\n\nThere's a \"Lounge Mix\" version of this Achtung Baby track on the single. Yea, \"The Fly\" was the lead single for Achtung Baby. While I love the song, it's hardly the best song on the album. I like combining the original and the \"Lounge Mix\" into a sonically interesting mix. This new version had me for a bit at the beginning, but once Edge's background vocals kick in, it's downhill for a bit. It picks back up near the end, making this track ok but not a viable alternative to the previous versions.\n\n25. If God Would Send His Angels\n\nOne of my favorite tracks off of Pop, boasts a fun, over-produced stomping \"Big Yam Mix\" as a B-side alternate take of the song. That's the version I put on my reimagined album, Popmart, as the real problem with U2's Pop is that it only sort of embraced dance music. The B-side mixes went All In, and in most cases, are the superior versions. This new version is, quel surprise, a stripped down piano ballad. It works better for this track than most of the others on this album. Even Bono's weaksauce falsetto about halfway through work in this song's favor. I don't think this is nearly as strong as The Big Yam Mix, but it might be better than the original version from Pop. Pushing the Where do we go lyric even deeper into the mix than it is in either previous version makes sense. And while I don't love The Edge's background arrangement on this version, they're hardly terrible.\n\n26. Desire\n\nBono is not, and never will be, Prince. He certainly loves what he sometimes calls his falsetto soul voice. It's on full force on this reimagining of \"Desire\", and it's a terrible choice. This is a screamer of a song, not a cartoon internet meme from the late 90s. The vocals are incredibly incongruous with the heavy instrumentation. It just doesn't work. I applaud the big swing they took here, but they should have listened to the track and redone the vocals with Bono's gravelly old man voice.\n\n27. Until The End Of The World\n\nI used to love this Achtung Baby cut, but then I heard Patti Smith'e version on Ahk-Toong-Bay-Bi and it was such a better, more powerful version that I found the original rather silly. And this new version is pretty much just the acoustic version of the original, which wasn't heavily electronic. And, again, Bono does a verse in his falsetto, which is difficult to parse and not particularly fun to listen to.\n\n28. Song For Someone\n\nNo, thank you. There are two versions of this song between Songs Of Experience and Songs Of Innocence. One is called \"Song For Someone\", the other is called \"There Is A Light\". Neither are bad songs but the world didn't need both. My reimagined album, Sometimes has pieces of these songs as a medley about lightness and darkness, which permeates Experience and Innocence. It's overly long, and threatened to put me back to sleep.\n\n29. All I Want Is You\n\nA seemingly music-box-inspired of this Rattle & Hum classic is another sucessful lullibyification. It almost begs for sing-along vocals (though I'm glad The Edge doesn't provide them). The sweeping build halfway through is undercut a little by Bono's completely unnecessary Yea! Yea! Yea!s but the song quickly recovers.\n\n30. Peace On Earth\n\nI'm not much of a fan of the original, which appears on All That You Can't Leave Behind. This version, which seems to be just The Edge, singing and playing guitar like some sort of hippie summer camp counselor, before some synths flow in like haunted background vocals, is a vast improvement and sounds like nothing else on this album, which is a good thing.\n\n​31. With Or Without You\n\n​Another hard pass for me. Bono tweaks the lyrics to one of his best written songs for no valuable reason. Otherwise, this is just a flat rerecording of the original with weaker vocals that warble around the key, and spare instrumentation.\n\n​32. Stay (Far Away, So Close!)\n\nI made a face more appropriate for having eaten a \"Lemon\" when this song began. This is far and away the best song from Zooropa. The vocals were pitch perfect. Here, they're just low and forgettable until they're supposed to soar. In the original, Bono goes right up to the edge of his falsetto for a bit before finally breaking into it, and it's pure rock bombast. Here, he gently nudges his falsetto, and he just sounds tired, which doesn't work with the lyrics.\n\n33. Sunday Bloody Sunday\n\nOn one of the Pop B-sides, The Edge takes over vocal duties for a slowed-down version of \"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\", and it's such a stark contrast to the original that it's haunting and really feels like the band doing something new. They reproduce that here, twenty-five years later, but with Bono on vocals. It's fine, I guess. Why Bono decided wipe your tears away needed to be changed to wipe your tears from your eyes baffles me. Did he think the U2 fans willing to buy this album wouldn't know where tears come from? He then pushes into a new final verse. I would like to reiterate that Bono hasn't become a better songwriter recently, and should maybe let his songs stand as they are.\n\n​34. Lights Of Home\n\nWithout going back and listening to the original Songs Of Experience track, I couldn't tell you what the difference between that version and this one is. I can only tell you that I think I like this one better.\n\n35. Cedarwood Road\n\nI almost just typed \"ibid\" but the original version for this song came from Songs Of Innocence. The only difference is that, while I like this version better, I still don't like it enough that I have any desire to listen to it again. It just doesn't inspire me in any way, nor does it have a memorable hook.\n\n36. I Will Follow\n\nThe further away U2 is from the original material, the more interesting their reimaginings are. The new lyrics don't grab me, but I like the production here.\n\n37. Two Hearts Beat As One\n\nIt's Disco U2! I thought they disappeared after Pop, but here, on this track from War, they go full 1970s dance pop. It's a damned delight. How was this song left off the standard issues of Songs Of Surrender while absolute slogs like \"One\" and \"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\" remained?\n\n38. Miracle Drug\n\nThere are songs on How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb that I enjoy but don't often listen to because I rarely have the urge to listen to that era of U2. This is definitely one of them, and it does sound better with its drum-forward opening. I'm not sure if I'll listen to the reimagined Surrendered any more than I do to the reimagined No Line On The Horizon, which is where this track landed in my discography. But I do enjoy being exposed to this alternate take.\n\n39. The Little Things That Give You Away\n\nI included a heavily edited version of this song as part of the long light/dark medley on my reimagined Sometimes. I just think it's a one verse song until the end, where the song flips to the \"Sometimes\" portion, which I love. I think the second verse of this track is still unnecessary. But this is a beautiful version of the song. I appreciate that Bono enunciates the closing of the song better in this version.\n\n40. 40\n\n​The live version of this song on Under A Blood Red Sky, where the audience sings the band off the stage will always be the best version of this song. This version is an improvement over the original track on War​. It makes sense as the closing song of this experiment but on an album that's pretty much forty ballads, it doesn't really stand out.\n\nEvery album U2 has released since the turn of the millennium have touted the album as \" a return to the classic sound\". As if Achtung Baby, Zooropa, and Pop were So Terrible that the only way U2 could redeem themselves would be to go back and release another The Joshua Tree. I enjoy that their best 21st century work (which is much fewer and far between than their 90s output) is instrumentation that you can imagine from the 1980s but engineering and production techniques that they learned in the 90s.\n\nAll that said, No Line On The Horizon could absolutely be the album that followed The Joshua Tree, and that would be great.\n\nI mentioned in the description of All That You Can't Leave Behind that the best intro track U2 has done in the 21st century was \"Vertigo\", but City Of Blinding Lights, which I've used as the first track for this reimagined album, is the most \"Where The Streets Have No Name\" song U2 have created in twenty years. It's not derivative, it just has the same basic structure. And I love it.\n\nThere are four different songs that went into the creation of Fez (Being Born), and they come together to form a very Unforgettable Fire style song, with the let me hear the sound motif being laid down for a later appearance on the album.\n\nIf I Don't Go Crazy Tonight is the type of 21st century pop rock ballad U2 have been continuously writing. I think this is their greatest success at that attempt. The lyrics are the generic bumper sticker wisdom that Bono has been jotting down since Achtung Baby but it doesn't feel as stilted as it often did on All That You Can't Leave Behind.\n\nI heard a different mix of Breathe at some point before No Line On The Horizon came out, and I did Not enjoy it. But they apparently remixed it \"80 times\" during the album's creation. Well, good work. I much prefer the album version of the song. The guitar and the bass line are all Achtung Baby, the piano is very October, and the vocals are super All That You Can't Leave Behind.\n\nBono's favorite lyrics from Miracle Drug are freedom has the scent / like the top of a newborn baby's head. I think that speaks a lot to why I prefer the music of latter-day U2 to their lyrics. The story behind the song is actually extremely cool, but I didn't know about that until after I finished typing the last sentence. It's about a kid they went to school with who was paraplegic. When doctors discovered a drug that allowed him to move one muscle in his neck, they created a device that attached to his head that allowed him to type. He then became an acclaimed poet. I like the song, but wish it was as cool as the story behind it.\n\nI put a super abbreviated version of Smile, as I do enjoy one of the verses, but it's mostly just repetitive and cloying. So I've fixed that.\n\nWhen I did a different version of this album a few years ago, I accidentally included Standup Comedy and not \"If I Don't Get Crazy\" because I'd confused them in my head. It was a happy accident, as I've grown to like the 70s lofi rock style of the chorus.\n\nMagnificent is straight up my favorite song from 21st century U2. It was their second single from the album, and I had Loathed \"Get On Your Boots\", I feared the album was going to be terrible, but then FNX started playing this track, and I was relieved. I adore the fuzzy guitar info, and the lyrics. Yes, they're still self-help bumper stickery, but my first cry / it was a joyful noise totally won me over.\n\nOriginal Of The Species is a nice cool-down song after \"Magnificent\". If I were to do another pass at editing this album, I would chop this in half, as I love the instrumentation, but the lyrics are totally forgettable.\n\nSimilar to \"Magnificent\", when I heard the intro to All Because Of You, I was hooked. The lyrics make me laugh. I like the sound of my own voice (we know Bono, we know) / I didn't give anyone else a choice (say more) / an intellectual tor-toise (what?)\n\nUnknown Caller could have easily been from The Unforgettable Fire. Its lyrics are not great, but I enjoy the sound of the vocals over the track.\n\nNeon Lights just sounds like it was made to bridge \"Unknown Caller\" to the next track. I enjoy its brevity. I had no idea it was a Kraftwerk cover until I started researching this reimagined album.\n\nThe Hands That Built America should never have been a single. I imagined it was used well in Gangs Of New York, but I've never had any desire to see it. This is another track that I'd edit further if I were going to redo this album.\n\nThe soaring chorus of Always is the highlight of the song. Another recut of this album, and this track would just be bridge/chorus/bridge/chorus without the underwhelming verses.\n\nThe unexpected duet with Green Day to cover The Skids's The Saints Are Coming as well as the folk song \"The House Of The Rising Sun\" was a song I never knew I wanted. I enjoy the combination of the band, even if it's somewhat surprising to me that Green Days guitars would be the driving force of the song, and not The Edge's.\n\nI mentioned how much I loathed Get On Your Boots when it was released as the lead-in single to the album. It's maybe the stupidest song they've recorded. But I've drastically cut it, so that it's mostly a one minute song to bring back the let me hear the sound refrain. And the guitar is fuzzy and great.\n\nThe title track, No Line On The Horizon has Bono earnestly screeching the lyrics with a little wooooah wooooah wooooah wooooah that makes me smile.\n\nAnother contender for \"This could have been released on The Unforgettable Fire\" is Moment Of Surrender. The wailing vocals here, make for an interesting tilt to this album, as Bono's voice starts the album in his playful occasional falsetto pop style but it becomes increasingly desperate as the album goes on. He really wants you to listen to his lyrics as the album gets ... not deeper per se ... further.\n\n\"Moment Of Surrender\" fades perfectly into White As Snow, a simple, almost country song. But about snow. I'm no expert on country music, but off the top of my head, I can't think of any country song that involve snow, unless they're Christmas covers.\n\nOn another album One Step Closer could be a closer. But I enjoy that it is the title of the penultimate song.\n\nChoose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you /Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you / They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends /Gonna last with you longer than your friends is a great close to the album. The subdued \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" drumbeat in the background, and the sample of Brian Eno and Harold Budd's \"Against The Sky\" make The Cedars Of Lebanon a haunting lullaby about war. It would have been an interesting final ever U2 track. They could have gone out, artistically if not commercially, as relevant and fondly remembered as any band could hope for. Unfortunately, they followed this up with the free iTunes album that will be very, very briefly touched on during the final installment of the U2 Reimagined Discography.\n\nI have a friend who was also a huge U2 fan in the late 90s, and slowly cooled off in the 21st century. The kind of friend who, the first time we hung out, overheard me turning down plans with another person by saying \"Sorry, I have a friend visiting.\" and asked, mostly sincerely, \"We're friends now?\" The two of us saw U2 during what must have been the second leg of their No Line On The Horizon tour. We weren't whelmed. It was no fault of the band. The venue we saw them at was terrible. The sound was atrocious, and we barely got their in time, due to traffic.\n\nThis friend claims that All That You Can't Leave Behind is the last album they enjoy. Though they enjoy it semi-ironically.\n\nI actually think most of All That You Can't Leave Behind is ... not very good. U2's return to their old style of playing was overdue, but it came out too sentimental to me. There were some songs I loved, a few I liked, and some I never listen to. In contrast, there are a bunch of songs on How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb that I never listen to, a couple that I like, and a few that I love.\n\nTherefore, this album is actually a combination of those two albums, plus some non-album tracks. There will be no How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb in this discography, but fear not, as you'll see from the first couple of tracks, some of the album did survive.\n\nVertigo is the best 21st century opening song U2 has come up with. Sure, it got way overplayed, since it was iTunes's theme song for 2005. They even made a red U2-filled iPod, which I would have bought except ... I already had all those songs on my iPod. Some of Vertigo's lyrics are somewhat silly but the second verse is killer, and I love Edge's guitar work on this clear improvement of \"Elevation\".\n\nSometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is another song that's actually from How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. I enjoy the whole song, but it's Bono's wannabe operatic lift of Can you/hear/me/when I/sing/You're the reason I sing that makes this one of my favorites. The whole vibe of this song feels like what All That You Can't Leave Behind was reaching for. I also like that its ending jangle is actually the beginning jingle of the next track.\n\nI've chosen the Orbit version of Electrical Storm, as the \"Band Version\" is boring. I love the echo and the effects burying the guitar in the mix. This was, by far, the highlight of Best Of 1990-2000 B-Sides for me.\n\nOh, hey, look, it's actually a song from the original version of the album. Walk On begins by announcing that love (the subject of the last song) is not an easy thing / the only baggage you can bring / is all that you can't leave behind. Hey! That's the name of the album! One of the two self-help singles from this album that I enjoy, this song got overplayed a bit when 9/11 gave it a bit too much resonance. But, like many of the songs on the original All That You Can't Leave Behind album, it's actually a song for Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of INXS who hung himself.\n\nI edited Peace On Earth so long ago that I don't remember what I excised from it, or why. I think it just dragged. It's a perfectly find radio edit length ditty but five minutes of it is Too Much. So, here's a shorter cut.\n\nBeautiful Day is in contention for my favorite U2 song. When I heard it, in advance of the album, I was confident that I was going to love this album. I was wrong. But it was a fun, optimistic month or so. The heartbeat drums are probably A Bit Much for some people, but I love them.\n\nAnother track I chopped the fuck down was New York. There's two whole verses where Bono does the thing where he tries to sing an octave lower than he's capable of. So *thwack*, that section of the song is gone, we go direct to Bordering On Falsetto Bono. I also cut \"Bono calls out different ethnicities for dumbass reasons.\" So this version of the song is Much Shorter.\n\nI mentioned that \"Vertigo\" is sort of an improved version of Elevation. I didn't mean to imply that \"Elevation\" is bad. I quite like the buzzy guitars, and falsetto backgrounds. Though I could do without his occasional \"scatting\". I still think this approach to guitars is an interesting way for the band to incorporate their Achtung Baby / Zooropa / Pop sensibilities while still making the songs sound more like early U2.\n\nMy cross-fade into A Little While is not my best work. This is another song where the sunny guitar riff is my favorite part of the song. The lyrics are ... there. It's another song for his wife. Yea, yea, we get it Bono, you love your wife that you met in high school. Good for you. Write her better songs.\n\nWindow In The Skies was a single from U2's U218, their Greatest Hits From Their Previous Greatest Hits albums. But with two new singles (the other one is on the next album). I was surprised I liked it, as it came pretty quickly on the heels of How To Build An Atomic Bomb.\n\nI adore the abrupt and dirty opening of Love And Peace, even if I'm exhausted by Bono singing generic songs about peace. Without The Edge and Adam Clayton, this would be a super wimpy Bono ballad. As it is, I like it more than most of the rest of the tracks from How To Build An Atomic Bomb.\n\nSummery guitar again lulls the album into Kite, another self-help song, but one whose lyrics I actually quite like. It segues really nicely into Wild Honey, a weird little song that lyrically doesn't fit on to any U2 album. It's a fun departure.\n\nI almost didn't include Stuck In A Moment You Can't Get Out Of, as it's another self-help song that got super played during the months after 9/11. It doesn't have the resonance for me that the other singles do, but I do like the chorus, and the way it climbs out of itself near the end.\n\nThe final track is actually a live track of Bono with The Coors singing When The Stars Go Blue from a VH1 special. I really enjoy the way Bono's vocals blend with The Coors. It also fits my weird Ryan Adams fandom, where I only like him when he's singing covers, and I only like his original music when it is being covered by someone else. I also included it because I couldn't figure out how to end the album, so ... umm ... here's an applause fadeout.\n\nIf Zooropa had a lukewarm reception, and the world who bothered to notice the Passengers EP gave it a raised eyebrow, then the Pop album tanked. I was in a band when Pop came out, and I remember the guiatrist saying \"I know you're a big U2 fan, but NOBODY likes Pop. Tell me you don't like Pop.\"\n\nI like Pop. It's marketing was odd. The live tour conceit was at best a stretch, at worst stupid and indulgent. The songs could have had better mixes, but ... I liked them. But I liked them in such a way that this is the first of two albums that I've majorly remixed. Cutting out entire verses of songs, using alternate takes, tracking down the vocal tracks and instrumental tracks and remixing them. But, in the end, I quite like the album I ended up with.\n\nU2 remixed M's \"Pop Muzik\" as a B-side to \"The Last Night On Earth\". It's a much better intro to this album than \"Discotheque\", and because the instrumentation is so similar, it flows right into the album version of \"Mofo\", so my version Popmart opens with this Mofo (Pop Muzik Remiks). What can I say, I love albums that start with a slow build and then screeching guitars.\n\nI debated following this up with the Allen Ginsberg version of Miami, where he gleefully reads the lyrics while Bono songs. It's a bit much. And since he already appears on my version of The Joshua Tree, I decided to just use the album version of Miami. It's lyrically ridiculous, but I like the beat, and after the incredibly stupid you know some places are like your aunty / but there's no place like, I really enjoy Bono's screeching Miami!\n\nBubbling up at the end of that track is the single mix of If God Would Send His Angels. The album track is severely lacking in the weird engineering decisions that make this an album, as opposed to a collection of unfinished songs. The single version also benefits from flipping the choruses, and adding a new set of lyrics where Bono \"scat\" on the album version.\n\nA bright build out of the previous song brings us to Last Night On Earth. I've never understood why this was a single. It's a perfectly fine album track, but it's not catch enough for radio play. Even though it's not one of my favorite tracks on the album, I haven't done any work on it. It appears just as it did on the original.\n\nLeonard Cohen's Hallelujah is such an overplayed song to cover. Jeff Buckley's cover is, of course, the gold standard. But, I have to confess, this version by Bono from the mostly atrocious Tower Of Song tribute album, is the first time I ever heard the song. It will never be The Greatest Cover Of The Song. I don't think I'd ever just listen to the song on its own (though I did in the 90s), but it fits really well on to the Popmart album, and I still have a nostalgic enjoyment of the track, even if Bono has publicly apologized for ever recording it.\n\nThe Playboy Mansion is another track with ridiculous lyrics. It's sort of a much less impactful \"Zooropa\" with a stupid conceit at the center (getting into the Playboy Mansion). It's dumb dumb dumb. But I love the warmth of the guitar on the track. It feels as Florida as \"Miami\".\n\nA B-Side to \"Staring At The Sun\", North & South Of The River is in contention for my favorite song from the album. It's co-written and originally recorded with Irish folk musician, Christy Moore, but I enjoy the bubble popping Popmart version. It's a super melodramatic teenage love song song by Bono who was in his early two-hundreds when he recorded this.\n\nAnother B-Side that I like more than a bunch of songs from the original album, there are two very different mixes of Holy Joe: The Guilty Mix and The Garage Mix. I've chosen The Garage Mix because it sounds dirtier. And I like this song filthy. I think I prefer the alternate lyrics from The Guilty Mix, but I'm willing to sacrifice them for Bono's desperate sounding vocals under the overmixed guitar and drums.\n\nThe Monster Truck Mix of Staring At The Sun is such an improvement over both the album version of the song, and the \"new version\" recorded for Greatest Hits 1990 - 2000, that I can't even listen to the other versions. I love the driving beats, the breakdowns, and the repetitive chaotic ending. It's a toss-up between this, \"North & South Of The River\", and \"Please\" for my favorite track from this album. I just think that if the band was going to play at making a Euro Dance album, they should have taken it as far as possible.\n\nThe White Album is my favorite Beatles album. I was in no way disappointed to listen to U2 covering Happiness Is A Warm Gun. I've chosen The Gun Mix, from the \"Last Night On Earth Single\" to include here. Like \"Hallelujah\", my nostalgia for the original version helps propel it on to the album. It's not an amazing cover, but I appreciate that it doesn't, in any way, stay faithful to the original.\n\nWhen U2 sat down to figure out which tracks to put on The Best Of 1990-2000, they decided to remix most of the tracks from Pop. This was a wise decision. I've chosen that album's version of Gone, as it has a cleaner vocal mix, and more consistent guitars. I also much prefer the operatic climax of this version to the original.\n\nPlease is a track which I've heard several remixes of, and enjoyed all of them. I've stuck with the original album version here. I remember, when it came out, there was a documentary narrated by Dennis Hopper called \"A Year In Pop\", and he talks about how he was waiting for U2 to finally record something as timeless and important as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", and how \"Please\" is that song. It's not. I love the song, but it's not going on Rolling Stone's 500 Best Songs Of Classic Rock any time soon.\n\nI used to hate If You Wear That Velvet Dress. I debated not putting it on to this album. Bono's vocals are so low that he can't quite hit any of the notes. I don't know why I've grown to like that. But I like it in an almost ironic way. It's a bad song. It's almost \"album track on The Million Dollar Hotel Soundtrack\" bad. But buried this deep on the album, it amuses me. And the chorus is ... fine.\n\nI very unironically love Do You Feel Loved. Its chorus is the part of this album that most gets stuck in my head when I'm not deliberately thinking of U2.\n\nNow that the album is almost over, it's time for the original album's intro track, which was also their lead single. I remember, to celebrate the album's release, MTV played every U2 video from \"A Celebration\" to whatever the final single from Zooropa was (\"Lemon\", maybe?), followed by the debut of Discotheque. I enjoyed the cheesiness of both the video and the song. I've included the original album version because it just begs for people to do deliberately stupid dance moves to it. Look you know you're chewing bubblegum / you know what it is / but you still want some.\n\nThe close to the original album, and my interpretation is definitely Wake Up Dead Man, which is basically a new set of lyrics slapped over a \"Numb\", \"Zooropa\", and a couple of tracks from the Salome Sessions. I'm not a big proponent of Jesusy songs, but a plea to Jesus from a believer who is having a hard time keeping faith works for me. That it pisses off Christian Rights buffoons is an added bonus.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n1. Mofo (Pop Muzik Remix)\n\n2. Miami\n\n3. If God Would Send His Angels (Single Version)\n\n4. Last Night On Earth\n\n5. Hallelujah (from Tower Of Song)\n\n6. The Playboy Mansion\n\n7. North & South Of The River\n\n8. Holy Joe (The Garage Mix)\n\n9. Staring At The Sun (Monster Truck Mix)\n\n10. Happiness Is A Warm Gun (Gun Mix)\n\n11. Gone (New Mix from Best Of 1990-2000)\n\n12. Please\n\n13. If You Wear That Velvet Dress\n\n14. Do You Feel Loved?\n\n15. Discotheque\n\n16. Wake Up Dead Man\n\nThis was the first U2 album where I got to see the hate for it in real time. It's also the first album I was able to buy the week it came out.\n\nI don't have a good track record with buying new albums by my favorite bands. For some reason, if I'm compelled to get something when it's new, it ends up being Guns'N'Roses The Spaghetti Incident, Bruce Springsteen's Human Touch, or Metallica's Reload.\n\nBut I still like Zooropa. Whereas Rattle & Hum seemed like U2 had failed on creating the album they set out to make, I feel like Zooropa is exactly what it was advertised to be, and if you liked the idea, you liked the album. It's just that the idea of an album mostly based on advertising and the omnipresence of capitalism is a tough sell at any time, but particularly in a 1994 where an entire generation of rock bands from the 80s were realizing that grunge/alternative rock hadn't just paused their careers but had actually ended their ability to get hit musics on the charts. Probably forever.\n\nWhile certain songs on Achtung Baby felt overproduced, to the detriment of the music, all of the overproduction on Zooropa feels intentional, and a necessary part of the song.\n\nI think people were also at a loss because U2 is always So Serious. \"Even Better Than The Real Thing\" was a fun single on an otherwise serious album, but Zooropa often sounds serious when it's being deliberately ridiculous.\n\nMuch like \"Zoo Station\" is .the essential introductory track to Achtung Baby, so too must Zooropa start with Zooropa. The first forty-five second crashing basslines and building guitar of \"Zoo Station\" let you know what you were in for. \"Zooropa\" has a two minute build of piano and sound clips (mainly George H.W. Bush saying peace talks over and over until they don't mean anything) before a melody comes in for an additional twenty seconds before the lyrics kick in.\n\nI used the term \"bumper sticker wisdom\" for a lot of the lyrics on Achtung Baby. \"Zooropa\" avoids that by using actual advertising slogans as lyrics. The idea is that we are now in a futuristic European city that has a sort of Blade-Runnery advertising focus (you know, like the horrible present we are currently living in). This was somehow released as an introductory single. As with \"The Fly\" being the introductory single for Achtung Baby, I don't understand why they did this. I had a few friends who were as into U2 as I was, and our common belief was that they deliberately released the least radio playable track as the lead single just to see what happened.\n\nIn this alternate universe the first single climbs out of \"Zooropa\". Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me got scrubbed off our universe's Zooropa and saved for the Batman Forever Soundtrack. To me, its narrative about rock stardom is a necessary expansion of U2's de-evolution into advertising and other forms of media. Plus, the suggestion of the video (it repeats sequences too often for the video to actually work, but the conceit is cool) that Bono is caught between two of his Zoo TV personalities: Macphisto and The Fly, to the point where he's no longer Bono is interesting.\n\nThere is a fuzzy changing of channels effect before we get the Bolshevik intro to Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Car, a song about how the subject of the song is too privileged to be affected by their failure. Is it a surfacey song about a young \"princess\" whose father protects her from the world, or is it about how, now matter how badly U2 fails, their record company and management team is there to protect them? You be the judge.\n\nThe song ends in a spiral of Bono proudly reciting the days of the week, which brings us perfectly into Some Days Are Better Than Others, a simplistic track about how life is different from day to day. I have edited out a line in the song that didn't age well, and shouldn't have been included, even at the time.\n\nThere is a proper fade out to \"Some Days Are Better Than Others\" that leads into the first track with a guest vocalist. Johnny Cash is the lead vocalist for The Wanderer, which U2 put at the end of the album, where they love to put their ideas of new hymns. I think the idea of closing the album with this track was that they'd stripped out much of (but not all) of the grungy new U2 sound, and that the next album would be more back to basics. But that's not at all what happened, so I'm moving this toward the beginning where it's just an interesting sonic oddity. It also echoes the theme of Just Another Day from the previous track, as it follows a guy who leaves his house one day and chronicles what keeps him wandering. Of course it's overly and overtly religious, but it you take out Jesus's name and replace it with Elvis, it could easily be about Bono's choice of being a rock star and how it affects the family he left behind.\n\nClicking out of the countrified U2 sound is a ridiculous dance song. I cut a minute or so out of this version of Lemon back before I was more adept at sound editing, so there's a brief volume rise where I've spliced out a bunch of the chorus.. The All Macphisto vocals or \"fat lady falsetto\" that Bono uses all over this album renders any seriousness that this song intends moot. It's a song about Bono's mom wearing a yellow dress? Sure. It's use as the third single from this album only accentuates what a ridiculous album this is.\n\nU2 released a soundtrack to the film The Million Dollar Hotel. It's not good. Don't bother seeking it out. But I do like The Ground Beneath Her Feet, a song Bono swiped from Salman Rushdie. It's the most Irish track since \"Tomorrow\" from October but it definitely has the Zooropa style drumming and guitar effects.\n\nThe second guest vocal track from the album comes from Sinead O'Connor as she takes the lead on The Thief Of Your Heart. This is one of three tracks I've taken from the In The Name Of The Father soundtrack, a film about four people falsely convicted for a terrorist bombing in Ireland. Unlike The Million Dollar Hotel, I do suggest you investigate this movie and soundtrack. They're both great.\n\nIn fact, the next track is the title track, In The Name Of The Father, where Bono trades off lead vocals with Gavin Friday.\n\nMarvin Gaye is the next guest vocalist, despite having been dead for a decade before Zooropa's release. Save The Children from Inner City Blues: The Music Of Marvin Gaye keeps up the bombastic and earnest U2 that the band tried to step away from in the 90s, but which is creeping its way back into their image and their non-album tracks. While these heavier tracks do not come from the original Zooropa album. I enjoy having the album see-saw between Earnest U2 and Silly Zooropa U2.\n\nThe second single from the album, Numb is the logical successor to the intro track. Sound samples are spliced behind lead vocalist, The Edge, as he monotones a list poem style song about sensory overload while playing with the band. Bono does background vocals here, presumably as Macphisto.\n\nPut your dancing shoes back on. The third track to makes its way from In The Name Of The Father, and the second to have Bono sharing lead vocals with Gavin Friday, is Billy Boola. This song is pure misguided sexuality. The lyrics are inspid and stupid Baby's a big flirt / nipples in a t-shirt coming not to soon after Oh pa coca cola E A O / E suck-a-dick-a exactly the quality of lyrics you'd expect from ... nobody involved with U2. This song is a weird anomaly in their catalogue, but the beat is super catchy.\n\nReturning to Zooropa proper, we have Babyface which is lyrically similar to \"Lemon\", which is creepy as one is about the supermodels the band hung out with, and the other is Bono singing about an old video of his mom.\n\nBuzzing beneath the surface of the song is another cover. Night And Day was released before Achtung Baby in our universe, as a track on Red Hot + Blue: A Tribute To Cole Porter but it feels more Zooropa to me. I actually somewhat prefer the Steel String Remix, and was going to put that on Desire, but it has a wonky start, and I was having trouble editing it down into a more manageable length. So this version gets put on Zooropa instead.\n\nThe fourth and final single from the album is easily my favorite track. Stay (Faraway, So Close) was on a jukebox in the snack bar of my high school. One of my friends used to play this song at least twice a day while we ran lines form Romeo & Juliet. Bono's operatic ascent into falsetto is one of his best vocal performances on any album.\n\nThe First Time is a good closing track. As it seems to be the story of the person from \"Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\" growing up, taking responsibility and leaving \"daddy\" behind. Plus it has Edge doing his pounding chord piano technique.\n\nBut, fuck it, the album isn't over yet. I LOVE the Junk Day remix of Dirty Day that U2 released for Pop. Bono's vocals are better here than our universe's album version, and the song deserves the filthier bass line.\n\nActually closing out the album is a song that showed up on Desire but was remixed here. As much as I love the other version, I did like the conceit of the album still ending with a track featuring guest vocals by a country musician, so here is Slow Dancing with Willie Nelson on lead vocals, as the band originally intended.\n\n***\n\nMy website is currently in transition, so I'm unable to upload my version of the album. If you're interested in it, e-mail me, and I'll send a copy your way.\n\nThe track listing is:\n\n1. Zooropa\n\n2. Hold Me Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me\n\n3. Daddy's Gonna Pay For Your Crashed Car\n\n4. Some Days Are Better Than Others\n\n5. Wanderer\n\n6. Lemon\n\n7. The Ground Beneath Her Feet\n\n8. The Thief Of Your Heart\n\n9. In The Name Of The Father\n\n10. Save The Children\n\n11. Numb\n\n12. Billy Boola\n\n13. Babyface\n\n14. Night And Day\n\n15. Stay (Faraway, So Close!)\n\n16. The First Time\n\n17. Dirty Day\n\n18. Slow Dancing\n\nThere's a term in professional wrestling for when a beloved character grows stale and has to reinvent themselves as a terrible person, it's called Turning Heel. After the finished product of Rattle & Hum (which I have stricken from this universe and replaced with Desire) didn't turn out as planned, and got U2 its first (but far from last) backlash from fans, the band decided to take some time off. For three years, the band avoided The United States, finishing their Lovetown Tour in Australia, Asia, and Europe, and then announcing they were going away \"to dream it up all again\".\n\nBut what we they do? Backtrack to The Unforgettable Fire? Go back to the full-time job of trying to save the universe through banal lyrics? The eighties were over, man. They needed something new. No more cowboy hats and brown leather vests. No more slick backed pony tails and pouty lips. It was time for the band to learn a new language.\n\nFrom the opening notes of the album, it's clear that U2 has learned another language. It isn't until the lyrics drop that you realize that the language they've been studying is irony. The music steals more from European dance music, and American alternative than the Blues and Folk rock of their previous albums, and their lyrics, while still using the list poem style that popped up on Desire, their focus is more on personal confusion than political platitudes or love songs. Zoo Station drops you in the midst of chaos with its heavy bassline and the dancey drum style that Mullen Jr played around with on \"God (Part 2)\" from Desire. Time is a train/Makes the future the past/Leaves you standing in the station/Your face pressed up against the glass. That's right, U2 is now that high school kid or college freshman who \"drops knowledge\" on you. Ugh.\n\nThe dancing keeps going, as the popping of bubbly ... keyboards? ... leads us into Lady With The Spinning Head, a B-side in our universe that the band cannibalized to make \"Zoo Station\", \"The Fly\", \"Ultra Violet Light My Way\", and \"Wake Up Dead Man\", if not more. It continues the ridiculousness and feeling of being lost from the first track, eventually spinning out into a cover of Can't Help Falling In Love featuring an interview with young Elvis Presley in the background, as Bono explores his lower register and falsetto in a single verse chorus bridge chorus.\n\nThe drum line brings us right into So Cruel (which is not a cover of Presley's \"Don't Be Cruel\". Edge has previously used his piano skills to evoke the feeling of an orchestra. Here, it feels like a sample, as the three notes occasionally fall into the background. We also get a love song here that isn't a fawning ballad for some perfect being, but rather Bono trying to figure out his feelings towards someone who he perceives is leading him on.\n\nSometimes I feel like I don't know / Sometimes I feel like checking out. Ultra Violet (Light My Way) is another contender for my favorite U2 song. Though I actually prefer The Killers cover from Ahk-Toong Bay-Bi. I like the song, even though it contains the word baby about a billion times.When I was so messed up / I heard opera in my head / Your love was a lightbulb / hanging over my bed is a great evolution in songwriting for Bono.\n\nTrying To Throw Your Arms Around The World almost feels like a song from Macphisto (one of many characters Bono invented for the Zoo Station Tour that supported Achtung Baby) to young Bono. Sure, it's surfacey a song about rescuing a drunk woman from harming herself, but I think young Bono is the woman he's addressing (how progressive alternative universe 1991 Bono). There is some more bumper sticker wisdom in the song, but it's still pretty catchy.\n\nI never understood how The Fly was the first single from this album. It has my favorite lyrics from the album Every artist is a cannibal / Every poet is a thief / All kill their inspiration / Then sing about their grief, but it has never seemed like single material to me. So I'm stripping it of its single status. It is married to the album. But probably in an open relationship. I've remixed this version so that is descends into the \"Lounge Fly Mix\" because I love the peppy little outro, but not enough to include the entire remix in place of the original.\n\nThere a couple of album versions of songs from Achtung Baby that I can't stand. I don't know if it's Flood's engineering, but there are a few tracks that seem wildly overproduced. They try so hard to be grungey that they wash out the positive qualities of the songs. But, like \"Zoo Station\", the grungey quality of the guitars and production, and the somewhat buried vocals on Acrobat work really well, partly because they bury that recurring bumper stickerism in the lyrics. Yes, yes, Bono, I'll watch out for grinding bastards.\n\nI may come back and fill in two albums between Desire and Achtung Baby. One will be a live album called Wide Awake In America and the other will be the \"best of\" their original recording sessions for Achtung Baby, which were stolen and released as bootlegs. They're not album quality, but I rather like them. Salome is one of the tracks that they salvaged from the bootlegs and turned into a B-Side. I like it as pushing the album further into the weird Eurodance direction they were aimed in.\n\nIn our universe the album foolishly closes with Love Is Blindness. I get it. It's ballady. The organ intro is haunting. I really like the song. But it's clearly not the closer for this album.\n\nWe're back to covers! U2 really wants to be The Rolling Stones of the late 20th / early 21st century. I've never understood this. I would always prefer to be The Beatles. None of the crossovers of U2 and The Rolling Stones have been particularly good, Bono's \"Silver & Gold\" with Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood got cut from this universe entirely. It never happened. You should also never have to watch Mick Jagger and U2 butcher \"Gimme Shelter\" at The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame, where Mick Jagger surprises everyone by being the weakest singer on a stage with both Bono and Fergie of The Black Eyed Peas. Historically, he's more legendary, but in that moment of time he was unlistenably bad. But U2's cover of Paint It Black is so desperately wannabe punk in an endearing way that is almost sounds like the U2 from Boytober got their hands on the U2 from Achtung Baby's instruments. This flows directly into their cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's Fortunate Son, which has the same energy.\n\nWe are super deep in the album to get to the first single, but here we are. Mysterious Ways is a catchy head-kick, and a great radio introduction to the new sound for U2 fans who were cautious about buying this due to their feelings about the previous album. The production is weird. The lyrics are very 90s If you want to kiss the sky / better learn how to kneel / On your knees boy. I actually struggled with whether to include my favorite version which begins with an athmospheric mix called \"Magic Hour\" before the drums of the \"Temple Bar Edit\" crash in, but the original was so integral to how I perceived this era of U2, that I felt it was necessary to include it.\n\nOn the flipside of that, the third single from the album is Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses. I'm including the single version as opposed to the album version. I find the album version astoundingly overproduced, so much so that I can't enjoy the lyrics. This is another song that has a great cover on Ahk-Toong Bay-Bi, this time by another overproduced 90s band, Garbage.\n\nBut back to the dance! I love the dark descent of Until The End Of The World. The screechy guitars of the beginning. The narrative story style lyrics. I was drowning my sorrows / But my sorrows / they learned to swim is my favorite set of lyrics plagiarised from Frida Kahlo.\n\nThe final single, Even Better Than The Real Thing, in this universe is my least favorite single from our universe (I know, I know, I removed \"The Fly\"s single status, even though I like the song better), but it's not the worst. We'll just say that in the alternate universe, Coca-Cola uses it to promote whatever product they released that year to be even better than \"the real thing\" their original recipe. Plus, how can you erase from history the spinning camera that was invented for the video, and christened Even Better Than The Wheel Thing?\n\nClosing out the album is the second single, and another all-time favorite, One. There is an alternate alternate U2 history in a book I started writing ages ago about a fictional rock star. That rock star's family is killed in an IRA attack that also kills The Edge, during the era between Desire and a wildly premature All That You Can't Leave Behind. In that canon, that vocalist and guitarist joins U2 for one album, this one. He's in hiding for a couple of years, and his first appearance is on a late show appearance with U2, debuting this song. Have you come here for forgiveness / Have you come to raise the dead / Have you come here to play Jesus / to the lepers in your head are the first lyrics he sings after his family dies, and the media paints him as ... well, maybe someday I'll write that book, and you can read about it. I like this song in every alternate timeline.\n\n***\n\nI realize that my description of these songs doesn't make the band sound heelish. In fact, it was their behavior on tour and in interviews that gave the impression. Bono in a trash-bag looking black leather jacket and wrap around sunglasses at all hours of the night (later, he explained this was to fight his glaucoma, but he could have picked less douchey looking glasses), smoking cigarettes and speaking in a whiney voice about the state of the world. Bono prank calling politicians from the stage of their multimedia soaked tour. Ok, so it's mostly Bono who turns heel, but nobody else in the band appears to be trying to stop him.\n\nBecause they still don't talk to the press in this universe, we don't know that the band nearly broke up over the change in direction between albums. We don't know that Mullen and Clayton hate the change, but love the lifestyle. We just know that there is a major leap between Desire and Achtung Baby that most bands don't ever make, and almost no bands make succesfully. Unfortunately, many fans will feel that the era between Achtung Baby and All That You Can't Leave Behind are bleak and soulless. I disagree. And I'm looking forward to sharing my version of Zooropa.\n\nI don't know if there is a moment when a person becomes insufferable. But I know there is often a moment when you come to the conclusion that a person or group of people is insufferable. And for a lot of people, U2 became insufferable with the release of their documentary, Rattle & Hum. With its deep stares out windows, long political rants, fixation on the band's relations to famous American rock pioneers, and bland covers of obvious songs (\"All Along The Watchtower\"? Really? \"Helter Skelter\"? Come on.), it is a tough watch for a night at the movies, but a fun watch for a night at home, taking a shot every time someone says something pretentious.\n\nThe backlash was so severe, and so understood by the band that they changed their entire image, and drenched themselves in irony before they released their next album.\n\nThis was the second U2 album I owned. It contained live versions of some of the songs I enjoyed from the previous album. The gospel choir version of \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking Far\" is still, in my opinion, far superior to the original. Depending on the day, I go back and forth about whether the Joshua Tree or Rattle & Hum version of \"Bullet The Blue Sky\" is my favorite. I really enjoyed the whole album at the time.\n\nI wouldn't call it \"good\".\n\nFor this alternate universe I've removed all the live tracks. All of them. Every interview clip, gone. I've inserted a few b-sides and covers, but they're not the covers that appeared on \"Rattle & Hum\". This version is so different, that I think it deserves a different name, so I'm calling it \"Desire\". The cover at is the art from the \"Desire\" single. Shadowy Larry Mullen Jr. is my favorite band member from this era.\n\nWhereas The Unforgettable Fire and The Joshua Tree started with atmospheric music, and then the lyrics crept in, Desire starts off with brief, janky calliope music, and then Larry Mullen Jr. starts pounding on some drums. Everything about this album is American, in a way only four white dudes from Not America could conceive. The music sounds like it's written to filled a vast, empty landscape. The lyrics are all about love and longing (hence the title).\n\nHawkmoon 269 sounds like it was conceived of in a creative writing class, where the instructor said \"Write some lyrics about love, using only similes.\" This is not a dig. I really like the lyrics in this song because they are dopeily simple. Bono just needs your love, guys. GIVE HIM YOUR LOVE OR HE WILL CONTINUE TO WRITE SIMILES ABOUT HOW MUCH HE NEEDS YOUR LOVE. I also love the choir that builds behind the final verse. It's possible Bono actually wrote this song from this alternate universe, as he's always maintained that the title comes from a town he passed through in the Dakotas called Hawkmoon. But no such town exists in the universe I live in.\n\nIf Bono were more a metaphor guy than a simile guy, then Heartland would be a flat song. And while he's not on perfect pitch for this whole song, he's not nearly as flat as he was on The Unforgettable Fire. He is occasionally breathy, especially when he says \"Heartland\". Luckily, that's not, like, the most used word in the song.\n\nWhile I wouldn't call this album joyous, there is a lot more love and contented wonder contained in this album than any that proceed it. It's more joyously adolescent than Boy, whose whole premise was surviving adolescence. The first single, is the eponymous song, Desire. I love this song. I, unironically, love the lyrics, even though I don't know why the red guitar is on fire. While I don't think the concept of desire is uniquely American, we do have a flavor of desire that the tone of this song encapsulates. It's all over money money money money money money /money money money money money money/and the fever is getting higher. I think I recall this song being used to advertise the NBA playoffs at the beginning of the 21st century, and instead of thinking \"sellouts\", I thought \"That actually makes sense. Both for what it's advertising, and to be a song that you sell the rights to for advertising.\"\n\nIf you want an uncomfortable and awkward explanation about why U2 was obsessed with Elvis Presley, you can check out the Rattle & Hum documentary. If you want to hear an absolutely wretched song about it, you can look up their song \"Elvis Presley And America\", which does not exist in my alternate reality. If you just want a general sense for their Elvis reverence, A Room At The Heartbreak Hotel should suffice. In our universe, it was a B-side for \"Desire\", but I think it's just as good as anything on the album, particularly the choir repeating the song title ad nauseum at the end before finally deciding to say hallelujah.\n\nAs I mentioned in the preamble, there were some very On The Nose American covers on Rattle & Hum that I didn't want to include. But, in the spirit of the album I've included two covers that seem more surprisingly American. First off is a hit from Robert Knight called Everlasting Love. This is a very American song that's not part of The Great American Songbook, nor is it from The Overplayed Book Of American White Dudes.\n\nNext up is a reverse cover. Slow Dancing is a song that Bono wrote for Willie Nelson (that version will show up later). It was written during the sessions for Zooropa, which is three albums away. But it *sounds* like it should have been recorded in the late eighties, so I'm putting it here.\n\nClimbing out of \"Slow Dancing\" is Unchained Melody, a Righteous Brothers song that seemed omnipresent in soundtracks for 1980s movie but actually was only on the soundtrack to Ghost in 1990. But, oh was that song everywhere in 1990. The song was also popularized by a cover by Elvis, recorded on the final concert film he made before he died. I hate to think that they only recorded it because of its Elvis connection, but it seems, given some of the interviews from Rattle & Hum, that that's probably the case. Luckily, those interviews never took place in this alternate universe, and we can believe that U2 were just really big Righteous Brothers fans.\n\nIt's wailing harmonica time, America. And Bono still needs your love. He needed it in \"Hawkmoon 269\", he needed it in \"Everlasting Love\", he needed it in \"Unchained Melody\", and he needs it to rescue him now in Love Rescue Me. The horns here are also very American, but not as American as some impending horns on this album. This song is the most How An Irish Guy In His Thirties Might Imagine An American Cowboy Song Would Sound. It even has some Biblical lines.\n\nI first heard Dancing Barefoot on the Threesome soundtrack. I didn't realize it was a Patti Smith cover, because I was an ignorant teenager. I don't remember anything about the movie Threesome. Even looking at the cover of the album now makes me shrug. I don't know what enticed me to pick it up, aside from my need to own all things U2. But I do still enjoy their cover, but not as much as the original.\n\nWhen Love Comes To Town, the third single from the album , features BB King on vocals. BB's growls are super American. At the time of the recording he had recently been inducted into The Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame, part of the second ever group of musicians voted in. Like virtually all performers who record duets with Bono, King outsings him by a wide, wide margin. It's also good to hear Lucille (King's guitar) take center stage, as opposed to The Edge's unnamed guitar.\n\nI mentioned in the preamble that U2 is about to change almost every aspect of their music. They're about to go super dancey. There is a fantastically fun remix of \"Desire\" that has a ton of news samples, as well as heavy use of sirens. God (Part 2) also has that dancey feel, but without the samples. It's an interesting preview of what's to come on Achtung Baby. It's also got a similar list poemy feel that opened the album on \"Hawkmoon 269\" centered on faith and belief, as opposed to romantic love.\n\nTaking the tone back to acousticy Americana, we get Hallelujah (Here She Comes), another \"Desire\" B-side. Rarely do I let a song fully fade out, without bringing up another track on these albums, but I like letting this song simmer out in preparation for the next track.\n\nThe second single, Angel Of Harlem is the brassiest, Americanest song U2 has ever recorded. I wish it weren't about New York City, the most cliche American city to write about. But I love the horns. It's so 80s American rock.\n\nThe final track is also the final single, All I Want Is You is probably U2's most epic-sounding ballad. Definitely it's most bombastic. In contrast to the first track, Bono is now concerned with what the object of his affection wants. Though he immediately reminds the person that he has only one want YOU. ALL HE WANTS IS YOU. GIVE HIM YOUR YOU. His implication that you are being metaphorical in your desires, while his is pretty straight-forward is a great way to end an album where Bono has been constantly demanding that you love him.\n\n***\n\nI really do think this album is heads and shoulders better than Rattle & Hum, as its more direct in theme, and doesn't suffer from \"Is it a live album? Is it a studio album? Who is this person quietly talking to Larry Mullen Jr before we are suddenly listening to a live track where The Edge is singing lead vocals?\" \"Were Satan and Adam\" (the name of a singing duo) \"properly paid for the thirty seconds of Freedom For My People that's randomly inserted into the album?\"\n\nI hadn't listened to the proper album, in its entirety, for years before I started making my own versions of U2's discography. But I do find myself, on occasion, putting \"Desire\" on, when I get nostalgic for U2's Americana phase.\n\ndesire.zipFile Size: 147668 kbFile Type: zip\n\nDownload File\n\nFor a wide variety of reasons, in the universe I a m living in, and you are likely reading this from, 2016 was a bummer of a year. Amongst the reasons: the deaths of David Bowie, Prince, and Tom Petty. The American Presidential Election and the creation and subsequent vote on Brexit were also mentally taxing horror shows, but those have only gotten worse. Bowie, Prince, and Petty haven't been continually killed in worse and more horrifying ways in the intervening three years. None of your horrible relatives have, without anyone asking, repeatedly made public their views that rock stars deserve to die horrible deaths because a room-temperature IQed reality star with a history of not paying bills or being able to finish a sentence said so.\n\nI chose to grieve by making my own alternate reality discographies of the deceased musical icons. I shared some with friends, and merely commented on making others. No one had any controversial takes on making the mixes. But when I mentioned that I hadn't touched Prince's Purple Rain because this reality's version was perfect, a couple of my friends, who are bigger and more loyal Prince fans than I am, offered remixes and alternative tracks to improve Purple Rain. They were mostly correct.\n\nU2's The Joshua Tree has a similar touchstone significance for U2 fans to Prince fans feelings about Purple Rain. It's the album that brought the most people into the artists' hearts and ears.\n\nIn 2017, U2 launched a tour where they mostly just played songs from the thirty year old album, or from the sets they played when touring for The Joshua Tree. This may have had something to do with the commercial failures of their most recent two albums, but fans were excited by the roving nostalgia of the tour conceit.\n\nIs it perfect? Of course not. Though I have a frequent loiterer/antagonist/contrarian who, whenever U2 is brought out, is quick to point out his incorrect opinion that the only good songs in the U2 catalog are from The Joshua Tree, and that they should have disbanded when it was over. Nobody likes that guy. And his feelings about U2 aren't even in the top hundred reasons that nobody likes that guy.\n\nI mentioned during the alternate universe Unforgettable Fire post that it's my favorite album. Still, I erased one song from it entirely (the agonizingly out of tune and boring \"Elvis Presley And America\". I have not erased any songs from The Joshua Tree. I have merely rearranged them, and added some B-Sides and once-lost tracks from the albums that have shown up on subsequent rereleases of the album. The singles aren't as buried on the album as they were on The Unforgettable Fire, partially because they're stronger, but mostly because there's more of them. Enjoy!\n\nDeep In The Heart could have come from The Unforgettable Fire. It has the atmospheric start, and the less-focused lyrics, as well as Bono being more experimental with his vocals. It also sets an interesting tone. We're certainly going to get to some political tracks on this album, but instead of setting a rebellious tone, this opening track is about trying to make everything work out tonight. A noble goal.\n\nAnother...another...love song? Bono sings a song about his wife and her ... Spanish Eyes ??? From what I can gather \"Spanish Eyes\" is a term Irish people have used for Irish men and women with dark hair and eyes. It seems not so much offensive, as I've not found any negative connotations to the term, just factually inaccurate. Bono's growling during a non-political song gives the song a sense of fun urgency that the lyrics support, but which I rather enjoy.\n\nBuilding out of it is one of the best riffs the band has ever written. The first single from the album is I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For. A love song about faith built on Christian gospel that never namedrops Christ but uses Biblical imagery. This song is best performed by or with a gospel choir (we'll get to that later in the discography), but even the original is catchy as misguided religious beliefs.\n\nDue to the band (in this alternate dimension)'s ban on talking about politics off-stage, U2's tour through Nicaragua and El Salvador seemed merely to be the act of taking their act to countries that big European rock bands rarely visited. That the band came out of the experience with Mothers Of The Disappeared is rarely mentioned in articles about them. But the heart of this song is the plight of South American prisoners. The lyrics are more focused than those from The Unforgettable Fire, but just as poetic. The song is too haunting to bury as the last track. It's also one of Bono's best vocal performances to date.\n\nTwanging through the decaying clouds of \"Mothers Of The Disappeared\" is Running To Stand Still, a much more articulate and lush narrative about addiction than The Unforgettable Fire's \"Bad\". This song is in contention for my favorite U2 track ever. The Edge even breaks out his piano for the first time since War! And the guitar was actually written by producer Daniel Lanois. Unlike \"Tomorrow\" where U2 matches the Irishness of the lyrics with more stereotypical Irish instruments and arrangement, here U2 goes more American Blues with Bono even playing harmonica to close out the song.\n\nRace Against Time harkens back a bit to \"Alex Descends Into Hell For A Bottle Of Milk\" with the song building around the bass track, and repeated lyrics, as opposed to a verse/chorus structure. It's a nice build to the lapping \"Waves Of Sorrow\", which is probably Bono's weakest vocal performance on this album. His voice breaks the way it frequently did on War. While the use of Biblical imagery work really well in songs like \"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\", they're super heavy handed here. I really enjoy the chanting quality of the final three verses, though.\n\nDrums and harmonica, like light beer and Twinkies, signal that we're about to get really Really American. Trip Through Your Wires delivers a decidedly American edge to U2's sound. Even Biblical imagery and Edge's jangly guitar can't move the song back across The Atlantic. And that's fine.\n\n\"Trip Through Your Wires\" repeatedly mentions how thirsty Bono is, so it's good that he follows it up with Walk To The Water. We also continue talking about a nebulous woman. Is it the same woman from \"Spanish Eyes\"? From \"Running To Stand Still\"? We seem to be tracking her progress much the way we were following the subject of \"Running To Stand Still\". Hmmm.\n\nThe fifth single from the album (we'll get to numbers two through four) is The Sweetest Thing. A fun summer love song that, like \"Spanish Eyes\" was written about Bono's wife, Ali. The lyrics are dopey as hell but in a much more acceptable way then when Bono goes Heavy. I also appreciate how Bono's voice goes fairly parroty instead of his usual falsetto when he goes high.\n\nThe fourth single from the album is the most political U2 single since \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" [take that, \"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\"!]. Edge's guitar playing on Bullet The Blue Sky is phenomenal and Very American. Clayton's bassline is simple but unrelenting. Mullen's drums harken back to War. And Bono's lyrics are some of his finest, even when he goes all Biblical again, with the story of Jacob wrestling the angel, and the returning image of burning crosses. In our universe the lyric From the locust wind/comes a rattle and hum gives the title to their next album. But, spoiler alert, that's not the name of the next album in this alternate discography. In this universe, they do not release an album with that title.\n\n\"Bullet The Blue Sky\" ends with Bono talking about refugees who run into the arms of America, which, coincidentally is the title of the Alan Ginsberg poem that serves as the lyrics to Drunk Chicken (America). Ginsberg is even the vocalist for this track. I'm not a huge fan of Ginsberg, but I do like this poem, even if I wish it hadn't inspired so many similar poems by other Beat Poet wannabes.\n\nClimbing out of \"Drunk Chicken (America)\" is the band's third single With Or Without You. Another contender for my favorite U2 song. Following this album, Bono's falsetto gets a nasal quality to it, so enjoy this pure falsetto while you can.\n\nIn God's Country is the first song on the album that really evokes the cover photo, what with having a desert in it. Not sure how I feel about the lyric sleep comes like a drug on an album that otherwise speaks to the horrors of drug addiction. Bono also comes close to putting some American country inflection in this song, but he always pulls out at the last second.\n\nBeautiful Ghost evokes \"Mothers Of The Disappeared\" with its haunting instrumentation but has the Bono speaking style that he will use years later, in our universe, on the soundtrack to The Million Dollar Hotel. It's a solid haunting lullaby.\n\nBreaking through the ambience of the previous track, Luminous Times is another hold on to love track. Lyrically, this song is not my favorite, partially because I don't enjoy the use of the word soul, partially because the song never actually goes anywhere, but that seems to be part of its point. Love is god's blah blah blah, and you should hold on to it. Fiiiiiiiiiiiiine.\n\nThe second single from the album, Where The Streets Have No Name becomes their tour opener for the end of the eighties, and also for much of the twenty-first century. It's constant sense of building, and never arriving so much as ending with The Edge twanging the same sequence from the beginning of the song is really indicative of the whole experience of this album.\n\nThe squeak of Edge on his guitar is one of the album's most endearing sounds. It shouldn't work with the heaviness of Red Hill Mining Town but it does. Perfectly.\n\nOne Tree Hill has one of the most unnecessary fake endings and rebuilds of any U2 song. I an't explain why I enjoy it. I really enjoy it as the album's penultimate track, too. Here you go, a poppy Americaneque rock ballad to end the album. Just kidding, there's going to be another atmospheric song before we go!\n\nHow is U2 going to have a song called Exit be on the album, fade it into silence, and then not have it be the final track? I've fixed that for them.\n\nthe_joshua_tree.zipFile Size: 125453 kbFile Type: zip\n\nDownload File\n\nI've been involved in the poetry slam scene for over twenty years now. I've seen it transform from monologues to stand up comedy to political diatribes to persona work to multi-voiced theater to identity-focused political pleas. It's been mostly interesting (but sometimes frustrating) to watch the ebb and flow of what's popular amongst a community. I find it much more interesting to watch a specific artist evolve in their writing. A high school student comes to poetry writing about their day to day life goes to college and begins to frame their daily experiences from a particular political or identity stance. Then they fall in love, and tell political stories through the lens of being in a relationship. Then they break up, and don't want to write about their terrible ex, and begin creating surreal monologues about their job. Then they worry they are stifling their creativity by not writing about their ex, and begin to write humor pieces where they dissect their own relationship from a variety of points of view. Then they read a powerful story in the news, and they write about it from the perspective of someone involved in the event.\n\nI love seeing how a person grows into themselves through they're writing. And the same goes for bands. Often, a band or artist is only popular for less than a decade, so you watch as their art improves, but you may never see it fully switch gears. Often, by the time they hit the national stage, they have a voice, and once they get famous, their managers, record company, producers, and marketers get terrified when they try and reinvent themselves in any way. So their music tends to be Their Music. It evolves almost macroscopically. But then there's The Beatles whose entire process, voice, and music catalogue underwent an enormous change in just ten years.\n\nU2 has been around for forty years now. Their evolution was much slower and less dramatic than The Beatles, but created a much more varied amount of styles and topics than The Rolling Stones, who've been around for sixty years at this point. I'm not saying which bands are better, but I'm fascinated at their evolutions.\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire is the first of two major shifts in U2's career. Coming out of the politically charged War with its focus on thick bass drumlines and repetitive political chants, U2 managed to write a sonically softer album. Not necessarily ballady, but Edge's jangly guitar riffs lose their aggression, Mullen Jr's drums get pushed further back in the mix, Clayton's basslines get more experimental, and Bono's lyrics are still political but now contemplative, instead of preachy.\n\nInstead of letting the drumbeats dictate the change in songs, the tracks on The Unforgettable Fire climb out of each other, like one long shifting symphony.\n\nThe Unforgettable Fire has long been my favorite U2 album. It's more focused than anything that comes before it. It should really only have two singles, \"Pride (In The Name Of Love)\" and \"Bad\". The rest of the songs are more album rock, a feel that they wouldn't go back to until All That You Can't Leave Behind. It's the album I most return to, and the one I've done the least amount of altering to when placing it in the alternative timeline. I haven't cut any songs, I didn't do any extensive editing, I just changed the track order, and added some similar work they did with other artists.\n\nMuch the way Alternate Universe U2's War started with a political mission statement, and the drums would be almost unrelenting for the rest of the album, The Unforgettable Fire starts with a track that most speaks to the album's aesthetic. MLK is a hymn and a lullaby. The hum of an organ is the only background music, creating a song vastly different from anything on the previous albums. The very simple verse is repeated twice, and then ends without ever hitting a bridge or chorus.\n\nClimbing out of the hum comes Edge's clanky guitars as Alex Descends Into Hell For A Bottle Of Milk has no Bono vocals, instead a boys choir sings in Latin. In our universe, this nearly instrumental track was a B-Side from Achtung Baby that the band wrote for a stage production of \"A Clockwork Orange\", but I like it here, as the preview of a sound that's four albums away but definitely looming as their next major shift.\n\nOnce again, the songs overlap as a guitar riff builds out of the previous song's climax. Wire feels like something Bono might have written for War if he was more focused on evoking emotion than political persuasion. Clayton's winding bassline, looping around Edge's scattershot guitar riffs is super striking, particularly coming out of the two preceding, less aggressive tracks.\n\nWhen discussing Boytober, I mentioned that I had a hard time reconciling all the reviews that referred to Bono as a poet for his lyrics. But on this album, his songs do feel more like poetry than lyrics. A lot of it is there are very few choruses on the album. According to the band's self-made legend, Bono wasn't able to finish the lyrics on this album, so much of the writing was ad-libbing and sketches. And it works. I have favorite songs on this album that I don't even know the lyrics to. Or that I know the lyrics to, but have never really sat down and parsed out what they're trying to say. The lyrics seem abstract. On this album more than any other U2 song, Bono's vocals are more instrument in the mix than focus. That's especially true on this eponymous track Unforgettable Fire. I love it. What's it about? A feeling of wanting to go home. From where? Everywhere.\n\nPromenade doesn't get much more specific. This song is almost a list poem, in the way that Alanis Morissette songs are list poems. But there's less creepy men in the background of these songs.\n\nIt's cliche, but tracks tend to lap out of each other on waves in this album. This is especially true of the way Bass Trap, the first completely instrumental track falls out of \"Promenade\". It also feels very liquid. It's the kind of relaxing music you could imagine hearing at a bar near a beach, and yet I associate it, and most of the songs on this album as Winter Songs. It's like floating comfortably in an ocean when you can see snow on the shore.\n\nIn our universe In A Lifetime is a Clannad song. \"Who's Clannad?\" ask those of you not around in the eighties and early nineties. Clannad is an Irish folk/new age band that produced Enya. \"In A Lifetime\" is a traditional Irish song that features Máire Brennan and Bono trading off on vocals. It's very mid-80s Irish folk rock that fits perfectly within the context of this album. Even though it has a saxophone in it.\n\n4th Of July (The Three Sunrises) is actually two U2 tracks from our universe edited together. Like \"Bass Trap\", \"4th Of July\" is entirely instrumental. But I like it as the dark, stormy beginning (again it feels simultaneously wintery and liquid) with the optimistic riffs and vocals of \"The Three Sunrises\" bursting out of it.\n\nLike \"The Three Sunrises\", in our universe Boomerang II is a B-side. While most of the songs on this album are verses without choruses, \"Boomerang II\" is a chant. Soul wind blows is repeated over and over again, with occasional other lyrics inserted between them. I. Um. So. I hate this lyric. I have, for thirty years, thought the repeated lyric was So it goes, which I like much better. I'm going to pretend I never found out that I was wrong. So in my universe So it goes is the correct lyric. We'll give song cowriting credit to Kurt Vonnegut.\n\nWe are over 3/4s of the way through the album, and we've just arrived at the first single. Pride (In The Name Of Love) really belongs on War. It's anthemic. It has a proper verse/chorus structure. It's Very Political (though inaccurate, King did not die on the early morning of April 4th, but the early evening). It starts off comparing Martin Luther King (also the subject of \"MLK\") and Malcolm X. But it abandons that and eventually becomes, ummm, a sort of aimless anthem. Again, very War. It's being the first single from this album is a good false flag to get people to buy this album, expecting more of the same, only to find a completely different album.\n\nA Sort Of Homecoming is another of my favorite U2 tracks. In my head, there's a video for this song that involves walking through a wintry landscape. I guess that video exists exclusively in the alternate universe, since the video from this universe is just live footage from a concert. I'm wondering if maybe I started listening to this album during the winter of my sophomore year of high school, when I had to trek across a two football fields worth of a snow covered campus, and its ingrained into my associations with this album. (I mean there is a repeated lyric in the song about your heart beats so slow/ through the rain and fallen snow, so maybe it's just that.)\n\nSticking with the heart, but abandoning the snow in order to get back to the ocean, we arrive at Indian Summer Sky. A song to celebrate the Solstice! On this the longest day.\n\nClosing out the album is the second single, Bad, an almost omnipresent part of their live show, it's often medlied into other songs, including \"Satellite Of Love\", \"Sympathy For The Devil\", \"Walk On The Wildside\", \"Ruby Tuesday\", \"Come On Down\", \"Biko\", \"Candle In The Wind\", \"All I Want Is You\", \"The Drugs Don't Work\", \"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\", \"40\", \"Moment Of Surrender\", \"Mother And Son Reunion\", and \"Fool To Cry\" among others. While U2 already had a pretty decent following, their live performance of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" and \"Bad\" as a part of Live Aid made them international stars. The closing lines I'm wide awake/I'm not sleeping make a great contrast to the opening lines of the album Sleep/Sleep tonight/And may your dreams be realized.\n\n***\n\nI managed a music store in the mid to late 90s. Part of our routine was to keep our Employee Recommendation Area changing every week or so. The Unforgettable Fire, along with Radiohead's The Bends, Soundgarden's Superunknown, Soul Coughing's Ruby Vroom, Salt-N-Pepa's Very Necessary, and Tom Petty's Wildflowers was always in rotation.\n\nBecause this is the album I've made the least amount of changes to, I've kept the cover of the original album, but moved the title, and added the track listing for this version.\n\nHope you enjoy.\n\nthe_unforgettable_fire.zipFile Size: 71966 kbFile Type: zip\n\nDownload File\n\nSome of my favorite science fiction and comic stories involve alternate universes. Worlds very similar to our own but with a few slight differences. Kennedy survives the parade in Dallas, and his presidency somehow influences a world where Right Wing Extremism never becomes popular in the United States. John Lennon and Paul McCartney end up as a couple, progressing Gay Rights across the globe, decades ahead of our own universe. Nelson Mandela avoids arrest, and advances the dismantling of Apartheid a quarter century before our Most Unfortunate Timeline. The idea of New Coke is laughed out of a marketing meeting in 1985, and Capitalism is toppled.\n\nIn the timeline of this blog series, U2's management was sent reeling during the release of Boytopia, as, much like in our timeline, the band is nearly split up by The Edge, Bono and Mullen's involvement in the Shalom Foundation. Their universe's Paul McGuinness makes a world changing decision when he encourages the band to keep their lavish lifestyle, faith, and overt politics onstage and in their lyrics, but to avoid the spotlight when not touring. The band gives few interviews, and when they do, they focus entirely on their music. They still embrace the music video format, but all non-performance based documentary footage is hidden in a vault until Bono's death. This mystique keeps the band from facing the backlash to Rattle & Hum, Pop, and virtually all of their 21st century albums (of which there are fewer).\n\nWar is the band's response to the concept of keeping their politics and faith in their music, as it's a series of political statements with a massive drum focus, a deliberate nod to Mullen Jr's importance as The Man Who Put The Band Together.\n\nIsland Records really wanted Sunday Bloody Sunday, clearly the standout song on the album, to be the opener. Record companies love the idea that a fan will buy a record and as soon as they put needle to groove, finger to play button, out come the album's biggest hit. If the rest of the record is just lesser takes on the same song, that's fine, the audience gets what they paid for right off the bat.\n\nSteve Lillywhite, once again the album's producer, liked the album being bookended by its most meta songs about songs. He also enjoyed the band's live performance habit of having Mullen Jr be the first and last person on stage, so the album starts and ends with drums. Like A Song is the mission statement for War. Here we are. We are our own interpretation of punk. And we're going to leave behind our introspection and be a politically-centric arena rock band. Don't like it? Then you're going to hate this album.\n\nThe drums morph slightly from the end of \"Like A Song\" into Refugee. A song that, were it less ambiguous might be more evergreen. As it is, it's another catchy drum-focused anthem which feels more earnest than enlightening.\n\nLike \"October\" on the previous album, Endless Deep features The Edge on piano, as opposed to guitar. It's mostly wordless Where do we go from here? being the only lyric. While not as successful as its predecessor, it's a nice stylistic break from the rest of the album. Many critics say it doesn't quite fit, and should have been a B-Side (as it was in our universe), but I like it as a hint of what's in store on The Unforgettable Fire.\n\nWhile \"Endless Deep\" also featured the marching band/anthem bass drum line so prevalent on this album, it's even more focused on Seconds. Also, the opening stanzas are sung by The Edge, who's usually relegated to background vocals. The sample from the 1982 documentary \"Soldier Girls\", and frequent muttering under the vocals that the band will go Way Overboard with when they record Zooropa, is a cool departure here on War. As a statement on nuclear war, it's hardly revolutionary, but the nuclear dance party motif makes it seem slightly more playful than other tracks on the album.\n\nDon't get used to that, though. Once again, the drums shift ever so slightly as we move into the album's third single, Sunday Bloody Sunday. Perennial favorite, and one of the band's biggest hits, \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" is the focal point of the War Tour, with Bono usually doing some literal flag waving about 1972's Bloody Sunday revolution in Derry Ireland where British troops shot and killed unarmed protestors. This is the song that propelled them to Arena Rock Heroes in The United States. With its electric violin line, and peppy major chord progressions, there is a dissonance between the music and lyrics that works in the song's favor, even if it was largely an accident. The song also returns to the \"this song\" motif from \"Like A Song\", which will come back again for \"40\".\n\nYet again, the pounding of the bass drum leads us from track to track, as we arrive at Red Light. A dancey love song that follows the drum rules of the album, but otherwise is somewhat out of place, the song includes a trumpet and a three woman vocal group, The Coconuts. The non-anthemic nature is a fun departure, and flows sweetly into \"Angels Too Tied To The Ground\".\n\nGiven the iconic nature of Bono waving the white flag during a live performance of \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\", it's interesting that the image pops up in a lyric in this love song, Angels Too Tied To The Ground. Bono's voice is ill-suited for the first few verses, which are almost spoken. In our universe, he does this same trick for almost an entire album on the soundtrack to Million Dollar Hotel. Luckily for the denizens of this alternate universe, that movie doesn't exist, and only two songs from it show up in U2's discography. The highlight of the song is The Edge on piano again.\n\nThe first single from the "
