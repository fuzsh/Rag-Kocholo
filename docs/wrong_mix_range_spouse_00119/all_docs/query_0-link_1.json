        "text": "Last week, a dilemma arose as my 10-year-old prepared for her device-free sleep-away camp. She's an avid Duolingo user, and her 149-day streak was suddenly in jeopardy with camp looming. Instead of dwelling on the potential loss, she focused on maintaining her streak. So, I suggested that she write a letter. I thought that would put an end to her quest until she asked me for my email address a few minutes later so she could copy my husband and me! As we read her letter, we were both struck by the clarity with which she conveyed her needs and request. Self-advocacy is a powerful tool for negotiating what you want and your career growth. Many women, especially Women of Color, face gender and racial bias that impedes their ability to advocate for themselves. My daughter's letter offers a brilliant example of self-advocacy in action because she: Demonstrated self-awareness: She understood the \"why\" behind her goal. She wasn't just worried about losing a number; she recognized the motivational power of maintaining her streak. She took ownership and confidently communicated her needs. Instead of accepting the situation, she took the initiative to contact Duolingo directly. Clearly articulated her situation and needs: She wanted her streak held while she was at camp. Provided relevant information: Her username and current streak made it easier for Duolingo to assist her. Acknowledged and navigated conflicting viewpoints. She included context about her summer camp, her parents' perspective on screen time and her desire to continue learning. She expressed gratitude and appreciation for their time and consideration. While Duolingo couldn't freeze her streak immediately, they delighted her by offering to reinstate it upon her return. This experience wasn't just about maintaining her streak; it was a powerful lesson in self-belief, self-knowledge, and a deep sense of empowerment that comes from advocating for what matters to you. It's a lesson that will undoubtedly empower my daughter to face future challenges and to continue advocating for herself with confidence. What steps can you take to advocate for your needs and goals more effectively in your personal or professional life? #LeadershipDevelopment #SelfAdvocacy #SelfAwareness ♻️ Share this post to inspire self-advocacy and empower others—it's a ripple effect of positive change!"
