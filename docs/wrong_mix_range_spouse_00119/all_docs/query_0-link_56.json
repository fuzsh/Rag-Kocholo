In addition to the managing the machine shop, he will be overseeing the maintenance department and product engineering.\n\n10/1/17 – Placid Point Lighting, a dependable light source for outdoor living, announces the official release of their low voltage, eco-friendly LED lighting system on October 1, 2017.\n\nExclusively distributed by Superior Plastic Products and Key-Link Fencing & Railing, this heavy-duty product line is specifically designed for use with vinyl and aluminum fencing and railing systems, ensuring a seamless fit and superior function.\n\n“The Placid Point Lighting system will complement both Key-Link and Superior’s railing and fencing systems to enhance outdoor living spaces where decking, railing, and fencing is being used,” said Amos Kauffman, VP of Sales & Marketing for Key-Link. “Placid Point Lighting will fill a need that has been expressed by dealers and installers alike.”\n\nDesigned for longevity, Placid Point Lighting’s circuitry is sealed to protect against dust and moisture for years of durability. Plus, the easy-to-install “Plug & Play” configuration eliminates installation errors, which means you’ll get a reliable glow every time you turn them on.\n\nSuperior Plastic Products and affiliated companies manufacture aluminum and vinyl railing and fence products as well as distribute building materials to the LBM Industry. For almost 40 years our focus has been providing quality building products that offer SAFETY, STYLE, and SECURITY to the residential and commercial markets.
