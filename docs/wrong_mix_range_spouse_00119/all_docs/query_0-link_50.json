There are many resources available in the command; however, the information may be varied due to the era in which the resource was created. It is generally easier to research officers who served in the Navy than enlisted men and women.\n\nHow do I begin?\n\nI’m looking for a person by name.\n\nI’m looking for a person by timeframe.\n\nI’m looking for a person by office.\n\nI’m looking for a person by school, training, or ship.\n\nI’m looking for a person by award or casualty information.\n\nI’m looking for information on Civilians.\n\nOther Sources\n\nBy Name\n\nSearching for a military member by name is often the easiest method of finding the information you seek. It is helpful to know the full name of the individual in question, their birth date, and the years in which they served.\n\nOfficial Service and Medical Records - A good first step in locating information is to request the individual’s official service and medical records. This link provides further information on what these records contain and specifically how to request the records. You will need to request these records from the National Archives and Record Administration.\n\nRegister of the Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps - Officer Registers are annually published lists of Officers and Warrant Officers. The registers generally provide name, rank, and varied military service information. The older registers provide more detailed information and the Registers between the 1920s and 1970s provide Service Numbers, a key piece of information when requesting service records from this time period. The Navy Department Library holds the following US Naval Officer Registers.\n\nActive Duty 1814 – 1994 in print\n\nReserve Register 1917- 1992 sporadic volumes\n\nRetired Register 1962- 1990\n\nNavy and Marine Corps Directories - Navy and Marine Corps Directories are similar to Officer Registers in that they provide lists of officers, however they also provide Officer location information.

The Navy Department Library holds Directories from 1908 to 1942.\n\nAnnual Report of the Secretary of the Navy - Several of the older Secretary of the Navy Reports contain lists of widowers and pensioners of the United Stated Navy. These provide no more than a name and how much the individual received.\n\nOfficial Register of the United States - This is a listing of persons employed by the Federal Government, organized by branch, department, agency and office. In addition to civilians, commissioned officers are listed, but the information provided corresponds generally with what can be found in the Register of the Commissioned and Warrant Officers of the United States Navy and Marine Corps. This source is particularly valuable for identifying officers assigned as naval attaches. The Navy Department Library has a collection ranging from 1831 to 1959.\n\nCallahan, Edward W., ed.
