See you soon! #MadmenBowling2024\n\nFor those looking to shave a few strokes off their golf game, may we suggest “studying the effects of environmental elements on the human genome”? It certainly works wonders for this golfer in one of our new ads debuting at the American Century Championship tomorrow. So, grip it and rip it or break out the yardage marker because whatever you’re doing, if you invest with us, you’ll also be helping to support medical breakthroughs because 40% of our profits fund research for cures. #AmericanCenturyChampionship #ACCGolf #CelebGolf #LakeTahoeGolf #EdgewoodTahoe #CelebrityGolf #GolfTournament #TahoeViews #GolfFans\n\n“I have another brief to give to you. TV concepting. You game?” With those twelve tiny words TiNY leapt into an incredible partnership with our friends at American Century. Within two weeks we had already landed on an idea that could launch a thousand executions. Two of those are debuting tomorrow during the American Century Championship golf tournament. \"Gimme A Break\" https://lnkd.in/exk2ya3W \"Hello, Ball\" https://lnkd.in/eMrzXHHk We are eternally grateful to Evan Silver, Ryan Ennis and the fast-moving, comedic maestros at Reform School, our not-so-secret weapons tina mintus, Bernadette Quinn and “Magic” Michael McKenna at Carousel, mix-master Glen Landrum at Harbor Picture Company and the inimitable Tim Masick at Company 3. TiNY is mighty, thanks to this team. Our shout-outs would be wholly incomplete if we didn’t shout out to our American Century client partners. Making great work with great people and having a great time doing it is what we set out to do as TiNY. Wylie Kain and Erik Schneberger - you made that vision a reality on the very first go. And, yes, we are game to do it again. #tinyismighty #advertising #marketing #adagency #CMO #campaign Tom Christmann Mike Rovner Michael Stoopack"
