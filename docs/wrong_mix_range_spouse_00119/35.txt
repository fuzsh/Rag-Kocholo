7:01 - First chill moment of the evening already. God bless Brent Musburger's melodrama. Love that guy.

7:03 - Brent just said "Let this sink in" for the second time already. Oh, and Chase looks really cocky right now. My wife even noticed that.

Speaking of my wife, she has the early candidate for line of the night: "Tim Tebow's like the Hillary Clinton of college football players. The media decided he was going to win a few weeks ago, and there's nothing he could do to change that."

Well said...though I will say that Tebow has done nothing to change anybody's mind in the last couple games.

7:04 - Screw you, Perry Farrell.

7:08 - And screw you, Craig James. "Mizzou has a great offense, but when I talked to Mark Mangino early this week, he said he thought they can stop them." Brilliant analysis.

7:09 - Uh oh...gold pants...KANSAS HAS NO CHANCE!!

7:13 - Here we go. Gggh...still not mentally prepared for this. Missouri to receive...had no idea that was coming...

7:14 - Maclin takes the up a huge hole in the middle...and trips over Earl Goldsmith near the 40.

7:15 - I don't know what it is, but Arrowhead's grass is extremely recognizable. I'd know where this game is even if I didn't know where this game is.

7:15 - Two quick passes, and we've got our first third down of the game...third-and-8. KU's defense is quite strong in the first quarter, so I'm predicting a stop here.

7:16 - DAMN...jinx didn't work. Daniel had Saunders open, but it was a really tough touch pass and floated over Saunders' head. Mizzou to punt. Cross your fingers.

7:17 - Sweet! Decent punt by Crossett, and Webb is tackled after a loss of about 10 on the return. KU will start at their 18.

7:18 - I really do think KU will start fast...but a quick three-and-out would be phenomenal. Starts well, as Mizzou eats up the option on first down.

7:19 - Dexton Fields with a drop (he was about to get crushed by Carl Gettis), and it's 3rd-and-9 for KU. Big play early.

7:19 - Three and out for KU! Maclin calls fair catch, and we've got our first TV timeout.

7:22 - My wife just called Kansas "stupid dumbasses" for driving in from Lawrence today and getting stuck in traffic. EVERYBODY'S FIRED UP TONIGHT!

7:23 - Tough run by Temple, followed by another eaten-up pass to Maclin. Let's not go to the well too often early there. Third-and-9 for Mizzou.

7:23 - Daniel scrambles for a couple yards, and Mizzou will punt again. Nice coverage early for KU. Like I said, they're a great Q1 team.

7:25 - William Moore with a fantastic run blitz, stopping McAnderson in the backfield on first down.

7:26 - Third-and-3 for KU...the first makeable third down of the game for either team.

7:26 - Jinx worked! Reesing had to double-clutch and threw a bad pass. Four punts to start the game...that's what everybody predicted, right?

7:27 - First big play of the game...not surprisingly, it's Jeremy Maclin on the punt return. That kid's not bad. Mizzou inside the KU 40!

7:28 - Saunders with a TOUGH catch-and-run for a first down. Mizzou to the 20.

7:29 - Matt Winer breaks in to tell us how great Tim Tebow was today. My wife is NOT impressed, lol.

7:29 - Two more touches for Maclin (don't wear him out!), and it brings up a 3rd-and-5 for Mizzou at the 15. Nevermind...personal foul on Will Franklin. 'Kay. Third-and-20.

7:30 - Oh that's crap. Talib baited him into that...the refs only saw Franklin push back. Meanwhile, Alexander is tackled short of the first. Wolfert on for the FG.

7:31 - That was a stupid fake. Quick pass to Franklin, but there were four guys waiting for him. Might have worked on 4th-and-2, but...don't run fakes on 4th-and-12. We really just needed points there. Momentum back to KU.

7:32 - Third-and-short for KU. EXTREMELY makeable (ahem). Kirk likes the fake FG because it shows Mizzou is being the aggressor. I just wanted the points.

7:33 - Jinx unsuccessful...McAnderson with the first down.

7:34 - Quickly, another third down for KU. Third-and-6 from the KU 40. Less than 5 minutes left in Q1...

7:34 - Fields got Moore tangled up and on the ground, but he couldn't find the ball, and it's another KU punt. Another Maclin fair catch.

7:38 - Brent does NOT like the fake FG call...especially since it was 4th-and-10+. I like the risk-taking...I just don't like it there.

7:39 - Another nice run by Temple. Keep it up, Tony.

7:40 - KU eats up the O-line on the option, and Daniel is wise in not pitching it and eating the five-yard loss.

7:40 - Danario Alexander to midfield! Best sixth option in the country.

7:41 - ANOTHER big Temple run...MAN does he love a) November, and b) playing Kansas. Meanwhile, my wife just realized she's even more nervous than I am at the moment. I found myself a good one.

7:42 - Alexander gets the first down on a DEBACLE of a double reverse. Wow, that should not have worked, but Alexander somehow snuck his 6'5 frame through about 8 tackles.

7:43 - Saunders with a gorgeous inside screen to the 5, but he fumbles. Yes, we recovered, but I'm pretty sure my wife's about to vomit. And it's not even the second quarter yet. First and goal.

7:44 - Goldsmith?? Uhh...what happened to Jimmy Jackson and Derrick Washington? Wasted down. And my wife just said she's thinking of taking up smoking. Second-and-goal.

7:44 - Third-and-goal as Maclin barely missed a nice TD catch. And now he's shaken up...kinda carrying himself like a separated shoulder. Seriously, wife about to vomit.

7:45 - Temple with a lovely run down to the 1...and I pretty much guarantee we're going for it. Hoo boy.

7:46 - Inside screen to Motherrucker for the TD on fourth-and-goal. Deep exhalation. He bobbled it for a second, but that play has worked every damn time this season. 7-0 Mizzou. Buckle up.

7:49 - Dell has hired Burt Reynolds to sell computers. I LOVE it. Reminds me of when my roommate dressed up as Burt for Halloween...best costume ever, other than my 2002 attempt at Anna Nicole, of course.

7:50 - My wife: "Apparently I hate Kansas." Welcome to the Mizzou family, dear. Now say "Quantrill half-assed it," and I'll go shoe-shopping with you any time you want.

7:51 - Another nice stop on first down for Mizzou...KU's a first-down offense. Big gains on first set up makeable plays on second- and third-downs, and they're not getting that so far.

7:51 - End of Q1. Thank god. I've got to effing pee.

7:54 - And I'm back. We should be up 10-0, but I have to say I'm extremely pleased so far. I mentioned that I'd be paying attention to

7:55 - I take every compliment back. Kerry Meier with a 40-yard reception. Mixed-up coverage...I think Del Howard screwed up again.

7:55 - William Moore for Defensive Player of the Year!! ANOTHER huge INT for Willy Mo. Wow, wow, wow. Reesing is stunned. His first INT in 213 pass attempts...Chase's record of 254 is safe.

7:57 - Okay, they're reviewing to see if Moore's momentum carried him into the endzone or if he could have pulled up. Nevermind. He INT'd it at the 2, and even though his momentum carried him into the endzone, it's Mizzou's ball at the 2. Didn't know that was the rule.

7:58 - Temple with ANOTHER huge run, this one to the 20. My oh my is he on his game tonight.

7:59 - Jimmy Jackson out past the 35! As Brent just said, we are GASHING them on the ground tonight. And I'm using a GABE DEARMOND level of capital letters tonight.

8:00 - Danario Alexander with another strong catch-and-run, and it's first down near midfield.

8:02 - Thrust nunchuk upward! First down at the KU 38, and Chase Daniel is 12-for-15.

8:03 - After Jimmy Jackson is eaten up in the backfield and Will Franklin gets a short catch, it's 3rd-and-12 for Mizzou at the 40. Here comes the blitz.

8:04 - Or not. Chase led Franklin a bit too much, and he is crushed. Mizzou to punt. Good stand by KU. Nevermind! Defensive Holding! First down!

8:05 - My wife just noticed that the lower half of Mangino's face matches his blue jacket.

8:06 - ANOTHER big catch by Alexander...4 catches for 60 yards already. Secret weapon...you get the idea we were holding off on throwing the ball to him until the time was right.

8:06 - First-and-goal, and Temple is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. KU has fixed the holes in its run D.

8:07 - Daniel throws it away under pressure, and it's third-and-goal from the 12.

8:08 - God, do I love Chase Daniel. He scrambled back to the freaking 34 yard line, ran to the 20, and found a wide-open Alexander for a TD. 14-0 Mizzou, and I hope people haven't already cast their vote for Tim Tebow. Watch Chase for a couple more games first. Golden freaking watermelon balls of freaking fury.

8:11 - KU will take over just past the 30 after another high directional kick. I like it...keep the ball out of Herford's hands.

8:12 - Hello, Carl Peterson!

8:12 - Del Howard with a nice hit on Dezmon Briscoe downfield, but Briscoe held on to the ball.. KU to the Mizzou 36.

8:13 - Wow...the Chiefs kick off at Arrowhead at noon. Didn't realize that. My apologies to everybody who steps in a divot tomorrow.

8:13 - Third-and-4 from the 30...Reesing throws incomplete, but Gettis held Marcus Henry. Bummer.

8:15 - McAnderson has to dance to get 4 yards...I do like how the D-line is playing so far...but last time I said that, KU immediately completed a long pass, so I take it back.

8:15 - Third-and-6 from the 16 after a pass deflection. NNNNNNNNOONAN!

8:16 - Pass bounces off of Briscoe's hands (or shoulder pads), and KU will settle for the FG. Kick all the FG's you want tonight, Mangino.

8:17 - Off the upright, and it's still 14-0!!

8:18 - Just got a call from a buddy who's going stir crazy watching the game by himself at home. He's going out at halftime.

8:21 - This has the scent of one of those "Mizzou takes this possession off" possessions...a hold, followed by a short Temple run and a short Coffman catch, and it's 3rd-and-12. Just don't make a mistake.

8:22 - Jinx successful! Rucker for 15 and a first down!

8:23 - Tommy Saunders to the KU 45! Chase is 18-for-22 for 161.

8:24 - Temple with a GORGEOUS 5-yard run. He was cut off deep in the backfield, spun a couple times, and made something positive out of that. 9 carries, 68 yards for TT.

8:24 - Third-and-4, and Franklin gets about 3...gotta figure we go for it again. Aggressive coaching, baby.

8:25 - Fourth-and-1...and we shouldn't have tried the Rucker screen again. That was the most predictable playcall available, and KU makes the stop. Not quite the throatstomp I was hoping for.

8:28 - Alright, defense. Time to make a play.

8:28 - Okay, I meant it was time to make a GOOD play. Long pass to Fields, and Sulak roughed Reesing. First down at the Mizzou 16 already. Crap.

8:29 - Two deflected passes (one almost picked), and it's third-and-10. I guess if anybody knows how to defend against a short QB, it's Mizzou. Force another field goal, boys.

8:30 - Sulak with a huge sack-and-strip...KU recovers, but it's a tougher FG now. A 44-yarder.

8:31 - Another miss!!! Still 14-0!! Webb's going to be a headcase from here on out.

8:35 - Once again, Chase Daniel scrambles out of trouble...getting the first down and avoiding a hit. LOVE that guy. First downs: MU 15, KU 6.

8:36 - First relatively poor pass for Chase since the Saunders overthrow. Rivera could have picked it if he were a step faster. On second down, Daniel is sacked, and it's third-and-long. Less than a minute left in the half.

8:36 - Temple is run out of bounds, and Mizzou will punt with 0:18 left in the half. Feels weird not scoring in the two-minute drill. But let's just go in up 14-0 at this point...no mistakes now.

8:38 - Another boomer...downed at the 14 with :07 left. KU will presumably down it and go into the locker room with a goose egg. Mangino is stoic and misunderstands the question from Random Female Sideline Reporter. Back in a bit.

8:40 - Oh wait...I have to hear what Craig James has to say. Daniel is confident. Got it. Flutie has noticed how physical Missouri has played. And NOW I'll be back in a bit...I guess in rptgwb's second-half open thread...

9:01 - And the second half begins. Instead of the high directional kick, it was a squib right at an up guy, and KU will start near midfield. Not a fan of that. My gut says KU scores on this drive.

9:02 - My wife's gut disagrees.

9:02 - Third-and-3 for KU...this would be a HUGE stop early. Not to be, as Fine makes a nice catch for the first...and Bridges with a 15-yard face mask. Ouch. KU already to the Mizzou 17.

9:04 - An incompletion and a stuffed run, and it's 3rd-and-9.

9:05 - My wife's gut was dead on. Reesing was WAY behind his receiver, Bridges picked it, and returned it to the KU 40. HUGE. Reesing is way off his game. Throat. Stomp. Now.

9:06 - Nice run by Derrick Washington on the screen pass. First down at the KU 27.

9:08 - Direct snap to Rucker for the first time in a few games. He fakes the pass and gets a couple yards before Joe Mortensen lights him up pretty good. That play worked early in the season, but it's too predictable now.

9:09 - Will Franklin with a TOUGH run to the 1, where it will be first-and-goal! KU is not tackling well...

9:10 - TD, Jimmy Jackson! Stay calm, stay calm, stay calm...I'm talking to myself, not Mizzou. 21-0.

9:13 - This is KU's biggest deficit of the season. Well duh.

9:14 - Another pooch kick, and it hits the ground...a lucky bounce, and that would have landed right in Tremane Vaughns' hands. First-and-10 KU at their 32.

9:15 - Nice screen to Briscoe for a first down...first down at the KU 47.

9:16 - Nice run by McAnderson for about 7, but I guess he was down before he fumbled. Yup, he was down.

9:17 - Dammit, Mizzou's challenging the call. That's a wasted timeout.

9:19 - Uhh, they're showing MU-KU basketball highlights during the back-from-commercial, "Brought to you by..." segment. Weird.

9:20 - Yup, wasted timeout. That, or it wasn't a challenge, and they just called timeout. In which case...well, still not a well-placed timeout.

9:20 - Diving reception by Dezmon Briscoe to the Mizzou 5. He's brought his A-game today...we almost got to Reesing again, but he made a nice throw, and Justin Garrett was burned. Moment of silence for Pig Brown. KU's earned these points...assuming they score.

9:21 - Third-and-goal from about the 1.5 yardline. Mangino? Still looking a little stunned.

9:22 - TD, Kansas. McAnderson was just a little too big for Moore to drag down in the open field. Still PLENTY of time left in the game (7:22 in Q3), and it's 21-7.

9:25 - Deep breaths.

9:26 - Maclin returns it to about the 31...he never actually had a chance to break that one, but it feels like he does every time he touches the ball. Alright, boys...keep scoring.

9:28 - After an 8-yarder to Rucker, Temple breaks a nice run for a Mizzou first down. Temple has 98 yards rushing so far.

9:28 - Musberger just called the Mizzou spread an "acquired taste for Gary Pinkel"...yeah...that's one way to say it.

9:29 - Third-and-1 from the KU 44. Herbstreit just called this an "important drive" 13 times in one sentence.

9:30 - First down, Jimmy Jackson!

9:31 - Maclin with a gorgeous run for a TD, but a flag was thrown. This pretty much has to be against us. Yup, holding on Franklin. Will has had an extremely forgettable game. And MAN did Maclin make that run look easy...just froze one guy at a time all the way down the field. But now it's 2nd-and-10 instead.

9:32 - KU brings the blitz and doesn't even touch Daniel, who calmly fires to Alexander for 17 yards.

9:33 - Nice pass to Saunders, and it's third-and-3 from the KU 17. HUGE play for KU right here...holding us to a FG would be at least a small victory. Chase is 28-for-33, by the way.

9:34 - Timeout, Mizzou.

9:35 - Daniel finds Saunders again, and it's another Mizzou first down. He's had great protection, and he's been able to consistently find his second, third, and fourth option on pass plays.

9:36 - False start on Ryan Madison...I still don't think we've had a ton of penalties today, but we've had a ton for us. It's 8 for 85...nevermind, that's a lot for anybody.

9:37 - It's Alexander again, down to the 2.

9:38 - Third-and-1 from the 2...this drive just went over 5:30...screen to Washington, and he FREAKING SCORES. HELL YEAH. KU fans all just realized "They're way better than us". 28-7.

9:40 - Another squib kick, but this one squirts through to the 25...KU returns to the 35. That's just fine.

9:41 - Nice pass to Fields out past midfield, first down Kansas. Once again, we've blanketed their #1 option (Henry), and that's opened up some opportunities for the #2 and #3 options (Fields and Briscoe). Credit Reesing for not forcing it to Henry.

9:42 - Do NOT credit Reesing for throwing one straight into the ground right there.

9:43 - Reesing is hit as he throws, and it's incomplete...his arm was certainly moving forward, but the whistle came really late. I got my hopes up for a sec.

9:44 - All-out blitz on third-and-10...Reesing avoids the rush and takes off, but Bridges cuts him off 3 yards short. KU has no choice but to go for it.

9:44 - KU's last gasp right here...fourth-and-3...and the quarter ends first. On to the 4th...15 minutes away from San Antonio...

9:47 - Alright, here we go...fourth-and-3...Reesing scrambles and finds Marcus Henry at the last freaking second. Del Howard was a step too late.

9:48 - Dammit...late pass interference call on Moore, and it'll be first-and-goal from the 10. It might have been a penalty, but the ref 5 yards away didn't call it...the back judge called it. Hate that.

9:49 - KU has to burn a timeout.

9:51 - HUGE penalty on KU...Anthony Collins tore Ziggy Hood's helmet off, and it's first and 26...

9:52 - Sulak lights Reesing up and almost forces a fumble. But then Willy Mo commits a personal foul WAY after the play. Pretty weak personal foul, really, but it's first-and-10 from the 14. We're making them eat up more clock, at least.

9:53 - Third-and-2 for Kansas from the Mizzou 5 after another nice catch by Briscoe...he has 72 yards receiving. All-out blitz forces a bad pass. You know it was a bad pass if it was too high for Marcus Henry. Dude's like 7'0 tall.

9:54 - Fourth-and-2, and KU has to go for it. Naked bootleg for Reesing, and he scores. Weatherspoon hit him pretty good, but he got in. 13:02 left, and it's 28-14. One more score for Mizzou, and I'll feel comfortable.

9:57 - Kirk is pulling for Helio Castroneves in Dancing with the Stars. Good to know.

9:58 - Jeremy Maclin just had the most exciting 5-yard kick return ever. They tried to pooch it away from him, and he sprinted up to catch it...dropped it...hopped over two KU defenders, broke a tackle, almost broke it open...then went down. My heart just stopped.

9:59 - Daniel goes deep to Maclin, and Thornton hit him a hair before the ball got there. No call. Awesome. Even Herbstreit says bad call.

10:00 - Temple breaks a nice gain to midfield, but there's a flag down, and I'm sure it's on us. Illegal substitution. Ugh. We need a damn call here. It's 2nd-and-15, and my stomach's knotting up.

10:01 - Maclin takes a swing pass and gets the first down easily. Knot loosens up. Daniel is 11-for-12 in the second half. Can't wait to see what our success rate is for this game.

10:02 - Musberger just called Russell Brorsen "Bronson"...which is way cooler.

10:03 - Nice spot for Maclin as he takes another swing pass and races to the first down marker. First-and-10, though I'd like for the clock to run on a few more of these. Still 11:53 left.

10:03 - ANOTHER freaking flag...holding on Kurtis Gregory. That's 126 yards in penalties today. 1st-and-20.

10:04 - MOTHERRUCKER. Defender falls down, and Rucker gets a first down to the KU 29. TICK...T-T-T-TIIIICK...

10:05 - Franklin drops a pass that would have gone for a first down. DAMN is he having a bad game. That brings up a third-and-6 from the 26 or so.

10:05 - Good pressure, and Daniel has to throw it away. Long field goal coming, a 43-yarder.

10:06 - Freaking automatic. Wolfert nails the 43-yarder, and it's 31-14 with 9:55 left. Hope the clock operator is an MU fan.

10:09 - Marcus Herford actually gets his hands on a kickoff for once and returns it to the KU 43.

10:11 - A couple quick passes, and KU's to the MU 42 with just 14 seconds off the clock. 9:41 left.

10:12 - Third-and-5 from the MU 37...nice fade to Meier for a first down at the MU 15. KU's WR's are making nice catches on the deep balls. TICK...TICK...T-T-T-TICK...under 9 minutes left...

10:13 - TD, Dexton Fields. Another nice fade route, and I'm pretty sure it was Justin Garrett who was once again beaten. This wouldn't be a game if Pig Brown was healthy. Just sayin'. 31-21.

10:17 - Alright, Mizzou ball at their 37 with 8:25 left. Oh, nevermind. Mizzou called timeout before the kickoff. Weird. That's their last timeout, and KU will kick again.

10:21 - It's a pooch kick, covered well, and Mizzou will take over at their 26.

10:22 - Sliding catch by Maclin at the MU 47...first down, baby. Under 8 minutes to go...

10:23 - Another end around to Maclin, another hold. Ugh. This time on Rucker. Instead of 3rd-and-2, it's 2nd-and-16. Short dump to Maclin, and it's 3rd-and-14. Oy. 7:00 to go...

10:24 - DANARIO FREAKING ALEXANDER. Ran to the first down marker, and the ball was waiting for him. Sixteen-yard gain, and it's first down from the KU 42. 8 catches, 117 yards for Alexander. My wife just pronounced his first name Dan-a-rino. I like that better.

10:26 - Good GOD do I love Chase Daniel. He pump-faked a couple times, scrambled, bought a ton of time...and found a wide open Maclin for another first down at the KU 30. That puts Mizzou over 500 yards of offense.

10:27 - Temple just lost about 5 yards, and I'm pretty sure he's back under 100 yards...under 5 minutes to go...

10:28 - Third-and-9 for Mizzou, and KU will call a timeout with 4:21 remaining.

10:29 - Chase runs for about 5 yards, and that will bring Wolfert out again. This will be a 43-yarder...

10:30 - Freaking automatic. That kick looked exactly like the last one, and it's 34-21 with 3:31 left.

10:31 - Another squib, and it's returned by Jake Sharp to the 36. One more stop, guys. One more stop.

10:32 - Kirk and Musberger are trying to come up with the craziest BCS scenario imagineable. Meanwhile, Dexton Fields makes a nice catch-and-run to the Mizzou 40. TICK...TICK...T-T-T-TIIIIIIICK...

10:33 - Todd Reesing has 316 yards passing. Who knew?

10:34 - Third-and-3 for KU with 3:05 remaining...ONE MORE FREAKING STOP, GUYS.

10:34 - Ziggy Hood almost gets the sack...Justin Garrett almost gets the pick...and it's fourth-and-3.

10:34 - Reesing scrambles to the 26...ugh. 2:47 left, and KU's got another first down.

10:35 - Garrett has another almost-pick...ugh. Ugh, ugh, ugh. ONE MORE STOP.

10:35 - Meier with another first down to the 15. 2:28 left.

10:36 - Still paranoid. And Mangino's got to be wearing a 7XL coat.

10:36 - McAnderson battles to the 5 for another first down...UGH. 2:17 left...

10:37 - TD, Marcus Henry. 2:03 left, and it's 34-28. On-side kick coming. I'm going to throw up.

10:38 - Here we go. Please, please, please, please, please recover this. My wife has twirled her hair into one giant knot.

10:39 - I love Tommy Saunders. Mizzou ball.

10:40 - Temple for 2 yards...KU will save their timeout. TICK...TICK...TICK...second down will come with about 1:15 left.

10:40 - Daniel for 4 yards to the KU 35, and KU calls their final timeout with 1:15 left. Third-and-5 for Mizzou coming up. Convert this, and it's over. Don't convert this, and I'm going to pass out.

10:41 - Here we go. Gag. Temple stopped for no gain, and fourth down will come with about 0:30 left...what do you do here? Punt it and try to pin KU at the 1?

10:42 - Delay of game with :27 left, and we'll now punt. I feel so sick to my stomach right now.

10:43 - Talib fields the punt at the 3 and returns it to the 10. KU needs a miracle, but they're playing MU. Miracles happen.

10:44 - Ballgame. The entire Mizzou D-Line meets Reesing in the endzone for a safety. I will now attempt to exhale. It's 36-28 with 0:12 left, Todd Reesing has a face mask full of sod, and Mizzou's about to become the #1 team in the country.

10:45 - I just said Mizzou's about to become the #1 team in the country. As long as they field the free kick, that is.

10:46 - Marcus Woods fields the free kick. That's awesome. God bless you, Marcus. Victory formation coming.

10:47 - Victory formation, gatorade bath, #1 ranking, North title, OU in San Antonio, et cetera. Go crazy, folks. Hoo boy.
