The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:40 p.m. in Room SD-419, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. John F. Kerry, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Kerry, [presiding], Feingold, Menendez, Casey, Shaheen, Lugar, and Risch. OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN F. KERRY, U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS The Chairman. This hearing of the Foreign Relations Committee will come to order. My apologies to all for being a little late. I had a couple thousand veterans, actually, on the phone simultaneously, all of whom have an interest in this and a couple of other issues. We come together today by happenstance on the eighth anniversary of our entry into Afghanistan. Today we begin the ninth year of the war in Afghanistan. If my memory serves me right, I think the war in Vietnam was 10 years, and it was the longest war in American history. So we are obviously in a very different kind of war from that. 869 Americans have died in Operation Enduring Freedom, 220 of our British allies, and 357 from other allied nations, and unknown numbers of civilian causalities and of collateral damage. This is an important time for us to be reevaluating our strategy as we go forward. Senator Lugar and I yesterday came out of the White House meeting and made very clear our sense that it is appropriate to determine the best strategy, the best way forward. Before you start committing X amount of dollars, X number of troops, you have to know exactly what you are trying to achieve and what is achievable. This is also part of a larger challenge to all of us, which is the nature of this ongoing struggle against violent religious extremism, violent radicalized ideology, people who don't hesitate to take civilian lives, sometimes for the most nihilistic of rationales. In fact, sometimes it is very difficult to even wrap some kind of a legitimate description of the rationale around some of these acts. But this is the world we live in today. What we are going to do today is to consider the threat posed by al-Qaeda, specifically, in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and beyond, and to understand the progress that has been made toward our goal of disrupting, dismantling, and defeating the terrorist organization that attacked us on September 11th. This was, as everybody knows, at the center of President Bush's strategy in taking us into Afghanistan originally, together with the near unanimous consent of the United States Congress. and it is critical to understanding what our mission should be as we go forward. This hearing takes place at the center of this backdrop of a significant national debate over the future of American policy toward Afghanistan. And I say significant because what the President decides to do, and what we decide to do, either in consent or dissent, will be critical to the amounts of money that we ask Americans to pay over a long period of time. Much more significantly, in the light of what I said about those lives lost, is number of Americans who will be called on to go abroad and into harm's way and potentially give their lives in furtherance of that policy. So it is important for us to get this right because I dare say we have been down the road before where a year and a half, 2 years, 5 years later, we wind up a Nation deeply divided and debating after the fact why we don't like being where we are or how we got there. So this is the time, and the stakes are high. The specter of a reenergized al-Qaeda safe haven in Afghanistan, I believe, is real. You have to have several scenarios to make that happen, and we are duty bound to examine those scenarios. And the reality of a worrisome al-Qaeda presence in Pakistan is existent and significant in that discussion. As I have said before, the history of past wars has taught us to question our assumptions at every turn in order to ensure that conventional wisdom doesn't harden into dogma. I have also said repeatedly that wars and history don't repeat themselves exactly. There are lessons that you can draw from them and that we should draw from them. But just because something happened a certain way 35 or 40 years ago doesn't mean it is going to happen the same way or that the circumstances are the same today. So we have to be discerning in drawing the similarities, in drawing the distinctions, and of appropriately drawing the right lessons from all of that. In a series of recent hearings before this committee, we have tried to balance some of these questions. We are not finished. But today, we are going to hear about al-Qaeda specifically, about our ongoing efforts against al-Qaeda. Also, we are going to hear about our efforts to counter terror in Afghanistan and Pakistan and how those efforts fit into the larger fight against a global network. Remember, the al-Qaeda that was in a very few countries-- and most specifically in Afghanistan in September of 2001--is now an al-Qaeda that is in about 58, 59--who knows precisely, but we put it at around 60 countries. It is a global network, which it wasn't in 2001. We need to examinewhat our offshore counterterrorism efforts in places like Somalia and Yemen may tell us with respect to what is possible and not possible in Afghanistan or Pakistan, whether there is, in fact, legitimacy to thinking about some kind of a narrower focus like the one that al-Qaeda enjoyed in Afghanistan before 9/11. When al-Qaeda terrorists bombed American embassies in Africa and then attacked us on our own soil, their declaration of war against us was clear. Our response in the years since, while far from perfect, has been forceful and it has been tireless. And it is true that we have severely damaged al- Qaeda. We should acknowledge the enormous debt that we owe to the courageous men and women of our intelligence community who have worked night and day, often without recognition, without adequate thanks, in many cases without anybody knowing who they are in order to ensure that the unthinkable doesn't happen again. And I want to say a word about those real successes that we have had. We have hunted down much of al-Qaeda's leadership. We have disrupted terrorist networks in South and East Asia, Europe, and right here in the United States. And while many Americans have been killed fighting terrorists overseas, we are blessed to note that there has not been an attack on the soil of the United States in 8 years. But let me say a word about that. I remember, and I think many of you do, how the last administration--particularly the President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State-- reminded us frequently that it was not a question of if, it is a question of when. And all of us need to be sober-minded about that reality, notwithstanding the last 8 years. U.S. and international intelligence officials tell us they have succeeded in recruiting spies inside al-Qaeda and around it who have helped us disrupt future attacks. Targeted air strikes and enhanced assistance from allied governments have broadened our reach and diminished the effectiveness of the al- Qaeda network. Just last week, The Washington Post reported that these tactical advances have led to the deaths of more than a dozen senior figures in al-Qaeda and allied groups in the past year alone. A U.S. counterterrorism official said that Osama bin Laden and his main lieutenants are isolated and unable to coordinate high-profile attacks. Now, of course, defeating terrorist networks is more than just killing terrorists and disrupting their operations. In many ways, our efforts to combat terrorism can best be thought of as a global counterinsurgency campaign, where deterring tomorrow's terrorists is every bit as important as killing or disrupting today's. At its core, this is a battle against the extremists for the future of people's minds in many different parts of the world, and success will require a comprehensive strategy to address the root causes of terrorism. We must delegitimize terrorists and win over the hearts and the minds of those in the Muslim world. Even as we mark our progress in this endeavor, we are going to have to remain vigilant. We cannot confuse the absence of an attack on our soil for the absence of a threat. The Director of National Intelligence told Congress that, for all of our programs, al-Qaeda and its affiliates continue to pose a significant threat to America and that the group's central leadership has been able to regenerate the core operational capabilities needed to conduct at least small-scale attacks inside the United States. As our tactics have evolved, so have the terrorists'. Al- Qaeda and its affiliates have begun hitting softer Western targets--a subway train in Madrid, buses in London, and the business district in Istanbul. U.S. law enforcement officials remain vigilant against the possibility of attacks against U.S. transportation hubs, tourist attractions, and anywhere that people gather. Some places, however, are more dangerous today than they have ever been. Yemen and Somalia present two very serious challenges--fragile societies made even more lawless by the presence of terrorists trained in camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, which is something we have to consider as we think about our policies toward both of those countries. Morocco and Algeria have suffered attacks by al-Qaeda, with dozens of civilians losing their lives. The Philippines faces a daunting challenge from groups allied with al-Qaeda seeking to forge an Islamist state in the country's south. We are succeeding in our efforts to disrupt al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, but there remains an enormous amount of work to do in places like Pakistan and Somalia and many other parts of the world. The issue is going to be with us, I fear to say, for years to come, and our thinking needs to evolve along with the threat. We are fortunate to have with us today three highly regarded experts on al-Qaeda and its tactics, each of whom has already made real contributions to our understanding of terrorism and how to prevent it. Robert Grenier is the former director of the DCI Counterterrorist Center and former CIA station chief in Pakistan. Peter Bergen is the Schwartz senior fellow at the New America Foundation, where he co-directs the Terrorism Strategy Initiative. And Mr. Bergen produced Osama bin Laden's first television interview in 1997 in which he declared war on the United States. Dr. Marc Sageman is the senior fellow in the Foreign Policy Research Institute Center on Terrorism, Counterterrorism, and Homeland Security. So we thank you, all three. Did I pronounce that correctly--Sageman? Dr. Sageman. Yes. The Chairman. It is not Seg-man? I apologize. And we are very, very grateful to each of you being here to help us think through this very important topic. Thank you. Senator Lugar? STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD G. LUGAR, U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA Senator Lugar. Well, I thank the chairman for holding this important hearing. As we debate policy in Afghanistan and the merits of our approach to stability in the region, we take this opportunity to explore the broader issues presented by the continuing terrorist threat emanating from al-Qaeda. The Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Dennis Blair, released the National Intelligence Strategy in August. It identified key countries and issues of concern to our national security for the next 4 years. The report explains that violent extremists ``are planning to use terrorism--including the possible use of nuclear weapons or devices if they can acquire them--to attack the United States. Working in a number of regions, these groups aim to derail the rule of law, erode societal order, attack U.S. strategic partners, and otherwise challenge U.S. interests worldwide.'' A loose network of extremist al-Qaeda cohorts has sprung up across the globe. Its affiliates have aligned their actions and rhetoric with the core al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan to gain notoriety and financing. The largest al-Qaeda affiliate, although greatly diminished, remains al-Qaeda in Iraq. Some of its foreign fighters are returning home to local terrorist branches. For example, a fading domestic Algerian rebel group absorbed fighters from Iraq, expanded its aspirations, and transformed itself into ``al-Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb.'' Affiliates of al-Qaeda also emerged in Somalia, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen. The Saudi and Yemeni groups recently merged into ``al-Qaeda of the Arabian Peninsula,'' as both accepted fighters returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. These and other extremists well beyond the region are connected to the Pakistan core and its nexus of training, planning, and operations. Reportedly, al-Qaeda no longer has a major presence in Afghanistan, although witnesses in our previous hearings have indicated that its reestablishment would be nearly inevitable if a Taliban government returned to Kabul. Director of the National Counterterrorism Center, Michael Leiter, testified in the Senate last week that al-Qaeda's core in Pakistan still represents the most dangerous component of the wider network. He stated that our intelligence community assessed that ``this core is actively engaged in operational plotting and continues recruiting, training, and transporting operatives, to include individuals from Western Europe and North America.'' In addition, thousands of virtual adherents are connected to al-Qaeda through the Internet. These autonomous affiliates exist across Asia, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. Because of this diversification, eliminating al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan would not solve the global terrorism problem. But al- Qaeda's leadership continues to be an operational and ideological threat that requires our strongest efforts. Successes in arresting or killing terrorists and disrupting terrorist plots are essential in keeping the threat at bay, but insufficient for solving the problem. There is a far more enduring undercurrent of finance and ideology fueling terror. Consequently, one of the most important aspects of combating al-Qaeda is the international effort to identify and to eliminate its sources of finance. Money is a key ingredient for recruitment of new terrorists and the staging of any large operation. Despite some success in narrowing al-Qaeda's funding options, its financing system has adapted over time. The United States and its allies should be more forceful and vocal about sources of finance for extremist groups. The information might prove disquieting to some friends, but governments must be held accountable for tacitly enabling those who fuel violent extremism. We also must ask if our current strategy sufficiently accounts for the roles of diplomacy, international exchange, and foreign assistance, so that we can reach Muslims who currently hear a message of hate from their most radical ranks. How do we counter not just al-Qaeda's tactics, but enlist support to discredit this strategic plan and vision within the worldwide Muslim community? I welcome our witnesses and look forward to their assessments of the current state of the terrorist threat and the effectiveness of U.S. policies to combat it. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Lugar. Thanks for helping to take part in this and lead it. I appreciate it. Gentlemen, if you would begin? We look forward to your testimony very much and to a good dialogue with the members of the committee. Mr. Grenier, if you would begin, and we will just run right down the line. Thanks. Mr. Grenier. Very good. The Chairman. Your full statements will be placed in the record as if read in full and welcome any summary comments. Thanks. STATEMENT OF ROBERT GRENIER, FORMER DIRECTOR, DCI COUNTERTERRORIST CENTER AND FORMER CIA STATION CHIEF IN PAKISTAN Mr. Grenier. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank you and the other members of the committee for the opportunity to come and testify before you today. It is a great honor and a privilege. I take very seriously the admonition that we have been given to keep our opening remarks brief. I will attempt to do that. And so, rather than trying to answer all conceivable questions at the outset, instead I will try to take a couple of minutes just to frame some of the issues in ways that I hope will be useful to our subsequent discussion. I should also say at the outset that I confront the questions that we will be discussing today not as a scholar-- God knows that the scholars are off to my left here--but rather, as a former operator, albeit a former operator who is now 3 years out of Government and whose sources of information, therefore, are largely confined to what he reads in the newspaper. But as I read the newspaper and I attempt to read between the lines, it seems to me that there are aspects of our overall confrontation with al-Qaeda that are going quite well and others substantially less so. As we look at the confrontation with al-Qaeda, it seems to me that it consists of three distinct, discrete aspects. One is what we might call the tactical fight, the international cooperative effort to track down, to capture, and to kill terrorists. Secondly, it is the effort to deny al-Qaeda safe haven. And the third is what the chairman just referred to as a global counterinsurgency, what is often referred to as the war of ideas, the effort to confront al-Qaeda as an ideological movement as opposed to a terrorist organization. Well, without belaboring the point, it seems to me that the tactical fight is going quite well. Whether we look at North America or Europe or much of North Africa, much of the Arabian Peninsula, Southeast Asia, we can see that al-Qaeda is fundamentally on the back foot. They have suffered significant losses, and those losses extend, importantly, to the relative safe haven that they now enjoy along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. And it seems to me that at the end of the day, one of the more prominent--in fact, from our perspective, the most prominent indication of that success in that global cooperative effort will prove to be the recent arrest of Najibullah Zazi. Again, I am reading between the lines. I am speculating here. But I suspect that the end of the day, as more of the onions are peeled back, we will discover that our ability to thwart the threat that he poses, such as it may prove in the end to be, will have come as a result of effective cooperation among a number of countries extending back over a significant period of time. But as we look at the parts of the struggle that aren't going as well, as we look at the areas that cause the experts and the security officials concern, almost without exception, those involve ungoverned space. Whether we are talking about desert areas in Mauritania and Southern Algeria, where there is a relative resurgence of al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, whether we are talking about Somalia and the growing strength of al-Shabaab and its AQ adherents, whether we are looking at Yemen, whether we are looking, yes, at Afghanistan and Pakistan, the areas that are highly problematic for us now involve ungoverned space and, therefore, the real or the potential for terrorist safe haven. Now there are those who raise a fundamental question. There are those who ask whether safe haven is actually important to al-Qaeda or, otherwise put, is safe haven of sufficient importance to al-Qaeda as to justify the effort and the losses that we must incur if we are to counter those safe havens? Well it seems to me that the answer to that question, without necessarily knowing what the costs will be, is yes. And I come at that as a former operator. I spent much of my career engaged in clandestine operations, working against hostile governments, trying to hide my activities from those who were charged with discovering those activities, operating on turf that was controlled by them and not me. It is not a place that you want to be if you can help it. If you don't have safe haven, you are very limited in terms of what you can achieve, sustainably, over time. And as an operator, as a clandestine operator in the past, we had safe haven. We would not have been as successful as we were without it. And the same, I believe, is true of al-Qaeda. And you can say that in this day and time, yes, there is safe haven that you can find on the Internet. There is safe haven in apartments in Hamburg. But unless you have a real safe haven, there are certain aspects of your mission that you simply are not going to be able to do effectively, particularly involving recruitment and training. We can drill into that further. So as we take a look at those issues in the context of Afghanistan and Pakistan, where the two key aspects that we are discussing today of the confrontation with al-Qaeda come together, the tactical fight and the fight to deny safe haven, there are those who raise a number of significant questions. There are those who say, well, look, our objective at the end of the day is to counter al-Qaeda and affiliated groups. Well, everyone concedes that al-Qaeda does not have a substantial presence currently in Afghanistan. So why are we there? Well, we know that al-Qaeda has a substantial presence across the border in Pakistan. And the fact that they are on the Pakistani side of the border right now is a matter of tactical convenience to them. If the pressure were reduced on the Afghan side and it were increased on the Pakistani side, it would be very easy for them to cross the border. More fundamentally, though, there are those who say, well, look, even if the Taliban were to gain control of substantial portions of Afghanistan, as it has in the past, we don't know that they would provide a safe haven to al-Qaeda. Haven't they learned the lesson of 9/11? Well, I think they have learned a lot of lessons since 9/ 11, but they are not the ones that we would have them learn. There are at least two factors that I would point to. One is that as you look at the number of disparate groups that are active in Afghanistan, Pakistan, elsewhere, in South Asia-- whether it is the Afghan Taliban, the Pakistani Taliban, the Kashmiri groups, sectarian groups--they all cooperate far more closely now than they did at the time of 9/11. Pressure on all has forced them to cooperate in ways that would have been unthinkable before 9/11. Secondly, there has been an evolution in their thinking. They think of themselves differently now than they did 8 years ago. Yes, they are seized with their own parochial interests, but they see the pursuit of those parochial interests as being part of a global effort. They see themselves as part of a global jihad that most of them simply did not, apart from a handful of leaders, back before 9/11. For the Taliban, the question as to whether they should provide safe haven for al-Qaeda is not an open-ended strategic discussion. For them, it is a very simple religious question. The question for them is, are we enjoined to support co- religionists who are engaged in a legitimate struggle against infidel oppressors, or can we simply pursue our own ends and ignore them? And if you ask the question, the answer for them is very, very clear. There is only one answer that they can reach. If they are asked for support by al-Qaeda, they cannot and they will not say no. Leaving aside this whole question of the importance of safe haven, even if we don't accept that, there are those who say, well, couldn't we limit ourselves to a counterterrorism effort in Afghanistan much more narrowly defined? Well, that is a long discussion, which I hope that we will get into, but I would raise two points. One is that even to do the counterterrorism effort based in Afghanistan, we need a very robust presence there. Much of our relative success against the al-Qaeda leadership, particularly across the border in Pakistan, is owing to the intelligence and military platform that we have inside Afghanistan. If that were to be diminished, I believe our success would diminish along with it. Secondly, there is the whole issue of Afghan tolerance. The Afghans are much less interested in al-Qaeda. They are much more interested in wresting control of their country from the Taliban. It is hard to imagine that they would continue to welcome us in the way that they do if there weren't something in it for them. And there are those who pose the question in even more stark terms. Well, couldn't we simply do this as a counterterrorism effort from offshore? Well, we considered whether we could do that when I was sitting in Islamabad immediately after 9/11, and the short answer is no. We can't. You absolutely have to have a platform there on the ground if you are to conduct counterterrorism operations effectively. It was the Pakistanis who provided that to us initially. Which gets us down to the final question--the one that we haven't been asked today, but which, obviously, the administration is struggling with--and that is the question of troops. If we accept that we need to do both a counterterrorism effort and a counterinsurgency effort to deny safe haven, what sort of a force posture do we need? Well, I don't think that I can answer that question. But it seems to me that the more fundamental question, the far more important one, quite apart from the numbers of troops required, is do we have an achievable objective, and do we have an effective strategy to achieve that objective? And as I look at the situation right now, unfortunately, my answer to both questions is no. I fear that we are trying to achieve the unachievable in Afghanistan. I fear that we are trying for an outcome which current reality will not admit. And secondly, I think that the tactics or the strategy that we are employing to achieve that objective is simply not going to work over time, relying as it does on building up national institutions in Afghanistan of a sort that have never existed in the past. So having raised more questions than answers, I will terminate my remarks. The Chairman. Those are good remarks and good questions, and ones we want to pursue. So we look forward to that. Mr. Sageman? STATEMENT OF MARC SAGEMAN, SENIOR FELLOW, FOREIGN POLICY RESEARCH INSTITUTE, WASHINGTON, D.C. Dr. Sageman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Lugar, members of the committee. I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the threat of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and beyond. I also talk not only as a scholar, but as a former operator being involved in the insurgency, Afghan insurgency against the Soviets in the 1980s where I had the privilege of serving under Milt Bearden, who was here last week. Al-Qaeda is once again at the forefront of U.S. Government policy debate. To clarify its threat to the homeland and to those of other Western nations, I would like to share with you the result of a comprehensive survey that I conducted of all plots, successful and unsuccessful, over the past 20 years carried out by al-Qaeda, its transnational allies, and homegrown groups inspired by al-Qaeda. I included all the plots that had any loose link to al- Qaeda, its ideology, had reached a level of maturity, were violent in nature, and were initiated by the terrorists. The top graph that you see over there demonstrates that there were 60 plots carried out by 46 different networks. It started out in New York City with the first World Trade Center bombing. The first peak that you see over there is a large wave of GIA bombings in France in the summer of 1995. Then the number of plots kind of diminished. It spread around the world, peaked again in 2004, probably as a reaction to the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and it has declined ever since. Last year, I think there were only three plots around the world. The bottom graph that you see there demonstrates the command and control of the various plots by transnational terrorist organizations. I erred on the side of being over inclusive. That is including plots as being under a group's command and control. As you see, there were 12 al-Qaeda core plots in blue, 15 al-Qaeda affiliate--other terrorist organization--in red, and 32 homegrown plots in green without any physical link to any formal terrorist organization. After the Algerian plots of the 1990s, al-Qaeda plots started after bin Laden`` 1998 declaration of war against the West. It peaked in 2001 and then decreased thereafter to about one plot a year. Over the past 5 years, 80 percent of the plots were homegrown, autonomous plots. In terms of training, about 57 percent of the terrorist group had received some training with a terrorist organization in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Over the past 7 years, it has only been Pakistan. The trained networks have a 20 percent probability of inflicting a casualty on the Western population, which was much greater than 5 percent probability of success of an untrained group. In terms of damages, of all the 60 plots, only 14 succeeded in afflicting any casualty. Of these, 9 were that Algerian group in 1995, 2 were al-Qaeda--namely, 9/11 and the London 7/7 bombing--and 3 were independent plots. The fact that only two al-Qaeda plots in the West were successful in the past two decades has been obscured by the horrible lethality, of course. So what are the implications of this comprehensive survey for the present policy options? One, the threat to the West has expanded beyond al-Qaeda to include Pakistani and Uzbeki groups. None of these groups are located in Afghanistan, and there really is no Afghani al-Qaeda. However, almost 80 percent of the plots in the past 5 years are homegrown groups with no physical links to any transnational terrorist group. Two, counterterrorism is working. There has been no casualty in the United States for the past 8 years and no casualty in the West in the past 4 years, thanks a lot to the effort of Mr. Grenier here. At home, counterterrorism consists of a combination of good domestic police work, good domestic intelligence, and good cooperation with foreign and domestic intelligence agencies. Abroad, it consists of an effective strategy of containment of young wannabes going to Pakistan through good airport security abroad, good border control at home, keeping up the pressure on al-Qaeda and its transnational allies in Pakistan, supporting the Pakistan military to dislodge foreign militants from Waziristan while sealing the border on the Afghan side, and continuing sanctuary denial. Three, this counterterrorism strategy will continue, no matter what. So the real question is whether there is any added value to the military surge in Afghanistan for protection of the homeland. Clearly, such a surge would not help us protect the homeland from al-Qaeda and its allies because they are not in Afghanistan. The Afghan Taliban is not al-Qaeda and does not share internationally its ambition. Will the military surge prevent the return of al-Qaeda to Afghanistan? The assumption is that the Taliban return to power will automatically allow al-Qaeda to reconstitute in Afghanistan and threaten the homeland. The capture of Afghanistan by the Taliban is not a sure thing. It took more than 3 years for much better armed and a far more popular insurgency to capture the power after the complete withdrawal from the Soviet forces in Afghanistan 20 years ago. The Taliban is really a collection of rival and fractious groups united against us, but lacking the ability to coalesce in the future or in the near future, I should say, into an offensive force capable of marching on to Kabul. Taliban return to power does not automatically mean an invitation to al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan. The relationship between al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups with a major faction constituting the Afghan Taliban has always been strained. This provides the U.S. government with the opportunity to play on internal rivalries and use political skills and economic incentive to discourage the Taliban from hosting al-Qaeda again. And even if al-Qaeda returns to Afghanistan in some form, it is not going to be in the same form as in the 1990s, when not so benign neglect by Western forces allowed them to grow to the threat that we saw on 9/11. Sanctuary denial is the appropriate mission for the military. So there is definitely no necessity and little added value to the military surge in this counterinsurgency option. It is the most costly in terms of blood and treasure, probably the least likely to succeed, and may even increase terrorism in the homeland through homegrown wannabes' reaction to the inevitable increase in killing of Muslims by Western forces. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Sageman follows:] Prepared Statement of Marc Sageman, M.D., Ph.D. Mr. Chairman, Senator Lugar, and Members of the Committee: I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the threat of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and beyond. Al-Qaeda is once again at the forefront of U.S. Government policy debate. Our strategic interest in Afghanistan is linked to the protection of the homeland and that of our Western allies against terrorist attacks. A moment's reflection will demonstrate this. Al- Qaeda found sanctuary in the Sudan for four years, from 1992 to 1996, when the Sudanese government expelled it. During this Sudanese phase, al-Qaeda developed its strategy to target the West, and especially the United States and trained potential terrorists there. Indeed, the planning of the simultaneous bombings of our Embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam was done in Khartoum. Had al-Qaeda not been thrown out of the Sudan, I have no doubt that we would be discussing strategy options about the Sudan rather than Afghanistan. Our ultimate goal of homeland security will be served through a better understanding of the threat confronting it in order to ``disrupt, dismantle, and eventually defeat al-Qaeda and its allies.'' Let me describe this global threat through a comprehensive survey that I conducted of all the al-Qaeda plots in the West, all the al-Qaeda affiliate plots in the West and all the plots done ``in the name of al- Qaeda'' in the West since the formation of al-Qaeda in August 1988. It is necessary to expand our inquiry because al-Qaeda is now only one of the many actors in this global neo-jihadi terrorist threat against the West. I call it neo-jihadi because the terrorists have appropriated this contested concept to themselves much to the protest of respected Islamic scholars and the mainstream Muslim communities worldwide.\\1\\ Terrorism for the purpose of this project is the use of violence by non-state collective actors against non-combatants in the West in pursuit of a self-appointed global jihad. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ For an analysis of the concept of jihad through Muslim jurisprudence and history,see Richard Bonney, 2004, Jihad: From Qur'an to bin Laden, New York: Palgrave Macmillan. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- I conducted this survey when I spent a year at the U.S. Secret Service and an additional year at the New York Police Department as its first scholar-in-residence. Although both organizations helped me immensely, the following remarks are my own and cannot be read as their position or opinions. Because homeland security in the West essentially means population protection in the West, I have limited the inquiry to violent plots to be executed in the geographical territory of the West. By the West, I mean North America, Australia and Western Europe, with the exception of the civil war in the Balkans since terrorism is often a tactic of war, but wartime terrorism may not teach us much about terrorism during peace time. To be included in the survey, each plot had to have some loose operational or inspirational link to al-Qaeda or its affiliates; it had to reach a certain level of maturity, characterized by overt acts in furtherance; it consisted of violent acts targeting people in the West, and therefore excluded cases of purely financial or material support for terrorist acts committed elsewhere; some planning had to be done in the West; and terrorists had to initiate the plot. To accurately evaluate the threat, I of course included both successful and unsuccessful plots, which are the true measure of the extent of the threat, rather than just the successful ones. The global neo-jihadi terrorist threat includes plots under the control of al-Qaeda core; al-Qaeda affiliates like the Algerian Groupes Islamiques Armes (GIA), Pakistani Lashkar e-Toyba (LT), the Uzbek Islamic Jihad Union (IJU), the Pakistani Tehrik e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).; and threats by autonomous groups inspired by al-Qaeda like the Dutch Hofstad group. I excluded lone wolves, who were not physically or virtually connected to anyone in the global neo-jihad, for they often carry out their atrocities on the basis of delusion and mental disorder rather than for political reasons. My sources of information were legal documents, trial transcripts, consultations with foreign and domestic intelligence and law enforcement agencies, to which my position gave me access. Although all these plots are within the open source domain, I did corroborate the validity of the data in the classified domain. The specified criteria yielded a total of 60 global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West, perpetrated by 46 terrorist networks in the past two decades, from the first World Trade Center attack on February 26, 1993 to the December 16, 2008 arrest of Rany Arnaud, who was plotting to blow up the Direction Generale du Renseignement Interieur, the French FBI equivalent, in a suburb of Paris. Although people associate al-Qaeda plots with airplanes or bombs, the plots were quite diverse: simple assassinations, attempted kidnapping and decapitation, car/truck bombs, airplane hijacking, and improvised explosive devices. Some operations were suicidal, but most were not. Of all the plots, only one is completely unsolved--the bombing of the Port Royal Metro station in Paris on December 3, 1996, which resulted in many casualties. Although completely unsolved, the timing, context and mode of operation seem to point to the GIA, trying to avenge its followers, who were put on trial around that time.The following graph is the timeline distribution of the plots. Figure 1. Timeline distribution of global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West. We can see from the above graph that global neo-jihadi terrorist plots preceded the 9/11/01 attack when the Western public first started to appreciate the true extent of the threat confronting it. The first plot in the West was the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993, or about four and a half years after the creation of al-Qaeda proper. The timeline distribution of the plots is bi-modal. The first peak consisted of raids by the Algerian GIA against France and stopped in 1996; the later plots were more widely geographically distributed and reached a peak in 2004, after which they declined. In the recent controversy over whether al-Qaeda (however defined, here I am using a more inclusive and therefore much wider definition of the threat in the West) is on the move or on the run, we can see that the wider ``al Qaeda'' threat or the global neo-jihadi terrorist threat is definitely on the run since its high water mark of 2004. Some networks of terrorists, who temporarily escaped arrest, carried out multiple plots in the West. This is especially true of the 1995 wave of ten GIA plots against France, carried out by the same network in France. In order to understand the actual threat, as opposed to the inability of local police forces to disrupt existing networks, I also coded the global neo-jihadi threat to the West according to the specific terrorist networks carrying out operations (as opposed to plots). Coding the data according to networks rather than plots gives the following graph. What is most affected by this coding is the collapse of the GIA wave of bombings in France in 1995, now represented by the same group rather than the ten separate plots. Again, loosely global neo-jihadi networks in the West preceded the 9/11/01 operation. Here, the graph indicates that global neo-jihadi networks in the West became more numerous in 2001, experienced a temporary small decline, and reached its 2004 high water mark, after which it declined, especially after 2007. So, here again, ``al-Qaeda'' is on the run and not on the move. I suspect the post 2003 bump in the number of networks threatening the West in the name of AQ was a reaction to the Western invasion of Iraq. Figure 2. Timeline distribution of global neo-jihadi terrorist networks in the West. Although the press likes to call any militant Islamist plot an al- Qaeda plot, let us see how many are truly al-Qaeda plots. I coded the command and control of each plot according to the following classification (I did not code the 1996 Paris Metro plot because it is still unsolved): AQ Core means that AQ proper directed and controlled the operation. AQ Affiliated means that an international terrorist organization affiliated with AQ, such as LT or IJU, directed and controlled the operation. AQ Inspired means that there was no direction or control by any of the above organization for the plot. In other words, the plot was completely autonomous. In this coding system, I leaned backward to give credit to a terrorist organization when there was any doubt about its command and control over an operation. I did this to increase the probability of detecting any coordination of global neo-jihadi terrorism by a single entity, a sort of neo-jihadi equivalent of the Comintern--the Soviet Central Committee in Moscow that tried to coordinate Communist activities worldwide. The result is: 12 AQ Core controlled operations (20%) LAX millenial plot (1999) Strasbourg Christmas Market bombing plot (2000) 9/11/01 attack (2001) Paris Embassy bombing plot (2001) Belgian Kleine Brogel US Air Force base bombing plot (2001) Shoe bomber plot (2001) London fertilizer bomb plot (Operation Crevice, 2004) London limousine bombing plot (Operation Rhyme, 2004) London 7/7 bombings (Theseus case) (2005) London 7/21 bombing plot (Vivace case) (2005) London airplanes liquid bomb plot (Operation Overt) (2006) Danish Glasvej bombing plot (Operation Dagger) (2007) 15 AQ affiliated terrorist organizations controlled operations (25%) 11 GIA plots against France (1994-5) German al-Tawhid bombing plots (Zarqawi group) (2002) Sydney bombing plot (Brigitte-Lodhi, LT controlled) (2003) German Sauerland bombing plot (IJU controlled) (2007) Barcelona bombing plot (alleged TTP control) (2008) 32 AQ inspired terrorist plots, carried out either on behalf of al- Qaeda or other transnational terrorist organizations (54%) Figure 3. Timeline of global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West: Command & Control. Al-Qaeda-inspired autonomous plots constitute the majority of all the plots, followed by al-Qaeda affiliated plots, with true al-Qaeda plots closing out the sample at only 20%. Viewing the graph chronologically, al-Qaeda Core did not start this terrorist campaign against the West. Indeed, all al-Qaeda Core plots in the West took place after bin Laden's 1998 hukm (his `considered judgment,' not fatwa as is incorrectly reported in the West and which carries much less authority than a fatwa).\\2\\ Two attacks in New York City conducted by former Afghan Arabs inaugurated this worldwide wave of bombings against the West. They were conducted locally, and there is no evidence that there was any guidance, direction or control by al-Qaeda Core. If anything, they were more closely connected with the Egyptian Islamic Group than al-Qaeda or its ally, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. These attacks were followed by a large wave of GIA attacks against France, which had to do with the internal dynamics of the Algerian civil war in the 1990s, and again had no guidance, direction or control from al- Qaeda Core. The actual al-Qaeda Core plots in the West began in late 1999, as part of a wave of worldwide bombings to mark the dawn of the new Western Millennium, peaked in 2001, and decreased thereafter to about one plot per year, with a small uptick in 2004-2005 and fading over the next two years. Despite even recent claims that al-Qaeda is on the move, it is clear that al-Qaeda in the West has been on the decline since its apogee of 2001. When studying a phenomenon, it is important to count and look at the trend. When one relies on out of context anecdotal evidence, it is easy to make mistakes. I suspect that the recent advocates for a ``resurgent'' al-Qaeda were confused by the complexity of the 2006 London airplanes liquid bomb plot (Overt case) and mistook complexity for resurgence. The fact is clear that since its loss of sanctuary in Afghanistan in 2001, al-Qaeda proper has had trouble projecting to the West. It was able to operate locally in South Asia and Iraq, especially after al Zarqawi proclaimed a merger of his organization with al-Qaeda. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\2\\ See Lawrence, Bruce, ed., 2005, Messages to the World: The Statements of Osama bin Laden, London: Verso, page 61. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Let's look at the past five years: 6 AQ Core plots (2004 Rhyme and Crevice plots; 2005 Theseus and Vivace cases; 2006 Overt case, all in Britain, and 2007 Dagger plot in Denmark) 2 AQ Affiliated plots (2007 Sauerland & 2008 Barcelona Plots) 25 AQ Inspired autonomous plots, conducted by homegrown perpetrators, with no connections whatsoever with any formal transnational terrorist organizations The above statistics are crystal clear: 78% of all global neo- jihadi terrorist plots in the West in the past five years came from autonomous homegrown groups without any connection, direction or control from al-Qaeda Core or its allies. The `resurgent al-Qaeda' in the West argument has no empirical foundation. The paucity of actual al-Qaeda and other transnational terrorist organization plots compared to the number of autonomous plots refutes the claims by some heads of the Intelligence Community (Hayden, 2008) that all Islamist plots in the West can be traced back to the Afghan Pakistani border. Far from being the ``epicenter of terrorism,'' this Pakistani region is more like the finishing school of global neo-jihadi terrorism, where a few amateur wannabes are transformed into dangerous terrorists. The graph also shows a sporadic involvement of al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist groups in plotting against the West in the past six years. These groups located in Pakistan are showing an increased ability to project against the West, although most of their operations are still confined to South Asia. However, in the internal rivalry among terrorist groups in South Asia, the quickest way to establish one's reputation is to demonstrate an ability to strike in the West. Although it is rare for al-Qaeda core to claim credit for its operations in the West, its rivals in South Asia have been quick to claim credit, even for failed plots. The Islamic Jihad Union claimed credit for the failed Sauerland group plot in September 2007 and Baitullah Mehsud, the deceased chief of Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan claimed credit for the failed Barcelona Plot of January 2008--although this last claim must be taken with a great deal of caution because he has claimed credits for mishaps in the West that had nothing to do with his organization, like the power outage in the U.S. Midwest in 2007 and the mass murder incident in Binghamton, New York on April 3, 2009. These empty self- promotions have been categorically refuted by federal authorities. The West may well find itself caught in this militant rivalry for global neo-jihadi supremacy. My coding probably overestimated the importance of formal terrorist groups. Most of the recent plots coded as under al-Qaeda command and control, like the 2004 London fertilizer bomb plot, did not involve such frequent communication with al-Qaeda, but included instead a short meeting with a high level representative of al-Qaeda, where local Western terrorist wannabes informed al Qeada representatives, Abdal Hadi al Iraqi and his lieutenant, of their own initiative to conduct operations in the West. In such cases, it seems that the meeting with al-Qaeda leadership did not affect the desire of the local terrorists to conduct such operations. Here the role of the al-Qaeda was passive agreement with little influence on the plot. IThe dramatic increase in global neo-jihadi terrorism in the first decade of the 21st Century has come from al-Qaeda inspired autonomous groups with no link to formal transnational terrorist groups. This is especially true since the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which has inspired local young Muslims to strike out against the West. It seems clear that this invasion has created more terrorists in the West, refuting the thesis that ``we are fighting them there, so we don't have to fight them here.'' The fact that these plots peaked in 2004, one year after the invasion of Iraq provides empirical support linking the two events. These scattered plots, not coordinated by any central terrorist body and constituting almost 80% of the plots against the West in the past five years, illustrate how the threat against the West is degenerating into a ``leaderless jihad.'' \\3\\ Far from being directed by a Comintern, global neo-jihadi terrorism is evolving to the structure of anarchist terrorism that prevailed over a century ago, when no such global coordinating committee was ever found despite contemporaneous belief in its existence. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\3\\ See Sageman, Marc, 2008, Leaderless Jihad: Terror Networks in the Twenty-First Century, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Within this cluster of al-Qaeda inspired autonomous groups is a troubling emerging pattern of lone wolves, directly linked via the Internet to foreign al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist organizations: the 2004 Rotterdam Plot (Yehya Kadouri), the 2007 Nancy plot (Kamel Bouchentouf), the 2008 Exeter plot (Nicky Reilly) and the 2008 French Direction Centrale du Renseignement Interieur plot (Rany Arnaud). Although these young men are willing to sacrifice themselves for these affiliate terrorist groups, they have never met them face to face. This may become a trend that will increase in the future. Another dimension of allied al-Qaeda involvement in plots against the West is financial support of these plots. Again, in examining each global neo-jihadi terrorism network for such support, I have erred on the side of inclusiveness of al-Qaeda support in this coding scheme. Out of forty-five global neo-jihadi terrorist networks in the West, al-Qaeda at least partially funded ten. But this overstates its importance in this regard. The funding of the 1993 World Trade Center plot was minimal, and consisted of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed sending a few hundred dollars to his nephew Ramzi Yousef. It is unclear where the money came from, but for the sake of this study, let us assume it came from al-Qaeda. The same goes for the GIA wave of bombings in France in 1995. Bin Laden funded the Al Ansar newsletter in London via Rachid Ramda, who funded the bombing campaign. I do not know where the money for this campaign (as opposed to the newsletter) came from. I suspect that it came from the GIA itself through its fund raising campaign throughout Europe. However, let us again assume that it came from bin Laden either directly or indirectly. Figure 4. Al-Qaeda Financial Support for Terrorist networks in the West. We can see that from 1999 to 2001, al-Qaeda either partially or fully funded its operations against the West. This was either in the form of seed money ($10,000 given to Ahmed Ressam for the 1999 LAX bombing plot or the 2000 Strasbourg Christmas Market bombing plot). In each case, the perpetrators were supposed to supplement their initial funds via their own means (robbery in Ressam's case; drug sales for the other). Sometimes, the funding was paid in full, as in the 9/11/01 plot. I assume that al-Qaeda at least partially funded the rest of the 2001 al-Qaeda plots since I came across no evidence that these perpetrators raised any money on their own. The two alleged al-Qaeda plots in 2005 were a departure from this pattern, as there is no evidence that the two London bombing plots of July 2005 received any money from al-Qaeda. The last alleged al-Qaeda plot, the Danish Glasvej (Dagger) case indicates that the main perpetrator, Hamad Khurshid, came back from Pakistan with $5,000 in cash. It is true that, except for the 9/11/01 operation, terrorist plots are not expensive to carry out. Autonomous terrorists had no choice but to raise the funds for their operation themselves. On the other hand, the al-Qaeda-affiliated transnational terrorist groups seemed to have funded their own operations. The GIA plots were fully funded from outside and none of the perpetrators were tasked with raising money for the plots. The 2002 German al Tawhid plot was probably funded by Zarqawi. LT funded the Sydney plot through money transfers to Willie Brigitte in 2003, and the IJU seemed to have funded the 2007 German Sauerland plot. It is unknown the degree of financial support that the potential perpetrators of the 2008 Barcelona plot received from Mehsud's organization. For those who like to follow the money, only a very few plots have been funded from the outside in the past five years. Of the twenty-nine global neo-jihadi terrorist networks involved during that period, al- Qaeda core funding has been implicated in only two--Hamad Khurshid and the London Rhyme case. Even if we add the non-al Qaeda funded Sauerland case and possibly the TTP Barcelona case, the total increases to only three or four out of twenty-nine cases (10% or 14%). Since the money involved was mostly in the form of cash, following the trail of money will not detect global neo-jihadi terrorism plots in the West. The vast majority these networks in the past five years have raised their own money. It has been argued that training by a formal terrorist organization is critically important because it transforms amateurs into seasoned terrorists. Several Western intelligence leaders have stated that all significant global neo-jihadi terrorist plots lead back to the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan (FATA). The next graph tests this claim. I plotted the overseas training for all the terrorist networks and coded them as receiving training from al-Qaeda, an al- Qaeda affiliate, or no training at all--just al-Qaeda inspired. Again, I erred on the side of over-inclusiveness of such training, even if just one person in the network, who might not have been involved in the planning of the plot, had simply undergone familiarization training, which did not teach any significant bomb making skills. For this graph, I coded Bouyeri as being separate from the Hofstad network because he carried out the assassination of Theo van Gogh on his own in 2004 and had not gone to any training camp. Out of 46 different networks attempting terrorist operations in the West, 16 had at least one member that underwent training at an AQ Core facility (35%) 10 had at least one member that underwent training at an AQ affiliated facility (22%) 20 had no training at all (43%) Figure 5. Global neo-jihadi terrorist overseas training. Lumping the data together hides some important trends. First, more people have trained from al-Qaeda and al-Qaeda affiliates than are under the control of these respective organizations. Lately, in the press and perhaps the intelligence community, there is a presumption that attendance in a formal terrorist organization training camp is equivalent to being under control of that organization. So, I included the 2004 London fertilizer plot (Operation Crevice) and the two 2005 London underground bombing plots as al-Qaeda controlled because the perpetrators had allegedly received al-Qaeda training. However, there was no evidence of extensive communication between the perpetrators in the field and al-Qaeda Core in Pakistan, unlike the 9/11/01 plot or the 2006 London airplanes liquid bomb plot, where the perpetrators were in almost daily communication with al-Qaeda core, or the 2007 Sauerland plotters, who were in constant e-mail contact with their IJU sponsors. This equation of training camp attendance with foreign terrorist organization control was not presumed for the pre-2001 plots, when attendance in an al-Qaeda camp did not mean al-Qaeda control. For example, Ramzi Yousef, the bomb maker for the first World Trade Center bombing in 1993, never belonged to al-Qaeda, but had undergone extensive training at al-Qaeda funded camps and had taught at Abdal Rabb Rasul Sayyaf's University of Jihad. Likewise, members of the 2002 al Tawhid plot had been trained at al-Qaeda camps before joining Abu Musab al-Zarqawi's al Tawhid organization. Again, the two ricin plots (the 2002 French Chechen network and the 2003 British ricin plot [Operation Earth]) included members who had trained in al-Qaeda camps, even though neither plot seemed to have been known or sanctioned by al- Qaeda as far as I know. Al-Qaeda funded most of the training camps in Afghanistan before the U.S. invasion in the fall of 2001. Anyone who had traveled to Afghanistan for training at that time was bound to have been trained in an al-Qaeda funded camp. The cases just cited included members who had been in Afghanistan before the fall of the Taliban regime. The result was that graduates from al-Qaeda camps in the 1990s dominate global neo-jihadi terrorism from 1999 to 2002. By the time they were planning their operations in the West in 2002 or 2003, they no longer had any active link to al-Qaeda. Since 2002, al-Qaeda trained terrorists averaged just one plot a year. As the availability of al-Qaeda training faded over time, al-Qaeda affiliated terrorist organizations in Kashmir or the Federally Administered Tribal Areas of Pakistan, such as Laskhar-e Toyba or the Islamic Jihad Union, began to fill in the gap starting in 2003 and the graduates of their camps also average about one plot a year. So, while terrorist networks that had training dominate the overall sample (57%), this trend has been reversed in the past five years as only 40% had such training. Indeed, all those who underwent training in the past five years, acquired it in Pakistan, not Afghanistan. Although I use the generic term ``training camp'' to describe the place of training before and after 2001, the meaning of the term has since changed dramatically and overestimates the formality and sophistication of training received by global neo-jihadi terrorist networks in the West after 2001. Gone are the large formal camps like Khalden, Farooq or Darunta in Afghanistan, which could accommodate hundreds of novices and had a formal curriculum with increased levels of sophistication sometimes lasting up to a year for the select few (see Ahmed Ressam's training for the 1999 LAX millennium plot). After the 2001 U.S. invasion of Afghanistan, these formal training facilities were destroyed. People traveling to Pakistan afterwards either went to formal training facilities conducted by Kashmiri terrorist groups in Kashmir (see the legal judgment on Willie Brigitte for a description of such camps) or had to arrange for their training through hiring of a private trainer. These new ``camps'' were nothing like the former ones: they were small rented housing compounds or even two tents in a goat patch, where one instructor and his son gave private lessons to at most a dozen students, who directly paid for their instruction, the duration of which could be as short as two days to about three weeks (see the transcripts of the 2004 Crevice or the 2005 Theseus cases, which describe this process). Later, after a series of truces signed between FATA tribal leaders and the government of Pakistan between 2004 and 2006, al-Qaeda or IJU provided more formal training in Waziristan, but they never reached the level of sophistication in instruction that prevailed before 2001. These new facilities in Waziristan were more visible than before and could accommodate up to about twenty trainees at a time. Indeed, the presence of these camps probably led to alarms that al-Qaeda was resurgent. Strangely enough, the presence of these new ``camps'' did not affect the frequency of al-Qaeda linked plots in the West. The slight bump in frequency of terrorist trained arrests or actual bombings in 2004 and 2005 was not due to these truces, because the training of the perpetrators preceded the truce agreements. Despite the widespread alarms in the West, the truces do not appear to have any effect on global neo-jihadi terrorism in the West. In any case, the graph shows clearly that the majority of global neo-jihadi terrorist networks from 2004 onwards did not have any formal training from foreign terrorist groups (60%), contrary to the statements of Intelligence agency chiefs on both sides of the Atlantic. They were purely homegrown and had no link to the FATA, which some have called ``the epicenter of terrorism.'' Instead, they had to rely on themselves and the Internet for their acquisition of terrorist skills, consistent with the leaderless jihad argument. How dangerous is global neo-jihadi terrorism? In other words, what is the result of global neo-jihadi terrorist plots in the West? I coded all 60 plots in the West in terms of whether they caused any injuries; were carried out but failed (no explosion because of a technical error); or were interrupted through law enforcement arrests. The results are as follows: 14 Plots were successful in terms of incurring any injury and or death (23%) Only 2 al-Qaeda core plots in the West in the past two decades were successful (9/11/01 and 7/7/05). Of course, they were among the most devastating, resulting in about 3,000 fatalities for 9/11 and 52 fatalities for 7/7. 9 were GIA plots against France, from 1994 to 1996 (I have counted the 1996 Paris Port Royal metro station bombing in this total. The total for all of these attacks is 17 fatalities) 3 were al-Qaeda inspired plots (1993 World Trade Center bombing, resulting in 6 fatalities; 2004 Madrid bombing, resulting in 191 fatalities; 2004 Bouyeri's assassination of Theo van Gogh) 10 Plots resulted in failure to explode (17%) 3 failures in networks that had succeeded elsewhere (2 by 1995 GIA network in France; and by 2004 Madrid network when bomb on the AVE train line near Toledo failed to detonate) 2 failures by al-Qaeda trained networks (2001 Shoe bomb plot and 7/ 21/05 London underground bombing plot) 1 failure in network of French Bosnian war veteran (Roubaix group) 4 failures in networks that had no foreign terrorist organization training (2004 Rotterdam plot; 2006 Koblenz train plot; 2007 Doctors' plot; and 2008 Exeter bomb plot) 36 Plots were interrupted through arrests (60%) It is interesting to note that for all the fear of al-Qaeda, the organization managed only two successful plots in the West in the last twenty years! The fact that they were so deadly overshadows this truth. Indeed, successful independent plots outnumber successful al-Qaeda plots in the West. However, both are eclipsed by the GIA, which infiltrated a team of trained terrorists to France, whose wave of terror in the mid-1990s accounts for almost two thirds of all successful global neo-jihadi bombings. This low rate of success (23%) should not be much comfort to intelligence or law enforcement agencies. In ten plots, the terrorists succeeded in setting their bombs down without being detected. The bombs simply did not detonate, which cannot be due to good intelligence or police work. So, the rate of a plot going to termination without being detected is 40%, a very high rate indeed, no cause for comfort. Figure 6. Extent of damages of global neo-jihadi terrorist plots. Lest the reader thinks that the cause for failure to detonate was the lack of training by homegrown wannabes, six out of the ten failures happened to groups that had been trained or been successful before. So, 60% of the failures to detonate were not due to poor training but to poor execution by experienced terrorists. It appears that either we are getting luckier or this terrorist threat is diminishing. In the United States, the last casualty dates back eight years to 9/11/01. There has not been even one plot that went to termination since then. In the rest of the West, there has not been a single casualty in the past four years. The last casualty dates back to 7/7/05, the first London underground plot. However, in the past four years, Europe has witnessed a series of bombs that failed to detonate: the 2005 second London underground plot (Vivace case); the 2006 German Koblenz trolley bombs; the 2007 London and Glasgow Doctors' plot; and the 2008 Exeter bomb plot by Nicky Reilly. The last three plots have no physical link to any transnational terrorist groups. How effective is formal terrorist training for the successful completion of a plot? Several critics have tried to downplay the recent surge of autonomous homegrown plots as less dangerous than those of formally trained terrorists. I analyzed the results of global neo- jihadi terrorist networks according to their type of training: al-Qaeda core training; al-Qaeda affiliates' training; or no formal training at all (al Qaeda inspired). Excluding the unsolved 1996 Paris Port Royal metro bombing because of lack of information, this leaves forty-five networks. But an untrained member of the Hofstad network, Mohammed Bouyeri, carried out a successful assassination on his own. His ``trained'' colleagues, Jason Walters and Ismail Akhnikh, had not been aware of his plan and provided no guidance or help. Therefore, I decided to code Bouyeri's assassination of Theo van Gogh as a separate network, and as al-Qaeda inspired. The results are the following: 16 AQ Core trained networks: 3 succeeded (1993 World Trade Center bombing; 9/11/01; and 7/7/05 London underground bombing) [19%] 2 failed to explode (2001 Shoe bomber; 7/21/05 London underground plot) 11 were detected and arrested before hand 10 AQ Affiliate trained networks 2 GIA networks succeeded (1994 AF hijack; 1995 wave of bombing in France) [20%] 1 failed to explode (1996 Lille plot) 7 were detected and arrested beforehand (including Hofstad network) 20 AQ Inspired networks (no formal training) 2 succeeded (2004 Madrid bombings & 2004 Bouyeri assassination of van Gogh)[10%, but only 5% if we don't count the assassination, which requires no training] 3 failed to explode 16 were detected and arrested beforehand. The above results seem to indicate that formal training matters. Both al-Qaeda core and al-Qaeda affiliate formal training resulted in an approximate success rate of 20%, while lack of training led to a success rate of 10%. So, training doubles the probability of success in a terrorist network. However, if the assassination of Theo van Gogh is eliminated from the sample, the resulting rate of success of the untrained networks falls to 5%. In this case, training would quadruple the probability of success in a terrorist network. Viewing the sample as a whole obscures the degradation of the importance of training in the past five years. During this period, of twelve trained terrorist networks, only one succeeded in causing any casualty, the 7/7/05 London underground bombing. Two untrained networks out of sixteen succeeded in inflicting casualties: the 2004 Madrid bombing--where the bombers got access to dynamite, det-cord and detonators, and did not have to manufacture their explosive--and the 2004 Bouyeri assassination of van Gogh. I am sorry to have been so lengthy in the presentation of the survey, but the devil is in the empirical details to escape another round of hysterical rhetoric so common in discussion of global neo- jihadi terrorism. Now that I've laid down the facts, let me address some of the unexamined assumptions, myths and misconceptions about the ``al Qaeda threat'' in Afghanistan and beyond. 1. The threat to the West has unfortunately expanded beyond al-Qaeda per se. The various terrorists attempting to carry out operations in the West for al-Qaeda allies or in its name clearly outnumber al-Qaeda operations. In the past five years, al-Qaeda core has been responsible for only 18% of these plots. 78% of these plots during this period have been carried out by homegrown terrorists, inspired by al-Qaeda, but with no connection with any formal transnational terrorist organization--evolving into a Leaderless Jihad. This survey does not include the new al Shabaab threat to the West, which has too recently surfaced to be included. But it stems from Somalia and not Afghanistan. 2. The dichotomy of the present policy options between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency is a false one. The choice is not between counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency, but between counter-terrorism and counter-terrorism plus counter-insurgency. No matter what happens in Afghanistan, all Western powers will continue to protect their homelands with a vigorous counter-terrorism campaign against al-Qaeda, its allies and its homegrown progeny. The policy option really boils down to, what is the added value of counter-insurgency in Afghanistan to a necessary and continuing counter-terrorism strategy worldwide? 3. The proposed counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan is at present irrelevant to the goal of disrupting, dismantling and defeating al-Qaeda, which is located in Pakistan. None of the plots in the West has any connection to any Afghan insurgent group, labeled under the umbrella name ``Afghan Taliban,'' be it a part of Mullah Omar's Quetta Shura Taliban, Jalaluddin Haqqani's Haqqani Network, or Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami. There has not been any Afghan in al-Qaeda in the past twenty years because of mutual resentment between al-Qaeda foreigners and Afghan locals. In the policy debate, there is an insidious confusion between Afghan Taliban and transnational terrorist organizations. Afghan fighters are parochial, have local goals and fight locally. They do not travel abroad and rarely within their own country. They are happy to kill Westerners in Afghanistan, but they are not a threat to Western homelands. Foreign presence is what has traditionally unified the usually fractious Afghan rivals against a common enemy. Their strategic interest is local, preserving their autonomy from what they perceive as a predatory corrupt unjust central government. They do not project to the West and do not share the internationalist agenda of al-Qaeda or its allied transnational terrorist organizations. 4. The second prong of the proposed counter-insurgency strategy in Afghanistan is the prevention of al-Qaeda's return to Afghanistan through a military surge. The assumption is that the return to power by the Taliban will automatically allow al- Qaeda to reconstitute in Afghanistan, complete with training camps and resurgence of al-Qaeda's ability to project to the West and threaten the homeland. a. The possibility of Afghan insurgents winning is not a sure thing. Twenty years ago, it took a far better armed and far more popular insurgency more than three years to take power after the complete withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. Unlike 1996, when the Taliban captured Kabul, the label Taliban now includes a collection of local insurgencies with some attempts at coordination on a larger scale. The Taliban is deeply divided and there is no evidence that it is in the process of consolidating its forces for a push on Kabul. Local Taliban forces can prevent foreign forces from protecting the local population, through their time honored tactics of ambushes and raids. General McChrystal is right: the situation in the countryside is grim. But this local resistance does not translate into deeply divided Taliban forces being able to coalesce in the near future into an offensive force capable of marching on to Kabul. Command and control frictions and divergent goals hamper their planning and coordination of operations. They lack popular support and have not demonstrated ability to project beyond their immediate locality. b. Taliban return to power will not mean an automatic new sanctuary for al-Qaeda. First, there is no reason for al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan. It seems safer in Pakistan at the moment. Indeed, al-Qaeda has so far not returned to Taliban controlled areas in Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda's relationship with Taliban factions has never been very smooth, despite the past public display of Usama bin Laden's pledge of bayat to Mullah Omar. Al-Qaeda leaders seem intimately involved in the Haqqani network in North Waziristan, less so with Mullah Omar's Quetta Shura, and even less with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's forces. Indeed, the presence of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan divided Taliban leaders before their downfall. Likewise, loyalty for Taliban leader Mullah Omar also divided al-Qaeda leadership. This complex relationship between al-Qaeda and Afghan Taliban factions opens up an opportunity for the U.S. Government to mobilize its political savvy based on a deep understanding of local history, culture and politics to prevent the return of a significant al- Qaeda presence in Afghanistan.\\4\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\4\\ See Mountstuart Elphinstone, 1815, An Account of the Kingdom of Caubul, and its Dependencies in Persia, Tartary, and India; Comprising a View of the Afghaun Nation, and a History of the Dooraunee Monarchy, London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown; Olaf Caroe, , 1958, The Pathans: 550 B.C.-A.D. 1957, Oxford: Oxford University Press; and Akbar Ahmed, 2004, Resistance and Control in Pakistan: Revised Edition, London: Routledge, for sophisticated examples of effective governance in the Afghan tribal areas. c. Even if a triumphant Taliban invites al-Qaeda to return to Afghanistan, its presence there will look very similar to its presence in the FATA. Times have changed. The presence of large sanctuaries in Afghanistan was predicated on Western not so benign neglect of the al-Qaeda funded camps there. This era is gone because Western powers will no longer tolerate them. There are many ways to prevent the return of al- Qaeda to Afghanistan besides a national counter- insurgency strategy. Vigilance through electronic monitoring, spatial surveillance, a networks of informants in contested territory, combined with the nearby stationing of a small force dedicated to physically eradicate any visible al-Qaeda presence in Afghanistan will prevent the return of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. The proper military mission in Afghanistan --------------------------------------------------------------------------- and elsewhere is sanctuary denial. 5. Counter-terrorism is working. The escalation from a more limited and focused counter-terrorism strategy to a larger combined counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency strategy (in a country devoid of the al-Qaeda presence!) is predicated on the assumption that the terrorist threat is either stable or increasing--meaning that counter-terrorism has failed. The timeline graphs clearly show that the threat is fading, from its high water mark of 2004. There has been no global neo- jihadi terrorist casualty in the United States in the past eight years and none in the West in general in the past four years. Of course, al-Qaeda is not dead as long as its top leadership is still alive. This cannot be attributed to a loss of intent from al-Qaeda and its militant rivals. From all indications, including recent debriefs of terrorist wannabes captured in Pakistan and the West, the respective leaders of global neo-jihadi terrorism are still enthusiastically plotting to hit the West and do not hesitate to proclaim their desire on the Internet. Nor is this due to the counter-insurgency in Afghanistan because al-Qaeda and its allies all have their training facilities in Pakistan. It is due to effective counter-terrorism strategy, which is on the brink of completely eliminating al-Qaeda. A dead organization will not be able to return to Afghanistan. 6. The reasons for the effectiveness of the counter- terrorism strategy so far are multiple. First and foremost is al-Qaeda's inability to grow. Unlike the pre-9/11/01 period, al-Qaeda leaders have generally not incorporated new recruits among its ranks. The leadership of al-Qaeda still harks back to the fight against the Soviets in the 1980s. Because he has been hiding full time, Osama bin Laden has not been able to appoint and train a new group of top leaders and there is no evidence that he trusts anyone whom he has not known from the anti- Soviet jihad. In the 1990s, al-Qaeda incorporated the brightest and most dedicated novices who came to train in its network of camps in Afghanistan. They became its cadres and trainers. In the past five years, al-Qaeda has not been able for the most part to incorporate new recruits among its ranks. Western novices traveling to Pakistan in the hope of making contact with al-Qaeda have been turned around and sent back to the West to carry out terrorist operations. Meanwhile, the success of the predator drone strike campaign on the Pakistani border has dramatically thinned the ranks of both al-Qaeda leaders and cadres. Now it appears that these strikes are also targeting al-Qaeda allies with a transnational agenda. 7. Protection of Western homeland involves an effective strategy of containment of the threat in the Afghan Pakistan area until it disappears for internal reasons. In the past five years, al-Qaeda or its transnational allies have not been able to infiltrate professional terrorists into the West, as Ramzi Youself did in New York in 1993 or the GIA did in France in 1995. None of the plots during that time involved any full time professional terrorist. This is probably due to good cooperation among intelligence agencies around the world, good intelligence databases and increased vigilance and security at airports around the world. To carry out operations in the West, these global neo-jihadi terrorist organizations are completely dependent on Western volunteers coming to the Pakistani border to meet terrorist groups or on inspiring young Western terrorist wannabes to carry out operations on their own without any guidance or training. These organizations are stuck with the people traveling to the border area to meet with them, mostly through chance encounters. These travelers are relatively few in number, totaling in the dozens at most. The emerging details from the terrorist trials and the interrogations of the Westerners captured in Pakistan are quite clear on this score. Terrorist organizations can no longer cherry pick the best candidates as they did in the 1990s. There is no al-Qaeda recruitment program: al-Qaeda and its allies are totally dependent on self selected volunteers, who come to Pakistan. Global neo-jiahdi terrorism also has no control over the young people who wish to carry out operations in the West in its names. The result is a dramatic degradation of the caliber of terrorist wannabes, resulting in the decrease in success of terrorist operations in the West despite the increased number of attempts. Containing those who travel to Pakistan for terrorist training is a counter-terrorism problem and is much easier problem to solve than transforming an adjacent nation through a national counter-insurgency strategy. The West has been doing well in this strategy of containment with Pakistan's active collaboration. 8. The decrease of global neo-jihadi terrorism in the last five years is testimony to the effectiveness of international and domestic intelligence as well as good police work. The timeline analysis of global neo-jihadi terrorism shows that the major threat to Western homelands is al-Qaeda inspired homegrown networks. Disrupting such homegrown plots has always been a domestic counter-terrorism mission through domestic intelligence and law enforcement. Indeed, there is a strong probability that the proposed counter-insurgency military surge may result in moral outrage in young Muslims in the West, who would take it upon themselves to carry out terrorist operations at home in response to the surge--just as the invasion in Iraq resulted in a dramatic increase in terrorist operations in the West. So, far from protecting the homeland, the surge may actually endanger it in the short term. After going through a learning process, Western law enforcement agencies, in coordination with their foreign counterparts, have done an effective job in protecting the homeland. 9. In conclusion, counter-terrorism works and is doing well against the global neo-jihadi terrorist threat. It consists of a combination of good domestic police work, good domestic intelligence, good cooperation with foreign domestic intelligence agencies, good airport security, good border control, keeping up the pressure on al-Qaeda and its transnational allies in Pakistan through arrests and Predator drone attacks, using political and economic skill to deny terrorist sanctuary in Pakistan, supporting the Pakistan military to dislodge foreign militants from Waziristan while sealing the border on the Afghan side, and continued sanctuary denial in Afghanistan. These are measures that will continue regardless of what is done in Afghanistan. There is definitely no necessity and very little value added for the counter- insurgency option, which is the most costly in terms of blood and treasure, probably the least likely to succeed and may even make things worse in the short run. 10. Counter-insurgency and nation building in Afghanistan may be important for regional reasons and I would be honored to address these complex issues at another time. I am pleased to see that the committee invited my former chief, Milton Bearden, to testify on these issues last week. I had the privilege to serve under him in Islamabad, where I spent almost three years in personal contact with the major Afghan Mujahedin commanders fighting against the Soviet Union. I stand ready to comment on counter-insurgency strategy and tactics in Afghanistan based on my personal experiences with important Afghan insurgents. But counter-insurgency in Afghanistan has little to do with global neo-jihadi terrorism and protecting the homeland. The Chairman. Thank you very much, Mr. Sageman. Mr. Bergen? STATEMENT OF PETER BERGEN, SENIOR RESEARCH FELLOW AND CO- DIRECTOR, COUNTERTERRORISM STRATEGY INITIATIVE, THE NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION, WASHINGTON, D.C. Mr. Bergen. Thank you very much, Senator Kerry and Senator Lugar and other members of the committee for this invitation to speak today. It really is an honor and a privilege to be here. I guess I am going to provide something of a threat assessment. First of all, the threat to the United States of a 9/11 attack is close to zero now. Al-Qaeda itself, if it got lucky, might be able to pull off something like the first Trade Center attack or maybe the Oklahoma City bombing. These would be second-order threats. They wouldn't change, reorient our entire national security policy. But al-Qaeda is able to kill hundreds of Americans overseas still. If the planes plot of the summer of 2006 had succeeded, seven American, Canadian, and British airliners would have gone down. Fifteen hundred people would have been in the middle of the Atlantic. Mostly, it would have been Brits, Canadians, and Americans. So that is sort of a threat assessment in terms of our--the United States interests. What are the pressure points that are being put on al-Qaeda right now? al-Qaeda is slightly pressured. The drone attacks obviously we have heard. Half the leadership in the federally administered tribal areas have been killed. I do caution something about the drone attacks. You know, when Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed, the violence in Iraq actually went up. So they are not a sufficient policy, but obviously, they are quite useful. Second, one of the biggest and most important strategic shifts since 9/11 is the changing view of the Pakistani public, military, and government. This is seismic. If you think about the center of gravity of this whole war, in a sense, it is for the Pakistani population. If they believe that it is in their interest to get rid of the Taliban, if they believe it is in their interest to get rid of al-Qaeda, we are in a very different situation. Now the operation in Swat by the Pakistani government against the Pakistani Taliban was very popular in Pakistan. Support for al-Qaeda, support for bin Laden, support for suicide bombing is cratering in Pakistan. It used to be 33 percent support in Pakistan for suicide bombings. It is now 5 percent. So this is a very positive development. This situation is also mirrored in the Muslim world in general, where support for suicide bombing has gone down to 12 percent in Indonesia from something like 30 percent, to 12 percent in Jordan from something like 30 percent--in country after country--because al-Qaeda keeps killing Muslim civilians. And this gets to the four strategic weaknesses that al- Qaeda has. It kills a lot of Muslim civilians. It doesn't have a positive vision of the future. If bin Laden was here testifying, you ask him, ``What are you trying to do?'' He would say the restoration of the caliphate. Well, when the caliphate existed, it was the Ottoman Empire, a relatively rational group of people. But what bin Laden means is Taliban-style theocracies from Indonesia to Morocco. Most Muslims don't want to live in that kind of utopia. The third problem that these groups have is that they have made a world of enemies. This is never a winning strategy. You are supposed to add to your allies, not your enemies. But bin Laden and al-Qaeda have said they are opposed to pretty much every government in the world--Jews, Christians, Muslims who don't precisely share their views, the Shia, international media, the United Nations. The list goes on and on. And because they won't make the real-world political compromises that are necessary, they will not be able to turn themselves into mass political movements like Hezbollah. So they have major strategic problems. These are being recognized around the Muslim world. They are even being criticized from people who used to be their supporters--for instance, major religious clerics in Saudi Arabia, former militants who have come out publicly against them. So in terms of losing the war of ideas, they are certainly losing those. On the other hand, al-Qaeda's obituary has been written many times, and it would be premature to be writing it during this hearing. The group has still preserved its leadership. Leadership is important. If Hitler had been killed in 1944 by von Stauffenberg, World War II would have ended a year earlier. Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri may not be in operational control of this movement because they can't call people on the phone, but they don't need to because they have the global communications revolution. They just release a videotape or an audiotape. And on those tapes are not only commanders' intent--kill Westerners, kill Jews--but often specific instructions like, for instance, we are going to react to the Danish cartoon controversy. Well, about 3 months after bin Laden made that statement in 2008, a suicide attacker blew up the Danish embassy in Islamabad, and there are many other examples. Another factor in their longevity is al-Qaeda--and I have got to disagree with my friend and colleague Marc Sageman here a little bit. Al-Qaeda has influenced the Taliban ideologically and tactically to a very great degree. The reason that we are having an epidemic of suicide attacks and beheadings of hostages and IED attacks is because the Taliban sent people to Iraq to learn from the insurgency, and they copycatted the insurgency. And al-Qaeda and the Taliban today are far closer than they were before 9/11. The idea that if the Taliban were in power, they wouldn't bring back al-Qaeda is absurd. The whole Taliban project has been about protecting al-Qaeda. And if international forces pulled out of Afghanistan or we lowered our commitment, the Taliban would eventually take control of parts of the country and could even take it over entirely not because the Taliban is so strong, but because the Afghan government and the Afghan military right now are so weak. And I have 7 seconds left, and I would just like to say then--because I will keep the 5-minute rule--that one of the most common myths, by the way, about Afghanistan is that Afghans are resistant to foreign forces. In poll after poll since the fall of the Taliban, 83 percent favorable, in 2005, views of international forces. In the most recent poll, 63 percent of Afghans had a favorable view of the U.S. military. Can we think of a country in the world, other than our own, which would have this kind of view? So Afghans want us to perform. They want international forces. They have had a totalitarian invasion, a civil war, and the Taliban. Obama doesn't have to be turning Afghanistan into Belgium, but they do want us to get it right and they do want us to stay. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bergen follows:] Prepared Statement of Peter Bergen Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar and other members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. My testimony will attempt to cover the following areas: al-Qaeda's current threat to the United States; to American interests around the world, and to US allies; likely targets that al-Qaeda will attack over the coming years and the kinds of tactics the group is likely to employ in the future; the impact of US counterterrorism measures on al-Qaeda as well as other factors that have an impact on the group's viability; the current status of al-Qaeda's closest allies; and will conclude with some broad observations about American policy in Afghanistan, and how that might impact al-Qaeda in the future, as this is a matter of current interest to many policymakers. A. AL-QAEDA'S THREAT TO THE AMERICAN HOMELAND. Al-Qaeda's ability to attack the United States directly is currently low. Why? First, the American Muslim community has rejected the al-Qaeda ideological virus. American Muslims have instead overwhelmingly signed up for the ``American Dream,'' enjoying higher incomes and educational levels than the average. Second, when jihadist terrorists have attacked the United States, they have arrived from outside the country. The 19 hijackers of 9/11, for instance, all came from elsewhere, while Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 Trade Center bombing, flew to New York from Pakistan. Today's no-fly list and other protective measures make entering the country much more difficult. Third, measures like the establishment of the National Counterterrorism Center, where officials from different branches of government share information and act on terrorist threats have made us safer. And so, a catastrophic mass-casualty assault in the United States along the lines of 9/11 is no longer plausible. But the recent case of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghan-American resident of Denver Colorado, does raise some serious concerns about al-Qaeda's continued ability to target the United States. Unlike many of the post- 9/11 American terrorism cases, Zazi's case does not appear to have been informant-driven. Zazi appears to have been either the leader or a foot soldier in the first genuine al-Qaeda sleeper cell discovered in the United States in the past several years. Zazi travelled to Pakistan in late August 2008 where by his own admission he received training on explosives from al-Qaeda in the Pakistani tribal regions along the Afghan border. On Zazi's laptop computer the FBI discovered he had stored pages of handwritten notes about the manufacture and initiation of explosives and the components of various detonators and fusing systems, technical know-how he had picked up at one of al-Qaeda's training facilities in the tribal regions sometime between the late summer of 2008 and January 2009, when he returned to the United States. In the Denver area over the summer of 2009 Zazi bought at least 18 bottles of hydrogen peroxide-based hair products and was allegedly planning to use the seemingly innocuous hair bleach to assemble deadly homemade bombs. Early last month, in a Denver motel room that he had rented for that purpose, Zazi laboriously mixed up batches of the noxious chemicals before he was arrested. The Zazi case is a reminder of al-Qaeda's ability to attract recruits who are ``clean skins'' without previous criminal records or known terrorist associations and who are quite familiar with the West- Zazi's family first arrived in the United States when he was fourteen. And although much of the case still remains murky, Zazi appears to have had associates in the U.S. who traveled with him to Pakistan and may have been helping him to assemble large quantities of hydrogen peroxide. And if the government's allegations are correct and Zazi had managed to carry out his plans, he could have killed scores of Americans. That said, today the al-Qaeda organization no longer poses a direct national security threat to the United States itself, but rather poses a second-order threat in which the worst case scenario would be an al- Qaeda-trained terrorist managing to pull off an attack on the scale of something in between the 1993 Trade Center attack, which killed six, and the Oklahoma City bombing of 1995, which killed 168. While this, of course, would be tragic, it would not constitute a mass casualty attack sufficiently large in scale to reorient American national security policy completely as the 9/11 attacks did. B. AL-QAEDA'S THREAT TO AMERICAN INTERESTS AND ALLIES OVERSEAS. The threat posed by al-Qaeda to American interests and allies overseas continues to be somewhat high. Despite all the pressure placed on al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 9/11, training has continued in Pakistan's tribal areas and is the common link between the terrorist group's ``successes'' and its near-misses since then; for instance, the deadliest terrorist attack in British history--the four suicide bombings on London's transportation system on July 7, 2005, which killed 52 commuters--was directed by al-Qaeda from the tribal regions. The four bombs that detonated in London on what became known as 7/7 were all hydrogen peroxide-based devices. This has become something of a signature of plots that have a connection to Pakistani training camps. Two weeks after the 7/7 attacks on July 21, 2005 there was a second wave of hydrogen peroxide-based bombs set off in London, this one organized by a cell of Somali and Eritrean men who were first- generation immigrants to the U.K. Luckily their bombs were ineffective. Hydrogen peroxide-based bombs would again be the signature of a cell of British Pakistanis who plotted to bring down seven passenger jets flying to the United States and Canada from the U.K. during the summer of 2006. The plotters distilled hydrogen peroxide to manufacture liquid explosives, which they assembled in an apartment-turned-bomb factory in East London that they had recently purchased for the cash equivalent of some $200,000. The case resulted in the immediate ban of all carry-on liquids and gels, and rules were later put in place to limit the amounts of these items that travelers could bring on planes. The `planes plot' conspirators were arrested in August 2006 and in subsequent congressional testimony Lieutenant General Michael Maples, the head of the US Defense Intelligence Agency, said the plot was ``directed by al-Qaeda leadership in Pakistan.'' \\1\\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \\1\\ Michael Maples, ``Current and Projected National Security Threats to the United States,'' Statement for the record, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, January 11, 2007. http://www.dia.mil/ publicaffairs. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- During the trial of the eight men accused in the `planes plot' the prosecution argued that some 1,500 passengers would have died if all seven planes had been brought down. The plot, which was entering its final stages in the summer of 2006, seemed designed to ``celebrate'' the upcoming fifth anniversary of 9/11 by once again targeting commercial aviation, a particular obsession of al-Qaeda. Most of the victims of the attacks would have been Americans, Britons and Canadians. The seriousness of the intent of the plotters can be seen in the fact that six of them made ``martyrdom'' videotapes recovered by British investigators. At their trial prosecutors played the video made by the ringleader, 25-year old Abdullah Ahmed Ali. Against a backdrop of a black flag adorned with flowing Arabic script and dressed in a Palestinian-style black-and-white checkered head scarf.
