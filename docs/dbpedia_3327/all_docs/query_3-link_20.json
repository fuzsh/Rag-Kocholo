From the fact that the five nectarian substances, dropped on the hoods (of Sesba) from Siva’s head, were sprinkled by him flTpendra), it is concluded that the serpent s'esha became pare though he has two tongues (and) carries poison in his month.

At Ramathirfcham, in the reign ot Mnmraadi Bhima, the Jain teacher Trikalayogi Siddhanathadeva of Desigana and teacher of Viraaladitya is said to have constructed Rama konda. 21 At Koramarapddi, Ghalukyanarayana Yelampati Triumala- rajadeva maharaja preformed service to Yedadri S'rinarasimhadeva. The Telugu Pallavas of Guntur : These Pallavas maintar ned Yari?asramadharma as an epithet in their prasasti is patidevagurn- dvija bhaktnla i.e. devotees of lord, god, preceptor and Brahmins. The rulers and their ministers and subordinates made many grants to temples of Shva and Buddha all over the kingdom. Somana preggada built many temples at Guntur and lighted perpetual lamps in the temples at Draksbarama etc. (Pancharama tirthas.) His records dated A.D 1147 at Yenamadala and Bapatia show that he provided for perpe- tual lamps in the temples of Mabadeva at Bhimavaram, Dakaremi, Yalkolanu, Drachyaramapuri, S'rimadaraaradalu - the Pancharamas in Andhradharani. and Buddhadevas in them, Mabasena at Cbebrole Hunkarasankari at Bidapurara, and Shnmaliesvara at Bezvada and to gods at Gudipudi, Yirabhadreswaram, Bhavapattana, Ghantasala, Gotaram, Elesvaram, vegisvaram, undaville, velpnr, Guntur and kadalpalle, i In A.D 1159 he made a grant to Yirabhadresvara maha- deva at Pattisam.

Somana donated the lamps for Mabadeva and Buddhadeva in each of the FancharSma tirthas, enumerated in the records at the rate of two gods in each place. Thus, in the 12tb century A.D, in Andhra de^'a, the Pancharatnatirfchas were celebrated centres of S'aivisra and Buddhism, and S^iva and Bnddha were worshipped side by side either in the same shrine or in different shrines in the same temple or in separate temples of which there is no evidence. And not only a few Buddhists bnt multitudes of Hindus adoring fi'iva at Panchatirthas paid their adorations to Bnddhadeva as well in the Pancharamas. Probably, tirfcha in the Hindu terminology is named as arama i.e. perhapsr vihara in the terminology of the Budclhists. And both ar® combined in the name panchararaa tirthas. Thus, Buddhism and HindTiism lost their rivalry and Buddhism was taken into the fold of Hinduism. Tammubhima built choultries and water houses. About A.D 1188, Bezvada was known as Dakshina Varanasi. SivayOgi Mallaya. a devotee of MallSswara lived on Indmkila3ri. and provided for worship to the god. 2 Another S'ivaySgi Madayadeva who waq doing pens nee on Indrakilaparvata without taking food in A.D 1232 celebrated the marriage of the god and goddess at Bezvada. 3 The Pallavas of Nellsre : The Palhvas of Nellore were Saivites, though they did not persecute Vaishuivism.

Some rulers had Vaisbpavite leanings too. K ng Abhideva Malideva is described as the abode of the grace of of Kamakotyambika and Varadaraja of Kanchi.^ Some rulers were devotees of Venkatanatha of Tirupati.

THE HISTORY OE ANDHRA COUNTRY ( 1000 - 1500 ) 1 ^ to have fought, S^iva at the foot of the Indrakiladri before obtaining from him Pasnnata^tra. A record of the 9th century in the temple records the building of the tempie of Kumaraswami by Yuddhamalla alias Nriparudra in the name of his grandfather Mallapa. So **How a temple dedicated to Kumara (skhanda) generally worshipped in form of an image came to be the shrine of a formless lings*’ 27 is ^ot clear* Bat this must have been due to that the Saivacharyas were bent on establishing the superiority of s'aivism to all other creeds. By the time rtf Pandita’s visit to Bezavada in the l‘2th century A.D, Karttikeya was converted to Malfevara. Vijayagandagopala’s rec:>rd5 in the Vishnu temples e.g. at Tirumala, invoke the protection of the .s'rivaishnavas to the donations made as his records in S'iva temples place the charities under the protection of the Mahes'varas e g, Sulurpet Being devotees of ^ri\" venkatanafeha, to Telngn Pallavas. the Yadavarayas, Sambhuvarayas provided for nityadipara and nityanaivedy^am, daily lamp lighting and food offering and festivals to temples at Tirumala and Tirupati. In this period camphor was provided for lamps and offerings Vijayaganda gopala’s inscriptions “illustrate the procedure regarding arrangements for the service of lamp lighting through donations of gold and silver coin or through gift of cows In this period, the number of temples festivals multiplied for in addition to the Brahmstsavams - tirukodi- tininal celebrated in the months of Purattasi and margali , similar festivals were established in the months of Adi at Tirumala for Shi. venkates'vara and. Ani in Tirupati for S'rigovindaraja besides the usual annual festival held in Tirupati. 2?^ Religious preceptors and maths : sh-isankaracharva or S'ankaraysgi of the math at Gonjeevaram finds mention in the c.p. grant of Vijayagar.dagopala ‘^0 This s'ankara is probably identical with the occupant of the Kanskotipitba in the matta at Gonjeevaram which tradition says was founded by the great s-ankaracharya. The Kama- kotipifcha possesses some lands here even now and the math is to the west of the abode of Lord .of Hastis^aila. Golakimatha on sWailam was presided over by Bajagnru, His desciple S'antas'iva is heard of from a Tripurantakam inscription of Vijayaganrfagopala.

Tiruj^a- nasambhandamatha was at Tiruvorriyur and at Timkaehchaiyur attached to the temple was Tyagavinodamatha within the precincts of th® temple. 32 Private life : King Inumadi is compared to IShairava m farmness of character and to Kandarp\\ in appearance. Vijaysganda- gOpala and Alladapemmaya were devotees of Kamakotyarnbika Devara- giyar alias Pernmandi Arasiyar was the queen of Vi jayagandagoptrla. Pirainara Siradiyar a dancing girl made substantial gifts to the temple at Tirnppalaivanam and was conferred hereditarily the right to wave chamara to the god during car processions. Other Fallavas : Vijayaditya of Pantrala, in A.D 1261 provided for celebrating amavasva ntsavas i e new moon festivals amutupadi, and satupallu to Marganaraya^a perumal at Peutrala. King Ahobales'vara built the shrine of god Trikut^swara inside the prakara of the vaidyanafeha temple In A.D 1254 Khanderaya installed an image of S'iva in the temple and Kachalamba, sister of Ahobafevara made gifts to the temple In A.D 1182 Chiddanadeva provided for the service of the god Indrgs'Vara of Pushpagiri, after washing the feet of Palaya Mallaya, son of s'ankapadeva.

The dynasties in Kalinga - The Matsyas of Oddadi The Matsyas were Vaishnavaites and upholders of Varpash'amadharma. Among the snb.sects in the fourth caste figure Pedaraunuti and Konda- munuti of Pedamunuti Vijaya’s daughters, t Suraraa was the queen of Arjuna and Bimmala was the queen of Annava choda of the Kona Haihayas. The Matsyrs made many grants to the temples of Vishnu. God Lakshminarasimha at Simhachalam, one of the most celebrated Vaish^avaite centres, was the protecting deity of the Matsya kingdom* SVivism was not neglected as seen from the Matsya grants at Draksha- rama. Madhava vMadhva) religion was on the ascendant and some of the acharyas had influence over the Matsya kings. On the basis of some important donations, the rulers assumed epithets indicative of their religion. Arjuna was a Narasimhavardhana Annama a Gspalavardhana, Mankaditya a Srirangavardhana and so 32 1t 3 T. T: 3S. 210 of 1923\" 34^ NeU ins. II KR ^ 35. Mack MS 15-4-23 MS pp 88-93. 36. 321 of 1905 : S.

The many details in grants to temples of Vishnu e g. Simhachalam are in striking contrast to the comparatively few details in grants to S'iva temples, e.g Draksharama. Pleasures of life - bath, food, dress, decoration, sleep etc. and persons attendant on the god were all essential for Lakshminrisimha, and these were accorded by his devofcess, where as worshippers of Bhimes'vara propitiated himby providing for lamps in the presence of the god. At Gudivada, 6 miles south of Sringavarapukota stands a temple of Brahamalinga. Some of the festivals of Bhimgs'vara of Draksharama came to light from the Matsya inscriptions.

D if kings, Vsdde, Turka, and Telugu, and their subordinates steal the cows, they incur the sin of killing a Brahmin, is The Yadavas of Addanki : They built some temples and made many grants to them. In A.D 1249’ Madhavanayaka conse- creted Maltes-vara in the temple st Nagnlappalapadn and made grants '0 priests, Brahmins, Niyggi and Vaidiki, servants, barbers and so orth. 1 At Tetidlunr, to the Madhavgraya temples, grants were made by Singadeva and Sarankapapi.

The legend says that the first two were great sages doing penance on r-he hill, whereas king Sarngadhara was a devotee of theirs. On account of their greatness, idols were set up to be wor- shipped. 5 Obviously, Sarngadhara is the king of the Chakranarayaoa line and this speaks for his popularity. Tradition was that in A,D 1179 Eamachandrajosyulu visited the court of Gajapati Sri Ramadeva at the capital Addanki and obtained his favour by showing his learning. This ruler is neither a Gajapati nor a Yadava of Devagiri but is identi- cal with Sarangapanideva a.s the Pate and the Capital support the identification. The king and Jssyulu visited Mskshagundam (Cumbum tiliiq) and the former provided for worship to the God and gave land to Josyulu recording it in a c.p. charter. As Jos^yulu built the village and lived there, his descendants acquired the family name Mok-sha- giindam varu .6 The Yadavas of Alavulapadu : A title in the pras^asti of the kings is Chatiirvar^iasrama dhanna raksha^ia. 7 When the Yadava armies perished in the presence of Somes' vara^ to set at nought the fears of the Yadavas, Trimurtis it is believed, told Yogamaya that» being the daughter of Nanda and Vasudeva, she would prosper and be honoured by all, praised by her eighteen names and offerings and sacri- fices would be made to her. Of the eighteen incarnations in eighteen shrines, she is Horaakriti at Pithapur, Bhagirathi on both the banks of Paleru and so forth. Alavulapadu was the holy place of Bhagli-athi bnrga. ^ Festivals : At Sangames'varam, which is at the meeting place of Mak§ru and Palgru, the S'ivaratri festival is celebrated grandly to this day in the Sangamegwara temple. In the vicinity of Pancha- lingala Konda, near Alavulapadu. Ganga tirumallu are held every year for vais'akha purnima. It attracts people from Kanigiri and Kandukur tracts. On the other side of the shrine is the temple of Ganga. 10 The people worship Ganga and Kstamaraju, desiring the safety of their cattle. Even now, while taking out cattle to jungles, shepherds promise presents to Katamaraju, on the safe return of the cattle, and do accordingly. There are many temples of Katamaraju, in which the images of Ganga are found. 5. Nell, Db. G{\\zetteer p 362. 6. Mack. Ms. 15-3-1. 7. NVII. Ins. II KR 26 8. Nell* Ins. II KR 26 9.

The temple of Paras^urames'vara is dated back to an early time. Peddinayaka built an enclosed varandah and mandapa to the temple, in the reign of Ambadeva. The residents of Pottapinadii mention the Chitramelimandapa to raise money to build an embank- ment from the Cheyyaru to the temple mentioned as Parasuramis'vara Mudaiyanayanar. ® Chodaraya constructed the inner prakara and mandapa in the temple, planted a cocoanut garden round it, and built feeding houses to the temples of Bhairava and Ramanatha. ^ According to the tradition, the Parasnram^vara temple was built by the Yaddes, ie the Kayasthas, by Goderaya, who, no doubt, made substantial additions to the temple. The temple of Trefevara and other shrines Were renovated by the Kayasthas. Parasuramis'vara was also known as Gadadhares'vara. 8 At Peddanapadu, the Kayasthas made additions to temples. Tradition has it that there was a temple of S'iva and a shrine of Madanagopala, built by a Chola king. Then Ambadeva, during his halt there with his army, on the way to Rameswaram, being commanded by God chennakes'ava of Markarpur in his dream, built a temple and set up the idol which was unearthed there. 9 He repaired other temples. At Tripurantakam in, in A.D 1294, Adidemma presen- ted a golden image of goddess Trailokya snndari and married her to Tripuranfcaka, and provided for procession and festivals of the god and goddess. 19 At Joti in A.D 1247, chenti Baminayadu built the com- pound wall and gopura of the temple of Jotinatha.

Is'nagurudeva was a S'aivachaiya probably of this math, S'antas/iva Des'ika was the guru of Janniga and belonged to Basavagolakimatha of ySr^ailam* Sadas'ivaguru is perhaps a mistake for Santapurvasivadesika* Tryam- baka S'iva was probably the preceptor of Tripurantaka. The state- ment that Tripurantaka was the pupil of Aghorssdva, of the math in Cuddapah district is mistaken. ^6 Aghoras'iva's pupil was Tripurantaka s'iva. To both the preceptor and pupil, grants were made by Tripu- rantaka, son of Ambadeva, and pupil of Aghoras^iva.^'' Ambadgva was also a pupil of Aghfirajuva. S'rigurudeva is heard, of from a record at Gangavararn. Nandaguva was a pupil of Tryambaka sdva, led a deputation to Ambadeva, and in return got Gangavaiam, near Penu- konda from Tryumbakasiva.

The Kalarankeas orerinally lived st s'ri fi'ailam and Alampnrara. They worshipped S'akti and were always bachelors. 12 Xannichoda refers to the worship of S'ri-chakra and resort to drink, the cnstoms of the Kalamnkhas whose teachings were widespread in the period. The other divisions among S'aiva asce- tics 'were s^iddha saivap, t^s/upatas, and mahavratins. According to the S'uddhas’aivas, the five acts of creation, continuance, destination and so forth were accomplished by Siva, whereas some believe that Siva creates only with the help of Parvafi is The mahavratins aretbesame as the Kapalikas and Nannichoda in the context of Rati addressing Man- matha not to disturb s'iva, savs that Siva was engaged in the Mabev- ratva, Bbairavntamtra was in vogue a.s seen from the building of tem- ples of Bhairava and Vandhvavasini. Nannichoda has written much about Baivism in his work Kumarasambhava which mirrors the con- ditions. He says that a fool could not under.stind the diffrence between Siva and Bakti, and mentions the Paramamahasvara building huge tem- nles of Ganesa. He praised Siva in two verses having Nagabandha and Miiraja banddha and described Nilakantha appearing as an incarnation of love to Parvati. 14 Potana in the 15 th century A.D Imentiona that Nilakantha as shown by the four Vedas was the greatest of the gods and has given Nilakentha stavara in a few verses, is Nantichoda struck the highest note in the standard of Sringara while picturing the mental and physical completion or union of Siva and Parvati in the form of Arthanarisvara. 11.

THE HISTORY OF aNDHRA COUNTRY (1000-1500) 2? Private life : Some of the kings had more than one wife. Tribhuvanamalla G. M, had fhree qaeens, Machala and Tribhuvana. Some of the smiiseraents of girls were playing with dolls, and swimm- hig. Nannichoda refers to woman arranging chilka dollka dells: ivory dolls, best glass bannrulu and so forth in rows, build doll houses, cook ’doll food, and celebrate the marriages of dolls. Women used to swam lying flat on their backs with head upwards in water. Nanni- choda says that Parvati drew rangavalli with Kasmira, manjishfea, garuda sapphiree and pearls and bathed in scented luke, warm water, Dharagriha set with arrangement for shower bath was used by her. iS Play of women in water is described by Nannichoda. They throw water on one another with sirenges filled with baishmira waters; with Karayantra and Jalayantra?, they press water on one another, Pre- ssing water thorough sirenges. each holding the other and ducking in waters and pressing Jaladhars, they played in water Naonichoda gives a fine description of Manraatha 20 and brings out the wisdom of Rati, when Maninatha was to go to distract Sive from penance, as ordered by Boahmr, Rati tells him that he would not be able to boar the fire of the third eye of Siva and Brahma, jealous of him as he was liked by women, planned to kill him this way. 21 Bat Manmatha felf confident of his powers and said that Siva was no exception to the bond of love inherent iy humanity. Poytala i e. false head was one of the implements of burgalars. For passing through holes into houses, to see whether the inmates were awake or asleep, they used to push the false head through the holes. An expert in Rasavadas'astra, Naimichoda refers to the turning of baser metals into gold by dhumavedi and s^abdavedhi. In one place he says that none could get at the truth of women's minds, 22 reminding ns of similar description of S'rinatha in S'ringara naishadha. He also refers to Magalanjij^alu i.e. men prostitutes who dressing themselves attractively by artificial means deceived women.

In the words of Professor S'astri, ‘Tt is one of the xOmarkable achievements of medieval Hinduism to have harnessed the religious emotions of man in the effective service of society. The temple and the math together with the agrahara, the chaturv^diman- galam of Choda inscriptions, are the most typical expressions of this phase of South Indian religion/’ ^ These Nellore cholas did much to foster these in the Telugu land. They maintained Var^as'roma dharma. Nellore had good Brahmins. Katana refers to Brahmins who g ving up studies, caste, and homes went to jungles, became, one with the Boyas and took to highway robbery. 2 Vi jSanesrvara specifies the sixteen karmas for all with the difference that, in the case of Brahmins they are performed with sacred incantations. ^ Tikkana in Yijaya- POuamu refers to^ the prosperous condition of the vais^yas.

S'aivism : Generally, the rulers were S'aivdtes and *’as s'aivisrn like many other manifestations of ^atter dav Hinduism, requi- red its followers to obtain it' initiation fioxu a guru t 3 yai pre(‘.eptors were beard of. j^eithei tba rulers nor the rule i were nan* »w sectarians to avoid the worship of one god in preference to that of another. Non® were exclusively devoted to either S'iva or Vishnu, but to both barring the few adherents of Viras'aivism and Viravaisbriavism, S'ankara's Advaitism was the basis for this religious toleration. The people must have fell', the need for one God symbolising both Vishpu and S^iva in the revival of the concept of Hariharanatha, which is ancient. For there are fine images of god Harihara belonging to the period from the firth LO the eighth century A.D in Greater India e.g. Java, Malaya etc. Besides, Venkates^vara at TirUpati was originally Harihara, For, Peyalvar who lived at the end of the fourth and the beginning of the 5th century AD describes *'how the kindly god of Tirumalai unites in himself the twin forms of .S'iva p.nd Yishnud’^ Some time early in his hfe, Tikkana re-discovered this for, in his Bamayaiga, be refers lo it; indirfctly'. The worship of Hariham wa*'^ popular and widespread =i.nc! ^1‘jkkana propagated and gave it permar.ent form in his Mahabharata- the most sacred arjd bes!; work in the entire range of Teiugu literaturife ot the Andhras, ^otri religious - viwpoint being the FanchamaySda and literary point of view Tikkana's Bhatata is dedicated to God Hari haraoatha.

Almost every verse in praise of Hariharanatha is well balanced from the point of Vaishnavates and s'aivates in two even halves as in the concept of a Ardhanaris'vara and his first verse in the beginning of Yirataparva and the sanskit sloka both in adoration of Harihara are superb* It has been said that his worship of Hariharanatha '■ a deity neither exclusi- vely vaishnava nor exclusively S'aiva but both at the same time speaks for his broad religions outlook. Some opine that Tikkana by Hariharanatha does not refer to the god in the templs at Nellore but sadvayanirgunabrahma, the lord of both Hari and Eara worshipped by Advaitins and that the advaita sampradaya is seeri in the verses towards the end of each canto. Thus Tikkana was the first to pre'ich advaitism in Tftlngu. But this need not deny Tikkna referring to the god worshi- pped in the Harihara temple at Nellore. As a matter of fact Tikkana refers to god Harihara arcbavatara and not mere concept for, he says that god Hariharanatha accompanied by Karamana appeared to him in hivS dream and spoke to him. Tikkana describes him as Sarves'vara, Jagannatha and Lakshmis'vara And the Harihara temple in Nelloro was built in his time. “In the stress of the conflict with heretical rivals who denied the sanctity of the Veda and questioned the existe- nce of the deity, there arose within Hinduism a tendency to close up its ranks and foster a religious synchretism which found room in the fold of its orthodoxy for all forms of theistic belief. This synchretism was based on the conception of Trimurti the three fold manifestation of the same god head. ” The concept of Hariharanatha is an approach towards the same goal* In the propagation of his cult. Tikkana enjo* yed regal patronage* For king Manmasiddhi III was devoted t.oS'ripati- Gauripati, Vanipati, and worshipped Sun, s'iva and Vishnn. n Tikka. na's description of Gapes'a taking water from the head of S'iva and pouring it on Sahasraksha at the base of the pitha and taking lotuses as though to worahip S'iva 12 ig unique.

Rajagandagopala devoted to Arulala perumai, i.e. varadaraja calls himself at the end of some records'* the servant who bears the stamp of the feet of the blessed Arulanatha- S'ri arulalanatha padalanchenasya or Allada natha in place of his signature. Tikka*s favourite god was Danavamurari Perumandideva i.e. Yishnu. Proba- bly he called himself Danavamurari Bantara of Vidisa*’ as it is the custom among S'rivaishnavas to name themselves as the servant or dasa of their favourite deity, and some of his coins bear the legend - Danavamurari Bentari-Tikkam speaks about Vaishnavadharraa, Vish- 0i.jnanasvari7pa, and Vishnunama prabhava in Bharata. Buddhism and Jainism also prevailed Tradition records tha^ when Tikkana Somayaji visited (Ja^apati at Warangal, he invited con- troversy with the Snddhists and Jains, vanquished them and brought about the stoppage of worship in thirty-six Jain bastis and the perse* cution of Jains and Buddhists by Ganapati, some killed, some driven out etc. For want of inscriptional data, and in the light of the Ifle of the poet and the spirit of his message, this is regarded as base - life The statement that Tikkana was a true advaitin with the breadth of vision that all religions are so many ways leading to the supreme reality, the Brahman cannot be true wholly for Tikkana’s advaitism would not have extended to Buddhi^jra and Janism though to Hinduism m all its divisions. He also speaks about S'iva and Pas'upatavrata. Temples: “The temple and the Math were two great gifts of medi- eval Hinduism to Southern India. It was under the cholas that these ins. titutions entered on a process of gradual expansion and adoptation which attracted the imagination of the populace and the banefactions of the rich. In raising temples the Telugu cholas followed the Great cholas and “ several temples of the period and also chief Icons in them were called after the ruling kings who established them. “ Similarly mini- sters, officials, and rich persons built tern pies named after themselves or those dear to them.

NachanasOnena dedicated his Uttara Harivams'a and Baicharaju Venhatenatha, his Panchatantra to this god. Venkatanatha of the 16 th century A,D says that Tikka Yanjva, Somanatna and himself were devoted to. Harinaranatha. The conclusion that Hirihara of Somana and Venkatanatha was not of NellOre on the ground that, the posts were not natives of the place. 28 is wrong, for without being natives they could have been devotees of that god. Festivals : These cholas instituted many ser\\ices in the Vjshnu varadaraja temple at Little Conjeevaram commonly known as Tirnvottiyur or Attiydr, All being the Tamil for Sanakrit Hastin, Alin- tikka established the permanent service called Gandagopalasandi in the temple in A,D 1231 and Rajagandagopala provided the service-Rajaga- ndagopalasandi after his own name.

Tradition records that when Tiklrana came back defeated in the battle, his wife arranged for his bath in a corner, where women bathe, kept a cot for privacy and a bsll of turmeric on it and brought water in a vessel for ’him. He felt sad and enquired the cause for this strange behaviour, she replied when you had shown your back to the enemies they laughed, so we are three women now and why should you feel sorry ” After bath when he sat for food, his mother served him curdled milk* When he questioned she retorted thus the cattle went with you and came back defeated.
