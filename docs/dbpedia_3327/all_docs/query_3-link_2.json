        "text": "THE ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nAMSTERDAM, Netherlands — PSV Eindhoven rallied to tie VVV Venlo 1-1 on Sunday and stay top of the Dutch First Division soccer league standings.\n\nVVV striker Rachid Ofrany beat Gomes in the second minute, before Balasz Dzsudzsak tied it in the 12th.\n\nVVV was reduced to 10 men after 32 minutes when Peter Reekers was sent off for his second yellow card but PSV could not take advantage.\n\nThe tie left PSV with 40 points, three ahead of Ajax, which also tied NEC Nijmegen 1-1 to leave the top two places unchanged.\n\nNEC took the lead in the 16th minute through a powerful shot from Jeremain Lens and held out against Ajax with several saves by goalkeeper Gabor Babos. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar tied it in the 74th, sliding home a pass from Kenneth Perez.\n\n\"Our first half was below par,\" Ajax coach Adrie Koster said. \"Too many players didn’t play to their full potential.\"\n\nFeyenoord remained third despite a lackluster performance Friday night in losing its Rotterdam derby to Excelsior 2-1.\n\nFC Twente went into fourth place with a 3-1 victory over Groningen, which dropped to fifth. Striker Blaise N’Kufo scored his team’s first and third goals — his 15th and 16th of the season — and helped set up the second, scored by Stein Huysegems. Goran Lovre had given Groningen hope by tying it two minutes after halftime.\n\nIn other weekend matches, it was SC Heerenveen 4, AZ Alkmaar 0; FC Utrecht 3, Roda JC 1; NAC Breda 1, Willem II 0; Vitesse Arnhem 2, Heracles Almelo 0; and Sparta Rotterdam 6, De Graafschap 1."
