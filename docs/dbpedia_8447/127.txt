Alabama, the 22nd state to join the union in 1819, is in the southern United States known as the "Heart of Dixie." In what is now Alabama, people have been living there for at least 10,000 years. In the 16th century, Europeans began to explore the area. Alabama's economy was based on cotton and slave labour throughout the first part of the nineteenth century. Segregation of blacks and whites persisted in much of the South after the war. In the mid-twentieth century, Alabama was the epicentre of the American Civil Rights Movement. Jobs in aerospace, agriculture, auto industry, and the service sector fuelled the state's economy in the early twenty-first century.

2. Arizona:

Arizona is the 14th most populous state and the sixth-largest in the United States. It is situated in the southwestern part of the United States.

Arizona (often known as the Copper State) is divided into 15 counties. Phoenix is the state capital. Arizona's postal abbreviation is AZ.

On the north-western tip of North America's continent is a vast peninsula known as Alaska. Alaska's westernmost section is in the Eastern Hemisphere since the 180th meridian runs across the Aleutian Islands. As a result, Alaska is technically in both hemispheres. The Beaufort Sea and the Arctic Ocean border Alaska at north; the Yukon Territory and British Columbia province border Alaska at east; the Gulf of Alaska and the Pacific Ocean border Alaska are on the south. The Bering Strait and the Bering Sea border Alaska are on the west, and the Chukchi Sea border Alaska are on the northwest. Juneau, the state capital, is located near the panhandle region in the state's southeast.

4. Arkansas:

It is the most populous and third-largest U.S. state by area, with about 39.5 million persons spread throughout a total area of around 163,696 square miles (423,970 km2). It is also North America's most crowded sub-national entity and the world's 34th most crowded. The Greater Los Angeles area and San Francisco Bay area are the country's second and fifth most crowded urban areas, with over 18.7 million persons in the former and over 9.6 million in the latter. The economy of California's is the world's largest sub-national economy, has a gross state output of $3.2 trillion compared with 2019. It would be the 37th most crowded country and the fifth-largest economy in the world by 2020.

6. Colorado:

Colorado is a state located in the Western United States. The adjective "Colorado" comes from the Spanish word "ruddy," which describes the hue of red sandstone. On February 28, 1861, the Territory of Colorado was formed, and on August 1, 1876, U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant accepted Proclamation 230, admitting Colorado as the 38th state in the Union.

Colorado's population was 5,773,714 people in the 2020 United States Census, up 14.80 per cent from the 2010 census. The Linden Meier Site, which contains items dating from around 9200 BCE to 1000 BCE, has been occupied by Native Americans for more than 13,000 years; the eastern side of the Rocky Mountains was an important migration route for early peoples that migrated throughout the Americas.
