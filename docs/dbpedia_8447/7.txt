LET'S EXPLORE THE UNITED STATES' REGIONS

The United States is comprised of 50 states and 1 federal district, the district of Columbia, that serves as the seat of our Nation Capital plus several territories and islands scattered across the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. Of the main 50 States only 2 are not found in the continental United States -- Alaska and Hawaii both on the pacific side respectively North and South.

The land area of the entire United States is approximately 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2), with the contiguous United States making up 2,959,064 square miles (7,663,940.6 km2.)

Quick Stats

Horizontal Width: 2,680 miles (4313 km.)

Vertical Length: 1,582 miles (2546 km.).

United States area: 3,800,000 square miles (9,841,955 km2)*

* You could easily compare the United States to the size of Europe (10,180,000 sq. km.)

Suffice to see the nation is frequently divided into regions and subregions to better differentiate the territory based on climate, culture, geographical location and so on. Although each governmental agency has a slightly different way to categorize and dive the US territory in regions, we can at least identify 5 different regions -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Southwest and The West.

Although this is possibly the most typical way to divide the US mainland into separate sub-regions, we opt to use the 7-region division which allow to better present the different territories.

The US divided in 7 Regions

New England

Mid-Atlantic

Southeast

Midwest

The Rocky Mountains

Southwest

Pacific Coastal

The United States Map divided by 7 Region

There is really no absolute right or wrong when it comes to dividing the United State Territory, and probably if you have already conducted some researches regarding the United States, you may have come across these names once or twice and found that they can be pretty much interchangeable.

As we go into exploring in a bit more detail these different regions, we will utilize the 7-region subdivision as it allows us to better dive the national parks and things to explore/do in each.

THE NEW ENGLAND

FOR: The Birth of a Nation

Brief Introduction:

The region of New England extends for almost 72,00 sq. mi. Possibly one of the oldest regions of the United States dating back to the 1620s with the arrival of the Pilgrims out of the coast of Cape Cod aboard the famous Mayflower. This is a region deep in culture and tradition, the bedrock of America Heritage, home to some of the most important cultural institutions & educational centers including a couple of Ivy-league Universities.

WHAT TO VISIT HERE

Largest Cities:

Boston (MA), Providence(RI), Portland (ME)

Towns worth stopping:

Provincetown (Capecod) the iconic village at the end of the peninsula, Hyannis (Capecod) because who doesn't love the Kennedys, Gloucester (MA) for its tradition in the Fishing Industry, Kennebunkport (ME) for its elegance and gorgeous Mansions, Bar Harbor (ME) as the "main gate" to the Acadia National Park, Stowe and Montpelier (VT) especially in the Fall and Winter for some snow wonderland.

National/State Park:

Acadia National Park found in Maine with its 47,000 acres of pines trees and birches that extend all the way to the water.

Cape Cod National Seashore Park with over 43,000 acres of shoreline along the coast of Cape Cod, a paradise for all beach, sand dune and pristine waters' lovers.

Mount Washington State Park found in New Hampshire. Love the mountains and drastic climate changes? Well, then this is the place for you.

Best Way to Visit the Region:

Leaving Boston aside for a moment, probably the easiest way to explore New England is by car. Although you have trains and domestic flights that connect the major cities in each State, this is an area that is meant to be explored as a road-trip or you won't be able to really witness the beauty of New England. We recommend at least 1 to 2 weeks to dedicate to the entire area. Starting from the southern area of New England which is the State of Connecticut and Cape Cod you can drive North along the coast visiting the most quaint villages on the Atlantic Shore and reach the Acadia National Park and then cut West to explore New Hampshire and Vermont.

Recommended for:

This region is definitely for the lovers of nature, long deserted sandy beaches, mountains, cliffs and pine trees that basically reach the ocean, and of course lobsters! Maine is the state that supplies 90% of fresh lobsters consumed annually in the United States. If you love mountains & cool temperatures landscapes but can't quite give up on the ocean and beaches, this is for you! A unique mix of the two.

Most dramatic time to visit:

Fall Foliage is one of the most sought after season. The entire region basically colors up in the hues of orange, red and yellow. Alternatively, late spring and summer are great seasons with warm days and cool nights. Possibly avoid Winter months, as snowfall can be heavy and driving around won't be as easy and fun.

The cities are also a great home-base for day-trips to visit the surrounding areas and parks.

Recommended for:

Those that love history and big-city vibes slightly mixed with some touches of Mother Nature. Especially if it's your first time visiting the US, you might want to start with cities such as NYC and Washington DC to get acquainted with both the American culture and history, plus they won't require you renting a car, driving around for long hours and extensive researches. You will have plenty of opportunities to visit the big cities and surrounding areas with daily excursions and activities.

Most Dramatic Time to Visit:

Mid-Spring during the Cherry Blossoms is an amazing time to visit the region especially for cities such as NYC and DC. Alternatively Fall, to experience some Foliage. The Holidays are always much-appreciated thanks to the Christmas decorations but be prepared for cold temperatures and snow.

THE SOUTH

Brief Introduction:

The South is known for its incredible hospitality & unique culture steeped in traditions. Throughout the centuries, this region has developed some very particular customs when it comes to foods, sports, music, religions, etc. to make it a very particular and self-contained region different from anywhere else in the United States. This is where we can discover and learn about the plantations' economy, as well as facts regarding the civil war, the confederate states, segregation and the consequential fight for civil rights.

Hot Springs National Parks (AR) taking the name for the neighboring city of Hot Springs and famous for its bathing waters.

Best Way to Visit the Region:

The South is pretty spread-out so you might find that a flight & drive combination will work best to explore the most of this territory. Unless you have over 3+ weeks at your disposal, we don't recommend simply driving all around. It's best if you select 3 major cities where you can easily fly in & out and then rent cars to explore the region.

Recommended for:

For those that want to explore the South with its culture and traditions. If you have watched at least once "Gone with the Wind" and fell in love with the scenery, if Country Music is your jam, if you want to try some real BBQ, if you hear sweet tea and your eyes light up, this region is for you.

Most Dramatic Time to Visit:

The weather and the scenery are definitely more appealing during the mid-seasons Spring and Fall. Winters are not too cold but the scenery is not as nice. Avoid July and August as they are the worst months for both humidity and heavy rainfall.

THE MIDWEST

FOR: Lakeshore Towns, Frontier Villages & The Wild Wild West

The region is known for its vast prairie land, buffalo roaming the country, small-town vibes and laid-back life. In this region, you can learn the history of the Frontier Life West of the Mississippi. If you are interested in lakeshore villages especially to spend a couple of summer days, you will love the Great Lake Region especially along Michigan's and Wisconsin's lakeshores. Here you will have plenty of towns and lakeside resorts with historic main streets, art galleries, and boutiques.

One of the oldest National Parks in the US with extensive prairie land and local animals. (Please note that due to Elevator repairs there are no tours in the caves as of October 2019)

Best Way to visit the Region:

Definitely rent a car and go! You might want to divide the area into sub-regions and take advantage of domestic flights to connect to major hubs and then drive around each area. You could theoretically divide your trip to the Midwest into 2 parts. One part will be the Great Lake region towards the North-East and the second part will more towards the West with the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas, this is where the land gets more prairie-like, the towns get more "wild wild west", and the landscape, in general, gets a bit drier.

Recommended for:

Lovers of the Frontier History and the Wild Wild West. This region will give you just the right mix of small-town vibes, cowboy life, ranches and cattle farms, prairies, as well as lakeside villages famous for their art-galleries and food & wines offerings. This is definitely a region that can entice different tastes and needs.

Most dramatic time to visit:

Bozeman (Montana) which is a great town to visit on your way to Yellowstone and West Glacier National Park(Montana).

You need to be willing to drive, and a lot! This is a great region to explore by car or camper. You could probably save some time factoring in some domestic flights here and there, but if you want to explore most of the area, be ready for long drives.

Recommended for:

The South-West is often, and wrongly, described as flat arid open land that won't offer much dynamic and variation. Although this couldn't be farthest from the truth. Yes, the region is indeed quite vast, but it does offer much diversity. Driving through this region you can admire the different landscapes that the territory offers from mountain ranges to dessert & canyons. Here you can explore some of the oldest archeological sites left in the United States as well as Native American villages rich in cultural traditions, i.e. the pueblos. We highly recommend a visit to the Zuni and Acoma Pueblos, as well as the iconic Taos Pueblo located near the town of Taos (NM). If you want to learn more about the Native America tradition, history and culture, this is the area that you don't want to miss! Last tip -- make sure to taste some of the delicious Tex-Mex cuisines while you are down there.

Most dramatic time to visit:

As per many other states /regions, the mid-seasons are usually the most recommended time to travel so you can take advantage of mild temperatures and sunny days. Summer int the South-West can be brutal with temperatures that often go well above 100F although the region is known for its dry climate which helps a bit, still, we do not recommend visiting this area in August! Winters are a bit unpredictable, it could snow (or not) and temperatures vary greatly from day to night.
