        "text": "The 50 states of the USA\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nThe Capital District is found in almost every list of states, but is not itself a state. Washington, D.C. has been the official capital of the United States of America since 1801. It is home to the world-famous Capitol and White House buildings. The Pentagon is also a government facility, but it is located in neighboring Arlington, Virginia.\n\nThe abbreviation \"D.C.\" stands for the District of Columbia.\n\nThe District is about 177 square kilometers (458 sq mi) in size and has about 700,000 residents in the area of the city proper. The entire metropolitan area almost reaches the borders of Baltimore and has over 6 million people. Often Washington D.C. is confused with the state of Washington, which is located on the west coast.\n\nTerritories of the USA\n\nIn addition to the Capital District and the 50 states, the United States has other territories, but they are not connected to the U.S. mainland. These include, for example, Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. Their inhabitants are officially also citizens of the United States, but they are not states. These territories, despite having a common president, have internal autonomy with their own government, which is quite different from the states.\n\nIn addition, there are so-called \"free associated states\" that are even more clearly detached from the United States. These are the Marshall Islands, Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia. They are considered independent under international law, but are closely tied to the U.S. economically and militarily. A similar construct can be found with the Vatican in Europe, for which Italy also assumes several tasks.\n\nOf these territories, Puerto Rico is currently the only one that is not self-governing. While Puerto Ricans are already citizens of the U.S., they are not eligible to vote. Puerto Rico decided in a 2012 referendum by a narrow majority (54%) to become the next state. Previous referendums in 1967, 1993 and 1998 had each failed. However, it has not been determined if and when it will be admitted. One point of contention is always that Puerto Rico, as a Spanish-speaking territory, would not fit into the English-speaking USA.\n\nHistory of the States\n\nIn 1776, the year of its founding, the United States consisted of only 13 colonies that formed a union with a common constitution. All 13 were located on the East Coast and extended barely 500 kilometers (310 miles) inland. In the course of the following almost 200 years, the national territory expanded further and further. It was not until 1850 that California, the first state on the Pacific coast, was added. The most recent additions are Alaska and Hawaii, both of which joined the confederation in 1959.\n\nIndependence of the USA\n\nContrary to what is mostly known, the U.S. was, by the way, quite dependent - although not on a single country. The Declaration of Independence of 1776 not only formed a union of independent states, but was above all a breakaway from the British Crown. Florida also belonged to Spain until 1819. Texas was Mexican territory until 1836. Alaska was bought from Russia in 1867."
