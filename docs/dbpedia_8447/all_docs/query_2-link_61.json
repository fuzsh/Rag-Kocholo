        "text": "You will be considered a United States resident for tax purposes if you meet the substantial presence test for the calendar year. To meet this test, you must be physically present in the United States (U.S.) on at least:\n\n31 days during the current year, and\n\n183 days during the 3-year period that includes the current year and the 2 years immediately before that, counting:\n\nAll the days you were present in the current year, and\n\n1/3 of the days you were present in the first year before the current year, and\n\n1/6 of the days you were present in the second year before the current year.\n\nExample:\n\nYou were physically present in the U.S. on 120 days in each of the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. To determine if you meet the substantial presence test for 2023, count the full 120 days of presence in 2023, 40 days in 2022 (1/3 of 120), and 20 days in 2021 (1/6 of 120). Since the total for the 3-year period is 180 days, you are not considered a resident under the substantial presence test for 2023.\n\nDays of Presence in the United States\n\nYou are treated as present in the U.S. on any day you are physically present in the country, at any time during the day. However, there are exceptions to this rule. Do not count the following as days of presence in the U.S. for the substantial presence test:\n\nDays you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you regularly commute from Canada or Mexico.\n\nDays you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours, when you are in transit between two places outside the United States.\n\nDays you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vessel.\n\nDays you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are in the United States.\n\nDays you are an exempt individual (see below).\n\nFor details on days excluded from the substantial presence test for other than exempt individuals, refer to Publication 519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.\n\nThe term United States (U.S.) includes the following areas:\n\nAll 50 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nThe territorial waters of the United States.\n\nThe seabed and subsoil of those submarine areas that are adjacent to U.S. territorial waters and over which the United States has exclusive rights under international law to explore and exploit natural resources.\n\nThe term does not include U.S. territories or U.S. airspace.\n\nExempt Individual\n\nDo not count days for which you are an exempt individual. The term \"exempt individual\" does not refer to someone exempt from U.S. tax, but to anyone in the following categories:\n\nAn individual temporarily present in the U.S. as a foreign government-related individual under an “A” or “G” visa, other than individuals holding “A-3” or “G-5” class visas.\n\nA teacher or trainee temporarily present in the U.S. under a \"J\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa.\n\nA student temporarily present in the U.S. under an \"F,\" \"J,\" \"M,\" or \"Q\" visa, who substantially complies with the requirements of the visa.\n\nA professional athlete temporarily in the U.S. to compete in a charitable sports event.\n\nIf you exclude days of presence in the U.S. for purposes of the substantial presence test because you were an exempt individual or were unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition or medical problem, you must include Form 8843, Statement for Exempt Individuals and Individuals With a Medical Condition, with your income tax return. If you do not have to file an income tax return, send Form 8843 to the address indicated in the instructions for Form 8843 by the due date for filing an income tax return.\n\nIf you do not timely file Form 8843, you cannot exclude the days you were present in the U.S. as an exempt individual or because of a medical condition that arose while you were in the U.S. This does not apply if you can show, by clear and convincing evidence that you took reasonable actions to become aware of the filing requirements and significant steps to comply with those requirements.\n\nCloser Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test\n\nEven if you met the substantial presence test you can still be treated as a nonresident of the United States for U.S. tax purposes if you qualify for one of the following exceptions:\n\nThe closer connection exception. Please refer to Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test .\n\nThe closer connection exception available only to students. Please refer to The Closer Connection Exception to the Substantial Presence Test for Foreign Students.\n\nReferences/Related Topics"
