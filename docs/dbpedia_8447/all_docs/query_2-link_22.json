Both within countries and across the world as a whole?\n\nOn this page, you can find all our data, visualizations, and writing relating to economic inequality.\n\nThis evidence shows us that inequality in many countries is very high and, in many cases, has been on the rise. Global economic inequality is vast and compounded by overlapping inequalities in health, education, and many other dimensions.\n\nBut economic inequality is not rising everywhere. Within many countries, it has fallen or remained stable. And global inequality – after two centuries of increase – is now falling too.\n\nThe large differences we see across countries and over time are crucial. They show us that high and rising inequality is not inevitable, and that the extent of inequality today is something that we can change.\n\nReuse this work freely\n\nAll visualizations, data, and code produced by Our World in Data are completely open access under the Creative Commons BY license.
