        "text": "In the U.S., 127 million people live in coastal counties. Thatâ€™s as much as the entire population of Japan. If they were their own nation, the coastal counties of the U.S. would rank third in the world in gross domestic product, beaten only by China and the U.S. as a whole. The outsize U.S. marine economy is fueled by tourism and recreation, offshore energy, shipbuilding, and aquaculture, to name just a few.\n\nThough home to almost 40% of the U.S. population, coastal areas account for less than 10% of the total land in the contiguous United States. Coastal areas are also far more crowded than the U.S. as a whole; population density is over five times greater in coastal shoreline counties than the U.S. average. This means that issues that affect the coasts affect a large proportion of Americans."
