        "text": "Last updated: 11/5/2021\n\nHistorian Harry Ritter once wrote that Alaska is “like nowhere else—wild, extreme and amazing.”\n\nThat being said, when you’re considering a move to Alaska, you might want to know a bit more about what you’re getting into. Or, if you’re exiting Alaska for the Lower 48, you might want to understand what you’re leaving behind. To give you a better sense of how Alaska sizes up to the rest of the United States (and the world!), we’ve put together a few comparisons. Taken together, they’ll give you a new perspective on how life in the Land of the Midnight Sun stacks up.\n\nSo, How Big Is Alaska?\n\nAlaska measures 665,384 square miles. This makes it, by far, the largest state. Below, take a look at how it compares to the other top contenders. Plus, to give you a better sense of what life in Alaska is like, we also included some figures on population and population density, which will reveal just how much space is waiting for you in Alaska.\n\nLargest States by Total Area:\n\nImagine a square parcel of land that measures a mile on each side. Visualize 1.3 people in it—or even two people—and then think about what that same piece of land would look like with 10,859 people in it.\n\nThat visual will give you a feel for just how much land Alaska has to offer—and how few people occupy it. That being said, people in Alaska obviously aren’t spread out evenly. Instead, many can be found in Alaska’s cities and towns.\n\nHow Big Are Alaska’s Biggest Cities?\n\nSome people move to Alaska for the off-the-grid lifestyle. Others simply want to enjoy quiet, open acreage with few other people around. For those who crave company, there’s Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage, with a population of288,970.xiv\n\nIf you’ve never lived in a city that size, know that it’s the 68th largest city in the United States. It’s just a little smaller, population-wise, than Cincinnati, Ohio and just a little larger than St. Louis, Missouri.\n\nIf Anchorage sounds too crowded, you might want to choose a different spot in Alaska, such as the next-largest city, Fairbanks. Its population of 30,917xv makes it the 1,002nd–largest city in the U.S.\n\nTo put it into perspective, Fairbanks shares a similar population with these three U.S. cities:\n\nManassas, VA (35,205)\n\nLewiston, ME (35,131)\n\nSan Juan Capistrano, CA (34,793)\n\nNow when you’re choosing where you want to live in Alaska, you might also want to consider how difficult or easy it will be to get yourself home.\n\nWhat About Roadways in Alaska?\n\nYou might have heard that Alaskans like to get creative with getting around: planes, ferry boats, snow machines (you might know them as snowmobiles), and even dog sleds are common forms of transportation in the Frontier State.\n\nThis is probably partially due to the Alaskan “can do” attitude—and the fact that there are only 14,336 miles of public roads in Alaska, which puts it well behind the other largest states, as you can see in this chart:\n\nMiles of Public Roads:\n\nAlaska: 14,336\n\nTexas: 679,917\n\nCalifornia: 394,383\n\nMontana: 150,257\n\nNew Mexico: 161,015\n\nDelaware: 14,069 xvi\n\n(You’ll notice that, in terms of mileage of public roads, Alaska has around as many as the state of Delaware, the second-smallest state in the U.S.!) That being said, you’ll want to master the state’s various modes of transportation because there are plenty of extraordinary sites to see.\n\nWhat Makes Alaska So Different from Other States?\n\nA lot of things—and the answer will be different, depending on who you ask. This list of the top ninereasons to move to Alaska is a great start. In addition, we’d like to highlight two features of Alaska that make it stand out from the rest of the country. Alaska is home to twelve of the thirteen highest mountain peaks in the United States, including the highest, Denali (formerly known as Mt. McKinley):\n\nHighest Major Summits in the United States\n\nDenali: 20,310 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Saint Elias: 18,009 ft. (AK & Canada’s Yukon)\n\nMount Foraker: 17,400 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Bona: 16,550 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Blackburn: 16,390 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Sanford: 16,237 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Fairweather: 15,325 ft. (AK & British Columbia)\n\nMount Hubbard: 14,951 ft. (AK & Canada’s Yukon)\n\nMount Bear: 14,831 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Hunter: 14,573 ft. (AK)\n\nMount Whitney: 14,505 ft. (California)\n\nMount Alverstone: 14,500 ft. (AK & Canada’s Yukon)\n\nUniversity Peak: 14,470 ft. (AK)xvii\n\nIn addition to breathtaking mountain peaks, Alaska also hosts the second-most national parks in the United States. The top spot goes to California, which has nine parks. Alaska is right behind with eight.\n\nThat being said, if you’re measuring by acreage, Alaska wins, hands-down. The state has devoted 32,526,051 acres to National Park Land, while California only has 6,313,164. Additionally, you’ll find the largest National Park in Alaska: the 8.3 million-acre Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve.\n\nTo sum it up, you won’t find a lot of big cities, people, or roadways in Alaska, but you will find plentiful land that’s just waiting to be explored in Alaska’s five regions.\n\nDiscover the 5 Distinct Regions of Alaska\n\nAs you explore Alaska’s five regions, you’ll discover that life can be radically different in each. Your experience in Juneau in the rainy Southeastern region will stand in dramatic contrast to life in urban Anchorage in Southcentral Alaska. For a full review of each area, check out our blog “The Best Places to Live in Alaska”\n\nTo give you a better sense of what each region is like, here’s a quick run-down of all five:\n\nSouthcentral Alaska – Plenty of roads and access to Alaska’s largest city, Anchorage, make this one of the most convenient places to live in Alaska. Plus, there’s plenty of Alaska’s natural beauty to enjoy in the area, including the sights within Kenai Fjords National Park, Wrangell-St. Elias National Park, and the Chugach National Forest. If it’s a popularity contest, Southcentral Alaska wins far and away: 40% of Alaska’s population lives in Anchorage and 54% live in the broader Anchorage/Mat-Su Economic Region.xviii\n\nSoutheast Alaska – Also known as the Inside Passage, the terrain in Southeast Alaska is largely made up of islands and mountains. And while you’ll enjoy milder winters (relatively; this is still Alaska, after all), this stunning region gets wet weather nearly year-round.You’ll find very few roads in the area, so transportation is largely via boat and airplane.\n\nSouthwest Alaska – Much of the population in Southwest Alaska is concentrated in the Kodiak Island Borough. Additionally, you’ll find a significant Native population in the area. 27% of residents identify as American Indian or Alaska Native,xix and the Yup’ik and Aleut communities have a significant presence in Southwest Alaska.The region is not connected by roads, so living in this area means navigating by airplane and boat.\n\nInterior Alaska – Fairbanks is one of the big hubs in this region, which is also home to the University of Alaska Fairbanks. There’s also a significant military populationin the interior, with personnel stationed at Clear Air Force Station Base in Denali Borough, Fort Wainwright or Fort Greely Army Bases in Fairbanks, or Eielson Air Force Base in North Pole.\n\nFar North Alaska – The television show Ice Road Truckers made the highway that traverses this region famous. Extreme weather and extreme darkness in the heart of winter make this a challenging place to live, although the Inupiat people still live in more than 30 villages in the region.\n\nFor more details, check out our article on the best places to live in Alaska’s five regions.\n\nGetting a Clearer Picture of the Frontier State\n\nNow that we’ve taken you on a tour of some of the more prominent features of the Frontier State—and how they compare to those of the other United States—you might have a better sense of what makes Alaska so unique. Whether that inspires you to head for the Land of the Midnight Sun, pack up for the Lower 48 or stay right where you are—well, that’s up to you.\n\nHowever, if you’re moving to, from or around Alaska, we’d be happy to help.
