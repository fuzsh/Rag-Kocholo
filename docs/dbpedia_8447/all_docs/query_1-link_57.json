So, it comes as no surprise that they have very different population estimates. With growth in the form of natural births and inward migration (both domestic and foreign), and declines from deaths and outward migration, state populations are in a constant state of flux. As of July 2022, the population of the United States is estimated to have crossed 333 million.\n\nThe United States Census Bureau’s population statistics encompass the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the five US territories, including Puerto Rico. The official Census takes into account the total number of people residing in the US, including citizens, permanent residents, and long-term visitors. Federal employees serving abroad, both civilian and military, as well as their dependents, are counted in their home state.\n\nThis population of the United States is unevenly distributed across all states and territories. The most populated states are California, Texas, and Florida, while the states with the least population are Vermont and Wyoming.\n\nThe table below lists all US states ranked by population, from most populated to least populated.\n\nStates by PopulationRankStatePopulation in 2022Population in 2021Population in 2020All United States333,287,557331,893,745331,449,2811California39,029,34239,237,83639,538,2232Texas30,029,57229,527,94129,145,5053Florida22,244,82321,781,12821,538,1874New York19,677,15119,835,91320,201,2495Pennsylvania12,972,00812,964,05612,812,5086Illinois12,582,03212,671,46912,702,3797Ohio11,756,05811,780,01711,799,4488Georgia10,912,87610,799,56610,711,9089North Carolina10,698,97310,551,16210,439,38810Michigan10,034,11310,050,81110,077,33111New Jersey9,261,6999,267,1309,288,99412Virginia8,683,6198,642,2748,631,39313Washington7,785,7867,738,6927,705,28114Arizona7,359,1977,276,3167,151,50215Tennessee7,051,3396,975,2186,910,84016Massachusetts6,981,9746,984,7237,029,91717Indiana6,833,0376,805,9856,785,52818Missouri6,177,9576,168,1876,154,91319Maryland6,164,6606,165,1296,177,22420Wisconsin5,892,5395,895,9085,893,71821Colorado5,839,9265,812,0695,773,71422Minnesota5,717,1845,707,3905,706,49423South Carolina5,282,6345,190,7055,118,42524Alabama5,074,2965,039,8775,024,27925Louisiana4,590,2414,624,0474,657,75726Kentucky4,512,3104,509,3944,505,83627Oregon4,240,1374,246,1554,237,25628Oklahoma4,019,8003,986,6393,959,35329Connecticut3,626,2053,605,5973,605,94430Utah3,380,8003,337,9753,271,61631Iowa3,200,5173,193,0793,190,36932Nevada3,177,7723,143,9913,104,61433Arkansas3,045,6373,025,8913,011,52434Mississippi2,940,0572,949,9682,961,27935Kansas2,937,1502,934,5822,937,88036New Mexico2,113,3442,115,8772,117,52237Nebraska1,967,9231,963,6921,961,50438Idaho1,939,0331,900,9231,839,10639West Virginia1,775,1561,782,9591,793,71640Hawaii1,440,1961,441,5531,455,27141New Hampshire1,395,2311,388,9921,377,52942Maine1,385,3401,372,2471,362,35943Montana1,122,8671,104,2711,084,22544Rhode Island1,093,7341,095,6101,097,37945Delaware1,018,3961,003,384 989,94846South Dakota909,824895,376886,66747North Dakota779,261774,948779,09448Alaska733,583732,673733,39149Washington, D.C.671,803670,050689,54550Vermont647,064645,570643,07751Wyoming581,381578,803576,851\n\nThe United States is the third largest country in the world by area and ranks just behind Russia and Canada. All 50 states in the US vary drastically in area. The largest state is Alaska, which is more than 400 times larger than Rhode Island, the smallest state. In the US, a large area does not mean a large population. Texas, for example, is bigger than California, but the latter is more populous.\n\nWhen it comes to size comparison, Alaska is staggeringly big; bigger than the next three largest states (Texas, California and Montana) combined, and twice the size of the second largest state, Texas. The smallest state – Rhode Island – could fit into Alaska nearly 486 times. And if Washington DC were a state, it would be the smallest.\n\nThe 10 largest states by area are Alaska, Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, Colorado, Oregon and Wyoming. They are located west of the Mississippi River. The 7 smallest states – Massachusetts, Vermont, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Connecticut, Delaware, and Rhode Island – are among the 13 original colonies and are located in the northeast part of the country.\n\nThe table below lists all US states plus Washington, D.C. ranked by size, from biggest to smallest.\n\nStates by Size (Total Area)RankStateSize\n\n(land & water)\n\n(square miles)All United States3,796,742.231Alaska665,384.042Texas268,596.463California163,694.744Montana147,039.715New Mexico121,590.306Arizona113,990.307Nevada110,571.828Colorado104,093.679Oregon98,378.5410Wyoming97,813.0111Michigan96,713.5112Minnesota86,935.8313Utah84,896.8814Idaho83,568.9515Kansas82,278.3616Nebraska77,347.8117South Dakota77,115.6818Washington71,297.9519North Dakota70,698.3220Oklahoma69,898.8721Missouri69,706.9922Florida65,757.7023Wisconsin65,496.3824Georgia59,425.1525Illinois57,913.5526Iowa56,272.8127New York54,554.9828North Carolina53,819.1629Arkansas53,178.5530Alabama52,420.0731Louisiana52,378.1332Mississippi48,431.7833Pennsylvania46,054.3434Ohio44,825.5835Virginia42,774.9336Tennessee42,144.2537Kentucky40,407.8038Indiana36,419.5539Maine35,379.7440South Carolina32,020.4941West Virginia24,230.0442Maryland12,405.9343Hawaii10,931.7244Massachusetts10,554.3945Vermont9,616.3646New Hampshire9,349.1647New Jersey8,722.5848Connecticut5,543.4149Delaware2,488.7250Rhode Island1,544.8951Washington, D.

C.7.29\n\nBack to Top\n\nUS States by Population Density\n\nThe population density of an area is the average measure of the number of people that occupy one square unit of that area. It is calculated for each state by dividing the population of that state by its land area.\n\nAs stated before, the size of a state is not necessarily an indicator of the size of its population. Alaska, which is the largest state, has among the lowest state populations in the country. This makes it the least densely populated in the country. New Jersey, on the other hand, is the 46th smallest state by land size, but it also ranks 11th by population. Thus, the small size and large population makes New Jersey the most densely populated state. (Though it has been included in the table below, the capital city Washington D.C. is not a state. If it was a state, it would replace New Jersey as the most densely populated.)\n\nThe table ranks states in order of their population density in 2022, from highest to lowest.\n\nStates by Population Density\n\n(number of people\n\nper square mile of land area)RankStatePopulation DensityAll United States94.361Washington, D.

Factors contributing to this are decreased fertility and international migration. The July 2021 population estimates released by the US Census Bureau displayed a growth of 0.1% from 2020 to 2021, which is the lowest ever recorded in the country. The drastic drop is widely attributed to the Covid-19 pandemic, which broke out in 2020 and led to increased deaths and lockdowns which further stemmed international migration.\n\nDomestic migration continues to cause growth in certain regions, such as the South, more than in other areas. Highly urban regions, such as areas along the East and West coasts, have witnessed significant decline due to outward domestic migration.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nWhat is the largest state in the US?\n\nThe largest state in the US is Alaska. It spans a total of 665,384.04 square miles. Of these, 570,640.95 square miles are land, while 94,743 square miles are water.\n\nWhat is the smallest state in the US?\n\nThe smallest state in the US is Rhode Island, with a total of 1,544.89 square miles.\n\nWhat is the most populated state in the US?\n\nThe most populated state in the US is California. As of 2022, it has a population above 39,000,000. However, California has been witnessing a gradual decline in population as the current figure is a drop compared to 2020, when it had been approximately 39,538,223.\n\nWhat is the least populated state in the US?\n\nThe state that has the lowest population in the US is Wyoming. As of 2022, it has a population of about 581,000.\n\nIs Canada bigger than the US?\n\nOverall, Canada is bigger than the US. It has a total area of about 3,855,100 square miles compared to the US’s 3,796,742 square miles. However, Canada’s land mass is slightly smaller than that of the US. On the other hand, about 9% of the country’s total area is water. Thus, its total area is larger than that of the US."
