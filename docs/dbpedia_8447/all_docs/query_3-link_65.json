        "text": "From the Amazon rainforests to Siberia’s plains or the Australian bush, sparsely populated regions share demographic, economic, political and environmental characteristics that set them apart from more densely populated areas.\n\nAs such, a second residence in a sparsely populated country offers many people the freedom they seek to discover a better lifestyle, investment and travel opportunities.\n\nOften, in such frontier markets, it’s possible to find not just plenty of space but also peace of mind. In short, these places can offer people the kind of freedom that’s just not available in their own countries. Countries with lower population density tend to exert far less interference in business, social liberties and taxes.\n\nSo, if you think your home country’s government has too much power over you or is taking too much of an interest in how you live your life, then maybe now is the perfect time to hatch an escape plan and go where you’re treated best.\n\nReach out to us at Nomad Capitalist, and we can help you organise your residence, tax reduction and asset protection needs.\n\nThat’s what we do – help wealthy investors set up companies, secure residency permits or second passports all around the world, all with the same aim of providing financial freedom and ease of mind.\n\nWith that in mind, here’s our list of 13 countries with the lowest population density where you can implement the perfect Plan B.\n\nCountries With the Lowest Population Density\n\n13. Mauritania\n\nMauritania is an African country with an Atlantic coastline. It has an area of 1 million square kilometres and 4.9 million residents, giving it a population density of five people per square kilometre (12 people per square mile).\n\nMauritania markets itself as ‘the new investment frontier’. Business registration takes between one and two days to complete, there is no minimum capital requirement and given that Mauritania is situated at the crossroads between Africa and Europe, there’s the potential to tap into a huge market. The most competitive Mauritian business sectors are mining, livestock and renewable energies.\n\n12. Canada\n\nCanada is the second largest country in the world after Russia. It occupies roughly two-fifths of the North American continent, a total of 10 million square kilometres.\n\nGiven Canada’s massive size, it is understandably one of the world’s least populated countries, with a surprisingly low population of 38.8 million.\n\nAs the largest country in North America, it’s no surprise that Canada has embraced remote work with an increasing number of coworking spaces to satisfy the demands of workers.\n\n11. Guyana\n\nGuyana has a population density of four people per square kilometre (10 people per square mile).\n\nGuyana is situated in the northeastern corner of South America. To the north, it borders the Atlantic Ocean. It also shares a border with Suriname, Brazil and Venezuela. Around 814 thousand people there inhabit 215,000 square kilometres.\n\nWe rate it among the best countries to live in, incorporate and be a citizen of. Guyana is also one of the few English-speaking countries in South America. The International Monetary Fund highlighted Guyana as one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with oil revenues predicted to contribute 40% by 2024.\n\n10. Suriname\n\nNearby Suriname also has a population density of four people per square kilometre (10 people per square mile).\n\nSuriname is one of the smallest countries in South America. It is located on the continent’s north coast. Just over 623,000 Surinamese live in an area approaching 165,000 square km.\n\nWhile the Surinamese economy has been in decline for some time, the discovery of oil in its waters has improved things. The CEO of the state-owned oil company, Staatsolie, forecast that the country’s government could amass US$10-US$15 billion over 20 years if production matches neighbouring Guyana.\n\n9. Libya\n\nLibya is situated in North Africa, and most of the territory lies in the Sahara Desert. It has many borders, including Egypt, Sudan, Chad, Niger, Algeria and Tunisia. Nearly 7 million Libyan citizens reside in 1.8 million square km.\n\nThe country has vast energy resources. However, its true potential is hampered by endemic corruption and political instability.\n\n8. French Guiana\n\nAs its name suggests, French Guiana is an overseas territory of France. Roughly 312,000 people live in a country of 83,500 square km, approximately the size of Portugal.\n\nThe Amazon rainforest covers 96% of the land. Cayenne is the capital city. The country is on a positive trajectory with a developing aerospace industry and a growing number of tourists. The total population is set to reach 500,000 by 2040, contributing to its fast-developing economy.\n\n7. Iceland\n\nIceland is a North Atlantic island whose closest neighbour is Greenland, 320 km or 200 miles away. The country’s near-375,000 population lives in 103,000 square km.\n\nOne of several European countries to offer digital nomad visas, the Icelandic version allows you to live in the jurisdiction for six months. The country is committed to welcoming startups, and the Icelandic energy grid sources 99% of its power from renewable sources. Iceland is also one of the safest countries to live in in 2023.\n\n6. Australia\n\nAustralia is both the smallest continent and one of the largest countries by area in the world. It’s sandwiched between the Indian and Pacific oceans and has an estimated population of 26.4 million inhabitants living across 7.7 million square km.\n\nIn welcoming foreign direct investment, Australia offers incentives across a range of priority industries, including food and beverage manufacturing, medical products, clean energy, defence, space and critical minerals processing.\n\nAn investor visa allows you to stay in the country indefinitely, but high taxes could deter you from obtaining permanent residence there. However, you might be better off working there in one of our recommended coworking spaces as a digital nomad.\n\n5. Namibia\n\nNamibia, on the southwestern coast of Africa, is 825,600 km in size, with a population of around 2.6 million.\n\nWalvis Bay is an elite port connecting the broader Southern Africa Development Community with the rest of the world. The country is generally well-connected and, according to the World Economic Forum, has the best roads on the African continent. You can also draw on an educated, skilled and young workforce.\n\n4. Mongolia\n\nMongolia in north-central Asia has a population density of two people per square kilometre (six people per square mile).\n\nLandlocked by Russia to the north and China to the south, the country measures 1.6 million square km and has around 3.4 million citizens.\n\nAs a preferred trading partner of China, Mongolia’s economy has accelerated in recent years. It provides investors with preferential market access via two trade agreements with eight countries and nearly 3 billion consumers. In economic terms, Mongolia remains one to watch.\n\n3. Western Sahara\n\nWestern Sahara is located in the Sahara Desert and is sparsely populated, with approximately 266,000 square kilometres and only 587,000 residents.\n\nHowever, there are better countries to invest in in Africa because Western Sahara is a disputed territory that Morrocco lays claim to, causing some instability.\n\n2. The Falkland Islands\n\nThe Falkland Islands has a population density of 0.31 people per square kilometre (one person per square mile).\n\nThe Falklands, a British Overseas Territory in the South Atlantic Ocean, is situated about 480 km (300 miles) northeast of the southern tip of South America. It is one of the least densely populated places, with close to 3,800 people living in around 12,000 square km, although the population swells when cruise ships bound for Antarctica stop there.\n\nThe Falklands has been a British territory since 1833 and was the subject of a war with Argentina in 1982 over its ownership.\n\n1. Greenland\n\nGreenland has a population density of 0.14 people per square kilometre (0.36 people per square mile) and is the least densely populated country in the world. Just under 57,000 people live in a 2.2 million square kilometre space. Greenland, in the North Atlantic Ocean, is the world’s largest island and is part of the Kingdom of Denmark.\n\nIts Atlantic coast is home to more fjords and glaciers than human inhabitants. Humpback whales, musk oxen, narwhals and polar bears also outnumber people. The island is keen to promote tourism and there are also investment opportunities in energy, seafood and water.\n\nGo Where You’re Treated Best\n\nEven the least populated territory can offer the potential for investment and lifestyle benefits if it makes sense for you and you know where to look. By changing your mindset and tapping into the potential of frontier markets, you could discover a world of possibilities."
