        "text": "Climate Change in the American Mind Survey Question Wording\n\nModel estimates in the maps were derived from public responses to the following survey questions. The response categories for many questions were collapsed into a single variable for mapping. For example, for the question measuring how worried respondents are about global warming, “very worried” and “somewhat worried” were combined into a single measure of “worried.” Likewise “Not very worried” and “Not at all worried” were combined into a single measure of “not worried.” The responses below are color coded to indicate how they were grouped into the variables shown on the maps. Individuals who responded “Don’t know” or who did not answer the question were not modeled separately and appear as gray segments within the bar charts.\n\nBELIEFS\n\nGlobal warming is happening\n\nRecently, you may have noticed that global warming has been getting some attention in the news.
