Many people call this part of the country the Rust Belt because of its ties to the automotive industry. Wisconsin is approximately 65,000 square miles. This means that it is larger than Illinois but smaller than Minnesota.\n\nDoes Wisconsin Border Canada?\n\nTechnically, Wisconsin shares a border with Canada, but it is difficult to get to the Canadian border from Wisconsin by land. If you would like to cross into Canada from Wisconsin, you would have to cross over the water. Or, you can cross into Canada by going through Minnesota, which borders Wisconsin to the West. You can also cross into Canada by going through Michigan, which borders Wisconsin to the east.\n\nWhat Is Wisconsin Known For?\n\nWisconsin is known for a lot of things. For example, Wisconsin is known for its dedication to cheese. That is why its professional football team, the Green Bay Packers, are known as the cheeseheads. In addition, Wisconsin is known for its bountiful farmland. Wisconsin is one of the most popular places in the country for farming ginseng. Wisconsin is known for its rolling plains, its beautiful hills, and its friendly people. Because of its farmland, Wisconsin is considered to be a part of the breadbasket of the United States."
