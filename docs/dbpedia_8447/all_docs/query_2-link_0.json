        "text": "Key Points | Background | About the Indicator | About the Data | Technical Documentation\n\nKey Points\n\nSince 1983, the National Interagency Fire Center has documented an average of approximately 70,000 wildfires per year (Figure 1). Compiled data from the Forest Service suggest that the actual total may be even higher for the first few years of nationwide data collection that can be compared. The data do not show an obvious trend during this time.\n\nThe extent of area burned by wildfires each year appears to have increased since the 1980s. According to National Interagency Fire Center data, of the 10 years with the largest acreage burned, all have occurred since 2004, including the peak years in 2015 and 2020 (Figure 2). This period coincides with many of the warmest years on record nationwide (see the U.S. and Global Temperature indicator). The largest increases have occurred during the spring and summer months (Figure 6).\n\nThe late 1990s were a period of transition in certain climate cycles that tend to shift every few decades.15 This shift—combined with other ongoing changes in temperature, drought, and snowmelt—may have contributed to warmer, drier conditions that have fueled wildfires in parts of the western United States.3,16\n\nOf the total area burned each year from 1984 to 2021, the proportion of burned land suffering severe damage has ranged from 5 to 22 percent (see the \"high\" category in Figure 3).\n\nLand area burned by wildfires varies by state. Fires burn more land in the western United States than in the East, and parts of the West and Southwest show the largest increase in burned acreage between the first half of the period of record in Figures 4 and 5 (1984–2002) and the second half (2003–2021) (Figure 5). Burned acreage in the West has increased noticeably in nearly every month of the year (Figure 7).\n\nThe peak of the U.S. wildfire season is occurring earlier (Figure 6). In 1984–2002, burned area peaked in August. More recently, it has peaked in July. An average of 1.8 million acres burned in July of each year from 2003 to 2021.\n\nBackground\n\nTogether, forests, shrubland, and grassland cover more than half of the land area in the United States.1 These ecosystems are important resources, both environmentally and economically. Although wildfires occur naturally and play a long-term role in the health of these ecosystems, changing wildfire patterns threaten to upset the status quo. Multiple studies have found that climate change has already led to an increase in wildfire season length, wildfire frequency, and burned area.2,3 The wildfire season has lengthened in many areas due to factors including warmer springs, longer summer dry seasons, and drier soils and vegetation.2 Similarly, climate change threatens to increase the frequency, extent, and severity of fires through increased temperatures and drought (see the U.S. and Global Temperature and Drought indicators).2 Earlier spring melting and reduced snowpack (see the Snowpack indicator) result in decreased water availability during hot summer conditions, which in turn contributes to an increased wildfire risk, allowing fires to start more easily and burn hotter. These trends of longer wildfire seasons and larger wildfire size are predicted to continue as more frequent and longer droughts occur.2 In addition to climate change, other factors—land use, large-scale insect infestation, fuel availability (including invasive species such as highly flammable cheatgrass), and management practices, including fire suppression—play an important role in wildfire frequency and intensity. All of these factors influencing wildfires vary greatly by region and over time, as do precipitation, wind, temperature, vegetation types, and landscape conditions. Therefore, understanding changes in fire characteristics requires long-term records, a regional perspective, and consideration of many factors.4\n\nWildfires have the potential to harm property, livelihoods, and human health. Fire-related threats are increasing, especially as more people live in and near forests, grasslands, and other natural areas.5 According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, between 1980 and 2023 the United States had 22 wildfire events that individually caused more than $1 billion in damage; 18 of those have occurred since 2000.6 Over the past few decades, the United States has routinely spent more than $1 billion per year to fight wildfires, including $3.5 billion in 2022.7 These efforts have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of firefighters.8 Even in communities far downwind, wildfire smoke has been directly linked to poor air quality that can lead to significant health effects and costs to society (emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and deaths, often due to respiratory ailments).9-13\n\nBeyond the human and societal impacts, wildfires also affect the Earth’s climate. Forests in particular store large amounts of carbon. When they burn, they immediately release carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which in turn contributes to climate change. After burning, forests also release carbon dioxide more gradually through decomposition.\n\nAbout the Indicator\n\nThis indicator defines a wildfire as \"a wildland fire originating from an unplanned ignition, such as lightning, volcanos, unauthorized and accidental human caused fires, and prescribed fires that are declared wildfires.”14 This indicator tracks four aspects of wildfires over time: the total number of fires (frequency), the total land area burned (extent), the degree of damage that fires cause to the landscape (severity), and the acreage burned by fires starting in each month of the year (seasonal patterns).\n\nThe total area and total number of fires are tracked by the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles reports from local, state, and federal agencies that are involved in fighting wildfires. The U.S. Forest Service tracked similar data using a different reporting system until 1997. Those data have been added to this indicator for comparison. Burn severity, state-level acreage, and monthly totals are based on data from the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, which provides the location, ignition date, size, and other statistics for every individual wildfire that meets certain size criteria (≥ 1,000 acres in the western United States or ≥ 500 acres in the eastern United States). MTBS compares the “greenness” of satellite images taken before and after a fire to classify how severely the land has been burned. Burn severity provides an indication of the ecological damage and how long the effects of wildfires are likely to last.\n\nAlthough some nationwide fire data have been collected since the early 1900s, this indicator starts in 1983 (Figures 1 and 2) and 1984 (Figures 3 through 7), when nationwide data collection became more complete and standardized. EPA divided the time period in Figures 5, 6, and 7 into two roughly equal halves to compare changes in wildfire characteristics over time.\n\nAbout the Data\n\nIndicator Notes\n\nMany environmental impacts associated with climate change can affect the severity and timing of the wildfire season, including changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought. Short-term weather conditions (dryness, temperature, wind, lightning) influence the likelihood of ignition, where and how quickly a fire spreads, and how big it gets. Longer-term climate patterns also play a role by creating conditions that may be conducive to wildfire (for example, a multi-year regional drought). Human activities and land management practices also affect wildfire activity, and preferred practices in wildfire management have evolved over time, from older policies that favored complete wildfire prevention to more recent policies of wildfire suppression and controlled burns. Resources available to fight and manage wildfires can also influence the amount of area burned over time.\n\nWhile this indicator is limited to “wildland” fires, it includes fires that encroach on—or perhaps started in—developed areas. Increased development in previously wild lands could also influence trends in wildfire frequency and extent. The total number of fires may also vary due to reporting irregularities, as fires that split or merge together across jurisdictional lines may be counted differently.\n\nAlong with the influence of ongoing climate change, wildfire patterns can be influenced by natural climate cycles that tend to shift every few decades. Thus, with less than four decades of data shown here, it might be challenging to draw conclusions about long-term trends. While a longer record would be ideal, data from before 1983 are not consistent or detailed enough nationally to be included in this indicator.\n\nData Sources\n\nThe full set of wildfire frequency and burned acreage data in Figures 1 and 2 comes from the National Interagency Fire Center, which compiles wildfire reports sent from local, state, and federal entities that are involved in fighting fires. These data are available online at: www.nifc.gov/fire-information/statistics. Additional data were provided by the U.S. Forest Service based on a different set of records, referred to as Smokey Bear Reports. Burn severity data, state-by-state acreage totals, and monthly acreage data in Figures 3 through 7 come from the MTBS multi-agency project, which maintains a database of wildfire events across the United States. These data are publicly available at: www.mtbs.gov/direct-download.\n\nTechnical Documentation\n\nDownload related technical information PDF\n\nReferences\n\n1 MRLC (Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics) Consortium.
