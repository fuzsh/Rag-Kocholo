        "text": "The Simple Truth About the Gender Pay Gap\n\nA Persistent Inequity\n\nOver half a century after pay discrimination became illegal in the United States, a persistent pay gap between men and women continues to hurt our nation’s workers and our national economy.\n\nWomen working full time in the U.S. are still paid just 84 cents to every dollar earned by men — and the consequences of this gap affect women throughout their lives. The pay gap even follows women into retirement: As a result of lower lifetime earnings, they receive less in Social Security and pensions. In terms of overall retirement income, women have only 70% of what men do.\n\nPay equity will remain an AAUW priority until the gap is fully eliminated. We hope The Simple Truth motivates and empowers you to join us in this cause.\n\nDOWNLOAD THE FULL REPORT\n\nDOWNLOAD THE 2022 UPDATE\n\nSystemic Racism and The Gender Pay Gap\n\nThe history of the gender and racial wage gaps is inextricably linked to the history of labor in America. From depriving Black women of wages under slavery and its aftermath, to creating lasting disparities in health, education and opportunity for Native women through land theft, to the legal and cultural limitations on women’s ability to earn money, our nation’s story is replete with discrimination and its consequences.\n\nRead the 2021 Simple Truth Supplement\n\nThe Pay Gap Through the Years\n\nEmployer practices — such as using prior salary history in setting current pay and prohibiting employees from discussing their wages — compound the problem.\n\nLearn More\n\nRace and the Pay Gap\n\nThe gender pay gap is the result of many factors, including race and ethnicity, disability, access to education and age. As a result, different groups of women experience very different gaps in pay. The gender pay gap is a complex issue that will require robust and inclusive solutions.\n\nAsian American Women working full-time, year-round are paid 99 cents and all earners (including part-time and seasonal) are paid 89 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men.\n\nBlack Women working full-time, year-round are paid 69 cents and all earners (including part-time and seasonal) are paid 66 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men.\n\nNative Hawaiian and Pacific Islander (NHPI) Women working full-time, year-round are paid 65 cents and all earners (including part-time and seasonal) are paid 61 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men.\n\nLatina women working full-time, year-round are paid 57 cents and all earners (including part-time and seasonal) are paid 52 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men.\n\nNative Women working full-time, year-round are paid 59 cents and all earners (including part-time and seasonal) are paid 55 cents for every dollar paid to non-Hispanic white men.\n\nExplore the Issue\n\nWhere you live and what you do can also impact your personal pay gap.\n\nThe gender pay gap varies substantially from state to state, due to factors such as:\n\nThe primary industries in the state and the opportunities they create\n\nDemographics such as race/ethnicity, age, and education level\n\nRegional differences in attitudes and beliefs about work and gender\n\nDifferences in the scope and strength of state pay discrimination laws and policies\n\nExplore Your State\n\nSTATE WAGE GAP DATA\n\nThe gender pay gap occurs across almost all occupations and industries:\n\nMale-dominated industries tend to have higher wages than industries and occupations made up mostly of female workers;\n\nIn a comparison of occupations with at least 50,000 men and 50,000 women in 2017, 107 out of 114 had statistically significant gaps in pay that favored men; six occupations had no significant gap; and just one had a gap favoring women.\n\nIn some occupations, women collectively are receiving billions less than they would with equal pay; for instance, women working as physicians and surgeons are paid $19 billion less annually than if they were paid the same as men in that occupation.\n\nPolicy & Legal Action\n\nAAUW believes that pay equity and equal employment opportunity are matters of simple fairness. AAUW is a leader in the fight to end wage discrimination and open doors for women in the workplace. See where we stand on important policy issues, make sure you know your legal rights and how to protect them, and join us in fighting for change by becoming an AAUW Two-Minute Activist.\n\nTake Action\n\nThere are lots of ways to get involved with AAUW’s work to advance gender equity. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of women and girls.\n\nSign up to get timely action alerts\n\nEmail\n\nZip Code\n\nThank you for subscribing!"
