        "text": "From the East Coast to the West Coast, there are 50 beautiful states in the U.S. to choose from when making a long-distance move decision. For those wanting a fresh start in a popular state, we recommend considering the 10 most populated states in the U.S. After all, they’re popular for a reason, right? Below, we’ve included the largest states by population as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. The latest data released in December 2022 by the U.S. Census Bureau covers the period of April 1, 2020 – July 1, 2022 (below, we cited the 2022 numbers).\n\nCalifornia\n\nIt could be the cliff-lined beaches, giant redwoods or booming tech and entertainment industries — but one thing’s for sure: California is a popular place to call home. According to the latest Census data, the Golden State is officially the most populous state in the country. Here’s a quick rundown:\n\nPopulation: 39,029,342\n\nPopulation density: California is the third largest state by area, putting its population density at 251.3 per square mile, which ranks 11th in the country. Given California’s large size (in terms of surface area), this is especially impressive.\n\nPopulation notes: According to the Public Policy Institute of California, the California Department of Finance currently projects that the state’s population will reach almost 42 million by 2030, but new projections to be released this year are likely to be lower.” Both the San Francisco Bay Area and the Greater Los Angeles Area are two of the country’s most populated urban areas.\n\nState capital: Sacramento\n\nMajor cities in California include: Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, San Francisco, Fresno, Sacramento, Oakland, Santa Ana, and Anaheim.\n\nFun fact: California’s GDP in 2022 was $3.6T, representing 14.3% of the total U.S. economy. If California were a country, it would be the fifth-largest economy in the world.\n\nTexas\n\nWhether you’re a cowboy or an aerospace engineer, Texas is a fantastic place to call home. The Lone Star State boasts a rich history, ample job opportunities, authentic tex-mex, a major space center, presidential libraries, and plenty of vibrant cities. Here’s a quick rundown:\n\nPopulation:30,029,572\n\nPopulation density: Given its large size, which only ranks second in the nation behind Alaska, it’s no surprise that Texas has a large population. Texas might be the second largest in terms of surface area at 268,581 square miles (696,241 square kilometers) but has just 105.2 people per square mile and those figures are merely the 26th highest in the U.S. You’ll find many Texas residents living in and around major cities, such as Dallas and Houston.\n\nPopulation notes: Texas has three cities with more than one million people: Dallas, Houston and San Antonio, which also rank as 10 of the most populous cities in the country. There are also three cities with a population of over 500,000, which are El Paso, Fort Worth and the capital, Austin, which are among the 25 largest cities in the US.\n\nState capital: Austin\n\nMajor cities in Texas include: Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, Austin, Fort Worth, Irving, Plano, and Corpus Christi.\n\nFun fact: The popular Texas slogan, “Don’t Mess with Texas,” comes from a 1990’s anti-littering advertising campaign.\n\nFlorida\n\nIf you’re looking for warm, balmy winters, you’ll find it in Florida. The average January – February temperatures in South Florida hover around the 75-degree mark, making it prime beach weather year-round.

Here’s a quick rundown:\n\nPopulation:22,244,823\n\nPopulation density: In terms of population density, Florida has a surface area of 65,755 square miles (170,304 square kilometers). Based on estimates, that equates to 353.4 people per square mile, (136.4 per square kilometer) and that makes it the eighth most densely populated state in the U.S. Given its popularity with retirees and snowbirds, it’s no wonder Florida is one of the most densely populated states in the country.\n\nPopulation notes: As of December 2022, Florida is the nation’s fastest-growing state for the first time since 1957, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Vintage 2022 population estimates. Florida’s population increased by 1.9% to 22,244,823 between 2021 and 2022, surpassing Idaho, the previous year’s fastest-growing state.\n\nState capital: Tallahassee\n\nMajor cities in Florida include: Tallahassee, Orlando, Miami, Tampa, Jacksonville, St. Petersburg, Hialeah, and Fort Lauderdale.\n\nFun fact: The Florida Everglades, visited by over one million people every year, is the largest tropical wilderness east of the Mississippi River.\n\nNew York\n\nThe State of New York is well-known for being home to the most densely populated major city in the country: New York City.

Both the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution were drafted in the city of Philadelphia.
