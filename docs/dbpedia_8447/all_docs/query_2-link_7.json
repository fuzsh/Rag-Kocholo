        "text": "Most of the revenue the U.S. government collects comes from contributions from individual taxpayers, small businesses, and corporations through taxes. Additional sources of tax revenue consist of excise tax, estate tax, and other taxes and fees. So far in FY 0 , individual income taxes have accounted for % of total revenue while Social Security and Medicare taxes made up another %.\n\nGovernment revenue also comes from payments to federal agencies like the U.S. Department of the Interior. Have you visited a national park recently? Did you know your national park entry is included in government revenue? Other agencies generate revenue from leases, the sale of natural resources, and various usage and licensing fees.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare Taxes\n\nUnlike personal income taxes, which support a variety of programs, these taxes are only used to fund Social Security and Medicare. These funds are collected from your paycheck, and in most cases, matched by your employer, and then divided into separate trust funds that support each of those programs.\n\nSocial Security has two trust fund accounts: the Old Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund (OASI) and the Disability Trust Fund (DI). The funds in these accounts are responsible for providing workers and their families with retirement, disability, and survivor's insurance benefits.\n\nMedicare also has two accounts: the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund (HI), also known as Medicare Part A, and the Supplementary Medicare Insurance Trust Fund (SMI). These funds pay for hospital, home health, skilled nursing, and hospice care for the elderly and disabled."
