        "meta_description": "This is the intimate and revealing story of Stephen Hawking`s life. Told for the first time in Hawking`s own words and with unique access to his home and public life, this is a personal journey through Hawking`s world. The audience joins him at home, under the care of his nursing team; in San Jose as he \"wows\" a packed theatre audience; in Silicon Valley as he meets a team of technicians who hope to speed up his communication system; and as he throws a party for family and friends. Hawking also carefully tells Hawking`s life journey, from boyhood under-achiever to PhD genius, and from a healthy coxswain on the Oxford rowing team to diagnosis of motor neuron disease, given just two years to live - yet surviving several close brushes with death. The film also highlights his greatest scientific discoveries and plots to his rise to fame and superstardom.",
