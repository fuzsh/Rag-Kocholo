        "text": "Renowned British physicist Stephen Hawking passed away on Wednesday at the age of 76. Professor Hawking's children, Lucy, Robert and Tim said in a statement, \"We are deeply saddened that our beloved father passed away today. He was a great scientist and an extraordinary man whose work and legacy will live on for many years. His courage and persistence with his brilliance and humour inspired people across the world. We will miss him forever.\"\n\nEddie Redmayne won Oscars in the Best Actor category for playing Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything\n\nSpeaking about his experience spent with the real hero Stephen Hawking, Eddie said at the Variety Screen Awards, \"In the three hours that I spent with him, he may have said eight or nine sentences, and some of them were wonderfully specific about, for example, his voice. Really what I gained from that experience with him was more what he emanates: It was this extraordinary, incisive weight, a formidable sense of humor and most of all, a sense of mischief,” he said. “I described it as a Lord of Misrule quality. Even though it’s difficult for him to communicate, he completely runs the room and you can really feel his power.\n\nStephen Hawking appeared in many shows and films in showbiz and the late scientist was also part of the famous American Television series The Big Bang Theory. Jim Parsons, who is famously known as Sheldon in the series, had the opportunity to share screen space with Hawking. Earlier, speaking to news portal TV Guide, Parsons explained his experience working with Stephan Hawking. He said, “It was insane and intense, if I'm being honest. To be in his presence was a very powerful thing. He's communicating only through a speech-generating device, but I was also able to look into his eyes. We had this scene written out, and obviously his lines were pre-programmed into his computer. They had the capability of just cue-ing his lines, but he demanded to control every take himself by operating his machine with his cheek muscle. At first he was very slow getting the cues going, but they fine-tuned it. Only at the very end of the day did I realize the magnitude of what we'd pulled off.\"\n\nStephen Finnigan directed a biopic made on world renounced physicist Stephen Hawking in 2013. The director had the opportunity to spend some quality time with him. Finnigan shared his experience meeting Stephen Hawking and said that the scientist was absolutely different from what he had thought to be. He explained that although Stephen is a great scientist, but it is actually possible to have a good laugh with him.\n\nBrent Spinner worked with Stephen Hawking in Star Trek: The Next Generation in 1993. Brent played the character Starfleet Lieutenant Commander Data, while Stephan Hawking played himself in the famous film. Speaking to Space.com, Brent revealed that he fondly calls Stephen Hawking ‘The Hawk’.\n\nHe said, “I call him \"The Hawk\" because I've worked with him.” But however, Brent joked that the physicist has no idea about the new nick name given by him.\n\nGame of Silence actress Eileen Grubba had the opportunity to speak with Professor Stephen Hawking about disability discrimination and she described that her experience is beyond explanation. The actress today took to Twitter to mourn Hawking's death and tweeted, “One of the most profound experiences of my life: meeting Professor #StephenHawking. I will never forget him. He exemplifies what we fight so hard for: the GREAT TALENTS & GIFTS people w/disabilities have to offer our world. They ALL have great talents to share! Our #GameChangers.”"
