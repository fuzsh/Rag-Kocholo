        "text": "When, aged 21, Stephen Hawking was diagnosed with motor neurone disease, doctors gave him two years to live. His life has circled the event horizon ever since, dancing on the edge of a black hole — fearlessly, and with a surprisingly fruity sense of humour. So much for genius: turns out he’s a big fan of Dumb And Dumber. Hawking narrates his story in his signature Speak & Spell burr, focusing as much on his failures (two divorces) as his eureka moments. Inspiring both empathy and awe, this is an intensely personal portrait granting rare access to a beautiful mind. Go see."
