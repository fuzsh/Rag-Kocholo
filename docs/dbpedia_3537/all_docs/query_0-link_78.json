        "text": "Written and narrated by the 71-year-old author of A Brief History Of Time, Professor Hawking tells how he overcame severe disability to become the most famous living scientist in the world.\n\nHe attended a reception at Emmanuel College before a showing at the nearby Picturehouse cinema for the opening night of the Cambridge Film Festival.\n\nAs she helped him on his arrival, one of his carers, Dutson, said: \"I have worked with Stephen for 11 years - it has sometimes been harrowing but mostly fun.\n\n\"People see him as a renowned physicist but I just know him as Stephen, who has a great sense of humour.\"\n\nStephen Finnigan, the film's director, supported this description of the University of Cambridge professor.\n\nHe said: \"Stephen was very different to how I imagined him to be.\n\n\"You expect him to be quite plain speaking, quite academic and quite brainy but actually you can have a laugh with Stephen Hawking.\n\n\"I went for a curry with him this afternoon and you can chat to him about anything.\"\n\nIn the trailer for the film, the University of Cambridge professor says: \"This film is a personal journey through my life.\"\n\n\"I have lived five decades longer than doctors predicted. I have tried to make good use of my time.\"\n\nHawking has recently spoken out in favour of assisted suicide for people with terminal diseases.\n\nIn an interview which will reignite the heated debate surrounding euthanasia, he told the BBC: \"We don't let animals suffer, so why humans?\"\n\nHe said: \"I think those who have a terminal illness and are in great pain should have the right to choose to end their lives and those who help them should be free from prosecution.\n\n\"But there must be safeguards that the person concerned genuinely wants to end their life and they are not being pressurised into it or have it done without their knowledge or consent, as would have been the case with me.\"\n\nProf Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neurone disease, when he was 21. He was told he had only a few years to live.\n\nThe film goes back to his childhood and his student days and shows him at home with carers.\n\nIt features interviews with his family, including his first wife Jane Wilde, along with friends and fellow academics.\n\nFollowing a bout of pneumonia in 1985, he was placed on a life support machine which his first wife, Jane Hawking, had the option to switch off.\n\nRecovering from the disease, Prof Hawking went on to complete his popular science best-seller A Brief History of Time, which sold more than 10 million copies worldwide.\n\nOnly 5% of people with the kind of MND he has - called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or Lou Gehrig's disease - survive for more than a decade after diagnosis.\n\nReferring to euthanasia in 2006, he said: \"The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.\""
