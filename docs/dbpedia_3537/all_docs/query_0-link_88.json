The squalor of modern-day Manila is vividly evoked, as our goodly, hard-up couple struggle to gain a foothold, but the opportunities they get only lead them into the moral shadows.\n\nDiana (12A)\n\n(Oliver Hirschbiegel, 2013, UK/Fra/Bel/Swe/Moz) Naomi Watts, Naveen Andrews. 113 mins\n\nHistory repeats itself as farce in this unintentionally laughable rendition of Diana's final years and her \"secret\" affair.

Sex addicts speak in Thanks For Sharing… James McAvoy wallows in Irvine Welsh's Filth…\n\nIn three weeks...
