        "text": "I’m in New York trying to avoid being trampled on my way to breakfast. But black or no, it’s still Friday and that means new movies are opening ; they’re just doing so in the shadow of the studio holiday pictures that opened on Wednesday.\n\nHere’s what’s what:\n\nAKA Doc Pomus: “AKA Jerome Solon Felder” would be a more fitting title, since it’s almost certain more people have heard of his alias than his real name. William Hechter and Peter Miller’s documentary, narrated by Lou Reed, gives the man his due.\n\nThe Armstrong Lie: John has a number of the same problems with Alex Gibney’s overly personal study of Lance Armstrong as I did — Gibney’s unable to separate his own disillusionment with Armstrong (whose 2009 Tour de France comeback Gibney had been documenting until the doping scandal finally overtook them both) from the stuff that actually matters, and at over two hours it’s crushingly long and repetitive.\n\nBlack Nativity: An old Langston Hughes play becomes a Tyler Perryesque motion picture experience in the hands of director Kasi Lemmons, whose electric debut Eve’s Bayou seems more and more like a fluke with every passing year. Rad is unmoved.\n\nConcussion: Deadwood‘s Robin Weigert is a woman jolted out of her dull life by a head injury in Stacie Passon’s gauzy erotic drama, which Susan finds considerably more gauzy than erotic.\n\nHawking: Rad finds Stephen Finnigan’s documentary about the legendarily tragic (tragically legendary?) physics genius a little too timid and superficial. Me, I’m happy to drag out the old LaserDisc of Errol Morris’ A Brief History of Time.\n\nIf I Were You: Marcia Gay Harden plays a woman who befriends her husband’s mistress in what’s supposed to be a farce — but actually plays better as drama, according to Jose. I will take his word for it.\n\nPhilomena: Stephen Frears’ new drama is a nuanced and charming road movie about an Irish woman (Judi Dench) and an English man (Steve Coogan, who co-wrote and co-produced) coming to terms with one another, and a few things besides, while searching for the son she gave up for adoption half a century earlier. Sounds schmaltzy. Isn’t.\n\nNarco Cultura: Remember the musical number that opened that one episode of Breaking Bad? That was a narcocorrido, a ballad composed to lionize the great drug warrior Heisenberg — and it turns out the genre is a booming industry. Rad really likes Shaul Schwartz’ look at the artists who turn bloody deeds into stirring song.\n\nTokyo Waka: A City Poem: Glenn finds some things to like in John Haptas and Kristine Samuelson’s impressionistic documentary about the crows of Tokyo. (Well, a few more than I did, anyway.)\n\nAnd that’s it! Keep an eye on my Twitter feed this weekend for dispatches from Manhattan, and possibly an image of someone punching me because I looked like I might be about to touch a sweater he or she was going to buy.\n\nYeah, I’m so not here for the sales.\n\nI’ve interviewed Steve Coogan a few times over the last decade — we first met in 2005 when he and Michael Winterbottom brought Tristram Shandy: A Cock and Bull Story to TIFF — and it’s no secret that I kind of love the guy.\n\n(I kind of love Winterbottom too, which is why it’s so tragic that the pair’s most recent collaboration, The Look of Love, went straight to DVD up here and isn’t even getting a North American Blu-ray release.)\n\nAnyway, Coogan was back at TIFF this year with Philomena, a fine stranger-than-fiction road movie for which he has a better-than-average chance of landing a screenwriting Oscar nomination, at least. We talked about it, and you’ll find that interview in the new issue of NOW. Be sure to play the audio clips, too.\n\nI also wrote a couple of things about TIFF’s Joel and Ethan Coen retrospective, which should get the blood up in anticipation of Inside Llewyn Davis; here are some thoughts about the series, and my pick of the Coens’ five best sequences.\n\nAlso, the 2013 Brazil Film Fest is in town and I watched some of it.\n\nIn other news: Happy Thanksgiving, America! I’m coming for your pies! Hope that doesn’t sound too weird.\n\nThe Thanksgiving Day weekend looms to the south, which means a few Wednesday releases for big studio pictures. My reviews for Homefront and Oldboy will go online later tonight, in NOW’s web refresh; I’ll link to to them when they’re available.\n\nFrozen: Disney returns to the Broadway model that sparked its animation renaissance for a tremendously entertaining fantasy comedy of surprising emotional complexity — I don’t think it actually has a villain, per se — and stuffed with delightful character work. I want my own Olaf.\n\nHomefront: Written and produced by Sylvester Stallone, this bayou actioner has a pleasantly retro feel — you could imagine Arnold Schwarzenegger making it between Commando and Raw Deal — but it stars Jason Statham, so we don’t have to worry about the hero’s hip giving out when things get rough. Also, James Franco is kind of great as a bad guy.\n\nOldboy: Remember the slippery nightmare of Park Chan-wook’s breakout? Well, stick with your memories, because Spike Lee just screws it up royally. After the screening, I suggested nominating Sharlto Copley for the TFCA’s Best Supporting Actor award, because if he won he might show up and then we could lock him in a hotel room until he apologized.\n\nYeah. It’s been that kind of week.\n\nSo there you go: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a monster.\n\nThe second film in the four-part cycle opened with $161.1 million domestically and another $146.6 million internationally this weekend — and given that it ends on a cliffhanger one may assume Mockingjay: Part One will do very nicely for itself as well.\n\nAfter the success of all five Twilight movies, it’s obvious that quality has nothing to do with a movie’s financial performance, but I will say that Catching Fire marks a modest improvement on the first Hunger Games movie. Francis Lawrence is just better suited to action than Gary Ross was; Ross didn’t have the feel for pacing or tension that Lawrence brings to Catching Fire, which has almost exactly the same structure and plot as its predecessor.\n\nI’m still not a fan of the story, which takes the premise of Battle Royale and staples on a generic dystopian rebellion backstory, but this one was a little more energetic and a lot better photographed. And I really admire Jennifer Lawrence’s choices; at a point where she could maybe push back against the occasional unflattering camera angle or clunky line of dialogue, she just commits fully and without vanity. Not everyone is willing to ugly-cry for their art these days, you know?\n\nWell, it’s been a busier week than usual but my head’s still attached to my torso. And it’ll be even busier tomorrow, when I appear on Newstalk 1010’s Entertainment Extra around 4:30 pm to discuss The Big Lebowski with Richard Crouse and Geoff Pevere, and then hie down to the Lightbox to introduce the 7 pm screening of David Cronenberg’s The Fly.\n\n[UPDATE: The Entertainment Extra show has been posted online, and our chunk of it starts around 18 minutes in.]\n\nHey, this is the life I’ve chosen. Shall we look at this week’s movies?\n\nDelivery Man: Hey, remember Starbuck? Well, this is Starbuck Too, and on those terms it’s surprisingly okay. I mean, “I was expecting a lot worse” isn’t the highest endorsement, I know, but it’s the truth.\n\nEmpire of Dirt: Peter Stebbings follows Defendor with a far more realistic look at families, secrets and shame. Glenn is reasonably okay with that.\n\nGMO OMG: Another one of those insufferably twee documentaries that believes hipster affectation in the name of education is no vice. Dear Christ, it could not be more wrong.\n\nThe Hunger Games: Catching Fire: Hey, did you like the first one? Well, you’ll love the sequel, because it’s exactly the same movie with more stable cinematography and Philip Seymour Hoffman instead of Wes Bentley — and the last hour is in IMAX, so it looks really nice. Susan liked it more than I did.\n\nGod Loves Uganda: Roger Ross Williams’ documentary explores the efforts of American fundmentalists to make contemporary Uganda even more homophobic than it already is. Susan is understandably horrified.\n\nLooking Is the Original Sin: Gail Harvey is an amazing photographer, but she’s a terrible director. (John Harkness and I bonded over suffering through her horrendous first feature The Shower two decades ago.) Rad has some kind words for Maria del Mar and Katie Boland, who star as a mother and daughter struggling with a family secret, but can’t get behind the movie itself.\n\nNebraska: Alexander Payne’s latest gets a big shrug from me, as I see what he’s doing but don’t get particularly excited about it. Woulda been nice if Bruce Dern and Stacy Keach had swapped roles the day before shooting, but I guess that wasn’t my choice to make.\n\nVic + Flo Saw a Bear: Denis Cote returns with another emotionally austere study of angry people making mistakes — and it’s damn involving even if we never get to see the bear. (Pro tip: That’s not Ken Jeong in drag, but Quebec actress Marie Brassard. You’re welcome.)\n\nThere, that’s everything. Go see something, won’t you?\n\nNo one was surprised that Thor: The Dark World held on to the top spot at the box-office this weekend, though its $38.5 million gross marks a considerable drop from last week’s $86.1 million opening.\n\nWhat was truly surprising was the triumph of The Best Man Holiday, which exploded into second place with an extremely respectable $30.6 million opening despite middling reviews and being a sequel to a 14-year-old, largely forgotten dramedy. Clearly, this is the Tyler Perry effect, in which an underrepresented audience flocks to a film that offers such representation. And it’s particularly encouraging to see it happening for a movie that wasn’t made by Tyler Perry.\n\nI’m just hoping Taye Diggs and Terrence Howard get a real boost out of this. Not that they aren’t proper movie stars already, but they’re rarely credited with drawing audiences on their own. This makes it clear they have fans who’ll show up to see them in the right projects. (Hell, I’m one of those fans.) Let’s see what happens next, shall we?\n\nIt’s Friday, and movies are opening, so I must not look at my news feed. Must not … look … at news feed …\n\nThe Best Man Holiday: Hey, remember The Best Man? Me neither, but they made another one.\n\nThe Book Thief: The studio that brought you Life of Pi rolls out another craven literary adaptation that smothers interesting potentially rich themes under a coat of syrupy fabulism. Doesn’t fly this time.\n\nDear Mr. Watterson: Less a documentary about the man who gave us Calvin and Hobbes than a meander through his legacy, Joel Allen Schroeder’s feature-length fan letter takes a very long time to get to the good stuff. But that stuff is pretty good, so …\n\nGeography Club: Queer teens find strength in numbers — and in secret — in this young-adult drama, which Glenn really enjoyed despite it not being a musical. (His words, not mine.)\n\nHow I Live Now: Saoirse Ronan mopes through a post-apocalyptic England in this TIFF debut, which lost all of its buzz about five minutes after the first press screening let out. Andy explains why.\n\nShort Term 12: Days after its Toronto premiere at Rendezvous with Madness, Destin Daniel Cretton’s terrific character study rolls into a commercial run. It’s terrific (and so is Brie Larson). Go see it.\n\nWhen Jews Were Funny: Alan Zweig’s documentary shocked us by winning the Best Canadian Feature prize at TIFF, but Susan is still on the fence about it. So am I.\n\nThere. Done. Now, what mischief will those wacky Ford boys get up to today?"
