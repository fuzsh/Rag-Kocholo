        "text": "Ain’t Them Bodies Saints\n\nSpanning four to five years and set sometime during the decade after the second World War, Ain’t Them Bodies Saints is a story about liminality and transitions. The plot follows the homeward journey of Bob (Casey Affleck), a man born into a life of crime as he returns to his wife Ruth (Rooney Mara) and Read More\n\nRush\n\nIt is hard to believe this story is real. Those of you who might be sent running in the other direction by a film about racing may want to reconsider your previous inclinations. Set in the 1970s, the film exploits our natural tendency to white-wash the past. The beauty of Rush lies in its delicate Read More\n\nCut and Paste: Investigating the Materiality of Information\n\nThis exhibition, the collaborative work of three promising young artists from the Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design, continues the artistic interrogation of philosophical questions surrounding new media technology. This interrogation was begun with notable events such as Cybernetic Serendipity (Institute of Contemporary Arts, 1968) and Les Immatériaux (Centre Georges Pompidou, 1985). It Read More\n\nFilth\n\nIt has been 17 years since Danny Boyle’s inspired adaption of Irvine Welsh’s novel Trainspotting took British cinema by storm, becoming a cult hit which inspired a new age of British film making under the banner of “Cool Britannia”. Subsequent adaptations of Welsh’s work have struggled by comparison, with Ecstasy and The Acid House representing Read More\n\nBlue Jasmine\n\nAfter recent excursions to some of Europe’s most iconic cities, prolific filmmaker Woody Allen returns to the United States with his latest film. Blue Jasmine (2013), the 43rd feature directed by Allen, is a loose and contemporary retelling of Tennessee Williams’ Pulitzer Prize winning play A Streetcar Named Desire (1947). The movie centres on the Read More\n\nNegative Capitalism: Cynicism in the Neoliberal Era\n\nFor those interested in an account of the ways in which capitalism has made our lives miserable, J. D. Taylor’s Negative Capitalism: Cynicism in the Neoliberal Era will not disappoint. However, the book is not simply a tirade; it aims to spur the reader to reject current conditions of work and existence in favour of Read More\n\nThe Way, Way Back\n\nThe Way, Way Back is an absolutely brilliant film which is funny, moving, uplifting and features a great cast. The film focuses on the difficulties faced by Duncan, a 14 year old boy (Liam James), on summer holiday as he tries to deal with puberty, girls and his new post-divorce family dynamic. His father doesn’t Read More\n\nHawking\n\nDuring the live Q and A which followed this documentary on Professor Stephen Hawking’s life, director Stephen Finnigan described the titular cosmologist in three words: ‘inspiring, determined and funny.’ Finnigan’s documentary achieves such an insight into the life and mind of the world’s most famous contemporary scientist, giving a view of the man not always Read More\n\nThere will be new rules next week\n\nYou would never have suspected how much influence that political and religious rebel – Sister Corita Kent – has on young artists today. Sister Corita revolutionised graphic design, combing slogans and poetry that reflected her commitment to social justice. I will admit that Sister Corita’s enthusiasm for colour and language enticed me to return to Read More\n\nVictoria\n\nDavid Greig is one of Scotland’s most influential and prolific playwrights (forty plays in the last 20 years). The diversity of his work is extraordinary. He has produced work from Damascus (Edinburgh International Festival 2009) through to Dunsinane (Royal Shakespeare Company 2010) and has adapted several classics including Euripides’ Bacchae starring Alan Cumming (National Theatre Read More"
