Ron and his siblings lived at The Burrow, on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole, Devon.\n\nRon began attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 and was Sorted into Gryffindor House. He soon became close friends with fellow student Harry Potter and later Hermione Granger. Together, they made the Golden Trio and faced many challenges during their adolescence, including keeping the Philosopher's Stone from Professor Quirinus Quirrell, rescuing Ginny from the Basilisk in the Chamber of Secrets, saving Harry's godfather Sirius Black from the Dementors of Azkaban, and guiding Harry through the Triwizard Tournament.\n\nHe also helped form Dumbledore's Army and fought in numerous battles of the Second Wizarding War. These battles included the Battle of the Department of Mysteries (1996), Battle of the Astronomy Tower (1997), and Battle of the Seven Potters (1997). Ron also became a Gryffindor prefect and a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team during his fifth year at Hogwarts.\n\nHe skipped his last year of school in order to accompany Harry and Hermione on a hunt to destroy all of Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes and fought in the Battle of Hogwarts in 1998, during which he lost his brother Fred, a loss which devastated him and his family, especially George, Fred's twin.\n\nAfter the war, Ron became an Auror and helped reform and revolutionise the British Ministry of Magic.[27] After two years as an Auror, he went to work at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes with his brother George.

Being the sixth son in the Weasley family, he was expected to match or even surpass the achievements of his older siblings. His brothers Bill and Charlie had set high standards, with Bill being a Head Boy and Charlie being the captain of Quidditch. Even his twin brothers, Fred and George, despite their notorious pranks, were academically successful and popular. So, everyone expected Ron to do as well as the others. However, he felt that even if he did meet these expectations, it wouldn't be a big deal because his siblings had already achieved those milestones.\n\nProvided by: Community\n\nBiography[]\n\nEarly life (1980–1991)[]\n\nRonald Bilius Weasley was born 1 March 1980, to Arthur and Molly Weasley (née Prewett),[11] at the height of the First Wizarding War. During this war his maternal uncles Fabian and Gideon Prewett, both members of the Order of the Phoenix, were murdered while fighting a group of four Death Eaters led by Antonin Dolohov.[5] While he was still a toddler, the war ended for a time after Lord Voldemort's first defeat at the hands of Ron's classmate-to-be Harry Potter on the 31 October 1981.\n\nRon and his five older brothers — Bill, Charlie, Percy, Fred and George — as well as his younger sister, Ginny, grew up in The Burrow on the outskirts of Ottery St Catchpole in Devon, England. Like all his siblings, he was home educated in reading, writing and simple mathematics by his mother. The Weasley family was not wealthy at all, compared to other wizarding families.[28] Many other pure-blood families, particularly the Malfoys, disdained them for their \"blood traitor\" beliefs and lack of wealth. They tried their best to make up for this with their love.[29]\n\nThe Weasley siblings, especially Fred and George, were fond of teasing and playing pranks on each other, and Ron was a particular target for Fred and George. They once Transfigured Ron's teddy bear into a giant spider, sparking his arachnophobia. On another occasion, the twins nearly got him to make an Unbreakable Vow, which finally made their father truly furious (and Fred would later state that his left buttock has \"never been the same since\" after the row that ensued). They also once got him to eat an Acid Pop which burnt a hole through his tongue.\n\nWhen Ron was younger, he had a pet rat named Scabbers, whom he had inherited from Percy. This rat was actually Peter Pettigrew, an informant and Voldemort's servant who betrayed Harry's parents. Ron was very fond of Scabbers, but wasn't sad to let him go when he found out the truth about his old rat.[28][30] Ron had a fairly happy childhood, which Harry envied, having been brought up by his spiteful relatives, the Dursley family. To compensate for their impoverishment, Ron's mother indulged him in three delicious meals daily. This became so habitual that missing a meal in later life would irritate Ron.\n\nHogwarts years (1991–1997)[]\n\nFirst year[]\n\nMeeting Harry and Hermione[]\n\nRon began to attend Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1991 at the customary age of eleven. He was Sorted into Gryffindor House, like every other Weasley. On his first trip on the Hogwarts Express, Ron met and became friends with the famous wizard Harry Potter. Harry let him share his carriage on the Hogwarts Express and purchased a large amount of wizarding snacks from the Hogwarts Express food trolley to share with him. Later on, Harry would stand up for Ron against Slytherin bully Draco Malfoy and Ron would elect to be his second for a midnight duel.[11]\n\nRon and Harry first met Hermione Granger on the train but Ron did not particularly take to her. Ron, especially, was annoyed by what he saw as Hermione showing off her knowledge of magic, such as when she corrected him on the pronunciation of the incantation Wingardium Leviosa.[11]\n\nHallowe'en[]\n\nPrior to the Hallowe'en feast, Ron angrily declared that Hermione was a know-it-all and did not have any friends. Hermione overheard his outburst and went running to the girl's bathroom in tears. That evening, during the Hallowe'en feast, it was announced that a mountain troll was loose in the school. Ron and Harry came to Hermione's rescue after hearing that she was in trouble, with Ron successfully using the Levitation Charm to levitate the troll's club and drop it on its head, knocking it out. She, in return, lied to protect them from Professor McGonagall. The three then became very close friends.[11]\n\nProtecting the Philosopher's Stone[]\n\nDuring their first year, the three of them learnt that the Philosopher's Stone was being hidden in Hogwarts and sought to protect it from being stolen by Severus Snape, whom the young wizards believed to be working for Lord Voldemort. Ron's talent in Wizard's Chess allowed them to pass one of the obstacles protecting the stone, which was a life-sized game. Ron sacrificed himself as a game piece so Harry could place the enemy king in checkmate, allowing Harry and Hermione to move on.\n\nUltimately, it was discovered that Professor Quirrell was trying to steal the stone for Voldemort. Harry succeeded in defeating him and protecting the Philosopher's Stone, and Ron was awarded fifty House points by Albus Dumbledore for \"the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years\", allowing Gryffindor to win the House Cup for the first time in seven years.[11]\n\nSecond year[]\n\nFlying the Ford Anglia[]\n\nHaving not heard from Harry Potter during the whole summer of 1992, Ron, Fred and George Weasley, in a planned scheme to rescue him from 4 Privet Drive, drove Arthur Weasley's flying Ford Anglia to the Muggle town of Little Whinging and tore the bars from Harry's bedroom window using the car's horsepower. Ron and the twins helped Harry get his things in the car, and they left for the Weasley House. Upon landing Ron and his brothers were ratted out by Molly Weasley for having taken such a risky course of action.\n\nAt the start of that year's school term, Ron and Harry missed the Hogwarts Express due to the tricks of Dobby the house-elf and were forced to use the Ford Anglia to travel to Hogwarts. At the end of their journey, the car failed, causing the boys to crash-land into the Whomping Willow. They were nearly killed when the tree shook, and the car jettisoned them and took off into the Forbidden Forest, where it remained.[29]\n\nAttempt to curse Malfoy[]\n\nRon's wand was damaged in the crash, causing him problems for the entire school year. It backfired when Ron attempted to curse Draco Malfoy in payback for calling Hermione a \"Mudblood\" with the Slug-vomiting Charm, resulting with him vomiting slugs and slime.\n\nMalfoy's disdain towards Muggle-borns led Ron, Harry, and Hermione to suspect that he was the Heir of Slytherin who opened the Chamber of Secrets that year, unleashing a \"monster\" that began to attack Muggle-born students.[29]\n\nImpersonating Crabbe[]\n\nTo investigate this theory, Hermione brewed a Polyjuice Potion which greatly surprised Ron in that she was so overtly breaking the rules. When the time came to use the potion, Ron was made to impersonate Vincent Crabbe, and Harry impersonated Gregory Goyle, while Hermione's transformation was unsuccessful because she mistook hair from Millicent Bulstrode's cat for her own.\n\nRon and Harry interrogated Malfoy in the Slytherin Common Room, during which Malfoy proceeded to insult both Dumbledore and Harry. He also made a callous comment about Hermione, hoping that she would be the Muggle-born victim that dies during the attacks. \"But I know one thing: last time the Chamber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s only a matter of time before one of them’s killed this time… I hope it’s Granger\".[31] This comment upset both Ron and Harry, but they were able to maintain their cover and eventually realised that Malfoy was not the Heir of Slytherin.[29] In fact, Malfoy had no idea who was behind the attacks.\n\nReturn to the Forbidden Forest[]\n\nRon and Harry were both greatly upset when Hermione became another victim of the \"monster\", ending up petrified in the Hospital Wing, though she left her friends a clue that led them to deduce that the monster was a basilisk. Ron showed incredible bravery during the course of their investigation by venturing into the Forbidden Forest to an Acromantula den led by Aragog, in spite of his extreme fear of spiders.\n\nHarry and Ron learned Rubeus Hagrid had nothing to do with opening the chamber, but when Aragog tried to make a meal of them, they narrowly escaped thanks to the magic that had engulfed the Flying Ford Anglia.[29] After escaping the forest Ron was furious with Hagrid for endangering their lives.\n\nSkirmish in the Chamber of Secrets[]\n\nWhen he and Harry learned that Ginny (Ron's younger sister) was dying in the Chamber of Secrets, they raced to save her, planning to give their information to Professor Gilderoy Lockhart. When the pair discovered that the professor was attempting to flee, they drew their wands on him and forced him to join them as they ventured into the Chamber of Secrets.\n\nShortly after Ron, Harry and Lockhart entered the Chamber, Lockhart attempted to wipe their memories in order to get out of the Chamber and take credit for their efforts in a bid for fame. Unfortunately for him, he used Ron's damaged wand, and the spell backfired, causing permanent amnesia in Lockhart. Ron was left behind to tend to Lockhart, as Harry delved deeper into the Chamber, saving Ginny and defeating Salazar Slytherin's basilisk, avenging all its petrified victims.[29]\n\nAfterwards, Ron was honoured with a Special Award for Services to the School, as well as earning two hundred House points for Gryffindor for his work concerning re-sealing the Chamber of Secrets.[29]\n\nThird year[]\n\nIn the summer following Ron's second year at Hogwarts, the Weasleys won the Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. Ron and his family used the money to travel to Egypt to visit Ron's eldest brother, Bill. News of their lucky break made the Daily Prophet, and Ron sent that newspaper clipping and a Sneakoscope to Harry for his thirteenth birthday. They met on the last day of the summer, when Ron and his family visited Diagon Alley with Harry and Hermione and took up rooms in the Leaky Cauldron in preparation for catching the Hogwarts Express. Ron's parents also purchased him a new wand to replace the broken one he had lost the previous year.[4]\n\nDuring their stay at the Leaky Cauldron, Ron shared a room with his brother Percy. Unfortunately, this led to a fight. Percy believed that Ron had taken his Head Boy badge, which had actually been stolen by Weasley twins Fred and George. Harry found the twins hiding, enchanting the badge to say \"Big Head Boy\". Later, Ron was also accused of smudging a picture of Percy's girlfriend, Penelope Clearwater with tea (Penelope thus hid herself outside the frame so nobody could see her splotched nose).[4]\n\nAlso that summer, Sirius Black, the most famous prisoner in Azkaban, escaped, and in light of this incident, security was tightened at Hogwarts which Ron and his friends noticed when the Hogwarts Express was stopped and searched by Dementors. Once at the school, Dumbledore announced that Dementors would be stationed around the school gates to prevent Black from entering Hogwarts. This was done under the assumption that Harry was being targeted by Black.[4]\n\nBeginning of term[]\n\nUpon starting the term, the third-years began taking new lessons. Ron and Harry had chosen Divination and Care of Magical Creatures, while Hermione decided to take every possible class offered and began to exhibit strange behaviour that neither Ron nor Harry could figure out. The pair quickly decided that Divination was not a class they really liked and that the professor, Sybill Trelawney, was a fraud.\n\nRon's first Care of Magical Creatures was a disaster. Hagrid, the new Care of Magical Creatures professor, had planned what he thought to be a spectacular class on hippogriffs, when a hippogriff named Buckbeak attacked Draco Malfoy after Malfoy had insulted the rare creature, causing Malfoy to promise revenge. Also during that week, Ron had his first Defence Against the Dark Arts class with the new professor, Remus Lupin, and in short order Ron thought that Lupin was an excellent professor.[4]\n\nFirst time in Hogsmeade[]\n\nOn Hallowe'en, Ron and Hermione went on their first Hogsmeade trip. Harry, however, could not join them as his uncle Vernon had not signed his Hogsmeade permission slip. Meanwhile, Ron and Hermione visited every building in Hogsmeade and brought back loads of sweets from Honeydukes for Harry. They were discussing blood-flavored lollipops and Cockroach Clusters.\n\nHarry used the Marauder's Map to sneak into Hogsmeade. He then met Ron and Hermione in Honeydukes. They visited the Three Broomsticks, a pub run by Madam Rosmerta. When Cornelius Fudge, Minerva McGonagall, Filius Flitwick, and Rubeus Hagrid arrived, Harry hide underneath their table to avoid being seen. Harry used a tunnel to sneak into Hogsmeade village.\n\nWhile sneaking back into the school, he overheard a disturbing conversation that had a severe impact on his mental state.[32] Sirius Black was his parents' best friend, and was his godfather and legal guardian. Black was the Potters' Secret Keeper and he allegedly divulged the Potters' secret whereabouts to Lord Voldemort and murdered their friend Peter Pettigrew, as well as twelve Muggle bystanders. Peter left a finger to prove that he had been killed with the twelve Muggles.[32] That evening, Sirius Black sneaked into Hogwarts, and the students were forced to spend the night in the Dining Hall.[4]\n\nThe disappearance of Scabbers[]\n\nJust before Christmas, Rubeus Hagrid received a complaint from the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures about Buckbeak the hippogriff. When he shared this incident with Ron, Harry, and Hermione, the trio promised to do everything in their power to help defend Buckbeak.\n\nRon and Harry put the defence of Buckbeak on the back-burner when on Christmas Day, Harry received a Firebolt broomstick from a mysterious sender. When Hermione, afraid for Harry's safety, turned the Firebolt in, Ron stopped talking to Hermione. The Firebolt incident only added to the rough tension between the two, as Hermione's new pet Crookshanks had been continually trying to attack Ron's rat, Scabbers. A few weeks later, when the two were on the verge of making up, Scabbers disappeared and Ron blamed Crookshanks, threatening the friendship between them.[4]\n\nSirius Black's infiltration[]\n\nIn the meantime, Black was yet to be found, and the night following the Gryffindor vs Ravenclaw Quidditch match, he sneaked into Gryffindor tower. Hearing the sound of ripping bed curtains, Ron awoke with a start to see Sirius Black standing over him holding a knife. He screamed, and Black fled.[4]\n\nWhen Ron had woken up the entire Gryffindor House they all gathered in the Gryffindor Common Room to discuss the events. Professor Minerva McGonagall, the Head of House, was called. Ron explained his story and theorised that Black must have gone for the wrong bed and was aiming for Harry Potter. McGonagall asked Sir Cadogan about it and he told her that he had let Black enter after Black gave him the correct passcode.[33]\n\nAnother search of the castle took place, but Black escaped capture again. The Fat Lady resumed her duty of guarding Gryffindor Tower on the condition her portrait be guarded. Neville was placed in detention and stripped of his visitation rights to Hogsmeade for the rest of the school year and the other Gryffindors were forbidden to tell him the password to the tower, forcing him to wait outside for someone to let him in while the security trolls guarding the Fat Lady leered unpleasantly at him. But none of that compared to the Howler his grandmother sent him during breakfast, which shouted at him that he had brought shame to the family.[34]\n\nDefence of Buckbeak[]\n\nThis incident made Ron famous among the other students, but he came back down to Earth when Hagrid scolded him and Harry about their treatment of Hermione, who Hagrid told them was in over her head with all of her classes and the work she was doing for Buckbeak. Shocked, the pair patched things up with her a few days later, when they received a letter from Hagrid saying that Buckbeak had been sentenced to execution.[4]\n\nWith exams coming up, the trio set about studying and attempting to help Hagrid with Buckbeak's appeal. The appeal took place on the last day of their exams. Hearing that Buckbeak had lost, and was to be executed, Ron, Harry and Hermione went to visit Hagrid in the evening just before the execution. They offered to help set the record straight, but Hagrid told them that they would be in big trouble if they were seen. Helping the sobbing Hagrid make tea, Hermione found Scabbers hiding inside a milk jar. Soon they were hurried out the back of the hut, all the while they continued to lobby for a chance to set the record straight. When they heard what sounded like the killing, Ron, Harry and Hermione set off for Hogwarts in a slight state of shock.[4]\n\nThe Prisoner of Azkaban[]\n\nBefore they made it back there, Scabbers began to squirm in Ron's hands and escaped. Not wanting to lose his rat again, Ron chased after Scabbers with Harry and Hermione behind him. He caught up to Scabbers, but not before they were in the shadow of the Whomping Willow tree. He looked up to see a large black dog bearing down upon him. The dog dived at Ron and gripping Ron's arm in its mouth, it dragged him into the Whomping Willow. To try and stop the dog from pulling him further, Ron tied his feet around a tree branch, but the dog's grip was so powerful his leg snapped. When the dog reached the Shrieking Shack, it let go of Ron and revealed itself to be Sirius Black.[4]\n\nSirius ambushed Harry and Hermione, disarming them when they entered the room where Ron was being held hostage. Upon seeing him, Harry attacked Black with Hermione and the seriously injured Ron helping in any way they could, but Harry could not bring himself to finish the job when he had Black in his power, and he was disarmed by Professor Lupin. Relieved at the sight of Lupin, Ron became worried when Lupin and Black greeted each other like brothers and demanded that Ron turn over his rat, Scabbers. Sirius and Lupin then told them about their own years spent at Hogwarts and how a wizard named Peter Pettigrew betrayed Harry's parents to Voldemort then framed Sirius and transformed into a rat to go into hiding.\n\nStill not fully convinced, Ron reluctantly handed over Scabbers when Lupin promised that if he was actually a rat, no harm would come to him. Scabbers was revealed to be Pettigrew, whom Sirius had recognised due to a missing toe. (Pettigrew has cut off one of his own fingers before transforming). A tearful Pettigrew confessed to the betrayal and begged for mercy from his former friends.[4]\n\nWhen it was decided that Pettigrew should be turned over to the Dementors, Lupin splinted Ron's leg, and the assembled company left for Hogwarts. Along the way, the full moon broke out, and Lupin began to transform into a werewolf. In the skirmish, Pettigrew stole Lupin's wand, stunned Ron, and escaped into the moonlight. Hours later in the Hospital Wing, Ron was recovering both from his broken leg and Pettigrew's attack. As he was unable to walk, Ron did not join Harry and Hermione on their rescue mission to save Sirius from the Dementor's Kiss and Buckbeak from execution with Hermione's Time-Turner, though they would explain everything to him after they were successful in their task.[4]\n\nEnd-of-term[]\n\nRon understood why Hermione did not immediately mention the Time-Turner. Ron was slightly dismayed but, now knowing the reason for her strange behaviour and timetable earlier on, he was nevertheless relieved that Sirius and Buckbeak were both safe and free.\n\nAs a replacement for his lost pet, Sirius sent Ron a tiny owl. Ron, to the surprise of both Harry and Hermione, allowed Crookshanks to sniff the owl. Crookshanks gave his approval, thus confirming that it was in fact just an owl. Ginny immediately named it Pigwidgeon because she thought the name was \"sweet\"; annoyed and disgusted at this, Ron tried to choose another name, but it was too late, so he settled for using the nickname \"Pig\".[4]\n\nFourth year[]\n\nThe Quidditch World Cup[]\n\nIn the summer of 1994, Ron invited Harry and Hermione to accompany the Weasleys to the Quidditch World Cup, which was being held in Britain for the first time in decades. While Hermione joined the Weasleys at The Burrow, Harry had to be picked up from the Dursleys. Arthur Weasley arranged to pick up Harry via Floo Network, not knowing that the Dursleys' fireplace was blocked, so when Ron, Arthur, Fred and George tried to fetch Harry they ended up stuck in the chimney. Part of the Dursleys' house was destroyed before Harry returned to the Weasley's house.[28]\n\nThe following day, Harry, Hermione, and all the Weasleys except Molly Weasley left for the Quidditch World Cup, where they set up camp and met many of their friends from Hogwarts or the Ministry. They had prime seats for the match, thanks to Mr Weasley, who had helped Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of Magical Games and Sports, out of a messy problem. During the match Ron watched Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian Seeker, play an excellent match and catch the Snitch. Even though Krum caught the Snitch the Irish National Quidditch Team still won the match.[28]\n\nThat night, while the Irish supporters were still awake celebrating their victory, trouble began. Some Death Eaters who had managed to avoid imprisonment in Azkaban, attacked the camp where Ron and his friends and family were staying. Mr Weasley ordered Ron, Harry, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny to get to safety, while he and the older Weasley children set off to help the Ministry of Magic. Fred and George were responsible for Ginny's safety, which left the trio to themselves.[28]\n\nRunning off into the woods, Ron, Hermione, and Harry quickly lost Fred, George and Ginny, but they did find Draco Malfoy. Malfoy meanly suggested that Hermione, being a Muggle-Born, could easily be targeted by the Death Eaters, causing Ron to insist that she and Harry join him in going deeper into the woods. Soon they reached a patch of woods giving off a silver glow, where the trio found a few Veela witches surrounded by admirers. Ron was entranced and stated that he would create a broom that would fly to space. They had reached an empty clearing when they heard an unknown person cast the Dark Mark.[28]\n\nBeginning of the year[]\n\nOn 1 September, Ron and his friends departed for Hogwarts aboard the Hogwarts Express. That evening at the Welcoming Feast, Dumbledore announced that Hogwarts would host the Triwizard Tournament. Ron found himself caught up in dreams of being a Triwizard Champion, but he was snapped back to reality by his fourth year classes. In Care of Magical Creatures, Hagrid had his students tending to Blast-Ended Skrewts, and in Defence Against the Dark Arts, Ron was impressed by the new professor, \"Mad-Eye\" Moody, when he taught the class about the three Unforgivable Curses.\n\nIt was announced that the students from the Durmstrang Institute and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic would be arriving at Hogwarts on 30 October. Ron was dumbstruck when he saw Viktor Krum among the Durmstrang students, not realising how young his hero was. He was disappointed when Krum sat among the Slytherin students.[28]\n\nEnvying Harry Potter[]\n\nHaving discussed the possibility of somehow outsmarting the Goblet of Fire and the Age Line that Dumbledore had cast around it, Ron was surprised to find that Harry's name had come out of the Goblet of Fire. Jealous of the fact that Harry always seemed to receive all the attention, Ron refused to accept that Harry didn't put his name in the cup. He even went as far as to accuse Harry of cheating his way into the tournament. After the argument, he and Harry stopped talking to each other, and Ron began hanging out with other Gryffindors like Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan.[28]\n\nWhen Ron heard Harry talking to someone one night, he went down to see who it was since Harry didn't tell him about such a thing. When Harry accused Ron of trying to spy on him and when he told him who he talked to was none of Ron's business, Ron was deeply offended to the point where he tried to get Harry to tell him whom he was talking to by accusing him of practising for an interview. This only made Harry throw one of Draco Malfoy's \"Potter Stinks\" badges at him and tell him he could wear that during the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament. This made Ron finally realise that the reason Harry had started avoiding him was because Harry felt betrayed by him to the point where he had lost Harry's trust and respect and Harry no longer saw him as a friend, a realisation that deeply hurt Ron.[28]\n\nRon and Harry did not talk to each other again until after the First Task. After seeing just how much danger was involved in the task, Ron realised Harry would never have put his own name into the Goblet of Fire, and the two became best friends once again.[28]\n\nThe Yule Ball[]\n\nSoon after the First Task, Professor McGonagall told Ron and the other Gryffindor boys about the traditional Yule Ball, held during the Triwizard Tournament. While all students above fourth year scampered around trying to find dates, Ron and Harry found it hard to ask girls to the ball. Struck by the beauty and charm of Fleur Delacour, the Triwizard Champion from Beauxbatons Academy and a part-Veela witch, Ron asked her to attend the ball with him, but fled in embarrassment without waiting for an answer. He also offended Hermione by not asking her, and then by suggesting that she did not have a date and thus could accompany him.\n\nHarry was eventually able to get them both dates with twins Parvati and Padma Patil. Ron's evening was a fiasco of the first sort. His \"traditional\" dress robes embarrassed him and his date, Padma Patil, and when Ron saw Hermione with Viktor Krum, he became intensely jealous. This led to a blazing argument between them during the end of the ball, with Ron making comments about Krum being too old for her and Hermione accusing him of ruining everything. Though their friendship did not suffer, it was clear that both had developed feelings for each other.[28]\n\nDuring the Yule Ball, Ron had overheard Hagrid telling the Beaubaxtons Headmistress Olympe Maxime that he was half-giant. This information was also overheard by Daily Prophet Reporter Rita Skeeter, who wrote an article telling the wizarding world of Hagrid's heritage. This drove Hagrid to stop teaching for a time until Ron, Harry, and Hermione told him that they he was still their friend, no matter what.[28]\n\nImprisoned by sea creatures[]\n\nOn 24 February, Ron was put into an enchanted sleep and tied up at the bottom of the Black Lake, to be \"rescued\" by Harry as part of the second task of the Triwizard Tournament. When he found out that Harry had stayed behind to save Fleur's sister Gabrielle Delacour as well, Ron jokingly took him to task, but was impressed when Harry was given extra points for \"outstanding moral fibre\".\n\nFleur thanked Ron and Harry in turn for helping save Gabrielle, kissing both of them on the cheek. Ron gained much attention from the other students due to his being taken hostage for the task. He proceeded to exaggerate the events of what happened until Hermione called him on it.[28]\n\nPreparing for the end[]\n\nEarly in the spring, Ron joined Harry and Hermione in visiting Sirius Black, who had taken to hiding in Hogsmeade. There, they discussed the disappearances of Ministry officials Barty Crouch Snr and Bertha Jorkins. In the weeks leading up to the final tournament task, Ron and Hermione helped Harry prepare by researching and trying out different jinxes and other helpful spells for the task. Ron and Hermione watched Harry together from the sidelines.[28]\n\nThey were shocked when Harry returned with Cedric Diggory's dead body. Ron was relieved to see Harry when he was brought to the infirmary by Professor Dumbledore, eagerly wanted to question Harry about Diggory, but he was told off by Molly Weasley who, along with his brother Bill Weasley, had come to watch Harry. Ron was furious with the Minister for Magic, Cornelius Fudge, when he refused to believe Harry and Dumbledore, and calmed Molly when she was shocked by Black's appearance in the room. Ron did not go against Harry's story when he finally heard it, sticking by his best friend.[28]\n\nFifth year[]\n\nAfter Voldemort rose to power and the Second Wizarding War began, Dumbledore reformed the Order of the Phoenix. In the summer of 1995, the Order moved into their headquarters at 12 Grimmauld Place with the Weasley schoolchildren and Hermione Granger, where they helped Molly Weasley clean the old house and remained watchful for information about Harry. In August, Harry arrived at the headquarters after a Dementor attack on his cousin. Ron felt sorry that he had to keep Harry oblivious to the Order's plan and soon learnt that Harry's anger had been growing due to his isolation from his friends and his persecution by the media.[5]\n\nRon, Harry and Hermione stayed at Grimmauld Place throughout August. In late August, Ron and Hermione were made a Gryffindor prefect, for which Molly and Arthur gave Ron a new Cleansweep Eleven. Bound by their prefect duties, Ron and Hermione were separated from Harry on the Hogwarts Express and could only join Harry in his compartment for the last part of the journey. When they arrived, Ron expressed concern that Hagrid was not at the welcoming feast and was suspicious of the new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, Dolores Umbridge.[5]\n\nAt school, Ron was one of the many students who expressed frustration with Professor Umbridge's refusal to teach the class practical defensive magic. He also won the position of Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team but was described by the team captain as \"needing improvement\". Ron's Quidditch practice caused him to fall behind in his schoolwork, to Hermione's chagrin. Soon, Ron's brother Percy Weasley sent him a letter advising him not to remain friends with Harry, whom he accused of being mad for supporting Dumbledore.[5] Ron was outraged by the letter's contents, tearing it into eight pieces and throwing it into the Gryffindor common room's fireplace, angrily declaring his brother to be \"the world's biggest git\".\n\nInitiating Dumbledore's Army[]\n\nLate in September, one evening when Harry returned from detention with Professor Umbridge, Ron, somewhat reluctantly, joined Hermione in convincing that Harry teach his fellow students defence against the dark arts. Harry initially disagreed, but after a few days he decided to give it a go. Around this time, Professor Umbridge was appointed the first Hogwarts High Inquisitor, giving her the power to randomly create new school rules and inspect teachers' lessons.[5]\n\nLate in October, students had their first visit to Hogsmeade. There, Harry, Ron, and Hermione met with several students who were interested in learning proper defence. Ron defended Harry against Zacharias Smith when questions rose, and was among the first to sign the recruitment parchment. On the way home from Hogsmeade, Ron became upset when he learned from Hermione that his sister Ginny was dating Ravenclaw student Michael Corner. The following morning, Ron awoke to find that suddenly, by order of Professor Umbridge, all student groups had been disbanded including the House Quidditch teams, but he was mollified when Harry said they would continue with their secret group, which Ginny named \"Dumbledore's Army\" during their first meeting, mocking the Ministry of Magic's fears of student uprisings.[5]\n\nPlaying Quidditch and Hagrid's tale[]\n\nIn the weeks following the first Dumbledore's Army meeting, Quidditch season arrived. Ron had nervous issues prior to the first match against Slytherin. They had made badges saying \"Weasley is our king\", which Harry decided could not mean anything good. In an attempt to distract Ron from the Slytherins, Hermione kissed him on the cheek for luck, effectively stunning Ron. Ron's play was abysmal, and it was not helped by the Slytherins' new song also entitled, \"Weasley is Our King\". Following the game Ron wanted to resign, but learned he could not, as Harry Potter, Fred, and George Weasley had been banned from Quidditch for life.\n\nThat evening Hagrid returned from his unknown disappearance. Although initially resistant he regaled the trio with his tales of the giants, though he refused to give them any hint about his gruesome injuries from Golgomath's tribe. Ultimately Hagrid's mission was a failure.[5]\n\nFollowing Hagrid's return, he took up his post as Care of Magical Creatures professor. In Hagrid's first lesson, Ron learned about Thestrals, magical creatures that could only be seen by wizards and witches who had witnessed death.[5]\n\nThe attack on Arthur Weasley[]\n\nFrequent Dumbledore's Army meetings, O.W.L. homework, and his prefect duties took up most of Ron's time as the holidays approached. Following the last meeting of the term, Ron was amazed at Harry's \"romantic\" tale, earning him a stern talking to from Hermione who suggested that Ron had \"the emotional range of a teaspoon\". That night, Harry witnessed Ron's father, Arthur Weasley, being attacked by Lord Voldemort's snake, Nagini. When Harry's story was confirmed by Dumbledore and McGonagall, Ron, his siblings, and Harry were immediately sent to the Order's Headquarters, so they could look in on their father's convalescence, and there they spent the Christmas holidays, joined by Hermione the next day.[5]\n\nDuring their first trip to St Mungo's Hospital, Ron overheard \"Mad Eye\" Moody thinking that Harry had been possessed by Voldemort. Ron was worried when Harry became quiet after the visit and wanted to talk to Harry about it. He got his chance after Hermione arrived and convinced Harry to come downstairs. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny told Harry how worried they had been and managed to confess that he was not being possessed. They had an enjoyable holiday, but on their second visit to the hospital, Ron learned the truth about the torture of Neville Longbottom's parents.[5]\n\nThroughout the term, Ron continued to learn defensive and offensive magic from Harry. He also stayed on the Gryffindor Quidditch team, despite his very poor performances. Due to Quidditch, he missed the Valentine's Day visit to Hogsmeade. Though, he was impressed that Harry went public and hopeful that people might believe Harry when The Quibbler came out. Soon, Umbridge managed to sack Professor Trelawney, but her ability to name a replacement was pre-empted when Dumbledore arranged to have Firenze the Centaur teach the subject. Umbridge was affronted by this new staffing appointment.[5]\n\nMarietta Edgecombe's betrayal[]\n\nSoon after Trelawney's sacking, Marietta Edgecombe, a friend of Ravenclaw Student Cho Chang's who only reluctantly joined Dumbledore's Army, told Umbridge about the group, but was unable to give up any pertinent information once she saw a jinx activate on her face. Ron was able to escape when Umbridge, raided the Dumbledore's Army headquarters, but he was incensed when Professor Dumbledore was forced out of the school. He was also wary when his brothers Fred and George Weasley said they were going to do their part for Professor Dumbledore. After Fred and George's secret escape from Hogwarts, Ron was certain that his mother would blame him, but he was saved from this fate when Harry revealed that it was he who financed Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes.[5]\n\nRon played in the final Quidditch match of the season, though Harry and Hermione did not watch, as Hagrid finally revealed the source of his injuries to them. Ron played better, and Gryffindor won the Quidditch Cup. Ron was unable to settle to his studies the following day, but Harry and Hermione brought him down with Hagrid's secret injuries.[5]\n\nBattle of the Department of Mysteries[]\n\nShortly thereafter, their Ordinary Wizarding Level exams were upon them. Ron managed to do very well, but he made a few mistakes. During their final exam, Harry dozed off and had another vision. This time, he saw Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the Ministry. When Harry told Ron and Hermione of this they were wary, and Hermione suggested that Harry try to contact Sirius first. Ron ran off to distract Umbridge, but the plan failed, and Ron and his friends were rounded up and taken to Umbridge's office. There, Ron, Ginny, Neville, and Luna Lovegood managed to fight off Umbridge and her Slytherin Guards and escape to find Harry and Hermione outside the forest.\n\nRon insisted that he join Harry in rescuing Sirius, but also insisted that the rest remain behind, but realised when many Thestrals appeared. When Harry led them into the Department of Mysteries, Ron stuck with him into the deepest recesses of the Department. There, the six Dumbledore's Army members were ambushed by twelve Death Eaters, led by wizarding aristocrat Lucius Malfoy, and Ron helped defend the prophecy Harry took from the Hall of Prophecy, but his fight was soon over as a Death Eater had wiped his brains. Ron was so confused that he summoned a tentacled-brain from a vat in the Thought Chamber and was attacked by it, but soon recovered later on. Ron was devastated by Sirius's death, but made sure that Sirius's death was not discussed around Harry.\n\nSixth year[]\n\nDuring the summer following the battle, Ron learned he had received seven O.W.L.s, only failing Divination and History of Magic. Ron explained he did not mind, as he, like Harry, didn't like those subjects very much, anyway. Also during that summer, Ron learned that his brother Bill was engaged to Fleur Delacour. While this annoyed his mother, sister, and later Hermione, Ron took to defending Fleur and if she surprised him, he would still take on that dumbstruck look. His soft spot for Fleur particularly annoyed Hermione, who was finding it harder to keep her feelings for him under wraps.\n\nWhen Ron and Hermione learned that Harry was in fact the \"Chosen One\", Ron remained at Harry's side.[7] Ron, Hermione, Harry, Ginny, Molly, and Arthur also visited the twins shop Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Ron was impressed with the shop and the twin's flair for business. He attempted to take some products, but was told to put them back after he revealed he had no currency. The trio also followed Draco Malfoy and learned that he wanted something repaired and that he put something else on hold.\n\nA rough start[]\n\nRon would suffer much personal turmoil in his sixth year. Harry was named Gryffindor team captain. Ron was nervous about Quidditch try-outs, but beat out Cormac McLaggen in saves, partly because Hermione cast a Confundus Charm on McLaggen in retaliation for him insulting Ron and Ginny. He was also envious when Harry and Hermione were invited to the Slug Club, while the new Potions professor Horace Slughorn ignored him, and when attention was paid to him, Slughorn usually got his name wrong.\n\nDuring this time, Ron showed brief flashes of jealousy about Harry and Hermione's closeness. He would take exception whenever Hermione complimented Harry on something Ron thought was equally due to him. Ron was temporarily mollified about this when Hermione asked if he would like to attend the club's Christmas party with her, and he agreed, but thought it was only as friends.[7]\n\nRon was also worried over his sister's increasing involvement with boys, and after stumbling upon her kissing Dean Thomas, he blew up at her. In retaliation, Ginny belittled him for his complete inexperience with the opposite gender, declaring that Harry and Hermione had also snogged people. The siblings treated each other coldly afterwards, and Ron was so bothered by this — and by the revelation that Hermione had kissed Viktor Krum almost two years earlier — that he began to perform poorly in Quidditch.\n\nHe also began to treat Hermione with a cold indifference, which confused her. He even offered to resign from the team. To boost his confidence, Harry pretended to pour the Felix Felicis into Ron's Pumpkin juice at breakfast. Harry even allowed Hermione to see the vial, so she would object to the cheating. This convinced Ron that he had an edge in the game, which caused him to play excellently. However, when after the match Harry revealed it was a trick, Ron rounded on Hermione and accused her of having no faith in his abilities.[7]\n\nDating Lavender Brown[]\n\nShortly thereafter, Ron began his exhibitionist relationship with Lavender Brown. Hermione, incredibly angry and hurt by Ron's vindictive actions, conjured a flock of canaries to attack him; the birds scratched Ron badly. Although he did not report this, he spent a long time ranting about her violent and hypocritical act, and he and Hermione stopped talking to each other after that. When Hermione attended the Slug Club's Christmas party, she had originally wanted to attend with Ron but went with his hated rival, Cormac McLaggen, while Ron snogged Lavender in public and made fun of Hermione's behaviour in Transfiguration class, reducing her to tears.[7]\n\nBy Christmas break, however, Ron was becoming disenchanted with his relationship with Lavender, who had become increasingly possessive, annoyed him with the nickname \"Won-Won\", and gave him a gift of a necklace that said \"My Sweetheart\". Hermione did not come to The Burrow for the holidays as she usually did, and Ron made an attempt to speak to her after returning to school, but she ignored him.[7]\n\nPoisoned twice[]\n\nOn 1 March 1997, Ron ate chocolate that he believed to be one of the presents for his 17th birthday, but was in fact a gift from Romilda Vane to Harry spiked with a love potion. He found the box on the floor after Harry had chucked it out of his trunk thinking in was apart of his pile of presents by the foot of his bed. Upon ingesting the chocolate, Ron became maddened with an obsessive need to see and be with Romilda. Harry thinking fast proceeded to take Ron to Slughorn's office to get an antidote. When in Slughorn's office while Harry attempted to get Slughorn in a good mood hoping to get the true memory from him, Ron was nearly killed by poisoned mead intended for Albus Dumbledore. Harry managed to save Ron with a bezoar. The bezoar was one Slughorn had in his kit taken from a previous potions lesson. If it wasn't for Harry's timely actions and quick thinking Ron would have died.[35]\n\nA panic-stricken Hermione arrived at the Hospital Wing, forgetting her anger with him. Ron said Hermione's name in his sleep upon hearing her speak for the first time all day, and the two quietly reconciled after his near-death experience. Ron also took to feigning sleep whenever Lavender tried to visit him. He remained in the hospital the following week and was not able to play Keeper on Saturday 8 March for the Gryffindor vs Hufflepuff Quidditch match.[36]\n\nRe-embracing friends[]\n\nOn Monday 10 March Ron and Harry, who suffered a cracked skull from a mishit Bludger during the match, were able to leave the hospital wing, although Ron did not tell Lavender this.[37] His subsequent avoidance of Lavender and simultaneous spending more time with Hermione made Lavender suspicious; after she spotted him and Hermione leaving the boys' dormitories, seemingly alone (Harry was with them, but under his Cloak of Invisibility), Lavender ended the relationship, much to Ron's relief.\n\nRon also had the idea of using Felix Felicis to retrieve Slughorn's true memory, while he and Hermione were preparing for their Apparition test. A little later, Ron was suitably impressed when Harry told him and Hermione how he managed to obtain the Horcrux memory from Professor Slughorn. A few weeks later, when Harry used Sectumsempra on Draco Malfoy, Ron lent his potions book to Harry, so Professor Snape would not confiscate the Half-Blood Prince's book.[7] Ron did not endorsee what Harry did to Malfoy, but he did not consider it that bad. He took this stance because Malfoy healed okay and did not sustain any lasting damage. Ron also understood why Harry wanted the Half-Blood Prince's book back.\n\nBattle of the Astronomy Tower[]\n\nOn the night of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, Ron took Felix Felicis on Harry's instructions, along with Hermione and Ginny. Those three were joined by Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood, whom Hermione had summoned using the D.A. coins. While Hermione and Luna monitored Professor Snape's office, Ron and the others watched the Room of Requirement. Ron fought in the battle and survived without any major injuries, thanks to the Felix Felicis.\n\nHe was shaken by his oldest brother Bill's scarring at the hands of the vicious werewolf Fenrir Greyback. Shortly afterwards, Ron attended the funeral of Albus Dumbledore, where he comforted a sobbing Hermione. He and Hermione informed Harry of their intention to accompany him on a quest to locate and destroy the Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort, forgoing their seventh year of school.[7]\n\nHorcrux hunt (1997–1998)[]\n\nDuring the summer of 1997, Ron began planning ahead for his mission with Harry and Hermione. With the help of his father and Fred and George Weasley, Ron transfigured the family ghoul to resemble himself sick with spattergroit, which would serve as his alibi for not attending his seventh year of Hogwarts while travelling with his friends.[10] Mrs Weasley was unware of this plan, as she was in denial about the trio's plans to drop out of Hogwarts.\n\nBattle of the Seven Potters[]\n\nIn late July, he participated in the Order's operation to remove Harry from his childhood home, taking Polyjuice Potion to be one of the \"seven Potters.\" He flew with Nymphadora Tonks; they were pursued by at least three Death Eaters during the battle, including Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange. Ron stunned one of the Death Eaters in the face while flying. Ron reassured Hermione by nuzzling her back slightly upon landing as she had been quite worried about him and he was saddened at the death of \"Mad-Eye\" Moody. He was also saddened by the death of Harry's beloved pet owl Hedwig, over which he comforted Harry. Ron became concerned when Harry had a vision of an imprisoned Garrick Ollivander being brutally tortured by Lord Voldemort in the cellar at Malfoy Manor.[10]\n\nOnce Ron, Harry, and Hermione were all convened at The Burrow, they made plans to leave, much to the displeasure of Ron's worried mother. During the preparations for Bill's wedding, Mrs Weasley set Ron, Harry, and Hermione to separate tasks to prevent them from planning. On Harry's seventeenth birthday, Ron gave Harry a copy of Twelve Fail-Safe Ways to Charm Witches. Later that evening, Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour visited The Burrow to dispense the contents of Dumbledore's will. He questioned the trio, and Ron let slip that they had no idea why Dumbledore would bequeath anything to him. Ron received Dumbledore's Deluminator.[10]\n\nEscape from The Burrow[]\n\nThe trio attended the wedding for which, all summer, they had been forced to prepare The Burrow; the marrying couple was Ron's older brother Bill to Fleur Delacour on 1 August. Ron was irked and jealous that Viktor Krum was a guest, especially since he immediately complimented Hermione, who Ron quickly asked to dance shortly afterwards. When Viktor Krum asked who he thought was Barny Weasley (though it was really Harry in disguise) about the pair, he was somewhat disappointed to learn that they were \"sort of\" together, but not officially a couple.[10]\n\nThe celebrations were interrupted with the news that the Ministry of Magic had fallen to Voldemort, and Hermione Disapparated herself, Ron, and Harry away from the danger to Tottenham Court Road. This was the starting point to the trio's adventure and search for the Horcruxes they needed to bring down Lord Voldemort. After they arrived at Luchino café they were ambushed by Death Eaters Antonin Dolohov and Thorfinn Rowle there and a skirmish broke out. After stunning and wiping the memories of the Death Eaters, the trio took refuge in Harry's inherited house 12 Grimmauld Place left to him by Sirius Black.[10]\n\nInfiltration of the Ministry of Magic[]\n\nThere, the trio learned from Kreacher that Regulus Black had stolen the Horcrux Voldemort had made of Slytherin's Locket in 1979, and that it had been stolen from 12 Grimmauld Place by Mundungus Fletcher. Under interrogation, he informed them that the locket was now in the possession of Dolores Umbridge.[10]\n\nWhile they were waiting for Kreacher to fetch Mundungus, they were visited by Remus Lupin. He informed the trio about the goings on in the wider wizarding world. He told them that Harry was now the most wanted wizard in Britain and that Muggle-born witches and wizards were being rounded up. Ron immediately said that he would vouch for Hermione.[10]\n\nThey formulated a plan to infiltrate the Ministry, involving the use of Polyjuice Potion to assume the forms of Ministry employees Reginald Cattermole, Albert Runcorn and Mafalda Hopkirk. Ron, disguised as Reginald Cattermole, quickly found himself forced to separate from his friends, as Death Eater and new head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Yaxley, demanded that \"Cattermole\" fix the rain in his office.[10]\n\nRon was in over his head, but may have found a solution to the problem after asking Arthur, who had no idea of Ron's true identity, for help. The trio reunited after Harry and Hermione stole the locket from Umbridge and freed some Muggle-born witches and wizards being held by the Muggle-Born Registration Commission, and then escaped, but were forced to abandon Grimmauld Place as a hideout. Ron splinched himself during their escape into the countryside and was weakened by his injury. After receiving some treatment from Hermione, Ron fretted over the fate of the Cattermoles.[10]\n\nExit and homecoming[]\n\nAfterward, weeks passed with no further progress. This, as well as the locket's negative influence, caused great tension and animosity amongst the group of friends. When he wore the locket, Ron was sullen and suspicious, lashing out at his friends and continuously complaining. Ron abruptly abandoned his friends one evening after getting into a violent and aggressive fight with Harry over the additional task of locating Godric Gryffindor's Sword in order to destroy the locket. He accused Harry of having no plan and of not being very concerned about Ginny, whom they had learned was punished back at Hogwarts. When Ron asked if Hermione was going with him and she told him that she was staying, he accused her of choosing Harry over him, and left, despite Hermione screaming and crying for him to come back.[10]\n\nAs soon as he was outside the influence of the Horcrux, Ron came to his senses and tried to return. However, he had a run-in with Snatchers first, who interrogated him. Ron claimed to be Stan Shunpike, and then took an opportunity to escape. He apparated numerous times to try to find Harry and Hermione, splinching fingernails off at one point, but could not find them. He then went to stay with Bill and Fleur at their new home, Shell Cottage. Soon after Christmas, Ron used the Deluminator Dumbledore bequeathed him to locate his friends.[10]\n\nRon made his way to the Forest of Dean, where he arrived just in time to rescue Harry from drowning in a semi-frozen pond. When Ron attempted to use Godric Gryffindor's Sword to destroy the locket, horrible incorporeal images of Harry and Hermione came forth which cruelly mocked Ron about his many insecurities, including his fears that Hermione would choose Harry over him. This brought Ron to the point of tears. However, Ron, in a fit of rage, successfully stabbed the Horcrux with Godric Gryffindor's Sword.[10]\n\nAfterwards, Harry took Ron aside to assuage his fears about Harry and Hermione. Saving Harry's life earned Ron Harry's forgiveness, but Hermione — who was unaware of what the Horcrux had done — was still furious with him for his abandonment for some time and attacked him mercilessly upon sight until Harry cast a Shield Charm to stop her.[10]\n\nVisit to the Lovegood House[]\n\nUpon his return, Ron was happy to the point of giddiness, because he thought that they had an ally out there somewhere. He sought to hide this happiness when around Hermione in an act of contrition. When Hermione proposed a trip to the Lovegood's house to investigate a recurring symbol, Ron wholeheartedly agreed. Harry privately accused Ron of only agreeing to get back on Hermione's good side, a fact that he did not deny stating, \"All's fair in love and war, and this is a bit of both.\"[10]\n\nThe trio learned of the existence of the Deathly Hallows from Xenophilius Lovegood. Xenophilius, worried for his daughter Luna, who was being held hostage by Death Eaters, tried to capture the trio. They narrowly escaped, Hermione engineering it in a way that preserved Ron's alibi of being sick at home. While Harry obsessed over the Hallows, Ron and Hermione thought they should focus on finding the Horcruxes, as Dumbledore had instructed them. During Harry's period of listless obsession, Ron's leadership qualities began to show. He suggested that they search many wizarding settlements for clues if only to be in motion and actively searching.[10]\n\nSkirmish at Malfoy Manor[]\n\nDuring the Easter holidays of 1998, the trio was captured by a gang of Snatchers led by Fenrir Greyback after Harry accidentally broke the Taboo on Voldemort's name. Hermione hit Harry in the face with a Stinging Hex in order to disguise him. Harry, Hermione, and Ron quickly lied and gave fake names; Harry being Vernon Dudley, Hermione being Penelope Clearwater, and Ron being Stan Shunpike. Ron was beaten (his mouth extremely bloody) and was then forced to use another name, Barny Weasley. This was due to the Snatchers already knowing who Stan Shunpike was. The Snatchers also found Godric Gryffindor's sword in their tent, there was no explaining that.[10]\n\nThey were then brought to Malfoy Manor, where Lucius Malfoy attempted to get his son to identify Harry. Draco said that he did not know whether it was Harry or not, but immediately recognised Ron and Hermione. The trio then meet with Bellatrix Lestrange, whom separated them. Ron tried to persuade Bellatrix to take him for questioning instead of Hermione. She responded that she would interrogate him next if Hermione died during questioning, as \"blood-traitor was next to mud-blood in her book\". Ron was forced into the dungeon with Harry, Dean Thomas, and the goblin Griphook. In the dungeon they found Luna and Mr Ollivander, whom were captured in 1996.[10]\n\nHermione was kept upstairs and tortured by Bellatrix, her screams reducing Ron to tears. The group was saved by Dobby, who was sent by Aberforth Dumbledore. He freed Harry and Ron to run upstairs to save Hermione, who managed to lie under torture about where they had obtained Gryffindor's Sword. Ron disarmed Bellatrix after she avoided a chandelier dropped by Dobby, and pulled Hermione from the wreckage of the fallen chandelier, Disapparating them both to Bill and Fleur's home Shell Cottage. They stayed there with Luna, Fleur, Bill, Mr Ollivander, and Griphook. He attended the burial of Dobby, where he humbly gave him his shoes and socks.[10]\n\nGringotts break-in[]\n\nAt the cottage Hermione recovered and she, Ron, and Harry planned to break into Gringotts Wizarding Bank in order to take Hufflepuff's Cup, and a Horcrux, within the Lestrange Vault. Griphook the goblin agreed to help them in exchange for Gryffindor's Sword. Ron, knowing that the sword was needed to destroy Horcruxes was reluctant to let Harry part with it. Harry suggested that they delay handing the sword over until the Horcruxes were destroyed. As the planning went forward, Ron along with Harry and Hermione found Griphook to be increasingly distasteful.[10]\n\nOn the morning of 1 May 1998, they broke into Gringotts with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix Lestrange, Ron as a fictional foreign wizard named \"Dragomir Despard\", and Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with Griphook. As they were headed down into the vaults, the Gringotts defences (the Thief's Downfall in particular) were set against them, and Ron's disguise melted away. Once in the vault, it was discovered that all the treasure had Geminio and Flagrante curses put on them. Although they were betrayed by Griphook, the trio obtained Helga Hufflepuff's cup and escaped the wizarding bank on the back of a dragon.[10]\n\nBattle of Hogwarts[]\n\nAfter getting off the dragon escaping from the wizarding bank, Ron saw Harry having one of his visions. He was told that Lord Voldemort finally knew that they were hunting Horcruxes and that the final one was at Hogwarts. Harry, Ron, and Hermione apparated under the invisibility cloak to Hogsmeade looking for a way into Hogwarts. They were soon cornered by Death Eaters set to watch the town. Ron drew his wand ready to fight them, but Harry suggested that advantage lay in stealth and that attacking would give away their position. Once the Death Eaters ordered Dementors to search the town for the trio, Harry was forced to perform the Patronus Charm. After Harry's Patronus chased away the Dementors the trio found refuge in the Hog's Head.[10]\n\nA heated discussion with the proprietor followed, who turned out to be Aberforth Dumbledore. The discussion revolved around Harry's mission and the seeming defeat of the Order of the Phoenix. After this they were lead into Hogwarts by a badly beaten Neville Longbottom, whom in Harry's absence became the de facto leader of the D.A. They arrived in the Room of Requirement and found that the reformed Dumbledore's Army was hiding out there. Harry whom had developed trust issues, did not like the idea of allowing the other DA members to help. Ron persuaded Harry to let the others do so anyway.[10]\n\nWhile Harry searched for Ravenclaw's Diadem, Ron and Hermione entered the Chamber of Secrets to retrieve basilisk fangs. Ron mimicked the Parseltongue he had heard Harry use to open Salazar Slytherin's locket and succeeded in gaining entrance to the Chamber. Hermione used the fangs to destroy the Horcrux of Hufflepuff's Cup, and they then reunited with Harry. When Ron expressed desire to evacuate the house-elves from the Kitchens, Hermione, who had always been concerned for creatures so often mistreated by society, was so touched that she ran, nuzzled and kissed him, much to Ron's delight. However, their kiss was interrupted by Harry, who pointed out that there was a war going on and that they could carry on later, to which Ron pointed out there might not be later.[10]\n\nHarry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Room of Requirement to find Ravenclaw's diadem, but were ambushed by Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. When Crabbe unleashed a cursed fire, the trio escaped by means of broomsticks; Harry saved Draco, and Ron and Hermione saved Goyle. They then witnessed the death of Ron's brother Fred in combat, which devastated Ron, who wanted revenge. Hermione managed to calm him by reminding him that they would have to fight on their way to finding Nagini, Voldemort's final Horcrux. The trio made their way to the Shrieking Shack, and witnessed the snake kill Severus Snape on Voldemort's orders. While dying, Severus Snape's memories leaked out of him, which Harry collected into a glass phial to latter view in the headmaster's office.[10]\n\nDuring the pause in the Battle of Hogwarts, Ron went to the Great Hall, where Bill comforted him over Fred's death and Hermione comforted Ginny. Harry went up to Dumbledore's office and emptied Snape's memories into the Pensieve. He entered the Pensieve and finally learned the truth of it all. After emerging from the Pensieve, he made use of the distraction to slip out and confront Voldemort. Following his alleged death, the battle resumed, and Ron and Neville Longbottom brought Fenrir Greyback down together. Ron witnessed Harry defeat Lord Voldemort once and for all, and survived the battle without serious injury.[10]\n\nAfter Hogwarts (1998–2014)[]\n\nRon never received a seventh year of education at Hogwarts. Instead of completing his education, he moved on to become an Auror (along with Harry) at the Ministry of Magic, where he helped track down and capture those of Lord Voldemort's supporters that had gone into hiding, or else feigned innocence or ignorance whilst having actually cooperated and willingly supported his regime.[27] Two years after he started at the Auror Office, he left to help his brother George at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes in Diagon Alley, although he retained strong ties in the Ministry, and their work revolutionised both the Auror department and the institution at large, and along with Hermione, the trio helped \"make a new world\" for the wizarding community.[38]\n\nDuring the trial of Dolores Umbridge shortly after the war, Umbridge managed to escape and ally with some Death Eaters (Corban Yaxley, the Carrows, and Walden Macnair). Together, they planned a plot involving Time-Turnere to bring back the dictatorship that had existed in the British Ministry of Magic from 1997–1998. They were stopped, however, by Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter.[39]\n\nHis decision to do so was questioned by Rita Skeeter, who thought that Ron was tired of standing in Harry's shadow, and wrote in her gossip column that Ron was likely mentally ill (this must, of course, be taken with more than a small pinch of salt due to Rita's habit of writing scathing lies in articles), having said himself that the Horcrux hunt had \"took its toll\" on him.[25]\n\nSometime between 1998 and 2006, Ron married Hermione, and later the couple had two children: Rose and Hugo. Ron was also the godfather and uncle of Harry and Ginny's oldest son. At some point, Ron, Harry, and Hermione were all featured on Chocolate Frog Cards for their accomplishments, which Ron considered his \"finest hour\".[40]\n\nRon himself noted that he and Hermione were quite young when they were married and that he became rather drunk afterward, having very little memory of the night after the ceremony.[41]\n\nOn 31 October 2009, Ron came back to Hogwarts to bring his Deluminator to Headmistress McGonagall so she could take another look at it. On the way there, he travelled past London and used the Deluminator to collect the lights of half a street. When he arrived, he happened to be attracted to Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington's Deathday Party, where he talked to an unidentified student and showed them the Deluminator. When Peeves caused the lights in the party hall to go out, Ron encouraged the student to use the Deluminator to restore the lights.[42]\n\nSeeing the ghosts at the party also inspired Ron to develop with George a banquet platter that looked and smelled bad (which might be appealing to ghosts) but tasted fresh when taken off of the plates. Several days later, he met the unidentified student again at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, and they talked about the ghosts as well as the unfinished banquet platter.[43]\n\nDuring the 2010–2011 school year, Ron came back again to his alma mater to join the defence force against Dementors and other Dark creatures when they attempted to attack the castle. He was seen putting up and reinforcing the spherical shield around the castle with students and staff, and he also participated in the big battle that ended the attacks. He discussed with Harry, Hermione and the staff about the cause of the attacks afterwards, and when Harry said he had an idea, Ron guessed that he meant the Death Eaters, though it was not what Harry had in mind.[44]\n\nRon was looking after Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes one day when the unidentified student visited again, and he introduced several products to them such as the Wildfire Whiz-bangs, trick wands and Skiving Snackboxes and told stories about them. For the last one, he showed them the Canary Cream, and they both ate it and briefly turned into canaries. The student asked if there were other flavours of it, and Ron took it to be a good advice to develop more flavours to mix into other food or tempt others into eating, joking that he would eat a drumstick-flavoured biscuit at once.[45]\n\nAnother time, Ron and George followed the student into Zonko's Joke Shop while debating about whether old joke products could still become a big sale. The student recognised them, and Ron argued that products like Dungbombs were classics for a reason, and if Zonko's was able to sell them well, so could they. George demanded evidence from him, and the student suggested they learn from their customers about their preferences. The brothers then started a fight that involved different kinds of pranks to determine what people liked more.[46] After George invited Harry with selling the products, Ron became upset and invited Hermione, who was unable to decline.[47] At the end, George asked Ron to summarise the results of the questionnaires, but neither of them kept record. Ron wondered how they could know the winner, and felt it would be better if Fred was there, who he believed was more thoughtful and quick to action, though George reckoned both of them were better at those than Ron. They reminisced about Fred, and were joined by the student's friends.[48]\n\nLater life (2014–)[]\n\n2014 Quidditch World Cup[]\n\nRon, Hermione and their children Rose and Hugo all attended the final of the 427th Quidditch World Cup in the Patagonian Desert in July 2014, alongside Harry, Ginny, James, Albus, Teddy Lupin, Neville, Hannah, Luna, Rolf, Bill, Fleur, Victoire, and potentially others.[25] Ron also became close with Harry's children, one of whom, James, was his godson. Lily Luna Potter and Ron's son were close in age and good friends, as were Ron's daughter and Albus Severus Potter.\n\nSeeing off his daughter[]\n\nIn August of 2017, Ron, having settled into a rotund middle age, obtained a Muggle driving licence. He also admitted putting a Confundus Charm on the Muggle driving inspector because he had forgotten to use his wing mirror properly, excusing this mistake because casting a Supersensory Charm would be more effective. That year, he and Hermione sent their daughter off for her first year at Hogwarts, and Ron encouraged Rose to be Sorted into Gryffindor House and to beat Scorpius Malfoy in marks. He hugged Hugo gently.[49]\n\nAs the train faded away, Ron remembered his time at Hogwarts and how he would love to be going back. At a gathering with Hermione, Harry and Ginny, they talked about the meeting and Ron attempted to cheer everyone up by making jokes which led them them telling him to stop. Before the start of the new school year, Ron and Hermione told Rose to try and befriend Albus again since they have drifted apart since starting Hogwarts.[49]\n\nFighting Delphini[]\n\nA while later, Ron attended a meeting at the Ministry of Magic. Hermione was worried about how Harry was having nightmares and his scar was hurting again. Ron got into an argument with Draco Malfoy.\n\nWhen Albus and Scorpius meddled with time, they changed Ron's life. In one alternate reality, Ron helped Harry and Ginny find Albus. Ron never married Hermione and instead married Padma Patil. In another alternate reality where Voldemort won, Ron was in hiding with Hermione as a member of what remained of Dumbledore's Army. They were visited by Severus Snape and Scorpius who told them about the original timeline where they won. Ron agreed to help correct time by time-travelling to the moments where Albus and Scorpius changed time and use a Shield Charm to stop them.\n\nHowever, when they stopped them the first time, they returned to a present that hadn't changed much. They were attacked by Dementors and Ron and Hermione sacrifice their souls after professing their love for each other to give Scorpius time to escape. Their sacrifice, combined with Snape's a short time later, allowed Scorpius to return to the Second Task and set things right completely.\n\nWhen the original timeline was restored, Ron was asked to attend a meeting with Professor McGonagall to talk about what happened. He turned up late having somehow ended up in the kitchens instead. Ron, Hermione, Harry, Ginny and Draco were very forgiving of Albus and Scorpius so McGonagall reminded them of the great dangers of what they had done.\n\nAlbus and Scorpius were kidnapped by Delphi and made to time-travel to 31 October, 1981. Ron went with Hermione, Harry, Ginny, and Draco to the past to save them and stop Delphi. However, under Ginny's prodding, they realised that Delphi did not to want to kill baby Harry, but rather to stop Voldemort from doing so in the hope he would live and his reign would continue. Delphi thought she could make her father stronger as he would know love when he met her, which its lacking was what had originally led to his downfall. Ron helped Harry duel Delphi and they apprehended her. Ron then returned to the present where Delphi was sent to Azkaban.\n\nThe Calamity[]\n\nDuring the Calamity, Ron would assist the members of the Statute of Secrecy Task Force who pursued a Professor profession when he ran into them in the Leaky Cauldron by debating on defensive footwork during duelling, causing them to gain increased resilience. Constance Pickering also talked Ron into hosting an informal lesson on evading enemy attacks for Task Force members who pursued an Auror profession, highlighting the advantages of supplementing defensive spells with evasive manoeuvres, such as side-steps and rolls.[50]\n\nRon later visited a pub with a Calamity Investigator working for the Task Force. The bartender, pleased that the Calamity Investigator had brought a \"celebrity\" into his pub, pulled them aside and gave them a secret phrase they could use to order off-the-menu pints and other items. Ron later oversaw a Wizard's Chess tournament attended by the same Calamity Investigator. Ron's commentary at the event was described as \"boisterous and colourful,\" allowing the Calamity Investigator to learn how to better focus on strategy despite considerable distraction.[50]\n\nIn the spring of 2021, The Unforgivable threatened Harry and Hermione after the two began wrenching control of Calamity surges away from the cabal. The two feared that their children would be targeted, but Harry insisted on continuing to fight against the Unforgivable. Harry redirected a Calamity surge and controlled it using memories of the Marauders. By April, Ginny had been attacked and Ronald had been abducted.[51]\n\nPhysical description[]\n\nRon inherited the typical Weasley family traits: fiery red hair and a freckled complexion. When he became embarrassed, his ears notably turned red. He had blue eyes, a long nose, and was described as being very tall and lanky, with big hands and feet.[11] In this way, his stature was similar to those of his older brothers Bill and Percy, rather than the heavily built Charlie, and Fred and George.[1]\n\nHis sister Ginny once joked to the trio that Ron had a Pygmy Puff tattoo,[7] though it is doubtful that the remark had any truth in it.\n\nBy 2014, when he was at the age of 34, Rita Skeeter remarked on a Daily Prophet gossip column that his \"famous ginger hair appears to be thinning slightly\".[25]\n\nBy 2017, Ron had settled into a round middle age[52] and was later described to be getting \"a bit of a gut\" by his nephew, yet hiding it extremely well.[53]\n\nHe had scars from the brains which attacked him in the Thought Room in the Battle of the Department of Mysteries.[54]\n\nPersonality and traits[]\n\nRon was a very loyal, brave, strong and humourous person, but sometimes immature, and insensitive.[55] He had a sardonic, wisecracking sense of humour that often brought his friends laughter and relaxation. However, as Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood pointed out, his humour could occasionally be hurtful, even if unintentionally.[7] During his time searching for Voldemort's Horcruxes with Harry and Hermione, Ron matured greatly, and even took to leading the trio when Harry temporarily fell into a depressive mood.[10]\n\nThough his loyalty and bravery never faltered Ron's character was also marked by occasional jealousy and insecurity rising from feeling overshadowed by his five older brothers and his parents' constant comparisons between him and their other children. He could be argumentative, a trait particularly displayed in his bickering with the equally argumentative and occasionally highly critical Hermione. Though their bickering was frequent, it was never malicious (with the brief exception of sixth year) and generally a way to hide their deeper feelings for each other.\n\nInheriting the Weasley trait of a strong temper Ron was not above provocation especially when dealing with the spiteful treatment of Professor Snape and the bigotry and hatred of Draco Malfoy. Always willing to stand up for his friends and family even when angry with them, Ron never stopped standing up for Hermione when she faced Muggle-born related prejudice and hatred. He also stood by Harry's side when he was met with disbelief and scorn from his classmates and Wizard society in general. Ron frequently demonstrated great bravery in attempting to protect those he loved, from facing his arachnophobia to stand by Harry in his second year[29] to trying to take Hermione's place when Bellatrix Lestrange isolated her for interrogation with the Cruciatus Curse.[10]\n\nAs a boy, Ron was very sensitive about his family's poverty, and sometimes embarrassed by them. Many, if not all, of Ron's possessions were hand-me-downs, including his robes, school books, wand, and even a pet rat whom he called Scabbers. His family's lack of finances often made Ron a target for taunting by Draco Malfoy, a spoiled, arrogant Slytherin.[11] Ron was also prone to insecurity about his abilities, when compared to his older siblings and to his famous best friend. When he felt insecure or embarrassed, it was noted that his ears turned red. This became his tell-tale sign of his anger and embarrassment.[28] He felt as if he was consistently overshadowed by the legacy of his older brothers and the fame of Harry; this lead to a feeling of being \"second-best\".\n\nAlthough passionate about Quidditch, especially the Chudley Cannons, and a fine flyer, Ron had a problem with nerves, and sometimes his playing ability suffered for it.[5] Salazar Slytherin's Locket revealed that Ron's deepest fears were that his mother loved him least and that Hermione preferred Harry to him.[10] He also suffered from arachnophobia, a fear originating from his brother Fred transfiguring his teddy bear into a spider when Ron was a child.[29]\n\nRon's point of view on many topics was often that of the stereotypical wizard, which clashed many times with those of Harry and Hermione because they were both raised by Muggles; but in exchange, he was typically more aware of standard factors abided by wizardkind. Examples of this are that while he liked Lupin the entire third year, the moment he discovered that Lupin was a werewolf he exclaimed \"Get away from me, werewolf!\"; that he was more shocked and disgusted than Harry and Hermione at discovering that Hagrid was half giant; and when he got into an argument with Griphook over wizards not giving goblins wands. However, he was clearly very much appreciative of Dobby's sacrifice for them, as he helped Harry dig the grave, found it difficult to say stuff at the grave (it is mentioned it \"came out thickly\", implying he was choked up), and he had sat on a rock and stripped off his shoes and socks, giving them to Dobby to be buried in.\n\nRon was particularly fond of food. He had a tendency to talk with his mouth full, often to Hermione's disgust, and a great fondness for bacon sandwiches, though he disliked corned beef sandwiches, as mentioned in his first year; his love of food eventually made him settle into a portly middle age. And like Harry, Ron was intelligent, but lacked the motivation to put forth effort in class due to incredible laziness; during their years at school, Ron frequently expected Hermione's help, and when she either refused or was unavailable, he was often dumbfounded about how to proceed. If not for Hermione's help, he would have undoubtedly failed his exams.\n\nRon was also shown to have a habit of swearing. In 1993, he called Professor Snape something that caused Hermione to exclaim: \"Ron!\". Also, after Draco Malfoy insulted him, Ron told him to do something he would never have dared say in front of Mrs Weasley. He also called Draco Malfoy a \"two face-bastard\" during the Battle of Hogwarts after saving him from a Death Eater, and rescuing him for a second time, from death.\n\nRon was brave, to a level which would put him on a par with his best friend Harry; he never hesitated to put himself into extremely dangerous situations with his best friends Harry and Hermione, and as shown many times, he would rather die than have someone else he cared about be harmed. He risked his life on many occasions, and his bravery was not unnoticed by his friends.\n\nRon was also quite pragmatic and, despite his occasionally fierce temper, was usually able to keep a more level head in stressful situations compared with Harry and Hermione. His pragmatism was demonstrated by his defence of Bartemius Crouch Senior's harsh treatment of his house elf Winky, with Ron stating that Winky liked being told what to do by Crouch to the point that she held a seat for him despite her acrophobia and that this was because she wasn't human and as such didn't think like one.[56] Another example of Ron's pragmatic nature was when he discovered the truth about Albus Dumbledore's past with Gellert Grindelwald as while Harry was disgusted by Dumbledore's past desires to rule over Muggles alongside Grindelwald and Dumbledore's secrecy over this, and even Hermione expressed huge shock over this, Ron simply stated that Dumbledore was still growing up at that age and changed as he got older.[57] However, Ron's pragmatism occasionally made him naïve and insensitive, as while he believed that Winky liked being told what to do and acknowledged that she wasn't human, he was ignorant to Winky's acrophobia and her emotional distress once she was sacked by Crouch Senior.[56]\n\nRon was also a person who liked to do things the easy way, as he did not like to work hard. This quality was reflected in his first year when he just picked up books from the Hogwarts Library shelves randomly when finding out about Nicolas Flamel. He also had a tendency to make up predictions for his Divination homework, and frequently copied most of his homework from Hermione Granger. However, he could afford to let go of this tendency of his during tougher times, like when he researched information to help Hagrid in letting off Buckbeak in his third year. His peculiar trait did not seem to vanish, even after he grew up, as he confunded his driving examiner (breaking the International Statute of Secrecy which is considered illegal) and shrugged off his guilt by saying \"I could always use a Supersensory Charm for that\".\n\nRon was very protective of those he cared about, and this was shown perhaps, best of all, when Ginny was involved in a relationship with Dean Thomas. He was, of course, looking out for her, but his temper got the best of him and he lashed out at her, as she did the same to him.\n\nMagical abilities and skills[]\n\nRon was often insecure about his own abilities, when compared to his elder brothers and famous best friend. However, once that lessened he proved to be a powerful wizard in his own right. Ron was able to conjure a corporeal Jack Russell terrier Patronus, a mark of superior magical ability.\n\nCharms: Ron was rather good at this field, being able to cast the Levitation Charm successfully in his first year,[11] and receiving an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam in the subject, allowing him to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.[7] He was also known to be able to proficiently cast the Patronus Charm by his fifth year, the latter of which is noted to be extremely advanced and powerful magic not usually taught on the Hogwarts Curriculum.[5] His Patronus assumed the corporeal form of a Jack Russell terrier.[24] He could also successfully cast many simple charms such as the Fire-Making Spell,[58] Cheering Charm, Wand-Lighting Charm, Boggart-Banishing Spell,[4] seize and pull charm,[59] Summoning Charm,[28] Banishing Charm,[59] Impervius Charm,[4] Severing Charm,[28] Unlocking Charm,[59] Locking Spell[5] and various others. He was also very skilled with Defensive Charms such as the Disarming Charm and Stunning Spell.[29][5][10] Furthermore, he claimed to be able to perform the Supersensory Charm and Confundus Charm in his adult years.[49]\n\nPotions: Although Ron had disliked the subject just as much as Harry due to Severus Snape and frequently achieved poor marks that were among the worst in his class as a result, when Snape was not around, he proved to be surprisingly talented and proficient in the field, as he was able to achieve an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade on his O.W.L. exam and was one of only twelve students able to go on to N.E.W.T.-level in 1996.[7] After becoming an Auror, it is safe to assume that Ron had became at least sufficiently adept in poisons and antidotes considering it was deemed to be essential as an Auror.[5]\n\nWizard's Chess: Ron was extremely talented at chess. It was he who taught Harry how to play. Ron and Harry often played Wizard's Chess together when they had free time.[60] In his first year, his logistic ability helped him, Hermione, and Harry play past Professor McGonagall's magically Transfigured giant chessboard to get to the Philosopher's Stone and prevent it being stolen by Voldemort. As a result, he got fifty points for his house for \"the best played game of chess that Hogwarts has seen these many years\", as Dumbledore himself noted.[11]\n\nDuelling: Ron was more than capable in battle; it is notable that he survived both the Battle of the Department of Mysteries[5] and the Battle of the Astronomy Tower[7] and fought very courageously in both. He fought well in the Battle of the Seven Potters, stunning a Death Eater while flying. This was seen as such a noticeable feat that Tonks stated that she couldn't believe it and that it was a very hard thing to do. Ron also disarmed Bellatrix Lestrange, and saved Hermione during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor. Later he took down Fenrir Greyback with Neville Longbottom and defeated several other Death Eaters during the Battle of Hogwarts. He also escaped a group of Snatchers, unharmed after he temporarily left the Horcrux hunt.[10] It should also be noted that Ron had a physical approach to fighting as well as magical, as more than one occasion, he resorted to fighting physically rather than magically especially in his earlier years. He advised Harry to punch Draco Malfoy if his wand did not work during his first year as well as fight him with Neville during a Quidditch match.[11] He took this trait to his later years when he wrestled with Wormtail at Malfoy Manor and punched Draco after saving his life a second time during the Battle of Hogwarts.[10] When Ron became an Auror, his skills greatly improved as he was able to track down and defeat multiple Death Eaters after the Battle of Hogwarts. He was also shown to help in overpowering Delphini when she tried to go back in time to stop Voldemort from killing Harry when he was a baby.\n\nDefence Against the Dark Arts: Ron was very skilled in this subject as, in 1996, he managed to achieve an 'Exceeds Expectations' grade on his O.W.L. exam which allowed him to study it further at N.E.W.T. level.[7] He was able to successfully use various defensive spells, such as Boggart-Banishing Spell which he mastered in his third year.[4] Ron was also the co founder of Dumbledore's Army and mastered all the defensive and offensive spells that Harry taught. Ron participated in several battles against the Death Eaters (dangerous and powerful Dark wizards) during the Second Wizarding War, which all he fought vigorously and skilfully in, and survived all of them, showing his highly impressive defensive abilities.[5][7][10] When he became an Auror his defensive and offensive magic greatly improved as he was constantly put up against fighting the Dark Arts.\n\nDark Arts: Ron was shown to be rather good with dark magic, as he was able to successfully cast many dark charms successfully. He was able to successfully cast the Slug-vomiting Charm in an attempt to curse Draco Malfoy in his second year (although the curse backfired upon himself due his broken wand at that point).[29] Other dark charms Ron mastered were the Knockback Jinx,[59] Impediment Jinx,[28] Melofors Jinx,[61] Revulsion Jinx,[10] Tickling Hex,[62] Full Body-Bind Curse,[10] Leg-Locker Curse[11] and Reductor Curse.[5]\n\nApparition: Despite not achieving a licence in his sixth year,[7] Ron was still able to Apparate during the hunt for the Horcruxes, though he did splinch himself on occasion.[10]\n\nTransfiguration: Ron advanced to N.E.W.T.-level and achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam, showing aptitude in the subject.[7] He was also able to cast Transforming Spells successfully, including the Avifors Spell and Lapifors Spell.[61] As an Auror, Ron's skills likely improved as being sufficiently skilled in transfiguring and untransfiguring was essential to the job. He was capable of helping in turning Harry into a doppelganger of Voldemort, further showing he had increased his skills in the field.\n\nHerbology: Ron achieved an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. exam. He attended N.E.W.T.-level Herbology in his sixth year.[7] He could also cast Herbology related charms such as the Fire-Making Spell[58] and the Herbivicus Charm.[61]\n\nDivination: Like Harry, Ron disliked Professor Sybill Trelawney's Divination class, but unlike Harry, who entirely lacked ability in the subject, Ron apparently had some innate skill in Divination as he did make at least two accurate predictions. In his first attempt at reading tea leaves, he predicted that Harry would receive \"a windfall, unexpected gold\".[4] Harry received unexpected gold the following year (by winning the Triwizard Tournament after Barty Crouch Jnr secretly submitted his name). He later inherited gold from his godfather, Sirius Black, after the death of Sirius. Ron also saw \"a blob a bit like a bowler hat\" among the tea leaves. Cornelius Fudge had a bowler hat when he met with Dumbledore and Harry after Voldemort's re-birth, and refused to believe Harry's story about the incident.[28]\n\nNonverbal magic: Ron was able to stun a man who attempted to attack Hermione in 1998 without saying the incantation, which is highly advanced magic.[10] He is also noted to have been able to achieve this at a young age as demonstrated in his second year when he attempted to \"curse\" Draco when he insulted Hermione. The curse worked without him saying the incantation, even though it backfired due to him using a broken wand.[29]\n\nAstronomy: Ron earned on O.W.L. in this subject.[7] It is unknown if he was able to continue on to the N.E.W.T. class, seeing as he did not apply for advancement.\n\nCare of Magical Creatures: Ron got an 'Exceeds Expectations' on his O.W.L. in the subject.[7] He showed talent in handling dangerous creatures like his brother Charlie Weasley.\n\nFlying: Like his brothers, Ron was good at flying. He was good enough to be on the Gryffindor Quidditch team and he flew successfully during the Battle of the Seven Potters. Ron was a reasonably good Keeper for the team, however his performance sometimes suffered due to his lack of confidence, but overall he was a highly talented broomstick flyer and Quidditch player.\n\nTactical thinking: Ron was good with tactical thinking and showed a talent for thinking outside of the box. For example, he suggested that Harry use Felix Felicis to try to get Horace Slughorn's memory of telling Tom Riddle about the Horcruxes,[7] and it was Ron's idea to go to the Chamber of Secrets in order to get Basilisk fangs to destroy the Horcruxes.[10] Ron was also able to keep a level head in highly stressful situations, and was generally more pragmatic than either of his best friends. His knack for strategy allowed him to consistently outclass his peers in both combat and strategy games such as Wizards Chess. His tactical mindset allowed him to recognise Quidditch plays and strategies almost instantly, which is an impressive feat, given that Quidditch is a sport with a three-dimensional playing field.\n\nImpersonation: Ron was clever at imitating voices. While at Malfoy Manor, he was able to convincingly imitate Peter Pettigrew to avoid arousing the suspicions of Bellatrix and the Malfoys. He was also able to mimic Parseltongue effectively, which is a rather difficult language to learn or even imitate, enough to open the Chamber of Secrets after previously hearing Harry do it.\n\nLeadership skills: While it was mostly Harry or Hermione who did the leading, Ron also had relatively good leadership skills as he took charge of the Wizard's Chess obstacle during their search for the Philosopher's Stone and ordered Harry and Hermione to continue searching for it when he decided to become a sacrifice in the end. He later formed and co-led Dumbledore's Army alongside Harry and Hermione, and temporarily led their Horcrux hunt when Harry briefly fell into depression over his obsession for the Deathly Hallows. After the war ended, his leadership skills were again shown when he, Harry and Hermione helped to reform the Auror department and Ministry of Magic, and help reduce the prejudice towards non-pure bloods and other underprivileged magical creatures, and when he ran Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes afterwards alongside George Weasley.\n\nBusiness: As Ron co-owned Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes along with his brother George after leaving his profession as an Auror, he likely developed good business skills as he helped turn the business into a big \"money-spinner\" and helped George run it after Fred's death.\n\nPossessions[]\n\nRon's first wand (formerly Charlie Weasley's): Ron initially used his brother Charlie's old, chipped wand, made of ash with a unicorn hair sticking out of the end. He held the wand together with Spellotape after nearly breaking it in half at the start of his second year, but it malfunctioned dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises, and emitting objects out from the wrong end. It eventually exploded when Gilderoy Lockhart tried to cast a Memory Charm with it on Ron and Harry in the Chamber of Secrets.[29]\n\nRon's second wand (first own wand): Before his third year, he received a wand, fourteen inches, willow and unicorn hair. This wand seemed to suit him better, but he lost it at Malfoy Manor in 1998 and it is questionable whether he ever retrieved it.[4]\n\nRon's third wand (formerly Peter Pettigrew's): Ron took this wand from Peter Pettigrew during the Skirmish at Malfoy Manor and used it from then on; it was made of chestnut, long 9¼ inches and had a Dragon heartstring core.[10] It is unknown whether he ever recovered his own wand or kept using Pettigrew's.\n\nScabbers: Ron inherited Scabbers from Percy, who was gifted of an owl (Hermes) by his father in 1991 for becoming a Prefect.[11] It was an old, grey rat which missed a toe. Scabbers was already very old when Ron got it, and even if Ron complained about it all the time, saying that Scabbers was useless, he got angry when it seemed that Crookshanks ate the rat. At the end of Ron's third year, it turned out that Scabbers was actually the unregistered Animagus Peter Pettigrew, who was believed to have died in 1981.[4]\n\nPigwidgeon: Ron's first pet owl he was gifted to him from Sirius Black in June 1994, when Sirius used the owl to carry a letter to Harry. Black said that Ron might keep the owl as he didn't have a rat anymore. Pigwidgeon was described by Harry as resembling a \"fluffy snitch\". Though Ron acted very rude to Pigwidgeon in public, he was actually very attached to Pig, since this was his first owl. The name was chosen by Ginny Weasley, but Ron thought it was \"a stupid name\" and tried to change it; it was too late however, and the owl wouldn't respond to anything else.[63]\n\nCleansweep Eleven: In the summer of 1995, Ronald Weasley was given a Cleansweep Eleven as a present from his parents for becoming a Prefect, and used it when he played as Keeper for the Gryffindor Quidditch team.\n\nShooting Star: Ron had a Shooting Star when he was young.\n\nWeasley jumpers: As every other member of the Weasley family, Ron got from his mother a home-made jumper with a \"R\", his first initial, as a Christmas gift every year. On Christmas 1991 he complained about his jumpers being \"always maroon\".[60]\n\nDress robes: Ron wore a set of dress robes to the Yule Ball in 1994. They were very traditional in style, and thus old-fashioned and frilly, much to Ron's distaste. Ron also owns a second set of dress robes, a present from the twins in the summer break of 1995. These robes were bought with some of Harry's Triwizard winnings, as a stipulation of him giving the money to Fred and George. These robes were only mentioned, never described.\n\nSweetheart necklace: Ron received the necklace from Lavender Brown as a Christmas present in 1996, though it is unlikely that he kept it following their break up.\n\nPrefect badge: Just like all of his brothers except the twins, Ron became a Prefect during his fifth year, and received his badge in the summer of 1995.[5]\n\nThe Adventures of Martin Miggs, the Mad Muggle: In his youth, Ron was an avid reader of this comic, and he kept a large stack of issues in his bedroom.[64]\n\nChudley Cannons' posters: Ron was a supporter of the Chudley Cannons and he put posters of the team everywhere in his bedroom.\n\nSpello-tape: Ron used Spellotape to hold together his first wand after nearly breaking it in half at the start of his second year, but it malfunctioned dreadfully after this, backfiring spells, making strange noises and emitting objects from the wrong end. He borrowed the tape from Seamus Finnigan.[29]\n\nDeluminator: Ron inherited the Deluminator from Dumbledore's will, which helped him during his Horcrux mission to \"illuminate the darkness\".[10]\n\nWatch: He received a golden wristwatch on his 17th birthday from his parents.\n\nChocolate Frog Cards: Ron had about five hundred chocolate frog cards in 1991, including six cards of Morgana and probably at least one of Albus Dumbledore, but none of Agrippa nor Ptolemy.[65] Supposedly, in his adulthood, he owned his own card, which he was extremely proud of.[40]\n\nWizard's Chess Set: Ron had a battered old Wizard's Chess set in 1991. Like most other things he had, it was secondhand, being passed down to him by his grandfather — it was left unsaid whether it was Septimus Weasley's or his Prewett grandfather's. However, his chessmen were therefore more likely to trust his judgement in battle.[60]\n\nCar (supposedly): Ron mentioned having parked this car near King's Cross on September 1st, 2017, when he carried his family to the Platform Nine and Three-Quarters. It is however left unclear if the car was Ron's or Hermione's. He said that the Supersensory Charm could be used for parking, so he probably charmed the car with that.[49]\n\nMuggle driving licence: On September 1st, 2017, Ron mentioned having obtained the Muggle driving licence, even if Hermione, according to him, didn't believe that he could pass the exam without Confunding the examiner. (As a matter of fact, however, Ron admitted having Confunded the examiner, because he forgot to look in the wing mirror).[49]\n\nRelationships[]\n\nFamily[]\n\nWeasley family[]\n\nRon was quite close with his family. Although he was sometimes embarrassed by their lack of money, Ron was fiercely protective of his siblings, and always stoutly defended his parents. He was outraged when his brother Percy called their father a failure and greatly upset their mother with his estrangement, as Ron was close to both of his parents.[5]\n\nRon looked up to his older brothers Bill and Charlie, though their accomplishments also made him feel insecure about what he had to live up to.[11] Percy tried to be a role model for Ron, but Ron considered him rather pompous and annoying, and took after Fred and George more in terms of personality. Notably, Ron was the only family member Percy contacted after his estrangement from his family, congratulating Ron on becoming a prefect and advising him to cut ties with Harry, even though Ron was further disgusted by Percy's estrangement.[5] Once he reconciled with his family, Percy was also the one who comforted Ron over Fred's death during the"
