        "text": "SPRING 2019 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 020J H1 THE EARTH SYSTEM\n\nProfessor Christa Farmer, Geology\n\nMF 11:15-12:40PM\n\nCRN: 24632\n\nBROWR 0202\n\nOur planet operates in interlocking systems, each of which contains feedback cycles that influence each other. Students in this course will investigate the solid, fluid, and living systems of planet Earth, and how they interact with each other to keep the planet in a stable condition. We will also investigate how humans are perturbing the systems through sparking a loss of biodiversity, tipping the scales of climate change, and augmenting the Nitrogen cycle, among many other impacts. Course goals include learning how to quantify measurements of these various systems, through solving problem sets; refining communication skills, through written and oral debates; and utilizing library resources to find cutting-edge scientific knowledge of the Earth's systems.\n\n(The chair of the geology and sustainability department has indicated this course may, with permission, be counted as a geology or sustainability elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors. The chair of the geography and global studies department has indicated this course may be counted as a topical elective toward the major or minor in geography.)\n\nHUHC 020K (H1) FANTASTIC LITERATURE AND ITS MAGICAL OBJECTS\n\nProfessor David Powell, Romance Language and Literature\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 25092\n\nBRESL 029\n\nBeyond the compact structure of the short story – we will study only short stories – , the fantastic genre relies on the vacillation between truth and illusion, believability and unreality, and perhaps most importantly between reasoned explanation and tolerance for the unexplainable. Various terms exist for the fantastic technique – or what in Spanish is called \"magical realism,\" included in what in \"Object Oriented Ontology\" (OOO) philosophy is called \"speculative realism\" – offering a variety of perspectives from which to study both technique and reader reception.\n\nWe start with classic reading techniques (identifying the moments of what Freud called the uncanny; describing how the uncanny functions; locating the attempts to undo the uncanny with reasoned explanation; examining the final moment in the story, when reasoned explanations are not enough, of the unsatisfying but tantalizing conclusion). Students will articulate clearly what is purposely made unclear in the fantastic story. As we move from story to story, working sometimes in groups, we will classify the types and techniques of uncanny (linguistic; structural; psychological; pseudo-scientific).\n\nFinally, we will apply OOO philosophies to the uncanny. OOO is a Heidegger-influenced school of thought that rejects the privileging of human existence over the existence of nonhuman objects. It is an enticingly useful lens through which to view the fantastic in literature. This segment of the course will cover the final 3 weeks. After reading a couple studies in philosophy plus one applying OOO to fantastic literature, students will make group presentations about separate parts of the last short story. The discussion – a graded component of the course – should produce commentary that will heighten students' appreciation of the uncanny elements of the story, culminating in the final paper.\n\nHUHC 021F* H1 ALGORITHMS IN DATA SCIENCE\n\nProfessors Kira Adaricheva and Simona Doboli\n\nMW 4:30-5:55PM and T 4:30-5:20PM\n\nCRN: 23641\n\nRSVLT 0201\n\nIn this course we will study and implement popular algorithms with applications in finances, logistics and data analysis. Most of these algorithms are very wide in their applications and could be adapted to new situations. We will study the background mathematics to understand how they work and why they terminate, also how effective they are in terms of the time needed for the computation. The course has a laboratory part devoted to learning and programming these algorithms in Python. Some background in mathematics and programming is recommended but not required.\n\n* HUHC 021's are non-Liberal Arts Courses.\n\nHUHC 020A (H1) U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND THE MIDDLE EAST\n\nProfessor Bernard Firestone, Political Science\n\nMWF 9:05-10:00AM\n\nCRN: 23762\n\nBROWR 0102\n\nOver the past seventy years, the Middle East has attracted a major portion of America's foreign policy attention. Although the region is characterized by a high level of political, religious, and ethnic diversity, many Americans tend to view the Middle East as an undifferentiated whole -- \"the most troublesome and dangerous region of the world.\" But as much as American policy-makers have invested enormous time and resources in the Middle East, our strategic goals have appeared frequently muddled and our policies not only ineffective but even counter-productive. This course will examine American foreign policy toward the region and attempt to explain what motivates that policy. We will explore a number of subjects, including the Arab-Israel conflict, Iran, terrorism, Syria, and the Arab Spring and attempt to provide historical context for American policy. Students will be organized into small groups and asked to come up with new ideas about how the United States can best meet the challenges posed to our interests by events in the Middle East. In addition to a midterm and final, students will participate in a small group presentation and submit a short essay based on that presentation.\n\n(The chair of the political science department has indicated this course may be counted as a political science elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors. The chair of the global studies department has indicated this course may be counted as a regional elective toward the major or minor in global studies.)\n\nHUHC 020B (H1) CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE FIRST KIND: EXPLORING \"OTHER\" (NON-WESTERN) CULTURES THROUGH ETHNOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTARIES\n\nProfessor John Pulis, Anthropology\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 20386\n\nDAVSN 0102\n\nThis course will introduce students to the diversity of non- western societies and cultures through ethnographic or documentary film tradition in anthropology. Visual media, motion, still, and most recently digital imagery, has been a primary research tool in the methodological took kit of American anthropology since the discipline was first established by Franz Boas in the late 19th-century. Boas used photography to document his field work among the Kwakiutl in British Columbia, legitimizing the medium as a tool, setting in motion what became a rich ethnographic documentary tradition. We will explore this tradition, from its beginning with Boas and his ongoing confrontation with Hollywood, to contemporary ethnographers documenting the affect of climate change, globalization, and the Internet on indigenous societies. We begin with a classic, \"Nanook of the North,\" a silent film documenting the life of an Inuit hunter-gather in the Arctic, and move globally to the Amazon (Jivaro), Australia (Aborigines), Asia (Genghis Blues), Oceania (Once Were Warriors), South Africa (Kung), and North America (Navajo), and a host of indigenous films and filmmakers (Smoke Signals, Fast Runner, Ten Canoes).\n\n(The chair of the anthropology department has indicated this course may be counted as an Anthropology elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020C H1 RELIGION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE\n\nProfessor Timothy Daniels, Anthropology\n\nMW 2:55-4:20PM\n\nCRN: 21105\n\nDAVSN 0102\n\nIn this course, students will explore how diverse religious traditions conceive of and work toward building a just society. Domestic and international conditions in our contemporary world demand that we take a nuanced look at the way religions motivate believers to make change. We will discuss a variety of topics, including the civil rights movement, peace and anti-violence campaigns, and religious responses to class, ethnic, racial, and gender inequities. In order to gain critical insight, we will engage with scriptural sources from Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, and other religious traditions, as well as the writings of contemporary religious activists and thinkers. As a class, we will also seek opportunities to dialogue with local religious advocacy groups.\n\n(The chair of the anthropology department has indicated this course may be counted as an anthropology elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors. The chair of the religion department has indicated this course may be counted as a religion elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20D (H1) WOMEN'S HEALTH AND REPRODUCTION\n\nProfessor Katrina Sims, History\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 23788\n\nMEML 0010B\n\nThis course will explore women's health care from midwifery to reproductive freedom. Throughout the semester, students will interact with various community groups including Planned Parenthood and the Hispanic Counseling Center to gain interview skills, determine contemporary health care needs of women on Long Island, and serve the community through volunteerism.\n\n(The chair of the history department has indicated this course may be counted as history elective toward the completion of history requirements for majors or minors. The chair of the global studies department has indicated this course may be counted as a non-regional elective toward the major or minor in global studies.)\n\nHUHC 20H H1 DIRECTOR'S SANDBOX: TV & SERIAL DIRECTING\n\nProfessor Nicole Franklin, RTVF\n\nMW 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 23793\n\nRSVLT 0111\n\nIn the genre of scripted television or streaming series, it is the responsibility of visual storytellers to capture scenes, episodes and the evolution of a series concept with conscious intent. In order to master this technique when developing stories for the screen, it is the director and their production team who must work diligently on their artistry while mastering a signature style. The Director's Handbook provides a platform for innovative learning techniques to uncover what is required for successful storytelling on the stage and screen: Diving into the subtext in order to infuse life and character objectives into compelling narrative. This seminar brings the human connection, whether watching a story based in fantasy or unfamiliar territory, to the surface. In addition to the writer of the work, it's the director who brings the clear and persuasive vision no matter the complexities of the plot. With this seminar, students have the chance to develop one more storytelling skill to help them succeed.\n\nHUHC 20I H1 THIS IS THE END: LITERATURE AND APOCALYPSE\n\nProfessor Adam Sills, English\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 23063\n\nMASON 0020\n\nJudgment day, zombie apocalypse, nuclear and cyber war, global pandemic, alien invasion, environmental collapse, meteor collision, machine uprising: all of these represent the various ways in which humanity has, over the course of history, imagined \"the end\" of its existence. Whether by our own agency, by the hand of some unseen, uncontrollable force, or some combination of the two, we have always contemplated the end of things, often in a religious or spiritual context but, just as often, as a routine part of our collective desire to be entertained by such shocking and horrific events. That desire is manifest in many current film and television offerings, from 2012 to World War Z to the Matrix and Terminator trilogies, from the reality show Doomsday Preppers to The Walking Dead to Falling Skies. There is even the recent emergence of the so-called apocalyptic comedy, such as This Is the End, Seeking a Friend of the End of the World, and Zombieland. What exactly compels us to watch such apocalyptic fare? Why are we drawn to narratives depicting the end of humanity and the world as we know it? And why do we find such narratives to be \"entertaining\" in any sense? This semester, we will seek to answer some of these questions, and perhaps generate a few of our own, by reading and discussing literary works that speak to our enduring preoccupation with the apocalypse and its aftermath, including Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, Cormac McCarthy's The Road, Mary Shelley's The Last Man, H.G. Wells' The War of the Worlds, Alan Moore's Watchmen, Colson Whitehead's Zone One, and Lucretius' On the Nature of Things. In addition, we will read a variety of apocalyptic and prophetic literature from the Bible, including the Book of Revelation.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English elective toward the completion of English requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020G H1 DESIGNER DRUGS\n\nProfessor Ling Huang, Chemistry\n\nTR 9:35-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 24642\n\nBRESL 0208\n\nDesigner drugs, such as \"Spice\", \"Bath Salts\" and \"Molly\", have spread rapidly around the world in the past decade. They are synthetic analogs or mimics of controlled substances made to evade law enforcement, often used for recreational purposes. Many of these designer drugs came from research labs where medicinal compounds are being explored. Most of these designer drugs also have natural origins and initial applications in folk medicine. Recently the national opioid pandemic and the subsequent controlling of traditional opioids fueled the emergence of many designer opioids.\n\nIn this course, students will learn the history of designer drugs, the chemistry behind the synthesis of these drugs, the analytical methods used for the detection and quantification (some done at Hofstra), toxicological effects, and the chemical challenges facing law enforcement and legislations. No previous background in chemistry is needed as layman terms and Lego-block analogy will be used to describe the chemical reactions. In the seminar, relevant laws, war on drugs, dark web, social media's roles will be discussed. Majority of the reading materials will NOT be on chemistry, rather on the overall phenomenon of designer drugs. Honor students are encouraged to think about the complex societal impacts designer drug causes and propose viable solutions.\n\nFALL 2018 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 20I (H1) READING AND WRITING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER 'HOT' TOPICS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE\n\nProfessor Jase Bernhardt, Geology\n\nTR 9:35-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 95834\n\nDVSN 102\n\nIn an era featuring increasing concern for the environment, but at the same time, an increase in partisanship, how do we consume, interpret, and communicate information about topics such as climate change and sustainability? Throughout this seminar, we will learn how to analyze scientific writing in the mainstream media, academic journals, and governmental reports. Students will have the opportunity to select articles of interest, prepare critiques, and lead group paper discussions. In addition to reading and critiquing the work of others, students will learn how to write about science for both technical and broader audiences. Enhancing these reading and writing assignments will be background lectures demonstrating, at an introductory level, how the various Earth systems operate, how we as humans influence them, and how we can limit our impacts in a just and efficient manner. Field trips off campus to the Hempstead Plains and an Escape Room experience will complement in-class activities and create opportunities for students to get to know one another.\n\n(The Director of Sustainability Studies has indicated this course may be counted as a Sustainability elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20D (H1) WATER, WATER, EVERYWHERE\n\nProvost Gail Simmons, Biology\n\nMW 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 92052\n\nBARND 102\n\n\"Water, Water Everywhere\" is an interdisciplinary exploration of the most curious and pervasive substance in the universe – water. We will explore several \"big ideas\" about water: the ubiquity, pervasiveness and anomaly of water in the universe and on our planet; and humanity's relationship to and agency over water -- its power, its limits, its necessity for our survival as a species. We'll delve, at a basic level, into the science of how water is put together — the role of water in the human body, our planet, and the universe; the economics, politics, and sociology of water; and water's power as a metaphor, religious symbol, and theme in literature. Individual students will write a mid-term paper that explores some aspect of water that matches their interest. Students will then work in teams that bring together diverse majors and interests to produce a final research-based multimedia project that tells a compelling story about water.\n\nHUHC 20G (H1) MASS COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN LATIN AMERICA\n\nProfessor Mario Murillo, Radio, Television, and Film (RTVF)\n\nTR 2:20-3:45 PM\n\nCRN 93059\n\nDAVSN 102\n\nThis course examines how social movements in Latin America have deployed mass communication as a tool of their grassroots mobilizing efforts across the continent. Using historical and contemporary case studies in the region, students will be introduced to the variety of strategies that have been applied by Indigenous, peasant, Afro-descendant, student and women's organizations to contest the political, social and economic status quo in their respective countries. From Bolivian Miner's Radio in the 1940s to the Zapatista National Liberation Front in Mexico in the 1990s, from community-published newspapers, to contemporary social media campaigns, we will critically assess the successes and the challenges of constructing a bottom-up counter-narrative to the mainstream, establishment media system in Latin America.\n\nThe class will have a combination lecture and seminar format, with students expected to participate actively in discussions of readings, extensive video/film presentations, guest lectures, as well as unfolding issues making news in the region.\n\n(The chair of the RTVF department has indicated this course may be counted as an RTVF elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20C (H1) JUSTICE FOR ALL: AN AMERICAN REALITY OR ILLUSION?\n\nJudge Fern Fisher, Law School\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 92049\n\nDVSN 014\n\nThrough an exploration of past and recent court decisions, historical and sociological materials, we aim in this class to discern whether race, ethnicity, national origin, gender and poverty provide barriers to obtaining justice in the United States. Students will also observe a court or administrative proceeding and be challenged at the end of the semester to provide suggestions for changes they identify as necessary in the American justice system.\n\n(The chair of the Sociology department has indicated this course may be counted as a departmental elective toward the completion of the requirements for the Criminology major or minor.)\n\nHUHC 20E (H1) BITTER/SWEET: BRITISH LITERATURE, CONSUMER CULTURE, GLOBAL CONTEXTS\n\nProfessor Irene Fizer\n\nMW 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 92053\n\nBROWR 102\n\nThis course traces the emergence of modern concepts of consumption through selected works of British literature that span the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. We will look at literary texts--such as Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights, Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, George Orwell's 1984, Jean Rhys' \"The Day They Burned the Books,\" and Christina Rossetti's \"Goblin Market\"--through an interdisciplinary lens, and in relation to contemporary works of cultural criticism, such as Stanley Mintz's Sweetness and Power: The Place of Sugar in Modern History, Bee Wilson's Consider the Fork, and Wolfgang Schivelbusch's Tastes of Paradise: A Social History of Spices, Stimulants, and Intoxicants. Beginning in the late 1600s, new products, including coffee from Arabia, tea from China, and sugar from the Caribbean, began to flow into English ports. In the wake of the institutionalization of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and the expansion of the British Empire's overseas territories, English writers began to consider how global trade was at once creating a seemingly insatiable consumer demand for imported commodities, and giving rise to new arenas of social interaction, such as coffeehouses, tea shops, and urban pleasure gardens. At the same time, many of the commodities upon which the English were now dependent were being produced by men, women, and children who were either enslaved or exploited for their labor. As the literary texts in this course juxtapose the worlds of the imperial capital and the colony, they foreground questions relating to broader issues of the free market, economic injustice, racial division, and gender.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English/Creative Writing elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020F (H1) SUFISM: ISLAMIC MYSTICISM OR A FORM OF SOCIAL NETWORK?\n\nProfessor Elyor Karimov, Fine Arts, Art History and Design\n\nTR 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 92051\n\nDAVS 0014\n\nSufism is best known as the Islamic Mysticism. This, however, is only a part of the story. In fact, Sufism emerged as a social phenomenon parallel to the mainstream Islam by the 11th century CE and by the 14th century started assuming the role of the state ideology in all major non-Arab regions of Islamic world. As social networks, Sufi brotherhoods (orders) have been responsible for Islamic missionary activity from Asia (China and India) to Africa and to Europe's Balkan Peninsula. In the last several centuries Sufism served as the middle class Ideology and the source of inspiration for Persian, Turkic and Indian literature. Poetry brought Sufi philosophical and spiritual ideas beyond Muslim world deeply affecting European and American culture. For centuries Sufism provided social and political stability. Unfortunately, beginning with the 20th century Salafi ideologies started seeing local Sufi Islam as its principle foe and now are waging a major war on Sufism. Yet, in many places Sufi tolerance still serves as alternative to Islamic fundamentalism. This course will examine both the history of Sufism and its place in contemporary religious and political discourses.\n\nHUHC 20B (HA) CABINET OF CURIOUSITIES\n\nProfessor Sophie Hawkins, Religion\n\nTR 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 91107\n\nLIBRARY 245\n\nThis seminar takes its inspiration from 17th century cabinets of curiosities or wunderkammern (wonder rooms). These were collections of the exotic and the bizarre, including both natural specimens and cultural artefacts brought back from distant lands. Whilst these cabinets served to prove the collector's social status, they were also invitations to think. Objects were grouped in fluid taxonomies rather than rigid hierarchies, and viewers were invited to marvel at the wonders of the world.\n\nIn this seminar, we will seek to create our own cabinet of curiosities—each object to be selected by an individual student but researched collaboratively by us all. Hence there will be no predetermined curriculum for the seminar; rather, the areas of research will be determined by student's own intellectual and cross-disciplinary interests.\n\n(The chair of the Religion department has indicated this course may be counted as a Religion elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20J (H1) THIS IS YOUR BRAIN ON POLITICS: MANIFESTATIONS AND APPLICATIONS IN POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY\n\nProfessor David Green, Political Science\n\nMW 2:55-4:20PM\n\nCRN: 94569\n\nBARND 102\n\nThe standard model for explaining political behavior is Enlightenment rationalism, updated by the rational-choice model prevalent in the social sciences. However, both contemporary political events and new brain-scanning technology increasingly remind us of how incomplete that approach is. Enter the discipline of political psychology. In this course, which surveys the prominent applications and manifestations of this new approach to explaining political behavior, we'll examine the political psychology of identity, ideology, racism/intolerance, voting behavior, leadership, international conflict and cooperation, terrorism, decision-making, social movements and more.\n\n(The chair of the Political Science department has indicated this course may be counted as a Political Science elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 021A (H1) DEVELOPING A NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE\n\nProfessor Boonghee Yoo\n\nTR 11:10 12:35\n\nCRN: 96241\n\nGALW 013\n\nA business requires three steps to develop and launch a new product or service successfully: Market Segmentation (Identify and profile distinct groups of buyers who differ in their needs and preferences), Market Targeting (Select one or more attractive and fitting market segments to enter), and Product Positioning (For each target segment, design a right quality product and change customer beliefs and attitudes). The objective of the course is to help students to learn those concepts in depth and develop necessary skills to implement the concepts to real business situations for innovative products/services. The course will consist of lectures, journal article discussions, a new product design, and consumer data collection and analysis.\n\nSpring 2018 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 20D (H1) WHO GETS TO SPEAK?: THE FIRST AMENDMENT IN THE 21ST CENTURY\n\nProfessor Akilah Folami, Law School\n\nMW 9:05-10:30 AM\n\nCRN 24832\n\nLaw School\n\nThis course will explore the actual Freedom of Speech and Freedom of the Press clauses in the Constitution and take a deep dive into juridical interpretations of each as found in most of the major Supreme Court decisions. Topics explored will include, hate speech on college campuses and beyond, speech that incites, defames, is deemed obscene, offensive or profane, and conduct that may also express messages, such as clicking the \"Like\" button on Facebook and advertising to sell a product, etc. The course will begin with a solid introduction of the philosophical theories that undergird the concept of freedom of expression in the U.S. given the intensely diverse and interpersonal world in which we live, both on a national and global level. At the completion of this course, you will have been exposed to key elements of First Amendment jurisprudence and will have applied such to varying historical and contemporary contexts.\n\nHUHC 20A (H1) SCIENCE AND SOCIETY: CLASHES AND COLLABORATIONS\n\nProfessor Sabrina, Sobel, Chemistry\n\nMWF 9:05-10:00 AM\n\nCRN: 24805\n\nBROWR 102\n\nThroughout history, the pursuit of knowledge has been influenced by the prevailing culture. In this seminar, we explore how the development of math, physics and chemistry have been shaped by culture by reading and discussing select science history books.\n\nHUHC 20B H1 PHYSICS AND POETRY\n\nProfessor Charles Anderson, Writing Studies, Composition and Rhetoric\n\nTR 2:20-3:45 PM\n\nCRN: 20400\n\nDAVSN 0014\n\nIs there a common denominator between physics and poetry? Physics basically asks the questions, \"Why are we here? What is the meaning of life? What is the nature of reality?\" The history of physics has been linked to the literature of its time, and poets have been asking the same question for centuries. We like to think that life has a purpose. Einstein said, \"God does not play dice.\"\n\nThere are parallels between science and literature: the creation myths and cosmology, pre-Socratic philosophy and elementary particles; the metaphysical poets such as John Donne and Renaissance physics; Locke, Pope, Blake and Newtonian physics; Kierkegaard and Bohrs' theory of the atom; Einstein as scientist and humanist; relativity, quantum physics, and modern art; and thermodynamics, entropy, and ecology. In their efforts to describe the natural world, poets and physicists alike depend on metaphors and other literary devices, even if they use different kinds of tropes. In \"A Brief History of Time,\" Stephen Hawking talks about \"the arrow of time\" and \"black holes\" in the universe. Readings will range from Einstein to T.S. Eliot.\n\nHUHC 20H (H1) DRAMA, OPERA & DANCE: INTERACTIONS AND OPPOSITIONS\n\nProfessor James Kolb, Drama\n\nMF 11:15-12:40 PM\n\nCRN: 24838\n\nLOWE 217\n\nDrama dates from the 5th century B.C.E. in Greece, opera started in 1597 in Florence, Italy, and ballet started at Italian banquets in the late 15th Century, evolving into story ballet at the French court by the late 16th Century. Both opera and ballet as story forms can be traced back to ancient Greek tragedy and, in fact, opera sought to recreate the combination of music, story and dance that was typical of the ancient form.\n\nShakespeare, in the early 17th Century had to compete with Masques presented at court, so he included song and dance in many of his later plays. Molière was obliged to work at the French court with both opera/ballet composers and choreographers, and adjusted his plays acordingly. In turn the dramas of Shakespeare, Molière, Beaumarchais, Sheridan, Goethe, Schiller, Victor Hugo and numerous other poets and playwrights provided the subject matter and story lines for both ballet and opera into the 21st Century. Even in modern dance, Martha Graham was regularly inspired to create modern dances based on ancient Greek stories and myths, including those dramatic ones involving Clytemnestra, Oedipus, and Medea.\n\nAs much as we may see these forms as different, drama, opera and dance have much in common as, for the most part, they are all grounded in character depiction and story telling. Each form has also explored abstraction and has taken different directions in some of its work, but by and large these three forms of performing art share more than they differ. This seminar will explore the commonalities among these three forms from the 16th through the early part of the 21st Century. Because these are aural and visual forms, many examples from all three art forms will be seen and heard in class. Readings in the history of drama, ballet and opera, and readings of a number of plays will assist in connecting the dots among and between these three \"differing worlds.\"\n\nHUHC 20C H1 MONSTERS, POLITICS, AND ROCKETS: A CENTURY OF ITALIAN COMIC BOOKS\n\nProfessor Simone Castaldi, ROmance Languages and Literatures\n\nMW 4:30-5:55 PM\n\nCRN: 21163\n\nBRESL 103\n\nThis course follows the development of the comic book medium in Italy from its inception at the beginning of the 20th century to the present. In addition to familiarizing themselves with the major trends and movements in Italian comics -- including the early experimentations with modernism, the colonialist adventure epics of the fascist period, the literate narratives for mature readers of the '70s, and the postmodern sci-fi dystopian visions of the '80s -- students will learn about Italian society, history, and politics while gaining an understanding of the present-day political situation. Furthermore, as we examine the richly intertextual works that are the subject of the course, the students will be presented with narratological tools in order to appreciate the structural complexity of the comic-book medium and to examine the deceptive divide between works of so-called high culture and those of the popular media.\n\nHUHC 20I H1 FROM PAGE TO SCREEN: THE ART OF ADAPTATION\n\nProfessor Paula Uruburu, English\n\nTR 2:20-3:45 PM\n\nCRN: 23726\n\nMASN 0020\n\nThe word \"adaptation\" describes the translation of a text from one form into another. Adaptation covers a wide range – from sources such as literary genres (including the novel, short story, poetry, drama, non-fiction), graphic novels, biographies, foreign source material into English (and vice versa), etc. Frequently, a text can be \"lost in translation,\" with adaptations failing to capture the full meaning or intent of the original source material. However, there are those adaptations that not only survive the process, but, perhaps improve on that material or help it \"translate\" better in terms of changing environments and shifting tastes and time periods. But what difference does a genre or form make? What are the opportunities for improvement and challenges in adapting a text from one form to another? This course will explore the nature of adaptation across a broad spectrum, during which time students will expand their critical skills in analyzing a text, investigating past and current adaptation theory, and discovering how certain historical and cultural forces shape interpretations of texts and their contexts.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English elective toward the completion of English requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 21A* H1 MIND GAMES: PSYCH OF PERFORMANCE\n\nProfessor Steven Frierman, Physical Education and Sports Sciences\n\nTR 9:35-11:00 AM\n\nCRN: 24440\n\nBRESL 208\n\nThis course is designed to introduce students to the relationship between the mind and body in sport. Students will learn how the mind affects sports performance and how sports performance affects the mind by acquiring an understanding of contemporary principles and theories developed in sport and exercise psychology and then applying them to real sport and exercise situations in both recreational and competitive settings. Topics include: (1) identifying personality differences between successful and unsuccessful athletes; (2) motivational strategies; (3) learning how to concentrate on what is in your control; (4) playing with optimal confidence; (5) arousal regulation; (6) group dynamics; (7) overcoming barriers that stop you; (8) substance abuse; (9) coaching strategies; (10) designing your own mental training programs and so much more...\n\nHUHC 21E* H1 BASEBALL ANALYTICS\n\nProfessor Richard Puerzer, Engineering\n\nMW 12:50-2:15 PM\n\nCRN: 24837\n\nStatistical analysis tools are utilized in many fields as a means for measuring and better understanding systems. The sport of baseball is perhaps the most statistical of sports. Because of its long history and the discrete nature in which the game is played, a great deal of useful data on player and team performance is available. This data can be analyzed statistically, providing the opportunity to better understand the complex systems which make up the game of baseball. This course will introduce a number of statistical methods and tools which can be used to study baseball. Students will develop the analytical skills necessary to study baseball or any other complex systems.\n\n* HUHC 021's are non-Liberal Arts Courses.\n\nFall 2017 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 20D (H1) BLACK CINEMA\n\nProfessor Jennifer Henton, English\n\nMW 12:50-2:15PM\n\nCRN: 92052\n\nThis course examines the production, image, and theory of the black presence (and aesthetic) in cinema. Students will be exposed to the historical trajectory of black people in film (Birth of a Nation [1915]) as well as \"black film\" production (Oscar Micheaux to Dee Rees/Spike Lee) and emergent theories of the black aesthetic. Since thinking, studying, and writing about film studies depends on precise terms and articulation of ways of seeing, a strong theoretical component will accompany this course. Our goal by semester's end is for students to master historical and theoretical knowledge and be able to articulate a deep understanding of the black cinematic tradition in the U.S. Students will communicate their grasp of the area through essays, quizzes, mid-term and final exams, and a final project designed to give students an opportunity to display the insights they have gained.\n\nHUHC 20A (H1) INTRODUCTION TO ARCHITECTURE: CASE STUDIES\n\nProfessor Joseph Masheck, Fine Arts and Art History\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 90708\n\nArchitecture may be the most ubiquitous of the fine arts (painting, sculpture, architecture); but except for obvious fashions, most people hardly notice it, even though it shapes their experience almost every day. Also: it is by and large the most expensive fine art, of seemingly durable materials; and yet it is the least preserved and most destroyed. Whenever it survives, however, it shows more physically than anything else the 'frame of mind' of people at a certain time: notions of space (by no means always the same); social hierarchy versus equality; not to mention the art's basis in available materials and techniques—everything from physics (e.g. the principle of the cantilever) to metaphysics (the principle of monumentality). We deal in this course with fundamentals of both theory (including the distinction of architecture from mere building) and historical practice in the classical as well as the modern tradition. Students learn how to analyze buildings in terms of structure, style, and cultural function. Two or three field trips. Readings by architects and art historians; but you will also learn how to read a ground plan!\n\nHUHC 020C (H1) POETRY OF WITNESS\n\nProfessor Maria C. Roberts, Department of English\n\nTR 9:35-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 92049\n\nMotto\n\nIn the dark times, will there also be singing?\n\nYes, there will be singing.\n\nAbout the dark times. --Bertolt Brecht\n\nIn this workshop we will study \"poetry of witness,\" a genre of poetry described by Carolyn Forche in her anthology Against Forgetting: Twentieth Century Poetry of Witness written by \"significant poets who endured conditions of historical and social extremity during the twentieth century—through exile, state censorship, political persecution, house arrest, torture, imprisonment, military occupation, warfare and assassination.\" Poems that \"bear the trace of extremity within them, and [that] are, as such, evidence of what occurred.\" We will also study 21st century \"poetry of engagement\" by both established and emerging poets that deal with the public events, government policies, ecological and political threats, economic uncertainties, and large-scale violence that have defined the century to date.\n\nIn addition to working on a new poem every other week, each student will give an oral presentation on a poetry collection chosen from the recommended reading. Each student is responsible for photocopying his/her work, distributing it to the class, and then reading it aloud. Those not presenting work are responsible for contributing to the discussion by offering constructive criticism, praise, suggestions for revisions, etc.\n\nDuring the course of the semester, two poets will visit our class to talk about poetry of witness. Professor Mario Susko, a survivor and witness of the war in Bosnia and Liv Mammone, a Hofstra alum who writes about disability and bearing witness in her work.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English/Creative Writing elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20E (H1) THE ECONOMICS OF INEQUALITY\n\nProfessor Massoud Fazeli, Economics\n\nMW 2:55-4:20PM\n\nCRN: 92053\n\nTHE ECONOMICS OF INEQUALITY:\n\nWhat does it mean to say we are all equal? Is this merely a positive expression of facts, stating our inherent equality in basic rights, or is it rather a normative statement promoting equality? What do people mean when they say we want equality in opportunity but not artificially imposed equality in result? Is it not true that inequality in result today will inevitably generate unequal opportunity for the next generation?\n\nIsaiah Berlin, a prominent philosopher, stated that: 'the assumption is that equality needs no reasons, only inequality does so… If I have a cake and there are ten persons among whom I wish to divide it, then if I give exactly one tenth to each, this will not, at any rate automatically, call for justification; whereas if I depart from this principle of equal division I am expected to produce a special reason'. Not all agree with this view. Another philosopher, Harry Frankfurt, maintains that equality has no intrinsic moral value. We must rather strive to improve the conditions of the poor and less privileged: 'inequality in incomes might be decisively eliminated, after all, just by arranging that all incomes be equally below the poverty line'. According to this perspective, equality in poverty and misery has no intrinsic moral advantage and will definitely not promote social welfare.\n\nWe are facing very critical and politically volatile issues here. For instance, there is growing populist anger in many countries, including the United States. Did those who voted for president Trump do so to express their frustration with growing inequality or was this vote an attempt by the mostly white nativist working class to recreate the \"white privilege\" as some have called it?\n\nWe will discuss three main topics in this course: egalitarianism and its advocates and foes, growing inequality in the distribution of wealth and income in the U.S. in recent decades, the role of social movements and policy in addressing and alleviating these trends.\n\n(The chair of the Economics department has indicated this course may be counted as an Economics elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors, if the student has not already taken an HUHC seminar for Economics credit previously.)\n\nHUHC 20F (H1) SOUNDSCAPES: MUSIC IN THE 3RD WORLD\n\nProfessor John Pulis, Anthropology\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 92051\n\nThis course will introduce students to cultural anthropology and the way indigenous, native, or first peoples in Asia, Oceania, Africa, and the Americas practice and perform music. Our approach will be historical and descriptive. Using the culture-area approach and the idea of a \"soundscape,\" we will listen, watch (film, live performance- Mohegan drummers, Scottish fiddle players, Brazilian capoeira ), and we will explore the role of \"sound\" among Tuvan pastoralists, Aboriginal hunter-gathers, South American head-hunters, Navajo-Sioux flute players and various groups in modern and post-colonial societies (Calypso, Ska, Mento, High-Life et al.). Along with the above, we will discuss theory, cultural formation (syncretism, and the way various genres (Hip-Hop, Reggae) have been invented and reinvented across and through time.\n\n(The chair of the Anthropology department has indicated this course may be counted as an Anthropology elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20G (H1) PALEOBIOLOGY OF THE DINOSAURS\n\nProfessor J. Bret Bennington, Geology, Environment, and Sustainability\n\nTR 2:20-3:45PM\n\nCRN: 93059\n\nDinosaurs were first unearthed almost 200 years ago and ever since paleontologists have been trying to work out what living dinosaurs were like from their fossil remains. This is particularly challenging because dinosaurs were so enormous and so unusual in their physiology – nothing quite like them exists today. Our ideas about dinosaurs have changed so much over the years that one has to wonder, will we ever really know what living dinosaurs were like? New fossils and new methods of analysis constantly surprise us (who would have guessed twenty years ago that Tyrannosaurus rex had feathers?) yet they do bring us ever closer to seeing these extinct titans as they really were. In this seminar we will explore the methods of analysis paleobiologists have developed for reconstructing the biology of extinct animals and review the latest fossil discoveries and research studies concerning dinosaur physiology, evolution, ecology, behavior, growth, and reproduction. Trips to the American Museum of Natural History and to see dinosaur fossils in the field will be offered. Felt fedoras are optional.\n\nHUHC 20B (H1) VISUALIZING PERCEPTION: DEMO FABRICATION LABORATORIES\n\nProfessors Elizabeth Ploran, Psychology and Jackson Snellings, Computer Science\n\nTR 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 91107\n\nThis seminar will be team-taught by a cognitive neuroscientist and an interactive technologist as a hands-on course in teaching science concepts through physical demonstrations. Students will learn the basics of certain sensation and perception concepts (e.g., color perception, how the ear works) while simultaneously considering how to demonstrate those concepts to lay audiences through short physical laboratory exercises using commonly available objects. The focus will be on how to accurately represent science concepts in an accessible, easy-to-learn way that can reproduced across multiple contexts (e.g., classrooms, museums, home schooling). This course will be equal parts traditional content and project development, with heavy emphasis on interdisciplinary discovery and incorporation of artistic skills into the practice of science communication. Students should be prepared to actively discuss the science behind the concepts while also stretching their creative skills and practicing disseminating information to the public.\n\n(The chair of the Psychology department has indicated this course may be counted as a Psychology elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors. This course will also count for credit towards the Neuroscience minor by petition to Dr. Elisabeth Ploran, chair of the minor.)\n\nHUHC 20I (H1) READING AND WRITING ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE AND OTHER 'HOT' TOPICS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE\n\nProfessor Jase Bernhardt, Geology\n\nTR 9:35-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 94558\n\nIn an era featuring increasing concern for the environment, but at the same time, an increase in partisanship, how do we consume, interpret, and communicate information about topics such as climate change and sustainability? Throughout this seminar, we will learn how to analyze scientific writing in the mainstream media, academic journals, and governmental reports. Students will have the opportunity to select articles of interest, prepare critiques, and lead group paper discussions. In addition to reading and critiquing the work of others, students will learn how to write about science for both technical and broader audiences. Enhancing these reading and writing assignments will be background lectures demonstrating, at an introductory level, how the various Earth systems operate, how we as humans influence them, and how we can limit our impacts in a just and efficient manner.\n\n(The Director of Sustainability Studies has indicated this course may be counted as a Sustainability elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20J (H1) SURVEY OF POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES\n\nProfessor David Green, Political Science\n\nMW 2:55-4:20PM\n\nCRN 94569\n\nWhat are political ideologies, and how do you classify them? Is the left-right dimension of ideology adequate for a discussion of politics? Is it possible to construct a more complex classification? How does one treat nationalist ideologies, or environmentalist ideologies, or religious or multicultural ideologies using a left-right formulation – even an elaborated one?\n\nThis course begins with a discussion of the function of ideology in societies, from the anthropological, psychological and analytical perspectives. What are some of the problems of categorizing in ideological terms? Next, the course considers some historical background on the idea of ideology itself, and the way in which our formulations have changed over time.\n\nThe course finally examines a wide variety of established ideological belief systems, including conservatism, liberalism, socialism, communism and fascism. Also included will be some other ideologies of rising importance today: nationalism, neoliberalism, anarchism, libertarianism, feminism, environmentalism, liberation ideologies, various multiculturalist ideologies and religious fundamentalisms, including case studies.\n\n(The chair of the Political Science department has indicated this course may be counted as a Political Science elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20K (H1) THE PEN AS A BRUSH: HISPANIC POETRY AND PAINTING\n\nProfessor Miguel-Angel Zapata, Romance Languages\n\nTR 11:10-12:35 PM\n\nCRN 94570\n\nThe focus of this course pertains to poets from Spain and Latin America. All of the poets selected have centered some of their key works around certain paintings; these paintings have also influenced their development as poets. A truncated list of the poets and paintings to be studied includes: Jose Angel Valente (Spain: \"Picasso-Guernica\" and \"Lyriker, 1911\" by Egon Shiele), Jose Emilio Pacheco (Mexico: \"Crist on the Cross\" by Bosch), Jose Watanabe (Peru: \"The Scream,\" Edvard Munch), Piedad Bonnett (Colombia: \"The Wounded Deer,\" Frida Khalo), Oscar Hahn (Chile: \"Self-Potrait of Van Gogh\" and \"The Annunciation\" by Fra Angelico) and Cristina Peri Rossi (Uruguay: \"Hotel Room\" by Hopper and \"The Sleepers\" by Gustave Courbet\"). In the poems I have selected, one discovers the transformation of the brush stroke into the written word and an image that reappears as a new work of art. This encounter between poet and painter opens new doors of research into the intrinsic relation between the arts. It is not on a mere whim that so many writers have felt themselves attracted to works of visual art, and at the same time have expressed their interior selves through the contemplation of paintings, and that this exploration has caused them to work their way into the canvas itself, and to reside inside the brilliant house of color.\n\n(The chair of the Spanish department has indicated this course may be counted as an elective toward the completion of the requirements for majors in Spanish, provided the student has not received previous credit for a course in Spanish Literature in Translation, SPLT)\n\nSpring 2017 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 020F H1 MAPPING THE NATION: CARTOGRAPHY, CENSUS, AND SURVEY IN 17TH AND 18TH CENTURY BRITAIN\n\nProfessor Adam Sills, English\n\nMW 2:55-4:20PM\n\nCRN: 24463\n\nDAVS 0014\n\nThe central question for this seminar is what role, if any, do the map, census, and survey play in the creation and consolidation of early modern Britain? To answer that question, we will examine the evolution of cartography and demography from the Renaissance through the eighteenth century and the impact those practices have had not only on the geography of Britain but also on the very creation of the idea of Britain itself. Since the Renaissance, improvements in the accuracy and legibility of maps, the proliferation of empirically-based chorographies, and the popular vogue for travel narratives served to order, package, and commodify space in a fashion that was critical to the formation of British national identity. To \"ground\" our discussions, we will examine maps and literary works from the period, as well as contemporary theory and criticism, in order to better understand the relationship between cartography, demography, and national identity. Works may include Daniel Defoe's A Journal of the Plague Year, Maria Edgeworth's Castle Rackrent, Jane Austen's Mansfield Park, John Bunyan's The Pilgrim's Progress, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's The Turkish Embassy Letters, Aphra Behn's Oroonoko, Tobias Smollett's Humphrey Clinker, and Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English elective toward the completion of English requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20E H1 PERFORMING THE AVANT-GARDE\n\nProfessor Isabel Milenski, Music (w/ guest visits by Assistant Dean Lauren Kozol)\n\nMW 12:50-2:15PM\n\nCRN: 22986\n\nDAVS 0014\n\nIn this class, we will study the roots and flourishing of the avant-garde in America from 1900 to today. At the end of the semester, we will engage in both the creation and production of a collaborative avant-garde extravaganza. Throughout the 20th century, artists from all disciplines forged previously unimagined and often shocking pieces in the visual arts, music, theater, literature, dance and film, and at times, all of these, all at once. Avant-garde artists broke down the boundaries of media, cultural norms and political/aesthetic conventions. Moved by their time in a war-torn century, these artists produced works that were dark and subversive, but also humorous and absurd.\n\nWe will encounter the now legends of the 20th century avant-garde across the disciplines - including E. E. Cummings, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Igor Stravinsky, Sonia Delaunay, Hannah Höch, Florence Henri, Marcel Duchamp, Salvador Dali, Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie, Man Ray and Peter Sellars. In addition, we will explore some of the key movements from Dada and Surrealism to Pop art (Andy Warhol) and Fluxus (Yoko Ono), and the influences on these movements from the circus and mime to collage and chance. We will also meet New York's premier avant-garde collaborators including John Cage, Merce Cunningham and Robert Rauchenberg, and explore more contemporary forays into aesthetic innovation.\n\nThis course will be both rigorous and ridiculous. We will study, and we will perform. We will create art and anti-art, and we will do our best to analyze \"happenings\" that deliberately resist analysis. In addition, we will write and publish a professional program with articles in the spirit of the avant-garde for our final production. The class will culminate in a chance to be part of chance pieces as both experimental cultural creators and consumers.\n\nNo background in music or the allied arts are required for those taking this course. Just bring your creativity and passion.\n\n(The chair of the Music department has indicated this course may be counted as a Music elective toward the completion of Music requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020C H1 LOVE AND EROS IN LITERATURE, PHILOSOPHY AND CINEMA: LOVE AT FIRST AND LAST SIGHT\n\nProfessor Pellegrino D'Acierno, Comparative Languages and Literatures\n\nMW 4:30-5:55PM\n\nCRN: 21252\n\nBRESL 103\n\nAdopting a comparative and interdisciplinary approach, this course will attempt to elaborate an anatomy of love by examining a wide range of literary, philosophical and cinematic texts in which the art of love and the act of enamorment is thematized. It will trace the evolution of the idea of love primarily in western culture, with some references to non-western cultures. Beginning with Plato's Symposium, the course will examine the development of the amorous discourse that extends from paganism (Ovid's Art of Love) through the Bible (the Song and Songs) and Christianity to courtly love (the troubadours, Dante, and Petrarch), from the Renaissance (Boccaccio and Shakespeare) and Romanticism through modernism (T.S. Eliot, André Breton, Pablo Neruda) to the present day (\"Hollywood love\" and \"liquid love\"). Although the primary emphasis will involve close reading of literary, philosophical, and cinematic representations of love, the work of theorists such as Octavio Paz, Roland Barthes, and Luce Irigaray will also be considered.\n\n(The chair of the Comparative Languages and Literatures department has indicated this course may be counted as a CLL elective toward the completion of CLL requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20A H1 SCIENCE FICTION: THE GOLDEN AGE AND BEYOND\n\nProfessor Barbara Bengels, English\n\nTR 11:10-12:35PM\n\nCRD: 22236\n\nDAVS 0014\n\nIn Future Shock, Alvin Toffler argued that science fiction is the most important form of literature to prepare young people for the technological and sociological changes before them. Professor Bengels will discuss the development of science fiction in the twentieth century, its Golden Age, and how it has helped create the twenty-first century. Based on her personal acquaintance with many prominent science fiction writers, she will also use their letters to describe how they were encouraged--or brutally discouraged--from becoming authors. Students will read the best of SF past and present (authors such as Asimov, Bradbury, Clarke, Heinlein, Benford), as well as critical articles, and then produce their own comparative analyses.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as an English elective toward the completion of English requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020G H1 WHO GETS TO PLAY? ISSUES OF DIVERSITY IN THE PERFORMING ARTS\n\nProfessor Jean Dobie Giebel, Drama and Dance\n\nTR 9:35-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 24493\n\nBRESL 208\n\nThis course uses the racial history of Shakespeare performance in the United States and its legacy, including the development of the concept of \"colorblind\" casting and the backlash against that concept, as basis for discussing current performance practice and issues of diversity in the performing arts. It will begin with a critical examination of nineteenth century Shakespeare productions, and will continue by investigating the history and development of American Shakespeare theater practice through the early twentieth century custom of casting Caucasian actors to play such characters as Othello and Aaron (Titus Andronicus). We will then turn to the concept of \"colorblind casting\" championed in the latter half of the twentieth century by the Public Theater, producer of the acclaimed Shakespeare in the Park, and contrast that practice with August Wilson's famous rejections of \"colorblind casting\" in the 1990s. Our ultimate aim will be to explore current issues of equality in racial representation in American performing arts through a discussion of incidents such as Tonya Pinkin's public statement upon leaving the Classic Stage Company's production of Mother Courage, and the public examination of casting practices in Broadway's Hamilton.\n\n(The chair of the Drama and Dance department has indicated this course may be counted as an Drama elective toward the completion of Drama requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020B H1 TEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT CHANGED THE WORLD\n\nProfessor Barbara Jaffe, Fine Arts and Art History\n\nTR 2:20-3:45pm\n\nCRN: 20416\n\nCALKS 0013\n\nThe invention of photography in 1839 had a profound impact on the human race. The photographic image has become our global language, often more influential than words. But what is a photograph, really? What are its working parts? Where is its power? We will study 10 photographs that altered human thought, changed the arc of history and transformed world cultures.\n\n(The chair of the Fine Arts and Art History department has indicated this course may be counted as a Fine Arts and Art History elective toward the completion of requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020D H1 ECONOMICS AS AN EVOLUTIONARY SCIENCE\n\nProfessor Roberto Mazzoleni, Economics\n\nMW 12:50-2:15\n\nCRN: 20417\n\nGALWG 0014\n\nThe goal of this seminar is to introduce students to various aspects of the conception of economics as an evolutionary science. Evolutionary theorizing in the social sciences predates the elaboration of Darwin's theory of natural selection in 1859, but since the late nineteenth century several economists embracing an explicitly evolutionary approach to the study of economic development established varied and interesting connections among evolutionary processes in biology and in economics. However, the evolutionary approach failed to establish itself as a dominant paradigm in economics. In 1898, Thorstein Veblen wondered in dismay \"Why Isn't Economics an Evolutionary Science?\". And Alfred Marshall, whose work contributes key aspects of the 'neoclassical standard' in contemporary textbook microeconomics, wrote in 1920 that \"economics, like biology, deals with a matter, of which the inner nature and constitution, as well as the outer form, are constantly changing.\" The emerging neoclassical approach astonished Joseph Schumpeter, whose view of capitalism led him to write that \"the essential point to grasp is that in dealing with capitalism, we are dealing with an evolutionary process.\" After learning about the roots of evolutionary theorizing in economic thought, we will fast forward to contemporary research and debates among economists that explicitly or implicitly embrace an evolutionary approach. In particular, we will read and discuss recent writings concerned with the characterization of human actors in economics, the evolution of technology, institutions, business firms, and industries.\n\nWhile no background in economics or mathematics is required, awareness of basic economic principles and familiarity with mathematical modeling will be helpful.\n\n(The chair of the Economics department has indicated this course may be counted as an Economics elective toward the completion of Economics requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020I H1 EMBODIMENT AND THE CREATIVE PROCESS\n\nProfessor Robin Becker, Drama and Dance\n\nTR 9:00-11:00AM\n\nCRN: 24649\n\nLOWE 110\n\nIn this course we will explore the relationship of the body in movement to the creative processes of thought and perception. We will be working with the somatic practice of Continuum Movement and with texts that support an inquiry into the role and meaning of the body. In this time of technological advancement and great speed, there is a tendency to disassociate from the slower sensory intelligence of the body. Western culture often views the body as a form to objectify in ways that are similar to how machines are viewed and understood. Continuum Movement challenges that perspective and views the body as an unfolding creative process that is in a dynamic exchange and communication with all life forms. The body is primarily water, and at its essence, Continuum Movement is an exploration of the properties and movement of fluid systems as they shape and form life both within the body and throughout the larger world. Possible texts for the course will be Engaging the Movement of Life by Bonnie Gintis, DO, A General Theory of Love by Thomas Lewis, M.D., Fari Amini, M.D., and Richard Lannon, M.D., and How Life Moves by Caryn McHose and Kevin Frank. The course will also include DVDs documenting current research on movement and perception. The practice of Continuum Movement in no way resembles a dance or movement class in which one is asked to learn a prescribed set of movements. No prior movement experience is required for this course. Instead, this course will offer a process of engaging one's own personal exploration of movement with the goal of becoming more conscious of the sensation of life as it unfolds into our awareness through the communication and expression of movement.\n\n(The chair of the Drama and Dance department has indicated this course may be counted as a Dance elective toward the completion of Dance requirements for majors or minors.\n\nHUHC 021A* H1 COLLABORATING ACROSS CULTURES\n\nProfessor Kara Alaimo, Public Relations\n\nMW 12:50-2:10PM\n\nCRN: 24464\n\nRSVLT 110\n\nThis honors seminar will teach students how to successfully communicate in different countries and work as part of multicultural teams comprised of colleagues with very different workplace practices and expectations. We will study cultures across Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America. Students will learn the key dimensions on which people of different cultures differ - from our conceptions of time to whether we conceive of ourselves as individuals or part of groups - and examine the business and communication practices that work best in each of the world's ten \"cultural clusters.\"\n\n(The chair of the Public Relations department has indicated this course may be counted as a Public Relations elective toward the completion of Public Relations requirements for majors or minors.\n\nHUHC 021B* H1 GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISES\n\nProfessors Anoop Rai, Salvatore Sodano, Frank Zarb, Finance\n\nR 1:30-3:30PM\n\nCRN: 24465\n\nSTARR 209\n\nIn this course we examine financial crises around the globe and the ensuing evolution of financial regulations and public policy. These include analyses of the Tulip mania in the Netherlands in 1637, the South Sea and Mississippi Company bubbles in 1720, the economic panics of 1837, 1873, 1907 in the U.S., the Great Depression in 1929, the Japanese real estate crash in 1991 and the Great Recession of 2008. Misguided economic policies, financial innovation, regulatory forbearance and weak corporate governance are identified as common factors that precede major financial crises. Financial innovation will be shown to be both a catalyst and resolution to financial crises. Students will complete the course with a detailed analysis of the Dodd-Frank Bill of 2008.\n\n(The chair of the Finance department has indicated this course may be counted as a Finance elective toward the completion of Finance requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 021C* H1 MORAL DEVELOPMENT\n\nProfessor Arthur Dobrin, Management and Entrepreneurship\n\nTR 11:10-12:35PM\n\nCRN: 24648\n\nGALW 0014\n\n\"The essence of it is simple, but the process by which it is established is a great complication.\" While Simon Schama's remarks refer to art, it applies equally well to ethics. The essence of morality is simple but how we become moral and what it takes to remain moral is far from simple. Using insights from biology, psychology and philosophy the course examines the development and social factors that contribute to becoming a moral person. The course uses the social and hard sciences, fiction, film and self-examination for understanding the foundations and structures that provide the tools necessary for the development of an ethical personality.\n\n* HUHC 021's are non-Liberal Arts Courses.\n\nFall 2016 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 020F (H1) MAKING BABIES: RELIGIONS RESPOND TO NEW REPRODUCTIVE TECHNOLOGIES\n\nProfessor Ann Burlein, Department of Religion\n\nTR 12:45-2:10PM\n\nCRN: 92236\n\nThis course explores the reception of reproductive technologies such as IVF and surrogacy in different religious and cultural contexts. How do such technologies change when they are used by people whose cultural background includes belief in karma, multiple lives, and ancestors? Why do some religions define the use of donor sperm or eggs as adultery? What new forms of spirituality are emerging around the rejection of all artificial technology regarding birth?\n\n(The chair of the Religion department has indicated this course may be counted as a Religion elective toward the completion of Religion requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20B (HA) QUEER FRENCH FILM\n\nProfessor David Powell, Romance Languages and Literatures\n\nMW 12:50-2:15PM\n\nCRN: 91206\n\nThis course offers the opportunity to explore how films featuring same-sex desires reflect gay life and its concerns as they are manifested in French life. The dual goal seeks to clarify (1) aspects of same-sex culture in France (as distinct from in the US) and (2) how they are depicted in film. We will encounter and attempt to answer how films typically represent gay issues (where we will deal with stereotypes) and how these issues, and thereby their representations, differ in France from how they typically work in the US (so, different stereotypes and difference emphases).\n\nThe theoretical lens through which we will examine these films is queer theory, an academic field of inquiry that has proliferated over the past 25 years. We will also use various literary critical methods to analyze the queer message, symbols, context, and significance of queer cultural artifacts. Because we will be dealing with French culture, and French gay culture, you will be acquainting yourself with a social construct that, in many ways, in very different from American society and thus different from the American typical gay experience.\n\nAt the same time as we encounter elements of gay filmic culture, we will come across diverse social and political constructs and events that have shaped French gay culture and its response to these constructs. The linguistic element is naturally particularly pertinent; I will provide nuances between the English subtitles and the French dialogue. As in any study that involves reading a translated text, sensitivity to cultural and linguistic differences is key here.\n\nYour participation in the course will be participatory, which will include daily contributions to classroom discussion and an individual or group presentation, as well as analytical, which you will demonstrate in writing assignments. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to better appreciate French queer film, French film in general, and queer film in general. And maybe you’ll end up being fluent in French….\n\nHUHC 20D (H1) ENLIGHTENMENT!\n\nProfessor Terry Godlove, Philosophy\n\nMW 12:50-2:15\n\nCRN: 92237\n\nMany of us have been taught that something of world-historical significance happened in Europe in the eighteenth century—a victory of reason over superstition, freedom over tyranny, science over religion. In a word, Enlightenment. But is that an accurate picture? Contemporary critics claim the Enlightenment’s legacy is one of exploitation, dehumanization, colonialism, and the loss of human dignity. In this course, we will examine the work of Immanuel Kant, one of the Enlightenment’s chief spokesmen. Among other works we will read his, Critique of Pure Reason (1781, 1787), which clears the way for his claim that persons must never be treated simply as means to ends. This claim looms large in history, as it helped shape the Declaration of Independence, the Gettysburg Address, and the United Nations charter. We will see that Kant was decidedly ambivalent about the prospects for enlightenment, and that he anticipated many of its contemporary critics, even as he championed its values. Some background in philosophy recommended.\n\n(The chair of the Philosophy department has indicated this course may be counted as a Philosophy elective toward the completion of Philosophy requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20G (H1) FAMILY LAW, HISTORY, AND CULTURE\n\nProfessor Herbie DiFonza, School of Law\n\nTR 11:10-12:45PM\n\nCRN: 93517\n\nThe course will study the dramatic changes in American family formation in the 20th and 21st centuries: the demise of the “traditional” two-parent family; the rise in cohabitation, single parenthood, and same-sex partnerships; and the coming-of-age in surrogacy and assisted reproductive technologies. The course would begin with the post-World War II family and trace the cultural evolution from Leave It to Beaver to Modern Family. The approach would blend history, law, and social science data, focusing on the contrast between marriage and cohabitation as the starting point for a family, and an analysis on how our society is shifting to a functional redefinition of the family, with significant cultural consequences.\n\nHUHC 20C (H1) ANALYZING THE 2016 ELECTIONS Professor Andrea Libresco, Education (Social Studies) and Center for Civic Engagement TR 12:45-2:10PM CRN: 92234\n\nThis course examines the process of electing a president in 2016 and in historical perspective. Participants will investigate and assess the nominating procedure; the candidates’ stands on the issues of our time; the roles that media, money, parties, debates, advertisements, and the Internet play; the influence of race, class and gender on both voters and candidates; and the domestic and foreign policy challenges that the new president and Congress will face. Attention will be given to the ways in which citizens participate in the political process and to their quest for the kinds of reliable knowledge that are necessary to make informed judgments.\n\nHUHC 20A (H1) INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION: CAUSES, EFFECTS, AND RESPONSES Professor Tina Mavirkos-Adamou, Political Science MW 12:50-2:10PM CRN: 90758\n\nThis seminar will focus on the causes, effects, and responses to international migration and the relationship between the international legal environment and that of the nation-state where these crises play out domestically. The course will begin by defining the legal differences between economic migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers, and move on to discuss various humanitarian crises that have resulted from large-scale migration and displacement. Cases of mass migration will be selected for examination representing several regions of the world, including Central America, Southeast Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. The ongoing Syrian crisis, considered to be the worst humanitarian crisis of the 21st century, will be taken up as a case study representing the complexities and challenges brought on by large-scale forced migration. As of January 2016, the Syrian war has resulted in more than 11 million Syrians either being killed or forced to flee their homes, representing half of the country’s pre-war population. This unprecedented movement of people poses formidable challenges for both the international community in responding adequately to this humanitarian crisis, and for nation-states receiving such large numbers of people. These and other related issues surrounding international migration will be discussed throughout the course.\n\n(The chair of the Political Science department has indicated this course may be counted as a Political Science elective toward the completion of Political Science requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20H (H1) MUSIC AND THE MOVING IMAGE\n\nProfessor Jonathan Waxman, Music TR 11:10-12:35 CRN: 93518\n\nSince the beginning of motion pictures, music has been a significant part of explaining the action on screen. Today, music is incorporated in far more media than just contemporary films, playing a major role in television shows, commercials and video games. This course will begin by covering the history of film music beginning with silent films and then continue by examining current trends in film scoring techniques, including the use of popular and original songs, and preexisting music in more recent films and television shows, and analyzing the different ways music is used in commercials and video games over the past three decades.\n\nHUHC 20E (H1) DESIGNER DRUGS: CHEMISTRY AND BEYOND Professor Ling Huang, Chemistry MW 2:55-4:20 CRN: 92238\n\nDesigner drugs such as “Spice”, “Bath Salts” and “Molly” have spread rapidly around the world in the past decade. In order to avoid law enforcement, the manufacturers of these synthetic compounds keep adjusting formulas to stay in the legal gray area. On the other hand, many users are unware of the dangers that are associated with these poorly-controlled products with unknown chemical identities, resulting in increased emergency room visits and high-profile incidents frequently reported in the media. Law enforcement and legislative bodies throughout the world struggle to keep pace with the changing nature of designer drugs. In this course, students will learn the chemistry behind the synthesis of these drugs, the analytical methods used for the detection and quantification (some done at Hofstra), toxicological effects, and the chemical challenges facing law enforcement and legislations.\n\nNo previous background in chemistry is needed as layman terms and Lego-block analogy will be used to describe the chemical reactions. In the seminar relevant laws, war on drugs, web 2.0, silk road, social media’s roles will be discussed. Majority of the reading materials will NOT be on Chemistry, rather on the overall phenomenon of designer drugs. Honor students are encouraged to think about the complex societal impacts designer drug causes and learn the instructor’s perspective as a chemist\n\nHUHC 021A (H1) SERIOUSLY?: WHAT IS TRULY IMPORTANT? – LOOKING AT MEDIA HYPE, ISSUES, AND NON-ISSUES\n\nProfessor Ellen Frisina, Public Relations TR 12:45-2:10PM CRN 92235\n\nAre you “too sensitive”?\n\nOn the one hand, much has been written about your generation suggesting you are too sensitive and overly aware of “feeling hurt” by words and –isms. On the other hand, some believe that your generation has the moxey and ambition to rid the world of prejudice and bias.\n\nSo, are you “too sensitive” or “highly aware”?\n\nThis course will look at popular books, magazine articles, internet sites and television shows that focus on whether we are becoming “wimps” or “renegades.” We will look at what many say is the reason behind this – the 24-hour news cycle that “hypes” issues like Snowmageddon or political discourse or “reality” TV – and turns what may be a non-issue into another reason to rail against societal wrongs. The spread of information is a major focus of this issue as your generation knows more, sees more, is hyper-aware of your world (which is quickly shrinking, as well, because of this). Is it “TMI” or an important concern?\n\nOne need only watch a few episodes of The Daily Show or Talk Soup to see one side of the story – making mountains out of molehills. On the other side, one can point to several organized and effective campaigns by college students to change the status quo – many may say the Supreme Court decision about gay marriage is a result of your generation arguing that the world “needs to change.”\n\nSeveral well-documented protests on college campuses highlight how your generation is “hyper-sensitive” to words and actions. Every issue from Halloween costumes to graduation speakers has taken on the mantle of freedom of speech – with both sides arguing that not only do words matter, but also the meaning of words has changed. Again, is it over-sensitivity or focused analysis of a wrong?\n\nAccording to a recent article in The Atlantic titled “The Coddling of the American Mind”, “….college students are increasingly demanding protection from words and ideas they don’t like.” Is this good or bad? Let’s decide together with some deep critical analysis of both sides of this issue (or non-issue!)\n\n(The chair of the Public Relations department has indicated this course may be counted as an elective toward the completion of PR, JRNL and Media Studies requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nSpring 2016 HUHC SEMINARS\n\nHUHC 20A (H1) DOUBLES IN LITERATURE\n\nProfessor Susan Lorsch, English\n\nTR 11:10am – 12:35pm\n\nBreslin 202\n\nCRN: 22487\n\nNarrative and the Idea of the Double: The notion of the divided self is deeply embedded in Western conceptions of identity--whether the parts of the self represent such easy divisions as \"good\" and \"evil\" or more subtle distinctions between ego and superego or between the subconscious and the conscious. Writers of fiction and filmmakers use ideas of the double or \"doppelganger\" to reflect psychological struggle and to explore the relationship of the self to the self and to the world outside the self. In narrative literature and film, one's shadow-self--whether mischievous, malicious, friendly or forbidding--appears as a reflection of a crisis in identity and offers its alter ego the opportunity for self-exploration. This course will examine some of the ways narratives have explored identity and probed human psychology through the use of the double. In addition to investigating the tales that are told, we will also be studying the variety of techniques fiction and film employ in order simultaneously to demonstrate and embody the divisions and conflicts, the complexities of desire, within the self. Emphasis will be on class discussion and analysis; thus, class attendance and participation, along with written work, will figure significantly in final grades.\n\n(The chair of the English department has indicated this course may be counted as a English elective toward the completion of English requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20B (H1) FIRST AMENDMENT IN MEDIA AND LAW\n\nProfessor Akilah Folami, Hofstra University School of Law\n\nMW 9:05am – 10:30am\n\nBreslin 203\n\nCRN: 20449\n\nThe First Amendment to the United States Constitution states, “Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press....” The objective of this course is to give students a solid grounding in the Constitutional principles of free speech and free press; the limits of the government’s authority to prevent or punish the reporting of information by traditional journalist, blogger, FB poster and the like; and the rights of reporters to access and confidentiality in newsgathering. The course will also explain the law of defamation, copyright, freedom of information, privacy, the regulation of radio, TV, cable and the Internet as it relates to the rights of expression in the U.S. and other legal concerns important to journalists, broadcasters, advertisers, and bloggers.\n\nHUHC 20C (H1) GODEL, ESCHER, BACH\n\nProfessor Charles Anderson, Psychology\n\nTR 4:30pm – 5:55pm\n\nADAMS 212\n\nCRN: 21360\n\nDo you watch the \"Big Bang Theory\"? Have you wondered whether our digital world will end with a bang, a whimper, or singularity? Did you know that the first computer was named \"Maniac\"? Have you heard of Alan Turing and the Enigma Code? These questions and others will be answered when we read and discuss the provocative book \"Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid,\" which explores the inter-relationship of math, music, and art. One paper, one oral presentation, and a lot of interesting discussion.\n\nHUHC 020D (H1) GREEK TRAGEDY IN LITERATURE AND PERFORMANCE\n\nProfessor Ilaria Marchesi, Comparative Languages and Literature\n\nProfessor Christopher Dippel, Drama\n\nMW 12:50pm – 2:15pm\n\nGALWG 0014\n\nCRN: 20450\n\nIn this co-taught seminar we study Greek Tragedy both as literary text and as performance. In addition to reading, discussing and writing about the texts, students will prepare a performance as one of the class projects.\n\n(The chairs of the Classics program and Drama have indicated this course may be counted as a Classics or Drama elective toward the completion of Classics or Drama requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20E (H1) GUIDES TO LIVING\n\nProfessor Ira Singer, Philosophy\n\nTR 11:10am – 12:35pm\n\nGALGW 0014\n\nCRN: 23717\n\nWhat is the most effective path to a tranquil and satisfying life? Three ancient Greek philosophical movements aimed to answer this question. The Stoics advocated relying on reason, and making a sharp distinction between our lack of control over what happens in the world and our complete control over our own attitudes and efforts. The Skeptics advocated a practice of developing strong arguments on both sides of every issue, leading to the obliteration of all firm beliefs, and then to an untroubled, natural way of living. The Epicureans advocated a life devoted to pleasure, but to pleasure of a modest and durable kind; they preferred quiet friendship and frugal meals over great passions and riotous revels. These so-called Hellenistic philosophical schools fell out of favor for a millennium after the fall of the Western Roman empire, but became influential again at the start of the modern era, when figures like Montaigne, Spinoza, and Hume mixed and matched doctrines from the Stoics, Skeptics, and Epicureans. In our own time important philosophers (like Martha Nussbaum, especially in her work *The Therapy of Desire*) have been inspired by the seriousness and ingenuity with which the Hellenistic philosophers addressed the most profound human concerns. This course will examine ancient, early modern, and contemporary texts, aiming to develop and evaluate Stoic, Skeptical, and Epicurean perspectives on life and its challenges.\n\n(The chair of the Philosophy department has indicated this course may be counted as a Philosophy elective toward the completion of Philosophy requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20F (H1) MEDIEVAL SEX\n\nProfessor Alfonso Garcia-Osuna, Romance Languages and Literatures\n\nMW 9:05am – 10:30am\n\nLOWE 203\n\nCRN: 23718\n\nSex and gender are intimately connected to each other throughout history, and the medieval era (roughly 500 to 1500 C.E.) played a critical role in the construction of modern Western sexual and gendered identities. It can be argued as well that many of our ideas about modern love originated in the narratives of medieval romance literature, where there is also a rich tradition of the creative subversion of traditional gender and sex roles. Located at the boundary between the biological and the cultural, human sexuality has been feared for its radical potential to disrupt various structures of human order- and meaning-making, and has been assumed to be a central key to understanding human nature and identity. Through readings of various medieval texts (literary and otherwise), as well as critical readings in body, gender, and sexuality studies, we will explore the critical role of sexuality in shaping the Western human subject and its radical powers for disrupting and transforming bodies and selves over time. By way of making some cross-temporal connections between the medieval world and our own, we will also view some contemporary films such as Cuba’s Strawberry and Chocolate(1993) that explore, in complex fashion, various themes of sexuality and sexual identity. As this is a seminar-style course, preparing for and participating in class are vitally important to your ultimate success, and therefore, your contribution to in-class discussions as well as your attendance record will be factored into your final grade. Although I will provide much guidance and commentary, the students are essentially the\n\ndiscussion leaders of this course. As this is also a reading-intensive course, not keeping up with the reading could be extremely detrimental to your progress and final evaluation. One final (but important) word: coming to class without the text will count as an absence.\n\nHUHC 20H (H1) RITUAL AND PERFORMANCE\n\nProfessor Patricia Hardwick, Anthropology\n\nMW 12:50pm -2:15pm\n\nRSVLT 110\n\nCRN: 24650\n\nAnthropologists, ethnomusicologists, and folklorists acknowledge the importance of the study of the performing arts for the understanding oftraditional systems of healing, alternative histories, cultural memories, gender relations, ethnic identities, political movements, regional conflicts, and religious revival. Drawing on a varied source of ethnographic studies of the performing arts from North America, Latin America, the Caribbean, South Asia, and Southeast Asia, this course will focus on how performers embody cultural knowledge, interpret their experiences, construct their realities, offer cultural critique, resist cultural norms, and even facilitate healing through their performances. Throughout the course we will investigate what these embodied ways of knowing can tell us about the individuals that perform them and their relevance within particular cultures. We will examine the importance of the context of performance, and study what effects rapid cultural change, colonialism, tourism, nationalist movements, and religious revival can have on particular performance forms and traditions. We will also evaluate how issues such as mental and physical health, piety, gender, class, ethnicity, social status, and nationalism can be interpreted, mediated and expressed through performance and the performing arts. A series of demonstrations and workshops will be arranged with local performance groups as part of the class in order to allow students to experience and document how cultural knowledge can be embodied through he learning of particular performance forms. A significant portion of the theoretical work that addresses the performing arts as embodied knowledge has been based on ethnographic studies of Latin American and Caribbean music and dance. This literature stresses the importance of the study of dance, music, and the body in order to investigate issues of gender, colonialism, violence, rupture, and cultural continuity. The body is emphasized as one aspect of life that the poor and socially oppressed were able to control, thus the music and social dances of the disadvantaged have been viewed as metaphors of their understanding of the colonial experience. Ethnographies of the sacred performance traditions in South Asia and Southeast Asia emphasize the healing and restorative properties of traditional music and theater. Studies of the public performances and multi-vocal retellings of the great epics of the Mahabharata and the Ramayana reveal how individuals in South Asia can use these performances to construct an intimate understanding of themselves and how the well known epics can be recast to emphasize social issues important to the performer. Ethnographies of the performing arts and traditional martial arts of the Muslim majority nations of Indonesia and Malaysia contradict imaginations of Islam as an abstract, undifferentiated, and unchanging religion, and reinforce the understanding that the interpretation and re-interpretations of Islam and Islamic practice is a historical and ongoing process in Muslim Southeast Asia.\n\nHUHC 20I (H1) Black Mountain Culture\n\nProfessor Ron Janssen, Writing Studies\n\nMW 2:55-4:20\n\nRoom: DAVSN 014\n\nCRN: 24651\n\nHave you ever had the experience, even for a moment, of thinking that maybe everything you have ever believed or learned (even in C&E!) might be wrong? If so, you are well positioned to enjoy and benefit from a study of the artists and thinkers associated with Black Mountain College. For example, the design engineer Buckminster (Bucky) Fuller, troubled by the distortions in our customary representations of the world (globes, Mercator maps – you probably have had them in every schoolroom), set about to invent his own Dymaxion map. Looking for a way to provide affordable housing for people around the world, he invented the geodesic dome. Charles Olson, dissatisfied with what he saw as the shortcomings in the Greco-Roman traditions of Western thought, turned for correctives to prehistory and Mayan culture. Robert Rauschenberg made paintings with no images and even went so far as to buy and erase a drawing by a famous contemporary. John Cage composed music with no sound. Merce Cunningham used chance operations to replace carefully designed programs of traditional choreography. All of these people were a chief influence on American culture 1950-1975 and beyond. In this course, you will study the writing, visual art, music, dance, and social and scientific developments of this fascinating group of people in order to identify something that we might call “Black Mountain Culture.” In the spirit of Black Mountain College itself, your work will be highly independent of traditional strictures, meaning that term projects will be of your own design (with as much help from me as you want and need) and focused in fields of your own interest. If you have ever wanted to build a geodesic dome before, maybe you will now – or invent your own design. Who will like this course? Arts and science and communications students endowed with curiosity, intuition, and creative imagination.

While defeated soundly in military terms, heightened Irish nationalist mobilization in its aftermath brought about some but not all of these changes. The Easter Rising demonstrates the power of vision and acts of sacrifice. It also shows how one event can simultaneously galvanize and divide a population. As a historic event, the Easter Rising provides a lens through which we can interpret the present and chart a course for the future. The 100th anniversary of the Rising provides us with an opportunity to reflect upon the contemporary implications of the Easter Rising and related events. What, if any, lessons does the Easter Rising hold for the peace process in Northern Ireland, transatlantic relations and the role of the Diaspora in Irish affairs, European and global integration, economic and fiscal crises, class inequalities, growing ethnic diversity, the status of women, environmental challenges, and church-state relations? This course draws upon a wide range of disciplinary lenses to answer these important questions.\n\n(The Directors of the Irish Studies Program have indicated that this course may be counted as an elective toward the completion of requirements for Irish Studies minors.)

We will consider how authors create worlds within which characters conform, rebel, or otherwise do their best to survive and thrive within the parameters set by their creators. We will draw on cognitive psychology and narrative theory in order to understand how story-tellers, by tapping into the mind’s capacity to create maps and models of reality, create the fictional worlds that transport and shape us.\n\nLiterary Texts:\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, The Tempest\n\nEdgar Allan Poe, “The Fall of the House of Usher”\n\nLewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland\n\nFrank L.

The class will begin with a brief introduction to contemporary international law and its use and relevance to contemporary international relations. It will then consider China’s use and treatment of international law with respect to a variety of contemporary global issues including: the use of military force to intervene for humanitarian reasons, the protection of foreign investment, and the settlement of maritime and territorial disputes.\n\nOver the past forty years, China has gone from one of the poorest and most isolated countries in the world to one of the leading and most influential nations in the world. As the world’s largest economy (and carbon emitter), and as the second largest military power, China’s impact on the rest of world is, and will continue to be, huge in areas as diverse as international trade, use of military force, the response to climate change, the rise of transnational terrorist groups, and the promotion of human rights.\n\nAs China has continued to rise in global power and influence, the use of international law as a mechanism for regulating and limiting the actions of nation-states has come under strain. While international institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organizations continue to promote the use of international law, scholars and policymakers have questioned the efficacy and importance of international law as a factor in international relations. Moreover, the relative decline of United States economic and military power compared to nations like China have called into question the future viability of international institutions that the U.S. has long supported.\n\nFor these reasons, there is little doubt that “the rise of China” is one of the most important factors in the future of international law.\n\nHUHC 20C (H1) 100 OBJECTS: DO WE OWN THINGS OR DO THEY OWN US?\n\nProfessor Sophie Hawkins, Religion\n\nMW 2:55-4:20\n\nCRN: 92556\n\nIn this seminar we will examine our relationship to the things that surround us—from seemingly mundane household items (e.g. the table, the cardboard box) to treasured keepsakes (e.g. love letters) to city monuments (e.g. Statue of Liberty). Through fieldwork and a case study approach we will learn about the often surprising historical and cultural formations that underpin both the objects themselves and our relationships with them. We will question whether we are in fact defined by the things we own/consume/collect, and if so whether it then makes sense to talk about the agency of inanimate things. We will be reading widely from contemporary scholars of material culture, anthropologists, poets, and essayists, and we will be visiting several museums in NYC. The end goal of the seminar will be to collaboratively create a digital cabinet of curiosities of 100 objects whose stories we can tell.\n\n(The chair of the Religion Department has indicated this course may be counted as a Religion elective toward the completion of Religion requirements for majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 020D (H1) SCIENCE AND SOCIETY: CLASHES AND COLLABORATIONS\n\nProfessor Sabrina Sobel, Chemistry\n\nMW 2:55-4:20\n\nCRN: 92560\n\nThroughout history, the pursuit of knowledge has been influenced by the prevailing culture.

We will also study the research methods, writing techniques, and biography of the creator and show runner Aaron Sorkin. Of the numerous policies, laws, and achievements of the Bartlett administration on The West Wing, some have come to pass in our federal government and some have not. We will trace these domestic and foreign policy issues, analyze their portrayal on the show, and gauge any effect the show itself has had on policy successes or failures. At the same time we will reveal the ingenious writing, production, and overall creative process that made The West Wing one of the greatest dramas in the history of television. This course combines aspects of TV Writing and Production, Political Science, and Civics.\n\n(The chair of the RTVF department has indicated this course may be counted as a Television elective toward the completion of requirements for Television/Video majors or minors.)\n\nHUHC 20F (H1) HOW HAS THE LYNDON B. JOHSON PRESIDENCY INFLUENCED AMERICAN POLITICS IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY?\n\nProfessor Meena Bose, Political Science\n\nTR 12:45-2:10\n\nCRN: 92558\n\nThis honors seminar will examine the political leadership and legacy of President Lyndon B. Johnson. Fifty years after Johnson signed the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965, an evaluation of Johnson’s presidential record and continuing debates about those policies is timely and necessary.
