        "text": "The theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author Stephen Hawking is no more. One of the most renowned scientists of all time died at his home at the age of 76, his family told the UK media.\n\nHawking had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicated using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device.\n\nWhile there are numerous TV series based on him and his work, we have listed down his five of the best films that were based on this genius.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Theory of Everything (2014)\n\nThe film focuses on his relationship with ex-wife Jane Wilde. It was directed by James Marsh and is adapted from the memoir ‘Travelling to Infinity: My Life with Stephen’ written by Jane herself. The book dealt with her relationship with her ex-husband, the theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking, his diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and his success in physics.\n\nHawking (2013)\n\nHawking is a documentary film, directed by Stephen Finnigan which featured Hawking himself describing his life from childhood, his struggle with ALS and his later recognition as a world-famous scientist.\n\nHawking (2004)\n\nHawking (2004) is a BBC television film directed by Philip Martin. The film is about Hawking’s early years as a PhD student at Cambridge University, following his search for the beginning of time and his struggle against ALS. It was nominated for Best Single Drama in the BAFTA TV Awards in 2005.\n\nA Brief History of Time (1991)\n\nA Brief History of Time, directed by Errol Morris, is a biographical documentary film. The film features interviews with family members, colleagues, and even his childhood nanny. A Brief History of Time received largely positive reviews.\n\nBeyond the Horizon (2009)\n\nThis documentary Beyond the Horizon follows a reporter who needs to write a feature story about cosmology and the meaning of existence. Her interview with Hawking sets her on a journey through time and space."
