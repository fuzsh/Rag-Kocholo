Stephen Finnigan's film about Professor Stephen Hawking is a heartfelt tribute to the most famous scientist of our times, and Hawking's remarkable career is well summarised: the brilliant young Oxford academic who was struck down with a degenerative disease in his early 20s, told he only had a few years to live, but survived as a legendary wheelchair user to develop new theories of the universe and to write a bestselling popular study of theoretical physics: A Brief History of Time, now enjoying its 25th anniversary.

It's inevitable that a general-interest feature like this should fail to explain his theories in detail. But I would have liked this film to air some heretical questions, some swearing-in-church questions, if only in a devil's-advocate way: has Hawking's disability inflated his reputation as a scientist? Is there any evidence that his bestseller was actually read all that thoroughly? Hawking emerges from this as an inspirational man; with such a colossus, Finnigan could have afforded to be more questioning.
