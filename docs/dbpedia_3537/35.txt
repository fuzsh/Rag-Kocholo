The theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and author Stephen Hawking is no more. One of the most renowned scientists of all time died at his home at the age of 76, his family told the UK media.

Hawking had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) that gradually paralysed him over the decades. He communicated using a single cheek muscle attached to a speech-generating device.

While there are numerous TV series based on him and his work, we have listed down his five of the best films that were based on this genius.
