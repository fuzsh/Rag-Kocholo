        "text": "This page was edited by Christina Luciak, Jonathon Brady-Patry, Shawn Lank, Christopher Sandor and Daphne Cockerill.\n\nThe 21st Century Classroom\n\nTechnology plays a large part in 21st century learning, and handheld devices in the classroom are enabling this shift to happen. Teachers are trying to find educational ways of allowing students to responsibly use their handheld devices in the classroom as well as Pedagogical communities are turning to mobile technologies for innovative learning methods. A variety of mobile handhelds are personalized and flexible and allow students to collaborate with others and synthesize information with their learning environment.\n\nA 2013 study by TRU, supports handhelds for learning - \"...if we meet children where they are we can leverage their use of mobile devices for powerful learning...Mobile technology can inspire and engage students by letting them lead their learning and supporting them in choosing and using the devices they know, love, and prefer,\" says Lisa Nielsen in The Innovative Educator.\n\nOpenColleges graphically represents what they say a 21st century classroom might look like.\n\nWhat is a Handheld Device and How Does it Fit into our Lives?\n\nA handheld device (also known as a handheld computer, handheld, mobile internet device or mobile device) is \"a small, hand-held computing device, typically having a display screen with touch input and/or a miniature keyboard and weighing less than 2 pounds (0.91 kg).\" See: mobile device.\n\nWhat is a mobile phone? What does it mean to be mobile?\n\nHow is the internet used to communicate?\n\nHow are mobile devices changing our lives?\n\nEvolving Quickly over Time\n\n\"Ubiquitous computing names the third wave in computing, just now beginning. First were mainframes, each shared by lots of people. Now we are in the personal computing era, person and machine staring uneasily at each other across the desktop. Next comes ubiquitous computing, or the age of calm technology, when technology recedes into the background of our lives.\" (Mark Weiser, 1988)\n\nBefore internet web browsing, handheld use in the classroom was limited and used primarily for word processing, file organization and computing math. Since 2000, the evolution in the design and capability of handheld devices has grown exponentially. Opportunities for both educators and students is continually emerging with the ability to connect instantaneously and from any location. In 2012, Google stated, \"Up to 70% of Canadians use mobile devices.\"\n\nPopular Handheld Devices (1990-1999)\n\nPsion Series 3\n\nNewton MessagePad 100\n\nPalm Pilot\n\nIBM WorkPad\n\nPopular Handheld Devices (2000-2013)\n\nDell Axim\n\nBlackberry\n\nAndroid (i.e. Samsung_Galaxy_S_III)\n\niPhone\n\nKindle Fire\n\nNintendo DS\n\nT-Mobile Sidekick\n\niPad\n\niPod Touch\n\nBlack 5th Generation iPod Touch 2012\n\nPushing the Boundaries of Traditional Classrooms\n\nEducational Applications (Apps) for Hand Held Devices\n\nMany of today’s instructors allow the use of handheld devices, tablet computers, smart phones and laptops in the classroom to enable students to participate in their own learning. IPads for example, allow teachers to \"...have paperless classrooms, take attendance, share interactive presentations and test their students\"\n\nLearn more about types of handheld devices enhancing the learning environment\n\nWatch a video of Travis Christensen, Educational Technology Assistant at Crowder College, as he discusses various educational applications for handheld devices. (approx. 1 hour)\n\nImage retrieved from: http://www.publicdomainpictures.net/view-image.php?image=14816&picture=teenager-with-smartphone\n\nLearning Theories\n\n\"One definition that captures the dual perspectives of learner mobility and learning with portable technology is: Any sort of learning that happens when the learner is not at a fixed, predetermined location, or learning that happens when the learner takes advantage of the learning opportunities offered by mobile technologies. (O'Malley et al., 2003)\"\n\nFind more information about learning using mobile and handheld devices.\n\nK3-K7 Classrooms\n\nIn the K-3 classroom, the iPad or tablet computer is very effective. The iPad is visually stimulating, intuitive and has hundreds of educational applications. iPad carts in schools ensure students in a classroom all have access to the devices. iPads are replacing books saving money for schools and keeping information current.\n\nIn the K-4 to K-7 classrooms, laptop computers and iPads are equally useful. Many students use these devices to engage in blogging activities as well as produce and research work. A students' learning shifts towards connectivity and collaboration with peers using handhelds devices {quote}.\n\nSecondary School\n\nAt the secondary level, students in the classrooms use tablets, laptops as well as smart phones. Students gradually use these devices more in classrooms as more teachers embrace the use of handhelds to support learning. In the classroom, smart phones:\n\nAccess the internet.\n\nTake pictures of assignments or notes.\n\nRecord language orals.\n\nText to replace student response systems such as “the clicker”.\n\nLaptop computers are being used in much the same manner to connect with peers as well as produce work. iPads can help students:\n\nCreate videos and presentations.\n\nAccess the internet.\n\nConnect with other students.\n\nPost Secondary\n\nFree wireless service and downloads of customized apps encourage students to access university resources such libraries, registration, and faculty. UCLA (University of California, Los Angeles) states that \"three-fourths of all college/university students have purchased or intend to purchase an Internet-enabled handheld device within the next year.[1]\n\nMing Nie, from the University of Leicester, states in his article, \"Mobile/handheld devices are used in the following areas to support teaching/learning:\n\nStudents record interviews with informants.\n\nStudents record their own works e.g. oral examination, oral report, presentation, group discussion, etc. for tutor evaluation, peer evaluation, and self-evaluation.\n\nStudents listen to authentic audio materials e.g. music, speech, interview, vocabulary, audio book, poem, etc.\n\nStudents access multimedia materials e.g. movie, painting, photograph, documentary, visual glossary, etc.\n\nStudents refer to preloaded information in a field trip or field study.\n\nStudents produce their multimedia presentation, assignment, and project.\"\n\nDistance Learning\n\nStudents doing distance learning can use mobile devices to access their course resources while commuting, from work or from home.\n\nSee: Handhelds in distance and online education.\n\nStudents doing homeschooling also use mobile devices.\n\nEducational Applications (Apps) for Hand Held Devices\n\nLearn more about types of handheld devices enhancing the learning environment\n\nWatch a video of Travis Christensen, Educational Technology Assistant at Crowder College, as he discusses various educational applications for handheld devices.\n\nImage on the right retrieved from: http://theinnovativeeducator.blogspot.ca/2013/02/finally-research-based-proof-that.html\n\nBenefits and Challenges of Handheld Devices in Classrooms\n\nBenefits\n\nFlexible and convenient - allows the student to access information anywhere, anytime.\n\nPortable - students can use the devices in any classroom as well as outside of the classroom.\n\nCommunity - allows students to connect with each other and can reinforce integration of different curriculum.\n\nCommunication - students, teachers and parents are able to connect instantaneously.\n\nSupport - handheld devices can enable and support those students who have learning difficulties.\n\nFeatures - applications such as GPS\n\nChallenges\n\nCulture - while the culture of schools is changing in some classrooms handheld devices are still not allowed.\n\nControl - handheld devices in the classroom mean giving up control in the classroom and this is worrisome for some.\n\nAccess - equal access to devices will always be a challenge in schools especially when students are asked to bring their own device.\n\nConnectivity - to use handheld devices effectively in the classroom wireless connectivity in schools will be required.\n\nEngagement - while handheld devices can help engage in the classroom they can also serve as distraction for some.\n\nResources\n\nHandheld Devices in the 21st Century Classroom ([2]Video) by Rob Theriault\n\nEducational Kids Apps for iPhone, iPod and iPad (2010) ABCya.com.
