        "text": "I know Steve has mentioned software that he uses to image his system, I don't recall that software and I don't remember if the software he uses does what I'm looking for.\n\nI would like to automate a weekly/monthly/etc 'image/snapshot' that I can manually save to network storage after the ISO/Image file has been created on the PC that I am imaging.\n\nI'd like to be able to easily recover this image if needed. Here is my current scenario. My PC was running fine, something happened (not sure what, exactly) and a certain program stopped functioning, but it had been working the previous day. I didn't do any updated, but between that program working and not working, windows rebooted with updates. I assume something with the update was the issue for this program to stop functioning. Anyway, I decided a system restore would be the best option and attempted to restore to the previous restore point but that didn't seem to work and I got stuck with a generic blue screen message and an auto repair failed.\n\nThis was not a mission critical PC and reinstalling windows and a few apps was not a big deal, but it did take some time and getting things adjusted to how I like took longer than I thought it would have/should have, which is why I'm looking for imaging software.\n\nFree is always good, but I don't mind paying for something if the cost is reasonable as long as it isn't subscription based.\n\nI know I can use something like clonezilla, but I don't think that it something that I can run in the OS. I'm looking for a windows based program that can see my C drive and make an exact copy of the drive and with the exported/created file, I can keep a local copy on my computer in addition to me creating a manual backup. In my scenario, I don't make many changes to this specific PC, even if I had a 6 month old image, using that for recovery would have worked, but I plan to create an image at least once a month.\n\nThanks.\n\nHere are a few thoughts from someone who's better with talking about backups than doing them.\n\nFirst, this list of @Steve 's favorite stuff here on this forum is probably more up to date than the wiki mentioned.\n\nThe aforementioned Jungledisk recommendation is probably a bit dated, although I still use it from @Steve 's recommendation years ago. JD made some changes in management and pricing that I didn't like.\n\nNote that in this favorite stuff list, Sync Thing and sync.com are mentioned.\n\nBacking up a Windows drive while running can be problematical. Sometimes open files won't copy properly. Windows has a volume shadow copy service that tries to fix this. Note also that if your backup drive, or network share, is always attached, then a virus could get in and destroy not only your system drive but also the backup.\n\nThe BEST way, but the least convenient, to run a backup is to shut down the system and then run the backup with a utility or hardware. It's a good idea to check your drive for errors before backing it up.\n\nIf you IMAGE a drive, that means you copy all the data on the drive with a utility like Image for Windows, Clonezilla, etc., generally compress it but not always, and place this giant 1 TB etc. blob somewhere on a storage device or network. The blob may be broken into pieces if needed depending on the storage. Note that, in the modern world, CD's and DVD's are pretty worthless for this as even a BluRay DVD only stores about 50 GB. 1 TB is 1000 GB. If you need to restore the image, you have to run the utility somehow, either from a CD or USB drive for example. You then have to get access to the blob(s). That might be relatively easy if the storage is directly attached to the PC and might be harder if it's on a network share. Then you'll have to decompress the blob and restore it to your system drive, which will OVERWRITE what's there. It will retrograde the system to the date of the backup, unless you restore to a new blank drive. YOU WILL LOSE all new data unless you restore to a new blank drive and save the system drive that failed. Yes, I'm being repetitive. A properly restored image should restore the OS and data and create a bootable system.\n\nIt's always a good idea to choose the setting to verify that the blob matches the source drive after the backup and better yet to do a test restore to a junk drive to make sure the restore works.\n\nIf you CLONE a drive, that means you've created an exact identical backup drive. This can be problematical if you end up with the two identical drives, including ID numbers, on the system at the same time. This can confuse the OS as to which drive it's booting from. In that case, you want to shut down the whole system after making a backup and remove the backup drive. Then boot from the main system drive and make sure it's happy.\n\nIf you've cloned your drive, then bringing your backup online is easy peazy. Just remove your bad system drive and clearly label it. Put in your cloned backup drive, boot up and go. You will still be missing any data past the date of the backup. You should be able to put the original system drive which went bad in an external USB enclosure and transfer data which had accumulated since the backup. If you swap too many system PC pieces too fast, Windows can get snarky about licensing if it finds itself waking up in too many different \"PC's\". Usually hard drive swaps are not a problem.\n\nMay favorite backup method, which fatal flaw is I don't do it often enough, is to use a hard drive cloner dock.\n\nThis is a physical device which copies SATA hard drives. You shut down your system, remove the hard drive, CLEARLY LABEL IT as SOURCE, and put in the SOURCE slot of the dock. You TRIPLE check that you have the SOURCE drive in the SOURCE slot. Then you put your BACKUP drive, which may look identical, but which should also be clearly labeled, into the BACKUP or DESTINATION slot. WHATEVER drive is in the BACKUP or DESTINATION slot WILL BE ERASED. Once your comfy with it, press the CLONE button and walk away for 5 hours or so. When it's done, you should have two identical drives.\n\nBoot up the backup drive and test it. If all is good, shut it down and stash it away.\n\nReinstall your source drive in your computer and boot it and test it then continue your work.\n\nAn online backup is an excellent way to continually backup data that changes between your image or clone backups.\n\nHope all that helps. Saying all this is one thing and doing it is another.\n\nMay your bits be stable and your interfaces be fast. Ron\n\n`don't know if I mentioned this in a thread prior. RFrazier's comment on online backup and virus infection causes me to post the note.\n\nYes, locally attached live (online) backup destinations do hold risk of being compromised (virus / malware or perhaps electronic power spike). In scant little research on virus / malware infection I have read that they (typically?) look for drive-letter-access to files. Yes, this can readily change by the programmer of a virus / malware and is not set in stone. In that, some backup programs can access a locally attached physical device via volume ID as well as the typical drive letter.\n\nSyncBack (Free) [by 2BrightSparks] is one of these programs where I use the Volume ID method fairly frequently. It's also handy when desiring to ALWAYS backup to one physical USB attached device no matter if its driver letter changes.* The Windows Workstation service needs to be running for this feature to be used (EDIT: I tested this on a Win11 system and Workstation service was NOT required - I specifically disabled / stopped the service and restarted - verified off - volumeID access worked as desired). The command prompt MountVol program is handy to see the volume ID for a particular drive letter. DiskMgmt.msc is used to REMOVE a drive letter from a volume - the drive disappears from being visible in Explorer (and hopefully any malware that might infect a system).\n\nFor usage, where SyncBack might backup to H:\\BackupStuff I run MountVol and see that H: has a volume ID of \"\\\\?\\Volume{f645fa49-cd6d-11e7-9bd0-806e6f6e6963}\\\" I substitute the volume ID in place of \"H:\\\". I then run a backup, while the volume is visible via drive H and when all looks good I'll use DiskMgmt.msc to remove the drive letter from the volume. I might then re-run a backup to ensure it works as desired.\n\nH:\\BackupStuff\n\n\\\\?\\Volume{f645fa49-cd6d-11e7-9bd0-806e6f6e6963}\\BackupStuff\n\n* Sometimes a client might have a desire to use a USB attached flash drive for a small backup (quickbooks company file perhaps) but the drive letter might change. Using the volume ID method offers a reliable backup option no matter what drive letter the device is given at mount.\n\nRFrazier - A consideration on your consistent image backup comment. Consider adding a \"set-it-and-(mostly)-forget-it\" software image backup scheduled task into the system. Have the image backup drop to a local device that's always available. Perhaps weekly or maybe only 2x per month. No, it's not an offline bare metal backup but it's an easy thing to set and have it out there. You can still tend your bare metal clone when you get to it. Should something bad happen, the online local image file is but an extra option to help out of a jam if your bare metal is older than you desire.\n\nI'm finding this configuration of use with systems that have a solid state drive (OS) plus mechanical storage drive (often a small SSD for OS and larger mechanical for data). If the mechanical data drive has ample free space, I shrink its partition by a bit more than the size of the SSD and create an \"Z: OS-Backup\" volume at the tail end of the mechanical drive. I'll then have Macrium Reflect or Windows Image do a weekly backup to this volume (often labeled at the end of the alphabet). I don't bother doing any specific \"backup\" of this backup volume - though it could easily be backed up by any file backup program as the files are not in use. Should the main OS be damaged (OS corruption / virus / drive failure), I boot from either a Windows setup device to restore the image or boot from a Macrium Reflect boot device to restore the backup. FWIW"
