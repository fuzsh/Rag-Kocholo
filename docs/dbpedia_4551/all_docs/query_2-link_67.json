VerroneTranscribed byJasonbres\n\n[Opening Credits.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot of Citihall. A banner under the now dated logo reads \"e-Waste Not, e-Want Not\". A huge crowd is gathered outside as Mayor C. Randall Poopenmeyer makes a speech.]\n\n[The camera cuts to the crowd, some of whom are carrying old machines like Apple computers from 1984. The camera stops on Bender, Fry, and Leela.]\n\n[Zoidberg is seen with the fin on his head.]\n\n[The fin disappears.]\n\n[They throw them away as the camera pans to Amy, Zoidberg, Leela, and Fry carrying an electronic toilet.]\n\n[Fry drops the toilet in the bin as everyone watches it drop.]\n\n[Cut to: Bender sneaks to a bin in the back of the place and laughs.]\n\n[Bender closes the door on his bearded twin before he can finish the common side effects.]\n\n[Cut to: Mayor Poopenmeyer is having his picture taken as he kisses a little robot and then recycles it.]\n\n[The camera pans to Farnsworth, Leela, Fry, and Bender.]\n\n[The crew gets angry at Farnsworth.]\n\n[Scene: Space. The Planet Express ship flies past the sun and approaches a brown dirty planet.]\n\n[First Caption: Third World]\n\n[Second Caption: Of the Antares System]\n\n[The ship flies into its ring which is composed of all old devices.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot. The ship lands past many smokestacks and coal factories.]\n\n[The camera cuts to a wide shop of the ship which is now stripped down to its wiring frame. Another Antarian is stripping down Bender's cavity.]\n\n[Cut to: A closeup shot of one of the smokestacks. A bird flies through the smoke and becomes a skeleton. The camera pans down to show Fry, Leela and the no longer stripped Bender carrying one of the recycling bins being led by the first Antarian.]\n\n[They stop and break the hover dumpster revealing all the old e-waste. The Antarian takes out a can of flammable oil.]\n\n[He indicates a rather frail looking dog licking from a dirty puddle of water. It pants as its tail becomes dismembered.]\n\n[The kids rummage through the e-waste and cough but still manage to find something shiny.]\n\n[Leela opens the cell phone to reveal that it is an old rotary cell phone.]\n\n[Morbo is seen on the television next to a graphic of a cat hanging from a tree with the caption \"Death Plunge\"]\n\n[An advertisement that is a parody of Apple iPhone commercials comes on]\n\n[Scene: Exterior of Planet Express building. Leela, Fry, Amy, Bender, Zoidberg, Farnsworth and Hermes walk out the door and come to a sudden stop.]\n\n[It is revealed that they are at the end of what seems to be a pretty long line.]\n\n[Scene: Later that night. Pan down from the moon to reveal practically all of New New York still in line moving very slowly.]\n\n[The line continues to march down the street gradually. Eventually, they reach a bright light, which startles Farnsworth.]\n\n[Cut to: Overhead shot of the line. Pan up to the Mom Store, which is a glass cube with a white logo in the shape of Mom's head and hair and two moving posters on the side with four dancing silhouettes of Mom in her fat suit, Walt, Larry, and Igner. A message appears on the store front saying \"Introducing the All New eyePhone\"]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of the Mom Store. We hear generic alternative music inside the store. We see more moving posters with the dancing silhouettes. The Planet Express crew walks inside.]\n\n[On one of the video screens, the silhouette of Mom in her fat suit stops dancing, walks into the light and fills the entire screen.]\n\n[Ignoring Mom's advice, the crowd turns into a mob as they each try to get to a register. Fry finally reaches one.]\n\n[The salesman puts his hand behind a curtain. Behind the curtain we see there are robots dispensing probably thousands of eyePhones.]\n\n[The salesman opens the eyePhone box.]\n\n[Takes the eyePhone out and sticks it deep into Fry's right eye. He screams from the pinching pain until he blinks, which activates the eyePhone screen in front of him.]\n\n[Mom blinks her eyes and turns the phone off]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of Mom's Friendly Robot Company. Mom, out of her fat suit, is watching the video screen in her office.]\n\n[Mom laughs evilly, and the video screen shows the dancing silhouettes which are no longer dancing, but laughing along with her. But the silhouette of Mom, as always, slaps her sons' silhouettes.]\n\n[Title Screen: The Real Housewives of Sim City]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of a Sims-style house. Two Sims-looking women are watching a blonde Sims woman keep bumping into the wall.]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of the Planet Express meeting room. Fry, Amy, Zoidberg, Bender, and Hermes are all sitting around the meeting table enjoying their eyePhones.]\n\n[Fry blinks his eyes to activate a webisode of Everybody Loves Hypnotoad. He clicks play, and the webisode lasts exactly one second. The play icon appears on screen with the caption \"Play again?\"]\n\n[Bender clicks play. The episode begins with Calculon holding an envelope and Monique looking in sadness]\n\n[The episode pauses as a hastily inserted video of Bender gets inserted into the episode]\n\n[Cut back to Fry, who is relaxing, when his head shakes and we hear a bell ringing. A telephone icon is shown on the eyePhone screen.]\n\n[Fry picks up the phone and on the screen is Leela driving the ship.]\n\n[Wide shot of the ship's hangar. Leela accidentally crashes the ship into the building. She flies out of the ship onto the meeting table, screaming. She has spaghetti all over her face and hair and is still holding onto the taco.]\n\n[Close up on Bender's eyePhone screen. He clicks play and opens a video of Leela crashing the ship.]\n\n[Bender plays the video again, which now has canned laughter at the end of it.]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of Mom's office. Mom, Igner, Larry, and Walt are watching Fry's latest twit.]\n\n[Pan left to reveal Bolt Rollands with an infosquito sucking information from him.]\n\n[A red target sign is on screen pointing at Fry.]\n\n[The algorithm is fired.]\n\n[Scene: Fry walks into another room, still scratching his armpit when a pop-up advertisement appears on his eyePhone screen.]\n\n[The product appears on the screen.]\n\n[Cut to: Hermes is playing Space Invaders on his eyePhone when a pop-up ad with an Italian robot in a chef's outfit holding a pizza comes up with a caption that says, \"Stuffa You Face\"]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of the pizza place across the street. Bender, Hermes, Leela and Fry are seated at a table there.]\n\n[Fry sends the twit, which only Bender and Hermes receive. They look at Leela.]\n\n[Bender opens a video of Fry in his Robot Arms apartment attempting to do karate in his underpants. He tries to chop the coat hanger but falls on his stomach and the coat hanger falls on him.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot of the back of the Planet Express building. We see a goat vomiting into the hot tub. Fry and Bender watch. Leela and Amy enter the disgusting scene.]\n\n[The back end of Mr. Chunks begins to exude green diarrhea.]\n\n[Mom pushes a button near the video screen, which shows a simulation]\n\n[She slaps Larry and Igner who hit each other and then Walt a few times.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot of the back of the Planet Express building. Mr. Chunks is still vomiting. The camera cuts to Fry watching, while Leela and Amy lounge in their swimsuits with clothespins on their noses. We hear a sneeze.]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of the Planet Express bathroom. Fry opens the door and walks in with his eyePhone on recording. He sees Leela at a sink washing up.]\n\n[Leela lifts the bottom of her swimsuit to reveal that the singing was coming from a boil on her butt.]\n\n[Fry screams]\n\n[Fry blinks and turns his eyePhone off.]\n\n[Fry blinks and turns his eyePhone back on. A still of the video is shown on the screen with two buttons, one that says \"Send\" and one that says \"Delete\". Fry looks through the screen and sees Bender walking to the hot tub humming to himself.]\n\n[Fry, in a fit of jealousy decides to send this titillating twit.]\n\n[Fry blinks and turns his eyePhone off]\n\n[We see the video of Susan singing and being popped again.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot of Planet Express building. We hear the video again.]\n\n[Scene: Interior shot of Planet Express meeting room. Leela goes past the door and hears Susan and takes a look.]\n\n[Leela gasps when she sees all the crew members watching the video on the holographic projector and laughing.]\n\n[She runs out crying.]\n\n[Montage: Leela walks down the streets of New New York at night only to pass by a crowd of people laughing. She sees that they are watching the video being projected from the Statue of Liberty's giant eyePhone screen. She runs away. The next day, Leela waits to cross the street when a couple of human kids and an alien kid come by with autograph books. Leela thinks that they want her autograph but the human girl shakes her head and walks over to Leela's butt. She runs from them. That evening, Leela attempts to walk out of Elzar's Fine Cuisine in disguise, but a la Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch, she walks over an air conditioner that exposes her butt and paparazzi take pictures of Susan, who just smiles, while Leela sobs again.]\n\n[Scene: Back of Planet Express. POV shot from Mr. Chunks, with his legs up in the air and flies buzzing around him. Fry, Bender and Amy are gathered around the motionless alien goat.]\n\n[Bender kicks him into the hot tub.]\n\n[Pan left to the next window, where Farnsworth is shouting from.]\n\n[The thermometers finally reach the top. Pan down to reveal that both Fry and Bender have reached one million followers.]\n\n[Fry sinks in his chair.]\n\n[Scene: Mom's office. She sees the results of the bet.]\n\n[Walt runs to a machine with a huge plug, which he plugs in. Electrical sparks come out of the huge machine.]\n\n[Scene: The construction site. Leela passes by Sal and Hoschel who are once again laughing at a video on their eyePhones on lunch break.]\n\n[Leela runs from them with a smile on her face.]\n\n[Scene: Exterior shot of Momco. Three bolts of lightning strikes.]\n\n[Scene: Mom's office.]\n\n[Thunderclap and lightning is heard and seen outside.]\n\n[On the computer screen are Fry and Bender's faces surrounded by images representing their followers becoming zombies.]\n\n[Scene: Planet Express living room. Bender's antennae beeps.]\n\n[Scene: Outside the entrance of the Planet Express building. Fry is sitting on the curb as his right eye lights up.]\n\n[During the following conversation, Fry and Leela are oblivious to the between one and two million zombies passing behind them.]\n\n[Leela sits down, hurting Susan.]\n\n[Fry blinks his eyes and turns on his eyePhone screen. He plays a video that already acheived 142,000,000 views of himself attempting to dive into the tub of vomit. However, on the second jump, he breaks the board and hits his head on the ground and drops into the vomit. Leela laughs.]\n\n[Fry has his arms outstretched and Leela decides to give him another hug. Meanwhile, the zombies have invaded the streets of New New York. We eventually see that they are walking toward the Mom store.]\n\n[The zombies cheer and take out their money. Pan up to Momco. Cut to Mom looking through the window of her office.]\n\n[Closing Credits.]\n\nFuturama transcripts 1ACV\n\n(Season 1) \"Space Pilot 3000\" • \"The Series Has Landed\" • \"I, Roommate\" • \"Love's Labours Lost in Space\" • \"Fear of a Bot Planet\" • \"A Fishful of Dollars\" • \"My Three Suns\" • \"A Big Piece of Garbage\" • \"Hell Is Other Robots\" • \"A Flight to Remember\" • \"Mars University\" • \"When Aliens Attack\" • \"Fry and the Slurm Factory\" 2ACV\n\n(Season 2) \"I Second that Emotion\" • \"Brannigan, Begin Again\" • \"A Head in the Polls\" • \"Xmas Story\" • \"Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?\" • \"The Lesser of Two Evils\" • \"Put Your Head on My Shoulders\" • \"Raging Bender\" • \"A Bicyclops Built for Two\" • \"A Clone of My Own\" • \"How Hermes Requisitioned His Groove Back\" • \"The Deep South\" • \"Bender Gets Made\" • \"Mother's Day\" • \"The Problem with Popplers\" • \"Anthology of Interest I\" • \"War Is the H-Word\" • \"The Honking\" • \"The Cryonic Woman\" 3ACV\n\n(Season 3) \"Amazon Women in the Mood\" • \"Parasites Lost\" • \"A Tale of Two Santas\" • \"The Luck of the Fryrish\" • \"The Birdbot of Ice-Catraz\" • \"Bendless Love\" • \"The Day the Earth Stood Stupid\" • \"That's Lobstertainment!\" • \"The Cyber House Rules\" • \"Where the Buggalo Roam\" • \"Insane in the Mainframe\" • \"The Route of All Evil\" • \"Bendin' in the Wind\" • \"Time Keeps on Slippin'\" • \"I Dated a Robot\" • \"A Leela of Her Own\" • \"A Pharaoh to Remember\" • \"Anthology of Interest II\" • \"Roswell that Ends Well\" • \"Godfellas\" • \"Future Stock\" • \"The 30% Iron Chef\" 4ACV\n\n(Season 4) \"Kif Gets Knocked Up a Notch\" • \"Leela's Homeworld\" • \"Love and Rocket\" • \"Less than Hero\" • \"A Taste of Freedom\" • \"Bender Should Not Be Allowed on Television\" • \"Jurassic Bark\" • \"Crimes of the Hot\" • \"Teenage Mutant Leela's Hurdles\" • \"The Why of Fry\" • \"Where No Fan Has Gone Before\" • \"The Sting\" • \"Bend Her\" • \"Obsoletely Fabulous\" • \"The Farnsworth Parabox\" • \"Three Hundred Big Boys\" • \"Spanish Fry\" • \"The Devil's Hands Are Idle Playthings\" 5ACV\n\n(Season 5)\n\nBender's Big Score The Beast with a Billion Backs Bender's Game Into the Wild Green Yonder Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4 Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4 Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4 Part 1 • Part 2 • Part 3 • Part 4\n\n6ACV\n\n(Season 6) \"Rebirth\" • \"In-A-Gadda-Da-Leela\" • \"Attack of the Killer App\" • \"Proposition Infinity\" • \"The Duh-Vinci Code\" • \"Lethal Inspection\" • \"The Late Philip J.
