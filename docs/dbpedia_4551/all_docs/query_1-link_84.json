A myriad of business workflows of varying complexities come together to realize this experience. Under the covers, they use computationally expensive computer vision, audio processing and natural language processing based media analysis algorithms. These algorithms generate temporally and spatially dynamic metadata that is shared across the various use cases. The Netflix Media DataBase (NMDB) is a multi-tenant, data system that is used to persist this deeply technical metadata about various media assets at Netflix and that enables querying the same at scale. NMDB is built using the best practices of the Netflix micro-services framework. NMDB uses concepts from SMPTE IMF and ISO BMFF to efficiently model the media timeline across a vast category of use-cases, enabling a uniform search and mining interface. The “shared nothing” distributed database architecture allows NMDB to store large amounts of media timeline data, thus forming the backbone for various Netflix media processing systems.\n\nRohit Puri, Netflix\n\nRohit Puri\n\nNetflix\n\nDr. Rohit Puri is Engineering Manager, Cloud Media Systems at Netflix.
