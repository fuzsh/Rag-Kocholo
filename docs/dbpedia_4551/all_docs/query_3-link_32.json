That actually is interesting.\n\n0:00:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd we're going to show you how to take your DVDs and VHS tapes and put them on your hard drive. All that coming up next on Ask the Tech Guys Podcasts you love. From people you trust. This is Tweet. This is Ask the Tech Guys, with Mikah Sargent and Leo Laporte. Episode 2019 for Sunday, April 7th 2024. Blame the Kombucha. Well, hey, hey, hey, how are you today?\n\n0:00:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI'm just peachy keen Leo that's mike, your sergeant that's Leo Laporte, Leo Leo Laporte.\n\n0:00:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nHello everybody, welcome to ask the tech guys. Show where we get to talk to you over the air about your computer woes, your technology problems. Whoa, whoa, whoa. 888-724-2895. No 867. 888-724-2884. Indeed.\n\n0:01:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nDid I get it?\n\n0:01:12 - Leo Laporte\n\nright, yes, you did, 888-724-2884. That's the phone number you can call. You can be on just the phone or you can also Zoom us if you want us to put you in the Stargate Right here. That's called twittv.\n\n0:01:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd what else. Email atg@twit.tv. You can send text, you can send video, you can send audio and you can also bring toys. You know my first computer.\n\n0:01:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nWas this? That right there? Well, it was a little bigger, it was an Atari 400. I had that right there. Well, it was a little bigger, it was an atari 400. I had been going to play video games at chucky cheese putting the quarters in. I love it, right. Yeah, and I thought, you know, this is dumb, I should buy a game machine I could play at home and save the money. So I bought, uh, the atari video computer system vcs, which is just the game thing. I said, well, this is dumb, I should have a computer. So I upgraded this. And then I said, well, this is dumb, I should have a computer. So I upgraded this. And then I said, well, this is dumb because it's got a terrible keyboard. It was a membrane keyboard, was it membrane?\n\nat the time too, so I got the 800, yeah, wow, but somebody I probably should have the address I don't has put out a mini version of my first real computer, the Atari. And when I the atari, when I say mini, it is oh my gosh, it's so cute, it's so cute, oh my gosh, it's so cute. And I think this works.\n\nThe membrane you would have to have tiny little mouse fingers, and and this is where this doesn't open this is where you'd put the cartridges, because it has a stylus. And it comes with a full-size joystick though, which is good, because you really wouldn't want with a tiny little joystick. I just got this in the mail. This is so cute. In the uk that's people who've ever played atari video games will recognize that that would it would. This part would break so quickly. Well, probably not really that quickly, but after many, many and look, it has a. It has a joystick connector, but it's usb these days, not whatever. That weird should we play? I would love to see. Shall we play a game? We shall all right?\n\nThis, uh, connects up to your tv. In the old days you probably don't remember this the video game systems would have a box that would connect to your antenna on your tv oh really. And then you have a switch on it that would switch it into it, so you and you turn to channel three. I do remember turning to channel three, yeah, and you'd watch the game. So that's what this had, but now it's got an HDMI port. It's actually pretty sophisticated.\n\n0:03:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's got a lot of ports on it.\n\n0:03:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhere's the here?\n\n0:03:35 - Mikah Sargent\n\nread the oh, and it's printed so well too.\n\n0:03:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's printed in 18 languages. It feels like every time, nowadays, everything is printed in Kusenleitung. It feels like every time, nowadays, everything is printed in Kusenleitung, every. Yeah, I have a feeling this is not an American product, but I think it's licensed, go straight to the Deutsche. I think it's licensed. Anybody remember your Atari 400? Any of you have one of those? Excuse me, it's the Auspacken, auspacken, auspacken's 400.\n\n0:03:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nÜberprüfen Siedeln inhalt I love German I.\n\n0:04:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI love German what a great language it's such a cool language. It's such a silly. It's a silly language. It's the tuba of languages. I don't know what this is. Oh, this might be power. I don't know. Love it. That's in the same original hideous Atari. Beige, gray or green. Was it a green gray? I think it's a green gray.\n\n0:04:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat was the computers came in those days on the front from left to right is player one. Port player two port player three player one port on the back.\n\n0:04:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is power. You know what burke I'm gonna need? They don't give you a yeah, power dongle, I'm gonna need a usbc. There's one right next to me. You must have known. You must have known what I was up to. I don't know how you knew.\n\n0:04:44 - Caller\n\nI didn't warn you it's the cable that you had in your hand earlier, I think oh, that one clever.\n\n0:04:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI need a any, not an audi can you temporarily unplug your macbook and just use the. Oh yeah, I could do that sure that's a good idea.\n\n0:05:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI could power it from the MacBook. You could also do that yeah. Wouldn't that be novel? What?\n\n0:05:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\na novel idea.\n\n0:05:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nMy most recent computer. With my first computer, either I've gotten very small or this no either. I've gotten very big, or? This computer has gotten very small, all right. So this I think we'll go into this. I got it, burke, I think you're right. I think I have an INI right here and that goes into Zubik.\n\n0:05:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, oh, no, it's USB-C on the back. The power is USB-C, it wants.\n\n0:05:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat's this USB-A then? That is for the. It actually isn't labeled here, but power adapter is USB-C next to the power, so I need a USB-A adapter here. You got one there for those for me.\n\n0:05:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOr you could just unplug your MacBook and plug that. Oh, I see what you're saying.\n\n0:05:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, Doy. No, I got plenty of juice. It's right here. I just do this. Oh no, you got it. Okay, Look at that. Burke is so good Burke's. He's even doing it without getting on camera. That is impressive. That's impressive. You'd never know Now this goes into the. Hdmi port. This has a bunch of games on it right?\n\n0:06:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's got four games built in.\n\n0:06:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, there's an extra HDMI port.\n\n0:06:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nHDMI.\n\n0:06:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh yeah, we don't want to mess with that. Oh, I see it's way over there. Is it on my side? Could you plug it in over?\n\n0:06:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nthere, yes, I can.\n\n0:06:34 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, this is so silly. This is the good old days. I may be the oldest person around. I don't know if any of you remember this Atari, I was too cheap to buy an Apple computer. Okay, Okay.\n\n0:06:50 - Caller\n\nYou press the one button, Mike, until the input, and then you'll see it.\n\n0:06:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, are we booting up? Do I have to do anything? There's a power button. Oh, there's an on button. Yeah. Yeah, oh, the light just power button. Oh, there's an on button. Yeah, yeah, oh, the light just came on oh the light, the light.\n\n0:07:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLet me make sure that.\n\n0:07:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt'd be fun if I could program an Atari Basic. I did that, you know I would. Oh, oh, yeah, you see it's English, yeah, okay, and then F to select top to next. I don't understand. Let's see what the it must be this button yeah let's see what the different buttons are System reset option.\n\n0:07:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo the F button is that red button, the joystick button and then the top button just means you take the joystick and point it to the top.\n\n0:07:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, I press top. Yeah, do I want 60 hertz or 50?\n\n0:07:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nhertz. I think if you're in north america you're supposed to choose 60 hertz. I can't get it to go there. Uh go, just yeah.\n\n0:07:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere you go okay, run television test, here we go it says run television test kick it to the left, I think it to the left, I think Joystick to the left. Oh, joystick to. Oh, maybe the joystick. Oh, I get it, I had the joystick.\n\n0:08:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAh, yes, wrong, no, so joystick should be in the top left corner, the button. Oh sorry, the button should be in the top left corner. Okay, a four-way button ring? Oh wait, is there? Are? Are there? I bet there are little buttons on there. There's four, it's a.\n\n0:08:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is something that atari didn't have. There we go television test. Press that to accept settings. I think I'm going to accept it because frankly, I don't see what's going on here. Oh golly. Okay, select is F Run television test, I guess I have to yeah the button on the left.\n\n0:08:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWhere should this button be? Okay, so the button should be in the top left corner. Ah, that's why there we go. And then now to there we go.\n\n0:09:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, what game do do you want to play? I'll tell you what I want to play. Oh, battle zone was the one I spent so much time at chucky cheese losing money on. Uh, I wish you could hear it. Is there audio? Uh, we can look centipede, you know what I love from the tv directly, wouldn't it? Yeah, we'd have to have it on the arc port. Let's just, we're not going to do this for too long. That's the best game of all time, star raiders yeah, uh, missile command.\n\nI really liked minor 2049 that looks like fun.\n\n0:09:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, it's like a donkey kong I played this a lot.\n\n0:09:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, we have a. We have a. We're gonna turn up the audio oh, okay. Does that sound familiar? Or what? By Bill Hogan? This is oh God, this brings back memories of my youth, Except I wasn't that young. Oh, I need this shovel.\n\n0:09:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNiner, 49er, Niner Da A's daughter.\n\n0:10:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI fell off the edge.\n\n0:10:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh wait, you can't fall off the edge. No, that's very high. You're right, the realism of this game I'm impressed.\n\n0:10:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's so realistic.\n\n0:10:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, you need that little. How do I get?\n\n0:10:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nit though. Ah nice, Do I need the thermos? What is that? Oh, he really can't handle falls. No, falls for him. Anyway, we shouldn't play this all day, but you see what fun it's very.\n\n0:10:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI mean, I remember mine is talking about all these little things. It's like Donkey Kong a little bit.\n\n0:10:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I got to get the Levi's.\n\n0:10:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLike I don't know about that one. Oh, so close, close, all right enough, said.\n\n0:10:51 - Leo Laporte\n\nanyway, look at that that's so cool. I don't remember where I got it great score enter your name. Wait a minute. This is the most oh no. Anyway, there you go. I'm going to bring this home and attach it permanently.\n\n0:11:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, there you go.\n\n0:11:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nTo a television set. You can press the button to get away from this. Look at all the games, though. Doesn't that look like fun?\n\n0:11:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat does look like fun. That's awesome. I think there's 40 games in there I don't remember a lot the. Electra Slide.\n\n0:11:27 - Leo Laporte\n\nBut Centipede. Some of the classics are in here Boulder Dash Missile Command, boulder Dash Berserk Battle Zone is a lot of fun. There's Asteroids, you remember that?\n\n0:11:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nright, asteroids. Do you ever play Asteroids?\n\n0:11:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, absolutely how I got started. Actually, pong was that looks fun. Seven cities of gold, o'reilly's mine missile command, that was minor 24. Now, millipede is a great game. Millipede's, you played that. Oh, I loved mule a turn-based strategy game. Yeah, mule is a is like it was like a real ooh, gather resources yeah that's my kind of game yeah, you would like mule.\n\nI played a lot of mule in the day, back in the day. I feel like that was a ch Crawford joint, but I might be wrong. Anyway, there you go. There you have it. There is, I'll find out where to get it. Actually, has the chat room found it yet Futuristic since forever, is that it? I think our Discord is so good at this kind of research. Won't you take me to Funky Town? Oh, all the animated GIFs. Let me get down there. Is that it? Yeah, the Atari 400 Mini. Thank you At Ataricom. Wait, it's Atari's own. Oh well, yeah, it has to be. Atari doesn't really exist anymore, except in this kind of weird $119.99, $2,120. That was a lot less than I paid for the full time. I was going to ask you how much yeah.\n\nYeah, it was probably $250, something like that. I couldn't afford an Apple II which was over $1,000. 25 8-bit classic games and you can connect up to four joysticks so you can buy more joysticks. So you said it was $250?. I don't know what was the year, oh, in 1978, 79, something like that. I don't remember when it was.\n\n0:13:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think you may have paid $250. That would be $5,000. $1,190.33 in today's dollars Wowza.\n\n0:13:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nWowza, wowza, wowza. So this is going to be a fun day today because we have a live in-studio audience for Twit coming up in a couple of hours. We have chairs all set up. This is very exciting. Probably people will start to dribble in. Let's hope they don't dribble on us yeah let's, but, uh, they will start to dribble.\n\nJoin us, yes, that'll be fun. John ashley, behind the console uh, but mostly this is all about answering your questions. Johnny jack coming up at 1 pm, about an hour and a half from now, uh, to join us. Our travel guru, guru guide. Anything else we want to talk about? No, there weren't a huge number of stories today, so I'll save those for twit later. Normally we do. I should mention one thing the guy you know rap genius. The website I do at geniuscom it's fall up. The guy who founded it uh, mabad magdam passed away at the age of 41.\n\n0:14:26 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's kind of sad yeah, that wasn't the time before you could really get lyrics anywhere else. He started that.\n\n0:14:32 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt was really nice and it was so successful, that rap artists would go in there and say no. No, you misunderstand, that's not what I was saying. Yeah, that kind of thing really a great story uh, yeah, and that's right.\n\n0:14:43 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt evolved from just being it was kind of like what was cool about it was what is cool about it. It's a sort of community of not just pacing the lyrics themselves but also trying to interpret them, and I love, though they'll sometimes uh, it's sort of wikipedia like, and that they will reference different um interviews and things like that, so you can learn what somebody was actually trying to say whenever they were writing.\n\n0:15:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's very important, right, yeah. He then went on after Rap Genius to do Everipedia, which I don't remember. I've never heard of that More inclusive, accessible online encyclopedia Great idea. He was a pianist fluent in Persian French, arabic. Uh he uh was a pianist fluent in persian, french, arabic and english and an angel investor uh, passed away at the age of 41 due to a brain tumor.\n\nOh, that's so sad, sad, sad story. I don't like to always I don't like to do sad stories, but that one I think you know he you got to acknowledge the people who made the world we live in today. Uh, it's really important. Apple also added a game emulator. Speaking of the atari, that's what allows so yeah, so somebody's going to be making an atari game simulator, so you probably just buy that instead of I think this is, but this is unique.\n\n0:15:58 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a unique thing. Yeah, it's so cute, it's nostalgic it's.\n\n0:16:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nuh, I think maybe we should feed this to lily and see if she turns into a centipede or something Just like that. It's a memento for me. A trophy of my ute. It's very cute. Yeah, Thank you Atari for making that. This is serial number 12,505. So it's unique, One of a kind. I think we should do calls. Do we have any calls this? Is it too early?\n\n0:16:28 - Mikah Sargent\n\nwell, I gotta call them. Gain them into the room.\n\n0:16:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nCalls I got calls remember jingle jangle star six to unmute yourself it's funny that atari has come back as a company, but a retro company.\n\n0:16:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRight, exactly, isn't that lovely.\n\n0:16:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nFuturistic since forever, it says on their homepage. It's the 25th anniversary of Roller Coaster Tycoon. God, I love that game and you can buy. It. Looks like a full-size version of their Atari 2600, which is kind of cool. Caller star six to unmute, star six to unmute. You can also buy sneakers Atari, atari sneakers. Hello, hey, what's your name, your first name, and what city are you calling from?\n\n0:17:17 - Caller\n\nHi, it's David. I'm calling from Ontario, canada. Hello David, welcome. What can we do for you today? Hi, I'm interested to know if you can help me out. I'm trying to connect an Apple TV to a projector. That's it, and I'm having difficulty because there's only well, no, because there's only an HDMI coming out of the back. Oh, what do you have on the projector? I just have an HDMI going from the Apple TV to the projector. Oh, and you want the audio. I want to put the audio over to something else.\n\n0:17:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nAudio, as you notice with this little game, goes over the HDMI as well. In fact, ideally that's the way you want to have audio, because this has the most bandwidth. Do you have on your projector? Uh, anything like an audio output port or a speaker port.\n\n0:18:11 - Caller\n\nI don't, unfortunately. Uh, I have what. It's connected through the ceiling. I only have uh hdmi cable running up through the ceiling and I want to. I have speakers down that I'd like to plug it into like a sound bar bar et cetera.\n\n0:18:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, but Well, that's not hard to do, I'm just. I feel like, can you look at the back of the projector or is it embedded?\n\n0:18:32 - Caller\n\nI can look at the back of the projector. Yes, yeah.\n\n0:18:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nHave you looked at it to see if there's audio out?\n\n0:18:39 - Caller\n\nI believe there is, but you know, possibly an audio out.\n\n0:18:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nI guess Too hard. There is possibly an audio out. I guess I'd have to run the wires back down through the ceiling back down to the. I'm sure whoever installed that thing did you install it.\n\n0:18:54 - Caller\n\nNo, it's just a cable running through the ceiling, so I'd have to run it down through.\n\n0:18:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhoever installed it obviously had a provision for audio going to speakers. In fact, you might look around where the speakers are see if there's wires coming out of the wall. But uh, if you can't, yeah, you can split the hdmi coming out of the apple tv yeah, still gonna need wires probably yeah, I mean.\n\n0:19:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo here's the thing. There are a couple of ways um to to make this happen. Um you, the apple tv if it's a newer apple tv, uh technically has bluetooth compatibility. Um, I don't recommend that for the best sound possible?\n\nyeah, um, although that's what you use for airpods, right yes, that is what you use for airpods, so you could have a pair of home pods. That's what I was going to say, and that's different because that uses AirPlay, so it's over Wi-Fi. So if you had HomePods HomePod Mini or HomePod then it becomes a simple process. You just have to have them plugged in and you can route audio to them. You don't have to worry about extra cables. But we did see, and there are multiple options for what's called an HDMI audio extract extractor, which is what some folks have posted in the discord and essentially, right, that's what I heard, yeah yeah, that will.\n\nYou plug hdmi into one end and then out comes hdmi, but also a couple of ways to get audio out that goes to a separate place, so you could then plug the speakers into that if you didn't yet buy the speakers, or you were lucky and you bought a soundbar that supports AirPlay that's easy. Then you're sold, that's wireless You're good to go. Yeah, because it'll do it over Wi-Fi, so it's going to be good, high quality audio that'll have less lag than if you were doing something like Bluetooth. Have you bought the speakers yet?\n\n0:20:47 - Caller\n\nI have a soundbar that I was using, but it doesn't have the. It can't do that. But I do have some AirPod minis that I have. I didn't think they were connectable to the Apple.\n\n0:20:53 - Mikah Sargent\n\nTV. They absolutely are. Yeah, Especially if you have two of them, you can use them as a stereo pair with your television and basically it, you know, puts that full, more full audio into the space. So what you do yeah, it's actually, it's a pretty cool thing so you'd put them in, you know, to the left and to the right of the screen, and then what you have to do is go into the home app and make sure that they are in. They're listed in the home app in the same room, sure that they are in. They're listed in the Home app in the same room as the Apple TV.\n\nAnd then on your Apple TV you go into the settings and you go into audio output and at that point it'll recognize oh hey, you've got two HomePods in here, Would you like to use those as your audio output? And then it will use those as your audio output, so you'll have kind of left and right audio. It's technically sort of virtualized, fuller than that. The one thing with HomePod minis is I found that if you are using those because I was using those temporarily until I found somebody who was selling another first generation HomePod, at which point I replaced them the audio has to be louder, you have to have the volume turned up a little bit more, Because they're little.\n\nYeah, because they're little things for it to be kind of the same. So once you get past the sort of discomfort in your mind of seeing that volume near the top of the meter and just go, oh right, but this is just what it needs to be at for me to actually hear it, then it's fine. But that was kind of for me at first. I'm going why do I have to have it up this loud? But it's not louder, it's just that's how loud it needs to be for it to sound full and good.\n\n0:22:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nApple doesn't expect you to have wires. They don't like wires. They're not going to do it.\n\n0:22:40 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey want you to do wireless speakers and I've been using HomePods two of them as my speakers for a very long time now. It's very consistent, Sounds good, and it sounds great because I've got HomePod HomePods, not HomePod Minis. The HomePod Minis, as I mentioned, I used for a little while while I was waiting for another HomePod first gen to make its way to me and it was OK, but you would have a better experience.\n\n0:23:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd, by the way, airpods would work also. In fact, yesterday I was watching a show. Lisa was in bed. I don't want to keep her up, so I put in my airpods. And it's funny, you don't. You forget you're watching with headphones, because it really they spatialize it in some sort of way. In fact, if you turn your head, the sound still comes from where over there, from the tv. So you really forget very quickly that you're listening on headphones and it's like you're listening in the room. So if you have AirPods or AirPod Pros or AirPod Pro Max and you pair those to the Apple TV, at least in the interim, it's a great way to listen. Of course, it's just you.\n\n0:23:38 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou can't Can you have one, yeah, no, that's great. You can share audio to one other pair of AirPods, so you could have two sets of AirPods.\n\n0:23:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, that's interesting. We'll have to try that. It sounds actually surprisingly good. It might even be better than speakers.\n\n0:23:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nCome to think of it, the biggest thing about it is Apple really has nailed the syncing between the video and the audio, and that's where it matters.\n\n0:23:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nDon't do it with any other Bluetooth headphones. Do it with AirPods, yeah, other Bluetooth earphones.\n\n0:24:03 - Caller\n\nDo it with AirPods. Yeah, I do have the two mini, so I'll definitely give those a try. The latest generation of the larger HomePods, the big ones.\n\n0:24:14 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe HomePods. That's what I meant to say.\n\n0:24:16 - Caller\n\nThe big ones Do they work with Bluetooth as well? They're.\n\n0:24:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAirPlay, and those work exceptionally well, he likes that.\n\nIf you ever decide you wanted to make that upgrade, I can highly recommend it. They sound great, they have the latest processing in them, so it's going to be a better experience. And then also, apple has a if you find yourself having trouble hearing dialogue. They also have an enhanced dialogue option with those second generation home pods. That I found to be really well balanced, to where it isn't obvious that the mix has been redone, but it's good that it rises above the rest of the sound, so it's funny.\n\n0:24:54 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have options. I have in the bedroom. I have a very nice pair of ELAC very high end speakers with a very high end codec and I can listen to music on that. But I also have a pair of the new HomePods and I have to say they're doing some processing that makes it kind of sound better. It's pure psychologically. It's not as probably as perfect, as clear, but it does sound better somehow, and maybe that's the spatial.\n\n0:25:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd somebody has pointed out in the chat. This is a great point. Um, you can always go for refurbished home pods. If you get refurbished products directly from Apple, they come with a good warranty.\n\n0:25:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey have a lot of like new.\n\n0:25:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, so you can save 50 bucks on a second gen home pod. Thanks Joe In the chat for that.\n\n0:25:38 - Caller\n\nYeah, that's great. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the help and, uh, I am a club member. You guys are doing an amazing job, thank you. So keep it up and I look forward to continue listening. Thank you.\n\n0:25:49 - Leo Laporte\n\nBoth of you. We really appreciate your support. Ok, take care. Yeah, the club is, if you don't know, is how we are trying to monetize these days, because add support for all podcasts not just ours, but all podcasts is dwindling and we are a little concerned that, frankly, it'll dwindle to the point where we, like many other podcast networks and podcasts, will have to go out of business, uh, or or, as we've already done, severely curtail what we do. We've already cut back, uh, but our hope is that by creating a club and asking you to join the club, we can maybe fill the gap and continue to do what we do.\n\nClub TWiT is seven dollars a month. It's not very expensive. We always want to keep it that way. You get all of our shows without ads because you know you're paying us. We don't need to monetize you. You also get access to the Club Twit Discord. We talk about that a lot. That's a wonderful chat space, not just during the shows, but all the time. You get video versions of all of our shows, many of which are audio only to the public. You get access to the events that we do, to TwitPlus feed, which is all the stuff that happens before and after shows plus special events. If you're not a member, can you do us a favor and join it? Sure would make me feel pretty good. twit.tv/clubtwit. And just to reassure you that money doesn't go into my pocket or Lisa's pocket. It really goes to keeping the studio on and the power on the lights on. It's one of the reasons we're having an event today, so members of the club can come visit us. I hope, uh, if you're one of them, that you will have a good time. Uh, let's continue on with whatever John Ashley, esteemed producer man, says.\n\nI saw one of these Break. Wasn't that a break? That wasn't a break. Okay, I'll do another break. This episode of Ask the Tech Sound like a break to me.\n\nThis episode of Ask the Tech is brought to you by Zscaler, the leader in cloud security. It's no surprise. Cyber attackers are using ai in creative ways this is depressing to compromise users, to breach organizations. They are getting better with high precision phishing emails. They're even, at this point, doing video and you probably heard the, the one with the voice deep fakes, not just of celebrities, but of ceos, the CEOs. Did you see the one about the guy who wrote a? What was it? A $25 million check because of a deep, fake Zoom call with his CFO and other members of the finance department saying you need to write this check, and he did it because they looked real. They weren't.\n\nIn a world where employees are working everywhere, apps are everywhere, data is everywhere, a firewall, a VPN is just not enough to protect you. They're not designed for these distributed environments and, more importantly, for these new AI-powered attacks. In fact, firewalls and VPNs have become the attack surface. That's a scary thought. Well, in a security landscape where you must fight AI with AI, the best AI protection comes from having the best data.\n\nZscaler has extended its zero-trust architecture. That's the Z in Zscaler. With powerful AI engines that are trained and tuned by 500, get this trillion daily signals. That's 500 trillion signals every day. Zscaler Zero Trust Plus ai helps defeat ai attacks today by enabling you to automatically detect and block advanced threats, discover and classify sensitive data everywhere, generate user to app segmentation to limit lateral threat movement, quantify risk, prioritize remediation and generate board ready reports, because you know you gotta get the board to go. Okay, we'll write a check for that. Learn more about if you're on the board I know I'm not mocking you If you're.\n\nLearn more about Zscaler. Really, though, you should do this.

I think we talked about that when that happened. I mean, the guy was fooled on a zoom call and because they were all reasonably so.\n\n0:30:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, you thought. Oh, I thought I was talking to that person. How?\n\n0:30:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou know. I mean, how good can you get? Yeah, all right now, with the permission of our esteemed producer. Yes, now I'm going to pick up on the caller. Okay.\n\n0:30:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJames, there we go. Welcome to Ask the Tech Guys and soon welcome to the Stargate.\n\n0:30:41 - Caller\n\nHey.\n\n0:30:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nHey, what's your first name and where are you calling from?\n\n0:30:46 - Caller\n\nJames, southern California Hi.\n\n0:30:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nJames Come on down.\n\n0:30:51 - Caller\n\nI've been listening to you since you were on AM way back when.\n\n0:30:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nWow On KFI in beautiful Los Angeles, california. Yeah, just a few years ago. I was thinking this the other day. I was thinking I was on the radio in Los Angeles for 19 years. That's a whole. Why aren't I more famous and rich? That's what I was thinking.\n\n0:31:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's what I was thinking. Were you eating caviar at the time? Is what we want to know.\n\n0:31:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nJames, what can we do?\n\n0:31:18 - Caller\n\nfor you Two questions. I've been listening to a lot of your shows and how come I haven't heard you guys talk about Google killing the podcast app?\n\n0:31:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nwell, they in theory. Now, actually, this is interesting. You said this. First of all, it only happened a couple weeks ago. We did mention on other shows we didn't mention. Actually it was yesterday was the last day, and they replaced it with YouTube music. But it doesn't do as good a job. In fact, I'm getting complaints from audience members that they are not getting their, I think, twig of all things this week in Google didn't download this week YouTube. I mean Google, google. It's inexplicable. There's a term in soccer, european football, called own goal, where you kick the ball into your own net and the other guys get a point.\n\n0:32:10 - Mikah Sargent\n\nListen, I only did that once, Leo, and I'll never do it again.\n\n0:32:15 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think Google is the king of own goals. I mean they continually, and it's frustrating for us as podcasters. I don't understand it. Did you like Google podcasts, james?\n\nyeah, I had all your shows listed and, with this downloaded, it played easily you know, what I liked about it on the android device was I could have an icon for each show, just like a you know an app, and so it was very easy for me to hit the show I wanted. I had a whole whole page of show icons. Yeah, I love Google Podcasts. So, as of yesterday, it's completely.\n\n0:32:50 - Caller\n\nI was trying to use it. I think April 1st was the last day and then it allowed you still to enter into yesterday, so you do have until July 30th to export your podcast subscription.\n\n0:33:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo what I would suggest is that you don't attempt to do it in YouTube music A, because really you're going to end up paying for YouTube music, which, of course, is their whole point. Google Podcasts is free. They want you to pay for YouTube music, export it and put it in something free like Pocket Casts, which we like quite a bit. So just find another podcast, in other words, find another podcast player, and I have to say what this does for me is it makes me not want to use Google stuff, and when Google announces new products, you, you better bet most people are thinking twice about adopting them. It's very frustrating, extremely.\n\n0:33:37 - Caller\n\nSo my question actually for you, though, is I have an Odie but goodie question oh kiddo question.\n\n0:33:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkie dokie, I still use this. Oh, look at his Newton. Oh, look at that little Newton.\n\n0:33:50 - Caller\n\nIt's still my daily note taker. It's still. That's amazing. That's incredible.\n\n0:33:55 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's amazing, james. I have three or four. If you need one, I'll send you. I still have my one megabyte. Yeah, I have a few of those. Oh my gosh.\n\n0:34:07 - Caller\n\nThis is the static card?\n\n0:34:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, do you also have an Ethernet card so you can get online with it? Yes, I do Remember the modem card had the little pop-out I don't know. I guess the Ethernet card would too A little pop-out thing for your jack to get connected to go into. Wow, I love that you're still using how's the handwriting recognition, is it pretty good? It's good you've there. You go see, look at that. That's the see how that pops out so you can snap the ethernet cable in. Isn't that hysterical? Wow, oh, I should just send you my trove of useless newton stuff. Everyone. You know what's cool about it. It doesn't use rechargeables.\n\n0:34:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou put a battery in it oh, that's because I was about to ask about that, yeah yeah, double a's, yeah.\n\n0:34:51 - Caller\n\nSo my question, though, is my g3 that I used just to back this up finally just died, oh no. So I don't know how to, I don't know what to, how to back this up anymore now.\n\n0:35:04 - Leo Laporte\n\nWere you connecting it with the serial cable to the yeah Wow, um, that is obscure. Is there a Newton? Is there a Newton user support somewhere? There must be five or six people who still use Newtons. Uh, I'm you think I'm joking. I think that's probably the number. Um, I loved, loved the new by the way, I was.\n\n0:35:26 - Caller\n\nYou have something that's. You have something that's this small, that could fit in my pocket.\n\n0:35:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nJust that's produced as handwriting that's also a great way to meet girls. They go. What the hell is that? What are? You are you from the future because it looks a little bit like it is futuristic.\n\n0:35:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut it's a little star trek, right? Yeah, it is futuristic, but it's a little Star Trek, right. Yeah, are you from the future? The only thing that could come close, I think, and it's not quite slim enough, but the iPad mini no no, no, no, he wants to keep using his Newton? No, no, no. But he said what is another option that also does? If I can't, yeah, if he can't get to work.\n\n0:36:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nA mini would be a good choice.\n\n0:36:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a little bit thicker but it does do the finger or the handwriting recognition.\n\n0:36:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou can write with an Apple Pencil, maybe even a little bit better, and you can use the pencil.\n\n0:36:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd you don't have to have a G3 to back it up. You don't need a G3.\n\n0:36:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere are many good. There's good notes. There's notability. There are very many. I use notability, but there are a lot of really good choices. That's built into the UI.\n\n0:36:25 - Caller\n\nI mean yeah, I don't want to.\n\n0:36:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have the iPad Pro.\n\n0:36:28 - Caller\n\nI have the iPad Pro, oh, okay, I can do all that, but when I need something in my pocket, this is the smallest and this has been the most convenient.\n\n0:36:36 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, but the Mini's bigger than that.\n\n0:36:38 - Caller\n\nIt's thinner, but bigger dimensions. It's also lighter. Yeah, that's true.\n\n0:36:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think you could still sink that I I know.\n\n0:36:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI just want you to be able to keep using this. I know I give you new things I've had this.\n\n0:36:51 - Caller\n\nI've had this since 95, yeah that's so cool that you're 30 years he's been using that thing I think, I think I think I paid like 2500 for this. Oh yeah, holy moly well.\n\n0:37:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, no wonder why you hey, burke, can you bring me one or two or three newtons, whatever you can find.\n\n0:37:07 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey're in my, they're my museum we are kind of um sort of keeping this going because then more of the people who are listening who are also, uh, geeks, nerds, uh, so it has a serial port on it.\n\n0:37:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nyou can get a serial to us connector, so it's not a problem in terms of getting that connected. What it is is an issue of what it will look like to the computer that you're connecting it to.\n\n0:37:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nCan it just be a hard drive? Yeah, because if it could, yeah, if you could plug it in and it kind of treats it like a flash drive, so to speak then, boom, you're good you could back it up.\n\n0:37:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat software were you using before on the G3? I was using the newton soft and you should back up. Yeah, so clearly that's not gonna work anymore. Um, yeah, that's it. Those are the. These are the. Uh, I have a pretty. They're starting to stick together. You got to separate them every every few years oil them down a little bit.\n\nSo, uh, which do you have? Do you have the 2000, the 130? Oh yeah, the orig. Wow, that's so cool. I mean, you know, I do think it kind of feels like you're you're living in the future with this thing. It's kind of cool actually that's the, that's the 100 oh, you have a more recent one. Is this the 130?\n\n0:38:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI don't I don't has the oh yeah, You've got your modem card.\n\n0:38:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, and you have a stylus? Yeah, I don't think I have a one 30. I think I only have hundreds and the 2000, 2000,. I guess I missed out on one of them. A pen comes out of it. Yeah, isn't that nice. It's right there in that little slot slot. I'm curious. I have a bunch of cards in these things. I should just send you this stuff. You get spare parts. I'm trying to think.\n\n0:38:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, have you tried using an adapter? That'd be the first thing I'd do is get a USB serial to.\n\n0:38:57 - Caller\n\nNothing. The computer looked at me like what. I wonder if using Linux.\n\n0:39:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nI just don't know what the Newton sends. This is actually a great project, james. Here's a great project for you. You might have to write your own code. Here you go, somebody's already done it. Never mind, it's on GitHub, the GitHub account Newton Research. Thank you, scooterx. He has written a tool this is hysterical. A tool this is hysterical. Obviously you're not alone Called NCX, the Newton connection for Mac OS X, and the idea of this is you can back up to your Mac desktop, import and export dates, names, notes and Newton works, install packages and use your Mac desktop keyboard and your text on your Newton.\n\nThat is truly amazing. So this is on GitHub. This is going to take a little bit of skill, probably, to install. Nobody's done anything to this in two years. That was the last commit.\n\nIt is an Xcode project, so you would need on your you have a Mac, james, I have an M1. M1. You have a modern Mac. I should have asked. So, on a modern Mac, you'd run Xcode and you'd download this and you'd run it. It's an Xcode project and it would build something for you that would, in fact, even describe how to build it.\n\nUm, this, they said xcode 8, which is pretty old, so I'm sure it'll still work in xcode, uh. But you know the the the trail to follow is these guys, newton research. Who the heck are they? They, uh, they have other newton, so somebody is out there supporting the Newton, and that's pretty cool. So this is the first place I'd go Talk to this fella and see, and you could leave him a message, if he's still around, and find out what's going on. But you could. So, in other words, with the right cable, which is the usb, uh to serial port, so you could plug it into the newton, and then I have it to the us, the usb to the usbc, as I have like two connectors they might make these days a usbc to serial.\n\nWho knows? You know there's, there's always going to be somebody. Where is the serial port on this thing I'm trying to? Where do you connect?\n\n0:41:24 - Caller\n\nthat it's on the side. There's a, there's a rubber oh yeah, I see it.\n\n0:41:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, that's a weird. So it's not even a stand, it's a din connector. So it's not even a standard connector, is it?\n\n0:41:37 - Caller\n\nno, yeah, that's, you know apple, you know exactly proprietary well, but I think that that is not completely proprietary, but it's just.\n\n0:41:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's not as common as the db25. That's a din serial. So yeah, you may have to dig around, you might even have to get out, break out the soldering iron. How's your soldering oh? My lord, uh, it's not hard to make too bad. Yeah, it's may have to dig around. You might even have to break out the soldering iron. How's your soldering?\n\n0:41:56 - Caller\n\nOh my Lord, it's not hard to make.\n\n0:41:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's not hard to make a cable. You have to get either end and you solder it together. But you could make this with the proper pinouts. You'd have to find the Newton spec. But look, if you want to be somebody who uses a Newton, these are skills you need, that's true.\n\n0:42:13 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou can't just blithely say, oh yes, I use a newton pretend you are in an apocalypse and you got to keep this thing running. You know what I mean. You got to have these skills. This is an amazing device.\n\n0:42:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nFrankly, I think sharp made these for apple, right?\n\n0:42:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think that's who made them um I feel like it could be you be used as a personal defense device?\n\n0:42:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, you have the big one. Yeah, but this is apparently somebody was. This has Velcro on the back, so this was mounted at some point somewhere, and this one is really much more. This is the MessagePad 2000 that came later because it has a screen cover and all that. Would you like this? Can I send it to you? I would love it.\n\n0:42:56 - Caller\n\nActually I would love that.\n\n0:42:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nOkay, I'll get a hand stack on one of those Hang on the line, and I will. I mean, there's no reason to be sitting in my cupboard because I have enough of them. To demonstrate. Let me send you the 2000. And you can see, this might be more fun to work with. It's got two card slots and yeah, you said I have. What is this? This is the fax modem card. So this does the same thing yours does. Which is it? Oops, where is it? There it is. It pops out the 144. Yeah, 144. X jack, that was made by megahertz, remember them.\n\n0:43:40 - Caller\n\nAnd then what is? There's another card in here. This is probably the same card.\n\n0:43:42 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou have the megabyte memory card. Oh, I have stat I have static and flash dude. That's, that's actually. That's an upgrade, actually flash, two megabyte flash dude, two megabyte flash. Okay, the only thing I'm going to ask you is, if you find any private data on there, you erase it, because I have no idea what's on here.\n\n0:43:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nProbably probably some of my uh, my old beats this is it's wild to see this is one year younger than I am oh, my god, oh wow.\n\n0:44:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis could have been your first computer. Now this one has a different serial port on this, which is, I think, really non-standard. Or is that hdmi or something?\n\n0:44:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI know it looks like hdmi, doesn't it?\n\n0:44:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nsort of weird, weird port on there. Um, and this, this one had the battery on. This is a little different too see, and it has four double a's in there. I guess I these are recent, so I must have fired this up, let's see. I wonder if the battery's still.\n\n0:44:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI tried turning it on. Did you try? Yeah, all right, I need new batteries, but maybe I don't know how to turn it on.\n\n0:44:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nWell, there's nothing to it. What a fun thing. Let's hang on the line, james, I'll get your address.\n\n0:44:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nActually, heck, actually yeah, if we can do it in the zoom chat, john, do you know how to do that? If not, actually you know, email me email.\n\n0:44:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou can email me directly, Leo, at Leofm. And, uh, I will look for it. Use the secret, I don't know how we're gonna know. Send me a picture with your newton in your hand and I'll know. It's there we go, and, uh, and just send me your address and I'll be glad to ship that off to you. Thank you so much. Going, going to a good home. I'm happy. Are you kidding? I really appreciate it. Good, my pleasure. And then go to Newton research on a get hub because apparently they're doing some they're still doing some Newton stuff, or they were. Uh, you see a whole 17 followers, 17 people who have Newton's and 16 others, or I guess you'll make the 18th.\n\n0:45:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI love it, I love it. Thank you, james, thank you so much thank you, thank you oh, my pleasure.\n\n0:45:43 - Leo Laporte\n\nYes, we have a winner of the newton 2000.\n\n0:45:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThis thing, it's considerably bigger yeah, it's, it's much heftier yeah I don't know what apple.\n\n0:45:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis was not under steve, this was under John Sculley, but I think it's cool. Brilliant engineering went into this and, of course, a lot of those people went on to Sidekick. I mean, this was a big part of Apple's story. Wow, came out after the Mac, right before steve came back as a ute.\n\n0:46:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI would have loved to have had one of those there's oh yeah it's so cool so somebody sent this to me.\n\n0:46:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nObviously zz did. Oh zz top. No, I don't know this. It looks like this was used in some sort of industrial uh setting.\n\n0:46:30 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh good, right, because of the velcro oh, I thought you may have done that just to like no, no, no, no, I didn't do that I didn't do that, but I'm not gonna take it off.\n\n0:46:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nI'll let james take it off, because I'm afraid if I do it'll fall something will happen.\n\n0:46:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's necessary to the structure it might actually be holding it's a support beam together.\n\n0:46:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, here is from every mac. Thank you to the fabulous scooter x here. Here are the specs. Now that mini Atari probably does not have a 6502 Atari chip in it. It probably has, you know, an Arduino or Raspberry Pi, some sort of more modern thing. But here we go. This is the good old days. Came out in 97. So you were a couple of years old when this came out. It is a strong arm. 110. Apple invested, in fact apple founded arm to make with some other companies to make these newtons. They needed a arm chip. So this is the earliest days of arm. Four megabytes or eight megabytes of rom, that's the operating system on there. It comes with one to five megabytes of ram. That's a lot for 1997.\n\nThat's incredible this is amazing two pcm cia slots those are those two little slots there um, and it's 480 by 320. This is actually pretty impressive, originally almost a thousand bucks, but you know that was in 1997 dollars. Yeah.\n\n0:47:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAs you don't have to go back to the inflation. I'm going to look it up for myself because I'm curious and for people like me and James who are using Google podcasts, export them.\n\n0:48:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nGoogle has instructions on how you can export your subscriptions in a format that's a standard Rss format called opml. Once you've exported it to opml, any podcast player or rss reader can import that, so it's easy to move. Uh, oh, you think that's for a dock? Burke's saying the, the, the din is for a dock. Oh, interesting, okay, oh, that funny one. Oh, that's that's for a newton dock. Yeah, they probably had plans. They had plans.\n\nApple did, believe it or not, this has gone the way of the apple car, apple music. We've had trouble for people moving over to apple music. I mean youtube music with their um, youtube music with from their google podcasts. I've had seen at least one person who said I'm not, it's not working. So I I think I would try download before you, uh, before it goes out of, completely out of service in july, download your opml file and, you know, save it. That's all your subscriptions. You could put that somewhere else. That's just, oh, google. Oh, my god, you know the velcro is to hold it to a nice leather case. I don't think so. I do you. You think that's what it was.\n\nOh, and boy, scooter x, you're really uh he's a kitten on the keys this, uh, this weekend. Here is oh, I'm not going to that page I got that too.\n\n0:49:37 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI'm like never mind, uh, I'll probably just when I get when I get that.\n\n0:49:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nI just say let's go. You say it's fine, let's go. That page is down, so I don't know if it worked for you. Scooter x are you?\n\n0:49:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\ntrying to scooter. Scooter, what shouldoter?\n\n0:49:52 - Leo Laporte\n\nScooter, Scooter. What should we do now?\n\n0:49:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere's a question I would like to take. Yes, sir, because it's a question you wouldn't want to answer. Is it a printer question? It is, and I can speak specifically to it because I understand.\n\n0:50:08 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou do the printer question and I'm going to play with my Atari.\n\n0:50:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo this comes in from David, who's in our discord, and David writes greetings Leo and Mikah, longtime listener of Leo's since ZDTV days, hoping you can offer a solution to my problem. I have an HP smart print printer. I had been paying every month for HP instant ink as there seemed to be no other option to choose. My big issue is, since I had purchased the printer, I've never received any cartridges from HP, despite being charged $6 per month. To be honest, I rarely print unless it is for postage, so I don't ever make the quota of 50 pages per month.\n\nThe last month they tried to charge me, I had my card account locked to avoid any charges I didn't authorize, so the payment did not go through for HP Instant Ink. They sent me an email that they were disabling Instant Ink on my account, but what they've done is disable my printer. Oh, by the way, that's what they mean. Yes, I no longer have access to print to it. Is this even legal? Is there a solution to my problem other than paying again for Instant Ink? That program claimed to send ink cartridges when they sensed your ink was running low. But, as I stated, I just want to say screw you HP?\n\n0:51:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, they they're. This is, by the way. There are different divisions of HP. They split off. This is the printer group. Their CEO, enrique Lores, said in January he wants to make printing a subscription. I mean, yeah, people who buy printers are investments that don't pay off if they go third party and that's why they have a subscription.\n\n0:51:41 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes. So I want to explain something, david, because you have the benefit of someone who reads the fine print Ha ha print. I didn't mean the pun, but here's how this. Here's how this works. When you get an HP printer that offers HP Instant Ink, you have two options. When you first get the printer, you can either opt to use it without using HP Instant Ink, in which case you buy new cartridges whenever you want to buy new cartridges, and you install them and they work.\n\n0:52:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou buy them from HP.\n\n0:52:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYes, yes, you buy them from HP, very important. Yes, no matter what you're buying them from.\n\nHP, you can't use anybody else's no but this that you can do it without using HP instant ink. You buy the new HP ink cartridges, you install them. However, if you opt into HP instant ink, then you have to do the do it the way that they have it set up. So when you opted into using HP instant ink, you gave them permission to deactivate your printer if you stopped paying for HP Instant Ink. And in fact, what they do and it's really annoying is that HP Instant Ink cartridges are actually higher yield cartridges than the non-HP Instant Ink cartridges. So they send you an HP Instant Ink cartridge and the moment you install it into the printer, it is activated as part of your subscription. The second you stop paying, that HP instant ink cartridge will no longer print. Your printer will no longer print. The only way to get out of it is by buying HP ink cartridges that are not part of the HP instant ink cartridge subscription anymore.\n\n0:53:13 - Leo Laporte\n\nIn other other words, pay your subscription because the reason it hasn't sent you more is because you're not using yes it.\n\n0:53:19 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt doesn't just send them willy-nilly, it only sends them when you've run out of ink. And what?\n\n0:53:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nwell, when you go low, when you go low, the idea being well, we're going to get that to you before you'll need it and and this is the other thing too is that, yes, unfortunately, you have to keep paying.\n\n0:53:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBut what? But if you had run up to that 50 pages, then that's where they would start charging you more. I think you're in the lowest tier subscription, and so you haven't run up against the 50.\n\n0:53:46 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo that's the agreement Because the printer's like 100 bucks Print is cheap Because they know that you're going to get six bucks a month from you for the rest of your life. That's still only 72 a year. It's not. If I mean, in the old days, printers would cost hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars. If you like the printer. I think it's not unreasonable now.\n\nLoris even said, when asked this was in a cnbc interview at davos when asked, well, what you're going to? You're going to break the printer if they don't use your ink? He says yes, because there's a lot of IP intellectual property built into the inks of the printheads, in the printheads itself in the printers. What we're doing when identify cartridges that are violating our intellectual property? We stop the printer from working. He says it can create all kinds of issues from the printer not working because the inks haven't been designed to work in our printers, to even security issues. We have seen that you can embed the ink viruses in the cartridges, through the cartridges to the printer, from the printer to the network, so it can create many more problems. This is not true. I was going to say just In 2022, they had a bug bounty.\n\nThey actually paid hackers to write a program to put malware on a print cartridge. Nobody's tried it before, just to try to prove it. And all it was able to do was to buffer, overflow the printer. There's no evidence it was coming out of the printer. Nobody's ever done that. Nobody coming out of the printer. Nobody's ever done that, nobody. There are printer hacks in the world, mostly their network hacks, yeah, even then it's on like microsoft side yeah, it's not.\n\n0:55:20 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's so this is just be honest, that's all like. Like we all know that you are subsidizing, yeah, and so just say that because you don't need to lie about all this other nonsense? What? Here's my last thing, though if you don't need color for your printing, just get that brother printer that everybody else has. There's that one brother printer that every person has, and the the toner that comes with it. Even though it's a sample cartridge or a sample, what do they call them? Are they still called cartridges when they're? Yeah? It's a yeah, their cartridge lasts for ages.\n\n0:55:57 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd then when you buy the next one, which I'm now on my second one oh, you have actually gotten one. Yeah, that one's going to last forever and it's like 5,000 pages.\n\n0:56:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThere. It is the best exactly, so we've included a link to it. This Brother printer is incredible.\n\n0:56:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's a laser printer. That's the difference. It's not color.\n\n0:56:11 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, so if you need, color, I mean look, If you need color. I have an HP printer and that Brother printer actually, and I use the InstaInk subscription and I understand that that's how it works. But, honestly, for me it's less expensive than every couple of years buying a new HP printer when I need it because the printh print heads are no longer working or whatever.\n\n0:56:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe Brother HL-L2350. I have it at home. You have it at home Because it just goes forever. The heads don't get clogged, it's black and white. I mean, who prints that much anymore? I print maybe boarding passes for an air flight. I print more often because what do you print, burke? He prints stuff. That's what he prints. Stuff most is mostly for us. It's mostly like he hangs, like he put things on my door, he puts little signs on my door, stuff like that, that's all it says burke wasZ yeah.\n\nI poop on racists Whatever. He prints little signs for me and puts them on my door. But honestly, all the rhetoric aside, I don't think it's unreal.\n\n0:57:28 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAs long as HP should just be up front, just be up front.\n\n0:57:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nWe're basically giving you the printer. The money we make comes from you buying the cartridges. You know that's the deal. You buy an hp printer, you're going to subscribe to the cartridges. That's the deal. There's a certain amount of uh confidence that comes with the fact that you're using legit cartridges. They replace the printhead with each cartridge, so he's saying, in effect, that is the printer. What you're buying is a thing to hold the printer and you're buying new printers every month, a new print head and new ink and all that. And it's not. It's not more expensive than it would be to buy a printer, although that brother's like $120, it's not hugely expensive. So, uh, and then you know other companies are doing tank printers. Now Epson pioneered that because they're recognizing that people don't want this cartridge. Yeah, but if you'd want good color printing and you and you want photo printing and that kind of stuff, it's not unreasonable to get.\n\n0:58:25 - Mikah Sargent\n\nNo, and the instant ink program includes a little package so they can recycle the cartridges which I think is good, which is really nice.\n\n0:58:31 - Leo Laporte\n\nOtherwise they go in the landfill. So you know, know, it's just.\n\n0:58:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThey just be upfront about it but yeah, if you're trying to, if you want to get out of the instant ink thing and just buy them from now on, um, that is something again that you can do. I what? I'm what's not clear. You may have to pay one more time to reactivate the subscription, to reactivate the printer, but then at that point you can say I want to cancel my HP Instinct subscription. You may even be able to do it without I'm not sure about that and then from that point on, you just have to buy cartridges that are not part of the Instinct, but that's a pain.\n\n0:59:02 - Leo Laporte\n\nNobody wants to go to Office Depot and buy cartridges.\n\n0:59:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nExactly, or even order them online and wait for them and not know if they're.\n\n0:59:10 - Leo Laporte\n\nThis is an article from a year ago on the Verge. Nilay Patel says the brother, whatever printer, it's a printer that just prints and everybody you know already has one and it's true, you have one, I have one. Because eventually you kind of come to the conclusion that you just don't want to deal with all this cartridge stuff anyway one way or the other. And I'm just going to get a laser 120 bucks. The biggest expense is paper.\n\n0:59:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRight, that's a good question, great question and it was a printer, but it was still good yeah, no, it's a, but that's a printer question I can get into.\n\n0:59:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, not, why is?\n\n0:59:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nit not connecting it, don't worry, I made sure not to.\n\n0:59:48 - Leo Laporte\n\nI filtered out those types of printer questions just for you, Leo epson used to sponsor the radio show you may remember, for a long time, and I I thought I had a great relationship. Then one day they said well, we, we don't want to sponsor you, you're too political, because he was talking about printers too much I, I don't.\n\nI couldn't understand it. It was like what do you mean me? I'm not political at all. But they said no, they can't. I think it was because I was on the same network as rush limbaugh at the time and I think that they probably just decided they didn't want to be on iHeart or something I don't know Political, no, it's just a computer talk show.\n\n1:00:22 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo, Leo, before you answer the email, I actually have a phone caller who's been waiting a little bit.\n\n1:00:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh, well, put him on, put him on, yeah, yeah.\n\n1:00:28 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYou need a star six, if you please.\n\n1:00:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nI bet you most of the inkjet printer companies become subscription inkjet printer companies.\n\n1:00:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt makes sense. Hey, what's your?\n\n1:00:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nfirst name and what's your city?\n\n1:00:48 - Caller\n\nThis is Neil in Chandler, Arizona. How are you Nice to talk to you guys. Are you calling?\n\n1:00:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nfrom a church choir room.\n\n1:00:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's a little echoey. Get up a little closer to the microphone. What's your name?\n\n1:01:01 - Caller\n\nOh, actually I'm using Neil. Hi Neil, let me switch over. I was using my hearing aids.\n\n1:01:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh no, what? No, the hearing aids don't have microphones. Just talk closer to the phone. Your hearing aids are fine, just talking to the phone. Oh okay, is that better? Yeah, is that a little better? Yeah, hi, neil, it's good to talk to you again. What's up?\n\n1:01:20 - Caller\n\nOkay, a couple of simple questions, I think, first of all, I'm watching the show. I'm watching it with YouTube, but I like to watch it on the big TV. I was going to try and use it from the Discord and AirPlay it out to the television instead, because I have an Apple TV, but it doesn't seem to offer that functionality. It does not.\n\n1:01:44 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt does not. Your computer could do it Well. No, you should be able to full screen it.\n\nYou're probably used to the normal way of AirPlaying, right the way where you uh see the little airplay icon and you can play something from that. But, um, let's, actually, can we switch to airplay one here in a moment? Uh, john, um, so I'm thinking that what you can probably do is, instead of doing uh, just a straight up air, you use the screen mirroring functionality. So I have turned on screen mirroring on my iPhone and we'll show that on AirPlay 1 in just a moment, and I am in the Discord while I am screen mirroring, and then what I'm going to do here, as soon as we can show it on screen, is I'm going to join the stage, and so it's unlike a typical AirPlay session where you are actually taking something from your phone and shifting it to the screen. You're just mirroring from one device to the other.\n\nSo I can or your Mac, you can you can do this from your Mac as well. Is it still not popping up, john? Okay, let me switch away really quick to AirPlay 2 and we'll switch back, and so with this, you should be able to then screen mirror the content. So I have joined the stage and I am able to watch this on my screen, and I can, of course, there we go, so you can see up in the top and this, of course is so now this is your iPhone screen, yes, and I should be able to take this video here and make it full.\n\nLet me see how to do that.\n\n1:03:26 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo basically, you're in Discord on your iPhone. This would work on a Mac as well. Yes, it would. And you AirPlay to your Apple TV as well? Yes, it would. And you air play to your apple tv yeah, I'm not sure how to make it go full screen here, but oh, maybe it doesn't though, see, that's I had. I was under the impression that they don't do that. There we go. Oh look, he's doing it.\n\n1:03:42 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo obviously it's really a great way to watch there.\n\n1:03:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt's because it yeah. You have to wait now because it was playing itself.\n\n1:03:52 - Mikah Sargent\n\nyeah, so now you can see that it's actually playing the screen. So, yes, and the way that you get to do that at home.\n\n1:03:59 - Leo Laporte\n\nNo, no, no, no.\n\n1:03:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo the way that you get to screen mirroring is you will go into your control center on your phone and in control center you've got a screen mirroring option, and then you would choose your Apple TV from here.\n\n1:04:16 - Leo Laporte\n\nSo it's not using the facilities of Discord to do it. You're just watching the video on your device and then using the device to airplay Exactly.\n\n1:04:19 - Caller\n\nDoes that make sense? Well, thank you. Well, my main question thank you for that. Sure, Neil, I don't mind using YouTube. It's just that sometimes it's hard to find the live feed for the show.\n\n1:04:29 - Leo Laporte\n\nBy the way, Neil, some of the people in the Discord are saying that some hearing aids do allow you to use them as Bluetooth headsets Mine. I use the microphone on the phone and I have the hearing aids make the sound. Would you do just to see it? What kind of hearing aids do you have?\n\n1:04:46 - Caller\n\nA Phonak.\n\n1:04:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nPhonak. Maybe the Phonaks do that. Tap your hearing aids. Let me see. Yeah, these are like they're expensive. They're about $3,000.\n\n1:04:52 - Caller\n\nYeah, I your hearing aids, let me see. Yeah, these are like you know, these are like they're expensive. They're about three thousand dollars. Yeah, I know hearing aids are outrageous.\n\n1:04:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, uh, I'm going to a new audiologist in a month. You know why? Yeah, because I have tinnitus, the ringing in the ears, you know. And uh, it's gotten worse and worse. Basically, it sounds right now it sounds like there's a tea kettle in the room and it's always blowing and I can't take it off the stove. I think I would be- it drives you nuts.\n\nSo there is a treatment that came out of Germany that the FDA has approved now, called Lenire L-E-N-I-R-E, and I found an audiologist down the road, a piece in Marin County, that does the Lenire treatment. So May 2nd I'm going in for my consultation. I will let you all know, because I know that about 5% to 10% of you also have a ringing in your ears. If this treatment works, you're going to see a new man. I'll be tap dancing before you know it. So anyway, that's a little side note, and I might at the time get new hearing aids. You like the Phonax?\n\n1:06:00 - Caller\n\nI'm using the resounds right well, they work very well. They actually work very well. It was funny I was going to um buy, um, you know the over, not over the counter hearing aids, but they had them on cheap. They were advertising. Yeah nowadays, yeah, yeah jabras are everybody's recommending.\n\nYeah yeah, but that's what I was looking at the jabra, and I was thinking about getting the Jabra and then I contacted my insurance. They'd cover them and they said, well, you need to get an audio exam. I said, okay, that's reasonable enough. I went and got the, went to the audiologist and then she got me to take, you know, she wanted me to get real hearing, if not those Jabras, and the insurance paid almost like 500 bucks. Okay, well, that's good, I have good insurance, you have good insurance. It's only costing like $500.\n\n1:06:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou have better insurance than I do. Go ahead. What can we do for you?\n\n1:06:44 - Caller\n\nWell. I did have.\n\nOkay. So here's my question. I have an iPad 2018, ipad Pro 11-inch. I've had it for several years. It seems fine, except the cat decided that he wanted to knock it out of my hand one day and it kind of chipped the corner of the screen. It still works otherwise. You have a glass kind of split. But the question I guess comes down to and this is maybe a Mikah question or both of you whether it's worth repairing. And I know that Apple charges $500 for that screen repair. But I can buy a new iPad, you know, for only a couple hundred more. So I guess that's my point is what the best course for the otherwise functional iPad, whether I should replace it or just get $500 to get the screen repaired.\n\n1:07:34 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh, ok, this is a tough one, we should mention the new iPads are coming out.\n\n1:07:39 - Leo Laporte\n\nwe think that is true. We may see some new iPads soon. In a few weeks, in early May. May 6th is the current rumor.\n\n1:07:46 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, so that's something to keep in mind if you decide to go the route of replacing 2018's. Not that long ago, so it's still a pretty powerful laptop I mean basically iPad. It's mostly about that. It bothers you, right? It is not messing with the functioning of the display.\n\n1:08:05 - Leo Laporte\n\nI have to say, though be careful, because it can cut you. Yes, that is yes, Since you're touching the display and rubbing your finger.\n\n1:08:14 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSay that again.\n\n1:08:15 - Caller\n\nYeah, it's just in the corner, yeah but if you rub, your finger Say that again.\n\n1:08:17 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, it's just in the corner?\n\n1:08:18 - Caller\n\nYeah, but if you move your finger?\n\n1:08:19 - Leo Laporte\n\nthere. It's otherwise functional. Yeah, you know, it's up to you, just as you say does it bother you? Yeah, yeah.\n\n1:08:29 - Mikah Sargent\n\nBecause you could always put a case on it that covers the corner, in which case that you don't even have to worry about it. Yeah, this is really I don't either is a good option. It boils down to what you want. If you want the newest, latest, greatest, wait until May-ish and get the newest, latest, greatest for a couple hundred dollars more. If you don't feel like you need the new, then and you have to replace or repair it, then yeah, five hundred dollars or whatever it will be for you is is worth it. Eventually, that price will go down and the crack will expand.\n\n1:09:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's true too. Uh, that's been my experience. Um, I don't I have. It's been a while since I broke a screen.\n\n1:09:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nMy daughter breaks them pretty regularly and it's usually a little crack starts out, just it gets bigger and bigger yeah any stresses put on it are going to start to grow that so I would. I would not be in a hurry if you can live with it, and I would wait until wait at least until may, because if you wanted to, you then could buy a newer, but not the latest ipad to replace it and you maybe even come out breaking close to even uh on on getting a repair.\n\n1:09:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nNow here's what again. We don't know exactly, but the rumor is Apple has new iPads Pro with OLED screens, which will be gorgeous, and those. The latest thing I saw is that the 11-inch they're having a little trouble with. They had some trouble with the software, they had some trouble with the software, there's some trouble with the screens, but they I think the pros are for sure coming out in may, but the 11th might be hard to get. But the real question is are they going to do an iPad air? Are they going to do an iPad mini? We love the mini. It's way overdue for update. They won't be OLED, but are they going to update those? So I suspect it's at least worth waiting a few weeks and then I would. I would start thinking about getting a new one. That crack is not going to yeah, it's not going to keep small forever. And 500 bucks forget it now. You could go to I fix it, do it yourself. I don't recommend. It's very hard to do so 500 bucks, I read the directions.\n\n1:10:35 - Caller\n\nIt looks fairly complicated.\n\n1:10:36 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOh yeah, you don't want to do it. I enjoy it, but it's not for everyone. Yeah.\n\n1:10:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think we're going to see new iPads and I think this is just a perfect time to do it and then keep the cat away from the iPad from now on.\n\n1:10:51 - Caller\n\nI've been really lucky so far that he had his own ideas of the time. You know how cats are, that's all cats have.\n\n1:10:58 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey don't have anything but their own ideas, non-stop great to talk to you.\n\n1:11:08 - Caller\n\nI'm a club member now since the beginning and we've talked several times over the years and I've bought many products from the radio show. I still make audible subscriptions from the radio show all the way from. I still make audible subscription from 2011. Nice, plus a few other, a lot of other products that you recommended. They're all very good by the way, over the years.\n\n1:11:23 - Leo Laporte\n\nI think we've done pretty well with our sponsors. There's been a few duds Can't help it. Sometimes that happens. They're good when we start, but I'm glad you're happy and I love having you in the club. Thank you, neil, I really appreciate it. Thank you so much, Leo.

Okay, I'm nervous now. Yeah, when john?\n\n1:14:31 - Mikah Sargent\n\nashley says good, so that's a good one to answer john of gray ghost productions.\n\n1:14:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nOh thanks, john. Uh, john, from burlington, ontario, I am in the line of totality for the eclipse tomorrow, nice tomorrow. I am wondering if there's anything special I need to protect my pixel 6a and my Rebel T5 taking pictures of the eclipse. Yeah, because normally you don't shoot into the sun, do you? I just saw a great article on shooting the eclipse with an Android device, I think with a Pixel, in fact. So let me pull that up. You know, when you're in totality, you don't have to worry, right, because it's dark enough, you're going to get the corona.\n\nThis is from Google Six tips to capture the solar eclipse with your pixel. A pixel camera expert shares which features. So I would read this for sure. This is on the Google keyword blog Cool, if you're in the area, area of totality. Now, look, they've got a whole bunch of stuff. They say well, you should definitely bring your camera. Your don't, by the way, don't cheap out on those goggles, baby, get them from the planetary society because, uh, you don't want to. There are a lot of people at least it happened last, last time selling what they claim are Eclipse viewing goggles. That were not, and you're going to burn your retina. You're going to have permanent damage.\n\n1:16:01 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLook at this time. It's kind of hard to get them ordered If you are in the area where there's a Warby Parker. Warby Parker is making many available, in some cases for free, is what I've heard and they are sourced properly from warby parker.\n\n1:16:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nthey are genuine eclipse glasses uh, they say, use a tripod. I don't think you necessarily need to use a tripod. That's one thing pixels do very well. They say you can trust the camera to do the work. During the eclipse, the sky will gradually get darker, oh, really oh, as the moon slowly passes between us and the sun. The pixel phone has automatic settings that can handle this. The screen auto adjusts. Night sight will kick in when the light gets low enough. Right, they do say and this is true of all photography practice, practice, practice, prepare as best you can create a fake eclipse in your home to practice.\n\nYeah, do not, though and this is a surprise to me use the astrophotography settings, because that is a four-minute exposure and the totality is only around four minutes, so you're not going to get what you think. You don't want to spend that all in one photo. They say Experiment with different compositions, move the sun around, take any photos.\n\nThis is always the advice with digital Just keep shooting right, you're going to focus on infinity, but the phone will do that automatically, but your Canon will not. So make sure your Canon is set to focus to infinity your sensor from the bright light of the sun. Uh, you, I think you're. You're probably all right, don't.\n\n1:17:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nDon't point your camera at the sun until it starts to get right. Don't keep it there maybe the whole time, but once and yes, poco in the chat. Uh, this was also something that uh rod pile spaceman suggested is uh, to test your glasses, put them on and look at a light.\n\n1:18:01 - Leo Laporte\n\nYou should see nothing.\n\n1:18:02 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd if you see the light, then they're not good enough.\n\n1:18:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nI hesitate to say those kinds of things Just in case it's, that's not really.\n\n1:18:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's not the whole kit, and caboodle.\n\n1:18:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, go to eclipseglassescom and at least read about. Let me pull this up Eclipseglassescom is the Planetary Society and Bill Nye, the science guy's site for this. They are selling them, but obviously it's a little too late for that, since Eclipse as we speak today is tomorrow. But they do talk a little bit about what makes safe glasses and you really have to pay attention.\n\n1:18:39 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's more thorough than just looking at the light.\n\n1:18:41 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, just looking at the light, I guess, is better than nothing.\n\n1:18:45 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThan nothing, but don't take that as its own.\n\n1:18:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, I don't want you to damage your eyes, so learn what you can about what Eclipse Safety. They have a whole page on Eclipse Safety.\n\n1:18:57 - Mikah Sargent\n\nAnd NASA is not in the business of approving or disproving any glasses. So if you see nasa approved, that's a lie yeah, there you go.\n\n1:19:06 - Leo Laporte\n\nThere is a standard, though. There's an nsf standard, national safety, fun guys, I don't know. Probably foundation, foundation, you think I don't know. Um core four method to see if your glasses are faith safe the core four.\n\nThat sounds cool this is mostly who you get it from. Um, yeah, this is not uh, but you want the iso certification. That's it, iso, and the iso certification is one, two, three. I can't read it. My eyes are damaged. He's got his eclipse glasses. One, two, three, one, two, dash two. One, two, three, one, two, dash two. Unfortunately, there's nothing to stop uh, an evil manufacturer, from putting that on their glasses.\n\nThat's why you just know, oh so, um, yeah, I mean geez louise. So, uh, and I guess at this point you're gonna be making your own, and I've heard all sorts of horror recipes, but I've also heard plenty of horror stories.\n\n1:20:12 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRod talked about uh having to get cataract surgery at 40. Because what horror story. Yeah so rod looked at the sun rod was using a telescope with a uh, with a lens that was supposed to be focuses it right. Yeah, and come to be 40 years old.\n\n1:20:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nBoth of his lenses were just wrecked you know what the fun thing to do is during an eclipse is not look at the eclipse, but look. I'll never forget this. We were walking down the street during the eclipse and the trees, the sunlight through the trees. And then you look during the eclipse and the trees, the sunlight through the trees, and then you look at the sunlight and you can see the eclipse. Yeah, you can actually see, because the tree leaves are acting like a little pinhole camera.\n\nAnd of course, that's what they always tell you to do, and this never was satisfying, as we did in school. You make a shoebox with a hole in it, and then you look at the shoebox instead of the sun. Box with a hole in it, and then you look at the shoe box instead of the sun. That's no fun. It's really hard, though, because it feels like it's safe, because it feels like it's dark. Yep, don't, don't do it. Don't look at the tree shadows instead. Uh, evanescence photos. Asking was there a spec for welding glasses? Yeah, we talked about it, but I don't remember what it is. Was it number 14?\n\n1:21:18 - Mikah Sargent\n\ndo some research. I can just look at all of the many, many, many photos that are going to be posted everywhere of the eclipse.\n\n1:21:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nI would suggest, though, if you even don't have, look. First of all, people are saying well, I'm not in a totality, so forget it. No, it will still, be even here.\n\nIt'll be eerie because it will get dark. Yeah, it won't be total. You won. I think it's 30-some percent. Yeah, even that, you'll notice it. So I'm getting my car washed tomorrow, so that should be a good time to have a little fun with the eclipse. Anyway, be outside, listen for the animals, listen for the birds. They'll get quiet. They think this is strange. Some of them will start to begin their sleep pattern. Yeah, what time is it tomorrow here? I don't know, I can't remember. There's some great websites for it. This is where the web really is, your friend.\n\nThe web is your friend here at NASA's site has a good Sciencenasagov slash eclipses Explicit score. Explicit score, so it'll be 11.07 Pacific time. See, all you have to do is put in your zip code right here. It knows where I am, so it tells me, and we're going to get 32% and the time to the eclipse 22 hours from now It'll be 59 degrees and should be clear. So it'll be fun Meteorologist. Yeah, there you go. I excited, are you excited?\n\nyes I've last big eclipse, uh. We went down to australia to see it and on a cruise it was a geek cruise, uh, and it was cloudy, so don't be sad if it's cloudy. Who is it we talked to? That was going to, uh, to that would be scott wilkinson was it scott.\n\n1:23:05 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, scott's going down there. I know jesus now is going down snell's also going down.\n\n1:23:09 - Leo Laporte\n\nHe's flying down. It's a big deal. Be a lot of fun, uh, and take lots of pictures, I guess, but don't look directly at the sun. Actually, that's why a phone is a great way to do it, because you're looking at a screen. The problem with the dslr is you're looking through the lens at the sun, exactly. That's a little riskier. Stick with the phone. What would you like to do next? John ashley, coming up in about 20 minutes.\n\n1:23:34 - Caller\n\nJohnny jet, our travel guy I'm gonna pick up on a caller who has their hand raised in Zoom.\n\n1:23:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nRich, come on down. I thought was this a guy earlier? I thought Rich might have passed on. He had fallen asleep and I thought maybe he was a goner. But no, he's still here. He woke up. Rich, does he have to do anything?\n\n1:24:09 - Mikah Sargent\n\nnot if, yeah, not if you're a call or if you're a video person video, god. I see they're loaded in, so we just you know have to unsilence yourself.\n\n1:24:20 - Leo Laporte\n\nDid you see that twitter is giving? Gave me back my blue check.\n\n1:24:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nWere you the one that got one.\n\n1:24:24 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, that's what you know. I did not pay Elon anything for that and I don't want it, but I got it. It's because I have half a million followers on. Twitter Elon's trying to encourage me to participate. Ooh, he's emerging from the Stargate, hello, hey what's your? Name. Hello. Rich from Rochester, New York. Beautiful Rochester, New York, home of Kodak.\n\n1:24:48 - Caller\n\nYes, and I'm going to be close to totality, but almost.\n\n1:24:53 - Leo Laporte\n\nAlmost is really still very fun. Yeah, Very cool. What can we do for you?\n\n1:24:57 - Caller\n\nRich Crazy Mike. I think this is a question for you. What can we do for you? Rich Crazy Mikah, I think this is a question for you. I'm not a real Apple guy myself, but my wife has an iPad and the iPad won't connect to Bitwarden using the Chrome browser on her iPad. It just kind of sits there and spins.\n\n1:25:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nOkay, so to clarify, you are wanting to use the within the Chrome browser. You want to use the plug in to connect to Bitwarden, not going to the website.\n\n1:25:38 - Caller\n\nNo, this is going to the website. It's not using an extension or anything like that. Put in the Bitwarden website login, whatever you want to call it, and it would just spin and not connect so that she can sign in either.\n\n1:25:56 - Mikah Sargent\n\nRight, okay, this is interesting because, technically, as it stands right now, every single browser that's on an iPad, on an iPhone, on any of Apple's devices, is using the Safari engine in the background. So Chrome is, it's basically a it's like a Safari wearing a Google costume, and so the fact that it's not loading through Google Chrome. I'm trying to think of what could be happening here. There could be some settings maybe. Maybe some JavaScript is turned off or something. I don't know. Go ahead, go ahead.\n\n1:26:47 - Leo Laporte\n\nLook into all the settings on the Chrome thing to see if it, you know, would let you know something with passwords or whatever. Here's what I would do to start, and this is always a solution on Chrome, you can show my. Can you see my screen here? All right, so I'm in Chrome on the iPhone, but it's going to be the same on iPad and if you go into settings, you'll see clear browsing data. Little trash can next to it. Absolutely do that and, and you don't have to be notice, it starts with everything checked. You could uncheck, uh, a few of them, but honestly, I would clear it all and uh, and, knowing that you're in it, it's the cache.\n\n1:27:21 - Caller\n\nSorry, we've tried that with just deleting the cache and stuff like that, I would delete the cookies.\n\n1:27:30 - Leo Laporte\n\nI mean you slowly add more and more things because something in there is almost certainly what's going on. This is, yes, it's Safari, but Chrome has its own storage, so I would suggest absolutely clearing that.\n\n1:27:43 - Mikah Sargent\n\nJust out of curiosity for troubleshooting, did your wife try doing it in Safari? Does the Bitwarden website work there?\n\n1:27:52 - Caller\n\nNo, we didn't try anything by looking at Safari, and I don't even know if that's on her iPad or not.\n\n1:28:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt would almost certainly be I don't think you can get rid of it.\n\n1:28:03 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's one of the things they're fighting with the EU about the reason to try that is just to see if, because if it also is doing this in Safari, then that means we know it's a system level setting that needs to be changed. There's something going on at the system level. If it does work in Safari, that definitely narrows it down to something going wrong with the system level. If it does work in Safari, that definitely narrows it down to something going wrong with the Chrome browser, and so what we'd be able to do is kind of go from there. So I definitely, at some point I would give that a try. Another suggestion that I would have is, if all else fails, if you try what Leo suggested, with a complete kind of removal of everything, deleting and reinstalling the Chrome app on the phone could sometimes kick through, whatever is causing the issue.\n\nBut yeah, I would start with going into Safari. If it doesn't work there, then you could either email us, give us a call back, because there's something else going on that is more at the system level, because there are some things that, again at the system level, safari's engine could be doing, where it's just having trouble syncing up with the Bitwarden website. I know that Bitwarden now works with Passkeys, for example, and it could be trying to autofill. When I went to the Bitwarden website, one of the first things it did was say it kind of tried to sync with Bitwarden in the moment and then it let me through. Maybe there's something going on where yours is not clicking through. So those are some options there that might be at issue.\n\n1:29:35 - Leo Laporte\n\nI would also suggest two things. One is turn the phone off and on Yep. Honestly, I don't know why, but I don't do it very often. My wife needs to reboot her iPhone almost every day. It just gets weird and wonky. So you know, you press and hold the volume up and on off screen on off and button and then slide to turn it off. You don't have to do a hard reboot, Just slide to turn it off and then turn it on again. And then, finally, the best way to use Bitwarden on the iPhone or the iPad is with the app. There's a Bitwarden app and that's easier, frankly, in my opinion, than going to the browser to get your passwords.\n\nThat's the way she was using it. So I guess I had to go with that. Yeah, well, if all else fails, yeah. But I think that those, all these troubleshooting things, are the standard troubleshooting things you do at any time an app doesn't work well. Clear the cache, you know, clear the data, uninstall, reinstall, reboot the phone, those things it's it's worth doing, all of those, I think if you, if you do the bookmarks, that takes away all the like places she's signed into and everything else.\n\nYeah, that's why you kind of do it. Cookies are where all that stuff stored is cookies, um, okay, so that's why you want to slowly increase the number of things you're clearing, uh, until it works. But the but, the truth is it's the cat, it's probably the cash, the data cash. If not clear. If clearing that didn't fix it, it could be that it has a bad cookie. You can be selective in clearing cookies, so clear the bit warden cookies, uh, from the bit warden site. Make sure her day and date is correct on her phone. I don't see how it could possibly not be, but that's always another thing.\n\n1:31:17 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIf the certificate doesn't work, then the site won't load um, and just to check, I did go to Bitwarden's website in Chrome on my phone and it is working here, so it's not like a system issue on there, so it's her machine itself, and that's why we're focusing on the stuff that's unique to her, like the cache.\n\n1:31:37 - Leo Laporte\n\nThat's something you know and it's very. This happens a lot with browsing, where you start caching data or saving cookies that get corrupted and then the and then the website tries to load them goes I. I don't know what to do now, and that's could very well be what's going on okay, well, all right, thanks a lot.\n\n1:31:54 - Caller\n\nI think you give me a lot of good ideas and and stuff like that. Oh, it's right you called see this girl later and she can uh listen to it and do whatever you guys?\n\n1:32:03 - Leo Laporte\n\nwhat's her name? Carol. Hi, carol, hope this works. Good luck, take care very good thanks guys bye, bye, take care, I am wearing my uh seaweed sweater. Do you want to touch me? Come on, touch the seaweed. It's nice, nice Huh.\n\n1:32:21 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, it's a lot more woven. It's a lot tighter woven than I thought it was going to be.\n\n1:32:25 - Leo Laporte\n\nIt is. In fact, they call it a summer sweater. This is from Oliver Charles. I'm not doing an ad for them, I just Okay, it was the middle of the night. I'm on Instagram. I see this video of them harvesting seaweed in the clean fjords of Iceland and I thought why am I seeing this video? And they said now you can have a sweater made from this seaweed. Wow. And I, before I could even stop myself, I bought it. And that's the problem with Apple. Pay is so easy, it makes it. I'm just looking at the phone. It goes okay, you got it. And it's like no, not bad, too late. Anyway, I like it.\n\n1:33:00 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's um you know there was uh just a court filing with the ftc from meta that shows instagram makes more money from ads than youtube does.\n\n1:33:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nInstagram for years makes more money was 32 billion in a year.\n\n1:33:16 - Mikah Sargent\n\nI think something like that, compared to 28.8 from youtube instagram makes, makes.\n\n1:33:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nAnd how does it make that money? Leo, ding ding, ding ding. Me Buying everything I see in the middle of the night. You don't want to know how much Instagram stuff I'm wearing right now.\n\n1:33:32 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a good thing you don't have sleep issues where you would need to take that sleep medication, because then you'd buy even more. Oh if.\n\n1:33:38 - Leo Laporte\n\nI took Ambien, Ambien yeah, bad news medication, because then you'd buy even more. Oh, if I took Ambien? Ambien. Yeah, Bad news. I gave you the garden though you did. That was one of the things I bought from Instagram last year.\n\n1:33:47 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's a hydroponic garden in your home Very cool, with its own lighting and everything.\n\n1:33:50 - Leo Laporte\n\nIs it?\n\n1:33:50 - Mikah Sargent\n\nworking. Is it doing it? Yeah, it connected with the Wi-Fi.\n\n1:33:52 - Caller\n\nThe lights are on. The lights are on. It's very bright, isn't it? It is.\n\n1:33:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nIt's like daytime it's a little bright, bright and then you're gonna have lettuce uh-huh, I'm very excited for the lettuce, the radishes, all of that cucumber, yeah is that what you're gonna grow?\n\n1:34:07 - Leo Laporte\n\nyeah, you can get one cucumber, that's all I need. It's not very big right, I mean it's yeah, because it's a little pods is is its own little thing.\n\n1:34:15 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThink about growing some sunflowers as well.\n\n1:34:18 - Leo Laporte\n\nVery pretty flowers my experience was it's the leafy greens are probably the best way, because otherwise you don't have a lot of room. Right, you know we you'd grow one tomato, uh, another, wonderful instagram purchase.\n\n1:34:33 - Mikah Sargent\n\nLeo, do we need to talk about your addiction to buy things on instagram? Do we need to have intervention? You want to touch my sweater?\n\n1:34:40 - Leo Laporte\n\nit's really nice, it's actually nice, it's actually summer weight. They say as you wear it, it will conform to your body, which means it's tight but it stretches a little bit. I've washed it once just to see how it handled here he comes, just be thrown in the washing machine.\n\n1:34:54 - Mikah Sargent\n\nCome on, touch my sweater.\n\n1:34:56 - Leo Laporte\n\nNot the velvet coat.\n\n1:34:59 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSee, it's different. It's tighter woven than I was thinking. They do 3d knitting. You know that there's no seam. What does that mean? They knit it as a tube. Oh, I see. Okay, it's a seamless design. Wait, so are the arms seamless too? Such a sucker, I guess. Is there not a? No, there's no seams. Okay, that's actually.\n\n1:35:21 - Leo Laporte\n\nThe whole thing is knitted in one piece.\n\n1:35:23 - Mikah Sargent\n\nThat's actually really cool. Okay, now I'm going to buy one In Brooklyn. Stupid, stupid. They knit them in Brooklyn and they're made in Brooklyn.\n\n1:35:28 - Leo Laporte\n\nThey're made in Brooklyn. Look see, I got the check on my. It's bad On my Twitter, all of a. You go wait a minute. I didn't pay for that. This account is verified. Verified since 2010. Oh, so you did get it. I like that. It goes back to I got the full.\n\nIt went right back at the full thing and apparently I can use Grok and all and I can post video and stuff. I'm not going to Not that he's going to but yeah, I don't want to support Elon and his weird Weirdness, weirdness, pro nazis propaganda. But yeah, I think there were a lot of people who tweeted like molly white said no, no, I didn't pay for that no, yeah, it's yeah.\n\n1:36:08 - Mikah Sargent\n\nFor some people it's kind of like I don't want, I didn't.\n\n1:36:11 - Leo Laporte\n\nI don't want to be verified, uh 2000 accounts with 2500 verified subscriber followers will get a free premium membership if you have over 5 000 uh free premium plus yeah.\n\n1:36:24 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSo to be clear, they have the people who are following. You have to be paid subscribers. You have to have 2 500 people who are following you, who are paid subscribers of twitter, at where of x, at which point then you get your verification, which means you have to have like a million yeah, because like I've got 8 000 something but they're not all blue checks.\n\n1:36:44 - Leo Laporte\n\nYeah, you need the blue checks, you gotta have the blue. It's kind of sad because like, wow, I now I have all this free stuff and I don't want to, I don't want it.\n\n1:36:55 - Mikah Sargent\n\nYeah, don't, I don't need it. I, I don't want it.\n\n1:37:00 - Leo Laporte\n\nWhat should we do now? Is it time for a pause, a refreshing pause? Let's do a question and then a pause.\n\n1:37:06 - Mikah Sargent\n\nSure. How about this? Voicemail right here.\n\n1:37:12 - Caller\n\nHi, my name is Dale. I'm calling from Knoxville, tennessee. Hi, dale, I have a small digital conversion business and I transfer, like VHS to DVD or VHS to some sort of a flash drive format. I've been using something like SoundBeast or Diamond, these digital converters. I mean they work okay, but I was wondering if there was something that I could use that would be, you know, even be better than than these choices."
