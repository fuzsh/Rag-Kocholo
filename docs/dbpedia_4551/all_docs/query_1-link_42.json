Thanks. --Omolong (talk) 10:47, 24 August 2014 (PDT)\n\nRecent Trivia Edit help because I haven't learned anything from the academy\n\nA lot of what you're posting is not really trivia and doesn't follow the style guide. I strongly recommend you take a look in the trivia style guide before you get in trouble. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 21:36, 11 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nHelp with images\n\nThe Help page is your best friend. Use it. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 18:56, 14 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nDanke, I Mac is a stinker :3\n\nFor new indents, use a colon. Also, don't forget to sign your comments. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 19:43, 14 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nOkey Doke' I'm still new two years in - flammingidiot\n\nYou're signing thenm wrong. It's four tildes. The button that looks like a pencil makes the signature for you. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 14:13, 15 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nMr. Scaphandreltalk, Do you know a easy way to add gallery pictures? I can't figure out how even after seeing the help guide. I have pictures ready too. No hud, good clean photos.\n\n--Flammingidiot (talk) 17:00, 15 October 2015 (PDT)flammingidiot\n\nRegarding images\n\nHeyo, I've noticed you've been trying to put some images into certain pages.\n\nWell to point out, you're doing it wrong. Straight up. The correct way is to physically upload them to the wiki (Upload file on the left side) and then link them internally as seen on other gallery pages. Trying to get the image by just using a website URL does not work. Plus it has more chances to get hit by copyright (which we want to avoid). Ashes (talk) 17:45, 15 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nCheers big fellah. You helped me alot. Check out probe's gallery to see what you did. Bless ya. --Flammingidiot (talk) 17:43, 16 October 2015 (PDT) flammingidiot\n\nStill make use of the show preview button though. You can condense all that into 1. Ashes (talk) 20:11, 16 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nRegarding your recent edits\n\nTo point out again.\n\n1. Use show preview, you keep editing and not using show preview on pages. Each edit that you do can easily be condensed into 1 edit.\n\n2. Do not sign on articles. You did it twice in the gallery stating \"It needed more images\" roughly along those lines. Don't do it. Signing is only meant for talk pages. Leave your comments off the article.\n\n3. Naming of images. If it is going to be specific for a map, make note of the map name in the file so it's easy to identify.\n\nAshes (talk) 18:39, 19 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nYour recent edits.\n\nAshes already told you this, but I'm going to tell you again because I noticed some other stuff.\n\n1. Your links were broken and there were a lot of grammatical errors. For broken links, use the link button next to the signature button to make an easy link. The 'Show Preview' button is your best friend. Use it.\n\n2. Do not sign articles. Signatures are for talk pages. For page changes, you type in the edit summary.\n\n3. Use the style guide for trivia. Your trivia is worded in a confusing way, and over half the stuff you put in isn't even trivia. Also, in some of your trivia additions you said that you didn't know if it was trivia or not. If you don't know 100% whether it is trivia or not, then don't put it in.\n\n4. When submitting images, don't use long joke names like \"Spooky secret room world open 24 hrs.\" That's just confusing for media search and unprofessional. Name it in a way where it's easy to be found in the search bar. Also, please categorize your images to their respecting galleries so Ashes doesn't have too. All you have to do is copy and paste the category's name and put it in brackets. Look at some other images as examples.\n\n--Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 19:33, 19 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nShucks, I apologize fully. I didn't mean to cause trouble. I just got excited to contribute. You've been a major help to me and I appreciate it. --Flammingidiot (talk) 15:57, 20 October 2015 (PDT)flammingidiot\n\nYou shouldn't rush to edit. You should be taking time with your edits to make sure that they're truthful, informative, and clean. Sometimes you should try to experiment with edits in your sandbox, so you can get a feel of what to do. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 16:02, 20 October 2015 (PDT)\n\nHellfire\n\nOkay let's see here. You're getting the right idea so you're on the right path. However, there's some stuff you need improving on.\n\nFor starters, in the infobox, if a map doesn't have a certain type of kit (Like how Hellfire didn't have any small ammo kits), then you can remove that part from the box.\n\nSecondly, your locations need work. The location name is always bold.\n\nThe third thing is more on your images, but I'll talk about that later. Have you been using F12 to take screenshots?\n\nLastly, you have the page out of order. According to the style guide, the gallery goes after the Update History. In fact, I'm pretty sure the gallery can just go in locations since all the images are of locations on the map.\n\nI will give you credit for the captions on the images in the gallery. A lot of editors forget to put any captions at all. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 14:26, 1 November 2015 (PST)\n\nThanks doc! I really appreciate it! Ashes told me if I loused up again I'd get banned' :( I love the new map though. I can't get the environmental hazard to show up. (Fireballs.) I ise f5 for screenshots though. Also, congrats on being wiki cap nominated! --Flammingidiot (talk) 15:32, 1 November 2015 (PST)Flammingidiot\n\nThanks. Being nominated isn't something to write home about though. Although, if they say yes, I can guarantee I'll become an egocentric asshole. (You mean more so then usual? *Rimshot*)\n\nAnyway, back to your edits. So the next thing I wanna talk about is your images. Generally using the Steam screenshot function is frowned upon since the images are not in good quality. See how when you zoom they're blurry?\n\nInstead, what screencappers like myself do is instead use Print Screen. By using Print Screen, the images are nice high def screenshots that don't need to be compressed. Also, it would help if you made sure that you have the graphics as high as they'll go as well.\n\nNext, you're naming your images wrong again. You almost had it right, but you forgot the map name and the gamemode suffix. See the new images as an example.\n\nYou're getting there at least, and your edits have improved a lot. As for Ashes threatening to ban you, don't panic about that. He'll only ban you if you do something ludicrous like putting your signature in your edits. Also, trivia is another factor of why some people are on edge. If you think you found some trivia, you should ask some other users their opinion on whether it is trivia or not to help you get a better understanding.\n\nLastly, I'd like to recommend you plan your edits in a sandbox page. In the sandbox, you can edit and prepare a page as much as you want without it being changed or getting in trouble for it. Here, I made one for you to get you started on the Hellfire edits: User:Flammingidiot/Sandbox --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 16:10, 1 November 2015 (PST)\n\nD Doc' I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship. Or mafia hit list either way I'm prepared! Thanks!\n\n— The preceding unsigned comment was added by Flammingidiot (talk) • (contribs)\n\nI also see that you're making your userpage bigger. If you'd like help let me know. :3\n\nAlso, good job counting the health and ammo kits on Hellfire. I know counting them can be tedious and you did a good job. --Dr. Scaphandre (talk) 10:26, 3 November 2015 (PST)\n\nInfo about me\n\nThe flammingidiot term is used for morons with good intentions. Like flammingidiot, he means well on the wiki, but fails to come with the grade A+ quality. Instead due to ignorance arrives with a C+ ham sandwich. --Flammingidiot (talk) 12:32, 3 November 2015 (PST)flammingidiot\n\nUser Tag\n\nWhen uploading images for use on your user page, please add the prefix User Flammingidiot to the file's name. Thank you. — The preceding assigned comment was added by Tark {Finish Him! ▪ Contribs} 10:28, 4 November 2015 (PST)\n\nVery well' --Flammingidiot (talk) 10:32, 4 November 2015 (PST)flammingidiot\n\nHeyo, For future reference, do NOT create pages in regards to \"Youtubers\" \"Streamers\" etc or anyone that falls under that. We've had issues in the past with Community websites which caused a massive purge as people abused it to advertise on the wiki. This is essentially advertising said person/channel. Your page will be marked for deletion, so for future reference, avoid making these pages. Ashes (talk) 15:17, 7 November 2015 (PST)\n\nTrivia in a nutshell\n\nTrivia entries should be facts, not speculation, not be obvious for somebody who has played Team Fortress 2 for a small amount of time, make the reader say \"Wow! I did not know that! Please visit the style guide thanks. — The preceding assigned comment was added by Tark {Finish Him! ▪ Contribs} 06:54, 9 November 2015 (PST)\n\nShow Preview\n\nPlease make use of the Show preview button. It gives you a preview of the edit you are making, allowing you to perfect your changes before you save the page. You can edit the whole article by clicking the edit button at the top of the page, which is preferable to editing multiple sections consecutively. Ashes (talk) 15:25, 16 April 2017 (PDT)\n\nHey flaming idiot\n\nCan you, like, not make the bare minimum and try to instead make a few of actual quality, any quality at all? A single {{needimage}} template (copied from another article, even) is not quality, it's not a page. It's nothing. Thanks. ⇒ Anyar (talk/contributions/giveaway) 16:09, 22 October 2017 (PDT)\n\nWhile yes there could be more added to the page, you could be more nicer in your comments Anyar. A lot of people edit the way that makes them feel comfortable, like you and your \"Needs update\" posts. -- Dr. Scaphandre 16:20, 22 October 2017 (PDT)\n\nSorry, Flamming, I was being too sarcastic. Still, please try to at least improve the quality a bit and refrain from creating bare-minimal pages. ⇒ Anyar (talk/contributions/giveaway) 16:57, 22 October 2017 (PDT)\n\nYour recent edits\n\nFlamming, I know you've been gone for a while, but I'm gonna be honest your edits are not up to snuff. You have made constant spelling errors, broken pages, only done the bare minimum expecting others to do the work for you, and you haven't even made an attempt to use the Show Preview button.\n\nI think you need to have some practice. Make some sandbox pages and work on the new pages there. -- Dr. Scaphandre 16:55, 25 October 2017 (PDT)\n\nImages + show preview\n\nHi there,\n\nWhen uploading files, please remember to add the appropriate licenses and categories. If you struggle with adding either of these, try looking for similar files and see what they have added. Please also use the show preview buttton to preview changes before they're added to avoid many tiny edits. One big edit is preferred over many small ones.\n\nGrampaSwood (talk) 18:23, 15 July 2023 (UTC)\n\nHi Grandpa sword, I apologize for the multiple edits it has been a long time since I edited on wiki and worked on a new submission with only one edit. All images uploaded are screenshots directly from TF2. Flammingidiot (talk) 18:58, 15 July 2023 (UTC)\n\nWhen you upload them, make sure to also include the appropriate categories and name. For example, the VSH Skirmish images should be uploaded with \"VSH Skirmish\" in the name, as well as with the Category:VSH Skirmish images category.\n\n| s | GrampaSwood (talk) 14:25, 18 July 2023 (UTC)\n\nRegarding quality of uploaded images"
