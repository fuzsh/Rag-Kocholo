        "text": "Well I just need to know how feasible this idea is , church have a broadband connection or I can use 3g USB dongle which is not an issue.\n\nAll I need to know is when I hire a pro video people what feed should I ask them to give it to me. to connect that to the laptop. Thinking to use free services like stickcam , ustream etc\n\nCan't have a webcam Church is too big to cover. I like to transmit the signal the video camera guy takes don't mind a lag of 5 mins etc\n\nany ideas thoughts are welcome.\n\nThat's a tough one, it all depends on how you intend to distribute the video itself? Most webcams can be setup to update a specific image file every X seconds and you could make an FTP connection to some webspace that would automatically upload the file to be in sync with that (or do a local webserver for the remote image link directly to your PC, iffy security). Then you'd just need something like this and you're done:\n\n<img src=\"webcam.jpg\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" border=\"0\" alt=\"Live Webcame\" />\n\nMight need to force the webpage (iframe it all for better integration) to re-fresh as well:\n\n<meta http-equiv=\"refresh\" content=\"10\" />\n\nBut as you're not using a webcam then I don't know what to recommend, these might help though:\n\nhttp://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=465446\n\nhttp://tech.blorge.com/Structure: /2007/03/07/setting-up-your-own-live-video-feed/\n\nIf it was just one camcorder I suppose I'd look for direct FireWire ?\n\nTaking a look at this implies that you just set up your capture device in the Flash settings. So I guess you probably just need something (a digitising card) that will take some RCA video and present it to the Flash player.\n\nI don't know much about the important digitising side of things - suppose you could try the Stickam forums (currently down for maintenance) or a specialist board like this ?\n\nIt's a bit of a different set-up but just out of interest here is what Leo Laporte was using for his Stickam video - http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/Equipment . So basically it looks like his Canopus box was doing a lot of the work. :hrmph:"
